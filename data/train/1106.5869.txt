    "eta carinae is exhibit a for episodic mass loss near the top of the h - r diagram , for the physics of giant eruptions ( `` supernova impostors '' ) and subsequent recovery , the behavior of outflows above the eddington limit , polar winds , several exotic nebular processes , etc .",
    "most of these topics remain poorly understood , but there is no reason to think that @xmath1 car structurally differs from other extremely massive stars .",
    "a likely companion object affects the phenomena , but does not by itself constitute an `` explanation . ''",
    "beginning in the mid-1940s @xmath1 car began to exhibit occasional spectroscopic changes that we now recognize as a 5.5-year spectroscopic / photometric cycle .",
    "occasionally its high - excitation , [ ] , [ ] emission lines disappear for a few weeks or months while other changes also occur , specifically in the x - ray ( e.g. , @xcite ) and infrared flux ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these `` spectroscopic events '' recur with a period close to 2023 days @xcite .",
    "they have been attributed to ( 1 ) eclipses of a hot secondary star by the primary wind ; ( 2 ) disturbances in the primary wind triggered by a companion star near periastron @xcite ; ( 3 ) a thermal / rotational recovery cycle ; or ( 4 ) a breakup / collapse of the wind - wind collision structure due to known shock instabilities @xcite .",
    "these ideas are not mutually exclusive . either ( 2 ) or ( 3 ) would be significant for massive - star physics in general , because they may require an undiagnosed instability near the eddington limit .",
    "observations of the 2003.5 event appeared to favor possibility 2 and especially 4 , but did not rule out number 3 , and the likely geometry suggests that an eclipse probably occurred with lesser consequences .",
    "photometric behavior , a chaotic x - ray behavior , and an unpredicted @xmath04687 outburst @xcite were especially significant .",
    "meanwhile _ the longer - term behavior changed dramatically . _",
    "the central star brightened rapidly after 1998 @xcite , and major spectral features differed between the 1998.0 and 2003.5 events @xcite .",
    "destruction and/or lessened formation of dust played a role , but the root cause must involve a secular change in the uv flux or the wind density or both .",
    "thus , from the viewpoint of 20072008 , observations of the expected 2009.0 event merited a high priority for comparisons with 2003.5 and 1998.0 .",
    "unfortunately the space telescope imaging spectrograph on the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ stis ) had failed in 2004 , and thus was not available to separate the star from ejecta ( see below ) .",
    "later , after the event was observed as discussed in this paper , stis became operational again and proved that emission lines from @xmath1 car s wind had greatly weakened since 2004 ; the mass - loss rate had probably decreased by a factor of the order of 2 or 3 in a time span of several years ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) . therefore the 2009.0 spectroscopic event occurred in physical circumstances appreciably different from its predecessors .",
    "this should be helpful for deducing the nature of the event , on the same principle as varying parameters in an experiment .",
    "ground - based spectra of @xmath1 car represent an unresolved mixture of the central star plus bright ejecta located at @xmath2 02 to 2 .",
    "fortunately , though , the central star has brightened more than the nearby ejecta in the past decade , so ground - based observations of it have become relatively less contaminated than at earlier times . ] thus , in 2007 we began to observe the star and several offset positions in the homunculus nebula with gmos on the _ gemini - south _ telescope .",
    "apart from the question of secular changes , we planned to measure some aspects of the spectroscopic event better than had been done in 2003 and earlier .",
    "a primary goal was to monitor the behavior of the peculiar @xmath04687 line with more frequent observations during the 2009 event .",
    "we also observed the spectrum reflected by dust in the southeast ( se ) homunculus lobe , a `` polar '' view of the star .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the resulting spectra and the light curve of the central star .",
    "some aspects of the 2009 event have been reported by other authors : @xcite described the behavior of h@xmath3 , @xcite and @xcite commented on the x - rays , reported high - velocity material , @xcite discussed photometry , and @xcite have recently discussed the @xmath04687 emission . here",
    "our scope is broader .",
    "as we explain below , some of the differences compared to the 2003 event provide unexpected new evidence for specific phenomena ; uv photometry of the central star indicates changed conditions ; reflected spectra showing the polar view appear inconsistent with published models of the velocities ; and we strongly disagree with teodoro et al .  concerning the past observational record and theoretical interpretations .",
    "our main new conclusions are that ( 1 ) differences between the 2003 and 2009 events give valuable and specific clues to the phenomena ; ( 2 ) a `` shock breakup '' scenario proposed a decade ago now seems almost inescapable ; ( 3 ) the observed doppler velocities are far less straightforward than most authors have assumed ; and ( 4 ) realistic quantitative models  as opposed to qualitative scenarios or idealized simulations  are badly needed but will be very difficult to achieve .",
    "we also comment on many other observational and theoretical factors .",
    "some important ideas that were discussed in connection with the 2003 event remain valid .",
    "_ hst _ photometry and _ gemini _ gmos observations are described in the next section .",
    "the 20082010 light curve of the central star and the unusually deep minimum during the 2009 event are discussed in section 3 . in section 4",
    "we discuss the peculiar emission during the event , its connection with the x - ray flux curve , and the `` fos4 '' polar view of emission compared with our direct line - of - sight view .",
    "the changing wind geometry during the 2009 event is discussed in section 5 . in the discussion section",
    "we summarize the results , emphasize the new information given by the 2009 event , and raise some outstanding questions .",
    "we have monitored the brightness changes of the central star in several band - passes with photometry from _ hst _ acs / hrc and wfpc2 images and stis spectra since 1998 @xcite . during the 2009 event we monitored the brightness of the central star with the _ hst _ wfpc2 camera using the f255w and f336w filters .",
    "f255w samples the nuv `` forest '' , which greatly increases in opacity during a spectroscopic event @xcite .",
    "f336w includes the balmer continuum augmented by various emission lines .",
    "these filters have been calibrated for direct comparisons with the _ hst _ acs / hrc f250w and f330w filters @xcite .",
    "our own careful checks have led us to conclude that comparisons in these filters across instruments are valid for @xmath1 car .",
    "the images were reduced using the standard stsci data reduction pipeline .",
    "calibrated fluxes were measured in a 03 diameter weighted aperture following procedures described in our previous papers which , combined with the spatial resolution of the _ hst , _ minimize the influence from nearby bright ejecta .",
    "acs - equivalent photometry was also synthesized from _",
    "hst _ stis data before mid-2004 and after mid-2009 ;",
    "spectra were extracted with a weighted parabolic cross dispersion profile similar to the virtual aperture used to measure acs / hrc images , convolved with the filter functions , and integrated @xcite .",
    "the wfpc2 photometry from 2008.7 to 2009.3 and stis synthetic photometry from 2009.6 to 2010.6 is listed in table [ tab : table1 ] .",
    "earlier data from acs / hrc and wfpc2 images and stis spectra can be found in the papers cited above .      to cover the 2009.0 event , we obtained ground - based slit spectroscopy of @xmath1 car with the _ gemini - south _ multi - object spectrograph ( gmos ) beginning in 2007 june through 2010 january . in most cases",
    ", we used the b1200 line grating at three tilt angles to cover the spectrum from @xmath03700 to @xmath07500  .",
    "the 05-wide slit , oriented with a position angle of 160@xmath4 , was placed at four different positions : on the star , two offset positions @xmath5075 relative to the star , and at a position known as `` fos4 , '' 45 from the star in the se lobe of the homunculus .",
    "( operationally this was done by offsetting the slit @xmath6 parallel to itself . ) the star s polar spectrum is reflected by dust at fos4 . ]    since most of this paper is concerned with the @xmath04687 emission and features at nearby wavelengths , we concentrate on the blue spectra of the star and fos4 . table [ tab : table2 ] is a journal of those observations .",
    "true slit positions vary slightly from the four locations described above , due to a combination of blind offset errors and differential atmospheric refraction , which were comparable .",
    "no corrector was available , and our observing goals usually did not allow observations with a vertical slit orientation ( `` the parallactic angle '' ) .",
    "therefore in each case we calculated the apparent position of the star as a function of wavelength , and used the offset slit position that was closest to the star for blue wavelengths .",
    "this procedure was adequate because , in effect , the slit positions overlapped due to the combination of slit width and seeing ; we did not attempt to measure accurate absolute fluxes .",
    "for more information see technical memo 14 on the @xmath1 car treasury program website . ]",
    "we prepared two - dimensional spectrograms using the standard gmos data reduction pipeline in the _ gemini _ iraf package , and extracted one - dimensional spectra via a routine developed earlier for use with _ hst _ stis @xcite . at each wavelength",
    "our software integrates the counts along a line perpendicular to the dispersion , weighted by a mesa - shaped function centered on the local spectral trace .",
    "we used a mesa function with base - width = 11 pixels and top - width = 7 pixels , about 08 and 05 respectively .",
    "the seeing was roughly 0515 , so each gmos spectrum discussed represents a region about 1 across .",
    "the spectra were rectified using a loess fit @xcite .",
    "the pipeline wavelength calibration was improved using the interstellar k absorption line at @xmath03935   and the interstellar absorption line at @xmath05782  .",
    "the absolute wavelength scale was obtained with _ hst _",
    "stis spectra that have better wavelength calibrations . throughout this paper",
    "we quote vacuum wavelengths and heliocentric doppler velocities .",
    "when referring to `` phase '' in the 5.5-year cycle , we consistently use the treasury project system with period 2023.0 days , which has been employed since 2003 without any need for revision ; see http://etacar.umn.edu/ , comments at the end of section 2 in @xcite , and an appendix to this paper . in this paper , time within a spectroscopic event is denoted by @xmath7 , such that @xmath8 at mjd 54860.0 ( 2009 jan 29 ) , mjd 52837.0 ( 2003 jul 17 ) , etc .",
    "periastron most likely occurs within a few days of @xmath8 , but that was not the reason for the choice of zero point .",
    "@xcite arbitrarily use a different zero point that corresponds to @xmath9 d , but the rationale for the long - standing treasury project system is noted in the appendix .",
    "the light curve of the central star from _ hst _",
    "data has two crucial advantages that have been overlooked in some discussions of @xmath1 car s photometric record .",
    "first , all ground - based photometry includes ejecta at radii @xmath10 , practically unrelated to short - term variations of the central star .",
    "this contamination is remarkably strong , varies with time differently than the star , and _ is difficult to quantify .",
    "_ in recent years the ejecta accounted for 4070% of the brightness in the best ground - based photometry at visual wavelengths ; see figure 3 in @xcite . since this relative fraction has lately been decreasing on a timescale of @xmath11 10 years ( see the ref .",
    "just cited ) , future ground - based photometry may eventually become representative of the star but pre-2005 measurements were dominated by ejecta .",
    "the contamination was probably still important during the 2009 event , but the amount is unclear ; see @xcite and the discussion below .",
    "fortunately the high spatial resolution of _ hst _ allows us to sample the central object itself , @xmath12 , with little extraneous contamination  albeit with less precision than high - quality ground - based photometry ( cf .",
    "and http://etacar.fcaglp.unlp.edu.ar/ ) .",
    "a second obvious and important advantage of _ hst _ is access to the uv region @xmath13 nm , where the largest photometric changes occur during a spectroscopic event ( see refs .  in section [ sec : photometry ] ) .",
    "indeed the _ hst _ uv data illustrate an important point of this paper that is not obvious in the ground - based photometry : _ @xmath1 car s 2009.0 event differed from its 2003.5 predecessor .",
    "_ figure [ fig : fig1 ] shows the light curve in the f250w and f330w filters from 1998 through 2010 based on _ hst _ acs / hrc and wfpc2 images and stis spectra .",
    "the two smaller panels expand the light curve around the time of the event and show the minima for the 2009.0 and 2003.5 events superimposed .",
    "the depth of the minimum in the 2009 event was about 1.1 mag in the f250w filter , which is sensitive to the forest , and 0.4 mag in the f330w filter .",
    "by contrast , the corresponding brightnesses decreased only half as much in 2003 .",
    "it is clear from the timing of the observations that this difference is not simply due to a missed minimum in 2003.5 . in order to have a 1-mag amplitude undetected in the 2003.5 observations ,",
    "the 250 nm brightness would need either a strong negative `` spike '' only a few days long , or an appreciably delayed minimum in terms of phase in the 5.5-year cycle , or both .",
    "either of these possibilities would be as remarkable and unexpected as a major difference in amplitudes .",
    "( unfortunately the minimum near 1998.0 is almost unknown . )",
    "@xcite observed a similar but much less dramatic difference between events at visual wavelengths .",
    "in 20082009 they observed decreases of 0.15 to 0.25 mag in the ubvri bands , only 0.020.03 mag deeper than during the 2003.5 event .",
    "it is unclear whether the difference in the depth of the minimum was small because they observed longer wavelengths , or because they measured the brightness of star plus inner ejecta rather than the star alone .",
    "unfortunately we could not obtain suitable _ hst _ data at blue to red wavelengths in 20052009 , because even the shortest integration time allowed for wfpc2 would have greatly over - exposed the star with any of the filters appropriate for photometry at @xmath14 nm .",
    "the ground - based visual light curves suggest a minimum in 2009 between @xmath15 d and @xmath16 d ( @xcite , observations at mjd 5485854863 ; @xmath17 was defined in section [ sec : timing ] above ) . in _ hst _ data , observations at @xmath18 d and @xmath19 d showed the lowest brightness , in agreement with their data .",
    "other aspects of the 2009 event are consistent with broad - band optical and infrared observations of past events .",
    "the star began brightening at an accelerated rate about 40 to 50 days prior to the onset of the event .",
    "it brightened about 0.1 mag in f250w and 0.2 mag in f330w before it steeply declined .",
    "then , after about 150 days in f250w and about 100 days in f330w , the star returned to pre - event levels and resumed its long - term brightening trend .",
    "why have the events become successively deeper in uv photometry ( figure [ fig : fig1 ] ) ? here is one line of reasoning .",
    "the primary star s ill - defined uv photosphere is located in the opaque wind , far outside the star s surface . if the wind density is gradually decreasing on a time scale of @xmath11 10 years ( section 1 above , @xcite , @xcite ) , then the photosphere seen at most times must be shrinking and becoming hotter . during a spectroscopic event ,",
    "however , the mass - loss rate may be enhanced , at least at low latitudes .",
    "this possibility depends on the secondary star s tidal / radiative influence and on the size of the primary wind s acceleration zone @xcite . during an event",
    "the uv photosphere may therefore depend on different parameters than it does between events .",
    "( in principle , near periastron the secondary star might even be able to induce an outflow that is unrelated to the primary s usual wind .",
    "we do not advocate such an extreme model here , but it illustrates the basic idea . )",
    "meanwhile the forest around @xmath20 nm @xcite is sensitive to temperature and density . for these reasons",
    ", one should not be surprised if the uv photospheric size , temperature , and brightness during events follow a different long - term trend than they do at other phases of the cycle ( figure [ fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "the same considerations apply to latitude and longitude dependences of the inner wind , even if there is no enhancement of total mass - loss rate @xcite .",
    "@xmath04687 provides extraordinary clues to the nature of the spectroscopic event .",
    "this is by far the highest - excitation feature known in @xmath1 car s uv - to - ir wind spectrum , it appears only briefly at a certain stage in each event , and it probably signals a flood of very soft x - rays .",
    "@xcite first drew attention to it , but @xcite disagreed with their flux measurements and interpretation , and @xcite concur with the latter in most respects .",
    "based on the martin et al .",
    "analysis , we can summarize the relevant physics :    * since the observed feature almost certainly results from he@xmath21 @xmath22 he@xmath23 recombination , a temporary source of he@xmath23-ionizing photons ( @xmath24 ev ) is required . shocked gas flowing through the wind - wind collision zone",
    "does not produce enough @xmath04687 emission via normal cooling .",
    "* nearly all authors agree that the two stars produce very little radiation above 54 ev . therefore the relevant photons are most likely 54500 ev x - rays produced in the wind - wind shock structure . shocked gas of the primary wind , with pre - shock velocities below 600 km s@xmath25 , is favorable for creating soft x - rays . *",
    "the most suitable locale for @xmath04687 emission is in the primary wind just before it encounters the colliding - wind shocks , and/or in locally cooled condensations within the shocked region .",
    "since the primary - wind shock is unstable , these two choices may co - exist in roughly the same large - scale volume if one smooths over the complex small - scale structures . in",
    "either case @xmath04687 is excited via photoionization by the soft x - rays mentioned above .",
    "* the most plausible energy source is the primary wind .",
    "a naive assessment predicts that the soft x - rays are inadequate for this purpose by a factor of 310 , but several effects improve the efficiency .",
    "martin et al",
    ".  described radiative excitation effects that amplify @xmath04687 ; instabilities in the shocked region tend to increase the number of very soft x - ray photons ; and a brief rise in the primary wind outflow ( hinted by other observations ) would also help . with reasonable parameters , these details can enhance the @xmath04687 flux by a sufficient factor .",
    "* the supply of soft x - rays can temporarily rise to very high levels if the fast secondary - wind shock becomes unstable like the primary - wind side . in that case",
    "the entire wind - wind interface `` disintegrates '' and `` collapses , '' and a chaotic ensemble of subshocks and oblique shocks may exist for a few days or weeks .",
    "this phenomenon may explain the brevity of the @xmath04687 flash as well as the disappearance of 210 kev x - rays .",
    "some of these statements are controversial , but no other quantitative analysis has been published .",
    "@xcite proposed that emission occurs in the acceleration zone of the secondary wind , a much smaller region than those mentioned above .",
    "if one employs consistent physical parameters , their model predicts a @xmath04687 flux two or three orders of magnitude too weak @xcite .",
    "@xcite also focused on the inner wind of the secondary star , but their scenario was very different , emphasizing a collapse of the shock structure followed by accretion onto the secondary .",
    "they gave qualitative arguments for enhanced @xmath04687 emission in specified circumstances , but did not quantify the excitation physics .",
    "their model includes some appealing components which we note in later sections below .",
    "@xcite recently indicated agreement with most of the above outline , and did not attempt a new theoretical investigation .",
    "in summary , the martin et al .",
    "assessment is still the only detailed account of the radiative processes ; and so far there have been no strong arguments against it apart from geometrical details .",
    "below we shall mention various agreements between authors , and then some crucial disagreements .",
    "figure [ fig : fig2 ] shows a time sequence of the @xmath04687 profile during the 2009.0 event , based on _ gemini _ gmos data .",
    "one can liken its appearance to a wave that first moves leftward in the figure , and then is reflected back toward the right .",
    "( note the reversed asymmetry of the profile at @xmath27 d vs.  @xmath28 d. here `` reflection '' alludes to the line profile , not a real physical reflection . )",
    "the greatest source of uncertainty in this feature s strength is the underlying continuum level , which , following @xcite , we estimate by interpolation between @xmath04605 and @xmath04744 .4687 luminosity in 2003 because they chose too high a continuum level , shown in figure 3 in @xcite .",
    "@xcite later adopted the martin et al .",
    "[ foot : foot5 ] ] observations reported by @xcite agree well with ours . at its maximum ,",
    "the @xmath04687 emission extended across 20  or more ( @xmath29 km s@xmath25 ) and had a much larger flux than one might guess from the apparent size of the line profile .",
    "this is true because the apparent `` continuum '' on each side of the line includes considerable @xmath04687 emission ; see figure 3 in martin et al . ,",
    "figure 2 in teodoro et al . , and the marks on the right side of our figure [ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "part of the 20  line width may conceivably be due to thomson scattering rather than bulk velocities .",
    "here we shall ignore some minor anomalies , e.g. , the profile seen at @xmath30 d was blueshifted less than either of its neighbors at @xmath31 and @xmath32 d.    figure [ fig : fig3 ] shows the time development of equivalent width and doppler velocity for @xmath04687 in our _ gemini _ data . here",
    "`` equivalent width '' refers to flux between 4675 and 4694  ( @xmath33 to @xmath34 km s@xmath25 ) ; other spectral features hide the farther line wings .",
    "our equivalent width measurements are listed in table [ tab : table3 ] .",
    "`` velocity '' in figure [ fig : fig3 ] refers to the line s peak . as teodoro et al",
    ".  have noted , the main , double - peaked , 40-day @xmath04687 flash in 2009 closely resembled the 2003.5 event .",
    "its flux grew concurrently with the _ decline _ of 210 kev x - rays ( section [ sec : xrays ] below ) ; the maximum equivalent width agreed with the martin et al .",
    "value for 2003.5 within measurement uncertainties ; the time of significant brightness extended over 46 weeks ; and the decline occurred in only one week .",
    "the most precise time marker for @xmath04687 emission is the midpoint of its decline , which occurred at mjd 54843 or @xmath35 d. the corresponding time in 2003 was close to mjd 52821 @xcite , and the difference of 2022 @xmath5 2 d matches the consensus 2023-day spectroscopic period ( see appendix ) . the decline - midpoint in our _ hst _ photometry at @xmath36 250 nm occurred within a day or two of the same time ( section [ sec : phot ] ) .",
    "moreover , within measurement errors , the most negative @xmath04687 doppler velocity also coincided with the flux - decline - midpoint .",
    "( steiner and damineli noticed the same coincidence in 2003 , and considered it evidence for an eclipse . ) at the time of maximum @xmath04687 brightness 8 days earlier , the line peak had @xmath37 km s@xmath25 ( heliocentric ) ; but then it rapidly moved to @xmath38 km s@xmath25 at the decline midpoint .",
    "later we shall indicate reasons why the similarity between the 2003 and 2009 records is somewhat surprising .",
    "a second , smaller @xmath04687 flare occurred several weeks after the first , around @xmath39 d in figures [ fig : fig2 ] and [ fig : fig3 ] .",
    "its significance will appear in section [ sec : xrays ] below ; it did not match the 2003 spectroscopic event .",
    "independent of that question , two aspects of the `` second episode '' are noteworthy .",
    "first , the feature began to grow soon after its minimum at @xmath40 d , and continued to do so for about a month .",
    "therefore the emitting region was not entirely eclipsed by the primary wind as advocated by @xcite .",
    "a second fact is the rapidity of change in doppler velocity .",
    "the first maximum or episode attained @xmath41 km s@xmath25 , but the emission that reappeared several weeks later had @xmath42 km s@xmath25 .",
    "meanwhile the line profile s asymmetry reversed as mentioned earlier ( figure [ fig : fig2 ] ) .",
    "the overall velocity range greatly exceeds the maximum projected _ orbital _ velocity variation for either star with any proposed 5.5-year orbit . on the other hand , the line - of - sight wind velocities and post - shock velocities can easily differ by more than 400 km s@xmath25 at locations near the path followed by the secondary star near periastron .",
    "this statement may have interesting and controversial implications for the orientation of the orbit , see section [ sec : fos4 ] and section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "unlike the first maximum , _ the second episode in 2009 apparently differed from the 2003.5 event .",
    "_ here we disagree with teodoro et al .  about the 19922003 record , not 2009 .",
    "the most reliable datum for this question was the _",
    "stis observation at mjd 52852 in 2003 , carefully assessed by @xcite .",
    "its timing corresponds to @xmath43 d , only a few days before the phase of the second - episode peak seen in 2009 .",
    "the 2003 stis data showed no detectable line profile at that time , see figure 5 in martin et al . if one defines the emission feature as a bump or profile in the spectral tracing , then martin et al .  found a 3@xmath44 _ upper limit _ of only 0.15  for the equivalent width at mjd 52852",
    "the points plotted in figures [ fig : fig3][fig : fig5 ] represent a different type of measurement , integrating a flux difference @xmath45 over a 19  interval . here",
    "@xmath46 , the underlying continuum level , is the main source of error .",
    "the 2003 stis data point at @xmath43 d in figure [ fig : fig4 ] may therefore be an overestimate , but the absence of a bump in the spectral tracing ( see above ) indicates that it is not likely to be an underestimate .",
    "the observation is consistent with ew @xmath11 zero at that time , and excludes ew @xmath47  ; see sections 5 and 6.3 in martin et al .",
    "if the 2003 event had a second episode matching the 2009 case , then the equivalent width at mjd 52852 should have been close to 0.9  , which would have been obvious in the stis spectrum .",
    "conclusion : _ the 2003 event did not include a second episode matching that seen in 2009 . _",
    "if one did occur at the same phase , then in 2003 it must have been much weaker then 2009 , even though the first maximum was practically alike in both events .",
    "but there is no good evidence for such an occurrence , and in section [ sec : xrays ] we favor the simple view that either 2003 had no second episode or else it was delayed .",
    "the ground - based data are extremely unclear on this question , especially since @xcite disagree with @xcite on major results even though they used similar , overlapping data sets .",
    "only one data point is strongly pertinent : teodoro et al .",
    "estimate ew(@xmath04687 ) @xmath48  at mjd 52841 , eleven days before the 2003 stis observation noted above . in order to accept both this measurement and the stis result , one would need to postulate a sudden decrease between them .",
    "this may be possible , but in that case the record would not resemble the 2009 second episode .",
    "a simpler explanation is that the mjd 52841 datum was an overestimate ( see below ) .",
    "teodoro et al .",
    "also note a data point with ew @xmath49  at mjd 48825 in 1992 ( @xmath50 d ) , and perhaps two weaker ones , but the doubts expressed below apply even more forcefully to them .    here",
    "we must digress on comparisons between ground - based data and _ hst . _",
    "all ground - based spectroscopy of @xmath1 car is seriously ( not just mildly ) contaminated by emission - line ejecta at @xmath2 02 to 2 @xcite .",
    "the size of this effect depends on the spectrograph aperture size and on variable atmospheric seeing .",
    "moreover , it was worse in the 1990 s because the star was relatively faint then @xcite .",
    "there is concrete evidence that narrow emission lines in the ejecta tend to mimic a weak `` @xmath04687 '' feature when the data are smoothed .",
    "details can be found in @xcite ; here is a brief summary .",
    "gemini _ data and slightly decentered stis spectra show many weak narrow spikes near 4687  .",
    "most of them are scarcely distinguishable from noise , except that their wavelengths recur in independent observations .",
    "this fact is not surprising , since the ejecta are known to produce thousands of weak unidentified lines @xcite .",
    "when the spectra are heavily smoothed , some of these tiny features blend to produce a `` @xmath04687 '' bump with height @xmath11 0.51% of the continuum level .",
    "this bump consistently appears near the same wavelength , and it closely resembles the feature reported by @xcite and @xcite in data from pico dos dias _ ( opd ) _ at times when @xmath04687 was weak .",
    "the _ opd _",
    "feature tends to be stronger by a factor of @xmath51 , which can be ascribed to worse atmospheric seeing , a larger spectrograph aperture , and the fact that the apparent brightness ratio ( ejecta / star ) was much larger in the 1990 s than it is today @xcite .",
    "( despite this long - term trend , however , teodoro et al .  found the feature in data as late as 2010 . ) in summary , the _ opd _ data show symptoms of extraneous emission - line contamination , at a level that is not surprising but which strongly affects most of the @xmath04687 observations .",
    "_ hst _ stis , by contrast , had good enough spatial resolution to separate most of the ejecta .",
    "we conclude that pre-2004 ground - based data have very low weight compared to stis in 2003 and many ground - based observations in 2009 .",
    "consequently there is no significant evidence for a second @xmath04687 flare around @xmath39 d in 1992 , 1998 , and 2003 .",
    "there is an interesting puzzle in the observational record .",
    "if we assume similarity among the 1992 , 1998 , and 2003 spectroscopic events , then @xcite depicted a conspicuous second episode _ at a significantly delayed time @xmath7 .",
    "_ their two relevant _ opd _ observations occurred at @xmath52 d in 1998 and @xmath53 d in 1992 , plotted in figure [ fig : fig4 ] as green triangles .",
    "these appeared to be stronger than the most doubtful cases mentioned above .",
    "if valid , they imply second flares in 1992 and 1998 , but at phases roughly 30 days later than the 2009 case  which would make sense for reasons noted in section [ sec : xrays ] below . however , they contradict some 1992 eso data listed by @xcite , and they are not mentioned in the latter paper even though it includes other data from the same instrument .",
    "either there were delayed second episodes in 1992 and/or 1998 ( steiner & damineli ) or not ( teodoro et al . ) .",
    "these inconsistencies reinforce our opinion that ground - based spectroscopy of @xmath1 car in those years was far less robust than the 2003 _ hst _ results and various observations in 2009 .    in summary",
    ": one of the high - quality _ hst _ stis observations in 2003 showed that the event in that year did not include a second episode matching the 2009 record ; and this assertion is not contradicted by any reliable ground - based data . a weaker and/or later second episode may have occurred in 2003 , as we discuss in section [ sec : xrays ] .",
    "@xcite emphasized that @xmath04687 was anti - correlated with @xmath1 car s observable 210 kev x - rays during the 2003.5 event ; the @xmath04687 flash occurred as the x - rays declined ( figure [ fig : fig4 ] ) .",
    "this fact appeared very consistent with a shock breakup as outlined below , and the 2009 `` second episode '' now strengthens the case .",
    "@xcite remarked that known shock instabilities , rather than the eclipse scenario that was popular at that time , can best explain the rapid disappearance of @xmath1 car s 210 kev x - rays during a spectroscopic event .",
    "@xcite noted quantitative details , and @xcite emphasized the relevance of @xmath04687 to this concept ( see section 9.2 of that paper ) .",
    "various researchers later adopted essentially the same idea @xcite .",
    "two specific variants , with different causes but similar consequences , have been proposed .    1 .",
    "a shock structure becomes unstable if radiative cooling exceeds expansion cooling @xcite .",
    "the slow primary - wind shock of @xmath1 car is very unstable in this regard , but the faster secondary - wind shock stabilizes the overall structure in calculated models .",
    "the secondary shock may become unstable _ near periastron , _ causing the entire shock structure to disintegrate on a timescale of 1030 days ( section 9.2 in @xcite ) .",
    "2 .   @xcite drew attention to another phenomenon that @xcite had studied for x - ray binaries in general .",
    "near periastron , soft x - rays from the shocked region can alter the ionization state of the secondary star s wind . a higher degree of ionization tends to weaken the line - driven acceleration , resulting in a slower wind speed ( `` radiative inhibition , '' a term later used by @xcite ) .",
    "this in itself would reduce the 210 kev flux ; but another consequence is that the balance of wind momenta is altered , pushing the shocks closer to the secondary star . in an extreme case the primary wind can entirely suppress the secondary wind .",
    "other instabilities certainly occur , such as kelvin - helmholtz which mixes gas from the two winds , and obvious thermal instability as shocked gas cools below @xmath54 k ; but the two processes listed above have mutually similar large - scale consequences and they might even develop together .",
    "observable 210 kev x - rays rapidly and tremorously disappear as the highest temperature decreases ; a flood of soft x - rays is created by the chaotic ensemble of local shocks as the overall structure breaks up ; and the secondary wind may temporarily cease to exist .",
    "( alternatively , it might survive in a slower form ) .",
    "martin et al .",
    "noted that empirically , without referring to physics , this view is supported by the growing unsteadiness of 210 kev x - rays around their maximum",
    ".    realistic simulation of these phenomena for @xmath1 car would be extremely difficult , and many sets of parameters must be explored .",
    "pending such models , one can estimate the relevant time scales from the overall size of the shocked region and local velocities within it : say 13 au and 100800 km s@xmath25 respectively .",
    "these values suggest @xmath55 2 to 50 days , consistent with the observed behavior .",
    "shock disintegration or collapse was originally only one among several competing explanations for the 210 kev x - ray crash during a spectroscopic event .",
    "then , in 2003 the previously unrecognized @xmath04687 feature behaved just as the shock breakup idea would have predicted .",
    "it appeared approximately when the hard x - rays peaked , it grew as they declined , and then ceased abruptly after a few weeks .",
    "as @xcite noted , one would not expect this sequence and timing in an eclipse model like that of , for example .",
    "@xcite have recently advocated a shock breakup model that closely resembles the earlier conclusions of martin et al .",
    "we differ from teodoro et al .  in two important respects : first",
    ", they state that @xmath04687 originates `` 45 au downstream from the apex '' within the shocked gas . however , as implied in point 3 of the physics summary near the beginning of this section , there is no clear reason for this assumption .",
    "wherever very soft x - rays occur , they indirectly create @xmath04687 in the nearest suitable gas ( which probably does not need to be shocked material ) . most of the applicable energy supply for soft x - rays near periastron is found at distances considerably less than 4 au from the pre - breakup apex or vertex .",
    "moreover , it seems possible or even likely that soft x - rays and @xmath04687 emission may continue for 520 days after the original large - scale shock structure has ceased to exist .",
    "our second difference is that teodoro et al .   give little attention to the evidentiary role of the unforeseen second episode in 2009",
    "; see below .",
    "the 2009.0 event provides a valuable new clue , the second episode discussed in section [ sec : episode2 ] .",
    "figure [ fig : fig4 ] shows that its behavior was a reversal of the first episode seen 40 days earlier .",
    "the @xmath04687 emission reappeared and peaked around @xmath39 d while the 210 kev x - rays were still weak ; then it declined concurrently with the growth of the x - rays .",
    "the overall time scale was comparable to that seen in the first episode . in the shock - instability scenario , of course",
    ", we interpret this pattern as the re - formation of a large - scale shock structure when the relevant densities become sufficiently low for it to be quasi - stable .",
    "this view raises several questions .    * as figure [ fig : fig4 ] shows , the hard x - rays reappeared earlier than expected in 2009 , around @xmath52 d rather than @xmath56 d as seen in 1998 and 2003 @xcite . given this difference ,",
    "_ should the earlier events have shown the same behavior pattern as 2009 ? _",
    "the shock breakup hypothesis `` predicts '' @xmath04687 flares around @xmath57 d in 1998 and 2003 , i.e. , just before the hard x - rays reappeared .",
    "equally important , a @xmath04687 outburst as early as the 2009 case , @xmath39 d , would not be expected .",
    "the second episodes would very likely have been weaker in those earlier events , because the @xmath04687 production rate depends strongly on local densities .",
    "consider , for example , a case with orbital eccentricity 0.9 and periastron at @xmath8 , fairly consistent with most proposed orbit models",
    ". then the separation between stars was about 3.5 au during the pre - periastron @xmath04687 maximum ( @xmath58 d ) , but more than 6 au at @xmath59 d just before the x - rays reappeared in 1998 and 2003 .",
    "if we assume an unchanged primary wind , these values imply a factor - of - three lower density at the expected time of reappearance . according to the martin et al .",
    "analysis , this would reduce the @xmath04687 flux by a factor of 310 compared to its pre - periastron maximum  depending on local gas geometry , velocity gradients , etc .",
    "moreover , the primary - wind density may have been enhanced in the weeks before periastron @xcite .",
    "one should therefore _ expect _ the second episode to have been weak in 1998 and 2003 , possibly undetectable . in 2009 , on the other hand , the second episode occurred earlier with higher densities ; which is the main reason why it is a valuable clue .",
    "( as we explain later , this statement includes a subtle complication involving a secular decrease in wind densities . )",
    "* _ is the observational record consistent with these expectations ? _",
    "the answer is `` yes , '' but unfortunately the pre-2009 data were too sparse for confident conclusions .",
    "we noted in section [ sec : episode2 ] that the second expectation , no substantial @xmath04687 flare at @xmath39 d in 2003 , is confirmed by stis data .",
    "the question of a later flare , however , amounts to a conflict between observations reported by @xcite and those reviewed by @xcite .",
    "the former data strongly imply a @xmath04687 episode peaking around @xmath57 d in 1992 and 1998 , see figure [ fig : fig4 ] and section [ sec : episode2 ] above .",
    "teodoro et al . , on the other hand , omit those two data points and show no definite @xmath04687 emission after @xmath60 d in 1992 and 1998 , and no data points in that time interval in 2003 .",
    "neither of these alternatives would contradict the shock breakup idea ( see above ) , but it would be useful to know whether or not a detectable second episode occurred . since the _ opd _ data are not public ( unlike _ hst _ and _ gmos _ ) , it is difficult to assess these alternatives .",
    "meanwhile , the 2009 data and 2003 stis data constitute the only satisfying results on this question . *",
    "_ why did the emission and hard x - rays reappear earlier than expected in 2009 ? _ referring only to the x - rays , @xcite proposed an explanation based on a decrease in the primary star s wind .",
    "they had a specific model in mind , but the basic idea works for others as well . since 1999 there have been hints that @xmath1 car s wind density is ( or was ) becoming less dense on a timescale of @xmath11 10 years ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite recently reported strong spectroscopic evidence for such a change .",
    "qualitatively , at least , one expects the wind - wind shock structure to recover sooner after periastron if the primary wind is less dense ; because in that case the worst instabilities are weakened . at first sight",
    "the 2009 second flare may seem paradoxical in this view , because , as noted above , lower densities tend to reduce the @xmath04687 emission efficiency .",
    "a partial explanation is that the shock - region density at the time when it re - forms is not the same as the primary wind density measured at some fixed radius ; the two stars were closer together at @xmath39 d in 2009 than they were at @xmath57 d in 2003 .",
    "this brings us to the next question which also concerns timing and separation between the stars . *",
    "suppose , as stated above , that the primary star s wind was less dense in 20082009 .",
    "if so , _ why did nt the shock structure survive later than expected before periastron ? _ with reduced density @xmath61 , one would expect the shocks to disintegrate at a smaller star - star separation , i.e. , later .",
    "in fact the 2009 x - ray crash and the main @xmath04687 flash occurred almost exactly 2023 days after the 2003 event ( section [ sec : episode1 ] and figure [ fig : fig4 ] ) .",
    "therefore , perhaps the characteristic densities at that time did not directly represent the primary star s `` normal '' steady mass - loss rate .",
    "instead , the inner wind may have been tidally or radiatively enhanced during the weeks before periastron , causing the relevant density to be approximately the same for each spectroscopic event .",
    "this hypothesis is not arbitrary or ad hoc , since it also helps to explain a photometric puzzle mentioned at the end of section [ sec : phot ] above , and it was suggested long ago on other grounds ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite have expressed agreement with most , but not all , of the points that we have quoted from @xcite .",
    "one disagreement pertains to the `` second episode '' seen in 2009 .",
    "above we emphasized the _ anti - correlation _ between @xmath04687 flux and hard x - rays at critical times .",
    "teodoro et al .",
    ", however , state instead that the two are _ correlated _ but @xmath04687 is delayed by 16.5 days .",
    "we strongly disagree , based on semi - theoretical reasoning plus an empirical fact .",
    "( 1 ) those authors interpret the 16-day delay as the time required for shocked gas to flow from a favorable x - ray region near the vertex or apex of the umbrella - shaped shock structure , to another location where it has cooled enough to produce emission . for this explanation one needs",
    "a localized density enhancement , which must pass near the shock vertex and later reaches some particular radius at a well - defined time after flowing outward within the shocked zones .",
    "but these are unlikely assumptions in the context of an extended , chaotic , unstable shock structure .",
    "there is no clear reason for the localized density enhancement ; only a tiny fraction of material flowing outward from either star passes close to the shock vertex ; gas is vigorously mixed and diffused within the shock structure ; the overall geometry is probably unstable at the critical time as noted above ; and there is no reason to assume that emission occurs only beyond a certain distance from the vertex .",
    "in other words the proposed rationale is very unclear .",
    "( 2 ) our second , more empirical reason is simpler : the 16-day delay proposed by teodoro et al .",
    "is obviously inconsistent with the @xmath04687 second episode observed in 2009 ( figure [ fig : fig4 ] ) .",
    "maximum emission occurred _",
    "after _ the hard x - ray peak in the first episode , but _ before _ the x - ray recovery in the second .    in summary",
    ": strictly speaking we can not prove the shock breakup scenario , but the combined @xmath04687 and x - ray data are impressively consistent with it . in terms of logic ,",
    "the role of @xmath04687 has been as follows .",
    "first , this feature was not recognized when the breakup idea was first proposed ; but then it turned out to fit into that scenario in a remarkably natural way . later , when a post - periastron `` second episode '' appeared in 2009 as discussed above , it too matched quite naturally , and the observed secular decrease in wind density provides a good explanation for the differences between 2003 and 2009 . in neither case was there any need to alter the concept to fit new observations .    in terms of theoretical development , @xcite and @xcite stressed that shock breakup is a reasonable concept for @xmath1 car ; then @xcite and @xcite argued that it is a very likely one .",
    "@xcite later cited other x - ray clues , notably that gas dynamic computations have not sustained the competing eclipse scenario .",
    "given these facts , and lacking a viable alternative explanation , we conclude that @xmath1 car s colliding - wind shock structure does , indeed , disintegrate and collapse during a spectroscopic event .",
    "two separate questions are ( 1 ) whether the primary star has a mass - loss outburst at about the same time , and ( 2 ) whether the secondary star accretes material then .",
    "see section [ sec : discussion ] below .",
    "is @xmath04687 emission detectable in @xmath1 car only during spectroscopic events ? according to @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "this feature has been present at other times . on the other hand , @xcite found no broad in non - event _ hst _ stis spectra of the central star .",
    "stis mapping data in 2009 june and december show no broad @xmath04687 emission in extended regions around the star . analyzing observations made with _",
    "stis , _ gemini _ gmos , and _ irne du pont _ b & c , we find that a weak emission feature exists but it is only about 3  wide , i.e. , narrower than the emission seen when it is bright . as noted in section [ sec : episode2 ] , it is most likely a blend of very weak , narrow , unidentified lines and not broad emission @xcite .",
    "spectra reflected by dust in the homunculus nebula give surprising new information about velocities in the 2009 event .",
    "the known geometry of the bipolar homunculus allows us to correlate each position in the southeast lobe with stellar latitude , assuming that the polar axis of @xmath1  car  is aligned with the homunculus axis .",
    "fos4 is a location near the center of the se lobe ( the one nearer to us ) which reflects a nearly pole - on view of the stellar wind , @xmath62@xmath4  latitude .",
    "our direct view probably represents @xmath63@xmath4  latitude @xcite .",
    "fos4 is also useful for another reason , namely that ground - based spectra there are less contaminated by nebular lines than direct observations of the star are .",
    "( the reasons for this fact are not entirely clear , but generally speaking our direct view of the star appears to have more circumstellar extinction than the average line of sight . )",
    "fos4 is located about 37 south and 2535 east of the central star .",
    "a spectrum reflected in the homunculus has a light - travel - time delay @xmath64 corresponding to the additional path length , and an extra doppler shift @xmath65 due to the `` moving mirror '' effect . with standard assumptions about the homunculus ,",
    "these are related by @xmath66(age ) , where `` age '' means elapsed time since the reflecting material was ejected in the 1840 s .",
    "the value of @xmath65 depends on location in a straightforward , observable way that depends on the shape of the homunculus lobe , see figure 4 in @xcite .",
    "in fact we can define fos4 as the location where @xmath67 km s@xmath25 , which implies @xmath68 d for the 2003 and 2009 spectroscopic events .",
    ", however , reported a time - delay of only 10 days for appearance and disappearance of @xmath04687 in 2003 , comparing _ vlt _ uves observations of fos4 to observations by @xcite which were centered on the star .",
    "if correct , this would cast doubt on standard analyses of the reflection model , homunculus expansion , etc .",
    "the good time coverage of our _ gemini _ gmos data during the 2009 event , both on the star and on fos4 , allows us to re - evaluate this result .",
    "figure [ fig : fig5 ] shows the equivalent width and radial velocity measurements of @xmath04687 in spectra of the star in direct view and reflected at fos4 .",
    "it also includes re - measured equivalent widths in uves data during the 2003.5 event , shifted by 2023 days .",
    "the gmos data show that the time - delay in the observed equivalent widths as well as radial velocities , between the direct view on the star and the pole - on view at fos4 , is about 18 days which confirms the expected @xmath69 d within the attainable accuracy . also",
    ", re - measurement of the uves data during the 2003.5 event according to the method employed by @xcite show that the earlier data are in accordance with the gmos 18 days value .",
    "we detected a positional gradient of @xmath64 , which agreed with the simple model within the measurement errors .",
    "the geometry of the reflection process therefore appears satisfactory .",
    "unexpectedly , we find that _ the behavioral pattern of @xmath04687 emission is very similar when viewed from different directions , _ i.e. in direct view of the star and reflected at fos4 , when we take the time - delay into account .",
    "values for the equivalent widths and radial velocities are slightly smaller at fos4 than in the direct view .",
    "figure [ fig : fig5 ] shows these results , with doppler velocities corrected for the moving - mirror effect @xmath65 .",
    "@xmath04714 seems to exhibit similar behavior , but can not be measured well because its line profile changes shape in a more complex way than @xmath04687 ( section [ sec : wind ] below , and @xcite ) . _",
    "these results suggest that velocities of helium lines are not simply related to orbital motion of the secondary star , _",
    "if we assume that the orbit inclination is @xmath70 4045@xmath4   like the homunculus midplane , see refs .",
    "cited above . in standard models",
    "the view from fos4 should be almost perpendicular to the plane of the orbit , and therefore no large radial velocity variations should be observed there .",
    "thus the data at fos4 are very surprising .    as examples ,",
    "let us mention just two of the published models .",
    "@xcite proposed that helium lines originate in the acceleration zone of the secondary star .",
    "assuming we view the orbit at an inclination of 4045@xmath4 , then the doppler velocity variation observed in our direct view , @xmath71 km s@xmath25 , implies values of @xmath72 km s@xmath25 in the plane of the orbit .",
    "the variation at fos4 is @xmath73 km s@xmath25 ; if we interpret this too as the projection of a velocity in the orbital plane ( 7080@xmath4  inclination at fos4 ) , then true values of @xmath11 7501500 km s@xmath25 are needed . in order to attain high enough projected flow velocities ,",
    "the soker and behar model would therefore require fos4 to `` see '' @xmath04687 emission formed farther out in the acceleration zone than the emission in our direct view .",
    "this is not easy to arrange , because the emission process is inherently isotropic .",
    "even more significant , one would also need to explain velocity _ variations _ that greatly exceed any credible orbital velocity .",
    "we shall comment later on possible alterations of the assumed inclination .",
    "similar arguments apply to models in which the helium emission originates in or near the wind - wind collision region ; for instance the interpretation by @xcite is quite inconsistent with the fos4 data .",
    "no matter whether one ascribes the observed doppler variations to orbital velocities or to successive illumination of wind regions near the moving secondary star , fos4 was expected to differ from a direct view of the star .",
    "the differences should have been far more conspicuous than our observations show .    given the consistent time - delay at fos4 , it is very difficult to imagine that the above result is mistaken ; but here we can offer only conjectures to explain it .",
    "one might reconcile the data with a different inclination @xmath74 , such that the projected orbit appears alike from both our point of view and fos4 .",
    "but that idea would `` multiply the hypotheses '' by requiring _",
    "two _ unlikely assumptions : ( 1 ) the orbit plane must be tilted 2025@xmath4  from the homunculus midplane , and ( 2 ) the azimuthal direction of the tilt must be aligned with both our line of sight and that of fos4 , so they share nearly the same projected velocities in phase with each other . in other words , both the latitude and longitude of the tilt must be suitable .",
    "this recourse seems too artificial and _ ad hoc _ to be an appealing first choice .",
    "a better explanation might be that the observed doppler variations represent `` global '' changes in outward velocities , roughly spherical outflows that are not given a strong directionality by the secondary star .",
    "( an extreme form of this view might even return to the single - star mass ejection proposed by .",
    "we do not intend to go that far , but the question is worth contemplating . ) a shock breakup model may conceivably act in a quasi - spherical way , with chaotic random velocity components during the critical time .",
    "the same statement applies to enhanced mass - loss from the primary star .",
    "independent of these thoughts , _ our fos4 results cast doubt on attempts to derive orbit parameters from apparent emission - line velocities . _",
    "_ hst _ stis data revealed that some spectral features depend on viewing direction and that the global stellar wind geometry changes during the cycle @xcite .",
    "the most dramatic effects occur at low latitudes , while the dense polar wind remains relatively undisturbed during an event .",
    "departures from spherical symmetry are critical for theories of winds and instabilities in the most massive stars and we therefore re - examine selected spectral features at differing latitudes in our _ gemini _ gmos data .",

    "estimate the value of @xmath129 but ignore its time @xmath133 which may be ill - defined .",
    "a local quadratic fit may be appropriate , but fortunately there is no need for very high precision in @xmath129 ( see below ) .",
    "2 .   do the same for @xmath130 , and calculate the midpoint @xmath134 .",
    "3 .   then estimate the midpoint time @xmath135 , _ based only on the data points that are nearest to it .",
    "_ if many data points are available , for instance , one might use only those in the range @xmath136 where @xmath137 . in favorable circumstances either a linear or a cubic fit gives practically the same result .    in effect",
    "this is a specialized form of interpolation .",
    "each step employs only a local subset of the data , so local irregularities in behavior around the maximum and minimum do not affect @xmath138 much . in the case of @xmath1 car",
    "s events , @xmath138 is only weakly sensitive to the estimated values @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "this is true because , for most observables , the curve @xmath132 is approximately antisymmetric near the midpoint and the rate of descent is quite rapid there .",
    "note that theoretical significance plays no role in the empirical reasoning .",
    "for an especially successful example , @xmath1 car s ` j ' magnitudes in 2003 reported by @xcite , the rms formal error in @xmath138 is only @xmath139 day .",
    "we employed the same method for some details in section [ sec : episode1 ] above .",
    "@xcite used a method that is more general but is not as well suited to @xmath1 car in particular . in effect",
    ", their procedure mixes data in a broader time interval , thereby allowing a stronger dependence on behavior details around @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "@xcite defined a phase zero point based on an extrapolation , which of course is inherently far less robust than interpolation .",
    "report high - quality ground - based photometry since 2003 , but it is extremely unfortunate that the earlier jhk program described by @xcite and @xcite was forced to close before the 2009.0 event .",
    "their results give precise estimates of a time related to the 2003.5 event , and their earlier data give fairly good results for the 1998.0 event ( see below ) .",
    "here we estimate the 20032009 inter - event time interval from our _ hst _ uv photometry ( section [ sec : phot ] ) , because these data represent the stellar wind with little contamination by ejecta at @xmath140 .",
    "unfortunately the temporal sampling is sparse compared to ground - based photometry .",
    "table [ tab : table4 ] lists the results for @xmath138 in three events and five wavebands .",
    "here we use jhk photometry by feast et al .  and whitelock et al .",
    "cited above , and our uv photometry .",
    "jhk wavelengths are pertinent because light reflected by dust in the ejecta is less than for ubvri .",
    "the quoted uncertainties are semi - formal rms standard errors based on observed scatter or deviation of the data points and other details ; these appear to be realistic , judging from the scatter in the three periods based independently on j , h , and k. note that @xmath138 for a particular event may depend on wavelength ; it is the _ difference _ between events that we are concerned with here .",
    "the jhk data indicate an interval 2021.5 @xmath5 0.9 d between the 1998.0 and 2003.5 events ; this compares with 2022.7 @xmath5 1.3 d found by @xcite with less suitable methods and a much larger set of data , and 2022.8 @xmath5 0.5 d found by @xcite from ground - based photometry in 20032009 .",
    "the _ hst _",
    "330 nm value is obviously consistent with these , but the 250 nm result appears discordant .",
    "this may be a real effect ; the 250 nm wavelength region physically differs from the others because it represents the forest ( section [ sec : phot ] ) .",
    "unfortunately there is no assurance that uv photometry will be possible during the next , 2014.6 event .",
