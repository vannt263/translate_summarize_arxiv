    "we report the first high - energy - resolution measurements of nuclear de - excitation lines in a solar flare .",
    "these lines were detected by the _",
    "reuven ramaty high energy solar spectroscopic imager ( rhessi ) during the goes x4.8-class solar flare of 23 july , 2002 , which occurred at coordinates s13e72 on the solar disk ( @xmath1 heliocentric angle ) .",
    "the characteristics of this flare are reviewed in depth in @xcite .",
    "_    gamma - ray lines from inelastic interactions of accelerated ions with ambient nuclei in solar flares @xcite were first observed by @xcite .",
    "the de - excitation lines can be doppler shifted due to the nuclear recoils from the ion interaction and the emission of the gamma ray .",
    "the line profiles thus reveal the angular distribution of the interacting ions @xcite . accelerated protons and @xmath2-particles",
    "produce narrow lines while accelerated heavy ions produce broad lines which merge together to form an underlying nuclear continuum .",
    "@xcite analyzed an ensemble of gamma - ray line flares from the _ solar maximum mission gamma - ray spectrometer ( _ smm / grs ) .",
    "they found that narrow lines exhibit @xmath3  1% redshift for flares at small heliocentric angles , but are not appreciably shifted near the limb of the sun .",
    "their measurements are consistent with a distribution of interacting particles which is isotropic in the downward hemisphere and zero in the upward hemisphere . _",
    "_    although the _ smm / grs data yielded useful measurements of some nuclear - line redshifts and put constraints on the line widths , the energy resolution of that instrument was moderate , averaging around 4% fwhm over the nuclear - line range .",
    "_ rhessi @xcite was designed to provide high - resolution measurements of the shape and redshift of de - excitation lines using cryogenically cooled germanium detectors to achieve an energy resolution averaging around 0.2% fwhm from 16  mev @xcite . _ _",
    "the _ rhessi spectrometer consists of nine coaxial germanium detectors , each divided into a @xmath31  cm upper segment ( which stops most hard x - rays ) and a @xmath37  cm rear segment .",
    "here we use only data from the rear segments , which have most of the efficiency for stopping gamma - rays above 300  kev @xcite .",
    "detector # 2 , which is operated in an unsegmented mode and has degraded energy resolution , was not used .",
    "the spectra in figure  1 were accumulated from 00:27:20 to 00:43:20 ut on 23 july , 2002 , an interval that includes most of the high - energy emission from this flare @xcite . _    the flare intensity is roughly half the background level above @xmath31  mev .",
    "the instrumental gamma - ray background is caused by the interactions of cosmic rays and protons trapped in the radiation belts with materials in the spacecraft and the atmosphere .",
    "every 15 orbits ( about one day ) , the geomagnetic coordinates of the spacecraft approximately repeat themselves , and therefore so do the cosmic and trapped particle fluxes . thus we model the background during the flare with the average of two spectra , taken 15 orbits before and after the flare , each of which is the same length as the flare observation itself . above 3  mev , however , we replaced this background spectrum with a different one using a full day s integrated data . in this high - energy band",
    "the background is simple in form and nearly free of lines , so that we can can get an accurate background estimate with small statistical fluctuations , regardless of the exact orbital parameters , simply by rescaling the full - day integration to match the intensity of the @xmath4 15-orbit spectrum .",

    "it was also necessary to represent two other components of the spectrum : the very broad lines from interactions of accelerated heavy ions with ambient hydrogen , and the faint lines from other proton- and @xmath2-induced lines that can not be measured individually . within the statistical limitations of the data ,",
    "the sum of these components is well - represented by three very broad gaussians centered at 1845 , 4358 and 6575 kev .",
    "bright narrow lines were included from positron annihilation @xcite and neutron capture @xcite at 511  kev and 2223  kev , respectively . finally ,",
    "weak lines at 1263  kev and 6918  kev of intermediate width were also included , representing expected features which are compounds of more than one line .",
    "the fitting was done with the spectral executive ( spex ) package @xcite , taking into account the full diagonal and off - diagonal response of the instrument @xcite .",
    "the spectra for the six bright de - excitation lines are shown in figure  1 and the fit parameters are given in table  1 .",
    "the features at @xmath3840  kev in the upper left panel of figure  1 and @xmath31807  kev in the lower left panel may be the 844  kev and 1809  kev solar de - excitation lines of aluminum @xcite , but if so are at a surprisingly high flux .",
    "the effect of the instrumental resolution ( about 3.0  kev at 847  kev , 4.1  kev at 1779  kev , and @xmath3 10  kev at 6129  kev ) has been removed from the width measurements , but , except for the @xmath5fe line , it is negligible compared to the solar line widths .",
    "the best - fit gaussians and their zero - redshift versions are also shown in figure  1 .",
    "zero redshift is visibly inconsistent with the data for most lines .",
    "the redshifts and widths from table  1 are shown in figure  2 .",
    "heavier nuclei will recoil less from a collision with a proton or @xmath2-particle , and will thus show less redshift and broadening .",
    "this trend is clearly visible .",
    "the expected relation is not exactly linear , since the average energy of the accelerated particles interacting with each nucleus depends on the the cross section for excitation . the neon line , which appears to have a redshift below the trend in figure  2 , has the lowest threshold for excitation .",
    "the sum of the fluences in the narrow lines of table  1 is 137  ph  @xmath46 .",
    "@xcite calculated the total fluence in narrow lines for 19 x - class flares observed by _ smm / grs . estimating the contribution of fainter lines not in table  1 by comparison with the flares studied by @xcite",
    "gives a total line fluence of about 180 ph @xmath46 for this flare , similar to the brighter events from _ smm / grs , which include flares from goes class x2.8 to x15.0 .",
    "_ _    table  1 and figure  2 also show _ smm / grs results from @xcite for the average of five flares close to a heliocentric angle of @xmath47 .",
    "the most striking difference is the lack of redshift in the lines from carbon and oxygen , in significant disagreement with our result for the 23 july 2002 flare .",
    "the null redshift and high broadening in the _ smm / grs neon line are in marginal disagreement with _ rhessi as well .",
    "the advantage of high energy resolution is clear : the _ rhessi results are more precise using a single flare than the _ smm / grs result for the average of five flares , even though _ rhessi is a smaller instrument . with more flares observed at high resolution , we will be able to tell whether this disagreement between _ rhessi and _ smm / grs is due to intrinsic variations between flares or to the limitations of _ smm s moderate - resolution spectroscopy . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    we use the modeling code of @xcite , which allows an arbitrary angular distribution of interacting particles about an axis at an arbitrary angle to the observer ( @xmath48 ) . for particles distributed with respect to a radial field line",
    ", @xmath48 is equal to the heliocentric angle , 73@xmath49 for this flare .",
    "the simulation generates separate gamma - ray spectra for @xmath2-particles and protons , and includes the effects of nuclear recoil both from the interaction and the emission of the gamma ray .",
    "thus , even a purely downward beam of incident protons gives broadened lines due to the range of recoil angles .",
    "we simulated two angular distributions for the interacting ions : 1 ) isotropic within the forward hemisphere and zero in the hemisphere toward the observer , and 2 ) beamed directly forwards .",
    "since we will explore the possibility that the magnetic field is not perpendicular to the solar surface , we will use `` forward '' to mean along the magnetic field away from the observer and `` downward '' to mean perpendicular to the solar surface .",
    "distributions with no forward bias , such as a fan beam or a full isotropic distribution , give no redshift and thus disagree strongly with the redshift values in table  1 .",
    "for each of the distributions , the viewing angle @xmath48 was run at 0@xmath49 , 30@xmath49 , 45@xmath49 , 52@xmath49 , 60@xmath49 , and 73@xmath49 .",
    "interpolations along cos(@xmath48 ) gave line shapes for intermediate angles .",
    "the proton and @xmath2-particle energy spectra were modeled as power laws with index 3.75 , and the @xmath2/proton ratio was fixed at 0.5 , both consistent with results from _ smm / grs @xcite .",
    "figure  3 shows the @xmath17ne line shape predicted by the forward - isotropic model for a viewing angle of 30@xmath49 . _    for both models and each viewing angle , we fitted the model lineshapes ( e.g. figure  3 ) to the data , allowing the line fluences and the underlying broad lines and continuum to vary to minimize @xmath50 .",
    "figure  4 shows the relative @xmath50 for the two angular distributions and all viewing angles .",
    "the forward isotropic model is clearly a much better fit , but it fits best with a viewing angle of 3040@xmath49 . if the field lines of the loop were perpendicular to the solar surface at their base , where the ions interact , the viewing angle would be the heliocentric angle of the flare , 73@xmath49 .",
    "this is inconsistent with the data at greater than 99% confidence .",
    "_ rhessi s ability to image gamma rays allows us to be certain that the line emission comes from near the flare , i.e. near 73@xmath49 @xcite .",
    "_    we have run further simulations with power - law indices from 1.75 to 4.75 and @xmath2/proton ratios from 0.0 to 2.5 . in all cases",
    "the best - fit viewing angle for the forward isotropic case is close to 3040@xmath49 and inconsistent with 73@xmath49 .",
    "note that even the forward beam , which produces the maximum possible redshift of any distribution , still fits best with a viewing angle smaller than the heliocentric angle .",
    "for spectral index 2.75 and harder , the forward beam can fit as well as the forward isotropic distribution .",
    "a redshift could be caused either by recoil from an anisotropic distribution of interacting ions or by bulk motion away from the observer of the medium in which they interact .",
    "we believe the latter is not significant here for two reasons .",
    "first , in the case of bulk motion the percentage redshift is a constant , and not inversely proportional to the mass of the excited nucleus ( figure  2 ) .",
    "second , although downward flows in the chromosphere have been observed in impulsive flare events via red wings in h@xmath2 line profiles , the velocities are only 2050  km / s ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , implying redshifts of no more than 0.007 - 0.017% , a trivial fraction of the total gamma - ray shifts .",
    "two explanations remain for the large redshifts : either the field lines in the loop legs are inclined toward us instead of being perpendicular to the solar surface , or else the angular distribution of the interacting particles is closer to a pure forward beam than a forward - isotropic distribution .",
    "forward - isotropic or isotropic distributions of interacting @xmath2-particles are strongly favored over a downward beam in a study of the lines at 0.429 and 0.478  mev from @xmath2@xmath2 reactions in this flare @xcite and in flares observed with _",
    "smm / grs @xcite . also , the low average redshifts of the @xmath17ne , @xmath31c and @xmath39o lines in all the flares seen by _",
    "smm / grs @xcite , including those used in table  1 , favored a downward isotropic distribution ( or one with a slight additional upward component ) to a downward beam . _ _",
    "if , on the other hand , magnetic loops containing accelerated ions are inclined from the perpendicular for this flare , it may help explain why the _ smm / grs widths are larger than ours in table  1 .",
    "@xcite combined five flares to get their result near @xmath47 , and if these had a wider range of @xmath48 than of heliocentric angle , differing redshifts could combine to make a broader line .",
    "solar active regions often do contain inclined loops , and the magnetic topology of regions such as this one ( `` @xmath51 '' ) that produce the largest flares also tend to be the most complex .",
    "_    a more detailed analysis of nuclear de - excitation line shapes can constrain not only the angular distribution of the particles but also the @xmath2/proton ratio ( as can be seen from the different component shapes in figure  3 ) and even the spectral index . the full power of the spectral analysis of gamma - ray lines ,",
    "however , will be realized when the constraints imposed by the line shapes are combined with information from the gamma - ray line fluences and from other observations such as gamma - ray and x - ray imaging @xcite , magnetograms and imaging at other wavelengths , and the decay profile of the neutron - capture line @xcite .",
    "the work at the university of california , berkeley and at nasa s goddard space flight center was supported by nasa contract nas5 - 98033 , and that at the naval research laboratory by nasa dpr w19746 .",
    "we thank hugh hudson , gordon hurford , brian dennis , george fisher , and benzion kozlovsky for useful discussions ."
