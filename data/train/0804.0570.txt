    "a matching is a maximum cardinality set of vertex disjoint edges .",
    "our problem is a generalization in the sense that the term edge may be replaced by 2-edge - path called @xmath0 .",
    "more formally , we study the following problem , called * @xmath0-packing : * + * given : * a graph @xmath8 , and the parameter @xmath6 . + * we ask : * is there a set of @xmath6 vertex - disjoint @xmath0 s in @xmath9 ? + p. hell and d. kirkpatrick  @xcite proved -completeness for this problem .",
    "@xmath0-packing attracts attention as it is -hard whereas the matching problem , which is @xmath10-packing , is poly - time solvable .",
    "+ also there is a primal - dual relation to total edge cover shown by h.  fernau and d.  f. manlove  @xcite . recall that an edge cover is a set of edges @xmath11 that cover all vertices of a given graph @xmath8 .",
    "an edge cover is called total if every component in @xmath12 $ ] has at least two edges . by matching techniques ,",
    "the problem of finding an edge cover of size at most @xmath6 is poly - time solvable .",
    "however , the following gallai - type identity shows that finding total edge covers of size at most @xmath6 is -hard : the sum of the number of @xmath0 s in a maximum @xmath0-packing and the size of a minimum total edge cover equals @xmath13 .",
    "+ there is also a relation to test cover .",
    "the input to this problem is a hypergraph @xmath14 and one wishes to identify a subset @xmath15 ( the test cover ) such that , for any distinct @xmath16 , there is an @xmath17 with @xmath18 .",
    "test cover models identification problems : given a set of individuals and a set of binary attributes we search for a minimum subset of attributes that identifies each individual distinctly .",
    "applications , as mentioned in k.  m.  j. bontridder _",

    "@xcite , range from fault testing and diagnosis , pattern recognition to biological identification .",

    "_ could show for the case tcp2 , where for all @xmath19 we have @xmath20 , the subsequent two statements .",
    "first , if @xmath21 has a test cover of size @xmath22 , then there is a @xmath0-packing of size @xmath23 that leaves at least one vertex isolated .",
    "second , if @xmath21 has a maximal @xmath0-packing of size @xmath24 that leaves at least one vertex isolated , then there is a test cover of size @xmath25 .",
    "this also establishes a close relation between test cover and total edge cover .",
    "so , we can employ our algorithms to solve the tcp2 case of test cover , by using an initial catalytic branch that determines one vertex that should be isolated .",
