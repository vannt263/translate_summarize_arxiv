    "@xcite realized that the distribution of optical luminosities of cluster galaxies empirically follows the same functional form that has been introduced on theoretical grounds by @xcite to describe the halo mass function .",
    "this functional form is now known as the _ schechter function_. it combines a power law at the faint end with an exponential cutoff at the bright end and is uniquely determined with three parameters .",
    "the function has been shown to describe luminosities of galaxies in field environments too @xcite .",
    "parameterization of the optical luminosity function ( lf ) using a schechter function has simplified comparisons of different samples of galaxies , including samples at different redshifts , and the determination of the cosmic luminosity density ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    with the advent of multiwavelength galaxy surveys , lfs began to be constructed in the far - ir ( e.g. , @xcite ) , near - ir ( e.g. , @xcite ) , uv ( e.g. , @xcite ) , as well as for optical emission line luminosities ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it was generally expected that these lfs will also follow the schechter function , and most of these studies , often times using lfs with very limited dynamic range , confirmed such expectations .",
    "one striking exception was the lf in the far - ir @xcite , which was possible to construct over a very wide dynamic range ( @xmath1 dex in space density ) and which showed a significantly shallower decline at the bright end than the exponential decline of the schechter function .",
    "while this difference between far - ir and other lfs have been acknowledged ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the expectations set by the perceived ubiquitousness of the schechter distribution led some to considered the far - ir lf as anomalous and perhaps deviating from the schechter form because of an agn contamination ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we show that there is a different explanation for such deviations from the schechter form .",
    "we propose that there are two fundamentally different galaxy distribution functions : ( 1 ) of the _ stellar mass _",
    "( the mass function , mf ) and of the ( 2 ) _ star formation rate _ ( the sfr function ) .",
    "luminosity functions in different parts of the spectrum will be related more to one type or the other .",
    "optical ( especially in bands past the 4000  break ) and near - ir luminosities arise from lower - mass stars that contain most of the stellar mass , therefore these luminosity functions belong to mass function type . on the other hand the emission in the uv , the nebular line emission ( e.g. , h@xmath0 , [ oii ] ) and",
    "the thermal ir is more closely related to young stellar populations .",
    "therefore , such lfs , if properly dust corrected , should belong to the sfr function type .    what are the true underlying functional forms of the stellar mass function and the sfr function ?",
    "are they different ? in the last decade",
    "advances in stellar population modeling and the availability of large surveys made the determination of the galaxy stellar masses possible for a large number of galaxies .",
    "being more fundamental than the optical luminosity function , the mf received prompt attention .",
    "it too was found to follow schechter s functional form @xcite .",
    "indeed it can be said that the lfs in the optical and the near - ir reflect the underlying schechter - like distribution of stellar masses .",
    "accurate sfr functions are more difficult to construct than the mfs due to the caveats and larger uncertainties involved in deriving sfrs ( e.g. , @xcite ) . as pointed out , some lfs of sfr type were found to be consistent with a schechter form ( uv and h@xmath0 ) while others , most notably the far - ir , was not .",
    "the current literature has not fully explained this difference .",
    "the role of dust has been implied in , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a related question , why lfs from young stars ( uv and h@xmath0 ) appear to have the same schechter - like distribution as lfs dominated by old stars ( optical and near - ir ) , received even less attention .",
    "this study sets out to determine the intrinsic form of the sfr function ( in turn testing the adequacy of the schechter function ) and to explain why different tracers produce different results .",
    "knowing the appropriate parametric form of the sfr function will help interpret the observations at the range of redshifts and will facilitate comparison with galaxy formation simulations .",
    "to carry out the search for the functional form of the sfr function ( sfrf ) we adopt a simple framework in which we produce volume - complete mock samples of galaxies (  2.1 ) that are described by two quantities : stellar mass and sfr , where the stellar mass is drawn from a schechter function , while the sfr is obtained by empirically motivated relations between mass and sfr .",
    "we apply a series of three such sfr  mass relations of increasing complexity , the final of which being a relatively realistic representation of the observed sfr  mass plane .",
    "we then study the sfr distributions produced by each relation and discuss functional forms that can be used to describe them (  2.22.4 ) .",
    "readers not interested in the details of these exercises should skip to the summary in  2.5 .",
    "we conclude that schechter formulation is not adequate for describing the sfr function .",
    "instead , functions that replace the exponential function at the high end with a gaussian represent a far better description .",
    "next , in  3 we discuss the implications of the use of non - schechter functions for the derivation of the sfr density . in ",
    "4 we apply the proposed functional forms to the observed local sfrf and find excellent agreement . in  5",
    "we discuss the observed properties of lfs of sfr type ( uv , h@xmath0  and ir ) and provide explanation as to why uv and h@xmath0lfs appear to be well described using the standard schechter function despite being forms of a sfr function .",
    "we show that the schechter - like behavior is a coincidence stemming from the non - application of dust corrections ( or from application of only _ average _ statistical corrections for dust ) instead of dust corrections based on more robust measurements of the attenuation on an _ individual _ galaxy basis . on the other hand , we show that the non - schechter form of far - ir lfs more closely reflects the true sfr function and is not the result of a purported agn contamination .",
    "cosmological parameters @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 are assumed throughout .",
    "we express all stellar masses and sfrs assuming chabrier imf .",
    "the goal of this paper to evaluate the adequacy of the schechter function for describing the star formation rate function and to propose eventual alternatives to this function . in order to perform such an evaluation",
    "the `` true '' expected star formation rate function must be known .",
    "we derive the expected sfrf from the combination of two relations which are well - determined locally : the stellar mass function , and the stellar mass  sfr relation .    to produce sfr functions we construct mock samples in the following way :",
    "we draw a large sample from a mass function that follows schechter parameterization . then , to each mock galaxy we associate a sfr based on a sfr  mass relation .",
    "we explore three different types of stellar sfr ",
    "mass relations : ( 1 ) simple power - law relation between sfr and mass with no scatter , ( 2 ) power - law relation with scatter , and the ( 3 ) bimodal power - law relation with scatters in both modes .",
    "as discussed below , each succeeding relation is meant to be more realistic than the previous .",
    "the last should come very close to describing true sfrs . for sfrfs resulting from these relations we test the adequacy of the schechter function and search for other functional forms that potentially describe them better .",
    "to define the underlying schechter mass function from which the mock samples of galaxies are drawn we adopt parameters from @xcite who present a mass function based on the sdss spectroscopic sample . for our choice of hubble constant and imf",
    "these schechter parameters have the following values : mass function normalization @xmath5 mpc@xmath6 dex@xmath7 , characteristic mass ( converted from salpeter imf by dividing the mass by 1.228 , based on @xcite models ) @xmath8 ( in solar mass units , throughout ) , and the faint - end slope exponent of @xmath9 .",
    "this mf was constructed using data with @xmath10 , but we verify that its schechter function fit is in excellent agreement with the latest @xmath11 mf measurements from @xcite , which means that it can be safely extrapolated to lower masses .    from this mass function",
    "we draw two volume - complete mock samples : ( 1 ) a mass - limited sample with @xmath12 and ( 2 ) a sfr - limited sample with @xmath13 .",
    "sfrs are assigned to each galaxy according to one of the three sfr  mass relations as previously described .",
    "distinguishing between the two samples with different types of limits is important because each affects the shape of the sfr function differently .",
    "the exact choice of limits has no consequence on the inferences drawn from the analysis , but we wish that they reflect some realistic scenarios . for the mass - limited sample",
    "we take the limit to be @xmath14 , which is approximately the lowest mass for which statistically large samples can be extracted from sdss ( e.g. , @xcite ) . to this sample",
    "we do not impose any limits in terms of sfr .",
    "for the sfr - limited sample we take the limit of 0.01 @xmath15 , but no mass limit . throughout this",
    "work sfrs represent true , dust - corrected sfrs .",
    "this sfr limit matches the completeness limits of surveys that target very nearby galaxies ( such as the local volume legacy ( lvl ) survey , @xcite ) .",
    "most of the galaxies that produce stars at the rate around the limit are dwarfs with @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "this sfr - limited sample will probe a fraction of actively star - forming dwarfs at that mass , and principally all star - forming galaxies above @xmath16 (   2.3 ) . in the local universe",
    "this sfr limit probes 99% of the total sfr density (   [ sec : sfrd ] ) .",
    "the volume for the mock samples is @xmath17 mpc@xmath18 and was chosen to be large enough so that the features of the sfr function are not significantly affected by the poisson noise over a large dynamic range in space density ( @xmath1 dex ) .",
    "the mass - limited sample contains @xmath19 galaxies , and the sfr - limited sample up to @xmath20 , depending on the sfr ",
    "mass relation used .",
    "unlike real surveys our samples are volume - complete by construction , so no completeness corrections are required ( for reviews of the construction of the observed luminosity functions see @xcite ) .",
    "recent studies at low ( e.g. , @xcite ) and intermediate redshifts ( e.g. , @xcite ) have found that for actively star - forming galaxies there is a relatively tight and straight sequence in log @xmath21 vs.  log sfr space , which has been dubbed the _ star - forming sequence _",
    "@xcite or the _ galaxy main sequence _ @xcite .",
    "straight sequence in log space is equivalent to a power - law relation between sfr and mass ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the reasons behind the existence of the relation are currently the focus of many theoretical studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    here",
    "we adopt the empirical relation derived in the local universe ( @xmath23 ) from @xcite ( eq .",
    "11 ) :    @xmath24    where masses and dust - corrected sfrs were obtained through the use of uv / optical sed fitting of _ galex _ and sdss fluxes of galaxies falling in the star forming part of the bpt diagram @xcite .",
    "the relation is shown in figure [ fig : noscat ] ( upper panel ) and is sub - linear ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "other studies have found different values of @xmath26 , but they are usually sub - linear @xcite .",
    "equation [ eqn : sfr_mass ] is applied to masses drawn from the schechter mass function to obtain their corresponding sfrs .",
    "sfrs are then binned in 0.1 dex intervals to obtain sfr functions shown in figure [ fig : noscat ] ( lower panels ) .",
    "error bars represent gaussian approximation of the poisson error and are typically extremely small for most of the bins , meaning that the features of sfrfs are accurately determined . to ensure more even weighting",
    "when performing the fitting , we add in each bin 0.03 dex ( 7% ) of systematic error , similar to errors in well - determined empirical lfs @xcite .",
    "what functional form best describes the sfr functions in figures [ fig : noscat ] ( lower panels ) ?",
    "their appearance suggests that they would be well fit with a standard schechter function : d(\\log x)$ ] . ]",
    "@xmath27    where @xmath28 , @xmath29 is the characteristic sfr , @xmath30 is the normalization ( expressed in units of mpc@xmath6 dex@xmath7 or mpc@xmath6 mag@xmath7 throughout ) and @xmath0 is the `` faint''-end power - law exponent .",
    "we show the best fitting schechter function , obtained by minimizing @xmath31 , as solid lines in figures [ fig : noscat ] ( lower panels ) .. ] the schechter fits do not follow the sfrfs exactly",
    ". the low - sfr ( `` faint '' end ) slope of both fits tends to be shallower than the sfrf points .",
    "similarly , the knee of the fits appears to lie at lower sfrs than what is expected visually .",
    "finally , at the high end the fits are slightly shallower than the sfr function .",
    "this mismatch is corroborated with the large @xmath31 per degree of freedom ( reduced @xmath31 ) values of @xmath32 and 7.0 for the mass and sfr - limited cases , respectively .",
    "why is the schechter function not a perfect fit as may perhaps be expected ?",
    "the answer is that after the power - law transformation , the exponential part of the schechter function becomes modified into a srsic function . unlike the exponential function which has a fixed high - end slope ,",
    "the srsic function will have different slopes based on the extra parameter that is featured in it .",
    "the reason why the sfr function constructed in this way appears to be a schechter function is because on a logarithmic plot the _ shapes _ of exponential and srsic functions are identical modulo the scale factor , i.e. , we can always pick an @xmath33 scale such that the two shapes are exactly the same .    to properly fit the sfr distribution constructed using eq.[eqn : sfr_mass ]",
    "the schechter function needs to be modified by introducing an additional parameter : the power - law exponent @xmath26 between the mass and sfr .",
    "we call such function the _ extended schechter function _ : d(\\log x)$ ] . ]",
    "@xmath34 dx , \\label{eqn : xsch}\\ ] ]    the exponential part of the standard schechter function became the srsic function , with @xmath26 being equivalent to the srsic index .",
    "the extended schechter function is the regular schechter function when @xmath35 .",
    "we confirm that the extended schechter function fits the values of the sfr function perfectly and retrieves parameters of the generating mf and sfr  mass relation . as @xmath36 .",
    "] we do not show these fits in figure [ fig : noscat ] ( lower panels ) since they would simply pass through all the points with zero deviation .    the need for extending the schechter function in order to model certain distribution functions",
    "has recently been recognized in @xcite , following @xcite , and in @xcite .",
    "@xcite notice that galaxy sizes and velocity dispersions scale as power laws with respect to the optical luminosity ( @xmath37 ) and therefore remark that `` if @xmath37 is well fit by a schechter function , it makes little physical or statistical sense to fit the other observables with a schechter function as well . '' should be @xmath38 ) .",
    "furthermore , @xmath26 in @xcite and @xcite is the slope of mass vs.  @xmath39 and therefore the inverse of our @xmath26 . ]",
    "@xcite is the only work to our knowledge that has attempted to apply the extended schechter formulation to a sfr - like distribution ( a simulated ir lf ) .",
    "the relation between mass and sfr assumed in this section is very simplistic , so even the extended schechter function will not accurately reproduce all the features of real sfr distributions , nevertheless , it already demonstrates that sfr functions can not be adequately described by schechter functions .",
    "while the sfr vs.  mass relation is relatively tight , any scatter around this relation that is not correlated with the mass would affect the shape of the resulting sfr function .",
    "we model this scatter with a gaussian ( in log sfr ) of @xmath40 dex , again based on the results from @xcite .",
    "the scatter along the sf sequence increases with mass from 0.3 to 0.4 dex , but the constant value is a reasonable approximation for this exercise .",
    "this scatter is predominantly intrinsic , since the sfr errors in @xcite for galaxies on the sf sequence are @xmath41 dex .",
    "the sfr  mass relation with scatter is shown in figure [ fig : scat ] ( upper panel ) .",
    "figures [ fig : scat ] ( lower panels ) show the sfr functions for the mass and the sfr - limited samples .",
    "there are several notable differences of these sfrfs with respect to the case with no scatter . at the high end",
    "the tail is now much less steep extending to higher sfrs ( note that the horizontal scale in figures [ fig : scat ] ( lower panels ) is much wider than in figures [ fig : noscat ] ( lower panels ) ) , so the knee appears `` softer '' .",
    "the mass and sfr - limited sfrfs start to differ significantly at @xmath42 .",
    "the sfr function of the mass - limited sample ( figure [ fig : scat ] ( lower left panel ) ) now features a turnover and drops off at the low end .",
    "this feature is due to the tail of galaxies close to the low - mass limit that scatter below the mean sfr@xmath21 relation .",
    "the fall off is obviously a mathematical consequence of the presence of the mass limit , but it is easy to confuse it with volume incompleteness , which is why we show its effects separately . for the sample with no mass cut ( figure [ fig : scat ] ( lower right panel ) ) there is no such turnover and the sfrf continues to rise . knowing how the sample is selected is therefore very important in interpreting the `` faint '' end of any observed sfr function .",
    "the fall off at the low sfrs can also be seen in the cosmological simulations of the sfr function of @xcite and the semi - analytic modeling of @xcite , with both groups using mass limits in their simulations .    in evaluating the functional forms that could be used to describe these sfr functions we again start with the regular schechter function ( eq .",
    "[ eqn : sch ] ) .",
    "for the mass - limited sample ( figure [ fig : scat ] ( lower left panel ) ) we limit the fitting to the part higher than the turnover , ( @xmath43 , dotted vertical line ) , since obviously the schechter function ( or the extended schechter function ) will not be able to reproduce the drop at low values .",
    "the red line shows the best fit .",
    "one can see that the shape of the schechter function is quite inadequate , and the resulting parameters are consequently of little value .",
    "the regular schechter function does not perform much better for the case of the sfr - limited sample either ( red line in figure [ fig : scat ] ( lower right panel ) , with both the low - end slope and the high - end drop too steep and the knee too high .",
    "formal reduced @xmath44 values are in both cases extremely large ( 17 and 23 , respectively ) .",
    "note however that in some real datasets where the data points have significantly larger error bars and the dynamic range is small , a schechter function fit could be formally acceptable , leading one to believe that the distribution is intrinsically of schechter form .",
    "on the other hand , the _ extended _ schechter fit brings significant improvements in describing both samples ( blue lines in figures [ fig : scat ] ( lower panels ) ) , with @xmath45 and 1.2 for the mass and sfr - limited distributions , respectively .",
    "note , however that even the _ extended _",
    "schechter function can not reproduce these sfrfs perfectly .",
    "the consequence is that the best - fit parameters can not be directly mapped back to parameters of the underlying mass distribution and the relationship between the mass and the sfr . in sfr ",
    "mass relation without scatter , @xmath26 represented the slope of the sfr ",
    "mass relation .",
    "now , the best fits have @xmath26 values of 2.08 and 3.03 for the mass and sfr limited distribution respectively , in contrast with sfr  mass slope of 0.65 .",
    "the only way to reproduce these sfr functions exactly would be to again reverse the process by which the sfrs were constructed .",
    "this can be achieved with the extended schechter function _",
    "convolved _ with a gaussian .",
    "such a `` function '' would feature 5 or 6 parameters : four of the extended schechter function , the scatter @xmath46 , and also the mass limit for mass - limited samples .",
    "we confirm that this function fits sfrfs in figures [ fig : scat ] ( lower panels ) perfectly ( fits not shown ) , with the resulting parameters again having an interpretable meaning .",
    "however , for any sfrf based on real data the cost of two to three additional parameters with respect to the number needed to describe the schechter function will be too large ",
    "the resulting fits would suffer from a high degree of degeneracy and we will consequently not consider this construct in further analysis .",
    "@xcite provided an approximate analytical expression for the effect of the measurement error on the extended schechter function in the limit of small @xmath46 ( their eqn .",
    "10 and 11 ) .",
    "however , that form is not appropriate for the level of scatter encountered here , which is dominated by large intrinsic scatter .",
    "this is exemplified by the fact that the distribution corrected in that way does not preserve the total number density of galaxies since the correction factor is always greater than one .      after including the scatter in the sfr ",
    "mass relationship we now add one final element to bring mock sfrs close to the realistic ones : galaxy bimodality . galaxy bimodality is most often used to describe the character of optical color distribution .",
    "the blue mode of the color distribution corresponds to the star - forming sequence , which is what was modeled in the previous sections .",
    "the optical red mode corresponds to galaxies that do not belong to the star - forming sequence and thus have little or no sf .",
    "we refer to them as passive galaxies .",
    "they include optically red galaxies with sfrs measurably different from zero ( e.g. , the green valley galaxies detected using uv - optical colors ; @xcite ) and the galaxies with upper limits on sfr consistent with no sf .",
    "if the passive galaxies were taken to have exactly zero sfr then the modeling of the sfr distribution reverts to the unimodal case (  [ ssec : scat ] ) , with the only difference being that the underlying mass function would be for blue ( star - forming ) galaxies alone . however , it is more realistic to characterize passive galaxies with a range of non - zero sfrs , especially since passive galaxies on the massive end can reach relatively high sfrs ( @xmath47 ; @xcite ) .    to specify bimodal sfr  mass relations for use in our modeling",
    "we again draw on the data derived in @xcite .",
    "expressions for separate sf and passive sequences were not given in that paper , so we determine them now by fitting in each mass bin two gaussians in log sfr .",
    "we find that the modeling of the sfr distribution at a given mass with two gaussians describes these distributions remarkably well .",
    "unlike in optical color where the colors of passive galaxies quickly saturate ( the red sequence ) , the passive sequence is quite broad in log sfrs resulting in peaks that are not well separated , with no pronounced dip between them . the data probe the passive sequence very well by reaching down to @xmath48 .",
    "the peaks of gaussians yield the following sfr  mass relations that are very well described with power laws . for the sf sequence :    @xmath49    which is slightly shallower than the sf sequence defined by sf galaxies selected using the bpt diagram ( eqn .",
    "[ eqn : sfr_mass ] ) ,    and for the passive sequence :    @xmath50    the scatter of which varies from 1.5 dex at @xmath51 to 0.7 dex at @xmath52 , and is again a combination of measurement errors and , to a larger extent , the intrinsic scatter . for simplicity ,",
    "in our modeling we take the scatter of passive sequence to be fixed at 1.1 dex , while for the sf sequence we use a scatter of 0.4 dex as previously .    at each mass",
    "we determine the passive fraction from the ratio of the area below the gaussian of the passive sequence and the total areas of both gaussians , which can be obtained from :    @xmath53    where @xmath54 is the height of the peaks .",
    "it increases from around 30% at @xmath16 to 80% at @xmath55 .",
    "the passive fraction is well described as a quadratic function of mass :    @xmath56    in figure [ fig : bim ] ( upper panel ) we show the sfr vs.  mass values of the simulated bimodal distribution .",
    "it was constructed so that for each galaxy we first determine if it is passive or active using a random number and equation [ eqn : fpass ] .",
    "then we draw sfrs from appropriate sequence and add the corresponding scatter . since the passive sequence has a fairly large scatter we do not allow a passive galaxy to have a sfr greater than the sf sequence ( eqn.[eqn : sfr_mass ] ) increased by @xmath57 ( i.e. , 0.4 dex ) . in such cases",
    "we draw a new value for the sfr . for the mass - limited sample a full span in mock sfrs",
    "is now @xmath58 orders of magnitude .",
    "the resulting sfr functions are shown in figure [ fig : bim ] ( lower panels ) , for the mass and sfr - limited samples respectively .",
    "the two distributions start to depart below @xmath59 .",
    "the main difference of the bimodal mass - limited sfrf compared to its unimodal counterpart is an even more gradual drop to lower values due to the relatively low sfrs of the low - mass passive galaxies , and the presence of the inflection point ( the `` dip '' ) at @xmath60 , reflecting the bimodal nature of the sfr distribution at each mass . on the other hand , the sfr - limited distribution remains monotonic because at each sfr it is dominated by galaxies in the star - forming sequence .",
    "we again seek an appropriate functional fit for these sfr functions , beginning with the sfr - limited distribution .",
    "since the sfr - limited distribution is very similar in the bimodal and unimodal case , the regular schechter function can be ruled out as a satisfactory form based on previous considerations . as in the case of the unimodal distribution ,",
    "the _ extended _",
    "schechter function represents an excellent fit ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "we show it in figure [ fig : bim ] ( lower right panel ) with a blue line .",
    "while the extended schechter function represents an excellent functional form for fitting the sfr - limited sfrf , recall that its introduction was motivated by `` inverting '' the power - law mass  sfr dependence in the simple unimodal case with no scatter . as a result of that the exponential tail changed into a srsic function .",
    "now , we consider another alternative : a function that like schechter and extended schechter maintains the power law at the low end , but now features a gaussian ( in log sfr ) at the high end .",
    "we refer to it as the _ saunders function _ , since it was first proposed in @xcite to model lf at 60 @xmath61 m .",
    "the linear form of the saunders function can be expressed as :    @xmath62    note that the `` gaussian '' part of this function tends to a gaussian when @xmath63 , and to a constant when @xmath64 .",
    "this modification ( the addition of 1 in the argument of log ) allows the low end to transition smoothly into a power law .    fitting the saunders function to a sfrf constructed using the bimodal sfr",
    " mass relation and sfr - limited sample ( figure [ fig : bim ] ( lower right ) ) we obtain a very good fit with @xmath65 .",
    "this is slightly worse than what the extended schechter fit yielded ( @xmath66 ) , however , whether one or the other is better will depend on the level of scatter , especially in the sf sequence .",
    "we know that for the unimodal sfrs , in the limit of zero scatter the extended schechter function is a perfect analytic description , but this will be less true for large scatter . for the scatter assumed here ( 0.4 dex for the sf sequence ) , both functions are basically equally good approximations .",
    "the saunders function has one significant advantage over the extended schechter function ",
    "its parameters are less easily perturbed by errors in sfrf and , therefore , the relative accuracy of the parameters corresponding to the saunders fit is higher . in the case of the bimodal sfrf",
    "discussed here the saunders fit has @xmath67 smaller errors in log sfr@xmath68 and log @xmath30 and @xmath69 smaller uncertainty in the `` faint''-end slope .",
    "this is the result of the significantly lower level of covariance among the parameters of the saunders function . on average",
    "the pearson correlation index for saunders function parameters is 0.70 , while it is 0.94 for extended schechter .",
    "most importantly , the parameters describing the `` faint '' and the `` bright '' ends have a correlation of only 0.33 in saunders function ( @xmath70 and @xmath46 ) , and yet 0.87 in the extended schechter function ( @xmath71 and @xmath26 ) .",
    "while the saunders function has been proposed for describing the 60 @xmath61 m lf , which can be considered a type of sfrf , the motivation for its introduction was simply to provide a functional form that better describes the real data than the standard schechter function .",
    "here we show that the reasons behind such good representation have to do with the nature of sfr and its relation to the stellar mass .",
    "turning now to the mass - limited sfrf ( figure [ fig : bim ] ( lower left panel ) ) , if we only aim to fit the part to the right of the turnover ( @xmath72 ) , then the same conclusions hold as in the sfr - limited case : the extended schechter function represents an excellent fit ( @xmath73 ; blue line in figure [ fig : bim ] ( lower left panel ) ) .",
    "similarly well does the saunders function ( not shown ) .",
    "is it possible to successfully fit the entire distribution including the low - end drop and the dip ?",
    "both the extended schechter function and the saunders function are monotonic and feature a power law at the low - end , so they will be incapable to reproduce the inflection or the low - end drop .",
    "thus we test a new functional form : a _ a double ( i.e. , composite ) gaussian _ function ( in log sfr ) , in which each gaussian should fit one of the two modes of sfr distribution .",
    "this function is given in the log form as :    @xmath74    where    @xmath75    represents the gaussian corresponding to the passive population and    @xmath76    the gaussian of the sf population , each with its own standard deviation and peak position .",
    "double gaussian features six parameters , but the covariances are weak between each set of three .",
    "indeed , when we fit the double gaussian we obtain very good results ( solid green line in figure [ fig : bim ] ( lower left panel ) , with the individual components shown with dotted green lines ; on a log - log plot the double gaussian is represented as two parabolas ) .",
    "the fitted gaussian standard deviations are @xmath77 and @xmath78 , reflecting the scatters of the passive and sf sequences .",
    "as in the case of the saunders function , the parameters of the double gaussian are significantly less sensitive to sfrf uncertainties than the parameters of the extended schechter function . while much better than any other practical alternative , the double gaussian is not a perfect fit ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "it produces slightly stronger inflection ( deeper dip ) than what is seen in the sfrf . also , recall that when we constructed sfrs we required that sfrs from the passive sequence do not exceed sfrs of the sf sequence by more than 0.4 dex .",
    "however , no such restriction is imposed in the fitting , so the passive gaussian extends a bit too much at the high end .",
    "clipping the passive gaussian where it starts to exceed the sf gaussian brings the reduced @xmath44 to 1.5 .    note",
    "that the success of the double gaussian in fitting the sfrf is not a mere consequence of the fact that in each mass bin we modeled sfr ",
    "mass relations as the sum of two gaussians because the slope of the sfr ",
    "mass relation is significantly larger than zero ( i.e. , the gaussians from different mass bins have different centers in sfr ) .    to our knowledge",
    "the double gaussian was not previously considered as a functional form for the sfr function .",
    "a single gaussian ( lognormal function in linear sfr ) has been suggested by @xcite .",
    "however , such form ( a parabola on the log - log plot ) is apparently inadequate when the details of the sfr function are considered , i.e. , when it is measured precisely below log sfr@xmath80 .",
    "@xcite notice the `` double peak '' feature in their @xmath81 mass - limited sfr functions and suggest that this `` peculiar feature '' might be connected to bimodality .",
    "our analysis shows that bimodality is indeed the explanation .      summarizing the modeling section",
    "we conclude that the schechter function is an inadequate description for any realistic sfr function . instead ,",
    "sfrfs derived from the sfr - limited sample can be sufficiently well modeled using either the extended schechter function or the saunders function ( a power law with a gaussian decline at the high end ) .",
    "the latter is recommended because its parameters , being less covariant , will be more stable and yield higher relative accuracy . for the mass - limited sfrfs",
    "the double gaussian represents an excellent solution .",
    "note that in all of these cases the fitted parameters will not directly be interpretable as the parameters of the underlying mass function or the sfr ",
    "mass relation , but they will provide robust descriptions of sfrfs that can be compared from one study to another .",
    "there are two primary reasons for which describing the sfr function with an analytic function form is useful .",
    "one is to characterize this distribution through parameterization , to facilitate the study of its evolution with redshift .",
    "the second is to use the parameterization to infer , by integration that involves extrapolation , the total sfr _",
    "density_. in that case the schechter formulation is especially practical because its cumulative distribution function is finite when @xmath82 and has a simple analytic expression .",
    "since , as we have demonstrated , the schechter formulation does not provide an adequate description of the observed sfr function , alternative methods are needed for inferring the total sfr density . while all of the alternative functions that we have considered ( the extended schechter , saunders and the double gaussian ) also have finite cumulative distributions , they can not be integrated to yield functions in a closed form .",
    "therefore , we will instead employ our bimodal model ( constructed based on @xmath83 sfrs ) to provide numerical correction coefficients to be applied to the sfr density determinations in the local universe obtained from the direct numerical integration of the observed sfrf down to some sfr limit , based on sample with some mass limit .",
    "the fraction of the total sfr density that will be present in the observed local sfrf to a given limit is shown in figure [ fig : sfrd_lim ] .",
    "the mass limit can be read continuously from the @xmath33-axis , while each of the curves represents some sfr limit .",
    "the black solid curve shows the fraction accounted for at different mass limits if there was no sfr limit .",
    "going to @xmath16 in such case ( corresponding to the mass limit that we explored heretofore ) probes 92% of the local sfr density ; i.e. , the values obtained from integrating the sfrf in figure [ fig : bim ] ( lower left panel ) would have to be corrected upward by 9% .",
    "it should be noted that in the presence of a mass limit the correction is not due to mere extrapolation of the sfrf , but serves to correct for lower mass galaxies that contribute at a range of sfrs .",
    "having the sfr limit of @xmath84 ( red dotted curve ) leads to negligible difference with respect to the case with no sfr limit . on the other hand ,",
    "a limit of @xmath85 ( green dashed curve ) captures only 64% of the sfr density in the local universe .",
    "we emphasize that if only the sfr limit is present one could recover the missing sfrd by simply extrapolating the faint - end power law tail ( of course , assuming the slope is well constrained ) , but if the mass limit is also present one would have to account for it too , using , for example , the provided figure or performing modeling similar to that presented here .",
    "similar technique can also be used to estimate the yield of a planned survey or to estimate corrections due to incompleteness .",
    "next we investigate the shape of the _ observed _ sfr functions and test whether they can indeed be described with the functional forms determined based on simulated sfrs in ",
    "[ sec : sfrf ] .",
    "we construct the sfr function from uv / optical - based sfrs of @xmath86 galaxies from @xcite .",
    "this dataset only has a mass limit ( @xmath87 ) and can formally yield specific sfrs as low as @xmath88 , which corresponds to very low sfrs even for massive galaxies .",
    "the sfrf from constructed from these data is shown in figure [ fig : obs ] ( upper panel ) .",
    "as expected for the mass - limited sample , the sfrf drops off at low values .",
    "overall , its shape is quite similar to the bimodal _ mock _ sfrf presented in figure [ fig : bim ] ( lower left panel ) .",
    "this is not too surprising because the construction of the mock sfrs was guided by these observations , but it should be kept in mind that the sfr  mass relations we used incorporated some simplifying assumptions ( e.g. , fixed scatter ) .",
    "we previously concluded that the _",
    "double gaussian _ function is the most suitable description of the mock bimodal sfrf with a mass limit .",
    "we fit that function to the observed data points and indeed obtain a very good fit ( shown by green curves in figure [ fig : obs ] ( upper panel ) ) .",
    "the resulting goodness of fit is @xmath89 .",
    "the parameters of the best fit are :    @xmath90    @xmath91    to construct the sfrf we co - added @xmath92-weighted _ probability distribution functions _ for each galaxy s sfr .",
    "this is possible because the sfrs in @xcite were obtained using the bayesian sed fitting . in bayesian",
    "sed fitting each model sed contributes ( proportionally to @xmath93 ) to the probability distribution of a galaxy parameter ( such as the sfr ) .",
    "using full probability distributions for each galaxy s sfr ( instead of a singular value ) has the advantage that it produces more realistic distributions for ensemble of galaxies . since full probability distributions of sfrs",
    "are not always available , we also considered the sfrf where each galaxy is represented by a single value of sfr ( the mean of the probability distribution ) .",
    "such sfrf is shown in figure [ fig : obs ] ( lower panel ) .",
    "we overlay it with the best double gaussian fit obtained using full probability distributions .",
    "there is an excellent agreement between the two especially in the region fit by the star - forming gaussian , including the high - end tail .",
    "the latter means that the distribution in the high - end tail is not due to some galaxies having broad sfr probability distributions reaching very high values .",
    "discrepancies start to appear only below @xmath94 , because galaxies with very low sfrs usually have broad ( poorly constrained ) probability distributions , so when these are collapsed into a single value for sfr their extent towards very low values gets somewhat compressed . in any case ,",
    "such low sfrs have very little effect on any global characterization of the sf .    our mock sfr functions in",
    "  2 assumed that masses are drawn from a schechter function .",
    "deviations of the mf from the schechter form are known @xcite , but they are relatively small and mostly pertain to lower - mass passive galaxies @xcite . the ability to reproduce the observed sfrf using functions suggested by mock sfrfs confirms that these deviations are not significant in the context of this study .",
    "our analysis of mock sfrfs and observations from @xcite show that real sfrfs have significant departures with respect to a schechter function .",
    "one usually determines the sfr based on the luminosity of a tracer population of young stars , such as the far - uv continuum luminosity , emission line luminosity ( e.g. , h@xmath0 , oii or pa@xmath0 ) , or from the dust luminosity in some part of the ir sed ( pah lines , mid - ir continuum , far - ir continuum or the total ir luminosity ) .",
    "it is then to be expected that the _ luminosity functions _ of these various tracers would show similar departures from the schechter distribution as the sfrf . while such departures have been known for a long time in the ir ( especially the far - ir ; e.g. , @xcite ) , there is a general consensus that the far - uv lf as well as the h@xmath0  lf _ do _ to a large degree agree with the schechter function ( e.g. , @xcite for uv and @xcite for h@xmath0 ) .",
    "how can we explain this apparent inconsistency ? as the analysis in this section will show , the primary reason for this is because the observed , _ uncorrected _ uv and h@xmath0lfs have a form that is similar to a schechter function by coincidence ( similarly for lfs where dust is `` corrected '' by applying average statistical relations ) . on the other hand lfs , where the luminosity of each galaxy is individually dust corrected ( thus becoming a true sfr ) , do show large departures from schechter form in line with our analysis for sfrfs .",
    "the departure of the lfs from the schechter form , even with individually applied dust corrections , is more difficult to recognize in high - redshift studies which feature small samples with the resulting lfs having limited dynamic ranges , which is why this section will discuss more robust observational evidence from lower redshifts .",
    "the characterization of galaxies in the ultraviolet has greatly improved with the launch of _ galex _ , which surveyed most of the sky in two uv bands ( fuv , 1500  ; nuv , 2300  ) .",
    "based on the _",
    "galex_/2df observations of @xmath95 galaxies @xcite presented fuv and nuv lfs for local ( @xmath96 ) galaxies .",
    "these `` early '' uv lfs were satisfactorily fit with schechter functions in line with previous uv studies . in figure",
    "[ fig : fuv_lf ] ( upper panel ) we present an updated version of the fuv lf based on @xmath9730,000 galaxies from @xcite .",
    "all magnitudes are on ab system and are @xmath98-corrected to @xmath99 and corrected for galactic reddening .",
    "open points show lf of fuv absolute magnitude not corrected for internal dust attenuation , i.e. , like those of @xcite and many other works that present _ uncorrected _ uv lfs .",
    "a standard schechter function is fit to the uncorrected lf ( red curve ) .",
    "while it visually appears as a good fit the large sample reveals that @xmath44 is 3.7 , a relatively large value .",
    "closer look reveals that the faint end - slope of the fit is slightly steeper than the lf points and also that the fit falls somewhat more steeply at the bright end ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "@xcite were unable to identify these discrepancies because their lf had a significantly larger error bars and moreover , because the brightest point of their lf was at @xmath101 , just before the departure from the schechter form starts to become apparent at the bright end .",
    "indeed , @xcite , using the same dataset as the one we use , but analyzed independently , mention the high - end deviation from schechter .",
    "they tentatively ascribed it to the agn contamination in the uv .",
    "however , broad - line agns that could affect the uv continuum were already removed in these samples , so this explanation seems unlikely . in any case , this not - so - perfect agreement between uv lf and schechter function was generally neglected .    altogether",
    ", the observed uv lf has qualitatively small departures from the schechter form , while given our results in   2 and 4 we would expect a lf of sfr type ( such as the uv lf ) to be very poorly fit by the schechter function .",
    "this is because uv lf , not corrected for dust , is not equivalent to a sfrf .",
    "indeed , the departure from the schechter form becomes much more severe ( @xmath102 ) when the uv lf is constructed from _ dust - corrected _ fuv absolute magnitude , which we show as solid dots in figure [ fig : fuv_lf ] ( upper panel ) .",
    "the dust attenuation applied in figure 6 is obtained on galaxy - by - galaxy basis from fitting of the full uv - optical sed @xcite and is mostly constrained by the uv slope . if , on the other hand one was to apply a fixed dust correction , such `` corrected '' lf would simply be the uncorrected lf shifted to brighter magnitudes , while the shape and the steep , schechter - like bright end would remain .",
    "interestingly , even applying somewhat more sophisticated statistical dust correction brings the `` corrected '' lf only slightly closer to its true shape . for example , many studies apply a mass or optical luminosity dependent dust correction . from our data on sdss/_galex",
    "_ sf galaxies we find that the medians in mass bin yield the following relation between fuv attenuation and stellar mass :    @xmath103    if we apply this statistical correction to fuv absolute magnitudes the resulting lfs still features a relatively steep bright end , which in lfs with smaller dynamic range could again easily be misinterpreted as conforming to a schechter function . the reason why even the mass - dependent dust correction can not reproduce the true sfrf is because at any given mass the dispersion in dust corrections is very large",
    "( we find 0.7 mag scatter in @xmath104 at @xmath105 ; similarly large scatter can be seen @xcite analysis of sdss balmer decrements ; their figure 4 ) and it is the values that scatter above the average relation that are important in shaping the bright end of the lf .    guided by our previous considerations regarding the sfrf we can attempt to fit more appropriate functions to both the uncorrected fuv lf ( where the departures from schechter are relatively small , but not negligible ) and to the dust - corrected fuv lf ( where departures are severe ) .",
    "since the _ galex _ sample is similar to an sfr - limited sample as it is @xmath106 limited , we try both the extended schechter function ( = power - law + srsic ) and the saunders function ( = power - law + gaussian ) .",
    "we find that both functions represent good fits to both the uncorrected and the dust - corrected fuv lfs , but that the saunders function is somewhat better ( @xmath44 of 0.5 and 1.9 for the uncorrected and corrected lf , respectively , vs.@xmath44 of 0.8 and 4.5 for the extended schechter fit ) .",
    "we show the best saunders fits as green curves in figure [ fig : fuv_lf ] ( lower panel ) .",
    "note that the high - end tail of the uncorrected lf is now well fit .",
    "the parameters of the best saunders fit are :    @xmath107    for uncorrected fuv lf , and :    @xmath108    for the dust - corrected one .",
    "we now return to the apparent puzzle of why the _ uncorrected _ fuv lf is reasonably well fit with a schechter function ( left red curve in figure [ fig : fuv_lf ] ( upper panel ) ) when our analysis has shown that the schechter function should be an appropriate description for quantities that are proportional to the _ mass _ and have small scatter with respect to it ( for example , the optical or the near - ir luminosity ) , which uv luminosity is not . here",
    "we show that this near match is a coincidence arising from two effects that approximately cancel out  sub - linearity of the fuv luminosity ",
    "mass relation and the scatter in that relation .",
    "the dust correction is on average larger in more massive star - forming galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , therefore the slope between fuv luminosity _ not _ corrected for dust and the stellar mass will be even lower ( less linear ) than between the sfr ( i.e. , dust - corrected fuv luminosity ) and mass .",
    "indeed , we determine this slope to be @xmath109 ( while it was @xmath25 for sfr , i.e. dust - corrected fuv luminosity , eqn.[eqn : sfr_mass ] ) . based on this fact alone the schechter function should be expected to be an even worse description for the uncorrected fuv lf .",
    "we show this in figure [ fig : fuv_nc_coin ] .",
    "the dashed line shows how the lf would look if fuv luminosity was linearly related to mass , without any scatter .",
    "this is simply a schechter function .",
    "however , the actual dependency is sub - linear with @xmath109 .",
    "such lf , but still with no scatter in l(fuv ) vs.  mass , is shown as a dotted curve .",
    "it is much steeper at the bright end than the schechter function , and the high - end tail is shifted to the left .",
    "however , we also need to take into account the _ scatter _ of l(fuv ) at a given mass .",
    "therefore , we convolve the dotted curve with a gaussian with @xmath110 mag to obtain the final lf ( solid line ) . convolution has the effect of making the tail shallower again , which _ coincidentally _ yields a distribution that resembles the schechter function .",
    "the differences are relatively subtle : the slightly more shallow high - end tail and somewhat less steep faint - end slope , and will be easily masked in lfs based on up to few thousand galaxies . as we have seen these differences can be revealed with lfs constructed from an order of magnitude larger samples ( figure [ fig : fuv_lf ] ( upper panel ) ) .",
    "this approximate cancelation of sub - linearity and scatter happens to hold only for uncorrected luminosity . since the dust - corrected fuv luminosity is less sub - linear with respect to the stellar mass the dotted line shifts less to the left .",
    "when scatter is added to it , it moves the lf more to the right and with the shallower slope than that of the schechter function ( figure [ fig : fuv_dc_coin ] ) , yielding what can be considered a true sfrf and which is well described by saunders function .",
    "all of the considerations laid out regarding the uv lfs are also applicable to h@xmath0  lfs .",
    "this is because the h@xmath0  luminosities also require significant dust corrections to be representative of the true sfrs .",
    "ultimately , the uncorrected h@xmath0  lf is again only approximately and coincidentally described by a schechter function .",
    "accurate h@xmath0lfs do show deviations .",
    "this has been noted by @xcite for both h@xmath0  and [ oii ] lfs from sdss spectra ( @xmath23 ) and by @xcite in their @xmath111 [ oii ] lf from deep2 spectra .",
    "these studies instead fit a double power law ( broken line on a log - log plot ) to the observed emission - line lfs .",
    "the dust - corrected lfs would show even stronger departures from the schechter form if the dust attenuation is determined for each galaxy individually . in either case a function such as the saunders or the extended schechter would provide an optimal description .",
    "pa@xmath0 is emitted in the near - ir so it requires very little dust correction @xcite .",
    "we anticipate that once pa@xmath0 lfs are constructed , they will depart significantly from the schechter form and will feature a gaussian or a srsic high - end tail instead .",
    "the inadequacy of the schechter formulation for describing ir lfs was noticed already in the mid-80s based on _ iras _ 60 @xmath61 m data .",
    "thus , @xcite proposed a double power - law fit ( i.e. , the exponential cut off of the schechter function was replaced by a less steep power law ) , while @xcite , using an order of magnitude larger sample ( 2800 vs.  300 ) , noticed the curved high - end tail of the 60 @xmath61 m lf so instead recommended the combination of a power law for the low end and the gaussian for the high end , which we refer to as the saunders function ( eqn .",
    "[ eqn : saund ] ) . , which saunders function is not .",

    "the two forms can be rather similar , and distinguishing between them requires very accurate lfs .",
    "the situation appears to be similar for the mid - ir lfs .",

    "iso _ 15 @xmath61 m measurements from iso @xcite and",
    "@xcite also obtained lfs with shallow high - end tails that would be incompatible with a schechter distribution .",
    "given these results it comes as a surprise that @xcite found that the high end of the @xmath114 m lf is rather steep and is well fit by a schechter function .",
    "they find that this is the case even after they subtract the stellar continuum contribution , i.e. , when the resulting @xmath114 m emission comes primarily from pah line emission , which is considered to be a tracer of young populations and therefore of sf @xcite .",
    "@xcite explicitly point out that their results are in contrast with @xcite 60 @xmath61 m lf that has excess counts above schechter function .",
    "they also point out that this agreement with schechter function can not be explained by their removal of galaxies harboring agn .",
    "namely , dust - obscured agns could heat the surrounding dust to relatively high temperatures , resulting in the ir sed component that peaks in the mid - ir @xcite .",
    "@xcite offer no explanation for the puzzling inconsistency between their 8 @xmath61 m pah lf and lfs at longer ir wavelengths .",
    "we suggest that the reason behind this is because the pah emission is perhaps not a good tracer of the _ current _ sf .",
    "namely , there are indications that the pahs exist outside of hii regions where they are heated by the general interstellar radiation field produced by _ older _ stars @xcite . by tracing intermediate age ( @xmath115 gyr ) or",
    "older stellar populations pah luminosity immediately becomes more closely related to the _ stellar mass _ and less so to the current sf , and thus pah luminosity function can be expected to more closely follow the mf and therefore the schechter distribution . in other words ,",
    "pah lf is perhaps not a true sfrf .",
    "the curious fact that some lfs of sfr type ( primarily uv and h@xmath0  lfs ) are schechter - like , which we now explain to be unrelated to the schechter form of lfs of mass type , and the consequent uncertainties as to the true shape of sfrf left a vacuum that some recent studies try to fill by proposing that the ir lf function is intrinsically also of schechter form , but that some effect not related to sf makes the tail assume shallower non - schechter slope .",
    "these studies find a culprit among the dust - obscured agn , which , as mentioned , can affect the ir sed , especially in the mid ir . if correct , such explanation would disagree with our conclusion ( and the view of many previous ir studies , e.g. , @xcite ) that the ir lf , to the extent that it measures current sf , and correspondingly the sfrfs , are intrinsically not of schechter form .",
    "we first discuss the evidence for agn contamination in the mid ir ( where it is expected to be stronger ) and then the far ir ( which also dominates the total ir luminosity ) . to test the agn contamination hypothesis one needs to remove the agn contribution to the ir luminosities and construct sf - only ir lf .",
    "@xcite used _",
    "irs spectra of @xmath116 galaxies to construct lfs at 8 and 15 @xmath61 m rest - frame .",
    "mid - ir spectroscopy allowed them to decompose sf and agn components on a galaxy by galaxy basis ( at least for the galaxies in the bright tail ) .",
    "agns were found to dominate at the highest 8 and 15 @xmath61 m luminosities . after removing their contribution",
    "they find that the resulting lfs are well fit by schechter functions .",
    "we note that @xcite probe lfs with good precision over only 1 dex of luminosities , so the shapes of the resulting lfs are not well determined . following in the footsteps of @xcite , @xcite use mid - ir spectra to decompose star - forming and agn contributions at rest frame 15 and 24 @xmath117 for a more local sample ( @xmath118 ) .",
    "they confirm that after correcting for agn contribution the 15 and 24 @xmath117 lfs become formally consistent with the schechter functions , however , we notice that their data do not probe the high end sufficiently well to rule out non - schechter distribution .",
    "lf can be fitted by either schechter or saunders functions .",
    "unfortunately , one lf point that could help understand what happens at the high end was omitted from their sf lf in fig .",
    "interestingly , @xcite who instead of decomposing the agn contributions completely exclude them find much smaller difference between the total and sf - only 24 @xmath117 lfs .",
    "consequently , they fit both with double power laws and do not consider schechter function at all . to conclude , there is tentative evidence that after the agn correction the mid - ir lf is schechter - like .",
    "this possible agreement of the mid - ir lfs with the schechter distribution could be explained if the mid - ir continuum does not truly trace the current sfr .",
    "indeed , @xcite present a model in which most of the mid - ir emission is produced by carbon agb stars with ages between 0.2 and 2 gyr , i.e. , while @xcite find that the @xmath119 luminosity is more tightly correlated with the optical @xmath120-band luminosity , where intermediate age stars dominate , than it is with the dust - corrected fuv luminosity of young stars .",
    "significant contribution of low mass stars in the heating of mid - ir dust would make it be more strongly correlated with the cumulative sf and therefore the stellar mass , than to the current sf .",
    "consequently , the mid - ir lfs may be of mass function type and thus be better described by schechter functions .",
    "agn contribution can be accessed relatively directly in the mid - ir where the agn sed peaks , but it is more uncertain in the far and the total ir .",
    "@xcite , extrapolating from their 24 @xmath117 results , find that the agn contribution to the total ir luminosity is only 10 to 20% ( out to@xmath121 ) , yet some studies attempt to correct for agn contribution in the total ir luminosity .",
    "this can be done in two ways .",
    "one is to keep all galaxies but remove fraction of ir luminosity believed to come from an agn , and the other , more crude method is to remove galaxies showing signs of agn from the lf altogether . the ir lf constructed using former method is equivalent to the sfrf , while the latter will be a lower limit to the true sfrf .",
    "the recent example of the ir lf that completely removes galaxies with agns is the one presented in @xcite , derived from _",
    "akari _ data .",
    "@xcite show full ir lf alongside one that removes agns based on the _ number _ fractions of optically identified agns in each ir luminosity bin from @xcite .",
    "@xcite agn number fraction is a steeply rising function of ir luminosity .",
    "thus the @xcite lf of non - agn galaxies has a steeper bright end than the full lf , but still not so steep to make the authors consider fitting the schechter function instead of the double power law .",
    "we confirm this by performing the fits ourselves on @xcite lfs .",
    "schechter functions yield very poor fit for either the total or just the non - agn lf ( @xmath122 and 11 respectively ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the saunders functions produce excellent fits with @xmath123 and 0.7 for the total and non - agn lfs respectively .",
    "since the non - agn lf is only the lower limit to the real sf ir lf , the latter also can not be a schechter function .",
    "the conclusion that the agns are not responsible for the non - schechter form of ir lf is also in line with the exquisite lf at 60 @xmath61 m from _ iras _ data .",
    "@xcite show that the 60 @xmath61 m lf does ha an excess at @xmath124 , but this excess is only @xmath41 dex in @xmath125 and lies above the _",
    "saunders _ fit and not just above a putative steep schechter high - end slope .",
    "finally , another strong observational confirmation that the true sfrf is not of schechter form comes from the lfs of radio galaxies , where the separation between agns and the star forming component can be achieved more easily than in the ir . thus , for example , @xcite show that the 1.4 ghz lf of star - forming radio galaxies is very well fit by a saunders function , but not schechter .    to summarize , while there seems to be some evidence that the _ mid _ ir lfs after correcting for agn contribution may be consistent with a schechter function , we propose that this could be the consequence of the mid - ir luminosity intrinsically tracing sf over longer timescales , and therefore being more related to the stellar mass than to the _ current _ sf . on the other hand , it appears that for either the far - ir or the total ir even with very liberal agn corrections do not produce schechter - like lfs .",
    "on the contrary , far and total ir lfs remain well described by functions that replace the exponential cutoff of schechter function with less steep functional forms , especially the gaussian ( as featured in saunders function ) , in line with the expectations from our simulations .",
    "specific sfr ( ssfr ) normalizes sfr by stellar mass of a galaxy , thus allowing us to asses its sf history and characterize it as bursty , normal or quiescent .",
    "the distribution of specific sfrs ( ssfr function ) can offer complementary insights to those offered by sfrf alone .",
    "we have already shown that at any given mass the observed sfr distribution is well described by two gaussians : one for the sf sequence and another for a broad , passive sequence .",
    "this double gaussianity is preserved when the bimodal sfr ",
    "mass relation is projected to produce a mass - limited sfr distribution .",
    "the same is true for the distribution of _ specific _ sfrs .",
    "it too can be described as the composite of two gaussians in log ( sfr/@xmath21 ) .",
    "recently , @xcite have proposed that at @xmath126 what we call the sf sequence and model as a single gaussian is in itself composed of _ two _ gaussians  one in which the majority of normal sf galaxies lie , and another one , forming a bump on the side of the main one , that contains strongly starbursting galaxies . furthermore ,",
    "@xcite present a framework in which this two - mode ssfr distribution extends to lower redshifts , and they show that it can explain the non - schechter character of the local ir lf .",
    "however , our analysis of the ssfr distribution of 40,000 @xmath23 galaxies , performed in exactly the same way , shows absolutely no indication that the sf sequence has a second , starbursting mode .",
    "most likely this mode has became negligible since @xmath126 .",
    "more importantly in the context of this study is that no second mode in the sf sequence is needed to produce an ir lf ( i.e. , sfrf ) with non - schechter form . as shown in   2.3 .",
    ", the non - schechter distribution is primarily the result of a scatter in the sfr ",
    "mass relation within the unimodal sf sequence alone .",
    "the approach in this work was to arrive at sfrfs by first modeling the sfr vs.  @xmath21 distribution .",
    "sfrf collapses the information from the bivariate sfr@xmath21 distribution .",
    "therefore , our recommendation is that all studies that report on sfrfs or lfs of sfr type should also construct a sfr ( or ssfr ) vs.  @xmath21 diagram ( even a simple scatter plot ) to aid in the interpretation of the sfrf . from such diagram",
    "one should try to determine the slope and the scatter of the sf sequence and get some sense of the fraction of galaxies on the passive sequence , as well as determine the actual mass and sfr limits . for",
    "most purposes even crude mass estimates would suffice .",
    "techniques developed for the construction of bivariate lfs @xcite can also be applied for the construction of formal bivariate sfr@xmath21 and ssfr@xmath21 distributions .",
    "the main conclusions of this study can be summarized as the following :    1 .",
    "distributions of the sfr and the stellar mass are fundamentally different .",
    "consequently , the lfs related to mass ( optical and near - ir ) will differ from dust - corrected lfs related to sf ( uv , emission line , ir ) .",
    "2 .   sfr distributions ( sfr functions ) are very poorly described by a schechter functional form , which is adequate for mass functions . instead ,",
    "sfr functions ( of sfr - limited samples ) are very well described by either an extended schechter function ( which replaces the exponential cutoff with a srsic function ) or by a saunders function ( where the high end is described by a gaussian in log sfr ) ; see figures [ fig : bim ] ( lower right panel ) and [ fig : fuv_lf ] ( lower panel ) . both feature four parameters . in several empirical cases that we tested ( our far - uv lf and ir lfs of @xcite and @xcite ) the saunders function produced somewhat better fits .",
    "saunders function has an additional advantage that its parameters are less covariant between each other and are therefore more robust to lf measurement errors .",
    "sfr functions of mass - limited samples feature a drop at the low end even for volume - complete samples .",
    "this drop should not be confused with incompleteness .",
    "the shape of sfr functions at the low end is critically sensitive to the presence of mass limits .",
    "mass - limited sfr functions are well described with double gaussians in log sfr ( figures [ fig : bim ] ( lower left panel ) and [ fig : obs ] ) .",
    "4 .   as previous studies have shown , the observed uv ( and h@xmath0 ) lfs with no dust correction ( or with average statistical dust corrections ) can approximately be described by a schechter function ( figure [ fig : fuv_lf ] ( upper panel ) ) .",
    "schechter form in them is not fundamental ( like it is in optical lfs ) but is a consequence of two effects that by chance approximately cancel each other out ( figure [ fig : fuv_nc_coin ] ) .",
    "precise lfs ( using samples with @xmath127 galaxies ) reveal that even the uncorrected uv lf deviates from schechter function .",
    "uv and h@xmath0  lfs need to be dust corrected on galaxy - by - galaxy basis and need to have at least a moderate dynamic range for departures from schechter form to be evident . these requirements are not always fulfilled in high - redshift studies , leading to apparent agreements of uv and h@xmath0 lfs with the schechter form .",
    "when properly dust corrected , uv lfs follow our mock sfrfs and are successfully described by saunders functions .",
    "lfs in the far and total ir , as well as the radio lf for star forming galaxies , behave like our mock sfrfs and are poorly fit with a schechter function even when all agns are removed .",
    "instead , they are very well fit by saunders functions . 6 .",
    "lfs in the _ mid_-ir may intrinsically be schechter - like ( after correcting for agn contribution ) , which could be the consequence of the mid - ir tracing less massive ( older ) stellar populations ; i.e. , mid - ir lfs are possibly not real sfr functions but are more closely related to stellar mass functions .",
    "therefore , schechter functions would represent an adequate description .",
    "7 .   whenever possible a bivariate sfr@xmath21 distribution should be considered alongside its projections .",
    "the recognition that optical lfs and mfs can be characterized using a functional form proposed by @xcite has provided extremely valuable guidance in the study of galaxy populations across a range of redshifts . as our estimates of sfrs have improved in recent years , having a similar tool to apply to sfr distributions",
    "will hopefully add to our understanding of galaxies and their evolution .",

    "<S> in this paper we posit that galaxy luminosity functions ( lfs ) come in two fundamentally different types depending on whether the luminosity traces galaxy stellar mass or its current star formation rate ( sfr ) . _ mass function types _ reflect the older stars and therefore the stellar mass distribution , while _ sfr function types _ arise from the young stars and hence the distribution of sfrs . </S>",
    "<S> optical and near - infrared lfs are of the mass function type , and are well fit by a schechter function ( power law with an exponential cutoff at the bright end ) . in contrast , lfs of the sfr function type are of a different form , one that can not be adequately described by a schechter function . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate this difference by generating sfr distributions for mock samples of galaxies drawn from a schechter stellar mass distribution along with established empirical relations between the sfr and stellar mass . compared with the schechter function , </S>",
    "<S> sfr distributions have a shallower decline at the bright end , which can be traced to the large intrinsic scatter of sfrs at any given stellar mass . a superior description of sfr distributions is given by the `` saunders '' function , which combines a power law with a gaussian at the high end . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the schechter - like appearance of uv and h@xmath0  lfs , although they are lfs of sfr function type , results when luminosities are not corrected for dust , or when average statistical corrections are used because individual attenuation measurements are not available . </S>",
    "<S> we thus infer that the non - schechter form of the far - ir lfs is a true reflection of the underlying sfr distribution , rather than the purported artifact of agn contamination . </S>"
