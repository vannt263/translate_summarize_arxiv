    "recently , economists and traffic scientists have wondered , whether traffic dynamics has also implications for the stability and management of supply chains @xcite or for the dynamics of business cycles @xcite .",
    "to explain business cycles , many theoretical concepts have been suggested over the decades , such as the schumpeter clock @xcite .",

    "they have transferred a continuous macroscopic traffic model and re - interpreted the single terms and variables .",
    "the author believes that this is a very promising approach to understand business cycles , but instead of simply transferring macroscopic traffic models , suggests to derive equations for business cycles from first principles , which means to derive the dynamics on the macroscopic level from microscopic interactions in production systems .",

    "these equations behave linearly unstable with respect to perturbations of @xmath5 , if @xmath60 exceeds a certain threshold ( see fig .",

    "the repeatedly or periodically resulting high inventories are due to temporary bottlenecks in the supply chain and could be avoided by appropriate control functions @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "note that , instead of unstable production with high inventories and low production speeds , one may reach the same average , but stable throughput at low inventories and high production speeds ( see fig .  [ fig5 ] ) . however , this is normally related with higher energy and maintainance costs , so that production tends to operate in the linearly unstable regime",
    ".    if the transport capacities are not a limiting factor ( i.e. the parameters @xmath45 are large ) , instead of ( [ eq2 ] ) we have the set of equations @xmath64 together with ( [ eq0 ] ) , this basically corresponds to a particular microscopic traffic model , the so - called optimal velocity model @xcite , if we restrict our comparison to the linear regime around the steady state and identify @xmath65 with the actual velocity of vehicle @xmath3 , but @xmath66 with the inverse distance to the next car ahead ( apart from proportionality constants ) .",
    "it is known @xcite that this model is linearly unstable , if @xmath67 i.e. if the adaptation time @xmath60 exceeds a certain threshold which depends on the slope @xmath68 of @xmath69 .",
    "the most interesting point is the reaction of the system to a perturbation in the throughputs @xmath9 , for example a periodic perturbation of the so - called consumption rate @xmath70 ( see secs .",
    "[ sec3 ] and [ sec3d ] ) .",
    "the resulting oscillations in the inventories can be much slower and are usually synchronized among different production sectors ( see figs .",

    "the reduction in the resulting oscillation frequency compared with the perturbation frequency is also known from stop - and - go traffic .",
    "it has been explained by the non - linearity in the model equations .",
    "however , there is a significant difference between the dynamics of traffic flows and supply chains : while stop - and - go waves have a characteristic amplitude independently of the average vehicle density , the amplitude of oscillations in the inventories change continuously in the capacity - constrained case ( see fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) . in other words",
    ", the phase transition from stable to unstable traffic flow is hysteretic ( i.e. , of first order ) @xcite , while the phase transition from stable to unstable supply chains in the capacity - constrained case appears to be continuous ( i.e. , of second order ) .",
    "this seems to be a particular property of the hilliges - weidlich model , while the optimal - velocity model mentioned in sec .",
    "[ bull ] is known to display a hysteretic transition @xcite .",
    "therefore , a hysteretic transition is found for supply chains which are not contrained by their transport capacities .",
    "the transition between these two different regimes would be interesting to investigate .",
    "note that , in order to find the emergence of slow oscillations , i.e. of business cycles , we do not need to have a linear supply chain .",
    "supply networks can display similar features ( see sec .",
    "[ topo ] ) .",
    "the only requirement is that no stationary state exists or the stationary state is linearly unstable with respect to perturbations .",
    "this is intensively studied for particular network types in a recent scientific collaboration @xcite .",
    "summarizing our present insights , preconditions for the emergence of business cycles are    * large values of the adaptation times @xmath33 , * significant changes of the production speeds @xmath71 with changing inventories , * the presence of perturbations , if a steady system state exists , * no consideration of forecasts or poor forecasts of the future time development of the inventories @xmath5 , * a highly non - linear interaction among the production sectors .",
    "we should finally underline that the above considerations can be applied to economic systems with any number of sectors and any network structure .",
    "we do not even need to assume a sectorally structured economy , as the same kinds of equations apply on the `` microscopic '' level of production networks , only with a significantly higher number of equations ( see sec .  [ sec2 ] ) .",
    "the special cases discussed above have been chosen only for illustrative reasons .",
    "in this section , we will formulate a generalized model for the dynamical interaction of production processes . compared to the description of interacting economic sectors in the previous section",
    ", this approach may be called microscopic .",
    "note that the concept developed in this section is required for two reasons : first in order to be able to describe real production processes , which involves buffers and other variables and calls for a more complex model .",
    "second in order to allow the derivation of the macroeconomic dynamics from microeconomic assumptions regarding the production management of single companies ( see sec .",

    "these specifications guarantee that , for @xmath316 , i.e. if the production units are characterized by identical parameters , _ the dynamics of the inventories is the same for all three discussed network topologies _ ( see fig .  [ fig9 ] )",
    ". however , the topology matters a lot , if we have a heterogeneity @xmath317 in the model parameters ( see figs .  [ fig10]e  f ) .",
    "as our dynamical model of supply networks assumes non - linear interactions , changes of @xmath297 can have large effects .",
    "the same applies to small changes in @xmath318 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) or in the relaxation times @xmath33 ( see fig .  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "in this contribution , we have sketched a dynamical theory of supply networks . here , we could only present first results and indicate possible future research directions , which may contribute to the interdisciplinary field of econophysics @xcite .",
    "the proposed theory is developed to help understand the complex non - linear phenomena in production and supply networks , in particular their breakdowns , instabilities and inefficiencies .",
    "we have also sketched how to derive `` macroscopic '' equations for the dynamics of a sectorally structured economics from `` microscopic '' equations describing single production processes , involving strategical decisions of production managers reflected by the control functions @xmath168 .",
    "the resulting model is a dynamical generalization of the classical input - output model of macroeconomics . for the particular case of a linear supply chain",
    ", one can relate it with the hilliges - weidlich model , which has originally been developed for traffic flow .",
    "these equations can describe the `` bullwhip effect '' due to their linear instability in a certain regime of operation .",
    "the underlying mechanism is the slow adaptation of the processing rate to changes in the order flows or stock levels in the market .",
    "interestingly , the resulting oscillations in the inventories of the different products @xmath128 have a characteristic frequency , which can be much lower than the underlying fast variations in the consumption rate . depending on the network structure ,",
    "these oscillations synchronize among different economic sectors and may explain business cycles as a self - organized phenomenon with slow dynamics .",
    "these conclusions are not restricted to linear supply chains , but can be generalized to many other supply networks , which are linearly unstable with respect to perturbations . in reality ,",
    "business cycles are , of course , less regular and of smaller amplitudes than in figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] or [ fig9 ] .",
    "however , the above model allows to reflect these aspects in a natural way by inclusion of fluctuations , heterogeneity , additional capacity constraints , and realistic network structures .",
    "investigations with empirical data and for particular kinds of networks are on the way .",
    "it should also be noted that already deterministic models of supply networks can show irregular , non - periodic behavior such as chaotic dynamics @xcite , which calls for suitable control concepts @xcite .",
    "compared to traffic dynamics , economic and production systems have some interesting new features : instead of a continuous space , we have discrete production units , and the production speed as a function of the inventories is different from the empirical velocity - density relation in traffic . due to the minimum condition ( [ mini ] )",
    ", production systems may operate in different regimes , and small changes of parameters may have tremendous effects .",
    "for example , we may have a transition from small oscillations of relatively high frequency to large oscillations of low frequency .",
    "apart from this , the management strategies can vary to a large extent , and with this the control functions @xmath319 . with suitable strategies ,",
    "the oscillations can be mitigated or even suppressed @xcite .",
    "moreover , production systems are frequently supply networks with complex topologies rather than linear supply chains , i.e. they have additional features compared to ( more or less ) one - dimensional freeway traffic .",
    "they are more comparable to street networks of cities .",
    "apart from some equations which were not further applied in this study , most of the proposed model equations were conservation equations , equations given by the product flows , or relations derived with stochastic concepts used in queuing theory .",
    "they reflect the transport and interaction of products , so that the physics of driven many - particle systems and of complex systems can make some significant contributions to the new multidisciplinary field of self - organization phenomena in production and supply networks .",
    "future work will have to address questions such as the relevance of the network structure for the resulting dynamics , possible control strategies , the role of the market and pricing mechanism , etc .",
    "this particularly concerns the specification of the function @xmath168 , and the equations suggested in the paragraph on delivery networks and price dynamics . here",
    ", we have already seen that the supply network s topology and the level of heterogeneity in production systems have a significant impact on the resulting dynamics : parameter changes can have tremendous effects .",
    "for example , a heterogeneity in the parameters characterizing the different production units can stabilize the production and the market considerably , while in traffic flow , heterogeneity has normally a destabilization effect .",
    "the stabilization of supply networks through heterogeneity probably could explain why the variations in economic systems appear to be less dramatic than in our simulations , but additional inefficiencies and capacity restrictions ( corresponding to finite values of @xmath86 , @xmath148 , and @xmath149 ) are probably another reason .",
    "this and the role of heterogeneity for the micro - macro link will be studied in more detail in the future .",
    "should it turn out that the micro - macro link requires a high degree of homogeneity in the parameters , it would be favourable to simulate economic dynamics based on a microscopic model of production and supply networks in the future .",
    "the tendency for globalization certainly increases the degree of homogeneity , but it also tends to generate larger oscillations in the inventories , i.e. more serious over- and underproduction . at least in some markets , there are definite signs of a development in this direction .",
    "forthcoming publications will , therefore , investigate alternative control strategies ( including forecasts ) .",
    "first results on how to decrease the instability of supply chains can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "as the variables in our dynamical model of supply and production networks are operational and measurable , the model can be tested and calibrated with empirical data . moreover ,",
    "it is flexible and easy to generalize .",
    "for this reason , it can be adapted to various applications .",
    "our approach can be related to microscopic considerations such as queueing theory or event - driven ( monte - carlo ) simulations of production processes , but , as it focusses on the average dynamics , it is numerically much more efficient and , therefore , suitable for on - line control .",
    "nevertheless , the formulas can be extended by noise terms to reflect stochastic effects .",
    "our system of coupled differential equations would then become a coupled system of stochastic differential equations ( langevin equations ) , where the noise amplitudes would be determined via relationships from queueing theory .",
    "the dynamical theory of supply chains appears to be a promising field with many research opportunities .",
    "it is not only useful for a deeper understanding of the origin and dynamics of business cycles or for the optimization of production processes and supply networks .",
    "it could also contribute to the further improvement of existing traffic control strategies in urban street networks or to the development of more robust routing algorithms for internet traffic .",
    "apart from this , the model can be viewed as a dynamic multi - player game , where the individual control functions @xmath168 reflect the strategies of the players @xmath79 in terms of quantities @xmath320 , which represent the information - feedback available to them .",
    "generalizing this idea , the above model of supply networks may serve as a basis for particular kinds of neural networks .",
