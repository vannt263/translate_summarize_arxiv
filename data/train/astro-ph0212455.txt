    "compact groups ( cgs ) are small systems of a few galaxies which are in close proximity one another .",
    "their are excellent laboratories for studying galaxy interactions and , in particular , merging processes . given their high galaxy density ( equivalent to those at the centers of rich clusters ) and small velocity dispersion ( @xmath0 ) ,",
    "cg members are expected to finally merge into one giant elliptical galaxy within a few short crossing times .    historically , cgs were of interest because of the obvious distortion of many of their member galaxies . the first systematic seek for cgs",
    "was pioneered by rose ( 1977 ) , using a surface number density contrast procedure .",
    "the most widely analysed samples are the hickson compact groups ( hcgs ) ( hickson 1982 , hickson 1997 ) , which have been selected on the basis of population , isolation ( avoiding cores of rich clusters ) and compactness .",
    "their compactness criteria involve the computation of the mean surface brightness of a group which should be lesser than a maximun limit .",
    "this mean was calculated distributing the flux of the member galaxies over the circular area containing their geometric centers .",
    "previous samples have been visually selected , and thus reflect some of the systematic biases intrinsic to bidimensional identification of systems . a geometric bias",
    "arise because prolate systems along the line of sight will be preferentially selected .",
    "a kinematic bias could enhance the selection of systems which are in a transient compact configuration due to galaxy internal motions .",
    "mamon ( 1986 ) has suggested that about half of hcgs are superpositions of galaxies within loose groups ( hereafter lgs ) .",
    "this suggestion could imply that groups properties in any particular sample may be strongly influenced by the criteria used to define the sample .",
    "another important clue in order to test the compact groups environment is the color of their galaxy members .",
    "it is well known that elliptical galaxies recently formed from mergers of spiral galaxies should be bluer than normal elliptical galaxies .",
    "this kind of interactions should be more frecuently observed in a compact group environment .",
    "nervertheless , a study on galaxy members of hcgs made by zepf , whitmore & levinson ( 1991 ) have show that most of the early - type galaxies have optical colors indistinguishable form those of elliptical galaxies in other environments .",
    "furthermore , there is evidence of a strange absence of strong signs of interactions , strong radio sources or far infrared radiation emission , etc . (",
    "menon 1995 , pildis , bregman & schombert 1995 , sulentic 1997 ) .",
    "recently , tovmassian , yam & tiersch ( 2001 ) and tovmassian ( 2001 ) presents new evidence that indicates that almost all hcgs are dynamically associated generally with elongated lgs which are distributed along the elongation of the corresponding groups , suggesting that the hcgs are the compact cores of the latter .",
    "consequently , an important question about the real nature of cgs arise : are cgs a distinct class by themselves or are extreme examples of systems having a particular range of galaxy density and population .",
    "this question can be addressed studying the spatial distribution and environment of cgs .",
    "however , estimating the velocity dispersion and physical separations of galaxies in groups with a small number of galaxies is highly uncertain .",
    "meaningful conclusions on dynamical properties about systems containing only four or five galaxies requires statistical analysis of large homogeneous samples .",
    "= 0.5    = 0.5    = 0.5    in order to overcome these biases , it has recently become feasible to find cgs using automatic identification .",
    "such a procedure has the advantage of generate a sample that is homogeneous and complete within the criteria specified for the search .",
    "barton et al .",
    "( 1996 ) have used a selection criteria ( friends - of - friends algorithm ) based only on physical extent and association in redshift space .",
    "eventhough hickson s isolation criteria is not present at all in barton s work , this technique is more effective in finding groups in regions of higher galaxy density because foreground and background galaxies are automatically eliminated by the velocity selection criteria .",
    "other automatic algorithm for the selection of cgs from large galaxy catalogues has been developed by iovino et al .",
    "the algorithm is such as to maximize the probability that the groups selected are physically related and partially reproduces the criteria used in the visual search by hickson ( 1982 ) , where his isolation criteria is slightly relaxed .",
    "+ since it is very difficult to identify compact groups at high redshifts , more reliable results can be obtained restricting the analysis to low redshift samples . under this constraint applied on the updated zwicky catalogue , focardi & kelm ( 2002 )",
    "have shown that triplets are characterized by different properties than that obtained for higher order compact groups suggesting the existence of two different galaxy systems in the compact group samples .",
    "it is therefore of great interest to obtain larger and deeper samples of cgs , in order to put the cgs properties on a statistical basis .",
    "this will help to work out the controversy around the properties of cgs , contradictions that may only be apparent , given our still limited knowledge of the nature of these structures .",
    "currently , one of the largest group catalogues ( hereafter 2dfggc ) was constructed by merchn & zandivarez ( 2002 ) .",
    "they have identified groups in the 2df public 100k data release using a modified huchra & geller ( 1982 ) group finding algorithm that takes into account 2df magnitude limit and redshift completeness masks .",
    "this catalogue constitutes a large and suitable sample for the study of both , processes in group environments and the properties of the group population itself .",
    "the global effects of group environment on star formation was analysed by martnez et al ( 2002a ) using this catalogue .",
    "domnguez et al ( 2002 ) presented hints toward understanding local environment effects on the spectral types of galaxies in groups by studying the relative fractions of different spectral types as a function of the projected local galaxy density and the group - centric distance .",
    "recently , an extensive statistical analysis on galaxy luminosity function in groups was carried out by martnez et al ( 2002b ) .",
    "the aim of this work is to perform an analysis on the groups in the 2dfggc by defining new compactness indexes which are assigned to every group in the sample .",
    "several studies have been made using galaxy spectral type , velocity dispersion , luminosity and crossing time as a function of the compactness indexes .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    ", we present the 2df galaxy group catalogue ( 2dfggc ) used throughout this work .",
    "section 3 describes the compactness indexes definitions while in section 4 we analyse the possible dependence of our indexes with group and galaxy properties .",
    "finally , in section 5 we summarize our conclusions .",
    "samples of galaxies and groups used in this work are the same used by martnez et al .",
    "( 2002b ) which were constructed taking into account a revised version of the masks and mask software of the 2dfgrs 100k data release , which includes the @xmath1-masks described in colless et al .",
    "the group catalogue is obtained following the same procedure as described by merchn & zandivarez ( 2002 ) .",
    "the finder algorithm used for group identification is similar to that developed by huchra & geller ( 1982 ) but modified in order to take into account redshift completeness , magnitude limit and the magnitude completeness mask ( @xmath1-mask ) present on the current release of galaxies .",
    "the revised group catalogue comprises a total number of 2198 galaxy groups with at least 4 members and mean radial velocities in the range @xmath2 .",
    "these groups have a mean velocity dispersion of @xmath3 , a mean virial mass of @xmath4 and a mean virial radius of @xmath5 . throughout this work we adopted the cosmological model @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "= 0.5    = 0.5",
    "the selection criteria used by merchn & zandivarez ( 2002 ) based on adaptable linking length parameters allow the identification of galaxy systems independently of compactness . we propose two quantities which measure the level of compactness for groups in the 2dfggc .",
    "= 0.7    these quantities are based on geometrical criteria and their application upon a group catalogue identified in redshift space provides a sample which is not constrained by the usual compactness selection criteria .",
    "the first index is defined using the mean nearest projected neighbour separation of galaxies in groups @xmath8 .",
    "this quantity is normalized to the mean of @xmath8 for groups in a given bin of redshift @xmath9 where the size of the redshift bin is @xmath10 .",
    "this normalization is important in order to avoid a redshift dependence of this parameter since we are working with a magnitude limited sample ; thus the mean nearest projected neighbour separation increases its value with redshift ( see upper panel of figure [ fig0 ] ) . nevertheless , this ratio is not enough to characterize the compactness of a group .",
    "for instance , a group formed by a set of binaries separated one another by large distances would have a small value of @xmath8 ( see example ( a ) of figure [ fig00 ] ) .",
    "attempting to improve our definition we introduce a virial radius @xmath11 dependence .",
    "this parameter is also conveniently normalized to the redshift dependent mean virial radius @xmath12 .",
    "median values , for redshift bin , of @xmath11 as a function of @xmath13 are shown in the lower panel of figure [ fig0 ] .",
    "consequently , the compactness index is defined by @xmath14 in figure [ fig1 ] we observe the distribution of both parameters involved in the @xmath15 definition .",
    "upper and lower right panels show the normalized distributions of each ratio .",
    "the similarity of both distributions implies that neither of them is the dominant term in the compactness index definition .",
    "upper left panel of figure [ fig1 ] shows the scatter plot for the two ratios , indicating the importance of using both parameters to define the compactness index .",
    "the @xmath15 distribution is plotted in the lower left panel of this figure .",
    "the groups related with a high level of compactness have the lowest values of @xmath15 , whereas very loose groups belong to the tail of the distribution .",
    "= 1.0    as stated above our compactness definition avoids any redshift dependence .",
    "this fact is shown in figure [ fig2 ] ( lower panel ) where an uniform distribution is observed for the scatter plot of @xmath15 versus @xmath13 .",
    "given the status of the current release of the 2df galaxy redshift survey , it should be taken into account a possible dependence of @xmath15 on the level of completeness of each group in the parent catalogue ( @xmath16 ) . in the upper panel of figure [ fig2 ]",
    "we display the scatter plot of @xmath16 vs @xmath15 .",
    "this plot shows a total lack of correlation between the compactness index and the redshift completeness of groups .",
    "moreover , most of the groups show a high level of completeness which provides confidence to our study .    as mentioned in section 1",
    ", finding compact groups within loose groups is a possible scenario . in order to take into account this possibility",
    ", we define a new index which is able to identify this particularity . the second index measures the ratio of the number of galaxies enclosed in @xmath17 to those within @xmath11 ( see example ( b ) of figure [ fig00 ] ) .",
    "as before , this ratio is a measure of the core concentration regardless of the size of the system .",
    "consequently , and keeping in mind that higher ratios imply higher central concentration in groups , we divide this parameter by the normalized virial ratio defined for index @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , the second compactness index is @xmath18    a similar analysis as the one made for @xmath15 shows that the second compactness index @xmath19 depends neither on redshift nor on parent catalogue completeness ( figure [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , upper panel of figure [ fig3 ] shows that most groups with high level of compactness ( @xmath20 ) have the highest level of completeness . to study a possible correlation between both indexes we show in figure [ fig4 ] the scatter plot of @xmath15 versus @xmath19 . from this plot",
    "we observe that the groups in the lower left corner have a high level of compactness for @xmath15 whereas qualify as loose groups according to @xmath19 .",
    "two examples of groups with 6 and 8 galaxy members are shown in the inset right plots of figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "none of the examples shows a core concentration which implies a low @xmath19 value , while the small mean nearest neighbour separations of galaxies are the main responsible for the low values of @xmath15 .",
    "these facts imply that a group with a high level of compactness for @xmath19 is also compact for @xmath15 . on the other hand small values for",
    "@xmath15 do not guarantee high values of @xmath19 .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath15 is a better discriminator of non central galaxy concentrations within a group . in the inset left plot of figure [ fig4 ]",
    "we show the scatter plot of the compactness indexes without the normalized virial radius observing that the particular envelope in the main figure is due to this ratio .    as an example of groups characterized by a high level of compactness for both indexes we show in figure [ fig5 ] four of these systems .",
    "the left panels show the projection of galaxy members on the sky , where the physical distances are referred to the center of mass of the system .",
    "these projections can be directly correlated with the optical images shown in right panels .",
    "central panels display the declination - radial velocity projection of groups .",
    "previous plots show that the observed galaxy members are restricted to a small range in redshift space ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "= 0.5    = 0.5    in the following analysis we study group and galaxy properties for group subsamples defined by their compactness indexes .",
    "we have chosen the following criteria :    * high level of compactness : @xmath23 or @xmath24 * low level of compactness : @xmath25 or @xmath26 .",
    "obtaining @xmath27 and @xmath28 groups with high level of compactness meanwhile the low level of compactness samples comprise @xmath29 and @xmath30 groups respectively .",
    "these limits were chosen to deal with the tails of the compactness index distributions while keeping an amount of groups large enough to obtain a reliable statistics .",
    "the redshift distributions of groups with low and high level of compactness for both indexes are plotted in upper and central panels of figure [ fig60 ] .",
    "we observe quite similar redshift distributions for high and low level of compactness irrespectively of the index used in the selection .",
    "we look for any possible relation linking compactness indexes @xmath15 and @xmath19 , group velocity dispersion and group member richness .",
    "in analysing radial velocity dispersion dependence we split the group sample in two subsamples with @xmath31 and @xmath32 obtaining roughly the same number of groups in both subsamples .",
    "the obtained normalized continuous distributions for @xmath15 and @xmath19 are plotted in the upper panels of figure [ fig6 ] . from these plots we observe that velocity dispersion does not discriminate levels of compactness of groups in the 2dfggc .",
    "the velocity dispersion limit is not a critical issue , we have obtained the same results varying the adopted cut - off from @xmath33 to @xmath34 .",
    "we use a similar criteria to analyse a possible dependence of group galaxy members on compactness . in this case , we split the group sample in two subsamples with @xmath35 and @xmath36 and plot the normalized distributions in the lower panels of figure [ fig6 ] .",
    "both distributions show that groups with high level of compactness have typically a small number of members . from our analysis",
    "it is not clear whether this is a consequence of our definitions of compactness or a real physical phenomena .",
    "these results are not biased by any possible redshift dependence as can be observed in the lower panel of figure [ fig60 ] , where we plot the redshift distribution of the subsamples defined by @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "we also observe that when increasing the galaxy member limit @xmath37 , the results hold .",
    "nevertheless by doing so the richer group sample becomes statistically poor .",
    "= 0.5    as a complementary test , and using the samples defined at the beginning of this section , we plot the measured radial velocity dispersion distributions .",
    "these distributions are shown in figure [ fig7 ] where continuous line corresponds to the sample with high level of compactness while dashed line refers to the loose group sample .",
    "it can be seen that the normalized distributions ( in both panels ) are quite similar showing a mean radial velocity dispersion of @xmath0 .",
    "this result is in agreement with the previously obtained by hickson ( 1997 ) , where characteristic velocity dispersion of compact groups is quite similar to that obtained for loose ones .",
    "this agreement is not obvious since our definition of compactness is very different to the one defined by hickson .",
    "the following analysis is performed using the classification of galaxies defined by madgwick et al .",
    "( 2002 ) according to their spectral type .",
    "this classification is based on the @xmath38 parameter which is very tightly correlated with the equivalent width of @xmath39 emission line , correlates well with morphology and can be interpreted as a measure of the relative current star - formation present in each galaxy .",
    "the four spectral types are defined as :    * type 1 : @xmath40 , * type 2 : @xmath41 , * type 3 : @xmath42 , * type 4 : @xmath43 .",
    "the type 1 class is characterised by an old stellar population and strong absorption features , the types 2 and 3 comprise spiral galaxies with increasing star formation , finally the type 4 class is dominated by particularly active galaxies such as starburst .    recently , using the 2dfggc , martnez et al .",
    "( 2002a ) obtained a strong correlation between the relative fraction of galaxies with high star formation ( type 4 ) and the parent group virial mass .",
    "they found that even in the environment of groups with low virial masses ( @xmath44 ) the star formation of their member galaxies is significantly suppressed .",
    "another study with relative fraction of galaxy spectral types in the 2dfggc was performed by domnguez et al .",
    "they found a clear distinction between high virial mass groups ( @xmath45 ) and the less massive ones .",
    "while the massive groups show a significant dependence of the relative fraction of low star formation galaxies on local galaxy density and group - centric radius , groups with lower masses show no significant trends .",
    "= 0.5    = 0.5    following the study on possible dependences of the galaxy spectral type fractions on the environment , we study here the behaviour of this fractions as a function of the previously defined compactness indexes @xmath15 and @xmath19 . in figure [ fig8 ] and [ fig9 ] we display galaxy fractions per spectral type as a function of @xmath15 and @xmath19 .",
    "error bars were estimated by the bootstrap resampling technique .",
    "no statistically significant trends of the fraction of spectral types on the compactness are appreciated .",
    "a possible influence of compactness on the luminosity of galaxies could be studied using the luminosity functions ( lf ) of galaxies in groups by defining two subsamples according to the level of compactness .",
    "the high level of compactness samples is defined by @xmath46 , @xmath47 , whereas the loose samples comprise groups with @xmath48 , @xmath49 .",
    "these limits are chosen in order to obtain samples with a large number of galaxies suitable for our computation .    in this work",
    "we use , the @xmath50 method ( lynden - bell 1971 ) to make a non parametric determination of the lf .",
    "this method is the best estimator to measure the lf and is the less affected by the faint end slope of a schechter parametrisation or the sample size ( willmer 1997 ) . as a comparative rule we also use the sty ( sandage , tammann & yahil 1979 ) maximum likelihood schechter fit to the lf of the whole group sample determined by martnez et al ( 2002b ) .",
    "these authors found that the corresponding best fit schechter parameters are @xmath51 and @xmath52 , which are quite consistent with the results by norberg et al .",
    "( 2001 ) for field galaxies .",
    "the adopted @xmath50 method estimator is the same as the used by martnez et al .",
    "( 2002b ) .",

    "the function @xmath54 defined as the observed density of galaxies with absolute magnitude brighter than @xmath55 , represents only an undersampling of the @xmath53 .",
    "linden - bell has defined a quantity @xmath56 as the number of galaxies brighter than @xmath55 which could have been observed if their magnitude were @xmath55 .",

    "2002 , martnez et al .",
    "2002b ) .    in figure [ fig10 ]",
    "we show the luminosity functions for galaxies in groups in arbitrary units .",
    "absolute magnitudes are computed using the @xmath63 mean correction for galaxies in the 2dfgrs as derived by norberg et al .",
    "error bars are estimated using 10 mock catalogues constructed from numerical simulations of a cold dark matter universe according to the cosmological model adopted in this work with a hubble constant @xmath64 and a relative mass fluctuation @xmath65 . these simulations",
    "were performed using @xmath66 particles in a cubic comoving volume of @xmath67 per side . in the left panel of figure [ fig10 ] ,",
    "filled circles correspond to the lf of galaxies in groups with high level of compactness using @xmath15 , while the open circles represent the lf for the very loose groups with the same index .",

    "we observe that the resulting lf s are insensitive to the level of compactness of groups when comparing with the whole sample .",
    "= 0.5      in order to consider a possible level of dynamical evolution of galaxy systems we compute the dimensionless crossing time as used by hickson et al .",
    "this particular timescale , @xmath70 , is the ratio of the crossing time to the approximate age of the universe , and is defined by @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the mean projected galaxy separation in groups and @xmath73 is the 3-dimensional velocity dispersion ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "the dimensionless crossing time may reflect dynamical evolution since its inverse is roughly the maximun number of times that a galaxy could have traversed the group since its formation .    computing the crossing time for group having @xmath75 we obtain the range @xmath76 to @xmath77 with a mean value of @xmath78 .",
    "this value is significantly higher than the one obtained by hickson et al .",
    "their compact group sample shows typically smaller crossing time values mainly due to small values of the mean galaxy - galaxy separation @xmath72 .",
    "a possible explanation could arise from the suggestion that many compact groups could be the cores of larger ones .",
    "many studies have been carried out about this possibility ( mammon 1986 , tovmassian et al .",
    "2001 ) obtaining that most of the groups identified as compact are the central region of larger groups .",
    "this kind of misidentification could be a very important source of bias in the study of compact groups . in order to quantify this problem",
    "we compute the fraction of groups with high central concentrations within larger groups using our catalogue . seeking for groups with ratio @xmath79 in larger groups",
    "we obtain that roughly the @xmath80 of these groups are characterised by a high central concentration .",
    "consequently , this kind of bias can be the explanation for the small crossing time values obtained for hickson s sample .    finally , we intended to search for a possible dependence of the fraction of galaxies per spectral type on the dimensionless crossing time .",
    "figure [ fig12 ] shows the trends obtained for the four spectral types defined in subsection 4.2 .",
    "a slight increase of the type 4 fraction of galaxies with the @xmath70 can be observed , meanwhile an opposite trend is shown by type 2 galaxies .",
    "even when this result is not highly significant , a possible dynamical evolution is suggested .",
    "such evolution would consist in the conversion of late type galaxies to earlier ones by dynamical processes such as mergers .",
    "more significant results have been obtained by domnguez et al .",
    "( 2002 ) analysing the spectral type vs local galaxy density relation specially for subsamples of groups with high virial masses using the same catalogue .",
    "we should remark that these results are almost independent of the level of compactness of galaxy groups .",
    "a similar analysis developed for a sample of nearby compact groups by focardi & kelm ( 2002 ) have also shown signs of evolution of spectral content in the relation morphology - velocity dispersion mainly for low multiplicity compact groups ( see figure 9 in their work ) .",
    "in this work we report a statistical compactness analysis using the catalogue of galaxy groups constructed by merchn & zandivarez ( 2002 ) . given",
    "the size of the original sample and 3-dimensional information our study intend to characterize groups of galaxies according to the level of compactness and analyse its influence on groups and galaxy members . for this purpose , we define two new compactness indexes based on geometrical criteria . whereas index @xmath15 prioritizes the distance to the nearest neighbour and the size of the system ( eq .",
    "1 ) , index @xmath19 enhances a possible core concentration in the system ( eq .",
    "special cares have been taken over the construction of these indexes in order to avoid possible dependences on redshift and redshift completeness of the parent catalogue ( figures [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] ) .    with this characterization",
    ", we develop a wide analysis over many physical properties of groups and galaxy members .",
    "first , we observe that the compactness indexes distribution shows identical behaviours when the group sample is split for low ( @xmath31 ) and high ( @xmath81 ) velocity dispersion .",
    "furthermore , we observe that groups with high and low levels of compactness show the same normalized radial velocity dispersion distributions with a mean of @xmath0 .",
    "this result is consistent with previous ones which reflect that the mean velocity dispersion of compact groups is quite similar to that found for loose groups ( hickson et al .",
    "1992 ) . analysing the dependence of group compactness with numerical richness we observe that groups with high level of compactness have typically a low number of galaxy members , while most of the loose groups are characterized by a larger number of galaxy members .",
    "on the other hand , another study has been made about the fraction of galaxies per spectral type and luminosity as a function of the two compactness indexes ( figures [ fig8 ] , [ fig9 ] and [ fig10 ] ) .",
    "our results do not show any particular correlation between the above parameters and the compactness level for groups in the sample .",
    "the similar behaviour observed in groups with high level of compactness and loose ones probably suggests that this distinction is not fundamental .",
    "this result is supported by previous works which state an indistinguishable behaviour between compact and loose groups showing that many compact groups are located within overdense environments ( de carvalho et al .",
    "1997 , barton et al .",
    "1998 , zabludoff & mulchaey 1998 ) . furthermore",
    ", an analysis on x - ray properties of groups shows that it is impossible to separate loose and compact groups on the luminosity - temperature relation , the luminosity - velocity dispersion relation or in the velocity dispersion - temperature relation stating that a more useful distinction is that between x - ray bright and x - ray faint systems ( helsdon & ponman 2000 ) .",
    "the mean dimensionless crossing times obtained for a sample with high level of compactness is shifted toward higher values when comparing to the obtained for a sample of compact groups constructed by hickson et al .",
    "this shift could be due to some biases in the compact group identification criteria .",
    "these biases could imply the detection of the cores of larger systems generating smaller dimensionless crossing times determinations .",
    "the last correlation we studied is the fraction of galaxies per spectral type as a function of the dimensionless crossing time .",
    "eventhough the correlations we found are not significant , it is worth to mention that for type 2 galaxies , smaller is the fraction when higher is the dimensionless crossing time and the opposite trend is maintained for type 4 galaxies .",

    "<S> our results show that there is no clear distinction between groups with high and low level of compactness when considering particular properties as the radial velocity dispersion , the relative fraction of galaxies per spectral type and luminosity functions of their galaxy members .    </S>",
    "<S> studying the trend of the fraction of galaxies per spectral type as a function of the dimensionless crossing time some signs of dynamical evolution are observed . from the comparison with previous works on compactness </S>",
    "<S> we realize that special care should be taken into account for some compactness criteria definitions in order to avoid possible biases in the identification .    </S>",
