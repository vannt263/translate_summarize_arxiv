    "since the earliest days of cosmic - ray investigations it has been realized that these particles provide a unique possibility to study interactions at high energies @xcite . even today",
    "the energies of cosmic rays exceed the energies achieved in man made accelerators by orders of magnitude .",
    "hence , in the literature many attempts are described to extract properties of high - energy hadronic interactions from air showers induced by cosmic rays in the atmosphere . among the most interesting quantities",
    "is the attenuation length of hadrons ( e.g.  @xcite p.  162 ) , in theoretical considerations closely connected to the inelastic cross section .    in the present work ,",
    "we use the energy absorbed in a material within a certain atmospheric depth @xmath2 to define an attenuation length . in this new approach",
    "we use the number of electrons and muons , registered with a detector array to estimate the energy of the shower inducing primary particle @xmath3 , see below .",
    "the energy reaching the observation level in form of hadrons @xmath4 is measured with a hadron calorimeter .",
    "the fraction of surviving energy in form of hadrons is defined as @xmath5 the attenuation length @xmath6 is then defined as @xmath7 or @xmath8    1=2    the interaction length @xmath9 of protons in air is given as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the average atomic weight of air , @xmath12 the proton mass , and @xmath13 the inelastic proton - air cross section .",
    "the experimentally accessible attenuation length is not only sensitive to the proton - air interaction length , but also to the inelasticity of the interactions .",
    "this dependence is frequently expressed by introducing a factor @xmath14 @xcite : @xmath15 in practice , @xmath14 is also influenced by statistical fluctuations during the shower development .",
    "measurements at the cern sps , where the complete showers of hadrons with fixed energies up to 350  gev have been absorbed in a calorimeter , indicate values @xmath16 @xcite .    in the literature",
    "different definitions for the attenuation length in air showers are introduced .",
    "frequently , the attenuation length is derived from measurements of the electromagnetic shower component , e.g.@xcite .",
    "investigating single hadrons the attenuation length is related to the absorption of hadrons in the atmosphere @xcite .",
    "pioneering work to derive inelastic cross sections from the measurement of single hadrons has been conducted by yodh and colleagues @xcite , later followed by the prototype of the kascade calorimeter @xcite .",
    "the new approach presented here is complementary to the different methods described in the literature .",
    "in contrast to methods using the electromagnetic shower component , the present work focuses directly on measurements of hadrons to derive an attenuation length for this shower component .",
    "the values obtained are not a priori comparable to other attenuation lengths since they are based on different definitions .",
    "it should be noted that the experimentally obtained attenuation length is affected by statistical fluctuations during the development of the showers .",
    "however , in the present work we do not attempt to correct for this effect .",
    "after a description of the experimental situation ( ) , the experimental results and comparisons with air shower simulations are described in .",
    "the experiment kascade , located on site of the forschungszentrum karlsruhe , 110 m a.s.l . , consists of several detector systems .",
    "a description of the performance of the experiment can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "a @xmath17  m@xmath18 array of 252 detector stations , equipped with scintillation counters , measures the electromagnetic and , below a lead / iron shielding , the muonic components of air showers . in its center , an iron sampling calorimeter of @xmath19  m@xmath18 area detects hadronic particles . the calorimeter is equipped with 11 000 warm - liquid ionization chambers arranged in nine layers .",
    "due to its fine segmentation ( @xmath20  cm@xmath18 ) , energy , position , and angle of incidence can be measured for individual hadrons .",
    "a detailed description of the calorimeter and its performance can be found in @xcite , it has been calibrated with a test beam at the sps at cern up to 350  gev particle energy @xcite .",
    "the position of the shower axis and the angle of incidence of a cascade are reconstructed by the array detectors .",
    "the total numbers of electrons @xmath22 and muons @xmath23 are determined by integrating their lateral distributions . in case of muons ,",
    "the ` truncated muon number ' @xmath24 is used for experimental reasons .",
    "it is the number of muons integrated in the distance range @xmath25",
    "m from the shower axis . for",
    "a detailed description of the reconstruction algorithms see @xcite .",
    "the position of the shower axis is reconstructed with an accuracy better than 2  m and the angle of incidence better than 0.5 .",
    "the hadrons in the calorimeter are reconstructed by a pattern recognition algorithm , optimized to recognize as many hadrons in a shower core as possible .",
    "details can be found in @xcite .",
    "hadrons of equal energy can still be separated with a probability of 50% at a distance of 40  cm .",
    "the reconstruction efficiency rises from 70% at 50  gev to nearly 100% at 100  gev .",
    "the energy resolution improves from 30% at 50  gev to 15% at @xmath26  gev . the hadron number @xmath27 and hadronic energy sum @xmath28 are determined by the sum over all hadrons in a distance up to 10  m from the shower axis .",
    "a correction for the missing area beyond the boundaries of the calorimeter is applied .",
    "the hadron lateral distributions are relatively steep , the hadronic energy density decreases by about two orders of magnitude within the first 10  m from the shower axis @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is sufficient to measure hadrons in a relatively narrow range around the shower axis only in order to collect a significant fraction of the total hadron energy .",
    "the observable @xmath28 includes also energy of hadrons which could not be reconstructed independently , because they are too close to each other .",
    "it shows up in the simulated and experimental data in the same manner .    to be accepted for the present analysis , an air shower has to fulfill several requirements :",
    "at least one hadron has been reconstructed in the calorimeter with an energy larger than 50  gev , the shower axis is located inside the calorimeter , the electromagnetic shower size @xmath22 is larger than @xmath26 , the truncated muon number @xmath24 is larger than @xmath29 , i.e.  the primary energy is greater than about @xmath30  gev , and the reconstructed zenith angle is smaller than 30 . from may 1998 to october 2005",
    "312000 showers have been measured meeting the criteria mentioned .    to avoid corrections for different angles of incidence the following analysis",
    "is restricted to showers with zenith angles @xmath31 .",
    "the primary energy @xmath3 of the shower inducing particle is roughly estimated based on the number of electrons @xmath22 and muons @xmath24 registered with the kascade scintillator array @xmath32 the average ground pressure during the observation time amounts to 1004  hpa , corresponding to an average atmospheric column density @xmath33=1023  2 .",
    "the attenuation is measured at this depth @xmath33 , the average vertical thickness of the atmosphere above the kascade experiment .",
    "reaching the ground in form of hadrons as function of estimated primary energy @xmath3 for all data and for selections of light and heavy primary particles . ]",
    "the shower simulations were performed using corsika @xcite .",
    "hadronic interactions at low energies were modeled using the fluka code @xcite .",
    "high - energy interactions were treated with qgsjet01 @xcite ( @xmath34  gev ) .",
    "showers initiated by primary protons as well as helium , carbon , silicon , and iron nuclei have been simulated .",
    "the simulations covered the energy range @xmath35  gev with zenith angles in the interval @xmath36 .",
    "the energy distribution of the showers followed a power law with a spectral index of @xmath37 .",
    "for the analysis the energy distribution was converted to a power law with an index of @xmath38 below and @xmath39 above the knee with a rigidity dependent knee position ( @xmath40  gev for protons ) .",
    "the positions of the shower axes are distributed uniformly over an area exceeding the calorimeter surface by 2  m on each side . in order to determine the signals in the individual detectors , all secondary particles at ground level",
    "are passed through a detector simulation program using the geant package @xcite . in this way",
    ", the instrumental response is taken into account and the simulated events are analyzed by the same code as the experimental data , an important aspect to avoid biases by pattern recognition and reconstruction algorithms .",
    "the energy of the primary particle is estimated from measurements of the number of electrons and muons in the shower with the scintillator array , see .",
    "the surviving energy in form of hadrons @xmath41 is measured with the hadron calorimeter .",
    "a fraction @xmath42 , see of hadronic energy reaching ground level can be inferred as function of primary energy , as shown in .",
    "all error bars represent statistical uncertainties only . below @xmath0",
    "gev the values are affected by reconstruction efficiencies . in particular , showers induced by heavy elements are less likely to be registered .",
    "therefore , values are shown only for energies exceeding @xmath0  gev . above @xmath43  gev",
    "the flux of the light cosmic - ray component decreases and the composition becomes more and more heavy @xcite .",
    "mos likely , this causes the structures seen in the figure for energies exceeding @xmath43  gev . in the energy range investigated about 0.3% to 0.8% of the primary energy reaches the observation level in form of hadrons , most of them being pions @xcite .    in the energy range of interest",
    "the elasticity of pions depends only weakly on energy and can be approximated as @xmath44 to 0.3 @xcite . with the relation @xmath45",
    ", the average number of generations @xmath46 in the shower can be estimated and it turns out that the registered hadrons ( with energies above 50  gev ) have undergone about four to five interactions only .",
    "this number is confirmed by full air shower simulations .    the fraction of hadronic energy reaching observation level increases with energy , since the effect of deeper penetrating showers clearly dominates over the small effect caused by the increase of the inelastic cross sections .    .",
    "the most probable values of the distribution are indicated by the asterisks , the solid line represents a fit to this data .",
    "the dashed line represents . ]        the two - dimensional distribution of the number of electrons and muons for the measured showers is depicted in .",
    "the asterisks represent the most probable values of the distribution .",
    "also simulated @xmath47 distributions have been investigated for primary protons , as well as helium , carbon , silicon , and iron - induced showers .",
    "examples for protons and iron are depicted in .",
    "the solid lines represent fits to the most probable values represented by the circles and squares , respectively .",
    "it turned out that the slopes of the fits of all elements are about equal .",
    "the fitted line for carbon , parameterized as @xmath48 is used in the following to divide the data into a sample induced by `` light '' and `` heavy '' primary particles , respectively .",
    "it is indicated in and [ comet - sim ] as dashed lines . in it",
    "can be seen that indeed separates the data set into `` light '' and `` heavy '' .",
    "almost no iron showers are above the dashed line and only a small fraction of proton induced showers is below the line .",
    "especially the most probable values for protons and iron - induced showers are clearly above and below the dashed line , respectively .",
    "parameterization almost coincides with the most probable values of the measurements .",
    "applying the selection criterion to the data , the energy fraction reaching observation level is shown in as well for light and heavy primaries .",
    "as expected from a simple superposition model , proton - like showers penetrate deeper into the atmosphere and transport more energy to the observation level as compared to iron - like showers .              using the energy absorbed in the atmosphere at a depth @xmath33 ,",
    "the attenuation length @xmath6 has been derived from the measured energy fraction , see .",
    "the results are presented as function of the estimated primary energy in a ) .",
    "values for the complete data set as well as for the light and heavy selections are shown .",
    "the values are compared to results obtained from full air shower simulations for primary protons and iron nuclei using the corsika program with the hadronic interaction generator qgsjet01 .",
    "the cuts for a `` light '' and `` heavy '' component were applied to the proton and iron simulations in the same way as for the measurements .",
    "the values shown in have been obtained by applying the same ( quality ) cuts and reconstruction algorithms to measured and simulated data .",
    "thus , many uncertainties are expected to cancel . for the remaining differences between simulated and measured data a systematic error for the hadronic energy sum ( @xmath4 ) and the total energy ( @xmath3 ) of 10%",
    "each is assumed . with this results in a 14% uncertainty of @xmath42 . in turn , following yields a systematic error for @xmath6 of order of 2% .",
    "therefore , the values shown in have a systematic uncertainty of order of 2 to 4  2 . as discussed above",
    ", the structures above an energy of @xmath43  gev are most likely due to the chaning composition as function of energy .",
    "a comparison of the `` heavy '' selection with iron - induced showers shows that the `` heavy '' selection lies slightly above the simulated values .",
    "this makes sense , since the measured data contain a mixture of many elements , most of them being lighter than iron , thus the measurements should be above the iron points .",
    "on the other hand , looking at the `` light '' selection compared to the proton points from the simulations , one recognizes that at high energies data points are above the simulated values .",
    "this can not be explained by a mixed composition and may be a hint towards a problem in the hadronic interaction model qgsjet01 .",
    "a possible explanation is that the attenuation length is too small , i.e.  the cross section is too large .    to test this hypothesis simulations",
    "have been carried out with a modified version of qgsjet01 , namely model  3a in .",
    "the inelastic hadronic cross sections have been lowered , e.g.  the proton - air cross section at @xmath0  gev is reduced by 5% from 385  mb to 364  mb and the elasticity has been increased by about 12% . a similar trend to lower cross sections has been found as well by the eas - top experiment , with a value of @xmath49 at @xmath50  tev ( @xmath51  gev ) @xcite . at the highest energies",
    "the lower proton - air cross section ( 443  mb at @xmath52  gev ) is compatible with recent results from the hires experiment @xmath53 at @xmath54  gev @xcite .",
    "the lower cross sections have been proposed originally to reduce the discrepancy in the mean logarithmic mass derived from experiments observing shower maximum and investigating particle distributions at ground level @xcite . applying the altered version of qgsjet also slightly modifies the number of electrons and muons predicted at ground level . at energies around the knee ( @xmath55  gev )",
    "the number of electrons increases by about 5% and the number of muons rises by about 15% @xcite .",
    "the corresponding results for @xmath6 are presented in b ) .",
    "the typical energies of particles in a shower induced by a heavy nuclei are smaller than the typical energies in a proton - induced shower of the same primary energy ( superposition model of showers ) .",
    "thus , the effect of the modifications is stronger for proton - induced showers in b ) , see also @xcite .",
    "in contrast to a ) the simulated points for protons are now above the data points for the `` light '' selection . as a result , with the modified version of the interaction model",
    "an overall improvement of the situation has been achieved .",
    "it should be pointed out that the experimentally accessible attenuation length @xmath6 is extremely sensitive to the inelastic hadronic cross sections .",
    "a relatively small modification ( @xmath13 is changed by 5% only at @xmath0  gev ) yields significant changes , as can be inferred from .",
    "in addition , the results have been calculated also as function of the hadronic energy sum at observation level .",
    "the results for all data , as well as for the light and heavy selections are presented in a ) . again",
    ", a closer inspection yields unreasonable results when the `` light '' elements are considered . at high energies even all measured events are above the proton simulations . in agreement with the previous discussion , the issue can be resolved by introducing a modified version of the interaction model , as can be seen in b ) .",
    "arranging the data in @xmath41 bins implies an enrichment of light primaries , which explains why all data almost agree with pure proton simulations and the discrepancy between measurements and qgsjet  01 predictions are magnified .",
    "a new method has been developed to derive the attenuation length of hadrons from measurements of high - energy cosmic rays interacting in the earth s atmosphere .",
    "the fraction of the energy of the primary particle reaching ground level in form of hadrons in air showers has been measured with the kascade experiment to increase from about 0.3% at @xmath0  gev to 0.8% at @xmath1  gev .",
    "an attenuation length based on the absorbed energy has been defined .",
    "corresponding values increase with energy from about 170  2 to @xmath56  2 .",
    "a closer inspection of the attenuation lengths obtained for showers induced by `` light '' and `` heavy '' elements indicates that the cross sections in the hadronic interaction model qgsjet01 may be too large and the elasticity may be too small .",
    "a modification with altered parameters improves the situation .    as final remark , it should be pointed out that the attenuation length @xmath6 is extremely sensitive to inelastic hadronic cross sections .",
    "the sensitivity of air shower measurements , in particular of the hadronic component to properties of hadronic interactions has been demonstrated previously .",
    "for example , the dependence of observable quantities on the transverse momentum in hadronic interactions @xcite or on low - energy inelastic cross sections @xcite . in a similar way ,",
    "the data presented and the method introduced in the present article may serve to check and improve further hadronic interaction models .    the authors would like to thank the members of the engineering and technical staff of the kascade - grande collaboration , who contributed to the success of the experiment .",
