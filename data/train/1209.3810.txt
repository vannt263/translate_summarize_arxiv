    "early conjectures about the nature of the galactic dark matter , estimated from the stellar velocity distribution to have a density @xmath120.3 gev/@xmath13 at the location of the solar system , focused on two main ideas : ( a ) that it may consist of wimps , weakly interacting massive particles , such as the lightest supersymmetric particle  @xcite , or ( b ) that it may consist of a very light boson , called the axion , associated with a symmetry proposed by peccei and quinn  @xcite with a symmetry - breaking energy scale @xmath14 gev .",
    "extensive studies of the possible role of axions in astrophysics and primordial cosmology have been made by khlopov et al  @xcite .",
    "this particle was originally termed `` invisible '' because of its predicted extremely weak interaction with normal matter . however , in 1983 it was shown by sikivie  @xcite that these invisible axions could , in principle , be detected via their coupling to two photons ( primakoff effect ) by conversion to a microwave photon , with energy equal to the axion mass , in a magnetic field .",
    "sikivie s paper also renewed interest in the detection of solar axions",
    ". if the symmetry - breaking scale is lower than that needed for dark matter axions , axions produced in the sun might be detectable through their coupling to photons , electrons and nuclei  @xcite .",
    "these solar axions with energies peaking at around a few kev ( independent of axion mass ) can be converted by a magnetic field to x - rays and detected in this fashion , providing evidence that axions exist even if they are not the dark matter in the universe . in this context , another important idea was suggested which was to use the analogue of the photoelectric effect , termed the axio - electric effect , to provide conventional detection by ionization of atoms  @xcite .",
    "this principle was immediately applied by avignone et al .",
    "@xcite to their existing underground germanium detector , setting dimensionless coupling limits @xmath15 from the statistical absence of a signal in their detector background .",
    "further detection ideas for both solar axions and dark matter axions , as well as axion - like particles ( alps ) in which the connection between the mass and the symmetry breaking scale is relaxed , are reviewed by smith @xmath16 lewin  @xcite and by rosenberg and van bibber  @xcite .",
    "subsequently , experiments searching for wimps and axions diverged and specialized : axion searches concentrated on improved cavity microwave experiments for dark matter such as the axion dark matter experiment ( admx )  @xcite and solar axion telescopes such as the cern axion solar telescope ( cast )  @xcite for solar axions , while wimp searches have concentrated on nuclear recoil detection using ionization , scintillation , bolometric methods , and combinations of these  @xcite , using targets of increasing mass and increasingly low background  @xcite .",
    "these improvements in background , arising both from reduction in detector radioactivity levels and from the use of outer regions of the target as self shielding  @xcite , have recently increased interest in using the same wimp detectors also to detect , or set new limits on , both dark matter and solar axions , in addition to other new types of postulated particle which may be the galactic dark matter .",
    "@xcite    avignone  @xcite has recently discussed the use of future large scale ge detector arrays , using the axio - electric effect , to improve the axion - photon coupling limit to the @xmath17 level , and avignone et al .",
    "@xcite have discussed the use of annual modulation of the axio - electric effect in future large scintillator arrays to probe possible axion - photon oscillation phenomena .",
    "the cryogenic cdms dark matter experiment ( ahmed et al .",
    "@xcite ) has set axion coupling limits via primakoff conversion and coherent bragg diffraction in germanium crystal ionization detectors .",
    "derbin et al .",
    "@xcite have used a si(li ) crystal to detect axio - electric signals from both si and tm target crystals , and in turn to set limits on the solar axion flux , thus providing limits on both axion - electron coupling and axion mass .",
    "suzuki et al .",
    "@xcite are exploring limits on galactic / solar axions as well as wimp dark matter from the single phase liquid xe xmass experiment .",
    "finally , pospelov et al .",
    "@xcite showed that variants of photoelectric or axio - electric absorption of dark matter can provide sensitivity to superweak couplings from other more general bosonic dark matter candidates .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the improvements in detection sensitivity which would be obtainable with both existing and future large - scale ( 0.1 - 10 ton ) ultra - low background liquid xe targets , especially the 2-phase liquid / gas instruments , showing the sensitivity and confidence limits for axion and other boson couplings as a function of background level , energy resolution , and target exposure .",
    "detection of axions by the axio - electric effect measures specifically the coupling of axions to electrons , and does not depend on the existence of an axion - photon coupling .",
    "liquid xenon detectors can perform searches for both types of axion particle - dark matter ( galactic ) axions and solar axions . for dark matter axions , which are non - relativistic",
    ", the mass of the axion would be fully converted to the electron recoil energy , giving a signal that is monochromatic ( with the exception of detector energy resolution effects ) .",
    "solar axions are produced with a spectrum peaking at around a few kev , regardless of their rest mass , so that detection of solar axions is possible even though their intrinsic mass may be extremely small .",
    "we consider the basic theory of signal from galactic axions in section 2 , and solar axions in section 3 .",
    "this is followed in section 4 with case studies examining achievable sensitivity to axion interactions with existing and future liquified xe detectors . in section 5",
