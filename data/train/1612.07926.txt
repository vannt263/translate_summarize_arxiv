    "general relativity ( gr ) represents one of the pillars of modern physics .",
    "the predictions made by this theory range from the perihelion shift of mercury , the deflexion of light and gravitational lensing , the gravitational redshift and time delay , and the existence of black holes .",
    "the observation of these effects , as well as the recent detection of the gravitational waves gw150914  @xcite and gw151226  @xcite , have given gr the status of the benchmark theory of the gravitational interaction ( for an excellent review , see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "why do we want to find new gravitational theories beyond gr then ?",
    "the reason has to do with some fundamental questions associated with the gravitational interaction which gr does not seem to be able to answer satisfactorily .",
    "one is the problem of dark matter and dark energy , which require introducing some unknown matter - energy to reconcile gr predictions with the observations of galactic rotation curves and accelerated expansion of the universe , respectively .",
    "then , there is the difficulty of reconciling gr with the standard model of particle physics , or equivalently , the failure to quantise gr by the same successful scheme used with the other fundamental interactions .",
    "such issues have motivated the search of a new gravitational theory beyond gr that could help to explain part of the problems mentioned above .",
    "indeed , there is already a long list of alternative theories , like @xmath0 and higher curvature theories , galileon theories , scalar - tensor theories , ( new and topological ) massive gravity , chern - simons theories , higher spin gravity theories , horava - lifshitz gravity , extra - dimensional theories , torsion theories , horndeski s theory , etc ( see for instance refs .",
    "@xcite@xcite ) . nonetheless , quantum gravity is still an open problem , and dark matter and dark energy remain a mystery so far .",
    "the mgd was originally proposed  @xcite in the context of the the randall - sundrum brane - world  @xcite and extended to investigate new black hole solutions  @xcite . while the brane - world is still an attractive scenario ,",
    "since it explains the hierarchy of fundamental interactions in a simple way , to find interior solutions for self - gravitating systems is a difficult task , mainly due to the existence of non - linear terms in the matter fields .",
    "in addition , the effective four - dimensional einstein equations are not a closed system , due to the extra - dimensional effects resulting in terms undetermined by the four - dimensional equations . despite these complications ,",
    "the mgd has proven to be useful , among other things , to derive exact and physically acceptable solutions for spherically symmetric and non - uniform stellar distributions  @xcite as well ; to express the tidal charge in the metric found in ref .",
    "@xcite in terms of the usual arnowitt - deser - misner ( adm ) mass  @xcite ; to study microscopic black holes  @xcite ; to clarify the role of exterior weyl stresses acting on compact stellar distributions  @xcite ; to extend the concept of variable tension introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite by analysing the shape of the black string in the extra dimension  @xcite ; to prove , contrary to previous claims , the consistency of a schwarzschild exterior  @xcite for a spherically symmetric self - gravitating system made of regular matter in the brane - world ; to derive bounds on extra - dimensional parameters  @xcite from the observational results of the classical tests of gr in the solar system ; to investigate the gravitational lensing phenomena beyond gr  @xcite ; as well as to determine the critical stability region for bose - einstein condensates in gravitational systems  @xcite .",
    "this brief review is organised as follows : the simplest ways to modified gravity are presented in section  [ s2 ] , emphasising some problems that arise when the gr limit is considered ; in section  [ s3 ] , we recall the einstein field equations on the brane for a spherically symmetric and static distribution of density @xmath1 and pressure @xmath2 ; in section  [ s4 ] , the gr limit is discussed and the basic elements of the mgd are presented in section  [ s5 ] ; in section  [ s6 ] , we review the matching conditions between the interior and exterior space - time of self - gravitating systems within the mgd , and a recipe with the basic steps to implement the mgd is described in section  [ s7 ] ; finally , some conclusions are presented in the last section .",
    "one can not try and change gr without considering the well - established and very useful lovelock s theorem  @xcite , which severely restricts any possible ways of modifying gr in four dimensions .",
    "we will now show the simplest generic way .",
    "any extension to gr will eventually produce new terms in the effective four - dimensional einstein equations .",
    "these `` corrections '' are usually handled as part of an effective energy - momentum tensor and appear in such a way that they should vanish or be negligible in an appropriate limit .",
    "for instance , they should vanish at solar system scales , where gr has been successfully tested so far .",
    "this limit represents not only a critical point for a consistent extension of gr , but also a non - trivial problem that must be treated carefully .",
    "the simplest way to extend gr is by considering a modified einstein - hilbert action , @xmath3 \\sqrt{-g}\\,d^4x + \\alpha\\,({\\rm correction } ) \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath4 is a free parameter associated with the new gravitational sector not described by gr . the explicit form corresponding to the generic correction shown in eq .",
    "( [ corr1 ] ) should be , of course , a well justified and physically motivated expression . at this stage",
    "the gr limit , obtained by setting @xmath5 , is just a trivial issue , so everything looks consistent .",
    "indeed , we may go further and calculate the equations of motion from setting the variation @xmath6 corresponding to this new theory , @xmath7 the new terms in eq .",
    "( [ corr2 ] ) may be viewed as part of an effective energy - momentum tensor , whose explicit form may contain new fields , like scalar , vector and tensor fields , all of them coming from the new gravitational sector not described by einstein s theory . at this stage the gr limit , again , is a trivial issue , since @xmath5 leads to the standard einstein s equations @xmath8 .",
    "all the above seems to tell us that the consistency problem , namely the gr limit , is trivial .",
    "however , when the system of equations given by the expression  ( [ corr2 ] ) is solved , the result may show a complete different story .",
    "in general , and this is very common , the solution eventually found can not reproduce the gr limit by simply setting @xmath5 .",
    "the cause of this problem is the non - linearity of eq .",
    "( [ corr2 ] ) , and should not be a surprise . to clarify this point ,",
    "let us consider a spherically symmetric perfect fluid , for which gr uniquely determines the metric component @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the mass function of the self - gravitating system .",
    "now , let us consider the same perfect fluid in the `` new '' gravitational theory  ( [ corr1 ] ) . when eq .",
    "( [ corr2 ] ) is solved , we obtain an expression which generically may be written as @xmath11 where by _ geometric deformation _",
    "one should understand the deformation of the metric component  ( [ g11 - 1 ] ) due to the generic extension  ( [ corr1 ] ) of gr .",
    "( `` deformation '' hence means a deviation from the gr solution ) .",
    "it is now very important to note that the deformation  ( [ g11def ] ) always produces _ anysotropic consequences _ on the perfect fluid , so that the self - gravitating system will not be described as a perfect fluid anymore . indeed , and this is a critical point in our analysis , the anisotropy produced by the geometric deformation always takes the form @xmath12 this expression is very significant , since it shows that the gr limit can not be _ a posteriori _ recovered by setting @xmath13 , since the `` sector '' denoted by @xmath14 in the anisotropy  ( [ any ] ) does not depend on @xmath4 .",
    "consequently , the perfect fluid gr solution ( @xmath15 ) is not trivially contained in this extension , and one might say that we have an extension to gr which does not contain gr .",
    "this is of course a contradiction , or more properly a consistency problem , whose source can be precisely traced back to the _ geometric deformation _ shown in eq .",
    "( [ g11def ] ) . the latter always takes the form @xmath16 which contains a `` sector '' @xmath17 that does not depend on @xmath4 .",
    "this is again obviously inconsistent , since the deformation undergone by gr must depend smoothly on @xmath4 and vanish with it . at the level of solutions , the source of this problem is the high non - linearity of the effective einstein equations  ( [ corr2 ] ) , which we want to emphasise has nothing to do with any specific extension of gr .",
    "indeed , it is a characteristic of any high non - linear systems .",
    ", so that gr represents a `` sub - space '' in the extended theory of gravity .",
    "when the free parameter @xmath4 is turned off , we should automatically recover the domain of gr.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    a method that solves the non - trivial issue of consistency with gr described above is the so - called _ minimal geometric deformation _",
    "mgd approach  @xcite .",
    "the idea is to keep under control the anisotropic consequences on gr appearing in the extended theory , in such a way that the @xmath4-independent sector in the geometric deformation shown as @xmath17 in eq .",
    "( [ def ] ) always vanishes . correspondingly , the @xmath4-independent sector of the anisotropy @xmath14 in eq .",
    "( [ any ] ) will also vanish .",
    "this will ensure a consistent extension that recovers gr in the limit @xmath18 . in this approach , the generic expression @xmath19 in eq .",

    "( [ any ] ) being the _ minimal anysotropic consequence _ undergone by gr due to correction terms in the modified einstein - hilbert action  ( [ corr1 ] ) .",
    "the next key point is how we can make sure @xmath21 in eq .",
    "( [ def ] ) in order to obtain a consistent extension to gr .",
    "this is accomplished when a gr solution is forced to remian a solution in the extended theory .",
    "roughly speaking , we need to introduce the gr solution into the new theory , as far as possible .",
    "this provides the foundation for the mgd approach .",
    "we want to emphasise that the gr solution used to set @xmath21 in eq .",
    "( [ def ] ) will eventually be modified by using , for instance , the matching conditions at the surface of a self - gravitating system .",
    "one will therefore obtain physical variables that depend on the free parameter of the theory , here generically named @xmath4 .",
    "this free parameter could be , for instance , the one that measures deviation from gr in @xmath0 theories , the brane tension in the brane - world , and so .",

    "since the source of this problem is directly related to the projection @xmath71 of the bulk weyl tensor on the brane , the first logical step to overcome this issue would be to impose the constraint @xmath72 on the brane .",
