    "the coherence length @xmath1 has first been introduced as a phenomenological length scale in the near-@xmath5 ginzburg - landau ( gl ) description where it sets , among other things , the  vortex core size \" @xmath6 . since the core ,",
    "in fact , does not have a sharp boundary , the size @xmath7 can not be unambiguously defined and is commonly chosen  operationally convenient \" , i.e. , in a way which varies from one experimental or theoretical situation to another .",
    "for example , @xmath6 may be defined as the radius of a circle where the persistent current is maximum , @xcite or - within the london approach - as the distance at which the divergent london current density reaches the depairing value , or assuming the core being a normal cylinder and equating the core contribution to the vortex energy to @xmath8 with @xmath9 being the condensation energy.@xcite another example comes from the scanning tunneling work where  the vortex core radius is arbitrary defined by that distance @xmath6 from the vortex center , for which the tunneling current has decreased from @xmath10 to 36% of @xmath11.\"@xcite clearly , these procedures yield different values of @xmath6 , although all of them have the same order of magnitude .    a lot of experimental effort has been invested recently in study of the vortex core size , see the review by sonier and references therein.@xcite notably , whatever the definition of @xmath6 is adopted , the low temperature @xmath6 is shown to decrease with increasing field in a number of materials such as nbse@xmath12 , v@xmath13si , luni@xmath12b@xmath12c , yba@xmath12cu@xmath13o@xmath14 , ceru@xmath12 physical characteristics of which have little to do with each other ( except all of them have a large gl parameter @xmath15 ) . the dependences @xmath16 for all tested materials are qualitatively similar ; for large fields @xmath17 . properties of the quasiparticle spectrum inside and outside the cores ( where the excitations may form narrow conducting bands ) are considered responsible for the @xmath18 and @xmath19 dependences of @xmath6 .    the point of this paper is to provide a general theoretical argument based on the weak - coupling bcs theory in addressing causes of the field dependence of @xmath6 .",
    "this argument is omitted in the current discussion of the problem in the experimental community , although a few examples of numerical solutions of the microscopic equations of superconductivity show that the @xmath18 dependence of @xmath6 follows from the theory under very general assumptions.@xcite our approach can be applied to the problem of @xmath16 only in large fields of high-@xmath0 materials ; still , we obtain our main results analytically that has certain advantages as compared to however powerful numerical techniques and enables one to make experimentally verifiable predictions .",
    "+ we begin with the notion that within the microscopic theory , at arbitrary magnetic fields @xmath18 and temperatures @xmath19 , it is not clear what exact value one should assign to @xmath1 .",
    "the difficulty comes from the fact that @xmath1 and @xmath6 are not among the basic input parameters of the theory ; instead , they should be calculated , analytically a very difficult if at all possible task in general",
    ". there is , however , a region at the second order phase transition from superconducting to normal state , the sn boundary , where the theory can be linearized and consequently @xmath1 is well defined .",
    "the linearization has been performed in the seminal work of helfand and werthamer ( hw ) on the upper critical field @xmath20 with @xmath21 being the mean scattering time on nonmagnetic impurities.@xcite they have shown that at @xmath22 where the order parameter @xmath23 goes to zero , it satisfies for any @xmath19 a linear equation , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the gauge invariant gradient , @xmath26 is the vector potential , and @xmath27 is the flux quantum .",
    "formally , the equation is equivalent to the schrdinger equation for a charge in uniform magnetic field ; the field @xmath22 at which superconductivity first nucleates corresponds to the lowest eigenvalue of this equation : @xmath28 .",
    "this field ( and @xmath1 ) is obtained by solving the basic self - consistency equation of the theory : @xmath29 where the function @xmath30 can be written as : @xmath31 here , @xmath32 , @xmath33 is an integer , @xmath34 is the fermi velocity , and @xmath35 is the mean - free path . the power series representation of @xmath36 is obtained by formally expanding tan@xmath37 and then integrating over @xmath38 .",
    "the evaluation of @xmath36 was performed for the isotropic fermi surface , i.e. , for a fermi sphere .",
    "thus , strictly speaking , the length @xmath1 is defined only at the sn phase boundary @xmath39 , and the question remains whether or not the same definition of @xmath1 is useful out of the immediate vicinity of @xmath39 .",
    "in fact , in a variety of situations ( small samples , proximity systems ) the sn transition may take place far from the bulk @xmath39 . to approach the problem of the phase boundary in these systems",
    ", one has to know @xmath40 in a broad domain of the @xmath41 plane away of the bulk @xmath39 .",
    "a method to evaluate @xmath40 had been developed in refs . and .",
    "in principle , the method follows hw by utilizing the field _",
    "uniformity _ and the @xmath23 _ smallness _ at the sn transition wherever it occurs .",
    "below , we outline the method as applied to the three - dimensional ( 3d ) isotropic case of a fermi sphere .",
    "then , we consider 2d isotropic materials , i.e. , the fermi cylinder .",
    "we find that @xmath40 so obtained _ decreases _ when @xmath18 _ increases _ toward @xmath22 away of the critical temperature @xmath5 in clean superconductors ; the effect is suppressed by impurity scattering and is absent in the dirty limit .",
    "we provide a closed form equation for @xmath42 for zero-@xmath19 clean case for both the fermi sphere and fermi cylinder , and show that the results can be represented as @xmath43 with @xmath4 being an universal function .",
    "we next argue that the same procedure can be applied to the mixed state in applied fields @xmath44 near the vortex core centers in materials with large @xmath45 .",
    "this is because near the centers the field ( varying on the scale of the london penetration depth @xmath46 ) can be taken as _ uniform _ and @xmath47 at the center .",
    "we find our results in qualitative agreement with the data available , uncertainties of experimental procedures of extracting @xmath1 notwithstanding .",
    "here we reproduce major points of the @xmath42 derivation for the system near the second order sn transition with the help of the quasiclassical eilenberger formalism.@xcite the main equations of the theory read : @xmath50 here , @xmath51 is the fermi velocity ; @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the eilenberger green s functions with averages over the fermi surface denoted as @xmath54 and @xmath55 .    in the normal phase @xmath56 and @xmath57 . in a small vicinity of the sn transition , @xmath58 , whereas @xmath59 can still be set unity in linear approximation in @xmath60 due to normalization @xmath61 ( for the same reason we do not need here an equation for @xmath62 ) . equation ( [ eil1 ] ) can be linearized : @xmath63 the solution of eq.([linear ] ) is written as @xmath64 or for the fermi surface average : @xmath65 we now assume that @xmath66 and @xmath67 satisfy eq.([lineargl ] ) ; then , utilizing commutators of the operator @xmath68 in an _ uniform _ field and the known properties of exponential operators,@xcite one can manipulate eq.([f ] ) to @xmath69 where @xmath70\\,,\\qquad q^2=\\frac{2\\pi h}{\\phi_0}.\\label{s - sum}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] after substituting @xmath71 of eq.([ff ] ) in the self - consistency eq.([eil2 ] ) and cancelling @xmath72 , we obtain an implicit eq.([self * ] ) for @xmath73 .",
    "it is easy to see that at @xmath22 where @xmath74 , the series ( [ s - sum ] ) reduces to the hw sum ( [ hwsum ] ) .",
    "the double sum ( [ s - sum ] ) is in fact an asymptotic series and is difficult to deal with when the goal is to solve eq.([self * ] ) for @xmath73 .",
    "the situation simplifies greatly in the dirty limit : @xmath36 is an expansion in powers of @xmath75 .",
    "keeping only the terms with @xmath76 , one obtains @xmath77 when substituted in the self - consistency eq.([self * ] ) , this yields de gennes - maki dirty limit result for @xmath78 and @xmath39.@xcite since the field @xmath79 does not enter @xmath36 , _ the coherence length in the dirty limit is field independent_. in other words , in the dirty limit , the coherence length at a given @xmath19 determined at the upper critical field , is the same at this @xmath19 for any @xmath18 .",
    "formally similar situation takes place near the critical temperature @xmath5 where the truncation ( [ trancs ] ) is justified by smallness of @xmath79 and @xmath80 ( not of @xmath75 ) .",
    "we conclude that _ near @xmath5 the coherence length is field independent for any @xmath75_. we then expect the strongest @xmath18 dependence of @xmath1 to exist at low temperatures in clean materials .",
    "given the complexity of series ( [ s - sum ] ) , it is desirable to have an integral representation for @xmath36 better suited for analytic and numerical work .",
    "this had been done in ref . for the 3d case of a spherical fermi surface .",
    "we refer the reader for details of this nontrivial procedure and provide here the result : @xmath81 @xmath82 ( @xmath83 here differs by the sign from that used in ref . ) .",
    "note that @xmath84 at @xmath22 ; integration by parts in ( [ s3d ] ) gives the hw integral ( [ hwint ] ) .",
    "one can check by formally expanding the integrand in powers of @xmath85 and integrating over @xmath38 , that the integral ( [ s3d ] ) can indeed be written as the series ( [ s - sum ] ) , see appendix b in ref . .",
    "the calculations of the previous section can not be done for an arbitrary fermi surface . still , for some simple shapes it is possible .",
    "the simplest of those is the fermi cylinder with the field parallel to the cylinder axis . employing the same procedure outlined for the fermi sphere , we arrive at @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath83 are defined in eq.([u ] )",
    "; we use the notation @xmath88.@xcite the integral representation of this sum can be obtained in a manner similar to that described in ref . for the 3d case : @xmath89 see appendix a. to verify this result we write : @xmath90 where @xmath91 . substituting this to eq .",
    "( [ s2d ] ) and integrating over @xmath38 one obtains @xmath36 in the form ( [ s2dsum ] ) .    having the quantity @xmath92 for both 3d ( fermi sphere ) and 2d ( fermi cylinder )",
    ", one can solve eq.([self * ] ) for @xmath73 that in general can be done numerically . as pointed out above",
    ", the most interesting is the situation at @xmath2 in clean materials ; this case can be treated analytically .",
    "to deal with the divergence of @xmath94 in eq.([self * ] ) we note than the sum over @xmath95 on the right - hand side ( rhs ) is actually extended to the debye frequency @xmath96",
    ". then , we have for the finite sum @xmath97 where the neglected terms are of the order @xmath98 and @xmath99 is the euler constant .",
    "hence the divergent @xmath100 in eq.([self * ] ) drops off .",
    "since in the clean limit @xmath101 and @xmath102 we obtain instead of eq.([self * ] ) in the zero-@xmath19 limit : @xmath103 the integral at the rhs diverges logarithmically for @xmath104 , and so does the lhs ; in other words , @xmath96 should drop off the result .",
    "this integral is evaluated in appendix b for both 3d and 2d cases .",
    "we then obtain an implicit equation for @xmath1 : @xmath105+\\frac{\\psi(\\sigma)}{2 } = 0,\\nonumber\\\\   \\ , \\label{***}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath106 is the digamma function . the only difference between 2d and 3d situations",
    "is in the number @xmath107 : @xmath108    setting @xmath84 in eq .",
    "( [ * * * ] ) one obtains : @xmath109 this yields for the 3d case : @xmath110 the value obtained variationally by gorkov@xcite and proven to be exact by hw ; in hw reduced units it corresponds to @xmath111.@xcite for the 2d case , this gives @xmath112 , the result obtained by bulaevskii.@xcite    we now observe that material parameters enter eq .",
    "( [ * * * ] ) only in the first term under the log - sign .",
    "if one measures the length in units of @xmath113 and uses the reduced field @xmath114 , eq .",

    "given this curve and @xmath118 , one can recover @xmath42 for a clean material at @xmath2 .",
    "the curve @xmath3 is shown as a solid line in fig.[fig1 ] for @xmath119 ; the reason why the small fields domain is not shown is given in the next section .",
    "also shown are results of numerical evaluation of @xmath42 for a few values of the impurity parameter @xmath120 .",
    "the numerical calculation is done with the help of the self - consistency eq.([self * ] ) for arbitrary @xmath19 and @xmath121 ; @xmath122 is evaluated using an explicitly real form given in appendix c.    it is worth noting that effect of raising temperature on @xmath42 is qualitatively similar to that of the impurity scattering , see solid dots for @xmath123 : both suppress the field dependence of @xmath1 .",
    "however , at low temperatures for reasonably clean materials in a broad domain of high fields , @xmath42 is well represented by the zero-@xmath19 clean - limit curve ; it is seen from the upper panel of fig.[fig1 ] that for @xmath124 this domain extends down to @xmath125 .",
    "the lower panel of fig.[fig1 ] shows the same results plotted against @xmath126 , the quantity proportional to the intervortex spacing . in this manner",
    "the data are often presented to examine possible connection between the field dependence of the core size @xmath16 and other properties of the mixed state.@xcite our result shows that for materials on the clean side with @xmath127 , the slope @xmath128 for @xmath129 is universal .",
    "in fact , using eq.([universal * * * ] ) this slope at @xmath22 can be evaluated for the clean limit at @xmath2 : @xmath130 we also observe that for real materials with @xmath131 and @xmath132 , @xmath116 becomes flat as the field decreases with the impurity and temperature dependent plateaus .     versus @xmath114 .",

    "the above discussion of @xmath42 applies at the sn second order phase transition where the field is _ uniform _ and the order parameter @xmath23 goes to zero . in fact , these conditions are met in vortex cores of high-@xmath0 type - ii superconductors in high fields .",
    "indeed , in this case the field within the core of a size @xmath1 is practically uniform since it varies on a much larger scale @xmath46 . besides , when one approaches the vortex center , @xmath139 . to evaluate @xmath1 in this situation",
    ", one can use the same formalism as at the sn phase boundary ; in other words , the above procedure of evaluating @xmath42 can be used to characterize the size @xmath6 .",
    "the core size so defined is , of course ,  operationally convenient \" from our point of view just as various definitions mentioned in the introduction .",
    "our approach , however , is advantageous because along with evaluation of the @xmath18 dependence of the  core size \" @xmath1 , we predict that    * this dependence is weakened by scattering and disappears in the dirty limit , * the @xmath18 dependence of @xmath1 vanishes as @xmath140 , * @xmath42 is weakly affected by peculiarities of the fermi surface , i.e. , we expect qualitatively the same dependence for various materials , * in reduced variables , the dimensionless coherence length @xmath141 should be nearly universal function of the reduced field @xmath142 for clean materials in high fields and low temperatures .    therefore ,",
    "our  theoretically convenient \" definition of the core size can be checked experimentally .",
    "one should put a note of caution on our claim of  universality \" as stated in the last two points .",
    "this feature expressed in eq.([universal * * * ] ) , has been derived for two simple fermi surfaces , a sphere and a cylinder.@xcite nevertheless , since the fermi surface shape always enters calculations of macroscopic parameters as @xmath1 or @xmath46 via averaging over the whole surface , one does not expect the fine features of the surface to alter drastically our conclusion ( except in special circumstances , e.g. , when the local density of states has sharp maxima at the surface ) . with this caveat",
    "we will use the term  universality \" in further discussion .",
    "there is another drawback to our approach . when applied to the sn phase boundary ,",
    "say , of a proximity sandwich , the field @xmath18 in the @xmath42 dependence is the externally controlled uniform applied field . defining the core size as @xmath42",
    ", we imply that @xmath18 is a the field value at the vortex center , @xmath143 , which is nearly constant within the core provided @xmath144 .",
    "however , the problem is that there is no reliable and generally applicable estimate of @xmath143 , except numerical results with a particular choice of parameters for low-@xmath0 and for high-@xmath5 materials.@xcite an exception is the case of isolated vortices ( the applied field @xmath145 ) in the gl domain , where @xmath146.@xcite in a more interesting situation of @xmath147 , the vortex fields are strongly overlapped , and variations of the actual field within the vortex lattice are weak relative to the applied field ; in fact , they are on the order of @xmath148 . therefore , an error made by considering the field at the vortex axes as equal to the applied field is small . in other words , defining the vortex core size @xmath149 as @xmath150 has a reasonable chance of success only in large fields @xmath147 and improves as @xmath151 .",
    "there is also a theoretical difficulty we encounter attempting to extend the analysis to @xmath152 .",
    "in fact , the curve shown in fig.[fig1 ] and generated by solving eq.([universal * * * ] ) shows oscillating behavior if extended to low fields beyond @xmath153.@xcite our numerical work for finite @xmath121 and @xmath19 shows that these oscillations are washed out quickly with increasing scattering and/or temperature and are hardly seen for @xmath154 , i.e. , in still rather clean materials .",
    "relating the results obtained to information available on the vortex core size , we focus on the @xmath155sr data reviewed recently by sonier.@xcite this technique allows one to obtain the field distribution @xmath156 within the vortex lattice .",
    "then one can calculate the current distribution and define the core radius @xmath6 as the distance from the vortex axis to the current maximum in the nearest neighbor direction .",
    "this definition of the core size is independent of a model one may choose to theoretically describe the distribution @xmath156 , the point stressed in ref . .",
    "we will consider here the data on so defined @xmath6 .",
    "the @xmath155sr data on @xmath156 can also be analyzed with the help of the london model or its nonlocal version .",
    "for simplicity , we consider here the standard london isotropic result : @xmath157 where @xmath158 is the magnetic induction and the sum is extended over the reciprocal lattice @xmath159 .",
    "it is relevant for this discussion that ( a ) the london model contains only one length scale , the penetration depth @xmath46 , and ( b ) the model implies the constant order parameter @xmath23 and therefore breaks down at distances of the order @xmath1 .",
    "the latter comes about formally in eq.([london ] ) since the sum is divergent ( this is readily seen as the logarithmic divergence of @xmath160 when @xmath161 ) . to mend this inherent shortcoming of the london model , various cutoffs",
    "are commonly used , e.g. , by introducing a factor @xmath162 which excludes distances smaller than @xmath1 .",
    "numerous efforts to fix the constant s value notwithstanding ( see , e.g. , ref . ) , in practice this constant is used quite liberally depending on the application in question .",
    "other cutoffs basically suffer of similar uncertainties.@xcite hence , the _ reliable _ results of the london model are only those that are insensitive to the cutoff chosen .",
    "still , one can fit the data @xmath156 to a properly truncated sum ( [ london ] ) , and extract the best - fit parameters @xmath46 and @xmath1 along with their @xmath18 dependence .",
    "interestingly enough , the so extracted @xmath42 behaves as a function of @xmath18 in nearly the same manner as @xmath16 extracted directly from the field distribution ; it is found for a few materials that in high fields @xmath163 with a material dependent constant @xmath164.@xcite    we now consider the data on @xmath16 for v@xmath13si , nbse@xmath12 , yni@xmath12b@xmath12c , and ceru@xmath12 provided in refs .",

    "the reduced temperatures of the @xmath155sr experiments were low : @xmath167 0.22 , 0.33 , 0.19 , and 0.3 , respectively .",
    "for each material we have taken the @xmath22 at a corresponding temperature , calculated @xmath113 , and normalized the experimental core radius to this value to obtain @xmath168 .",
    "the results are plotted in the upper panel of fig.[fig2 ] together with the theoretical @xmath169 versus reduced fields @xmath114 . for reasons explained above we took only the data points for @xmath170 .",
    "we expect the experimental @xmath171 and the theoretical @xmath116 to be shifted by a material , temperature and purity dependent constant : @xmath172 .",
    "since the temperatures and impurity parameters in different experiments were different , we do not expect these shifts to be the same for the materials examined .",
    "in this situation , we have chosen the constants @xmath164 so as to shift the data points as close as possible to our curve of @xmath116 .",
    "the result is shown in the middle panel of fig.[fig2 ] ; the shifts needed are shown in the panel legend .",

    "in other words , the slope does not change much in each of these broad domains : @xmath180 or in common units : @xmath181 since the measured core size @xmath6 differs from our @xmath1 by a constant shift , we may rewrite the last estimate as @xmath182 in units employed in experiments . given our suggestion of  universality \"",
