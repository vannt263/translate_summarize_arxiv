    "it is well known that normal early - type galaxies are x - ray emitters , with 0.24 kev luminosities ranging from @xmath3 to @xmath4 erg s@xmath5 .",
    "the x - ray luminosity @xmath1 is found to correlate with the blue luminosity @xmath0 ( @xmath6 ) , but there is a large scatter of roughly two orders of magnitude in @xmath1 at any fixed @xmath7 ( @xcite ; fabbiano , kim , & trinchieri 1992 ) .",
    "the trend and the scatter in the @xmath8 diagram have been successfully reproduced by the time - dependent , 1d hydrodynamical models of ciotti ( 1991 , hereafter cdpr ) . in these models",
    "the gas lost by the evolving stars is heated to x - ray temperatures by stellar random motions and snia explosions . given the assumed time dependence of both mass loss rate ( @xmath9 ) and snia rate ( @xmath10 ) , the cdpr models can evolve through up to three different dynamical phases , i.e. , from winds to subsonic outflows to inflows ( in the following we call this kind of evolution the woi sequence ) .",
    "cdpr introduced the _",
    "parameter @xmath11 in order to predict the dynamical status of the gas flows in non - rotating , spherical galaxies .",
    "this parameter was defined as the ratio between the power required to extract steadily the gas supplied by the mass loss of the evolving stellar population from the galaxy potential well , @xmath12 , and the power supplied to the gas by the thermalization of the stellar random motions and by the supernova heating ( @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively ) . due to the temporal evolution of the various source terms",
    ", @xmath11 is an increasing function of time .",
    "numerical simulations showed the correspondence between @xmath15 and the presence of a wind phase ( i.e. , of a low @xmath1 ) , and the onset of a high @xmath1 soon after @xmath11 becomes @xmath16 .",
    "a recent analysis of the complete @xmath17 sample of early - type galaxies showed that on average s0 galaxies have lower @xmath1 and @xmath2 than ellipticals ( es ) ( eskridge , fabbiano , & kim 1995a , b ) .",
    "a possible explanation of this fact could be that s0s and non - spherical es are less able to retain hot gaseous haloes than rounder systems of the same @xmath0 .",
    "this could be due to a lower gravitational energy , because of their higher rotation rate which decreases the effective potential , or their different mass distribution .",
    "a theoretical analysis of this problem  based on the global energetics of the x - ray emitting gas  was carried out by ciotti & pellegrini ( 1996 , hereafter cp ) .",
    "they generalized the global parameter @xmath11 for flows in flat and rotating two - component galaxy models .",
    "in particular , they added to @xmath11 the contribution of the ordered rotation of the galaxy stellar component , @xmath18 , showing that , at least from a global point of view , rotation alone can not change an energetically bound gas flow to an unbound one ( see  2.3 ) . on the contrary , using two - component miyamoto - nagai models ( 1975 , hereafter mn ) , and under the assumption of an identical rate of snia per unit @xmath0 in s0s and es , cp showed that flat galaxies can have a much lower @xmath11 than rounder ones of the same luminosity , due essentially to their flattening , even in the presence of massive spherical dark haloes .",
    "more precisely , they showed how a realistic flattening can produce a decrease of @xmath12 of @xmath19 , a result which can be sufficient to change an inflow into a wind .",
    "so , the effect of the flattening was suggested as a possible explanation for the s0 underluminosity .",
    "incidentally , note that the decrease in the gravitational energy that is released by a stationary inflow at the bottom of the galactic potential well , associated to the decrease of @xmath12 , does not lower significantly the @xmath1 of pure cooling flow models ( cfr .",
    "fig.1 in cdpr ) .    despite the possible agreement between the observations and the results of cp ,",
    "this purely energetical approach can be seriously questioned considering the complexity of 2d gas flows and the fact that @xmath11 is a global quantity .",
    "in fact _ decoupled flows _  in which at the same time different parts of the galaxy are in inflow and outflow  may in principle develop in the cdpr scenario in such a way that @xmath1 remains high even if @xmath15 ; if this is the case , @xmath20 can not be used as a reliable indicator for a low x - ray luminosity , and the analysis of cp is seriously questioned .",
    "2d numerical simulations of gas flows in early - type galaxies were actually carried out by kley & mathews ( 1995 , hereafter km ) and brighenti & mathews ( 1996 , hereafter bm ) .",
    "these simulations , however , considered only pure cooling flows for which the flow decoupling is not expected .",
    "km considered rotating spherical king models plus a spherical quasi - isothermal dark halo , without snia heating . successively bm considered oblate galaxies with different axial ratios , sustained by various amounts of ordered and disordered kinetic energies .",
    "they assumed a snia rate @xmath21 , with a present day value of one - tenth of that proposed by tammann ( 1982 ) .",
    "their models show that the gas flow and the associated @xmath1 are only slightly dependent on the flattening of the galaxy ( in agreement with the cp analysis applied to the _ inflow _ case ) , and that @xmath1 is reduced by increasing the amount of ordered rotation .",
    "these 2d hydrodynamical models do not solve problems such as the disposal of excessive amounts of cold gas ( a problem already encountered in 1d pure cooling flow models ) on an equatorial disk , which is actually unobserved , and the excessively flat shape of the x - ray isophotes when compared with the observations .",
    "motivated by the given arguments , we adopt the same input physics used for the hydrodynamical equations in cdpr , in order to explore whether the woi sequence is still achieved in flat galaxies , how such a sequence is influenced by galaxy flattening and rotation , how important the decoupling in the flow is , which observational consequences are predicted in this case , and finally whether the energetical explanation of cp is exhaustive .",
    "this is accomplished with two different classes of models . in the first we compare the behavior of the gas flow in spherical and flat galaxies that are _",
    "energetically globally equivalent _ ( both with and without snia heating ) . in the second class of simulations",
    "we investigate the gas flows in realistic galaxy models of s0s , also in order to explore the possibility of flow decoupling in galaxies with @xmath15 and its effects on @xmath1 .",
    "we thus study the evolution of gas flows in the galaxy models constructed and described in detail by cp , i.e. , axisymmetric stellar and dark mass distributions with the mn shape , and in which the internal dynamics is determined by the solution of the associated jeans equations , allowing for variable amounts of ordered rotation and velocity dispersion .    in section 2",
    "we briefly describe the models used in the simulations . in section 3 the results obtained for models with different amounts of ordered rotation , sn heating , flattening , and characteristic scale - length are presented . a discussion , considering also some recent observational results is given in section 4 , and in section 5 the main conclusions are summarized .",
    "the two - component mass models used in our simulations and their internal dynamics are fully discussed in cp , which includes the explicit analytical formulae for the various terms in the virial theorem and for @xmath11 are given . here",
    "only the basic formulae are reported .",
    "the stellar density distribution is given by @xmath22^{5/2}},\\ ] ] and its potential is @xmath23 where @xmath24 , and @xmath25 are the cylindrical coordinates ( mn ) the density distribution ( 1 ) reduces to the plummer ( 1911 ) model , and @xmath26 becomes its effective radius .",
    "so , @xmath26 can be roughly considered a characteristic scale - length , while the galaxy flattening is determined by the dimensionless ratio @xmath27 . ] .",
    "the dark matter halo is described by another mn density distribution characterized by @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 the associated jeans equations are solved in the total potential @xmath31 , and under the assumption that the distribution function depends only on the specific energy and the angular momentum component along the @xmath32-axis ( see , e.g. , binney & tremaine 1987 , p.197 ) . with this assumption",
    "the radial and axial velocity dispersions are equal , i.e. , @xmath33 , and the only non - zero streaming motion can be in the azimuthal direction ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "the intrinsic degeneracy in the azimuthal velocity component is removed adopting the satoh ( 1980 ) @xmath35-decomposition , i.e. , @xmath36 and @xmath37 with @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the modulus of the ordered rotational velocity of the galactic stellar component . in the case",
    "@xmath40 no net rotation is present and all the flattening is due to @xmath41 ; @xmath42 corresponds to the isotropic rotator .",
    "the analytical solutions of the jeans equations can be obtained for @xmath43 . in simple case of @xmath44 the formulae for the velocity components are expressed in terms of elementary functions and are given in cp together with their edge - on projection .",
    "the equations describing the gas flows in our simulations are @xmath45 @xmath46 @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the fluid velocity , and @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 are the mass , the momentum , and the internal energy of the gas per unit volume , respectively .",
    "the source terms on the r.h.s . of equations ( 5)-(7 ) describe the injection of mass , momentum and energy in the gas due to the mass return and energy input from the stars .",
    "@xmath52 is the specific mass return rate from stars and snia respectively , with @xmath53 and @xmath54 ; @xmath55 is the injection energy per unit mass due to the stellar random motions and to snia explosions .",
    "@xmath56 is the bulk velocity of the stars , whose modulus is given by equation ( 3 ) , @xmath57 is the gravitational acceleration due to the total mass distribution , and @xmath58 .",
    "finally , @xmath59 is the cooling rate per unit volume , where for the cooling law @xmath60 we follow the prescription of mathews & bregman ( 1978 ) . for more details on the exact form of @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath55 ,",
    "see cdpr and km .    to integrate the set of equations we used a second - order , upwind , 2d extension of the numerical code described in cdpr , coupled with a staggered , spherical , eulerian grid .",
    "given the symmetry of the problem , the grid covers polar angles @xmath63 with 40 equally - spaced angular zones , and reflecting boundary conditions are applied at @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "the radial coordinate covers the range @xmath66 kpc with 80 logarithmically spaced zones , and a free outflow from the grid is allowed at the outer edge . at the inner edge reflecting boundary conditions are set .",
    "we assume the model galaxies to be initially devoid of gas due to the previous activity of the type ii sne . a discussion on the reliability and implications of this assumption is given in cdpr .",
    "the main ingredients of the global parameter @xmath11 are presented here .",
    "the snia heating evolution is parameterized as @xmath67 erg s@xmath5 , with @xmath68 where @xmath69 , and 1 snu = 1 sn per century per @xmath70 ( cfr .",
    "when @xmath71 gyr , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , the standard snia rate is recovered ( tammann 1982 ) is independent of @xmath74 . as a consequence @xmath14 @xmath75 on @xmath74 . in the paper we adopt @xmath76 .",
    "the power @xmath12 required to extract steadily from the galaxy the mass losses from the aging stellar population is @xmath77 the thermalization of the stellar random motions heats the gas at a power @xmath13 given by @xmath78 while the power @xmath18 related to the ordered fraction of the kinetic energy is given by @xmath79    unfortunately this last term can not be inserted in the @xmath11 definition in a simple way .",
    "in fact , two opposite and extreme scenarios can be assumed : one in which also @xmath18 is thermalized ( contributing to the gas heating together with @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) , and another in which the only effect of @xmath18 is to reduce the depth of the effective galactic potential well . as a consequence , the global parameter @xmath11 is defined as @xmath80 with @xmath81 .",
    "note that if @xmath82 , i.e. , in the case of _ complete thermalization _ , the virial theorem implies that @xmath83 depends only on the galaxy structure and @xmath11 is independent of the amount of ordered rotation ( in our case of the value of the parameter @xmath35 ) .",
    "when instead @xmath84 , i.e. , in the case of _ cold rotation _ , the effect of rotation is maximum ; cp showed that also in this case , for realistic galaxy models the differences in the value of @xmath11 , for a null and a maximum ordered velocity configuration , are small , usually less than @xmath85 .",
    "moreover whenever @xmath86 the introduction of rotation decreases a @xmath15 and increases a @xmath87 . in conclusion , from the cp analysis it results that rotation alone can not invert the global energy balance of a gas flow , but can help the occurrence of the wind when @xmath88 . due to the small dependence of @xmath11 on @xmath89 , through the paper",
    "we assume @xmath90 .",
    "we describe here in detail the main characteristics of the flow hosted by a galaxy model in which ordered rotation ( @xmath42 ) and snia heating in accordance with the latest estimates of cappellaro et al .",
    "( 1997 , @xmath91 ) are present .",
    "we assume @xmath92 , @xmath93 , so that @xmath94 , and @xmath95 kpc .",
    "the dark halo has the same profile of the stellar distribution , i.e. , @xmath44 and @xmath96 , and @xmath97 ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the three - dimensional central velocity dispersion is @xmath98 , and the maximum of the ordered rotational velocity is @xmath99 .",
    "this set of parameters is such that @xmath100 at the present epoch , in order to compare as much as possible the present results with those obtained for the so - called _ reference model _ discussed in cdpr ( hereafter krm , @xmath101 ) .",
    "@xmath0 is also the same of the krm , so that the mass return rate of the two models is exactly the same .",
    "note how it turns out that , in order to keep @xmath100 , model a1 must have very high stellar @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "this is not a surprise : in fact , as already pointed out by cp , in a realistic flat model with a non - negligible @xmath104 the present - epoch @xmath11 is substantially lower than unity .",
    "the same comment applies to models a1-a4 .      as a consequence of the early high snia energy injection , due to the assumed @xmath104 value and @xmath105 , at the very beginning",
    "the flow is in the wind supersonic phase , i.e. , the radial velocity @xmath106 throughout the galaxy ( fig.1 , top left panel ) .    as time increases and the energetic input decreases according to equation ( 8) , the sonic surface moves outward , with @xmath107 decreasing earlier in the central regions of the galaxy , and the gas density increases . finally , due to the rapidly increasing radiative losses ( the so called cooling  catastrophe ) ,",
    "at @xmath108 gyr the fluid starts to revert its motion in a conical region containing the polar axis .",
    "we call this phenomenon _ flow inversion _ , and the subsequent flow _ decoupled inflow_. the most striking feature of this evolutionary phase is the formation of cold , dense _ filaments _ at the boundary where two streams of inflowing and outflowing gas converge , as can be seen in fig.1 ( top right panel ) . this filamentary phase , which in model a1 suddenly develops at @xmath109 , is rather short ( @xmath110 gyr ) . later on ,",
    "no more filaments are generated , and the previous ones are accreted at the galactic center .",
    "however , regions of gas colder than x - ray temperature and with a low density contrast are present for a much longer time . during this evolutionary phase two qualitatively",
    "different regimes are present : an inner zone ( @xmath111 kpc ) in which the fluid is rather turbulent , and an outer zone where the velocity field is smooth ( fig.1 , bottom left panel ) .",
    "the inflow region becomes progressively larger and larger . at @xmath71",
    "gyr the gas is still outflowing in the outskirts of the disk .",
    "the flow in the rest of the galaxy is in a turbulent state , characterized by very subsonic velocities ( @xmath112 , fig.1 , bottom right panel ) .    in order to understand better the structure of the cold filaments",
    ", we performed a high - resolution simulation ( with 300 radial meshes and 140 angular meshes covering the same physical space as the normal resolution simulations ) .",
    "because of the severe limitation due to the azimuthal time - step , we could not extend the simulation over 15 gyr .",
    "we thus remapped onto the finer grid the hydrodynamical variables computed on the coarse grid at a time immediately before the filament formation , and we carried on the simulation for the entire lifetime of the filament .",
    "fig.2 shows the temperature and velocity field at @xmath113 gyr density and temperature vary along the filament .",
    "for @xmath114 kpc , @xmath115 g @xmath116 , and the density contrast between the cold filaments and the surrounding density is of the order of 30 .",
    "the mean temperature is @xmath117k ( the lowest allowed temperature in our simulations ) . at large @xmath118",
    "the density decreases and the temperature increases , but never reaches x - ray temperatures .",
    "we did not made convergence tests , so it is plausible that the filaments are denser and thinner .",
    "we stress that in our 2d simulations these filaments are in fact surfaces .",
    "this fact should be kept in mind in all the following discussions .",
    "the cold gas accreted during the entire lifetime of the galaxy forms a small disk , whose radius oscillates around a mean value of 3 kpc .",
    "the total mass of the cold disk is @xmath119 , while the hot x - ray gas is @xmath120 ( fig.3b , dotted line 1 ) , much less than the hot gas in the equivalent krm in cdpr ( @xmath121 ) .",
    "the comparison with the krm is instructive .",
    "also for this spherically symmetric model the present day @xmath122 , but @xmath123 gyr , much later than in model a1 . from fig.3d",
    "we note that the time evolution of @xmath1 ( dotted line 1 ) is qualitatively similar to that of spherical models . after an initial decrease during the wind phase , @xmath1 increases up to a maximum value at @xmath124 gyr . later on ,",
    "@xmath1 decreases again , in pace with the decreasing mass return from the stars . when @xmath1 reaches its maximum , a non - negligible fraction of gas is still outflowing from the galaxy , as in the 1d models .",
    "note that at the flow inversion the energy budget ( @xmath88 ) indicates that the snia energy injection would be able to sustain a global outflow .",
    "this means that , because of the strong decoupling of the flow , in this model the global energetic argument ( i.e. , the @xmath11 value ) , is not a useful indicator of the dynamical state of the gas .",
    "a second important difference between spherical models and model a1 must be stressed : in the latter , @xmath1 is a factor of four fainter than @xmath14 ( fig.3d , solid line ) , at variance with 1d models in which @xmath1 may be even greater than @xmath14 in the inflow phase .",
    "the fainter @xmath1 of model a1 is due to its lower content of hot gas with respect to the krm ( see  3.1.1 ) .",
    "this lower fraction of hot gas is due to the higher efficiency of the cooling near the equatorial plane of model a1 , a natural consequence of a higher gas density in this region , which in turn is due to the higher local stellar density ( the effect of rotation will be discussed in  3.1.4 )    we note however that , although the hot gas mass in model a1 is lower by about a factor ten with respect to the krm , @xmath1 does not diminish by the factor one hundred that one could expect as a rule of thumb ( the cooling per unit volume being @xmath125 ) : the much lower than expected reduction of @xmath1 is thus due to different hot gas distributions between the two models .",
    "we finally point out that the noisy temporal behavior of @xmath1 is a consequence of the density and temperature fluctuations associated to large eddies in the flow .",
    "the x - ray surface brightness ( @xmath126 ) evolution of model a1 is shown in fig.4 at the same epochs of the shots in fig.1 .",
    "the optical isophotes ( @xmath127 ) are also superimposed for comparison , and the galaxy is seen perfectly edge - on .    during the wind phase ,",
    "the x - ray isophotes are peanut - shaped , with regular lobes aligned with the galactic polar direction ( fig.4a ) .",
    "the elongation of the isophotes decreases steadily with time , they become rounder and rounder , and , in the inner regions , eventually flatter than the optical isophotes ( fig.4b , c ) . the isophotes of @xmath126 at the present epoch",
    "are rather flat in the central regions , and become progressively circular moving outward .",
    "this is due to the well known fact that the emitting gas accommodates in a potential well that is more spherical at large @xmath118 .",
    "the irregularities in the isophotal shapes are clear evidence of the inner turbulence ( fig.4d ) .",
    "note that once the cold filaments appear ( fig.4b , c ) , @xmath126 becomes very disturbed : we stress however that such an effect is magnified in our simulations by the imposed geometry , in which the filaments are in fact surfaces .",
    "we also computed @xmath126 under different viewing angles .",
    "it turns out that at early epochs the x - ray isophotes appear still elongated along the optical minor axis , even for values of the viewing angle as low as @xmath128 ( @xmath129=edge - on ) . instead , at late epochs , @xmath127 and @xmath126 become very similar as soon as the inclination angle is slightly lower than @xmath129 .",
    "we describe here a model very similar to a1 , but with @xmath40 , all the galaxy flattening being due to @xmath41 ( see table 1 ) . for this model",
    "the value of @xmath11 is independent of any assumption on the thermalization of ordered motions [ see eq .",
    "( 12 ) with @xmath82 ] , and is equal to unity .    from fig.3b",
    "it is apparent how this non - rotating model has a higher total gas mass ( dashed line 2 ) than the rotating model a1 ( dashed line 1 ) .",
    "this is because rotation - if not entirelly thermalized - decreases a @xmath15 ( see  2.3 ) , and in fact the largest difference between dashed line 1 and dashed line 2 takes place during the initial wind phase , when @xmath11 is substantially lower than unity .",
    "also the hot gas mass of model a2 ( dotted line 2 ) is higher than that of model a1 ( dotted line 1 ) : this is due to the combined effect of rotation , already discussed , and of the presence of a slightly more massive cold disk in model a1 , a consequence of angular momentum conservation .",
    "this effect is quite small in the models heated by snia , but much more important in the cooling - flow models ( a more detailed discussion is postponed to   3.2.2 - 3.2.3 ) .",
    "the main features of the temporal evolution of @xmath1 are similar for models a1 and a2 ( fig.3d dotted line 2 ) .",
    "we note however that the @xmath1 of model a2 is slightly higher than that of model a1 , in accordance with its higher content of hot gas .",
    "the flow dynamical evolution of model a2 is also quite similar to that of model a1 . the transient phase of filamentary instabilities  although to a minor extent  is still present , and develops approximately at the same time as in model a1 .",
    "the absence of rotation does not affect the presence of oscillations in the temporal evolution of @xmath1 , thus indicating that the turbulence is mainly due to a decoupled inversion of the gas flow , rather than to rotation .",
    "finally , @xmath126 evolves mainly as in model a1 , although the x - ray isophotes appear more circular in this non - rotating case .",
    "we focus here on the relationship between the galaxy s flattening and the development of the cold instabilities . to investigate this point we run two models similar to model a1 , except for the ratio @xmath131 ( see table 1 )",
    ". a quantitative measure of the flattening of a mn model in its central regions is obtained with a series expansion of eq .",
    "( 1 ) . retaining the quadratic terms the resulting isodensity surfaces are similar ellipsoids whose ellipticity is @xmath132 and @xmath27 .",
    "thus @xmath133 adopted in models a1 and a2 corresponds to @xmath134 . as a consequence , with @xmath135 ( and @xmath136 ) model a3 is slightly more spherical than model a1 , and its @xmath137 is higher , as expected .",
    "the result is that the flow inversion occurs earlier , and the filamentary phase is already completely developed at @xmath138 gyr . on the contrary model a4 , with @xmath139 and and @xmath140",
    "is flatter .",
    "its @xmath141 , and the filamentary phase starts now at @xmath142 gyr .",
    "for a short time this model shows the contemporary presence of two cold structures similar to that in fig .",
    "these two models show how small changes in the galaxy flattening can change the flow evolution in the cdpr scenario .",
    "a very different flow evolution is obtained by suppressing the snia heating in a model equal to a1 : now @xmath144 since the beginning , and the behaviour is that of a pure cooling flow .",
    "the velocity field is very smooth , thus showing that snia s play a fundamental role in maintaining a boiling hot gaseous halo . in this case we do not obtain the transient filamentary structure , and @xmath1 decreases smoothly .",
    "the present day @xmath1 is more than one order of magnitude lower than in the previous snia heated cases ( fig.3c , dashed line ) , because there is considerably less hot gas in the galaxy ( fig.3a , dashed line ) .",
    "the cooling gas accumulates now on an extended cold disk of @xmath145 , approximately ten times more massive than that of model a1 .",
    "such a disk , present also in the simulations of bm and km , is not actually observed in real galaxies .",
    "the x - ray isophotes of model b1 closely follow the optical ones .",
    "model b2 is analogous to model b1 , but no ordered rotation is applied . in this case @xmath1 is higher than in model b1 at every time ( fig.3c , dotted line ) , just due to the larger amount of hot gas ( fig.3a , dotted line ) . at first sight",
    "it could seem contradictory that the model with the lower @xmath1 ( b1 ) has cooled a larger amount of gas , i.e. , one could expect a higher @xmath1 , at least in the past . however , although more mass cools per unit time in the rotating model , the lack of thermalization of the gravitational energy of the gas which stops on the rotating cold disk instead of falling into the galaxy center produces a net quenching in the global @xmath1 ( as pointed out by bm ) .",
    "the @xmath126 isophotes in the non - rotating case are more concentrated towards the center and rounder than in the rotating case , as found by bm .",
    "it is of interest to compare our cooling flow models with those of bm .",
    "these authors find a dramatic reduction of @xmath1 when introducing rotation , but at variance with us , the hot gas mass in their rotating models decreases only slightly compared to the non - rotating ones .",
    "thus , the lower luminosity in their rotating models is due essentially to a redistribution of the hot gas mass , rather than to its scarcity as in ours .",
    "the origin of this different behaviour is in the higher flattening of the models used here ( i.e. , in the presence of the disk in the mn density distribution ) .",
    "in fact , in our models a larger fraction of gas is produced at low-@xmath32 over the galactic equatorial plane . when the model is rotating this gas falls on the disk approximately at the same distance from the center where it was formed , bacause of angular momentum conservation .",
    "so , on one hand it releases a much lower gravitational energy , and , on the other , the hot gas distribution is changed only slightly with respect to the non - rotating case .",
    "the accumulation of the gas on the disk also significantly increases its cooling , and the final result is a reduction of the hot gas mass .",
    "note that also in the bm models the amount of cold gas increases with an increasing ellipticity of the parent galaxy .",
    "as mentioneded in the introduction , we also ran models which are similar in many aspects to a1 , but with larger @xmath26 s , in order to have realistic values for the velocity dispersion ( see table 1 ) . since @xmath146 ,",
    "increasing @xmath26 at fixed @xmath147 produces a reduction in the gas density and thus in the cooling , because of the lower stellar density . at the same time , because @xmath148 , @xmath12 is reduced too , favoring the escape of the gas .",
    "model c1 ( @xmath149 kpc , @xmath150 km / s , @xmath151 km / s , @xmath152 ) develops a decoupled inflow at @xmath153 gyr , as can be seen from the evolution of @xmath1 ( fig.3d , heavy dotted line 3 ) .",
    "the most striking feature is again the formation of cold filaments ( fig.5 ) .",
    "surprisingly enough , these filaments do not form at the moment of flow inversion ( @xmath154 gyr ) , but quite later ( @xmath155 gyr ) . at variance with model a1",
    ", they form close to the galactic equatorial plane ( cfr .",
    "fig.2 ) . once on the plane",
    ", they slowly drift towards the center and accrete on a small cold disk ( @xmath156 kpc , @xmath157 ) .",
    "this dynamical phase is characterized by a conspicuous and steady decrease of @xmath1 , a consequence of the decrease of the hot gas mass ( fig.3b , heavy dotted line 3 ) .",
    "while this effect is certainly real , it is magnified in our simulations for two reasons .",
    "first , as already pointed out , the filaments are in fact cylindrical surfaces ; second , as usual in 2d simulations , reflecting boundary conditions on the disk introduce non - physical effects favoring cold material accumulation .",
    "the @xmath126 evolution is similar to that of model a1 , but postponed in time .    for model d1 ( @xmath158 kpc , @xmath159 km / s , @xmath160 km / s , @xmath161 ) , the resulting flow is a pure wind all over the galaxy , lasting for all the hubble time without any decoupling .",
    "all the gas is hot , and its mass  as is common in the wind phase  decreases steadily and is very low ( fig.3b , heavy line 4 ) .",
    "@xmath1 is also very low and decreases proportionally to the gas mass ( fig.3d , heavy dotted line 4 ) .",
    "@xmath126 is similar to that shown in fig .",
    "this run clearly shows how in a realistic flat model , even with a low @xmath104 , the flow can be in the wind phase during its entire evolution .",
    "we now briefly describe the behaviour of two models similar to c1 and d1 , but with different flattening ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the first ( c2 , @xmath139 , @xmath162 , @xmath163 ) is flatter than model c1 , and consequently has a lower @xmath11 .",
    "the resulting flow is a wind during all the time .",
    "this model ( with @xmath149 kpc ) is energetically very similar to d1 ( @xmath133 and @xmath158 kpc ) , as testified by their @xmath11 values , and its flow evolution is also similar .",
    "model d2 ( @xmath158 kpc , @xmath164 , @xmath165 , @xmath166 ) is obtained from d1 by decreasing its flattening . as a consequence",
    "the gas is more bound as testified by a @xmath11 similar to that of model c1 ( @xmath133 and @xmath149 kpc ) .",
    "the resulting evolution is similar to that of model c1 , with the flow inversion and the following development of a decoupled inflow around @xmath154 gyr .",
    "however , in this case no cold filaments are developed . in conclusion ,",
    "a very small change in the flattening can compensate for a variation of the characteristic scale length , showing again the strong sensitivity of models to variations of galactic structural parameters in the cdpr scenario .",
    "although the number of models we ran is not sufficient for an accurate statistical and quantitative analysis of the gas flow properties in flat and rotating galaxies , a qualitative comparison with the spherical models discussed in cdpr and with cooling flow models is possible ; it is also interesting to compare our results with recent observational findings ( pellegrini , held & ciotti 1997 ) .    in order to compare the behavior of s0 models with the equienergetical spherical models discussed in cdpr , we performed calculations for model galaxies with @xmath100 at the present epoch ( models a1-a2 ) .",
    "we stress again that while @xmath100 is a quite natural product of realistic spherical models , it turns out to be rather extreme for flat models . in any case , in flat models a clear x - ray underluminosity with respect to their spherical counterpart is found , mainly due to a drastic reduction of the hot gas mass .",
    "the amount of galactic rotation contributes only slightly to such a reduction .",
    "we also ran a few models with @xmath143 ( models b1-b2 ) .",
    "these have a remarkably low @xmath1 , in contrast with spherical cooling flows which in general show excessively high x - ray luminosities .",
    "although the model without rotation displays a present day @xmath1 similar to that of the rotating model , it was much more luminous in the past .",
    "as a consequence , with different choices of the structural and dynamical parameters , a large difference in the @xmath1 can be obtained . such a possibility is supported also by the models of bm , where different degrees of rotation lead to a spread in @xmath1 .    when the galaxy structure and dynamics are more similar to those of observed galaxies , and snia s are present , @xmath11 is low , and the galaxy is permanently in a global wind phase or loses a large amount of gas during a hubble time ; the flow decoupling takes place at late times , even for @xmath104 as low as 0.3 .",
    "the qualitative predictions made in cp are thus correct : it is much easier to extract gas from a flat , realistic galaxy model , than from a rounder system of the same @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath1 may span all the values in the range between that of a pure wind and approximately @xmath14 by , for instance , varying @xmath26 or the galaxy flattening , similarly to what happens for spherical models in the cdpr scenario for small variations of the model parameters .",
    "moreover , the x - ray underluminosity of flat galaxies can naturally be accounted for because their @xmath1 never reaches @xmath14 , even in the inflow phase .",
    "a possible explanation of the observations could be that at low @xmath0 , where the cdpr scenario predicts a significant number of objects to have an energy budget sufficient to unbind the gas , flat galaxies are preferentially found in the wind phase with respect to spherical galaxies of the same optical luminosity , while at high @xmath0 , where a significant number of galaxies contain inflows , the underluminosity of flat galaxies could be due to the underluminosity of their inflow phase , as found ( albeit for different reasons ) in our models and by bm .",
    "we computed also a few models ( not shown here ) with a different flattening of the dark matter distribution with respect to the stellar component .",
    "the results are qualitatively similar to those discussed above . as a general rule , for a given stellar distribution , a rounder halo increases @xmath11 and reduces @xmath167 .",
    "for example , a model similar to a1 but with a spherical halo @xmath168 , has @xmath169 and @xmath170 gyr ; a model similar to c2 but with a rounder halo @xmath171 , has @xmath172 and @xmath173 gyr .",
    "as expected , as the flattening of the dark halo increases , @xmath11 decreases and @xmath167 increases : for example , a model similar to d2 but with @xmath174 always remains in the wind phase , in accordance with the lower value of @xmath175 .",
    "we conclude that , on the basis of @xmath1 alone , it is not possible to decide whether the cdpr scenario or the cooling flow scenario is more suitable to describe the flows in s0s and es : both can reproduce the x - ray underluminosity of flat galaxies .",
    "the _ scatter _ in the @xmath176 diagram ( at a fixed optical luminosity ) is mainly produced by the galactic flattening ( and rotation to a minor extent ) in the cdpr scenario , and by the amount of rotation in the cooling flow models .    in any case , the current explanations of the observational results are unsatisfactory .",
    "in fact , pellegrini et al .",
    "( 1996 ) pose unsolved problems , especially concerning the explanation of the scatter in the @xmath8 diagram , as a function of the flattening and rotation .",
    "it is found that @xmath177 does not correlate with rotation and/or flattening . on the contrary , a very strong _ segregation _",
    "effect is found : only galaxies with small flattening and low @xmath178 show a scatter in @xmath2 , while flat objects and strongly rotating ones are systematically found only at low @xmath2 .",
    "the main factor in determining the @xmath2 segregation ( and scatter , as a consequence ) could be related to the _ slope _ of the galaxy surface brightness profile in the very center , as measured by hst observations ( pellegrini 1997 , and references therein ) .",
    "this would tell us that a _ nuclear _ origin for the x - ray behavior of early - type galaxies should be taken into proper account ( ciotti & ostriker 1997 ) .",
    "it is remarkable how the _ independently chosen _ separation of early - type galaxies in cuspy and core galaxies , a separation operated using only photometric criteria , reproduces exactly the segregation in the @xmath176 plane : while core galaxies show the entire scatter in @xmath1 at fixed @xmath0 , cuspy galaxies are invariably found only at low @xmath1 .",
    "other problems affect both the cdpr models and the cooling flow models .",
    "for example , the absence of massive cold disks in es seems to support the cdpr scenario , while the claimed very low metallicity in the hot gas is against it , because a low metallicity contrasts with the assumption of a non negligible value of @xmath104 .",
    "in fact , in principle , constraints on the snia rate can be given by estimates of the iron abundance in galactic flows ( see , e.g. , @xcite , and references therein ) . under the assumption of solar abundance ratios , the analysis of the available data suggests a very low iron abundance , consistent with no snia s enrichment and even lower than that of the stellar component ( ohashi et al . 1990 ; awaki et al . 1991 ; ikebe et al .",
    "1992 ; serlemitsos et al .",
    "1993 ; loewenstein et al . 1994",
    "; awaki et al . 1994 ; arimoto et al . 1997 ; matsumoto et al .",
    "this is rather puzzling , in that a value as high as @xmath91 agrees with the current optical estimates of the snia rates .",
    "however , some authors have found that more complex multi - temperature models with higher abundance give a better fit to the data ( kim et al .",
    "1996 ; buote & fabian 1997 ) .",
    "so , there are arguments on both sides of the abundance question , which is far from being a closed issue . in any case",
    "it is clear that the cdpr scenario is ruled out in case a null snia rate is clearly determined .",
    "an interesting feature of our models , that could be used to discriminate between the cdpr and the cooling flow scenario , is the spontaneous occurrence of the flow decoupling .",
    "this is at the origin of the striking feature of the transient cold filaments , which  if caught during their formation  should be observed first as soft x - ray emitting structures , and subsequently as h@xmath179 filaments . in model a1",
    "this takes place at @xmath180 gyr , while in model c1 ( the model with @xmath149 kpc but similar to a1 in all other input parameters ) it occurs at @xmath181 gyr .",
    "due to this sensibility to the galaxy structure , it is plausible that for a few galaxies the decoupling of the flow takes place at the present epoch , and so these h@xmath179 features could be observed .",
    "indeed , it is tempting to identify the transient cold filaments with the soft x - ray clumps ( @xcite ) or h@xmath179 filaments ( @xcite , trinchieri , noris , & di serego alighieri 1997 ) recently observed .",
    "we note how the size of the numerical and observed structures ( of the order of @xmath182 kpc ) are surprisingly similar .",
    "this could be an alternative explanation to the _ galactic drips _ proposed by mathews ( 1997 ) .",
    "a final comment is on the x - ray surface brightness distributions of the computed models .",
    "as already found by bm for cooling flow models , rotation is the key factor in determining whether @xmath126 is more or less round than @xmath127 , even in the presence of snia heating : rotation produces a flatter @xmath126 .",
    "a favourable feature of the cdpr scenario is that outflowing galaxies have rounder x - ray isophotes , which alleviates the problem of excessively flat @xmath126 profiles , affecting our cooling flow models as well as the models of km and bm .",
    "a detailed observational analysis of the relationship between optical and x - ray surface brightness for the e4 galaxy ngc 720 and s0 galaxy ngc 1332 has been carried out by buote & canizares ( 1997 , and references therein ) . while data for ngc 1332 are more uncertain , an analysis of the x - ray isophotes of ngc 720 shows that they are misaligned with and rounder than the optical ones .",
    "the authors conclude that the shape of @xmath126 is due to the flattening of the dark halo , which is higher than that of the stellar component .",
    "in fact , our simulations shows that , if rotation is the origin of flattening of the x - ray isophotes , then a @xmath183 flattening of @xmath126 with galactocentric radius is expected , at variance with the observations . on the other hand , in our simulations flatter dark halos produce ( during the inflow phase ) flatter x - ray isophotes , as expected .",
    "we have performed 2d numerical simulations of gas flows in s0 galaxy models with different flattening , following the same recipe for the input physics adopted in cdpr , and exploring the effects of different amounts of ordered rotation and snia energy injection rates , and structural parameters . as a general rule ,",
    "the woi sequence which occurs in the 1d models is replaced by a wind phase followed by a decoupled inflow .",
    "the main results can be summarized as follows :    \\1 . as expected models without snia heating ( @xmath144 ) host a cooling flow from the beginning .",
    "the flow is considerably ordered , and essentially all the gas lost by the stars is cooled and accumulated in the galactic center .",
    "if rotation is present , the cold material settles in a disk on the galactic equatorial plane .",
    "models with snia heating and @xmath122 at the present epoch , invert their flow much earlier than the spherical ones with the same energy budget . in particular , as the snia rate decreases , the flow tends to revert its motion starting from the galactic polar regions . in this phase of strong decoupling , cold filaments",
    "are created at the interface between inflowing and outflowing gas .",
    "this strongly unstable phase lasts @xmath184 gyr , after which the filaments are definitively accreted on the galactic center .",
    "later on , the turbulences are unable to create regions of very cool , dense gas . the temperature may however fluctuate and gas cooler than x - ray temperatures is present . in the rotating model , the presence of snia greatly reduces the formation of the cold disk . in general , less cold matter is present in these models ( @xmath185 ) than in those with @xmath186 ( @xmath187 ) .",
    "\\3 . models with realistic values of the dynamical quantities are characterized by low @xmath11 values .",
    "while for model d1 ( @xmath158 kpc , @xmath188 ) the flow is always escaping without displaying any interesting feature , in model c1 ( @xmath149 kpc , @xmath189 ) , the flow inversion occurs at @xmath190 gyr , and filaments form at @xmath155 gyr .",
    "of course , no cold mass is present in the first model ; in the second , @xmath191 of cold gas form a small disk .    \\4 . for any fixed value of @xmath104 , rotating models are x - ray fainter than the non - rotating ones , for the presence of the cold disk as well as for a different distribution of the hot gas .",
    "when compared to 1d models , 2d models are much fainter in the x - rays .",
    "the former flows , in fact , have @xmath1 similar to or even higher than @xmath14 after the flow inversion ; the latter , instead , always have @xmath192 .",
    "this is due to several combined factors : the loss of a snia energy fraction which is emitted by the gas below the x - ray temperature in high density regions ( which are much larger than in spherical models ) ; the loss of a snia energy fraction used by the gas still outflowing from the external regions of the disk ; the corresponding gravitational energy not released by this escaping material , and , for rotating models , the loss of thermalization of the gravitational energy of the cold disk .",
    "another main difference of the temporal evolution of @xmath1 is its noisy behaviour in 2d models .",
    "this is due to the presence of turbulence and to the formation of cold filaments .",
    "we have shown that the flattening of the galaxy in the cdpr scenario allows for a decoupling of the flow , in which different flow regimes are present in different part of the galaxy at the same time .",
    "we have found also that the flow decoupling is a general feature , i.e. , all our models , except those without snia heating and the model with @xmath11 substantially lower than unity , show a flow decoupling .",
    "we note however that the @xmath1 associated to a decoupled flow when @xmath20 , is not high : it is true , on the contrary , that _ the flows are decoupled even when @xmath193 _ , as the galaxy loses gas from the disk even with a low snia rate .",
    "so , the energetical analysis carried out by cp is shown to be qualitatively verified : objects with a low @xmath11 value are found preferentially at low @xmath1 , and at variance with the cooling flow models the effect of the flattening is shown to be important in determining the flow evolution .",
    "\\6 . for non - rotating ,",
    "inflow models , the edge - on @xmath126 is rounder than the corresponding @xmath127 of the parent galaxy ; when rotation is present , @xmath126 becomes flatter , and very similar to @xmath127 . for models with snia heating ,",
    "the @xmath126 morphology evolves with time , from a smooth , peanut - shaped geometry to a generally rounder shape than the stellar profile , through disturbed phases during the presence of cold filaments .",
    "when rotation is present , in the galagtic center the @xmath126 isophotes are somewhat flatter than @xmath127 , at variance with non - rotating models in which @xmath126 remains more spherical up to the center . as a general rule , even for low line - of - sight inclination angles over the galactic equatorial plane",
    ", the isophotes of @xmath126 and @xmath127 tend to become similar .",
    "all these new features considerably enrich the old cdpr scenario , and represent a step further in the direction of a more realistic simulation of a situation that is proving to be very complex . in future , we plan to perform numerical simulations of gas flows in models tailored on observed x - ray emitting s0 galaxies , in order to improve our understanding of the much richer phenomenology of aspherical gas flows .",
