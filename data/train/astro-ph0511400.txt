    "within the framework of cold dark matter ( cdm ) cosmology the formation of structure proceeds in a hierarchical fashion . at high redshifts , low - mass halos with virial temperatures less than @xmath7",
    "are abundant .",
    "the cooling of primordial gas in these halos is regulated by molecular hydrogen , as @xmath1 is the only coolant present in significant quantities that remains effective at temperatures below @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "@xcite developed analytic methods to model early baryonic collapse via @xmath1 cooling .",
    "numerical studies of the formation of primordial gas clouds and the first stars indicate that this process likely began as early as @xmath9 @xcite . @xcite",
    "further utilized simulations to develop a semi - analytic model based on the tegmark et al .",
    "( 1997 ) methods and included the effects of dynamical heating caused by the thermalization of kinetic energy of infall into a deepening potential .",
    "both approaches suggest that only gas in halos more massive than some critical mass @xmath10 will cool effectively .",
    "much of this work has recently been reviewed by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "population iii stars are the first potential producers of uv photons that can contribute to the reionization process and are the first producers of the metals required for the formation of population ii stars .",
    "an important question is whether small protogalaxies that formed within the relic regions left by these first stars could form stars themselves , or whether the elevated temperatures and fractional ionizations found in these regions suppressed star formation until larger protogalaxies formed . in a recent analytical study , @xcite argue that the first stars injected sufficient entropy into the early intergalactic medium ( igm ) by photoionization heating and supernova explosions to strongly suppress further star formation inside low - mass protogalactic halos in the affected regions . on the other hand , previous numerical work by @xcite and @xcite , as well as our own simulations of hot , ionized gas in small protogalactic halos , show that gravitational collapse mediated by @xmath1 cooling remains possible in such regions , within protogalaxies with masses above a certain threshold , implying that in these systems star formation is not strongly suppressed .",
    "a further form of negative feedback that must be taken into account comes from uv photons within the lyman - werner bands of @xmath1 , which are produced in large numbers by massive population iii stars and which can photodissociate @xmath1 , thereby quenching molecular hydrogen cooling and delaying the cooling and collapse of the primordial gas @xcite .",
    "metals produced by the first stars will also be injected into some fraction of the ionized volume , and so will be present in gas falling into new or existing protogalactic halos .",
    "the question then arises as to how this low level of metal enrichment affects the ability of the gas to cool and collapse .",
    "@xcite studied the collapse of cold , metal - enriched gas and argued that there exists a critical metallicity @xmath11 below which the gas fails to undergo continued collapse and fragmentation .",
    "however , their simulations did not allow for @xmath1 formation and @xmath1 cooling , which is expected to play an important role , unless the external uv background is extremely strong .",
    "also , by starting with cold gas , they implicitly assume that no extra entropy or energy has been added to the gas during its enrichment ; although , as @xcite have shown , this is unlikely to be the case .",
    "we reexamine this question using more appropriate initial conditions and a more detailed treatment of the cooling and chemistry of the metal - poor gas .",
    "we present simulations showing that metals play a dominant role in regulating the cooling of ionized gas in small protogalactic halos only for metallicities @xmath6 or greater . at lower metallicities ,",
    "the metals have little effect and the question of whether or not gas in a particular halo collapses is entirely determined by the amount of @xmath1 forming in that halo .",
    "we reach the same conclusion regardless of whether or not the gas is illuminated by a lyman - werner uv background , as in the absence of @xmath1 the metals themselves do not provide enough cooling to allow the gas to collapse .",
    "to help us to assess the influence of metals on the cooling and collapse of gas in small protogalactic halos , we performed a number of numerical simulations . during collapse , gas increases in density by several orders of magnitude , and",
    "so is best simulated by a numerical method with a high dynamical range .",
    "we therefore chose smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) .",
    "excellent overviews of the method , its numerical implementation , and some of its applications are given in reviews by @xcite and monaghan(1992 , 2005 ) .",
    "we use version 1 of the parallel code gadget , designed by @xcite .",
    "sph is a lagrangian method for simulating astrophysical flows , in which the fluid is represented by an ensemble of particles , with flow quantities at a particular point obtained by averaging over an appropriate subset of neighboring sph particles . as particle time steps in an sph code",
    "are constrained by the courant condition , they grow increasingly short as more particles cluster in high - density regions .",
    "replacing dense cores with artificial sink particles can therefore lead to a considerable increase in computational performance , allowing the dynamical evolution of the gas to be followed over many free - fall times . in the runs presented here we introduce sink particles according to the prescription of @xcite . sink particles are created once the density rises above @xmath12 and are endowed with an accretion radius of @xmath13 . on every time step ,",
    "any gas within this accretion radius that is gravitationally bound to the sink particle is accreted by it . the design and implementation of our sink particle algorithm",
    "is discussed in more detail in @xcite .",
    "we have further modified gadget to allow us to follow the nonequilibrium chemistry of the major coolants in both primordial and low - metallicity gas .",
    "our chemical model is a simplified version of the general model for low - density , low - metallicity gas presented in paper i @xcite . in our simplified network ,",
    "we follow the chemistry of twelve separate species : free electrons , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath1 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 . the more detailed model in paper",
    "i also follows the chemistry of @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , d , @xmath27 , and hd .",
    "however , the helium and @xmath26 chemistry are important primarily at temperatures @xmath28 , or if the gas is partially ionized by x - rays or cosmic rays , while the deuterium chemistry is only significant at temperatures @xmath29 , which are only reached in a few of our simulations , and so the neglect of these additional reactions reduces the computational cost imposed by the chemistry without significantly affecting our main results .",
    "the other simplification we made here compared to the model of paper i is the neglect of photochemical reactions involving photons more energetic than @xmath30 ; specifically , we omit the photoionization of @xmath16 , he , @xmath1 , o , and @xmath23 ( reactions 48 , 50 , 54 , 57 , and 59 in paper i ) .",
    "we omit these reactions because we assume that during the simulations , our model protogalaxies are shielded by the neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium from any external sources of ionizing radiation .",
    "a full list of reactions included in the chemical network used in the simulations presented in this paper is given in table  [ tab : chem_gas ] .",
    "further details ( including a discussion of why these particular reactions were chosen and full details of the rate coefficients used ) are given in paper i.    in implementing this chemical network within gadget , we made the decision to follow the nonequilibrium abundances of @xmath1 , @xmath14 , @xmath19 , @xmath21 , and @xmath23 and use conservation laws for charge and element abundance to track @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath18 , @xmath20 , and @xmath22 .",
    "the remaining two species , the @xmath15 and @xmath17 ions , have very short chemical equilibrium timescales and hence were assumed , for simplicity , to reach equilibrium instantaneously . to compute the rate of photochemical reactions ( such as the photodissociation of @xmath1 ) in runs in which an ultraviolet background is present , we assume a background spectrum that has the shape of a @xmath33 black body ( as should be typical of the brightest population iii stars ; see e.g.   @xcite ) , cut off at energies greater than @xmath30 to account for absorption by neutral hydrogen in the igm .",
    "we quantify the strength of the background by fixing the flux at the lyman limit : @xmath34 .",
    "a list of the resulting photochemical rates is given in table  [ tab : chem_gas_photo ] , computed using the cross sections listed in paper i.    if sufficient @xmath1 forms within the protogalaxy , it will begin to self - shield , reducing the effective photodissociation rate .",
    "an exact treatment of the effects of self - shielding is computationally infeasible , as it would require us to solve for the full spatial , angular , and frequency dependence of the radiation field at every time step .",
    "instead , we have chosen to incorporate it in an approximate manner .",
    "we assume that the dominant contribution to the self - shielding at a given point in the protogalaxy comes from gas close to that point , and so we only include the contribution to the self - shielding that comes from nearby @xmath1 .",
    "finally , we assume that ionization from x - rays or cosmic rays is negligible .",
    "previous work suggests that even if a low level of ionization from such sources is present , it will not have a major effect on the outcome of the collapse @xcite . in any case , the initial fractional ionization in our simulations is very much higher than could be produced by a realistic flux of x - rays or cosmic rays .",
    "a second major modification that we have made to the gadget code is a treatment of radiative heating and cooling . in primordial gas",
    ", we include cooling from three main sources : electron impact excitation of atomic hydrogen ( ly@xmath35 cooling ) , which is effective only above about @xmath36 ; rotational and vibrational excitation of @xmath1 ; and compton cooling .",
    "rates for ly@xmath35 cooling and compton cooling were taken from @xcite , while for @xmath1 rovibrational cooling we used a cooling function from @xcite .",
    "a number of different parameterizations of the @xmath1 cooling function have been used in the astrophysical literature , and so we show for reference in figure  [ h2cool ] how the @xcite rate compares with various of the other rates .",
    "in addition , in cases where the gas is metal enriched , we compute the amount of fine structure cooling coming from @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 . in this calculation",
    ", we include the effect of excitation of the fine - structure lines by the cmb , which prevents the gas from cooling below @xmath37 .",
    "we also include heating from @xmath1 photodissociation , following @xcite , and from the ultraviolet pumping of @xmath1 , following @xcite .",
    "we do not include cooling from hd , as this is only significant compared to @xmath1 at temperatures below @xmath38 .",
    "dense gas which reaches these temperatures in our simulations is very soon thereafter accreted by a sink particle , at which point its further temperature evolution can not be followed .",
    "we therefore do not expect that the lack of hd cooling in our models will significantly affect our conclusions .",
    "we also omit cooling from other primordial molecules and molecular ions ( e.g.  @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) , as these are unimportant at the densities and temperatures encountered in our simulations .",
    "heavy molecules such as @xmath41 are also omitted , as they form in significant abundances only at densities greater than those considered in this paper , as has already been discussed at length in paper i. a brief list of the thermal processes included in our simulations is given in table  [ cool_model ] ; further details , in particular of our treatment of fine - structure cooling , can be found in paper i.        we initialize each of our simulations with gas that is hot ( @xmath42k ) and fully ionized .",
    "the physical situation that these initial conditions are intended to represent is a protogalaxy forming within what @xcite term a fossil \" region , an region surrounding an ionizing source that has switched off , containing gas that has not yet had time to cool and recombine .",
    "prior to cosmological reionization , such regions should be relatively common , since the characteristic lifetime of the likely ionizing sources  massive population iii stars and/or active galactic nuclei  are significantly shorter than the hubble time .",
    "the initial temperature of gas in such a fossil region should , strictly speaking , depend on various factors such as the spectrum and strength of the ionizing source and the density of the gas .",
    "however , since the gas cools rapidly through ly@xmath35 cooling at the start of our simulations , and since the temperature at which ly@xmath35 cooling becomes ineffective does not depend on the initial temperature of the gas , we do not expect our results to be sensitive to small changes in the initial value of @xmath43 .    for our purposes",
    ", we do not need to follow the assembly history of the dark matter halo in which the protogalaxy resides , or to study the response of the dark matter halo to the cooling of the gas .",
    "therefore , we choose to model the influence of the dark matter halo ( hereafter simply the ` halo ' ) by using a fixed background potential .",
    "to construct this potential , we assume that the halo is spherically symmetric , with the density profile of @xcite : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a scale radius , @xmath46 is a characteristic ( dimensionless ) density , and @xmath47 is the critical density for closure . note that we use a value for the hubble constant of @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , we calculate the characteristic density and the scale radius from a given redshift and dark halo mass .",
    "we truncate the halo at the radius at which the value of @xmath49 given by equation  [ nfw - profile ] equals the cosmological background density at the beginning of the simulation . to simplify the discussion of our simulation results ,",
    "we take as a fiducial example a halo with a total mass @xmath50 and an initial redshift @xmath51 . for this example halo , the virial temperature @xmath52 , the virial radius @xmath53 , and the truncation radius @xmath54 , where both radii are given in physical units .",
    "the scale radius @xmath45 of this example halo is @xmath55 , and the full computational volume is a box of side length @xmath56 .",
    "in addition to this fiducial example , we also studied cooling and collapse in halos with various different masses in the range @xmath57 , at redshifts in the range @xmath58 .",
    "a complete list of runs is given in table  [ tab : run_params ] .",
    "we use periodic boundary conditions for the hydrodynamic part of the force calculations to keep the gas bound within the computational volume .",
    "the self - gravity of the gas and the gravitational force exerted by the dark matter potential are not calculated periodically , since we assume that other dark matter halos and their gas content are distant enough to neglect their gravitational influence .",
    "as we are dealing with a gravitationally bound system ( the dark matter halo ) that has decoupled from the hubble flow , we do not include the effects of cosmological expansion , and we perform our simulations using physical rather than co - moving coordinates .",
    "this simplification should be reasonably accurate for gas within the virial radius of the halo , although it will break down at larger radii .",
    "however , the behaviour of the gas at radii @xmath59 will have little effect on the evolution of the gas in the central regions of the halo , and since it is the latter that we are primarily concerned with in this paper , this simplification should be adequate for our current purposes .",
    "we begin our simulations with a uniform distribution of gas with an initial density @xmath60 , taken to be equal to the cosmological background density , and then allow the gas to relax isothermally until it reaches hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "note that this initial phase of the simulation is merely a convenient way of generating the appropriate initial conditions for the simulation proper , and so we do not include the effects of chemical evolution or cooling during this phase .",
    "the mass of gas present in our simulation was taken to be a fraction @xmath61 of the total mass of dark matter , where the dark matter density @xmath62 , and where @xmath63 is the baryon density and @xmath64 is the matter density .",
    "we take values for the cosmological parameters from @xcite of @xmath65 and @xmath66 , giving us a total gas mass of @xmath67 . here",
    ", @xmath68 is the sum of the halo mass and the mass of the dark matter background in the simulated volume . for our fiducial example , and for our example , @xmath69 . therefore , in this case @xmath70 .",
    "the number of sph particles used to represent the gas depends on the mass of the halo .",
    "we selected an appropriate particle number and particle mass by requiring that the number of particles used , @xmath71 , and the particle mass , @xmath72 , satisfied @xmath73 and @xmath74 respectively .",
    "our sph smoothing kernel encompasses approximately 40 particles and since we need twice this number in order to properly resolve gravitationally bound objects @xcite , our mass resolution , in the worst case , is @xmath75 .",
    "in some of the smaller halos we simulate , our mass resolution is significantly better .",
    "the values of @xmath71 and @xmath72 used for each of the different halo masses are summarized in table  [ tab : run_derived_vals ] , along with the corresponding values of @xmath76 and also the virial temperatures of the various halos .    at our sink creation density , @xmath77 exceeds @xmath78 as long as @xmath79 .",
    "this temperature is much smaller than that reached by the gas in our simulations , and so we always satisfy the @xcite resolution criterion by a comfortable margin in gas which has not been accreted by a sink .",
    "we studied the evolution both of zero - metallicity , primordial gas and of metal - enriched gas .",
    "the range of metallicities studied was @xmath80 .",
    "the value used in any particular simulation is summarized in table  [ tab : run_params ] . in particular",
    ", we performed a large number of simulations with @xmath81 .",
    "this value is an upper limit derived from qso absorption - line studies of the low column density ly@xmath35 forest at @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "estimates of the globally - averaged metallicity produced by the sources responsible for reionization are also typically of the order of @xmath83 ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "moreover , the fact that several hundred stars with @xmath84 < -3 $ ] have been observed in the galactic halo provides solid evidence that solar mass stars can form at this metallicity @xcite .",
    "we originally intended to examine the behaviour of the gas at even lower metallicities , but these additional simulations were rendered unnecessary by the fact that even at @xmath85 metal cooling proved to be of no importance at the low gas densities studied in this paper .    in our simulations of metal - enriched gas",
    ", we assume that mixing is efficient and that the metals are spread out uniformly throughout the computational domain .",
    "we also assume that the relative abundances of the various metals in the enriched gas are the same as in solar metallicity gas ; given the wide scatter that exists in observational determinations and theoretical predictions of abundance ratios in very low - metallicity gas , this seems to us to be the most conservative assumption .",
    "however , variations in the relative abundances of an order of magnitude or less will not significantly alter our results .",
    "as we discuss in paper i , substantial uncertainties exist concerning the presence , abundance , size distribution , and composition of dust grains in low - metallicity gas at high redshift .",
    "an exhaustive examination of the various possibilities would require an unfeasibly large number of simulations to be performed , and so we instead make the simplifying assumption that if dust is present , it has similar properties to milky way dust , but with an abundance that is a factor of @xmath86 smaller than the galactic value . to allow us to investigate the relative importance of the dust and the gas - phase metals , we perform simulations both with and without dust .      we also investigate the influence of a uv background .",
    "by @xmath87 , a considerable uv background may already have developed @xcite , particularly if cosmological reionization occurs at a redshift near the upper end of the range suggested by the _",
    "polarization results @xcite . to explore how the presence of a uv background will influence our conclusions , we have run simulations with uv field strengths of @xmath88 and 0.1 , as well as with no background present .",
    "simulations were run for @xmath89 hubble time , @xmath90 , which at @xmath91 corresponds to about @xmath92 . at times",
    "@xmath93 , individual dark matter halos can no longer be treated as isolated objects , since most halos will have undergone at least one major merger or interaction by this time . for our fiducial halo",
    ", the free - fall time @xmath94 varies between @xmath95 near the central cusp and @xmath96 in the outer envelope .    for ease of reference",
    ", we have given the runs discussed in the following sections simple alphanumeric identifiers .",
    "we have ( arbitrarily ) divided up our model halos into three size classes : `` small '' halos , with masses @xmath97 ; `` intermediate '' halos , with @xmath98 ; and `` large '' halos with @xmath99 .",
    "the first character of the identifier indicates with which of these classes the run in question is associated : `` s '' denotes a small halo , `` i '' an intermediate halo , and `` l '' a large halo .",
    "the next two digits in the identifier denote the initial redshift of the simulation .",
    "next , there follows a character denoting the metallicity : `` z '' corresponds to zero metallicity , while `` l , '' `` m , '' `` n , '' and `` s '' correspond to metallicities @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and 1 @xmath103 , respectively . following",
    "this is a number denoting the strength of the uv background : 1 corresponds to no background , while 2 and 3 correspond to @xmath88 and 0.1 , respectively .",
    "finally , runs in which dust is included have a `` d '' appended . to give an example : run i25-m3d is a run performed at redshift @xmath87 with an intermediate - sized halo that has a metallicity @xmath104 , an ultraviolet background field strength of @xmath105 , and that includes the effects of dust .",
    "before examining the behaviour of the metal - enriched gas , it is prudent to first examine what happens in the absence of metals , i.e.  in gas of wholly primordial composition .",
    "previous work suggests that there is a critical protogalactic mass @xmath106 such that gas in protogalaxies with @xmath107 is able to cool and collapse within a hubble time , while gas in protogalaxies with @xmath108 can not ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "to verify that we recover the same behaviour , we performed a set of three runs at @xmath109 with halo masses spanning a range of 2 orders of magnitude .",
    "the halos in these three runs , which we designate as s30-z1 , i30-z1 , and l30-z1 , had masses of @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 respectively . in figure",
    "[ mcrit ] , we show the time evolution of the mean number density and mean temperature within the scale radius  @xmath45 in these runs .    table  [ tab : run_results ] gives the properties of the gas within the scale radius after @xmath113 of evolution .",
    "the table lists the minimum central temperature  @xmath114 and the maximum central density  @xmath115 .",
    "we also calculate the fractional @xmath1 abundance with respect to the total number of hydrogen nuclei , and list the maximum central value , @xmath116 , in the table .",
    "the mass fraction of gas within a sink particle is denoted by @xmath117 . because we have no information on the density and temperature distribution within the sink particle radius , we adopt the values at time of sink particle formation in table  [ tab : run_results ] .",
    "note that as the gas in run s30-z1 does not collapse , it never reaches the density required for a sink particle to form .",
    "both figure  [ mcrit ] and table  [ tab : run_results ] clearly demonstrate the change in behaviour that occurs for increasing @xmath118 : gas in run l30-z1 cools and collapses very quickly , on a timescale @xmath119 , while gas in run i30-z1 cools and collapses on a slower timescale @xmath120 .",
    "finally , the gas in run s30-z1 cools , but not by enough to bring its temperature below the halo virial temperature , and so it does not collapse within a hubble time .",
    "indeed , we have run this simulation for @xmath121 longer than is shown in the plot , but find no evidence for collapse even after this extended period .",
    "we can therefore conclude that @xmath122 , with the value likely somewhere near the upper end of this range . for comparison",
    ", @xcite find that @xmath123 at @xmath109 ; @xcite find a significantly smaller value of @xmath124 at the same redshift ; and @xcite find that @xmath125 at @xmath126 .",
    "more recently , @xcite have shown that in their ensemble of simulations of primordial star formation , the mass of the first star - forming halo lies in the range @xmath127 , where the scatter appears to be a result of the sensitivity of the problem to the initial conditions .",
    "our own estimate of @xmath106 is in general agreement with these determinations , suggesting that our basic treatment of the physics of the primordial gas is sound .",
    "another area that we can explore with our zero - metallicity runs is the response of the gas to the presence of an ultraviolet background .",
    "previous work has shown that @xmath1 cooling of protogalactic gas is significantly affected once the strength of the background exceeds @xmath128 and that collapse in small halos is almost entirely suppressed for @xmath129 , owing to efficient photodissociation of the @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "we show in figure  [ jcrit ] an example of what happens in our own simulations as the strength of the background is increased . in the figure , we plot results from three runs performed at @xmath87 with halo mass @xmath130 .",
    "these runs are designated i25-z1 , i25-z2 , and i25-z3 and had uv background field strengths of @xmath131 and 0.1 , respectively .",
    "we see from the figure that the imposed uv background of strength @xmath132 in run i25-z2 delays collapse by more than @xmath133 compared to run i25-z1 , but that collapse does eventually occur . on the other hand , a further increase in the uv background field strength by a factor of 10 completely inhibits the collapse of the gas within the time frame of our simulation .",
    "these results are in good agreement with the previous studies cited above , further increasing our confidence that our basic modelling is sound .",
    "having established how primordial gas behaves in these conditions , we next examined the effect of enriching the gas with metals . as previously mentioned in   [ ic ] , we focussed initially on gas with a metallicity @xmath134 .",
    "this metallicity is at the upper limit of the range of values proposed for the so - called critical metallicity @xmath135 , the value of the metallicity at which efficient fragmentation and low - mass star formation is hypothesized to first occur @xcite .",
    "it is also comparable to the globally averaged metallicity produced by the sources responsible for reionization ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in the top panel of figure  [ rel - diff ]",
    "we show the time evolution of the relative difference between the central density in run i25-l1 and in i25-z1 .",
    "in other words , we plot @xmath136 , where @xmath137 and @xmath138 are the central densities in runs i25-l1 and i25-z1 , respectively .",
    "we plot this quantity to highlight the difference between the two runs , which would be difficult to discern in a more conventional comparison plot .",
    "we see that prior to sink particle formation , the central density of the two runs differs by less than 10% , and that at early times ( @xmath139 ) , the difference is less than 1% . in the bottom panel of figure  [ rel - diff ]",
    "we show a similar plot for the central temperature in the two runs .",
    "again , the difference between the two runs is very small .",
    "these results demonstrate that the cooling of the gas at low densities ( @xmath140 ) and high temperatures ( @xmath141 ) is barely influenced by the presence of metals : fine - structure cooling contributes only marginally to the total cooling rate , and the results of the runs agree to within 1% .",
    "the evolution of cooling during the first @xmath142 and the onset of collapse are thus almost independent of the metallicity of the gas , at least for gas with @xmath143 . at later times during the collapse , the difference between the metal - enriched and the zero - metallicity models becomes more pronounced , indicating that metal - line cooling is beginning to play a more significant role . despite this ,",
    "the behaviour of the gas in the two runs remains very similar up to the point at which sink formation occurs ( i.e.  at @xmath144 ) .    an obvious question to ask",
    "is whether these results are somehow peculiar to the particular combination of halo mass and redshift that we have chosen to examine . to investigate this",
    ", we performed additional simulations with both @xmath145 and @xmath146 for a range of different halo masses and redshifts , as summarized in table  [ tab : run_params ] .",
    "we found that in all cases we obtained similar results ; the thermal and dynamical evolution of gas in runs with @xmath147 differed very little from that of gas in runs with @xmath145 .",
    "we have also investigated the possibility that our results were significantly affected by our neglect of the effects of rotation in the majority of our runs .",
    "theoretically , we do not expect rotation to be important on scales @xmath148 , where @xmath149 is the dimensionless spin parameter , given by @xcite @xmath150 where @xmath151 is the total angular momentum of the halo , @xmath118 is the halo mass and @xmath152 is the total ( kinetic plus potential ) energy of the halo .",
    "previous work has shown that for halos with the range of masses and redshifts considered in this paper , @xmath149 has a lognormal distribution , with mean @xmath153 @xcite .",
    "therefore , we expect that rotation will only significantly affect the dynamics of the gas within the innermost few percent of the halo .",
    "as this is typically comparable to the radius at which we cease to be able to resolve the collapse of the gas , we do not expect the inclusion of rotation to significantly affect our results or to materially alter our conclusions .",
    "in order to verify that this is a reasonable expectation , we performed one simulation in which the initial gas distribution was given a non - zero angular momentum . within the virial radius of the halo ,",
    "the gas was placed into rotation with constant angular velocity . at larger radii ,",
    "the initial angular velocity decreased linearly with radius , reaching zero at the truncation radius of the halo .",
    "this run , which we designate hereafter as i25-z1-rot , had a spin parameter @xmath154 .",
    "the other parameters used for this run were the same as in run i25-z1 . in figure",
    "[ rot - plot ] , we compare the outcome of these two simulations .",
    "we see that , as expected , rotation has very little effect on the evolution of the gas at early times .",
    "it does appear to affect the evolution once the density exceeds @xmath155 , significantly slowing the collapse , but at this point we are close to the resolution limit of our simulation and so we are unable to say with any certainty whether or not a rotationally supported disk forms . nevertheless , as the main results of this paper concern the evolution of the gas at densities @xmath156 , it is clear that they are unaffected by our neglect of rotation in the majority of our simulations .",
    "if cooling from metals is ineffective when @xmath157 , then just when does it become important ? how enriched does the gas need to be before metal - line cooling makes a significant difference ? to investigate this , we performed a set of additional runs using our fiducial halo parameters ( @xmath87 , @xmath158 ) that looked at the effects of further increasing @xmath159 . in figure",
    "[ z - comp ] , we plot the time evolution of the central density and central temperature in runs i25-z1 , i25-l1 , i25-m1 , i25-n1 , and i25-s1 , which had metallicities of @xmath160 and @xmath161 , respectively . we also show in the plot the results of runs i25-l1d , i25-m1d , and i25-s1d , which had metallicities of @xmath162 and @xmath163 , respectively , and which differed from runs i25-l1 , i25-m1 , and i25-s1 by including the chemical and thermal effects of dust .",
    "it is clear from the figure that all of the runs with @xmath164 evolve in essentially the same way .",
    "some minor differences in the rate of collapse and in the central temperature of the gas are apparent at late times , particularly in the two runs with @xmath165 , but these do not appear likely to significantly affect the outcome of the simulation .",
    "if we enrich the gas by another order of magnitude , to @xmath166 , however , then we begin to see the metals playing a significant role in the cooling of the gas . in run",
    "i25-n1 the gas cools more rapidly than in any of the lower metallicity runs , and as a consequence , runaway gravitational collapse sets in approximately @xmath167 earlier than in the lower metallicity runs .",
    "nevertheless , the evolution of the gas in this run remains qualitatively very similar to that in the lower metallicity runs .",
    "it is only when we enrich the gas by a further order of magnitude , to solar metallicity , that we see a truly dramatic difference in the outcome of the simulation , with the gas in runs i25-s1 and i25-s1d cooling and collapsing within the first @xmath168 of the run .",
    "based on these results , we would estimate the critical metallicity at which metal cooling dominates in the low - density gas to be @xmath169 , to the nearest order of magnitude .",
    "figure  [ z - comp ] also allows us to assess the role played by dust in these systems .",
    "the fact that runs i25-l1d and i25-m1d produce essentially identical results to runs i25-l1 and i25-m1 demonstrates that at @xmath165 and below , dust has a minimal effect on the low - density evolution of these systems . on the other hand , at high metallicities , dust _ does _ significantly affect the evolution of the gas .",
    "although the presence of dust might be expected to aid the cooling of the gas , it is clear from figure  [ z - comp ] that in actual fact the gas cools more rapidly when dust is not present .",
    "this appears to be a consequence of the fact that the ionized gas recombines more rapidly when dust is present , owing to recombination of ionized hydrogen on the surface of dust grains , with the result that both the compton cooling rate , as well as the contributions of electron - ion and electron - atom collisions to the fine - structure cooling rate , fall off more rapidly with time .      finally , it is important to determine whether metal - line cooling allows collapse to occur in uv - irradiated halos that would otherwise be unable to collapse .",
    "figure  [ jcrit - z ] summarizes the results of a set of simulations designed to address this question .",
    "it shows the evolution of the central density and temperature of the gas in a set of runs in which @xmath105 , @xmath118 and @xmath170 were held constant at their fiducial values , and the metallicity was varied .",
    "details of the eventual state of the gas at the end of these runs are given in table  [ tab : run_results ] .",
    "we see that even at metallicities as high as @xmath165 , an ultraviolet background flux of strength @xmath105 is sufficient to completely suppress collapse .",
    "we therefore conclude that _ in low - metallicity , low - mass protogalactic halos , metal - line cooling can not initiate collapse_. either the surviving @xmath1 provides enough cooling to allow collapse to occur , irrespective of whether or not there are metals present , or the gas does _ not _ collapse . only at quite high metallicities ( @xmath171 )",
    "do the metals actually make an appreciable difference to the evolution of the gas .",
    "at first sight , the fact that fine structure cooling from metals has little impact on the thermal or dynamical evolution of the gas at metallicities below @xmath172 is somewhat surprising , given that @xcite found that gas with a metallicity of only @xmath147 could cool rapidly and fragment even in the complete absence of molecular hydrogen .",
    "however , comparison of the cooling time due to fine - structure emission with the free - fall time of the gas helps to make the situation clear .",
    "the cooling time due to fine - structure emission is given by @xmath173 where @xmath174 is the total cooling rate per unit volume due to fine - structure emission , @xmath175 is the temperature of the gas , @xmath176 is the adiabatic index , @xmath177 is the number density of the gas , and @xmath178 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "the free - fall time can be written as @xmath179 where @xmath180 is the gravitational constant and @xmath181 .",
    "the gas density @xmath182 can be written in terms of the number density @xmath177 as @xmath183 , where @xmath184 is the mean molecular weight of the gas .    in figure",
    "[ fig : ratio ] , we indicate the temperatures and densities at which @xmath185 for @xmath83 gas , for three different assumed fractional ionizations , with @xmath186 ( fully ionized gas ) , @xmath101 , and @xmath187 . in each case , we assume that the carbon and silicon are present only as @xmath188 or @xmath189 , since a fairly small external uv flux is sufficient to achieve this . in the @xmath186 case , we also assume that all of the oxygen is @xmath190 , since charge transfer between oxygen and hydrogen , which have nearly identical ionization potentials , ensures that @xmath191 . for the dark matter density @xmath192",
    "we adopt the value found at the center of our fiducial protogalactic halo at t=0 , @xmath193 . in the plot , regions to the left of the line have @xmath194 , while those to the right have @xmath195 .    at the beginning of our fiducial simulation , gas in the center of the halo",
    "has a temperature @xmath196 and a number density @xmath197 .",
    "it therefore lies outside of the regime where fine - structure cooling is efficient , and so it is not surprising that we find that metal - line cooling is initially unimportant .",
    "as the gas cools , whether through compton cooling or @xmath1 emission , and begins to compress as it falls into the halo , it moves towards the temperature and density regime in which fine - structure cooling is effective . as an example , we plot in figure  [ fig : ratio ] the trajectory in the density - temperature plane followed by gas at the center of the halo in run i25-l1 .",
    "however , at the same time as the gas is cooling and collapsing , it is also recombining .",
    "this causes the boundary of the efficient cooling regime to move to the right of the plot , towards higher densities .",
    "the physical reason for this shift is the fact that free electrons are much more effective than neutral hydrogen at exciting the @xmath19 and @xmath23 fine - structure lines , and so electron excitation dominates for @xmath198@xmath100 , depending on the temperature .",
    "the net effect is that fine - structure cooling remains of little importance until the gas is near the high - cooling regime .",
    "this only happens after considerable cooling and compression has already taken place , and therefore does not occur at all if @xmath1 cooling is ineffective , as is the case , for instance , in runs i25-z3 or i25-l3 .    for gas with a metallicity greater than @xmath199 ,",
    "fine - structure cooling is effective in a larger region of the density - temperature plane . at low densities ( @xmath140 ) ,",
    "an increase in @xmath159 of an order of magnitude shifts the solid lines in figure  [ fig : ratio ] by an order of magnitude with respect to density .",
    "this allows us to estimate the metallicity at which fine - structure cooling will dominate even in the initial low - density gas .",
    "we find that fine - structure cooling should dominate for metallicities in excess of @xmath200@xmath201 , depending on the details of the evolutionary trajectory followed by the gas at early times .",
    "this estimate agrees well with the results we obtain from our sph simulations .",
    "changes to the halo mass or redshift of collapse will affect this estimate in two ways .",
    "first , increasing the redshift of collapse will make the dark matter halo denser and will therefore decrease @xmath202 at early times , when dark matter is gravitationally dominant .",
    "this will shrink the region in which fine - structure cooling can effectively operate .",
    "second , altering the halo mass and redshift will alter the evolutionary trajectory followed by the gas . specifically , since the initial temperature of the gas is fixed at @xmath203 in these simulations , changes in @xmath118 or @xmath170 that increase the virial temperature of the halo will make the gas more gravitationally unstable , allowing it to collapse more quickly . the collapsing gas will therefore be hotter than in our fiducial case ( as it will have had less time to cool ) , and will also be slightly more ionized .",
    "on the other hand , if the virial temperature of the halo is lowered , then the gas will be more stable , will collapse more slowly , and will therefore be cooler and less ionized than in our fiducial case .",
    "however , in either case , we would not expect to see a change of more than a factor of a few in the critical metallicity required for effective fine - structure cooling at low densities , and our estimate should therefore still be of the correct order of magnitude .",
    "given these results , we next ask whether they can possibly be consistent with the results of @xcite , who find that in their simulations , fine structure cooling is effective even for @xmath204 , which is at least 2 orders of magnitude smaller than our value .",
    "in fact , their results do actually appear to be consistent with ours , despite the apparent disagreement .",
    "the reason is due to the difference in the initial conditions used for their simulations and for ours .",
    "the gas in their simulations has an initial temperature of 200  k at @xmath205 , and its temperature falls further due to adiabatic cooling in the igm prior to the formation of their simulated protogalactic halo at @xmath206 .",
    "since this halo has a mass of @xmath207 and a virial temperature @xmath208 , the temperature of the gas at the moment at which the halo forms is very much smaller than the halo virial temperature .",
    "consequently , thermal pressure is initially unable to prevent the collapse of gas into the halo .",
    "as it collapses , the gas heats up , and the thermal pressure eventually becomes large enough to halt the collapse .",
    "however , this does not occur until the gas temperature is approximately equal to the halo virial temperature , by which time the gas density has increased to a value @xmath209 .",
    "as can be seen from figure  [ fig : ratio ] , gas with this density and with a temperature of 5000  k lies close to or within the regime where @xmath195 ( depending on its fractional ionization ) , and so it is not surprising that @xcite find that fine - structure cooling is effective and that the gas can cool even in the complete absence of @xmath1 .",
    "it is also important to stress that @xcite do not find fine - structure cooling to be important at densities @xmath156 , as the almost adiabatic initial evolution of the gas makes clear .    for comparison ,",
    "our simulations start with a high initial gas temperature of @xmath203 and involve halos with virial temperatures @xmath210 ; for instance , @xmath211 in our fiducial simulation .",
    "this means that in our simulations , @xmath212 initially , with the result that thermal pressure support is important right from the start .",
    "indeed , at the beginning of our simulations pressure precisely balances gravity , by design .",
    "therefore , there is no initial phase of pure free - fall collapse as in the @xcite simulations .",
    "instead , significant gravitational contraction occurs only if the gas is able to cool to a temperature of order @xmath213 or below , which , since fine - structure cooling is initially ineffective , will only occur if enough @xmath1 can form in the low - density gas . at late times in our simulations",
    ", we would expect to see fine - structure cooling become more effective at lower @xmath214 , in line with what @xcite find , but unfortunately the required gas density is only marginally resolvable with our current simulations .    while the two sets of simulations therefore appear to be consistent with each other",
    ", a key question is obviously which set of initial conditions is more appropriate for describing the early evolution of small , metal enriched protogalaxies .",
    "we argue that it is difficult to see how intergalactic gas could become metal enriched without at some point being ionized .",
    "previous calculations have shown that the size of a typical region enriched by a population iii supernova is much smaller than the size of the @xmath0 region created by its progenitor star ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we would therefore expect our initial conditions to be more appropriate than those of @xcite for treating recently enriched and ionized regions .",
    "however , if enough time elapses following the enrichment event for the gas to be able to cool down to a temperature of a few hundred k , then the bromm et  al . ( 2001 ) initial conditions will be more appropriate . as @xcite show , this is most likely to occur in high - redshift gas with a low overdensity .",
    "then compton cooling is fast and highly effective and can cool the gas to @xmath215 within a recombination time . on the other hand , at lower redshifts , or at higher overdensities ,",
    "the gas recombines faster than it cools , and the temperature that can be reached by compton cooling alone is much higher .",
    "this is the case in our simulated halos .",
    "note that in either case the metals play no significant role in determining whether or not the gas is able to collapse .",
    "an important implication of these results is that if we are primarily concerned with investigating questions such as how @xmath10 evolves with redshift , or how uv feedback in the form of lyman - werner photons affects the ability of the gas to cool , then we need not worry about the effects of metal enrichment .",
    "this is because the thermal evolution of the gas on the scales of interest for these questions is completely dominated by compton cooling and/or @xmath1 cooling .",
    "therefore , results from studies such as @xcite or @xcite give a better guide to the behaviour of small , low - metallicity protogalaxies than might have been anticipated ( although the additional complications posed by the mechanical energy injected into the gas by regions and supernovae do of course still need to be taken into account ) .",
    "finally , it is important to stress that our results do not address the question of whether or not there is a critical metallicity @xmath216 above which fine structure cooling from metals allows efficient fragmentation to occur .",
    "this is because if fragmentation does occur , we would expect it to occur at densities @xmath217 , which are unresolved in our current simulations .",

    "<S> we study the influence of low levels of metal enrichment on the cooling and collapse of ionized gas in small protogalactic halos using three - dimensional , smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations . </S>",
    "<S> our initial conditions represent protogalaxies forming within a fossil @xmath0 region , a previously ionized @xmath0 region which has not yet had time to cool and recombine . </S>",
    "<S> prior to cosmological reionization , such regions should be relatively common , since the characteristic lifetimes of the likely ionizing sources are significantly shorter than a hubble time . </S>",
    "<S> we show that in these regions , @xmath1 is the dominant and most effective coolant , and that it is the amount of @xmath1 formed that determines whether or not the gas can collapse and form stars .    at the low metallicities ( @xmath2 ) thought to be associated with the transition from population iii to early population ii star formation , metal - line cooling has an almost negligible effect on the evolution of low - density gas , altering the density and temperature evolution of the gas by less than 1% compared to the metal - free case at densities below @xmath3 and temperatures above @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> although there is evidence that metal - line cooling becomes more effective at higher density , we find no significant differences in behaviour from the metal - free case at any density below our sink particle creation threshold at @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> increasing the metallicity also increases the importance of metal - line cooling , but it does not significantly affect the dynamical evolution of the low - density gas until @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> this result holds regardless of whether or not an ultraviolet background is present . </S>"
