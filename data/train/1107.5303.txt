    "a _ matchbox manifold _ is a compact connected metrizable space @xmath0 such that each point @xmath1 has a neighborhood homeomorphic to a product space @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is open and @xmath4 is a compact totally disconnected space .",
    "the term ` matchbox manifold ' originates from the works of aarts and martens @xcite , aarts and oversteegen @xcite for the case when @xmath5 , when local charts can be thought of as ` boxes of matches ' .",
    "the most well - studied classes of examples of matchbox manifolds are weak solenoids @xcite , generalized solenoids @xcite , and tiling spaces of aperiodic tilings with finite local complexity ( see , for instance , @xcite , or @xcite for a more general type of tilings ) . in this paper",
    "we consider a third class of examples , which we call _ graph matchbox manifolds_. this construction was introduced by kenyon and ghys @xcite , and later generalized by blanc @xcite , lozano rojo @xcite , alcalde cuesta , lozano rojo and macho stadler @xcite .",
    "the notion of a matchbox manifold is essentially the same as that of a _",
    "lamination_. the term ` lamination ' appears in the literature in two slightly different contexts : in low - dimensional topology , a lamination is a decomposition into leaves of a closed subset of a manifold ; in holomorphic dynamics , sullivan @xcite introduced riemann surface laminations as compact topological spaces locally homeomorphic to a complex disk times a cantor set .",
    "an embedding into a manifold is not required in the latter context , and a matchbox manifold is a lamination in this terminology .",
    "the concept of a _ foliated space _ as a generalization of a foliated manifold was introduced in the book by moore and schochet @xcite , where a foliated space is defined as a separable metrizable space locally homeomorphic to a product of a disk in @xmath6 and a separable metrizable space . in this terminology , a matchbox manifold is a foliated space with specific properties , i.e. it is a compact foliated space with totally disconnected transversals . in the present paper",
    "we follow terminology of candel and conlon @xcite , reserving the word ` lamination ' for a foliated space embedded in a manifold .",
    "we then use the term ` matchbox manifold ' to distinguish a class of foliated spaces which are compact and have totally disconnected transversals .",

    "one can define a partial action of the free group @xmath18 on @xmath12 , where @xmath19 is the cardinality of the set of generators @xmath8 .",
    "this action gives rise to a pseudogroup @xmath20 on @xmath12 , and an important feature of the construction is that the pseudogroup dynamical system @xmath21 can be realised as the holonomy pseudogroup of a smooth foliated space @xmath22 with @xmath23-dimensional leaves @xcite . by this construction , for @xmath24",
    "the corresponding leaf @xmath25 can be thought of as the two - dimensional boundary of the thickening of a quotient graph of @xmath14 , where the quotient map is determined by the geometry of @xmath14 .",

    "was mostly used to produce examples of matchbox manifolds with specific geometric and ergodic properties .",

    "therefore , @xmath35 contains a residual subset of recurrent leaves .    in order to prove theorem [ thm - globalleaf].(2 ) , we introduce the ` fusion ' construction which associates to any two transitive subsets @xmath51 and @xmath52 of @xmath35 a transitive subset @xmath53 such that @xmath54 .",
    "more precisely , given pointed graphs @xmath55 and @xmath56 such that @xmath57 and @xmath58 we give a recipe to construct a graph @xmath59 such that @xmath60 satisfies the required property .",
    "the underlying idea of the construction is very simple , but it gives us a powerful tool which allows us to obtain a lot of information about hierarchy and properties of graph matchbox manifolds .",
    "theorems [ thm - globalleaf].(2 ) and [ thm - globalleaf].(3 ) are the first applications of fusion .",
    "theorem [ thm - globalleaf].(2 ) is a direct consequence of the fusion .",

    "* theorem 3.5 ) with slightly eased assumptions , we conclude that the closure of such a chain contains a dense leaf , and if every element in the chain is distinct , this dense leaf accumulates on itself .",
    "the existence of a maximal closed recurrent subset in the space of graph matchbox manifolds follows by standard topological arguments , and , using fusion again , one argues that if a maximal recurrent subset exists , then it is unique , which is the statement of theorem [ thm - globalleaf].(3 ) .",

    "the fusion technique described earlier lies at the heart of the proof of theorem [ thm - infiniteleaves ] .    in the rest of the paper",
    "we make precise the hierarchy of graph matchbox manifolds , suggested by theorem [ thm - infiniteleaves ] , associating to them a quantifier of dynamical complexity , called _ level _ , inspired by the ideas of cantwell and conlon @xcite , hector @xcite , nishimori @xcite and tsuchiya @xcite .",
    "our main tool is the fusion technique of theorem [ thm - globalleaf].(2 ) .",
    "thus fusion provides the means to study the hierarchy of graph matchbox manifolds in @xmath35 given by inclusions .",
    "we also investigate how large is the set of matchbox manifolds realisable as graph matchbox manifolds .",
    "the study of the partial ordering given by inclusions of transitive subsets is a natural problem in topological dynamics .",
    "the consideration of the extension of the poincar recurrence theorem for flows to the closures of leaves of foliations began in the 1950 s .",
    "in foliation theory , the strongest results have been obtained for codimension @xmath66 transversally @xmath67-differentiable foliations by cantwell and conlon @xcite , hector @xcite , nishimori @xcite and tsuchiya @xcite .",
    "later , the extent to which these ideas carry on to the codimension @xmath66 @xmath68 case was studied by salhi @xcite , and , for foliations of higher codimensions satisfying certain additional conditions , by marzougui and salhi @xcite .",
    "cantwell and conlon @xcite introduced the notion of a _ level _ of a leaf or a transitive subset , which can be seen as a quantifier of dynamical complexity .",
    "a similar , but not the same notion of ` depth ' of a leaf was considered by nishimori @xcite .",
    "the theory of levels for @xmath67-foliations relies heavily on the kopell lemma @xcite , which does not apply in our setting .",
    "however , it is possible to introduce the _ level of a graph matchbox manifold _ , which is similar to the notion of a level in @xcite .",

    "theorem [ thm - infiniteleaves ] shows that the meager subset of leaves which are not dense in @xmath35 also contains leaves at infinite level , and we are now interested in those .",
    "definition [ defn - level ] allows for two types of matchbox manifolds at infinite level which are properly included in @xmath35 : we say that a matchbox manifold @xmath28 is at infinite level of _ type 1 _ if the union of leaves which are not dense in @xmath28 is dense in @xmath28 , and @xmath28 is a proper subset of @xmath35 .",
