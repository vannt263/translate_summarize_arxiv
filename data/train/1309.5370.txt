    "formally , gas temperatures vary by orders of magnitude throughout the disk .",
    "however , to first order , as a result of the abundance distribution and excitation of a given rotational transition , emission generally arises from a narrower range of temperatures .",
    "there are two ways temperatures can be estimated : 1 ) by observing optically thick lines originating from the same gas and measuring an average kinetic temperature of the emitting gas within the beam , or 2 ) by inferring temperatures from disk thermochemical models .    in the latter case",
    "we estimate a characteristic temperature of co by dividing up the _ emissive _ mass of the @xcite model into temperature bins for both c@xmath2o and hd , figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    ".[fig2 ]    to compute the emissive mass we : following the @xcite tw  hya model , for each temperature bin integrate the mass in hd @xmath63 and in c@xmath2o @xmath64 _ in the upper state _ within the specified temperature range , and normalize this to the total mass throughout the disk in the corresponding upper state for each species , i.e. , @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the upper state volume density calculated from the lime excitation models @xcite performed for hd in b13 .",
    "one notable feature of figure  [ fig2 ] is that the two lines have slightly different peak maximally emissive temperatures , @xmath67  k for c@xmath2o and @xmath68  k hd . however , over the temperature range expected for hd , the difference in the ratio of fractional populations for hd and c@xmath2o is not enough to bring the co abundance close to 10@xmath69 using equation  [ eq : abu ] .    guided by this range of temperatures ,",

    "both scenarios are unlikely ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) and unsupported by the @xmath11co data @xcite .",
    "alternatively , @xmath11co emission can constrain the temperature in the layers where its emission becomes optically thick . using the resolved band 6 tw  hya alma science verification ( s.v . ) observations of @xmath11co  ( @xmath3 ) ,",
    "the peak beam temperature is 24.5  k within a 2@xmath7839 ( @xmath79 ) beam .",

    "data of the co ( @xmath81 ) line and the observations of @xcite for co  ( @xmath82 ) ( @xmath83  k and @xmath84  k respectively ) . under these conditions ,",
    "the co abundance traced is less than @xmath85 .",
    "we conclude that it is difficult for excitation alone to reconcile the emission with a co abundance of 10@xmath69 .",
    "the analysis above assumes hd and co emit from similar regions and therefore trace the gas - phase @xmath10(co ) directly . in the following section we relax this assumption and discuss various physical mechanisms that could modify the interpretation of the measured @xmath10(co ) .",
    "[ caveats ]      in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we illustrate some of the key issues concerning the above discussion .",
    "first , while hd is spatially distributed broadly , gas - phase c@xmath2o is not , freezing onto dust grains with @xmath86  k. because of the strong temperature dependence in the boltzmann factor for the @xmath87 state , we would expect the hd emission to be sharply curtailed below @xmath88  k. for a massive midplane , some hd emission could arise from dense gas directly behind the co snow - line ( shown as magenta ) , but the hd emissivity from such cold gas is lessened by the fact that adding more mass ( or enriching the dust ) would increase the dust optical depth at 112  @xmath89 m , hiding some fraction of the hd emission .",
    "furthermore , this emission can not contribute significantly to the observations as it would drive the h@xmath7 mass to unrealistically high levels .",
    "for example , if @xmath90% of the hd  ( @xmath1 ) emission arises from gas at 15  k , the h@xmath7 mass at this temperature is 0.05  m@xmath91 in addition to the contribution from the rest of the disk .",
    "therefore it is difficult for the 15  k mass to add appreciably to the emission without driving the disk to extremely high masses .",
    "another likely scenario is where the hd gas emits from primarily warm gas in the innermost disk , while co and c@xmath2o trace cooler emitting regions and thus larger physical radii . as a result",
    ", co would trace more gas ( full disk ) than hd ( warm inner disk ) . consequently",
    ", hd  ( @xmath1 ) would miss h@xmath7 mass in the outer disk , resulting in a lower limit to the disk mass estimation and in turn an overestimate of @xmath10(co ) .",
    "the co abundance could hence be lower .",
    "in addition , it is important to note that in b13 the authors find the outer disk does not emit appreciably , with only @xmath92 of the hd flux coming from outside of 100  au ( see their fig .",
    "2c ) based upon the model of @xcite .",
    "previous studies have attributed measured low co abundances to gas - phase depletion by adsorption onto grains @xcite . under normal conditions",
    "co freezes - out at low temperatures present in the midplane , @xmath93  k , where hd does not strongly emit , and therefore the reduced measured @xmath10(co ) in the gas - phase is unlikely to be the result of freeze - out .",
    "in fact a number of studies find the measured co antenna temperatures of @xmath94  k @xcite . if these estimates are correct , then the total volume of gas traced by the c@xmath2o line exceeds that traced by the hd line , leading to an over - prediction of the true @xmath10(co ) .",
    "there is , however , uncertainty in the freeze - out temperatures , which depend formally on the binding energies assumed .",
    "the binding energies are a function of the binding - surface , often assumed to be co ice . alternatively ,",
    "if the grain surface is water ice or bare dust , the binding energy can be significantly higher @xcite . if this is the case , co can freeze - out at higher temperatures @xmath95  k , and therefore the co emitting region would be smaller than the hd emitting region . in this instance",
    "the measured co abundance would be lower than the true co abundance .",
    "another caveat of our @xmath10(co ) estimates are the opacities of the hd  ( @xmath1 ) and c@xmath2o  ( @xmath3 ) lines . in this study , we assume that emission of both species is optically thin .",
    "although we show in sec .",
    "[ sec : opa ] that the c@xmath2o  ( @xmath3 ) emission is thin in the disk - averaged data , the possibility of optically thick hd emission still remains .",
    "however , if @xmath96 , the derived hd mass should be a lower limit and therefore the measured @xmath10(co ) is an upper limit on the true co abundance .",
    "photodissociation by uv is a major co destruction mechanism in disks that regulates the molecular abundance of species in the gas .",
    "photodissociation models for hd and co isotopologues have been investigated by @xcite .",
    "@xcite finds hd should self - shield at smaller @xmath97 than co. therefore , in the absence of dust shielding and selective isotopologue photodissociation , hd could emit from warm layers where c@xmath2o is destroyed . if those surface layers are essential contributors to the hd emission , @xmath10(co ) would be underestimated .",
    "however , the modeling of b13 suggests that the high surface layers do not dominate the emissive mass of hd , and therefore , even if photodissociation can not be ruled out , it only minimally affects the measured @xmath10(co ) .",
    "alternatively , if selective isotopologue photodissociation operates for c@xmath2o from external uv irradiation , we may be missing co mass from the outer disk edge . as discussed in section [ sec : der ] , however , the outer disk does not significantly contribute to the hd emission .",
    "our study shows that the main reservoir of gas - phase carbon , co , is reduced by at least an order of magnitude in the tw  hya disk compared to dense clouds . in both t - tauri and herbig ae disks",
    "similarly low co abundances have been inferred and attributed to photodissociation and freeze - out ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the difference between the previous studies and the results reported here is the use of hd to probe h@xmath7 above 20  k and hence provide stronger constraints on @xmath10(co ) in the warm molecular layer .",
    "it is important to state that _ both _",
    "c@xmath2o and hd do not trace the midplane of the disk because of freeze - out ( c@xmath2o ) and low excitation ( hd ) .",
    "thus it is possible that the @xmath10(co@xmath98 ) is `` normal '' in the midplane , which would be consistent with the similarity between interstellar ices and cometary volatiles @xcite .",
    "we argue differences in photodissociation of c@xmath2o and hd are unlikely to account for the low @xmath10(co ) .",
    "this would argue against the possibility that the carbon is sequestered in atomic form either neutral or ionized .",
    "@xcite supports this assertion with observations of all primary forms of carbon in a be star disk ( hd  100547 ) .",
    "they argue the total carbon abundance is depleted in the warm atmosphere , which is consistent with our conclusion .",
    "this finding leads one to ask where the missing carbon might be found .",
    "one possibility is suggested by the modeling of kinetic chemistry in disks by @xcite .",
    "the deep disk layers are exposed to x - rays from the central star @xcite , though likely not cosmic rays @xcite . in these layers",
    "co can exist in the gas via thermal- or photo - desorption from grains .",
    "x - rays produce he@xmath99 and , with sufficient time , carbon can be extracted from co via reactions with he@xmath99 .",
    "co reforms , but a portion of the carbon is placed into hydrocarbons ( c@xmath100h@xmath100 ) or co@xmath7 .",
    "many of these species have freeze - out temperatures higher than co and trap the carbon in ices . in a sense the chemistry works towards the first carbon - bearing molecule that freezes - out , creating a carbon sink @xcite .",
    "therefore we suggest that the low measured gas - phase co abundance in the tw  hya disk is a result of this chemical mechanism , and the use of co as a mass tracer has very significant , and likely time - dependent , uncertainty .",
