    "finally , in section  [ computer ] , we present some computational results concerning the existence of ( complete ) kneser transversal lines to tetrahedra in configurations of @xmath21 points in @xmath57 . providing thus a further insight on the relation between kneser transversals and complete kneser transversals .",
