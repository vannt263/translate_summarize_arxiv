    "von karman periodic boundary conditions , the cyclic translational subgroup , which commutes with the effective one  electron hamiltonian , contains @xmath9 translations by corresponding direct lattice vectors @xmath10 .",
    "this abelian subgroup has @xmath9 one  dimensional irreducible representations , which are labeled with wavevectors @xmath11 within the first brillouin zone ( bz ) . therefore ,",
    "extended bloch states @xmath12 in this description are classified with two quantum numbers , the band index @xmath13 and the crystal  momentum @xmath11 , and are obtained by diagonalization of the effective one  electron hamiltonian .",
    "an alternative description can be derived in terms of localized wannier functions  @xcite ( wfs ) @xmath14 , which are defined in real space via a unitary transformation performed on the bloch functions .",
    "they are also labeled with two quantum numbers , the orbital index @xmath15 and the direct lattice vector @xmath10 indicating the unit cell they belong to .",
    "in contrast to bfs , wfs are useful , for example , in visualizing chemical bonds or in describing the dielectric properties of non  metallic materials .",
    "they can be considered as the generalization to solids of the concept of `` localized molecular orbitals '' for finite systems  @xcite . however , one major problem in practical calculations within this representation is the non  uniqueness of wfs , related to the phase arbitrariness of the bfs , and to the arbitrary unitary transformations which can be performed on the bfs at any given @xmath11point in the bz .",
    "as demonstrated recently by marzari and vanderbilt  @xcite , this non  uniqueness can be resolved in principle by imposing the further condition of maximal localization .",
    "however , some residual arbitrariness remains , related to the choice of the localization criterion .",
    "the late transition  metal ( tm ) monoxides mno , feo , coo , and nio challenge the theory of electronic states since several decades .",
    "these highly correlated materials feature a mott insulator character , and the conventional local  spin  density ( lsd ) scheme  @xcite gets into difficulties with the localized tm @xmath1orbitals , predicting in particular incorrectly their spectral weight and their energy relative to o  @xmath16 states .",
    "all these oxides have the rocksalt structure in their paramagnetic phase , while below the neel temperature @xmath17 , a type ii antiferromagnetic ( afm ) ordering occurs  @xcite .",
    "the experimentally well  documented compound mno , which is considered to be in the intermediate charge  transfer / mott  hubbard regime , is a particularly suitable case study , since the available theoretical schemes apply best to this material . indeed ,",
    "because of the exchange stabilization of its half  filled @xmath1 shell , even lsd predicts its insulating character , although the corresponding energy gap and magnetic moment are much smaller than experimental data .",
    "several electronic structure calculations have been performed for mno , using traditional band  structure schemes , like unrestricted hartree ",
    "fock ( uhf )  @xcite and local  spin density ( lsd ) , as well as more innovative approaches taking into account at various levels the large value of the on  site coulomb repulsion for the metal 3@xmath1 states , like the sic  @xcite and the lsd + @xmath0  @xcite methods , and the more recent model @xmath18 scheme  @xcite . among the quantities calculated within the latter approach",
    ", special attention has been devoted to the quasi  particle spectrum  @xcite , and recently to the zone  center optic phonon frequencies and the born effective charge tensor  @xcite .",
    "comparison with experimental data of the various physical quantities computed in the different schemes , has demonstrated a monotonic trend with the separation energy between occupied and empty @xmath1 bands , which is too small within lsd , too high within uhf , and has about the correct value within model @xmath18 .",
    "this energy separation is strongly related to the on  site interaction @xmath0 .",
    "the analysis of all these results , has been performed in terms of the extended bloch states .    on the other hand , no _ ab ",
    "investigation exists of the electronic states in afm mno in terms of localized wannier functions . keeping in mind the inherent limitations of the mean  field one  particle approaches",
    ", it would be however instructive to materialize within the wfs description how superexchange ( which is responsible for afm ordering ) manifests itself in a first ",
    "principles one  electron picture .",
    "furthermore , the maximal localization method of marzari and vanderbilt   has been applied in the past to several periodic systems  @xcite , but not yet to a low ( trigonal ) symmetry solid like afm mno , nor to a compound with partially filled cation @xmath1 shell .    motivated by the above reasons , we present in this work an _ ab ",

    "we have also used the lsd + @xmath0 method , implemented with the same flapw technical ingredients  @xcite used in the lsd computations .",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : method ] we give technical details of the flapw implementation , and structural informations relevant to afm mno .",

    "[ sec : concl ] we draw our conclusions .",
    "all quantities presented and discussed in this paper have been computed using the semirelativistic flapw method  @xcite , expanded with local orbitals  @xcite ( lo ) where appropriate .",
    "inclusion of lo s in addition to the normal flapw basis enforces mutual state orthogonality and increases variational freedom .",
    "this allows to treat the semicore mn  @xmath19 , @xmath20 states together with the valence states , and helps in dealing with the linearization of mn  @xmath21 and o  @xmath22 , @xmath16 states .",
    "core states are calculated fully relativistically and self  consistently in the crystal potential . for the lsd calculations , the hedin and lundqvist exchange  correlation functional has been adopted . in the calculations performed within the lsd + @xmath0 method , the values of the hubbard and exchange constants , @xmath23 ev and",
    "@xmath24 ev , have been taken from ref .  .",
    "the atomic  sphere radii for mn and o are chosen to be 2.0 and 1.8 a.u .",
    ", respectively , and the flapw basis size is set to include all plane waves with energy up to 16.0 ry .",
    "four special points inside the irreducible wedge of the bz were used for evaluating the charge density during self  consistency cycles .",
    "afm ordering occurs in mno below @xmath25  k along any one of the @xmath26 directions .",
    "the transition is accompanied by a small crystallographic distortion that transforms the cubic structure into a rhombohedral one  @xcite : the @xmath27 angle between the lattice vectors increases only by @xmath28 .",
    "we have shown  @xcite earlier that the effect of this distortion on the calculated zone  center optic phonon frequencies and born effective charge tensor is negligible compared to the anisotropy induced solely by the magnetic order .",
    "therefore , throughout the present study we use the ionic positions of the perfect rocksalt chemical cell , with the experimental lattice constant value @xmath29  . in the afm phase ,",
    "the magnetic moments of mno are arranged into ferromagnetic sheets which are parallel to ( 111 ) , while the direction of magnetization in neighboring planes is reversed .",
    "the magnetic and crystalline structure of mno is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . the rhombohedral magnetic cell , whose volume is twice that of the paramagnetic rocksalt one , corresponds to the space group d@xmath30 .",
    "several choices for the primitive translation vectors are possible . however , in order to minimize discrete mesh effects in @xmath11space integrations , and also for taking advantage of symmetry properties ( see below ) , we consider here the following primitive translation vectors ( in the cubic coordinate system ) : @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 .",
    "the two equivalent anions o@xmath2 and o@xmath5 , whose site symmetry is c@xmath34 , are located at positions @xmath35 , while the two non  equivalent cations mn@xmath2 ( spin  up ) and mn@xmath5 , whose site symmetry is d@xmath36 , are at @xmath37 and @xmath38 . with our choice of origin on mn@xmath2 , the two oxygen sites are therefore related by spatial inversion .    , mn@xmath5 , and o@xmath39 sites are given by large black , large grey , and small open circles , respectively .",
    "the trigonal coordinate axes are also indicated with long ",
    "dashed lines.[fig1 ] ]      we consider the general case of a _ composite group _ of energy bands labeled by their band index @xmath40 , and connected among themselves by degeneracies along high symmetry lines , but isolated from all other bands at lower and higher energy . the phase arbitrariness ( gauge dependence ) of each @xmath41 with respect to the set of allowed @xmath11 values propagates to the corresponding wannier functions @xmath42 , labeled by @xmath43 and lattice vectors @xmath10 .",
    "this resulting non  uniqueness manifests itself trough an arbitrary unitary matrix @xmath44 appearing in the most general transformation between bfs and wfs , which is given by @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the real  space primitive cell volume .",
    "a direct consequence of this arbitrariness is that linear combinations of the wfs in the set @xmath47 also form a suitable basis .",
    "the strategy of ref .   is to pick out from this arbitrary choice of wfs , the particular set which is maximally localized according to some criterion .",
    "once this criterion has been chosen , and the composite group of bands specified , the search for the set of maximally localized wfs becomes a problem of functional minimization in the space of the matrices @xmath48 .",

    "in these expressions , @xmath52 is a periodic function which can be obtained from the bloch functions of the composite group of bands .",
    "practically , one calculates the bfs on equispaced monkhorst ",
    "pack  @xcite meshes of @xmath11 points in the unit cell @xmath53 ( whose volume is equal to the conventional bz one ) , built on the reciprocal lattice vectors .",
    "the grids have been offset in order to include @xmath54 . with our chosen cell geometry of mno ,",
    "the reciprocal lattice vectors are : @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 .",
    "we then express the matrix elements of the gradient @xmath58 appearing in the localization functional in terms of finite differences .",
    "as shown in ref .  , the only information needed is the overlap matrix @xmath59 , where @xmath60 are vectors connecting each mesh point to its nearest neighbors . from these quantities ,",
    "the gradient of the spread functional @xmath61 with respect to an infinitesimal unitary transformation @xmath62 of the bfs can also be evaluated .",
    "once this gradient is computed , the minimization can take place via a steepest descent or conjugate  gradient algorithm .",
    "it is important to stress that if the minimum of @xmath61 is flat ( as it will be shown to be the case for some of the mno wfs ) , its precise location may be hindered by the various numerical approximations involved in the calculations . in this work , we have especially taken care of the following features , which clearly become irrelevant in the limit of a dense mesh ( @xmath63 , @xmath64 ) : ( i ) the regular mesh @xmath65 has been chosen in order to have the lattice symmetry , _ i.e. _ it transforms into itself by application of the point group operations @xmath66 of the crystal ; ( ii ) the shell of @xmath60 vectors used in the finite  difference formula for @xmath67 has been constructed on the 12 vectors of type @xmath68 and @xmath69 ( in internal units ) .",
    "they are the sides midpoints of cubes which can be built on particular points of the rhombohedral mesh , and this set of 12 points is therefore compatible with the highest possible symmetry .    finally , and following the procedure described in eqs .",
    "( 62)(64 ) of ref . , we start the minimization procedure by constructing a set of `` trial functions '' in the unit cell , which are an initial guess of the final wfs .",
    "we use gaussians centered on atomic sites and modulated by an appropriate combination of spherical harmonics , with a rms width value such that the gaussian is negligible outside the corresponding atomic sphere . a unitary rotation among the initial bfs",
    "is then performed in order to maximize their projection on the trial functions .",
    "it has been shown  @xcite that wannier functions can be chosen with well  defined symmetry properties , and forming ( generally reducible ) representations of the crystal point group . in order to investigate the nature and possible reductions of these representations in the case of mno , and also to be in the position to use group  theory methods for further analysis ,",
    "we need to calculate the representation matrix elements latexmath:[$\\langle w_{n'\\mathbf{0 } }    transformation operator corresponding to the operation @xmath66 of the point group , and the wfs are in the central cell . for simplicity",
    ", we restrict the formalism to symmorphic space groups ( which is actually the case for d@xmath71 ) . using eq .",
    "( [ wf_i ] ) with the @xmath11 points discretization and @xmath72 , we have for the rotated wannier function @xmath73 and , with the `` periodic gauge '' condition @xmath74    @xmath75    the last braket is trivial only in the case of non  degenerate bfs . in the general case , on the other hand , we have @xmath76 where @xmath77 is a unitary transformation associated with the symmetry operation @xmath66 , and the summation is over states degenerate with @xmath78 . if this latter state is non  degenerate , @xmath79 , and eq .  ( [ bloch ] ) becomes the usual formula .",
    "we note that the above formulas allow to decompose @xmath80 into a linear combination of basis functions transforming according to the relevant irreducible representations of the point group .",
    "for our wannier  function description of the electron states in afm mno , we have considered as a single composite group the topmost thirteen valence bands ( o  @xmath22 , o  @xmath16 , mn  @xmath21 ) . in this way , the corresponding wannier functions display the highest localization , and therefore can be considered as the `` elementary building blocks '' of the occupied electron states . as it is convenient to interpret some of our results in terms of combinations of atomic orbitals , we give in table  [ table1 ] the relevant o@xmath81 representations corresponding to @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath1 orbitals and their reduction into irreducible representations of d@xmath36 and c@xmath34 , together with their corresponding basis .",
    "cartesian coordinates in the parent cubic reference system are written using @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 symbols , while @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 correspond to the trigonal reference system ( @xmath87 axis along the cubic [ 111 ] direction ) . throughout this work ,",

    "the total spread ( sum of the 13 individual spreads ) is 9.332 @xmath90 .",
    "we note also that the sum of centers has all cartesian components equal to zero .",
    "indeed , this quantity represents the electronic polarization ( modulo a lattice vector ) corresponding to valence states , and has to be zero as the system is centrosymmetric . in order to analyze in detail table  [ table2 ] , it is useful to construct the matrix elements of the representation of the symmetry operations of the d@xmath36 point group on the basis of the 13 wannier functions .",
    "this is done by using eq .",
    "( [ warep ] ) .",
    "first , we have verified by constructing the multiplication table that these 12 matrices form indeed a representation of d@xmath36 . for non  trivial operations of the point group d@xmath36",
    ", they display the following structure : ( i ) there is an 8@xmath918 block corresponding to o  @xmath22/@xmath16 wannier functions .",
    "each line of this block consists of zeros , except for one element which is equal to 1 .",
    "because the origin is on the mn@xmath2 site , the operations of d@xmath36 are simply transforming all wfs on _ both _ o sites into each other ; ( ii ) there is a 5@xmath915 block corresponding to mn@xmath2  @xmath21 wannier functions .",
    "this block does not display a well  defined structure , and in general all its elements are non  zero ; ( iii ) the two off  diagonal blocks ( connecting o  @xmath22/@xmath16 and mn@xmath2  @xmath21 wfs ) have all their elements equal to zero , at an accuracy better than @xmath92 .",
    "therefore , the 13@xmath9113 representation is block  diagonal , and in particular the 5@xmath915 mn@xmath2  @xmath21 block makes a ( reducible ) representation by itself .",
    "we discuss first the o  @xmath22/@xmath16 wannier functions . the two non  equivalent wfs corresponding to site o@xmath2",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , with a viewpoint which is about the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . the equivalent wfs corresponding to site o@xmath5 can simply be obtained by inversion symmetry with respect to the origin . in the absence of discrimination between mn@xmath2 and mn@xmath5 sites",
    ", the oxygen site would have cubic ( o@xmath81 ) symmetry , and the 4 converged wfs originating from @xmath3 and @xmath4 states on the same o@xmath2 site would be @xmath6 hybrids .",
    "this is a general result , which is demonstrated in appendix  [ sec : app_a ] : from localized atom  centered @xmath3@xmath4 orbitals , the maximal localization algorithm always favors @xmath6like wannier functions , provided that the symmetry is cubic or higher .",
    "this situation occurs , _",
    "e.g. _ , in a hypothetical ferromagnetic ( fm ) mno crystal , which will be briefly described later . in afm",
    "mno , mn@xmath2 and mn@xmath5 sites are non  equivalent , so that the symmetry of the oxygen site is reduced to c@xmath34 .",
    "however , reminiscence of the @xmath6 hybrids persists : disregarding for the moment the @xmath1 admixture , we see in panel ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] that the wf 1 , with @xmath93 symmetry , displays clearly the shape of a non ",
    "symmetric @xmath94 orbital , with its center shifted from the atomic site along the [ 111 ] direction ( @xmath94@xmath3 mixing ) , as also indicated in table  [ table2 ] .",
    "the three other wfs are equivalent to each other under the operations of c@xmath34 ( they have the same spread ) , and their centers are located much closer to the cubic axes than to the diagonals .",
    "this can be explained by considering the interaction with the @xmath21 orbitals of mn@xmath5 : all these wfs display a substantial bonding @xmath21 contribution from the three neighboring unoccupied mn@xmath5 sites . as the first ",
    "neighbor shell of mn sites is an octahedron centered on each o , the above interaction favors the orientation of the equivalent wfs 2 , 3 , and 4 along cubic axes .",
    "we display in panel ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the wf 2 whose center is close to the [ 100 ] axis .",
    "the sum of wfs centers given in table  [ table2 ] is a measure of the trigonal distortion of the @xmath6like orbitals , since it would be vanishing in a perfect cubic environment .",
    "this configuration of the converged wfs justifies also our choice of trial orbitals : @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath94 orbitals are already good guesses of final wfs 2 , 3 , and 4 . during the iterations , most of the effort is devoted to building up wf 1 ( the @xmath94@xmath3 hybrid oriented along [ 111 ] ) .",
    "we note also in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] small features on the neighboring mn@xmath2 sites .",
    "they correspond to a weak bonding contribution from unoccupied states on these sites .    , but for the five mn@xmath2 @xmath21 wfs within lsd , after diagonalization of @xmath97 .",
    "the wfs ( a ) and ( b ) , as well as ( c ) and ( d ) , are partners of a @xmath98 representation of d@xmath36 , while ( e ) belongs to @xmath99.[fig3 ] ]    we consider next the five mn@xmath2  @xmath21 wannier functions .",
    "they are exactly centered at the mn@xmath2 site and their spreads do not display any well  defined symmetry . when convergence of o  @xmath22/@xmath16 wannier functions is practically achieved , further iterations of the localization process have the only effect of modifying slightly ( esentially by amounts comparable to the numerical noise ) the individual spreads of the five mn@xmath2  @xmath21 wfs , while their total spread remains unchanged .",
    "these five wfs are not uniquely defined by the criterion of maximal localization .",
    "in fact , any set of wfs obtained by applying a unitary transformation to the original set , will in general have different individual spreads , but the same value of the total spread .",
    "since it is advisable that the final wfs display explicitely as much symmetry as possible , we exploit this non  uniqueness and perform a symmetry reduction of the 5fold representation of the mn@xmath2  @xmath21 wfs , which decomposes into @xmath100 according to d@xmath36 symmetry .",
    "we note that the hermitian operator @xmath7 , which appears in the localization functional eq .",
    "( [ omega_def ] ) , has the full rotational symmetry , and therefore its matrix representation @xmath101 belongs to the @xmath99 representation of d@xmath36 .",
    "these matrix elements can be calculated through a simple generalization of eq .",

    "( [ r2_mn ] ) .",
    "we get in this way an extra unitary transformation which allows us to update the matrices @xmath103 .",
    "the resulting wfs , which display the expected ( @xmath104 ) symmetry , are indicated with the header `` s  lsd '' in table  [ table3 ] , and are shown in fig .",
    "we note that an arbitrariness ( up to a two  by  two unitary transformation ) remains in the definition of the partners in the two @xmath98 representations .",
    "the figure shows that the wfs 913 are essentially atomic orbitals modified by the d@xmath36 crystal field .",
    "the above picture depicting the whole set of wfs in afm mno has been confirmed by similar calculations performed for a hypothetical fm mno crystal . in this case , the symmetry is cubic ( space group o@xmath105 ) , and the majority  spin chanel contains 18 valence states ( o  @xmath22 , o  @xmath16 , and mn  @xmath21 ) , while the minority  spin chanel has 8 valence states ( o  @xmath22 , o  @xmath16 ) . as in afm mno , the mn  @xmath21 wfs are found to be essentially atomic orbitals .",

    "_ lobes of each hybrid display a substantial bonding @xmath21 contribution from the three neighboring unoccupied mn sites , while these features are absent in the majority  spin chanel ( occupied mn sites ) .",

    "[ fig2 ] for the case of the spin  up chanel ( we remind that corresponding results for spin  down are obtained by reversing mn@xmath2 and mn@xmath5 ) , is the fingerprint of superexchange in a one  electron picture .",
    "superexchange mechanism results in fact from indirect many  body interactions , involving metal atoms ( here mn@xmath2 and mn@xmath5 ) with an intervening oxygen .",
    "the shared covalency of nearest  neighbor pairs of magnetic ions leads to an antiferromagnetic alignment of their moments . as a matter of fact , supposing , _",
    "e.g. _ a spin  up wf on the mn@xmath2 site , the neighboring mn wf has the choice between two spin orientations , corresponding to a fm or an afm ordering",
    ". the fm choice will be energetically less favourable , due to the required orthogonalization to the mn@xmath2 wf , while in the afm alignment , the spin part of the wavefunction accounts for this necessary orthogonalization .",
    "the above textbook explanation of afm ordering can be discussed in light of our calculations , showing for the first time a real  space representation of the wfs for an afm system .",
    "the maximally ",
    "localized wfs bring out the relevant physical information , namely the covalent interaction with empty mn @xmath21 states .",
    "we also notice that the fm alignment , on the other hand , is favoured by kinetic energy .",
    "this can be seen in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig4 ] from the larger number of covalent interactions ( 6 instead of 3 in afm case ) associated with the o @xmath6like wfs , which leads eventually to a broader band  width .",
    "it is useful at this point to contrast this rather simple one  electron picture of afm mno , obtained in real space using the localized wannier  function description , with the more entangled picture based on the energy band  structure of the extended bloch  function description .",
    "for this purpose , we show in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] the spin  up band structure of mno along the @xmath107 directions , calculated within the lsd scheme .    starting from the lowest energies , we find first a @xmath99 and a @xmath108 states at @xmath109 .",
    "they arise from @xmath93 o  @xmath22 orbitals on the two o sites ( related by inversion symmetry ) , forming symmetric ( @xmath99 ) and antisymmetric ( @xmath108 ) combinations , respectively .",
    "the primary origin of the next composite group of 6 bands is o  @xmath16 triplets on the two o sites , which are split into a @xmath93 singlet and a @xmath110 doublet by trigonal c@xmath34 site symmetry .",
    "they lead to one set of symmetric combinations ( @xmath99 , @xmath98 ) , and one set of antisymmetric combinations ( @xmath108 , @xmath111 ) between the two sites .",
    "next , the occupied @xmath112 orbitals of the mn@xmath2 atom are split at @xmath54 into a doublet plus a singlet ( @xmath98 , @xmath99 ) , while the @xmath113 orbitals remain a doublet ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "these mn@xmath2  @xmath21 orbitals give rise to the uppermost occupied composite group of five bands .",
    "clearly , states of the mn@xmath2  @xmath21 and o  @xmath16 complexes which belong to the same @xmath99 ( or @xmath98 ) representation interact with each other , so that eventually both sets @xmath99(mn@xmath2  @xmath1 ) , @xmath99(o @xmath4 ) and @xmath98(mn@xmath2  @xmath1 ) , @xmath98(o @xmath4 ) consist of bonding and antibonding partners of mn@xmath2  @xmath21/o  @xmath16 hybrids . a mirror picture ( relative to fermi energy ) of the above",

    "the above description would leave completely empty the spin  up @xmath21 states of the mn@xmath5 atom .",
    "however , a covalent interaction ( clearly depicted in fig .

    "values for the mn@xmath2  @xmath21 wfs are those obtained after diagonalization of @xmath97 .",
    "all individual spreads , as well as the total spread ( whose value is 8.083 @xmath90 ) , are smaller than in the lsd case : the o  @xmath22/@xmath16 and mn  @xmath21 wannier functions are more localized by 9% and 22% , respectively , and this is consistent with the narrower valence band width .",

    "this results in a narrowing of the valence band width ( 6.3 ev , against 7.2 ev in lsd ) .",
