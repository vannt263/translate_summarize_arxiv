    "open clusters are of special interest since their investigation may lead to a deeper insight in kinematics and star formation in the galaxy , as well as contribute to the understanding of the galactic structure .",
    "some hundreds of such clusters are known and recent contributions indicate an increasing interest in proper motion determination .    in fact , the knowledge of the tangential component of the movement plays an important role when membership criteria through astrometrical techniques are concerned , since a common trend is the only characteristic to be searched for . moreover , in some few cases , the proper motions are accurate enough to allow a study of the internal velocity dispersion , providing additional data on the cluster dynamics .",
    "ngc1662 ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 , j2000.0 ) is a well known open cluster .",
    "it is situated in the direction of the anticenter ( @xmath8 ) and relatively distant from the galactic plane ( @xmath9 ) , corresponding to z=140 pc for a distance of 378 pc ( hassan @xcite ) .",
    "this distance to the plane may seem surprising for such a young cluster ( logt@xmath38.11 years ) ( hassan @xcite ) and suggests that the formation mechanism could have been the collision of a high velocity cloud with the gas of the galactic plane ( lpine & duvert @xcite ) .",
    "many of its properties are available in the literature such as angular diameter ( 12@xmath10 ) ( lyng @xcite ) ; metallicity ( @xmath110.232 ) and colour excess ( 0.34 ) ( cameron @xcite ) . notwithstanding its large content of bright stars ( v@xmath1213.0 mags ) , no kinematic study was found for this cluster .    in this paper , we present the results of an analysis of membership obtained through proper motions .",
    "the velocity of the centroid of the cluster is also obtained in the process .",
    "a detailed description of the employed techniques , of the observational material , and an account of the involved astrometric catalogues , is provided along with an analysis of the final results .",
    "since 1996 , an observational program for open clusters using the valinhos ccd meridian circle ( hereinafter vmc ) ( viateau et al .",
    "@xcite ) is under way , with the aim of proper motion determination .    in this work ,",
    "only observations performed during the year 1996 were used .",
    "the observational procedure is entirely differential , and data reduction was made with respect to hipparcos system as materialized by tycho catalogue ( esa @xcite ) .",
    "reference stars within the limits of the cluster were deleted from our reference positions file , so that members and candidates could have the same treatment during the reduction process .",

    "the determination of proper motions by means of combining present epoch observations with ancient positions , is a simply obtainable and valuable source of information on stellar kinematics .    in this paper",
    "we have combined our meridian circle observations with the ninety years old ac2000 positions and other data to asserting the membership of 30 stars in the ngc1662 neighbourhood .",
    "the results are that 20 of these stars have high membership probabilities .",
    "we have obtained the overall cluster proper motion , namely , @xmath16 mas / yr and @xmath17 mas / yr , in galactic coordinates .",
