    "to be specific , we consider ( i ) a one - dimensional ( 1d ) lattice which consists of corner sharing `` double - tetrahedra '' ( the double - tetrahedra chain ) and ( ii ) a frustrated ( cylindrical ) three - leg ladder having a triangular arrangement of rungs ( the frustrated triangular tube ) , cf .",
