    "at energies below @xmath1  2  kev , the spectra of most agn show an upturn , away from the extrapolation of the high energy ( 210  kev ) power - law .",
    "this so - called ` soft excess ' emission is thought to be common in both seyfert galaxies and qsos ( quasi - stellar objects ) .",
    "the first such soft excess was identified in mrk  841 by arnaud ( 1985 ) ; turner & pounds ( 1989 ) then found that @xmath1  50  per  cent of their _ exosat _ sample showed steeper spectral slopes at low energies .",
    "likewise , walter & fink ( 1993 ) and schartel ( 1996 ) found that the _ rosat _ pspc spectral index tends to be significantly steeper than that measured above 2.4  kev ( typically @xmath1  1.9 ; e.g. , nandra & pounds 1994 ) .",
    "more recently , pounds & reeves ( 2002 ) have discussed the frequent presence of soft excesses in _ xmm - newton _ data .",
    "many papers have been published about the soft excess , covering both observational results  with _ rosat _ ( e.g. , fiore 1994 ; piro , matt & ricci 1997 ) , _ ginga _ , _ exosat _",
    "( e.g. , saxton 1993 ) and _ einstein _",
    "( e.g. , masnou 1992 ; zhou & yu 1992 )  and theoretical work ( e.g. , czerny & elvis 1987 ; czerny & .",
    "zycki 1994 ; xia & zhang 2001 ) .",
    "it is generally thought that the soft excess may be linked to the hot tail - end of the big blue bump ( bbb ) , or is an extension of the uv band .",
    "the bbb / uv excess is likely to be due to thermal emission from the accretion disc surrounding the black hole ( e.g. , shields 1978 ; malkan & sargent 1982 ) .",
    "however , this thermal emission is not hot enough to account for the soft x - ray flux as well ; hence , comptonization is often invoked to explain the resultant emission . in this scenario , the direct thermal emission from the accretion disc is observed as the optical and uv spectrum .",
    "some of the disc photons , however , undergo inverse compton scattering with a population of hot electrons , thus gaining energy and producing a broader spectrum , which appears similar to a power - law over a limited energy range ( assuming unsaturated comptonization ) .",
    "all seven objects in this paper , listed in table  [ z_wa ] , have been previously observed by _ rosat _",
    "( schartel 1996 ) and were each noted to have steep photon indices over the 0.12.4  kev _ rosat _ band .",
    "the galactic absorption in the direction of each low - redshift qso is small and it has been previously found that there is no significant evidence for additional , intrinsic absorption in any of the objects .",
    "these qsos , therefore , represent a useful sample to investigate the soft excess in both radio - quiet and radio - loud agn .",
    "@xmath2 radio fluxes from the nvss .",
    "[ cols= \" < ,",
    "< , < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     ionized reflection may also contribute to the soft emission observed in broad - band x - ray spectra .",
    "sometimes the reflection can account for the entire soft excess ( e.g. , mrk  205 , reeves 2001 ) , while , in other spectra , the strength of the excess is simply decreased , shown by either the requirement for fewer blackbodies ( e.g. , mrk  359 , obrien 2001 ) , or by a lower normalisation of the components ( e.g. , mrk  896 , page 2003 ) .",
    "for each of the qsos in this sample , it is this last case  the decreased normalisation  which is observed .",
    "observations with _ ginga _ found that many agn spectra showed evidence for an emission line around 6.4  kev , corresponding to the fe  k@xmath0 line ( pounds 1989 , 1990 ; nandra 1991 ; nandra & pounds 1994 ) .",
    "in general , _ xmm - newton _ observations find the lines to be unresolved by the instrument ( @xmath3  @xmath4  10  ev ) , with relatively few broad lines .",
    "examples of resolved line widths include mcg  @xmath56@xmath530@xmath515 ( fabian 2002 ) , mrk  205 ( reeves 2001 ) and mrk  509 ( pounds 2001 ) .",
    "no iron lines have been reported in any of these objects from previous x - ray observations , although the _ xmm - newton _ spectrum of q  0056@xmath5363 has been recently published by porquet & reeves ( 2003 ) .",
    "they identified a strong broad fe  k@xmath0 line and the results presented in this paper are in complete agreement with their findings .",
    "lawson & turner ( 1997 ) analysed _ ginga _ spectra of pg  0804 + 761 , mrk  1383 , mrk  876 and b2  1721 + 34 , but found that iron emission lines were not significant .",
    "pg  0804 + 761 was also observed with _ asca _",
    "( george 2000 ) where , again , there was no evidence for an iron line . in the _ xmm - newton _",
    "spectra presented here , statistically significant narrow lines were , however , found in mrk  1383 and b2  1721 + 34 , as well as resolved lines in q  0056@xmath5363 , b2  1028 + 31 and b2  1128 + 31 .",
    "if the emission lines in q  0056@xmath5363 , b2  1028 + 31 and b2  1128 + 31 presented here are believed to be broadened , then the velocity widths are found to be @xmath1  ( 11.5 )  @xmath6  10@xmath7 km  s@xmath8 .",
    "this indicates that the emission originates in the inner accretion disc , close to the black hole , rather than in distant matter , such as the molecular torus .",
    "however , it must be noted that the lines are consistent with being intrinsically narrow at the 99  per  cent level .      each of the seven qsos in this sample have been found to show soft excess emission , as is commonly the case for agn .    although q  0056@xmath5363 has only been previously observed with _",
    "rosat _ , _ asca _ ( george 2000 ) and _ exosat _ ( saxton 1993 ) observations of pg  0804 + 761 have also occurred , both of which found excess soft emission .    likewise ,",
    "_ exosat _ ( comastri 1992 ) identified a soft excess in mrk  1383 ( which they found to be better modelled as a blackbody , rather than a second power - law , agreeing with the data in this paper ) , while wilkes & elvis ( 1987 ) found that their _",
    "spectrum required less than galactic absorption  often an indication of soft excess emission .",
    "_ einstein _ spectra of mrk  876 ( masnou 1992 ; wilkes & elvis 1987 ) did not reveal a soft excess , though .    b2  1028 + 31 has been previously found to possess a soft excess by _ einstein _ ( wilkes & elvis 1987 ; masnou 1992 ) , _ rosat _ and _ asca _ ( sarazin 1999 ) , with the excess being fitted by either a blackbody , or with a broken power - law ( over the whole energy band ) . sarazin ( 1999 ) found the soft excess to contribute @xmath1  15  per  cent of the total x - ray luminosity of the quasar , in complete agreement with the _ xmm - newton _ data presented here .",
    "b2  1128 + 31 and b2  1721 + 34 do not appear to have had soft excess reported prior to this paper .",
    "b2  1721 + 34 is , however , the largest radio source associated with a quasar ( barthel 1989 ) and shows superluminal motion .",
    "although modelling the soft excess in individual objects provides some useful information , comparing a number of objects may lead to a more detailed understanding of the processes involved . of the different methods for modelling the soft excess covered in this paper ( blackbodies , thermal plasma , disc blackbodies and comptonization ) ,",
    "the multiple blackbody fit is statistically the best for all but mrk  876 ( which is better fitted by the thermal _ mekal _ model ) .",
    "the disc blackbody results in the worst @xmath9 values .",
    "although the soft excess has been thoroughly investigated since it was first discovered in 1985 , the actual form of the emission is still uncertain .",
    "the multiple blackbody model generally gives the best results , but it is difficult to see how such emission could physically come about ; comptonization can easily explain the high temperatures observed , though .",
    "however , it is still not possible to state with any certainty what the origin of the soft excess truly is .    in order to try and identify any existing trends ,",
    "various figures were plotted and are discussed below .",
    "the relative strengths of the blackbody components compared to the power - laws were given in table  [ bb ] . in figure",
    "[ strength - lum ] , this ratio is plotted against the broad - band 0.510  kev luminosity for each object .",
    "there is no correlation between the values ( probability of only 68  per  cent for a negative correlation , using spearman rank analysis ) .",
    "figure  [ strength - gamma ] shows that there may be a weak relationship between the 210  kev photon index and the relative strength of the soft excess for these qsos ( @xmath1  96  per  cent for a positive correlation between the values ) .",
    "it has been previously found that narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies show both steep 210  kev power - law slopes ( brandt , mathur & elvis 1997 ) and strong soft excesses ( corresponding to steep spectra over the _ rosat _ band ; boller , brandt & fink 1996 ) ; this could be due to a compton cooling effect , whereby the excess soft flux cools the power - law electrons . the slight correlation between slope and soft excess found here",
    "could also be related to this effect .",
    "figure  [ kt - lum ] plots the comptonized temperature of the soft excess against the broad - band object luminosity .",
    "there is , again , no trend between the values ( probability of only 42  per  cent from spearman rank ) .    from the three previous plots it is noticeable that there is little difference in the soft excess properties of the rqqs and rlqs , with the temperatures covering a very similar range .",
    "the radio - quiet objects show slightly stronger soft excess luminosity ratios , but the values are not widely spread ; there is only a factor of three between the weakest and strongest component .",
    "the mean luminosity ratio is 0.24 for the rqqs and 0.13 for the rlqs . using student s t - test",
    ", there is a probability of 0.046 that the difference is due to chance and that the two samples come from the same group . in other words , there is a @xmath1  95  per  cent probability that the rqqs and rlqs are separate populations when considering the strength of the soft excess .",
    "this indicates that there may be a real difference between the groups , but is , by no means , conclusive .",
    "this ( possible ) difference in populations could explain the weak correlation between the soft excess luminosity ratio and the power - law indices above 2  kev : rlqs have flatter slopes and ( possibly ) weaker soft excesses , with rqqs showing steeper photon indices and more luminous soft excesses .",
    "one reason for rlqs having weaker soft excesses could be the dilution of the luminosity ratio by the non - thermal x - ray emission from the radio - jets .",
    "although this sample is not large , these results indicate that the soft excesses found in radio - quiet and radio - loud agn are similar , although radio - loud quasars do possess flatter high - energy photon indices .",
    "this flatter slope is likely to be due to emission from the relativistic radio jet , implying that the soft excess and radio emission may be unrelated .",
    "also the properties of the soft excess ( i.e. , ` strength ' and temperature ) do not appear to be dependent on the x - ray luminosity of the source .",
    "this is in agreement with page ( 2004 ) , who investigated a sample of high luminosity radio - quiet qsos , finding that the x - ray continuum shape ( including the soft excess ) remains essentially constant over a wide range of black hole mass and luminosity .",
    "thus , the implication is that the soft excess may be independent of luminosity , black hole mass and radio - loudness .",
    "clearly these results should be investigated for a much larger group of active galaxies , covering a good range of both rqqs and rlqs .",
    "the soft excesses of four radio - quiet and three radio - loud qsos are analysed . as a simple parametrization ,",
    "two blackbody components fit the soft excess very well .",
    "more physically , comptonization of the disc photons is invoked to explain the soft x - ray emission ; this model also provides good fits .",
    "there is little obvious intrinsic difference between the soft excess in the radio - quiet and radio - loud objects , with the electron temperatures covering the same range .",
    "five of the objects also showed evidence for iron emission , with three of them being better fitted with a somewhat broadened emission line .",
    "these widths are not very large , however , and are significant only at the 95  per  cent level .",
    "the work in this paper is based on observations with _ xmm - newton _ , an esa science mission , with instruments and contributions directly funded by esa and nasa .",
    "the authors would like to thank the epic consortium for all their work during the calibration phase , and the soc and ssc teams for making the observation and analysis possible ; also the anonymous referee , whose careful reading and detailed comments improved the paper .",
    "this research has made use of the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) , which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administation .",
