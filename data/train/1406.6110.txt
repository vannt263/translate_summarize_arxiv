    "quantum capacity of a noisy quantum channel @xmath0 is the highest rate at which quantum information can be sent down the channel and faithfully recovered from the channel s output .",
    "the quantum capacity is given by the formula  @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the one - shot coherent information  @xcite .",
    "the supremum is taken over all input states @xmath3 to the channel @xmath4 and @xmath5 is the _ non - optimized coherent information _",
    "@xcite where @xmath6 .",
    "the von neumann entropy @xmath7 is evaluated on the @xmath8 subsystem of @xmath9 and @xmath10 denotes a purifying system of the input state @xmath11 .",
    "this is the best characterization of quantum communication capabilities of a quantum channel as of today and the situation is not entirely satisfactory .",
    "the need for regularization in eq .",
    "( [ eq : quantcap ] ) has its origin in the fact that @xmath12  the coherent information is known to be non - additive  @xcite for a general quantum channel @xmath0 .",
    "this ultimately means that @xmath13 .",
    "because of these problems it may happen that a better characterization of quantum communication capabilities of a quantum channel will be developed which is not based on the coherent information . until then , the coherent information is a useful lower bound but there are situations where even to calculate the coherent information can be a challenge .",
    "one of them is the case of bosonic gaussian channels .",
    "bosonic gaussian channels transform gaussian optical states ( such as a single - mode squeezed state ) into gaussian states and the name comes from a gaussian profile of a probability function in phase space .",
    "gaussian states and maps essentially describe the physics of a quantum harmonic oscillator as an example of an elementary infinite - dimensional quantum system .",
    "there are many reasons to study gaussian states and channels .",
    "the whole gaussian framework is simple enough to be accessible to an analytical treatment and gaussian states are relatively easily prepared and manipulated in a laboratory . at the same time , gaussian channels show a number of complex phenomena such as superadditivity of the quantum capacity  @xcite and other effects  @xcite .    to make matters more simple it is instructive to start with the one - mode gaussian transformations .",
    "these maps correspond to the action of one - mode gaussian ( omg ) channels on ( one - mode ) gaussian states whose complete classification has been accomplished  @xcite .",
    "probably the second main reason behind the classification of omg channels ( the first one being the classification itself ) is the ability to quantify the channels quantum communication capabilities in terms of channel capacities .",
    "recall that they represent natural quantum optical processes such as the phase - insensitive amplifier or unbalanced beam - splitter  @xcite .",
    "if nothing else , the knowledge of how reliably they transmit quantum information can be of a great practical use .",
    "the question of the classical capacity of a omg channel has been elucidated  @xcite ( at least in the most important case of phase - insensitive omg channels , see also  @xcite ) and it has been shown that under reasonable conditions , the holevo quantity is an additive quantity for a broad class of omg channels while using gaussian codes  @xcite .    for the quantum capacity",
    "the situation is less encouraging  @xcite .",
    "first of all , the quantum capacity is known only in two cases : ( i ) for so - called antidegradable channels  @xcite where the capacity is zero and ( ii ) for a tiny fraction of omg channels known to be degradable  @xcite , where the capacity is nonzero and calculable  @xcite . for the rest of omg channels",
    "the generic computable lower bound is the one - shot coherent information as previously mentioned , where gaussian states encode quantum information . but here is the catch  unlike the classical capacity case , much less is known about whether the gaussian codes provide the highest transmission rate  @xcite . by restricting to the gaussian codes , as we do in this work , the calculation of the one - shot coherent information consists of an optimization step over the unconstrained input mean photon number . as it turns out , only in a certain ( very special ) case the coherent information",
    "is manifestly maximized when the input signal power goes to infinity ( leading to a finite value of the coherent information )  @xcite . in more detail",
    ", every omg channel can be purified by a two - mode gaussian unitary whose reference ( environment ) mode need not be a pure state but rather a mixed gaussian state .",
    "this will have an effect on what omg channel can be obtained by tracing over the reference mode . ignoring it would result in an incomplete classification and missing important examples of omg channels .",
    "so this is the key point .",
    "the coherent information can be relatively easily optimized if the environment contains no added classical noise .",
    "but the task becomes considerably harder in a general case .",
    "here we resolve this issue and show that if the environment contains added classical noise then whenever the coherent information is positive it is maximized for the infinite input signal power .",
    "otherwise it equals zero as the only non - negative value for the coherent information and it happens if the input power is zero . the proof is greatly facilitated by an interesting identity ( see eq .",

    "( [ eq : fh ] ) , ( [ eq : fourpapas ] ) and ( [ eq : fourpapasamp ] )",
    ". the identity could be useful in solving other problems involving the capacities of gaussian channels .",
    "note that from the text below eq .",
    "( 5.8 ) in the seminal ref .",
    "@xcite it seems that the problem is trivial .",
    "the authors claim that the coherent information is always an increasing function of the input power including arbitrary additive classical noise .",
    "however , a quick glance at fig .  [ fig : gexample ] shows that this is not true .",
    "a more correct statement can be found in  @xcite , where we can read below eq .",
    "( 12.188 ) that the very same coherent information is a complicated function of the input power ( see also the last paragraph of  @xcite ) .",
    "we will show in this paper that the in spite of the non - monotonic behavior of the coherent information as a function of the input power @xmath14 , its supremum over all omg input states is achieved in the limit of an infinite input power ( such as the grey curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : gexample ] ) or the optimized coherent information is zero ( see the green and blue examples for @xmath15 ) .",
    "this finding thus justifies the quantum capacity formula ( 5.9 ) from  @xcite .",
    "it is perhaps an expected result but the author is not aware of its proof in any form .    the question of optimization of coherent information arose while working on the problem of quantum information encoded in gaussian states and its flow in the vicinity of a non - rotating black hole surrounded by a potential barrier  @xcite .",
    "there , we have shown that for a certain region of the black hole parameter space , where the quantum capacity can not be calculated , the coherent information is zero in the limit of an infinite input power .",
    "this may naively imply that an observer at future infinity will not be able to reconstruct the quantum information swallowed by such a black hole .",
    "this would be an unwelcome conclusion as there exists a common belief ( shared by the authors of  @xcite ) that the information is not lost after the black hole has evaporated .",
    "but the whole problem may become a non - issue by either showing that ( i ) the region in question is physically irrelevant or ( ii ) that the coherent information could be superadditive leading to nonzero capacity or ( iii ) the one - shot quantum capacity ( the coherent information ) reaches its ( nonzero ) maximum for a finite input signal power . as a result of this paper , the third option turn out not to be the case .",
    "gaussian completely positive maps ( gaussian channels ) transform gaussian states among themselves .",
    "gaussian @xmath16-mode states are fully characterized by a @xmath17-dimensional displacement vector @xmath18 and a @xmath19 real covariance matrix @xmath20 . hence , gaussian channels act on these two quantities and it turns out that the transformation is @xmath21 and @xmath22 subject to a complete positivity condition on real matrices @xmath23 and @xmath24  @xcite . for the simplest class of one - mode gaussian channels investigated here the complete positivity condition reduces to @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "omg channels have been shown to fall into several equivalence classes  @xcite , where each class is represented by @xmath28 ( that can be set to zero for our purposes ) and matrices @xmath23 and @xmath29 being diagonal and characterized by three parameters . adding to the already introduced parameter @xmath30 , the remaining parameters are @xmath31}$ ] and @xmath32 as an average number of thermal photons injected to the reference mode of the purifying symplectic transformation of an omg channel .",

    "the proof was made relatively straightforward by virtue of an interesting identity involving quantities derived from the von neumann entropy for bosonic gaussian systems .",
    "the identity may eventually become useful elsewhere .    in a sense ,",
    "the current analysis covers _",
    "almost all _ phase - insensitive omg channels ( using the measure - theoretic terminology ) whose coherent information is non - vanishing . the channels with zero added classical noise form a mere boundary of the region delimiting the channels with nonzero added noise",
    ". this can be best visualized by a reparametrization provided by the parameters @xmath193 and @xmath194 defined in section  [ sec : main ] , that first appeared in  @xcite and was also used in  @xcite . by performing the optimization and finding that the coherent information is maximized for @xmath195",
    ", we can investigate when the limit is non - negative and obtain a plot identical to a figure from  @xcite where , incidentally , the currently studied omg channels appeared in the context of black holes physics and the related issue of information loss .",
    "needless to say that the study presented here is independent of any such physical interpretation .",
    "looking at fig .",
    "[ fig : cont ] we can appreciate two facts .",
    "as previously mentioned , we realize the scope of the main theorem proved in this paper .",
    "the channels with zero added noise ( @xmath117 ) , whose coherent information is easy to optimize  @xcite , are only those lying on the dashed boundary .",
    "the omg channels treated in this paper form an infinite quarter - plane given by @xmath196 .",
    "however , only the region where @xmath197 is interesting since the class of conjugate amplifying omg channels @xmath42 , defined for negative @xmath30 , is known to be entanglement breaking and therefore can not be used for reliable quantum communication .    for @xmath198 ,",
    "several different possibilities occur .",
    "the purple region denotes omg channels whose optimized coherent information is positive ( and so is the quantum capacity ) .",
    "the green region contains so - called antidegradable channels  @xcite and their quantum capacity ( and therefore the coherent information as well ) is zero",
    ". the white wedge - like region in between is a zero coherent information region but the quantum capacity is unknown .",
    "in fact , the result of the main theorem presented here can be summarized by saying that in the purple area the coherent information @xmath43 can not be made greater by a different choice of the input power @xmath14 other than @xmath100 and , conversely , the coherent information can not be made nonzero in the white area by any choice of @xmath98 .",
    "for @xmath199 the omg channels are either antidegradable ( the green region ) or entanglement breaking ( the corresponding part of the top - left white triangle ) and so their coherent information is zero and the quantum capacity as well ."
