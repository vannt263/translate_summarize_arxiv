    "the unavoidable interaction that each real - world system has with its environment is one of the major limitations to pratical realization of a _ quantum computer _ @xcite .",
    "indeed the outstanding potential capabilities of such a device rely heavily on the possibility of maintaining the quantum coherence in the system , and one of the typical effects of the coupling with the environment is to destroy phase relations between quantum states appearing in a linear superposition .",
    "this latter phenomenon is referred to as _ decoherence _",
    "@xcite : it can take place also when there is no system - environment energy exchange at all . to overcome this difficulty , in the last few years there has been a growing interest in the so - called _ error correction _",
    "schemes @xcite , in which , by means of suitable encondings and measurement protocols , one is able to disentangle the system from the environment in order to recover uncorrupted information .",
    "another possible approach , pointed out in @xcite , is to make use of symmetry to protect the information stored in a quantum state against environment - induced noise . in this case one , rather than to design states that can be easily corrected , looks for states that can not easily be disturbed .",
    "the simplest system for which dynamical symmetry provides us these `` safe '' states is a collection of @xmath0 qubits coupled all in the same way with the environment .",
    "such a system can be thought of as quantum register @xmath4 analogous to those characteristic of classical computation . in this paper",
    "we study a model hamiltonian describing the exchange of elementary _ quanta _ between the register and the environment , modelled by a bosonic bath @xmath5 .",
    "the coupling with the bath is realized in term of the off - diagonal generators of a @xmath3 dynamical algebra @xcite .",
    "the marginal dynamics of @xmath6 is dissipative ( i.e. the register energy is not conserved ) .",
    "the global hilbert space decomposes in ( dynamically ) invariant sectors , characterized by their @xmath3 symmetry content as well as their number of excitations , as it will be specified later .",
    "it should be emphasized that the focus of this paper is on the role played by dynamical - algebraic structures in providing collective states of the register intrinsecally stable against environment - induced decoherence .",
    "the adopted physical model is , in a sense , _ generic _ and it is not aimed to describe a specific physical implementation of a quantum computer ( as done instead , for example in @xcite ) but a broad class of open quantum systems that could eventually turn out to be relevant for quantum data processing applications . + in sect .",
    "ii , after recalling the fundamentals of open quantum systems , the model is introduced and its general feature briefly discussed . in sect . iii the associated hilbert space structure is analyzed . in sect .",

    "v contains some preliminary numerical results in the case of a qubit depending coupling with the bath .",

    "before introducing our model we begin by briefly recalling a few basic facts about open quantum systems .",
    "+ let @xmath7 denote respectively the system and the environment hilbert spaces .",
    "we assume @xmath8 to be much larger than @xmath9 the total hilbert space is given by the tensor product @xmath10 a _ state _ over @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) is a hermitean non negative operator @xmath13 of @xmath14 with @xmath15 the manifold of the state over @xmath11 will be denoted by @xmath16 the elements of @xmath17 that are also projectors ( @xmath18 ) provide the pure states .",
    "the set @xmath19 of pure states generates @xmath17 as its convex hull , furthermore it is in a one - to - one correspondence with @xmath20 according to quantum mechanics , time evolution of the overall ( closed ) system is unitary , therefore if the initial state has the separable form @xmath21 then for any @xmath22 the marginal ( liouvillian ) evolution on @xmath23 ( open ) is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 denotes the partial trace over @xmath26 the _ superoperators _ @xmath27 are trace - preserving completely positive maps @xcite , that are the most general description of the evolution of an open quantum system .",
    "@xmath19 is not invariant under the action of @xmath28 _ typically _ an initial pure state of the subsystem becomes mixed in a very short time scale depending on the strength of the interaction .",
    "this state can either eventually get pure again or not , but in any case an irreversible loss of the information stored in the initial preparation has occurred .",
    "it is important to notice that this mechanism is active even when there is no energy - exchange between the subsystems ( i.e. the subystem hamiltonians are constants of motion ) at finite as well as at zero temperature .",
    "when an energy - exchange occurs we call the resulting dynamics _ dissipative . _",
    "+ we introduce now the model .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 here the @xmath31 s are the spin @xmath32 pauli operators ( @xmath33 is the qubit index ) , and the @xmath34 s bosonic operators .",
    "@xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) is the hamiltonian of the register ( bath ) , @xmath37 the register - bath interaction .",
    "this model is closely related to the one known in the literature as the dicke maser model @xcite .",
    "the latter , for generic @xmath38 is not solvable and has a non - trivial ground - state phase diagram . in order to shed some light on the physics of this system we write down the equation of the motion for the heisenberg operators @xmath39 to simplify the expressions , it turns useful to perform the ( unitary ) transformation @xmath40 , whereby the heisenberg equations then read @xmath41 where @xmath42 $ ] . by a formal integration of the field equation and the substitution of the result into the spin equations one obtains @xmath43 here @xmath44 this coupled system of non - linear integro - differential equations describes the dynamics of the spin subsystem in closed form . by means of the intermediation of the bath bosons each spin gets interacting with all the others it via a sort of time - retarded heisenberg coupling .",
    "the information about the bath ( dynamics as well as preparation ) is contained in the kernels @xmath45 , and in the operators @xmath46 if @xmath47 and the bath - spin coupling is the same for all the spins , one has @xmath48.\\ ] ] under rather general assumptions this kernel is strongly peaked at @xmath49 , if one has @xmath50 then ( [ eqmot ] ) become a system of coupled non - linear differential equations . despite this strong simplification ,",
    "also in this case the solution , due to non - linearity , remains difficult and one has to resort to numerical techniques .",
    "+ an alternative approach based on symmetry considerations , will be introduced in the next section .",
    "the hilbert space is given by the tensor product @xmath51 , being @xmath52 ( @xmath8 ) the two ( infinite ) dimensional single spin ( boson ) space .",
    "the coupling of the spin system with the bosonic bath is described by the hamiltonian @xmath37 is such that the raising ( lowering ) of one spin state is associated to the destruction ( creation ) of one boson . from this",
    "follows that the system admits the constant of motion @xmath53 the eigenvalues of @xmath54 give the number of elementary ( spin as well as bosonic ) excitations over the reference state @xmath55 .",
    "the latter is a lowest weight vector for the spin as well as for the boson algebra : @xmath56 its energy is set equal to zero .",
    "the hilbert space splits into invariant eigen - spaces of @xmath57 , @xmath58 an elementary combinatorial argument shows that the dimension of the @xmath59-excitations space @xmath60 is given by @xmath61 if @xmath62 one has @xmath63 the model reduces to the exactly solvable jaynes - cummings model of quantum optics @xcite .",
    "it is worth noticing that the general spin - boson model considered in the literature on quantum dissipation , [ usually addressed in the framework of the feynmann - vernon influence functional ( see @xcite for a review ) ] , due to the presence of terms @xmath64 ( neglected here in view of the rotating wave approximation ) _ does not _",
    "conserve @xmath65 spoiling the associated dynamical decomposition of the hilbert space , on which our subsequent numerical analysis relies .",
    "nevertheless , since in this papers we are interested only in the role played by collective effects in stabilizing a quantum state , this restrictions does not result in any severe loss of generality . + a basis for @xmath66",
    "is given by @xmath67 where @xmath68 where @xmath69 @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) denoting the set of the combinations without ( with ) repetitions of @xmath72 objects @xmath73 by @xmath73 .",
    "following the general scheme of @xcite we specialize hereafter the model assuming the parameters @xmath74 independent of the qubit replica index @xmath75 the first assumptions follows simply from the fact that qubits are _ replicas _ of the same system .",
    "the independence of the coupling constants on the qubit index is analogous to the so - called dicke limit of quantum optics @xcite ; it holds - for example - when the typical bath wave - lengths coupled with the register are much greater than the distances between the qubits . in this latter case",
    "the environment is no able to probe the internal structure of the register : as long as the dynamics is concerned it has an effective point - like topology .",
    "the common value @xmath76 of the qubit `` magnetic '' fields @xmath77 will be chosen as the unit of the energy scale ; analogously the `` sound velocity '' of the boson will be set equal to one , so that their dispersion relation reads @xmath78 the hamiltonian can then be written as @xmath79 being @xmath80 global spin operators , spanning a lie algebra @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "+ the fact that in ( [ hamil ] ) the spins appear only trough the @xmath83 s means the all the qubits are treated symmetrically : the dynamics allows only for coherent excitations of the computational ( spin ) degrees of freedom .",
    "this is , from the algebraic point of view , a very strong constraint : the _ dynamics gets invariant under the action of the symmetryc group @xmath84 of the qubit index permutations .",
    "_ this provides us one more constant of motion .",
    "indeed from ( [ hamil ] ) immediately follows that the total spin @xmath85 is conserved and @xmath66 splits according the @xmath3-irrep .",
    "the multiplicity of each irrep associated with the total spin quantum number s is given by @xmath86 one finds the following decomposition in invariant subspaces @xmath87 where @xmath88 ( @xmath89 for @xmath0 even , and @xmath90 otherwise ) , @xmath91 denotes the eigenspace , in @xmath8 , of @xmath92 corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath93",

    "we notice that an additional term of the form @xmath106 would destroy the @xmath107 symmetry generated by @xmath65 but not the @xmath3 structure .",
    "such a term , considered in @xcite , does not correspond to an energy - exchange but is a source of pure decoherence .",
    "since our analysis relies on the invariant decomposition @xmath108 this term has been omitted here .",
    "due to the field - theoretic nature of our model , the dimensionality formula ( [ dim ] ) clearly shows that for increasing excitation number @xmath59 the problem of diagonalizing @xmath110 becomes rapidly intractable .",
    "in particular , a finite - temperature analysis ( arbitrary number of excitations ) is very difficult .",
    "nevertheless one of the interesting features of quantum noise is to be active also a @xmath111 thanks to vacuum fluctuations .",
    "this latter issue can be addressed by exact numerical means , without an artificious truncation of the bosonic space , by noticing that the one - excitation space @xmath112 has dimension @xmath113 that is only a linear function of the total number of degrees of freedom .",
    "the basis @xmath114 is given by @xmath115 equation ( [ split ] ) in this case reads @xmath116 the symmetric space ( @xmath117 ) is @xmath118-dimensional and it is spanned by the vector @xmath119 and by the whole set @xmath120 the subspace @xmath121 corresponds to @xmath122 an orthonormal basis of @xmath121 is given by @xmath123 where , @xmath124 since in @xmath121 the bosonic vacuum factorizes , this subspace , when necessary , will be identified with its projection over @xmath52 .",

    "the space @xmath121 is noiseless only at zero temperature ; for finite temperature the @xmath136 s get mixed with all the vectors belonging to the same @xmath3-irrep , making the induced dynamics non unitary .",
    "it is important to notice that , for @xmath137 this states are _ not _ the noiseless ones introduced in @xcite , as the latter are associated with spin singlets ( i.e. are annihilated by @xmath138 _ and _ @xmath139 ) and are decoherence - free at any temperature , whereas the @xmath136 s belong to @xmath140-dimensional @xmath3 multiplets .",
    "the spectrum in the symmetric subspace can be obtained by resorting to exact numerical diagonalization of @xmath110 , that provides the eigenvectors and eigenvalues @xmath141 + on the other hand the spectrum in @xmath142 is given by the @xmath143 zeros of the expression @xcite @xmath144 that corresponds to the analogous single spin problem with rescaled coupling @xmath145 this follows from the symmetry constraint that makes @xmath146 the only state coupled with the bosonic modes .",

    "the marginal density matrix can be readily diagonalized , simply by observing that it can be written in the form @xmath153 and @xmath154 the von neumann entropy of @xmath6 is therefore given by @xmath155 a completely symmetric expression ( @xmath156 ) is obtained for the bath marginal density matrix @xmath157 from which follows that @xmath158 furthermore we have @xmath159 for the conditional entropies , and @xmath160 for the mutual entropy ; this is a consequence of the purity of the overall system - bath state .",
