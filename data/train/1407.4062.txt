    "on average , our friends have more friends than we do .",
    "this statement is the basis of the friendship paradox , which was termed the class - size paradox by feld @xcite .",
    "the friendship paradox is based on an interesting property of human social networks : on average , the friends of randomly selected individuals are more central ( regarding centrality measures ) than those randomly selected people @xcite .",
    "the friendship paradox offers a strategic path around the problem of sampling a social network and detecting an emerging outbreak  @xcite .",
    "considering @xmath7 individuals , each of which possess @xmath8 friends , the mean number of friends @xmath0 is given by : @xmath9    in network terminology  @xcite , individuals are the vertices of the network , and a friendship between two persons is an edge .",
    "the number of edges per vertex is the degree of the vertex .",
    "thus , @xmath0 is the mean degree of the vertices .",
    "the total number of friends of friends is @xmath10 @xcite because , if an individual has @xmath8 friends , @xmath8 friends contribute to the final sum @xmath8 times , resulting in a contribution of @xmath11 for that individual . in appendix",
    "a , we show that the total number of friends of friends is @xmath10 .",
    "the total number of friends of individuals is @xmath12 ; thus , the mean number of friends of friends can be expressed as : @xmath13    considering that @xmath14 and @xmath15 , we obtain @xmath16    the variance ( @xmath17 ) of the number of friends is @xmath18    and , dividing it by @xmath19 , we may write @xmath20    therefore , based on equations ( [ eq:3 ] ) and ( [ eq:5 ] ) , the mean number of friends of friends is : @xmath21 which is also the result obtained by feld  @xcite .",
    "hence , as the ratio between the variance and the mean increases , the difference between the mean number of friends of individuals and the mean number of friends of friends also increases .",
    "scale - free networks follow a power - law degree distribution : @xmath22 where @xmath5 is a scaling parameter and @xmath23 is a normalization constant .",
    "many real - world networks @xcite are scale - free .",
    "for instance , a power - law distribution of the number of sexual partners was observed in a network of human sexual contacts @xcite . as mentioned in @xcite , such finding may have epidemiological implications , as epidemics arise and propagate faster in scale - free networks than in single - scale networks .",
    "equation ( [ eq : pk ] ) is applicable for @xmath24 .",
    "a remarkable characteristic of scale - free networks is the presence of highly connected vertices , which are often called hubs .",
    "therefore , the friendship paradox , which is a more general principle , is expected in scale - free networks in which the degree of hubs exceeds the average degree of the network . in the present study",
    ", we analyzed the relationship between the mean degree of vertices ( individuals ) and the mean number of friends of friends in scale - free networks with degrees ranging between a minimum degree of @xmath2 and a maximum degree of @xmath3 .",
    "for a normalized power - law distribution with degrees ranging between @xmath2 and @xmath3 , we have that @xmath25    thus , the normalization constant @xmath26 may be obtained from the previous equation as @xmath27 in particular , when @xmath28 and @xmath29 , @xmath30 for @xmath24 .    for a scale - free network , the mean degree of vertices , @xmath31 and the variance , @xmath32 are , respectively , given by @xmath33 and @xmath34^{2 } \\ , .",
    "\\label{eq:12}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    note that , for @xmath29 , when @xmath35 , the mean and variance are infinite .",
    "when @xmath36 , the mean is finite , but the variance is infinite . however , when @xmath3 is finite , which is the case in many real world networks that follow approximately a power - law degree distribution , both the mean and variance are finite .",
    "the scaling parameter usually lies in the range of @xmath37 , even though there are exceptions  @xcite .    from equations ( [ eq:11 ] ) and ( [ eq:12 ] )",
    ", we can derive the ratio between the variance and the mean @xmath38 which is equivalent to the difference @xmath4 , as shown in equation ( [ eq:6 ] ) .",
    "we can derive @xmath1 from equations ( [ eq:11 ] ) and ( [ eq:13 ] ) @xmath39",
    "both @xmath1 and @xmath0 for @xmath40 and @xmath1 for @xmath41 assume the indeterminate form @xmath42 .",
    "by applying lhpital s rule , the indeterminacy was removed , and we obtained the following expressions for @xmath0 @xmath43 for @xmath1 @xmath44 and the difference @xmath4",
    "based on equation ( [ eq:13 ] ) , we analyzed the effect of varying @xmath5 and @xmath3 on the difference between the mean of friends of friends and the mean of friends ( fig .",
    "[ fig.1 ] ) . for networks with the same value of @xmath3 ,",
    "as the scaling parameter @xmath5 decreased , an increase in the variance - to - mean ratio was observed .",
    "this finding is consistent with the fact that networks with @xmath5 values close to 1 are denser than networks with higher values of @xmath5 ( for instance , closer to 3 ) .",
    "furthermore , the probability of finding a hub ( a highly connected vertex ) with a given degree of @xmath46 is lower for a scale - free network with a higher @xmath5 value .    in a previous publication ,",
    "grisi et al .",
    "@xcite showed that scale - free networks with the same degree distribution may have different structures .",
    "based on the algorithms described by grisi et al .",
    "@xcite , we compared three different types of networks with the same degree distribution and calculated the difference between the mean degree of friends of friends and the mean degree based on the adjacency matrix of the networks using different values of @xmath3 . in fig .",
    "[ fig.2 ] , the simulated results of a power - law degree distribution generated using the transformation method  @xcite with @xmath47 are presented .",
    "the models used to generate the networks included models a , b and kalisky , employing the algorithms provided in @xcite . in appendix",
    "b , we summarize some characteristics of models a , b and kalisky . in the simulations",
    ", we obtained similar results for the three models .",
    "a discrepancy between the simulated and predicted ( according to the theory described in the present paper ) results was observed , probably due to fluctuations in the generation of the degrees of the vertices  the proportion of vertices with degree @xmath48 in the generated network may be different from the theoretical @xmath49  , or due to the rounding to discrete values of continuous numbers generated and uncertainties in the estimation of @xmath5 . regarding the latter factor , we estimated @xmath5 using the fitting procedures described by clauset et al .  @xcite .",
    "for each value of @xmath3 , the range of predicted values for the variance - to - mean ratio corresponding to the fitted @xmath5 values are shown in gray in fig .",
    "[ fig.2 ] .",
    "the results illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig.2 ] suggest that , in real networks with a given set of parameters ( @xmath5 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) , values close to the predicted results are expected , along with fluctuations .",
    "the difference @xmath4 is strongly dependent on the scaling parameter ( @xmath5 ) of the power - law degree distribution . in scale - free networks with lower @xmath5 values ,",
    "this difference is higher , reflecting the fact that the hubs in these networks are more connected than the other vertices , in comparison to what happens in networks with higher @xmath5 .",
    "additionally , we would expect that information ( rumors , viruses , gossip and news , among others ) would spread more rapidly in the dense scale - free networks with lower @xmath5 values .    as noted by clauset et al .",
    "@xcite , the characterization of power - laws is complicated by large fluctuations in the tail of the distribution .",
    "provided that a dataset is derived from a degree distribution that follows a power - law in the range between @xmath2 and @xmath3 , the expressions deduced in the present study can be used to estimate the scaling parameter @xmath5 using equations ( [ eq:11 ] ) , ( [ eq:12 ] ) or ( [ eq:13 ] ) for a given combination of @xmath2 , @xmath3 and either the mean , variance , or variance - to - mean ratio .    in summary , we deduced an expression for the difference @xmath4 for scale - free networks that possess a maximum degree of @xmath3 and follow a power - law distribution with a scaling parameter of @xmath5 .",
    "based on this expression , we can quantify how the degree distribution of a scale - free network affects the mean number of friends of friends .",
    "the intensity of @xmath4 , which increases with a decrease in the scaling parameter , directly affects the effectiveness of strategies for the control of infectious diseases ( such as the strategies proposed by christakis and fowler  @xcite and cohen et al .",
    "@xcite ) , rumors or computer viruses in real scale - free networks . the calculations given here are also , to some extent , relevant to sampling procedures for monitoring and surveillance purposes in networks of human contacts and networks of animal movements .",
    "an individual @xmath50 has @xmath51 friends .",
    "considering an undirected network , the number of friends of friends of individual @xmath52 is @xmath53    thus , the total number of friends of friends , taking into account all individuals , is @xmath54    as mentioned in section  [ sec : results ] , models a , b and kalisky  @xcite were used to generate the networks .",
    "the algorithms are described in grisi et al .",
    "@xcite . in this appendix ,",
    "we summarize some characteristics of these models .",
    "the networks generated by models a and kalisky show a medium to high global efficiency , which quantifies the efficiency of the network in sending information between vertices  @xcite and also a medium to high central point dominance , a measure related to the betweenness centrality of the most central vertex in a network  @xcite . for denser networks",
    "( see the examples in  @xcite ) , model a and kalisky generate networks with almost all vertices in the giant component  @xcite .",
    "model b , on the other hand , generates networks with very low to low global efficiency and very low to low central point dominance . even for denser networks ( see  @xcite ) , model b generates networks with several components . in simulations for the spread of infectious diseases  @xcite , compared with networks generated by model a and kalisky among other algorithms , the lowest prevalences of disease",
    "were observed in model b networks .",
    "the distribution of links in a model b network is a plausible cause for the low prevalence , because a large number of vertices are not connected to the giant component of the network .",
    "this work was partially supported by fapesp , capes and cnpq .",
    "we thank an anonymous researcher for suggesting the alternative way of deriving the average degree of friends presented in the remark ."
