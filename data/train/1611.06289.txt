    "the linet - tian metric @xcite , @xcite is a static cylindrically symmetric solution of einstein s equations that can be interpreted as describing a line source in a vacuum space time with non vanishing cosmological constant @xmath0 , which can be chosen to be positive or negative . in the case of vanishing @xmath0",
    "the metric reduces to a form of the levi - civita metric @xcite .",
    "there has been a continued interest in the linet - tian metric and in the construction of models in which the metric is involved . as a few examples we may cite @xcite where it was found that , for a negative cosmological constant , in the limit where the source vanishes , one obtains a static , but cylindrically symmetric anti - de - sitter universe .",
    "general properties were analyzed , for instance in @xcite .",
    "the properties of the solutions with positive cosmological constant , and their extension to higher dimensions were considered in @xcite .",
    "the geodesics kinematics and dynamics in the linet - tian metric with negative cosmological constant were analyzed in @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the question of the evolution of external fields or of the stability of gravitational perturbations on these space times has not received the same attention .",
    "the stability of the related levi - civita metric under linear perturbations that break the cylindrical symmetry was analyzed in a recent study @xcite , finding that the spectrum of allowed frequencies contains one unstable ( imaginary frequency ) mode for every possible choice of the background metric .",
    "the main purpose of the present paper is to analyze to what extent these results are modified by the presence of a cosmological constant , and therefore , extend the results obtained in @xcite to the linet - tian space times .    in the case of the linet - tian metric , as compared with the levi - civita metric",
    ", the first thing to notice is that the structures of the space times that result for the two possible signs of @xmath0 are very different , specially as regards their properties at large distances from the symmetry axis . in the positive cosmological case",
    ", there is a null horizon at some finite distance from the symmetry axis , while for negative cosmological constants there is a time like horizon at an infinite proper distance from the axis .",
    "this implies that in the analysis of the evolution of either external fields , or small perturbations , one has to consider very different boundary conditions . in this paper",
    "we study the linear stability of the linet - tian solution with negative cosmological constant .",
    "the positive cosmological case will be considered in a separate paper .    in the case of a negative cosmological constant",
    "the linet - tian metric may be written in the form , @xmath1 where : @xmath2 and the parameters @xmath3 satisfy , @xmath4 the ranges of the coordinates are @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 .",
    "the @xmath3 may be parameterized as , @xmath9 with @xmath10 restricted to @xmath11 . in this paper we will use a parametrization due to thorne @xcite , where @xmath12 , and , @xmath13 the range of @xmath14 is then @xmath15 . in the limit @xmath16",
    "the linet - tian solution reduces to a form of the levi - civita metric . in what follows it will be more useful to change the coordinate @xmath17 to a new coordinate @xmath18 , such that , @xmath19 so that the range of @xmath18 is also @xmath20 .",
    "we then have , @xmath21 and the linet - tian metric takes the form , @xmath22 where , for simplicity and without loss of generality for the analysis to be carried out in this paper , we have rescaled the coordinates @xmath23 .",
    "the metric ( [ lteq10 ] ) , up to rescalings of the coordinates @xmath23 , is the general solution of the static einstein equations with a negative cosmological constant , with ( full ) cylindrical symmetry .",
    "as already indicated , the purpose of this paper is to extend the stability analysis of the levi - civita metric , given in @xcite to the linet - tian solution with negative cosmological constant .",
    "the problem we are interested in here is that of the ( linear ) evolution of perturbations of ( [ lteq10 ] ) that admit initial data of compact support , and that break the cylindrical symmetry of the background , but preserve the axial symmetry , so that we may write the perturbed metric in the form , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the linet - tian metric ( [ lteq10 ] ) , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and linearity implies that all geometric quantities are computed up to first order in @xmath28 . from the linearity of the problem , and the fact that @xmath25 depends only on @xmath18 , and leaving aside for the moment the question of boundary conditions , we will look first for solutions of the perturbation equations that have the form , @xmath29 we expect to find a `` complete set '' of such solutions , in the sense that the evolution of arbitrary initial data may be ( formally ) written as a fourier transform of the form , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is determined by the initial data , and we must keep in mind that in the case of linear instabilities some the @xmath32 may be complex numbers , and , also , that part or the whole spectrum of @xmath32 may be discrete . on this account ,",
    "we write the perturbed metric in the form , @xmath33 where the @xmath34 and @xmath35 are functions of @xmath18 only .",
    "if we compute einstein s equations using the form ( [ lt02 ] ) of the metric , and retain only first order in @xmath28 , we find that the @xmath34 satisfy a set of coupled linear o.d.e . ,",
    "decoupled from the @xmath35 , which themselves satisfy a separate set of coupled linear o.d.e .",
    "we may then consider as separate problems the cases where all the @xmath34 are set equal to zero , ( which we will call case i ) , and the cases where only those terms are non vanishing ( case ii ) .    the set of perturbation equations that result from computing einstein s equations are only _ local_. in trying to extend their solutions to the whole space time we are confronted with the fact that the linet - tian solution is not globally hyperbolic .",
    "this non global hyperbolicity stems from two facts .",
    "the first is that the space time contains a time like singularity for @xmath36 .",
    "this singularity is the same as that present in the levi - civita metric .",
    "the problem of analyzing the evolution of perturbations under this condition was studied in @xcite .",
    "there it was shown that if one imposes certain physically acceptable restrictions as a boundary condition for @xmath36 , it is possible to define a unique evolution for arbitrary perturbations that satisfy the imposed conditions . as a consequence it was possible to prove that the levi - civita space time is unstable under perturbations that break the translational symmetry along the symmetry axis .",
    "we may apply the same criterion here , but in the linet - tian case we have another source of non global hyperbolicity , because the boundary @xmath37 is time like .",
    "this has as a consequence that the constant @xmath38 hypersurfaces are not cauchy surfaces , and that there are null geodesics that remain to the future of any given constant @xmath38 hypersurface , and never intersect the hypersurface .",
    "thus , the future evolution of any perturbation may be arbitrarily modified by information incoming from @xmath39 .",
    "one way out of this problem is to impose boundary conditions , possible with some physical justification that supplements the model , such that the evolution is solely determined by initial data on some constant @xmath38 hypersurface .",
    "we notice , however , that this is not a unique prescription , and that the resulting evolution turns to be eventually dependent on the boundary condition .",
    "we will therefore rephrase our problem , and try to find , for a certain family of possible boundary conditions , under what conditions , if any , we obtain a well defined , although possibly unstable , evolution of appropriate initial perturbative data . these and other points will be clarified as we derive our may results .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a more detailed discussion of this problem .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we analyze the gauge problem , with the purpose of extracting appropriate gauge invariant quantities , and show that , as already indicated , the evolution equations for a general perturbation separate into two independent sets , that we call case i and case ii . in section iii we analyze case i. we derive a `` master '' equation and obtain the conditions under which there are unstable modes associated to the evolution of type of perturbation .",
    "case ii is analyzed in section iv .",
    "this is the main part of the paper .",
    "we show that the perturbations can be reduced to a diagonal form and we obtain a `` master '' variable , such that solving its equation of motion one obtains a complete solution for the full perturbation .",
    "nevertheless this function is not gauge invariant , but we show how to extract the corresponding gauge invariant part .",
    "next we show that the solutions of the equation satisfied by this gauge invariant part are in one - to - one correspondence with the solutions of the eigenvalue - eigenfunction problem for an operator in a one dimensional , single particle , schrdinger like system .",
    "the self adjointness of this operator requires imposing appropriate boundary conditions that are analyzed in detail .",
    "the structure of the resulting spectrum for the operator is studied in section v , where we find that essentially in all cases it contains negative eigenvalues which correspond to imaginary frequencies , thus establishing our main result that the linet - tian space times are gravitationally unstable .",
    "the limit @xmath40 , corresponding to purely radial perturbations is analyzed in section vi .",
    "an interesting and somewhat unexpected result of this analysis is that , contrary to what happens for the levi - civita case , the linet - tian space times with negative cosmological constant are also _ unstable _ under purely radial perturbations . in section vii",
    "we consider the limit @xmath41 , corresponding to the bonnor metric , and find that it is _ stable _ under the linear perturbations considered here .",
    "we add , mostly for completeness , a brief comment on the `` hoop conjecture '' in section viii some final comments are given in section ix .",
    "a central problem in the analysis of the evolution equations ( as in @xcite ) is the elucidation of the gauge invariance of the perturbations .",
    "we consider this problem in this section .",
    "we first notice that a general coordinate transformation from @xmath42 to new coordinates @xmath43 that preserves the form ( [ lt02 ] ) of the perturbed metric may be written as , @xmath44    indicating with a tilde the transformed coefficients , under this transformation we have , @xmath45 and , @xmath46 so that the @xmath34 and the @xmath35 transform separately , which is , of course , consistent with the fact that they satisfy separate systems of coupled o.d.e .",
    "we will consider the consequences of these forms of the transformations on the gauge issues and the resulting equations of motion in the following sections .",
    "in this section we consider case i. here , in accordance with ( [ lt08 ] ) we only have one free function ( @xmath47 ) at our disposal , so we may choose a gauge where any one , ( or some particular combination ) of the functions @xmath35 is set equal to zero , and this removes any gauge ambiguity . in more detail , it should be clear , from ( [ lt08 ] ) , that the expressions , @xmath48 are gauge invariant . on the other hand , in accordance with our previous discussion , without loss of generality , we may choose a gauge where @xmath49 . in this case",
    "( i.e. if we set @xmath50 ) the functions @xmath51 and @xmath52 correspond to gauge invariants .",
    "we may , therefore consider the perturbation equations that result when we set @xmath49 from the start .",
    "a simple computation then shows that einstein s equations imply that @xmath51 and @xmath52 must satisfy the coupled set of odes , @xmath53 h_2 + \\frac{(2 + 4 x^2 + 3 p_3)}{3 x(1 + x^2)}h_3\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we may use the first of these to solve for @xmath52 in terms of @xmath51 and @xmath54 . replacing in the second",
    "we find a second order equation for @xmath51 that can be written in the form , @xmath55 \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we immediately notice in this equation that @xmath0 appears only combined with @xmath56 and @xmath32 in the forms @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "we may therefore define two new parameters @xmath59 , and @xmath60 , and the solutions of ( [ casii08 ] ) , for fixed @xmath14 , will be parameterized by @xmath61 , and @xmath62 , which is ( formally ) equivalent to setting @xmath63 in ( [ casii08 ] ) .",
    "we shall adopt this latter choice , remembering that for @xmath64 we must rescale the values of @xmath56 and @xmath32 .",
    "suppose now we fix the value of @xmath14 , which fixes the unperturbed space time . in principle",
    ", we may specify @xmath56 freely .",
    "then , if we impose boundary conditions on ( [ casii04 ] ) for @xmath36 , and @xmath37 , we turn the problem of solving the equation into a boundary value problem that determines the allowed values of @xmath65 . in principle",
    "we would have an infinite set of such solutions , that can be considered as functions of @xmath56 , and @xmath32 , and which , through the use ( [ casii04 ] ) , provides a complete solution of the perturbation equations for the given parameters then , plugging these solutions in ( [ gpeq4 ] ) we would have an infinite set of solutions of the evolution equations for the perturbations .",
    "we are now confronted with several problems .",
    "one is that we do not have closed form solutions of this equation .",
    "another is that it is not clear how to impose acceptable boundary conditions that define and restrict the range of possible values of @xmath32 . and , most importantly",
    ", how can we assure that our set of solutions is `` complete '' , in the sense that it can , at least in principle , describe the evolution of acceptable but arbitrary initial data .",
    "these problems may be analyzed by constructing an equivalent self adjoint operator , whose eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are in one to one correspondence with the solutions of ( [ gpeq4 ] ) , and the corresponding values of @xmath32 .",
    "this can be achieved by introducing a new function @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is a function of @xmath18 , and an `` integration '' function @xmath68 such that , @xmath69 where @xmath70 satisfies the equation , @xmath71 and , @xmath72    replacing in ( [ casii08 ] ) we find that @xmath66 satisfies the equation , @xmath73 where , @xmath74 and @xmath18 should be given as a function of @xmath67 by inverting @xmath70 .",
    "we recognize that ( [ casii16 ] ) has the standard form of the schrdinger equation for a particle in a one dimensional potential , and , therefore , its spectrum can analyzed using well known standard procedures . in particular , its self adjoint extensions provide a complete , orthonormal , basis of functions in its domain .",
    "the expression ( [ casii18 ] ) for @xmath75 is not the most useful because @xmath76 and @xmath77 are not independent .",
    "a more useful one in terms of @xmath14 is obtained using ( [ lteq5 ] ) , @xmath78 we have , therefore , that for @xmath79 the potential diverges to @xmath80 , while for @xmath37 we have @xmath81 .",
    "we further notice that for @xmath82 ( i.e. for @xmath83 , the potential @xmath84 is positive definite , and , therefore , we will have @xmath85 for any self adjoint extension of ( [ casii16 ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , for @xmath14 larger than this value , there are negative terms in the potential , and these , in turn , might dominate in some region , making @xmath84 negative there . to see what effect this may have on the allowed values of @xmath32 we need to establish the existence of self adjoint extensions for ( [ casii16 ] ) , and",
    "this requires making the dependence of @xmath86 on @xmath67 more explicit .    in more detail",
    ", we may fix an integration constant in ( [ casii12 ] ) and set , @xmath87 since , @xmath88 the integral in ( [ casii20 ] ) converges for all @xmath18 , and we have @xmath89 for @xmath90 , with , @xmath91 we also notice that near @xmath36 we have ( to leading orders ) the expansions , @xmath92   \\nonumber \\\\",
    "x(y ) & = & \\left(\\frac{(4 - 3p_1)y}{4 \\sqrt{3}}\\right)^{6/(4 - 3p_1)}+\\frac { ( 3p_1 - 8)}{2(3p_1 - 16)}\\left(\\frac{(4 - 3p_1)y}{4 \\sqrt{3}}\\right)^{18/(4 - 3p_1)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while for @xmath37 we have , to leading order , @xmath93 + using these results , we first notice that from ( [ casii24 ] ) , near @xmath94 , to leading order , we have , @xmath95 and , therefore , near @xmath94 , the general solution of ( [ casii16 ] ) behaves as , @xmath96 where @xmath97 and @xmath98 are arbitrary constants .",
    "this implies that the second term on the rhs of ( [ casii34 ] ) diverges faster than @xmath99 , and , therefore , we must set @xmath100 to have a boundary condition appropriate for a self adjoint extension .",
    "the other important limit is @xmath101 ( @xmath37 ) . in this limit",
    "we have @xmath102 and , therefore , the general solution of ( [ casii16 ] ) , for @xmath103 is of the form , @xmath104 where @xmath105 and @xmath106 are arbitrary constants . as regards the possibility of a self adjoint extension this corresponds to the _ circle limit _ case . in this case",
    "we obtain a self adjoint extension by imposing that all allowed solutions must satisfy the boundary condition @xmath107 for some _ fixed _ @xmath108 .",
    "this implies that there are infinite possible different self adjoint extensions .",
    "in particular for @xmath109 ( @xmath110 ) we have the dirichlet and for @xmath111 ( @xmath112 ) the neumann boundary condition . the general case of arbitrary @xmath108",
    "is called the robin boundary condition . this large ambiguity in the boundary condition for @xmath113 can be traced to the fact , already discussed , that for ads the region @xmath114 corresponds to a time like boundary .",
    "we now go back to the problem of finding the allowed @xmath32 , assuming we have chosen a particular self adjoint extension .",
    "as remarked , for @xmath115 , the potential is positive definite , and , therefore , @xmath116 for all self adjoint extensions , corresponding to a stable evolution of arbitrary initial data . on the other hand for",
    "sufficiently large @xmath14 the potential is negative in some region , as can be explicitly checked by plotting @xmath117 as a function of @xmath67 , using ( [ casii28 ] ) , and ( [ casii20 ] ) as parametric representations of these functions .",
    "an example is given in fig .",
    "it can be seen that the region @xmath118 is comparatively small , and shallow .",
    "we have analyzed numerically the possible existence of solutions with @xmath119 and found that even for large values of @xmath14 these are possible only for @xmath120 .",
    "for instance , for the example of fig . 1 , we find that there are solutions with @xmath121 only for @xmath122 .",
    "the existence of these solutions can be understood if we consider solving numerically ( [ casii16 ] ) , by imposing the appropriate boundary condition at @xmath94 , for some negative value of @xmath65 , and integrating towards @xmath123 . since",
    "the potential is smooth for @xmath124 , we expect to find a smooth solution for @xmath124 , such that for @xmath125 we have some finite values for the solution and its first derivative , and , therefore , some finite value of @xmath108 .",
    "we shall not elaborate further on these type of solutions and remark only that there appear to be no solutions for @xmath119 if we impose the dirichlet boundary condition for @xmath126 , and , therefore , the case i perturbations are stable with respect to that boundary condition . in the next section we consider case ii .",
    "consider now case ii . in this case , in accordance with ( [ lt06 ] ) , given an arbitrary perturbation , since the functions @xmath127 , @xmath128 , and @xmath129 are arbitrary , we may choose them such that @xmath130 , @xmath131 , and , @xmath132 .",
    "it should be clear that with this choice we remove all gauge ambiguity , because any further transformation would make at least one these functions different from zero . if we make this choice , and assume that only @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath135 , and , @xmath136 are non zero , replacing in the linearized einstein equations we obtain a coupled set of o.d.e.s for these functions such that by appropriate replacements we may express explicitly @xmath134 , @xmath135 , and , @xmath136 , as linear functions of @xmath137 and @xmath138 , while @xmath137 , in turn , satisfies a second order o.d.e .",
    "unfortunately , the explicit forms of the coefficients that result , because of their length and complexity , are very difficult to handle . for this reason ,",
    "we have chosen to analyze a different choice of gauge , that , although not free of gauge ambiguities , is much easier to handle , and eventually leads to gauge invariant results . in more detail , since the functions @xmath127 , @xmath128 , and @xmath129 are arbitrary , it is clear that we can always choose them such that @xmath139 .",
    "thus , without loss of generality , we may restrict case ii to a `` diagonal form '' , namely , we assume that only @xmath140 , @xmath137 , @xmath141 , and @xmath142 , are non vanishing .",
    "once this choice is made , there appears to be no freedom left for further simplifications .",
    "it turns out , however , that the `` diagonal form '' is not gauge invariant .",
    "this is because the system , @xmath143 has the solution , @xmath144 where @xmath145 is an arbitrary function of @xmath56 and @xmath32 .",
    "this implies , as can be easily checked , that the system , @xmath146 with @xmath147 , and @xmath145 an arbitrary function of @xmath148 , is a pure gauge solution of the perturbed einstein equations .",
    "+ thus the `` diagonal '' perturbations are not gauge invariant , because there are coordinate transformations that preserve the diagonal form .",
    "if we indicate with @xmath149 a particular representation and with @xmath150 the transformed perturbation , in accordance with ( [ lt06 ] ) and ( [ lt12 ] ) they are related by , @xmath151 this immediately implies that , although the functions @xmath34 are not gauge invariant , we have that @xmath152 and , therefore , @xmath153 is a gauge invariant quantity .",
    "similarly , @xmath154 are also gauge invariant quantities .    replacing the diagonal form of the perturbations in einstein s equations , and expanding to first order in @xmath28",
    ", we get a set of coupled second order ordinary differential equations for the functions @xmath149 .",
    "a closer examination shows that for @xmath155 , and @xmath156 , we have , @xmath157 while for @xmath140 and @xmath141 we find , @xmath158    we also find , @xmath159 where , @xmath160    one can now show that any set of functions @xmath161 that satisfy ( [ peq4],[peq6],[peq8 ] ) is a solution of the perturbation equations , and therefore , to solve those equations , all we need to do is to solve the system ( [ peq4],[peq6],[peq8 ] ) .",
    "a first step is to introduce two new functions , @xmath162 and @xmath163 , defined by , @xmath164    now , using ( [ peq6 ] ) it follows that , @xmath165    then , from the definitions ( [ peq10 ] ) we obtain , @xmath166 and , therefore , we have explicit expressions for @xmath141 , @xmath142 , ( and @xmath167 ) in terms of @xmath168 and @xmath169 .",
    "we also find an expression @xmath140 in terms of @xmath168 , which has the form , @xmath170 where @xmath171 , @xmath172 , and @xmath173 are again lengthy and complicated functions of @xmath18 and the other parameters in the problem .",
    "if we replace these expressions for the @xmath34 in the perturbation equations , we find that all the equations are satisfied , provided @xmath162 is a solution of a _ third order _",
    "o.d.e . of the form , @xmath174 where the functions @xmath175 depend on @xmath18 , the metric parameters , @xmath56 and @xmath32 in a complicated way",
    ". thus the problem of analyzing the perturbations considered here is reduced to that of finding the solutions of eq .",
    "( [ peq18 ] ) .",
    "but , because of the complicated form of the functions @xmath175 , this turns out be a rather difficult task .",
    "we may , nevertheless , apply the previous results on gauge invariance , to achieve a certain simplification of the problem and take it to a form more suitable for its analysis .",
    "we notice that under a coordinate transformation of the form ( [ lt12 ] ) we have , @xmath176 where @xmath177 is a constant , and , @xmath178    we remark that since @xmath162 is already a first order quantity , the _ form _ ( and the coefficients ) of ( [ peq18 ] ) are invariant under the transformation ( [ peq38 ] ) , and , therefore , _ both _ @xmath162 and @xmath179 must be solutions of ( [ peq18 ] ) , which implies , as can explicitly be checked , that @xmath180 is also a solution of ( [ peq18 ] ) .",
    "in fact , it is a pure gauge solution of ( [ peq18 ] ) , and , therefore , corresponds to a pure gauge solution of the perturbation equations .",
    "but , if we go back to ( [ peq40 ] ) , it is clear that , @xmath181 and , therefore , @xmath182 is gauge invariant .",
    "if we write the general solution of ( [ peq18 ] ) in the form , @xmath183 replacing in ( [ peq18 ] ) we find that @xmath184 satisfies an equation of the form , @xmath185 where , again , the functions @xmath175 depend on @xmath18 , the metric parameters , @xmath56 and @xmath32 in a complicated way .",
    "this implies that the function , @xmath186 which , on account of ( [ peq44 ] ) is gauge invariant , and , therefore , contains the non trivial part of the perturbation , satisfies a _",
    "second order _",
    "the main difficulty in the analysis of this equation is due to the presence in the coefficients of ( [ peq24 ] ) of powers of @xmath18 , ( and of @xmath187 ) that are rational functions of @xmath14 that do not combine in a simple way .",
    "nevertheless , we may show that in general the equation for @xmath188 may be written in the form , @xmath189 where the functions @xmath190 and @xmath191 depend on @xmath18 , @xmath14 , @xmath0 , and @xmath56 , but are independent of @xmath32 .",
    "but , since we expect the solutions to satisfy some restrictions in order to be acceptable as perturbations , for instance in their behaviour for both @xmath79 and @xmath37 , it should be clear that once these restrictions are imposed , ( [ peq28 ] ) may be taken as a boundary value - eigenvalue problem that determines the acceptable values of @xmath32 .",
    "we may then try applying known techniques , such those used in @xcite , to find the allowed spectrum for @xmath32 , and look for possible instabilities , signaled by a negative value of @xmath65 . the first step would be to find appropriate boundary conditions , such that the resulting functions are acceptable as perturbations . however , because of the complicated form of the equation satisfied by @xmath192 , it turns out that it is somewhat simpler to proceed directly to an analysis of its solutions and then relate those solutions to the general problem .",
    "just as in case i , this can be made to look like a quantum mechanical problem for a particle in a one dimensional potential by introducing a new variable @xmath67 , and a new function , @xmath193 , such that , @xmath194 where @xmath68 is an `` integration factor '' , determined as follows .",
    "we first write ( [ peq28 ] ) in the form , @xmath195 where @xmath196 and @xmath197 are related in an obvious way to @xmath190 and @xmath191 and @xmath198    replacing ( [ peq32 ] ) in ( [ peq28a ] ) we get , @xmath199    if we choose now @xmath70 as a solution of , @xmath200 ( which is identical to ( [ casii12 ] ) ) , and impose the condition that @xmath201 is a solution of the equation , @xmath202 so that the coefficient of @xmath203 in ( [ peq28c ] ) vanishes , replacing in ( [ peq28c ] ) we finally find that @xmath193 satisfies an equation of the form , @xmath204 where , @xmath205 and @xmath206 actually , as will be clear in what follows , @xmath207 is readily obtained only as a function of @xmath18 , but it is implicitly dependent on @xmath67 through the function @xmath208 obtained by inverting @xmath70 .",
    "the main difficulty here is that , unfortunately , for general values of @xmath14 the function @xmath209 is rather complicated and we could not find explicit expressions for @xmath68 .",
    "nevertheless one can check that with the choice ( [ peq30 ] ) of @xmath70 the right hand side of ( [ peq28d ] ) is regular in @xmath210 , and therefore , the solution @xmath68 is also regular in @xmath211 .",
    "moreover , if we assume that @xmath68 satisfies ( [ peq28d ] ) , replacing in ( [ peq34aa ] ) we obtain , @xmath212    notice that an important consequence of this result is that , besides @xmath196 , @xmath197 , and @xmath213 ( given by ( [ peq30 ] ) ) , _ no _ explicit knowledge of @xmath201 , or of @xmath70 , is required to construct an explicit form of @xmath214 as a function of @xmath18 .",
    "it is , again , understood that @xmath18 should be given as function @xmath67 by inverting ( [ peq30 ] ) , but , as we will see in what follows , the x - dependent form ( [ peq34b ] ) will be all we need to obtain the general properties of @xmath215 , and , therefore , of the solutions of ( [ peq34 ] ) .",
    "one further important property that results from the explicit x - dependent form of @xmath214 is that , besides @xmath14 , it depends only on @xmath216 .",
    "therefore , if we introduce , @xmath217 then ( [ peq34a ] ) takes the form @xmath218 which contains _ no _ explicit reference to @xmath0 .",
    "thus , for fixed @xmath14 , the effect of changing @xmath0 in the unperturbed metric is just a rescaling of the parameters @xmath56 , and @xmath32 in the solutions of the perturbation equations .",
    "going back to ( [ peq34 ] ) , we notice that it has the familiar form of a ( one dimensional ) schrdinger equation , where @xmath219 is the potential .",
    "therefore , the central problem of the present analysis is then to find , if they exist , appropriate self adjoint extensions of @xmath220 , where by appropriate we mean that the resulting solutions are acceptable as perturbations , and that any acceptable perturbation can , in principle , be expanded using the solutions , which , in turn , provides a solution of the evolution equations .",
    "we will elaborate further on this point in what follows .",
    "we recall at this point that on account of ( [ lteq3 ] ) , @xmath76 has the range @xmath221 , and , therefore , considering ( [ peq30 ] ) , we see that @xmath67 is a monotonic function of @xmath18 , such that with an appropriate choice of an integration constant , corresponding to the range @xmath211 , we have @xmath222 , where @xmath223 is given by @xmath224 and , therefore , is finite .",
    "as already remarked we could not find closed form expressions for @xmath68 for general values of @xmath14 .",
    "we notice , however , that to analyze the possible behaviour of the solutions of ( [ peq34 ] ) at the boundaries ( @xmath226 , and @xmath227 ) , all that is required are adequate expansions of @xmath70 , and of @xmath68 .",
    "let us consider first the boundary @xmath94 . in accordance with ( [ peq30 ] ) , ( and a similar analysis carried out for case i ) , near @xmath36 we have",
    ", @xmath228    a simple computation shows that near @xmath36 , to leading order we have , @xmath229 and , therefore , near @xmath94 , again to leading order , we have , @xmath230    thus , near @xmath94 , the behaviour of the potential @xmath231 is independent of @xmath14 and @xmath56 .",
    "the general solution @xmath193 of ( [ peq34 ] ) for a potential of the form ( [ v105 ] ) takes the form , @xmath232 where @xmath97 and @xmath98 are arbitrary constants .",
    "it is well known that all that is required in this case to obtain a self adjoint extension ( at least as regards the boundary @xmath94 ) , is to keep to ratio @xmath233 _ at some fixed value _ for all the solutions of ( [ peq34 ] ) .",
    "the situation is similar to that found and discussed in our previous analysis of the perturbations of the levi - civita space times @xcite . for similar reasons as those considered there we shall impose @xmath100 , as our boundary condition .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for further details and references .",
    "we only remark that setting @xmath234 is the most restrictive condition as regards possible eigenvalues @xmath121 , as can be seen by considering the situation for a pure @xmath235 potential .",
    "the other important limit is for @xmath101 , ( @xmath236 ) .",
    "using again the explicit form of @xmath214 as a function of @xmath18 , we find , to leading order for @xmath236 , @xmath237 or , in terms of @xmath67 , @xmath238    therefore , the potential @xmath225 is finite and regular at @xmath227 . the general solution @xmath193 is then , to leading order , of the form , @xmath239 where @xmath97 and @xmath98 are arbitrary constants .",
    "this corresponds also , as for @xmath94 , to the _ circle limit _",
    "case for self adjointness .",
    "however , in this case we do not have a regularity criterion that we can apply , and , in principle , all fixed ratios @xmath240 are acceptable , introducing an essential ambiguity in the evolution of the perturbations .",
    "as already discussed , this can be traced to the fact that the boundary @xmath37 is time like , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , if we assume that a criterion for choosing a particular value of the ratio @xmath240 can be established , and that that choice leads to a well defined evolution of the perturbations , the question still remains as to which , if any , of the possible choices leads to a stable evolution .",
    "for this reason , in what follows we will leave the choice of the value of @xmath240 open , and proceed to the general analysis of the solutions of the perturbation equations .",
    "we notice , on this regards , that ( [ peq30 ] ) , and ( [ peq34b ] ) provide a parametric ( in terms of @xmath18 ) expression for @xmath225 .",
    "we may use this fact to gain some insight on the nature of the solutions of ( [ peq34 ] ) , by plotting @xmath241 as a function of @xmath70 , evaluated numerically , using , @xmath242    some examples are given in figure 2 for several values of @xmath14 and @xmath243 . recall that the range of @xmath67 depends on @xmath14 , and that in all cases we have @xmath244 sufficiently close to @xmath94 .",
    "the presence of a `` dip '' region , away from @xmath94 , where the potential has a negative minimum is noticeable in all cases .",
    "we must remark here that , just as in case i , it should be clear that , for a given boundary condition for @xmath94 , the most restrictive condition as regards the possibility of eigenvalues @xmath245 , is obtained setting @xmath246 , that is , imposing that the solutions vanish for @xmath227 .",
    "once we make appropriate choices of the boundary conditions at @xmath94 and @xmath227 , the operator @xmath220 in ( [ peq34 ] ) becomes self adjoint and we are assured of the existence of a complete spectrum of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions that can be used to generate the evolution of arbitrary initial data for the perturbations .",
    "the details are entirely similar to those analyzed in @xcite , and will not be repeated here .",
    "the important point is that the resulting evolution will be stable only if there are no eigenvalues with @xmath121 , and , therefore , we will concentrate on finding , if they exist , those eigenvalues and eigenfunctions .",
    "if we try to find those solutions , either exact or numerically , directly from ( [ peq34 ] ) , we are faced with the difficulty that @xmath247 is known only implicitly as function of @xmath67 .",
    "for this reason , and considering that there is a one - to - one correspondence between the solutions of ( [ peq34 ] ) , and those of ( [ peq28a ] ) , we shall analyze the solutions of the latter instead of those of ( [ peq34 ] ) .",
    "as a first step , we need to translate the boundary conditions for ( [ peq34 ] ) into those corresponding to ( [ peq28a ] ) . to achieve this",
    "we would need to solve ( [ peq28d ] ) to obtain @xmath201 , but , fortunately , we only need its behaviour near the boundaries .    using ( [ peq28d ] ) , and expanding @xmath70 and @xmath196 to leading order near @xmath36 , after some computations we find , @xmath248 we also have @xmath249 , so that we finally find that near @xmath36 we should have , @xmath250 where @xmath97 and @xmath98 are arbitrary constants . in accordance with our previous discussion",
    ", we must impose the condition @xmath100 .",
    "for the boundary at @xmath37 we have , @xmath251    since @xmath37 we have @xmath252 , we find that in that limit we should have , @xmath253 where @xmath97 and @xmath98 are arbitrary constants .",
    "notice that the case @xmath254 , @xmath100 corresponds to @xmath193 approaching a non zero constant , with @xmath255 , while for @xmath246 , @xmath256 , we have @xmath257 , with @xmath258 and finite .",
    "there are different procedures that one can use to analyze ( [ peq28a ] ) numerically .",
    "we notice that , for a general procedure , near @xmath36 the structure of the coefficients as functions of @xmath18 is rather complicated because of the presence of exponents that are rational functions of @xmath14 . on other hand , if we consider , for instance , the coefficients of the unperturbed metric , for @xmath259 , they all admit expansions of the form , @xmath260 so , that , eventually , all relevant quantities in the problem can be expanded in ( integer ) powers @xmath261 . in particular , it is not very difficult , although too lengthy to be displayed here , to show that all the coefficients in ( [ peq28a ] ) admit expansions similar to ( [ spec09 ] ) for sufficiently large @xmath18 . on this account , one can show that , for sufficiently large @xmath18 , the general solution of ( [ peq28a ] ) admits an expansion of the form , @xmath262 where @xmath97 and @xmath98 are arbitrary constants , and the coefficients @xmath263 and @xmath264 are functions of @xmath14 , @xmath32 , @xmath0 , and @xmath56 that can be readily computed by replacing in ( [ peq28a ] ) and expanding in powers of @xmath18 for @xmath37 . notice that regarding the boundary conditions for @xmath126 , if we define @xmath108 by , @xmath265_{y = y_0 } , \\ ] ] then , we have , @xmath266 and , therefore , the ratio of the constants @xmath233 controls the boundary value imposed at @xmath227 .    considering the general form of the potential , and the fact that the range of @xmath67 is finite",
    ", we can see that the most restrictive boundary condition for the existence of negative eigenvalues is @xmath267 , ( with @xmath268 ) .",
    "this condition corresponds to @xmath246 , @xmath256 .",
    "we remark once again that we are only interested in finding whether , after imposing boundary condition that imply that @xmath220 in ( [ peq34 ] ) is self adjoint , its spectrum contains negative eigenvalues .",
    "this amounts to finding solutions of ( [ peq28a ] ) for negative @xmath65 , after imposing the corresponding boundary conditions .",
    "notice that , since the range of @xmath67 is finite , the spectrum is fully discrete , but , because of the complicated form of the coefficients of ( [ peq28a ] ) this search can only be carried out numerically .",
    "there are different possibilities here .",
    "we have chosen a `` shooting '' method , where , using the expansion ( [ spec11 ] ) , we first obtain an approximation to @xmath188 and @xmath269 for a sufficiently large value of @xmath18 , and then integrate numerically towards @xmath36 . in more detail , after fixing the values of @xmath14 , @xmath56 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 , ( recall that we can take @xmath270 , without loss of generality ) , we give a tentative value for @xmath65 , and integrate numerically towards @xmath36 . since for arbitrary values of @xmath65 the corresponding solution will behave near @xmath36 as in ( [ spec03 ] ) , a sufficiently accurate integration should lead to a solution that approaches zero in all cases .",
    "for this reason we look for solutions such that , @xmath271 = c\\ ] ] where @xmath177 is some constant , since , as should be clear from ( [ spec03 ] ) , this corresponds to solutions where the terms in @xmath272 vanish .",
    "some particular examples are shown figures 3 to 6 . in all cases",
    "we have set @xmath246 , as the most restrictive condition . in fig .",
    "3 we show a plot of @xmath273 for @xmath274 , and @xmath243 , for approximate solutions for the two lowest eigenvalues . numerically we find that increasing or decreasing @xmath65 slightly from the indicated values causes the curve to diverge either towards @xmath275 or @xmath276 as we approach @xmath36 , which we interpret , as indicated above , as indicative of the existence of an eigenvalue and corresponding eigenfunction for the type of boundary conditions imposed on the problem .",
    "mostly for completeness we also show a plot of the corresponding solutions @xmath188 in fig .",
    "we have explored numerically a range of values of the parameter @xmath14 an in all cases we have found that the lowest eigenvalue is negative , although we have no proof that this is the case in general for extremely large or small values of @xmath14 .",
    "examples of these lowest eigenvalues for different @xmath14 are given in fig .",
    "5 and fig .",
    "we also remark in all cases analyzed the lowest eigenvalue is negative , but the next to lowest is positive , a situation that resembles that found in @xcite .",
    "in this section we consider the limit @xmath40 .",
    "this corresponds to purely radial perturbations that are independent of @xmath277 , and , therefore , preserve the cylindrical symmetry of the unperturbed metric .",
    "one can check that the linearized einstein equations imply that @xmath278 .",
    "if we consider now the linearized equations for the @xmath34 , we find that in general we must have , @xmath279 without loss of generality we may write , @xmath280 and this implies , @xmath281 then , in accordance with ( [ lt06 ] ) , for @xmath40 , with an appropriate choice of @xmath282 , we may set @xmath283 .",
    "this still leaves free the choice of @xmath284 and @xmath285 . considering again ( [ lt06 ] ) , for @xmath40",
    ", we conclude that we may always choose a gauge where we also set @xmath286 .",
    "notice that @xmath287 is still defined up to an additive constant .",
    "this is , of course , consistent with the resulting equations of motion . in detail",
    "we find , as independent equations , @xmath288 @xmath289 and , @xmath290 where the @xmath291 are rather complicated functions of @xmath18 , that depend on @xmath14 , but are independent of @xmath32 .",
    "it is now straightforward to solve ( [ k008 ] ) for @xmath137 , replace in ( [ k010 ] ) , and obtain a second order equation for @xmath141 of the form , @xmath292 where , @xmath293 \\nonumber \\\\    & & \\times\\left[x(1+x^2)(2 x^2(1+\\kappa+\\kappa^2)+3 + 3 \\kappa)(4 x^2(1+\\kappa+\\kappa^2)+3)\\right]^{-1 } \\\\",

    "this still allows for a parametric representation that we can use to obtain plots of @xmath300 as a function of @xmath67 , as indicated in fig .",
    "several important points are clearly visualized in that plot .",
    "one is the divergence to @xmath301 for @xmath302 .",
    "another is the divergence to @xmath80 for @xmath113 , and , equally important , the `` deep '' region away from @xmath226 .",
    "we may , following similar steps as above , determine quantitatively the leading behaviour of @xmath300 both for @xmath302 , ( that is , for @xmath79 ) , and for @xmath113 , ( that is , for @xmath37 ) .",
    "leaving aside details similar to those already considered , we find , @xmath303 which is similar to all the previous cases . however , for @xmath113 , ( @xmath37 ) , we find , @xmath304    this immediately implies that the solutions of ( [ k020 ] ) behave as , @xmath305 where @xmath97 , and @xmath98 are constants , and , therefore , there is a _",
    "unique _ self adjoint extension , as far as the boundary @xmath227 is concerned , corresponding in this case to imposing the condition @xmath246 on all solutions .",
    "we complete the self adjoint specification by imposing , as before , that @xmath306 , ( no @xmath307 terms ) . we can again check that these conditions translate as the following boundary conditions on @xmath308 : @xmath309 \\;\\;\\;\\ ; ; \\;\\;\\ ; \\mbox{for } \\ ; x \\to 0 \\nonumber \\\\",
    "f_3(x ) & \\sim & c_4   x^{-2 } \\;\\;\\;\\ ; ; \\;\\;\\ ; \\mbox{for } \\ ; x \\to + \\infty\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath105 and @xmath106 are constants .",
    "it is again easy to obtain an asymptotic expansion for @xmath308 for @xmath310 , satisfying ( [ k030 ] ) .",
    "the first terms are , @xmath311\\ ] ]    we have used this expansion , together with a `` shooting '' method to obtain numerical values for @xmath32 and solutions for @xmath308 , corresponding to the lowest eigenvalues and eigenfunctions in the self adjoint extension of @xmath296 . in all the cases analyzed , that correspond to a range of values of @xmath14 , we find that lowest eigenvalue corresponds to @xmath121 , indicating the unexpected result that the radial perturbations become _ unstable _ in the presence of a negative cosmological constant .",
    "an example is given in fig .",
    "an interesting limit of the linet - tian metric was analyzed by bonnor , @xcite where it was found that , for a negative cosmological constant , in the limit where the source vanishes , ( @xmath41 ) , one obtains a static , but cylindrically symmetric anti - de - sitter universe .",
    "we may analyze linear perturbations of that metric along the lines used in this paper . using the gauge properties already considered we may restrict to `` diagonal '' perturbations that do not break the axial symmetry of the unperturbed metric .",
    "it is convenient in this case to write the metric ( plus perturbations ) in the form , @xmath312    the linearized einstein equations for this metric may be written as , @xmath313 where @xmath314 is an arbitrary constant , and , @xmath315    therefore , every solution ( [ bon06 ] ) for @xmath316 provides a solution for the perturbation problem . to analyze the properties of these solutions",
    "we may introduce a new function and variable defined by , @xmath317 where , @xmath318 and we find for @xmath319 the equation , @xmath320 but we immediately see that the `` potential '' in ( [ bon12 ] ) is positive definite , and therefore , the metric is stable under this type of perturbations .",
    "in interesting question regarding systems with full cylindrical symmetry , as in our case , is how the _ hoop conjecture _ manifest itself as a possible instability of the system . here",
    "we need to remark that we are already dealing with a system that contains a naked singularity along the symmetry axis , and , therefore , it is not clear how one would assign either transverse or longitudinal radiuses to verify the conjecture . in fact , any finite section of the axis , if it could be isolated , would be in a critical situation , as its transverse radius might be thought as being zero .",
    "an important point regarding the results of our analysis is that the instabilities that we find are purely gravitational , independent of a matter contents , because they result from the presence of the `` deep '' region of the effective potential , away from the symmetry axis .",
    "since this happens in the vacuum region , we might expect that they would remain even after the singularity is smoothed out , either by the presence of a regular cylinder of matter , or by some other way of regularizing the metric close to the symmetry axis . in this",
    "regards it is interesting to consider the behaviour of `` deep '' region as a function of @xmath56 , since @xmath56 is inversely proportional to the wavelength of the perturbations in the @xmath277-direction .",
    "it turns out that as we increase the value of @xmath56 , ( shorter wavelengths ) , ( an example is shown in fig .",
    "9 ) , the `` deep '' becomes deeper and closer to the axis , so that it would be these shorter wavelengths that would be eliminated by a regularization , while the longer ones would still introduce instabilities , as , at least intuitively , expected from the hoop conjecture . in any case",
    "it would be interesting to construct explicit examples , but that is totally outside the context of the present research .",
    "in this paper we have analyzed the axial gravitational perturbations of the gravitational field of an infinite line source , in the presence of a negative cosmological constant .",
    "the analysis generalizes a previous one where similar perturbations were studied for the levi - civita metric , that corresponds to the limit of vanishing cosmological constant .",
    "we derived the linearized equations of motion for the perturbations and showed that they can be separated into two sets , which we identified as case i and case ii .",
    "both sets contain , in principle , a certain degree of gauge ambiguity , which we analyzed in detail allowing us to find the corresponding gauge invariant parts . in both cases",
    "we obtained a `` master variable '' and a corresponding `` master equation '' , in the form of a schrdinger like equation .",
    "the main purpose and usefulness of these equations is that under appropriate boundary conditions they define a self adjoint operator , whose eigenvalues determine the frequencies of the perturbative modes , and whose eigenfunctions provide a complete set for the expansion and subsequent evolution of arbitrary perturbative initial data .",
    "but , because of the fact that for the unperturbed metric the constant @xmath38 hypersurfaces are not cauchy surfaces , one needs to introduce , somewhat arbitrarily , appropriate boundary conditions at time like infinity in order to obtain well defined evolution equations for the perturbations .",
    "thus , a central problem here was establishing those boundary conditions that fix the behaviour of the solutions at the axis of symmetry and at infinite distance from that axis .",
    "we found that in both cases , for the symmetry axis there is either a unique or a physically motivated choice . on the other hand , there is , within the context of the unperturbed metric , no unique natural or physical choice from an infinite set of possibilities .",
    "we have considered a set of choices , leading to a robin type condition , that in some way reflects that idea that `` nothing '' is added to the initial data in its subsequent evolution .",
    "a general feature that results is that for the assumed types of boundary conditions , equivalent to a robin condition on the wave equation , the resulting evolution contains generically an unstable component .",
    "the main result of our analysis is then that the evolution will contain generically unstable components , and , therefore , that the space times considered here are gravitationally unstable .",
    "since these space times contain a naked singularity , one would be tempted to ascribe the instability to the presence of that singularity .",
    "we remark , however , that here , as in the cases considered in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , the unstable mode is related to the form of a `` potential '' away from the singularity , indicating the possibility that the instability might remain even after smoothing the ( curvature ) singularity by considering an extended source . in the present case , as in @xcite , one would have to consider a cylindrical regular source , such as an infinite cylinder of some kind of matter .",
    "the problem in this construction is that the resulting system is considerably more complex than the vacuum case considered here , since , asides from conditions that must be imposed at the matter - vacuum boundary , we must incorporate an equation of state for the matter , and the resulting appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "the question , nevertheless , is interesting , but outside the scope of the present research .",
