    "the turn type inequalities for orthogonal polynomials and special functions have been studied extensively in the last 70 years .",
    "more often , these orthogonal polynomials and special functions are solutions of some second order differential equations . the log - concave / log - convex nature of orthogonal polynomials and special functions have attracted many researchers , and the topic seems to be interesting still nowadays .",
    "some of the results on modified bessel functions of the first and second kind have been used recently in different problems of applied mathematics and this motivated new researches in this topic .",
    "see for example the paper @xcite and the references therein for more details . in this paper",
    "we focus on general bessel functions , called sometimes as cylinder functions .",
    "the main motivation to write this paper emerges from the fact about the bessel functions of the first kind @xmath0 , bessel functions of the second kind @xmath1 and the zeros @xmath2 of general bessel function satisfying some turn type inequalities ( see @xcite ) , and it is natural to ask whether the general bessel functions @xmath3 defined by @xmath4 @xmath5 has some similar properties . as we can see below , from the point of view of turn type inequalities , the general bessel function @xmath6 behaves like @xmath0 and @xmath7 the results presented in this paper complement the picture about the turn type inequalities for bessel functions of the first and second kind .",
