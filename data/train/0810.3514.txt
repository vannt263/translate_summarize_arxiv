    "the study of parton fragmentation and hadronisation processes provides valuable insight into the non - perturbative regime of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "these processes are studied by the h1 and zeus collaborations at hera energies ( about 300  gev in the @xmath0 centre - of - mass frame ) using the semi - inclusive charged particles produced in neutral current deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) .",
    "two quantities describe the properties of hadron production : the invariant mass of the hadronic system @xmath2 and the virtuality @xmath3 of the exchanged boson .",
    "the best way to study hadronisation is to look from the point of view of the exchanged boson colliding with the incoming proton . in their centre - of - mass frame ,",
    "called also the hadronic centre - of - mass frame ( hcm ) , half of energy , @xmath4 , is carried out by particles which have absorbed the boson and the other half by particles from the proton remnant .",
    "navely one would expect particle production in the proton remnant region to be similar to particle production in @xmath5 collision . among the particles which have absorbed the exchanged boson , a part of them is expected to have similar features to the ones observed in one hemisphere of @xmath1 annihilation .",
    "the separation is easily done in the breit frame . in this frame",
    "the exchanged boson of @xmath6 energy is absorbed by the scattered quark which converts into particles in the region called the current region of the breit frame .",
    "thus , depending on the rapidity of the emitted hadron its feature can be similar either to the one produced in @xmath1 annihilation or in @xmath5 collision .",
    "there is a region of rapidity in between the origin of the breit frame and the hcm frame , called the central region , which is unique in its feature for @xmath0 scattering .",
    "this region is dominated by gluon emission . in asymmetric collisions such as",
    "@xmath0  scattering leakage between regions modifies this simplified picture .",
    "the current region of the breit frame is populated mainly by hadrons coming from the zero - order qcd process @xmath7 and the first - order qcd process @xmath8 .",
    "the other first - order qcd process is the boson - gluon fusion ( bgf ) @xmath9 with hadrons populating the edge of the current and central region .",
    "this process with its higher orders as well as the initial state gluon radiation do not contribute to hadron production in @xmath1 and are the main source of differences between hadron features in @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "the depopulation of the current region depends  on  @xmath3 .        in this short review fragmentation",
    "features in @xmath0 scattering are presented in form of the scaled momentum distributions measured in the current region of the breit frame @xcite and of the average charged multiplicities @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity to the energy scale definition is discussed for scales given by @xmath10 , @xmath2 and a sum of the emitted energies .",
    "the data are compared with predictions from monte carlo ( mc ) event generators .",
    "two models , ariadne 4.12  @xcite and lepto - meps 6.5.1  @xcite , are considered to describe the dis processes . in ariadne",
    "the parton cascade is modelled with the colour - dipole model whereas lepto incorporates the leading - order matrix element with some next - to - leading ( nlo ) correction implemented in the parton shower . a soft colour interaction model ( sci ) implemented in lepto is also considered . for these event generators ,",
    "hadronisation is performed by the lund string model  @xcite .",
    "in addition herwig is discussed due to its cluster hadronisation model  @xcite although this model did not describe similar data in the past .",
    "the data collected with the h1 detector correspond to an integrated luminosity of @xmath11  pb@xmath12  @xcite and with the zeus detector to @xmath13  pb@xmath12  @xcite .",
    "the measurements of the average multiplicity , @xmath14 , presented in  figs  [ obraz1 ]  and  [ obraz2 ] are performed in the current region of the breit frame and of the hcm frame . in the breit frame",
    "the energy scale is related to the momentum of the scattered parton , @xmath6 .",
    "its hadronisation features are compared in fig .",
    "[ obraz1 ] with similar observables measured in one hemisphere of hadronic final states in @xmath1 annihilation described by half of the centre - of - mass energy  @xmath15 .",
    "the large uncertainties for these zeus measurements come from inclusion of the herwig hadronisation in systematic uncertainties  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ obraz2 ] an alternative energy scale to @xmath10 is considered to be the available energy in the breit current region @xmath16 and in the current region of the hcm frame @xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath16 values are multiplied by 2 for consistency with q. in figs  [ obraz1 ]  and  [ obraz2 ] the mc models show good agreement with the data except the model with the soft colour interactions ( sci ) ( fig .  [ obraz1 ] ) and herwig at high energy scales  ( fig .  [ obraz2 ] ) .",
    "three energy scales @xmath17 , @xmath2 and @xmath10 are considered .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ obraz2 ]  ( left )  the average multiplicity depends on the scale definition at scale below 10  gev .",
    "this can be understood in terms of higher order processes like bgf and migration of the emitted energy out of the breit current region . in fig .",
    "[ obraz1 ] the measurements are below the @xmath1 parameterisation at the highest @xmath3 in the vicinity of the @xmath18 resonance .",
    "the average charged multiplicities are also compared in fig .",
    "[ obraz2 ]  ( right ) with the @xmath1 data and with the fixed target dis measurements ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "the dis data are scaled up by a factor 2 since they are equivalent to one hemisphere of @xmath1 .",
    "all the measurements exhibit approximately the same dependence of the average charged multiplicity on the respective energy scale except the data from the dis fixed target experiments which deviate at energies above 15  gev due to selection criteria . more information on multiplicity characteristics can be found elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the scaled momentum spectra have been studied using an integrated luminosity of about 0.5  fb@xmath12 taken with the zeus detector @xcite and 44  pb@xmath12 with the h1 detector  @xcite .",
    "the scaled particle momentum @xmath19 is defined as the momentum of a particle measured in the breit frame scaled by the maximum momentum @xmath6 of a quark in the current region .",
    "figure  [ obraz3 ]  ( left ) shows the evolution of scaled momentum distributions as a function of the available energy defined in @xmath0 scattering by the exchanged boson virtuality @xmath3 .",
    "there is good agreement between different sets of @xmath0 data .",
    "scaling violations are observed .",
    "the evolution is compared with the evolution of the similar distributions obtained from @xmath1 experiments  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 data show similar behaviour to the @xmath1 data providing a rough demonstration of fragmentation universality .",
    "however , a detailed comparison between @xmath1 and @xmath0 shows some discrepancies . at high values of @xmath3 approaching the @xmath18 exchange region and at @xmath20",
    "there are less charged particles observed in the @xmath0 data than in @xmath1 annihilation .",
    "similar observations at @xmath21  gev@xmath22 in previous measurements have been understood in terms of higher order qcd processes which deplete the current region in the breit frame .",
    "the fragmentation function  ( ff ) represents the probability for a parton to fragment into a particular hadron carrying a fraction of the parton energy and incorporates the long distance , non - perturbative physics of the hadronisation process . like structure functions",
    ", the ff can not be calculated in perturbative qcd , but can be evolved from a starting distribution at a defined energy scale using the dglap evolution  @xcite equations .",
    "the fragmentation functions are universal and are the same in @xmath0 and @xmath1 .    the best way to exhibit the fragmentation features are hadron spectra as a function of @xmath23 in @xmath3 intervals as shown in  fig .  [ obraz3 ]  ( right ) .",
    "the spectra become softer with @xmath3 increasing .",
    "the main features of the data are reproduced by the mc predictions of ariadne and lepto ( not show here ) except normalisation at the highest @xmath3 values . the modified leading log approximation ( mlla ) , presented also in fig .",
    "[ obraz3 ]  ( right ) , describes basic properties of particle production by multi - gluon emission at leading order including colour coherence and gluon interference phenomena .",
    "the mlla calculations include hypothesis of local parton hadron duality ( lphd )  @xcite with parameters fitted to reproduce the @xmath1 data .",
    "the analytical mlla+lphd predictions describe the data at medium @xmath3 but not at the lower and highest @xmath3 .",
    "this can be partially explained by a significant migration of particles from ( or to ) the current region of the breit frame due to the contribution of boson - gluon fusion processes .",
    "as @xmath3 increases the peaks are shifted more than expected towards higher values of @xmath23 .",
    "as the energy scale @xmath10 increases the coupling constant @xmath24 decreases and amount of the soft gluon radiation increases .",
    "this leads to a fast increase of the particle density with small fractional momentum @xmath19 .",
    "the average charged multiplicity has been investigated in inclusive neutral current deep inelastic @xmath0 scattering in the kinematic range @xmath25  gev@xmath22 in terms of different energy scales .",
    "the virtuality of the exchanged boson @xmath10 and the scale @xmath17 were used in the current region of the breit frame . in the current region of the hcm frame @xmath2",
    "the energy scales @xmath17 and @xmath2 give better agreement with measurements in @xmath1 annihilation than @xmath10 .    the comparison of the scaled momentum distributions of charged particles produced in @xmath0 scattering with the same observables measured in @xmath1 annihilation support broadly the concept of quark fragmentation universality .",
    "some depletion of the scaled momentum distributions at low @xmath3 can be attributed to higher order qcd processes like bgf occurring in @xmath0 but not in @xmath1 . at high @xmath3 approaching the @xmath18 exchange region a significant depletion is also observed .",
    "the @xmath19 distributions support the concept of quark fragmentation universality in @xmath0 scattering and @xmath1 annihilation .",
    "the mlla+lphd calculations based on the @xmath1 data do not describe the distributions in the entire range of the measured @xmath3 .",
