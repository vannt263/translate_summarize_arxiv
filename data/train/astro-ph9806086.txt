    "the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) provides one of the most useful tools for understanding the physical processes in the early universe , giving valuable information about the origin and the dynamics of the primordial fluctuations that seeded the today large - scale structures .",
    "there are two competing families of cosmological theories quite distinct in this regards .",
    "+ in the models invoking most types of inflation @xcite the perturbations generation mechanism is linear and gaussian fluctuations are predicted . for a given type of inhomogeneity ( adiabatic or isocurvature )",
    "the only degree of freedom in the initial conditions is the amplitude , and since the evolution is linear , solutions scale linearly with the initial amplitude .",
    "linearity combined with the assumed statistical homogeneity of the universe guarantees that one may decompose the cosmological perturbations into eigenmodes with eigenfunctions that evolve independently . in the fourier space , for instance",
    ", the evolution of a perturbation in each mode @xmath3 is independent . for a finite sample of the cmb field ,",
    "the observed fluctuations are the convolution of the  true \" fluctuations of the infinite field with the fourier transform of a mask @xcite .",
    "the 2-point function of the the power fluctuations depends only on the selection function @xcite .",
    "+ the second class of theories , most topological defect models @xcite and some versions of inflation @xcite , predict non - gaussian statistics of the primordial perturbations . those models involve spontaneous symmetry breaking as the hot early universe cooled leading to a non - linear perturbations generation mechanism . for this type of perturbations the fourier modes @xmath3 are coupled and their evolution can not be anticipated on the basis of the initial conditions @xcite .",
    "the predicted angular power spectrum has a position dependence with a variance larger than the variance of the angular power spectrum for the gaussian case at the same multipole order @xcite .",
    "the defect theories are highly constrained by causality , the fluctuations being completely uncorrelated beyond the horizon scale at all times @xcite .",
    "+ it is difficult to make difference between gaussian and non - gaussian fluctuations of the density field at large angular scales because of the tendency of any distribution to approach gaussian statistics when averaging over large area ( the central limit theorem ) , and also because of the cosmic and sampling variances .",
    "+ in this paper we propose the wavelet transform to analyse the large scale coherence of the cmb anisotropy field with non - gaussian initial conditions .",
    "the main advantage of the wavelet transform over the fourier transform is its capability to investigate features of the cmb anisotropy maps with a resolution according to their scales @xcite .",
    "the wavelet base functions are highly localized in space and the information regarding the scale and the position are stored explicitly .",
    "also , the wavelet analysis can be performed with a finite sample of data in contrast with the fourier analysis where the result depends on the selection function .",
    "+ we employ 2-point function of power fluctuations in the wavelet space to compare cobe-_dmr _ 4-year temperature anisotropy maps to the predictions of an analytical cosmic string model @xcite .",
    "the advantage of the analytical approach is that one can obtain statistical fluctuations with non - gaussian random phases for a given experimental configuration , while the explicit dependences on the normalization of the primordial power spectrum , string parameters and angular scales can be shown .",
    "+ we use the non - gaussian likelihood function to constrain the dimensionless cosmic string parameter @xmath4 ( where @xmath5 is the newton s constant , @xmath6 is the speed of light and @xmath0 the the mass per unit length of the cosmic strings ) at @xmath2 cl in standard gaussian statistics , by comparing zero lag autocorrelation function from cobe-_dmr _ with the predictions of the cosmic string model .",

    "the temperature anisotropy induced by long strings is given by kaiser - stebbins formula @xcite : @xmath8 where : @xmath9 is the direction of observation , @xmath10 is the velocity of the string with the orientation @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath5 is the newton s constant and @xmath0 is the mass per unit length of the string",

    "+ for an experiment measuring a square map of size @xmath20 at each hubble time @xmath14 the number of @xmath21 string segments random placed over the area size @xmath22 is given by @xcite : @xmath23 we use an analytical statistical string model @xcite to take into account the combined effects of the temperature fluctuations induced by strings present between the redshift @xmath24 and today ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "+ we calculate the probability distribution functions of the temperature fluctuations induced by cosmic strings for different values of the string scaling solution parameter @xmath7 by fourier transforming the characteristic function of this model normalized to approach a gaussian distribution with zero mean and @xmath26 when @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "+ we generated cmb independent realizations , each of 6144 pixels , using the spherical harmonic representation : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the dmr gaussian window function with fwhm=@xmath30 .",
    "+ the harmonic coefficients @xmath31 are random variables with zero mean and the variances given by @xcite : @xmath32\\gamma[(9-n)/2 ] }       { \\gamma[l+(5-n)/2]\\gamma[(3+n)/2]},\\ ] ] where : @xmath33 is the quadrupole normalized amplitude and @xmath34 is the spectral index of the primordial power spectrum .",
    "+ the coefficients @xmath31 are drawn from parent populations obtained in the cosmic string model the non - gaussian amplitude distributions of @xmath31 with random phases convoluted with the spherical harmonics @xmath35 are characterized by a positive kurtosis in the resulting temperature distribution .",
    "+ we generated 800 @xmath36 full - sky realizations for each model defined by @xmath33 and @xmath7 .",
    "to each realization we added a realization of the noise determined by the instrument sensitivity and the number of observations per pixel of dmr 4-year 53ghz ( a+b)/2 map , and rejected the pixels with galactic latitude @xmath37 obtaining @xmath38 pixels .",
    "+ we generated also in the same conditions 800 @xmath36 full sky realizations for the same values of @xmath33 with @xmath31 drawn from a standard gaussian distribution with zero mean and @xmath26 .",

    "the wavelet coefficients @xmath46 are real quantities containing all the information as that contained by the fourier coefficients .",

    "+ the orthogonality condition : @xmath52    yields to : @xmath53 this last equation represents our wavelet transform convention .",

    "+ for a random non - gaussian field generated using the cosmic string model the intrinsic correlations exist only within the same scale and the equation ( 8) becomes : @xmath59 and @xmath60 contains the correlated ensemble - averaged signal .",
    "+ we define the 2-point function of the power fluctuations in the wavelet space as : @xmath61 in this paper we present the results obtained using daubechies wavelet base functions of order 4 as a typical compact orthonormal base .",
    "+ the wavelet transform applied on 2d map ( with @xmath38 pixels and @xmath62 uncorrelated scales ) acts in a pyramidal algorithm , stripping the initial map scale by scale into its correlated components .",
    "the reader may refer to the references @xcite for complete information .",
    "+ figure 1 presents the distributions of spots as a function of threshold ( expressed in number of standard deviations ) obtained for the averaged simulated maps in real and wavelet space for two types of simulations : @xmath31 with random gaussian phases ( panels a and b ) , and @xmath31 with random non - gaussian phases , obtained in the cosmic string model with @xmath63 ( panels c and d ) . for all simulations we take @xmath64k . in each case",
    "the gaussian fits are also shown .",
    "one can see that the differences between the distributions obtained in gaussian and non - gaussian case are more evident in the wavelet space than in the real space . + the maps obtained by monte - carlo simulations were wavelet transformed and then 2-point functions of the power fluctuations were constructed ( binned in @xmath65 bins , in the manner of cobe-_dmr _ ) . + figure 2 presents the 2-point function of the power fluctuations in the wavelet space @xmath66 normalized at @xmath67 .",
