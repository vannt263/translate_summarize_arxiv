    "<S> we report results of a multi - band monitoring campaign of the flat spectrum radio quasar txs0536@xmath0145 at redshift 2.69 . </S>",
    "<S> this source was detected during a very high @xmath1-ray activity state in 2012 march by the large area telescope on board _ fermi _ , becoming the @xmath1-ray flaring blazar at the highest redshift detected so far . at the peak of the flare </S>",
    "<S> the source reached an apparent isotropic @xmath1-ray luminosity of 6.6@xmath210@xmath3 erg s@xmath4 which is comparable to the values achieved by the most luminous blazars . </S>",
    "<S> this activity triggered radio - to - x - rays monitoring observations by _ swift _ , very long baseline array , european vlbi network , and medicina single - dish telescope . </S>",
    "<S> significant variability was observed from radio to x - rays supporting the identification of the @xmath1-ray source with txs0536@xmath0145 . </S>",
    "<S> both the radio and @xmath1-ray light curves show a similar behaviour , with the @xmath1-rays leading the radio variability with a time lag of about 4 - 6 months . </S>",
    "<S> the luminosity increase is associated with a flattening of the radio spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> no new superluminal component associated with the flare was detected in high resolution parsec - scale radio images . during the flare </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1-ray spectrum seems to deviate from a power law , showing a curvature that was not present during the average activity state . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1-ray properties of txs0536@xmath0145 are consistent with those shown by the high - redshift @xmath1-ray blazar population .    </S>",
