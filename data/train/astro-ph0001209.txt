    "the public archive now includes over 4400 pointed observations carried out with the high resolution imager ( hri ) during the period june 1990 to december 1997 .",
    "one obvious application of this extensive database is the investigation of the x - ray properties of particular classes of object , especially those which are available in large numbers as the result of detailed surveys carried out in other wavebands .",
    "this is the approach adopted in the present paper which focuses on the luminous discrete x - ray sources associated with nearby bright galaxies .",
    "for this purpose we use the sample of 486 bright ( @xmath0 ) predominantly northern ( @xmath13 ) galaxies studied by ho , filippenko & sargent ( 1995 ) in the context of their search for `` dwarf '' seyfert nuclei in nearby galaxies .",
    "it turns out that , of the galaxies studied by ho , filippenko and sargent ( hereafter the hfs sample ) , over @xmath1 lie within the field of view of reasonably deep ( @xmath2ks exposure ) hri observations . as part of their programme ho ,",
    "filippenko & sargent ( 1995 , 1997a , b , c ) have compiled a huge database of information pertaining to both the optical spectroscopic properties of the galaxy nuclei and the properties of the host galaxy .",
    "this comprehensive and coherent body of information provides an ideal resource for our present purpose .",
    "the first detailed studies of the x - ray properties of nearby galaxies utilised the x - ray imaging and spectroscopic capabilities of the observatory ( as summarised in the results atlas published by fabbiano , kim & trinchieri 1992 and more recently in the work of burstein et al .",
    "the einstein observations demonstrated that the x - ray emission from bright elliptical and lenticular galaxies is often dominated by their hot interstellar medium , whereas in normal spirals it is the integrated emission of evolved stellar sources , such as supernova remnants ( snrs ) and x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) which is generally most important ( see fabbiano 1989 for a review ) .",
    "studies also established that , barring the presence of a luminous active galactic nucleus ( agn ) , the x - ray luminosity exhibited by normal galaxies is typically in the range @xmath14 .",
    "observations have now added considerably to this picture .",
    "specifically the high sensitivity , soft bandpass , modest spectral resolution and @xmath15 spatial resolution of the x - ray telescope / position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) combination has greatly extended our knowledge of diffuse @xmath16 k thermal emission in galaxies and has confirmed the ubiquity of such emission not only in early type and starburst galaxies but also as a significant component in normal spirals ( e.g. read , ponman & strickland 1997 ) .",
    "both pspc and hri observations have also furthered our knowledge of the resolved point x - ray source population in nearby galaxies , for example with the detection of hundreds of such sources in m31 ( primini et al .",
    "1993 ; supper et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "although the pspc provided somewhat more sensitivity than the hri , the advantage of using data from the latter instrument is that , by and large , it is possible to focus the investigation on a single theme , namely the resolved discrete x - ray sources associated with nearby galaxies .",
    "moreover the high spatial resolution afforded by the hri ( fwhm @xmath17 ) is particularly relevant when attempting to distinguish the emission of putative low - luminosity agn from other luminous source populations in galaxies .",
    "the remainder of this paper is ordered as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the available database of hri observations , the possible impact of selection effects in the x - ray data and the method used to detect point x - ray sources in each hri field .",
    "next , in section 3 , we carry out a preliminary analysis of the x - ray source sample , distinguishing between the `` nuclear '' and `` non - nuclear '' source populations .",
    "we also estimate the likely level of contamination by foreground stars and background qsos .",
    "section 4 then investigates the incidence of luminous nuclear x - ray sources in galaxies with nuclei of different optical spectroscopic type .",
    "section 5 goes on to consider the x - ray luminosity distribution of the non - nuclear source population and the nature of the substantial subset of `` super - luminous '' sources .",
    "finally in section 6 we provide a brief summary of our findings .",
    "the relevant subset of hri pointed observations was identified by cross - correlating the rospublic database ( circa july 1998 ) available from the leicester data archive service ( ledas ) with the full list of hfs galaxy ( _ i.e. _ optical nuclear ) positions .",
    "all hri fields which encompassed the hfs galaxy position within @xmath18 of the pointing position and had an exposure of at least 10 ks were initially accepted .",
    "this process led to a set of 148 hri observations of 106 hfs galaxies ( with many of the galaxies having been observed more than once ) .",
    "however , a number of these observations were unsuitable for our purposes .",
    "the two dominant local group members , ngc 224 ( m 31 ) and ngc 598 ( m 33 ) , were not included as their full angular extent can not be imaged in a single hri observation .",
    "the hri observations of ngc 1275 and ngc 4478/4486 were not used since these galaxies lie at the centre of galaxy clusters ( perseus and virgo respectively ) and the presence of a bright intra - cluster medium confuses the x - ray field and limits the point source sensitivity . similarly to avoid the complication of the dominant hot interstellar medium in massive early type galaxies , ellipticals and lenticulars with @xmath19 were excluded , as was the bright starburst galaxy ngc 3034 ( m82 ) . finally the galaxies ngc 1052 and 4594 were rejected as southern interlopers in the hfs sample .",
    "a total of 83 galaxies remained , covered by 111 hri observations , representing roughly a @xmath20 sampling of the full hfs catalogue .",
    "hereafter we refer to our hri - observed subset of hfs galaxies as the xhfs sample .",
    "the parent hfs sample is reasonably complete in statistical terms ( see ho , filippenko & sargent 1995 ) and can certainly be considered as representative of the nearby bright galaxy population .",
    "however , our xhfs sample is subject to additional selection biases arising both from the selection criteria noted above and from the fact that quite a high fraction of the galaxies ( 78% ) were the actual target source of the hri observation .",
    "thus nearby galaxies , known to be x - ray bright on the basis of pre - observations , will be well represented in the xhfs sample , as will established x - ray luminous categories of object such as seyfert galaxies .",
    "table  [ tab1 ] gives details of how the full hfs sample of galaxies are distributed by morphological type and nuclear properties and , for comparison , provides the same information for the xhfs subset . in terms of galaxy morphology ,",
    "late - type spirals / irregular galaxies appear to be somewhat favoured .",
    "also , as expected , a relatively high fraction of the seyfert galaxies in the hfs sample were observed by the hri ( _ i.e. _ a @xmath21 fraction compared to a norm for all types of galaxy of @xmath22 ) , although in numerical terms the excess coverage amounts to only about 6 objects . despite these clear emphases in the xhfs sample ,",
    "the different morphological types and nuclear classes are , nevertheless , reasonable well sampled by the hri database .",
    "we conclude that the xhfs sample is representative of the range of galaxies that occupy the nearby universe ( except for giant ellipticals and lenticulars ) although possibly subject to a bias towards high x - ray luminosity systems ."
