    "the dose distribution of a proton pencil beam in solid or liquid matter has three parts which we will call the _ core _ , the _ halo _ ( after pedroni et al .",
    "@xcite ) and the _ aura_. they overlap , but each has distinct spatial characteristics .",
    "the _ core _ consists of primary protons which have suffered only electromagnetic ( em ) interactions : slowing down by multiple collisions with atomic electrons , and multiple coulomb scattering ( mcs ) by atomic nuclei .",
    "its cross section is gaussian , typically of the order of a centimeter , and increases with depth according to fermi - eyges theory @xcite .",
    "for an ideal pencil in homogeneous matter the transverse spreading can be written in closed form , and its maximum value in any material is proportional to range . for protons in water , @xmath3range @xcite .",
    "non - ideal pencils of finite initial size , angular divergence and emittance are easily accommodated in the gaussian approximation @xcite .",
    "the number of primaries in the core falls nearly linearly with depth @xcite due to nuclear interactions , which feed the halo and aura .",
    "the _ halo _ consists of the charged secondaries from those interactions : elastic scattering on h , elastic and inelastic scattering on o and nonelastic scattering on o. the radius of the halo ( which we will find is roughly one - third the beam range ) is comparable to typical targets in radiotherapy , so it deposits dose both where it is wanted and unwanted .",
    "being rather diffuse , it hardly affects the shape of the high - dose region , but the total energy residing in the halo must be taken into account to avoid field - size dependent errors in computing absolute dose @xcite .",
    "we will include multiple coulomb scattered protons from h and o ( the ` single scattering tail ' of the molire distribution @xcite ) in the halo even though , strictly speaking , these are primary protons which have only undergone em interactions",
    ". thus an alternative definition of the halo might be ` anything arising from charged particles which falls outside the gaussian of fermi - eyges theory ' .",
    "we exclude dose from beam contamination ( such as degraded and scattered protons from beam profile monitor wires @xcite ) entering from upstream .",
    "such contamination can be avoided by appropriate beam line design and , if present , is more properly treated as a ` secondary core ' to be transported using fermi - eyges theory .",
    "lastly , the _ aura _ consists of neutral secondaries from inelastic and nonelastic nuclear interactions : @xmath4rays and neutrons .",
    "it extends many meters , pervading the patient , treatment room , shielding and facility and depositing unwanted dose in all .",
    "its relative contribution to the high - dose region is negligible .",
    "our measurements clearly reveal the transition between the halo and the aura .    at 177mev about 12% of the beam energy is lost to nonelastic nuclear reactions ( appendix [ app : energylost ] ) .",
    "it is thought @xcite that about one - third of that or 4% goes into the aura .",
    "the halo exists , of course , in both scattered and magnetically scanned beams , but by tradition it is treated differently . in scattering",
    ", it undoubtedly affects measurements and semiempirical models of the beam monitor output factor , but is usually not broken out explicitly .",
    "only recently @xcite has its role in the field - size dependence of scattered beams been considered . by contrast , in pencil beam scanning ( pbs ) the desired absolute dose distribution is computed by summing over all pencils sufficiently near the point of interest .",
    "the halo must be explicitly included , to some adequate approximation , in the model of the pencil , and ` sufficiently near ' must be defined accordingly .",
    "therefore , with the advent of pbs facilities , a number of groups have published measurements and/or monte carlo studies of the halo .",
    "these have tended to focus narrowly on a clinical goal , correcting field size dependence of the absolute dose .",
    "often , energy - dependent parameterizations ( all complicated , and no two alike ) are reported , at the expense of actual measurements .",
    "beams and techniques designed for pbs treatment , not experiment , are used in the measurements .",
    "though something is learned from each study , no complete overall picture of the halo has yet emerged .",
    "our goal is the opposite . laying aside clinical concerns for the moment ,",
    "we wish to obtain as complete as possible a picture of the halo at a single energy .",
    "as we define it , the halo in water must , after all , be universal : beyond some small radius , it is little affected by the core @xcite .",
    "the measurement can be done with conventional equipment in a test beam . eventually , of course",
    ", one will need to measure a number of energies similarly .",
    "in addition to extensive raw data , which span five orders of magnitude , we will present a model - dependent ( md ) and a model - independent ( mi ) fit .",
    "the md fit is not very good ; it is rather complicated and not very portable .",
    "it does , however , confirm what basic nuclear reactions are involved and how they determine the shape of the halo .",
    "it is complemented by the mi fit which is better , easy to apply to any data set , and yields the most convenient function @xmath5 for exportation and further computation . by no means",
    "do we claim that _ either _ fit is the most efficient for any given task , and we report all our absolute dose measurements to invite further work .    in the model - dependent fit and",
    "elsewhere we require the range - energy relation of protons in water .",
    "we will use the 1982 data of janni @xcite because a growing body of experimental evidence @xcite suggests these are quite accurate , and better than icru publication49 @xcite which gives ranges in water some 0.9% smaller .",
    "ultimately , the best use of our measurements may be as a benchmark for monte - carlo ( mc ) electromagnetic ( em ) and nuclear models . as we shall see , different reaction types are rather cleanly separated in the halo , which may make it easier to diagnose problems ( if any ) with the mc .",
    "the crucial advantage of the halo as an mc test lies in the fact that the _ entire _ halo ( outside the core ) is of nuclear origin .",
    "by contrast , in the large - field depth - dose distribution ( bragg peak ) nuclear effects contribute @xcite but are of secondary importance .",
    "the present work is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : medium ] is an overview of the medium energy reactions that dominate the halo .",
    "their kinematics , also discussed , predict the halo size rather well .",
    "section[sec : measurement ] describes our measurement .",
    "key features are the use of a test beam whose current can be adjusted over a wide range , an integral monitor rather than a reference chamber for normalization , and using scans in depth rather than transverse scans .",
    "section [ sec : md ] describes the model - dependent fit and section [ sec : mi ] , the model - independent fit .",
    "section [ sec : review ] is a review of the literature .",
    "section [ sec : discussion ] is a general discussion . in it",
    "we take issue with the prevailing parameterization of the halo , and not just the gaussian transverse profile , which has already been improved by others .",
    "more fundamentally , we dispute the role of integral depth dose in the parameterization and therefore , the pervasive role of the ` bragg peak chamber ' ( bpc ) .    throughout",
    ", we discuss each topic in rather general terms , leaving mathematical details to the appendices .",
    "the halo ( look ahead to figs.[fig : dmlg ] and [ fig : dmlin ] ) will be found to have two distinctive components .",
    "the first is a bragg - like peak due to elastic and inelastic scattering on h and o. it persists to quite large radii , as already implied by fig.5 of pedroni et al . @xcite .",
    "the second is a broad sideways dose enhancement , generally due to a mix of charged secondaries from nonelastic reactions on o. we expect sideways protons from the relatively simple reactions @xmath6h(p , p)@xmath6h and @xmath7o(p,2p)@xmath8n to form the outer envelope of this region .",
    "the final states of these two- and three - body processes are easily characterized .",
    "doing so , to estimate the halo size , is the main object of this section .",
    "first , however , we will provide some background .",
    "the reader familiar with medium energy nuclear physics should skip to section[sec : haloradius ] .",
    "physics in the 70 to 300mev regime was studied extensively in the 1950s and 60s , the era of the synchrocyclotron .",
    "radiotherapy with protons in this energy range , already proposed in 1946 @xcite , was just beginning . at these energies",
    "the proton is an elementary particle .",
    "its internal states can not be excited ; still less are its constituent quarks evident .",
    "its de broglie wavelength is smaller than the nucleus , pion production is negligible , and the nucleus is relatively transparent .",
    "it can easily knock protons , neutrons and clusters ( such as @xmath9particles ) out of the nucleus , their binding energies being of order 10mev .",
    "relativistic kinematics are appropriate , though the nonrelativistic approximation is not terrible",
    ".    coherent and incoherent reactions take place . in the former , elastic and inelastic scattering ,",
    "the proton interacts with the nucleus as a whole and the recoiling residual nucleus is the same as the target , though it may be in an excited state . in the latter",
    ", the proton interacts with constituents of the target nucleus .",
    "the residual nucleus differs from the target nucleus but may nevertheless ( through the magic of quantum mechanics ) be left in its own ground state .",
    "these are nonelastic reactions , with the important subgroup of quasi - elastic ( qe ) ( ` quasi - free ' or ` knockout ' ) reactions , in which just a single proton , neutron or cluster is knocked out .    in water , elastic scattering on free hydrogen also occurs .",
    "kinematically , it can be treated either as a special case of elastic or of qe scattering . in reactions with o , the recoil nucleus has a small fraction of the total energy and a very short range .",
    "by contrast , in scattering on h the projectile and target have the same mass . in the final state , they are indistinguishable , and separated by 90@xmath10 .",
    "we cite just two experimental papers from an extensive literature .",
    "gerstein et al .",
    "@xcite studied elastic scattering on various targets at the harvard cyclotron before it acquired a proper 160mev external beam and long before it was converted to medical use .",
    "their experiment was performed in a scattered - out 96mev beam of 10@xmath11 protons / sec and a collimated cross section of @xmath12in@xmath13 in ( fig.[fig : gerstein1 ] ) .",
    "they did not study o but their c results ( fig.[fig : gerstein3 ] ) will suffice since we are only interested in the general nature of the angular distribution .",
    "elastic scattering obeys an optical model .",
    "the nucleus behaves like an absorbing disk with a diffuse boundary .",
    "the angular distribution has diffraction minima and maxima whose sharpness increases with atomic number .",
    "the sharp drop at small angles seen in fig.[fig : gerstein3 ] is the single scattering tail of the molire distribution @xcite . here",
    "the proton interacts coherently with the nucleus , but via the coulomb rather than the nuclear force . since the final states of the two processes are indistinguishable",
    ", they interfere quantum mechanically leading to the ` coulomb interference ' dip seen near 5@xmath10 . thereafter the nuclear force takes over and the cross section falls at a more leisurely rate , with shallow diffraction features .    as concerns the halo , we need take away only two facts from fig.[fig : gerstein3 ] .",
    "the angular dependence is exponential ( not gaussian ) , and it extends to angles far greater than multiple or single coulomb scattering .",
    "the systematics of inelastic scattering are similar .",
    "the residual nucleus is left in one of its many excited states , and usually decays by @xmath0 emission .",
    "excitation tends to happen at larger momentum transfers ( larger angles ) and will shift and broaden the bragg - like peak in the halo at large radii .",
    "elastic scattering results are always presented in the center - of - mass ( cm ) frame rather than the lab frame . for completeness appendix[app",
    ": cm ] presents the transformation , even though the details do not matter much in the present context since we merely require the general shape of the angular distribution . for elastic scattering on o ,",
    "the lab and cm angles are nearly the same .",
    "in quasi - elastic ( qe ) scattering experiments e.g. @xmath14  ( @xmath15mev ) the final state consists of two protons and a recoiling residual nucleus .",
    "( the @xmath16 of a reaction equals the rest energy of the reactants minus the rest energy of the products .",
    "if @xmath16 is negative , kinetic energy is lost in the reaction . )",
    "measuring the energies and directions of the outgoing protons allows us to compute the kinetic energy lost in the reaction ( the binding energy of the target proton ) as well as the momentum of the recoil nucleus .",
    "the latter is interesting for the following reason .",
    "nucleons confined to the nucleus are not at rest .",
    "they have finite momenta corresponding to a few mev of kinetic energy .",
    "their momentum distributions are given by fermi s model or , more accurately for light nuclei , nuclear shell model waveforms .",
    "qe experiments are performed to study these momentum distributions . in a simple picture of the reaction , the target nucleus is viewed as a two - body system , the target proton and the recoil - nucleus - to - be , with equal and opposite momenta since the whole is at rest in the lab . if we now assume that , during the reaction , neither the incident nor the ejected proton interact with the rest of the nucleus , the momentum of the residual nucleus is equal and opposite to that of the target proton before the reaction .",
    "the residual nucleus is often called a ` spectator ' .",
    "neglecting secondary interactions is an approximation , albeit a fairly good one for light nuclei and higher incident energies . because secondary interactions do play some role , the observed distributions are called ` distorted ' momentum distributions .",
    "the best data on @xmath7o come from a massive experiment by tyrn et al .",
    "@xcite using magnetic spectrometers at the chicago synchrocyclotron ( fig.[fig : tyren1 ] ) .",
    "according to the nuclear shell model @xmath7o should have two protons in a p@xmath17 angular momentum state , four in a p@xmath18 state , and two in an s state .",
    "the distribution of missing kinetic energy ( fig.[fig : tyren12 ] , top ) indeed shows three well separated groups . in tyrn s geometry , the distribution of the separation angle of the two protons is equivalent to a distribution of the recoil nucleus momentum , with zero momentum near 40@xmath10 .",
    "the dip there shows that p state protons , by virtue of their orbital angular momentum , have zero probability of being found with zero momentum .",
    "however , the dip is considerably filled in by secondary interactions and experimental resolution .",
    "later , we will need the binding energies and most probable momenta that can be derived from these results .",
    "they are @xmath19mev , @xmath20mev for the @xmath21 state protons , and @xmath22mev , @xmath20mev for the @xmath23 protons .",
    "these numbers agree well with an earlier experiment at 160mev @xcite .",
    "we will find that elastic scattering on h has the same general kinematics as ( p,2p ) scattering on o , and that is all we really need to know as far as the halo is concerned .",
    "elastic scattering on h was studied extensively to determine the nucleon - nucleon interaction itself ( rather than nuclear structure ) and is therefore found in a separate category of papers .",
    "monograph @xcite includes a good experimental account .",
    "the mathematics of the center - of - mass ( cm ) transformation ( which wilson takes for granted ) is covered in our appendix[app : cm ] .",
    "we are now in a position to estimate the maximum radius of charged secondaries from nonelastic reactions .",
    "though there are many such reactions , maximum range will obtain for the lightest ( and incidentally most common ) charged secondaries , protons , and for those reactions that distribute the available kinetic energy among the fewest secondaries , namely ( p,2p ) reactions .",
    "we now turn the reasoning of section[sec : qe ] around , assuming the numbers given there as the most likely parameters of the recoil nucleus and deducing the energy and angle , hence transverse range , of one of the protons .",
    "elastic scattering on free h is a special case of the same calculation .",
    "appendix[app : qe ] gives the mathematical details .",
    "fig.[fig : halobump ] shows the loci of secondary proton stopping points , using a 180mev incident pencil beam , for elastic scattering on h and qe scattering on o using parameters given above and in the caption .",
    "we assume all reactions occur on the @xmath24 axis , ignoring the size of the pencil beam .",
    "in the qe case we have chosen the direction of the recoil nucleus to maximize the transverse range of the more energetic outgoing proton .",
    "in fig.[fig : halobump ] the reaction is assumed to take place at one of five points along the incident proton s path , corresponding to five ` incident energies ' .",
    "since the target proton has a distribution of momenta of which we have only used the most likely , we must imagine a broad band around each of the qe cases .",
    "still , the overall picture is clear .",
    "the most probable qe scatter adds only slightly to elastic scattering .",
    "we also observe that , because of the loss of kinetic energy to @xmath25 , elastic scattering on h eventually dominates at the largest radii .",
    "we now perform the same calculation at several incident energies , finding the maximum radius at each .",
    "that leads to fig.[fig : halomax ] . the maximum radius , without allowing for beam size , is seen to be roughly one - third the range of the incident beam . that has implications , which we will discuss later , for the size of the bpc often used in characterizing the halo .",
    "in summary , we have tried to convey the flavor of relevant nuclear physics at radiotherapy beam energies and have used kinematic arguments to estimate the radius of the halo .",
    "it was fig.[fig : halobump ] that prompted us to do longitudinal rather than radial scans because it suggests that , at large radii , the ` nonelastic bump ' should come and go with depth , as proves to be the case .",
    "we used the experimental beam line at the burr center . emerging from a 0.008 cm kapton window",
    "the nominal 177mev beam passed through a 150 cm helium bag , a 30 cm air gap and a beam monitor before entering the water tank .",
    "the beam size corresponded to @xmath26 cm as determined by fits to the data discussed later .",
    "the beam monitor was an air filled plane parallel ionization chamber ( ic ) of in - house design whose gain had previously been determined as 96.8 at 177mev . though hermetically sealed , it has slack windows and therefore behaves as a vented chamber .",
    "recombination is negligible under the beam conditions used here .",
    "the electronics chain ( also in - house ) consisted of a recycling integrator ( 10pc / count ) , a divide - by-10@xmath27 prescaler and a presettable counter that turned off the beam , for an overall calibration of @xmath28p / mu ( mu = monitor unit ) .",
    "the crs water tank @xcite was used for positioning only .",
    "the beam was offset to one side of the tank .",
    "a lateral extension to the ionization chamber holder allowed us to position the dosimeter at distances up to 10 cm from the nominal beam center .",
    "the dosimeter was an exradin t1 ( 0.053@xmath29 collection volume , internal diameter 0.4 cm ) biased to 300v , read out by keithley model 6512 electrometer .",
    "the t1 calibration factor was 76.37cgy / nc @xmath30% at stp .",
    "since both the monitor and field ic were effectively vented , it would have sufficed to know both calibrations at stp ( independent of the atmospheric pressure on the day of measurement ) to compute the absolute dose per proton .",
    "unfortunately the multiplication of 96.8 mentioned above was measured at an unrecorded pressure .",
    "( the experimental beam line is normally used for non - clinical measurements where a few percent absolute error is unimportant . ) unfortunately , before the monitor ic could be recalibrated at known pressure , it was physically damaged and had to be rebuilt .",
    "the resulting uncertainty , say @xmath31% , dominates the absolute dose per proton .",
    "the main experiment was performed by positioning the t1 at radii ranging from 0 to 10 cm and taking , at each radius , measurements at selected points between 1.53 cm water equivalent ( the lowest obtainable ) to 25 cm ( well beyond the bragg peak ) . at each radius",
    "the number of mu was set ( between 2 and 500 ) to obtain a convenient keithley reading and from time to time the beam current was adjusted ( between 1 and 33na ) to obtain a convenient counting time ( @xmath32s to 15s ) .",
    "the entire experiment took about 6 hours .",
    "drift current was measured to be 0.5pc/15s just after the @xmath33 cm ( lowest dose rate ) run .",
    "since this was only 2% of the lowest signal observed , we have ignored it .",
    "recombination in the t1 chamber was explored by taking data at the bragg peak over a wide range of beam currents .",
    "the signal per mu changed less than 1% .",
    "two or more readings at each point were averaged and converted to absolute dose in mev / g / p ( 1mev / g = 0.1602ngy ) .",
    "subsequent analysis would have been easier had all measurements been taken over the full range in @xmath24 . for the mi fit we had to invent points at some values of @xmath34 to fill out the @xmath24 range .",
    "( they are not shown in our graphs , and do not affect the results . ) nonuniform spacing in @xmath24 , appropriate to the rate of variation of the dose , causes no problems .",
    "table[tbl : dmlg ] gives our data ( some 300 points ) in the form log@xmath35(dose/(mev / g / p ) ) .",
    "fig.[fig : dmlg ] shows them in semilog format , and fig.[fig : dmlin ] in linear format .",
    "fig.[fig : dmlg ] illustrates the virtue of longitudinal ( rather than radial ) scans and foretokens the difficulty of fitting any single radial profile to the data .",
    "a prominent feature is the bragg peak which persists to quite large radii , becoming somewhat shallower .",
    "we also see the distinct change in character between the halo and the aura .",
    "the semilog plot shows it best distal to the bragg peak at small radii , while the linear plots show it as a broad background to the nonelastic bump at larger radii .",
    "we have measured the core / halo dose at a finite number of points @xmath36 . for further work ( e.g. estimation of field - size effects ) it is convenient to reduce these data to a continuous function @xmath5 .",
    "we offer two such fits , one model - dependent ( md ) and the other model - independent ( mi ) .    the md fit , described in this section , is rather complicated , difficult to optimize , and certainly not unique .",
    "however , it does give some insight into the kinds of reactions that contribute and in roughly what proportion , and may be scalable to other energies .",
    "the mi fit described in the next section is more straightforward , more accurate , and considerably more portable .",
    "it is probably more suitable for follow - on computations .    as before ,",
    "we reserve mathematical details for the appendices .",
    "anticipating that core / halo measurements at other energies will scale with beam range , we have expressed most of the functions in the md fit in terms of dimensionless normalized depth @xmath37 and radius @xmath38 .",
    "the arbitrary ` 3 ' is based on the considerations of section[sec : qe ] .      the md and mi functions to be fitted and the optimization technique are entirely different but",
    "the final figure of merit is the same .",
    "we seek a least - squares fit , but ordinary @xmath39 will not work because of the orders - of - magnitude variation of @xmath5 .",
    "therefore we minimize @xmath39 as computed in @xmath40 space .",
    "if the fit is relatively good , that is equivalent to minimizing the mean squared deviation from 1 of the _ ratio _ of measured @xmath41 to fitted @xmath42 since , provided @xmath43 is not too different from 1 , it is easy to show that @xmath44      let @xmath45 be the physical absorbed dose per incident proton .",
    "since physical doses add , the dose everywhere in an infinite water tank from a pencil beam can be written as a sum of electromagnetic , nuclear elastic , nuclear nonelastic ( subscripted ` qe ' for ` quasi - elastic ' ) and aura doses : @xmath46 we have assumed radial symmetry , which will obtain if the incident beam is radially symmetric . )",
    "can easily be generalized to @xmath47 . ]",
    "the categories implied by eq.[eqn : d ] are flexible .",
    "for instance , we think of @xmath48 as including dose from the single scattering tail of the molire distribution even though that is a coulomb interaction .",
    "similarly , we include elastic scattering from free h in @xmath49 .",
    "@xmath50 will be found to include a tiny dose from recoil nuclei .",
    "in other words , eq.[eqn : d ] is meant to separate processes according to their pattern of dose deposition rather than any strict classification scheme .    without losing generality",
    "we can write dose as fluence @xmath51 ( p/@xmath52 ) , the areal density of particles at a point in space , times mass stopping power @xmath53 ( mev / g)/(p/@xmath52 ) , their mass rate of energy deposition . fluence in turn can be expressed as the product of a function @xmath54 , normalized such that @xmath55 and a dimensionless multiplier @xmath56 ( a normalizing constant ) .",
    "thus @xmath57 such a decomposition is helpful only if we have independent models of the factors @xmath54 and @xmath53 for each process . that is completely true for ` em ' , less so for ` el ' and so on .",
    "by the time we reach ` au ' the fit is purely empirical and we will simply fit @xmath58 directly .      not surprisingly , this is the term we know most about .",
    "it can be computed almost entirely from first principles .",
    "its adjustable parameters are needed only because of our ignorance of parameters of the incident beam , numbers which in principle could be measured by ancillary experiments .",
    "the only exception is @xmath59 , the number of primaries remaining at @xmath24 .",
    "we will set it equal to @xmath60 where @xmath9 itself depends linearly on @xmath24 .. ] our @xmath9 differs from the similar parameter ( @xmath61/cm ) employed by bortfeld @xcite , which only accounts for _ nonelastic _ reactions @xcite .",
    "@xmath62 is a 2d cylindrical gaussian .",
    "in other words our @xmath63 is the _ projected _ transverse width parameter . ]",
    "@xmath64 @xmath65 is found by means of fermi - eyges theory , which transports the parameters of the incident beam ( transverse spread , angular spread and emittance ) to any depth @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "for details see appendix[app : sigem ] .",
    "@xmath66 is an electromagnetic stopping power based on the bethe - bloch @xmath67 @xcite convolved with a 1d gaussian",
    "whose @xmath68 combines range straggling with the energy spread of the incident beam . unlike bortfeld @xcite we perform that convolution numerically . since that is computationally expensive ,",
    "we tabulate a family of curves at several values of @xmath68 and interpolate as necessary during the search for a fit . because @xmath69 is singular at end - of - range ,",
    "a cutoff procedure is required .",
    "for details see appendix[app : sem ] .    in summary",
    ", the electromagnetic term has a simple form which , if the incident beam parameters are known , is mostly derivable from first principles : @xmath70 where @xmath66 is an electromagnetic stopping power which includes the energy spread of the incident beam , @xmath71 is a gaussian which , via @xmath72 , describes the beam s transverse characteristics , and @xmath9 is empirical .",
    "because @xmath9 is of order @xmath73 cm the core retains most of the integrated dose ( energy ) .",
    "we estimated the energy lost to nonelastic reactions in appendix [ app : energylost ] .",
    "we have reviewed elastic scattering in section[sec : elastic ] .",
    "the angular dependence is roughly exponential .",
    "elastic reactions feeding the halo can occur anywhere along the primary track . to a considerable extent that does not matter . because the angles are relatively small , the scattered protons will stop at more or less the same depth . for the transverse dependence @xmath54 we will use a 2d exponential with a variable @xmath74 width",
    "namely @xmath75 @xmath76 is independent of @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath76 would be normalized with @xmath77 if @xmath78 were constant .",
    "we will allow @xmath78 to be a polynomial in @xmath79 but still keep the form of eq.[eqn : e2d ] .",
    "since elastically scattered protons , as well as large - angle single scatters , are barely distinguishable from primaries , we can still use @xmath80 for the stopping power .",
    "the number of such protons crossing a plane at @xmath24 is proportional to the number of primaries that have interacted so a normalizing constant of the form @xmath81 seems appropriate .    at larger radii",
    "we observe the bragg peak to pull back and broaden somewhat .",
    "the pullback is presumably due to a combination of trigonometry and the increase of nuclear recoil energy with angle ; the broadening , to an increased admixture of inelastic reactions at larger momentum transfers .",
    "we parameterize this effect by allowing both @xmath82 and @xmath83 to depend on @xmath84 .",
    "the electromagnetic stopping power then has the form @xmath85 we use this same general form throughout since the modification has no effect at small @xmath79 .      of the many nonelastic channels , quasi - elastic ( p,2p ) and ( p , pn ) reactions",
    "contribute the most , have simple final states , and define the envelope of the halo at mid range ( section[sec : qe ] , appendix[app : qe ] ) .",
    "to conform to our computer program we subscript nonelastic reactions ` qe ' .",

    "the parameters best determined and most likely to be useful in further work are those associated with the electromagnetic or core term : the fitted range @xmath113 , its spread @xmath68 combining straggling and beam energy width , and the transverse size of the incident beam @xmath114 as well as ( much less well determined ) its angular divergence and emittance .",
    "the overall compliance of the md fit to measurement , about 15% , is unimpressive . on the other hand , we can not reasonably expect a handful of simple functions to describe a phenomenon of this complexity . only an accurate monte carlo program can hope to do that .",
    "because of the complexity of the md fit we sought an alternative that would be more portable and hopefully more accurate",
    ".    the first strategy that comes to mind is suggested by figs.[fig : dmlg ] and [ fig : trans12 ] : describe @xmath5 by a polynomial in @xmath24 whose coefficients are polynomials in @xmath34 or vice versa . that is a straightforward and unique linear least - squares fit .",

    "] we call them ` mixed ' because they mix electromagnetic and nuclear effects .",
    "that is clear from pedroni s section2.2.2 , the definition and physical model of @xmath1 .",

    "mathematically , the same result could be obtained by filling those annuli uniformly with pencil beams , adding up their contributions on axis , and dividing by the total number of protons .",
    "thus @xmath125 is directly related to the central axis depth dose or ` bragg peak ' in a sufficiently broad uniform beam of quasi - monoenergetic protons .",
    "more precisely , it is the ( dose to water ) per ( fluence in air ) on the axis of a monoenergetic beam broad enough that nuclear equilibrium prevails . that has long been a quantity of interest in the description of scattered proton beams .",
    "@xmath125 is basically bortfeld s analytic bragg peak @xcite , the object modeled by berger s ptran monte carlo @xcite , and the topic of numerous other papers . by assuming coulomb and nuclear equilibrium , so that small excursions from the axis make no difference",

    "we could fill our water tank with pencils and measure the depth - dose on axis . however , with a single dosimeter that would be very time consuming because each point in the depth - dose requires a complete set of pencils .",
    "the preferred method , introduced by pedroni at al . @xcite and suggested by eq.[eqn : sav ] , is to scan a single pencil on axis in a water tank using a plane - parallel ic ( ppic ) of large radius .",

    "the former is generally conceded to be too small .",
    "as we will see , several papers employ it but use monte carlo to correct for the missing dose .    in the present work we have measured and parameterized the core / halo to a large radius , so we can carry out the integral of eq.[eqn : sav ] numerically on real data .",

    "( if one has to chose a few key depths , one should measure near zero , at mid range , and near the bragg peak . )",
    "we have also shown that , using a fluence calibrated plane parallel ionization chamber instead of a reference chamber , it is as easy to obtain absolute doses as relative ones . stating results in mev / g / p rather than gy / mu makes it easier to compare measurements from various sites .    our positioning accuracy , dosimeter size and absolute accuracy could certainly be improved .",

    "but that is taken care of by a proper transverse model of the halo , which indeed overlaps the central region cf .",
    "figs[fig : trans12 ] and [ fig : trans21 ] .",
    "unlike @xcite eq.2z we do not , in our model - dependent fit , use different stopping powers in the core and halo .",
    "we use @xmath66 for both .",
    "@xmath66 is exactly correct for the core and very nearly correct for the elastic / inelastic component of the halo .",
    "it is obviously not correct for the nonelastic component , or at the very least depends upon @xmath34 as well as @xmath24 .",
    "but in that component we merely use it to set the overall absolute scale , so to speak .",
    "the more complicated behavior of the bump is absorbed into other parameters , and we could obtain an equally good fit without explicitly using @xmath66 .    it remains to consider the quantitative effect of erroneously using @xmath125 for both core and halo .",
    "the most serious error may be in the core around mid range ( cf .",
    "fig[fig : pedlinfitem ] , @xmath120 ) .",
    "the spurious dose enhancement is in the high - dose region and therefore may result in an incorrect target dose especially for small fields requiring few pencils . in the halo it may contribute , as argued previously , to the de - emphasis of the bragg peak noted in fig.[fig : pedlinfitem ] .",
    "if our previous section is correct , the bragg peak chamber is a red herring .",
    "measurements with a bragg peak chamber and monte carlo corrections for its being too small are not necessary in parameterizing the pencil beam .",
    "the proof is this very paper .",
    "we have displayed two independent fits to the core / halo , never mentioning integral depth - dose until we came to discuss the literature .",
    "@xmath125 is still needed in computing weight factors if we wish to use pbs to make a large uniform sobp with a flat depth - dose on axis .",
    "but that ( apart from commissioning studies ) is precisely the clinical case where we are least likely to use pbs .",
    "large uniform fields are more efficiently delivered by scattered beams , unless we need magnetic deflection to maintain penetration .",
    "if @xmath125 is required it can be obtained , as we did , by numerically integrating point measurements of the core / halo .",
    "alternatively , one can use a small dosimeter in a sufficiently large water tank , or a sufficiently large multi - layer ionization chamber ( mlic ) , on the axis of a large uniform field .",
    "except for time structure , the dosimeter does not know whether that field was obtained by scattering or magnetic scanning .",
    "we have integrated the dose over @xmath34 from 0 to 10 cm to obtain @xmath187 ( mev / cm ) .",
    "it is instructive to further integrate that over @xmath24 .",
    "that should equal the beam energy except for the energy deposited by neutrals ( the aura ) outside a cylinder of length 23 cm and diameter 20 cm .",
    "we performed that integral four ways .",
    "first , recognizing that we did not really measure the halo for @xmath192",
    "cm , we integrated from 2 to 23 cm and compared the answer with the residual energy at 2 cm .",
    "we also took the integral from 0 to 23 compared with the full energy , and each of those using the md and mi model .",
    "the four answers are very similar , and averaging them we obtain @xmath193 ( 1@xmath63 ) for the energy defect @xmath155 ( beam energy / full integral ) @xmath139 1 .    at first glance that seems rather large .",
    "the energy lost to nonelastics is about 12% ( appendix [ app : energylost ] ) and one - third of that or 4% is thought to go to neutrals @xcite .",
    "however , the integral is directly affected by the absolute normalization of our measurements . if our numbers were 4% low , that would account for the difference . at present all we can say is that the full integral is in the right ballpark , and shows that our absolute numbers are not wildly off .",
    "our investigation of the core / halo may have inadvertently solved an old problem .",
    "when a broad proton beam is sent into a water tank from air or vacuum , a dose buildup of a few percent with a characteristic length of the order of 1@xmath1392 cm is observed .",
    "this comes from charged secondaries , mostly protons , and was already measured in 1977 by carlsson and carlsson @xcite .",
    "they noted that the magnitude of the buildup ( at 185mev ) was smaller than expected .",
    "however , ` expected ' refers to conditions of transverse nuclear equilibrium , with the beam radius comparable to one - third the range , or @xmath146 cm .",
    "unfortunately carlsson and carlsson did not report their beam size but assuming ( as is very likely ) that it was smaller , they would have observed a smaller buildup .",
    "a consequence of the core / halo model is that nuclear buildup as measured on axis by any detector of finite ( but not very large ) transverse size is a fairly complex matter , and its magnitude will be smaller than at equilibrium .      at the risk of repeating ourselves",
    "we revisit the definition of ` primaries ' and ` secondaries ' .",
    "obviously any outgoing non - proton is a secondary .",
    "recoil nuclei ( except from scattering on h ) are a special case and , as we have shown , can be ignored to a good approximation .",
    "protons are the only contributor to the core and by far the largest contributor to the halo .",
    "they arise from    1 .",
    "multiple coulomb scattering , nearly gaussian transverse distribution .",
    "2 .   single coulomb scattering , tends to @xmath194 distribution ( molire tail ) .",
    "3 .   coherent nuclear scattering , elastic , roughly exponential , quantum interference with 2 . 4 .   coherent nuclear scattering , inelastic , resembles 3 with peak shifted . 5 .   incoherent nuclear scattering , nonelastic , peaks around mid range .",
    "we have proposed that all final state protons except the first category be termed ` secondaries ' .",
    "the strongest argument for that definition is that it includes final state protons from elastic scattering on h , which strongly resemble the last category kinematically .",
    "it also means that anything non - gaussian is a secondary .",
    "it appears that different monte carlos handle this issue differently .",
    "the measurements reported here ( table[tbl : dmlg ] ) are by far the best data set yet available with which to benchmark the nuclear model of a monte carlo in the energy region appropriate to proton radiotherapy .",
    "the region dominated by em effects ( core ) and the region dominated by nuclear effects ( halo ) are separated nearly as well as can be ( a smaller beam would be better ) , so that any defects in the nuclear model should be separable from those in the mcs model and therefore comparatively easy to diagnose .",
    "an advantage of our data set is that division into primaries and secondaries is unnecessary .",
    "they are separated by their spatial characteristics , and a single run even with mcnpx should reproduce table[tbl : dmlg ] . at large @xmath34",
    ", statistics will obviously be a problem , and the dose should be scored in annuli , perhaps with @xmath195 increasing with @xmath34 and @xmath196 decreasing around the bragg peak if that is feasible .",
    "the comparison with mc should be absolute , and the units should be mev / g / p .",
    "we have measured the core / halo at 177mev using a test beam , depth scans at fixed distances from the beam in a water tank , a fluence calibrated beam monitor , and a small dose calibrated thimble chamber . though our measurements could be improved in absolute accuracy , dosimeter size , and positioning accuracy , they are the most comprehensive to date , and presented in full ( table[tbl : dmlg ] )",
    ".    we also present model - dependent and model - independent fits to out data .",
    "the former breaks the dose down into component nuclear processes , and therefore gives some measure of the contribution of each .",
    "however it is complicated and therefore not very portable .",
    "the latter is quite simple and a better fit , but takes no advantage at all of the physics .",
    "a hybrid approach using calculation from first principles for the em part ( core ) but model independent for the rest ( halo ) may ultimately prove more convenient for computing dose distributions in pbs .",
    "we reviewed the literature and found the parametrization of pedroni et al .",
    "used universally , sometimes with the gaussian transverse dependence of the halo improved . in our opinion there is a more fundamental problem . a stopping power that mixes electromagnetic and nuclear processes",
    "is used where a purely electromagnetic one is indicated .",
    "if that is true , the considerable fraction of the literature given over to bragg peak chamber measurements , corrected by monte carlo or empirical means , is irrelevant .",
    "our data set should provide an incisive test of monte carlo nuclear models .",
    "one need simply send a beam , with the initial parameters found in our mode - dependent fit , into a water tank , and look at the absolute dose to water ( mev / g / p ) everywhere . outside the core ( which , by the way , tests the electromagnetic model ) the dose is of purely nuclear origin and not masked ( as in bragg peak measurements ) by much larger electromagnetic effects .",
    "bg thanks harvard university , the physics department , and the laboratory for particle physics and cosmology for their continuing support .",
    "we thank drs .",

    "( in this calculation , unlike the rest of the paper , we treat elastically and inelastically scattered protons as primaries .",

    "<S> the dose distribution of a monoenergetic pencil beam in a water tank may conveniently be divided into a _ core _ , </S>",
    "<S> a _ halo _ and an _ aura_. the core consists of primary protons which suffer multiple coulomb scattering ( mcs ) and slow down by multiple collisions with atomic electrons ( bethe - bloch theory ) . </S>",
    "<S> their number slowly decreases because of nuclear interactions , which feed the halo and aura .    </S>",
    "<S> the halo consists of charged secondary particles , many but not all of them protons , from elastic interactions with h , elastic and inelastic interactions with o , and nonelastic interactions with o. after reviewing these reactions , we show by kinematics that the maximum radius of the halo must be roughly 1/3 the beam range .    </S>",
    "<S> the aura , extending many meters , consists of neutral secondaries ( neutrons and @xmath0-rays ) and the charged particles they set in motion .    </S>",
    "<S> we measure the core / halo using a 177mev test beam offset in a water tank . </S>",
    "<S> the beam monitor is a fluence calibrated plane parallel ionization chamber ( ic ) and the field chamber , a dose calibrated exradin t1 , so the dose measurements are absolute ( mev / g / p ) . </S>",
    "<S> we perform depth - dose scans at ten displacements from the beam axis ranging from 0 to 10 cm , adjusting the beam current and the sensitivity of the keithley electrometer as required . </S>",
    "<S> the dose spans five orders of magnitude , and the transition from halo to aura is clearly visible .    </S>",
    "<S> we perform model - dependent ( md ) and model - independent ( mi ) fits to the data . </S>",
    "<S> the md fit separates the dose into core ( electromagnetic ) , elastic nuclear , nonelastic nuclear , and aura components . </S>",
    "<S> it reveals roughly how much each process contributes . </S>",
    "<S> it has 25 parameters , and the goodness of fit ( global rms ratio measurement / fit ) is 15% . </S>",
    "<S> the mi fit uses cubic splines in depth and radius . </S>",
    "<S> the goodness of fit is 9% , and the fit is conceptually simpler and much more portable . </S>",
    "<S> some of the residual error is probably due to small errors in positioning the t1 chamber .    </S>",
    "<S> we review the literature to see what other measurements and fits exist , and what monte carlo simulation has shown so far . </S>",
    "<S> all others use ( in varied notations ) the parametrization of pedroni et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> several have improved on his gaussian transverse distribution of the halo , but all retain his @xmath1 , the radial integral of the depth - dose , multiplying both core and halo terms and motivating measurements with large ` bragg peak chambers ' ( bpcs ) .    we argue that this use of @xmath1 , which by its definition includes energy deposited by nuclear secondaries , is incorrect . @xmath1 should be replaced in the core term , and in at least one part of the halo , by @xmath2 , a purely electromagnetic mass stopping power . </S>",
    "<S> it follows that bpc measurements are unnecessary , and irrelevant to parameterizing the pencil beam .    </S>",
    "<S> in clinical practice , comprehensive measurements and fits to the pencil beam are likely to be most important in the dosimetry of small fields involving relatively few pencils . for larger fields the already common ` field size factor </S>",
    "<S> ' approach should be adequate .    </S>",
