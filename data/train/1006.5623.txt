    "traditionally , the way to study singular pseudo - differential operators involves studying underlying manifolds with embedded boundaries or corners .",
    "these boundaries are always defined by the zero set of some functions ( known as the boundary defining functions @xmath2 ) , with non - vanishing differentials near the boundary . as a consequence ,",
    "a neighborhood of the boundary @xmath3 is of the form @xmath4 ( with the closed interval @xmath5 parameterized by @xmath2 ) .",
    "then , one would typically consider the calculus of pseudo - differential operators whose kernels have poly - homogeneous expansions in @xmath2 near the boundary ( see @xcite and the reference there ) .",
    "the use of groupoids for studying the geometry of manifolds with boundaries ( or corners ) was a much later development .",
    "early use of groupoids in pseudo - differential analysis include the convolution algebra defined on the holonomy groupoid of a regular foliation by connes et .",
    "( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the notion of pseudo - differential operators on a groupoid was developed by nistor , weinstein and xu @xcite .",
    "subsequently , monthubert @xcite showed that the @xmath6-calculus is , indeed , the vector representation of pseudo - differential operators on some groupoids .",
    "the theory is further formalized by ammann et .",
    "al . into so called lie manifolds , or manifolds with lie structure at infinity @xcite .",
    "despite the development of the groupoid theory , most , if not all analysis was done on examples very similar to the manifold with boundary case .    in this thesis ,",
    "we study the analysis of pseudo - differential operators in a systematic way parallel to that of singular pseudo - differential operators on manifolds with boundary ( i.e. @xcite etc . ) .",
    "our work is motivated by the study of the poisson ( co)-differential operator and its homology .",
    "these invariants are difficult to compute .",
    "the only attempt to develop any form of machinery seems to be @xcite , and the laplacian defined there is not elliptic in the usual sense .",
    "also it is clear that the singularities are not explicitly defined by any boundary defining function .",
    "moreover , even if the homology is computed directly , the result is often infinite dimensional , and therefore not very meaningful .",
    "for this reason , we consider renormalized index theory , which gives finite results .",
    "the approach in this thesis is based on the principle that all singular pseudo - differential operators are defined by vector representations of operators on the + groupoids .",
    "therefore instead of studying the calculus of singular pseudo - differential operators , one only needs to study non - singular pseudo - differential operators on the groupoid .",
    "the main part of this thesis , sections 2 - 5 , is an account of the technical details on how this principle is implemented , particularly to the example of the bruhat poisson structure on the sphere @xmath7 .    here",
    ", we shall give an overview of our approach .",
    "in section 2 , we collect together background material from several standard sources , which is needed for the thesis .",
    "we begin with reviewing the well known formalism of uniformly supported groupoid pseudo - differential operators by nistor et .",
    "al . @xcite .",
    "the uniformly supported calculus is comparable to the small calculus in manifolds with boundary .",
    "we shall also define the notion of a dirac operator on a groupoid .",
    "then we shall introduce some examples , most notably the symplectic groupoids of the bruhat poisson structure on flag manifolds , where the bruhat sphere is the simplest case .",
    "section 3 focuses on two questions , which are exact counterparts of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 5 ) :    1 .",
    "what ( elliptic ) pseudo - differential operator on a groupoid has fredholm vector representation ? 2 .",
    "what does the parametrix of a fredholm operator on a the groupoid defining the bruhat sphere look like ?",
    "lauter and nistor s @xcite theory gives a quick answer for ( 1 ) , namely , if an operator is invertible on all the singular leaves , then its vector representation is fredholm . in the simple case of the bruhat sphere , question ( 1 )",
    "therefore immediately reduces to checking the invertibility of the operator over the only singular leaf . due to some invariance properties ,",
    "the natural way to proceed is by fourier - laplace transform .",
    "we remark that our approach is again parallel to the indicial family formalism for manifolds with boundary ( recall that given a partial differential operator @xmath8 , the indicial family is defined to be the family of differential operators @xmath9 , see @xcite for detailed definitions ) .",
    "indeed , it can be said that fourier - laplace transform _ is the right _",
    "definition for indicial family .",
    "we then turn to describe the parametrix of fredholm operators on the bruhat sphere , using the fact that the inverse of a properly supported , invariant pseudo - differential operator is an invariant pseudo - differential operator with exponential decaying kernel .",
    "we then generalize the notion to groupoids with sub - exponential growth , and prove that the resulting calculus has a composition rule similar to that of calculus with bounds .    in section 4",
    ", we turn to the heat calculus of laplacian operators .",
    "the treatment here is very different from that of @xcite , and much simpler .",
    "that is not surprising because the source fibers are just non - singular manifolds with bounded geometry , and the heat kernel is essentially the leaf - wise heat kernel . therefore the classical construction suffices .",
    "perhaps the only unexpected result is the proof of transverse smoothness , which requires additional growth conditions on the differential of the product map .",
    "we shall leave the technical details to section 4.2 .    given a perturbed dirac operator that is fredholm ( one satisfying the conditions in section 3 ) , it is natural to seek an atiyah - singer type formula for its fredholm index .",
    "that is the theme of section 5 . again",
    "the technique we use is parallel to that of @xcite , and is fairly standard .",
    "we use the stereographic coordinates on the open leaf of the bruhat sphere to define a renormalized trace .",
    "the we derive the local index formula .",
    "we do have to fall back to the machinery of @xcite to describe the long time behavior of the heat kernel .",
    "however , it can be said that the ` cheating ' occurs already when we use the stereographic coordinates , which effectively serves as a boundary defining function .",
    "nevertheless , our result is stronger than that of @xcite in the sense that we are able to derive an explicit trace defect formula .",
    "we begin our technical discussion with the basic definition of a lie groupoid .",
    "our definition follows the convention of @xcite , but with the source and target maps denoted by @xmath10 and @xmath11 instead of @xmath12 and @xmath13 .    a _ lie groupoid _",
    "@xmath14 consists of :    1 .",

    "this extra assumption is clearly satisfied in all of the examples we shall shortly see .",
    "note that many important groupoids , like holonomy groupoids of foliations , are not hausdorff .",
