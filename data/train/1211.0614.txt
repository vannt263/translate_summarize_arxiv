    "the black hole accretion disk gamma - ray burst ( grb ) engine has become standard for long- and short - duration grbs alike  @xcite . for long - duration bursts , the most commonly - invoked progenitor is the collapse of a rapidly rotating massive star down to a black hole . but achieving the high angular momentum needed to produce a disk around the newly formed black hole has proved problematic and a number of progenitors have been invoked to provide these high angular momentum profiles  @xcite .",
    "one such model invokes the merger of a compact remnant with its companion .",
    "as the compact remnant spirals into the center of the helium core of an evolved companion , the accretion rate can exceed 0.01m@xmath0s@xmath1 , enough to power a strong gamma - ray burst  @xcite .",
    "the basic idea behind this model is that as the compact remnant spirals into its companion , the orbital energy lost both spins up the helium core and ejects the hydrogen envelope .",
    "if the compact remnant is a neutron star , the rapid accretion in the inspiral is likely to cause it to collapse to a black hole . in this manner",
    ", the helium merger model provides a natural way to ensure enough angular momentum to form a disk around a central black hole .",
    "simulations by zhang & fryer ( 2001 ) showed that the inspiral would produce both the high angular momenta and accretion rates needed to create a black hole accretion disk engine .",
    "although there is some concern that helium mergers produce disks with too much angular momentum  @xcite , current analyses find this angular momentum is appropriate for accretion disk engines@xcite .",
    "the helium - merger model predicts a feature that may be observable in the resultant explosion : the existence of a shell ( or torus ) of merger - ejecta surrounding the burst .",
    "initially , @xcite believed the helium merger model would be difficult to distinguish from normal grbs because the ejecta from the common envelope phase would lie along the orbital plane ( the same plane as the disk ) and there would be very little interaction between the ejecta and the grb jet .",
    "this picture changed with the observation of grb121225 , the so - called `` christmas burst''@xcite .",

    "but there is a trend that the most luminous explosions have the furthest shell distributions .",
    "if the compact object merges with a lower - mass helium core or a main - sequence star , the accretion rate onto the remnant will be much lower .",
    "for these systems , the black hole accretion disk engine is unlikely to be valid and it is more difficult to produce even a rough estimate of the explosion energy .    before the common envelope phase , many of our systems are likely to be x - ray binaries . at the onset of the common envelope phase ,",
    "the x - ray binary can evolve , becoming more powerful .",
    "the system may even begin to produce strong jets .",
    "these so - called , micro - quasars , have been observed in numerous systems ( see mirabel 2007 for a review ) .",
    "what happens as the compact remnant spirals into its companion is more difficult to determine . in these mergers ,",
    "the accretion rate is slow enough that the neutron star may not initially collapse to form a black hole .",
    "the accretion rate remains high enough that any neutron star magnetic field is likely to be buried . even without magnetic fields",
    ", these accretion events can produce explosions on par with normal supernova  @xcite .",
    "presumably , once the compact remnant collapses to a black hole , the accretion disk will produce a jet . in these hydrogen or low - mass helium cores ,",
    "the accretion rate is insufficient for the neutrino annihilation model to work , but we still do not understand the black hole accretion disk mechanism well enough to predict whether such systems will produce jets with explosions at grb levels or at sub - supernova levels .    .",

    "@xcite argued these mergers could fit a very peculiar subset of grbs with an unusual optical counterpart . but can helium mergers explain a broader set of grbs ? one of the key constraints of long - duration grb progenitors is the association of a particular subtype of supernova ( type ic ) with grbs .",
