    ", there are about 40 such unidentified tev sources on the galactic plane  @xcite .",
    "most of them are located within 1 degree from the galactic plane , and some are intrinsically extended .",

    "when we analyzed the hxd - pin data , we carefully examined the best energy range to maximize the signal - to - noise ratio . in order to minimize the contribution of non - x - ray background ( nxb ) , cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) and galactic ridge x - ray emission ( grxe ) , we selected 1223  kev for the analysis of the pin data .",

    "we then applied barycentric correction to the pin data using aebarycen  @xcite . using the efsearch ftool",
    ", we searched for pulsation at 128 trial periods between 0.07049490.0704987  sec and found a significant peak at 0.07049672(8 )  s with @xmath21 ( 9 degrees of freedom ) . here",

    "the chance probability to obtain such a large @xmath8 in 128 trial is only 0.01% .",
    "whereas hxd - pin is a non - imaging instrument , gis has an imaging capability and can extract the events from the source region . assuming that the pulsation originates from src 1 , we searched the gis data of src 1 for pulsation . although the nominal time resolution of gis in the ph mode is 62.5  ms in the high telemetry bit rate  @xcite",
    ", we can achieve higher time resolution up to 4  ms when the total count rate is low .",
    "the gis event data were output to the fixed format telemetry , whose relative location within a 62.5  ms slot was designed to indicate the finer timing information .",
    "the photon arrival time of gis in the asca archive is all assigned taking this finer timing information into account .",
    "because src 1 ( and other sources in the gis fov ) is dim ( 2.3  counts  s@xmath1 compared to the telemetry capacity of 128 counts  s@xmath1 ) , we can fully utilize the higher than the nominal time resolution of gis .",
    "the gis image of src 1 was elongated due to the proximity to the edge of the fov .",
    "thus we used an elliptical region of @xmath3 to extract the source events .",
    "we used only the high bit rate data in 1999 , and 224 photons in 210  kev ( including background ) was extracted in total .",
    "we applied barycentric correction using timeconv .",
    "we searched for pulsation at 128 trial periods between 0.07048380.0704865  sec and found a significant peak at 0.070485(2 )  sec with @xmath23 ( 9 degrees of freedom ) . the chance probability to obtain a @xmath8 larger than 38 is only 0.2% .",

    "we divided the pin data into two phases : on - peak ( phase 0.651.05 ) and off - peak ( phase 0.05 - 0.65 ) .",
    "we extracted the pulsed spectrum by subtracting the off - peak spectrum from the on - peak spectrum , and fitted it with a power - law model in the 1250  kev band .",

    "we have confirmed that the source of 70.5  ms pulsation , which was recently discovered by rxte , is indeed src 1 .",
    "the pulse profiles obtained by gis and hxd - pin are consistent with that of rxte .",
    "we show in figure  [ fig : time_period ] a long - term history of the pulse period .",
    "all the data are consistent with the stable spin - down with @xmath0  s  s@xmath1 ( 1@xmath22 error is indicated in parentheses ) , which is also consistent with the instantaneous spin - down rate determined by rxte for the interval of @xmath4 16 days  @xcite . the spectral parameters ( flux , photon index , column density ) of src 1 determined by the gis data were all consistent with those of xis . the flux and the column density were also consistent with those of chandra",
    "therefore , we conclude that src 1 is an intrinsically stable source .",
    "@xcite claimed that the chandra spectrum of the pulsar component was significantly harder ( @xmath29 ) than the pulsed component obtained by rxte in 220  kev ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "they suggested a steepening of the spectrum in the 815  kev band .",
    "the suzaku hxd - pin data indicate a photon index of @xmath31 for the pulsed component in the 1250  kev .",
    "this photon index is consistent with the rxte result and supports the steepening of the spectrum in the hard x - ray band .",
    "src 2 was also observed by asca and is known to have a non - thermal spectrum  @xcite .",
    "current suzaku observation suggests no time variation of src 2 since the asca observation .",
    "therefore we speculate that src 2 is also a pwn .",
    "however , chandra could detect neither the putative pulsar point source in src 2 nor any pulsation  @xcite .",
    "further observations are required to reveal the nature of this source .",
    "because src 1 is slightly offset from the center of hess j1837069 , we need to check the chance coincidence of the sources .",
    "the chance probability for high - power pulsars and vhe @xmath2-ray sources was estimated by @xcite .",
    "for src 1 with @xmath32  ergs  s@xmath1  kpc@xmath33 , the chance probability is @xmath34 .",
