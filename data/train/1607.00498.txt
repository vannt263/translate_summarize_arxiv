    "terrestrial hydrogen peroxide exists as a trace molecule in the earth s atmosphere and contributes to the atmospheres oxidising budget as well as ozone production and water chemistry @xcite and its concentration is now being routinely observed @xcite .",
    "astrophysically there have been multiple detections of h@xmath8o@xmath1  in the atmosphere of mars @xcite with seasonal variation , possibly formed by triboelectricity in dust devils and dust storms @xcite and may well act as an agent in the oxidization of the martian surface .",
    "hydrogen peroxide has also been detected in the atmosphere of europa @xcite in the 3.5@xmath9 region .",
    "the first detection of interstellar h@xmath8o@xmath1  was made by @xcite and is believed to play an important role in astrophysical water chemistry similar to that on earth .",
    "@xcite suggest that h@xmath8o@xmath1  is produced on dust - grains via the hydrogenation of grain ho@xmath8 and released into the gas - phase through surface reactions . on the dust - grain , h@xmath8o@xmath1  acts as an intermediate in the formation of water and aids in the production of other species such as h@xmath1co , ch@xmath10oh , and o@xmath1 .",
    "hydrogen peroxide belongs to the peroxide group of molecules with an ho - oh bond dissociation enthalpy of 17050 @xmath5@xcite at 0 k. h@xmath8o@xmath1  is an asymmetric prolate rotor molecule and is the simplest molecule that exhibits internal rotation .",
    "this torsional motion gives rise to a double minimum potential curve with respect to its internal rotation co - ordinates as well as two alignments of the o - h bonds : _ cis _ and _ trans_. the consequence of this motion means that there are four sub - levels for each torsional excitation which are characterized by their symmetry .",
    "this necessitates the use of an additional quantum number , @xmath11 , to unambiguously describe its motion .",
    "the molecular states can be classified using the @xmath12(m ) symmetry group which best describes the torsional splitting caused by the _",
    "cis _ and _ trans _ tunneling @xcite .",
    "h@xmath8o@xmath1  has six vibrational modes : @xmath13 and @xmath14 represent the symmetric and asymmetric o - h stretching respectively , @xmath15 and @xmath16 represent the o - h bending modes , @xmath17 represents the o - o stretch and the @xmath18 mode represents the torsional excitation with the more common notation of @xmath19 .    experimental studies of ro - vibrational h@xmath8o@xmath1  spectra have mostly probed the torsional motion in the ground @xcite , the @xmath15 @xcite and @xmath16 @xcite vibrational modes .",
    "conversely , the higher - lying o - h stretching modes , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , are poorly studied using high resolution techniques .",
    "the difference between the two stretching bands is about 8  10 cm^-1^  and torsional splitting from the double minimum of the potential gives rise to doubling @xcite in the form of quasi-degenerate states @xcite that are difficult to resolve with a degree of accuracy . @xcite",
    "give an estimate of 3610 - 3618  cm^-1^  for @xmath14 and 3601 - 3617  cm^-1^  for @xmath13 whilst a raman study gives a lower value of 3607  cm^-1^   for the  @xmath13   band - centre @xcite but determining the accuracy to better than 0.1  cm^-1^  is difficult .",
    "h@xmath8o@xmath1  has been a benchmark system for developing methods aiming to treat large amplitude motion @xcite .",
    "recent calculations on the ro - vibrational states for h@xmath8o@xmath1  include the _ ab initio _ computation using ccsd(t)-f12 electronic structure calculations of band frequencies accurate to about 4.0 cm^-1^  by @xcite , models of the peroxide stretches by @xcite , a discrete variable representation ( dvr ) calculation for levels up to 6000 cm^-1^  by @xcite and finally , a potential energy surface ( pes ) calculations by @xcite and @xcite . calculation which also consider transition intensities are rather rarer but a recent example is provided by @xcite .",
    "the peroxide system was used to benchmark the large amplitude calculations of multimode @xcite up to @xmath20 and showed good agreement against hitran line intensities but the pes used had an rms of @xmath21 20 cm^-1^  against experimental band centers .",
    "however , this pes has been superceded by the higher accuracy _ ab initio_potential energy surface ( pes ) of @xcite which was further modified by @xcite .",
    "this modified pes was used for our room - temperature line list @xcite and provides the starting point for the refinements performed here .",
    "experimental transitions frequencies and intensities for h@xmath8o@xmath1  are available in the hitran 2012 database @xcite but only for room temperature modelling up to 1800  @xmath5 .",
    "this region covers the torsional , o - h bending modes and o - o stretch but misses the o - h stretches in the 3750  @xmath5  region .",
    "only a few studies deal with absolute intensities of h@xmath8o@xmath1  in the far - infrared @xcite with only pnnl - ir @xcite data providing integrated intensities in the mid - infrared region @xcite .",
    "the thermal decomposition of hydrogen peroxide at 423 k makes it difficult and dangerous to study at higher temperatures .",
    "theoretical line lists can be used to fill in gaps in the experimental data both in terms of wavelength and temperature coverage .",
    "the exomol project @xcite aims to produce comprehensive theoretical molecular line lists to aid in studies of the atmospheres of exoplanets , cool stars and other ( hot ) bodies .",
    "a room temperature line list for h@xmath8o@xmath1  was previously computed by us @xcite using the pes of @xcite and a new _ ab initio _",
    "dipole moment surface ( dms ) .",
    "it provides about 1 billion transitions at up to 8,000  cm^-1^. however it is limited as the rotational excitation of @xmath22 makes it inadequate for high temperature modelling and the lower energy cut - off means that coverage above 4,000  cm^-1^rapidly becomes incomplete .",
    "this work aims to build upon this line list by refining the pes towards spectroscopic accuracy and extending the temperature and frequency range for which the resulting line list is applicable .",
    "our previous room - temperature h@xmath8o@xmath1  line list @xcite was computed using the _ ab initio _",
    "pes of @xcite with the small adjustment of the _ ab initio _  equilibrium geometry and height of the torsional barrier proposed by @xcite .",
    "this pes reproduces the known empirical energy levels with a root mean square ( rms ) of about 12 cm^-1^. however , by utilising empirical band - centre shifting @xcite during the computation of the hamiltonian , this was significantly reduced it to 0.001  0.1  cm^-1^  in the room temperature line list .",
    "the empirical shifting can be thought of as an addition to the _ ab initio _",
    "pes producing an ad - hoc pes which we will refer to as h2o2 - 2015 in comparisons below .",
    "whilst band - centre shifting can reproduce experimental energies simply , its accuracy and predictive ability is limited to vibrational bands whose band centre positions are already experimentally characterised . a more robust method of correcting the pes is through fitting or refining to experimental energies . the trove nuclear motion program used by us here , see below , provides pes refinement capabilities and has been successful in producing accurate pes for molecules such as h@xmath1co @xcite , nh@xmath10 @xcite , so@xmath10 @xcite , ph@xmath10 @xcite and ch@xmath23@xcite .    the procedure implemented in trove describes a correction surface @xmath24 to the initial ( _ ab initio _ ) surface @xmath25 .",
    "the new refined surface @xmath26 can therefore be written as @xmath27 and the new hamiltonian as @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the hamiltonian if the starting point for the refinement .",
    "the wavefunctions from @xmath29 , are used as basis - functions for @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath24 is expanded in taylor series and the expansion coefficients , @xmath31 , are obtained in a variational least - squares fit to spectroscopic data via the objective function @xmath32 : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the number of observed energies @xmath35 , @xmath36 are the calculated energies and @xmath37 are the weights .    here",
    "the original 282 expansion coefficients of the _ ab initio _",
    "pes are reduced to 163 by removing the symmetry - related o - h stretching ( @xmath38 ) and bending ( @xmath39 ) terms from the input pes and simply linking them in the computation of potential energy terms in the hamiltonian .",
    "this ensures that the symmetry of these terms is preserved during the fitting process .",
    "the quality of the fit is determined by the quality and vibrational diversity of the input dataset .",
    "two sources of experimental data come from line - positions provided in the literature and transitions from hitran .",
    "the hitran dataset sources come from observations by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite with literature line - positions from @xcite , @xcite @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this empirical dataset provides the @xmath18 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath17 vibrational terms .",
    "unfortunately there is little to no reliable data on the @xmath13 and @xmath14 energy levels , their reported band - centre values vary significantly in literature making them unsuitable for the refinement",
    ". this hampers the vibrational diversity that would aid in construction of an extensive fitted pes .",
    "however , these terms can be indirectly improved by including higher @xmath42 values from other vibrational states .",
    "our input dataset includes all energies for @xmath43 up to 4000  cm^-1^. the weights @xmath37 used have an arbitrary range of values that are normalized in the fit .",
    "the energies given in literature are the simplest to include in the refinement process and are given the highest weighting . here the pure torsional band at @xmath44 from @xcite and @xcite are given the highest weighting of @xmath45 .",
    "the @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 energies and h@xmath8o@xmath1  band centers ( except for @xmath51 and @xmath52 ) from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite are given weights @xmath53 .",
    "transitions from hitran require additional work . in order to determine",
    "the upper state of a transition requires the assignment of the lower state energy .",
    "fortunately hitran provides the lower state energy for all transitions in the database",
    ". however , lower state energies require corroboration from literature data and/or the _ ab initio _  energies for the upper state energies to be included in the fit with @xmath54 based on confidence of the datum . each input datum must be correlated with a theoretically computed energy level which , in this present work , was straightforward due to the good agreement given by the initial _ ab initio _  pes .",
    "special measures must be taken in order to ensure that the refinement process does not lead to unphysical shapes for the new pes due to a limited sampling of the experimental data not covering all the complexity of the potential energy surface of hooh .",
    "for example the high stretching or bending overtones are poorly represented in the experimental and therefore it is important to retain the _ ab initio _",
    "quality of the original pes by @xcite . to this end",
    "we constrain the pes around _ ab initio _",
    "energies at each geometry @xcite .",
    "the new potential energy surface is called h2o2 - 2016 .",
    "table [ tab : weights - rms ] describes the rms for states of a particular weight . the high quality of the h2o2 - 2016 energies computed without any empirical band shifts shows that this new semi - empirical pes performs better overall than the _ ab initio_band - shifted pes especially for the lower weighted states . weights @xmath5510 relate to vibrational states that were involved in the band - shifting which gives h2o2 - 2015 its low rms values .",
    "comparing weights lower than 10 suggests that the predictive ability of the h2o2 - 2016 pes is greatly enhanced . the overall comparison as a function of the rotational quantum number @xmath42 with a weighted rms",
    "is given in table [ tab : j - n - fit - rms ] .",

    "the figure shows how the opacity changes with increasing temperature .",
    "we note the particularly dramatic effect raising the temperature has on the absorption by h@xmath8o@xmath1 in the 13.7  @xmath7 m region .",
    "this smoothing in the overall spectra can only be modelled if there is adequate coverage and population of rotationally and vibrationally excited states .",
    "we also note the strength of the oh stretch feature at about 2.75 @xmath7 m ; these features are absent from line databases such as hitran because of the absence of assigned spectra in this region .",
    "hopefully apty can be used to help analyse spectra in this region , as the byte nh@xmath10 line list is being used to analyse ammonia spectra @xcite .",
    "the frequency and einstein-@xmath3 coefficients of almost 20 billion transitions of hydrogen peroxide are computed .",
    "these transitions cover wavelengths longer than 1.6 @xmath7 m and include all rotational excitations up to @xmath4 , making the line list applicable for temperatures up to 1250 k. the line list gives a room - temperature spectrum in excellent agreement with available experimental data and has good predictive ability for bands and line - positions not available experimentally .",
