    "the rare earth intermediate valence ( iv ) compounds@xcite are moderately heavy fermion compounds where the characteristic ( kondo ) energy is large compared to the crystal field splitting ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "unlike the truly heavy fermion ( hf ) compounds@xcite ( where @xmath7 ) the iv compounds do not reside close to a quantum critical point for a transition to antiferromagnetism , so non - fermi liquid behavior is neither expected nor observed and the scaling behavior that is observed does not reflect proximity to such a phase transition.@xcite furthermore most of the iv compounds are cubic , so that anisotropy and low - dimensionality are not issues .",
    "hence the iv compounds are physical realizations of the isotropic orbitally degenerate ( @xmath8 for yb ) anderson lattice model@xcite for three spatial dimensions .",
    "this is an archetypal problem that is both simple and elegant for exploring the physics of electronic correlations in solids .",
    "a key issue for the anderson lattice is the role of lattice coherence , which can be thought of as dispersive or band - like behavior of the 4@xmath2 electrons or alternatively as correlations between the 4@xmath2 electrons on different lattice sites .",
    "this contrasts the anderson lattice ( al ) with the anderson impurity model ( aim ) where no such coherence is present . for the hf and iv compounds",
    "the transport behavior , which depends crucially on the periodicity of the scattering potential , clearly manifests lattice coherence : the low temperature resistivity ( which is finite for the aim ) vanishes for the periodic compounds , as expected for a system obeying bloch s law;@xcite the de haas - van alphen signals are characteristic of renormalized @xmath2 bands;@xcite and the optical conductivity exhibits a drude response at low temperatures that also reflects renormalized masses .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , the dynamic susceptibility @xmath9 shows a lorentzian power spectrum with very little @xmath10-dependence,@xcite suggesting that the spin / valence fluctuations are very local and uncorrelated , as expected for the aim ; and thermodynamic properties that are dominated by the spin / valence fluctuations such as the temperature dependence of the susceptibility @xmath11 , specific heat @xmath12 and 4@xmath2 hole occupation number @xmath3 ( the yb valence is @xmath13 = 2+@xmath14 ) seem to follow the predictions of the aim , at least qualitatively.@xcite recent theory@xcite of the anderson lattice suggests , however , that there should be observable differences between the behavior of the al and the aim for these quantities",
    ". in particular , `` protracted screening '' can occur in the al , which means that the crossover from the low temperature fermi liquid state to the high temperature local moment state is slower for the lattice case than for the impurity case .",
    "protracted screening has been invoked@xcite to explain photoemission results@xcite which show far less temperature dependence than expected based on the aim .",
    "such results are controversial.@xcite  to search for such effects in the bulk thermodynamic behavior we herein compare our measurements@xcite of @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath15 for the series of related cubic ( c15b ) compounds yb@xmath4cu@xmath16 ( @xmath4 = ag , cd , in , mg , tl and zn ) to the predictions of the anderson impurity model , calculated within a single approximation scheme , the non - crossing approximation ( nca ) .  by making this comparison for several measurements for several related compounds , we put strong constraints on the applicability of the model .",
    "in addition , we include measurements of the dynamic susceptibility @xmath17 for @xmath4 = ag , mg , tl and zn ; these allow us to determine whether the deviations from aim behavior could arise from crystal field effects and also give a fourth experiment for comparison to the predictions of the model . finally , we include measurements of the x - ray absorption fine structure ( xafs ) from the @xmath4-atom @xmath18 edges for yb@xmath4cu@xmath16 and @xmath4 = ag , cd and in and the l@xmath19 edge for @xmath20 tl to determine whether deviations from aim behavior could arise from local lattice disorder in the samples .",

    "the experimental conditions were similar to those discussed in a recent study @xcite of ybincu@xmath16 ; we refer the reader to that publication for a more detailed account .",
    "the temperature of the measurement was 10k , which is considerably smaller than @xmath24 in each case .",
    "the samples utilized in these experiments were powders , typically of 50 g mass , grown from the melt inside evacuated tantalum tubes for @xmath4 = ag , mg and zn ; for @xmath4  =  in and tl , a large number of single crystals grown as described in sarrao _",

    "given that the elastic energy resolution ( fwhm ) varies as @xmath26 @xmath27 0.07 - 0.1 _ e_@xmath28 , we used several incident neutron energies @xmath29 ( e.g. 35 , 80 and 150mev ) to give greater dynamic range in energy transfer @xmath30 for the measurement . to improve statistics we took advantage of the lack of @xmath10-dependence of the magnetic scattering@xcite and grouped detectors into three bins , with average scattering angle 20@xmath31 ( low _ q _ ) , 60@xmath31 and 100@xmath32 ( high _ q _ ) .",
    "the scattering was put on an absolute scale by comparison to the measured scattering of a vanadium sample .",
    "we also measured the scattering of yagcu@xmath16 , lumgcu@xmath16 , ymgcu@xmath16 , ytlcu@xmath33 and luzncu@xmath16 in order to help determine the nonmagnetic scattering .",
    "the xafs experiments were performed on beam line 4 - 3 at the stanford synchrotron radiation laboratory ( ssrl ) using a half - tuned si(220 ) double - crystal monochromator .",
    "samples were ground , passed through a 30 @xmath34 m sieve and brushed onto scotch tape .",
    "pieces of tape were stacked such that the change in the absorption at the yb @xmath35 edge was @xmath36 unity .",

    "the predictions of the anderson impurity model were calculated in the non - crossing approximation  ( nca).@xcite  this approximation allows for calculation of all relevant experimental quantities , both static ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath21 ) and dynamic ( @xmath39 ) , for realistic orbital degeneracy and for realistic spin - orbit and crystal - field splitting .",
    "it agrees well@xcite over a broad temperature range with calculations using the bethe ansatz , but does produce spurious and unphysical non - fermi liquid artifacts in the low  frequency density of states and in the dynamic susceptibility at very low temperatures.@xcite these artifacts are not significant for the temperatures and frequencies studied here .",
    "the conduction band was assumed to have a gaussian density of states of width @xmath40 and centered at the fermi energy , i.e. @xmath41 .  the hybridization matrix elements were assumed to be @xmath42-independent , i.e. @xmath43 , which may be a good approximation if the thermodynamic and magnetic properties are predominately determined by the conduction band states within @xmath44 of the fermi energy .",
    "the finite temperature nca self - consistency equations @xcite were solved using three overlapping linear meshes .  the thermodynamic and spectroscopic results for ce impurities with spin - orbit splitting and in various crystal fields were compared with those published in bickers _",
    "et al_@xcite and good agreement was found despite the difference in procedure and the different choice of conduction band density of states .    for yb iv compounds where",
    "crystal fields can be ignored the magnetic orbital degeneracy is @xmath45 8 and there are essentially four input parameters for the aim calculation :  the spin - orbit splitting ( which we fixed at @xmath46 1.3ev , the value typically observed in photoemission experiments@xcite ) , the width @xmath40 of the gaussian conduction band , the hybridization constant @xmath47 and the @xmath2-level energy ( relative the fermi level ) @xmath48 . since it is only the conduction states within @xmath49 of the fermi level that contribute significantly to the experimental quantities discussed here , the bandwidth parameter @xmath40 must be chosen to give the correct value of @xmath50 for the background conduction band . assuming the background bandstates in yb@xmath4cu@xmath16 are similar to those in lu@xmath4cu@xmath16 , we choose @xmath40 to reproduce the linear specific heat coefficient @xmath51lu@xmath52 of the corresponding lu@xmath4cu@xmath16 compounds,@xcite using the free electron approximation to convert the measured value of @xmath51lu@xmath52 to @xmath50 .",
    "this is an important constraint since ( as we found in the earlier paper@xcite ) it is possible to force fits to @xmath3 over the whole temperature range if unrealistically small values of the bandwidth are used in the model . in yb@xmath4cu@xmath16 compounds ,",
    "the valence bands have a width of order 10  ev;@xcite since the 2@xmath53 full - width of the gaussian band is @xmath54 , the values of @xmath40 ( @xmath55 , see table [ table1 ] ) obtained from @xmath51lu@xmath52 are quite reasonable .",
    "once @xmath56 and @xmath40 are fixed , @xmath47 and @xmath48 can be uniquely determined by fitting to the ground state values of the susceptibility and occupation number .",
    "the values of these parameters are given in table [ table1 ] ; the kondo temperature is calculated from the formula @xmath57 which includes the effect of spin orbit splitting but ignores crystal field splitting .",
    "for these values of input parameters , we calculated the frequency dependence of the dynamic susceptibility at 10k and the temperature dependence of the static susceptibility , the 4f occupation number and the free energy .  from the latter we determined the linear coefficient of specific heat by fitting to the formula @xmath58 in the temperature range @xmath59 ; the values of @xmath60 so determined have a systematic error of order 5 - 10% .",
    "the primary goal of the neutron scattering measurements was to determine whether crystal field excitations can be resolved in these compounds .",
    "determination of the magnetic scattering in polycrystals of iv compounds requires correct subtraction of the nonmagnetic scattering .",
    "we have adopted a variant on the conventional procedure@xcite for accomplishing this where the y@xmath4cu@xmath16 ( and/or lu@xmath4cu@xmath16 ) nonmagnetic counterpart to the corresponding yb@xmath4cu@xmath16 sample is measured to determine the factor @xmath61 = @xmath62(high @xmath10 ; @xmath30;y)/@xmath62(low @xmath10 ; @xmath63y ) by which the high-@xmath10 scattering ( which is almost totally nonmagnetic scattering ) scales to the low @xmath10 values where the magnetic scattering is strongest .",
    "this factor varies smoothly from a value  @xmath274 - 5 , at @xmath64 to a value of 1 at large @xmath30 where @xmath10-independent multiple scattering dominates the nonmagnetic scattering .",
    "( when this decrease in @xmath61 is neglected the nonmagnetic scattering will be underestimated at large energy transfer . )  in addition we have included an energy - independent multiplicative factor @xmath65 which is needed to account for the fact that the multiple scattering , which dominates the low-@xmath66 nonmagnetic scattering , has different strengths for yb than for y or lu .",
    "( when this factor is neglected the magnetic scattering is overestimated . )",

    "the fits to the experimental data include corrections for absorption and for instrumental resolution .  the data for every @xmath75 is included in the fit .",
    "we then find the value of @xmath65 that gives the smallest reduced @xmath76 for the fit .",
    "the best - fit values of @xmath65 were consistently in the range 0.65 - 0.75 ; furthermore , the best - fit values of @xmath65 gave better agreement ( 10 - 20% ) between the fit value of @xmath77 and the value shown in fig .",

    "the parameters @xmath73 and @xmath74 for the best fits are given in table 1 , where they are compared to the values predicted by the aim calculation .",
    "we note that our results agree well with an earlier measurement of ybagcu@xmath16.@xcite although the fits are of reasonable statistical quality with reduced @xmath82 , the degree of systematic uncertainty due to the assumptions made about the nonmagnetic scattering is unknown .",
    "the problem is especially serious for iv compounds where @xmath24 is large so that large incident energies are required , with the result that multiple scattering is large .  to be cautious",
    ", we expect a 10% error in the determination of @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "the primary goal of the xafs measurements was to determine whether @xmath4/cu site interchange is significant in these compounds .",
    "such disorder is a real possiblity given that ybcu@xmath83 can grow in the c15b structure,@xcite and given that updcu@xmath16 , which also grows in the c15b struucture , has been shown to have significant pd / cu site interchange.@xcite our earlier neutron diffraction measurements@xcite of flux - grown crystals of ybincu@xmath16 , coupled with rietveld refinement , suggest the average crystal structure is very well ordered .",
    "we employ the xafs technique here both because the measurement does not depend on lattice periodicity ( i.e. it is a local probe and is thus complimentary to diffraction ) and because it is atomic - species specific . in such a measurement",
    ", a fine - structure function @xmath84 is extracted from the absorption data and related to the radial bond length distribution around the absorbing @xmath4 atomic species .",
    "this measurement is particularly sensitive to @xmath4/cu site interchange because if any @xmath4 atoms rest on the cu sites , a short @xmath4-cu bond length at about 2.55   will appear that corresponds to the cu - cu nearest neighbor bond length in the nominal structure .",
    "this bond length is significantly shorter than the nearest neighbor @xmath4-cu pairs at @xmath27 2.93   or the @xmath4-yb pairs at @xmath27 3.06  , and so is easy to resolve if the site interchange is frequent .",
    "in addition to searching for @xmath4/cu site interchange , we also look for more generic disorder in the nominal @xmath4-cu and @xmath4-yb pairs by analyzing the distribution widths extracted from the @xmath85-space fits as a function of temperature between 15 - 300  k. bond length distribution widths should follow a correlated - debye model@xcite as a function of temperature if the structure does not have any static ( positional ) disorder .",
    "this model differs from the usual debye model because it includes the correlations in the motions between the atoms in a given pair .",
    "it has been shown to be accurate to within @xmath275% for metals.@xcite any static disorder should manifest as a constant offset , as is clearly shown , for example , for la@xmath86ca@xmath87mno@xmath88.@xcite    the xafs data were fit in @xmath85-space , following procedures in ref .",
    "initial fits included a short @xmath4-cu pair at @xmath892.55  .",
    "the relative amplitude of this peak compared to the amplitude of the nominal @xmath4-cu at @xmath272.93   gives the percentage of @xmath90 atoms on cu sites .",
    "errors in this measurement were determined by assuming that the fitted statistical @xmath76 was equal to the degrees of freedom in the fit as given by stern@xcite and then increasing the amount of site interchange until @xmath76 increased by one , while allowing all the other parameters in the fit to vary .",
    "these results are presented in table [ xafs_table ] . for @xmath20 in , cd and ag",
    "the site interchange has the same value as the error , and hence the results are consistent with the zero site interchange .  for ybtlcu@xmath16 the error is smaller than the site interchange but it is also smaller than the error in the other cases .",
    "furthermore , the fitted tl - cu bond length was very low ( 2.40  ) even though tl has the largest atomic radius of all the @xmath4 s measured .",
    "we note that sytematic errors in the fit can arise from use of an incorrect theoretic backscattering amplitude @xcite .  given all this ,",
    "we think that the error is underestimated for ybtlcu@xmath16 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that , within @xmath273% , none of the materials measured have any @xmath4/cu site interchange .",
    "once the lack of site interchange was determined , we fit the data assuming no site interchange and determined the pair distribution widths to search for any other disorder .",
    "examples of two of these fits are shown in fig .",
    "[ xafs_fig ] .",
    "the bond lengths of the nominal @xmath4-cu and @xmath4-yb pairs do not deviate from the average c15b structure assuming lattice parameters from ref . by more than 0.02  .",

    "[ nf_fig ] and [ chi_fig ] where they are compared to the experimental behavior.@xcite the most noteable feature is that for @xmath4 = cd , mg and zn , the experimentally determined occupation number @xmath3 and the effective moment @xmath92 ( where @xmath93 is the @xmath94 = 7/2 curie constant ) rise towards the high temperature limit more slowly than predicted by the impurity theory . the effect is somewhat weaker but still apparent for @xmath4 = ag . for @xmath4 = tl the experimental occupation number shows a weak retardation compared to theory but the experimental susceptibility tracks the impurity theory up to room temperature .",
    "the linear coefficients of specific heat determined from our calculation are given in table 1 where they are compared to the experimental values ; the experimental and calculated values of the wilson ratio @xmath95 are also compared in the table .",
    "figures [ nf_fig ] and [ chi_fig ] give our basic result : the crossover from the ground state fermi liquid to the high temperature local moment state is slower for the real materials than predicted by the anderson impurity model .",
    "there are several reasons why this comparison to theory might be incorrect .",
    "the first is that crystal fields may be large in these compounds .",
    "crystal fields can cause the ground state multiplet to have a lower degeneracy than the value @xmath96 expected for @xmath97 .",
    "since the aim results depend on @xmath98 this could lead to a discrepancy between theory and experiment if @xmath98 were incorrectly assigned in the calculation .  indeed , in the earlier paper@xcite we found that for some cases we could fit the data assuming a lower degeneracy , e.g. @xmath99 for ybmgcu@xmath16 .",
    "our inelastic magnetic neutron scattering experiments were designed to test for this possibility .  as mentioned above",
    ", there is a systematic error of order 10 - 20% in the determination of the peak position and width of the magnetic scattering .  for our present purposes ,",
    "however , the basic point is that the data can be well - fit by a single broadened lorentzian whose peak energy @xmath100 is in reasonable accord with the predicted value ( i.e. it is of order @xmath24 ) ; there are no sharp crystal field levels in evidence .",
    "this also is in accord with the fact that the crystal fields seen in trivalent compounds such as ybinni@xmath16@xcite or ybaucu@xmath16@xcite are of order 2 - 4mev which is significantly smaller than @xmath24 for most of these compounds .",
    "a second potential problem for our analysis is that if yb atoms are in a disordered environment , there can be a distribution of kondo temperatures . in this case",
    ", the measured susceptibility involves an integral over this distribution of kondo temperatures , which would spread the crossover over a broader range of temperature.@xcite  this effect may be relevant in updcu@xmath16 , where there is significant ( @xmath101 ) pd / cu site exchange.@xcite  our xafs results for the yb@xmath4cu@xmath16 compounds  show that within @xmath1023% there is no @xmath4/cu site interchange ; furthermore , the observed values of the static disorder @xmath103 are typical of values seen in well - ordered compounds",
    ". basically , the xafs results are consistent with a very high degree of order for the flux - grown crystals .",
    "we thus believe that kondo disorder is not a significant factor for these compounds .",
    "( a possible exception is ybzncu@xmath16 for which we could not analyse the zn @xmath18-edge xafs because it is superimposed on the cu @xmath18-edge xafs . given the chemical similarity of zn and cu , zn / cu site disorder seems a real possibility . )",
    "a third problem for this analysis concerns the interpretation of the yb @xmath104 x - ray absorption used to determine the occupation number n@xmath105(t ) .",
    "the analysis@xcite relies on rather simple assumptions : the divalent and trivalent absorption edges are assumed to have the same shape and the same absorption matrix element , so that n@xmath105 is determined from the fractional weights of the two features .",
    "similar assumptions are made for other methods ( xps core levels ; valence band ups ; mossbauer isomer shift ) for determining valence .  while the resulting systematic error is not well - understood , it has been argued@xcite that the @xmath23 method is superior to use of isomer shift or lattice constant anomalies for the determination of valence .",
    "it has been pointed out@xcite that the values of @xmath14 estimated from the @xmath23 experiments are consistently and significantly larger than those estimated from valence band photoemission .",
    "the latter estimate also requires the assumption of equal absorption matirix elements for the di- and tri - valent configurations and is extremely sensitive to choice of background .",
    "a point in favor of the use of x - ray absorption is that , unlike photoemission it truly samples the bulk of the compound ; indeed it has been argued@xcite that near - surface reconstruction gives rise to differences between the @xmath23 and ups estimates of @xmath14 .  whether this is so and what the sytematic errors are in both measurements are , in our opinion , topics for future research .  in any case , the deviations from the aim that we observe for @xmath3 using the @xmath23 measurement ( fig . 1 )",
    "are qualitatively very similar  to those observed for the effective moment ( fig .",
    "2 ) , the measurement of which is not subject to significant systematic error .",
    "( in our earlier paper@xcite we showed that at room temperature for all cases except @xmath20 ag , @xmath14 is nearly equal to the effective moment . )",
    "the photoemission analysis yields an extremely slow crossover , to the extent that the hole occupancy is found to be @xmath106 in the high temperature state of ybincu@xmath16 which is much smaller than the value ( @xmath107 ) that we have observed@xcite using @xmath23 .",
    "the latter value is , in our opinion , more realistic given the essentially trivalent behavior of the susceptibility of ybincu@xmath16 at high temperature .",
    "we therefore argue that we have ruled out most of the major sources of error in our analysis , so that we can have a reasonable degree of confidence that the slow crossover is a real effect .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , recent theory@xcite for the ( @xmath62 = 1/2 ) anderson lattice , treated in the 1/@xmath108 approximation ( where @xmath108 is the spatial dimension of the system ) predicts such a slow crossover , referring to it as  protracted screening  .",
    "the degree of slowness is sensitive to the filling of the background conduction band ; the crossover is slowest for partial filling of the background band . at present",
    "it is unclear the extent to which the effect depends on the orbital degeneracy .",
    "the deviations of the data ( figs .",
    "1 and 2 ) for yb@xmath4cu@xmath16 from the predictions of the aim are strongest for @xmath20 mg , zn and cd , weaker for @xmath20 ag and weakest for @xmath20 tl .",
    "we note that there is no correlation between this trend and the magnitude of the kondo temperature ( table 1 ) nor of the ground state occupation number ( fig .",
    "there _ does _ appear to be a correlation with the magnitude of the hall coefficient for lu@xmath4cu@xmath16 :  @xmath109 and @xmath110 for @xmath20 mg , zn , cd;@xcite @xmath111 for @xmath20 ag;@xcite and @xmath112 for @xmath20 tl.@xcite  this quantity can be taken as a measure of the conduction electron density in the background band .  in a one - band model , where @xmath113 and where there are 24 atoms in a unit cell of side 7.1  these values of @xmath114 correspond to the values 0.52 , 0.93 , 1.16 and 1.55 electrons per atom for the sequence @xmath115 mg , zn , cd , ag@xmath116 .",
    "while the one - band assumption is unrealistic , nevertheless these results suggest that the deviations from the aim become weaker as the carrier density becomes larger .",
    "this accords with theory@xcite which predicts no deviation for half filling of the background band and increasing deviation as the conduction electron density decreases .     we should point out that a slow crossover is expected on rather general grounds .  in the single impurity calculations",
    "the position of the chemical potential @xmath117 is set by the host metal conduction band density of states , and the chemical potential is independent of temperature to order @xmath118 . in the hypothetical case of a periodic array of impurities that are noninteracting and incoherent the appreciable @xmath2-weight and",
    "its asymmetric temperature dependence will lead to a significant temperature dependence of @xmath119 and hence lead to a deviation of @xmath3 from the behavior found in the solution to the single impurity model .",
    "it is not clear to us the extent to which this effect contributes to the predicted protracted screening .",
    "in addition to our main conclusion , we would like to point to two more features of the analysis .",
    "the first is that the experimentally determined linear coefficients @xmath120 of specific heat for @xmath4 = mg , cd , ag and zn are 20 - 30% larger than the values predicted by the aim .",
    "this means that the experimental value of the wilson ratio @xmath121 is smaller than predicted by the aim .",
    "this has been noticed before.@xcite for ybincu@xmath16 there is excellent agreement between the experimental and calculated values ; for ybtlcu@xmath16 the calculated value of @xmath120  is 30% _ smaller _ than the experimental value .",
    "the second feature is that there is considerable disagreement between the measured and predicted values of the neutron lineshape parameters @xmath73 and @xmath74 given in table 1 .",
    "we remind the reader that the degree of systematic error for this determination is poorly understood , due to the difficulty of determining the nonmagnetic scattering for large @xmath24 compounds . in addition , all @xmath122 dependence of the lineshape in polycrystals is automatically averaged out . in the case of ybincu@xmath16 , we have confidence in the results , since an alternate means of subtracting the nonmagnetic scattering@xcite agrees with the method used here and since a neutron scattering study of a single crystal@xcite showed that the @xmath122-dependence of the lineshape is quite small . for that case",
    "we note that the experimental peak energy @xmath73 agrees well with the prediction of the aim but the measured linewidth @xmath74 is a factor of two smaller than predicted , as though the spin fluctations have a longer lifetime than predicted by the aim . on the other hand for ybmgcu@xmath16 , ybtlcu@xmath16 and ybzncu@xmath16 the experimental values of peak energy differ significantly from the calculated values and the linewidths are _ larger _ than the predicted values .",
    "such a large linewidth could be a consequence of a @xmath10-dependence of the peak parameter @xmath73(@xmath10 ) ; studies of single crystals are necessary to establish whether such a @xmath10-dependence is present .",
    "finally we note that if the lineshape parameters for ybagcu@xmath16 are increased by 10% to account for the 10% smaller value of @xmath25 observed for the neutron sample , they are in excellent agreement with the aim predictions .    in conclusion , we have given evidence that the crossover from low temperature fermi liquid behavior to high temperature local moment behavior is slower for periodic intermediate valence compounds than predicted by the anderson impurity model .",
    "we have included supporting experiments to rule out the possibility that the disagreements between the data and the aim predictions are due to large crystal fields or to kondo disorder .",
    "we feel that the results are fairly robust",
    ".  it will be interesting to see whether similar  protracted screening  is observed in other compounds , especially in those based on ce where the orbital degeneracy is smaller ( @xmath123 ) and where the size of the 4@xmath2 orbital is considerably larger .",
