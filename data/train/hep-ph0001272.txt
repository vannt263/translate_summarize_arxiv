    "recently a rather successful program of computing the quark distribution functions in the framework of the effective quark - soliton model was developed @xcite .",
    "the quark soliton model @xcite includes the chiral pion field @xmath2 and the quark field @xmath3 whose interaction is described by the lagrangian @xmath4 in the mean field approximation ( justified in the limit of the large number of quark colors @xmath5 @xcite ) the nucleon arises as a soliton of the chiral field @xmath6 @xmath7,\\quad n^{a}=\\frac{x^{a}}{r},\\quad r=|x| \\ , . \\label{hedgehog}\\ ] ]    this effective theory allows a quantum field - theoretical approach to the calculation of the quark and antiquark distributions in the nucleon .",
    "in contrast to naive quark composite models and to the bag model here we have a consistent approach reproducing the main features of the qcd parton model like positivity of the quark and antiquark distributions , various sum rules etc .    in terms of the quark degrees of freedom",
    "this picture of the nucleon corresponds to occupying with @xmath8 quarks the negative continuum levels as well as the valence level of the one - particle dirac hamiltonian @xmath9@xmath10 in the background soliton field @xmath6 .",
    "for the pion field ( [ hedgehog ] ) one can find the spectrum of the hamiltonian ( [ h - dirac ] ) @xmath11    various nucleon observables can be naturally represented as sums over eigenstates @xmath12 of the dirac hamiltonian @xmath9 . for example , the nucleon mass @xmath13 is given by the sum over all occupied states or alternatively by the minus sum over all non - occupied states @xmath14 in this expression the subtraction of similar sums is implied where the eigenstates @xmath15 and the eigenvalues @xmath16 are replaced by those of the free hamiltonian , @xmath17    the physical reason for the existence of the two equivalent expressions in ( [ m - n - sum ] ) is that the polarized dirac sea picture can be formulated either in terms of quark or in terms of antiquark states ( occupied antiquark states correspond to non - occupied quark states ) .",
    "formally the equivalence of two representations ( [ m - n - sum ] ) for @xmath13 follows from the identity @xmath18 at the last step we took into account that the trace of @xmath9 over the spin indices vanishes . strictly speaking , this naive argument is not safe since the sums ( [ m - n - sum ] ) over the occupied and non - occupied states are ultraviolet divergent and must be regularized . in principle , the ultraviolet regularization could lead to an anomalous difference between the summation over occupied and non - occupied states but in the case of the nucleon mass ( [ m - n - sum ] ) one can check that in the regularizations like pauli - villars or proper - time ones the anomaly is absent .",
    "e.g. the proper - time regularized version of ( [ trace - zero ] ) with the ultraviolet cutoff @xmath19 is @xmath20 = 0 \\ , .\\ ] ]    we can reformulate this verbally as the `` absence of the anomaly '' in the nucleon mass @xmath13 ( in the proper time regularization ) . the usage of the word `` anomaly '' is invoked by the similarity with the axial anomaly which can be interpreted as nonvanishing trace of @xmath21 in e.g. the proper - time regularization .    the main object of interest in this paper is the study of the quark distribution functions . in the mean field approach ( justified in the large @xmath22 limit )",
    "the quark distributions can be represented as single or double sums over occupied or non - occupied one - particle eigenstates ( [ eigens ] ) of the dirac hamiltonian ( [ h - dirac ] ) .",
    "we shall see that for the same parton distribution one can write two naively equivalent representations but whether this equivalence persists or not when one takes into account the ultraviolet regularization is a rather subtle question and the situation is different for different distributions .",
    "moreover , even in the limit of the large cutoff , the cancellation of this anomalous difference between the naively equivalent representations is sensitive to the regularization used .",
    "let us start from the unpolarized isosinglet quark distribution @xmath23 which is given by the following expressions ( @xcite ) in the leading order of the @xmath24 expansion @xmath25 @xmath26 also here the subtraction of similar sums with the eigenstates and eingenvalues of the hamiltonian ( [ h - dirac ] ) replaced by those of the free hamiltonian ( [ freeham ] ) is implied .",
    "the result ( [ u - plus - d ] ) has a transparent physical meaning of the probability to find a quark with momentum fraction @xmath27 in the nucleon in the infinite momentum frame . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that in the pauli - villars regularization the sums over occupied and non - occupied states in ( [ u - plus - d ] ) really give the same result .",
    "we stress that the fact of the equivalence of the two representations for parton distributions is crucial for the positivity of unpolarized distributions and for the validity of various sum rules inherited by the model from qcd @xcite .",
    "therefore the check of this equivalence is an essential part of the calculation of parton distributions in the chiral soliton model .",
    "now let us turn to the polarized quark distributions . in the leading order of the @xmath28 expansion only the isovector polarized",
    "distribution survives @xmath29 @xmath30 compared to the expression ( [ u - plus - d ] ) for @xmath23 here we have an extra factor @xmath31 which reflects the fact that now we deal with the isovector polarized distribution .",
    "the factor of @xmath32 comes from a careful treatment of the rotation of the soliton @xcite .",
    "one can ask whether the summation over the occupied quark states in ( [ du - minus - dd - occ ] ) can be replaced by the summation over non - occupied states @xmath33 @xmath34 in this paper we shall show that in the case of the pauli - villars regularization ( the sum over states @xmath35 in ( [ du - minus - dd - occ ] ) is logarithmically divergent ) the two representations ( [ du - minus - dd - occ ] ) and ( [ du - minus - dd - non - occ ] ) are really equivalent .    we stress that the equivalence of the summation over the occupied and non - occupied states is very sensitive to the choice of the regularization . for example , if instead of the pauli  villars regularization we simply cut the summation over quark states in ( [ du - minus - dd - occ ] ) including only states with @xmath36 then a nonzero difference between the two representations ( [ du - minus - dd - occ ] ) and ( [ du - minus - dd - non - occ ] ) will remain even in the limit of the infinite cutoff @xmath37 .",
    "the mechanism how this anomalous difference appears is similar in many respects to the famous axial anomaly . in particular ,",
    "such similarity manifests itself in the fact that the anomalous difference between the two representations ( [ du - minus - dd - occ ] ) and ( [ du - minus - dd - non - occ ] ) can be computed analytically in the limit @xmath38 .",
    "the calculation of the anomalous difference is presented in this paper .",
    "although the regularization including only states with @xmath36 is not acceptable as a physical one and the pauli  villars regularization is more preferable in this respect , we want to emphasize that in the practical calculations based on the numerical diagonalization of the dirac operator in the background soliton field , the @xmath36 regularization appears naturally . indeed ,",
    "in the numerical calculation one can work only with a finite amount of quark states so that one actually uses both pauli - villars subtraction ( with the regulator mass @xmath39 ) and the @xmath40 .",
    "the numerical calculation is rather involved and the analytical result for the anomaly in the @xmath41 which gets the first nonzero contribution only in the subleading order of the @xmath24 expansion @xmath42 @xmath43 @xmath44 here @xmath45 is the quark momentum projection on the third axis @xmath46 and @xmath47 is the moment of inertia of the soliton @xcite .",

    "villars subtraction was presented in paper @xcite . unfortunately there",
    "the question about the equivalence of the two representation ( [ du - plus - dd - occ ] ) and ( [ du - plus - dd - non - occ ] ) was not investigated properly .",
    "also the pauli - villars subtraction was used in paper @xcite without proper justification .    in this paper",
    "we show that if one cuts the sum over occupied ( non - occupied ) states @xmath35 allowing only @xmath51 in the eqs .",

    "this mistake was corrected by the authors of @xcite . the revised version of calculation of wakamatsu et al .",
    "was published in @xcite . in this paper",
    "the question about the anomalous difference @xmath172 _ { occ}^{\\omega _ { 0}}-\\left [ \\delta u(x)+\\delta d(x)\\right ] _ { non - occ}^{\\omega _ { 0}}$ ] was investigated only numerically but the accuracy of the calculation did not allow the authors to draw any conclusions concerning whether this difference vanishes or not .",
    "actually the numerical accuracy of the agreement between the two representations which we observe in our calculation ( see fig . [ isosinglet - polarized - anomaly ] ) , and which is necessary for a proper evaluation of the parton distributions , is of two orders magnitude better than the same difference presented in @xcite .",
    "the practical solution accepted in @xcite was to use @xmath172 _ { occ}^{\\omega _ { 0 } } $ ] for @xmath173 and @xmath172 _ { non - occ}^{\\omega _ { 0}}$ ] for @xmath174 ( i.e. for the antiquark distribution ) .",
    "as it was explained above , @xmath53 should not be regularized contrary to what the authors of @xcite do .",
    "the polarized structure functions were also estimated in the work @xcite in the nambu  jona - lasinio model within the valence approximation . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that the valence approximation leads to a number of inconsistencies : antiquark distributions are negative , sum rules are violated , etc .",
    "our work has been performed within the quark - soliton model with two quark flavors . in the case of the model in the flavor @xmath175 the same quantity should be interpreted as @xmath176 .",
    "the first moment of the @xmath53 gives the singlet axial charge .",
    "our result of @xmath177 agrees with the calculation performed in other works @xcite .",
    "note that in the calculation of this charge no ultraviolet regularization was used .",
    "we have proved that the representation of singlet polarized ( anti)quark distributions in the chiral quark - soliton model as a sum over quark orbitals is ultraviolet finite and free of quantum anomalies .",
    "this is a serious check of the consistency of the quark - soliton model .",
    "in fact , the cancellation of quantum anomalies in the model is related to the fact that certain basic properties of qcd as a local quantum field theory are realized in the model .",
    "the equivalence of the summation over occupied and non - occupied states is directly connected to anticommutativity of fermion fields at space - like intervals .",
    "actually this locality property has direct relation to the positivity of quark and antiquark densities in the quark soliton model @xcite .",
    "another consequence of the cancellation of anomalies is that the model results for the parton distributions are compatible with the charge conjugation invariance : the quark distributions in nucleon coincides with the antiquark distributions in the antinucleon .    from the practical point of view the results presented in this paper",
    "allow us to conclude that for the calculation of the singlet polarized quark and antiquark distributions no pauli - villars subtraction is needed .",
    "additionally the numerical check of the cancellation of the anomalies is a powerful tool to control the accuracy of the numerics .",
    "we have computed the singlet polarized quark and antiquark distributions which arise in the subleading order of @xmath28 expansion .",
    "we found the quark distribution @xmath158 to be in a reasonable agreement with grsv @xcite parametrization of parton distributions at low normalization point .",
    "a remarkable prediction of our model is that the polarized distributions of @xmath178 and @xmath179 antiquarks are essentially different , see fig.4 .",
    "usually , in parametrizations of polarized parton distributions , it was assumed that @xmath180 , which is not confirmed by our model calculations ( see fig .",
    "it would be extremely interesting to include into the fits of the data the flavour decomposition pattern for polarized antiquarks obtained in our model calculations .",
    "future experiments at hera and rhic investigating drell - yan lepton pair production in polarized nucleon - nucleon collisions will clarify the situation . for a discussion see @xcite .",
    "let us note that in the singlet polarized channel under the evolution the quark distributions mix with polarized gluon distribution .",
    "analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite in the framework of the instanton model of the qcd vacuum shows that the gluon distribution is parametrically smaller ( suppressed by @xmath181 ) than quark and antiquark distributions . in order to obtain a non - zero result one has to go beyond the zero - mode approximation of ref .",
    "@xcite and/or consider contributions of many instantons .",
    "both ways would lead to extra powers of the packing fraction of instantons .",
    "this means that gluons at low normalization point inside the nucleons appear only at the level of @xmath181 .",
