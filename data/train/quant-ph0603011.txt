    "quantum mechanics is a sort of `` syntactic manual '' for physical theories : it is a set of rules that hold for any physical field ",
    "electroweak , nuclear , gravitational  and apply to the entire physical domain , from micro to macro , independently of the size and energy scale .",
    "should we consider quantum mechanics a general law of nature , or , instead , a logical necessity , a _",
    "miniature epistemology _ ?",
    "indeed , for the first time in the history of physics , quantum mechanics in its very essence addresses the crucial problem of the _ physical measurement _ ,",
    "problem which is at the core of physics as an experimental science .",
    "it is not the physical description of the specific instrumentation that i m talking about , but the general process of information retrieval in _ any _ measurement , via interaction of the measured system with the measuring apparatus .",
    "i would say that quantum mechanics more generally deals with the description of the _ physical experiment _ , which is indeed the epistemic archetype , the prototype _ cognitive act _ of interaction with reality .    in the above framework it is mandatory to derive quantum mechanics from purely operational axioms .",
    "this is not just for the sake of establishing more general and irreducible foundations , but also to understand the intimate relations between general epistemic issues  such as locality , causality , probability interpretations , holism versus reductionism , and growth of experimental complexity with the `` size '' of the measured system .    in the present work the starting point for axiomatization",
    "is a very comprehensive definition of _ physical experiment_. as i have shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the adoption of such a general definition of experiment constitutes a very seminal point for axiomatization , entailing a thorough series of notions that are usually considered of quantum nature  such as the same probabilistic notion of state , and the notions of conditional state , local state , pure state , faithful state , instrument , propensity ( `` effect '' ) , dynamical and informational equivalence , dynamical and informational compatibility , predictability , discriminability , programmability , locality , a - causality , and even many notions of dimensionality , orthogonality of states , rank of a state , etc : for more details the interested reader is addressed to ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we will see how , assuming _ experimental accessibility and simplicity _ in terms of five simple operational axioms , the present conception of experiment brings his own hilbert - space formulation , which in turns entails the quantum mechanical one .",
    "the possibility of deriving the hilbert - space formulation from experimental simplicity / accessibility was first conjectured in the earlier attempt @xcite . as we will see , very interesting roles are played by postulates numbered as [ p : infocom ] , [ p : locobs ] , and [ p : faith ] in the following , namely : ( [ p : infocom ] ) the assumed existence of informationally complete measurements , ( [ p : locobs ] ) the local observability principle , and ( [ p : faith ] ) the existence of symmetric faithful states . postulate [ p : infocom ] minimizes the number of different apparatuses that are needed to retrieve any different kind of information .",
    "postulate [ p : locobs ] makes it possible to make joint observations using only the same local measuring apparatuses used for measurements on single systems .",
    "this also reconciles the holism of nonlocality with the reductionism of local observation . postulate [ p : faith ] ( in conjunction with the other two ) allows one to calibrate any experimental apparatus by just a single input state preparation .",
    "it also allows one to introduce an operational definition for the `` real adjoint''i .",
    "e. the transposition  from which one can derive a real hilbert space structure via either the mackey - kakutani @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) , or the gelfand - naimark - segal @xcite constructions .",
    "moreover , the postulates entail general dimensionality theorems , which are in agreement with the quantum mechanical rule of tensor product of hilbert spaces for composition of independent systems , and show that the derived real hilbert space is isomorphic to the real hilbert space of hermitian complex matrices representing selfadjoint operators over a complex hilbert space , which is the hilbert space formulation of quantum mechanics . in deriving one of the dimensionality theorems",
    "i have made , however , the implicit assumption that the relation between the affine dimension and the informational dimension for a convex set of state is the same for all physical systems  a sort of informational universality ( see the discussion at the end of the paper ) .",
    "the present research has been stimulated by the recent noteworthy works on axiomatization of quantum mechanics by l. hardy @xcite and by c. fuchs @xcite .",
    "however , apart from a prominent role played by the informationally complete measurements , the relative implications and connections with these works remain rather obscure to me , and will be object of future studies .",
    "some expert readers will recognize strong affinities of the present work with the program of g. ludwig @xcite , who sought operational principles to select the structure of quantum states from all possible convex structures ( see also papers collected in the book @xcite ) . these works did nt have a followup mostly because the convex structure by itself is quite poor mathematically . here",
    "we use new crucial concepts that were almost unknown in those years , concepts originated from the field of quantum tomography @xcite .",
    "in particular , recently it has been shown that it is possible to make a complete quantum calibration of a measuring apparatus @xcite or of a quantum operation @xcite by using a single pure bipartite state , and , more generally , using a faithful state @xcite .",
    "this gives us a unique opportunity for deriving the hilbert space structure from the convex structure in terms of calibrability axioms , relying on the special link between the convex set of transformations and the convex set of states which occurs in quantum mechanics , and which make the transformations of a single system closely resemble the states of a bipartite system @xcite .",
    "[ ga:1 ] in any experimental science we make _ experiments _ to get _ information _ on the _ state _ of a _ objectified physical system_. knowledge of such a state will allow us to predict the results of forthcoming experiments on the same object system .",
    "since we necessarily work with only partial _ a priori _ knowledge of both system and experimental apparatus , the rules for the experiment must be given in a probabilistic setting .",
    "[ ga:2 ] an experiment on an object system consists in having it interact with an apparatus .",
    "the interaction between object and apparatus produces one of a set of possible transformations of the object , each one occurring with some probability .",
    "information on the `` state '' of the object system at the beginning of the experiment is gained from the knowledge of which transformation occurred , which is the `` outcome '' of the experiment signaled by the apparatus .",
    "there exist independent physical systems .",
    "[ p : infocom ] for each physical system there exists an informationally complete observable .    [ p : locobs ] for every composite system there exist informationally complete observables made only of minimal local informationally complete observables .",
    "[ p : bell ] on every composite system made of two identical physical systems there exists a discriminating observable that gives a minimal informationally complete observable for one of the components , for some preparations of the other component .",
    "[ p : faith ] for every composite system made of two identical physical systems there exist a symmetric joint state that is both dynamically and preparationally faithful .",
    "the general axioms [ ga:1 ] and [ ga:2 ] entail a very rich series of notions , including those used in the postulates  independent systems , observable , informationally complete observable , etc . in sections [ s : states]-[s :",
    "faithful ] , starting from the two general axioms , i will introduce step by step such notions , starting from the pertaining definitions , and then giving the logically related rules . for a discussion on the general axioms the reader",
    "is addressed to the publication @xcite , where also the generality of the definition of experiment given in the general axioms [ ga:1 ] is analyzed in some detail .",
    "performing a different experiment on the same object obviously corresponds to the use of a different experimental apparatus or , at least , to a change of some settings of the apparatus .",
    "abstractly , this corresponds to change the set @xmath0 of possible transformations , @xmath1 , that the system can undergo .",
    "such change could actually mean really changing the `` dynamics '' of the transformations , but it may simply mean changing only their probabilities , or , just their labeling outcomes .",
    "any such change actually corresponds to a change of the experimental setup .",
    "therefore , the set of all possible transformations @xmath0 will be identified with the choice of experimental setting , with the _ experiment _ itself  or , equivalently , with the _ action _ of the experimenter : this will be formalized by the following definition    an * action * or * experiment * on the object system is given by the set @xmath2 of possible transformations @xmath1 having overall unit probability , with the apparatus signaling the * outcome * @xmath3 labeling which transformation actually occurred .    thus the action / experiment is just a _ complete _ set of possible transformations that can occur in an experiment . as we can see now , in a general probabilistic framework the _ action _",
    "@xmath4 is the `` cause '' , whereas the _ outcome _",
    "@xmath3 labeling the transformation @xmath1 that actually occurred is the `` effect '' .",
    "the _ action _ has to be regarded as the `` cause '' , since it is the option of the experimenter , and , as such , it should be viewed as deterministic ( at least one transformation @xmath5 will occur with certainty ) , whereas the outcome @xmath3which transformation @xmath1 occurs  is probabilistic .",
    "the special case of a deterministic transformation @xmath6 corresponds to a _",
    "singleton action / experiment _ @xmath7 .    in the following ,",
    "wherever we consider a nondeterministic transformation @xmath6 by itself , we always regard it in the context of an experiment , namely for any nondeterministic transformation there always exists at least a complementary one @xmath8 such that the overall probability of occurrence of one of them is always unit . according to general axiom [ ga:1 ] by definition the knowledge of the state of a physical system allows us to predict the results of forthcoming possible experiments on the system , or , more generally , on another system in the same physical situation .",
    "then , according to the general axiom [ ga:2 ] a precise knowledge of the state of a system would allow us to evaluate the probabilities of any possible transformation for any possible experiment .",
    "it follows that the only possible definition of state is the following    [ istate ] a state @xmath9 for a physical system is a rule that provides the probability for any possible transformation , namely @xmath10    we assume that the identical transformation @xmath11 occurs with probability one , namely @xmath12 this corresponds to a kind of _ interaction picture _ , in which we do not consider the free evolution of the system ( the scheme could be easily generalized to include a free evolution ) .",
    "mathematically , a state will be a map @xmath9 from the set of physical transformations to the interval @xmath13 $ ] , with the normalization condition ( [ normcond ] ) .",
    "moreover , for every action @xmath14 one has the normalization of probabilities @xmath15 for all states @xmath9 of the system . as already noticed in ref .",
    "@xcite , in order to include also non - disturbing experiments , one must conceive situations in which all states are left invariant by each transformation .",
    "the fact that we necessarily work in the presence of partial knowledge about both object and apparatus requires that the specification of the state and of the transformation could be given incompletely / probabilistically , entailing a convex structure on states and an addition rule for coexistent transformations .",
    "the convex structure of states is given more precisely by the rule    [ idim ] the possible states of a physical system comprise a convex set : for any two states @xmath16 and @xmath17 we can consider the state @xmath9 which is the _ mixture _ of @xmath16 and @xmath17 , corresponding to have @xmath16 with probability @xmath18 and @xmath17 with probability @xmath19",
    ". we will write @xmath20 and the state @xmath9 will correspond to the following probability rule for transformations @xmath6",
    "@xmath21    generalization to more than two states is obtained by induction . in the following the convex set of states",
    "will be denoted by @xmath22 .",
    "we will call _ pure _ the states which are the extremal elements of the convex set , namely which can not be obtained as mixture of any two states , and we will call _ mixed _ the non - extremal ones . as",
    "regards transformations , the addition of coexistent transformations and the convex structure will be considered in rules [ g : addtrans ] and [ r : convextrans ] .",
    "[ isemigroup ] the composition @xmath23 of two transformations @xmath6 and @xmath8 is itself a transformation .",
    "consistency of compostion of transformations requires _ associativity _ , namely @xmath24 there exists the identical transformation @xmath11 which leaves the physical system invariant , and which for every transformation @xmath6 satisfies the composition rule @xmath25 therefore , transformations make a semigroup with identity , a _",
    "monoid_.    [ iindep ] we say that two physical systems are _ independent _ if on each system we can perform _ local experiments _ that do not affect the other system for any joint state of the two systems .",
    "this can be expressed synthetically with the commutativity of transformations of the local experiments , namely @xmath26 where the label @xmath27 of the transformations denotes the system undergoing the transformation .    in the following , when we have more than one independent system",
    ", we will denote local transformations as ordered strings of transformations as follows @xmath28 where the list of transformation on the left denotes the occurrence of local transformation @xmath6 on system 1 , @xmath8 on system 2 , etc .",
    "when composing two transformations @xmath6 and @xmath8 , the probability @xmath29 that @xmath8 occurs conditional on the previous occurrence of @xmath6 is given by the bayes rule @xmath30    the bayes rule leads to the concept of _ conditional state _ :    [ istatecond ] the _ conditional state _",
    "@xmath31 gives the probability that a transformation @xmath8 occurs on the physical system in the state @xmath9 after the transformation @xmath6 has occurred , namely @xmath32    in the following we will make extensive use of the functional notation @xmath33 where the centered dot stands for the argument of the map . therefore , the notion of conditional state describes the most general _",
    "evolution_.    [ istateloc ] in the presence of many independent systems in a joint state @xmath34 , we define the * local state * @xmath35 of the @xmath36-th system the state that gives the probability for any local transformation @xmath6 on the @xmath36-th system , with all other systems untouched , namely @xmath37    for example , for two systems only , ( which is equivalent to group @xmath38 systems into a single one ) , we just write @xmath39 .",
    "notice that generally commutativity of local transformations ( definition [ iindep ] ) does not imply that a transformation on system 2 does not affect the conditioned local state on system 1 .",
    "we also emphasize that acausality of local actions is not logically entailed by system independence ( for a discussion about acausality see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    at this point",
    "it is worth noticing that the present definition of `` state '' , which logically follows from the definition of experiment , leads to a _ notion of evolution as state - conditioning_. in this way , each transformation acts linearly on the state space .",
    "in addition , since states are probability functionals on transformations , by dualism ( equivalence classes of ) transformations are linear functionals over the state space .    for the following it is convenient to extend the notion of state to that of _ weight _ , namely nonnegative bounded functionals @xmath40 over the set of transformations with @xmath41 for all transformations @xmath6 .",
    "to each weight @xmath40 it corresponds the properly normalized state @xmath42    weights make the convex cone @xmath43 which is generated by the convex set of states @xmath22 .",
    "we extend the notion of weight to that of negative weight , by taking differences .",
    "such generalized weights span the affine linear space @xmath44 of the convex cone of weights .",
    "the transformations @xmath6 act as linear transformations over the space of weights as follows @xmath45    we are now in position to introduce the concept of _ operation_.    [ operation ] to each transformation @xmath6 we can associate a linear map @xmath46 , which sends a state @xmath9 into the unnormalized state @xmath47 , defined by the relation @xmath48    similarly to a state , the linear form @xmath49 for fixed @xmath6 maps from the set of transformations to the interval @xmath13 $ ] .",
    "it is not strictly a state only due to lack of normalization , since @xmath50 .",
    "the operation @xmath51 gives the conditioned state through the state - reduction rule @xmath52",
    "from the bayes rule , or , equivalently , from the definition of conditional state , we see that we can have the following complementary situations :    1 .",
    "there are different transformations which produce the same state change , but generally occur with different probabilities ; 2 .",
    "there are different transformations which always occur with the same probability , but generally affect a different state change .",
    "the above observation leads us to the following definitions of dynamical and informational equivalences of transformations .",
    "[ d : dyneq ] two transformations @xmath6 and @xmath8 are dynamically equivalent if @xmath53 for all possible states @xmath9 of the system .",

    "[ d : compleq ] two transformations / experiments are completely equivalent iff they are both dynamically and informationally equivalent .",
    "notice that even though two transformations are completely equivalent , in principle they can still be different experimentally , in the sense that they are achieved with different apparatus .",
    "however , we emphasize that outcomes in different experiments corresponding to equivalent transformations always provide the same information on the state of the object , and , moreover , the corresponding transformations of the state are the same .",
    "the concept of dynamical equivalence of transformations leads one to introduce a convex structure also for transformations .",
    "we first need the notion of informational compatibility .",
    "we say that two transformations @xmath6 and @xmath8 are _ coexistent _ or _ informationally compatible _ if one has @xmath56    the fact that two transformations are coexistent means that , in principle , they can occur in the same experiment , namely there exists at least an action containing both of them .",

    "( [ hd ] ) i have implicitly assumed that the relation between the affine dimension and the informational dimension which holds for bipartite systems must hold for any system .",
    "indeed , one can prove independently that @xmath344 since locally perfectly discriminable states are also jointly discriminable , and the existence of a preparationally faithful state guarantees the existence of @xmath345 jointly discriminable states , the bound in place of the identity coming from the fact that we are not guaranteed that the set of jointly discriminable states made of local ones is maximal . at the present stage of this research in progress it is still not clear if the mentioned implicit assumption is avoidable , and , if not , how relevant it is .",
    "one may need to add another postulate requiring a kind of universality of informational laws such as @xmath346independently on the physical system , on the convex set of states @xmath22 .",
    "it is also possible that in this way postulate [ p : bell ] can be avoided .",

    "<S> in the present paper i show how it is possible to derive the hilbert space formulation of quantum mechanics from a comprehensive definition of _ physical experiment _ and assuming _ experimental accessibility and simplicity _ as specified by five simple postulates . </S>",

    "<S> pivotal roles are played by the _ local observability principle _ , which reconciles the holism of nonlocality with the reductionism of local observation , and by the postulated existence of _ informationally complete observables _ and of a _ symmetric faithful state_. this last notion allows one to introduce an operational definition for the real version of the  adjoint \" i . </S>",
