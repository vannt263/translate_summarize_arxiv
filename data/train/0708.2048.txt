    "supersymmetry ( susy ) is one of the most elegant extensions of the standard model ( sm ) which naturally stabilizes the higgs boson mass even in the presence of a very energy scale like the grand unification scale ( @xmath4 ) @xcite .",
    "this occurs due to the cancellation of the quadratic divergences among loop diagrams involving sm particles and their superpartners ( sparticles ) .",
    "this cancellation , however , looses much of its attractive naturalness and smacks of fine tuning if the sparticles are much heavier than the corresponding particles .",
    "thus susy models with sparticle masses much larger than 1 tev are usually disfavored .",
    "on the other hand it is well known that if the scalar superpartners of the fermions belonging to the first two generations in the sm are very heavy with masses in the multi - tev region then several problems can be avoided without further unnatural adjustment of the parameters .",
    "firstly in the most general minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) there are unacceptably large loop induced flavor changing neutral currents unless the masses of the first two generations of squark are assumed to be degenerate to a very good approximation without a symmetry underlying this degeneracy .",
    "this susy flavor problem becomes less severe if the above loops are suppressed by the masses of the heavy scalars .",
    "secondly susy models with complex soft breaking parameters have potentially dangerous large loop induced cp violating contributions to the electric dipole moments of various particles in general .",
    "this susy cp problem is also tamed if the scalars are very heavy .",
    "therefore models with very heavy scalars without sacrificing the naturalness criterion are indeed welcome .",
    "all the above attractive features are realized in the focus point ( fp)/ hyperbolic branch region @xcite of the minimal supergravity(msugra ) model@xcite .",
    "the susy flavor and cp problems become less severe @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath5 , the higgsino mass parameter , which is fixed by the radiative electroweak symmetry breaking ( rewsb ) condition , also turns out to be @xmath6 as required by naturalness@xcite .",
    "the low value of @xmath5 thus obtained has another important implication .",
    "the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) which is the lightest neutralino ( @xmath7 ) over most of the parameter space , is usually a mixture of the electroweak gauginos and higgsinos .",
    "however , for small @xmath5 the higgsino component in @xmath7 dominates . in this case @xmath7",
    "very efficiently annihilates into gauge boson pairs leaving open the attractive possibility that lsp could be a viable dark matter candidate @xcite .",
    "in fact it is now widely acknowledged that the focus point region of the msugra model leads to a dark matter density compatible with the latest wmap data @xcite .",
    "thanks to the above interesting features the collider signatures of focus point supersymmetry have attracted wide attention@xcite .",
    "although the scalar quarks are rather heavy in this model , naturalness arguments imply that the gluinos must be necessarily light @xcite .",
    "thus the gluinos are the lightest strongly interacting sparticles within the striking range of the lhc .",
    "inspite of the fact that the squarks belonging to the first two generations are indeed very heavy , the lighter squark mass eigenstates belonging to the third generation , though significantly heavier than the gluino , may be relatively light at the weak scale @xmath8 .",
    "this is partly due to the renormalization group ( rg ) evolution from @xmath9 to @xmath8 driven by large yukawa couplings and partly due to mixing effects in the mass matrices ( see , e.g. , @xcite eqns.3 - 11 ) . as a result",
    "the gluino preferentially decays into third generation quarks via three body modes mediated by the relatively light squarks .",
    "therefore dominant decay modes of the gluino are @xmath10 where @xmath11 t or b , @xmath12 ( the ith neutralino ) , i = 1 - 4 and y@xmath13 ( the jth chargino ) , j=1,2",
    ". hence the signals of gluino decay at the lhc will be rich in b - jets @xcite .",
    "in addition one or more reconstructed w bosons in the final state may also help susy search via this channel .",
    "the size of the signal involving involving @xmath14 tagged b - jets ( introduced mainly to control the qcd background ) and various number of leptons was estimated by a parton level monte carlo in @xcite . the sm background from @xmath15 production",
    "only was estimated to be small after imposing a strong missing transverse energy @xmath16 cut .",
    "subsequently the lhc signal of focus point supersymmetry have been studied by several groups using simulations beyond the naive parton level @xcite - @xcite .",
    "some of these works required @xmath17 2 tagged b - jets in the final state for efficient background rejection .",
    "these works will be briefly reviewed in a later section .",
    "however , none of these works considered the background from @xmath18 production , where @xmath19 = t or b. apriorily , however , some of these backgrounds with production cross sections larger than the gluino pair production cross section ( see section 2 ) by several orders of magnitude seem to be potentially dangerous .",
    "moreover , these backgrounds are rich in b - jets .",
    "hence b - tagging which effectively suppresses light flavor qcd events may not be very effective .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study the above backgrounds systematically ( see section 2 ) along with a thorough study of the signal and other backgrounds .",
    "we have calculated the new background cross sections using calchep@xcite * v2.4.5 * , alpgen @xcite * v2.1.1 * and madgraph @xcite * v4.1*. the results agree fairly well .",
    "the parton level events are then interfaced with pythia @xcite * v6.4.8 * for implementing hadronization , fragmentation and a toy detector simulation and analyzed with suitable selection criteria .",
    "we shall also study the response of these backgrounds to the cuts used by other groups @xcite .",
    "we next study the dominant qcd and @xmath20 backgrounds as well as the signal using our selection criteria and compare and contrast the results with other published works ( see section 2 ) . in order to facilitate the comparison we required like other groups @xmath17 2 b - jet tags .",
    "finally the consequences of selecting a signal with a richer b - jet content as suggested in @xcite are examined .",
    "our conclusions and future outlooks will be summarized in section 3 .",
    "we begin by briefly reviewing some of the earlier works .",
    "baer @xcite scanned the focus point region of the msugra parameter space consistent with the wmap data .",
    "the lhc reach in channels with m - jets + n - leptons + @xmath16 was then examined .",
    "it was concluded that the part of the focus point region corresponding to gluino masses @xmath21 1.8 tev is within the reach of lhc .",
    "the suppression of the sm background due to light flavor qcd , @xmath20 etc was considered in estimating the mass reach .",
    "however , one of the key features of the signal in the focus point region , namely the large number of b - jets in the final state was not utilized in improving the signal to background ratio .",
    "subsequently mercadante @xcite estimated that requiring final states with tagged b - jets as suggested in @xcite and by adjusting the kinematical cuts the gluino mass reach can be improved by about 20% .",
    "however , the potential backgrounds from four heavy flavor production mentioned in the introduction were not included in either of the above analyses .",
    "the viability of susy signals in the regions of the parameter space consistent with dark matter data was also studied by the cms collaboration @xcite .",
    "this analysis included only a part of the fp region ( @xmath22 2 tev ) and the above potential backgrounds were neglected .    a few points ( fp1 - fp5 ) in the fp region allowed by the wmap data from @xcite",
    "are shown in table [ tab : signalatlhc ] .",
    "all masses and mass parameters in this paper are in gev unless otherwise stated .",
    "the other msugra parameters are @xmath23 = 0 , tan @xmath24 = 30 and sign(@xmath5)@xmath25 0 . for each point the gluino mass and the lowest order gluino pair production cross section ( in fb ) for two choices of the qcd scale ( see the last two columns in table [ tab : signalatlhc ] ) are also shown .",
    "the first choice yielding smaller cross sections will be subsequently referred to as the conservative choice .",
    "the second choice , motivated by the fact that at this scale the leading and next to leading order production cross sections almost agree @xcite , is the optimistic choice .",
    "it is to be noted that we have considered gluino masses near the lhc search limit only .",
    "the gluino pair production cross section in the leading order is computed by calchep .",
    "the expected sharp fall of the cross section for gluino masses near the kinematic limit is quite apparent .    from the dominant gluino decay modes discussed in the introduction",
    "it is clear that a typical final state will consist of four third generation quarks and their decay products .",
    "additional quarks , leptons and missing energy would come from the decays of heavier charginos and neutralinos also produced in gluino decays .",
    "thus the multiplicity of jets and hard isolated leptons in the signal would be large . keeping this in mind the criteria listed below for selecting ( rejecting ) the signal ( the background ) events",
    "have been formulated .",
    "it should be noted that instead of separately requiring large number of jets and hard isolated leptons ( henceforth jets and isolated leptons will be collectively called _ objects _ ) we require the total number objects in the final state to exceed nine .",

    "* @xmath31 = @xmath32 gev .",
    "it may be noted that at this stage the constraint on @xmath33 is similar to the one employed by other analyses .",
    "we shall show below that requiring more tagged b - jets in the final state as suggested in @xcite improves the signal vis a vis the background .",
    "we begin the analysis by estimating the backgrounds from production of four heavy flavors in different combinations .",
    "this will be followed by the simulation of more conventional backgrounds and the signal also studied by other groups .",
    "the production cross sections computed by calchep , alpgen and madgraph are presented in table [ tab : allatlhc ] .",

    "however , in spite of this uncertainty some of the background processes have cross sections several orders of magnitude larger than that of the signal , which is typically a few fb for @xmath45 near the lhc search limit ( see table 1 ) .",
    "thus it is worthwhile to see the response of these backgrounds to our choice of the kinematical cuts listed below as well as to the cuts used by similar analyses @xcite .",

    "it is quite plausible that in a real life situation such jets indeed arise from showering .",
    "however as noted before the number of such jets in an event crucially depends on the parton showering model in the generator .",
    "therefore the reliability of the background estimate both in this work as well as in @xcite can not be guaranteed until the showering model is validated using lhc data . in the next paragraph",
    "we briefly summarize a study @xcite which indicates that the @xmath112 background estimated as above may not be wide off the mark .",
    "it is certainly desirable to supplement the lowest order estimates of the background by higher order matrix element calculations .",
    "however , care must be taken to avoid double counting of jets which may arise in a lower order calculation due to hard emissions during shower evolution as well as from a higher order matrix element .",
    "a proper matching of matrix elements and shower evolution is , therefore , called for . in reference",
    "@xcite the lowest order cross section of @xmath112 production was computed . next the combined cross section of the processes @xmath112(exclusive ) , @xmath113(exclusive ) , @xmath114(exclusive)and @xmath115(inclusive ) , where j stands for a light quark or gluon , were obtained after matrix element matching ( see table 1 and table 2 of @xcite ) .",
    "the two results agree nicely both for tevatron and lhc energies .",
    "a similar agreement is found for various distributions of the produced @xmath116 system computed by the two different ways .",
    "it is these distributions which after all determine the efficiencies of various cuts .",
    "thus one may conclude that at least the lowest order @xmath112 background including parton showering which is the dominant background for the signal under study is fairly reliable .",
    "the case of the pure light flavor qcd background is rather similar .",
    "the required final state with nine objects from this 2 @xmath117 2 process can arise solely due to parton showering and , therefore , model dependent to some extent . simulating the lowest order qcd processes in pythia",
    "we find that the size of this background is smaller than the @xmath112 background but is non - negligible .",
    "however the entire contribution comes from qcd - high events @xmath118 gev . after generating 15 million qcd - low ( 100 gev @xmath119 gev ) events we found that no event survive the cuts .",
    "we now compare our results with other calculations which required two or more tagged b - jets in the final state",
    ". a comparison with @xcite may not be meaningful as their cuts are designed for the search of a relatively light gluino ( @xmath45 = 857.0 ) .",
    "in fact with their cuts we find that the survival probability of the @xmath112 background is twice as large as our estimate and will overwhelm the gluino signal for @xmath120 2 tev , which is roughly the lhc reach in the fp region , having a cross section not exceeding a few fb s .",
    "the @xmath20 background after all cuts estimated by baer @xcite is 1.5 fb with a tiny contribution from qcd . on the other hand",
    "we get a smaller @xmath112 background while the qcd background is non - negligible .",
    "thus one may conclude that our cuts are more efficient in reducing the former background while the cuts of @xcite may be better for eliminating the qcd backgrounds .",
    "a more detailed comparison is not possible since we donot know the qcd scales for different cross sections in @xcite .",
    "it is probably a numerical conspiracy that the total background ( @xmath112 + qcd ) computed by the two groups agree rather nicely .",
    "however , the fact that two groups using different event generators and different sets of kinematical cuts get comparable results at least indicates that the major backgrounds obscuring the search for focus point susy at lhc are fairly well understood .",
    "we next present the signal size for different gluino masses .",
    "the efficiencies of the cuts used in this paper for the scenario fp1 are in table 5 while the signal size for the conservative scale choice in different scenarios after all cuts are in table [ tab : bkgd - xsec ] .",
    "the signal cross sections should be multiplied by a factor of 2 if the scale @xmath1212 is considered ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the @xmath16 , @xmath122 and @xmath123 distributions are in figs . 2 and 3 .",
    "comparing these with the background cross sections and taking the qcd scale uncertainty into account it is clear that the gluino mass reach at the lhc can not be pin pointed as yet .",
    "nevertheless the following comments are in order .",
    "using the optimistic scale choice (= @xmath1212 ) one finds that for fp1(fp3 ) ( corresponding to @xmath45 = 1751.3 ( 1950 ) ) s/@xmath124=10.0 ( 4.0 ) with an integrated luminosity 300 fb @xmath2 , where s and b are the number of signal and background events respectively . of course the s/@xmath124 ratio may be modestly increased by optimizing the cuts @xcite . on the other hand",
    "the lo signal cross section at the scale @xmath1212 mimics the nlo cross section @xcite . in view of this",
    "the next to leading order @xmath116 cross section ( about a factor of 2 larger than the cross section in table [ tab : bkgd - xsec ] ) may give a more reliable background estimate .",
    "this will further suppress the s/@xmath124 ratio by a factor of @xmath125 .",
    "for the conservative scale choice on the other hand the above ratios will be suppressed by a factor of two . on the whole it seems unlikely that using the selection criteria based on 2 or more tagged b - jets as is usually required , the gluino mass reach at lhc can be pushed far beyond 1.8 tev with certainty .",
    "we now impose a more stringent b - identification criteria as suggested in @xcite and require @xmath17 3 b - jet tags keeping all other selection criteria listed above unchanged . the residual signal and the backgrounds",
    "are shown in the last column of table 6 .",
    "even the conservative scale choice now yields s/@xmath124 ratio 8.5 ( 3.4 ) for @xmath45 = 1751.3 ( 1950 ) . for the optimistic scale choice",
    "the above ratios are enhanced approximately by a factor of @xmath126 after doubling the background which should reflect the theoretical uncertainties due to possible nlo corrections etc . in view of the possibility of further improving this ratio by optimizing the selection criteria",
    ", one can hope that irrespective of the uncertainty due to the choice of scale the reach in @xmath45 at lhc is close to 2.0 tev .",
    "if supersymmetry in the focus point region is realized in nature it may lead to spectacular signals at the lhc via gluino pair production @xcite .",
    "we propose a new set of criteria for selecting(rejecting ) the signal ( background ) ( see section 2 ) .",
    "we have extended the estimation of the backgrounds which may hinder the search for supersymmetry in the focus point region .",
    "in particular we have simulated and analyzed the potentially dangerous backgrounds from different processes involving four heavy flavor quark production which have so far been neglected .",
    "some of these processes have cross sections several orders of magnitude larger than that of the signal .",
    "moreover these backgrounds are rich in b - jets and can not be reduced by b - tagging which is recommended as one of the most effective tools for removing other sm backgrounds @xcite .    using rather stringent cuts ( see section 2 ) appropriate for detecting relatively heavy gluinos with masses near the kinematic reach of the lhc , we have shown that these background are highly suppressed(see table 4 ) .",
    "on the other hand for less severe cuts often employed for relatively light gluinos in the focus point region ( see for example @xcite ) , these backgrounds may be small but numerically significant and call for some attention .",
    "we have also simulated the conventional sm backgrounds estimated by other groups .",
    "we qualitatively agree with the observation @xcite that @xmath112 events are the most severe background to the gluino signal . in view of various theoretical uncertainties in the production cross sections",
    "the lhc reach in @xmath45 can not be pinpointed as yet .",
    "this is especially so if the selection criteria is restricted to @xmath17 2 tagged b - jets which is the usual strategy . requiring 3 or more",
    "tagged b - jets in the signal the gluino mass reach at lhc is close to 2.0 tev even with a modest production cross section corresponding to a conservative choice of the qcd scale .",
    "we look forward to improved b - tagging efficiencies along with improvement in the theoretical understanding ( e.g. , the inclusion of matrix element matching ) of the light flavor qcd and other backgrounds for a better handle on gluino searches in the fp scenario .    * acknowledgement * : spd acknowledges postdoctoral fellowships from bundesministerium fr bildung und forschung ( bmbf ) projekt under contract no . 05ht6pda and harish chandra research institute where part of this work was done .",
