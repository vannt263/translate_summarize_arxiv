    "as the ground - based telescopes become bigger , more emphasis is made on studying and modeling atmospheric optical distortions at large spatial scales .",
    "this knowledge is required , e.g. for specifying the stroke of deformable mirrors in adaptive optics or the range of fringe - trackers in interferometers . moreover ,",
    "the size of the atmospheric coherence length exceeds 1 m at infrared ( ir ) wavelengths .",
    "thus , even classical long - exposure imagery in the ir is affected by the departures of turbulence statistics from the standard kolmogorov model ( variance proportional to the 5/3 power of the baseline ) which was so successfully used in the visible range .",
    "optical path - length fluctuations were measured with long - baseline interferometers , but the published results are controversial .",
    "saturation of the fringe motions at baselines from 8 m to 16 m was first observed by @xcite .",
    "later , @xcite found a strong departure from the kolmogorov law and a saturation of the path - length fluctuations at the 80-m baseline at a level of about 10@xmath1 m rms . on the other hand ,",
    "@xcite have not found any departure from the kolmogorov law at baselines up to 12 m by doing a temporal analysis of the fringe motion , and @xcite reached the same conclusion from interferometric measurements of the fringe motion in a 4-m telescope aperture .",
    "the controversy could be caused by the use of the frozen - flow hypothesis in the interpretation of fringe motion on a single baseline .",
    "another reason is the difficulty in separating fringe motion caused by the atmosphere from the mechanical noise due to instrument instabilities , tracking , etc .",
    "turbulence outer scale @xmath2 can be evaluated from the covariances of the image motion in small telescopes , as implemented in the gsm instrument @xcite , or from the analysis of adaptive - optics data , e.g. by @xcite .",
    "these methods use the von krmn ( vk ) turbulence spectrum ( cf .",
    "appendix a ) and adjust its parameters @xmath3 to fit the data .",
    "measurements with the gsm at different sites show that typical @xmath2 values are of the order of 20 m .",
    "@xcite compared directly fringe motion in a long - baseline interferometer with the @xmath2 measured by gsm and found a good agreement .",
    "this short and non - exhaustive review demonstrates that further work on characterizing large - scale turbulence structure is needed",
    ". a direct comparison of mid - ir and optical images at a large telescope offers a new , independent way to probe turbulence models at spatial scales from centimeters to meters . to our knowledge , no such work has been done previously , so we made an experiment at the very large telescope ( vlt ) located at the eso observatory cerro paranal in chile .",
    "the main purpose of this experiment is to evaluate the atmospheric phase structure function ( sf ) and to check if the vk model is adequate .",
    "so far , the mathematically convenient vk model has been used without being actually tested .",

    "it is well known that the modulus of the long - exposure optical transfer function ( otf ) @xmath4 in a perfect telescope is related to the atmospheric sf @xmath5 as @xcite    @xmath6 , \\label{eq : t}\\ ] ]    where @xmath7 is the diffraction - limited otf , @xmath8 is the vector of spatial frequency on the sky in rad@xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the imaging wavelength and @xmath12 is the baseline vector .",
    "this relation can be inverted to reconstruct @xmath13 from the known image point spread function ( psf ) .",
    "however , it is only feasible at the baselines @xmath14 where @xmath15 is not very large or small , otherwise @xmath16 is close to either 1 or 0 and the sensitivity to the atmospheric turbulence is lost . in the visible range ,",
    "the method probes centimetric and decametric scales , in the mid - ir it is sensitive to the metric scales because @xmath11 is much larger .",
    "the 8-m vlt telescope offers a unique platform for our experiment with access to metric baselines .",
    "the aberrations are removed by active optics and the turbulence inside the dome is low , ensuring that the image blur is dominated by the atmospheric seeing .",
    "optical images as small as @xmath17 fwhm have been recorded under exceptional conditions , proving that the vlt intrinsic quality is nearly ideal even in the visible range . for our purpose ,",
    "the mid - ir imager visir installed at the cassegrain focus of the ut3 telescope is the best choice .",
    "a deeper analysis of the mid - ir images shows that some departures from the ideal - telescope model ( [ eq : t ] ) are inevitable .",
    "residual image motion ( tilt ) is the largest source of uncertainty , as it can cause additional blur ( e.g. wind shake ) , while , on the other hand , part of the atmospheric tilt is removed by guiding .",
    "residual aberrations in the vlt optics and instrument can add something to the atmospheric psf , too .",
    "therefore , opto - mechanical wave - front distortions of instrumental nature can not be separated cleanly from the large - scale atmospheric distortions . in this respect",
    "our new experiment is not fundamentally different from long - baseline interferometers , but it was worth trying nevertheless because instrumental effects in both cases are different .",

    "on june 22/23 , under a better seeing , the psf is closer to a diffraction - limited one , but still elongated ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "the elongation can be caused by a combination of several factors including some residual low - order aberrations , vibrations , etc .",
    "however , the dominant contribution to the image elongation is likely related to the tilt anisoplanatism between the guide star and the object , estimated in appendix c. the direction of the elongation points approximately to the guide star .    each psf is fourier - transformed and the normalized modulus of the ft is identified with the observed @xmath29 ( fig .

    "the saturation of the otf ( hence sf ) is obvious .",
    "the vertical spread is caused by the asymmetry and the differences between the images a and b.    note that at small baselines the derived atmospheric otfs and sfs are sensitive to the normalization errors , while at large baselines the experimental @xmath29 becomes noisy and its modulus is biased by any image defects such as noise and bad pixels . for these reasons",
    ", we use for further analysis the baseline range from 0.4 m to 4 m , where @xmath29 is most reliable . in the following ,",

    "a typical exposure time is 45s , but the sh `` sees '' the star only during 1/2 of the chopping cycle . on the other hand ,",

    "we do not have all this information for the data at hand .",
