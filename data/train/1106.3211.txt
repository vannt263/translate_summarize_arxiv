    "all cells in an individual mammal have almost identical dna .",
    "yet , cell function within an organism has huge variation .",
    "one mechanism that differentiates cell function is its gene expression pattern .",
    "recent research has shown that this differentiation may be on a fine scale : that subtle sequence variants of expressed genes ( also referred to as transcripts ) , called isoforms , have significant impact on the function of the proteins encoded by the rna and hence their function in the cell ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to develop and analyze statistical methodology for measuring differential expression of isoforms using an emerging powerful technology called ultra high throughput sequencing ( uhts ) .",
    "such study has the potential to help reveal new insights into cellular isoform level gene expression patterns and mechanisms , including characteristics of cell specific specialization .",
    "the central dogma in biology describes the information transfer that allows cells to generate proteins , the building blocks of biological function .",
    "this dogma states that dna is transcribed to messenger rna ( mrna ) which is in turn translated into proteins .",
    "recent discoveries have highlighted the importance of regulation at the level of mrna , showing that protein levels and function can be regulated by subtle differences in the sequence of mrna molecules in a cell .    in bacteria ,",
    "short dna sequences are transcribed in a one to one fashion to mrna .",
    "this mrna is referred to as a  gene or a transcript . like dna ,",
    "each mrna is a string of nucleotides , each position taking four possible values .",
    "mammalian cells commonly generate a large class of mrna molecules from a  single relatively short dna sequence .",
    "the set of such mrna molecules are called isoforms of a  gene .",
    "this paper concentrates on one common mechanism generating isoforms called alternative splicing .",
    "an example of alternative splicing is depicted in figure [ fig : alternative_splicing ] : two isoforms can arise from the same gene when the dna , which is comprised of three sequence blocks ( called exons ) , can be transcribed into two different mrna molecules : one of which contains all three exons and one of which only contains the first and third exon .",
    "as this example shows , isoforms typically have highly similar sequence . despite this sequence similarity",
    ", isoforms can encode proteins which may have different functional roles .",
    "further , most  genes have more than three exons , and alternative use of exons can give rise to large numbers of isoforms .",
    "thus , it has been historically difficult for technology and statistical methods to allow researchers to distinguish between different isoforms of the same gene .",
    "ultra high throughput sequencing ( uhts or simply `` sequencing '' ) is an emerging technology which promises to become as ( or more ) powerful , popular and cost - effective than current microarray technology for several applications , including isoform estimation .",
    "when used to study mrna levels , uhts is referred to as rna - seq . in the past year , studies using uhts to study genome organization , including isoform expression , have been prominent ( see @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and featured in the journals science and nature ( see @xcite ; @xcite ) , which dubbed 2007 as the `` year of sequencing '' ( see @xcite ) .",
    "briefly , uhts is a method that relies on directly sequencing the nucleotides in a sample rather than inferring abundance of mrna by measuring intensities using predetermined homologous probes as microarrays do .",
    "thus , the data generated from an uhts experiment are large numbers of discrete strings of nucleotides , called base pairs ( bp ) , which can take values of a , c , g or t. in 2010 , each experiment produced tens of millions of up to 100bp reads .",
    "the throughput of this technology is expected to continue its rapid growth .",
    "two experimental protocols for rna - seq are in common use : ( a ) single end and ( b ) paired end sequencing experiments . for single end experiments ,",
    "one end ( typically about 50100 bp ) of a long ( typically 200400 nucleotide ) molecule is sequenced . for paired end experiments , typically 50100 bp of both ends of a typically 200400 nucleotide molecule are sequenced . using current illumina technology , each time the sequencing machine is operated , eight samples ( e.g. , potentially eight different catalogues of gene expression )",
    "can be interrogated ( essentially ) independently and tens of millions of reads are produced in each sample .",
    "an important application and use of uhts technology is to quantify the abundance of mrna in a cell ( rna - seq ) .",
    "this is done by matching the sequences generated in an uhts experiment to a  database of known mrna sequences ( called alignment ) and inferring the abundance of each mrna from the number of experimental reads ( fragments of the original mrna molecules ) aligning to it .",
    "sometimes , a statistical model is used for this estimate .",
    "importantly , experimental steps involved in an uhts experiment can affect the probability of each fragment being observed , although modeling of these processes is not the focus of this paper .",
    "the rapid technological advances in sequencing have spawned a large number of algorithms for analyzing sequence data ( see @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , some of which aim to estimate mrna abundance . to date ,",
    "inference on the abundance of mrna has been made by aligning reads to known genes and estimating a gene s expression by averaging the number of reads which map uniquely to it using the simplifying assumption that the transcript is sampled uniformly ( see @xcite ; @xcite ) , and sometimes using heuristic approaches to accommodate reads which map to multiple locations ( see @xcite ) .",
    "these models do not provide optimal estimators of isoform - specific expression levels and do not accommodate modeling of important steps in the experimental procedure .",
    "the work in this paper significantly extends a basic poisson model developed in  @xcite to allow for more flexible and efficient inference and establish rigorous statistical theory .",
    "in particular , the model in @xcite does not work with paired end sequencing data , or read - specific sample rate in a sequencing protocol .",
    "this paper introduces a statistical model for estimating isoform abundance from rna - seq data . by grouping the reads into categories and modeling the read counts within each category as poisson variables ,",
    "the model is flexible enough to accommodate both single end and paired end rna - seq data .",
    "based on the derivation of minimal sufficient statistics , a computationally feasible implementation of the maximum likelihood estimator of the model is provided . using a study of the fisher information and also numerical simulation ,",
    "it is shown that using paired end rna - seq one can get more accurate isoform abundance estimates . to the best of our knowledge , this is the first such statistically rigorous methodology and analysis to be developed .",
    "isoforms of a gene are subtle differences in a gene sequence , sometimes resulting from inclusion or exclusion of a single exon , a discrete piece of sequence depicted in figure  [ fig : alternative_splicing ] . in principle , compared to microarrays , uhts has the potential to provide high resolution estimates of isoform use .",
    "however , signal deconvolution must take place for these estimates to be accurate .    in order to estimate the expression of different isoforms of the same gene , several measurements of that gene s expression , whether from a microarray or sequencing , must be deconvolved .",
    "several studies have investigated this deconvolution problem when measurements are made from a microarray ( see @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "this paper presents an estimator for deconvolution for ultra high throughput sequencing experiments .    as mentioned , two experimental approaches for rna - seq are in wide use . in single end",
    "read experiments , reads are generated from one end of a  molecule ( depicted schematically in figure [ fig : longer_reads ] ) ; in paired end reads , reads are generated from both ends of a molecule , but typically a large number of nucleotides interior to the molecule are left unsequenced ( depicted schematically in figure [ fig : paired_reads ] ) .",
    "the length of the whole molecule being sequenced is called the insert size or insert length .     being alternatively spliced .",
    "reads that come from this gene are shown above the gene in solid bars and the parts that are not sequenced are shown in broken lines .",
    "reads that span an exon  exon junction are shown in solid bars connected by thin lines .",
    "reads that are related to the as exon are shown in red color . in this case only the reads in red are isoform informative . ]",
    "being alternatively spliced .",
    "paired end reads that come from this gene are shown above the gene in solid bars and the parts that are not sequenced are shown in broken lines .",
    "reads that span an exon  exon junction are shown in solid bars connected by thin line .",
    "reads that are directly related to the as exon are in red as before .",
    "reads that provide indirect information for separating isoform expressions are in green . ]    to appreciate the additional information provided by the paired end reads , consider figure  [ fig : longer_reads ] which depicts single end reads randomly sampled from a  transcript of a gene .",
    "suppose there are two possible isoforms for the transcript of this gene depending on whether an exon of length @xmath0 is retained or skipped . in this case ,",
    "only the reads that come from the alternatively spliced exon ( as  exon ) , or come from junctions involving either the as exon or the two neighboring exons , can provide information to distinguish the two isoforms from each other , that is , only these reads are isoform informative .",
    "if the as exon is short compared to the transcript , then the majority of the single end reads contain information only on gene level expression but not isoform level expression .",
    "assuming uniform distribution on the reads positions in the gene , it is evident that a read is related to the as exon with probability @xmath1 if the read comes from the as exon inclusive isoform , where @xmath2 is the length of the whole gene ( without the intronic regions ) and @xmath3 is the length of the reads .",
    "thus , @xmath4 is a strictly increasing function with respect to the read length @xmath3 as well as the as exon length @xmath0 . as an example , for a gene of length 2000 bp with a short as exon of length 50 bp , @xmath5 for reads of length 30 bp , @xmath6 for reads of length 50 bp , and @xmath7 for reads of length 100 bp .",
    "currently , technical limitations limit the length of sequenced reads .",
    "these limitations vary by particular platform used for uhts .",
    "the two platforms in widest use are the illumina platform and the abi solid platform . to date ,",
    "the longest read that can be sequenced on the illumina platform is roughly 100 bp , and the most reliable read length is still roughly 70 bp .",
    "paired end reads are an attractive way to decouple the isoform specific gene expression . by performing paired end sequencing ,",
    "reads are produced from both ends of the fragments , but the interior of the fragment remains unsequenced .",
    "this method of sequencing both sides of the fragment increases the number of isoform - informative reads as illustrated in figure [ fig : paired_reads ] .",
    "paired end reads that are mapped to the genes are shown in solid bars above the gene , with read pairs connected by broken lines .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : paired_reads ] , some read pairs ( colored red ) are directly informative on the retention or skipping of the as exon . in addition , some read pairs span both sides of the as exon ( colored green ) . for these read pairs ,",
    "the length of the fragment that they span ( a.k.a . the insert size or insert length ) depends on whether the as exon is used or skipped in the transcript .",
    "if the distribution of the insert size is given , then these read pairs can also provide discriminatory information on the isoforms as shown in figure [ fig : paired_reads ] and developed rigorously through the insert length model in section [ sec : insert_length_model ] . for illustration ,",
    "suppose the experimental protocol selects fragments of sizes around 200 bp for pair - end sequencing .",
    "in such an experiment , if the insert size of a read pair is either 200 bp or 350 bp depending on whether the read pair came from a transcript that included or excluded an exon of length 150 bp , then this read pair is unlikely to have come from a transcript that retained the as exon .",
    "it is easy to see from figure  [ fig : paired_reads ] that the fraction of reads that contain information to distinguish the two isoforms from each other increases not only with the read length and the length of the as exon , but also with the insert size ( when the insert size distribution is a point mass ) . since it is possible to have a much longer insert size than read length , a considerable amount of information can be extracted from the paired end reads for decoupling the isoform - specific gene expression",
    "this concept is developed precisely in the following sections .",
    "the notation in table  [ table : notations ] is used to present the statistical model .    [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     in the simulation , the two isoforms were assumed to have equal abundance .",
    "reads were simulated using different models and parameters described in detail below and estimate isoform abundances as described in section  [ sec : mle ] .",
    "the relative error of estimation was computed based on the empirical relative @xmath8 loss : @xmath9 & = & \\frac{\\sqrt{(1/2-\\hat{\\theta } _ 1)^2+(1/2-\\hat{\\theta}_2)^2}}{\\sqrt{2}/2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10=[\\frac12,\\frac12]$ ] is the true isoform abundance vector , and @xmath11 $ ] is the estimated isoform abundance vector after normalization so that .",
    "each simulation experiment was re - peated @xmath12 times to get the sample mean and standard error of the relative error .      to explore the quality of estimation in the uniform sampling approach",
    ", single end reads with length 30 bp using the uniform sampling model were generated .",
    "five separated experiments were performed to investigate the effect of sample size on the estimation procedure using sample sizes of @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath12 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively . the solid curve in figure  [ fig : simulation](a )",
    "gives the sample mean and standard error of the relative error .",
    "it is clear that relative error decreases as the sample size increases .    to examine whether longer reads",
    "can provide better estimates , all the simulation experiments were repeated with read length @xmath17 bp .",
    "figure  [ fig : simulation](a ) shows the comparison between read lengths of @xmath18  bp and @xmath17  bp . as expected",
    ", @xmath17 bp reads produce smaller error than @xmath18  bp reads .      in real uhts data ,",
    "the read distribution is not uniform . to evaluate",
    "how well the rna - seq methodology performs in this regime , simulations were performed where the positions of reads were sampled from a log - normal distribution . specifically , up to a scalar multiple ,",
    "the true sampling rates @xmath19 are independently and identically distributed random variables which follow  log - normal distribution with mean @xmath20 and standard deviation @xmath21 .",
    "figure  [ fig : simulation](b ) gives the comparison between reads that were sampled from uniform distribution and reads that were sampled from log - normal distribution the figure shows that nonuniform reads produce estimates which appear consistent , albeit with larger error than with uniform reads .",
    "this section investigates whether , in simulation , paired end reads can provide more information than single end reads .",
    "when insert lengths do not have a simple distribution , closed form expressions for the information are difficult to obtain .",
    "simulation studies are thus important tools for analyzing such situations . for this purpose ,",
    "paired end reads of length @xmath18 bp with insert size following a normal distribution with mean @xmath22 bp and standard deviation @xmath23 bp were generated . for a given insert size ,",
    "read pairs were generated using a uniform sampling model .",
    "figure  [ fig : simulation](c ) shows that the paired end reads produce smaller errors than single end reads with the same number of sequenced nucleotides : to make the comparison comparable on the level of total sequenced bases , @xmath24 pairs of paired end reads were used when compared with @xmath25 single end reads .    when the insert size was generated using a uniform distribution , for example , the effective insert size is uniform within @xmath26 bp , similar results were produced [ see figure  [ fig : simulation](d ) ]",
    ". comparing figure  [ fig : simulation](d ) with figure  [ fig : simulation](a ) shows that paired end 30 bp reads produce similarly accurate estimates as 100 bp single end reads , which means that , on average , paired end reads provide more information per nucleotide being sequenced .",
    "we also performed simulations with other settings of parameters , for instance , with read length 70 bp , with true isoform expression vector @xmath27 or with exon lengths ( 500 bp , 200 bp , 500 bp ) .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : others ] . in all these simulations ,",
    "the advantage of paired end sequencing over single end sequencing is obvious for moderate sampling ( @xmath28 ) , as in typical cases for sequencing data .",
    "@cc@     & + ( a)&(b ) +   +",
    "the insert length model presented in this paper is a flexible statistical tool .",
    "the model has the capacity to accommodate oriented reads from illumina data and to model fragment specific biases in the probability of each fragment being sequenced . in  section  [ modelassumptions ]",
    "the model has been derived when the experimental step of fragmentation is assumed to be approximated by a poisson point process , and a transcript is assumed to be retained in the sample in proportion to the fraction of transcripts of its length estimated after sequencing .",
    "these assumptions are at once simplifying and realistic . as experimental protocols improve , it is likely they will better model rna - seq data .    at the current time , several improvements may be made to the model to increase its accuracy .",
    "first , the read sampling rate is undoubtedly nonuniform , as it depends on biochemical properties of the sample and fragmentation process as experimental studies have highlighted ( see @xcite ; @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "this effect becomes more apparent for longer fragments such as those used in paired end library preparation .",
    "explicit models for the sampling rates are difficult to obtain , but doing so is an area of future research .",
    "recent research ( see @xcite ; @xcite ) has shown that the nonuniformity can be modeled and estimated quite well from the data .",
    "it may be possible to combine these models with our approach to improve the estimation performance .",
    "statistical tests of the reproducibility of the nonuniformity of reads shows a consistent sequence specific bias across biological and technical replicates of a  gene .",
    "this effect could be due to bias in rna fragmentation , bias in other biochemical sample preparation steps or boundary effects when a gene of fixed length is fragmented .",
    "the last cause of bias can be modeled using monte carlo simulations of a fixed length mrna sequence subject to a poisson fragmentation process and incorporated into the insert length model .",
    "similarly , the fragmentation and filtering steps have not been explicitly modeled in the insert length model presented here .",
    "rather , the probability mass function of read lengths , what is necessary for defining the model , has been estimated empirically .",
    "improvements to the model could be made by increasing the precision of the estimate of the probability mass function of read lengths , for example , by simulating a fragmentation and filtering process by monte carlo and matching the output of the simulations to the empirical distribution function @xmath29 .",
    "if such modeling were desired , as described in section  [ modelassumptions ] , the effects could be easily incorporated into the insert length model . on the other hand ,",
    "as experimental protocols improve , they may reduce this bias and increase the accuracy of the insert length model as presented in this paper .    in reality ,",
    "sequencing mapping is another step that may affect the analysis .",
    "for instance , some reads can not be mapped because of sequencing errors and some can be mapped to multiple places .",
    "we have not focused on the issue of mapping fidelity because we restrict attention to the reads which did map uniquely .",
    "we are also not taking into account mapping errors which themselves require statistical modeling .",
    "we have chosen not to model these errors partly because some mapping errors are platform - dependent ( i.e. , different sequencing errors tend to be made by the illumina vs. other platforms ) .    in some applications , the parameters of interest to biologists are not the rpkms for isoforms 1 and  2 , but rather the relative expression ratio of both isoforms .",
    "one way to estimate the ratio is to reparameterize the problem with @xmath30 as a first parameter and a second parameter @xmath31 .",
    "the reparameterization will make the model no longer linear in the parameters , therefore harder to solve .",
    "also , the choice of @xmath32 is not straightforward when there are 3 or more isoforms .",
    "an easier way is to estimate @xmath32 indirectly after estimating @xmath30 and  @xmath33 .",
    "we believe that technological improvements that produce longer read lengths will not diminish the relevance of the insert length model . paired end models will be relevant at least until read lengths are comparable to the length of each transcript , and perhaps longer for reasons of cost .",
    "since many transcripts are larger than @xmath34 nucleotides , and longer in some important cases , such a time is unlikely to occur in the next few years .",
    "further , longer insert lengths and reads combined with the insert length model in this paper will aid in discrimination of complex isoforms and estimation of isoform - specific poly - a tail lengths .",
    "thus , we do not foresee any imminent obsolescence of this model .    while the model developed in this paper has the potential for great use and extends current methodology for isoform - specific estimation",
    ", the model assumes that the complete set of isoforms of a gene have been annotated .",
    "de novo discovery of isoforms from a sample is an important and difficult statistical problem that we have not addressed in this paper .",
    "another shortcoming of the model is that in order for statistical inference to be accurate , with the current short read technology , the number of isoforms should be relatively small ( e.g. , 25 ) .",
    "we expect these challenges to motivate methodological development in the field of rna - seq in the coming years .    in conclusion",
    ", this paper has presented a statistical model for rna - seq experiments which provides estimates for isoform specific expression .",
    "finding such estimates is difficult using microarray technology , focusing interest in uhts to address this question .",
    "in addition to modeling , the paper has presented an in - depth statistical analysis . by using the classical statistical concept of minimal sufficiency , a computationally feasible solution to isoform estimation in rna - seq",
    "is provided .",
    "further , statistical analysis quantifies the perceived gain in experimental efficiency from using paired end rather than single end read data to provide reliable isoform specific gene expression estimates . to the best of our knowledge , this is the first statistical model for answering this question .",
