    "<S> _ the last years have seen significant activity to explore the counting noise for purely diffusive scenarios @xcite and to analyze the speedup of receptor binding due to the topological coupling of one- and three - dimensional diffusion for gene regulation in the facilitated diffusion model @xcite . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we fill the apparent gap in the quantitative assessment of the counting noise experienced by biochemical receptors measuring the local concentration of signaling molecules or compounds in the case when an active transport component is present . </S>",
    "<S> this occurs for various signaling particles ( proteins , mrna molecules , vesicles containing signaling molecules , or viruses ) by direct shuttling of these signaling cues by molecular motors or by cytoplasmic drag .    </S>",
    "<S> compared to the purely diffusive signaling considered so far we showed that the counting noise ( the limit to accurate receptor measurement ) for active sensing can become significantly reduced due to active focusing . </S>",
    "<S> the only contributions to the counting noise stem from particles , which are actively transported to within the particle s typical free diffusion distance to the receptor . this reduces the correlation time of the receptor occupancy noise and renders the averaging over a measurement time @xmath5 more efficient . </S>",
    "<S> the importance of active signaling in cellular regulation is well recognized @xcite . in agreement with our results , in biological systems active transport is indeed employed to move larger particles ( e.g. , vesicles or viruses ) with intrinsically small @xmath4 @xcite . as a result even during longer periods of detachment from motors these particles barely move @xcite . the typical experimental values @xmath75 </S>",
    "<S> m @xcite for @xmath76 nm in fact fulfill the requirements of our model for signal focusing . </S>",
    "<S> however , as discussed here also smaller particles such as mrna and proteins experience active motion components @xcite , effecting active focusing for their detection . in living cells </S>",
    "<S> the motor tracks are often not ideally disordered , as assumed here , but biased towards the receptor @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an expected net directional bias towards the receptor , while not impeding signal focusing as long as @xmath60 and @xmath70 @xcite , would enhance the rate of delivery and simultaneously increase the local concentration @xmath77 at the receptor for equal @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> signal focusing is thus inherent to active cellular signaling . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , despite the great technological advance over the past years , molecular motor - powered diagnostic devices have not yet demonstrated a performance beyond the existing passive techniques , but a large superiority is much anticipated @xcite . </S>",
