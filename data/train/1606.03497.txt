    "rectangular diagrams of links , also known as arc - presentations and grid diagrams , have proved to be useful tool in knot theory .",
    "it is shown in  @xcite that any rectangular diagram of the unknot admits a monotonic simplification to a square by elementary moves .",
    "this was used by m.lackenby to prove a polynomial bound on the number of reidemeister moves needed to untangle a planar diagram of the unknot @xcite .",
    "it is tempting to extend the monotonic simplification approach to general knots and links , but certainly it can not be done straightforwardly . typically a non - trivial link type admits more than one rectangular diagram that can not be simplified further by elementary moves without using stabilizations . as shown in @xcite",
    "classifying such diagrams is closely related to classifying legendrian links not admitting a destabilization .",
    "in particular , the main result of  @xcite implies that the finiteness of non - destabilizable legendrian types in each topological link type ( which is the matter of question  61 in  @xcite ) is equivalent to the finiteness of the number of rectangular diagrams that represent each given link type and can not be monotonically simplified .",
    "neither of these has been established so far .",
    "surfaces embedded in @xmath0 , either closed or bounded by a link , have always been one of the key instruments of the knot theory . for studying contact structures and legendrian links",
    "it is useful to consider surfaces that are in special position with respect to the contact structure , so called convex surfaces .",
    "they were introduced by e.giroux in  @xcite and studied also in  @xcite",
    ".    sometimes one can prove the existence of a convex surface having certain combinatorial and algebraic properties for one contact structure and non - existence of such a surface for the other , thus showing there is no contactomorphism between the structures .",
    "this method can be viewed as a generalization of the classical work of bennequin  @xcite where he distinguishes a contact structure in @xmath1 from the standard one by showing that an overtwisted disc exists for the former and does not exist for the latter .",
    "indeed , an overtwisted disc can be viewed as a disc with legendrian boundary and a closed dividing curve .",
    "this method can also be used to distinguish legendrian links by applying the argument to the link complement .",
    "for instance , some legendrian types of iterated torus knots are distinguished in  @xcite by showing that certain slopes on an incompressible torus in the knot complement are realized by dividing curves for one knot and not realized for the other .",
    "note that whereas the problem of algorithmic comparing topological types of two links has been solved ( see @xcite ) no algorithm is known to compare legendrian types of two legendrian links having the same topological type .",
    "examples of pairs of legendrian knots for which the equivalence remains an open question start from six ( ! )  crossings @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we propose a simple combinatorial way to represent compact surfaces in @xmath0 so that the boundary is represented in the rectangular way .",
    "the basic idea of this presentation is not quite new and is implicitly present in the literature . in particular , it can be considered as an instance of kneser ",
    "haken s normal surfaces for triangulations of @xmath2 obtained by the join construction from triangulations of two circles @xmath3 .",
    "we observe in this paper that the discussed combinatorial approach appears to be well adapted to giroux s convex surfaces with legendrian boundary .",
    "in particular , we show that any convex surface with legendrian boundary is equivalent ( in a certain natural sense ) to a one that can be presented in the proposed way .    by using this approach we are going to distinguish some pairs of legendrian knots that are not distinguishable by known methods .",
    "since a rectangular diagram of a surface is a simple combinatorial object , sometimes the non - existence of a diagram with required properties can be established by combinatorial methods .",
    "combined with the representability result of the present paper this may be used to show the non - existence of a convex surface with certain properties in the complement of a legendrian knot .",
    "if a convex surfaces with the same properties is known to exist for another legendrian knot the two legendrian types must be different .",
    "this method is out of the scope of the present paper and will be presented in a subsequent paper .",
    "we also consider here in more detail embedded convex ( in giroux s sense ) annuli in @xmath0 tangent to the contact structure along the boundary .",
    "such annuli are the main building blocks of closed convex surfaces in @xmath0 .",
    "we discuss the following specific question : are the two boundary components of such an annulus always equivalent as legendrian knots ?",
    "this question appears to be highly non - trivial .",
    "an attempt to answer it in the positive was made in manuscript @xcite but a complete proof was not given .",
    "we believe that the answer is actually negative , but our attempt to find a _",
    "simple _ counterexample has failed . in a number of examples that we tried the two boundary components of the annulus appeared to be legendrian equivalent , and a legendrian isotopy",
    "was easily found .",
    "namely , the boundary components were transformed to each other by elementary moves preserving the complexity of the diagram ( exchange moves ) .",
    "we propose here an example of an annulus of the above mentioned type whose boundary components can not be transformed to each other without using stabilizations .",
    "we conjecture that the two legendrian knot types in our example are different .",
    "another use of rectangular diagrams of links comes from their relation to floer homologies .",
    "as c.manolescu , p.ozsvth , and s.sarkar show in @xcite the definition of the knot floer homology for links presented in the grid form can be given in purely combinatorial terms .",
    "up to this writing , we are not aware of any useful interaction between rectangular diagrams of surfaces and algebraic theories",
    ". it would be interesting to see some .",
