    "two of the most basic problems in the theory of packings and coverings is to find the most efficient packing and covering by replicas of a given set @xmath0 in either @xmath1-dimensional euclidean space or @xmath1-dimensional hyperbolic space ( [ fek ] ) .",
    "the term ` most efficient ' is intentionally ambiguous as different circumstances have led to different interpretations .",
    "generally , the density of a packing of euclidean space is defined as the limit of the relative fraction of volume occupied by the bodies in the packing in a ball of radius @xmath4 centered at some point @xmath5 as @xmath4 tends to infinity .",
    "it can be shown that if this limit exists for some point @xmath5 , it exists for every point @xmath5 and has the same value .",
    "a densest packing is then one which maximizes this density .",
    "it is easy to prove the existence of a densest packing in euclidean space .",
    "the density of a covering can be defined similarly and a thinnest covering is one that minimizes the density .",
    "one disadvantage of this definition is that is does not depend on local structure .",
    "for example , if a finite number of bodies in a densest packing are removed , it remains a densest packing .",
    "another disadvantage is that it is not clear that this definition carries over well to hyperbolic space .",
    "for instance , the above limit may exist for every point in hyperbolic space yet take on different values for different points .",
    "for these and other reasons , the authors of [ fkk ] introduced the concept of a completely saturated packing .",
    "for such a packing , it is not possible to replace a finite number of bodies of the packing with a greater number of bodies and still remain a packing .",
    "similarly a completely reduced covering is one in which it is not possible to replace a finite number of bodies of the covering with a smaller number of bodies and still remain a covering .    in [ fkk ] , it was proven that any convex body of euclidean space admits a completely saturated packing ( and more generally any body with the strict nested similarity property ) ( see also [ kup ] ) .",
    "the authors conjectured that completely saturated packings and completely reduced coverings exist for any body @xmath0 in either @xmath1-dimensional euclidean or hyperbolic space . in section 4 , we prove this conjecture .",
    "the proof requires few properties of either euclidean or hyperbolic space and easily extends to a more general setting ( see remark after theorem 2.2 ) .",
    "our techniques are based on those developed in [ bor ] . in that paper ,",
    "a new notion of efficiency was introduced which intuitively applies to a class of measures on a space of packings rather than to individual packings .",
    "such measures are often easier to analyze but at the same time they carry information about the ` average ' properties of some packings . in particular , birkhoff s ergodic theorem ( in the euclidean case ) and recent results due to nevo and stein ( in the hyperbolic case ) show that this new notion ( to be explained in section 3 ) coincides ( in a measure - theoretic way ) to the usual notion of density given by limits of volumes in expanding balls .",
    "this will enable us to construct a peculiar family of bodies @xmath0 that admit tilings of hyperbolic space but such that they also admit completely saturated packings with arbitrarily low density .    * acknowledgments *",
