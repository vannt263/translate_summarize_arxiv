    "introduction of the weak scale supersymmetry ( susy ) into the standard model ( sm ) provides an elegant solution to the naturalness problem . in this scenario susy dictates cancellation of quadratic divergences between the fermionic and bosonic loop contributions to the radiative corrections to the higgs boson mass - squared , which naturally keeps the higgs boson as light as the weak scale against the radiative corrections .",
    "however , it simultaneously causes other problems , including the flavor problem as one of the most serious ones .",
    "that is , while intergenerational mixing among sfermions is not determined unless one puts additional assumptions about their origin , it is often the case that arbitrary flavor - violating soft susy breaking parameters result in unacceptably large rates in the flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) processes . in other words , the mechanism with which the nature avoids such a disaster may be directly linked to the origin of susy breaking , and it is certain that experimentally sensitive probes will provide indispensable clues for it .",
    "another motivation for probing flavor mixing of sfermions , especially left - handed sleptons , comes from recent results of neutrino oscillation experiments  @xcite .",
    "they suggest that the neutrinos have not only tiny masses but also large angle mixing(s ) among them .",
    "this means that the flavor structure of the lepton sector may be totally different from that of the quark sector whose intergenerational mixings are relatively small . in some of supergravity(sugra)-motivated susy models with the seesaw mechanism  @xcite",
    ", large neutrino mixing suggested by the neutrino oscillation experiments may be due to large flavor mixings in neutrino yukawa coupling constant matrix which is responsible for the dirac masses of neutrinos . in that case , via radiative corrections they cause sizable lepton - flavor violating ( lfv ) elements in the mass - squared matrix of the left - handed slepton , which includes the superpartner of neutrino , sneutrino  @xcite . hence probing the intergenerational mixing among sneutrinos",
    "may provide some hints for the origin of the flavor structure of the lepton sector or that of the susy breaking . in this article",
    "we investigate the slepton oscillation phenomenon  @xcite between left - handed sleptons as one of such possible probes with @xmath9 linear colliders ( lc s ) .",
    "the slepton oscillation is a quantum - mechanical phenomenon , analogous to the neutrino oscillation , induced by discrepancy between gauge eigenstates and mass eigenstates .",
    "if there are lfv elements in the slepton mass - squared matrix , gauge eigenstates do not coincide with mass eigenstates .",
    "then a selectron produced at a collider , for example , will change its flavor ( `` oscillate '' ) into a stau with some probability and decay into a tau lepton possibly with other superparticle(s ) . since the probability with which the slepton changes its flavor into other",
    "is determined by the flavor mixing of sleptons , from the relevant cross section of the lfv signal we can obtain information to what extent sleptons of different flavors mix each other .",
    "the slepton oscillation as a means of detecting slepton flavor mixing has a unique advantage over other loop - induced ( charged-)lepton - flavor violating processes  @xcite , such as @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12-@xmath13 conversion in nucleus , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and so on . that is , since real sleptons are produced in the former processes , gim - like suppression is weaker than the latter ones . for instance , in the case",
    "where there is a mixing only between the first and second generations , the cross section @xmath8 of the typical signal of the slepton oscillation that contains @xmath13 and @xmath12 in the final state depends on the masses @xmath16 and @xmath17 of the selectron @xmath18 and the smuon @xmath19 , the mixing angle @xmath20 between them , and the decay width @xmath21 of them as @xmath22 where @xmath23 , and @xmath24 , ( here we have taken the decay width @xmath21 as common between @xmath18 and @xmath19 , for simplicity . ) , while a typical suppression factor in loop - induced processes , such as @xmath10 , is @xmath25 for their amplitudes . in the minimal sugra scenario",
    "@xcite with reasonable parameters typical decay width of slepton is @xmath26 gev , it follows that the gim suppression in the slepton oscillation is weaker for small @xmath27 . whether this directly means that the slepton oscillation is really a sensitive probe or not is of course non - trivial and needs further investigation .",
    "we need to take into account competition against the back ground ( bg ) processes , effects of cuts to distinguish the signal out of the bg s , and so on .",
    "nevertheless , it has been reported in the literature  @xcite that the slepton oscillation is indeed a powerful tool once the sleptons are found at future collider experiments .    the sensitivity of the slepton oscillation as a probe of slepton flavor mixing depends on the generations whose mixing is to be probed . comparing the sensitivity of the slepton oscillation studied in the literature  @xcite with the current experimental bounds for charged - lepton flavor violating processes",
    ", @xmath28 at least for their sample parameters the slepton oscillation is indeed a powerful tool that may go beyond these bounds .",
    "however , comparing them with the reach of _ future _ experiments , it is not necessarily so . for the mixing between the first and second generations",
    "a proposed experiment at psi  @xcite is so sensitive that it will probe @xmath10 decay to @xmath29 branching ratio .",
    "if it is carried out , the sensitivity of it will reach far beyond that of the slepton oscillation of the left - handed sleptons between the first and second generations , as discussed later in this article .",
    "( it can probe at most the parameter region that corresponds to @xmath10 branching ratio of order of @xmath30 for our sample parameters . ) on the other hand , in the case of 13-mixing and 23-mixing ,- th and @xmath31-th generations as @xmath32-mixing , for brevity .",
    "] not only the current bounds ( [ taumugamma ] ) and ( [ tauegamma ] ) but also near future searches of these rare decay processes are not so powerful as in the 12-mixing case . while @xmath14 searches at the @xmath33 factories in kek or slac may improve the bound to the level of @xmath34 , according to the result of ref .",
    "@xcite the @xmath35 reach of lc in probing the left - handed slepton mixing between the second and third generations will go far beyond the reach of these near future @xmath14 searches for their sample parameters . also , in the study of the slepton oscillation between the right - handed sleptons in ref .  @xcite it is reported that some of the lfv processes with tau lepton(s ) in the final state",
    "could have sizable cross sections at future linear collider experiments .",
    "hence the situation that the slepton oscillation can be the most valuable is in the case where we probe slepton flavor mixing involving the third generation .    in this article",

    "we mainly focus on probing the 13-mixing of left - handed sleptons , which seems to be most unknown in neutrino mixing . in probing it",
    "we also have an advantage that it may be more economically probed in an electron collider rather than in a muon collider with the same energy and the same luminosity , since in the former the @xmath2-channel pair production of the sleptons in the first generation , which are relevant to the 13-mixing , is possible in addition to that via @xmath3-channel , if kinematically allowed . utilizing @xmath4 signal at @xmath1 linear collider with integrated luminosity @xmath5",

    "main advantage of this signal is that it is almost free from sm bg s , since the final state contains 4 jets and two charged leptons of different flavors  @xcite .",

    "with presence of finite @xmath117 , however , the stau masses are given by @xmath118 and @xmath119 becomes more degenerate in the mass with @xmath105 and as a consequence the mixing between @xmath105 and @xmath119 is enhanced .",
    "this enhancement is maximized when @xmath120 is satisfied and this corresponds to @xmath121gev for our sample parameter set of @xmath103 .    in the figures  [ fig : sigmatanbeta03 ] and [ fig : sigmatanbeta10 ] we can see that the cross sections of @xmath90 are several times as large as those of @xmath91 .",
    "this comes from the fact that in our sample parameter destructive interference between @xmath3- and @xmath2-channel occurs in charged slepton pair production , while in sneutrino pair production they constructively contribute to the cross section  @xcite .    in the following subsections",
