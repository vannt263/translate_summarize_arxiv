    "ever since the fundamental work of s. novikov and d. quillen @xcite,@xcite the theory of formal groups is firmly rooted in stable homotopy theory . in particular , the simple geometric structure of the moduli space of formal groups has been a constant source of inspiration .",
    "this moduli space is stratified according to the height of the formal group . for many spaces",
    "@xmath0 , @xmath1 can canonically be considered as a flat sheaf on the moduli space and the stratification defines a resolution of @xmath1 ( the cousin - complex ) which is well - known to be the chromatic resolution of @xmath1 and which is a central tool in the actual computation of the stable homotopy of @xmath0 .",
    "+ in fact , much deeper homotopy theoretic results have been suggested by this point of view and we mention two of them .",
    "all thick subcategories of the derived category of sheaves on the moduli space are rather easily determined by using the above stratification .",
    "this simple structure persists to determine all the thick subcategories of the category of finite spectra , see @xcite , theorem 3.4.3 .",
    "similarly , any coherent sheaf on the moduli space can be reconstructed from its restriction to the various strata ( corresponding roughly to @xmath2- localisation in stable homotopy ) .",
    "again , this result persists to homotopy theory as the chromatic convergence theorem , @xcite , theorem 7.5.7 .",
    "+ in conclusion , the derived category of sheaves on the moduli space of formal groups has turned out to be an excellent algebraic approximation to the homotopy category of ( finite ) spectra .",
    "+ it may thus seem a little surprising that the central notion of a stack of formal groups has not yet been given a solid foundation , and the chief purpose of this paper is to do so .",
    "we hasten to point out to the knowledgeable reader that to this end there is something to do beyond just copying existing literature as already the following simple remark demonstrates . defining ( as usual ) a formal group to be a group structure on the formal affine line , one",
    "is guaranteed to _ not _ obtain a stack just because the formal affine line in general does admit non - trivial flat forms .",
    "we thus spend some effort in the construction of the stack of formal groups and the derivation of its basic properties",
    ". this may also be useful in the multiplicative ring spectrum project of p. goerss and m. hopkins , c.f .",
    "@xcite . + in fact",
    ", we start out more generally by making precise the relation between flat hopf algebroids and a certain class of stacks .",
    "roughly , the datum of a flat hopf algebroid is equivalent to the datum of the stack with a specific presentation .",
    "now , the category of comodules of the flat hopf algebroid only depends on the stack .",
    "we will demonstrate the gain in conceptual clarity provided by this point of view by reconsidering the following remarkable recent result of m. hovey and n. strickland . for two landweber exact @xmath3-algebras @xmath4 and @xmath5 of the same height the categories of comodules of the flat hopf algebroids @xmath6 and @xmath7 are equivalent . as an immediate consequence one obtains the computationally important change - of - rings isomorphism @xmath8 which had been established previously by g. laures @xcite , 4.3.3 .",
    "+ from our point of view , this result has the following simple explanation .",
    "let @xmath9 be the stack associated with @xmath10 and @xmath11 the canonical map .",
    "as we will explain , @xmath9 is closely related to the stack of formal groups and is thus stratified by closed substacks @xmath12 we will show that the induced hopf algebroid @xmath13 is simply a presentation of the _",
    "stack_-theoretic image of @xmath14 and that @xmath4 being landweber exact of height @xmath15 implies that this image is @xmath16 .",
    "we conclude that @xmath13 and @xmath17 are presentations of _ the same _ stack which implies the result of @xcite but more is true : the comodule categories under consideration are in fact equivalent as _ tensor _ abelian categories ( @xcite treats their structure of abelian categories only ) and we easily generalise the above proof to apply to all the stacks @xmath18 ( with @xmath19 allowed ) .",
    "+ returning to the stack of formal groups , we show that the stack associated with @xmath20 is closely related to this stack .",
    "note , however , that this requires an _ a priori _ construction of the stack of formal groups , the problem being the following .",
    "the objects of a stack associated with a flat hopf algebroid are only _ flat locally _ given in terms of the hopf algebroid and it is in general difficult to decide what additional objects the stack contains .",
    "given the central role of the stack of formal groups in stable homotopy theory , we believe that it is important to have a genuinely geometric understanding of it rather than just as the stack associated to some hopf algebroid , so we solve this problem here .",
    "+ finally , we point out that for many stacks appearing in algebraic topology it is surprisingly easy to compute their picard groups . for example , the picard group of the stack of formal groups is isomorphic to @xmath21 , generated by the canonical line bundle . in keeping with the philosophy that the stack of formal groups provides a good algebraic approximation to stable homotopy theory one may try to use this in the current investigations of the picard groups of various categories of spectra ( e.g. @xcite ) and we hope to return to this in the future . + we review the individual sections in more detail . in section [ prelim ]",
    "we review the stack theoretic notions we will have to use in the following . in section [ stacksandhopf ] we give the relation between flat hopf algebroids and algebraic stacks . in section [ morphisms ]",
    "we collect a number of technical results on algebraic stacks centring around the problem to relate the properties of a morphism between algebraic stacks with properties of the functors it induces on the categories of quasi - coherent sheaves .",
    "the main result is proved in section [ ringchange ] . in the final section [ stackformalgroups ]",
    "we construct the stack of formal groups and show that the algebraic stack associated with the flat hopf algebroid @xmath20 is the stack of ( one dimensional , commutative , connected , formally smooth ) formal groups together with a trivialization of the canonical line bundle and explain its basic geometric properties .",
    "+ to conclude the introduction we would like to acknowledge the influence of m. hopkins on the present circle of ideas .",
    "we understand that he was the first to insist that numerous results on ( comodules over ) flat hopf algebroids should be understood from a geometric , i.e. stack theoretic , point of view , c.f .",
    "+    i would like to thank e. pribble for making a copy of @xcite available to me , j. heinloth , j. hornbostel , m. hovey , g. kings and n. strickland for useful conversation and the referee for suggesting substantial improvements of the exposition .",

    "it is clear that @xmath576 is in fact a substack and in particular is itself an @xmath62-stack over @xmath566 which we will call the stack of formal groups .",
    "we will see in a minute that @xmath0 ( unlike @xmath575 ) is in fact an algebraic stack .",
    "+ our first task will be to determine what formal schemes occur in the fibre category @xmath578 for a given ring @xmath4 .",

    "[ grading ] 1 ) we explain how the grading of @xmath104 fits into the above result . the stack @xmath9 carries a @xmath614-action given on points by @xmath637 this action can be lifted to the hopf algebroid @xmath638 as in @xcite , example 2.97 and thus determines a grading of the flat hopf algebroid @xmath20 . as observed in _",

    "the stacks labeled @xmath412 ( @xmath19 ) in section [ ringchange ] are the preimages of @xmath665 under @xmath666 .",
    "+ for any @xmath19 we define the ( non - closed ) substack @xmath667 with complement @xmath668 . + if @xmath669 is a landweber exact @xmath104-algebra which has height @xmath19 at every prime as in @xcite , section 7 then the stack theoretic image of @xmath670 is the preimage of @xmath671 under @xmath672 which we will write as @xmath673 .",
    "this can be checked as in section [ ringchange ] and shows that the equivalences of comodule categories proved in _",
