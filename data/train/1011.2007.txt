    "the three - body problem in newtonian gravity belongs among classical problems in astronomy and physics ( e.g , @xcite ) . in 1765 , euler found a collinear solution for the restricted three - body problem , where one of three bodies is a test mass .",
    "soon after , his solution was extended for a general three - body problem by lagrange , who also found an equilateral triangle solution in 1772 .",
    "now , the solutions for the restricted three - body problem are called lagrange points @xmath3 and @xmath4 , which are described in textbooks of classical mechanics @xcite .",
    "soho ( solar and heliospheric observatory ) and wmap ( wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ) launched by nasa are in operation at the sun - earth @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "lisa ( laser interferometer space antenna ) pathfinder is planned to go to @xmath0 .",
    "lagrange points have recently attracted renewed interests for relativistic astrophysics @xcite , where they have discussed the gravitational radiation reaction on @xmath5 and @xmath4 analytically @xcite and by numerical methods @xcite .    as a pioneering work ,",
    "nordtvedt pointed out that the location of the triangular points is very sensitive to the ratio of the gravitational mass to the inertial one @xcite .",
    "along this course , it is interesting as a gravity experiment to discuss the three - body coupling terms at the post - newtonian order , because some of the terms are proportional to a product of three masses as @xmath6 .",
    "such a term appears only for relativistic three ( or more ) body systems : for a relativistic binary with two masses @xmath7 and @xmath8 , there exist @xmath9 and @xmath10 without such a three - mass product . for a newtonian three - body system",
    ", we have only the two - body coupling terms proportional to @xmath11 , @xmath12 or @xmath13 .",
    "the relativistic perihelion advance of mercury is detected only after much larger shifts due to newtonian perturbations by other planets such as the venus and jupiter are taken into account in the astrometric data analysis . in this sense ,",
    "effects by the three body coupling are worthy to investigate .",
    "nevertheless , most of post - newtonian works have focused on either compact binaries because of our interest in gravitational waves astronomy or n - body equation of motion ( and coordinate systems ) in the weak field such as the solar system ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "actually , future space astrometric missions such as gaia @xcite require a general relativistic modeling of the solar system within the accuracy of a micro arc - second @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a binary plus a third body have been discussed also for perturbations of gravitational waves induced by the third body @xcite .",
    "after efforts to find a general solution , poincare proved that it is impossible to describe all the solutions to the three - body problem even for the @xmath14 potential .",
    "namely , we can not analytically obtain all the solutions .",
    "nevertheless , the number of new solutions is increasing @xcite .",
    "therefore , the three - body problem still remains an open issue even for newton gravity .",
    "the theory of general relativity is currently the most successful gravitational theory describing the nature of space and time .",
    "hence , it is important to take account of general relativistic effects on three - body configurations .",
    "the figure - eight configuration that was found decades ago @xcite has been recently studied at the first post - newtonian @xcite and also the second post - newtonian orders @xcite . according to their numerical investigations ,",
    "the solution remains true with a slight change in the figure - eight shape because of relativistic effects .    on the other hand , the post - newtonian collinear configuration obtained in the previous paper @xcite may offer a useful toy model for relativistic three - body interactions , because it is tractable by hand without numerical simulations",
    "this solution is a relativistic extension of _ euler s collinear one _ , where three bodies move around the common center of mass with the same orbital period and always line up .",
    "in fact , their formulation leads to a seventh - order equation determining the distance ratio among masses @xcite . here",
    ", it should be noted that only positive roots are acceptable , because the distance ratio must be positive .",
    "properties of the master equation have not been known yet .",
    "how many positive roots for it are there ? the main purpose of this paper is to _ analytically _ investigate the number of the positive roots . in particular",
    ", we shall prove the uniqueness of the configuration for given system parameters ( the masses and the end - to - end length ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we briefly summarize formulations for collinear solutions at the newtonian and post - newtonian orders .",
    "we discuss positive roots for the seventh - order equation for determining the distance ratio in section iii . in section iv",
    ", we show the uniqueness of the configuration for given system parameters ( the masses and the end - to - end length ) .",
    "we also compare the angular velocity of the post - newtonian collinear configuration with that for the newtonian one .",
    "section v is devoted to the conclusion .",
    "we provide some detailed calculations regarding the angular velocity of collinear configurations in the appendix .    throughout this paper , we take the units of @xmath15 .",
    "let us begin by summarizing the derivation of the euler s collinear solution for the circular three - body problem in newton gravity .",
    "we consider euler s solution , for which each mass moves around their common center of mass denoted as @xmath16 with a constant angular velocity @xmath17 .",
    "hence , it is convenient to use the corotating frame with the same angular velocity @xmath17 .",
    "we choose an orbital plane normal to the total angular momentum as the @xmath18 plane in such a corotating frame .",
    "we locate all the three bodies on a single line , along which we take the @xmath19-coordinate .",
    "the location of each mass @xmath20 @xmath21 is written as @xmath22 . without loss of generality , we assume @xmath23 .",
    "let @xmath24 define the relative position of each mass with respective to the center of mass @xmath25 , namely @xmath26 ( @xmath27 unless @xmath28 ) .",
    "we choose @xmath29 between @xmath7 and @xmath30 .",
    "we thus have @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "it is convenient to define a ratio as @xmath34 , which is an important variable in the following formulation .",
    "then we have @xmath35 .",
    "the equation of motion becomes @xmath36 where we define @xmath37    first , we subtract eq .",
    "( @xmath38 ) from eq .",
    "( @xmath39 ) and eq .",
    "( @xmath40 ) from eq .",
    "( @xmath38 ) and use @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "such a subtraction procedure will be useful also at the post - newtonian order , because we can avoid directly using the post - newtonian center of mass @xcite .",
    "next , we compute a ratio between them to delete @xmath43 . hence a fifth - order equation is obtained as @xmath44 now we have a condition as @xmath45 .",
    "descartes rule of signs ( e.g. , @xcite ) states that the number of positive roots either equals that of sign changes in coefficients of a polynomial or less than it by a multiple of two .",
    "according to this rule , eq .",
    "( @xmath46 ) has only the positive root @xmath45 , though such a fifth - order equation can not be solved in algebraic manners as shown by galois ( e.g. , @xcite ) . after obtaining @xmath47",
    ", one can substitute it into a difference , for instance between eqs .",
    "( @xmath39 ) and ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "hence we get @xmath17 .    in order to include the dominant part of general relativistic effects , we take account of the terms at the first post - newtonian order .",

    "exactly three positions of a third body are true even at the post - newtonian order .",
    "they are relativistic counterparts of the newtonian lagrange points @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "it was shown also that , for the same masses and full length , the angular velocity of the post - newtonian collinear configuration is smaller than that for the newtonian case . provided that the masses and angular rate are fixed , the relativistic length @xmath161 is shorter than the newtonian one .",
    "our way of discussion seems to work at the second ( and higher ) post - newtonian orders , because the slow motion approximation is a key in the above proof .",
    "therefore , the uniqueness of collinear configurations for a three - body system may be true even at higher orders , precisely speaking , if the configuration has the newtonian limit .",
    "it is an open question whether _ fully _ general relativistic systems admit a particular solution that can appear only for a fast motion case and thus has no newtonian limit .",

    "( @xmath165 ) is always positive .",
    "what we have to do is to investigate the sign of the numerator for the r.h.s . of eq .",

    ", we have a symmetry between @xmath171 , @xmath172 , @xmath173 and @xmath174 .",
    "therefore , it is sufficient to examine @xmath175 , @xmath176 , @xmath177 , @xmath178 and @xmath179 .    first , let us show @xmath180 . the nontrivial factor in eq .",
    "( [ a9 ] ) turns out to be positive by noting the following relation as @xmath181 where we used @xmath182 , @xmath183 , @xmath184 .",

    "( [ a8 ] ) is factored as @xmath186 one can show that the latter three terms are positive , since @xmath187 hence , the second factor in eq . ( [ a8 - 1 ] ) is always positive , which leads to @xmath188 , and also @xmath189 .",
    "next , we examine @xmath177 . by recovering @xmath76 to delete @xmath69 , the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ a7 ] ) is factored as @xmath190 a key thing is a positive as @xmath191 which immediately leads to @xmath192 , and also @xmath193 .",

    "hence , we show @xmath196 , and also @xmath197 .",
    "also for @xmath179 , it is factored as @xmath198 one can find the following rather tricky manipulation as @xmath199 - \\nu_3 - 6\\nu_2\\nu_3 \\notag\\\\ & > & 3 + 5\\nu_2(1 - \\nu_2 - \\nu_3 ) - \\nu_3 - 6\\nu_2\\nu_3 \\notag\\\\ & > & \\frac12,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we used @xmath200 and @xmath201 .",
