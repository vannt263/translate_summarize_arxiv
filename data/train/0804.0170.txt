    "andreev reflection experiments across normal conductor ( n ) and superconductor ( sc ) junctions represent an useful technique to explore various interesting physical properties like spin polarization of ferromagnets , gap anisotropy of superconductors , etc .",
    "several mechanisms are involved in current transport into superconductor , when a bias voltage v is applied across a clean n / sc point contact .",
    "the electrons can pass from n into sc as quasielectrons or holes at voltages higher than the superconducting gap @xmath8 , which relax into the cooper - pair condensate over the charge relaxation distance .",
    "however , for voltages lower than @xmath8 no quasiparticle states are available in the superconductor . instead",
    ", the current is converted directly into a supercurrent of cooper pairs , consisting of two electrons of charge @xmath9 with opposite spin .",
    "this is accomplished by the reflection of a hole back into the metal , a process first described by andreev@xcite .",
    "when a normal metal is replaced by a ferromagnetic metal ( fm ) , a suppression of andreev reflection ( ar ) occurs . for a fm / sc contact the process involves a coherent interspin - subband transfer which is sensitive to the relative electronic spin density of states at fermi energy ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "if the spin polarization @xmath11 is zero , the ar is not hindered .",
    "however , if @xmath11 amounts to 100@xmath5 near @xmath10 , there are no spin - down states available in the metal for the reflected hole and ar is completely suppressed@xcite .",
    "hence , determination of @xmath11 for a fm can be carried out by measuring the suppression of ar .",
    "+ the spin polarization @xmath11 of a 3-d transition metal fm depends on its electronic structure containing narrow @xmath12-band and broad @xmath13-bands at @xmath10 .",
    "co is an interesting 3-d metal with the curie temperature amounting to 1388  k@xcite .",
    "spin - resolved photoelectron spectroscopy measurements showed that co has short range ferromagnetic order above the curie temperature@xcite .",
    "the first experiment of spin - polarized transport and tunneling in co was performed by tedro and meservey where @xmath11 was reported to be 34@xmath5 at 0.4  k @xcite .",
    "measurement of @xmath11 by ar spectroscopy is limited by the @xmath14 of the used sc .",
    "soulen @xmath15 reported @xmath11 = 42@xmath5 for co by ar measurements using a nb tip@xcite .",
    "since the superconducting transition temperature ( @xmath14 ) for nb is around 9  k , @xmath11 was determined only below that temperature .",
    "the resolution of ar spectroscopy strongly depends on the temperature @xmath16 due to the broadening of carrier distribution by k@xmath17 t around the fermi level .",
    "observation of distinct spectral features requires the condition k@xmath17",
    "t @xmath18 k@xmath17@xmath19 ( @xmath19 = debye temperature ) i.e. measurements should be taken at temperatures considerably lower than the debye temperature@xcite . in order to determine @xmath11 at higher temperature , the necessity of using high - t@xmath20 sc as a superconducting electrode for ar measurements is necessary .",
    "a dip in differential conductance of a ferromagnet / high - t@xmath20 superconductor junction has been reported as a consequence of suppressed ar@xcite .",
    "this indicates that the detection of @xmath21 by ar measurements across fm / high - t@xmath20 superconductor junction should be possible .",
    "+ here , we report on ar measurements on co / ybco with junction area of 1 @xmath4 m diameter at 5 - 100  k. our analysis and modelling of the sub - gap conductivity variation yields @xmath21 around 34@xmath5 for co in the temperature range from 5 to 70  k. to the best of our knowledge , this is the first time that the spin polarization of co has been probed by andreev reflection spectroscopy at such elevated temperatures , up to 70  k. +",
    "the investigated ybco films have been grown on r - plane oriented sapphire ( al@xmath1o@xmath2 ) substrates with underlying ceo@xmath1 buffer layer by pulsed laser deposition ( pld ) technique@xcite.in general , a large oxygen partial pressure during the pld growth of ybco on sapphire amounting to 0.16 mbar is required to maintain the stoichiometry of ybco and to retain its superconductivity .",
    "the deposited thin ybco films are ( 001 ) axis oriented , orthorhombic in structure and their thickness amounts to 230 @xmath22 30 nm in each sample .",
    "the co / ybco heterostructure has been prepared by thermal evaporation of co on ybco under a vacuum level of 3 x 10@xmath23 mbar .",
    "thickness of the co film on ybco is around 11 nm .",
    "+ the crystalline quality of the samples has been investigated by powder x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) measurements before and after deposition of co using the cu - k@xmath24 line ( @xmath25= 0.15406 nm ) .",
    "the xrd spectra of the investigated co / ybco heterostructures in fig .  1 confirm the ( 001)-axis orientation of ybco on r - sapphire .",
    "the critical current density ( @xmath26 ) determines the quality of a superconductor .",
    "it is essential to probe the superconductivity of ybco before and after deposition of co. we used an inductive method developed to determine @xmath26 of ybco films on single - sided or double - sided sapphire substrates@xcite .",
    "the magnetic shielding of the ybco film is measured in dependence of temperature and ac current in the measuring coil .",
    "the measurement is carried out by placing the sample into liquid nitrogen to work below ybco superconduction transition temperature(@xmath14 ) amounting to 92 k. we have found that the critical current density for ybco amounts to @xmath26 = 3 x 10@xmath6 a/@xmath7 . the @xmath26 measurements on co / ybco heterostructures reveal that the critical current density of ybco remains unchanged .",
    "this result proves that the superconductivity of ybco is preserved after deposition of co. +      a sin insulating layer of 50 nm thickness has been deposited on the ybco film by sputtering deposition method .",
    "a single hole of 1 @xmath4 m diameter has been created in sin by focused ion beam ( fib ) etching .",
    "the diameter was 1 @xmath4 m at the top of the hole and at the bottom the diameter was much less .",
    "basically , the hole has a conical shape @xcite .",
    "hence , the diameter at co / ybco contact must be much less than 1 @xmath4 m .",
    "finally , co films have been deposited on sin by thermal evaporation .",
    "hence , the co film on sin will be about 61 nm thick in the region of the hole .",
    "it is known that this kind of hole creation by fib usually get affected by gallium ( ga ) ion contamination .",
    "we have also faced the similar problems and for affected contacts the contact resistance used to be very high .",
    "however , we have taken the sample with best contact which has lowest resistance and carried out the ar measurement .",
    "the normal contact resistance has been around 16 kohm .",
    "we have calculated the approximate contact area using the formula g@xmath27",
    "@xmath28 e@xmath29/@xmath30 k@xmath31 @xmath32 where k@xmath33 is the fermi wave vector and the effective contact area ( @xmath32 ) amounts to 0.65 nm@xmath29 .",
    "the measuring electrodes are fabricated by silver paste on the contact pads .",
    "two contacts are made on co pads , while the other two contacts are made on ybco pads ( fig .",
    "we have carried out current(@xmath34 ) vs voltage(@xmath35 ) measurements in four - probe geometry on co / ybco samples with junction area of 1 @xmath4 m diameter from 5 to 100  k. the conductivity has been calculated by numerical differentiation of the @xmath34 vs. @xmath35 data .",
    "the temperature dependent normalized conductivity data are shown in fig .  3 .",
    "we have observed clear andreev reflection and modelled the data up to 70  k for co / ybco samples . above 70",
    "k it was not possible to model the data because of large background noise .",
    "we base our analysis and modelling the conductivity data on the pioneering work by blonder - tinkham - klapwijk ( btk ) for ar in the ballistic regime @xcite .",
    "the btk formula has already been used for a much larger contact area of 1x1 mm@xmath29 in ga@xmath36mn@xmath37as / ga junctions@xcite .",
    "our present co / ybco samples have much smaller contact area in the 1 @xmath4m@xmath29 range .",
    "the btk formula is valid for normal metal/@xmath38-wave superconductor junction .",
    "however , in the present investigation , the high - t@xmath20 @xmath39-wave superconductor ybco has been used@xcite . in contrast to @xmath38-wave superconductor , here",
    "the tunneling spectra strongly depend on the tunneling direction with respect to the crystallographic axis .",
    "a tunneling theory for normal metal - insulator-@xmath39-wave superconductor has been reported by tanaka and kashiwaya @xcite .",
    "it has been shown by barash @xmath40 @xcite that the character of the change in the order parameter at the boundary of a @xmath39-wave superconductor with a normal metal or insulator does not differ much from a junction with a @xmath38-wave superconductor when the orientation of the normal to the @xmath39-wave superconductor is along the principal crystallographic axes . because the investigated co films are deposited along the ( 001 ) direction , the current direction across the junction is predominantly in ( 001 ) direction .",
    "hence , we used the btk formulas ( eq .  1 and 2 ) for energy ( @xmath41 ) @xmath42 @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "@xmath44[1+a(e)-b(e)]de\\ ] ] @xmath45    here , @xmath46 denotes the current across the junction , @xmath47 the electronic charge , @xmath48 the density of states , @xmath49 the fermi velocity , @xmath50 the junction cross sectional area , f@xmath51 the fermi distribution function , @xmath35 the applied voltage , @xmath52 the probability of andreev reflection and @xmath53 the probability of normal reflection .",
    "we have followed strijkers @xmath15@xcite for expressions of @xmath52 and @xmath53 in out of sub - gap region ( @xmath54 ) which are given below .",
    "@xmath55    since co is a 3-d transition metal ferromagnet , the carrier spin polarization should also be an important parameter to be carefully considered . incorporating both @xmath56 and @xmath21 we modified the btk formula from strijkers @xmath15 ( see eq .",
    "4 )    @xmath57    with @xmath58 being the unpolarized current and @xmath59 the polarized current across the junction . here",
    ", we have also used separate expression for normal reflection probability ( @xmath60 ) of polarized current at @xmath54 as shown below .",
    "@xmath61    the probability of andreev reflection ( @xmath62 ) for polarized current is zero . the expressions of @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66,@xmath67 and @xmath68 can be found in the mentioned reference @xcite . + in order to take into account the interface scattering and finite life time effects of quasi particles , we also considered the additional broadening parameter @xmath69(@xmath70 ) .",
    "this phenomenological idea has been employed by several authors before@xcite .",
    "we have used this modified btk formula including a superconducting gap ( @xmath71 ) , barrier strength ( @xmath56 ) , spin polarization ( @xmath21 ) and broadening parameter(@xmath69 ) to model the observed data of sub - gap conductivity variation .",
    "the modelled data are shown in fig .",
    "3 and they agree with the experimental data in the sub - gap region .",
    "the value of fitting parameters are displayed in the legends .",
    "the influence of proximity effect has been neglected in the present model . because , the existence of superconducting proximity layer in a material depends on the formation of cooper pairs and ferromagnetic material ( like co ) breaks the cooper pairs @xcite .",
    "if cooper pairs can not be formed , proximity layer will not exist .",
    "fig .  4 shows the plots of ar measurements and fits for co / ybco at all measured temperatures .",
    "we have noticed asymmetry in the conductance plots and it is more at higher temperature . although the d - wave parameter has been neglected because of contact geometry ( 001 ) , the d - wave features are still present .",
    "the asymmetry in conductance and peaks seen above t@xmath20 region are basically d - wave features .",
    "the present contact dimension amounts to 1 @xmath4m@xmath29 at the top of the hole .",
    "hence , the current direction may have some components in x - y direction also . since , delta is not same in x , y and z direction for ybco , that anisotropy will be experienced by the current .",
    "actually , it was reported that @xmath43 along ( 110 ) = 27 mev , @xmath43 along ( 100 ) = 28 - 29 mev and @xmath43 along ( 001 ) = 19 mev for ybco @xcite.this can be a possible explanation for observed asymmetry in the conductance .",
    "the fits at 50 k , 60 k , and 70 k are not following exactly the experimental data because the effect of non - ohmicity at higher energy and higher temperature is not included into our model .",
    "this non - ohmicity has occured from the temperature effect and possibly due to interface inhomogeneity .",
    "in addition , we can not completely ignore the effect of crossing the critical current locally . because , there are dips in conductance at 50 , 60 , 70k , which are very pronounced and the fit can not follow them .",
    "when the current at any area of the n / sc contact region is locally higher than the critical current , that part of the contact transforms into normal state . as a result , an unusual peak in resistance or a dip in conductance measurement",
    "is observed . for the present case ,",
    "the dips are seen at around 25 mev , where @xmath43 at those temperatures are in between 19 to 14 mev .",
    "+ modelled ar data of co / ybco junctions with contact area of 1 @xmath4 m diameter according to modified btk theory , agree well with the experimental data ( fig .",
    "the values of fitting parameter are displayed in fig .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath21 at 10 - 70  k lies around 34@xmath5 for co and similar to that determined at 0.4  k by tunneling measurements@xcite .",
    "the dependence of fitting parameters on temperature is displayed in fig .",
    "it is noticed that the magnitude of @xmath21 does not depend on temperature up to 70  k. this is expected because the curie temperature of co is 1388  k@xcite .",
    "this trend is similar to that obtained for fe by mukhopadhyay @xmath15@xcite .",
    "we found that @xmath56 increases with temperature .",
    "we point out that @xmath56 does not only describe the interface potential for the co / ybco interface .",
    "in reality , @xmath56 is defined by @xmath72 where @xmath72 = @xmath73 + @xmath74 . here , @xmath75 is the ratio of fermi velocities of normal metal and superconductor and @xmath73 defines the imperfectness of the interface@xcite .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath73 is not known exactly . for a ferromagnetic metal and superconductor interface",
    ", @xmath75 depends on the different velocities in the up and down spin band of the ferromagnet .",
    "the present temperature range of ar measurement is much below the ferromagnetic transition temperature of co. thus , the ferromagnetic spin fluctuation and the decrease in exchange splitting with temperature may not be of much significance for co. hence , the change of @xmath56 up to 70  k is presumably dependent on only @xmath73 .",
    "we note that @xmath76 increases with temperature and peaks when the the sample temperature approaches @xmath14 .",
    "the life time of quasiparticles ( @xmath77 ) is incorporated into this broadening parameter @xmath76 = @xmath78@xcite .",
    "it implies that the quasiparticle scattering rate increases with temperature and attains maximum value close to @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath71 decreases with temperature and is almost nearly equal to zero near @xmath14 .",
    "although ybco is a high - t@xmath20 superconductor , the temperature dependence of @xmath71 follows bcs theory .",
    "a similar temperature dependence of @xmath71 in bi@xmath1sr@xmath1cacu@xmath1o@xmath79 has been reported by s. i. vedeneev @xmath15@xcite . in fig .  6",
    "the spin polarization @xmath21 has been plotted against @xmath56 .",
    "the experimental points have been fitted with a straight line and extrapolated up to @xmath56 = 0 . as a result , we have found the value of @xmath21 as around 33@xmath5 at @xmath56 = 0 .",
    "+ we have successfully modelled ar data for co / ybco samples with small interface area .",
    "theoretical calculations reported the exchange splitting for co around 1.39 ev , density of states at e@xmath80@xmath81 n(e@xmath80 @xmath81 ) = 4.29 per electrons / atom ry spin and density of states at e@xmath80@xmath82 n(e@xmath80 @xmath82)= 11.32 per electrons / atom ry spin@xcite .",
    "this indicates a theoretical value of spin polarization around 45@xmath5 .",
