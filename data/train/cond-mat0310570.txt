    "quantum electrodynamics of atoms within optical cavities is a well understood problem which has produced many results of both fundamental and practical interest@xcite .",
    "the current capability of using semiconductors technology to grow quantum dots ( qd ) embedded in microcavities seems very promising to reproduce and control that properties in a solid - state system that could be integrated in electronic or optical devices .",
    "the essential physics of such system is a strong coupling between the qd excitations and the photonic cavity modes as well as the possibility of interaction with the external world through the pumping of the system and the subsequent emission of light .",
    "the main goal is the control of the emitted light and its quantum properties being possible to built up high efficiency light emitting diodes , low threshold lasers and single photon sources .",
    "we concentrate here in a problem , no far from the actual situation in several experiments @xcite , in which a single qd is embedded in a pillar or disk microcavity confining photons in the three spatial directions .",
    "the system is pumped either by electrically injecting electrons and holes which tunnel into the qd@xcite , or by pumping excitons in the qd @xcite .",
    "light emission form the system takes place both by cavity mode decay or by spontaneous emission of leaky modes .",
    "all these pumping and emission mechanisms introduce decoherence affecting the quantum properties of the system .",
    "the lowest energy excitation of a neutral qd is an electron - hole pair , usually labelled as exciton . due to the fermionic character of its components",
    ", this exciton state can only be singly occupied having a degeneracy related to the possible values of the third component of the total angular momentum .",
    "this quantum number is usually referred to as the spin of the exciton . among all these states , only two cases ,",
    "those corresponding to @xmath0 , are of interest in our problem due to their possible coupling with photons .",
    "the next excitation corresponds to the case in which both @xmath1 and @xmath2 excitons are occupied .",
    "this biexciton state has an energy different to twice that of a single exciton due to the coulomb interaction of their components .",
    "this spectrum presents interesting alternatives@xcite that we intend to study in future work while here we restrict to simplest case , in which we consider only excitons with a given spin .",
    "this assumption is well justified in the case of experiments in which the system is pumped with polarized light , so that excitons with a given angular momentum are created in the system .",
    "we also assume that spin flip mechanisms are slow as compared with typical time scales in our system .",
    "other single - particle states of the qd , above the exciton energy , can be neglected because they are not strongly coupled to the cavity mode in the case of resonance or quasi - resonance between the exciton and the confined photon . under these conditions",
    ", the problem reduces to that of a two - level artificial atom embedded in the optical cavity .",
    "we are going to show that , in spite of this simplification , the system presents a very rich variety of physical situations .",
    "the problem of a two - level system coupled to a single cavity mode , under different conditions and approximations , has received a lot of attention , mainly in the field of quantum optics @xcite .",
    "of particular interest is the study of the possible sub - poissonian radiation when cavity losses and pumping dominate onto the spontaneous emission of leaky modes .",
    "the aim of our work is an exhaustive analysis of the different regimes of parameters to determine the role played by the different physical mechanisms in the quantum properties of both the internal state of the system and the light emitted in the steady regime under continuous incoherent pumping .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we describe the model hamiltonian and master equation that allows to calculate the evolution of the populations and coherences of the energy levels . by means of the quantum regression theorem",

    "iii we present the results for the time evolution of the magnitudes of interest , in different ranges of parameters characterizing different physical situations .",
    "the spectrum of the light emitted by the system is presented and discussed in section iv .",
    "section v is devoted to a summary of the work .",
    "we consider a single qd inside a semiconductor microcavity that is continuously and incoherently pumped .",
    "our system is initially in its ground state and evolves until it reaches the steady - state . in order to describe the time evolution of the qd - cavity system we use a master equation that includes the strong exciton - photon coupling , the non - resonant pump , and the interaction with the environment that is responsible for dissipation .",

    "6 , 7 , 8 and 9 , it must be stressed that , for high quality cavities , i.e. low @xmath44 and @xmath43 , and intermediate value of the incoherent pumping @xmath45 is able to produce a rather large number of cavity photons with poisson distribution .",
    "when detuning increases this effect remains , although with a reduction of the region of parameters supporting it .",

    "this is the property that can be most easily measured in experiments .",
    "we will do it only in the case of finite detuning @xmath116 in order to observe the emission at two different frequencies .",
    "following the steps discussed in the section devoted to our model , we have computed @xmath151 and @xmath152 in the stationary limit ( @xmath153 ) for the three regimes already discussed @xmath131 , @xmath132 and @xmath45 comparable to @xmath43 . the envelopes ( with fast oscillations inside ) of these functions are shown in figs .",

    "13 , 14 and 15 . in these three figures",
    "we have made use of the fact , discussed in the introduction , that the two types of emissions can be separated : the emission coming from the cavity modes takes place along the axis of the pillars , while the emission of leaky modes takes place in any spatial direction ( mainly in the directions perpendicular to the axis of the pillar ) .",

    "therefore , only one peak at @xmath157 is observed .",
    "moreover , the peak shown in this spectrum is significantly narrower than the features observed in any other case we have analyzed as , for instance , the ones in the following figures .    fig .",
    "14 shows the result with a high value of the rate emission @xmath127 and a smaller , although non negligible , pumping @xmath128 .",
    "this case corresponds to @xmath158 and @xmath159 , i.e. to a sub - poissonian distribution of a small number of cavity photons .",

    "[ g1w1 ]    in the intermediate case shown in fig .",
    "15 , the dephasing of the two modes is similar and this produces a very wide peak at the spectrum as observed in the figure .",
