    "manipulating quantum systems on large , small and intermediate scales is no longer a distant dream .",
    "ultracold quantum gases experiments have realized bose - einstein condensates @xcite and degenerate fermi gases @xcite and study truly remarkable many - body states , but it has also proven its worth in exploring the physics of few - body systems @xcite .",
    "moreover , these studies can be conducted in different geometries as two- and one - dimensional quantum systems are produced regularly in laboratories @xcite .",
    "the so - called efimov three - body bound states were predicted over four decades ago @xcite .",
    "they arise when a three - body system , composed of equal mass particles , has all its two - body subsystems at the threshold of binding . in this case , infinitely many bound states with energies geometrically separated are expected .",
    "these are the efimov states and this effect is called the efimov effect .",
    "the effect is related to a long - range effective force and it can occur even when the individual two - body forces have zero range , as it was shown in an analytically solvable model by fonseca , redish and shanley @xcite .",
    "this is an example of how long - range forces can arise in the three - body problem in a way unpredictable by two - body intuition . in the early work of ref .",
    "@xcite the efimov problem was handled through the adiabatic approximation , more precisely the born - oppenheimer ( bo ) approximation that is commonly used in molecular physics .",
    "the bo approximation considers a system composed of two heavy and one light particle .",
    "the terms _ heavy _ and _ light _ have relative meaning : two particles are heavier than the third one . in this approximation",
    "the heavy particles move very slowly while the light particle orbits around them .",
    "in fact , it is enough to assume that the heavy particles kinetic energy is ( much ) smaller than the kinetic energy of the light particle .",
    "these results relating the efimov effect and the adiabatic approximation were obtained for three - dimensional ( 3d ) systems .",
    "the dynamics and properties of quantum systems drastically change when the system is restricted to lower dimensions .",
    "for example , the scattering - length is not well defined for two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems @xcite and the kinetic energy operator gives a negative centrifugal barrier for 2d systems with zero total angular momentum while the centrifugal barrier is always non - negative for 3d systems .",
    "furthermore , it was shown that any infinitesimal amount of attraction produces a bound state in 2d @xcite , while a finite amount of attraction is necessary for binding a 3d system .",
    "another important difference between 2d and 3d systems is the occurrence of the efimov effect .",
    "the effect does not occur in 2d neither for equal mass three - body system @xcite or unequal mass systems @xcite . while the bo approximation was implemented in ref .",
    "@xcite to look for the efimov effect in 2d imbalanced mass three - body systems , the mass - dependence of such systems was not addressed .",
    "the importance of the mass dependence in the 2d imbalanced mass three - body systems was stressed in refs .",
    "@xcite , where an increasing number of bound states was found for a decreasing mass of one particle .",
    "this situation , where one particle is much lighter than the other ones , is suitably handled in the adiabatic approximation .    in this work",
    "we study the bo approximation of 2d three - body systems from the mass - dependence perspective in a systematic fashion .",
    "we consider a 2d three - body system with zero - range interactions for general masses and interaction strengths .",
    "the momentum - space schrdinger equation is solved numerically both in full generality and in the bo approximation .",
    "the bo expression is derived using separable potentials and yields a concise adiabatic potential between the two heavy particles in the heavy - heavy - light system when the light particle coordinate is integrated out .",
    "the adiabatic potential is mass - dependent and it reveals an increasing number of bound states for the decreasing mass of the light particle .",
    "we find a transcendental equation that describes the adiabatic potential and an approximate analytic expression as well as the asymptotic form .",
    "furthermore , we show that the approximate analytic form of the potential is very close to the full adiabatic potential .",
    "furthermore , we estimate the number of bound states for a heavy - heavy - light system as a function of the light - heavy mass ratio . infinitely many bound states are expected as this ratio approaches zero .",
    "however , for each given mass configuration , we still have a finite number of bound states .",
    "our results demonstrate that mass - imbalanced systems that are accessible in recent ultracold atomic gases experiments can have a rich three - body bound state spectrum in 2d geometries , where small mass ratios increase the number of bound states . for @xmath0rb-@xmath0rb-@xmath1li and @xmath2cs-@xmath2cs-@xmath1li we find respectively 3 and 4 bound states .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "the introduction in section  [ sec1 ] is followed by the 2d three - body system formalism for zero - range interactions and general masses in the bo approximation in section  [ sec2 ] .",
    "the bo approximation and the adiabatic potential are shown in section  [ sec3 ] .",
    "the results are presented in section  [ sec4 ] and a discussion is given in section  [ sec5 ] .",
    "the general setup that we consider has particles that are always confined to a two - dimensional plane of motion , i.e. the kinematics is always 2d .",
    "however , we do not rule out systems with long - range interactions across many two - dimensional planes ( as done in recent experiments with polar molecules @xcite ) .",
    "both of these situations are shown in figure  [ fig1 ] for the most general case with three different particles @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the only assumptions concerning the interactions is that they are dependent only on the relative distance of the particles under consideration .",
    "we can then assume that the three - particle dynamics effectively happens in a single plane , since we may consider the layer index as an additional quantum number that specifies a few - body state .    ,",
    "@xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the two - body binding energies , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , and the coordinate axis are shown .",
    "( b ) a multi - layer setup with several @xmath3,@xmath4 and @xmath5 particles ( side view ) .",
    "long - range interactions in and between the layers can lead to bound state formation both within the same layer and for particles in different layers . in the case of three - body states , this is indicated by black arrows.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    here we are considering only zero - range interactions since we are interested in the model - independent low - energy universal limit .",
    "this limit emphasizes universal behaviour that should be independent of the particular system under study . in general , the validity of the approximation can be established by comparing the typical energy scale of the two - body interactions at short - range , i.e. for atomic systems this would typically be the van der waals length , @xmath9 . in order for the bound states to be universal and the zero - range interaction limit to apply , we need the binding energy , @xmath10 , to satisfy @xmath11 .",
    "we will assume that we are in this universal regime throughout the paper .",
    "the zero - range limit provides a simplification of the faddeev equation for the three - body bound state due to the separability of the zero - range interaction . in the case where we have long - range interaction across different layers and we have to assume that at low energy , the long - range forces may be approximated by a short - range pseudopotential that reproduces the two - body properties of the full potential . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , this can be done for potential that decay faster than @xmath12 for @xmath13 .",
    "this includes the case of dipolar @xmath14 interactions that we will return at the end of this paper .",
    "the 2d hamiltonian for the three - particle @xmath15 system with pairwise two - body potentials is @xmath16 where the three particles are , in principle , assumed to be bosons .",
    "however , for three different mass particles there is no symmetry requirements .",
    "our formalism takes the symmetry fully into account when two particles are identical bosons .",
    "the kinetic energy operator is @xmath17 where we use jacobi relative momenta given in terms of rest frame momenta , @xmath18 with @xmath19 , as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the cyclic permutations of the particles @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 with masses @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 . the reduced masses are @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "we use a separable potential with operator form @xmath27 where the form factor is @xmath28 , depends only on the relative momentum of the two particles @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the limit to zero - range interaction is simply @xmath31 .    in order to relate the separable potential ansatz above to physical properties of the two - body system",
    "we use the the two - body t - matrix . for negative energies and zero - range potentials",
    "it is defined by @xmath32 where , the matrix element of the 2d transition matrices are given by ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite for the case of identical particles ) @xmath33 ^{-1 } \\ , \\label{tau}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 , @xmath4 or @xmath5 and @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath36 is the energy of the @xmath37 two - body bound states .",
    "we will measure all three - body energies in units of the two - body energy .",
    "in general systems where @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 are different , one only needs to make a specific choice between the @xmath36 .",
    "we will explicitly state our units in these cases . also it is important to know that @xmath38 it corresponds to a non - interacting @xmath37 system since @xmath39 in this case .",
    "this is different from 3d where a two - body bound state at zero energy happens at unitarity , i.e. where the interactions are as strong as allowed by the unitary limit of quantum mechanics applied to the @xmath40-wave scattering amplitude .    in order to solve for three - body bound states , the wave function @xmath41 is decomposed in terms of the faddeev components as @xmath42 where @xmath43 with the resolvent @xmath44 which is nonsingular for bound states .",
    "the bound state equation can be solved by the method described in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath45 systems with some straightforward generalizations to the @xmath15 structure .",
    "we therefore refer to ref .",
    "@xcite for the details of the formalism and do not repeat them here . instead we now proceed to discuss the adiabatic approximation .",
    "we now consider two heavy particles with mass @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",

    "the coordinate of the light particle is its distance from this choice of origin.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    the adiabatic approximation now instructs a split of the three - body eigenvalue equation into the solution of two two - body problems : the light particle motion is considered with respect to the heavy - heavy system and the heavy - heavy system motion is separated out .",
    "these eigenvalue equations will be useful whenever the motion of the light particle is rapid compared to the motion of the heavy ones , so that the light particle dynamics can be solved while the heavy particles are instantaneously at rest .",
    "the wave function is written as @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the wave function describing the motion of the light particle for fixed @xmath46 and @xmath58 is the heavy - heavy system wave function .",

    "if we consider a system of just one hyperfine state of @xmath147li and of @xmath2cs clearly two of the interactions will be identical ( for instance @xmath148 on the left side of figure  [ graph09 ] ) .",
    "however , as has been discussed in the recent studies of feshbach resonances in this mixed system @xcite different hyperfine states will in general give different interactions .",

    "the adiabatic problem was handled for a non - interacting heavy - heavy system , i.e. @xmath119 .",

    "this region gives the deepest bound states in the adiabatic approximation .",
    "we see that the symmetry present in ref .",

    "the systems @xmath0rb-@xmath0rb-@xmath1li ( diamond ) and @xmath2cs-@xmath2cs-@xmath1li ( circles ) have three and four bound states , respectively .",
    "this is the experimentally relevant case @xcite , and our results demonstrates that also in a 2d setup , the @xmath147li-@xmath2cs system will have several bound states .",
    "it is known that the most favorable scenario for a spectrum with many bound states for two dimensional three - body systems is the symmetric energy case , where all the subsystems are equally bound , i.e. @xmath153 @xcite",
    ". however , this scenario seems less likely in current experiments .",
    "a very promising scenario is shown in figure  [ graph06 ] , where the heavy - heavy system does not interact and the two heavy - light systems have the same binding energy . except for the energy - symmetric case in ref .",
    "@xcite , this is the most favorable scenario for a rich energy spectrum in 2d .",
    "figure  [ graph07 ] shows scenario where the two - body energies are fully imbalanced . we have selected a generic case with energy scales related through @xmath154 and @xmath155",
    "this may appear difficult to set up experimentally , but fortunately this scenario does not seem to have any advantage over the others . in region @xmath150 , where our reference system has the heavy - heavy system more strongly bound than the others , the @xmath0rb-@xmath0rb-@xmath1li and @xmath2cs-@xmath2cs-@xmath1li systems have only one bound state each . in this energy configuration ,",
    "the region @xmath145 should be the most similar to region @xmath150 in figure  [ graph06 ] , where the heavy - heavy system is not as bound as the others .",
    "however , regions @xmath145 and @xmath146 appear almost symmetric in figure  [ graph07 ] , showing that both systems have two bound states each .",

    "the numbers @xmath150 , @xmath145 and @xmath146 label three different regions according to figure  [ graph09 ] and the roman numerals point out the number of bound states inside each solid curve.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "we consider three - body systems with zero - range interactions for general masses and interaction strength in two - dimensions ( 2d ) .",
    "the aim of this work is to study the limit where one particle is much lighter than the others ( @xmath156 ) for non - interacting heavy particles , i.e. @xmath119 .",
    "this limit contains a rich energy spectrum and can be handled through the born - oppenheimer ( bo ) approximation .",
    "the bo approximation allows us to integrate out the light particle coordinate in order to derive the adiabatic potential between the heavy particles in the heavy - heavy - light system .",
    "the adiabatic potential is found to be the solution of a transcendental equation .",
    "we are able to find analytical forms for the asymptotic behavior for large and small @xmath157 , where @xmath157 is the distance between the two heavy particles . comparing both asymptotic behavior and numerical solution of the adiabatic potential , we find that the analytic form precisely describes the adiabatic potential for any @xmath157 and can be directly applied in 2d three - body system calculations .",
    "the analytic adiabatic potential explicitly shows the mass - dependence . the analytic adiabatic potential becomes more attractive and suffers less screening as the mass of the light particle @xmath5 decreases ( @xmath158 ) .",
    "this potential explain the increasing number of bound states in this limit and we are able to demonstrate that the bound states accumulate both at @xmath84 and @xmath96 .",
    "we thus see an efimov - like effect when @xmath159 .",
    "however , we still caution that for any _ finite _ @xmath24 there are only a finite number of bound three - body states .    the results obtained with the analytic adiabatic potential agree with numerical solutions of the momentum - space schrdinger equation .",
    "however , approaching the three - body problem in 2d with the analytic form of the adiabatic potential has the huge advantage that it is much less computationally demanding and allows for easy access to rich regions of the mass - diagrams .",
    "furthermore , we are able to show that the number of bound states calculated with the analytic adiabatic potential matches the estimate given by the semi - classical jwkb methods of the old quantum theory , i.e. the bohr - sommerfeld method .    in recent",
    "work it was shown that the richest 2d energy spectrum is found when the three - body mass - imbalanced system has all two - body subsystems bound with the same energy , namely @xmath153 for @xmath160 @xcite .",
    "however , as these conditions are difficult to obtain in experiment , we search for other configurations able to produce a rich energy spectrum .",
    "we numerically solve the momentum - space schrdinger equation for general masses and interaction strengths in order to build mass - mass diagrams , which outline the expected number of bound state for a general three - body system .",
    "we find that systems with equal mass and non - interacting heavy particles , i.e. @xmath156 and @xmath161 , are the most promising candidates to achieve a rich three - body bound state spectrum in 2d .",
    "incidentally , this promising configuration is the one that can be handled with great precision in the bo approximation as we have shown .",
    "one of these promising configurations was recently reported as the experimental realization of @xmath2cs-@xmath1li systems @xcite .",
    "it even looks as if three - body bound states can be expected when the subsystem @xmath2cs-@xmath2cs is almost non - interacting . we can estimate the number of bound states for such a system in a two - dimensional setup through the mass - mass diagrams in this work . for @xmath0rb-@xmath0rb-@xmath1li and @xmath2cs-@xmath2cs-@xmath1li",
    "we find respectively 3 and 4 bound states .",
    "it is very important to note that these numbers do _ not _ depend on the exact two - body energy in the @xmath147li-@xmath2cs subsystem .",
    "this two - body energy in the 2d setup are functions of the 3d low - energy scattering length @xcite of the particular feshbach resonance that is used in experiment to tune the interaction .",
    "however , as long as there is such a resonance , our results should apply when the system is squeezed into a two - dimensional geometry .    for now , the system @xmath2cs-@xmath2cs-@xmath1li prepared as in region 1 of figures  [ graph09 ] and [ graph06 ] seems to be the most promising realistic combination to achieve a richer three - body energy spectrum in 2d .",
    "some other mixtures under intense study at the moment with large mass imbalances are lithium - ytterbium @xcite and helium - rubidium @xcite . of particular interest",
    "is that there are different isotopes available in those systems so that the quantum statistics of the components can also be changed . in the case of layered systems with long - range dipolar interactions as shown in figure  [ fig1 ] is also extremely promising for finding bound states @xcite , and we expect that some of these will have a universal low - energy character",
    ". the possibility of tuning the binding energy of each pair and performing experiments mixing molecules and atoms should open new avenues for even richer two - dimensional three - body spectra .",
    "another interesting discussion is what the trace of the three - body parameter is in the corresponding 2d bound states .",
    "the three - body parameter determines the overall scale of the three - body spectrum in 3d and has recently been shown to be universally connected to the two - body van der waals interaction @xcite .",
    "the 2d three - body problem does not require a three - body parameter in order to study the universal limit with zero - range interaction due to the ever present two - body bound state with energy @xmath70 which makes the three - body problem regular and well - defined even in the zero - range limit @xcite .",
    "however , the fact remains that short - range physics due to the real atomic two - body potential ( typically of lennard - jones type ) is still present in the system .",
    "this clear physical origin of the three - body parameter indicates that it could still play a role in 2d in not only determining the precise physical value of @xmath70 for a given system but perhaps also have a quantitative influence on three - body energies .",
    "in order to experimentally observe the presence of these three - body bound states one should be able to use similar techniques to those used for the study of efimov states in 3d , i.e. loss measurements @xcite and photo - association @xcite .",
    "it may also be possible to use rf ( radio - frequency ) transition techniques as in recent experiments studied two - body bound states and many - body pairing in two - dimensional fermi gases @xcite .",
    "another possible experimental signature of 2d three - body systems is through the momentum distribution and the two- and three - body contact parameters which appears as coefficients @xcite .",
    "these coefficients depends sensitively on the presence of bound two- and three - body states .",
    "this work was partly support by funds provided by fapesp ( fundao de amparo  pesquisa do estado de so paulo ) and cnpq ( conselho nacional de desenvolvimento cientfico e tecnolgico ) of brazil , and by the danish agency for science , technology , and innovation .",
