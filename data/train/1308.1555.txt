    "active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are powered by accretion of matter onto the central supermassive black hole ( smbh ) that is believed to reside in their centre ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the large bolometric output of agn is powerful enough to drive ionised winds into the medium of the host galaxy in the form of mass outflows .",
    "indeed , more than 50% of nearby seyfert 1 galaxies present clear evidence of photoionised gas , the so - called warm absorber ( wa hereafter ) , in their soft x - ray spectra ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and in their uv spectra ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these wa are usually detected as absorption features blushifted with respect to the systemic velocity of the source , typically by hundreds of km s@xmath4 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these mass outflows inject mass and energy into the interstellar medium ( ism ) and can deeply affect the evolution of the host galaxy ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and even the surrounding intergalactic medium ( igm , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "if the kinetic luminosity of the outflows is as high as 0.5% to 5% of the bolometric luminosity ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , their impact is enough to significantly regulate galaxy growth and reproduce the observed @xmath8 relation ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .    in spite of their importance",
    ", the structure , origin , launching mechanism , and relation between the x - ray and uv absorbers are not yet fully understood .",
    "the proposed origins for agn outflows are disc - driven winds ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and thermal winds produced by evaporation from the torus ( @xcite ) .",
    "winds emanating from the accretion disc are expected to lie within several hundred gravitational radii , while thermally - driven winds should originate at pc scales , at or beyond the location of the dusty torus .",
    "an accurate determination of the distance is essential to establish the actual mass outflow rate and assess their importance as contributors for cosmic feedback processes .    in this paper",
    "we present the results of the analysis of a @xmath9  ks observation with -letgs and archival x - ray and uv observations with and hst - stis , respectively , of the nearby ( @xmath10 , @xcite ) seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 4593 .",
    "it is a mildly luminous agn ( @xmath11  erg s@xmath4 , this work ) and is hosted by a barred spiral galaxy with a relatively modest - size smbh in its centre ( @xmath12  @xmath13 , @xcite ) .",

    "the letgs data were reduced using the standard pipeline ( ciao 4.2 ) until the level 1.5 event files were created . the rest of the procedure , until the creation of the final level 2 event file , followed the same steps as the standard pipeline regarding the wavelength accuracy determination and effective area generation , but was carried out using an independent procedure first described in @xcite .    no episodes of short - term variability ( e.g. within a few  ks )",
    "were observed after applying a bin size of 100  s. during the first observation the source flux varies smoothly , while during the second observation the source experiences a drop in flux of the order of @xmath1850% followed by a recovery in the last part of the observation ( see fig .",

    "because of the low statistics , no significant spectral variations were observed between the high and low spectral states ( i.e. spectral fits for the low and high flux states rendered the same parameter values within the uncertainties ) .",
    "the combined spectra were therefore used in the analysis described throughout this paper .",
    "we also retrieved a observation of ngc 4593 taken in 2002 from the science archive ( xsa ) .",
    "the analysis of this observation was first reported in @xcite but they did not include the data from the reflection grating spectrometer ( rgs , @xcite ) .",
    "we processed these data with the standard analysis system sas version 11 . only data from the second , restarted exposure u002 were used , since the first ( default ) exposure ( s004/s005 ) was stopped almost immediately due to high radiation and contained virtually no data .",

    "because of the high radiation background , the data were severely affected and the rgs spectrum was rather noisy . however , @xcite were able to derive the ionic column densities of several species present in the spectrum albeit with large uncertainties .",
    "their results are fully in agreement with ours ( reported in table  [ slab ] ) within the error bars . their analysis of the letgs data revealed the presence of highly ionised gas ( @xmath20 ) outflowing at @xmath21  km s@xmath4 with a column density of @xmath22  @xmath23 .",
    "their results are hence consistent with what we found for component @xmath24 in the outflow at the @xmath25 confidence level , although we detect a marginally higher column density for this component . as in our observations",
    ", they required an extra component to account for weak absorption lines in the oxygen region resulting in a shallow ( @xmath26  @xmath23 ) lower ionisation gas ( @xmath27 ) outflowing at @xmath28  km s@xmath4 .",
    "again , these results are in agreement with those of our lowest ionisation component @xmath29",
    ". the outflow velocities of the components detected by @xcite are consistent with each other within @xmath25 , similarly to what we find for components @xmath29 to @xmath24 .",
    "their available statistics made them unable to discriminate whether these outflows belonged to a single kinematic component .",
    "the ionised gas in ngc 4593 was also observed with the high energy transmission gratings ( hetgs ) in june 2001 ( @xcite ) .",
    "since they cover a higher energy range , a single - zone photoionised absorber suffices to adequately describe the soft x - ray spectrum of ngc 4593 .",
    "the reported parameters of this gas reported in @xcite are @xmath30 and @xmath31  @xmath23 ( for consistency , we have converted their quoted 90% confidence errors to 1@xmath32 ) .",
    "although the value of the ionisation parameter @xmath33 is in agreement with the one we derive for component @xmath24 in our dataset , they measure a much slower outflow velocity of @xmath34  km  s@xmath4 and a column density @xmath35 higher by a factor of 2 .",
    "ngc 4593 was observed again by in june 2002 .",
    "the results of this observation are reported in @xcite .",
    "they did not use the rgs spectrum ( analysed in this paper ) and they relied only on the analysis of the epic - pn spectrum . even though the lower spectral resolution of epic - pn does not allow to extract information on individual lines",
    ", @xcite were able to derive the ionisation parameter and column densities of the intervening absorber .",
    "their results depended on the model used to parametrize the soft excess : single temperature bremsstrahlung emission or thermal comptonization by plasma at a temperature between that of the disc and the hard x - ray corona . in either case",
    "they require two ionised absorbers at the redshift of the source to reproduce the observed spectrum .",
    "the former yielded two components with @xmath36 and @xmath37  @xmath23 , and @xmath38 and @xmath39  @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "the latter provides a best fit with @xmath40 and @xmath41  @xmath23 , and @xmath42 and @xmath43  @xmath23 , respectively ( as above , their quoted 90% errors have been converted into 1@xmath32 errors for consistency ) .",
    "while these results indicate a somewhat deeper absorber ( @xmath35 higher than ours by a factor of @xmath185 in the first case ) , their ionisation parameters are generally consistent with those of our components .",
    "therefore , it is clear from this analysis and the previous ones that the wa in ngc 4593 can be successfully described with at least two distinct components , although a more complex structure can not be ruled out .",
    "the kinematic distribution of these components remain , however , somewhat unclear .",
    "some emission features of oxygen , nitrogen , and carbon are seen in the soft x - ray spectra of ngc 4593 in the and observations , as reported in sect .",
    "[ xraycont ] .",
    "lines arising in he - like species like , , and are of particular interest . in the case of and only the forbidden ( @xmath44 ) and intercombination ( @xmath45 ) lines of the triplets are significantly detected , while for the only significant feature is the @xmath44 line .",
    "the lack of a significant detection of resonance ( @xmath46 ) lines together with relatively strong @xmath44 lines may indicate that the dominant ionising process photoionisation ( @xcite ) .",
    "we note , however , that we are unable to significantly detect any radiative recombination continua ( rrc ) features in the spectrum , which are typical signatures in photoionised plasmas .",
    "emission line diagnostics can be used to estimate some of the physical properties of the line emitting gas .",
    "the @xmath47 ratio is often used as an estimator of the electron density of the gas .",
    "using the triplet , ratios @xmath48 and @xmath49 are measured in the and observations , respectively .",
    "this result , taking into account the large uncertainties , points to emission in a gas with density between @xmath50  and @xmath51  @xmath52 , according to @xcite .",
    "the emission lines in the letgs spectrum , detected only at the @xmath53 level , yields @xmath54 , formally an upper limit .",
    "the rgs spectrum , however , shows a somewhat contradictory result as the @xmath45 line is much stronger than the @xmath44 line and @xmath55 , thus implying that this emission feature arises in a higher density plasma @xmath51  @xmath52 . in principle",
    "the ratio @xmath56 can also be used to estimate the electron temperature of the gas .",
    "however due to the non - detection of the @xmath46 line in neither of the observations and triplets , it is not feasible to derive an accurate @xmath57 ratio for ngc 4593 .",
    "the line fluxes of the and @xmath44 and @xmath45 lines decreased between the  and observations ( see tables  [ cont ]  and  [ rgscont ] ) .",
    "if these changes are caused in response to the variations in the flux of the source , an upper limit to the distance of the emitter can be immediately estimated by means of the light distance traveled . given the time span between both observations ( 3147 days at the rest frame of ngc 4593 )",
    "we derive a distance of @xmath58  pc .",
    "since the observations were taken more than 8 years apart , this somewhat loose upper limit can not be further constrained with the available data .",
    "the observations taken with in 2001 and that of in 2000 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) only report flux line values consistent with those that we find in the rgs spectrum . alternatively one can also estimate the distance of the emission line clouds to the center if one assumes that the gas dynamics are dominated by the central supermassive black hole ( e.g. @xcite ) :    @xmath59    where @xmath60 is the mass of the black hole , @xmath57 is the constant of gravity , and @xmath61 is the fwhm is the emission lines . for a mass of @xmath62  @xmath13 ( @xcite ) and measured fwhm of the order of 1500 @xmath63 3000  km s@xmath4 for the x - ray emission lines , and 2500 @xmath63 3500  km s@xmath4 for the uv emission lines , we obtain @xmath64  pc .",
    "this would locate the emission line clouds well within the blr of ngc 4593 , which is estimated to lie between @xmath65  light - days or @xmath66  pc , based on h@xmath67 measurements ( @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , the estimated high density value @xmath51  @xmath52 of the gas points to an origin in the blr and recalls the cases of mrk 335 ( @xcite ) and mrk 841 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the results obtained in sect .  [ analysis ] show a complex multi - component absorption spectrum in ngc 4593 . in the x - rays , three kinematic components ( see table  [ wabest ] )",
    "are in principle required to obtain a satisfactory fit . in previous x - ray observations",

    "[ comparison ] ) the only reported outflow velocities for a two - zone photoionised gas revealed values consistent with each other ( @xcite ) .",
    "the other papers either report a single velocity scenario or no velocity measurement at all . in all cases ,",
    "the reported outflow velocity values are consistent with each other and they are of the order of @xmath68  km s@xmath4 .",
    "our _ slab _ fits to the x - ray data allowed for a multi - velocity structure for the absorption system , obtaining 3 kinematic components . in sect .",
    "[ xrayslab ] we showed that there is no difference within the uncertainties between the letgs and rgs kinematic components .",
    "our photoionisation modeling with _ xabs _ also provides a three - velocity structure ( @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71  km s@xmath4 , respectively ) , which is in agreement within the error bars with those of the _ slab _ modeling . the lower ionisation components @xmath29 and @xmath72 share the same outflow velocity at @xmath69  km s@xmath4 which , in turn , differs from that of the intermediate ionisation phase @xmath24 by less than @xmath73 . on the other hand , the higher ionisation phase @xmath74 , for which we obtain a higher velocity with _",

    "the kinematic structure is much clearer as 15 distinct kinematic components are seen in , , , and with outflow velocities ranging from @xmath75  km s@xmath4 to @xmath76  km s@xmath4 .",
    "these kinematic components are unambiguously detected in all the ions , except for which only shows four troughs belonging to components 1 , 2 , 9 , and 10 .",
    "the fastest components 13 to 15 , with outflow velocities ranging from @xmath77 to @xmath6  km s@xmath4 are seen only in . in our uv analysis",
    "we also find significant evidence of partial covering in components 3 , 5 , 6 , 10 , 11 , and 12 , a conclusive hallmark of an associated absorber from an outflow , as opposed to a merely intervening cloud .",
    "whether there is a possible kinematic agreement between the x - ray wa and the uv absorber is difficult to determine because the spectral resolution in the x - ray domain is much poorer and therefore a one - to - one identification is not feasible . to illustrate this , we show in fig .",
    "[ xvspace ] the x - ray spectra with letgs and rgs in velocity space at the position of different ions , with the measured uv kinematic components overplotted .    however , the velocity range of the uv absorbers is roughly similar to that of the x - ray absorber within the errors ( i.e. a few hundreds of km s@xmath4 ) , thus in principle it is reasonable to assume that some of the uv components might have a counterpart detectable in the x - ray domain .",
    "for example , components @xmath29 and @xmath72 in the x - rays , which seem to share the same kinematic regime , span a velocity range between @xmath78 and @xmath79 , which would be consistent with uv components 4 and 5 . on the other hand , component @xmath24 in x - rays spreads over an uncertinty range of @xmath80  km s@xmath4 , which can be kinematically associated to components 6 and/or 7 and , marginally , to component 8 in the uv .",
    "likewise , the fastest x - ray component @xmath74 ranges between @xmath81  and @xmath82  km s@xmath4 and is a good match with uv components 11 and 12 , and with component 10 at the 2@xmath32 confidence level .",
    "nevertheless , the x - ray and uv absorbing gas may arise in very different physical environments , so in order to assess whether there is a physical relation between them other properties need to be further examined .      the total ionic column densities of and summed over all the uv kinematic components are of the order of @xmath83  @xmath23 and @xmath84  @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "the bulk of the ionic column density is carried by component 9 ( @xmath1856% ) , and the rest is more or less evenly distributed between components 3 ( @xmath1813% ) , 6 ( @xmath186% ) , 7 ( @xmath1810% ) , and 10 ( @xmath188% ) . for , the ionic column densities are distributed between components 1 ( @xmath1870% ) and , to a lower extent , component 9 ( @xmath1818% ) .",
    "a direct comparison between the x - ray and uv observations , or even among the individual uv components seen by stis is difficult . as noted in sect .",
    "[ stis ] , some of the uv features show a high level of saturation , namely component 1 in and , component 9 in ,  and , and components 2 , 3 , 7 , 10 , and 15 in . in a conservative approach ,",
    "the column densities reported in table  [ uvslab ] should therefore be considered as lower limits .",
    "some general considerations can nevertheless be drawn from these results and , in particular , the comparison with the observation as it was taken quasi - simultaneously with that of .",
    "the ionic column density measured in the rgs spectrum yields @xmath85  @xmath23 which , in spite of the large uncertainties , is broadly consistent with the value measured in the uv .",
    "the situation is more complicated for , as this feature arises in a very lowly ionised plasma that produces very little absorption in the x - rays .",
    "therefore , only upper limits on its ionic column density can be derived for this ion @xmath86  @xmath23 .",
    "since the @xmath87 measured in the uv does not exceed this value , it can be assumed that there is formally no discrepancy between these results .",
    "the similar outflow velocities and ionic column densities may indicate that the x - ray and uv absorbers originate in the same intervening gas .",
    "however , this is at odds with the different ionisation structure depicted by the photoionisation analysis .",
    "the ionisation parameter @xmath33 measured in the x - ray wa increases with increasing outflow velocity , while the general trend in the uv is the opposite , with decreasing @xmath33 as the velocity increases ( see table  [ uvxabs ] ) .",

    "the pressure ionisation parameter is defined as @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the speed of light , @xmath92 is the constant of boltzmann , and @xmath89 is the electron temperature .",
    "the different values of @xmath88 are computed using _ cloudy _ , which provided a grid of ionisation parameters @xmath33 and the corresponding electron temperature @xmath89 for a thin layer of gas illuminated by the ionising continuum .",

    "below the curve heating dominates cooling , while above the curve cooling dominates heating ( e.g. @xcite ) . the parts of the curve where @xmath94 ( i.e. where the curve turns backwards ) are unstable against isobaric thermal perturbations ( vertical displacements from the curve ) .",
    "the parts of the curve with positive derivative @xmath95 define stable regions .",
    "components sharing the same @xmath88 value on this thermal stability curve are nominally in pressure equilibrium with each other and therefore would likely be part of the same long - lived structure .    in fig .",
    "[ xitemp ] we show the thermal stability curve of ngc 4593 , with the different x - ray wa and uv absorber components overplotted .",
    "the thermal stability curve was generated using the sed at the epoch of the quasi - simultaneous observations of and .",
    "overplotted on the curve are the different phases of the x - ray wa ( squares ) and uv absorbers ( triangles ) .",
    "it can be seen that the x - ray wa components @xmath29 and @xmath72 both fall in stable areas of the curve , as well as the higher ionisation component @xmath74 .",
    "component @xmath24 , on the other hand , seems to fall in an unstable branch of the curve .",
    "although wa phases typically fall in stable areas ( e.g. mrk 279 , @xcite ) , components lying in unstable branches are not uncommon .",
    "for example , one of the high - ionisation phases of the wa in mrk 509 shows this behaviour ( @xcite ) , and similarly in ngc 5548 ( @xcite ; seta et al .",
    ", in preparation ) . in general , the majority of wa components are located in thermally stable areas , which would suggest that those components lying in unstable regions would relocate to stable regions on time scales typically short compared to the agn lifetime .",
    "the uv components are spread over the stable branch of the stability curve .",
    "interestingly , a number of these components tend to cluster around the position of the lower ionistion wa , namely components 7 to 12 around the wa @xmath29 and components 3 to 6 around the wa @xmath72 .",
    "since they approximately share the same @xmath88 within the error bars , they are therefore in pressure equilibrium which may indicate that they form part of the same long - lived structure . from this point of view , it is reasonable to assume that the low ionisation wa likely originates in the same intervening gas as the uv absorbers , in particular for the case of the x - ray absorber @xmath72 .",
    "the outflow velocity of this wa phase is consistent with those of the uv components 3 to 6 , so they would be co - located assuming keplerian motion . however , in the case of the x - ray absorber @xmath29 , there are kinematic discrepancies that are difficult to reconcile with this scenario as the uv components are outflowing significantly faster .",
    "the location of the x - ray and uv absorbers is difficult to estimate . while in principle one could use the definition of the ionisation parameter @xmath33 in eq .",
    "[ xieq ] to deduce the distance of the gas to the ionising source @xmath96 , in practice the product @xmath97 is degenerate .",
    "ideally , variability between observations can be used to determine the density @xmath98 and therefore put constraints on the distance @xmath96 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , the distance of the x - ray wa can not be constrained in this way .",
    "for instance , the x - ray wa measured by @xcite and in the rgs spectrum in this work has the same best - fit parameters as in our letgs results within the error bars , even though a change in flux of @xmath1840% had occured between these observations .",
    "moreover , the column densities of the most relevant ions remained fully consistent within the uncertainties thus preventing us from estimating the distance on grounds of variability . in this respect , because of the lack of monitoring of the wa in ngc 4593 in the last decade , it is difficult to tell whether such changes in the ionising flux happened shortly before our letgs observation and therefore the gas did not have time to reach the equilibrium again .",
    "there is the possibility to estimate the location of the absorbing gas by other means .",
    "for example , @xcite used dynamical and momentum conservation arguments to derive an expression that provides an upper limit to the distance .",
    "while in principle such an argument can be valid for radiation - driven winds , there is mounting evidence that other mechanisms ( e .. shocks , thermal instabilities , magnetic fields ) could be involved in the wind launching . in this respect ,",
    "@xcite studied self - similar solutions for magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) winds in accretion discs , finding that they provide a good match with the observed properties of ionised winds in seyfert galaxies .",
    "we can derive some rough upper limits on the location of the different components of the ionised winds in ngc 4593 following a very conservative approach .",
    "the main assumption is that most of the mass in the wa is concentrated in a layer with thickness @xmath99 which is less than or equal to the distance to the central ionising source @xmath96 so that : @xmath100 .",
    "the column density along our line of sight can be approximated to @xmath101 .",
    "combining these conditions with the definition of the ionisation parameter @xmath33 given in eq .",
    "[ xieq ] , we are left with    @xmath102    for an ionising luminosity of @xmath103  erg s@xmath4 at the epoch of the and observations , we find that the lower ionisation components @xmath29 and @xmath72 are located within @xmath104  kpc and @xmath105  pc , respectively , from the central engine .",
    "the location of the wa component @xmath24 is more constrained within @xmath106  pc . for the highest ionisation component @xmath74 ,",
    "given the uncertainty in the determination of its column density , we obtain an upper limit to the distance @xmath107 ranging between @xmath108 and @xmath109  pc .",
    "following the same reasoning the uv absorbers are located at kpc distances .    although these limits are rather loose , they clearly indicate that our line of sight is crossing several clouds of gas located at different distances from the central engine , with decreasing ionisation state as the distance increases .",
    "this scenario is sketched by @xcite in their fig .",
    "8 , where a line of sight at a given inclination angle intersects different parts of a stratified wind , each with different @xmath33 , column density and velocity .",
    "while it is still possible that some of the uv features originate in the same gas that causes the low - ionisation x - ray absorption , the model depicted by @xcite suggest that the variety of ionisation phases seen in the gas belong to different strata originally launched from different parts of the disc .",
    "we can estimate how much mass is carried out of the central regions of ngc 4593 by the outflows and assess whether it may have any impact on the surrounding ism of the host galaxy . if the outflow is in the form of a partial thin spherical shell at a distance @xmath96 from the central source moving radially at constant speed @xmath61 , the mass outflow rate is given by    @xmath110    where @xmath111 is the mean atomic mass per proton , @xmath112 is the proton mass , and @xmath113 is the solid angle subtended by the outflow ( between 0 and @xmath114  sr ) .",
    "the main source of uncertainty in the determination of the mass outflow rate is introduced by the parameter @xmath113 , which is typically assumed to be @xmath115  sr , inferred from the observed type-1/type2 ratio in nearby seyfert galaxies ( @xcite ) and the fact that ionised outflows are seen in approximately half of the observed seyfert 1 galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "we note that this value may not hold if the outflows are bent because of gravitational and/or magnetic processes .    in this way",
    "we obtain @xmath116  @xmath13  yr@xmath4 , @xmath117",
    "@xmath13  yr@xmath4 , @xmath118  @xmath13  yr@xmath4 , and @xmath119  @xmath13  yr@xmath4 for the wa components @xmath29 to @xmath74 , respectively . we expressed these mass outflow rates as a function of @xmath113 in order to reflect the uncertainty associated to this parameter .    for comparison , the mass accretion rate",
    "is obtained from the bolometric luminosity using    @xmath120    the bolometric luminosities of ngc 4593 derived from the sed is @xmath121  erg s@xmath4 , and @xmath122  erg s@xmath4 for the letgs and rgs observations , respectively . assuming a nominal accretion efficiency of @xmath123 , the mass accretion rate results in @xmath124  @xmath13  yr@xmath4 , and @xmath125  @xmath13  yr@xmath4 , respectively .",
    "one can see that the accretion rate at the epoch of the rgs observation almost doubled that of the letgs observation , assuming that the accretion efficiency remained the same .",
    "the total mass outflow rate of the x - ray wa is therefore higher than the mass accretion rate , as often seen in other sources ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) . as an example , assuming that the absorbers subtend a solid angle @xmath115  sr , the mass outflow rates of the x - ray components would be @xmath126  @xmath13  yr@xmath4 , @xmath127  @xmath13  yr@xmath4 , @xmath128  @xmath13  yr@xmath4 , and @xmath129  @xmath13  yr@xmath4 .    the lowest ionisation component @xmath29 is located at @xmath18kpc distances from the central source .",
    "therefore , this outflow likely originated in an earlier episode of activity of ngc 4593 ( e.g. @xcite ) and it is unrelated to the current agn emission detected in these observations . in a conservative approach , we will not consider this component in the next energetics estimations .",
    "thus , the total mass outflow rate summed over the remaining components is @xmath130  @xmath13  yr@xmath4 , between @xmath131 and @xmath132 times the mass accretion rate at the epoch of the rgs and letgs observations .",
    "the total kinetic energy per unit time carried by the outflow is the sum of the kinetic luminosity injected into the medium by the different components , and is defined as @xmath133 . excluding component @xmath29 , we find it to be @xmath134  erg s@xmath4 , expressed as a function of @xmath113 .",
    "the total kinetic energy injected in the medium represents a small fraction of the bolometric luminosity of the source : @xmath135% , for @xmath122  erg s@xmath4 . for a typical value @xmath115  sr ,",
    "we thus obtain @xmath136% .",
    "these values are in agreement with those estimated for other nearby seyfert galaxies reported in @xcite .",
    "overall , the outflows in ngc 4593 seem to be too weak to produce a significant impact in the surrounding ism .",
    "many agn feedback models require that a significant fraction of the agn radiative output ( @xmath185% ) has to be fed back in the form of kinetic and internal motion energy in outflows in order to reproduce the observed @xmath8 relation ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) , at least one order of magnitude above the values we measure for ngc 4593 .",
    "however , if we consider that the measured kinetic luminosity is injected into the ism at this rate throughout the whole agn lifetime , which can be up to @xmath137  yr ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , the total kinetic energy fed back to the medium would be @xmath138  erg .",
    "this value is roughly consistent with the energy required to disrupt the ism of a typical galaxy , which is estimated to be @xmath139  erg ( @xcite ) .",
    "a more conservative approach may consider that the expansion of the outflowing gas , with a corresponding decrease in density as it dilutes in the ism , could increase the cross - section of the material thus favouring the momentum coupling from absorption of the ionising flux . in this case the required feedback to alter the ism and supress star formation in the host galaxy might be reduced by about one order of magnitude to @xmath140% of the luminosity ( @xcite ) .",
    "while our estimated kinetic luminosity is still lower than this value , it is therefore very unlikely that the outflows seen in ngc 4593 can significantly affect the medium of the host galaxy in a single agn episode .",
    "however , if we integrate these contributions over the entire lifetime of the agn , it results that the outflows ( even for a low luminosity agn hosting a relatively small smbh like ngc 4593 ) may have a small ( but not negligible ) influence on the surroundings of the host galaxy .",
    "we have analysed the soft x - ray and uv spectra of the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 4593 obtained with -letgs , rgs , and hst / stis , respectively . in the x - rays",
    "there is significant evidence of a multi - phase wa with four distinct degrees of ionisation : @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "these components are outflowing , being the low - ionisation components @xmath29 and @xmath72 slower ( @xmath69  km s@xmath4 ) than the high - ionisation components @xmath24 ( @xmath141  km s@xmath4 ) , and @xmath74 ( @xmath142  km s@xmath4 ) .    in the uv",
    ", we detected a wealth of absorption troughs in the , , , and regions .",
    "these uv absorbers are also blueshifted with respect to the systemic velocity of the source and therefore are also outflowing .",
    "they can be attributed to 15 distinct kinematic components ranging between @xmath143  km s@xmath4 and @xmath144  km s@xmath4 .",
    "attending to the ionisation state of the gas , uv components 7 to 12 might be the counterparts of the low - ionisation phase @xmath29 , whereas components 3 to 6 show similar values as component @xmath72 .",
    "components @xmath24 and @xmath74 are probably too ionised to produce any significant absorption in the uv .",
    "furthermore , the x - ray low - ionisation wa is in pressure equilibrium with the uv absorber thus indicating that they may form part of the same long - lived structure .",
    "the predicted and ( only upper limits in this case ) column densities from the x - rays are consistent with those measured in the uv .",
    "there are , however , kinematic discrepancies that may prevent both absorbers from originating in the same intervening gas .",
    "we put some constraints on the location of the wa assuming that its mass is concentrated in a layer with thickness lower than or equal to the distance to central source .",
    "we derive an upper limit for the distance of high - ionisation phases to the central ionising source of @xmath145  pc , while the low - ionisation phases are located at hundreds of pc .",
    "this is consistent with a scenario in which our line of sight intersects several parts of a stratified wind , each with different ionisation state , density , and velocity , as sketched in @xcite .",
    "the total kinetic luminosity of the outflows injected into the ism of ngc 4593 represents only a tiny fraction of the bolometric luminosity , @xmath135% , where @xmath113 is the solid angle subtended by the outflow .",
    "this is too low to produce any significant impact in the medium of the host galaxy on a single episode of activity , but it may produce small ( but not negligible ) effects when integrated over the whole agn lifetime .",
