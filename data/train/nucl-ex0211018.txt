    "at energy densities larger than @xmath2gev/@xmath3 , matter is expected to undergo a phase transition from a hadronic phase to a quark gluon plasma @xcite .",
    "collisions of heavy nuclei at rhic generate an extended volume of high energy density .",
    "if this density exceeds that required for a phase transition , the evolution of the collision can not be described purely in terms of a hadron gas and the underlying quark and gluon degrees of freedom must be invoked @xcite .",
    "hard scattering of incoming partons generates high @xmath4 partons in the final state that propagate through the medium , eventually fragmenting into a correlated spray of hadrons called a jet .",
    "the high @xmath4 partons interact with the surrounding medium radiating soft gluons at a rate proportional to the energy density of the medium .",
    "measurement of jet energy loss may , therefore , provide a direct probe of the energy density @xcite .",
    "this talk discusses several observables related to energy loss .",
    "a jet may fragment in such a way that one hadron carries a large fraction of its momentum ( leading hadron ) .",
    "the suppression of the yield of leading hadrons may signal jet energy loss .",
    "strong suppression of high @xmath0 hadrons has been observed in central au+au collisions @xcite suggesting the existence of strong in - medium interactions , though the contribution of partonic energy loss is masked by other effects , such as shadowing and initial state multiple scattering ( cronin effect ) @xcite .",
    "additional evidence for strong medium effects comes from the observation of large elliptic flow in non - central collisions in which the high @xmath0 hadron is strongly correlated with the orientation of the reaction plane of the event @xcite .",
    "90 mm     [ fig : spectra ]    neither of the observables listed above proves experimentally that the observed hadrons are indeed the fragments of jets ; for this we utilize two - particle correlations .",
    "near - angle azimuthal two - particle correlations for au+au and p+p collisions are in quantitative agreement @xcite , indicating that hadrons with @xmath1 gev / c stem from the fragmentation of jets .",
    "this study also shows that the fragmentation of the _ observed _ jets is not substantially modified in au+au collisions .",
    "further evidence for the onset of pqcd is the breakdown of the hydrodynamic description of the azimuthal anisotropy @xmath5 above @xmath6 gev / c , for both baryons and mesons . also within the same momentum range",
    ", the measured ratio of anti - protons to protons begins to decrease with increasing momentum .",
    "all of these signatures are expected when the hadronic cross sections at high transverse momentum are dominated by pqcd processes .    the new observable , which directly probes the opacity of the medium , is the comparison of back - to - back azimuthal correlations for au+au and p+p .",
    "while a small suppression is observed in peripheral au+au collisions , central collisions are nearly devoid of back - to - back correlations .",
    "the partons or the hadrons from parton fragmentation that traverse the center of the reaction zone are either suppressed in their yield or lose the memory of their production ( i.e. multiple scatter ) .    a large number of qualitatively new observations are presented for the first time at this conference : single inclusive spectra and @xmath5 to @xmath7 gev / c ; the two - particle azimuthal correlations ; the precision study of non - flow contributions to high @xmath8 ; the meson / baryon @xmath5 ; and identified particle ratios up to 4.5 gev / c . a full description of the physics of high @xmath0 hadron production must accommodate all of these phenomena .",
    "this paper reports the results from data taken with the star detector at @xmath9 = 200 gev during the 2001 rhic run .",
    "the au+au analysis uses 2.7 m minimum bias and 2.1 m central triggered events ( 10  % of the total inelastic au+au cross section ) .",
    "event centrality classes and numbers of participants were determined using the primary charged particle multiplicity within @xmath10 0.5 @xcite .",
    "the p+p data sample used in the two - particle azimuthal correlation analysis consists of 10 m minimum bias events triggered by scintillator counters which cover @xmath11 .",
    "comparison is also made to the au+au data at @xmath9 = 130 gev recorded in the first year of physics running .",
    "charged particle tracks are measured in the tpc , which was operated in a 0.5 tesla magnetic field .",
    "the momentum resolution is @xmath12 3 % at 5 gev / c , a factor of 3 better than in year 2000 , in which the field was half the strength .",
    "particle identification is carried out at high transverse momentum via secondary weak decays in the tpc @xcite and the star - rich @xcite detector for primary particles at @xmath13 1.5 gev .",

    "fig : spectra ] .",
    "the top curve represents the most central event selection , while all other centralities are scaled for clarity .",
    "the spectra are corrected for efficiency , background and momentum resolution @xcite .",
    "the errors indicated include both the statistical and systematic uncertainties , and extend beyond the symbol size only at high momentum .",
    "the onset of suppression of high transverse momentum hadrons in central collisions au+au was recently established in the literature @xcite , however measured in a momentum range ( @xmath15 gev / c ) where soft processes still contribute .",
    "it is essential that these measurements be extended to the highest possible momenta , in order to maximize the hard scattering contribution .",
    "two related measurements have been discussed in the past : @xmath16 , which is the ratio of aa yields to the binary collision scaled nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) reference , and @xmath17 , the ratio of central and peripheral yields normalized by the number of binary collisions ( @xmath18 ) .    at present ,",
    "the nn reference is limited to @xmath15 gev / c and comes from the ua1 experiment @xcite .",
    "@xmath16 at 130 gev is reported in @xcite , while @xmath16 at 200 gev gives similar results . here",

    "calculations of the number of binary collisions @xmath20 and number of participants @xmath21 are discussed in @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : rcp ] shows the ratio of charged hadron yields in central normalized to peripheral collisions , scaled by @xmath22 .",
    "the 200 gev data are represented by solid circles and the previously published 130 gev data @xcite are shown as open symbols with dashed error bars .",
    "the horizontal dashed lines and shaded areas indicate the expectations for scaling with @xmath23 and @xmath21 , together with their respective uncertainties .",
    "the ratio scales approximately with @xmath24 at low transverse momentum , and increases towards binary collision scaling at @xmath252 gev / c . beyond this",
    ", the ratio decreases to 0.23%+-0.06% at 6.4 gev / c for the more peripheral ratio .",
    "the qualitatively new feature of these data is the saturation of the suppression out to a @xmath0 of 12 gev / c .",
    "the hadron production at high transverse momentum does not follow a binary scaling but is roughly consistent with the participant scaling ( @xcite , this proceedings ) .",
    "this will be discussed in more detail at the end of the paper .",
    "90 mm     [ fig : azimuthal ]    in order to address directly the origin of the high @xmath0 hadrons , we search for jet - like correlations using two - particle azimuthal correlations , see also @xcite . from nucleon - nucleon collisions",
    ", it is known that the leading particles in a jet cone have a width in pseudo - rapidity of @xmath26 0.5 . in the au+au case ,",
    "in addition to the jet contribution one expects azimuthal correlations due to elliptic flow , which are not localized in pseudo - rapidity . to extract the jet - specific correlations , we construct two azimuthal correlation functions of high transverse momentum particles for the relative pseudo - rapidity intervals of @xmath270.5 and @xmath28 .",
    "figure [ fig : azimuthal ] shows the two - particle correlation function for a trigger particle in the range 4 @xmath29 6 gev / c and all associated particles in that event from 2 gev / c @xmath30 . the solid and open symbols represent the small and large pseudo - rapidity differences , respectively .",
    "the lower panel shows the difference between the two measurements which should not contain any flow effects but only near - side hard scattering and resonance contributions .",
    "( note that due to the subtraction all back - to - back contributions cancel ) .",
    "the peak at small angular difference is pronounced and is suggestive of jets .",
    "additional studies lead to the conclusion that the cross section for charged hadron production above 4 gev / c is largely due to hard scattering processes . for a more detailed discussion",
    "see @xcite .    in a pqcd model with partonic energy loss , a strong coupling of momentum and",
    "coordinate space is predicted due to high gluon densities .",
    "this effect may be observable in non - central collisions .",
    "hard scattered partons undergo energy loss , whose magnitude depends on the path length of the traversed medium : initial spatial anisotropies are therefore translated into momentum anisotropies . at lower @xmath0 , elliptic flow",
    "@xcite dominates the measurements .",
    "the asymmetry is quantified using the observable @xmath5 , the second fourier component of the azimuthal distribution of high @xmath0 charged tracks with respect to the reaction plane .",
    "the reaction plane in turn is determined by low transverse momentum particles with @xmath31 gev / c .",
    "the detailed presentation can be found in @xcite and references therein . in this paper",
    "only two highlights will be discussed , the @xmath5 at high transverse momentum @xmath32 gev / c and the particle - identified @xmath5 .",
    "90 mm     [ fig:12gev ]    figure [ fig:12gev ] shows @xmath5 for charged hadrons as a function of the transverse momentum up to 12 gev / c for most central events ( 0 - 10% ) , followed by two centrality classes ( 10 - 30% and 30 - 50% ) and minimum - bias events .",

    "the observed anisotropy is finite out to the highest measured transverse momentum , well into the pqcd regime .",
    "the persistence of finite anisotropy at these momenta makes the interpretation in terms of partonic or leading hadron energy loss in an asymmetric geometry rather compelling .",

    "the near - side ratios are shown square symbols , the back - to - back ratio as round symbols , the vertical error bars indicate the statistical error , while the horizontal error bars show the systematic error obtained by varying the @xmath5 contribution by + 5 - 20% .",
    "the near - side ratios increase with the number of participants ( centrality ) , while the back - to - back ratio decreases with @xmath46 . in the most central au+au collisions ,",
    "the near - side correlations are similar to those observed in p+p , while the back - to - back correlation strength is consistent with zero .",

    "the ratio is close to unity .",
    "the inclusive hadron yields grow with @xmath9 , in line with pqcd expectations , while elliptic flow is independent of @xmath9 .",

    "either @xmath20 or @xmath50 can be used to scale @xmath16 .",
    "the superposition of nucleon - nucleon hard scattering in the absence of nuclear effects is constructed by normalizing to the number of binary collisions .",
    "figure 2 of this paper suggests that at high transverse momentum the data do not follow this scaling , but are closer to the @xmath46 normalization .",
    "following the phobos suggestion , we replot the star 130 gev data in figure [ fig : raanpart ] . the ratio @xmath51 of invariant yields measured for au+au collisions to the @xmath52 scaled nn reference for 6 bins in transverse momentum is displayed as a function of the number of participants .",

    "for the tabulated @xmath21 , see @xcite .",
    "the ratios increase significantly with @xmath21 in the 1 - 3 gev / c range .",
    "a qualitatively different picture is seen in the bottom right panel , where the ratio is constant for all centralities .",
    "however , even at high pt scaling with @xmath21 holds only within the au+au dataset and not with respect to the nucleon - nucleon reference .",
    "90 mm         the experimental evidence for hard scattering lies in the fact that the two - particle azimuthal correlations for high @xmath0 hadrons show structures which resemble jet signals , previously established for nucleon - nucleon collisions .",
    "in addition , the anti - proton to proton ratio decreases with increasing @xmath0 , suggesting that particle production at these momenta is dominated by pqcd processes .    the suppression of high @xmath0 hadron inclusive yields in central events with respect to the binary scaled nucleon - nucleon reference is consistent with the suppression of the back - to - back jet signal in the two - particle azimuthal correlations .",
    "this leads to the following hypothesis for central collisions : the strong absorption in the bulk matter means that those jets generated in the center of the collision zone or passing through it are strongly absorbed .",
    "the only jets that are observed are those produced near the surface , directed outwards .",
    "while peripheral collisions appear to be a superposition of nucleon - nucleon collisions , this is not the case for central collisions .",
    "the question whether partonic energy loss has been clearly observed , or whether some effects can be attributed to hadron interactions with the medium , remains to be answered .",
