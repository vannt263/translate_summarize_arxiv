    "the expanding universe , especially if it underwent a primordial inflationary phase @xcite , represents the most powerful probe of small distance scales at our disposal .",
    "present - day astronomical length scales were extremely tiny at early epochs and were sensitive to short - distance physics .",
    "this simple observation has recently generated a lot of excitement about the possibility of opening a window on transplanckian or stringy physics in cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , in the absence of a quantum theory of gravity , uncontrollable nonlinear effects may dominate at transplanckian distances , and the behavior of the cosmological perturbations and crucial related issues such as the definition of the vacuum remain unknown .",
    "this makes it difficult to predict on firm grounds the signatures of transplanckian physics on present - day cosmological scales @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will demonstrate that cosmological perturbations generated during inflation may nevertheless provide a powerful probe of another important aspect of many modern theories of particle physics : the existence of extra dimensions .",
    "the presence of extra dimensions is a crucial ingredient in theories explaining the unification of gravity and gauge forces .",
    "a typical example is string theory , where more than three spatial dimensions are necessary for the consistency of the theory .",
    "it has recently become clear that extra dimensions may be very large and could even be testable in accelerator experiments .    in theories with @xmath3 compactified extra dimensions with typical radii @xmath2 , the four - dimensional planck mass , @xmath4 , is just a derived quantity , while the fundamental scale is the gravitational mass , @xmath5 , of the @xmath6-dimensional theory .",
    "the mass scale @xmath5 is a free parameter and can range from a tev to @xmath4 , with @xmath7 .",
    "the size of extra dimensions can range from macroscopic scales down to planckian distances .",
    "in general there is a large hierarchy between the size of extra dimensions , @xmath2 , and @xmath8 , with @xmath9 .",
    "this means that perturbations that are currently observable on cosmological scales might have been generated at early times on scales much smaller than the size of extra dimensions , but still on scales larger than the fundamental planck mass so that the @xmath10-dimensional einstein equations should describe gravity and the behavior of the quantum vacuum is more certain .",
    "this provides a unique probe of the physics of extra dimensions without the necessity of dealing with unknown effects at energies larger than @xmath5 .",
    "this is particularly relevant in brane - world scenarios where gravity propagates in a higher - dimensional space while our visible universe is a three - dimensional brane in the bulk of extra dimensions @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we initially assume a five - dimensional world where our visible universe is a three - dimensional brane located at a given point in the fifth dimension .",
    "we consider the simplest possibility that inflation is a brane effect , _",
    "i.e. , _ it is driven by a scalar field living on our three - dimensional brane , and study the effects of the transdimensional physics on the spectrum of the primordial density perturbations produced during the epoch of inflation .",
    "our findings indicate that despite the fact that the power spectrum of scalar perturbations remains unchanged , the existence of the fifth dimension is imprinted on the spectrum of gravitational waves generated during inflation .",
    "the tensor spectrum receives a correction proportional to @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the hubble rate during inflation and @xmath2 is the size of the extra dimension .",
    "generalizing our results to the case of more than one extra dimension and to warped geometries , we show that the numerical coefficient of the correction term depends upon the details of the spacetime geometry of the extra dimensions . in four - dimensional single - field models of inflation",
    "there exists a consistency relation relating the amplitude of the scalar perturbations , the amplitude of the tensor perturbations , and the tensor spectral index .",
    "we compute the correction to such a consistency relation from transdimensional physics .",
    "surprisingly enough , we find that at lowest order in the slow roll expansion , the four - dimensional relation is quite robust and does not suffer corrections from extra - dimensional physics , at least in not the cases addressed in this paper .",
    "some similar conclusions have been reached in refs .",
    "@xcite for a particular five - dimensional setup in which the expansion law on the brane has a non - standard expression . instead",
    ", we will focus on the case where the radius of the extra dimension is stabilized , leading to an ordinary friedmann law .",
    "so any effect should be attributed to the non - trivial geometry along the extra dimension , rather than any modified cosmology on the brane . however , the formalism used in ref .",
    "@xcite has many similarities with ours .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we study the five - dimensional background with a stabilized radius . in section iii",
    "we compute the power spectrum of the tensor modes generated during inflation , while in section iv we calculate the power spectrum of scalar perturbations .",
    "section v is devoted to the consistency relation and section vi to a generalization of our findings to more than one extra dimension and to warped geometries .",
    "finally , in section vii we draw our conclusions .",
    "the paper also contains an appendix where we collect the background and perturbed einstein equations .",

    "latin indices ( @xmath18 ) label the ordinary three space dimensions ; greek indices ( @xmath19 ) run over time , the three ordinary spatial dimensions , and the extra dimension @xmath20 ( there is no @xmath21 ) .",
    "the background metric may be taken to be of the form @xmath22 through a redefinition of time we can always impose the condition @xmath23 in order to obtain the familiar equations on the brane , where the induced metric is simply @xmath24 @xcite . in the background metric",
    "there is no time - dependent @xmath25 term multiplying @xmath26 because we assume that the radion is stabilized by some unknown high - energy mechanism , and we are free to set @xmath27 .",
    "then for consistency we must assume that the bulk energy - momentum tensor has a non - vanishing @xmath28 component @xcite that accounts for the radion stabilizing mechanism , while for simplicity we take the other components of the bulk energy - momentum tensor to be zero .",
    "this situation can be achieved by introducing a potential for the radion in the bulk that vanishes at the minimum and whose mass parameter is much larger than the other relevant mass scales .",
    "we will see in the following that our results can be generalized to cases with a non - vanishing bulk cosmological constant and a brane tension ( like in the randall  sundrum framework @xcite ) .",
    "we suppose that the vacuum energy driving inflation is localized on our three - brane at @xmath17 so that the brane energy - momentum tensor provided by the inflaton brane - field @xmath29 is of the form @xmath30 . this might be considered the simplest higher - dimensional scenario to investigate the effects of extra dimensions on cosmological scales",
