    "the asymptotic behavior of the ratio @xmath4 of pauli and dirac electromagnetic nucleon form factors ( ffs ) has recently arised much interest from experimental and theoretical point of view .",
    "the last experimental data in space - like ( sl ) region @xcite , about the momentum transfer squared ( @xmath5 in tl region ] of the ratio of the sachs electric and magnetic ffs , @xmath6 ( @xmath7 is the proton magnetic moment ) , which has been measured with the polarization transfer method @xcite , changed the belief that the qcd asymptotic behavior of @xmath8 @xcite had already been reached for @xmath9 gev@xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the recent data suggested a different behavior of this ratio : @xmath11 . such dependence has been justified in framework of different theoretical approaches @xcite .",
    "another approach , confirming the qcd @xmath12 behavior , discovered the importance of logarithmic corrections , @xmath13 @xcite , where @xmath14 is the soft scale related to the size of the nucleon .",
    "note that the unexpected behavior of the ratio @xmath6 was predicted before the experiment took place , by a particular vdm model @xcite and also in framework of a soliton model @xcite .",
    "the assumption of the analyticity of ffs @xcite allows to connect the nucleon ffs in sl and time - like ( tl ) regions and to study the behavior of the ratio @xmath0 in tl region .",
    "the analyticity of ffs , which has been discussed for example in ref .",
    "@xcite , allows to extend a parametrization of ffs available in one kinematical region to the other kinematical region .",
    "dispersion relation approaches @xcite , which are based essentially on the analytical properties of nucleon electromagnetic ffs , can be considered a powerful tool for the description of the @xmath15 behavior of ffs in the entire kinematical region .",
    "the vdm model @xcite , after appropriate treatment of the @xmath16 contribution , can be also extrapolated from the sl region to the tl region @xcite .",
    "the quark - gluon string model @xcite allowed firstly to find the @xmath15 dependence of the electromagnetic ffs in tl region , in a definite analytical form , which can be continued in the sl region .",
    "one of the problems concerning ffs of pions and nucleons is the large difference in the absolute values in sl and tl regions .",
    "for example , at @xmath17=18 gev@xmath10 , the largest value at which proton tl ffs have been measured @xcite , the corresponding values in tl and sl regions differ by a factor of two .",
    "the analyticity of ffs allows to apply the phragmn - lindelf theorem @xcite which gives a rigorous prescription for the asymptotic behavior of analytical functions : @xmath18 this means that , asymptotically , ffs have the following constraints :    1 .",
    "the imaginary part of ffs , in tl region , vanishes : @xmath19 as @xmath20 ; 2 .",
    "the real part of ffs , in tl region , coincides with the corresponding value in sl region : @xmath21= f_i^{(sl)}(t ) [ t\\to -\\infty ] $ ] , because ffs are real functions in sl region , due to the hermiticity of the corresponding electromagnetic hamiltonian .",
    "the existing experimental data violate the phragmn - lindelf theorem , even at @xmath22 values as large as 18 gev@xmath10 @xcite . in order to test the two requirements stated above",
    ", the knowledge of the differential cross section for @xmath23 is not sufficient , and polarization phenomena have to be studied also . in this respect ,",
    "t - odd polarization observables , which are determined by @xmath24 , are especially interesting .",
    "the simplest of these observables is the @xmath1 component of the proton polarization in @xmath25 that in general does not vanish , even in collisions of unpolarized leptons @xcite , or the asymmetry of leptons produced in @xmath26 , in the collision of unpolarized antiprotons with a transversally polarized proton target ( or in the collision of transversally polarized antiprotons on an unpolarized proton target ) @xcite .",
    "these observables are especially sensitive to different possible parametrizations of the ratio @xmath27 , suggested by qcd and vdm models .",
    "calculations have been done up to @xmath28 40 gev@xmath10 and show that the @xmath1 component remains large in absolute value @xcite .",
    "for example , qcd inspired parametrizations , which fit reasonably well the data in the sl region , predict @xmath29 35% up to @xmath28 40 gev@xmath10 .",
    "such behavior has to be considered an indication that the corresponding asymptotics are very far , in agreement with the estimations of the quark - gluon string model @xcite and vdm approach @xcite .",
    "note another important property of qcd inspired predictions for nucleon ffs : the corresponding @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 ( @xmath33 is the nucleon mass ) , either vanish or have a definite sign in the tl region .",
    "the previously quoted parametrizations can not apply in the whole tl region : the asymptotic pqcd behavior follows @xmath34 and @xmath35 at large @xmath22 , according to the quark counting rules @xcite .",
    "the superconvergent conditions : @xmath36 has to be satisfied , where the lower limit corresponds to @xmath37 , for isovector ffs , and @xmath38 for isoscalar ffs , where @xmath39 is the pion mass .",
    "this implies that the nonzero qcd - contribution to eq .",
    "( [ eq : eq2 ] ) has to be compensated by the corresponding non - perturbative contribution of opposite sign .",
    "we can expect that such contribution mainly arises from the special region of @xmath22 : @xmath40 , which is unphysical for the process @xmath41 .",
    "the contribution from the different vector mesons ( with different masses ) is expected to be very important here .",
    "we can say that the superconvergent condition ( [ eq : eq2 ] ) can be interpreted as a manifestation of the special duality between pqcd , from one side , and the vector meson contribution , from another side @xcite . in principle",
    "such duality is similar to the well known gilman - bloom duality @xcite , concerning the electromagnetic properties of the nucleons in sl region , when the deep inelastic electron nucleon scattering is dual to the excitation of different nucleonic resonances in @xmath42 .",
    "also one can mention the duality in hadron physics relating the high energy behavior of the amplitudes of hadron - hadron scattering , from one side , to the resonance physics , on the other side .",
    "returning to the unphysical region , @xmath40 , we recall , for completeness , that another interesting physical effect has to be taken into account here : a specific @xmath43 bound states , or even gluon states with @xmath44 quantum numbers . and",
    ", due to the analyticity of ffs , these effects should appear in the sl region of momentum transfer , and should be correlated with the asymptotic behavior of ffs .",
    "our main aim here is to discuss the asymptotic behavior of the existing parametrizations for @xmath0 in tl region , from the point of view of the phragmn - lindelf theorem .",
    "in particular we will analyze the behavior of @xmath45 , its convergence to zero and study more particularly the asymptotic behavior of the @xmath1-component of the proton polarization in @xmath46 , which contains equivalent information . for completeness we will also consider the behavior of the ratio @xmath47 which should converge asymptotically to one , following the phragmn - lindelf theorem .    in order to have a quantitative estimation of the corresponding value of the relevant variable",
    ", we will use the following prescription , from ref .",

    "the value at which this condition is met is the solution of the equation @xmath50 ' ' _ .",
    "for the cases considered here , this definition translates into the following three equations , we take @xmath51 . ] : @xmath52 where we will take @xmath53 and @xmath54 in order to characterize the deviations from the asymptotic predictions of the phragmn - lindelf theorem .    for this aim , we use the following three different parametrizations , which apply in the sl region : @xmath55 @xmath56 \\displaystyle\\frac{ln^2(-t/\\lambda^2)}{(-t)}\\mbox{~with~ } \\lambda=0.3\\mbox{~gev } \\mbox{~from~ref.~ \\protect\\cite{be02 } } ,   \\label{eq : eq6}\\ ] ] and the vdm inspired parametrization from ref .",

    "ii we analyze the @xmath22-behavior of the imaginary part of the @xmath0 ratio for different approaches , and estimate the corresponding value of @xmath22 for deviations of the order of @xmath75 from the expected asymptotic values .",
    "then we give the expressions for the polarization observables accessible through the reaction @xmath76 in terms of the ratio @xmath0 and analyze in particular the @xmath1 component of the proton polarization , which depends on the imaginary part of this ratio ( section iii ) . in section",
    "iv we study how the ratio @xmath77 approaches to one , that is the expected value for the asymptotic regime .",
    "let us recall here the definition of the phragmn - lindelf theorem , which will be the basis of the following discussion .",
    "following @xcite : _ if @xmath78 as @xmath79 along a straight line , and @xmath80 as @xmath79 along another straight line , and @xmath48 is regular and bounded in the angle between , then @xmath81 and @xmath82 uniformly in the angle\"_. for the problem considered here , we identify the variable @xmath83 with the momentum transfer squared @xmath22 .",
    "so one of these straight lines can be chosen along the @xmath84-axis , in the positive direction ( in the complex @xmath83-plane ) , i.e. , for @xmath22 values corresponding to the tl region , and the other line with negative @xmath84 direction , with @xmath22 in the sl region . assuming the analyticity of ffs , @xmath85 , @xmath32 ,",
    "in the upper part of the @xmath83-plane , we satisfy the necessary conditions for the application of the phragmn - lindelf theorem , for all nucleon ffs , @xmath86 .",
    "more exactly , it holds also for the four independent ffs @xmath87 and @xmath88 , where the upper indices @xmath89 or @xmath90 correspond to isoscalar or isovector electromagnetic ffs of the nucleon . note that the analytical properties of @xmath85 , @xmath32 , should be discussed namely for the isoscalar and the isovector ffs , and not for proton and neutron , because the unitarity conditions ( which allow to calculate the imaginary part of ffs ) have the simplest and most transparent form for the isotopic ffs .",
    "more exactly , isoscalar(isovector ) ffs are determined by intermediate states with odd(even ) number of pions .",
    "so , finally , one can write the following four independent relations : @xmath91 as a consequence of the phragmn - lindelf theorem .",
    "this theorem has other applications in particle physics , such as , for example , the well known theorem of pomeranchuk @xcite , concerning the asymptotic behavior of the total cross sections for @xmath92 and @xmath93 collisions ( @xmath94 and @xmath95 any hadrons ) : @xmath96 .",
    "however , to be rigorous , the applicability of this theorem to ffs , which seems evident , has not been proved up to now .",
    "unfortunately , this theorem does not allow to indicate the physical value of @xmath22 , starting from which it is working at some level of precision .",
    "for this aim one needs some additional dynamical information .    in our considerations about nucleon electromagnetic ffs ,",
    "such information is contained in the parametrizations of ffs .",
    "more precisely , we discuss the ratio @xmath0 for the proton and use those parametrizations which work well in the sl region , where the available precise experimental data allow to constrain the necessary parameters .",
    "it is possible to continue analytically such parametrizations to the tl region , using the following prescription @xcite : @xmath97 evidently , the choice of sign for the imaginary part , whereas in ref .",
    "@xcite the formula @xmath98 has been applied for the analytical continuation from sl to tl region . ] , in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eq4 ] ) , results in strong physical consequences concerning the calculations of any t - odd polarization observable for @xmath99 .",
    "let us firstly discuss the @xmath22-behavior of @xmath45 in tl region , using the qcd inspired and vdm parametrizations .",
    "following the phragmn - lindelf theorem , the ratio @xmath100 should converge to zero as @xmath101 . and",
    "the value of @xmath22 , corresponding to the solution of the equation : @xmath102 , @xmath103 characterizes how @xmath104 approaches to zero .",
    "after analytical continuation in tl region , one can see that parametrization ( [ eq : eq5 ] ) gives @xmath105 , because it reduces in tl region to : @xmath106 such parametrization definitely contradicts the phragmn - lindelf theorem because both form factors can not be real at the same time .",
    "this situation is not changed , after a modification suggested to normalize ffs at @xmath107 @xcite : @xmath108^{-1/2},\\ ] ] where @xmath109 is the proton anomalous magnetic moment .",
    "parametrization ( [ eq : eq6 ] ) results in the following formula for the relative size of the imaginary to the real part @xmath104 : @xmath110 which implies @xmath111 , if @xmath101 , but very slowly .",
    "quantitatively , the condition @xmath102 has two solutions : @xmath112 for the @xmath113 solution , which should be considered as the physical solution for the tl region , we obtain : @xmath114 which represents a very large energy , not far from the planck scale , @xmath115 gev .",
    "this last value corresponds to a deviation of 6.5% from the expected asymptotical zero value .    in the model @xcite , the isoscalar ffs , @xmath116 , are real in all the kinematical range .",
    "only the isovector ffs , @xmath117 , have non vanishing imaginary part , induced by the @xmath16-meson contribution , which is , however , one order of magnitude smaller than the real part .",
    "the individual ffs are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "a singularity appears in the tl region , for all ffs , due to the dipole term and in @xmath118 , due to a compensation of the @xmath119 and @xmath120 contributions .",

    "such asymptotic behavior leads to @xmath75=0.1(0.05 ) for @xmath126 gev , again very far from the region experimentally accessible .",
    "note that the contribution which is linear in logarithm as well as the constant terms in the denominator are important , as they are responsible for the zero of @xmath127 at @xmath128 , which results in a number larger than the asymptotic value .",
    "recently , the model @xcite has been modified with respect to a common factor for all ffs @xcite : @xmath129 where @xmath130 has been taken equal to 53@xmath131 and @xmath132=0.25 gev@xmath70 .",
    "this term moves the corresponding singularity @xmath133 to @xmath134 gev@xmath10 from the physical region of tl momentum transfer .",
    "such factor does not modify polarization phenomena as it cancels out .",
    "however , such substitution has some shortcomings as it violates the schwartz reflection symmetry , in the following relation : @xmath135 , and does not satisfy the phragmn - lindelf theorem , because this factor induces : @xmath136 , i.e. , a nonzero value in the asymptotic region .",
    "let us analyze the polarization observables related to the process @xmath25 and their asymptotic behavior for the considered parametrizations of @xmath0 . as the @xmath137 dependence is not relevant for the following considerations , for the numerical calculations we take @xmath138 .",
    "the @xmath137 dependence is well known in framework of one photon exchange @xcite , therefore , its measurement can be useful to check the validity of this mechanism at large @xmath15 .",

    "the observable @xmath1 , which contains the imaginary part of the ffs ratio , can bring information for the comparison of sl and tl asymptotic behavior .    the following formula for @xmath1 , at @xmath144 , holds for the parametrization ( [ eq : eq5 ] ) : @xmath145 this parametrization results in non vanishing ( negative ) asymptotics @xmath1 , with large absolute value , in contradiction with the phragmn - lindelf theorem .",
    "the behavior of @xmath1 for @xmath146 can be approximated by : @xmath147 this implies that a 10%(5% ) difference from asymptotics appears at @xmath148    for the logarithmic parametrization ( [ eq : eq6 ] ) , the asymptotic behavior of @xmath1 is described by : @xmath149 one can see that the absolute value decreases with @xmath22 , and one finds @xmath150%(-5)% at @xmath151 gev@xmath10 , still too large to be achieved by experiments .    finally , the asymptotic behavior of the @xmath1 polarization in the model @xcite can be described by the following formula : @xmath152 ^ 2}\\to   \\displaystyle\\frac { 13.5}{\\sqrt{\\tau } ln^2   ( \\sqrt{t}/m_{\\pi})}\\ ] ] with a faster decreasing with @xmath22 .",
    "note that this polarization is positive in tl region .",
    "moreover the constant term in the denominator is important at large @xmath22 , for example , a value of @xmath1=0.02 is reached at @xmath153 gev@xmath10 , which corresponds to very far asymptotics .    for the cases discussed above",
    ", the large value of @xmath154 arises questions about the asymptotic trend of electromagnetic ffs . according to the prescriptions of phragmn - lindelf theorem ,",
    "@xmath1 should vanish .",
    "we mentioned above that the measured values of the magnetic proton ffs are different in tl and sl regions of momentum transfer , up to @xmath155 gev@xmath10 , where the tl values of @xmath156 exceed by a factor of two the corresponding values in sl region .",
    "these values should approach the same number at asymptotic values of @xmath22 .",
    "but which number ?",
    "let us analyze the behavior of @xmath157 in tl region , using , again , the considered parametrizations .",
    "the parametrization ( [ eq : eq5 ] ) gives @xmath158 , at any value of @xmath22 .",
    "furthermore , this parametrization gives a specific behavior of the ratio @xmath159 in tl region .",
    "one finds : @xmath160 note , in this respect , that up to now the separation of the electric and magnetic contributions to the differential cross section in the tl region has not been realized , yet .",
    "the analysis of the experimental data is currently based on two assumptions : either @xmath161 or @xmath162 .",
    "the extracted values for @xmath163 according to these prescriptions differ at most by 20% .",
    "however , eq . ( [ eq : eqa ] ) suggests another possible relation between @xmath164 and @xmath163 , that leads to comparable contributions of the electric and magnetic terms to the cross section , independently on the @xmath22-value .",
    "the resulting value for @xmath163 is 10% lower than the value corresponding to @xmath162 , and still does not compensate the observed difference of ffs in sl and tl regions .",
    "the parametrization ( [ eq : eq6 ] ) gives the following relation : @xmath165 a deviation of @xmath77 from 1 by 10%(5% ) is reached at @xmath166 gev .",
    "we have analyzed the asymptotic behavior of recently suggested , pqcd inspired , parametrizations of the ratio of the dirac and pauli ffs , @xmath0 .",
    "we have based our study on the requirements given by phragmn - lindelf theorem , in particular the equality of ffs in sl and tl regions .",
    "as ffs are real in sl region and complex in tl region , this implies that the imaginary part of ffs in tl region vanishes , as well as the polarization of the emitted proton , in the annihilation reaction @xmath23 ( when the colliding particles are unpolarized ) .",
    "we have shown that the considered parametrizations do not satisfy the asymptotic conditions suggested by the phragmn - lindelf theorem or they do so only for very large values of @xmath15 , well beyond the experimentally accessible range .",
    "in particular , the @xmath167 behavior of this ratio , which reproduces the recent measurements in the sl region , is certainly not compatible with an asymptotic regime , showing that the presently measurable data should be better interpreted in frame of classical nucleon degrees of freedom .    concerning the double logarithmic parametrization ,",
    "it has been pointed out long ago @xcite , that a suppression to sudakov type contributions could take place .",
    "the dipole - like formulas for ffs do satisfy the phragmn - lindelf theorem .",
    "but such parametrization has the following evident problems :    * the threshold condition : @xmath168 is not satisfied , * the unitarity conditions for all nucleon ffs are strongly violated , as one should have a branching point at @xmath169 for isovector ffs and @xmath170 for isoscalar ffs , * the prediction in tl region underestimates the experimental data .",
    "the analytical continuation of nucleon electromagnetic ffs , presently used to describe the main properties of nucleon structure in sl region of momentum transfer squared ( in some models ) , results as a rule , in an essential imaginary part in tl region .",
    "moreover , the relative value ( with respect to the real part ) is a very slowly decreasing function of @xmath22 . such behavior , of course , is in agreement with the phragmn - lindelf theorem , but the corresponding asymptotic regime corresponds to very large values of @xmath22 .",
    "the asymptotic regime defined by the prescriptions of the considered models and the asymptotic properties derived from the analyticity of form factors act at a different level .",
    "phragmn - lindelf theorem defines the asymptotic conditions without direct connection with qcd .",
    "the most evident application of the phragmn - lindelf theorem in physics is the pomeranchuk theorem - which relates the asymptotic behavior of the total cross section for @xmath171 and @xmath172 interaction .",
    "this is not qcd regime , because such theorem applies for @xmath107 , i.e. , to evidently non perturbative physics , despite the fact that the mandelstam variable @xmath173 is very large .",
    "so the connection between qcd asymptotics and asymptotics from phragmn - lindelf theorem , from the point of view of hadron ffs is non trivial , as this theorem seems to work for elastic @xmath171 and @xmath172 amplitudes in the kinematical region where qcd does not apply .",
