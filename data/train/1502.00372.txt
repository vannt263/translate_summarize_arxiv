    "this is traced to the fact that @xmath10 has the extra factor @xmath127 as compared with @xmath9 where we have , for simplicity , neglected renormalizations as these do not change the argument in an important way .",

    "the corresponding boson structures in the real part of the dynamic longitudinal optical conductivity @xmath143 which is more closely related to a convolution of two dos factors and is given in eq .",

    "we calculated the effect of electron - phonon coupling on a system of helical gapped dirac fermions .",
    "a simple holstein model with coupling to a single einstein phonon of energy @xmath41 was used . for massive dirac fermions",
    "two self energies need to be introduced",
    ". there is the familiar quasiparticle renormalizarion which changes the bare band energies to dressed dispersion curves and provides damping .",
    "in addition there is a second self energy directly associated with modifications of the gap .",
    "it is energy ( @xmath18 ) dependent and complex with the real part directly modulating the magnitude of the bare band gap .",
    "both these self energies enter the quasipaticle spectral density @xmath83 with @xmath71 momentum @xmath18 energy and @xmath34 giving conduction and valence band respectively . in direct analogy ,",
    "a second spectral density @xmath152 associated with the gap channel is also introduced .",
    "the first function @xmath83 can be measured directly in angular resolved photo - emission spectroscopy ( arpes ) .",
    "its average over momentum @xmath71 determines the electronic density of states @xmath11 measured in scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( stm ) .",
    "the second @xmath152 enters along with @xmath83 the expressions for the dynamic longitudinal optical conductivity .",
    "it also determines the out of plane spin texture .",
    "both @xmath167 and @xmath12 are functions of @xmath18 and are encoded with sharp phonon structures at @xmath142 and @xmath134 .",
    "these phonon structures manifest directly in the density of states and in a somewhat different way in the optical conductivity .",
    "the out of plane and in plane spin textures are modified by the electron - phonon interaction . but",
    "these quantities involve an integration over energy of an overlap of spectral density and thermal factor .",
    "consequently the manifestation of phonon - electron coupling in these quantities is more subtle and not as direct .",
    "nevertheless important corrections to a bare band picture arise . just as the probability of occupation of a state of momentum @xmath71",
    "is reduced from one for @xmath71 less than @xmath151 , and extended ( in momentum ) tails appear for @xmath166 , the magnitude of @xmath77 follows the same trend .",
    "a similar picture applies for the magnitude of the in plane spin component .",
    "while the spin remains locked in the direction perpendicular to momentum , correlation tails appear beyond @xmath163 . while the calculations are for the explicit case of the electron - phonon interaction , they serve to illustrate how many body interactions in general modify the bare band picture .",
    "this work was supported by the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada ( nserc ) and the canadian institute for advanced research ( cifar ) .",
