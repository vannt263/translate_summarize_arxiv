    "abelian dominance and monopole dominance in ma gauge suggest the existence of an effective monopole action also in @xmath0 qcd .",
    "there are two independent ( three with one constraint @xmath1 ) currents in the case of @xmath0 .",
    "applying the same inverse monte - carlo method developed in the case of @xmath2 qcd@xcite , we have derived the infrared effective monopole action starting from the vacuum ensemble \\{@xmath3 } defined from the thermalized abelian link fields after the ma abelian projection@xcite .",
    "effective monopole actions can be derived similarly for the blocked monopole currents @xmath4@xcite .",
    "this corresponds to the block - spin transformation of the monopole currents on the dual lattice .",
    "the form of the action is restricted to 27 two - point interactions up to @xmath5 distance between monopole currents and the most leading 4 and 6 point interactions .",
    "the lattice size is @xmath6 for @xmath7 .",
    "the results are as follow :    1 .",
    "the monopole actions are fixed clearly when we pay attention to two independent monopole currents : @xmath8 as well as one kind of monopole currents : @xmath9 .",
    "2 .   the scaling @xmath10 for fixed @xmath11 looks good both for one - current and two - current cases . ( fig.[g1 ] ) 3 .",
    "monopole condensation occurs in the large @xmath12 region .",
    "entropy dominates over the energy : ln7@xmath13 in the one - current case .",
    "( fig.[g1 ] ) 4 .",
    "the quadratic monopole actions are dominant for large @xmath12 in both cases .",
    "= 0.4    in the infrared regions , quadratic monopole interactions are dominant .",
    "when we restrict ourselves to quadratic monopole interactions alone , the block - spin transformation can be done analytically as done in @xmath2 qcd@xcite .",
    "we can obtain also the perfect operator to evaluate the static quark - antiquark potential @xmath14 on the coarse @xmath12 lattice .    in the framework of the string model ,",
    "the quantum effects are seen to be small in the infrared region and the static potential is evaluated by the classical contributions alone : @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the source term corresponding to the wilson loop .",
    "we get the rotational invariance @xmath18 and @xmath19 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are dimensional constants parametrizing the monopole action on the fine @xmath22 lattice .",
    "@xmath23 is equivalent to the result from dgl theory@xcite .",
    "abelian and monopole dominances are shown numerically in ma gauge .",
    "however , monopole condensation after abelian projection in some gauges _ can not explain color confinement_. abelian neutral but color non - singlet states are not confined .",
    "* gauge independence of monopole condensation is essential for color confinement . * here we prove the gauge independence of the monopole dominance if abelian dominance is gauge independent .",
    "first we note that abelian wilson loops without any gauge fixing are known to give the same string tension @xcite as that from non - abelian wilson loops in the strong coupling expansion .",
    "recently , ogilivie@xcite proved the same fact for any @xmath24 using the character expansion@xcite .",
    "abelian dominance comes from the elitzur s theorem@xcite and then it must be gauge independent .",
    "abelian dominance leads us to abelian effective action .",
    "we express the abelian action in terms of the villain form @xmath25}.$ ] the general villain action can be expressed as follows : @xmath26 } \\\\ & & \\hspace*{-.5cm}=e^{-f^{'}[-i\\delta/\\delta b ] } { \\rm e}^{-(d\\theta + 2\\pi n , d(d\\theta + 2\\pi n ) )            + i(b , d\\theta + 2\\pi n)}\\bigg|_{b=0},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27=[d,\\delta]=0 $ ] are satisfied in the large @xmath24 scaling region .    the abelian wilson loop @xmath28 is estimated with this action , where @xmath29 is the electric current .",
    "when we use the bkt transformation@xcite , we get an action in terms of monopole currents : @xmath30}\\sum_{k\\in { \\bf z } , dk=0 } { \\rm e}^{-\\frac{1}{4 } ( \\delta b , ( \\delta d ) ^{-1 }    \\delta b ) } \\\\ & & { \\rm e}^{\\frac{1}{2 } ( i b , 4\\pi \\delta \\delta^{-1}k + i   ( \\delta d ) ^{-1 } dj ) }   { \\rm e}^{-4\\pi^{2 } ( k , \\delta^{-1}d   k ) } \\\\ & & { \\rm e}^{2\\pi i ( \\delta \\delta^{-1}k , s ) } { \\rm e}^{- \\frac{1}{4 } ( j , ( \\delta d ) ^{-1 } j ) } \\bigg|_{b=0 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] 1)electric - electric current @xmath31 interactions ( with no monopole @xmath32 ) come from the exchange of regular photons and have no line singularity leading to a linear potential .",
    "hence the linear potential of abelian wilson loops is due to the monopole contribution alone .",
    "* monopole dominance is proved from abelian dominance . *",
    "2)the linear potential comes only from @xmath33 .",
    "the surface independence of the static potential is assured due to the 4-d linking number .",
    "to confirm the above results numerically , we analyze gauge dependence of abelian projection by langevin equation with stochastic gauge fixing term@xcite , @xmath34 where @xmath35 is fictious time , @xmath36 is gaussian white noise and @xmath37 is gauge fixing term .",
    "@xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) corresponds to the ma gauge fixing ( no gauge fixing ) .      as a first test",
    ", we perform numerical simulations on a @xmath45 lattice with @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 . we show the abelian heavy quark potentials for different @xmath49 in fig.[pot - abel ] together with that of non - abelian potential , which are essentially same from @xmath38 to 2.5 , and show the confinement linear potential behavior .",
    "note that the string tension obtained by the standard gauge fixing procedure is larger than that of @xmath38 .",
    "this is probably due to the gribov copies@xcite .",
    "bali et al .",
    "@xcite have observed that when the number of copies decreases the string tension becomes small .",
    "this is very consistent with our data .",
