    "wavelength solutions were determined using the oh night sky emission lines in each order ; 4@xmath75 oh lines across each of the orders used yielded wavelength solutions with typical uncertainties of better than 0.4 km  s@xmath1 .",

    "furthermore , an additional advantage of these particular orders is the absence of terrestrial absorption lines , thus avoiding the necessity of division by a featureless telluric standard star .",
    "this provided the optimal approach for several reasons : ( 1 ) eliminating division by telluric standards maximized the signal - to - noise ratio and avoided the possible introduction of slightly offset spectra and potential small shifts in the brown dwarf absorption lines and hence rv measurements , ( 2 ) focusing on the narrowest and deepest lines available yielded the highest possible rv precision ; although the ki lines in orders 61 and 65 are deep ( e.g. , mclean et al .",
    "2007 ) , their breadth is unfavorable to precision rv measurements through cross - correlation , and ( 3 ) selecting orders 62 and 59 further guaranteed the best possible rv precision given the regular spacing of the oh night sky emission lines across both of these orders , required for a superior dispersion solution ; this condition was not met for all orders in our j band setting .",
    "multiple - epoch sequences for the l2 dwarf kelu-1 and the peculiar t6p dwarf 2m0937 are shown in figures 3 and 4 , respectively .",
    "rice et al . ( 2010 ) found typical systematic rv uncertainties of 1@xmath72 km  s@xmath1 for a sample observed with a similar methodology , similar signal to noise , and with some overlap in target data with this paper ( table 2 ) .",
    "we thus adopt a conservative 2 km  s@xmath1 internal uncertainty for our rvs .",

    "2010 ) , an l4 dwarf , for which we obtained 7 epochs over more than 5 years .",
    "the maximum rv shift between epochs was 1.91 km  s@xmath1 ; the standard deviation in the rv shift for all epochs was 0.59 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "thus 2 km  s@xmath1 provides a reasonable if conservative internal uncertainty on individual rv measurements .",
    "at least two , and as many as seven , spectra were taken for each of our targets .",
    "we tested for radial velocity variability by cross - correlating the highest signal - to - noise spectrum against the spectra from all other epochs for a given target ; no significant variability was detected (  4 ) .",
    "table 2 lists the number of spectra taken for each object ( column 2 ) and the total number of days spanned by the observations ( column 3 ) .",
    "rvs ( column 4 ) were either taken from blake et al .",
    "( 2010 ) or determined by cross - correlation of the highest signal - to - noise spectrum for a particular object with spectra of objects with known rv ( from blake et al . ) and similar spectral type , sometimes of type both earlier and later than our target .",
    "the rvs resulting from cross - correlation of a target with more than one other object were averaged and the standard deviation added in quadrature with the internal uncertainties in the radial velocity measurements .",
    "this result in most cases was dominated by the 2 km  s@xmath1 internal uncertainty ; however , for a few objects , primarily the fainter and thus lower signal to noise late t dwarfs , this procedure resulted in an uncertainty of 3 km  s@xmath1 ( table 2 ) .",

    "( 2010 ) when available because of their unprecedented precision , obtained by fitting models to near - ir k - band co bandhead at @xmath02.3 @xmath15 m target spectra .",
    "the models are composed of synthetic template spectra plus observed telluric spectra ; the co bandhead region of the telluric spectrum is rich in deep ch@xmath25 lines that provide a wavelength dispersion and zero - point reference with a precision as good as a few tens of m / s .",
    "small iterations of the rv shift between the synthetic photospheric spectra and the telluric spectra allow for high accuracy in the target rv measurements .",

    "the results are summarized in figure 5 .",
    "the most important factor impacting the probability of detecting a potential binary was the frequency of observation for a given target ( table 2 ) .",

    "the detection probability for an 0.1 au binary fails to reach 90% for _ any _ of our sources . using the probabilities of detection for separations greater than a given threshold @xmath30 , @xmath31 , as a measure of the effective sample size , @xmath32",

    "these limits apply when we consider the detectability of individual systems .",
    "however , a signature of unresolved multiplicity could also emerge in higher velocity dispersions for the sample as a whole .",
    "identifying higher dispersions across the sample requires robust determination of the individual measurement uncertainties , but we can perform a rough assessment as follows . using the same simulation parameters , we calculated the distribution of velocity dispersions one would obtain if a given fraction of sources ( randomly selected ) were binaries with semi - major axes in logarithmically spaced bins . for a sample devoid of binaries ,",
    "the mean dispersion is somewhat less than the adopted measurement uncertainty , about 1.75  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "sources with radial orbital motion drive the mean velocity dispersions of the sample higher .",

    "thus , ample parameter space for a bright binary companion to this object remains unexplored and our confidence in a null result for a companion object is only high ( @xmath4590% ) for extremely short periods of days or less . monitoring this system with extremely precise rv measurements ( see next section ) with regular cadence over a considerable time baseline will help to fill in the potential binary parameter space gap and might also provide insight into the atmospheric properties .      for spectroscopic binary systems ,",

    "thus as far as it is possible to say with the extant data , very low mass spectroscopic binaries are not necessarily intrinsically rare , but even with one of the largest samples available , statistics show (  4.1 ) that 2 km  s@xmath1 uncertainties provide relatively weak constraints .",
    "we obtained multiple - epoch spectra of a sample of 25 very low - mass field dwarfs , three m dwarfs , sixteen l dwarfs , and six t dwarfs , between 2000 april and 2011 june to search for rv variability and spectral evidence for multiple components . with a precision of @xmath02 km  s@xmath1",

    "no significant variations are seen in these or the other target spectra , some of which boast an exquisite s / n ratio in excess of 100 .",
    "rv measurements of brown dwarfs are important both for the ultimate measurement of brown dwarf masses ( konopacky et al .",
    "2010 ) and for the spectroscopic detection of very low - mass , even planetary , companions to presumed single brown dwarfs ( blake et al . 2010 ) .",
    "the close binary fraction of very low mass systems is highly uncertain ( e.g. , bardalez gagliuffi et al .",
    "we conclude with the observation that to satisfy these scientific goals requires high s",
    "/ n ratio , strategic sampling cadence , and relatively high precision measurements : with the 200 m  s@xmath1 precision of blake et al . , it is possible to detect several - jupiter mass companions even in orbits of decades ( bottom panel , figure 7 ) .",

    "<S> we present paper six of the nirspec brown dwarf spectroscopic survey , an analysis of multi - epoch , high - resolution ( r@xmath020,000 ) spectra of 25 field dwarf systems ( 3 late - type m dwarfs , 16 l dwarfs , and 6 t dwarfs ) taken with the nirspec infrared spectrograph at the w. m. keck observatory . with a radial velocity precision of @xmath02 km  s@xmath1 , we are sensitive to brown dwarf companions in orbits with periods of a few years or less given a mass ratio of 0.5 or greater </S>",
    "<S> . we do not detect any spectroscopic binary brown dwarfs in the sample . </S>",
    "<S> given our target properties , and the frequency and cadence of observations , we use a monte carlo simulation to determine the detection probability of our sample . </S>",
    "<S> even with a null detection result , our 1 @xmath2 upper limit for very low mass binary frequency is 18% . </S>",
    "<S> our targets included 7 known , wide brown dwarf binary systems . </S>",
    "<S> no significant radial velocity variability was measured in our multi - epoch observations of these systems , even for those pairs for which our data spanned a significant fraction of the orbital period . </S>",
    "<S> specialized techniques are required to reach the high precisions sensitive to motion in orbits of very low - mass systems . for eight objects , including six t dwarfs , we present the first published high - resolution spectra , many with high signal to noise , that will provide valuable comparison data for models of brown dwarf atmospheres . </S>"
