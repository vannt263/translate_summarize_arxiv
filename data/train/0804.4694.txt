    "the goal of this paper is to use the burau matrix of a @xmath2-braid to determine whether the corresponding homeomorphism @xmath3 is right - veering , left - veering , or neither . in section 1 ,",

    "finally , in section 3 , we prove the following main theorems that allow us to determine a @xmath2-braid s action on the generators of the @xmath2-punctured disk by consideration of their geometric intersection with arcs @xmath4 that start and end at the punctures .",
    "[ main ] given a 3-braid @xmath1 and its matrix @xmath5 in the image of the unreduced burau representation , we can determine the geometric intersection number @xmath6 of @xmath7 and @xmath8 from the entries of @xmath9 for each @xmath10 .",

    "the braid group @xmath18 can be defined as the group generated by @xmath19 with relations :    1 .",
    "@xmath20 if @xmath21 , and 2 .",
    "@xmath22 if @xmath23 .",
    "the braid group can also be described as a subgroup of the automorphism group of a free group or as a group of geometric objects up to isotopy . in this paper",
    "we will use the interpretation of @xmath18 as the mapping class group of the space @xmath24 , where @xmath24 is the unit disk in @xmath25 with the set @xmath26 of @xmath27 interior points of @xmath28 ( assumed to lie regularly spaced on the x - axis ) excised .",
    "we call these points _",
    "punctures_. we define the @xmath27-braid @xmath29 to be @xmath30 the square of @xmath29 generates the infinite cyclic center of @xmath18 . as a mapping class , @xmath31 is a full positive dehn twist about a curve parallel to @xmath32 .",
    "we denote @xmath33 as @xmath34 throughout this paper .",
    "let @xmath35 be a genus one surface with one boundary component .",
    "we will make use of the fact that the group @xmath0 is isomorphic to the relative mapping class group of @xmath35 , denoted here as @xmath36 .",
    "this isomorphism is given by sending generators @xmath37 to positive dehn twists @xmath38 about dual closed curves @xmath39 and @xmath40 in @xmath35 .",
    "we will also rely on the homomorphism @xmath41 in the short exact sequence    @xmath42 & { \\mathbb z}\\ar[r ] & b_3\\ar[r]^{\\psi } & sl_2({\\mathbb z})\\ar[r ] & 1 . } \\ ] ]    by consideration of the representation onto @xmath43 , we use the thurston classification of surface diffeomorphisms ( which can be found in @xcite ) to determine whether a braid representative @xmath3 is periodic , reducible , or pseudo - anosov .",
    "we do this simply by calculating the trace .",
    "say @xmath44 is the image of @xmath3 under @xmath41 . if @xmath45 , then @xmath3 is reducible . if @xmath46 , @xmath3 is periodic . finally , if @xmath47 , @xmath3 is pseudo - anosov .",
    "we move forward using this classification to identify right - veering braids , however , first we must address the question of what a right - veering braid is .      throughout ,",

    "let @xmath49 and @xmath1 be smooth properly embedded oriented arcs in @xmath48 with a common basepoint @xmath50 .",

    "consider the vectors @xmath51 and @xmath52 that are tangent to @xmath49 and @xmath1 , respectively , at @xmath39 .",
    "we say that @xmath1 is _ to the right of @xmath49 if either @xmath49 is isotopic to @xmath1 or @xmath53 corresponds to the orientation of @xmath48 at @xmath39 . alternatively , if @xmath54 is the universal cover of @xmath48 .",

    "_      now that we have an handle on what a right - veering map is , we introduce the tool that we will use to identify right - veering @xmath2-braids : the burau representation of @xmath18 .",
    "the burau representation can be defined in several different ways .",
    "the description given here comes from the viewpoint of covering spaces .",

    "let ( @xmath75 ) be the ( regular ) covering space of @xmath24 which corresponds to the kernel of this homomorphism .",
    "concretely , @xmath76 can be constructed by making a series of cuts from the boundary of @xmath24 to each puncture ( cut along the arcs @xmath77 described in the next section ) , then making a stack of @xmath78 copies of this cut open space . at each component ,",
    "glue the right side of each cut to the left side of the corresponding cut in the component directly above it .",
    "we end up with a space that resembles a parking garage with @xmath27 `` ramps '' and infinitely many  levels \" .",
    "since @xmath72 is a surjection , the group of deck transformations is isomorphic to @xmath79 . letting @xmath80 $ ] , the induced action @xmath81 of @xmath82 on @xmath83 endows @xmath83 with a @xmath84-module structure by setting @xmath85 , for @xmath86 .",
    "viewed as a @xmath84-module , @xmath83 is free of rank @xmath87 .",
    "a chosen representative @xmath88 will lift uniquely to a homeomorphism @xmath89 that pointwise fixes the fiber over @xmath69 .",
    "subsequently , @xmath90 induces the @xmath84-module automorphism @xmath91 .",
    "we now make the following definition given a basis @xmath92 of @xmath83 .    given an element @xmath1 of the braid group and an element @xmath3 which represents it , the _ reduced burau representation _ is the homomorphism : @xmath93 where @xmath94 equals the automorphism @xmath95 .",
    "let @xmath96 denote the matrix for @xmath94 with respect to the basis @xmath97 .",
    "we call this the _ reduced burau matrix _ of @xmath1 .    in a similar way",

    "it is a well - known fact that burau is faithful for @xmath107 ( see @xcite ) . in @xcite",

    "the most recent improvement was made by bigelow in @xcite when it was shown that burau is not faithful for @xmath110 .",
    "unreduced burau matrices can be obtained in several different ways , but perhaps the most beautiful approach was given by moody in @xcite . in this section",
    "we will describe his method for computing unreduced burau matrices .",
    "let @xmath111 and @xmath112 for @xmath113 be as shown in figure  [ n - disk for unreduced burau ] .",

    "we orient @xmath112 from the puncture to the boundary and orient @xmath111 counterclockwise .",
    "then orientations of the lifts are induced from the arcs in the base space .",
    "we use the following convention for choosing our lifts . choose component @xmath120 of @xmath100 , and declare the sheet of @xmath76 containing @xmath120 to be the @xmath121-th level of @xmath76 .",
    "now , define @xmath122 to be the unique lift of @xmath123 that starts at @xmath120 and ends at @xmath124 and @xmath125 to be the unique lift of @xmath112 that intersects @xmath122 .",
    "now we can write the action of any braid @xmath1 on basis vector @xmath122 of @xmath98 as : @xmath126    using this method allows us to work in @xmath24 in a very concrete way instead of @xmath76 .",
    "the key is in keeping track of the level changes .",

    "indicates the level on which the intersection occurs.,height=120 ]    in particular , one can calculate the unreduced matrix for @xmath127 as @xmath129 similarly , we can calculate @xmath130 as @xmath131",
    "in this section , we will use the reduced burau representation to classify right - veering braids that are reducible or periodic .",
    "we do so largely by appealing to work done by honda , kazez , and mati in  @xcite and by using the commutative diagram    @xmath132^{\\psi}\\ar[d]_{\\rho_r } & sl_2({\\mathbb z})\\\\ \\rho_r(b_3)\\ar[ur]^{\\pi } } \\ ] ]    in this diagram , @xmath133 is specialization at @xmath134 , and @xmath41 the quotient map from @xmath0 to @xmath0 modulo its infinite cyclic center as before .",

    "we use a characterization of reducible maps of @xmath35 ( see @xcite , for example ) that says that any reducible map of @xmath35 can be written as @xmath136 , where @xmath137 is a boundary - parallel curve , and @xmath138 is some nonseparating curve in @xmath35 . given the 2-fold branched cover of @xmath139 by @xmath35 ( the branch set being the three points shown below ) , we see that a half twist about an arc from @xmath140 to @xmath141 in @xmath139 lifts to a full dehn twist about some nonseparating curve in @xmath35",

    "that is , any reducible braid @xmath145 can be written in the form @xmath146 , for some @xmath147 .",

    "thus , given a reducible braid @xmath152 , our task is to extract the values @xmath17 and @xmath153 from the reduced burau matrix @xmath96 , then use lemma  [ hkm ] to determine whether @xmath1 is right - veering or not .",

    "we claim that @xmath238 are intersection pairings of @xmath7 and @xmath239 , respectively . to see this , we first note that @xmath240 if @xmath241 is a lift of @xmath242 to the @xmath121-th level of @xmath76 , then @xmath243 and @xmath244 represent the same element of @xmath245 .",

    "it remains to show that there is no cancellation of terms in this pairing , and hence we are able to calculate the geometric intersection numbers of the aforementioned arcs by specializing each polynomial at @xmath134 .",
    "let @xmath256 be the @xmath161-th intersection of @xmath7 and @xmath242 , and consider the loop that is the union of the arcs from @xmath256 to @xmath257 along @xmath242 and along @xmath7 .",
    "if @xmath7 intersects @xmath242 in the same direction at both @xmath256 and @xmath257 , then this loop must contain exactly two of the punctures ( this is a direct consequence of there being three punctures ) . hence , if at @xmath256 the lift @xmath258 is on level @xmath17 of @xmath259 , then at @xmath260 @xmath258 is on level @xmath261 of @xmath259 . the arc @xmath7 will intersect @xmath262 or @xmath263 either just before or just after each intersection with @xmath242 depending upon its orientation at @xmath256 and @xmath257 .",

    "when we consider the monomial associated to @xmath262 and @xmath264 times the monomial associated to @xmath263 , there is a consistency between the parity of the exponent of @xmath265 and the sign of @xmath265 ( meaning same parity , same sign and opposite parity , opposite sign ) . as a result ,",
    "specialization at @xmath134 gives the accurate geometric intersection number of @xmath266 in absolute value .",
    "a similar argument holds if @xmath7 is oriented downward at @xmath256 and @xmath257 .",

    "the only exceptions are the terms corresponding to intersections of the types seen below in figure  [ exception ] . however , multiplying the polynomial corresponding to @xmath271 by @xmath272 changes the any inconsistency to a consistency with the polynomial corresponding to @xmath262 .",

    "thus @xmath273 gives the geometric intersection number of @xmath7 and @xmath251 .",
    "let @xmath199 .",
    "since @xmath1 is uniquely determined by its action on the loops @xmath274 , we argue that the image of each @xmath111 under @xmath1 can be determined up to the action of the braid @xmath205 and isotopy given the geometric intersection numbers @xmath275 , @xmath276 , and @xmath277 . without any loss of generality",
    ", we consider the image @xmath278 .",
    "the arc @xmath278 is the union of subarcs inside and outside the triangle formed by @xmath4 .",
    "two arcs of particular interest are the initial subarc and the terminal subarc which intersect the boundary of the disk ( shown in red )",
    ".      however , we see that one of @xmath279 must be zero , for if all of these are positive , then all of @xmath280 must be zero ( else , we would have a loop ) .",
    "this would imply that one of the sides of the triangle has no intersection points contradicting @xmath279 all positive .",
    "hence , one of @xmath279 must be zero or equivalently , two of @xmath281 sum to give the third . without",
    "any loss of generality , let s say @xmath282 .",
    "with this assumption , we can conclude that the inside of the triangle is one of the two options shown in figure  [ inside ] .",
    "it can be easily checked that the configuration in figure  [ inside3 ] is the special case that @xmath283 , and hence @xmath1 acts as the identity on @xmath284 up to multiplication by @xmath205 .",
    "assuming that @xmath281 are all positive as in figure  [ inside1 ] , we have the following six choices for the outside of the triangle shown in figure  [ outside ] .    immediately , we can rule out the configurations in figures  [ outside2a ] and  [ outside3b ] because each would imply that @xmath285 .",
    "now consider the configuration in figure  [ outside2b ] .",
    "if @xmath286 are the number of points on each side shown below in figure  [ outside2blabeled ] , then @xmath287 , @xmath288 , and @xmath289 . given that @xmath282 , this gives that @xmath290 and @xmath291 are both equal to zero",
    "this is a contradiction since @xmath292 is not equal to zero .",
    "we can also eliminate configuration  [ outside3a ] in a similar fashion ( they are mirror images of each other ) .",
    "therefore , we are left with only two possibilities :  [ outside1a ] and  [ outside1b ] . if @xmath293 are as shown below in figure  [ outside1alabeled ] , then @xmath294 , and @xmath295 . in particular",
    ", this configuration corresponds to the case that @xmath296 .",
    "it is easily checked that  [ outside1b ] corresponds to the case that @xmath297 , and if @xmath298 , then @xmath299 .",
    "hence , the only ambiguity is the amount of twisting that occurs in a neighborhood of @xmath32 .",
    "thus , we can uniquely determine each @xmath7 up to multiplication by powers of @xmath144 .            1",
    ".   @xmath301 and @xmath7 have the same geometric intersection numbers @xmath302 ; 2 .",
    "@xmath301 is to the right of @xmath111 ; and 3 .",
    "@xmath301 has minimal boundary twisting in the sense that @xmath303 is to the left of @xmath111 .",
    "now , how do we find the integer @xmath17 ?",
    "admittedly , this is the most cumbersome part of the process .",
    "after @xmath301 is found , we use the method described in section  [ geometric ] to calculate each corresponding column vector @xmath306 of a matrix which we call @xmath307 . here",
    "is where we use the faithfulness of the representation for @xmath107 .",
    "if we are lucky , this matrix will be @xmath308 , and hence @xmath150 .",
    "if we are not , we use our computing software of choice to multiply @xmath307 by powers of @xmath309 until we reach @xmath308 .",
    "the power of @xmath310 that gives @xmath308 is equal to @xmath17 ."
