    "this dependence on the static fields has not yet been observed , which is most likely due to the insignificance of the linear term at ambient temperatures and the fact that most previous measurements have been performed using nv ensembles , where resonant interactions between nv sub - ensembles and between nv centers and p1 centers at magnetic fields around @xmath300 0 , 0.96 , 1.44 1.68 ghz,@xcite will most likely have masked the relatively weak dependence of the linear term .",
    "the dephasing rate @xmath301 is dominated by the contributions from magnetic interactions with little observed temperature dependence in small static fields.@xcite since the magnetic contribution is governed by the impurity concentration,@xcite it may be possible to observe the spin - lattice contribution in highly pure samples .",

    "the analysis of the effects of inhomogeneous fields revealed the field configurations required to switch between different noise dominated regimes .",
