    "but then that vertex class would also correspond to an angle of @xmath410 , and we would have that @xmath1 is an isosceles triangular billiards surface cover @xmath2 via a cover described in lemma [ right - isosceles lemma ] .",
    "then equation allows only the following possibilities for @xmath2 : the surfaces + @xmath411 + note that @xmath412 .",
    "first suppose that @xmath413 .",
    "then @xmath414 ( thus @xmath224 is odd ) , @xmath415 , and we have @xmath416 .",
    "we have that @xmath417 and hence that @xmath418 . on @xmath419 , there is only one singular vertex class and the cone angle of each singular point is @xmath420 .",
    "thus lemma [ degree argument lemma ] applies here . since @xmath419 is never isosceles , each singular point has a type ii fingerprint .",
    "let @xmath21 be the surface obtained from @xmath1 by deleting all singularities of @xmath1 which @xmath3 maps to nonsingular points , and let @xmath421 be the restriction of @xmath3 to @xmath21 . by lemma [ degree argument lemma ] ,",
    "the elements of @xmath422 are the union of entire vertex classes .",
    "thus a type ii fingerprint on @xmath21 will uniquely identify the triangular billiards table used to generate @xmath1 , by lemma [ fingerprints with punctures lemma ] . because @xmath421 is a balanced map , each singular point of @xmath21",
    "must have the same type ii fingerprint ( on @xmath21 ) as its @xmath421-image on @xmath2 .",
    "but , a type ii fingerprint uniquely identifies the triangle used to generate the surface ( this works for @xmath21 as well ) ; hence @xmath1 and @xmath419 are the same billiards surface , and lemma [ singular surface self - cover lemma ] says that a triple cover is impossible .",
    "now suppose that @xmath423 .",
    "then the cone angle of each singular point on @xmath419 is @xmath424 .",
    "if @xmath425 then @xmath426 , so that again we can apply lemma [ degree argument lemma ] and lemma [ fingerprints with punctures lemma ] , and the same fingerprint argument goes through .",
    "the remaining cases are @xmath427 .",
    "we have @xmath428 and @xmath429 , neither of which have singularities .",
    "assume @xmath430 and @xmath431 .",
    "since @xmath49 is odd , @xmath432 , so equation implies that @xmath433 .",
    "but , if @xmath434 , equation also implies that @xmath3 is balanced , contradicting the result of lemma [ balanced cover lemma ] that balanced covers are of degree at most 2 . thus @xmath435 .",
    "let them be @xmath189 and @xmath187 , corresponding to @xmath138 and @xmath139 . if @xmath189 is singular , then by lemma [ degree argument lemma ] we have @xmath439 for some @xmath440 .",
    "but since @xmath441 , this would mean that all the @xmath40 are even , contradicting the fact that @xmath30 .",
    "let them be @xmath189 and @xmath187 .",
    "we have that @xmath441 is even .",
    "if @xmath189 is singular then again we have that @xmath138 ( and hence @xmath139 ) is even , once more contradicting that @xmath30 .",
    "hence @xmath189 and @xmath187 are nonsingular , and @xmath3 is balanced ."
