    "the quest for a quantum computer is boosting the development and engineering of new sophisticated quantum devices that allow us to observe the space - time evolution of its constituents .",
    "indeed , in recent years several experimental groups successfully measured the quantum dynamical evolution of particles and/or quasi - particle hopping in a lattice @xcite . due to the inherent nature of quantum mechanics ,",
    "the evolution of an isolated quantum system is represented by a wavefunction @xmath1 which describes the probability amplitude of finding a particle in position @xmath2 at time @xmath3",
    ". quantum interference can give rise to particular structures and patterns in the space - time evolution @xmath4 which are known as `` quantum carpets '' @xcite , quantum revivals @xcite , or quantum talbot effect @xcite , quantum walks @xcite , and quantum self - imaging @xcite .",
    "an interesting case is when the wavefunction undergoes a revival , namely when after a particular time the shape of the initial wave packet is almost perfectly reconstructed . aside from its fundamental implication ,",
    "revivals occurring into a different position , far from the initial one , are particularly important for connecting and linking distant quantum registers @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", a lattice of static localized particles represents an alternative paradigm for quantum communication where information carriers are not physically moving particles but rather collective excitations whose space extent is reconstructed at a different position after a certain time . in this respect ,",
    "spin chains represent one of the most viable solution and there are various protocols to exploit their dynamics for transferring states and entanglement between remote sites @xcite .",
    "the coherent excitation transfer , or in general the wavefunction reconstruction at a certain time , corresponds to the phase alignment of the eigenstates entering into the wave packet and , as such , can happen only when the energy eigenvalues satisfy certain conditions @xcite . some models admitting a perfect @xcite or almost perfect @xcite reconstruction have been explicitly constructed . on the other hand ,",
    "if the phase alignment is only between particular subsets of the energy eigenstates , then the wavefunction is split into a superposition of copies of the initial wave - packet , each separated by a certain distance .",
    "this effect is known as fractional revival @xcite , or fractional talbot effect @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we engineer a chain with nearest neighbor interactions to obtain a perfect wave - packet splitting and reconstruction during a ballistic evolution . in other terms , if @xmath5 is the shape of the initial wave - packet , at the revival time @xmath0 the wavefunction is @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the group velocity defined by the energy eigenvalues . while in general the revival time is connected to specific algebraic properties of the spectrum and",
    "might be very long , in our case the splitting happens on a time which is dictated by the group velocity of excitations and , as such , scales only linearly with the distance .",
    "our method is therefore specifically targeted for applications where a smaller operational time is particularly important for neglecting the interaction with the surrounding environment .",
    "recently , it has been shown that the wavefunction of a one - dimensional excitation can be split into a transmitted and reflected components by introducing localized impurities @xcite , or via suitably designed time - dependent control fields @xcite . here",
    "we focus on a different strategy aiming at obtaining a _ perfect _ fractional revival .",
    "the generalization of the fractional revival to a many - particle setting has many important applications .",
    "as far as identical particles ( bosons / fermions ) are concerned , it allows one to define a perfect effective beam splitter operation between distant sites and then to observe multi - particle hanbury brown and twiss interference effects @xcite , such as perfect bunching or anti - bunching . as for spin systems , that the perfect fractional revival can be used to generate dynamically long - distance entanglement , a topical application which may be tested experimentally with current technology @xcite .",
    "indeed , the use of particle delocalization to generate entanglement is particularly evident in a single excitation setup , namely when there is a single spin in the state @xmath8 while all the other spins are in the state @xmath9 . if the wave - packet of this excitation is perfectly split and reconstructed in two distant sites @xmath10 and @xmath11 , then the final state of the spins pair @xmath12 is @xmath13 , namely a maximally entangled bell state .",
    "we show that this reasoning can also be used in a multiple excitation scenario to dynamically generate a maximal set of bell pairs in a spin chain setup , and to provide a more general version of previous proposals @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we define the mathematical conditions which allows a particular fractional revival , namely the perfect splitting and reconstruction of an incoming wave packet , and we propose a numerical algorithm to find suitable hamiltonians which fulfill these conditions .",
    "interesting applications are then analyzed in section iii in a many - particle setting .",
    "in particular , we discuss bunching / anti - bunching effects in atoms trapped in an optical lattice and the dynamical generation of entanglement in spin chains interacting with nearest - neighbor xy couplings .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section iv .",
    "we study a one - dimensional quantum walk in a lattice with nearest - neighbor engineered interactions described by the hamiltonian @xmath14 where @xmath15 represents the state where a particle is in the @xmath10-th site , and @xmath16 is the length of the chain . to find the mathematical conditions for a perfect splitting and reconstruction , we first focus on the requirements to achieve perfect state transfer . to perfectly transfer an excitation from site 1 to site @xmath16 the coefficients @xmath17 and",
    "@xmath18 have to satisfy some conditions ( see e.g. ref.@xcite ) .",
    "firstly , the hamiltonian has to be _ mirror symmetric _ , i.e. @xmath19 and @xmath20 for any @xmath21 .",
    "the mirror symmetry imposes some relations between the eigenvectors of the hamiltonian @xcite : if the eigenvalues @xmath22 of @xmath23 are ordered such that @xmath24 , then @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the eigenvalue decomposition of @xmath23 .",
    "the second requirement is that the energy eigenvalues @xmath22 satisfy the relation @xmath27 where @xmath0 is the transmission time and @xmath28 is an arbitrary phase .",
    "here we consider @xmath29 , namely @xmath30 . among the analytic solutions of , the simplest one",
    "is given by the coupling pattern @xcite @xmath31 which implements perfect state transfer ( pst ) at @xmath32 .",
    "other solutions can be obtained numerically using inverse eigenvalue algorithms @xcite . if the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath23 satisfy eqs . and , then @xmath33 namely an excitation initially located in site @xmath11 is perfectly transferred to site @xmath34 after a time @xmath35 .    in a similar fashion",
    ", a perfect wave - packet splitting and reconstruction can be obtained when the eigenvalues of @xmath23 satisfy @xmath36 for some angle @xmath37 .",
    "indeed , by repeating the calculation one finds @xmath38 namely @xmath39 the eigenvalue relations are one of the main result of this paper . by properly choosing @xmath37 it is possible to balance the reconstruction on distant sites , as show in eq . , and",
    "for @xmath40 one obtains the perfect delocalization between distant sites of an initially localized wave packet . the coupling pattern to satisfy eq .",
    "can be obtained using inverse eigenvalue techniques . from the conceptual point of view",
    "an inverse eigenvalue problem deals with finding the zeros of the highly non - linear function @xmath41 , where the vector @xmath42 contains the ordered eigenvalues of the hamiltonian @xmath43 with parameters @xmath44 , and the vector @xmath45 contains the target spectrum . among the algorithms to find the optimal parameters @xcite , the most used one relies on the application of the newton method to find the zeros of @xmath46 .",
    "the newton method starts with an initial guess @xmath47 and updates it according to the rule @xcite @xmath48 = f(\\lambda^{(n)})~ ,    \\label{e.newton}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the matrix , with elements @xmath49 is the jacobian matrix and @xmath50 is the eigenvalue decomposition of @xmath43 .",
    "the linear system has a unique solution provided that @xmath51 is an invertible matrix .",
    "this in turn implies that the number of parameters have to match the number of eigenvalues , i.e. the dimension of the matrix .",
    "the mirror symmetric hamiltonian has @xmath16 independent parameters , being @xmath16 the number of sites . indeed , because of the mirror symmetry , when @xmath52 ( being @xmath53 an integer ) there are @xmath53 independent values of @xmath17 and @xmath53 independent values of @xmath18 . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath54 , there are @xmath53 independent values of @xmath17 and @xmath55 independent values of @xmath18 .",
    "we apply inverse eigenvalue techniques to find the coupling pattern which allows a perfect balanced splitting of the wave - packet .",
    "the latter is obtained by imposing the condition with @xmath56 , so the target eigenvalues are @xmath57 where , without loss of generality , we have imposed @xmath58 . because @xmath46 is in general a non - convex function , possibly with many local minima , inverse eigenvalue problems are known to converge only if the initial guess @xmath47 is not too far from the ideal set of parameters @xmath59 for which @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "we guess that the optimal parameters for a perfect wave packet splitting are given by a local perturbation of the fully engineered chain which guarantees perfect state transfer , so we use the coupling pattern as an initial condition .",
    "the algorithm quickly converges to an optimal parameter set and hereinafter we called @xmath61 and @xmath62 the obtained optimal couplings and local fields .",
    "surprisingly , we find that for even @xmath16 the algorithm always converges to a solution where @xmath63 , while for odd @xmath16 the local fields @xmath62 are different from zeros especially near the center of the chain . for example , the hamiltonians for @xmath64 are shown in appendix a.    the output of the algorithm is shown in fig.[fig : perf50 ] for @xmath65 , and in fig.[fig : perf49 ] for @xmath66 .",
    "as it is clear , both for @xmath16 even and odd the coupling patterns @xmath67 for perfect wave - packet splitting are similar to the coupling pattern @xmath68 , in formula , for perfect state transfer : the only difference being the presence of few impurities at the center of the chain .",
    "moreover , for odd @xmath16 one requires also the engineering of the local fields @xmath62 according to some particular profile . the resulting field pattern is constant far from the center of the chain and has a particular oscillatory profile near the central sites .",
    "as a concrete application of the results of the last section we consider a model of hopping particle in a one - dimensional lattice , described by a bose - hubbard hamiltonian with site dependent parameters @xmath69 here @xmath70 are the tunneling matrix elements , @xmath71 is the onsite interaction and @xmath72 is the chemical potential , @xmath73 is the boson annihilation operator and @xmath74 .",
    "the hamiltonian accurately describes cold bosonic atoms in optical lattices @xcite , and it also models fermions @xcite and hard - core bosons @xcite dependently on the onsite interaction values .",
    "the tuning of the site dependent coupling constants in is achieved via addressable optical lattices @xcite , created projecting an electric field profile via holographic masks @xcite or via micro - mirror devices @xcite .",
    "initialization and read - out of single atoms are achieved exploiting single - particle addressing techniques @xcite while magnetically induced feshbach resonances allow a global control of the onsite interaction acting on the collisional coupling constants values @xcite .",
    "for instance the non - interacting regime @xmath75 has been recently achieved with this technique using @xmath76 atoms loaded in a one - dimensional optical lattice @xcite .",
    "thanks to the techniques developed in this paper , the coupling profile produces a splitting of a single particle wavefunction , which is reconstructed at the transfer time @xmath0 as two copies of the initial wavepacket with probability @xmath77 each .",
    "more precisely when the coupling pattern @xmath61 is implemented , the wavefunction of a bosonic atom initially onsite @xmath10 is split by the impurity pattern at the center of the lattice and , at the transfer time @xmath0 , that particle is perfectly delocalized between two mirror symmetric sites , @xmath10 and @xmath78 .",
    "if an another particle was in the lattice in position @xmath11 , after @xmath0 it would be delocalized between the sites @xmath11 and @xmath34 .",
    "when two particles are initially in two mirror symmetric sites , i.e. @xmath79 the dynamics generates multi - particle hanbury brown and twiss correlations @xcite at @xmath0 .",
    "indeed , in the free boson case , namely when @xmath80 , because of the symmetries of the bosonic wave - function , after a time @xmath0 the state becomes @xmath81 i.e. the output state consists of a superposition of two bosons being in site @xmath10 and two bosons being in site @xmath79 .",
    "this `` bunching '' effect is the celebrated hong - ou - mandel effect ( hom ) @xcite which has been observed recently exploiting the coherent evolution of two particles in a single double - well tunneling model @xcite . with the results presented in this paper , because of the perfect reconstruction of wave - packets at the transfer time , it is possible to achieve a perfect bunching between arbitrary distant sites of an optical lattice . on the other hand , in the strong interacting case , namely in the hard - core boson limit @xmath82 , the final state is @xmath83 ,",
    "i.e. there is one particle in position @xmath10 and one particle in position @xmath11 .      in real systems",
    "random noise effect , due to environmental variables , and engineering imperfections in the coupling configurations produce deviations from the ideal coupling values @xcite .",
    "the effect of the coupling randomness , even for non - interacting systems , is to produce a localization of the eigenstates of the system and consequently to inhibit the state transfer @xcite .",
    "we also mention that recently it has been shown @xcite that the interaction of bosonic atoms with static fermionic impurities , randomly distributed in the lattice , may yield a bose - hubbard model where the parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18 are subject to noise . given the above , we investigate what degree of imperfections is tolerable in our scheme or , in other terms , what is the precision required in tuning the coupling strengths according to the desired pattern .",
    "we firstly include an off - diagonal disorder term ( hopping disorder ) in the hamiltonian as @xmath84 , where @xmath85 $ ] is a uniform random distribution and @xmath86 is the perturbation strength @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : datau0funceps ] the relative variation @xmath87 is shown as function of the degree of disorder @xmath86 . here",
    "@xmath88 , where @xmath89 is defined in , and @xmath90 represents the deviation of the bunching probability respect to the ideal case .",
    "we also consider the effect of diagonal noise @xmath91 with @xmath92 $ ] in an even site chain .",
    "the effect of signal noise is shown in figure fig .",

    "[ fig : datau0funceps ] and [ fig : datau0diagonalfunceps ] a power law behavior , under a certain threshold value of @xmath86 and @xmath93 , characterizes both the deviations due to hopping disorder and due to the diagonal disorder .",
    "clearly , an high degree of disorder produces state localization , which completely destroys the effect .       for a @xmath94 one - dimensional chain initialized in @xmath95 .",

    ", title=\"fig:\",height=7 ]    the perfect reconstruction scheme developed in the previous sections allows generating periodic space - time quantum interference patterns of multi - particles systems known as `` quantum carpet '' . by using the engineered chain with @xmath61 and @xmath62 one in fact expects a regular temporal pattern in the evolution : the wave - packets composing the initial state are split into two copies , reconstructed into different positions after the time @xmath0 , and then they go back to the initial position after a time @xmath97 . on the other hand , during intermediate times , quantum interference leads to different behaviors which are expected to be susceptible to the particle statistics . to show this effect , we study the quantum carpet generated by the space - time evolution of the mean occupation number @xmath98 , or by the square occupation mean @xmath99 . the regular interference pattern of a two particle system is depicted in fig . [ fig:1dcarpetsn2 ] where we show the expectation value @xmath100 for two non interacting bosons initially in @xmath101 in a one - dimensional chain with @xmath94 .    to highlight more in detail the multi - particle statistical interference effect we consider a system of four particles , initially in @xmath102 , where @xmath103 .",

    "are observable at @xmath0 while in both cases a perfect reconstruction of the initial wavepacket happens at @xmath97 .",
    "this is evident more clearly in fig .",
    "[ fig : slice2 ] where we represent the mean occupation number and the quadratic mean occupation number of site @xmath104 as function of time .",
    "we also take into consideration the role of the onsite interaction which affects the perfect reconstruction of a two particle wavepacket .",
    "it turns out that from the space - time dynamics of @xmath105 it is not possible to discriminate free evolution ( @xmath106 ) from the hard - core limit ( @xmath107 ) , while particle statistics give rise to different dynamics for @xmath108 . on the other hand , for intermediate values of the onsite interaction the dynamics",
    "does not lead to a perfect reconstruction of a wavepacket , due to scattering effects .",

    "effective spin-@xmath112 systems coupled by the hamiltonian with site dependent coupling strengths can be obtained in different physical realizations ; _",
    "e.g. _ in nrm using global rotations and suitable field gradients @xcite , with atomic ions confined in segmented microtraps @xcite , with neutral atoms trapped into an optical lattice by polarized laser beams @xcite , or with superconducting qubits coupled either by site dependent capacitors @xcite or inductors @xcite .",
    "the system hamiltonian can be mapped to a fermionic hopping model via the jordan - wigner transformation : the operators @xmath117 satisfy canonical anticommutation relations and @xmath118   , where @xmath119 is the hopping matrix .",
    "every many - body spin state can be obtained by applying the annihilation operators @xmath120 to the fully polarized state @xmath121 .",
    "therefore , the time evolution of a generic initial state can be obtained by expressing the operator @xmath120 in the heisenberg picture @xcite as @xmath122    we now show how one can create entanglement between two remote mirror symmetric sites by exploiting the perfect wave - packet splitting .",

    "one has @xmath125 . therefore , going back to the spin picture , after the time @xmath0 an entangled state @xmath126 between sites @xmath10 and @xmath78 is generated .",
    "the above arguments can be generalized in a many - particle setting to generate the maximal amount of entangled pairs starting from a separable state .",
    "two suitable choices of the initial state are @xmath127 namely the domain - wall state @xmath128 or the anti - ferromagnetic state @xmath129 .",
    "if the system is initialized in either @xmath128 or @xmath129 and is let to evolve under the perfect splitting hamiltonian , then the resulting state after a time @xmath0 is @xmath130 , where @xmath131 depends on the initial state . by carefully dealing with the jordan - wigner phase entering into the definition of the operators @xmath120 one can easily find that the resulting state corresponds to a state in which every pair of qubits sitting in positions @xmath10 and @xmath78 is maximally entangled .",
    "the perfect splitting dynamics thus represents an alternative to other methods existing in the literature to generate nested bell pairs @xcite starting from a separable state .",
    "however , compared to previous proposals it is more general because it allows tuning the number of generated bell pairs by simply choosing the number of flipped spins in the initial state .",
    "in this paper we study the wavefunction dynamics of hopping particles and/or quasi - particles in a quantum chain .",
    "we design the hamiltonian so that a localized wave packet evolves coherently along the chain without dispersion , and at particular point is perfectly split into transmitted and reflected components which propagate in opposite directions without dispersion .",
    "when the reflected component reaches the initial site , its wave packet becomes localized while , at the same time , the wave packet of the transmitted component becomes localized in a different site of the chain .",
    "we devise the exact conditions that the hamiltonian spectrum has to satisfy to allow for the perfect splitting and reconstruction .",
    "then we focus on some viable hamiltonians with nearest - neighbor interactions and site - dependent couplings , and we find the coupling pattern which satisfies the perfect splitting condition using inverse eigenvalue techniques .    besides shedding new light into quantum interference phenomena in one dimension , our results are particularly useful for applications . in this respect , we study atomic lattices and obtain perfect hanbury brown and twiss correlations and peculiar quantum interference patterns which result in regular structure in the space - time evolution of the many - particle wave function .",
    "moreover , we show that in a spin chain setting , the particle splitting can be used to generate maximally entangled states between distant parts .",
    "we expect that the perfect wavepacket splitting will become a general tool for varied applications in controlled quantum interference and quantum information processing .",
