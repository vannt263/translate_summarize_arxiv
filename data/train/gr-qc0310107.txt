    "whereas researchers in the relativity community ( and the bulk of the astrophysics and particle physics communities ) are by and large happy with our understanding of classical black holes , there is a certain amount of polite dissent .",
    "such dissent ranges from a careful sceptical analysis of what it physically means to observe an event horizon  @xcite , through alternative models for compact objects  @xcite , to more radical proposals that drastically modify the physics in the region where the event horizon would otherwise be expected to form  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the `` gravastar '' ( _ gra_vitational _ va_cuum _ star _ ) picture recently developed by mazur and mottola  @xcite is one of a very small number of serious challenges to our usual conception of a `` black hole '' . in the gravastar picture",
    "there is effectively a phase transition at or near the location where the event horizon would have been expected to form .",
    "the interior of what would have been the black hole is replaced by a suitably chosen segment of de sitter space .",
    "( see also laughlin _ et al . _",
    "@xcite for a similar proposal . )",
    "while mazur and mottola were able to make considerable progress with their proposal , and to argue for the thermodynamic stability of their configuration , the question of whether their model enjoys full dynamic stability against spherically symmetric perturbations of the matter and/ or gravity fields remains an open question . in this article",
    "we construct a simplified model that shares the key features of the mazur  mottola scenario , and which is sufficiently simple to be amenable to a full dynamical analysis .",
    "we find that there are _ some _ physical equations of state for the transition layer that lead to stability .",
    "to set the stage , we note that the mottola - mazur gravastar is an onion - like construction which has five layers ( including two thin shells ) :    * an external schwarzschild vacuum , with energy density , @xmath0 , and pressure , @xmath1 . * a thin shell , with surface density @xmath2 and surface tension @xmath3 ; with radius @xmath4 . * a ( relatively thin ) finite - thickness shell of stiff matter with equation of state @xmath5 ; straddling @xmath6 where the horizon would in normal circumstances have formed . * a second thin shell ; with radius @xmath7 , and with surface density @xmath8 and surface tension @xmath9 . * a de sitter interior , with @xmath10 .",
    "the two thin shells are used to `` confine '' the stiff matter in a transition layer straddling @xmath6 , while the energy density in the de sitter vacuum is chosen to satisfy @xmath11 so that , in the approximation where the transition layer is neglected , _ all _ of the mass of the resulting object can be traced back to the energy density of the de sitter vacuum .    in order to dynamically study the gravitational stability of this setup",
    ", we will simplify the model even further : we shall combine the thick shell of stiff matter , and the two thin shells , into a single thin shell .",
    "this reduces the gravastar to a simple three - layer model :    * an external schwarzschild vacuum , @xmath12 . * a single thin shell , with surface density @xmath13 and surface tension @xmath14 ; with radius @xmath15 . * a de sitter interior , @xmath10 .    to avoid forming an event horizon",
    ", we shall demand @xmath16 the closer we are to saturating this bound , the closer we will be to the mazur ",
    "mottola scenario ( and the closer we will be to attributing all the mass of the gravastar to the energy of the de sitter vacuum ) .",
    "we will analyse the dynamical stability of this simplified three - layer model .",
    "initially , we had hoped to either unambiguously determine stability or unambiguously determine instability ( which would then have killed the gravastar scenario ) .",
    "the actual results are much more ambiguous : _ some _ physically reasonable equations of state for the thin shell lead to stability , but that situation does not appear to be completely generic  some fine tuning seems to be necessary .",
    "for simplicity , let us first assume the shell is static . the extrinsic curvature may be computed directly from the definition ( [ k : gen ] ) , or alternatively in terms of gaussian normal coordinates ( gnc ) .",
    "define @xmath32 , where @xmath33 in gnc the extrinsic curvature is @xmath34 or in an orthonormal basis , @xmath35 then in an orthonormal frame the surface stress - energy tensor is given by @xmath36 , and standard manipulations yield both @xmath37\\right ]   = -4\\pi\\sigma , \\label{e1:static}\\ ] ] and @xmath38\\right ] = -8\\pi\\vth . \\label{e2:static}\\ ] ] thus there are only two algebraically independent components of the extrinsic curvature and they can be related to surface density and surface tension .",

    "in contrast , solving for any of one of @xmath45 , @xmath46 , or @xmath13 is no worse than a simple quadratic .",
    "one can simplify equation ( [ junction2 ] ) by expressing it in terms of @xmath47 , which represents the mass of the thin shell itself .",
    "we then obtain a [ static ] `` master equation '' , which directly relates the three masses ( @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath48 ) to the radial location of the shell , @xmath44 : @xmath49 ^ 2 .",

    "the master equation ( [ master_static ] ) is only one single equation ; one would simultaneously have to solve the surface tension equation .",
    "in many ways the best approach for the static shell is prescriptive : choose the interior and exterior geometries arbitrarily , then choose @xmath44 , and then calculate the shell energy density @xmath13 and surface tension @xmath14 from equations ( [ e1:static ] ) and ( [ e2:static ] ) .",
    "of course , this analysis presently gives no information about stability ; we are simply _ assuming _ a static shell .",
    "developing a dynamical stability analysis is our next concern .",
    "we now add time dependence by allowing the shell to move radially , so that the proper time , @xmath23 , at points on the shell is given by ( [ tau ] ) .",
    "it follows from ( [ tau ] ) that the ( unit ) 4-velocity of a point on the hypersurface ( at fixed @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) is @xmath50 where @xmath51 , @xmath52 and we have chosen @xmath23 to be future - pointing with respect to @xmath53 . the unit normal to the shell is obtained from ( [ v : def ] ) using the orthogonality condition , @xmath54 , giving @xmath55 there is an overall sign ambiguity in defining the components of the unit normal ( [ v : def ] ) , which is fixed by demanding that the chart of the gaussian normal coordinates @xmath56 be consistently oriented with respect to the chart of local coordinates @xmath57 , the jacobian of the transformation being @xmath58 with unit determinant and inverse @xmath59    the components of the extrinsic curvature in gnc may be computed using ( [ k : gnc ] ) and ( [ jac2 ] ) , or alternatively directly from the definition ( [ k : gen ] ) .",

    "we are interested in the particular case @xmath14=@xmath13 . applying this condition to ( [ e : sigma - v ] ) and ( [ e : theta - v ] ) we have @xmath225 squaring ( [ anti - stiff-1 ] ) and rearranging we find that the shell must be located at values of @xmath44 which solve the quartic @xmath226 and lie in the range @xmath227 .",
    "an analysis of the discriminant of this quartic reveals that solutions exist for all values @xmath224 .",
    "furthermore , for each value of @xmath224 there is only one root of ( [ anti - stiff-1 ] ) in the range @xmath227 . for small values of",
    "@xmath228 one finds that that @xmath44 is very large , but as @xmath228 gets larger the value of @xmath44 approaches @xmath229 asymptotically . for @xmath230 , for example , @xmath231 .",
    "the general relativity community is , by and large , extremely comfortable with the `` black hole '' concept ; a concept firmly based in the classical solutions of the einstein equations  @xcite . in contrast , there is a strong undercurrent [ certainly not the mainstream ] in the particle physics and condensed matter communities that views the notion of event horizons with some alarm  this has lead over the years to repeated suggestions that quantum physics should intervene at/ near the the would - be event horizon , either replacing it with a singularity or preventing appearance of the horizon in the first place .",
    "a particular proposal along these lines that has recently attracted considerable attention is the mazur ",
    "mottola `` gravastar ''  @xcite .    in this article",
    "we have considered the dynamical stability of a 3-layer simplification of the 5-layer mazur  mottola model .",
    "aficionados of the model will be happy to know that there are many equations of state for the transition layer that imply dynamical stability for the gravastar configuration .",
    "those who are less enamoured of the model will be equally happy to see that large classes of equation of state are ruled out .",
    "our own interpretation of these results is that this calculation , or suitable modification thereof , is a necessary first step towards _ any _ kind of serious model building with a thin transition layer separating two `` vacuum '' regions .    in this regard ,",
    "we have in this article explored a tentative suggestion : if one really wishes to build a 3-layer thin - shell alternative to a black hole , then it seems to us that @xmath6 is not the appropriate place to insert the transition layer . in order to avoid the infinite stress ( presumably cutoff at the planck scale so that we would really be talking about planck - scale stresses ) that occur when the transition layer is placed at @xmath6",
    ", it would seem to us to be more profitable to move the transition layer out to @xmath232 .",
    "we have demonstrated that particular models do exist which realise this possibility .",
    "one particular case is the stiff shell gravastar , namely an exterior schwarzschild geometry , and an interior de sitter vacuum , separated by a stiff matter thin shell .",
    "such models could be regarded as simplified versions of the mazur ",
    "mottola model which avoid its singular limit .",
    "stiff shell gravastars exist and are dynamically stable for @xmath233 .",
    "in fact , generally two possible stiff shell gravastars exist , and in one of these cases one must place the thin shell at a value @xmath234 .",
    "since this is very close to the nominal position of a black hole horizon , it would be extremely difficult to distinguish the exterior geometry of such a gravastar from a genuine black hole in astrophysical contexts .",
    "the idea of moving the transition layer to a finite @xmath232 should possibly also be explored in the related chapline  hohlfeld ",
    "santiago model  @xcite .",
    "more generally , if the transition layer is not `` thin '' but rather of finite thickness , then investigations along the lines of gliner s  @xcite and dymnikova",
    "s  @xcite ideas might be profitable .",
    "finally we emphasise what we feel is the most important technical aspect of this paper .",
    "we have analyzed spherically symmetric thin shells in a large class of background geometries [ arbitrary @xmath235 , and related the resulting shell motion to an equivalent `` non - relativistic particle '' .",
    "furthermore we have shown how to take any desired `` potential '' @xmath110 and `` invert '' it to determine the equation of state for shell - matter that would lead to this potential .",
    "this result is of general interest to anyone building thin - shell models  regardless of one s views on gravastars versus black holes .",
    "_ note added : _ since this paper was completed we have learned that solutions with features similar to those discussed here  possessing an asymptotically schwarzschild exterior , a thin - shell and a de sitter core  have recently been found by wohlfarth @xcite in a gravity model in which the einstein ",
    "hilbert action is replaced by a `` born - infeld style '' action nonlinear in the curvature .",
    "wohlfarth s solutions completely regularize the schwarzschild singularity for @xmath152 .",
    "while much work remains to be done , these results suggest that the model presented in this paper may represent a simplified version of a class of objects which occur very naturally in string theory inspired gravity models .",
