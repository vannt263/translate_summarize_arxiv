    "the recent revival of interest in the properties of two - band ( or , more generally , multiband ) superconductors has been largely stimulated by the discovery of superconductivity in mgb@xmath0 ( ref . ) .",
    "other candidates for multiband superconductivity include nickel borocarbides ( ref . ) , nbse@xmath0 ( ref . ) , cecoin@xmath1 ( ref . ) , and also the iron - based high - temperature superconductors , see ref . for a review .",
    "these discoveries have shown that multiband superconductivity , which is characterized by a significant difference in the order parameter magnitudes and/or phases in different bands , might be a much more common phenomenon than it was previously thought .",
    "one important class of multiband superconductors is noncentrosymmetric compounds with a strong spin - orbit ( so ) coupling of conduction electrons with the lattice . since the discovery of superconductivity in cept@xmath2si ( ref . ) , the list of noncentrosymmetric superconductors has grown to include dozens of materials , such as uir ( ref . ) , cerhsi@xmath2 ( ref . ) , ceirsi@xmath2 ( ref . ) , y@xmath0c@xmath2 ( ref . ) , li@xmath0(pd@xmath3,pt@xmath4)@xmath2b ( ref . ) , and many others . in noncentrosymmetric crystals ,",
    "the bloch bands are split by the so coupling and the cooper pairing of electrons from different bands is suppressed , resulting in an effectively two - band picture of superconductivity .",
    "both the spin structure of the bands and the momentum - space topology of the bloch wavefunctions are nontrivial , which brings about a number of novel properties , such as the magnetoelectric effect in the superconducting state,@xcite topologically protected gapless boundary modes and quantum spin hall effect,@xcite and the anomalous de haas - van alphen and hall effects in the normal state.@xcite a comprehensive review of the recent developments in the field can be found in ref . .",
    "one of the most striking features of noncentrosymmetric superconductors is the existence of various unusual nonuniform superconducting states in the presence of a magnetic field @xmath5 ( refs . ) , or even without any field ( ref . ) .",
    "the best studied example is the helical states , with the order parameter proportional to @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is linear in @xmath5 , which originate from the deformation of the bloch bands by the field , see ref . for a review .",
    "the helical states , as well as their nonlinear modifications , such as `` multiple-@xmath7 '' states , have been previously studied only in some limiting cases , either using a bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) model with a spin - singlet attraction@xcite or assuming that superconductivity appears only in one of the bands.@xcite in both cases , the order parameter has one component .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to develop a phenomenological theory of nonuniform states in noncentrosymmetric superconductors in the general case , fully taking into account the two - component nature of superconductivity in these materials .",
    "generalization of the bcs theory to the case of two spin - degenerate bands was originally introduced in ref . .",
    "subsequent work has shown that many properties of multiband superconductors differ qualitatively from the single - band case , with the most spectacular features associated with the additional degrees of freedom  the relative phases of the pair condensates in different bands .",
    "for example , if the condensate phases have different windings around a vortex core , than the vortex will carry a fractional magnetic flux.@xcite in addition to exotic vortices , there is another type of topological defects specific to two - band superconductivity , namely phase solitons , in which the relative phase exhibits a kink - like variation by @xmath8 between its asymptotic mean - field values.@xcite increasing the number of bands opens up even more intriguing possibilities .",
    "for instance , superconducting states that break time - reversal symmetry can exist in `` frustrated '' three - band systems,@xcite with domain walls separating degenerate ground states.@xcite it has been proposed that the phase solitons in two - band superconductors can be dynamically created in nonequilibrium current - carrying states,@xcite or by the proximity effect with a conventional @xmath9-wave superconductor,@xcite but experimental observation of these effects has remained a challenge . in this paper , we show how the elusive phase solitons can be spontaneously formed in noncentrosymmetric superconductors in a sufficiently strong magnetic field .",
    "we focus on two - dimensional ( 2d ) noncentrosymmetric superconductors in a parallel field .",
    "these systems can be realized experimentally at an interface between two different non - superconducting materials,@xcite near a doped surface of an insulating crystal,@xcite or near the surface of a topological insulator.@xcite in all these systems the mirror symmetry between two half - spaces separated by an interface is explicitly broken .",
    "we use the two - band ginzburg - landau ( gl ) formalism@xcite modified to include first - order gradient terms ( the lifshitz invariants ) to catch the effects specific to noncentrosymmetric superconductors .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : two - band picture ] we develop a two - band description of noncentrosymmetric superconductors . in sec .",
    "[ sec : helical state ] , the helical instability in a weak magnetic field is considered and the quasiparticle spectrum in the helical state is calculated . in sec . [ sec : phase solitons ] we discuss the phase solitons and soliton lattices in a strong field .",
    "throughout the paper we use the units in which @xmath10 .",
    "in order to see how nondegenerate bands are formed in a noncentrosymmetric crystal with the so coupling , we start with the following hamiltonian of noninteracting electrons : @xmath11a^\\dagger_{\\bk s}a_{\\bk s'}.\\ ] ] here @xmath12 are spin indices , @xmath13 are the pauli matrices , @xmath14 is the band dispersion without the so coupling , and the sum over @xmath15 is restricted to the first brillouin zone .",
    "the so coupling of electrons with the crystal lattice is described by @xmath16 , which satisfies @xmath17 .",
    "the momentum dependence of the so coupling is dictated by the requirement that it must be invariant under the crystal symmetry operations , in the following sense : if @xmath18 is any operation from the point group @xmath19 of the crystal , then @xmath20 .",
    "the complete list of representative expressions for @xmath16 for all noncentrosymmetric point groups can be found in ref . .",
    "for instance , in the least symmetric case of a triclinic crystal , i.e. if @xmath21 , the direction of @xmath22 is not related to the crystallographic axes and we have @xmath23 , where the coefficients @xmath24 form a real @xmath25 matrix . in a cubic crystal with @xmath26 , which describes the point symmetry of li@xmath0(pd@xmath3,pt@xmath4)@xmath2b , the simplest form compatible with all symmetry requirements is @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is a constant .",
    "expressions become more complicated if the point group contains improper elements . for example , for the tetragonal group @xmath29 , which is relevant for cept@xmath2si , the so",
    "coupling is given by @xmath30 .",
    "since we focus on the purely 2d case , we can set @xmath31 .",
    "then the so coupling takes the rashba form : @xmath32 which was originally introduced to describe the effects of the absence of mirror symmetry in semiconductor quantum wells.@xcite    diagonalizing eq .",
    "( [ h - free ] ) we arrive at the following band dispersion functions : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is called helicity .",
    "therefore , the bands are nondegenerate ( except the lines or points where @xmath35 ) , invariant with respect to all operations from @xmath19 , and also even in @xmath15 . the last property is a consequence of time reversal symmetry .",
    "indeed , the bloch states @xmath36 and @xmath37 belong to @xmath15 and @xmath38 , respectively , and have the same energy . here",
    "@xmath39 is the time reversal operation for spin-@xmath40 particles and @xmath41 is the complex conjugation .",
    "since the bands are nondegenerate , one can write @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is a nontrivial phase factor.@xcite the latter is given by @xmath44 for the model described by eq .",
    "( [ h - free ] ) .",
    "let us now introduce an external magnetic field @xmath5 .",

    "( [ h - free ] ) , where @xmath46 is the bohr magneton , and diagonalizing the resulting hamiltonian we obtain the following energy eigenvalues : @xmath47 .",

    "this allows for the cooper pairing with a nonzero centre - of - mass momentum to occur , leading to a variety of field - induced nonuniform superconducting states , which are discussed in the subsequent sections .",
    "we assume the following hierarchy of the energy scales : @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the superconducting critical temperature , @xmath51 is the energy cutoff of the pairing interaction , and @xmath52 is the fermi energy , which is a good assumption in realistic noncentrosymmetric superconductors.@xcite then the so - split bands are sufficiently separated for the pairs to form independently in each band , and it is natural to use the basis of the helicity band eigenstates to introduce an attractive interaction between electrons in the cooper channel . following the standard bcs ideology ,",
    "we assume that the pairing interaction is only effective when the quasiparticle momenta are close to the fermi surfaces and , therefore , the interband pairing , i.e. the formation of the cooper pairs of electrons with opposite helicities , is suppressed .",
    "this leads us to the pairing hamiltonian @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the system volume and @xmath55 is the pairing interaction function .",
    "the latter has the form @xmath56 where @xmath57 can be represented as a bilinear combination of the basis functions of irreducible representations of @xmath19 and , therefore , is amenable to the usual symmetry analysis.@xcite note that the dependence of the pairing interaction on the center - of - mass momentum of the pairs is neglected , which is legitimate since @xmath58 is small compared to the fermi momenta in the two bands .",
    "the simplest model corresponds to isotropic basis functions of the unit representation , with @xmath59 the strength of intraband pairing is described by the coupling constants @xmath60 and @xmath61 , while that of interband pairing by @xmath62 .    in a uniform superconducting state , using the mean - field approximation to decouple the interaction in eq .",

( [ h_0 ] ) and ( [ h int reduced ] ) is formally similar to the two - band bcs theory,@xcite whose applications to mgb@xmath0 , iron - based superconductors , and other systems have been extensively studied recently .",
    "the order parameter is represented by two complex functions @xmath69 and @xmath70 . an obvious difference is that in our case the two bands are nondegenerate and the gap functions contain the phase factors @xmath71 .",
    "however , these phase factors do not affect the bulk observable quantities which are determined by the quasiparticle excitations , such as spin susceptibility and electronic specific heat , nor do they enter the gl free energy , which is expressed in terms of @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the order parameters in the helicity band representation are related to the singlet ( @xmath72 ) and `` protected '' triplet ( @xmath73 ) components in the spin representation as follows : @xmath74 and @xmath75 ( ref . ) . in particular , in the case of a bcs - like point attraction all the coupling constants in eq .",
    "( [ isotropic - pairing ] ) are the same : @xmath76 , and we have @xmath77 , i.e. the pairing is isotropic singlet .",
    "in the opposite case of a `` single - band '' model , either @xmath69 or @xmath70 is zero . in general , however , both components are nonzero and different , and can also depend on coordinates . in the spin representation",
    "this translates into an order parameter having both singlet and triplet components .",
    "nonuniform superconducting states are most efficiently treated using the gl formalism .",
    "the phenomenological gl functional of a noncentrosymmetric superconductor can be obtained in the standard fashion by expanding the free energy ( or , more precisely , the difference between the free energies in the superconducting and normal states ) in powers of @xmath69 and @xmath70 and their gradients and keeping all terms allowed by symmetry . in the case of a 2d noncentrosymmetric superconductor in a parallel magnetic field",
