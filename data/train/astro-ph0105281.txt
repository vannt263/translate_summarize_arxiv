    "gamma ray burst and soft gamma repeaters reached an apparent stage of maturity : tens of grbs found , finally , an x , optical and ( or ) radio transient ( the after - glow ) identification as well as some associated host galaxies at cosmic red - shifts ( bloom et all 2000 ) .",
    "new categories of grbs and sgrs events have been labeled , but even within these wider updated data no conclusive theory or even partial understanding seem to solve the old - standing grb / sgrs puzzle : the nature of the grb - sgr signals . on the contrary",
    "the wider and wider collection of data are leading to a schizophrenic attitude in the most popular isotropic models , the largest cosmic explosions ( fire - ball , hypernova , supra - nova ) with more and more phenomenological descriptions ( power laws everywhere ) and less and less unifying views .",
    "this `` give up '' attitude seem to reflect the surprising never ending morphologies of grbs .",
    "we argued on the contrary since 1994 and in particular after 1998 that grbs and sgrs find a comprehensive theory within a thin spinning and multi precessing @xmath0 jet , sprayed by a neutron star , ns , or black hole , bh ; the gamma jet is fed by electron pair gev jet in inverse compton scattering .",
    "( fargion 1994 - 1999 , fargion , salis 1995 - 1998 )",
    ". isotropic fireball models , which enjoyed a decade of total predominance , with the extreme grb energy released ( @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath4 ) , comparable to few solar masses annihilation or more , lead to a deep conflict with any energy and masses .",
    "indeed their corresponding schwarchild scale times are above milliseconds and disagree with the observed sharp grbs fine time structures much below a fraction of millisecond .",
    "fireball isotropic models simply ignored the role of thermal neutrinos which imply at least twice the observed @xmath0 energy in grbs .",
    "fireball - jet ( a crazy acronym like the spherical - knife ) mitigate the energy puzzle but can not explain the huge wide energy range among known grbs : indeed the energy power spread ( from @xmath5 @xmath6 ) for most far grbs versus @xmath7 @xmath8 for nearest grb980425 , led most fireball defenders just to neglect , hide or even reject in a very arbitrary ( and partisan ) way the nearest and best identified grb connection to a supernova , sn , explosion as sn1998bw .",
    "we naturally interpreted this event as a slightly off - axis blazing jet .",
    "we also understand the same rarity of grb - sn detection and the established grb980425-sn link as an additional evidence for the thin jet nature of grbs .",
    "even originally ( @xmath9 ) unified grb / sgr models since last fifteen years are commonly separated by their repeater and spectra differences ; however very recently they openly shared the same spectra , time and flux structures ( fargion 1998 - 99,woods et all 1999 ) .",
    "this analogy suggest a common nature .",
    "their different distances , cosmic versus galactic ones , imply different power source jet .",
    "the @xmath0 jet is born by high gevs electron pairs jet which are regenerating , via inverse compton scattering , an inner collimated beamed @xmath0 ( mevs)-(tens kevs ) x precessing jet .",
    "the thin jet ( an opening angle inverse of the electron lorentz factor , nearly milli - radiant ) , while spinning , is driven by a companion and/or an asymmetric accreting disk in a quasi periodic oscillation ( qpo ) and in a keplerian multi - precessing blazing mode : its @xmath10 ray lighthouse trembling and flashing is the source of the complex and wide structure of observed gamma bursts .",
    "these @xmath0 jets share a peak power of a supernova ( @xmath11 ) at their birth ( during sn and neutron star formations ) , decaying by power law @xmath12 @xmath13 @xmath14 to less power - full jets that converge to present persistent sgrs stages .",
    "indeed sgrs are blazing events from late relic x pulsar jet with no associated explosion ( or ot and afterglow ) observable only at nearer distances in axis .",
    "the @xmath0 jet responsable for sgr emit in general at @xmath15 @xmath16 erg@xmath17 jet powers comparable to the angular momentum losses ; it is the thin angular collimation and not the magnetar field budget , to lead to peak apparent sn powers @xmath15 ( @xmath18 ) erg@xmath17 . in analogy grb",
    "show an apparent luminosity of a sn @xmath15 ( @xmath18 ) erg@xmath17 amplified by the inverse square of the thin angle , from @xmath19 to @xmath20 radiant angle jet beaming : the corresponding solid angle @xmath21 spreads between @xmath22 and @xmath23 and the apparent amplification enjoy a huge factor:@xmath24 up to @xmath25 corresponding to grbs .",
    "optical - radio after - glows are not only the fading supernovae explosion tails often observed in puzzling variable non monotonic decay , but they exhibith the averaged external jet beamed tails moving and precessing while fading away .",
    "the rare optical re - brightening ( the so called sn bump ) observed in few afterglow might be erroneously associated to an underlying isotropic sn flash : it is probably the late re - crossing of the precessing jet periphery toward the observer direction .",
    "the integral grb - jet activity may leave a trace triggering giant arc star formations .    a convincing evidence against any explosive grb model , confirming present @xmath0 precessing jet theory , is hidden in the in the recent grb 000131 data which show an un - explicable , for fireball model , x precursor signal 7 sec long , just @xmath26 seconds before to the huge main gamma trigger .",
    "no fireball or hypernova progenitor ( binary ns or bh ) could survive such a disruptive x ray precursor power @xmath27 .",
    "+    = 6 cm",
    "as we noted above grbs are not showing any standard candle behaviours within any fireball isotropic model . some moderate wide fireball - jet ( a not conclusive compromise , like so called collapsar",
    "combining sn and open fountain - like jet explosion ) models with a large beaming ( ten degree opening ) can accommodate all cosmic grbs excluding the `` problematic '' nearest @xmath28 event keeping it out of the frame .",
    "nevertheless sgrs , which share , some time , the same grb signature , are themselves still within a popular isotropic mini - fireball scenario powered by magnetar explosive events .",
    "this model imply a magnetic energy in the neutron star at least 4 order of magnitude above the kinetic rotational energy , calling for an anomalous and unexplained energy equipartition bias .",
    "beaming may solve the puzzle within a common x - ray pulsar power .",
    "indeed the sgr1900 + 14 event batse trigger 7171 left an almost identical event comparable to a just following grb ( trigger 7172 ) on the same day , same detector , with same spectra and comparable flux .",
    "this hard - soft connection has been re - discovered and confirmed more recently by batse group : ( fargion 1998 - 1999;woods et all 1999 ) with an additional hard event of sgr 1900 + 14 recorded in grb990110 event .",
    "an additional grb - sgr connection occur between grb980706 event with an almost identical ( in time , channel spectra , morphology and intensities ) observed in grb980618 originated by sgr 1627 - 41 .",
    "nature would be very perverse in mimic two signals , ( even if at different distances and different powers ) , by two totally different source engines.the jet angle is related by a relativistic kinematics @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is found to reach @xmath31 ( fargion 1994 , 1998 ) . at first approximation the gamma constrains is given by inverse compton relation : @xmath32 for @xmath33 and @xmath34 leading to characteristic x-@xmath0 grb spectra .",
    "the origin of @xmath35 electron pairs are very probably decayed secondary related to primary inner muon pairs jets , able to cross dense stellar target .",
    "the a - dimensional photon number rate ( fargion & salis 1996 ) as a function of the observational angle @xmath36 responsible for peak luminosity has been found : @xmath37^{4}}\\ , \\theta _ { 1}\\approx \\frac{1}{(\\theta _ { 1})^{3 } } \\;\\;.\\label{eq4}\\ ] ] the total fluence at minimal impact angle @xmath38 responsible for the average luminosity is @xmath39^{4 } } \\ , \\theta _ { 1}\\ , d\\theta _ { 1}\\simeq \\frac{1}{(\\ , \\theta _ { 1m})^{2}}\\;\\;\\;. \\label{eq5}\\ ] ] these spectra fit grbs observed ones ( fargion & salis 1995 ) . assuming a beam jet intensity @xmath40 comparable with maximal sn luminosity , @xmath41 , and replacing this value in adimensional expressions above we find a maximal apparent grb power for beaming angles @xmath42 , @xmath43 within observed ones .",
    "we also assume a power law jet time decay as follows @xmath44 where ( @xmath45 or @xmath46 ) able to reach , at 1000 years time scales , the present known galactic microjet ( as ss433 ) intensities powers : @xmath47 .",
    "we used the model to evaluate if april 1998 precessing jet might hit us once again ( as it possibly did on grb980712 ) .",
    "it should be noted that a steady angular velocity would imply ( during the earliest few hours ) an average intensity variability ( @xmath48 ) corresponding to some of the earliest afterglow decay law . at later stages",
    "a rare re - beaming of the precessing jet combined with a power jet decay may alter the afterglow decay power law .",
    "such a jet blazing beaming and re - hitting may be the source of rarest re - brightening observed on grb980508 and on grb000301c after - glows .",
    "we imagine the precessing jet nature as the late stages of jets fueled by a disk or a companion ( wd , ns ) star .",
    "their binary angular velocity @xmath49 reflects the beam evolution @xmath50 or more generally a multi - precessing angle @xmath51 ( fargion & salis 1996 ) :          where @xmath38 is the minimal angle impact parameter of the jet toward the observer , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 are , in the order , the maximal opening precessing angles due to the binary , spinning pulsar , nutation mode of the jet axis .",
    "additional multi precessions are also possible leading to more complex and realistic @xmath0 burst evolution .",
    "the angular velocities combined in the multi - precession keep memory of the pulsar jet spin ( @xmath58 ) , the precession by the binary @xmath49 and an additional nutation due to inertial momentum anisotropies or beam - accretion disk torques ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "the relativistic morphology of the jet and its multi - precession is the source of the puzzling complex @xmath60-@xmath0 spectra signature of grbs and sgrs .",
    "its inner internal jet contain , following the relativistic inverse compton scattering , hardest and rarest beamed gevs - mevs photons ( as the rarest egret grb940217 one ) but its external jet cones are dressed by softer and softer photons .",
    "this onion like multi jets is not totally axis symmetric : it does nt appear on front as a concentric ring serial ; while turning and spraying around it is deformed ( often ) into an elliptical off - axis concentric rings preceded by the internal harder center leading to a common hard to soft grbs ( and sgrs ) train signal . in our present model and simulation this internal effect has been here neglected without any major consequence .",
    "the complex variability of grbs and sgrs are simulated successfully by the equations and the consequent geometrical beamed jet blazing leading to the observed @xmath61 signatures . as shown in fig .",
    "3 the slightly different precessing configurations could easely mimic the wide morphology of grbs and sgrs as well as the surprising rare x - ray precursor observed in fig.1.2 and simulated below for an event comparable to sgr1900 + 14 on august 1998 . in conclusion",
    "the x - ray precursor must occur often around main sgr @xmath0 event .",
    "we predict that such precessing jet imprint must be soon found by continous monitoring of active sgrs .",
    "the very recent discover of such x - ray precursors ( feroci m. et all , gcn 1060 ) , at 2537 , 755 , and 444 s before the giant flare on 18 april with durations of 100 , 125 and 55 ms , give additional support to our model predictions .",
