    "the higgs boson is the last particle of the standard model remaining to be confirmed experimentally .",
    "inclusive searches in decay channels such as @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and associated production have been performed at the tevatron and are being started at the lhc . however the search for the higgs boson at low mass is complicated due to the huge background coming from qcd jet events .",
    "especially the @xmath4 channel , dominant for @xmath5 , is very difficult at the tevatron and literally impossible at the lhc .",
    "thus other possibilities have been investigated , in particular using the exclusive diffractive production @xcite . in such processes",
    "both incoming hadrons , @xmath6 at the tevatron and @xmath7 at the lhc , remain intact after the interaction and the higgs decays in the central region .",
    "the process involves the exchange of a color singlet and large rapidity gaps remain between the higgs and the outgoing hadrons . at the tevatron it is not possible to produce exclusively the higgs boson due to the tiny cross section .",
    "however other particles , or systems of particles , can be produced , _",
    "i.e. _ a pair of jets ( a dijet ) , @xmath8 or @xmath3 , as long as they have @xmath9 quantum numbers .    since the incoming hadrons remain intact , lose a part of their energy and are scattered at very small angles , it is experimentally possible to measure all final state particles , including the scattered protons .",
    "this can be done using detectors inserted close to the beam pipe at a large distance from the interaction point . besides , at the tevatron and for low luminosity at the lhc , it is also possible to use the rapidity gap method to select such events .",
    "a big advantage of the exclusive production of the higgs boson is a very accurate mass determination from the measurement of the scattered proton energy loss  @xcite .",
    "in addition , if the higgs is observed in this mode at the lhc it ensures it is a @xmath9 particle  @xcite .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we give an introduction to the theoretical description of exclusive production and introduce two models : the khoze , martin , ryskin ( kmr ) and the cudell , hernndez , ivanov , dechambre exclusive ( chide ) model , and also discuss the sources of their uncertainties . in section",
    "iii the forward physics monte carlo ( fpmc ) program is presented and the implementation of both models is discussed .",
    "section iv focuses on the cdf measurement of exclusive jets production and shows that both models give similar , reasonable descriptions of the data . in section",
    "v we analyze the uncertainties using the chide model as an example .",
    "predictions for exclusive production at the lhc are given in section vi , where in addition we study the possibility of constraining the higgs production at the lhc from early lhc exclusive jets measurement .",
    "finally , conclusions are given in section vii .",
    "the exclusive production can be modeled in the qcd framework where the process was described as a two - gluon exchange between quarks  one gluon involved in the production and the other one screening the color .",
    "such calculation requires an analytic evaluation of a set of feynman diagrams that describe the production of a color - singlet and keep the color of initial particles , _",
    "e.g. _ fig .",
    "[ fig_scheme_a ] .",
    "the calculation is well - known and under theoretical control  @xcite .",
    "it can be performed using cutting rules or direct integration within the kinematic regime where the momentum lost by the initial particles is small .",
    "however this simple model is not enough and to make a description more realistic soft and higher order corrections need to be added , see @xcite . in the following we give a short description of these corrections .",
    "the impact factor  @xcite regulates the infra - red divergence and embeds quarks inside the proton as represented in fig .",
    "[ fig_scheme_b ] .",
    "the impact factor is based on a skewed unintegrated gluon density but its exact form depends on the model considered .",
    "the sudakov form factor  @xcite is one of the most important ingredients of the calculation .",
    "it corresponds to virtual vertex correction ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_scheme_c ] ) and depends on two scales .",
    "the hard scale is linked to the hard subprocess ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the soft scale is related to the transverse momentum of the active gluons  the scale from which a virtual parton can be emitted .",
    "the sudakov form factor suppresses the cross section by a factor of the order of 100 to 1000 .",
    "finally , additional pomeron exchanges between the initial and final state protons can occur  @xcite , as schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_scheme_d ] .",
    "this can lead to the production of additional particles that might fill the gap created at the parton level .",
    "it is taken into account by introducing the rapidity gap survival probability , which is a probability of not having any additional soft interactions .",
    "each piece of the calculation can be investigated separately and its uncertainties can be estimated .",
    "the important point is that some of the corrections are identical in all exclusive processes so that they can be studied in one particular process and used to predict the cross section of any process .",
    "the most quoted and first complete calculation is done in the khoze , martin and ryskin  ( kmr ) model from the durham group .",
    "one can find here the main lines , referring the reader to  @xcite for a review .",
    "the cross section ( @xmath11 ) of the process represented schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig_durhamcep ] , is assumed to factorize between the effective luminosity  @xmath12 and the hard subprocess  @xmath13 :    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the centrally produced system . in particular",

    "one can also recognize in turn , the gap survival probability  @xmath21 and the  @xmath22-slope of the cross section with  @xmath23  gev@xmath24 ( taken from the fit to the soft hadronic data  @xcite ) , introduced assuming that the dependence of the hard cross section on the final proton transverse momentum is small .",
    "the subprocess cross section for higgs production , @xmath25 , includes an additional  factor  @xmath26 fixed to  1.5 , which takes into account next - to - leading - order corrections .",
    "the effective luminosity is given by    @xmath27    @xmath28 is the hard scale and the variables are defined in fig .",

    "one can note that the sudakov form factor  @xmath35    @xmath36,\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    with  @xmath37 and  @xmath38 the transverse and longitudinal components of the additional emission , is here included in the differentiation . @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the quark and gluon splitting functions . in the kmr model ,",
    "the presence of the sudakov form factor makes the integration infra - red stable and it is assumed to provide applicability of perturbative  qcd . according to a calculation at single - log accuracy of the durham group  @xcite :    @xmath41    where @xmath42 is the mass of the centrally produced system .",
    "these results were recently re - evaluated in  @xcite giving new values for higgs production :    @xmath43    this correction leads to approximately a factor 2 suppression in the cross section .    the kmr model has been developed for years and is one of the most complete since it includes different types of exclusive diffractive production ,  _ i.e. _ from higgs ,  dijet ,  @xmath3 , di - quark , @xmath8 ,  @xmath44  to supersymmetric particles , and shows results in agreement with the available data  @xcite .",
    "an other available model is the cudell , hernndez , ivanov , dechambre exclusive ( chide ) model  @xcite for jets and sm  higgs boson production .",
    "the structure of this model is similar to the one of the kmr model but differs in the implementation and details of the different ingredients . in the chide model the cross section for the exclusive process shown in fig .",

    "the exact transverse kinematics is kept in all ingredients .",
    "contrary to the kmr model the colour neutrality of the proton is implemented independently of the sudakov suppression in the impact factor .",
    "it includes the skewed unintegrated gluon density and this phenomenological model of the proton includes soft physics based on both the data ( elastic cross section , proton structure functions ) and theory ( dipole picture , light - cone wavefunctions ) .",
    "it takes into account the proton wavefunction as the impact factor goes to zero if one of the transverse momentum of the  @xmath22-channel gluons goes to zero and the non - zero transverse momentum transfer is introduced via a universal exponential factor .",
    "the unintegrated gluon density is built on the sum of two terms that take care respectively of the hard and soft behavior of the proton structure function .",
    "the hard component is based on direct differentiation of the well - known gluon density ( grv  @xcite , mrs  @xcite and cteq  @xcite ) .",
    "the soft component models soft colour - singlet exchanges in the non - perturbative regime in the spirit of the dipole picture .",
    "this gives space for a contribution of the non - perturbative regime of  qcd .",
    "it was made in a phenomenological way and therefore is not unique . actually , four different fits are provided , all giving similar @xmath52 when adjusted to the  @xmath53 data  @xcite .",
    "the main difference between the fits is the parametrisation of the soft region    in particular , the transition scale from the soft to the hard regime .",
    "they represent the present uncertainty on the unintegrated gluon distributions .    the sudakov form factor is identical to  eq .",
    "( [ eq_sudakov ] ) .",
    "the upper limit is taken at the higgs mass according to the recent result  @xcite in the higgs case but for dijet production it is fixed to the hard - transverse momentum in the vertex .",
    "note that in this model  @xmath54 and nlo corrections ( @xmath26 factor ) were also introduced for the higgs production .",
    "the parton level computation is well understood and very precise .",
    "however the impact factor , sudakov form factor and rapidity gap survival probability can not be calculated preturbatively and have to be modeled or parametrized .",
    "this introduces non - negligible uncertainties that need to be discussed .",
    "three main sources of uncertainties can be identified concerning the prediction of the exclusive jet or higgs boson cross section .",
    "the first one is the uncertainty on the gap survival probability . at @xmath7 or @xmath55",
    "colliders additional soft interactions can destroy the gap in forward region or even the proton itself . while the tevatron measurement leads to a survival probability of 0.1 ,",
    "the value at the lhc is still to be measured .",
    "we assume in the following a value of 0.03 at the lhc  @xcite and all mentioned cross sections need to be corrected once the value of the survival probability has been measured .",
    "the two other sources of uncertainties and their effects on the exclusive cross sections , namely the uncertainty on the unintegrated gluon distribution in the proton and the constant terms in the sudakov form factor , will be discussed in the next paragraphs . in the chide model",
    ", the gluon density in the impact factor contains a soft and a hard part .",
    "the hard part is known very well , mainly from the dis structure function  @xmath53 and vector meson data  @xcite , but the soft one comes from a phenomenological parametrisation which leads to uncertainties in both the dijet and the higgs calculation .    in the dijet",
    "exclusive cross section , the main uncertainty comes from the limits of the sudakov integral , which have not yet been fixed by a theoretical calculation .",
    "therefore instead of eq .",
    "( [ eq_sudakov ] ) in the chide model the following is used :    @xmath56 , \\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    where two additional parameters , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , are included . in the higgs exclusive case",
    ", the log structure of the sudakov form factor has been calculated to single - log accuracy and the complete one loop result can be taken into account by adjusting the upper limit to  @xmath59 , the lower limit is @xmath60 with  @xmath61=1,2 .",
    "however , this calculation does not take into account the importance of the constant terms that can not be exponentiated but have important contributions when the coupling is running  @xcite . to evaluate this theoretical uncertainty",
    ", we include the effect of changing the constant terms by changing the lower scale .",
    "this gives a upper bound for the uncertainty on the higgs exclusive calculation because no uncertainty is related to the lower scale itself  @xcite .",
    "we discuss these uncertainties in more detail in sec .",
    "v , where we study the effect of varying these parameters and changing the gluon densities .",
    "we also compare the results to the existing data .",
    "all models described above have been implemented in the forward physics monte carlo ( fpmc ) @xcite , a generator that has been designed to study forward physics , especially at the lhc .",
    "it aims to provide the user a variety of diffractive processes in one common framework using herwig  @xcite for hadronisation .",
    "in particular the following processes have been implemented in fpmc : single diffraction , double pomeron exchange , central exclusive production ( including the direct implementation of kmr and chide models ) and two - photon exchange ( including anomalous couplings between gauge bosons ) .",
    "the implementation of the kmr and chide models in fpmc allows a direct comparison of both models using the same framework . in fig .",
    "[ models ] , we display the cross section of exclusive higgs boson production at the lhc for a center - of - mass energy of 14 tev as a function of the higgs boson mass .",
    "in addition , we display the predictions from the kmr original calculation  @xcite and the results of the implementation of the kmr model in the exhume generator  @xcite .",
    "the difference in the results between the fpmc and exhume implementations of the kmr model is the effect of two factors .",
    "the first one is the different treatment of the gluon distribution in eq .",
    "( [ eq_kmrlumi ] ) . in exhume",
    "the value of the gluon distribution is frozen for small @xmath62 ( about ) , whereas in fpmc we integrate from @xmath63 .",
    "in fact both solutions can lead to uncertainties , therefore the better way is to introduce the modeling of the soft region , which has been done in the chide model .",
    "the other reason of the disagreement between fpmc and exhume is the different implementation of the hard subprocess . in fpmc",
    "the higgs is produced and then its decay is performed , whereas the exhume implementation involves calculation of the higgs propagator .",
    "the difference on the higgs production cross section between the kmr and chide models is clearly visible .",
    "the chide model leads to a smaller cross section and shows a steeper dependence on the higgs boson mass . a similar difference between models",
    "can be observed for the exclusive jet production at the lhc , see fig .",
    "[ models_jets ] . the cross section obtained with the kmr model is higher than the chide prediction and a difference in slope is also visible .",
    "however , as we will see in the following , these differences are within the uncertainties of the models .    in order to compare the kmr and chide models with the measurements performed by the cdf collaboration at the tevatron the output of the fpmc generator was interfaced with a cone jet algorithm of radius 0.7 as used by the cdf collaboration .",
    "to test the kmr and chide models and their implementation in fpmc , the first step is to compare their predictions with the measurements performed in the cdf collaboration at the tevatron .",
    "the advantage of fpmc is that we can compare directly the theoretical calculations with the cdf measurement since we use , at the particle level , a 0.7 jet cone algorithm as used by the cdf collaboration .",
    "cdf measured the so called dijet mass fraction as a function of the jets minimum transverse energy @xmath64 after tagging the antiproton in dedicated roman pot detectors , and requesting a rapidity gap devoid of any activity in the proton direction to ensure that only double pomeron exchange events are selected .",
    "the dijet mass fraction is defined as the ratio of the dijet mass divided by the total mass of the event computed using the calorimeter . if an exclusive event is produced , it is expected that the dijet mass fraction will be close to 1 since only two jets and nothing else are produced in the event .",
    "on the contrary , inclusive diffractive events show some energy loss due to pomeron remnants and the dijet mass fraction will be mainly distributed at values lower than 1 .",
    "the dijet mass fraction distribution allowed the cdf collaboration to separate the exclusive and inclusive diffractive contributions and to measure the exclusive diffractive dijet cross section as a function of the minimum jet @xmath65  @xcite .",
    "the predictions of the kmr and chide models are compared to the cdf measurement in fig .",
    "a good agreement is found between the cdf measurement and the predictions of both chide and kmr models and the difference between the models is small compared to the data uncertainties .",
    "one should notice that the data suggest slightly different dependence on @xmath64 that the models , however it can just be a matter of statistical fluctuation .",
    "[ mjj_kmr_chide ] displays the dijet mass ( @xmath66 ) distribution predicted by the kmr and chide models .",
    "the difference in slope is very small , kmr leading to a slightly steeper dependence .",
    "in addition to the jet @xmath65 threshold dependence , the cdf collaboration published the exclusive jets cross section as a function of the dijet mass .",
    "the dijet mass cross section is not a direct measurement but was extracted by the cdf collaboration from the jet @xmath65 threshold cross section data .",
    "the method is to compare the prediction of a given model ( for instance kmr ) with the direct measurement of the jet @xmath65 threshold cross section .",
    "the mc predictions are then reweighted to the cdf measurement in each bin of @xmath64 ( namely 10 , 15 , 20 , 25 , and 30 gev ) to obtain the cdf exclusive dijet mass cross section  measurement \" .",
    "the cdf  measurement \" can then be compared to the kmr or chide models .",
    "it is worth noticing that this method is clearly mc dependent since there is not a direct correspondence between the jet @xmath65 and dijet mass dependence .",
    "this is why we had to redo this study independently for each model , namely kmr and chide .",
    "the comparisons between the cdf  measurements \" and the models predictions are given in figs .",
    "[ mjj_kmr_cdf ] and [ mjj_chide_cdf ] for the kmr and chide models , respectively .",
    "we stress once more that the cdf",
    " measurements \" , displayed in both figures as black points , are model - dependent because of the method used to extract them , and the  data \" points are different in both figures .",
    "we note a good agreement between the cdf extracted measurements and the kmr and chide models displayed as gray histograms .",
    "after having compared both kmr and chide predictions to the present available high - mass measurements from the tevatron , we discuss in this section the uncertainties of the model predictions especially for exclusive higgs boson production at the lhc . in the following",
    "we discuss the uncertainties of the chide model .    to check the uncertainty due to the gluon distributions four different parametrisations of unintegrated skewed gluon densities are used to compute the exclusive jets and higgs boson cross sections . as we mentioned in sec",
    "ii , these four gluon densities represent the uncertainty spread due to the present knowledge on unintegrated parton distribution functions .",
    "the first step is to check if these different unintegrated gluon distributions are compatible with data .",
    "[ gluonstevatron ] shows the comparison between the cdf measurement and the predictions of the chide model using the four different gluon distributions described above .",
    "all gluon densities lead to a fair agreement with the data .",
    "the measurement seems to favour fit  4 , but one needs to remember that other parameters of the model , such as the cut off used in the sudakov form factor can modify the cross section as we will see in the following .",
    "there is an interplay between the different gluon distributions and the scales used in the model .",
    "the default gluon density used in the chide model is fit 4 , which shows the highest soft contribution and predicts the highest cross section .",
    "[ gluonslhcjets ] and [ gluonslhchiggs ] show the predictions of the chide model with the same four gluon densities for the exclusive dijet and exclusive higgs at the lhc .",
    "the uncertainty on the exclusive cross sections due to the different gluon distributions is about a factor of 3.5 for jets and 2 for higgs boson , respectively .            for higgs boson production at the lhc",
    "the uncertainty coming from the different fits is given by  fig .",
    "[ gluonslhchiggs ] . using fpmc",
    ", one has the possibility to study the uncertainty coming from the use of unintegrated gluon density in models similar to the kmr model .",
    "this is done by changing the lower cut - off in the unintegrated gluon .",
    "the bands showed in figs .",
    "[ gluonslhcjets ] and [ gluonslhchiggs ] correspond to a variation of this cut - off on the gluon distribution from 1.26  gev@xmath24 ( the minimal value at which the gluon distribution mrst2002 is known ) to 3  gev@xmath24 .",
    "the difference is small but not negligible .",
    "in addition to the uncertainty due to the unintegrated gluon distribution , we consider the additional uncertainties due to the values of integration limits in the sudakov form factor , see eq .",
    "( [ eq_sudakov_chide ] ) .",
    "contrary to the kmr model , the chide model does not fix the limits of integration in the sudakov form factor in the dijet case . in the higgs case ,",
    "the upper scale is fixed to @xmath67 and only the lower scale can be varied .",
    "the lower integration limit is given by the @xmath58 parameter and the default value for fit4 is 0.5 , originally chosen @xcite to describe the cdf data .",
    "increasing the @xmath58  value increases the values of the integral and reduces the cross section . decreasing @xmath58 leads to the opposite .",
    "varying @xmath58 by a reasonable factor of 2 up and down modifies the cross section by a large factor up to 5 for all considered processes , namely jet production at the tevatron ( see fig .  [ lowerscaletevatron ] ) , jet production at the lhc ( see fig .  [ lowerscalelhcjets ] ) and higgs boson production at the lhc ( see fig .",
    "[ lowerscalelhchiggs ] ) .",
    "the upper limit of the integration is specified by the parameter @xmath57 . as already mentioned in section ii , the value of the upper limit for the higgs boson production has been fixed by the calculation to 1.0 ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "although it still contributes to the total uncertainty for the jet production cross section , its effect is much smaller for lower limit ( see figs .",
    "[ upperscaletevatron ] and [ upperscalelhcjets ] for the jet cross section at the tevatron and at the lhc respectively ) .",
    "the default value of the @xmath57 parameter is 0.5 , which we vary again by a factor 2 .",
    "decreasing its value leads to an increase of the jet cross section .",
    "the effect is indeed visible at tevatron energies ( fig .",
    "[ upperscaletevatron ] ) while it is negligible at the lhc for @xmath64 above ( fig .",
    "[ upperscalelhcjets ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that this is quite different from changing the @xmath58 parameter .    from this analysis",
    "it follows that the uncertainty related to the exclusive diffractive production is dominated by the uncertainty of the lower sudakov limit ( that gives a rough estimation of the uncertainty coming from the constant terms in the sudakov form factor ) for both jet and the higgs boson production .",
    "also , at the lhc the uncertainty of the upper limit can be neglected .",
    "however this does not lead to a good estimation of the total uncertainties on the higgs cross section at the lhc .",
    "we need to check that the variation of those parameters are compatible with the cdf measurement . in the next section",
    ", we will study how to calculate the total uncertainty and how to reduce it  for the higgs boson production  using a possible early measurement of exclusive jet at the lhc .",
    "to make predictions for higgs boson production at the lhc , we need to constrain the model parameters using the tevatron data . the basic idea is to fit the model parameters to the cdf measurement and extrapolate the model to the center - of - mass energy of the lhc .",
