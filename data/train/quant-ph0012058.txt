    "entanglement @xcite has been recognized as one of the most puzzling features of quantum mechanics , being also the basis of quantum information processing @xcite . however , to realize protocols like quantum key distribution or quantum teleportation @xcite one needs of maximally entangled states which are not easy to generate ( due to loss and decoherence ) .",
    "thus entanglement purification is often required to distill maximum entangled states from several pairs of partial entangled states by using local quantum operation and classical communications @xcite .    for qubit systems , efficient entanglement purification protocols have been found @xcite .",
    "recently , quantum information protocols have been also extended to continuos variable systems @xcite .",
    "in particular , in ref .",
    "@xcite an efficient continuos variable entanglement purification protocol has been proposed . here , a physical implementation of this protocol , based on ponderomotive effect is studied .",
    "the protocol is based on the possibility of a local quantum nondemolition ( qnd ) measurement of the total excitation number of continuos variables . on the other hand",
    "the principle underlying a method of measuring electromagnetic energy avoiding photon absorption has been known for approximately a hundred years : measure the electromagnetic pressure associated with the energy by an experiment like that of peotr n. lebedev , and from that pressure infer the energy .",
    "hence , we shall consider such _ ponderomotive meter _",
    "@xcite for entanglement purification .",
    "it is well known @xcite that two - mode squeezed states can be generated as intracavity stationary state from the broadband squeezed light provided by a nondegenerate optical parametric amplifier ( nopa ) operating below threshold .",
    "let us now suppose that the two modes characterize two different cavities .",
    "the latter are also placed in two distant sides , say @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "then , the steady state of the cavity modes @xmath2 ( in the a side ) and @xmath3 ( in the b side ) can be written as @xmath4 where @xmath5 $ ] is the squeezing operator with the squeezing parameter @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "now , let us consider another pair of modes , say @xmath7 ( in the a side ) and @xmath8 ( in the b side ) , in the same state , i.e. @xmath9 . furthermore ,",
    "suppose that the @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) modes @xmath12 , belong to the same cavity in the a ( b ) side .",
    "for instance , they have the same frequency @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) , but they distinguish for their polarization . then , the state of the whole system is @xmath15 , where @xmath16 ( @xmath12 ) is a two - mode squeezed state @xmath17 with @xmath18 .",
    "the state @xmath15 represents two pairs of partial entangled states .    following the avenue sketched in ref.@xcite we choose to make a qnd measurement of the total number of photons in the a side . to this end",
    "we exploit a ponderomotive meter @xcite .",
    "a suspended mirror provides an intuitive realization of such meter @xcite , however , a more realistic apparatus can be realized by using for example a cavity made by a piezoelectric crystal coated on both sides @xcite . for a piezoelectric crystal ,",
    "the length variation due to radiation pressure can be measured by a suitable electric circuit .",
    "a simple model to describe the coupling of a ponderomotive meter with the a modes , is obtained as straightforward generalization of that presented in refs.@xcite .",
    "let @xmath19 the oscillatory mode characterizing the meter and @xmath20 its frequency , then the hamiltonian ( in natural unit ) governing the measurement dynamics is @xmath21   \\left(c+c^{\\dag}\\right)\\,,\\ ] ] with @xmath22 the coupling constant between signal and meter .",
    "the interaction part of the hamiltonian ( fourth term in eq.([h ] ) ) , simply represents the effect of the radiation pressure force which causes the instantaneous displacement @xmath23 of the meter @xcite .",
    "here , @xmath24 , @xmath25 are the meter position and momentum quadratures respectively .    on the other hand , the meter would be connected with a readout apparatus , and this can be modeled as a heath bath @xcite . in particular , a meter undergoing quantum brownian motion can be described by the following master equation @xcite @xmath26 -i\\frac{\\gamma}{2}\\left[x,\\left\\{p,\\rho\\right\\}\\right ] -\\frac{\\gamma}{\\beta}\\left[x,\\left[x,\\rho\\right]\\right]\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the damping rate and @xmath28 the parameter proportional to the inverse of the temperature . by assuming the meter initially in the vacuum ,",
    "the initial state of the whole system is @xmath29 , one can solve eq.([master ] ) by introducing the following characteristic function @xmath30 where @xmath31 indicate the density matrix elements of radiation fields built up with ` ket ' and ` bra ' having total number of photons @xmath32 and @xmath33 respectively .",
    "then , eq.([master ] ) can be transformed in a partial differential equation for the characteristic function ( [ chi ] ) .",
    "the latter , in turn , due to its linearity allows a simple gaussian solution . without going down in the details of calculations ,",
    "it is possible to see that , in the limit @xmath34 , the following steady state is reached @xmath35\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 denotes the displacement operator @xcite , and @xmath37 .",
    "moreover , @xmath38 is the thermal state of the meter .",
    "practically , the dynamics leading to the state ( [ rhoss ] ) corresponds to the ` collapse ' of wavefunction due to the measurement process @xcite .",
    "once @xmath27 becomes large ( strong meter - environment interaction ) , the model provides an idealized limit of real measurement process .",
    "notice that by using the quantum brownian motion master equation no rotating wave approximation has been invoked , differently from ref.@xcite where the quantum optical master equation was used in an analog measurement model .",
    "the radiation fields state corresponding to the meter outcome @xmath23 is then obtained by projecting ( [ rhoss ] ) onto the meter eigenstate @xmath39 @xcite , that is @xmath40|x\\rangle_m \\nonumber\\\\ & & |n_1\\rangle_{a_1}\\langle m_1|\\otimes    \\otimes|n_1\\rangle_{b_1}\\langle m_1|\\otimes    normalization constant is given by @xmath41|x\\rangle_m\\,,\\ ] ] and @xmath42|x\\rangle_m= \\frac{1-e^{-\\beta}}{\\sqrt{\\pi } } \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{e^{-\\beta}}{2^n n ! } \\exp\\left[-\\left(x+\\sqrt{2}\\kappa n\\right)^2\\right ] h_n^2\\left[x+\\sqrt{2}\\kappa n\\right]\\,,\\ ] ] with @xmath43 the hermite polynomials .",
    "the normalization constant ( [ caln ] ) depends on the value of the outcome @xmath23 , and gives the meter position distribution @xmath44 , that is @xmath45 .",
    "let us now assume for the sake of simplicity @xmath46 , i.e. the meter goes in a coherent state of amplitude @xmath47 @xcite . then , fig.([pepfig1 ] ) shows a typical distribution of outcomes .",
    "different peaks correspond to different values of @xmath32 , from the right to the left @xmath48 .",
    "notice that in order to distinguish all possible values of @xmath32 one should have the minimum amount of displacement ( corresponding to @xmath49 ) greater than the width of a coherent state , i.e. @xmath50 .",
    "therefore , the measurement efficiency increases monotonically with the signal - meter correlation .",
    "at the end of the measurement process the partial density operator can be obtained by tracing eq.([rhorad ] ) over the a side @xmath51|x\\rangle_m\\ ;     \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] one can easily see from the above expression ( [ rhob ] ) that the state @xmath52 is an eigenstate of the reduced density operator @xmath53|x\\rangle_m\\,.\\ ] ]    now , the measure of entanglement for a pure bipartite system is just the von neumann entropy of either partial density operator @xcite . hence , it can be written as @xcite @xmath54\\,,\\ ] ] where the dependence from @xmath23 indicates the dependence from the outcome of measurement .",
    "furthermore , the quantity @xmath55 defines the entanglement increase ratio , once @xmath56 identifies the initial amount of entanglement .",
    "of course , if @xmath57 , the state after the measurement is more entangled with respect to the initial one .",
    "prior the measurement we have @xmath58 and therefore @xmath59\\,,\\ ] ] which is obviously not depending on @xmath23 .",
    "furthermore , it results equal to the entanglement of a single pair times the number of pairs .    in fig .",
    "( [ pepfig2 ] ) the entanglement increasing ratio @xmath60 is shown as function of the measured value of position quadrature @xmath23 and coupling constant @xmath49 .",
    "we may see that for @xmath61 the entanglement remain the same since the meter is practically uncorrelated with the signal . on the other hand ,",
    "the result @xmath62 ( corresponding to @xmath63 ) never increases the entanglement . for @xmath64",
    ", @xmath60 grows up approximately as @xmath23 diminishes ; however , one should take into account that the probability to get large negative values of @xmath23 decreases , as can be seen from fig.([pepfig1 ] ) .",
    "then , it is useful to introduce the probability of success of the protocol @xmath65 where integration is performed over the set @xmath66 , with @xmath67 defining the lower limit for the success ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath69 is plotted in fig.([pepfig3].a ) for @xmath70 ( solid line ) and for @xmath71 ( dashed line ) .",
    "one can see that an higher increment of the degree of entanglement is achieved by increasing the value of @xmath49 , but with a lower probability .",
    "it is also instructive to consider the efficiency of the protocol .",
    "it can be defined as @xmath72 where @xmath73 represents the average of the entanglement increase ratio weighted on the probability of success .",
    "it always results @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "fig.([pepfig3].b ) ( solid line ) shows the efficiency of the protocol .",
    "contrarily to what one can expect for a better resolution of the number of photons , the efficiency does not increase monotonically with @xmath49 . instead , there exist a particular value of @xmath49 that maximizes the efficiency , and it is slightly greater than the width of the final meter state .",
    "in fact , for such value of @xmath49 , a measurement giving a result , say @xmath23 , different from zero can not be identified with a particular value of @xmath32 , but it practically corresponds to any @xmath76 , thus improving the efficiency of the purification process . as matter of fact",
    "we have seen in fig.([pepfig2 ] ) that @xmath60 exceeds @xmath77 for @xmath76 ( essentially @xmath78 ) .",
    "however , this limit , hence the optimal value of @xmath49 , also depends on the initial amount of entanglement , i.e. on the squeezing parameter @xmath6 .",
    "fig.([pepfig3].b ) ( dashed line ) shows the thermal effects on the efficiency of the purification protocol .",
    "in such a case the distribution @xmath79 becomes broader , hence , the protocol results less efficient for @xmath49 maximizing @xmath80 at @xmath46 .",
    "however , the effect of temperature is somehow equivalent to decreasing the coupling constant @xmath49 , in fact for @xmath81 it should be @xmath82 .",
    "hence the thermal effect can be hindered by increasing @xmath49 .",
    "the extension of previous arguments yields @xmath49 slightly greater than @xmath83 as criteria for efficient protocol .",
    "notice that smaller values of @xmath28 could be considered obtaining the same behavior @xcite .",
    "finally , the developed theory can be extended to consider more than two radiation field pairs per side .",
    "consequently , the efficiency of the protocol can be improved .",
    "furthermore , in this scheme , all the modes in one side can be considered belonging to the same cavity , at least in the side where the measurement is performed ( a ) . however , in that case the coupling constant becomes mode depending since we have to account for the mode spacing .",
    "in conclusion , the role of a ponderomotive meter in entanglement purification process is studied .",
    "it is found that there exist optimal values of the signal - meter coupling constant , contrarily from what one can expect by a simple analysis on indirect measurement .",
    "the purification process results sensible to the thermal effects introduced by the meter , however , appropriate signal - meter coupling reduces such detrimental effects .",
    "it is worth noting that a wide range of @xmath49 values are accessible for movable mirrors with the present technology @xcite .",
    "otherwise , microfabricated cantilevers @xcite could be also employed .",
    "furthermore , a large number of pairs involved in the process renders it more efficient .",
    "since radiation pressure allows to couple macroscopic objects ( like mirrors ) with microscopic systems ( like cavity modes ) , it provides a unique bridge between quantum and classical worlds .",
    "hence , optomechanical systems are worth studying , also for quantum information processing .    finally , ponderomotive effects come out also in the dispersive regime of atom - field interaction @xcite , where the atomic momentum becomes sensible to the photon statistics , and a scheme analogous to that described can be developed with atoms crossing a cavity .",
    "in such a case the thermal effects should be less significant .",
