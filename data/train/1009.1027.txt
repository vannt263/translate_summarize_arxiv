    "interfaces and surfaces are present in practically all devices and their detailed structure is typically crucial for the overall device functionality @xcite .",

    "oxide surfaces are in direct contact with the environment and the oxygen content of this environment will therefore have a strong influence on the termination of the oxide",
    ". however , it is by no means clear how a surrounding could easily influence the composition at interfaces ( which are by definition buried and insulated from the gaseous environment ) .",
    "in fact , we have shown @xcite that adapting and applying this ait - se method to the tic / alumina interface predicts a structure and composition that possesses essentially no binding across the interface .",
    "this result is evidently in conflict with the actual use of chemical vapour deposited ( cvd ) tic / alumina multilayers as wear - resistant coating on cemented - carbide cutting - tools @xcite .",
    "the present paper demonstrates that realistic descriptions of deposition environments are crucial for characterising thin - film and interface compositions and , as a consequence , adhesion to the underlying substrate .",
    "we show how effects of a steady - state deposition environment ( for example cvd ) can be embedded into atomistic modelling .",
    "we employ a method of _ ab - initio _ thermodynamics of deposition growth ( ait - dg ) @xcite , but extend it here to suit the more complex problem of understanding thin - film formation and corresponding as - deposited interfaces .",

    "the fundamental strategy is to compare free energies of reaction associated with thin - film configurations that differ in their detailed chemical composition .",

    "in ref .  , we have presented an _ ab initio _ structure search for thin - film alumina on tic .",

    "all configurations approach the full stoichiometry in the thick - film limit .",
    "they essentially differ in chemical composition only at the interface , surface , or both .",

    "however , no appreciable adhesion is found at interfaces of this type .",
    "these interfaces separate into a tic substrate covered with a full layer of o ( tic / o ) and a fully stoichiometric alumina overlayer .",
    "the electronic structure shows that the electron density essentially vanishes between the tic / o and the alumina , ruling out a significant covalent binding .",
    "furthermore , the al ions at the interface relax into the first o layer above the tic / o , ruling out significant ionic binding .    in the present work",

    "the non - binding character at interface class a is clearly in conflict with the wear - resistance of tic / alumina multilayers @xcite .",
    "we attribute this conflict to the fact that alumina does neither maintain equilibrium with o@xmath0 during deposition nor can one expect that it reaches such equilibrium after being removed from the deposition chamber .",
    "this true for the present focus on thin films and even more so for thicker overlayers .    according to the ait - se method , interface class b ( see bottom left of figure [ fig : structures ] ) is predicted to be stable only under extreme conditions , whereas interface class c ( see bottom right panel ) is predicted unstable over the whole range of allowed values of o chemical potentials @xcite .",

    "the members of the classes can have different film thicknesses but are sorted according to their chemical composition in terms of excess or deficiency atoms of a specific species .",

    "this follows from the observation that the values of @xmath1 for the b3 and b4 films ( which differ in thickness by one full layer or two stoichiometric units ) are approximately equal on the vertical line .",
    "we note , however , that there is an uncertainty in this value of @xmath99 for coinciding dynamic equilibria .",
    "the reason is the uncertainty in the calculation of chemical potentials ( in particular total energies of the molecules , see discussion in ref .  ) and the uncertainty in the total energies of the films themselves . for the latter to be accurate",
    "we would have to make sure that their atomic structures are fully optimised .",
    "the geometries identified in ref .   and used here are candidates for the optimised structures but not guaranteed to _ the _ optimised structures .",
    "figure [ fig : gr ] shows that , within the possible range of @xmath91 , all films have a negative value of @xmath1 . as a consequence all films are stable with respect to the substrate .",
    "this remains true also if we decrease the value of @xmath99 .",
    "the figure also demonstrates stoichiometric growth of alumina films .",
    "stoichiometric growth corresponds to @xmath100 .",
    "this condition is fulfilled as can be seen from the fact that the b4 film has lower free energy of reaction than the b3 film and that the former consists of two stoichiometric units of alumina more than the latter .",
    "we emphasise that the gibbs free energy variations shown in figure [ fig : gr ] directly reflect the closely related nature of process @xmath19 and @xmath20 . process @xmath19 and @xmath20 differ only in the solid reactants and solid products , the gaseous reactants and products are the same . in chemical reaction theory",
    "@xcite we can express the gibbs free energy of reaction as @xmath101 . here",

    "we have tested the quality of our predictor over a wide range of possible choices for unknown rate constants ; we refer to the appendix for a more detailed presentation .",
    "the vertical line corresponds to dynamic equilibrium in the water - producing step ( [ eq : water_production ] ) .",
    "we assume the same values as before for the temperature and the concentrations of the different species in the supply gas @xcite .",

    "at the same time , the ionicity of the o atoms is higher ( @xmath118 ) at interface b than at interface a ( @xmath119 ) . the ti - o bond strength is lower at the interface b than at the interface a. this",
    "is reflected by an increased ti - o layer separation at interface b ( @xmath120 ) with respect to that at interface a ( @xmath121 ) . however , the increased ionicity of the first o layer at interface b and the presence of al ions between the first and the second o layers above the interface plane give rise to a strong overall interface adhesion .",
    "this adhesion is absent at interface a. thus , the strong binding at the wear - resistant interface b that is most likely to be created in cvd of alumina arises from an interplay between a softening of the ti - o bonding , an increased ionicity in the first o layer and a strong ionic binding in the alumina . the latter is supplemented by weaker covalent bonds between o layers in the alumina coating .",

    "these predictors are strictly valid only under the assumption of dynamic equilibrium ( in the alumina deposition ) . in this appendix",
    "we give a prescription of how the quality of these predictors can be tested with respect to the exact steady - state probability for the prevalence of different film classes .",
    "we consider the exact steady - state ratio between the probability for a and b , see equation ( [ eq : fullpredictor ] ) .",
    "we introduce @xmath122 and @xmath123 . the functions @xmath124 and @xmath125",
    "depend on @xmath91 but are otherwise completely determined by our _ ab initio _ calculations ( and the thermochemical data to determine the chemical potentials ) . in particular , the parameter @xmath124 measures the departure from dynamic equilibrium ; @xmath126 corresponds to dynamic equilibrium , @xmath127 corresponds to growth beyond dynamic equilibrium and @xmath128 corresponds to evaporation .",
    "we furthermore introduce @xmath129 and @xmath130",
    ". these functions also depend on @xmath91 but require some additional parametrisation , see below .",
    "the quality of the approximate predictors ( [ eq : probabilities ] ) can be tested by evaluating ( [ eq : pa ] ) and ( [ eq : pc ] ) .",
    "the evaluation of ( [ eq : pa ] ) and ( [ eq : pc ] ) requires the specification of the functions @xmath133 and @xmath134 . here , we assume the following parametrisations , @xmath135^{\\nu_i^i}}{\\pi_j[x_j^{ii}]^{\\nu_j^{ii}}}\\\\ f_2&=\\frac{\\gamma_f^{iii}}{\\gamma_f^{i } } = \\frac{k_f^{iii}}{k_f^{i}}\\frac{\\pi_k [ x_k^{iii}]^{\\nu_k^{iii}}}{\\pi_i[x_i^{i}]^{\\nu_i^i } } , \\label{eq : f2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the @xmath136 can but do not need to be identical with the stoichiometric coefficients .",
    "we note that this parametrisation in only a crude approximation and that growth can , in general , be more complicated .    for alumina growth , the reactions @xmath19 and @xmath20 are formally identical .",
    "the only difference is that they take place on different substrates and generate different solid products .",
    "therefore , @xmath133 reduces to the ratio of the rate constants , which is constant .",
    "reaction @xmath19 and @xmath21 are different and @xmath134 therefore depends on @xmath137 .",
    "thus we have @xmath138^m[h_2]^{-n}}{[alcl_2]^r[h_2]^s[hcl]^{-t}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath139 , @xmath140 , @xmath141 , @xmath142 , @xmath2 are all positive and of the order of 1 .",
    "since the rate constants @xmath143 , @xmath144 , and @xmath145 are unknown , we have compared ( [ eq : p_a ] ) with ( [ eq : pa ] ) and ( [ eq : p_c ] ) with ( [ eq : pc ] ) for several choices of @xmath139 , @xmath140 , @xmath141 , @xmath142 , @xmath2 and a broad range of ratios of rate constants .",
    "we find that ( [ eq : pc ] ) is essentially described by ( [ eq : p_c ] ) . for ( [ eq : pa ] ) the approximation ( [ eq : p_a ] ) can deviate as @xmath91 decreases but the qualitative result ( @xmath146 ) is not affected .",
    "moreover , the ratio @xmath147 is always strongly suppressed .",
