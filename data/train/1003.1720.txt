    "since the discovery of classical novae , astronomers have pursued their use as standard candles to determine distances ( see @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite first noticed some regularity in nova light curves and termed this the `` life - luminosity '' relation .",
    "@xcite undertook a comprehensive search for novae in m31 , discovering thirty novae in 290 nights , and found a clear relation  luminous novae evolve faster than less luminous novae .",
    "the modern name for this observation is the maximum - magnitude rate - of - decline relation ( mmrd relation ) .",
    "the mmrd relation has attracted considerable theoretical attention ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the basic idea is that the relation is entirely due to the mass of the accreting white dwarf .",
    "the more massive the white dwarf , the higher the surface gravity , the higher the pressure at the base of envelope and stronger the thermonuclear runaway ( and hence , higher the peak luminosity ) .",
    "also , the more massive the white dwarf , the smaller the envelope mass to attain the critical pressure for thermonuclear runaway ( tnr ) and hence , faster the decline .    in more recent times , @xcite used a sample of novae in m31 and lmc to propose an arctangent relation between the peak luminosity and rate of decline . @xcite used a sample of galactic novae to propose a linear relation between the same two parameters .",
    "@xcite used a score of novae in m31 from point agape survey and claimed their observations were consistent with the @xcite formulation of the mmrd .    in comparison to supernovae ,",
    "classical novae are not very luminous .",
    "hence , searches have traditionally focussed only on the milky way and its nearest neighbors ( andromeda and the large magellanic cloud ) .",
    "@xcite looked into archival data and found 49 nova candidates in m81 in the past 20 years  unfortunately , these candidates neither have light curves nor spectra .",
    "@xcite undertook a search for novae using 24 orbits of the hubble space telescope and found nine nova candidates in m49 .",
    "even with their sparsely sampled light curves for nine novae , they concluded that novae are not good standard candles .",
    "another survey , cfht - covet ( aimed at finding transients in the gap between novae and supernovae ) found a dozen nova candidates in many galaxies in the virgo supercluster , including some in the far outskirts of galaxies ( kasliwal et al 2010 , in prep ) .    here , we report on novae discovered in high cadence monitoring observations of a representative collection of galaxies with distance less than that of the virgo cluster . the original motivation of this search  p60-fasting was to explore rapid transients ( those which last less than a couple of nights ) in the nearest galaxies .",
    "a strong spectroscopic follow - up effort was a part of p60-fasting .",
    "the survey was capable of finding novae in the major galaxies out to 4mpc : m31 , m81 , the star - burst m82 and ngc2403 .",
    "we present our sample of 21 transients , which although spectroscopically indistinguishable from classical novae , photometrically occupy a new region of phase space .",
    "the paper is organized as follows :  [ sec : obs ] describes the discovery , photometric and spectroscopic follow - up observations of this nova sample ,  [ sec : analysis ] describes the data analysis ,  [ sec : discussion ] discusses the implications and  [ sec : conclusion ] presents our conclusion .",

    "p60-fasting was designed with the specific goal of probing new phase space , particularly , fast transients with peak luminosity in the gap between novae and supernovae .",
    "the sample of galaxies included the brightest and nearest galaxies ( @xmath120mpc , majority around 10mpc ) .",

    "a real - time data reduction and transient search pipeline was written and implemented in april 2008 .",
    "p60-fasting ended in march 2009 .",
    "the search pipeline was written in ` python ` .",
    "a deep reference image was constructed by combining images from several of the best seeing dark nights .",
    "next , ` wcsremap ` was used to align every new image with the reference and ` hotpants ` was used to compute a convolution kernel prior to image subtraction ( both codes supplied by a. becker ) . although the image subtraction software was quite sophisticated in its convolution of the new image to match the reference prior to subtraction , we suffered from a large number of false positives . to distill the false subtraction residuals from the bonafide astrophysical sources , a variety of automatic filters",
    "were used ( e.g. the shape characteristics of the psf of the candidate , how well does it resemble the psf characteristics of other stars in the image ) .",
    "however , the final step in the vetting process was done by human eyes on candidate thumbnails every morning .",
    "due to the myriad trade - offs for maximum completeness and minimum contamination , the complex issue of quantifying the completeness of the nova sample is beyond the scope of this publication .",
    "our survey was sensitive to classical novae only in a handful of the nearest galaxies in our sample ( distance , d@xmath14mpc ) .",
    "classical novae discovered by p60-fasting are summarized in table  [ tab : allnovae ] .",
    "some novae in m31 were announced by different groups before p60-fasting s first detection ( usually due to bad weather at palomar )  these are summarized in table  [ tab : addm31novae ] .",
    "the robotic palomar 60-inch has a standard data reduction pipeline ( cenko et al .",
    "this pipeline performs basic detrending ( flat - fielding and bias subtraction ) and computes an astrometric solution . in august 2008 , we added a new functionality : computation of a photometric solution .",
    "we used the sdss catalog where available , otherwise the nomad catalog . note that where nomad was used ( e.g. m31 ) , the transformation from johnson @xmath6 magnitudes to sdss @xmath7 magnitudes was done following @xcite .    to compute a light curve",
    ", we first measured the magnitude of the nova on the subtracted image .",
    "the subtracted image was scaled to the same flux level as the new image .",
    "thus , we measured the magnitude of @xmath8150 reference stars on the new image to compute a relative zeropoint with appropriate outlier rejection .",

    "since we were looking for fast evolving phenomenon , we triggered our target of opportunity program on the keck i and palomar hale telescopes soon after discovery .",
    "sometimes due to bad weather or bright moon - phase , neither of these was an option .",
    "we resorted to the queue - scheduled service - observed programs on gemini or het telescopes .",
    "a log of spectroscopic observations can be found in table  [ tab : spec ] .",
    "we emphasize that spectroscopy is crucial in distinguishing between an optical transient which happened to be co - incident with a nearby galaxy and a classical nova .",
    "for instance , we took spectra of several optical transient candidates which did not turn out to be novae : a foreground m - dwarf flare in the milky way spatially coincident with ngc7640 ; a background supernova ; a luminous blue variable in ngc925 .",
    "data were reduced in ` iraf ` using standard tasks in the noao package ` onedspec ` and the spectra are shown in figure  [ fig : spec ] .",
    "the primary photometric analysis was to measure the peak absolute magnitude and rate of decline .",
    "the peak magnitude had to be corrected for extinction using spectra or colors .",
    "the primary spectroscopic analysis was to classify the spectra .",
    "a multitude of methods have been used in the literature to measure extinction to novae .",
    "@xcite compared a synthetic dust - free stellar @xmath9 map of m31 to an observed @xmath9 color map of m31 and used the difference between the maps to generate a dust map of m31 .",
    "the location of the nova on this map determined how much extinction needed to be applied .",
    "this assumed that the novae were behind the galaxy and suffered extinction due to the entire column of dust .",
    "the average extinction as determined by this method is a@xmath10=0.8 .",
    "the galactic extinction along the line of sight of m31 of a@xmath10=0.13 .",
    "@xcite compared the observed color of the new nova to that of a well - studied nova to derive the extinction .",
    "@xcite used the balmer decrement ( @xmath11 ) and attributed the excess in the ratio over the theoretical case b value to dust .",
    "our preferred method of computing extinction is by using the spectroscopic balmer decrement where nebular spectra are available .",
    "we subtract the continuum , measure the flux ratio of the two lines , and then use : @xmath12 @xmath13 the uncertainty comes from the range in expected ratios for case b of 2.763.30 .",
    "our second choice is to use the @xmath14 color of the nova at maximum , compare against the typical @xmath14 color and attribute the reddening to dust .",
    "@xcite compiled photometry of several galactic novae and derived an average color at maximum of @xmath15=0.23 @xmath16 0.06mag .",
    "following @xcite , we can use the colors of an a5v star ( t=8200k ) to translate @xmath15 to @xmath17 . using colors of an a5v star from @xcite ,",
    "we get : @xmath18mag .",
    "now , @xmath19 .",
    "hence , @xmath20 =   2.223 \\times [ ( g - i)_{obs } + 0.27]\\ ] ]    for the case of m31n2007 - 11d @xcite , where data for both the above options are available , we get consistent answers : @xmath14=0.7mag at maximum suggests a@xmath21=0.75mag and a balmer decrement of 4.6 suggests a@xmath21=0.65mag .",
    "if neither a color at maximum nor a spectrum at late - time is available , we use the average line - of - sight extinction to the host galaxy using the schlegel maps .",
    "the uncertainty in extinction calculation significantly contributes to the uncertainty in the peak magnitude .",
    "we note here that for the case of p60-m82ot-081119 , the light curve was unusually red for a nova and the extinction correction may be overestimated .",
    "the heterogenity in nova light curves suggests that a single parameter may not characterize the decline well .",
    "traditionally , the time to decay from peak by one magnidue ( t1 ) , two magnitudes ( t2 ) or three magnitudes ( t3 ) is used . for several",
    "novae ( e.g. m31n2007 - 10a , m31n2008 - 08c , m31n2008 - 11a ) , the decline is more or less linear and t1 can be approximated as half of t2 .",
    "for some novae ( e.g. m31n2008 - 10b ) , the light curve behavior is more complex and this simplification is not applicable . in table  [ tab : mmrd ] , we see that t2 values ( where available ) are sometimes larger and sometimes smaller than twice the t1 value .",
    "we note here that we did not have data to measure the decline of the nova in ngc891 and hence it is excluded from further mmrd analysis .      given the cadence of p60-fasting , we were able to catch several novae on the rise .",
    "we define the rate of rise as the average slope between first detection and peak detection and summarize in table  [ tab : mmrd ] .",
    "we find a wide range of rise - times , from @xmath221.8magday@xmath23 ( e.g. m31n2008 - 11a ) to 0.2magday@xmath23 ( e.g. m31n2008 - 09a ) .",
    "it is not clear how previous determinations of the mmrd in the literature dealt with the uncertainty in the peak magnitude due to inadequate coverage .",
    "especially since previous surveys likely had a relatively slower cadence , missing the peak may be a substantial source of error .",
    "slower cadence and/or shallower depth would correspond to a weaker constraint on the rise time of the nova .",
    "due to gaps on account of weather , some of the p60 light curves have constraint weaker than 0.1mag  day@xmath23 on the rate of rise .",
    "hence , we do not use the lightcurves of p60-m81ot-080926 or p60-m82ot-080429 for subsequent analysis of the mmrd relation .",

    "the taxonomy of novae were laid out by @xcite and @xcite .",

    "if the wind mass - loss rate is high , it results in a wind - dominated fe ii spectrum .",
    "thus , classical novae are divided into two principal families  the `` fe '' class ( dominated by fe  ii lines , often low velocity and showing p - cygni profiles ) and `` he / n '' class ( dominated by he and n lines , often high velocity and flat or jagged - topped profiles ) .",
    "these evolve into nebular spectra with four classes based on the prominent forbidden lines  standard ( e.g. [ n ii ] , [ o ii ] , [ o iii ] ) , neon ( e.g. [ ne v ] , [ ne iii ] ) , coronal ( e.g. [ fe x ] ) or no forbidden lines . the fe class novae are expected to evolve into standard or neon nebular spectra .",
    "the he / n class are expected to evolve into neon , coronal or no forbidden line spectra .",
    "some novae are classified as `` hybrid '' as they start out with high velocity fe ii features and quickly evolve into showing he / n features ( e.g. v745 sco , v3890 sgr , m31n2008 - 11a ) .",
    "majority of the p60-fasting spectra show clear permitted lines from fe ii ( 42 ) , fe ii ( 37,38 ) and o i. the line velocities are low and typical gaussian fwhm are @xmath12500 km s@xmath23 with the exception of p60-m81 - 080925 where h@xmath27 velocity is 3000 km s@xmath23 .",
    "p60-ngc2403 - 090314 shows weak fe ii(42 ) and weak p - cygni profiles in balmer lines and can tentatively also be classified as fe ii class .",
    "p60-m81 - 071213 and p60-m82 - 080429 have very low snr and no feature other than the balmer lines are detected , hence , we can not classify them .",
    "multiple spectra of p60-m81 - 081203 were taken  initially , the spectra show a featureless continuum ( obtained a few days prior to maximum light ) and later ( about a week after maximum light ) , evolved to show balmer lines , fe ii ( 42 ) , o i. we summarize spectral classifications in table  [ tab : spec ] . for four novae in m31 ,",
    "other groups obtained spectra and we summarize their classification in table  [ tab : addm31novae ] .",
    "in comparison to traditional nova searches , p60-fasting was designed as a faster cadence and deeper survey .",
    "weather - permitting , galaxies in the sample were imaged every night to a mean depth of gunn-@xmath28mag . hence ,",
    "p60-fasting was sensitive to transients that are less luminous and evolve faster than classical novae .    given that our light curves are well - sampled , and we have spectra or color measurements to correct for extinction , we can securely measure both the maximum magnitude and the rate of decline . to our surprise , as demonstrated in figure  [ fig : taumv ] , we find that the p60-fasting nova sample is evidently inconsistent with the mmrd relation @xcite .    in figure  [",
    "fig : taumv ] , the decay time is measured as the time to decay by one magnitude . to test whether the apparent photometric diversity is consistent with the mmrd over a longer timescale ,",

    "we could hypothesize that some of the p60-fasting novae are not classical but recurrent ( classical novae which recur on a timescales shorter than a century ) since recurrent novae are also known not to obey the mmrd relation .",
    "recurrent novae are expected to occur in the most massive white dwarfs with high accretion rates .",
    "a small amount of mass accreted on a short timescale is sufficient to trigger thermonuclear runaway .",
    "recently , @xcite compiled all available photometry over the past century on the ten recurrent novae in our galaxy  overplotted to compare with the p60-fasting sample in figure  [ fig : taumvrn ]",
    ".    there are three ways to test the recurrent nova hypothesis .",
    "first , spectra of recurrent novae have high velocities and belong to either he / n or hybrid class ( e.g. v3890 sgr , v745 sco , v394 cra in @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "we find that majority off the p60-fasting novae do not share the spectroscopic properties of recurrent novae .",
    "p60-fasting novae mostly belong to the fe ii class and have low velocities .",
    "second , recurrent novae are often a few magnitudes brighter than classical novae at quiescence .",
    "@xcite suggest that recurrent novae range from @xmath264.1 @xmath1 m@xmath29 3.2 and classical novae range from 1.1 @xmath1 m@xmath30 7.0 at quiescence .",
    "given the distance modulus to these galaxies , this test is within reach of 10-m class telescopes and easy with hst ( e.g. see @xcite ) .",
    "third , the unambiguous test of whether an eruption is recurrent is to continue to monitor these galaxies for the next few decades until another eruption is witnessed .    in order to decipher the nature of this new sub - class of novae we turn to the fundamental physics of classical novae .",
    "the physics is governed by four parameters - mass of the white dwarf , temperature , accretion rate and composition .",
    "the mmrd relation is explained with the mass of the white dwarf being the single , dominant parameter .",
    "perhaps , the p60-fasting sample of faint and fast novae can be explained based on an unexplored region of this four - parameter phase space ? could some p60-fasting novae come from hot and massive white dwarfs",
    "? if it is hot , then the thermonuclear runaway would not be as explosive and thus , the peak luminosity would be fainter .",
    "also , the higher temperature would result in a smaller amount of envelope mass being sufficient to trigger thermonuclear runaway and thus , the timescale would be faster .",
    "recent theoretical efforts have explored nova diversity ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite present an extended grid of nova models to explore a wider parameter space ( in mass , temperature and accretion rate ) than traditionally explored for classical novae subject to physical constraints ( such as conditions for thermonuclear runaway ) .",
    "we summarize the results of the variety of models they run in figure  [ fig : taumv_theory ] .",
    "some hot and massive white dwarfs with high accretion rates can result in a faint and fast nova population consistent with the p60-fasting sample .",
    "indeed , @xcite predict the existence of remarkably small amplitude novae across the entire span of decay rates .",
    "finally , we note that more than half of the p60-fasting nova sample is inconsistent with the mmrd .",
    "this suggests that faint and fast novae are commonplace and can not be explained by a rare type of white dwarf .",
    "we conclude that p60-fasting has uncovered classical novae in a new region in the luminosity - timescale phase space of optical transients .",
    "classical novae span at least two orders of magnitude in time and two orders of magnitude in luminosity .",
    "future surveys would have a large enough sample to meaningfully constrain the relative populations of classical novae in the different areas of phase space .",
    "p60-fasting was designed as a pilot project , to begin to set the stage for future projects such as palomar transient factory ( ptf , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , panstarrs ( ps1 ) and large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) .",
    "both ptf and ps1 are now underway .",
    "ptf is looking at several nearby galaxies with a similar depth and cadence as p60-fasting . among nearby galaxies ,",
    "ps1 day - cadence fields only cover m31 but are a couple of magnitudes deeper .",
    "lsst will be both deeper and faster cadence and cover the visible sky .",
    "p60-fasting is only the trailblazer for the uncovering of a wealth of information about classical novae by near - future synoptic surveys .",
    "we thank marina orio for discussion , in particular , the suggestion that some of the faint novae may be recurrent novae .",
    "we thank a. shafter , m. shara , l. bildsten and o. yaron for valuable feedback .",
