    "<S> we present a theoretical analysis of the capacitance of a double quantum dot in the charge and spin qubit configurations probed at high - frequencies . we find that , in general , the total capacitance of the system consists of two state - dependent terms : the quantum capacitance arising from adiabatic charge motion and the tunnelling capacitance that appears when repopulation occurs at a rate comparable or faster than the probing frequency . the analysis of the capacitance lineshape as a function of externally controllable variables offers a way to characterize the qubits charge and spin state as well as relevant system parameters such as charge and spin relaxation times , tunnel coupling , electron temperature and electron g - factor . </S>",
    "<S> overall , our analysis provides a formalism to understand dispersive qubit - resonator interactions which can be applied to high - sensitivity and non - invasive quantum - state readout . </S>"
