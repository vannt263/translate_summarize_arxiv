    "we then fit , in subsection  [ subsec_spatial_fit ] , the gamma - ray spatial distribution in each of the 22 energy bins as a sum of the `` background '' distribution and a distribution tentatively associated with the   gas ( -template ) .",
    "the `` background '' is subtracted from the measured gamma - ray intensity distribution and the remainder is defined as the gamma - ray intensity distribution associated with the  gas with which  is correlated pixel - by - pixel .",

    "( [ eq_emission ] ) ) are assembled as the gamma - ray spectrum for each of the 3 -templates .",
    "the spectrum is then fitted as a sum of the gamma rays produced in the pionic and bremsstrahlung processes .    in the third step",
    ", the gamma - ray intensity distribution associated with the pionic emission is converted to the mass column density . the -mass conversion factor ( )",
    "is calculated via two methods , one by comparing the gamma - ray counts associated with the  gas and with the  gas ( the /  method ) and the other by dividing the gamma - ray counts of the pionic emission by the number of pionic gamma rays expected per unit gas mass ( the pionic method ) . in the first method",
    ", we assume the cr spectrum is uniform in the local  region within galactocentric radius of @xmath34  kpc ( see subsection  [ hi_template ] ) and in the orion clouds . in the latter method",
    ", we assume the cr spectrum including its absolute flux is known in the orion clouds .",
    "we validate these assumption using galprop .",
    "we use galprop @xcite with the parameter set labeled as galdef 54_77xvarh7s .",
    "this parameter set is known to reproduce reasonably well the galactic diffuse gamma - ray emission observed with the lat @xcite .",
    "we refer to the results obtained by running galprop with this parameter set as the galprop results in this paper .",
    "initially we assume the gamma - ray emission from the roi to be made of 4 `` background '' components and one `` signal ''  component , each emitting gamma rays with a characteristic spatial distribution .",
    "the 4 `` background '' components are spatially associated with the diffuse  gas , the inverse compton ( ic ) scattering by electrons and @xmath35 . ] off interstellar radiation fields , the point sources , and the sum of extragalactic diffuse emission ( including unresolved sources ) and backgrounds induced by crs in the instrument .",
    "we assume the last sum to be isotropic and refer to it as the isotropic component .",
    "we ignore the contribution from ionized hydrogen gas ( ) because its density is low when averaged in @xmath36  deg@xmath21 pixels ( @xmath37 ) and its total mass is negligible in the roi @xcite .",
    "all spatial components except for the ic component are assumed to have , individually , an energy - independent underlying spatial distribution in galactic coordinates @xmath38 .",
    "another important underlying assumption is that the nuclear cr spectrum is uniform over the roi .",
    "we make spatial templates for the 22 energy bins by convolving the spatial distributions with the energy - dependent point spread function ( psf ) and exposure for the individual energy bins . hence the spatial templates are energy dependent . in subsection  [ subsec_spec_ana ]",
    "we will show that the spectra of the gamma - ray emissions associated with the  and  gas consist of the pionic and bremsstrahlung components .",
    "the gamma - ray intensity @xmath39 for the @xmath40-th energy bin is interpreted as the sum of the five contributions , each being the product of the normalization factor for the @xmath40-th energy bin and the spatial template .",
    "@xmath41    the normalization factors are : @xmath42 for the  gas ; @xmath33 for the component associated with clouds consisting predominantly of ; @xmath43 for the inverse compton component ; @xmath44 for the @xmath45-th point source at @xmath46 ; and @xmath47 for the isotropic component which is assumed not to depend on @xmath38 .",
    "the normalization factors are determined independently for the 22 energy bins .",
    "we note that @xmath43 are fixed at the values given by galprop , because the spatial distribution is highly correlated with the isotropic component , and the ic component is sub - dominant in the roi .",
    "later in subsection  [ subsec_spatial_fit ] , we will explore 3 templates for , two based on  and one on  plus the `` dark gas '' proposed by @xcite .      atomic hydrogen gas ( ) is broadly distributed in the galaxy with a total mass exceeding that of molecular hydrogen ( ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the contributions from annuli other than the local one ( @xmath50  kpc ) are through the periphery of the lat psf and less than @xmath51% in gamma - ray counts .",

    "an exploratory study of cold  mixed in selected  cloud cores has found the mean  fraction to be less than 0.5% @xcite .",
