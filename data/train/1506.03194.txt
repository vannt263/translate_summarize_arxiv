    "<S> the total angular momentum @xmath36 @xmath61 contributed from orbital and spin angular momenta and the phase winding of sc gap ( presumed as anti - clockwise ) is conserved . </S>",

    "<S> therefore , the checkerboard pattern of spin - resolved ldos for quasiparticle excitation displayed in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : cb ] provides a phase sensitive evidence for mbs in vortex core of topological sc . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth noticing that , if the energy resolution of stm / sts measurement is high enough , checkerboard patterns can be detected even in individual spin - resolved ldos ( without taking the ratio between signals in two spin channels , see appendix ) . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally , spin - resolved ldos can be obtained by using a spin - polarized stm tip  @xcite . </S>",
