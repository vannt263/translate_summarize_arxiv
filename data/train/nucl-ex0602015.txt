    "rather the mesons rapidity distributions are gaussian and pions seem to exhibit landau flow over a wide energy range .",
    "landau s model assumes that all the entropy in the collisions is created the instant the two lorzent contracted nuclei overlap and that the system then expands adiabatically @xcite .",
    "we have extended this survey to study the system size and reaction plane dependence of particle yields .",
    "this allows us to map out the rapidity dependence of radial and elliptic flow .",
    "if one observes a relativistic collision from the rest frame of one of the nuclei , certain quantities become independent of the beam energy .",
    "this phenomena is known as limiting fragmentation and implies that a certain quantity is invariant when plotted against y - y@xmath1 .",

    "the results are plotted versus the number of participants and rapidity .",
    "we find that @xmath3 decreases with centrality while @xmath5 increases .",
    "this may be because larger systems have more time to convert random thermal motion into directional flow .",
    "the variations of @xmath3 and @xmath5 with rapidity suggests that the pressure gradients are weaker at forward rapidity , possibly because of the smaller particle densities .",
    "one of the most exciting results obtained at rhic is the observation of significant elliptic flow in central auau collisions .",
    "the large flow signal , which is consistent with the hydrodynamic evolution of a perfect fluid , indicates a strongly interacting qgp , contrary to initial expectations @xcite .",

    "it is striking how similar these data are given that the integrated @xmath10 falls steadily with @xmath12 .",
