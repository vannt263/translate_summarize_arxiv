    "twist knots have long been an important class of knots to consider , particularly in contact geometry . if legendrian knots in a given topological knot type are determined up to legendrian isotopy by their classical invariants ,",
    "namely their thurston  bennequin and rotation numbers , then the knot type is said to be legendrian simple ; otherwise it is legendrian nonsimple .",
    "while there is no reason to believe all knot types should be legendrian simple , it has historically been difficult to prove otherwise .",
    "chekanov @xcite and , independently , eliashberg @xcite developed invariants of legendrian knots that show that @xmath9 has legendrian representatives that are not determined by their classical invariants , providing the first example of a legendrian nonsimple knot . shortly thereafter , epstein , fuchs , and meyer @xcite generalized the result of chekanov and eliashberg to show that @xmath10 is legendrian nonsimple for all @xmath11 , and in fact that these knot types contain an arbitrarily large number of legendrian knots with the same classical invariants .",
    "again these were the first such examples .",
    "one can also ask if a knot is transversely simple , that is , are transverse knots in that knot type determined by their self - linking number ?",
    "it is more difficult to prove transverse nonsimplicity than legendrian nonsimplicity . in particular , there are knot types that are legendrian nonsimple but transversely simple @xcite , whereas any transversely nonsimple knot must be legendrian nonsimple as well .",
    "the first examples of transversely nonsimple knots were produced in 20056 by birman and menasco @xcite , and etnyre and honda @xcite .",
    "it has long been suspected that some twist knots are transversely nonsimple , and this was proven very recently by ozsvth and stipsicz @xcite using the transverse invariant in heegaard floer homology from @xcite .",
    "although twist knots have long supplied a useful test case for new legendrian invariants , such as contact homology and legendrian heegaard floer invariants ( cf .  the work of epstein  fuchs  meyer and ozsvth  stipsicz above ) , a complete classification of legendrian and transverse twist knots has been elusive . in this paper , we establish this classification and in particular identify which twist knots are legendrian and transversely nonsimple . as a byproduct",

    ". we can similarly assume @xmath467 negatively intersects the dividing curves on @xmath468 , where the orientation on the dividing curves and @xmath467 are consistent with the orientations chosen for the dividing curves on @xmath466 and @xmath465 .",
    "we have shown that we can arrange that @xmath456 intersects the dividing curves on @xmath469 efficiently and @xmath470 hence any bypass along @xmath471 for @xmath405 can be thought to be a bypass attached along @xmath472    we assume for the remainder of this proof that @xmath93 does not destabilize .",
    "it follows from the above discussion that @xmath473 or @xmath317 . arguing as we did for the standard model above",

    "moreover , as above , we see that neither of the two boundary parallel dividing curves on @xmath461 can straddle @xmath449 thus the configuration of the dividing curves @xmath475 is determined , and the contact structure on @xmath476 is determined by the characteristic foliation on @xmath477    we can thus find a diffeomorphism @xmath478 that preserves the dividing set on the boundary and takes @xmath479 to @xmath480 and @xmath258 to @xmath481 since @xmath482 can be isotoped to be a contactomorphism in a neighborhood of @xmath483 and the dividing curves on @xmath258 and @xmath461 are determined above , we can isotop @xmath482 to be a contactomorphism from @xmath242 to @xmath221 taking @xmath484 to @xmath485      the disc @xmath486 is convex in @xmath487 with dividing curve @xmath488\\times\\{y_0\\}$ ] .",

    "then the fronts of legendrian braids in @xmath491 $ ] with endpoints @xmath492 are described as follows :      note that @xmath493 and @xmath494 are just stabilizations . using theorem [ thm : braids ]",
    "we can understand legendrian braids with two strands ; we will write @xmath495 , @xmath496 , @xmath497 . notice that if @xmath104 or @xmath75 is followed by @xmath498 or vice versa then it destabilizes , see figure [ fig : sx ] .",
    "this observation immediately yields the following result .      1 .",
    "if @xmath499 then a legendrian representation of @xmath242 either destabilizes or consists of @xmath1 blocks of type @xmath498 ; 2 .   if @xmath500 then a legendrian representation of @xmath242 either destabilizes or is built up from @xmath1 building blocks of type @xmath75 and @xmath104 in any order",
    "let @xmath93 be a legendrian knot in the knot types @xmath502 either @xmath93 destabilizes or the contactomorphism from @xmath221 to a ball in @xmath219 given in theorem  [ thm : bout ] can be extended to @xmath220 , giving a contactomorphism from @xmath219 to itself that maps @xmath503 to a legendrian braid on two strands with @xmath504 twists .",
    "the contactomorphism clearly extends as a diffeomorphism and since there is a unique contact structure up to isotopy on the 3-ball , we can isotop this diffeomorphism ( relative to @xmath221 ) to a contactomorphism on @xmath505 the image of @xmath503 is clearly a legendrian 2-braid with @xmath504 twists .      if @xmath506 , let @xmath93 be a legendrian realization of @xmath107 from the previous theorem either @xmath93 destabilizes or there is a contactomorphism of @xmath219 taking @xmath93 to one of the legendrian knots shown on the left of figure  [ fig : legtwistn ] ; note that the box shown there is a legendrian 2-braid .",
    "if there is not an obvious destabilization of the 2-braid , then by proposition  [ prop : leg2braid ] , it is obtained by stacking @xmath103 @xmath75 s and @xmath104 s together if @xmath26 , or @xmath504 @xmath498",
    "s if @xmath507 clearly this agrees with figure  [ fig : legtwistn ] for @xmath508 but also notice that for @xmath105 this gives a knot isotopic to the one in figure  [ fig : mpos ] . since legendrian isotopy in the standard contact structure on @xmath219 is the same as ambient contactomorphism ( i.e. , a contactomorphism sending one legendrian knot to the other ) @xcite , this completes the proof once we know that the knots shown in figures  [ fig : legtwistn ] and  [ fig : mpos ] do not destabilize .",
