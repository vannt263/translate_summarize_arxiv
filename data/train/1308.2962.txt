    "the discovery of the accelerated expansion of the late - time universe gives rise to a wide spectrum of various theories in order to explain this acceleration . in the general gravity ( gr ) scheme , the dark energy , known to have an exotic property such as negative pressure , is considered to be a first candidate to this acceleration of the universe @xcite . still in this spirit , and as alternatives to the gr , several theories based on the modification of the the curvature scalar have been developed with interesting results .",
    "the most important ones are the @xmath9 @xcite-@xcite , @xmath10 @xcite-@xcite , @xmath11 @xcite-@xcite , @xmath12 @xcite-@xcite , where @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the curvature scalar , the gauss - bonnet invariant and the trace of the energy - momentum tensor , respectively .",
    "nevertheless , there exists another alternative to the dark energy , being the modification of the teleparallel theory equivalent to the gr ( tegr ) , namely @xmath0 theory of gravity , where @xmath1 denotes the torsion scalar . instead of the levi - civita s connection ,",
    "as used in the gr and its different modified versions , the connection under consideration in @xmath0 is that of weitzenbok .",
    "this theory has been introduced first by ferraro @xcite where they explained the @xmath16 modifications to gr and also the inflation .",
    "afterwards , ferraro and bengochea considered the same models in the context of late cosmology to describe dark energy @xcite .",
    "other authors developed various cosmological and gravitational ideas , still in @xmath0 theory of gravity . in @xcite , tamanini and boehmer",
    "investigate the importance of choosing good tetrads for the study of the field equations of @xmath0 gravity .",
    "it is important to recall that the use of specific tetrads is extremely crucial of having a reasonable feature in this theory .",
    "note that when the set of tetrads is not suitably chosen , the theory falls into the usual teleparallel one and there will be no reason of why having modified the teleparallel theory .",
    "this important scheme of choosing a suitable set of tetrads is also undertaken in this manuscript and presented in the section @xmath17 , where it will be observed that the algebraic function @xmath0 may be different from the linear form one , the teleparallel action term .",
    "universe is assumed to be homogeneous and isotropic at large scales . however , this is not the case if local consideration are made .",
    "in such a situation , the anisotropic effects that appears should not be described with the use of the common friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric .",
    "the simplest of anisotropic models usually used for describing the anisotropic effects are bianchi type i ( bi ) spatially homogeneous models whose spatial sections are flat .",
    "the advantages in using anisotropic models are that they have significant role in the description of the early stage of the universe @xcite and also are extremely useful in obtaining more general cosmological models that the isotropic frw models .",
    "anisotropy is completely supported in various angle scales by the differential microwave radiometers on nasa s cosmic background explorer .",
    "speculations indicate that the entire history of the cosmic evolution down to the recombination is hidden in anisotropies and they are conceived to be indicative the matter composing and the geometry of the universe .",
    "important theoretical argument by misner in 1968 and the modern experimental data defend the existence of anisotropic phase of the universe , which , later , turns into an isotropic one",
    ".    therefore , its quite reasonable to check the isotropization of any anisotropic model able to describe a stage of the evolution history of the universe . at a simple level",
    ", the isotropy of the present stage of the universe allows the bi model to be a prime candidate in the study of the possible effects of an anisotropy in the early universe on the current observational data .",
    "recently , fadragas et al @xcite performed a detailed dynamical analysis of anisotropic scalar - field cosmologies , and in particular of the most significant kantowski - sachs , bianchi i and bianchi iii case , and as conclusion , they found a very rich behaviour , and amongst others the universe can result in isotropized solutions with observables in agreement with observations , such as de sitter , quintessence - like or stiff - dark energy solutions .",
    "fontanini et al considered the cosmic parallax effect in anisotropic cosmological models described by an axisymmetric homogeneous bianchi i metric and discuss whether any observation of cosmic parallax would distinguish between different anisotropic evolutions @xcite .",
    "still in the framework of anisotropic models , campanelli et al @xcite analysed the magnitude - redshift data of type ia supernovae included in the union and union2 compilations anisotropic bianchi i cosmological model and in the presence of dark energy fluid anisotropic equation of state and found that the amount of deviation from isotropy of the equation of state of dark energy , the skewness , which should be restricted to the interval @xmath18 . also , in order to well understand the notion of  real - time cosmology \" , quercellini et",
    "al undertook the real - time measurements of the overall redshift drift and angular separation shift in distant source , which allows the observer to trace the background cosmic expansion and large scale anisotropy , respectively @xcite .    following these evident features of the universe , we focus our attention in this work to the locally rotationally symmetric ( lrs ) bi model which is a special case of bi one . within this metric and",
    "the general field equations give rise to three independent equations . in the sequence",
    ", we present the generalisation of the anisotropic model within torsion consideration . as we mentioned above",
    ", the isotropization is an important aspect following the evolution history of the universe .",
    "this feature is extensively analysed in the framework of lrs - bi model in this work .",
    "the final and important point undertaken in this work is the reconstruction of @xmath0 model according to the lrs - bi metric .",
    "across all the above studies , two interesting cases are considered .",
    "a linear form of the algebraic function and a more complicated case .",
    "our results show that for the linear case , the real evolution of our universe holds whereas , for the more complicated one , the universe presents more anisotropy at the beginning only when the terms of higher order in @xmath1 fade away .",

    "then , we calculated the deviation - free part of the anisotropic eos and the result reflects an accelerated expansion of the universe with @xmath110 , and a mean hubble parameter and volume involving with time .",
    "our analysis shows that at the beginning the universe presents unequal scalar factor in the directions @xmath113 and @xmath64 ( anisotropy ) , and as the late - time is reached , they become equal ( isotropy ) , reflecting the isotropization process .",
    "another interesting feature undertaken in this work is the reconstruction scheme of the algebraic function @xmath0 .",
    "we assumed the previous anisotropy expression of the scale factor and search for the action for which this anisotropy is realized .",
    "the result shows that the algebraic function is an exponential one .",
    "a whole comparison of these results with the linear case ones , as an important and interesting conclusion , is that the universe is more anisotropic at the beginning if the terms of higher order in torsion scalar are not considered .",

    "<S> we study the locally rotational symmetry bianchi type - i dark energy model in the framework of @xmath0 theory of gravity , where @xmath1 denotes the torsion scalar . a viable cosmological model is undertaken and the isotropization of this latter is checked , yielding a result that reflects the real evolution of our universe . </S>",
