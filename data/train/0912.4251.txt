    "the shapes of the distributions are somewhat dependent on ugdfs .",
    "it is interesting to note here that the ks and kmr ugdfs lead to very similar angular dependence of @xmath199 for all @xmath45 states . in the case",
    "when energy resolution is not enough to separate contributions from different states of @xmath45 ( @xmath8 , @xmath10 , @xmath3 ) , which seems to be the case for tevatron , the distribution in relative azimuthal angle may , at least in principle , be helpful .",
    "the fact that the angular distributions are not simple functions ( like @xmath200 , @xmath201 ) of the relative azimuthal angle between outgoing nucleons is due to the loop integral in eq .",
    "( [ ampl ] ) which destroys the dependence one would obtain with single fusion of well defined ( spin , parity ) objects ( mesons or reggeons ) @xcite .",
    "our results can be summarized as follows :    we have derived the qcd amplitude for central exclusive production of tensor @xmath3 meson .",
    "this amplitude vanishes in the forward limit of outgoing protons , as demanded by the @xmath20 selection rule .",
    "our numerical results show the importance of non - forward corrections , including all polarisation states of @xmath3 and nonperturbative contributions to the @xmath3 cep .",
    "inclusion of all the ingredients leads to a noticeable contribution of the @xmath3 meson in the observable radiative decay channel depending on ugdf .",
    "we have observed the importance of the @xmath9 state @xmath10 cep and @xmath202 states for @xmath3 cep at @xmath5 0 , whereas the total cep cross section is dominated by maximal helicity contributions .    the main contribution to diffractive charmonium production comes from small gluon transverse momenta @xmath203 leading to quite substantial sensitivity of the corresponding cross section on the infrared cut - off in perturbatively modeled kmr ugdf .",
    "alternatively one could use ugdfs like kutak - stato and gbw models , which by construction can be used for any values of the gluon transverse momenta .",
    "we have tested the symmetrical prescription for off - diagonal ugdfs , following from positivity constraints and incorporating @xmath52 , @xmath182 dependence of both participating gluons , against the present cdf experimental data . a rather good quantitative agreement with the cdf data on charmonium cep in the radiative decay channel",
    "is achieved with the nonlinear kutak - stato ugdf model giving the cross section @xmath204 nb without imposing extra normalisation conditions beyond the qcd framework .",
    "such a description is achieved by incorporating very soft screening gluons with @xmath205 .",
    "we have also calculated total cross sections of @xmath45 cep at different energies ( rhic , tevatron and lhc ) , as well as differential distributions in three phase space variables @xmath206 .",
    "overall theoretical uncertainty of the qcd mechanism under consideration is rather high but hard to estimate due to large unknown nonperturbative contributions coming into the game and not well known higher - order qcd corrections to the hard subprocess @xmath207 ( especially , in the axial - vector case ) .",
    "also , absorptive corrections may depend on ugdf used in the calculation , and there is no reliable estimation of such a sensitivity in literature . in the present paper we kept the strategy to study different distinct options and analyze the sensitivity of the final results with respect to the ugdfs choice , prescriptions for skewed ugdfs , nonperturbative cut - off parameter and characteristic @xmath47 variations , etc .",
    "then a comparison with experimental data would allow to select the most reliable option .",
    "however , we observe a variety of such `` good '' options , namely , description of the data ( with , however , pretty large theoretical uncertainties related , in particular , with unknown nlo corrections ) can be , in principle , achieved for a few ugdfs ( gbw , ks and kmr ugdfs , see table  [ table : dy0 ] ) .",
    "each of them pick up some essential qcd dynamics .",
    "further constraints can , in principle , be settled by experimental measurements of separate @xmath192 contributions , the energy dependence of the cross section and the shapes of differential distributions .",
