    "radiative corrections contain not only most essential information about quantum properties of a quantum field theory but moreover , their knowledge is indispensable for the interpretation of precision experiments .",
    "higher order calculations in general have been performed for processes with at most four external legs . with increasing energy the observation of multi particle events is becoming more and more important and at least one - loop diagrams must be calculated for these cases as well .",
    "one of the important examples is the @xmath5pair production reaction @xmath6 , being experimentally investigated at lep2 , which allows us to accurately determine mass , width and couplings of the @xmath5-boson . at future high  energy and high ",
    "luminosity @xmath7 linear colliders radiative corrections will become even more important for a detailed understanding of standard model processes . thus their computation will be crucial for a precise investigation of particle properties and the expected discovery of new physics . at present , a full @xmath8 calculation for a four  fermion production process is not available , mainly because , such a calculation is complicated for various reasons  @xcite .",
    "one of the problems is addressed in the present article and concerns the calculation of one - loop diagrams with special emphasis on processes with five and six external legs .",
    "the evaluation of one - loop feynman graph amplitudes has a long history @xcite - @xcite and at the present time many different methods and approaches do exist .",
    "however , the most frequently used passarino - veltman @xcite approach is rather difficult to use in calculating diagrams with five , six or more external legs .",
    "the tensor structure of such diagrams is rather complicated . to obtain the coefficients in the tensor decomposition of multi - leg integrals one needs to solve algebraic equations of high order which often are not tractable even with the help of modern computer algebra systems .",
    "additional complications occur in the case when some kinematic gram determinants are zero .    in the present paper",
    "we propose an approach which simplifies the evaluation of one - loop diagrams in an essential way .",
    "it allows one to evaluate multi - leg integrals efficiently without solving systems of algebraic equations .",
    "integrals with five and six external legs are worked out explicitly .",
    "those with seven and more external legs need special investigation because there are different types of gram determinants vanishing and their consideration is postponed for this reason . the above cases with more than four external legs allow particular simplifications : for n=5 due to the property ( [ siebzehn ] ) and the property of the recurrence relation ( [ sechsundzwanzig ] ) and for @xmath9 due to properties of gram determinants . our scheme allows also to evaluate diagrams with @xmath10 , but here we can not use the above mentioned properties . a simplification is achieved in this case since solving of linear equations is avoided and the algorithm is implemented in a form @xcite program for these cases",

    "we shall use the relation proposed in @xcite    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is a tensor operator , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is the operator shifting the value of the space - time dimension of the integral by two units : @xmath19 . on the right - hand side of ( [ tensint ] )",

    "first of all we mention the following useful relation between @xmath56 and @xmath42 : @xmath57 the basic object for the purpose of expressing the derivatives in ( [ recursej ] ) , ( [ reducejanddtod ] ) and ( [ reducedtod ] ) turns out to be the `` modified cayley determinant '' of the diagram with internal lines 1 @xmath58 @xcite , namely @xmath59 labeling elements 0 @xmath60 .",

    "finally the double sum can be completely reduced to a single sum by means of @xcite @xmath75 this relation reduces simultaneously indices and dimension , which is what one wants in general .",
    "it is not possible , however , to introduce it directly into ( [ six ] ) since in ( [ six ] ) we explicitly have to separate the term @xmath76 .",
    "therefore , further details of how to apply recurrence relation ( [ recursej ] ) can be given only in the case of explicit examples ( see sect .",

    "( 20 ) and ( 18 ) of the first paper of @xcite . in sect .",
    "3 we demonstrate how to reduce tensor integrals to scalar ones , to which these recurrence relations are then applied .",
    "furthermore the following general observation is needed in what follows . applying the recursion relations , contractions of the @xmath0-th line occur . in this case",
    "we encounter integrals with @xmath80 . in order to apply our recursion relations for this case",
    ", we must properly define @xmath56 .",
    "we can either shift all momenta by @xmath81 or we can use from the very beginning the definition of @xmath56 in terms of ( [ mcd ] ) with @xmath80 . in this manner",
    "the recurrence relations remain unchanged .    if our recurrence relations are to be implemented in terms of a computer - algebra program , the following steps are recommended . at first , by using ( [ tensint ] ) we reduce tensor integrals to scalar ones with shifted dimension ( see also below ) . in a second step",
    "we apply ( [ reducejanddtod],[eight ] ) and then ( [ reducedtod],[nine ] ) .",

    "3 .      when one or both of the determinants @xmath56 and @xmath42 are equal to zero the reduction procedure must be modified . in such cases",
    "it is possible to express integrals with @xmath0 lines as a combination of integrals with @xmath11 lines .",

    "yet another relation can be obtained from ( [ reducedtod ] ) : @xmath89 in fact both decompositions are equivalent since for @xmath83 , cancelling the common factor in @xmath42 and @xmath90 , the following relation holds @xmath91 we will see in the next sect . that indeed further important consequences follow from @xmath83 .",

    "moreover the remaining integrals are all reduced to standard 4- and 5-point functions for @xmath139 .",

    "a regulator mass is needed for infrared divergences .",
    "we restricted ourselves to tensors of rank 3 .",
