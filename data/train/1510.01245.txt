    "as stated in the introduction , the @xmath1 violating parameters of the decay @xmath49  obtained in this paper can be used to constrain the angle @xmath8 in the ckm unitarity triangle . in the following ,",
    "we estimate the possible pollution from loop diagrams with two methods : isospin invariance and su(3 ) flavor symmetry .",
    "we use our result together with other belle results to obtain a constraint on @xmath8 from a isospin analysis  @xcite in the @xmath419 system . neglecting electroweak contributions or isospin - breaking effects , the complex @xmath419 amplitudes for the various charge configurations of the @xmath420 system",
    "can be related via @xmath421 where the amplitudes with @xmath422 ( @xmath423 ) transitions are denoted as @xmath424 ( @xmath425 ) and the subscripts identify the charges of the two @xmath32 mesons .",
    "these relations can be visualized as two isospin triangles , as shown in  .",
    "since the charged @xmath10 decay @xmath426 proceeds only via a tree level diagram , the two isospin triangles share the same base @xmath427 . the phase difference between the two sides @xmath428 and @xmath429 corresponds to the shift @xmath430 due to additional contributions .",
    "this method leads to an eight - fold ambiguity in the determination of @xmath8 , as there are four possible orientations of the two triangles and two solutions from the trigonometric conversion of @xmath431 .",
    "the amplitudes are constructed from the branching fractions and the direct @xmath1 asymmetries @xmath29 and are then used to obtain the possible pollution in the mixing - induced @xmath1 asymmetry @xmath432 , obtained from the measurement of @xmath433 decays .",
    "the remaining sides of the triangles are constructed from other belle results : the longitudinally polarized fraction of @xmath434 with @xmath435  @xcite and the longitudinally polarized fraction of @xmath436 with @xmath437  @xcite .",
    "we convert the @xmath144 distribution constructed from the five amplitudes , including the correlations obtained from this measurement , into a probability scan as shown in   ( a ) .",
    "two solutions for @xmath8 are found , the one that is consistent with other sm - based constraints yields @xmath438 .",
    "the size of the penguin contributions is consistent with zero : @xmath439 . because of the very small @xmath440 branching fraction relative to the other two @xmath419 decays , the four solutions from the isospin analysis collapse into the two distinct solutions .",
    "( -380,120)(a)(-165,120)(b )      the amplitude of @xmath49  decays can be written in terms of tree and penguin contributions @xmath441 where @xmath442 and @xmath443 are the magnitude of the tree and penguin amplitudes , respectively , @xmath444 is their strong - phase difference and @xmath445 is the phase of @xmath446 .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , the su(3 ) symmetry provides an alternative way to remove the penguin contribution from @xmath447 by relating @xmath49  decays to the pure penguin mode @xmath448 : @xmath449 where @xmath450 and the factor @xmath451 is taken from ref .",
    "@xcite and accounts for possible su(3 ) breaking ( @xmath452 corresponds to no breaking ) .",

    "with @xmath459 a probability scan similar to the isospin analysis can be performed , as shown in   ( b ) , where each of the two double peaks consists of one solution for @xmath460 and one otherwise .",
    "the solution most compatible with other sm - based constraints and for the theoretically motivated case @xmath460 is @xmath461 .",
    "varying @xmath462 within the quoted error results in the second uncertainty , denoted as `` su(3 ) '' .",
    "we furthermore obtain @xmath463 and @xmath464 .",
    "we have presented measurements of the branching fraction of @xmath49  decays , the fraction of longitudinally polarized @xmath48 mesons , as well as the @xmath1-violating parameters in the decay into a pair of longitudinally polarized @xmath32 mesons using the final belle data set of @xmath465 @xmath70  pairs .",
    "improvements compared to previous belle measurements are the increased data sample and the simultaneous extraction of all observables .",
    "the measurement is optimized for a high signal yield , as the @xmath1-violating parameters are still statistically limited .",
    "the inclusion of the helicity angles provides additional and strong separation power between the various components and the simultaneous fit to @xmath142 improves the continuum separation in particular .",
    "this procedure reduces the statistical uncertainties significantly at the cost of higher analysis complexity and a longer computing time .",
    "the obtained results are in excellent agreement with the previous measurements  @xcite and predictions  @xcite and are currently the most precise measurement of the branching fraction and longitudinal polarization fraction as well as the tightest constraint on @xmath1 violation in this decay .",
    "we use our results , together with other belle measurements of @xmath419 decays , to constrain the internal angle @xmath8 of the ckm unitarity triangle with an isospin analysis .",
    "we obtain @xmath438 as the solution most compatible with other sm - based fits .",
    "the uncertainty of this scan is dominated by the large uncertainty on the branching fraction for the decay @xmath466 .",
