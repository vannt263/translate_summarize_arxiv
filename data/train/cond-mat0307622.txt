    "molecularly thin polyelectrolyte multilayer films are composed of alternating layers of oppositely charged polyions and are important for a variety of potential applications  @xcite . supported multilayer films",
    "are normally produced via layer - by - layer ( lbl ) adsorption of polyanions and polycations on a planar  @xcite or spherical  @xcite charged solid surface . in the later case ,",
    "the colloidal template can be dissolved to give so - called polyelectrolyte microcapsules  @xcite .",
    "the shell of such microcapsules is nothing more than a free standing multilayer film .",
    "the free thin film geometry allows investigation of properties not accessible in the bulk or in supported films and helps to gain a better understanding of polyelectrolytes in general .",
    "there have been a number of recent experimental studies of mechanical properties of thin multilayer films .",
    "first , by studying osmotically induced buckling of `` hollow '' ( water inside ) capsules immersed in a polyelectrolyte solution  @xcite , the young s modulus was found to be above 1000 mpa , close to the elasticity of the _ bulk plastics _  @xcite .",
    "the second , more recent , approach is based on measuring the deformation of microcapsules under applied load using an atomic force microscope ( afm )  @xcite .",
    "this method yielded an estimate of the limit for young s modulus of the order of 1 - 10 mpa which corresponds to an _ elastomer _",
    "the reason for such a discrepancy between two approaches might be hidden in the assumptions of the models used to fit experimental data .",
    "the first model assumes that the shell is highly permeable for water , even on short timescales of the relaxation of buckling deformation .",
    "the second approach treats the shell as impermeable for water on short timescales , relying on the conservation of capsule volume for small deformations .",
    "the accuracy of existing experimental results does not allow to conclude which approach is more realistic .",
    "in this paper we propose an alternative way to probe the elastic properties of a polyelectrolyte multilayer .",
    "the method is based on studying the swelling of microcapsules filled with a solution of a strong polyelectrolyte .",
    "the size of a swollen capsule depends on the young s modulus of the capsule shell .",
    "fitting the experimental data to the prediction of a simple model yields young s modulus of the polyelectrolyte multilayer of the order of 100 mpa .",
    "we argue that our results give the limit of young s modulus .",
    "taken together with recent afm observations  @xcite , this result leads to the conclusion that the mechanical behavior of a polyelectrolyte multilayer is that of an _ elastomer . _",
    "we consider a `` filled '' ( polyelectrolyte solution inside ) capsule immersed in a low molecular weight solvent ( water in our case ) . the capsule swells due to excess osmotic pressure of the inner solution .",
    "the osmotic pressure of polyelectrolyte solutions is the sum of polymer and counterion contributions .",
    "however , in a salt - free solution the latter exceeds the osmotic pressure due to polymer itself by several orders of magnitude  @xcite .",
    "the capsule shell is permeable to the solvent ( on time scales larger than the characteristic diffusion time ) , but impermeable to the encapsulated polymer of high molecular weight .",
    "then the solvent diffuses into the capsule until the elastic force of the stretched shell balances the osmotic pressure .",
    "we assume that the inner polyelectrolyte solution remains electroneutral , i.e. all counter ions due to polyelectrolyte dissociation remain in the capsule interior .",
    "a similar assumption was used in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we also assume that , for small relative deformations , the response of the capsule shell is elastic .",
    "if the capsule swells from the initial radius @xmath0 to a final radius @xmath1 the energy of stretching of the shell is given by the elastic theory of membranes  @xcite    @xmath2    where @xmath3 is young s modulus , @xmath4 is poisson s ratio ( @xmath5 , and @xmath6 is the shell thickness ( @xmath7 .    for a dilute solution of the inner polyelectrolyte , or , alternatively , small concentration @xmath8 of counterions in the capsule , the osmotic pressure induced by the counterions reads    @xmath9    here @xmath10 is the number of counterions and @xmath11 is the osmotic coefficient , defined as the ratio of experimentally measured osmotic pressure @xmath12 to the ideal osmotic pressure of all counterions .",
    "the difference between these two values is due to a fraction of condensed counterions being bound to the polyelectrolyte chain and not contributing to the osmotic pressure  @xcite .",
    "the work done by the osmotic pressure @xmath12 to swell the capsule from radius @xmath13 to @xmath1 then reads    @xmath14    the equilibrium radius of the capsule is given by the minimum of the total energy @xmath15 , where @xmath16 , giving    @xmath17    to relate the number of counterions to the concentration of the polymer in the solution we need to know the degree of dissociation , i.e. the number of counterions per monomer . for a strong polyelectrolyte",
    "this number could be taken as 1 , i.e. one counterion per monomer . then    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the concentration of the polymer solution in the capsule before it swells",
    ", @xmath20 is the avogadro number . substituting eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) one obtains    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the universal gas constant .",
    "equation ( [ eq6 ] ) relates the size of the swollen capsule to the concentration of the inner solution , thickness of the capsule shell , and young s modulus .",
    "our model allows design of a swelling experiment . to determine the young s modulus",
    ", one can measure the deformation of the capsule as a function of concentration @xmath19 and the shell thickness @xmath6 and then fit the experimental data to eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) .",
    "for an initial application of our approach we have chosen to study two types of capsules , characterized by different methods of encapsulation and templated on different cores .",
    "the first type are `` filled '' capsules prepared on manganese carbonate templates by a controlled precipitation  @xcite , i.e. by an assembly of the inner layer of polyelectrolyte shell by means of multivalent ions with the subsequent extraction of these ions and polymer release into the capsule interior .",
    "the second type of `` filled ''",
    "capsules were made from the `` hollow '' ones , templated on melamine formaldehyde particles , by regulating their permeability for high molecular weight polymers  @xcite .    as a polyelectrolyte for encapsulation we have chosen sodium polystyrene sulfonate ( pss ) .",
    "the behavior of this highly charged flexible polyanion in salt - free conditions has been studied both theoretically  @xcite and experimentally  @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath23 for pss was found to range from 0.2 to 1 and suggests some condensation of counter - ions  @xcite .",
    "the fluorescent dye rhodamine b isothiocyanate ( rbitc ) , monomers allylamide and 4-styrenesulfonic acid sodium salt hydrate ( ss ) , shell - forming polyelectrolytes poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate ) ( pss ; @xmath24 ) and poly(allylamine hydrochloride ) ( pah ; @xmath25 ) , and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( edta ) were purchased from sigma - aldrich chemie gmbh , germany .",
    "hydrochloric acid ( hcl ) , acetone and sodium chloride ( nacl ) were purchased from riedel - de han ; germany .",
    "the ionic initiator potassium peroxodisulfate ( k@xmath26s@xmath26o@xmath27 for the radical polymerisation and y(no@xmath28 were obtained from merck gmbh ; germany .",
    "all chemicals were of analytical purity or higher quality and were used without further purification .",
    "to produce labelled pss for encapsulation we used a modification of a method published in ref .",
    "first , labelled allylamide was made which was afterwards mixed with 4-styrenesulfonic acid sodium salt hydrate and then copolymerised radically .",
    "the allylamide was mixed with rbitc solved in ethanol .",
    "the mixture was stirred for four hours at room temperature .",
    "afterwards ss was added in an amount corresponding to a label grade of about 200 monomer units each .",
    "then k@xmath26s@xmath26o@xmath29 was added to this solution as an ionic initiator for the radical polymerisation .",
    "the mixture was heated up to @xmath30c and was stirred for four hours in a nitrogen atmosphere .",
    "afterwards it was centrifuged with a membrane which filters molecules with a molecular weight of 100,000 g / mol or more , and polydispersity was found to be m@xmath31/m@xmath321.8 .",
    "the remaining pss was chopped into small parts and washed with ethanol until no more colour could be observed in the filtrate .",
    "suspensions of monodispersed weakly cross - linked melamine formaldehyde particles ( mf - particles ) with a radius of @xmath33 m were purchased from microparticles gmbh ( berlin , germany ) .    the manganese carbonate template ( mnco@xmath34 was prepared by a mixing method described in ref .",
    "briefly , acidic manganese sulfate solution ( @xmath35  m , ph=4.2 adjusted by sulfuric acid ) was added at 1:1 volume ratio to @xmath36  m nh@xmath37hco@xmath38 .",
    "then the stirred mixture was aged at @xmath39c for 16 hours .",
    "the resulting mnco@xmath38 particles had a spherical shape with a radius of 1.85@xmath400.2 @xmath41 m and @xmath42 m .",
    "water used for all experiments was purified by a commercial milli - q gradient a10 system containing ion exchange and charcoal stages , and had a resistivity higher than 18m@xmath43/cm .",
    "two different approaches have been exploited for preparation of filled capsules .            the preparation of filled capsules of the first type consisted of several steps ( fig.1 ) .",
    "the first step ( fig.1a ) was surface controlled precipitation of labeled pss ( by complex formation with y@xmath44 ions ) on the surface of mnco@xmath38  @xcite . by varying the number of precipitated layers we were able to tune the surface density for adsorbed layers , and , therefore , the number of pss molecules precipitated on mnco@xmath45 particles . in our experiments we prepared samples with 20 - 80 layers of adsorbed labeled pss , which should lead to a surface density , @xmath46 , in the range from @xmath47 to @xmath48mol / m@xmath49 .",
    "these values were calculated by assuming that the surface density for a monolayer is constant , and that the amount of adsorbed pss grows linearly with the number of deposited layers  @xcite . as a result , each capsule contained up to a few pg of pss , depending on the template size and amount of assembled layers . with such a method ,",
    "the concentration of encapsulated polyelectrolyte is approximately equal to @xmath50 .",
    "the mnco@xmath38 particles were dissolved in @xmath51 1mol / l hcl after assembling of 7 layers in order to facilitate the process of core removal since shells with a thickness of more then 10 layers prevent ion penetration  @xcite .",
    "core dissolution led to the formation of `` double shell '' structured capsules ( fig.1c ) .",
    "the inner shell formed by the pss / y@xmath44 complex was not stable and was decomposed either by metal - ion complex agents ( edta ) or in salt solution .",
    "yttrium ions were gradually expelled out of the outer stable shell formed by pss / pah while pss molecules were released into the capsule interior ( fig.1d ) . then the polyelectrolyte capsules were covered additionally with a number of layers varied in the interval from 1 to 13 to tune the final shell thickness , which , as a result , varied from 4 to 10 pss / pah bilayers .",
    "the `` filled '' capsules of the second type were made from pre - formed `` hollow '' capsules  @xcite .",
    "the original `` hollow '' capsules were produced by a standard lbl assembly of 4 pss / pah bilayers on mf particles .",
    "mf - particles coated with pss / pah multilayers were dissolved in @xmath51 1mol / l hcl and mf - oligomers were removed by washing , as described in  @xcite .",
    "then the encapsulation of polymer included several steps .",
    "( fig.2 ) .",
    "the original `` hollow '' capsules ( fig.2a ) were exposed to acetone / water mixture ( 1:1 ) to make the polyelectrolyte multilayer permeable for high molecular weight polymer  @xcite , and the pss molecules were added to the mixture .",
    "the permeable state of the capsule shell allows the polymers to penetrate inside ( fig.2b ) . during the encapsulation process",
    "the pss concentration was increased gradually to avoid an osmotic collapse of the microcapsules  @xcite .",
    "the initial concentration was 1g / l , and was doubled every hour .",
    "when the required concentration was reached , the mixture was diluted with water and the multilayer shells were assumed to return to an impermeable state ( fig.2c ) . after washing in pure water",
    "the capsules contain polymer solution ( fig.2d ) .",
    "with such a method , the concentration of encapsulated polyelectrolyte ( before swelling ) is approximately equal to the final concentration in the bulk .      to scan the capsule shape and to measure the concentration of pss inside the capsules we used a commercial confocal microscope manufactured by olympus ( japan ) consisting of the confocal laser scanning - unit olympus fv 300 in combination with an inverted microscope olympus ix70 equipped with a high resolution 100 [ line - through ] * * oil immersion objective .",
    "the excitation wavelength was chosen according to the label rhodamine ( 543 nm ) .",
    "the z - position scanning was done in steps of 0.2 @xmath41 m .",
    "the diameters of the swollen capsules were determined optically with an accuracy of 0.4 @xmath41 m .",
    "concentration measurements were performed via the fluorescence intensity coming from the interior of the pss containing capsules . in this case",
    "we assumed that fluorescence is directly proportional to pss concentration and used a calibration curve of fluorescence intensity of free polymer in the bulk solution .",
    "the measured concentration was then recalculated to the initial concentration inside unswollen capsules .",
    "the 3d confocal scanning showed that the capsules filled with pss have spherical form .",
    "it should be noted that immediately after the preparation the capsule sizes were close to the size of the templates used for their preparation .",
    "the capsules swell for at least several days before reaching their equilibrium size , so that all the measurements of the radius of the swollen capsules were performed 2 weeks after filling with pss .",
    "fig.3 ( top ) shows a typical confocal fluorescence image of the swollen capsules .",
    "the fluorescence intensity suggests a uniform concentration in the capsule s interior .",
    "the bright interior of the capsules did not change with time , and there was no fluorescence signal from water .",
    "this proves that the capsules are in the impermeable state .",
    "typical fluorescence intensity profiles along the diameter of the capsules are presented in fig.3 ( bottom ) .",
    "we note that the level of fluorescence from the wall is higher than from the interior , which could be connected with some adsorption of the inner polyelectrolyte  @xcite .",
    "the size of the swollen capsules was determined as an average of 6 - 10 capsules .",
    "the variability in size of the similarly prepared capsules was always within the error of optical measurements .",
    "we found that the `` filled '' capsules are always larger than the original colloidal template , and that their radius depends on the size of the original template , the number of the bilayers in the shell , and the amount of encapsulated polyelectrolyte .",
    "these observations are consistent with our theoretical model .",
    "fig.4 illustrates the typical dependence of equilibrium radius on the shell thickness . here",
    ", the results for the first type of `` filled '' capsules ( mnco@xmath52 template ) filled with pss solutions of different concentrations , and made on the particles of the same size @xmath53 m are given .",
    "it was previously found  @xcite that the thickness of a pss / pah bilayer is in the range of 3 - 5 nm . here to evaluate the thickness of the shell with a known number of pss / pah bilayers we use the average value of 4 nm , as before  @xcite .",
    "the radius of the swollen capsules decreases with the shell thickness and is larger for the capsules with higher concentration of the inner polyelectrolyte solution .",
    "we fitted these experimental results to eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) taking the combination of young s modulus and the osmotic coefficient @xmath54 as a fitting parameter and obtained the value of @xmath55 mpa for both curves presented in fig.4 .",
    "one can see that the predictions of the model are indeed confirmed by experiment , and the continuum mechanics approach is applicable for a molecularly thin multilayer film .",
    "template of radius 1.85@xmath41 m as a function of the shell thickness .",
    "two concentrations are shown : @xmath56 mol / l ( squares ) and",
    "@xmath57mol / l ( circles ) .",
    "fitting ( solid curves ) corresponds to @xmath58 , width=302 ]     mpa ( mnco@xmath52template , circles ) and @xmath55 mpa ( mf template , squares),width=302 ]    the dependence of the equilibrium radius on the concentration of the inner polyelectrolyte , both the fitting curves and the experimental data , are shown in fig.5 .",
    "here we present data both for the capsules of the first ( mnco@xmath52 template ) and the second ( mf template ) types .",
    "the capsules are made on the templates of different size @xmath59 m and @xmath60 m , correspondingly .",
    "the shell was always composed by four pss / pah bilayers . from the fit of experimental data",
    "we have obtained @xmath61 mpa for the first type , and @xmath55 mpa for the second type of capsules .",
    "one can conclude that , taking into account realistic values of the osmotic coefficients  @xcite for pss solutions , young s modulus @xmath3 found in our swelling experiment is of the order of 100 mpa .",
    "this value is confined between the values found in the osmotic buckling experiment  @xcite and recent afm results  @xcite and requires further comments .",
    "we remark and stress that current study gives the possible value of young s modulus .",
    "in reality , the excess osmotic pressure could be smaller than estimated from the known concentration of polyelectrolyte chains .",
    "one reason for such a decrease could be connected with a partial dissociation of the pss , while our model assumed that it is fully dissociated .",
    "one also can not exclude that some of the counter - ions might condense on the polyelectrolyte shell .",
    "besides that , a portion of counter - ions could escape from the inner polyelectrolyte solution to the outer solvent , reducing the osmotic pressure difference .",
    "such a possibility was not included in our model .",
    "all these effects ( also ignored in ref .",
    "@xcite ) will effectively lead to smaller values of the young s modulus .",
    "thus , our results strongly support the results of previous afm studies  @xcite implying that we are dealing with an _ elastomer _  @xcite .",
    "in other words , the value of young s modulus of the polyelectrolyte multilayer falls in the range characteristic for cross - linked rubbers .",
    "such a mechanical behavior is probably due to strong interaction between polyanions and polycations in the multilayer .",
    "our model also shows that the final permeability of the shell to water is very important for the stabilization of the microcapsules , increasing the threshold of the buckling transition  @xcite .",
    "we also note that the current method includes only a few assumptions , compared to the buckling transition and afm measurements .",
    "we assume that the capsule deformations are small and elastic .",
    "these assumptions are also present in the theory of buckling and in the model used to describe capsules deformed in the afm experiment .",
    "the theory of buckling transition assumes that the capsule is highly permeable to water even on a short time scale of the buckling deformation .",
    "the afm experiment - based model postulates a priori a spherical shape of the capsule ( except in the contact regions ) , conservation of capsule volume , and neglects bending deformations .",
    "there is no need for these assumptions in describing the capsule swelling , since the capsule shape is always spherical and the process of swelling is a slow process , i.e. the diffusion of water through the capsule shell takes place and does not affect the capsule swelling .",
    "we have provided a theoretical model , which relates young s modulus , shell thickness , capsule radius and concentration of the inner polyelectrolyte solution .",
    "the validity of the model was experimentally verified , and confirms the applicability of the macroscopic continuum mechanics approach to polyelectrolyte multilayer microcapsules .",
    "young s modulus of the molecularly thin polyelectrolyte multilayer was found to be of the order of 100 mpa .",
    "this represents the possible value for young s modulus and is close to the elasticity of an _",
    "elastomer_. such a value reflects a high degree of local interactions between polyanions and polycations . hence , mechanically at small deformations the polyelectrolyte multilayer resembles a cross - linked rubber material .",
    "we acknowledge the support of the alexander von humboldt foundation through a research fellowship ( da ) and a sofja kovalevskaja award ( gbs ) .",
