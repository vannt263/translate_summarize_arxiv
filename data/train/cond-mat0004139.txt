    "in recent years quantum dots have attracted great attention",
    ". a quantum dot can be thought of as an artificial atom with adjustable parameters .",
    "it is of more than fundamental interest to study its properties under various circumstances , e.g. by transport experiments  @xcite . by considering a double - quantum - dot system , the analogy with real atoms",
    "can be stretched to include artificial molecules .",
    "the analogue of the covalent bond is then formed by an electron which coherently tunnels back and forth between the two dots . by applying electromagnetic radiation with a frequency equal to the level detuning in the double - dot system",
    ", an electron can undergo so - called spatial rabi oscillations even when the tunneling matrix element between the dots is small .",
    "recently , several time - dependent transport measurements on quantum - dot systems have been reported  @xcite , most of them being of a spectroscopic nature .",
    "it has also been suggested to construct devices from quantum dots .",
    "examples of such applications are pumps that transfer electrons one by one at zero bias voltage by using time - dependent voltages to raise and lower tunnel barrier heights  @xcite , or systems in which coupled quantum dots ( or quantum wells ) are used for quantum - scale information processing  @xcite .",
    "several theoretical models for time - dependent transport through a double quantum dot have already been proposed .",
    "for instance , in ref .",
    "@xcite d. c. transport was considered for arbitrary bias voltage when the signal couples to the gate voltages of the dots . at zero bias voltage",
    "the system operates as an electron pump . in  ref .",
    "@xcite the d. c. current , controlled by external irradiation , was considered for finite bias voltage .",
    "these results were recently generalized to include time - dependent gate and bias voltages and tunnel barriers  @xcite .",
    "in all these works a tunneling - hamiltonian approach was used to incorporate the effects of coulomb interaction between electrons on the same and on different dots .",
    "it is assumed that the barriers separating the leads and the dots are high and therefore the wave functions have only a small overlap .",
    "a different approach would be to use scattering states of electrons which extend through the leads and dots which is appropriate for almost transparent barriers ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "however , the effects of coulomb interaction are not easily taken into account in this approach . because the transport mechanism in the above mentioned double - dot pumps is determined by sequential tunneling ,",
    "electrons are pumped _",
    "incoherently _ i.e. the tunneling of an electron into and out of the device are independent events .",
    "also , in these works the time - dependent signal is taken to be a monochromatic .    in this paper",
    "we describe ,  firstly , an new mode of operation of such an electron pump . in this case",
    ", electrons can be transferred coherently through the system by means of a co - tunneling process .",
    "our device has to be designed in such a way that interdot coulomb repulsion is important .",
    "by appropriately adjusting the gate voltages the device can be made to operate in the co - tunneling regime or the sequential tunneling regime .",
    "the latter regime is considered here for comparison with previous works and should be distinguished from the coherent one . in the co - tunneling regime",
    "the interdot _ attraction _ between an extra electron excited by the a. c. field into one dot and the hole it left in the other dot stabilizes the excited state .",
    "electrons are prevented from entering or leaving the device independently and inelastic co - tunneling is the lowest non - vanishing order process for transport .",
    "this involves correlated tunneling events through the different junctions connecting the dots weakly to the leads .",
    "the system switches _ coherently _ from the excited state to the ground state each time an electron is pumped through the dots .",
    "alternatively , this process can be seen as coherent transport through a double - quantum - dot qubit .",
    "the second main result of this paper is that we predict the effect of slow modulation of the irradiation amplitude on the pumping current .",
    "the timescale of the amplitude modulation is assumed to be much larger than the one set by the frequency of the unmodulated signal .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : system ] we introduce the system . in sec .",
    "[ sec : timescale ] we develop the density matrix approach to describe the system only on a timescale much larger than the period of the applied irradiation .",
    "this development is similar to that in quantum - optics for resonance fluorescence e.g.  @xcite and is central to our treatment of the problems .",
    "we apply this approach to the transport through the double - dot in the sequential and the co - tunneling regime . in sec .",
    "[ sec : modulation ] we consider the case where the amplitude of the applied radiation is modulated on the large timescale .",
    "finally , a summary and conclusions are presented in sec .",

    "the width of the co - tunnel peak is also smaller than in the sequential tunneling regime .",
    "in this section we consider the sequential tunneling regime already discussed in section [ sec : sequential ] and apply our approach for large timescales to the cases of pulsed and slow sinusoidal modulation of the irradiation amplitude .      by means of irradiation pulses quantum states in the dots can be manipulated . assuming the double dot to be in the ground state @xmath221 at @xmath222 we solve equations ( [ eq : seq ] )  with @xmath223 for the time - evolution under the influence of the irradiation for the case @xmath224 : @xmath225\\ ] ] where @xmath226 is the rabi frequency . for @xmath227",
    "the solution tends to the stationary current ( [ eq : imaxseq ] ) derived before : @xmath228 when the irradiation is switched off at @xmath229 , the current decays exponentially as @xmath230 to zero , as can also be seen by solving the equations for the case @xmath231 .",
    "one can resolve the rabi oscillations in the d.c .- current by considering the current averaged over a series of identical pulses  @xcite with delay @xmath232 , as a function of the pulse - length @xmath233 ( see inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : iperiod ] ) : @xmath234 here @xmath235 to ensure that the system is prepared in the ground state ( [ eq : rhoinitial ] ) at the beginning of the pulse . in the physically interesting case of weak coupling to the leads",

    "[ fig : iperiod ] ) .",
    "the period of the coherent oscillation at resonance @xmath239 , @xmath240 , can be tuned by varying the irradiation power @xmath241 .",
    "now consider the case where the amplitude of the irradiation is slowly sinusoidally modulated with small modulation amplitude @xmath242 : @xmath243 the case where the modulation amplitude is of the order of or larger than the irradiation amplitude is physically not very interesting because the system then exhibits trivial fourier peaks at @xmath67 , @xmath244 and @xmath245 as a function of @xmath68 in the d.c .- current . to find an analytical solution , we rewrite equations ( [ eq : seq ] )  with @xmath246 in matrix notation : @xmath247 where @xmath248 ,",
    "@xmath249and expand the bessel function @xmath250 in a taylor series to second order in @xmath251 .",
    "if we now consider the fourier coefficients @xmath252  of @xmath253  and @xmath254  of @xmath255 , we find the following equations for the d.c .- component and first harmonic , if we disregard higher harmonics @xmath256 from which we can solve for the d.c .-",
    "component @xmath257 if we furthermore assume that @xmath258 , the solution shows additional sidepeaks in the photoresponse of the system , which are in good approximation lorentzians along the hyperbola @xmath259 i.e. @xmath260 as plotted in fig .",
    "( [ fig : sinusmod ] ) .",
    "the height of these peaks is @xmath261 with @xmath262 and the half - width at half maximum is @xmath263 these sidepeaks thus resolve the rabi splitting as described in refs .",
    "@xcite in terms of quasi - energies .",
    "the height of these peaks can be of the order of the first satellite peak and should therefore be experimentally observable .",
    "notice that at @xmath264 the width diverges ; however , the current peak at this point vanishes since the exact matching @xmath265 gives a  resonance to which the modulation can not add extra current .",
    "thus by applying a high frequency @xmath67 we reduce the energy spacing by a large amount , @xmath187 , and modify the tunneling matrix element with an intensity ( @xmath66 ) dependent factor , @xmath266 .",
    "the lower frequency @xmath267 allows one to precisely match the remaining small energy difference @xmath268 without significantly altering the tunneling matrix element @xmath269 , thereby inducing a photo - current .",
    "we have considered an *  * electron pump consisting of an double quantum dot subject to irradiation . an incoherent and a new coherent pumping mechanism were discussed .",
    "we have derived equations of motion for the density matrix elements of the double - dot system which aretime - averaged over an interval which is long compared to the period of the applied signal . from these equations we calculated the pumping current in both regimes . in both cases",
    "the current peak is a lorentzian .",
    "surprisingly , for fixed effective tunnel coupling the maximal pumping current in the co - tunneling regime is larger by a factor @xmath220 compared to the value in the sequential tunneling regime , where the maximum occurs at a different value of the tunnel rates for each regime .",
    "experimental realization of this device would allow for a systematic study of coherent transport through a solid - state qubit .",
    "moreover , modulation of the irradiation amplitude exhibits interesting phenomena : a train of short pulses should resolve the rabi frequency in the time - averaged current as a function of the pulse length , and sinusoidal amplitude modulation should provide a tool to resolve the rabi splitting .",
