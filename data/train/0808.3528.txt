    "negative index media ( nim ) that have simultaneously negative permittivity and permeability , have attracted intensive interest recently .",
    "these media exhibit several extraordinary effects such as negative refraction , backward waves , and evanescent wave amplification @xcite , seeming to challenge several concepts well established for familiar positve index media ( pim ) in electromagnetism and optics .",
    "nim materials are not generally found in nature , and thus need to be artificially constructed . though the concept of nim was already proposed by vesalogo in 1968 @xcite",

    "so far , a variety of nim structures have been proposed @xcite in the microwave regime .",
    "more recently , nim structures operating in the infrared and visible frequency range have also been reported @xcite , e.g. , a nim formed by an array of pairs of parallel gold rods was demonstrated to have a negative refraction index at a wavelength of @xmath1 @xmath2 m @xcite .    while the study of various nim structures has been a subject of growing interest during the past few years",
    ", several research works have involved waveguides with nim components , and interesting properties of guidance were reported @xcite . for a nim slab waveguide ,",
    "the portion of a guided mode inside the slab has a poynting vector contradirectional with the direction of the phase velocity of the mode , while the portion of the guided mode outside the slab has a poynting vector parallel to the phase velocity .",
    "the total energy flow of the guided mode may be codirectional or contradirectional with the phase flow .",
    "no fundamental mode exists in a nim slab , but it may still support a single - mode propagation under certain conditions .",
    "moreover , the interaction between pim and nim waveguides was investigated in [ 17 ] , and the phenomenon of anti - directional coupling was demonstrated , which offers a new possibility in the design of future devices and components .",
    "the bound modes of a nim and pim composite waveguide were also studied in [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] .",
    "the coupling of waves in planar dielectric waveguides provides a means of reflectionless signal transfer from one waveguide to another , thus plays an important role in integrated optics .",
    "compared to the conventional waveguide system @xcite , the coupled nim and pim waveguide system receives less attention . in this paper",
    "we will study carefully the coupling between planar nim and pim waveguides . for this purpose ,",
    "a coupled mode theory is developed for such a waveguide system .",
    "our analysis will show that there exist various possibilities of coupled mode solution for the nim and pim waveguide system , and the interaction of the guided modes of individual waveguides may even be equivalent to the interference of evanescent modes in the composite waveguide for particular cases . in section",

    "a coupler operating in this case is very easy to fabricate , as its coupling efficiency is insensitive to the coupling length . when the propagation constants @xmath11 and @xmath83 differs significantly , the modes in the composite waveguide may change from evanescent waves to propagating ones as @xmath9 increases . in the latter case",
    "the solution of the coupled mode equations is also a periodic function of the coupling length , but the coupled power is output in a direction opposite to that of input power .",
    "correspondingly , the modes in the composite waveguide are propagating waves , and one of the modes is a forward mode while the other is a backward one .",
    "finally we should indicate that as the nim medium is strongly dispersive , the various phenomena mentioned above may happen in the same waveguide system at different frequencies .",
