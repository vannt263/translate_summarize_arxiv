    "percolation theory has attracted a great deal of interest in the last few decades and the activity in the field is still growing @xcite . this is mainly because some aspects of the percolation process such as the geometrical phase transitions occurring in the system have gained a particular impetus due to the introduction of techniques such as monte carlo ( mc ) simulations and series expansions @xcite . however , the problem is far from being exhausted .",
    "in fact , most of the studies are devoted to the percolation of molecules that are irreversibly deposited . in part",
    "this is due to the fact that the deposition ( or irreversible adsorption ) of particles on solid surfaces is a subject of considerable practical importance . in many experiments on adhesion of colloidal particles and proteins on solid substrates ,",
    "the relaxation time scales are much longer than the times of the formation of the deposit . in such processes",
    ", the temperature of the system does not play any relevant role and it is not considered .",
    "however , in numerous systems of both theoretical and practical importance , where the adsorbed particles are in thermodynamic equilibrium , the spatial distribution of the adsorbate might be characterized by using the percolation model @xcite . in these cases ,",
    "the temperature governs the phase in the system and can be an important controlling factor in the percolation process . in the simplest case , where repulsive monomers are adsorbed on a square lattice , the system exhibits a continuous phase transition from a disordered state at high @xmath1 to a doubly - degenerated @xmath2 ordered state at low @xmath1 , with a critical temperature @xmath3 which satisfies @xmath4 @xcite , with @xmath5 , @xmath6 the boltzmann constant and @xmath7 the interaction energy between nearest - neighbour adatoms . on the other hand ,",
    "the same system with attractively interacting particles goes through a first - order phase transition .",
    "it is clear that a percolation study on the spatial configuration of the adlayer should recognize peculiarities related to the phase transitions occurring in the adsorbate .",
    "such a study implies the determination of the critical parameters as a function of the concentration ( surface coverage ) and temperature . to the best of our knowledge",
    "this study has not been done and it is the main purpose of this paper .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ bd ] the model of adsorption of interacting monomers on a two - dimensional square lattice",
    "is presented .",
    "the analysis of results obtained by using finite - size scaling theory is given in section [ fss ] . in section [ pd ] , the phase diagram is discussed along with the basis of a thermal finite - size scaling study .",
    "finally , conclusions are drawn in section [ c ] .",
    "let us consider that the substrate is represented by a two - dimensional square lattice of @xmath8 equivalent adsorption sites , with periodic boundary conditions . in order to describe the system of @xmath9 monomers",
    "adsorbed on @xmath10 sites at a given temperature @xmath1 , let us introduce the occupation variable @xmath11 which can take the following values :    @xmath12    particles can be adsorbed on the substrate with the restriction of at most one adsorbed particle per site and we consider a nearest - neighbour ( @xmath13 ) interaction energy @xmath7 between them . under these considerations ,",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is given by    @xmath14    where @xmath15 represents pairs of @xmath13 sites and @xmath16 is the adsorption energy of the sites on the surface .",
    "in addition , we have taken @xmath17 without loss of generality .",
    "for fixed values of surface coverage , @xmath18 , and temperature @xmath1 , the thermodynamic equilibrium is reached in the canonical ensemble by using a standard kawasaki algorithm @xcite .",
    "the procedure is as follows .",
    "an initial arbitrary configuration of @xmath9 adsorbed monomers with the desired surface coverage is generated .",
    "two sites are randomly selected , and their positions are established .",
    "then , an attempt is made to interchange their occupancy state with probability given by the metropolis rule @xcite :    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the difference between the hamiltonian evaluated at the final state and the one computed at the initial state . a monte carlo step ( mcs )",
    "is achieved when @xmath10 pair of sites have been tested to change its occupancy state .",
    "the time ( expressed in units of mcs ) required for equilibration depends on lattice size , temperature and coverage .",
    "typically , @xmath21 mcss suffices for smaller lattices containing up to @xmath22 sites in the whole range of both temperature and coverage .",
    "then , a set of @xmath23 samples in thermal equilibrium is generated by taking configurations separated from each other by @xmath24 mcss in order to avoid possible correlations between the states . in the smallest lattices considered in this paper",
    ", @xmath25 prevents such undesired correlations .",
    "the accuracy of the procedure and the correctness of the algorithm were tested by obtaining the behaviour of different quantities ( for example , the adsorption isotherms ( surface coverage , @xmath26 , versus the normalized chemical potential @xmath27 ) , the specific heat , the order parameter , etc ) and comparing with the corresponding ones derived from the real space renormalization group approach ( rsrg ) @xcite .",
    "the central idea of the percolation theory is based on finding the minimum concentration @xmath26 for which at least a cluster ( a group of occupied sites in such a way that each site has at least one occupied nearest - neighbour site ) extends from one side to the opposite one of the system .",
    "this particular value of the concentration rate is named _ critical concentration _ or _",
    "percolation threshold _ and determines a phase transition in the system . in this paper",
    ", the percolation process will be studied under two different perspectives .",
    "namely , samples will be prepared for fixed temperature ( coverage ) and variable coverage ( temperature ) .",
    "we call this feature _ coverage percolation _ ( _ thermal percolation _ ) .    in the random percolation model , a single site",
    "is occupied with probability @xmath28 .",
    "the samples are then generated through irreversible adsorption . in our problem ,",
    "the occupancy state of every site strongly depends on @xmath29 . in both cases , for a precise value of concentration , the percolation threshold of sites , at least one spanning cluster connects the borders of the system ( indeed , there exists a finite probability of finding @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) spanning clusters @xcite ) .",
    "then , a second - order phase transition appears at such coverage which is characterized by well - defined critical exponents .",
    "it should be emphasized that for @xmath32 the system becomes uncorrelated and formally we have the random percolation model .",
    "a study of the finite - size effects allows us to make a reliable extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "details of this study will be given below .",
    "it is well known that it is a quite difficult matter to analytically determine the value of the percolation threshold for a given lattice @xcite . for some special types of lattices ,",
    "geometrical considerations enable us to derive their percolation thresholds exactly .",
    "thus , exact thresholds for the random percolation problem are known for ( a ) square , triangular and honeycomb lattices and ( b ) triangular and kagome lattice concerning the bond and site problem , respectively . in both cases ,",
    "analytical results are obtained when a monomeric species is considered . for different conditions , i.e. for systems which do not present such a topological advantage",
    ", percolation thresholds have to be estimated numerically by means of computer simulations .",
    "as the scaling theory predicts @xcite , the larger the system size to study , the more accurate the values of the threshold obtained therefrom .",
    "thus , the finite - size scaling theory gives us the basis to achieve the percolation threshold and the critical exponents of a system with a reasonable accuracy .",
    "for this purpose , the probability @xmath34 that a lattice composed of @xmath35 elements ( sites or bonds ) percolates at concentration @xmath26 can be defined @xcite . here , as in @xcite ,",
    "the following definitions can be given according to the meaning of @xmath36 : ( a ) @xmath37 is the probability of finding a rightward ( downward ) percolating cluster ; ( b ) @xmath38 is the probability that we find a cluster which percolates both in a rightward * and * in a downward direction ; ( c ) @xmath39 is the probability of finding either a rightward * or * a downward percolating cluster and ( d ) @xmath40 \\equiv \\frac{1}{2 } \\left[r^{i } _ l(\\theta)+r^{u } _",
    "l(\\theta ) \\right ] $ ] .",
    "the first step for determining the percolation threshold consists in evaluating the effective threshold @xmath41 ( the concentration at which the slope of @xmath42 is the largest ) for a lattice of finite - size @xmath43 . in the mc simulations , @xmath42 is determined for each discrete value of @xmath26 according to the considered finite regular lattice @xcite .",
    "once the temperature is fixed , the next procedure is followed : ( a ) the construction of @xmath44 samples for a given coverage ( according to the scheme presented in section [ bd ] ) and ( b ) the cluster analysis by using the hoshen and kopelman algorithm @xcite . in the last step ,",
    "the number of clusters for each sample , @xmath45 , of size @xmath46 ( a cluster of size @xmath46 is composed by @xmath46 connected elements ) is determined in order to verify whether a percolating island exists .",
    "this spanning cluster could be determined by using the criteria @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 or @xmath50 .",
    "@xmath44 runs of two such steps are carried out for obtaining the number @xmath51 of them for which a percolating cluster of the desired criterion @xmath36 is found .",
    "then , @xmath52 is defined and the procedure is repeated for different values both of @xmath26 and lattice sizes , @xmath43 ( @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) .    in figure @xmath55 , the probabilities @xmath38 ( squares ) , @xmath39 ( circles ) and @xmath56 ( triangles ) are presented .",
    "three different values of @xmath29 are shown . from a first inspection of the figure ( and from data not shown here for the sake of clarity ) it is observed that ( a ) curves cross each other in a unique universal point , @xmath57 , which depends on the criterion @xmath36 used ; ( b ) those points do not modify their height for the different @xmath29 s .",
    "this finding indicates , as is expected , that the universality class of the phase transition involved in the problem is conserved no matter what the value of @xmath29 is ; ( c ) those points are located at very well - defined values in the @xmath26-axes , determining the critical percolation threshold for each @xmath29 ; ( d ) the standard percolation problem is recovered for @xmath32 giving a critical coverage @xmath58 and ( e ) @xmath59 increases ( decreases ) for positive ( negative ) value of @xmath29 .",
    "a detailed explanation of this point will be given below .",
    "the second step is the extrapolation of @xmath60 towards the limit @xmath33 by using the scaling hypothesis .",
    "thus , the correlation length , @xmath61 , can be expressed as    @xmath62    where the critical exponent @xmath63 is analytically shown to be equal to @xmath64 in the case of random percolation @xcite . as @xmath65 the correlation length reaches the linear dimension @xmath43 of the lattice .",
    "thus , we have    @xmath66    where @xmath67 is a non - universal constant .",
    "figure @xmath68 shows the extrapolation towards the thermodynamic limit of @xmath60 according to equation ( [ extrapolation ] ) for different values of @xmath29 as indicated .",
    "this figure lends support to the assertion given by equation ( [ extrapolation ] ) : ( a ) all the curves ( different criteria ) are well correlated by a linear function , ( b ) they have a quite similar value for the ordinate in the @xmath69 and ( c ) the fitting determines a different value of the constant @xmath70 depending on the type of criterion used .",
    "it is also important to note that @xmath71 gives an almost perfect horizontal line which is a great advantage of the method because it does not require precise values of critical exponents in the process of estimating percolation thresholds .",
    "the maximum of the differences between @xmath72 and @xmath73 give the error bar for each determination of @xmath59 .    the scaling law hypothesis also predicts the collapsing of the curves @xmath74 when they are plotted as a function of a reduced variable @xmath75 :    @xmath76    @xmath77 being with the scaling function .",
    "thus , @xmath78 is a universal function with respect to the variable @xmath79 . in figure @xmath80 , as an illustration , we plot @xmath81 as a function of @xmath79 for @xmath32 .",
    "this gives an additional indication for the numerical value of the critical exponent @xmath63 .",
    "as is clearly seen from this analysis , the problem belongs to the same universality class of random percolation regardless of the value of @xmath29 considered .",
    "the same procedure described above can be realized for different values of @xmath29 as is shown in figure @xmath82 just for @xmath32 , @xmath55 and @xmath83 .",
    "thus , for a given value of @xmath29 , all the curves used in the experiment ( for different values of @xmath43 ) collapse into a universal curve according to the theoretical prediction .",
    "however , @xmath78 is not only a function of @xmath26 and @xmath43 but also of @xmath29 . as can be seen",
    ", the collapsing function is different for each value of @xmath29 considered .",
    "this fact determines that the scaling function @xmath78 is not a universal function with respect to the variable @xmath29 ( each value of @xmath29 is represented by using a different type of line as indicated ) .    in order to determine the dependence of @xmath78 with @xmath29 , the main features of the collapsing data have to be considered in the range of @xmath29 between @xmath84 and @xmath85 . as can be seen",
    ", the curves become steeper upon increasing the value of @xmath29 .",
    "in fact , the derivative of the universal function @xmath78 with respect to @xmath79 behaves as a gaussian - like function .",
    "thus , we can observe that :    1 .",
    "the derivatives become more pronounced as @xmath29 increases .",
    "it is possible to establish a power law to describe this behavior .",
    "then , + @xmath86 + in a log  log scale the points are very well correlated by a linear function , as in equation ( [ sca1 ] ) , the numerical values of the fitting parameters being very similar for the three criteria used here .",
    "the derivatives are narrowed upon increasing @xmath29 .",
    "this behaviour can also be described by a power law according to : + @xmath87 + where @xmath88 is the standard deviation of @xmath89 for each curve .",
    "thus , the standard deviation of each derivative versus @xmath29 when plotted in a log  log scale is very well correlated by a linear function ( not shown here ) , with the fitting parameter @xmath90 for @xmath70 , @xmath50 and @xmath49 criteria .    according to the above equations",
    ", a metric factor might be included in the scaling function , equation ( [ functionr ] ) , in order to collapse all the curves in figure @xmath82 onto a single one .",
    "following @xcite , in figure @xmath91 we plot the probability @xmath81 as a function of the argument @xmath92 .",
    "as is clearly observed , all the curves collapse onto a single one .",
    "it is remarkable that more than @xmath93 points are included in the collapsing curve .",
    "the metric factor introduced here , @xmath94 , gives an additional indication for the numerical value of the exponent @xmath95 obtained in equation ( [ sca2 ] ) .",
    "by using the scheme discussed above , the critical curve , @xmath59 versus @xmath29 , separating the percolating and non - percolating regions , is presented in figure @xmath96 . in the studied range ,",
    "three regimes can be distinguished : @xmath97 for @xmath98 , @xmath59 remains constant as @xmath29 is decreased ; @xmath99 from @xmath100 up to@xmath101 ( @xmath100 ( @xmath101 ) being the reduced critical temperature for the condensation ( order  disorder ) phase transition occurring in the system ) , @xmath59 increases linearly with k and @xmath102 for @xmath103 , @xmath59 remains constant as @xmath29 is increased .",
    "this behaviour can be explained by simple geometrical arguments .",
    "namely , lateral attractive interactions favour the nucleation , which in turn increases the local connectivity and diminishes the percolating fraction of occupied sites .",
    "in contrast , repulsive couplings avoid the occupation of nearest neighbour sites , and consequently , increase the percolation threshold .",
    "in the limit cases , once @xmath104 is reached , the adlayer does not vary significantly as @xmath105 is increased , and @xmath59 reaches its saturation value .",
    "thus , @xmath106 for @xmath98 and @xmath107 for @xmath108 .",
    "as can be seen from the phase diagram , there exists an alternative route for determining the critical curve .",
    "in fact , the surface coverage can be kept constant while the reduced temperature , @xmath29 , is varied .",
    "this procedure does not constitute the ` standard ' technique for calculating percolation features and it will be revised in detail in what follows .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the idea of studying phase transitions upon varying a controlling parameter and at the same time to keep constant the surface coverage is not new .",
    "in fact , this strategy has been used in several works related with either kinetic ( for example , in combination with the well - known zgb model , etc ) @xcite or equilibrium phase transitions @xcite .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge this study has not been done for the present model despite its simplicity .    in figure @xmath109",
    "typical curves of the probabilities @xmath110 ( squares ) , @xmath111 ( circles ) and @xmath112 ( triangles ) are shown for two different values of coverage ( @xmath113 , full symbols and @xmath114 , open symbols ) .",
    "for each case ( fixed values of @xmath26 and a given criterion ) , just three different lattice sizes are shown in the figure .",
    "the curves cross each other in a unique point , @xmath57 , which depends on the chosen criterion .",
    "these points do not change their numerical values regardless of the used coverage .",
    "these findings encourage for considering a finite - size scaling analysis with the temperature as independent variable by following the same rules as in section [ fss ] where the percolation probability was calculated as a function of coverage .",
    "thus , for each curve , @xmath115 is determined by least mean - square fitting .",
    "an extrapolation of @xmath115 towards the limit @xmath33 by using the scaling hypothesis can be argued as    @xmath116    where @xmath63 is the critical exponent associated with the correlation length and @xmath117 is a constant for each criterion used .",
    "equation ( [ extrapolation01 ] ) is supported by numerical results as is shown in figure @xmath118 for surface coverage @xmath119 as an illustrative example .",
    "thus , all the curves ( different criteria ) are well correlated by a linear function with a quite similar value for the ordinate in the limit @xmath69 .",
    "it is important to emphasize that @xmath120 is almost independent of the lattice size .",
    "therefore , the crossing points ( figure @xmath109 ) are located at very well - defined values in the @xmath29-axes determining the critical percolation threshold for each coverage .    by using standard finite - size scaling ,",
    "it is possible to determine the critical exponent @xmath63 which results to be equal to @xmath121 regardless of the value of @xmath26 considered as both ( a ) in the case of random percolation and ( b ) in section [ fss ] .    as a consequence of the above results , it is possible to collapse all the curves in figure @xmath109 onto a single one for each coverage when",
    "@xmath122 is plotted as a function of @xmath123 . as an example , we plot @xmath124 as a function of @xmath125 for the surface coverage @xmath126 in figure @xmath127 , giving an additional indication for the calculated numerical value of the critical exponent @xmath63 . the same procedure described above",
    "was realized for different concentrations .",
    "this fact demonstrates that the scaling function depends not only on the variable @xmath29 but also on the coverage .",
    "thus , for determining the dependence of @xmath78 with @xmath29 , the main features of the collapsing data must be considered : the curves become steeper upon increasing the coverage .",
    "in fact , the derivative of the function @xmath78 with respect to @xmath125 behaves as a gaussian - like function .",
    "thus , we can observe the following facts : the derivatives ( a ) become more pronounced and ( b ) are narrowed as the coverage increases .",
    "the latter is the most important finding where one wishes to find the appropriate parametric factors in order to collapse all the curves , for different values of @xmath26 , into a single universal curve for each criterion .",
    "such behaviour can also be described by a power law according to    @xmath128    where @xmath129 is the standard deviation of @xmath130 .    according to the above equations",
    ", a metric factor might be included in the scaling function in order to collapse all the curves onto a single one for each criterion . in figure",
    "@xmath131 we plot the probability @xmath132 as a function of the argument @xmath133 .",
    "as is clearly observed , all the curves collapse onto a single one for each used criterion .",
    "this fact allows us to determine the numerical value of the parameter @xmath134 which results to be equal to @xmath135 regardless of the criterion used .",
    "the curves nicely collapse in the close vicinity of @xmath136 ( close to the critical point ) and a tiny deviation is observed as @xmath137 increases . the scaling analysis given above should be rigorously valid only for sufficiently large @xmath43 and from @xmath1 in the asymptotic critical regime .",
    "however , it can be applied to the entire range of @xmath43 and @xmath1 if the data fall in the ` domain of attraction ' of a simple fixed point characterizing only one universality class of critical phenomena .",
    "it is remarkable that more than @xmath93 points are included in the collapsing curve .",
    "the metric factor introduced here , @xmath138 , gives an additional indication for the numerical value of the exponent @xmath134 obtained by using equation ( [ sca4 ] ) .",
    "we presented a model to investigate the process of adsorption of interacting monomers on a square lattice and studied the percolating properties of the adsorbed phase . by using monte carlo simulation and finite - size scaling theory",
    ", we obtained the percolation thresholds for different values of concentration and temperature . from this analysis , a critical curve in the @xmath139 space",
    "was addressed .",
    "the coexistence line , separating the percolating and nonpercolating regions , is characterized by three regimes : ( 1 ) for @xmath140 , @xmath59 remains constant ( @xmath106 ) as @xmath29 is decreased ; ( 2 ) from @xmath100 up to @xmath101 , @xmath59 increases almost linearly with @xmath29 and ( 3 ) for @xmath103 , @xmath59 remains constant ( @xmath141 ) as @xmath29 is increased .",
    "each point in the critical curve was corroborated by following an alternative scheme : the surface coverage can be kept constant while the reduced temperature , @xmath29 , is varied .",
    "this study does not constitute the ` standard ' procedure for calculating percolation properties . the results in this paper show that the new technique seems to be a promising method for describing the percolation behaviour of adlayer at equilibrium or what we called thermal percolation .    in all considered cases",
