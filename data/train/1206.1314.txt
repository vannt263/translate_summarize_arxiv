    "2011 ) have indicated that the cosmic ccsn rate might not match the massive star formation rate ( sfr ) even in the local universe .",
    "this could be caused by a population of sne remaining undetected by the current optical searches either because they are intrinsically faint , or dark due to large host galaxy extinctions ( e.g. , horiuchi et al . 2011 ) .",
    "also , sne with lower extinctions but occurring within a few hundred parsecs of an lirg nucleus would likely be detectable only by observations with a high spatial resolution ( e.g. , kankare et al .",
    "2012 ) typically not available for the current sn searches .",
    "more recently , botticella et al . (",
    "2012 ) used a sample of 14 ccsne within the 11 mpc volume to derive a robust lower limit for the local ccsn rate .",
    "they found the volumetric ccsn rate to be consistent with that expected from the sfr derived from far - uv luminosities and higher than expected based on h@xmath13 luminosities .",
    "this indicates that most of the intrinsically faint and/or dark events were detected in their local sample .",
    "the fraction of missing sne as a function of redshift has been studied before by mannucci et al .",
    "they compiled the star formation densities for different redshifts derived from uv and ir observations .",
    "they used these results together with their own estimates on how many sne are lost due to obscuration by dust in local starburst galaxies , lirgs and ulirgs to derive a correction for sn rates at high redshifts .",
    "these estimates , however , were based on a very small number of sne detected in such galaxies by that time ( maiolino et al .",
    "2002 ; mannucci et al . 2003 ) .",
    "also , at that time , very little was known about the nature of the high redshift lirgs and ulirgs . the assumption made in mannucci et al .",
    "( 2007 ) was that they were the same kind of systems as in the local universe , which was not an unreasonable assumption .",
    "however , later developments , in particular the recent results from @xmath14 and @xmath15 , have shown that the high - redshift u / lirg population is dominated by disk galaxies forming stars in the normal extended ( the so called main sequence ) mode rather than in compact starbursts as observed in the local u / lirgs ( e.g. , elbaz et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "in this investigation we use a somewhat similar approach to that of mannucci et al .",
    "( 2007 ) to estimate the corrections needed in order to account for ccsne remaining undetected by optical surveys both locally and as a function of redshift .",
    "our corrections consist of two parts .",
    "first , we estimate the fraction of ccsne in normal galaxies with substantially higher host galaxy extinctions than predicted by simple models for the smooth dust distribution and the resulting inclination effects .",
    "thereafter , we estimate the fraction of ccsne missed in local u / lirgs . for this",
    "we make use of the rich sn population of one of the nearest lirgs , arp 299 . assuming that the sne with the highest host galaxy extinctions are missed by the optical searches and not compensated for by the standard extinction corrections",
    ", we can derive the fraction of sne that remain missing and estimate the corrections needed to be applied when deriving ccsn rates .",
    "we then use this information together with the latest knowledge of the nature and evolution of high-@xmath0 u / lirgs to calculate the fraction of ccsne missed as a function of redshift .",
    "we assume h@xmath16 = 70 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 , @xmath17 = 0.7 , and @xmath18 = 0.3 throughout the paper .",
    "in order to investigate the completeness of the current local optical sn searches at different distances we selected all the sne discovered by the end of 2011 and after the beginning of the year 2000 from the asiago sn catalog ( barbon et al .",
    "1999 ) with an identified host galaxy and v@xmath19 @xmath10 1500 km s@xmath4 ( corresponding to distances less than @xmath120 mpc ) .",
    "we then adopted their radial velocities corrected for the peculiar velocities due to virgo infall from the hyperleda database ( paturel et al .",
    "2003 ) and converted to distances .",
    "we ended - up with a sample of 100 objects including also a few events without a spectroscopic classification , type ia s and luminous blue variable ( lbv ) outbursts originally classified as sne .",
    "we then investigated the volumetric rate of these transients within different distances over the 12 yr period .",
    "a significantly higher rate was found at the smallest distances of @xmath14 - 6 mpc indicative of the local overdensity of star formation ( see the discussion below ) .",
    "the rate was found to stay roughly constant between @xmath112 and @xmath115 mpc and then show a significant decline .",
    "the drop of the rate at distances greater than @xmath115 mpc could be a result of the sn searches starting to miss a significant fraction of both the intrinsically faint and heavily dust - obscured events after this point ( see also botticella et al .",

    "recent optical observations of the sn 2008s site ( szczygiel et al .",

    "kochanek ( 2011 ) predicts that the shock powering the current ir luminosity from the site of sn 2008s should destroy the dust , eventually allowing a direct confirmation if the progenitor of sn 2008s has disappeared . with the origin of the sn 2008s - like events still an open question , we decided to exclude them from our current analysis .",
    "we note that the sn 2008s - like events were also excluded by botticella et al .",
    "( 2012 ) from their ccsn rate analysis .",

    "the fraction of ccsne occurring in such low luminosity / metallicity galaxies is very low ; @xmath102% according to young et al .",
    ". therefore , such events missed by optical pointed sn searches locally are not likely to contribute significantly to the fraction of ccsne missed by optical sn searches in general .",
    "the adopted host galaxy distances are mostly the kinematic distances obtained from the virgo infall corrected recession velocities . however , for several of the closest galaxies , more accurate distances were available from cepheid observations or from the tip of the red giant branch ( trgb ) method which were adopted instead . in a few cases the mean distance from several methods was adopted from the literature .",

    "2003 ) scaled to our adopted distances .",
    "the volumetric ccsn rates obtained using the events from table 1 are listed in table 2 .",
    "we adopt the small number statistical uncertainties from gehrels ( 1986 ) and use these throughout this study . excluding the sn 2008s - like events there are a total of eight ccsne within 6 mpc , and the ccsn rate within 6",

    "( 2012 ) , and that expected from the sfr extrapolated from high-@xmath0 and even the locally normalized horiuchi sfr .",
    "however , such an elevated ccsn rate is consistent with a local overdensity of star formation observed within @xmath110 mpc ( e.g. , karachentsev et al . 2004 ) .",
    "furthermore , according to heckman ( 1998 ) only four galaxies ( m 82 , ngc 253 , m 83 and ngc 4945 ) are responsible for 25% of all the high - mass ( @xmath41 8 m@xmath24 ) star formation within 10 mpc distance .",

    "so , there are only five host galaxies within 6 mpc that are responsible for all eight events over the last 12 yr within this volume .",
    "also , it is possible that the sfr within 6 mpc is actually concentrated in more dusty systems such as the prototypical starburst galaxy m 82 , and , therefore , the missing fraction of sne within this volume might be higher than representative for the local volume .    in order to avoid the effects of overdensity , we calculated the volumetric ccsn rates after excluding the volume within 6 mpc .",
    "these rates are listed in table 2 for different outer limits of the volume .",
    "we note that between 10 and 15 mpc this volumetric ccsn rate stays constant within statistical uncertainties indicating that within 15 mpc we are not missing a significant number of events .",
    "the volumetric ccsn rate at 6 - 15 mpc is 1.5 @xmath2 @xmath39 10@xmath40 yr@xmath4 mpc@xmath5 , which is similar to the volumetric ccsn rate recently derived by botticella et al .",
    "( 2012 ) for a similar sample of ccsne within 11 mpc ( the 14 events used by botticella et al . are indicated in column 11 of table 1 ) .",

    "for all the sne within 12 mpc except sn 2005at host galaxy extinctions were available in the literature ( for references see column 7 of table 1 ) .",
    "we note that these extinctions were estimated for each sn , not for each galaxy as a whole .",
    "therefore , here we concentrate on the ccsne within 12 mpc which is almost identical to the distance limit in the sample of botticella et al .",
    "( 2012 ) when accounting for the difference in the value of @xmath42 adopted in the two studies .",

    "we use these data to estimate a host galaxy extinction of @xmath44 = 2.3 @xmath30 0.3 for sn 2005at by comparison with well observed normal type ic events .    in table 3",

    "we include the 18 ccsne from table 1 , excluding the sn 2008s - like events whose origin is still an open question .",
    "these simulations follow the recipe in riello & patat ( 2005 ) , assuming a homogeneous dust distribution for the model host galaxy with the bulge - to - total ( @xmath45 ) ratio = 0.0 ( 100% of the sne located in the disk ) and an optical depth through a simulated face - on galaxy at a zero radius of @xmath46(0 ) = 2.5 , consistent with many statistical studies ( e.g. , kankare et al .",
    "2009 ) , to derive a distribution of expected @xmath47 values .",
    "for the purpose of comparing observed and predicted extinction values , we divided our sample into three inclination bins .",
    "the host galaxy inclinations were adopted from the hyperleda database .",
    "first , we compare the observed fraction of ccsne in different inclination bins with the predictions from the simulations ( see columns 7 and 11 in table 3 ) .",
    "the relative distribution of sne in galaxies with inclinations of 0 - 30@xmath23 and 30 - 60@xmath23 appears to be as expected whereas there is an apparent lack of sne in host galaxies with an inclinations higher than 60@xmath23 . although half of the sne would be expected in galaxies with inclination of 61 - 90@xmath23 , less than 30% were discovered in such galaxies . in the edge - on bin @xmath110% of the sne",
    "have a simulated extinction of @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , we do expect a fraction of the sne to be missed in normal galaxies with the highest inclinations .",
    "however , the expected median extinction of objects in the edge - on bin is @xmath10.6 in @xmath44 , which means that the optical sn searches should have been sensitive to most of the sne even in the edge - on galaxies within the 12 mpc volume .",
    "therefore , the apparent lack of events in the edge - on bin appears to be more likely due to the selection effect of the sn searches avoiding these galaxies rather than being a consequence of the host galaxy extinction .",
    "the fact that there is an apparent lack of ccsne with edge - on host galaxies indicates that our sn sample within 12 mpc ( and the one used by botticella et al .",

    "our estimated ccsn rate is significantly higher than the volumetric ccsn rate from the loss ( li et al .",
    "2011a ) of 0.84 @xmath30 0.18 @xmath3 yr@xmath4 mpc@xmath5 ( scaled to correspond to @xmath42 = 70 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 ) .",
    "if applying our newly derived missing sn fraction correction the volumetric rate of loss would become 1.04 @xmath30 0.22 @xmath3  yr@xmath4  mpc@xmath5 or 1.35 @xmath30 0.29 @xmath3  yr@xmath4  mpc@xmath5 if adopting the `` high missing fraction '' model .",
    "therefore , within the uncertainties in the missing sn fraction correction , this is consistent with our ccsn rate estimate within 6 - 15 mpc .",
    "we note that loss made use of their observed luminosity functions of sne to compensate for the effects of host galaxy extinction for their derived sn rates .",

    "we have adopted the salpeter imf , which has also been used for deriving the sfrs .",
    "we also note that calculating the ccsn rate in the very nearby universe within a distance of @xmath124  mpc , we find a significant increase in the rate by a factor @xmath15 compared to the rate found within 6 - 15 mpc , caused by a few galaxies that have each hosted multiple sne .",
    "this further supports the suggestion of a significant local overdensity in the sfr within @xmath110 mpc ( e.g. , karachentsev et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "horiuchi et al . ( 2011 ) note that local and low - redshift ccsn rates published before 2011 , are lower compared to those expected from the sfr by a factor @xmath12 at a 2@xmath50  confidence . as a solution to this discrepancy , they suggested that there could be a population of faint ccsne ( @xmath125 ) that are typically missed by sn surveys or that there could be a population of sne hidden by dust , or a combination of these two effects . using their sample of ccsne a distance of within 11 mpc , botticella et al .",
    "( 2012 ) did a detailed comparison with the local sfrs and found their ccsn rate to be consistent with that expected from the sfr derived from far - uv luminosities and higher than expected based on h@xmath13 luminosities . in our ccsn sample within 12 mpc , there are no ccsne fainter than @xmath55 @xmath1 -15 and roughly 20% fainter than @xmath55 @xmath1 -15.5 .",
    "these intrinsically faint events are more likely to be missed in sn searches over a larger volume compared to our @xmath56  mpc sample and could therefore lead to underestimates of the ccsn rate .",
    "even if such events at the peak would be above the magnitude limit of the survey , the time on the light curve they spend above the limiting magnitude of the search is shorter for this population and unless accounted for , will lead to an underestimate of the rates .",

    "<S> we estimate the fraction of core - collapse supernovae ( ccsne ) that remain undetected by optical sn searches due to obscuration by large amounts of dust in their host galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> this effect is especially important in luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies , which are locally rare but dominate the star formation at redshifts of @xmath0 @xmath1 1 - 2 . </S>",
    "<S> we perform a detailed investigation of the sn activity in the nearby luminous infrared galaxy arp  299 and estimate that up to 83% of the sne in arp  299 and in similar galaxies in the local universe are missed by observations at optical wavelengths . for rest - frame optical surveys </S>",
    "<S> we find the fraction of sne missed due to high dust extinction to increase from the average local value of @xmath119% to @xmath138% at @xmath0 @xmath1 1.2 and then stay roughly constant up to @xmath0 @xmath1 2 . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore crucial to take into account the effects of obscuration by dust when determining sn rates at high redshift and when predicting the number of ccsne detectable by future high-@xmath0 surveys such as lsst , jwst , and euclid . for a sample of nearby ccsne ( distances 6 - 15 mpc ) detected during the last 12 yr </S>",
    "<S> , we find a lower limit for the local ccsn rate of 1.5@xmath2 @xmath3 yr@xmath4mpc@xmath5 , consistent with that expected from the star formation rate . </S>",
    "<S> even closer , at distances less than @xmath16 mpc , we find a significant increase in the ccsn rate , indicating a local overdensity of star formation caused by a small number of galaxies that have each hosted multiple sne . </S>"
