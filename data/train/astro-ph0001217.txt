    "<S> we used three indicators of massive star formation : @xmath0 , fir and non - thermal radio luminosities , to compare estimations of star formation rate ( sfr ) for the sample of 34 spiral galaxies . to adjust sfr values , </S>",
    "<S> obtained from different indicators , we considered the slope @xmath1 and/or upper mass limit @xmath2 of initial mass function ( imf ) as free parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the best agreement between these indicators reaches for @xmath3 and @xmath4 in the high mass end of imf ( @xmath5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> parallel with sfr we also estimated fir excess @xmath6 defined as a fraction of the observed fir which is not related to young massive stars directly . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath6 is found to be well correlated with types of spiral galaxies and their colors ( b - v ) : the redder a galaxy the higher is its fir excess . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that for any parameters of imf the observed fir flux of early type spiral galaxies needs the additional source of energy but the massive star radiation .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the most important quantitative of ongoing star formation is star formation rate ( sfr ) defined as a total mass of stars in a time unit . </S>",
    "<S> young stars reveal themselves in different spectral bands which allows us to determine sfr using luminosity of a galaxy in selected spectral bands or lines . </S>",
    "<S> one can evaluate sfr using luminosity of galaxies in emission line , far infrared continuum ( fir ) and in radiocontinuum based on the model results ( see review by condon , 1992 ) . </S>",
    "<S> these indicators are sensitive to the presence of massive stars and hence they bear information about current sfr on scales less than @xmath7 yrs </S>",
    "<S> .    comparison of sfr values obtained from different indicators enables to constrain some model parameters , such as present day initial stellar mass function ( imf ) and to make some conclusions about the applicability of the sfr indicators in galaxies of different types .    </S>",
    "<S> ultraviolet radiation from o and b stars is the source of luminosity of galaxies @xmath8 in emission line @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> following kennicutt ( 1983 ) , and dopita , ryder ( 1994 ) , we use the equation @xmath10    here @xmath11 is imf , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are @xmath9 luminosity and lifetime of stars of mass @xmath14 . to estimate these values the analytical approximation from dopita , ryder ( 1994 ) </S>",
    "<S> is used :    this approach is sensitive to the extinction of @xmath9 inside of galaxies . according to israel , kennicutt ( 1980 ) , kennucutt ( 1983 ) , devereux , scowen ( 1994 ) , devereux et al . </S>",

    "<S> fir flux is the most sensitive to the presence of stars with mass of order of several @xmath17 . according to thronson , telesco ( 1986 ) @xmath18    where @xmath19 - is a fraction of ionizing radiation absorbed by the dust </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath20 is a time which a star spends in a dusty star forming region . </S>",
    "<S> we assume it to be @xmath21 yrs or @xmath13 if the lifetime is shorter . </S>",
    "<S> l(m ) is bolometric luminosity for stars of main sequence taken from mas - hesse , kunth ( 1991 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> synchrotron radio flux may be considered as a third indicator of star formation in galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> one can separate non - thermal and thermal components due to different slopes of their spectra </S>",
    "<S> . a thermal component at the frequency @xmath22 contributes a fraction of total luminosity @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the slope of synchrotron spectra ( condon , 1992 ) .    following condon ( 1992 ) we use following equation which connects non - thermal luminosity of galaxy @xmath25 at frequency range @xmath26 0.408  5 ghz with sfr based on calibration from sn ib , ii rate for our galaxy ( condon , yin , 1990 , xu et al . , 1994 ) . </S>",
