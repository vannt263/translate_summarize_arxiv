    "the variations in the integrated properties of the interstellar medium ( ism ) and integrated star formation activity along the hubble sequence is clearly defined . @xcite and references",
    "therein have shown that the total gas surface density and the ratio of gas mass to total mass increases when proceeding along the hubble sequence from elliptical galaxies through early - type spiral galaxies ( galaxies with large bulges and tightly - wound arms ) to late - type spiral galaxies ( galaxies with small or negligible bulges and loosely - wound arms ) . @xcite and",
    "references therein have used various tracers of star formation normalized by total stellar content to establish the general increase in star formation activity when proceeding from elliptical galaxies to late - type spiral galaxies along the hubble sequence .",
    "moreover , all of these trends show significant differences in the interstellar content and star formation activity between early- and late - type spiral galaxies .",
    "however , few investigations have carefully studied whether the spatial distribution of the ism or star formation varies among spiral galaxies , particularly between sa and sd galaxies .",
    "@xcite show that the radial distributions of hii regions are broader in late - type than in early - type spiral galaxies , but their sample only contains 37 galaxies and includes no galaxies earlier than sb . later h@xmath1 surveys appear to contradict these results ; a larger h@xmath1 survey by @xcite found no variations in the radial extent of the h@xmath1 emission normalized by the spatial extent of the i - band emission , and another h@xmath1 survey by @xcite found no variations in the ratio of the h@xmath1/r - band scale lengths . @xcite and",
    "@xcite did demonstrate that the dust emission was more extended in late - type spiral galaxies than in early - type spiral galaxies , but the data in @xcite did not include all of the galaxy emission , and the sample in @xcite contained very few galaxies with hubble types earlier than sb .",
    "@xcite qualitatively show a similar variation in the non - stellar 8.0  @xmath0 m morphology of galaxies across the hubble sequence but did not apply a quantitative analysis .",
    "@xcite did demonstrate strong variations in the co emission across the hubble sequence , but the observations consisted mostly of a series of single low - resolution pointed observations along the major axes of the target galaxies . in contrast to these other observations , @xcite observed that the spatial extent of hi emission did not vary with hubble type , at least between sb and sd galaxies .",
    "variations in the distribution of the ism and star formation among spiral galaxies could have fundamental implications for the stellar evolution and the evolution of structure within galaxies .",
    "moreover , such variations may provide clues to the processes that form galaxies disks and bulges .",
    "for example , if the ism is more centrally concentrated in early - type spiral galaxies than in late - type spiral galaxies , this may point to merger phenomena as having formed the bulges of early - type spiral galaxies and causing gas to fall into the galaxies nuclei ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or it may indicate that the centres of early - type galaxies contain pseudobulges , which form through secular processes that funnel gas into the nuclei and trigger nuclear star formation activity ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . also note that the distribution of dust emission may be related to other galaxy properties .",
    "for example , @xcite demonstrated that the clumpiness and central concentration of 24  @xmath0 m emission was linked to the dust temperatures and the ratio of infrared to ultraviolet luminosity .",
    "links between the distribution of dust and galaxy morphology may therefore have implications for how other galaxy properties vary along the hubble sequence as well .",
    "the _ spitzer _ infrared nearby galaxies survey ( sings ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) recently completed mid- and far - infrared observations of nearby galaxies that represent a cross section of galaxies with different hubble types , luminosities , and infrared / optical ratios .",
    "additionally , this survey detected many serendipitous sources , including nearby galaxies not included in the sings sample .",
    "in this paper , we use the 24  @xmath0 m _ spitzer _ data to understand how the distribution of this component of dust emission varies among nearby galaxies . for comparison with stellar morphologies ,",
    "we also examine the morphologies in the 3.6  @xmath0 m images , which trace stellar emission that mostly originates from evolved stellar populations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in general , infrared dust emission can be used as an approximate tracer of both star formation and interstellar dust mass .",
    "technically , dust emission represents the fraction of the total stellar radiation that is absorbed by dust .",
    "however , since hot young stars frequently produce a significant fraction of the total bolometric luminosity within star formation regions and since dust is concentrated near star formation regions , dust emission is an effective star formation tracer .",
    "this has been demonstrated recently with comparisons between _ spitzer space telescope _ 8 - 160  @xmath0 m data and h@xmath1 or ultraviolet emission in nearby galaxies including m  81 @xcite and m  51 @xcite . the 24  @xmath0 m wave band , which originated from both transiently - heated very small grain and grains that are in thermal equilibrium at @xmath2  k , appears to be the best star formation tracer of all the irac and mips bands .",
    "while the 24  @xmath0 m band is particularly sensitive to dust heating @xcite and may therefore be less than ideal for tracing dust mass , the high spatial resolution ( 6  arcsec ) and signal - to - noise ratios in the 24  @xmath0 m data are superior to any other mid- or far - infrared data available from _ spitzer _ or elsewhere .",
    "the 24  @xmath0 m data are therefore the best data available at this time for studying the spatial distribution of dust in nearby galaxies .",
    "note that the 24  @xmath0 m emission may not trace star formation very well in some dwarf galaxies with stochastic star formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and active galactic nuclei may be responsible for significant amounts of dust heating in the nuclei of some galaxies ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* for an extreme example ) , but the 24  @xmath0 m emission can still provide some information on star formation even in these cases .    in section  [ s_data ] , we discuss the sample used for the analysis , the _ spitzer _",
    "observations with the infrared array camera ( irac ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the multiband imaging photometer for _ spitzer _ ( mips ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the data reduction and the parameterization of the morphologies of the target galaxies .",
    "we rely on the morphological parameters defined by @xcite and @xcite as well as the half - light radius of the 24  @xmath0 m emission normalized by optical radius to study the morphologies . in section  [ s_test ]",
    ", we examine the effects of distance and inclination angle on these parameters , and we derive corrections for dealing with these effects where necessary . in section  [ s_morphparam_ttrend ] ,",
    "we study how the morphological parameters vary along the hubble sequence , with particular emphasis placed on searching for variation in morphology from s0/a - sab through to sc - scd spiral galaxies , and we also select galaxies with representative or peculiar 24  @xmath0 m morphologies for their hubble types .",
    "we briefly compare the 24  @xmath0 m morphologies of barred and unbarred spiral galaxies in section  [ s_morphparam_bar ] .",
    "we then discuss in section  [ s_discuss ] how the results compare to previous studies of the ism and optical morphologies and what the implications are for interpreting the hubble sequence .",
    "a summary of the results is presented in section  [ s_conclusions ] .",
    ".basic properties of the sample galaxies from sings [ t_sample_sings ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     @xmath3 this is the probability that the tested parameter for the sa and sb data have the same distribution .",
    "a probability of @xmath4 is interpreted as having the same significance as a @xmath5 difference between the median values for the s0/a - sab and sc - sd galaxies .",
    "+ @xmath6 the k - s test results are not meaningful unless each dataset contains at least four values .",
    "the k - s test would compare a set of 4 values to a set of 2 values in this particular case , so these probabilities would have no meaningful interpretation and are not reported here .",
    "these results generally demonstrate a difference between sa and sb galaxies , with sb galaxies having more centrally concentrated 24  @xmath0 m emission as seen in higher @xmath7 , lower @xmath8 , and lower @xmath9 parameters and more emission located in peaks as seen in the higher @xmath10 parameter",
    ". however , the trends are only significant at the @xmath5 level when all spiral galaxies ( all s0/a - sd galaxies ) are used in the analysis .",
    "since the sa galaxies for this sample tend to be a slightly later type than the sb galaxies for this sample , the results from comparing all unbarred spiral galaxies to all barred spiral galaxies may be partly biased by trends along the hubble sequence ( although @xmath10 should exhibit this bias ) .",
    "when subsets of spiral galaxies ( only s0/a - sab , only sb - sbc , or only sc - sd galaxies ) are examined , sa galaxies may still be differentiated from sb galaxies , but the results are not as statistically significant . unfortunately ,",
    "when the galaxies in this sample are divided according to both hubble type and bar type , the resulting subsets are relatively small ; all subsets contain fewer than 10 galaxies , and some subsets contain fewer than 5 galaxies .",
    "we conclude that bars may play a role in changing the 24  @xmath0 m morphologies of nearby galaxies , which would be consistent with previous observations of barred spiral galaxies , but that a larger sample of spiral galaxies is needed to examine these trends in more detail .",
    "although the analysis is not entirely conclusive in detecting differences between barred and unbarred galaxies , we note that the results do show differences between barred and unbarred galaxies in both the early - type spiral galaxy subset and the late - type spiral galaxy subset .",
    "most recent observations show that bars only enhance nuclear star formation activity in early - type spiral galaxies @xcite , which implies that bars should only affect the 24  @xmath0 m morphologies of early - type spiral galaxies .",
    "however , we should emphasize that comparing the 24  @xmath0 m morphological parameters to measurements of nuclear star formation activity may not be appropriate .",
    "although the 24  @xmath0 m morphologies show that the distribution of star formation itself changes , it can not be used to show changes in the relative strength of star formation activity ( i.e. the ratio of current to past star formation activity , or the star formation activity per unit total stellar mass ) .",
    "a comparison of the morphological parameters to measurements of the relative star formation activity is needed to better understand the trends shown by the morphological parameters .",
    "we compared the 24  @xmath0 m morphological parameters for the data in table  [ t_param24 ] to the data for 3.6  @xmath0 m morphological parameters in table  [ t_paramirac1 ] and to the r - band morphological parameters given in @xcite .",
    "in general , the 24  @xmath0 m parameters differ significantly from the 3.6  @xmath0 m and r - band parameters . for an individual hubble type , the 24",
    "@xmath0 m emission appears more extended then the 3.6  @xmath0 m or r - band emission , as seen by the lower @xmath7 , higher @xmath8 , and higher @xmath11 parameters .",
    "the 24  @xmath0 m emission also appears more asymmetric , as indicated by the higher @xmath12 parameters , and more of the 24  @xmath0 m emission appears to originate in one or a few bright peaks , as exhibited by the higher @xmath10 parameter .",
    "( note , however , that the 3.6  @xmath0 m @xmath7 and @xmath12 parameters in table  [ t_paramirac1 ] are comparable to the same r - band parameters given by @xcite . )    in figure  [ f_paramcomp ] , we show comparisons of the morphological parameters to each other that may be directly compared with figure  15 in @xcite and figures  10 - 14 in @xcite . the parameter space occupied by the 3.6  @xmath0 m sings data is similar to the parameter space occupied by the r - band data in conselice and lotz et al .",
    "this is expected , as both the 3.6  @xmath0 m wave band and the r - band trace the starlight from all stars within the host galaxies , including evolved red stars .",
    "however , the parameter space occupied by the 24  @xmath0 m morphological parameters for the sings galaxies do not correspond to the same parameter space occupied by the 3.6  @xmath0 m morphology data for the sings galaxies or the r - band morphology data for normal galaxies in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the offset between the 3.6 and 24  @xmath0 m parameters is most easily seen in the plots of @xmath8 versus @xmath10 , @xmath7 versus @xmath10 , and @xmath12 versus @xmath10 .",
    "however , note that the 24  @xmath0 m @xmath7 and @xmath12 parameters for the sings galaxies are comparable to the corresponding r - band parameters for starbursts and mergers in @xcite , and the 24  @xmath0 m data occupy a similar location in parameter space as the r - band data for ulirgs in @xcite .    aside from showing the differences between the distribution of starlight and 24  @xmath0 m emission in nearby galaxies , these results demonstrate that individual wave bands need to be calibrated at rest wavelengths to determine the parameter spaces occupied by both normal and merging galaxies",
    ". it may also be desirable to demonstrate that morphological parameters measured in wave bands that are sensitive to star formation can still be used to separate mergers and starbursts from normal galaxies , especially given that the 24  @xmath0 m morphological parameters for the galaxies in this paper statistically match the r - band morphological parameters for starbursts and ulirgs .    despite the differences in the parameter values between the 24  @xmath0 m wave band and stellar wave bands ,",
    "the 24  @xmath0 m morphological parameters show variations along the hubble sequence that are similar to those seen in the 3.6  @xmath0 m morphological parameters as well as the r - band parameters from @xcite .",
    "the morphological parameters measured in stellar wave bands and at 24  @xmath0 m show that elliptical and early - type spiral galaxies are generally compact and symmetric whereas late - type spiral galaxies are more extended and asymmetric .",
    "moreover , the differences in the 24  @xmath0 m asymmetry between early- and late - type spiral galaxies observed here does resemble the trends in lopsidedness observed in near - infrared observations of nearby galaxies by @xcite .",
    "the @xmath10 parameter is the only parameter where the trends seen at 24  @xmath0 m differ from those seen in stellar wave bands .",
    "slightly more 3.6  @xmath0 m emission appears to originate from one or a few bright peaks in early - type spiral galaxies when compared to late - type spiral galaxies , but the same fraction of 24  @xmath0 m emission is located in bright peaks in both early- and late - type spiral galaxies .",
    "nonetheless , we conclude that the variations in stellar morphologies along the hubble sequence are interrelated with the dust morphologies and implicitly with the morphologies of the ism and the distribution of star formation regions .",
    "the observed trends in the central concentration and spatial extent of the 24  @xmath0 m dust emission along the hubble sequence are similar to those observed at 12 and 60  @xmath0 m by @xcite , at 850  @xmath0 m by @xcite , and at 8  @xmath0 m by @xcite",
    ". however , the results from the analysis in this paper illustrate the trend more robustly than these previous studies ; the analysis in this paper is quantitative instead of qualitative , the images used in this paper completely cover the optical discs of all the galaxies , and the sample in this paper contains several galaxies of each hubble type .",
    "interestingly , the same variations in the spatial distribution of dust emission are found regardless of the wave band used .",
    "this implies that a single wave band can be used to roughly characterize the spatial extent of all the dust emission on global scales , although colour variations within galaxies , such as those observed by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , indicate that a single wave band can not be used to accurately trace the total dust emission on kpc scales .",
    "the weak relationship between morphology and the effective radius of the 24  @xmath0 m emission is similar to the trend observed with molecular gas by @xcite , which demonstrated that molecular gas was found in more central concentrations in early - type galaxies and in wider distributions in sc galaxies .",
    "this shows that , for sa - sc spiral galaxies , variations in the distribution of 24  @xmath0 m emission as a function of morphology are related to the variations in the distribution of molecular gas that fuels star formation .",
    "the similarities of the trends is somewhat surprising , as both 24  @xmath0 m and co emission are expected to trace gas mass in the ism , but the 24  @xmath0 m emission is also expected to be highly sensitive to variations in the illuminating radiation field @xcite .",
    "however , since the 24  @xmath0 m wave band does trace star formation @xcite and since the schmidt law states that star formation is directly related to gas density @xcite , the relation between the distribution of co and 24  @xmath0 m emission does not seem too extraordinary .",
    "however , @xcite found that co was more centrally concentrated in sd and later types of galaxies than in sc galaxies , whereas we find the opposite for dust emission .",
    "the reason for the difference between the young et al . results and our results for sd and later galaxies could be related to three phenomena that would make the co emission too weak to detect outside the centres of the galaxies .",
    "first , the co line emission may be low in regions with low metallicities ( * ? ? ?",
    "second , the ratio of molecular to atomic gas varies as a function of hubble type ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so less molecular gas and hence less co emission may be present .",
    "therefore , the co emission in the late - type galaxies of the young et al .",
    "data may only be detectable in the centres .",
    "the dust emission , however , may be related to the total gas content in these very late - type galaxies and may be less sensitive to metallicity effects , so it will appear more spatially extended than the co emission .",
    "we note that the exponential scale lengths of the hi gas normalized by the optical scale lengths in the sample used by @xcite did not vary with hubble type , although their sample for the hi analysis contained 2 s0-sab galaxies .",
    "nonetheless , these results are contrary to the trends for 24  @xmath0 m dust emission found here and the trends for co and dust emission found elsewhere .",
    "additional studies of hi are needed to further understand how its distribution varies as a function of hubble type and its interrelation with dust emission at different wavelengths .    finally , we observe that the variations in the spatial extent of 24  @xmath0 m emission with hubble type are similar to the variations in the radial distributions of hii regions observed by @xcite . however , the variations we observed in the spatial extent of the 24  @xmath0 m emission with hubble type do not agree with @xcite , who found no such variations in the ratio of the spatial extent of h@xmath1 and i - band emission among early- and late - type cluster spiral galaxies .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy is unclear .",
    "one possibility is that the differences in the spatial distribution of star formation among cluster spiral galaxies are relatively small compared to field spiral galaxies , so the dale et al .",
    "sample , comprised entirely of cluster galaxies , would show no variations in the spatial extent of star formation , whereas the sample here , which contains mostly field galaxies , would show such variations .",
    "the numbers of virgo cluster galaxies in our sample is too small to accurately assess whether the spatial extent of 24  @xmath0 m emission in early- and late - type spiral galaxies is also invariant within clusters .",
    "the observed variations in the spatial extent of the 24  @xmath0 m emission also appear to contradict the results from @xcite , who found no such variations in the h@xmath1/r - band scale lengths among spiral galaxies . because of problems with stellar continuum subtraction , continuum from agn , and dust extinction , koopmann et al . needed to exclude the central regions of the galaxies from their analysis .",
    "the h@xmath1 radial profiles measured by koopmann et al . therefore would not have been able to show variations in the h@xmath1 surface brightnesses in the centres of galaxies among galaxies of different morphologies .",
    "although the 24  @xmath0 m data are affected by agn , they are not as strongly affected by stellar continuum or dust extinction problems , so they may show more accurate variations in the spatial extent of star formation among galaxies of different morphologies .",
    "trends in integrated star formation activity along the hubble sequence have been very well studied .",
    "most observational studies have shown that global star formation varies significantly along the hubble sequence , with star formation per unit stellar mass increasing from e - s0 through to sd galaxies ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "however , these trends appeared to be much weaker when examining the nuclei of spiral galaxies .",
    "the results on the 24  @xmath0 m morphologies here provides additional insights into why the variations are seen primarily in the galaxies discs and how the galaxies morphologies are tied to star formation in the discs .",
    "a number of mechanisms have been proposed for building galaxies with larger bulges or galaxies that appear to have larger bulges .",
    "first , inequal mass merger events may transform smaller galaxies with modest bulge / disc ratios into larger galaxies with much larger bulge / disc ratios ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* sections 5.5 and 5.6 ) .",
    "second , pseudobulges can be formed when bars or other dynamical mechanisms funnel gas into the centres of galaxies @xcite . while not true bulges , these pseudobulges may look like bulges when viewed face - on and may result in galaxies being classified as early - type spiral galaxies .",
    "third , in cluster environments , ram pressure stripping may remove gas from the discs of spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "as the stellar populations evolve , the discs , where star formation is repressed , become fainter compared to the nuclei , where gas is still present and where star formation continues .",
    "such galaxies would appear to have large bulge / disc ratios and would be classified as early - type spiral galaxies or s0 galaxies .    in each of the above scenarios ,",
    "the changes in the distribution of the ism in the galaxies should be very similar .",
    "in the merger scenario , the gas will fall into the centre of the galaxy . in the pseudobulge scenario ,",
    "the dynamical effects that create the pseudobulge also move the ism into the centres of the galaxies . in the ram pressure stripping scenario , the only remaining ism in the galaxies is located in the centres of the galaxies .",
    "overall , all of these mechanisms will make the ism appear more centralized in early - type spiral and s0 galaxies when compared to late - type spiral galaxies .",
    "this is exactly what is seen in the 24  @xmath0 m data presented here .",
    "disc galaxies with large bulges ( s0-sab galaxies ) generally have more centrally concentrated dust emission than disc galaxies with smaller bulges ( sc - sd galaxies ) .",
    "figure  [ f_represent ] and the analysis in section  [ s_morphparam_ttrend ] clearly illustrate this trend . as an additional demonstration of the effects of these evolutionary processes ,",
    "figure  [ f_sabvar ] shows four examples of sab galaxies that have undergone different evolutionary processes .",
    "ngc  4826 , a galaxy that contains counterrotating gas in its disc @xcite , is a good example of an inequal - mass merger remnant .",
    "note the compact , asymmetric structure in the 24  @xmath0 m image .",
    "ngc  4736 is a good example of a galaxy with a pseudobulge @xcite .",
    "although faint spiral arms are present in the outer disc , the nucleus and inner ring are the two most prominent sources of 24  @xmath0 m emission within this galaxy , making it appear very compact .",
    "ngc  4569 , which lies within the virgo cluster , is an example of a galaxy that has undergone ram pressure stripping @xcite .",
    "almost no emission originates from the disc of this galaxy .",
    "although these three galaxies have evolved differently , the end result has been the same : a relatively large optical bulge / disc ratio , and relatively compact 24  @xmath0 m emission .",
    "in contrast to all of these , ngc  3031 is shown as an example of a sab field galaxy with a `` classical '' bulge @xcite that has not evidently undergone a recent merger ( although it is interacting with other nearby galaxies ) .",
    "this galaxy is relatively extended compared to most other s0/a - sab galaxies , and it qualitatively and quantitatively appears similar to many late - type spiral galaxies at 24  @xmath0 m . along with ngc  4725 , it may be representative of a subset of early - type spiral galaxies that do not follow the same trends in 24  @xmath0 m morphology as most other early - type spiral galaxies . hence , the processes that are responsible for creating the real or apparent large bulge - to - disc ratios in many of the early - type spiral galaxies in this sample may not be responsible for the formation of the large bulges in early - type spiral galaxies like ngc  3031 and ngc  4725 .",
    "while acknowledging some exceptions , we may conclude that the distribution of 24  @xmath0 m emission within spiral galaxies is a fundamental property linked to galaxies hubble classification .",
    "the results from the 24  @xmath0 m data might also be indicative of the variations in the distribution of the cool dust or the cool ism ( neutral atomic and molecular hydrogen gas ) .",
    "however , the 24  @xmath0 m emission is affected by dust heating as well as dust mass , so it is imperfect as a tracer of gas or dust mass ; additional research is needed to determine the relation between morphological type and variations in the distribution of other components of the ism .",
    "nonetheless , if the spatial distribution of the 24  @xmath0 m emission is similar to that for cool gas and dust , then the variations observed here demonstrate that the secular processes that increase the real or apparent bulge / disc ratios of disc galaxies also change the distribution of the ism within the galaxies .",
    "the ism in the resulting s0 and early - type spiral galaxies is very centrally concentrated",
    ". denied the fuel needed for star formation , the stellar populations in the discs of early - type spiral galaxies will appear older than in late - type spiral galaxies , contributing to the differences in relative star formation activity summarized by @xcite .",
    "the nuclei of these early - type spiral galaxies , however , will still have the fuel needed for star formation activity , which is why the nuclei of early- and late - type galaxies are difficult to distinguish in terms of star formation activity as discussed by @xcite .",
    "wide variations in the distribution of either star formation or the ism in dwarf galaxies have been observed previously .",
    "for example , @xcite , using optical data , found that star formation complexes were non - uniformly distributed throughout individual dwarf irregular galaxies .",
    "@xcite found that some galaxies have centres that are bluer and more peaked than the centres of other dwarfs , demonstrating that star formation in dwarfs is sometimes centralized and sometimes diffuse .",
    "@xcite have found that h  i was also distributed in an irregular and clumpy distribution .",
    "the large range in the 24  @xmath0 m morphologies of dwarf galaxies found in this paper generally reflects these previous results from the literature .",
    "the general amorphous morphology of the dwarf galaxies reflects the stochastic nature of star formation within these galaxies , as has been noted for some of the individual objects in this sample ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . under these circumstances , dust emission",
    "may no longer be expected to trace star formation well , as extinction may be variable across the galaxies ( * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. ) and large reservoirs of gas and dust not associated with star formation may be present in some galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the main results are as follows :    \\1 .",
    "statistically significant variations are seen in the 24  @xmath0 m morphologies of nearby galaxies , and significant differences are seen between s0/a - sab and sc - sd galaxies .",
    "early - type galaxies generally have symmetrical , centrally concentrated 24  @xmath0 m emission .",
    "late - type galaxies generally have asymmetric , extended 24  @xmath0 m emission .",
    "the variations along the hubble sequence can be attributed to a number of mechanisms that transform late - type galaxies into early - type galaxies , including mergers , pseudobulge formation , and ram - pressure stripping in clusters .",
    "the 24  @xmath0 m morphologies of sdm - im galaxies are quite varied .",
    "some appear to be compact , point - like sources .",
    "others appear to be highly extended and disorganized .",
    "additionally , we noted that some dwarf galaxies were non - detections in one or more mips bands , implying weak or negligible star formation activity .",
    "this basically mirrors other results on the distribution of star formation or the ism in nearby galaxies .",
    "the variability in the 24  @xmath0 m morphologies reflects the stochastic nature of star formation within these galaxies .",
    "bars may make the 24  @xmath0 m morphologies appear more centrally concentrated , thus confirming that bars play a role in enhancing nuclear star formation activity . however , the statistical significance of the results based on this sample are weak .",
    "the trends in the 24  @xmath0 m morphologies along the hubble sequence mirror trends in morphological parameters measured in wave bands dominated by stellar emission .",
    "however , the 24  @xmath0 m morphological parameters appear similar to the r - band morphological parameters for mergers and starbursts .",
    "these results indicate that morphological parameters measured in a wave band sensitive to star formation may not correspond to parameters measured in a wave band that traces older stellar populations .",
    "the trends in the 24  @xmath0 m morphologies along the hubble sequence , including the differences between s0/a - sab and sc - sd galaxies , appear similar to previously - observed trends in dust and molecular gas emission .",
    "however , the trends appear contrary to hi observations of nearby galaxies , which show no variations in the distribution of hi between early- and late - type spiral galaxies .",
    "further observations are needed to understand the variations in the distribution of the multiple constituents of the ism and their interrelation .",
    "the implications of these results are extensive .",
    "any proposed galaxy formation mechanisms that distinguish between early- and late - type galaxies or any proposed mechanisms that transform late - type galaxies into early - type galaxies must account for the variations in the distribution of the star formation .",
    "moreover , models of the star formation histories of nearby galaxies must account for the differences in the location of star formation activity between early- and late - type spiral galaxies .",
    "in other words , valid models of spiral galaxies with large bulges can not be created simply by adding large bulges with old stellar populations to star - forming discs but must account for how the location of star formation varies with the bulge - to - disc ratio .",
    "we also note that the results here demonstrate that research based on infrared observations of one galaxy should be used cautiously .",
    "such studies are able to examine multiwavelength dust emission in more detail and can provide detailed analyses on the nature of the emission .",
    "however , the applicability of the results on dust emission for single galaxies to galaxies of different hubble types may be limited .",
    "at least in terms of the distribution of 24  @xmath0 m emission , some galaxies are not even representative of galaxies with similar hubble types .",
    "the distribution of 24  @xmath0 m emission in ngc  3031 , for example , can not be treated as representative of all sab galaxies , and ngc  6946 is not representative of all scd galaxies . if other galaxy properties are linked to the spatial extent of the dust emission or at least the 24  @xmath0 m emission ( as suggested by * ? ? ?",
    "* , for example ) , then studies of individual objects like ngc  3031 and ngc  6946 might not be applicable to galaxies with similar hubble types .",
    "while the sample used in this work was adequate for uncovering morphological differences among nearby galaxies , a much larger sample would provide more statistically robust results and may also provide additional insights as to the circumstances where exceptions from morphological trends occur .",
    "an unbiased sample , such as a distance - limited sample , may also produce more robust results than the sample used here , as explained in section  [ s_data_sample ] . additionally , larger samples of both field and cluster galaxies may demonstrate the extent to which interactions within clusters , particularly ram - pressure stripping , alter the distribution of dust emission or star formation within galaxies .",
    "we would like to acknowledge d. hollenbach and the reviewer for their helpful comments . support for this work , part of the spitzer space telescope legacy science program ,",
    "was provided by nasa through contract 1224769 issued by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology under nasa contract 1407 .",
    "to find the central position for calculating @xmath8 and a , we adapted some of the procedures used by @xcite . to measure the @xmath8 , they recommend shifting the centre position for measuring radius until @xmath13 is minimised . to measure a , they recommend shifting the centre of rotation for the rotated image .",
    "we measured @xmath8 and a after shifting the centre positions to a series of locations within a @xmath14 grid , with the centre of the grid corresponding to the central position given in rc3 and the grid positions spaced by 0.5 pixels ( 0.75  arcsec ) to a maximum distance of 3 pixels ( 4.5  arcsec ) from the rc3 position .",
    "we determined that when @xmath13 or a were minimised for centre positions further than 1  pixel ( 1.5  arcsec ) from the rc3 position and when the corrections to @xmath8 and a were @xmath15% , the objects were inherently asymmetric . in these situations , the positions corresponding to these minima probably are not the centres of the objects but are instead positions where asymmetric structures may have less of an effect on the measured @xmath8 and a. objects where @xmath13 was minimised for centre locations within 1 pixel of the rc3 position and where the change in @xmath8 or a were @xmath15 were compact , off - center sources .",
    "the positions corresponding to these minima are certainly the centres of these objects .    we therefore determined that shifting the centre position away from the position given by rc3 was only appropriate if a minimum was found within 1 pixel .",
    "thus , when @xmath13 or a were minimised when the centre position was shifted up to 1 pixel of the rc3 position , we used that position for measuring @xmath8 or a. however , when @xmath13 or a were minimised when the centre position was shifted further than 1 pixel from the rc3 position , we used the rc3 position itself as the centre position .",

    "<S> to study the distribution of star formation and dust emission within nearby galaxies , we measured five morphological parameters in the 3.6 and 24  @xmath0 m wave bands for 65 galaxies in the _ spitzer _ infrared nearby galaxies survey ( sings ) and 8 galaxies that were serendipitously observed by sings . </S>",
    "<S> the morphological parameters demonstrate strong variations along the hubble sequence , including statistically significant differences between s0/a - sab and sc - sd galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> early - type galaxies are generally found to be compact , centralized , symmetric sources in the 24  @xmath0 m band , while late - type galaxies are generally found to be extended , asymmetric sources . </S>",
    "<S> these results suggest that the processes that increase the real or apparent sizes of galaxies bulges also lead to more centralized 24  @xmath0 m dust emission . </S>",
    "<S> several phenomena , such as strong nuclear star formation , seyfert activity , or outer ring structures , may cause galaxies to deviate from the general morphological trends observed at 24  @xmath0 m . we also note that the 24  @xmath0 m morphologies of sdm - im galaxies are quite varied , with some objects appearing very compact and symmetric while others appear diffuse and asymmetric . </S>",
    "<S> these variations reflect the wide variation in star formation in irregular galaxies as observed at other wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> the variations in the 24  @xmath0 m morphological parameters across the hubble sequence mirror many of the morphological trends seen in other tracers of the ism and in stellar emission . however , the 24  @xmath0 m morphological parameters for the galaxies in this sample do not match the morphological parameters measured in the stellar wave bands . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the distribution of dust emission is related to but not equivalent to the distribution of stellar emission .    </S>",
