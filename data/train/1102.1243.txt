    "spectroscopic tools such as the bragg scattering technique @xcite , the rf - pulse spectrometry @xcite and its @xmath2-resolved improvement @xcite were able to provide a clear - cut evidence for the superfluid nature of the ultracold fermion atom systems .",
    "especially intriguing among the obtained data is the quasiparticle back - bending dispersion near the fermi momentum observed below and above the superfluid transition temperature @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this fact indicates that the bogoliubov - type quasiparticles survive even in a normal state where the long - range coherence between fermion pairs does no longer exist .",
    "similar fingerprints of the dispersive bogoliubov quasiparticles have been previously detected above @xmath0 also in the underdoped cuprate superconductors by the measurements of arpes @xcite and the fourier - transformed stm @xcite .",
    "they confirmed expectations motivated by the uemura scaling @xmath3 @xcite and later on supported by the residual meissner rigidity seen above @xmath0 in the tera - hertz @xcite and the torque magnetometry @xcite experiments .",
    "superconducting transition of the underdoped cuprates seems hence to be controlled not by the pair - formation but rather by onset of the phase coherence .",
    "this point is however still a controversial issue .    in the present work we consider the spectroscopic bogoliubov features common above @xmath0 for the ultracold fermion gases and underdoped cuprate materials taking into account the short - range correlations driven by preformed fermion pairs .",
    "such problem is currently widely discussed in the literature @xcite ( for a comprehensive discussion see e.g.  @xcite and other references cited therein ) .",
    "we shall present the results obtained for the single particle excitations using the selfenergy motivated by the local solution of the feshbach coupling and also suggested by perturbative studies of the pairing fluctuations @xcite .",
    "we start with analysis of the exact solution for the local feshbach scattering problem .",
    "we next discuss how this result can be cast on the itinerant case .",
    "introducing the phenomenological scattering rate we then try to reproduce the single particle spectra for temperatures corresponding to the experiment of the boulder group @xcite . summarizing our results we point out the problems relevant for future studies .",
    "the momentum - resolved spectroscopic measurements of the boulder group @xcite have been done using @xmath1k atoms equally populated in the hyperfine states @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( we shall denote them symbolically as @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) . by applying magnetic field the atoms",
    "were adiabatically brought to vicinity of the unitary limit , slightly on the bec side @xmath8 . under such conditions energies of the atoms",
    "are nearly degenerate with the weakly bound molecular configurations .",
    "the single atoms and molecules are there strongly scattered from each other through the conversion processes .    at a given position @xmath9 in the magneto - optical trap",
    "such feshbach resonant interactions can be described by the following local hamiltonian @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the @xmath12-wave channel scattering strength , @xmath13 are fermion operators of the single atoms in two hyperfine states @xmath14=@xmath15 , @xmath16 and operators @xmath17 correspond to the molecular state .",
    "spatial variation of the energies @xmath18 , @xmath19 comes from the trapping potential and usually take the parabolic dependence with some characteristic radial and axial frequencies .",
    "hilbert space of the local hamiltonian ( [ andreev ] ) is spanned by four fermion configurations @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and two molecular ones @xmath24 , @xmath25 - altogether 8 states . six of these states @xmath26 are eigenfunctions of ( [ andreev ] ) and two vectors @xmath27 and @xmath28 get mixed by the feshbach interaction . with the suitable unitary transformation we can determine the true eigenfunctions @xmath29 where @xmath30 $ ] and",
    "the eigenvalues are given by @xmath31 .",
    "the equations ( [ a],[b ] ) are reminiscent of the bogoliubov - valatin transformation of the standard bcs problem , where true quasiparticles are represented by linear combinations of the particle and hole states . in our present case the additional degree of freedom related to the molecular state causes qualitative differences discussed below .    using the spectral lehmann representation",
    "we can exactly determine the single particle green s function @xmath32 .",
    "its fourier transform takes the three - pole structure @xmath33   \\left ( \\frac{u^{2}}{i\\omega_{n}\\!-\\!\\varepsilon_{+ } } +    \\frac{v^{2}}{i\\omega_{n}\\!-\\!\\varepsilon_{- } } \\right ) \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\frac{z(t)}{i\\omega_{n } \\!-\\ !",
    "\\varepsilon } , \\label{local}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 and explicit form of @xmath35 was given by us in ref .",
    "let us now focus on @xmath36 , i.e.   the unitary limit case .",
    "the single particle spectral function @xmath37 consists then of :    * a remnant of the free particle state at @xmath38 with the temperature dependent residue @xmath35 , and * bogoliubov - type quasiparticles at @xmath39 whose spectral weights are @xmath40u^{2}$ ] and correspondingly @xmath40v^{2}$ ] .",
    "the free particle residue @xmath35 is sensitive to temperature .",
    "for instance , at @xmath41 we have @xmath42 @xcite which vanishes exponentially when @xmath43 .",
    "it means that at low temperatures only the bogoliubov - type quasiparticles are present . upon increasing temperature an amount @xmath35 of the spectral weight",
    "is transferred from the bogoliubov quasiparticles to the free fermion state , effectively filling - in the gaped spectrum .",
    "our exact solution of the local feshbach scattering problem ( [ andreev ] ) coincides with physical conclusions obtained by t.  senthil and p.a .",
    "lee @xcite who have explored influence of the incoherent pairs ( preformed above @xmath44 ) on the single particle spectrum .",
    "the local pair operator @xmath45 can be formally represented through the amplitude and phase @xmath46 since above @xmath44 the pairs need not be dissociated @xmath47 their phase @xmath48 must be randomly oriented , precluding any off - diagonal long - range order ( odlro ) @xmath49 . to account for superconducting fluctuations the authors assumed certain temporal @xmath50 and spacial @xmath51 scales , over which the pairs are short - range correlated @xmath52 taking into account the pairing field ( [ decay ] ) by means of the lowest order perturbative scheme",
    "they have determined the single particle green s function @xmath53^{-1}$ ] interpolating it by @xcite @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a magnitude of the energy gap due to pairing and parameter @xmath56 is related to the in - gap states . at low energies ( i.e.  for @xmath57 ) a dominant contribution of the spectrum comes from the in - gap quasiparticle with residue @xmath58 whereas at higher energies",
    "the bcs - type quasiparticles are formed .",
    "all these features are present in the exact solution ( [ local ] ) of the local feshbach scattering problem ( [ andreev ] ) for which we have @xmath59 g^{2 } \\frac{i\\omega_n - \\varepsilon } { { \\omega_{n}^{2 } + \\varepsilon^{2}+z(t)g^2 } } \\;\\ ; . \\label{sigma_loc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    = 12.5 cm",
    "combining the local physics ( [ andreev ] ) with the itinerancy @xmath60 of fermions and molecules is a highly non - trivial task .",
    "certain aspects of the complete hamiltonian @xmath61 have been so far addressed by : the selfconsistent perturbative treatment @xcite , dynamical mean field theory @xcite , self - consistent t - matrix approach @xcite , conserving diagrammatic approximations @xcite rg - like scheme @xcite , path integral formulation for the bond operators @xcite and several other techniques .",
    "some of these studies directly @xcite or indirectly @xcite pointed at the bogoliubov quasiparticles surviving above @xmath0 .    here",
    "we would like to focus on the main physical outcomes which could be relevant to the experimental situation of the boulder group @xcite .",
    "for this purpose we apply the phenomenological selfenergy @xmath62 which , according to the argumentation outlined in section iii of the ref .",
    "@xcite , originates from ( [ interpol ] ) and similarly ( [ sigma_loc ] ) .",
    "the particular structure ( [ ansatz ] ) has been also suggested by previous studies of the precursor pairing in the cuprates @xcite and ultracold gasses @xcite .",
    "the essential effects are here provided by temperature dependent parameter @xmath63 related to scattering caused by the preformed pairs and responsible for filling - in the low energy states ( instead of closing the energy gap as in classical superconductors ) .",
    "its role is hence similar to @xmath35 of the local solution ( [ local ] ) .",
    "another parameter @xmath64 merely controls the line broadening so we simply take it as a structureless constant . for specific numerical computations we used @xmath65 , assuming @xmath66 .",
    "such assumption seems reasonable for temperature region exceeding @xmath44 as long as the binding energy of preformed pairs stays constant @xcite ( this constraint can be modified if necessary ) .",
    "we obtained fairly good fitting of the experimental data @xcite using the following empirical temperature dependence @xmath67 at low temperatures @xmath63 is predominantly governed by the exponential decay of @xmath35 , whereas for higher temperatures acquires the linear relation @xmath68 suggested by various studies @xcite . to establish correspondence with the temperature scale we have imposed the ratio @xmath69 realistic for the cuprate superconductors and hopefully valid for ultracold superfluids near the unitarity .",
    "variation of @xmath63 is illustrated in figure [ gammas ] .",
    "the * k*-resolved rf measurements provide information on the occupied part of the single particle excitation spectrum @xmath70^{-1}$ ] . in figure [ kf ]",
    "we show @xmath71-dependence of @xmath72 at the fermi momentum @xmath73 . with constant pairing energy @xmath74 we obtained the gaped spectrum ( at low temperatures ) which gradually evolved into the singly peaked structure for @xmath75 .    in figure [ spectral_fun ]",
    "we show the momentum dependence of the spectral function @xmath72 at temperatures @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "two - peak shape of the edc - curve @xmath80 versus @xmath71 is always accompanied by presence of the bogoliubov quasiparticle branches with their characteristic bending - down ( for @xmath81 ) and bending - up features ( for @xmath82 ) , the latter unfortunately hardly accessible by arpes and @xmath2-resolved rf measurements .",
    "this is driven by the preexisting pairs above @xmath44 correlated over the short- range scales .",
    "the bogoliubov - type quasiparticles represent admixtures of the particle and hole states . in",
    "the underdoped cuprates their presence has been manifested indirectly through the residual diamagnetic response @xcite or the large nernst coefficient and also directly in the single particle spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "we would like to stress that presence of the bogoliubov branches above @xmath0 does not go hand in hand with a suppression of the local density of states @xmath83 .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ ldos ] . for temperatures above @xmath84 when we have the singly peaked edc ( figure [ kf ] ) and mdc ( figure [ spectral_fun ] ) the local density of states",
    "is still clearly depleted around @xmath85 , even for temperatures as high as @xmath86 .",
    "such property might reflect the known discrepancy between large values of @xmath87 ( signaling the opening of pseudogap ) and the actual estimations of @xmath88 at which the short - range superconducting correlations establish @xcite .",
    "transition to the superconducting / superfluid state at the unitary limit @xcite can be accompanied by a number of _ pre - pairing _",
    "signatures @xcite showing up above @xmath0 . among the known hallmarks of the symmetry broken bcs state are the bogoliubov - type quasiparticles representing the mixed particle and hole entities .",
    "recent experimental data @xcite clearly indicate that such bogoliubov quasiparticles survive even beyond the superconducting / superfluid state . near the unitary limit",
    "this is caused by the preformed pairs correlated over short distances which strongly affect the single particle spectra through the interconversion processes ( [ andreev ] ) .",
    "we have examined the impact of preformed pairs on the single particle excitation spectrum . in the instructive solution ( [ local ] ) of the local feshbach scattering problem ( [ andreev ] )",
    "we have shown how the free fermion states emerge out of the bogoliubov quasiparticles [ strictly speaking the bonding and antibonding states ( [ a],[b ] ) ) ] upon increasing temperature .",
    "guided by the perturbative studies @xcite we next employed the pairing ansatz ( [ ansatz ] ) incorporating the local correlations and itinerancy of atoms / molecules . introducing the phenomenological scattering rate ( [ gamma_t ] ) we were able to reproduce the data of the momentum resolved rf spectroscopy obtained for @xmath1k atoms @xcite .    for future studies we suggest use of the andreev tunneling",
    "@xcite as a useful and complementary technique to the @xmath89-resolved rf spectroscopy @xcite . if it were feasible for the ultracold fermion systems the andreev reflections could unambiguously establish the temperature extent of the superconducting / superfluid correlations above @xmath0",
