    "mid infrared atomic fine structure lines are important probes for a variety of astrophysical environments like planetary nebulae ( e.g. , beintema et al . 1996 ) , shocked regions ( e.g. , oliva et al . 1999 ) and galaxies ( e.g. , lutz et al . 2000 ) . due to",
    "their low magnetic dipole transition probabilities the lines are usually optically thin ( @xmath0 to a few ) and measurements of these lines give handles on luminosities and spatial distribution of abundant atoms and ions .",
    "in addition they provide also valuable information on the density , temperature and ionization structure of targets with little or no dependence on dust extinction that hampers observations in the visible .",
    "accurate laboratory measurements of highly ionized species are difficult and line rest wavelengths are mostly based on energy level differences reconstructed from uv and optical spectroscopy .",
    "the knowledge of accurate rest wavelengths of these lines will enhance their diagnostic value for many spectroscopic studies in the mid - infrared wavelength range .",

    "the observations therein were taken early during the iso mission and the subsequent analysis was focused mainly on bright lines .",
    "long integration observations on ngc6302 , ngc6543 and ngc7027 obtained later during the operational lifetime of iso revealed another 7 lines where sws data provide improved accuracies on their rest wavelengths .",

    "this value , translated from its instrumental unit into wavelength , typically corresponds to @xmath2 .",

    "particular attention has been payed to remove instrumental fringing in the wavelength range between 12 @xmath1 m and 29 @xmath1 m by the dedicated fourier filtering modules of sia .",

    "typical velocity changes during an observation were less than 0.3 km / s , so could be neglected .",
    "the observed profiles of all lines with new wavelengths are presented in fig .  1 .",
    "small pointing errors and spatial inhomogeneities of the targets can induce apparent velocity shifts in sws grating data .",
    "we have corrected for this effect using reference lines of accurately known wavelengths , observed in the same sws aperture during the same observation .",
    "details of this strategy are given in paper i and will not be repeated here .",
    "although at similar accuracy , some reference lines with rest wavelengths determined in paper i have been used ( see table  [ reflambda ] ) , to improve on fixing the reference frame and to illustrate the good agreement with the more accurate reference lines .",
    "the new wavelength determinations together with some other line properties are summarized in table  [ newlambda ] .",
    "the framework of fine structure and hydrogen or helium recombination reference lines which were used for the indvidual observations of our targets is listed in table  [ reflambda ] .",
    "the offsets reflect the pointing error and the effects of the spatial structure of the source of the particular observation . together with the uncertainty of the literature wavenumber ,",
    "the ` sws uncertainty ' in table  [ reflambda ] is propagated into the uncertainty of new wavelength determinations that are tied to this line .",
    "apart from literature wavenumbers , table  [ reflambda ] also includes a rest wavenumber for ngc6302 which was determined during the independent observation by the sws fp on ngc6543 .",
    "the sws grating observation of ngc6302 has been carried out on 1997 february 20 .",
    "the total integration time has been 8532 s. beintema & pottasch ( 1999 ) have presented the first analysis of this aot sws06 observation and provided an extensive line list for the sws wavelength range . from this observation we derived improved rest wavelengths for the three lines reported in table  [ newlambda ] .",
    "the [ cl iv ] line has escaped the analysis by beintema & pottasch , who quote an upper limit to the line flux . for the faint lines of [ al vi ] and [ ca vii ]",
    "the uncertainties of the wavelength determinations are dominated by detector noise .    from the analysis of the set of reference lines ( see table  [ reflambda ] ) , measured at similar wavelength and with the same sws aperture , the observed lines in ngc6302 had to be shifted by @xmath18 for [ cl iv ] and @xmath19 for [ al vi ] and [ ca vii ] with respect to the heliocentric velocity of @xmath20 given by acker et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , probably due to a pointing error .",
    "note that a pointing error may translate into different shifts for the short wavelength and long wavelength sections of sws because their beam profiles are centered on slightly different positions on the sky ( salama 2000 ) , and since the velocity shift corresponding to a given angular shift differs for different order and aperture combinations .",
    "the ionic line from [ ariii ] at 21.83 @xmath1 m has been detected by the iso sws fp during an observation of 6750 s on 1997 february 11 .",
    "the wavelengths from the [ neiii ] line at 15.5 @xmath1 m and of the [ siii ] line at 18.71 @xmath1 m have been remeasured during the same observation .",
    "both reproduce the results from paper i within their quoted uncertainties , confirming the assumption of sufficient velocity and spatial averaging across the target through the sws slit sizes , since the [ neiii ] wavelength has been originally determined on ngc7027 and the [ siii ] line has been observed at a different position angle of the sws slit on ngc6543 . the heliocentric velocity correction of -66.1@xmath80.4 km / s for ngc6543 has been taken from schneider et al .",
    "the determined rest wavelength for the [ ariii ] transition is in agreement with the sws grating result from paper i , however its accuracy is now significantly improved .      the planetary nebula ngc7027 has been observed with sws on 1996 october 19 .",
