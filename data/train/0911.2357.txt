    "mean motion resonances are essential in solar system dynamics not only for the planets but also for the motion of the asteroids .",
    "the appearance of chaotic motion in the asteroid belt detected by @xcite  the 3:1 mmr of an asteroid with jupiter  was the first one discovered after the seminal discovery by @xcite for galactic dynamics .",
    "but the structure of the asteroid belt is also created by the secular resonances ( sr ) , where the motion of the perihelia and the nodes can be in resonance for different planets in combination with the asteroid s perihelion respectively node . for the planets",
    "it was found by laskar in different papers ( @xcite ) that especially the inner solar system ( iss ) is in a chaotic state .",
    "the appearance of sr may even shift the orbit of mars out from a stable orbit into an unstable one with high probability when one does not take into account relativity .",
    "the large planets seem to be in quite a safe region , although many mmr are acting : e.g. the 5:2 mmr between jupiter and saturn .",
    "recent investigations by @xcite show how close their motion is to a chaotic state with severe implications for the other planets .    because the orbits of venus and earth are quite close to the 13:8 mmr and they are strongly coupled with respect to the inclinations and eccentricities ( fig . [ fig1 ] )  comparable to jupiter and saturn  we investigated the phase space close to this high order resonance .",
    "the order of a resonance is defined as the difference @xmath2 when we characterize a mmr by @xmath3 .",
    "the value @xmath2 is connected to the exponent in front of the fourier term in the expansion of the disturbing function ; the higher the exponent in a small quantity in front of the fourier term is , the less strong is the influence on the dynamics , unless there is a resonance acting ( e.g. murray and dermott ) .",
    "thus for the 13:8 mmr we have to deal with the order 5 .",
    "it is interesting to note that a relatively small shift of the earth to a smaller semimajor axis would bring the couple venus ",
    "earth into the 8:5 mmr ( order 3 ) ; a shift to a larger semimajor axis would bring both planets into the 5:3 mmr ( order 2 ) ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) . in this plot",
    "the results of the computations in the simple three body problem sun - venus - earth are presented to show the location of the resonances and also their shape .            besides extensive numerical integration of the motions of the planets in different dynamical models",
    ", we also used chaos indicators and analysed the frequencies involved .",
    "furthermore simplified mapping models were constructed to understand the structure of phase space where venus and earth are embedded .",
    "the content of the paper is follows : after a careful test of the dynamical model which we used ( section 2 ) we roughly describe the three mmr mentioned above and show the structure determined with the aid of a chaos indicator ( section 3 ) .",
    "we then report on the results of different numerical experiments where we show the dependency of the stability of the inner planetary system on the eccentricities and the inclinations of venus ( section 4 ) .",
    "in the conclusions we discuss the possible consequences for the stability of the inner planetary system . in an appendix first results of an applied mapping for motions in mmrs are shown .",
    "to choose a quite realistic model we first did integrations with the actual initial conditions of venus and earth in different dynamical models , using a numerical integration scheme based on lie - series ( @xcite ) :    the inner solar system ( iss , 5-bodies )    the iss + jupiter ( 6-bodies )    the iss + jupiter + saturn ( 7-bodies )    the iss + jupiter + saturn + uranus ( 8-bodies )    the iss + outer solar system ( 9-bodies )            the different behaviour between the models consisting only of the inner planets ( * a * ) and the one with jupiter ( * b * ) is visible in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] : the very regular variation limited by a maximum value of @xmath4 ( upper graph )  is completely destroyed by the perturbation of jupiter ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] : lower graph ) .",
    "one can see three distinct sections : ( i ) sometimes the eccentricities almost do not change for up to @xmath5 years ( e.g. between @xmath6 and @xmath7 years for venus and @xmath8 and @xmath9 years for the earth ) ; ( ii ) sometimes the changes are in antiphase ( like in the upper graph of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) ; and ( iii ) sometimes they are in phase .",
    "including now saturn as perturber in model * c * changes the picture a lot : the development of the eccentricities is always in antiphase , reaches even larger maximum values , but looks smoother for both planets compared to model * b * ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] upper graph ) .",
    "now by comparing the dynamical evolution of venus and earth including all planets of the solar system ( model * e * , fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] bottom ) with * c * it is interesting to note that for the first @xmath10 years even quantitatively the behaviour is very similar .",
    "later ( up to @xmath11 years ) at least qualitatively both models show an analogous behaviour .",
    "in addition to the former computations we compare for the five different models the dominating frequencies , which were derived by the program sigspec ( @xcite ) .",
    "sigspec incorporates the frequency and phase of the signal appropriately and takes into account the properties of the time - domain sampling which provides an unprecedentedly accurate peak detection ( @xcite ) .",
    "although the present investigations deal with equidistantly sampled time series , the benefit of frequency- and phase - resolved statistics and the capability of full automation are indispensible also in this application .    the data used were the orbital element @xmath12 of the earth and of venus in all mentioned dynamical models .",
    "it is evident that the model * a * gives quite a wrong picture of the involved resonances . to include",
    "only jupiter is already a much better model and taking into account the great inequality between jupiter and saturn * c * ( x - axes 7 ) is a very good description of the motions of earth and venus .",
    "the differences between the models * c * and * e * are not significant as we also noticed from the direct inspection of the eccentricity plots .",
    "consequently as compromise between long cpu time and precision of the model it is clear that * c * is a good choice .",
    "one additional test was made by checking the maximum eccentricities of the orbits ( @xmath13 ) of the inner planets when changing the initial eccentricity of venus .",
    "the respective integrations for @xmath14 years shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] point out the differences in @xmath13 of each individual planet in the 5 and 7-body models ( * a * and * c * ) for the 13:8 mmr .",
    "in contrast to the other planets one can see that the earth ( light grey ) has almost always a higher maximum eccentricity due to the influence of jupiter and saturn than without these two planets . for mercury and mars no clear dependence is observable , the maximum values of their eccentricities change with the initial inclination of venus .",
    "it is remarkable that mercury achieves very high eccentricities , and eventually escapes for longer integrations ( see next chapter )",
    ".     years with fixed orbital elements in the 13:8 mmr : the differences in maximum eccentricity of each individual planet in 2 models ( * a * , dashed lines , * c * full lines ) are plotted ( y - axis ) for initially different inclinations of venus ( x - axis ) .",

    "in fig . [ fig2 ] we show a detailed graph of the neighborhood of the 13:8 mmr in the planar 3-body problem sun - venus - earth : in addition to the 13:8 , the 8:5 and the 5:3 mmr many high order mmrs are visible . to derive a simple picture of the phase space structure close to the 13:8 mmr only two initial parameters",
    "were changed : on the x - axis the semimajor axis of the earth was varied and on the y - axis the initial eccentricity of the perturbing planet venus is plotted . in this graph , where the maximum eccentricity of an earth - orbit during the integration time is shown on a grey scale ,",
    "one already can see the inequality of the perturbations acting in the resonances .",

    "it shows a big quiet central region and in the wings the earth s orbit suffers from relatively large eccentricities @xmath21    another high order mmr , the 18:11 resonance , is visible close to the 13:8 resonance , which we will not discuss here because its action is evidently weaker ( order 7 ) .    to use the results of direct numerical integrations",
    "one has to carry out orbital computations over a very long time . in order to save computation time",
    "it is advisable to use a so - called chaos indicator , that shows the state of motion quite fast and allows us to reduce the integration time significantly .",
    "therefore , we used the fast lyapunov indicator ( fli ) ( see @xcite ) , which is a quite fast tool to distinguish between regular and chaotic motion . according to the definition  where @xmath22 is the length of the largest tangent vector :",
    "@xmath23    ( @xmath24 denotes the dimension of the phase space )  it is obvious that chaotic orbits can be found very quickly because of the exponential growth of this vector in the chaotic region .",
    "this method has often been applied to studies of extra - solar planetary systems ( @xcite ) . in this",

    "[ fig7 ] shows the state of motion from 0.98 au to 1.020 au for different eccentricities of the earth .",
    "one can clearly see perturbations in the stable region even for low eccentric motion of the earth due to mmr with venus .",

    "[ fig7 ] ) .",
    "to check the sensitivity with respect to different initial conditions of the planet twins venus  earth concerning the stability of the inner solar system we performed a series of numerical integrations in the model * c * for @xmath27 years where we checked the three mmr described before .",
    "two cuts through the exact location of the mmr have been undertaken , one where we changed the eccentricity of venus and another one where we changed its inclination .",

    "a second dangerous inclination is visible around @xmath43 ; then , from @xmath44 on , mercury would suffer from close approaches to venus .",

    "mars is not affected dramatically in this resonance , venus and earth stay within moderate eccentricities for all initial inclinations of venus .",
    "in this investigation we explored the environment of the 13:8 mmr , which is very close to the actual position of venus and earth .",
    "after a careful test of a simplified dynamical model of our planetary system appropriate for our task we discussed the main structures of the three mmr in the vicinity of the two planets using the results of a study of the fli .    in another step , using extensive numerical integrations we changed the ratio of the semimajor axes venus",
    " earth ; the orbit of the earth was given different values of @xmath49 to cover the proximate neighborhood of the mmr where the twin - planets are in .",
    "then , in two different runs the eccentricity of venus was set to eccentricities up to @xmath50 and in the dynamical model , consisting of the inner solar system with jupiter and saturn , the equations of motion were integrated for @xmath27 years .",
    "the same was done in a second run where we changed the inclination of venus up to @xmath1 .",
    "these two experiments were undertaken for each of the three mmr 8:5 , 13:8 and 5:3 and the results analysed with respect to the maximum eccentricties of the inner planets .",
    "it turned out that only mercury is the planet which would suffer from such perturbations , that it would achieve very large values of its eccentricity and thus would be thrown out from its current orbit .",
    "according to our results mars is not as strongly affected by a larger inclination or eccentricity of venus as mercury ; this can be understood by the presence of jupiter and saturn keeping this planet almost in its original plane of motion .",
    "venus and also the earth are only affected for larger initial inclinations of venus , but the planets stay more or less in their orbits although sometimes achieving eccentricities as large as @xmath36 .    in an attempt to understand the dynamical structure of the resonances a mapping approach ( appendix ) was constructed in the simple elliptic restricted three body problem sun  venus and massless earth for the 3:1 mmr .",
    "the same approach was then used to construct the surface of section of the 5:3 mmr .",
    "until now we failed to get a similar graph for the other two resonances which ask for a development of the hamiltionian up to order 3 and order 5 , but we work on it .",
    "as a final statement we may say that according to our results although the couple of venus and earth is close to a mmr we do not expect big changes of the orbits of the inner planets unless venus will come into an orbit of an inclination of about 7 degrees or will achieve an eccentricity of 0.2 .",
    "then , in fact , mercury would be on an unstable orbit which could finally throw it either into the sun or far out into the main belt of asteroids !",
    "mapping methods are very efficient analytical tools for studying the dynamics of mean motion resonances .",
    "their main advantage is the fact , that a mapping is much faster in regard to computing time , while also being more exact than numerical integrations in the same model . in this work",
    ", we followed the approach used in the works of @xcite , which has been found very successful already in the study of the 1:1 resonance .",
    "the mapping allows us to investigate the phase space structures of @xmath3 mmr in a semi - analytical way .",
    "the hamiltonian of the three body problem in the exact location of the chosen resonance is used to derive equations , which provide a set of rules for the propagation of a trajectory in phase space .",
    "the hamiltonian in keplerian elements @xmath51 describing the motion of the perturbed body is averaged over the orbital period of the perturbing body and then transformed to action and angle variables @xmath52 in phase space by canonical transformations .",
    "the mapping equations then provide iteration rules for each of these variables with a time step equaling the orbital period of the perturber .",
    "being based on the exact equations of motion , the results obtained from the mapping equations provide the most accurate insight in the dynamics of the chosen system .    to test the applicability of the method ,",
    "the 3:1 resonance of a massless body with jupiter in the planar elliptic restricted three body problem has been analyzed , which yielded very good results .",
    "the same method was used for the 5:3 resonance of a massless particle with earth , again in the planar er3bp .",
    "these two resonances are of order two and therefore more easily computable than the 8:5 and the 13:8 resonance , in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] ( left graph ) the phase space portrait for the 3:1 mean motion resonance of a test body with jupiter is shown .",
    "the same method was applied to the 5:3 mmr with earth . up to now ,",
    "we have been studying only low - order resonances in the planar elliptic restricted three body problem using the described method with good results . in a next step",
