    "there was a dramatic change in our knowledge of the evolution history of the universe based on the standard cosmology at the end of the last century due to some observational predictions from type ia supernova @xcite and others @xcite .",
    "riess et al .",
    "@xcite and perlmutter et al .",
    "@xcite observed that distant supernovae at redshift @xmath3 , and @xmath4 mag are found to be about 25% fainter than the prediction from standard cosmology , and hence , they concluded that the universe at present is undergoing through an accelerated expansion rather than deceleration ( as predicted by the standard cosmology ) .",
    "this present accelerating phase was also supported by the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite , and the baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) @xcite .",
    "the explanation of this unexpected accelerating phase is a great challenge to the theoretical physics . since the discovery of this accelerating universe",
    ", people are trying to explain this observational fact in two different ways either modifying the einstein s gravity itself , or , by introducing some unknown kind of matter in the framework of einstein gravity . in the second option ,",
    "cosmological constant is the common choice for this unknown matter .",
    "but it suffers from two serious problems the measured value of the cosmological constant is far below the prediction from quantum field theory , and secondly , the coincidence problem @xcite .",
    "so , people choose this unknown matter as some kind of dynamical fluid with negative and time dependent equation of state , and is termed as dark energy ( de ) .",
    "though a lot of works have been done with several models of de ( see references @xcite for reviews ) but still its origin is totally mysterious to us .",
    "+ among other possibilities to explain the present accelerating stage , inclusion of back reaction in the einstein s field equations through an effective ( @xmath5ve ) pressure is much relevant in the context of cosmology , and the gravitational production of particles [ radiation , or cold dark matter ( cdm ) ] provides a mechanism for cosmic acceleration @xcite . in particular , in comparison with dark energy models , the particle creation scenario has a strong physical basis : the non - equilibrium thermodynamics . also , the particle creation mechanism not only unifies the dark sectors ( de+ dm ) @xcite , but also it contains only one free parameter as we need only a single dark component ( dm ) .",
    "further , statistical bayesian analysis with one free parameter should be preferred along with the hierarchy of cosmological models @xcite .",
    "so , the present particle creation model which simultaneously fits the observational data and alleviates the coincidence and fine - tuning problems , is better compared to the known ( one - parameter ) models namely ( i ) the concordance @xmath6cdm which however suffers from the coincidence and fine - tuning problems @xcite and ( ii ) the brane world cosmology @xcite which does not fit the snia+ bao+ cmb ( shift - parameter ) data @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it should be mentioned that the thermodynamics of dark energy has been studied in equilibrium and non - equilibrium situations in the literature @xcite .",
    "+ the homogeneous and isotropic flat flrw model of the universe is chosen as an open thermodynamics system which is adiabatic in nature . although the entropy per particle is constant for this system , still there is entropy production due to expansion of the universe ( i.e. , enlargement of the phase space ) @xcite . as a result , the dissipative pressure ( i.e. , bulk viscous pressure ) is linearly related to the particle creation rate @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "further , using the friedmann s equations , one can relate @xmath1 to the evolution of the universe [ see equation ( [ eqn8 ] ) below ] .",
    "choosing @xmath1 as a function of the hubble parameter from thermodynamical view point , it is possible to describe different phases of the evolution of the universe and @xmath0 can be obtained as a function of @xmath2 , the red shift parameter . finally , we consider two components of matter which have different particle creation rate @xcite , and @xmath0 has been evaluated and plotted to examine whether more than one transition of @xmath0 is possible or not . in formulation of the general theory of relativity , in terms of the spin connection coefficients , it has been shown @xcite that the cosmological evolution of the metrics is induced by the dilaton without the inflation hypothesis and the @xmath6 term .",
    "further , it is found that the dilaton evolution yields the vacuum creation of matter , and the dilaton vacuum energy plays a role of the dark energy . on the other hand , in the hamiltonian approach to the gravitational model with the aid of dirac - adm foliation , pervushin et al .",
    "@xcite showed a natural separation of the dilatonic and gravitational dynamics in terms of the maurer - carton forms . as a result",
    ", the dominance of the casimir vacuum energy of physical fields provides a good description of the type ia supernovae luminosity distance - redshift relation .",
    "furthermore , introducing the uncertainty principle at the planck s epoch , it is found that the hierarchy of the universe s energy scales is supported by the observational data .",
    "also , this hamiltonian dynamics of the model describes the effect of an intensive vacuum creation of gravitons and the minimal coupling scalar ( higgs ) bosons in the early universe .",
    "+ moreover , the motivation of the present work in the framework of the particle creation mechanism comes from some recent related works .",
    "it has been shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , that the entire cosmic evolution from inflationary stage can be described by particle creation mechanism with some specific choices of the particle creation rates . as these works show late - time acceleration without any concept of dark energy , so , it is very interesting to think of the particle creation mechanism as an alternative way of explaining the idea of dark energy .",
    "the present work is an extension of these works by considering two fluid system as the cosmic fluid .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section ii deals with non - equilibrium thermodynamics in the background of particle creation mechanics while several choices of @xmath1 as a function of the hubble parameter are shown in section iii and the deceleration parameter @xmath0 has been presented both analytically and graphically .",
    "a field theoretic analysis of the particle creation mechanism is presented in section iv .",
    "section iv is related to interacting two dark fluids having different particle creation rates and it is examined whether two transitions for @xmath0 are possible or not .",
    "finally , there is a summary of the work in section vi .",
    "suppose the homogeneous and isotropic flat flrw model of the universe is chosen as an open thermodynamical system .",
    "the metric ansatz takes the form    @xmath7.\\label{flrw - eqn1}\\ ] ]    then the friedmann equations are    @xmath8    where @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the hubble rate , @xmath11 is the scale factor of the universe , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the total energy density and the thermodynamical pressure of the cosmic fluid , @xmath14 is related to some dissipative phenomena ( bulk viscous pressure ) , and the overdot denotes the derivative with respect to the cosmic time @xmath15 . it should be noted that there are several choices of @xmath14 and corresponding solutions in the literature @xcite .",
    "the energy conservation relation reads    @xmath16    as the particle number is not conserved ( i.e. , @xmath17 @xmath18 0 ) , so , the modified particle number conservation equation takes the form @xcite",
    "@xmath19    where @xmath20 is the particle number density , @xmath21 is the total number of particles in a co - moving volume @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the particle flow vector , @xmath24 is the particle velocity , @xmath25 , stands for the fluid expansion , @xmath1 represents the particle creation rate , and , notationally , @xmath26 .",
    "the sign of @xmath1 indicates creation ( for @xmath27 ) , or , annihilation ( for @xmath28 ) of particles , and , due to @xmath14 which adds some dissipative effect to the cosmic fluid , non - equilibrium thermodynamics comes into picture .",
    "+ now , from the gibb s equation using clausius relation , we have @xcite    @xmath29    where ` @xmath30 ' represents entropy per particle , and @xmath31 is the fluid temperature . using the conservation relations ( [ conservation - eqn3 ] ) and ( [ eqn4 ] ) , the variation of entropy can be expressed as @xcite    @xmath32    further , for simplicity , if we assume the thermal process to be adiabatic ( i.e. , @xmath33 ) , then from eq .",
    "( [ eqn6 ] ) we have @xcite    @xmath34    thus , the dissipative pressure is completely characterized by the particle creation rate for the above simple ( isentropic ) thermodynamical system . in other words ,",
    "the cosmic substratum may be considered as a perfect fluid with barotropic equation of state , @xmath35 , ( @xmath36 ) , together with a dissipative phenomena which comes into picture through the particle creation mechanism .",
    "furthermore , although the ` entropy per particle ' is constant , but still there is entropy generation due to particle creation , i.e. , enlargement of the phase space through expansion of the universe .",
    "so , in some sense , the non - equilibrium configuration is not the conventional one due to the effective bulk pressure , rather , a state with equilibrium properties as well ( but not the equilibrium era with @xmath37 ) .",
    "now , eliminating @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 from the friedmann s equations ( [ friedmann - eqn2 ] ) , the isentropic condition ( [ eqn7 ] ) , and , using barotropic equation of state , @xmath38 , we obtain    @xmath39    the above equation shows that in case of adiabatic process , the particle creation rate is related to the evolution of the universe .",
    "introducing the deceleration parameter    @xmath40    and , using eq .",
    "( [ eqn8 ] ) , we have    @xmath41    in the following subsections , we shall choose @xmath1 as different functions of the hubble parameter to describe different stages of evolution of the universe and examine whether @xmath0 so obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eqn10 ] ) has any transition ( from deceleration to acceleration or vice versa ) , or , not .",
    "furthermore , it would be worthwhile to see the statefinder analysis for the particle creation rates in different stages of our universe .",
    "the statefinder parameters were introduced by sahni el at .",
    "@xcite as a geometrical concept to filter several observationally supported dark energy models from other phenomenological dark energy models existing in the literature .",
    "they introduced two new geometrical variables @xmath42 as follows @xcite    @xmath43     + figure 1 : the figure shows the transition from early inflationary phase @xmath44 decelerating stage [ see eq .",
    "( [ eqn13 ] ) ] .     + figure 1.1 : the figures show the variation of @xmath45 against @xmath2 in early stage of the universe for three different choices of @xmath46 .",
    "+ figure 1.2 : the second statefinder parameter @xmath30 is shown over @xmath2 for three different choices of @xmath46 .      in the very early universe ( starting from a regular vacuum )",
    "most of the particle creation effectively takes place and from thermodynamic point of view we have @xcite + ( i ) at the beginning of the expansion , there should be maximal entropy production rate ( i.e. , maximal particle creation rate ) so that universe evolves from non - equilibrium thermodynamical state to equilibrium era with the expansion of the universe .",
    "+ ( ii ) a regular ( true ) vacuum for radiation initially , i.e. , @xmath47 , as @xmath48 . + ( iii ) @xmath49 in the very early universe so that the created radiation behaves as thermalized heat bath and subsequently , the creation rate should fall slower than expansion rate and particle creation becomes dynamically insignificant .",
    "+ now , according to gunzig et al .",
    "@xcite , the simplest choice satisfying the above requirements is that particle creation rate is proportional to the energy density , i.e. , @xmath50 ( where @xmath51 is a proportionality constant ) . for this choice of @xmath1",
    ", @xmath52 can be solved from ( [ eqn8 ] ) as    @xmath53    where @xmath54 is related to @xmath51 as @xmath55 .",

    "we note that as @xmath58 constant , indicating an exponential expansion ( @xmath59 ) in the inflationary era , while for @xmath60 , @xmath61 , indicates the standard flrw cosmology ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "so , if we identify  @xmath57 \" at some intermediate value of ` @xmath63 ' , where , @xmath64 , i.e. , a transition from de sitter accelerating phase to the standard decelerating radiation phase , then we have @xmath65 , and , eq . ( [ eqn8 ] )",

    "figures 1.1 and 1.2 display the graphical behavior of the statefinder parameters showing that in early stage of the universe , @xmath45 changes its sign from @xmath70ve ( @xmath71 inflationary era ) to @xmath5ve ( @xmath71 decelerating phase ) , while @xmath30 stays positive throughout the transition .      here",
    "the simple natural choice is @xmath72 , i.e. , @xmath73 ( where @xmath74 is the proportionality constant ) .",
    "it should be noted that this choice of @xmath1 does not satisfy the third thermodynamical requirement ( mentioned above ) at the early universe .",
    "also the solution will not satisfy the above condition ( ii ) of [ early - phase ] . in this case @xmath0",
    "does not depend on the expansion rate , it only depends on @xmath46 . for radiation ( i.e. , @xmath75 ) era , @xmath76 , while for matter dominated era ( i.e. , @xmath77 ) @xmath78 .",

    "then a field theoretic analysis has been shown for the particle creation mechanism in section iv .",
    "finally , in section v , a combination of non - interacting two perfect fluids having different particle creation rate is considered as a cosmic substratum , and the deceleration parameter is evaluated .",
    "the behavior of the deceleration parameter is examined graphically in figures 38 .",
    "figures 3 , 4 , 6 and 7 show two transitions of @xmath0one in the early epoch from acceleration to deceleration , and , the other one corresponds to the transition in the recent past from deceleration to present accelerating stage .",
    "the figures 3 and 4 correspond to two different choices of unequal particle creation parameters , while for two distinct equal particle creation rate , the variation of @xmath0 are presented in figures 6 and 7 .",
    "there are three distinct transitions of @xmath0 for unequal and equal particle creation parameters in figures 5 and 8 respectively .",
    "both the figures show that there is a chance of our universe to decelerate again in future from the present accelerating stage .",
    "thus , theoretically , considering non - interacting two fluid system as cosmic substratum , it is possible to have again a decelerating phase of the universe in future .",
    "therefore , we may conclude that the present observed accelerating phase is due to non - equilibrium thermodynamics having particle creation processes , or , in other words , in addition to the presently known two possibilities ( namely , modification of einstein gravity , or , introduction of some unknown exotic fluid , i.e. , de ) for explaining the recent observations , non - equilibrium thermodynamics through particle creation mechanism may explain not only the late time acceleration but also exhibits early inflationary scenario , and , predict future transition to decelerating era again , and this transient phenomenon is supported by the works in @xcite .",
    "finally , we remark that only future evolution of the universe can test whether our prediction from particle creation mechanism is correct , or , wrong .",

    "<S> the paper deals with non - equilibrium thermodynamics based on adiabatic particle creation mechanism with the motivation of considering it as an alternative choice to explain the recent observed accelerating phase of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> using friedmann equations , it is shown that the deceleration parameter ( @xmath0 ) can be obtained from the knowledge of the particle production rate ( @xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> motivated from thermodynamical point of view , cosmological solutions are evaluated for the particle creation rates in three cosmic phases , namely , inflation , matter dominated and present late time acceleration . </S>",
    "<S> the deceleration parameter ( @xmath0 ) is expressed as a function of the redshift parameter ( @xmath2 ) , and its variation is presented graphically . </S>",
    "<S> also , statefinder analysis has been presented graphically in three different phases of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> finally , two non - interacting fluids with different particle creation rates are considered as cosmic substratum , and deceleration parameter ( @xmath0 ) is evaluated . </S>",
    "<S> it is examined whether more than one transition of @xmath0 is possible or not by graphical representations . </S>"
