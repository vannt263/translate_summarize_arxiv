    "a contentious issue in x - ray astronomy , and more generally in the study of galaxy formation and evolution , is whether massive galaxies , groups , and clusters possess inhomogeneous cooling flows wherein large quantities of gas have cooled and dropped out of the hot phase resulting in a spatially extended multiphase medium ( e.g. , fabian , nulsen , & canizares 1984 ; fabian 1994 ; binney 1996 ) . in the era before _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm _ the instrument with the best combined spatial resolution , bandwidth , and energy resolution for studies of cooling flows was the _ rosat _ pspc . the bandwidth ( 0.1 - 2.4 kev ) of the pspc is especially critical because its sensitivity to energies both above and below the edge ( 0.532 kev ) has allowed us recently to detect intrinsic oxygen absorption in cooling flow galaxies and groups which provides the first direct evidence of a spatially extended multiphase medium in these systems ( buote 2000b , hereafter paper1 ; buote 2000d , hereafter paper3 ) .",
    "m87 is arguably the best target for study of its hot plasma with _ rosat _ because it is the brightest nearby galaxy , group , or cluster that also possesses an ambient gas temperature ( @xmath0 kev ) that lies within the bandpass of the pspc . for these reasons",
    "m87 has been the subject of numerous x - ray studies .",
    "the early analysis by @xcite of the _ einstein _ fpcs spectral data of m87 provided the first evidence of a multiphase hot ism in a galaxy cluster , though this claim was disputed by @xcite using data from the other _ einstein _",
    "detectors with lower energy resolution .",
    "@xcite discovered intrinsic absorption in the _ einstein _ sss data of m87 which was later confirmed with _",
    "asca _ @xcite . in these studies",
    "the absorber is assumed to be cold gas with solar abundances similar to the intervening cold gas in the milky way .",
    "the useful bandpasses of the _ einstein _ sss and _ asca _ sis extend down to @xmath3 kev , and thus the _ rosat _ pspc whose bandpass extends down to 0.1 kev should be even more sensitive to soft x - ray absorption from cold gas ( or dust ) .    however , in the first detailed spectral analysis of the pspc data of m87 @xcite mention in passing that when the hydrogen column density is treated as a free parameter they obtain values _",
    "less _ than galactic .",
    "although not emphasized by @xcite this result is inconsistent with significant absorption from cold gas .",
    "a later _ rosat _ analysis by @xcite restricted consideration only to energies above 0.4 kev and also finds no evidence for absorption from cold gas in the pspc data of m87 .",
    "but a subsequent re - analysis by these authors now finds evidence for such absorption ( sanders , fabian , & allen 2000 ) .",
    "the confused status of intrinsic x - ray absorption and multiphase gas in m87 warrants re - examination .",
    "the possible connection between the cooling flow and agn in m87 has also received considerable attention recently .",
    "it has been known for some time ( e.g. , bhringer 1997 ) that the x - ray isophotes are somewhat distorted within @xmath4 kpc of the center of m87 , and these distortions appear to correlate with the radio emission . a new deep radio image obtained by @xcite shows that the radio emission fills the central @xmath4 kpc region .",
    "the spatial correlation between radio and x - ray emission in m87 has been interpreted as evidence that the agn has refashioned the hot ism and stifled the cooling flow in the central region @xcite .",
    "therefore , we re - analyze the pspc data primarily to search for oxygen absorption and warm gas in m87 similar to that found for the lower s / n galaxies and groups in paper1 and paper3 .",
    "we also investigate cooling flow models in an attempt to clarify the possible connection between the agn and cooling flow .",
    "the paper is organized in follows . in  [ obs ] we present the observations and discuss the data reduction .",
    "the deprojection procedure is summarized in  [ xdeproj ] .",
    "we discuss the spectral fitting of single - phase models in  [ single ] and of multiphase models in  [ multi ] . in ",

    "pspc data of m87 from the public data archive maintained by the high energy astrophysics science archive research center ( heasarc ) .",
    "the properties of the observations are listed in table [ tab.obs ] .",
    "the three observations have essentially identical exposures and pointings ( i.e. , centered on m87 ) .",
    "each observation was reduced separately , and we refer the reader to buote ( 2000c , hereafter paper2 ) for details of our implementation of the standard data reduction procedures .      background spectra were obtained from source - free regions near the edge of the pspc fields ; i.e. , @xmath11 from the field centers .",
    "the principal advantage of a local background estimate is that residual contamination from solar x - rays and any other long - term background enhancements @xcite are fully accounted for in the ensuing spectral analysis .",
    "the disadvantage is that the extended x - ray emission of m87 and the virgo cluster fills the entire pspc field and must be disentangled from the true background .",
    "( note that the background cluster emission is accounted for in the deprojection analysis ",
    "see  3.1 of paper2 . )",
    "we extracted the background spectra separately from each observation and then added them together .",
    "since each observation occurred after the october 1991 gain change the redistribution matrix file ( rmf ) , which specifies the channel probability distribution for a photon , is the same for each .",
    "since , however , the detector location of background regions are in general slightly different for the different observations because of slight aspect differences , we averaged their respective auxiliary response files ( arfs ) which contain the information on the effective area as a function of energy and detector location .    to obtain an estimate of the true background we follow the procedure outlined in paper2 and",
    "fit the composite background spectrum with a model after subtracting the particle background .",
    "we represent the cosmic x - ray background by a power law with photon index @xmath12 and the galactic emission by two soft thermal components following @xcite .",
    "( actually , for m87 we find that only one of these soft thermal components is required with a temperature @xmath13 kev . ) to account for emission from the extended cluster emission we include another thermal component with variable temperature .",
    "each component is modified by the galactic hydrogen column density listed in table [ tab.obs ] .",
    "this composite model provides a good fit to the background spectrum ( @xmath14 for 185 dof ) , and the additional thermal component representing the cluster emission is clearly required by the data ; i.e. , @xmath15 for 181 dof without the cluster component . the temperature of the cluster component is @xmath16 kev ( 90% confidence ) which is somewhat less than the @xmath17 kev temperature inferred by @xcite over the same regions of the pspc data .",
    "these differences are probably the result of the different models used to compute the background .",
    "if , for example , we do not include the cosmic power law component in our fits then we obtain a temperature of @xmath18 kev similar to @xcite .",
    "( note that the temperature of the cluster component is very insensitive to the metallicity . )",
    "since the diffuse background is most important in the softest energy channels the stability of the background estimate to various assumptions can be assessed by considering the background flux between 0.2 and 0.3 kev .",
    "( the need for the 0.2 kev lower limit arises from psf considerations ",
    "see below in  [ src ] . )",
    "let us compare the 0.2 - 0.3 kev flux obtained from our best - fitting background model to a similar model where instead the cluster component temperature is fixed at 3 kev .",
    "we find that the 0.2 - 0.3 kev fluxes of the background models ( after excluding the cluster components ) differ by only 14% with the best - fitting model having the slightly larger 0.2 - 0.3 kev flux .",
    "( we also prefer the slightly larger background estimate from the best - fitting model as it allows a more conservative assessment of any intrinsic soft emission in m87 . )",
    "the background rate of the best - fitting model ( i.e. , after excluding the 1.5 kev cluster component ) is @xmath19 cts s@xmath8 arcmin@xmath9 ( table [ obs ] ) which is very similar to the value of @xmath20 cts s@xmath8 arcmin@xmath9 obtained for pspc observations of three other virgo galaxies in paper2 .",
    "we subtract the background spectrum from each source annulus ( see below ) following the procedure described in  4.1.4 ( equation 1 ) in paper2 . that is , the background model ( cosmic+galactic ) is scaled to the source annulus accounting for differences in area , exposure , vignetting , and detector response between the source and background regions .",
    "the ambient virgo emission is accounted for downstream in the deprojection analysis discussed in  [ xdeproj ]",
    "( see also  3.1 of paper2 ) .      since our interest lies principally in the central regions where any intrinsic oxygen absorption is expected to be most pronounced , we confine our analysis of the x - ray emission of m87 to the region within the central ring of the pspc ( radius @xmath21 ) .",
    "this is also the best calibrated region of the pspc and is not affected by shading by the radial spokes of the pspc support structure .",
    "the source spectra were extracted in concentric circular annuli located at the x - ray centroid ( computed within a @xmath22 radius ) such that for each annulus the width was @xmath23 and the background - subtracted counts was larger than some value ( @xmath24 ) chosen to minimize uncertainties on the spectral parameters for each system while maintaining as many annuli as possible ( see figure [ fig.m87 ] .",
    "data with energies @xmath25 kev were excluded to insure that the psf was @xmath26 fwhm . for our on - axis sources @xmath27 of the psf at 0.2 kev is contained within @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "any background sources that were identified by visual examination of the image were masked out before the extraction .",
    "to obtain the three - dimensional properties of the x - ray emitting gas we deproject the data assuming spherical symmetry using the `` onion - peeling '' technique pioneered by @xcite .",
    "that is , one begins by determining the emission in the bounding annulus and then works inwards by subtracting off the contributions from the outer annuli .",
    "a full account of our implementation of this procedure is given in paper2 .    since we confine our analysis to the region within the central ring of the pspc there",
    "exists significant emission from m87/virgo outside of the chosen bounding annulus .",
    "this constitutes a `` cluster background '' component that needs to be subtracted from each source annulus in addition to the cosmic+galactic background discussed in  [ bkg ] . following  3.1 of paper2 we represent the spatial distribution of this cluster background by a @xmath29-model with the same spectrum as the bounding annulus .",
    "( x - ray emissivity of a @xmath29 model is @xmath30 at large radius . ) as in paper2 we find that the derived temperatures , abundances , and column densities are very insensitive to typical values of @xmath29 for galaxies and clusters and thus we employ @xmath31 for all results presented in  [ single ] and  [ multi ] .",
    "we find that the radial profiles of the temperatures , fe abundances , and column densities are generally well behaved .",
    "hence , unlike for the galaxies and groups analyzed in paper2 we do not perform the quasi - regularization of the temperatures and abundances described in  3.3 of paper2 . the greater stability of parameter values can be attributed to the much larger s / n of the m87 data .",
    "( we mention that the deprojection procedure is invalid if there are gaps between annuli .",
    "this is another reason why we confined our analysis within the central ring of the pspc . )",

    "this is the simplest case and would seem _ a priori _ to be most appropriate for the low energy resolution of the _ rosat _ data .",
    "below in  [ multi ] we consider multiphase models . as in previous studies we use the mekal plasma code ( mewe , gronenschild , & van den oord 1985 ; kaastra & mewe 1993 ; liedahl , osterheld , & goldstein 1995 ) to represent the emission of hot gas at a single temperature .",
    "we take the solar abundances in xspec to be those given by the @xcite table , because it contains the correct value of the solar fe abundance , @xmath32 by number .",
    "the popular table of @xcite used in xspec has an old value for fe / h which is too large by a factor of 1.44 as initially pointed out by @xcite . see ",
    "4.1.3 of paper2 for further discussion .",
    "according to the recent deconvolution analysis of _ asca _ data by @xcite the fe abundance of m87 is @xmath33 within the central arcminute , remains essentially constant at @xmath34 out to @xmath35 , and then falls to an average value of @xmath36 between @xmath37 ( all abundances scaled to meteoritic solar ) .",
    "these results agree with the multitemperature models of the _ asca _ sis data obtained by fitting the integrated spectra within @xmath38 of m87 by @xcite .",
    "consequently , when we fix the fe abundance in selected models we assign it the value of @xmath39 appropriate for the two - temperature model of @xcite .",
    "following standard practice we represent the soft x - ray absorption arising from the milky way by cold material with solar abundances distributed as a foreground screen at zero redshift . in this standard absorption model",
    "the x - ray flux is diminished according to @xmath40 , where is the hydrogen column density and @xmath41 is the energy - dependent photo - electric absorption cross section for a cold absorber with solar abundances .",
    "@xcite have shown that the galactic column density varies over the pspc field of m87 .",
    "inspection of their figure 2 reveals that varies almost radially outward from m87 taking a minimum value of @xmath42 @xmath7 near the center and a value of @xmath43 @xmath7 near our bounding annulus ( # 10 ) . since intermediate values of appear to prevail at intermediate radii we set @xmath44 @xmath7 in those cases where we fix in our models .",
    "in other instances we allow to be a free parameter in our fits to indicate any excess absorption intrinsic to a galaxy or group and also to allow for any errors in the assumed galactic value and for any calibration uncertainties . note that in this standard model is measured as a function of two - dimensional radius , @xmath45 , on the sky in contrast to the emission parameters ( e.g. , gas temperature , fe abundance ) that are measured as a function of three - dimensional radius , @xmath46 .",
    "the photo - electric absorption cross sections used in this paper are given by @xcite .",
    "it has been pointed out by @xcite that the he cross section at 0.15 kev is in error by 13% in the @xcite compilation . recently",
    "a new version of xspec ( v11 ) has been released which updates the @xcite table to include the more accurate he cross sections of @xcite .",
    "we find that when using these more accurate he cross sections we obtain hydrogen column densities that are 5%-10% larger than when using the original @xcite he cross sections in xspec v10 .",
    "where appropriate we mention these small differences below .",
    "we begin with the model having the least number of free parameters .",
    "this corresponds to setting @xmath47 for the standard absorber and holding the fe abundance fixed to @xmath39 as discussed above .",
    "the values of @xmath48 for this model ( 0nh_0fe ) are listed in table [ tab.1 t ] , and the spectral fits for the inner and outer annuli are displayed in figure [ fig.1t_spec ] .",
    "it is clear from the large reduced @xmath48 values and the large residuals in the spectral plots that this model provides a very poor fit to the _ rosat _ pspc spectra of m87 .",
    "two regions of the spectra are primarily responsible for the poor fits . in the energy band 0.2 - 0.4",
    "kev the data clearly lie above the model prediction .",
    "immediately one can conclude that there is no intrinsic absorption from cold gas precisely as found for the galaxies and groups in paper3 ; see section 2.1 of paper1 and section 3.2 of paper3 for details .",
    "since we find that the results obtained when using absorber models with partial covering are essentially identical to those obtained for the standard uniform - screen absorber , we only discuss the uniform screen . ]",
    "for which we would have expected to see a deficiency of flux below the models with @xmath47 . instead soft emission in excess of this model is suggested .",
    "in contrast , between 0.5 - 0.8 kev the data do lie below the model consistent with intrinsic absorption . from inspection of figure [ fig.1t_spec ]",
    "the absorption appears to be more pronounced in the inner annulus .",
    "these excess absorption and emission features are much too large to be explained by calibration error .",
    "the most significant calibration problem ever reported for the gain of the pspc is by @xcite who showed that the early versions of the software to convert pha ( pulse height analyzer ) to pi ( pulse invariant ) channels did not account for a gain deficit within a few arcminutes distance of the field center .",
    "this old problem only appeared in pi channels below 20 ( i.e. , below 0.2 kev ) and is now almost entirely removed with the most up - to - date software which we have used . in principle",
    "such an uncorrected gain deficit would appear as an absorption feature in our analysis below 0.2 kev which is clearly unrelated to both the excess emission between 0.2 - 0.4 kev and the absorption between 0.5 - 0.8 kev observed in figure [ fig.1t_spec ] .",
    "further testament to the reality of these features is that they are each manifested over an energy range comparable to the pspc resolution [ @xmath49 ; i.e. , in the notation of @xcite , who define resolved pspc energy bands , the 0.2 - 0.4 kev interval is essentially the r2 band while 0.5 - 0.8 kev is essentially the r4 and r5 bands .",
    "although it might be tempting to equate the soft excess in the 0.2 - 0.4 kev band with an error in the background subtraction , this can not be the case . the emission of the diffuse background in the _ rosat _ band does peak at these low energies ( e.g. , chen et al . 1997 ) and the temperature of gas required to explain the soft excess is consistent with the diffuse background ( see below in  [ 2 t ] ) .",
    "however , the background contributes only 0.6% of the 0.2 - 0.4 flux within the inner annulus , and thus only an ( impossible ) error of over two orders of magnitude in the background level could account for the excess 0.2 - 0.4 kev flux . only for the bounding annulus ( i.e. , annulus # 10 )",
    "is a relatively small background error required ( factor of @xmath50 ) to explain the excess soft emission .",
    "but we have taken care to account for detector response differences between background and source positions (  [ bkg ] ) . the statistical error on",
    "the background is @xmath51 and we estimate at most a 15% systematic error in the background level arising if we do not subtract the `` additional thermal component '' attributed to m87 (  [ bkg ] ) .",
    "hence , errors in the background subtraction can not explain the excess 0.2 - 0.4 kev emission .",
    "since the deviations from the 0nh_0fe model displayed in figure [ fig.1t_spec ] must be intrinsic to m87 , let us now examine whether adjusting the available model parameters can improve the fits .",
    "if is allowed to vary in the fits while keeping the fe abundance , , fixed ( i.e. , model 1nh_0fe in table [ tab.1 t ] ) then we obtain large improvements in the fits in all annuli ; the least amount of improvement is observed for annuli # 2 - 3 . although allowing to vary removes a large portion of the deviations over 0.2 - 0.4 kev the absorption feature over 0.5 - 0.8 kev remains essentially unaffected .",
    "the fitted values of ( r ) ( see figure [ fig.1 t ] ) are @xmath52 in most annuli with a maximum of @xmath53 in annulus # 2 .",
    "these values are still very significantly less than the galactic value when considering the 5%-10% underestimates arising from inaccuracies in the he cross sections ( see immediately before  [ std ] ) .",
    "these sub - galactic columns are also unaffected by possible errors in the plasma emission code ( mekal ) . since the fitted temperatures are always above 1 kev inaccuracies in the plasma code near energies 0.2 - 0.4 kev are negligible because at these temperatures the continuum dominates any neglected line emission which is the principal source of error ( e.g. , liedahl 1999 ) .",
    "if instead is allowed to vary but is held fixed at ( i.e. , model 0nh_1fe in table [ tab.1 t ] ) , then the fits are also improved though not quite so much as when is allowed to vary .",
    "the improvement in the fits is again confined to the lower energies ( 0.2 - 0.4 kev ) leaving the absorption deviations over 0.5 - 0.8 kev uncorrected .",
    "the sub - solar values of @xmath54 ( figure [ fig.1 t ] ) are consistent with those obtained from the previous _ asca _ studies of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "_ measurements of @xmath55 should be more reliable since they are determined primarily by the 6.5 kev fe k@xmath56 line complex in contrast to the _ rosat _ determinations using the @xmath57 kev fe l lines .",
    "the temperature measurements from _ asca _ and _ sax _ are also more reliable than those from _ rosat _ because of the much better energy resolution and the larger bandwidth . in figure [ fig.1 t ]",
    "one notices that for @xmath58 the model 0nh_1fe has @xmath59 kev which is very inconsistent with the temperatures obtained from _",
    "asca _ @xcite and _ sax _ @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if both and are varied ( i.e. , model 1nh_1fe in table [ tab.1 t ] ) then @xmath60 is consistent with _",
    "asca _ and _ sax _ but now is too large at all radii ( figure [ fig.1 t ] ) .",
    "this latter model also has fitted column densities that deviate from the galactic value even more significantly than the 1nh_0fe model discussed above .",
    "interestingly , when both and are varied significant improvement in the fits is also observed over 0.5 - 0.8 kev unlike when only one of these parameters is varied ( though the overall fit quality is still poor in all annuli except # 10 ) .",
    "hence , the single - phase model with a standard absorber is demonstrably a very poor fit to the _ rosat _ data .",
    "although improvements in the fits can be achieved by varying and the resulting fits are still poor , the column densities are significantly below the galactic value , and the fitted temperatures and abundances are not each consistent with the _ asca _ ( and _ sax _ ) data for any particular model . we are thus compelled to conclude that a single - phase gas modified by a standard galactic absorber can not describe the x - ray data of m87 .",
    "the striking residuals of excess absorption and emission apparent from visual inspection of the spectral fits of m87 ( figure [ fig.1t_spec ] ) provide strong support for the analogous ( but less obvious ) properties deduced from the lower s / n data of the individual elliptical galaxies and galaxy groups studied in paper1 and paper3 .",
    "an immediate result of critical importance is that since the data for energies below 0.5 kev do not lie below the 0nh_0fe model in figure [ fig.1t_spec ] , the low - energy pspc data unequivocally rule out any significant excess absorption from cold absorbing matter which has frequently been advocated in the past for cooling flows . instead",
    ", the absorption feature between 0.5 - 0.8 kev must arise from warm material as we have discussed extensively in paper1 and paper3 .",
    "because of the low energy resolution of _ rosat _ it is instructive first to analyze the hydrogen column density obtained for the standard cold absorber as a function of the chosen lower energy limit ( ) of the bandpass ( see  3.3 of paper3 )",
    ". that is , we fitted the model 1nh_0fe ( defined above ) to the pspc spectrum including only data having energies between @xmath61 and 2.2 kev .",
    "the results are displayed in figure [ fig.nhvsemin ] .",
    "when @xmath62 kev the fitted column density is always similar to or less than . as increases to @xmath63 kev",
    "we find that @xmath64 for @xmath65 and increases to @xmath66 for @xmath67 .",
    "this radially decreasing profile of column density becomes even more pronounced for larger values of ; e.g. , as shown in figure [ fig.nhvsemin ] for @xmath68 kev",
    "the outer annuli have @xmath69 whereas at smaller radii @xmath70 .",
    "this trend continues up to @xmath71 kev after which @xmath72 for @xmath73 kev within the increasingly larger uncertainties .    in order to quantify the `` warm '' absorption and yet simultaneously fit the entire _ rosat _ spectrum we follow our previous investigations of galaxies and groups ( paper1 and paper3 ) and model the intrinsic absorption with a single absorption edge represented as , @xmath74 $ ] for @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the rest - frame energy of the edge and @xmath77 is the optical depth .",
    "similar to the standard absorber we place the edge immediately in front of the source so @xmath77 is measured as a function of 2d radius @xmath45 .",
    "a rigorous treatment of the warm absorber would ( at least ) include a series of absorption edges from different ionization states of principally oxygen but also of carbon and nitrogen similar to the models described by @xcite that are currently not supported in xspec .",

    "we would like to fit a general emission model in order to determine the differential emission measure function which fully characterizes the temperature structure of the plasma .",
    "unfortunately , with detectors of low ( _ rosat _ ) and moderate ( _ asca _ ) energy resolution it is impossible to distinguish between different multiphase models .",
    "@xcite showed in particular that two - phase models can easily mimic a multiphase cooling flow spectrum of galaxies and clusters . and",
    "in section 5.3 of @xcite we showed that even with the higher resolution of _ asca _ the following multiphase models of galaxies all produced similar spectra : cooling flow , two - phase , and integrated single - phase temperature gradient ; similar results were obtained for groups in @xcite .",
    "( however , these very different multiphase models are each easily distinguished from isothermal models . )",
    "since the limited energy resolution of the pspc prevents a detailed exploration of different multiphase models our primary objective in this section is to quantify the emission of the warm gas at each radius .",
    "as in our previous studies we examine the multiphase hypothesis in terms of the simple cases of a constant - pressure cooling flow and a two - phase medium .",
    "these models are instructive since they have been widely used to interpret the x - ray spectra of galaxies and clusters .      in the inhomogeneous cooling flow scenario the hot gas",
    "is expected to emit over a continuous range of temperatures in regions where the cooling time is less than the assumed age of the system .",
    "we consider a simple well - studied model of a cooling flow where the hot gas cools at constant pressure from some upper temperature , @xmath92 ( e.g. , johnstone et al 1992 ) .",
    "the differential emission measure of the cooling gas is proportional to @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the mass deposition rate of gas cooling out of the flow , and @xmath95 is the cooling function of the gas ( in our case , the mekal plasma code ) .",
    "since the gas is assumed to be cooling from some upper temperature @xmath92 , the cooling flow model requires that there be a reservoir of hot gas emitting at temperature @xmath92 but is not cooling out of the flow .",
    "consequently , our cooling flow model actually consists of two components , cf+1 t , where `` cf '' is the emission from the cooling gas and `` 1 t '' is emission from the hot ambient gas .",
    "we set @xmath92 of the cf component equal to the temperature of the 1 t component , and both components are modified by the same photoelectric absorption .",
    "hence , the cooling flow model adds only one free parameter @xmath96 to those of the single - phase models .",
    "if only absorption from the standard cold absorber model is considered then we obtain results identical to the single - phase models in  [ std ] ; i.e. , the cf component is completely suppressed by the fits .",

    ", @xcite also conclude that a single - phase model is inadequate and that spatially extended intrinsic absorbing material is required . since , however , @xcite exclude data below 0.4 kev they do not detect the excess soft emission and thus are not led to conclude that the absorber must be warm .",

    "an alternative explanation ( due to the referee ) for the fpcs measurement is as follows .",
    "since the fpcs operated over a narrow energy band , if the absorption edges are confined to energies just below the k@xmath56 line they would not be seen by the fpcs .",

    "unfortunately , our single - edge absorption model is really just a phenomenological tool to establish the existence and to study the gross properties of the absorber which is appropriate for the low resolution of the pspc (  [ edge ] ) .",
    "as discussed in paper3 , when including additional edges the inferred optical depth for each edge decreases , and we expect several edges from different ionization states of oxygen ( also carbon and nitrogen ) to contribute . since the absorption of an edge is not linear in the energy of the edge ( i.e. , @xmath119 $ ] and @xmath120 if the edge energies @xmath121 ) , by spreading multiple edges over a large energy range one can produce the observed absorption with smaller total optical depth than can be achieved with a single edge .",
    "consequently , the single - edge optical depths should be considered upper limits .    nevertheless , to provide a convenient benchmark for comparison to paper3 and to related previous studies , we have computed the absorber masses by assuming the absorption edges correspond to ( see  5.3 of paper3 ) . using the single - phase model 1nh_0fe_e as an example , we find that within the central bin ( 5 kpc ) that the absorber mass is , @xmath122 ( @xmath109 errors ) which is about twice that of the hot gas , @xmath123 .",
    "the total values within 98 kpc are respectively , @xmath124 and @xmath125 ; i.e. , @xmath126 similar to that found for the galaxies and groups in paper3 .",
    "the amount of time required to accumulate @xmath127 assuming @xmath107 (  [ cf ] ) is @xmath128 ; i.e. , this absorbing material could reasonably have been accumulated by a cooling flow in agreement with the galaxies and groups in paper3 .",
    "if , as we expect , the absorber is the same material that gives rise to the excess 0.2 - 0.4 kev emission , then the above values of should be ( nearly ) the same as @xmath129 ; i.e. , the mass of the warm gas component of the two - phase models (  [ 2 t ] ) . however , there are two key problems with translating the results of  [ 2 t ] into values of @xmath129 . first , the temperatures of the warm components are 0.1 - 0.2 kev , and it has recently been emphasized that the current plasma codes ( including mekal ) can underestimate the emission around 0.2 kev by as much as a factor of 10 at these low temperatures because of neglected line emission ( liedahl 1999 ; beiersdorfer et al . 1999 ) .",
    "second , since the warm gas absorbs photons from the hot gas the assumption of collisional ionization equilibrium is also not strictly valid nor is it clear that the warm gas is fully optically thin to its own radiation as we have assumed for convenience ( with mekal ) .",
    "these problems are evident when we attempt to compare the emission measures ( @xmath130 of the warm gas component in the two - phase model to that implied by the values of quoted above from the oxygen edges .",
    "we find that , e.g. , in the central radial bin the emission measure implied by the oxygen edges is @xmath4 times that inferred for the warm gas component in the two - phase model .",
    "this discrepancy is probably exacerbated by the `` missing line '' problem in the plasma codes , but can be mitigated by consideration of the following .",
    "first , by including multiple edges in our fits we can reduce the total optical depth by factors of a few leaving a factor of @xmath131 discrepancy .",
    "second , if we consider the radiative transfer effects mentioned above ( i.e. , photoionization ) then the warm gas is over - ionized for its ( collisional ) temperature .",
    "the inferred ( collisional ) emission measure is very sensitive to the temperature , and if we reduce the 0.1 - 0.2 kev temperature by a factor of @xmath17 the discrepancy of emission measures can be fully mitigated .",
    "this exercise highlights the need for a more rigorous ( and complex ) treatment of the absorption and emission of the warm gas in order to deduce the mass of the absorber which is beyond the scope of our paper .",
    "if our basic results are confirmed with the substantially higher quality data from _ chandra _ and _ xmm _ , then it will be appropriate to expend the effort to construct rigorous models of the warm absorber accounting for many edges and possible radiative transfer effects that are not currently available in xspec .",
    "finally , it is also worth mentioning that ( these caveats aside ) the emission from the warm gas implied by our measurements does not violate published constraints in the fuv similar to that found for the the galaxies and groups in section 5.4 of paper3 . @xcite",
    "have reported results in the fuv for m87 obtained with the hopkins ultraviolet telescope ( hut ) .",
    "they obtain a @xmath132 upper limit of @xmath133 erg @xmath7 s@xmath8within @xmath28 of m87 for the flux of the ( 1034 ) line which is expected to be the strongest line associated with warm gas having temperatures between @xmath134 k. using quoted above we estimate that the strength of the line at the peak temperature of @xmath135 k ( e.g. , pistinner & sarazin 1994 ; voit & donahue 1995 ) is @xmath136 erg @xmath7 s@xmath8 .",
    "ignoring the fact that is over - estimated as discussed above , the hut constraint implies that the must be different from @xmath135 k. from examination of figure 7 of @xcite we see that the luminosity decreases very rapidly with increasing temperature .",
    "consequently , the emission implied by is consistent with the hut constraint provided that @xmath137 k.      various conflicting reports of the detection of excess euv ( 0.07 - 0.25 kev ) emission above that expected from the hot ( x - ray ) plasma have been reported in clusters of galaxies using data from the _ extreme ultraviolet explorer _",
    "( _ euve _ ) , but only for m87 does there appear to be a consensus among different groups of the reality of centrally concentrated excess euv emission ( lieu et al .",
    "1996 ; berghfer et al .",
    "if the excess _ euve _",
    "emission is interpreted as arising from optically thin collisionally ionized gas then @xcite and @xcite infer temperatures ( @xmath138 kev ) and total masses within @xmath139 ( @xmath140 ) , which ( considering the modeling differences between our studies ) are in good agreement with those values we have inferred from the _ rosat _ data .",
    "we mention that it has usually been reported that the _ euve _ `` soft excess '' of m87 increases with radius ( e.g , bonamente , lieu , & mittaz 2000 ) .",
    "this result depends on the definition of the model of the hot gas that serves as the reference for the excess .",
    "the radially increasing soft excess assumes that the reference model for the hot gas has been fitted to the pspc data using only data above 1 kev .",
    "if instead all the pspc data are included in the fit , then there is no significant trend for the soft excess with radius in the _ euve _ data ( r. lieu 2000 , private communication ) .",
    "this is consistent with our result for the two - phase models where the warm gas fraction is essentially constant for @xmath81 ( figure [ fig.2 t ] ) .",
    "various problems with a gas origin of the euv emission have been discussed by @xcite , in particular the need for some as - yet - undiscovered heat source to prevent the gas from rapidly cooling to lower temperatures .",
    "these problems have spurred many to explain the excess euv emission from other non - thermal processes ( see berghfer et al . 2000 and references therein )",
    ". however , an independent test of the hypothesis of warm ionized gas is offered by its absorbing effect on the hot x - ray plasma .",
    "our detection of absorption confined to energies 0.5 - 0.8 kev is precisely the signature expected from warm ( @xmath138 kev ) gas ( e.g. , krolik & kallman 1984 ) .    the results from _ euve _ , _ rosat _ , and _ asca _ for m87 form a coherent picture of a multiphase medium consisting ( approximately ) of a warm and hot phase : the emission from the warm gas is detected with _ euve _ and _ rosat _ while the absorption from the warm gas is detected in _ rosat _ and _ asca _ .      the warm ( @xmath1 k ) gas we have detected in both absorption and emission with",
    "which is consistent with both the excess absorption seen in _",
    "asca _ and the excess emission in _ euve _ , provides direct evidence for the material that may have cooled and dropped out of an inhomogeneous cooling flow ( e.g. , fabian 1994 ) .",
    "although the warm gas is consistent with the amount of matter that could have been deposited by a cooling flow (  [ mass ] ) , it is difficult to explain the warm gas phase as an equilibrium configuration because ( 1 ) the gas at @xmath141 k can not be thermally supported in the potential of m87 , and ( 2 ) the cooling time of this gas is very short ( see section 5.5 of paper3 ) .",
    "non - equilibrium models in the form of feedback from the central agn have been proposed to largely suppress cooling flows ( binney & tabor 1995 ; ciotti & ostriker 2000 ) . in the feedback model",
    "whenever the black hole accretes a sufficient amount of gas to stimulate nuclear activity , the accompanying radiation stimulated by the accretion heats up the hot gas and prevents further cooling .",
    "this is supposed to be a cyclical process such that the agn phase is sufficiently rare to be consistent with the lack of nuclear activity in most cooling flows .    the spectacular radio map of m87 published by @xcite shows that radio emission pervades the hot gas of m87 out to radii of @xmath142 .",
    "the distortions in the _ rosat _ x - ray contours present in annuli # 2 - 3 ( figure [ fig.m87 ] ) testify to the interaction of the radio emission associated with the jet and the hot gas @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of the radio emission of m87 in terms of the agn feedback model has been discussed by @xcite .",
    "our multiphase models of the _ rosat _ pspc data of m87 appear to support the picture of a standard inhomogeneous cooling flow that has been partially disturbed by the agn .",
    "we focus the reader s attention on the radial profiles of both for the cooling flow model in figure [ fig.cf ] and the emission - measure fraction of warm gas in two - phase models shown in figure [ fig.2 t ] .",
    "in particular , for the cooling flow models is consistent with a constant value for @xmath85 appropriate for a standard multiphase cooling flow .",
    "but for annuli # 2 - 4 ( i.e. , @xmath28 to @xmath143 ) is zero . over this region",
    "lies the asymmetrical features in the x - ray isophotes and the most prominent radio emission from the jet which would seem to support the notion that the agn has disturbed the cooling flow in this region . in the central bin ( @xmath144 )",
    "we do see significant cooling ( especially for the two - phase models ) which is not surprising since the relaxation and cooling times are shortest there , and thus it would be the first to readjust after the disturbance from the agn .",
    "it should be remembered that the scenario we have described has been based on the _ emission _ component of the warm gas .",
    "the absorption given by the optical depth of the single edge is essentially constant ( or declining slowly ) with increasing radius .",
    "consequently , although the agn may have inhibited the cooling of the warm gas in the central regions it apparently has not affected much the absorption properties of the gas . whether or not this is reasonable",
    "requires a more complex model of the warm absorber / emitter than we have employed in this paper ( see  [ mass ] ) .",
    "if this description is correct for m87 then it very likely applies to other cooling flows . in this case",
    "it will be critical to understand how this process evolves and how ubiquitous it is in cooling flow galaxies , groups , and clusters .",
    "from analysis of spatially resolved , deprojected _ rosat _ pspc spectra we find the strongest evidence to date for intrinsic oxygen absorption and multiphase gas in the hot ism / igm / icm of a galaxy , group , or cluster . when attempting to describe the 0.2 - 2.2 kev _",
    "emission of m87 by a single - phase hot plasma modified by standard galactic absorption the best - fitting model displays striking residuals in the spectrum ( figure [ fig.1t_spec ] ) : ( 1 ) excess emission above the model for 0.2 - 0.4 kev and ( 2 ) excess absorption below the model for 0.5 - 0.8 kev .",
    "these features are apparent out to the largest radii investigated ( @xmath145 kpc ) and can not be attributed to errors in the calibration or the background subtraction ( see  [ std ] ) .",
    "the principal result is that the 0.5 - 0.8 kev absorption is consistent with that of a collisionally ionized plasma with a temperature of @xmath134 k , where the lack of evidence of absorption below 0.5 kev strongly excludes the possibility of absorption from cold material as has been assumed in essentially all previous studies of absorbing material in cooling flows . in fact , the excess _",
    "emission _ observed between 0.2 - 0.4 kev , which is also manifested as sub - galactic column densities in models with standard ( cold ) absorbers (  [ single ] ) , has a temperature that is consistent with the emission from gas responsible for the 0.5 - 0.8 kev absorption and could not be explained if dust were responsible for both the absorption and soft emission .",
    "( see section 5.1 of paper3 for discussion of other problems with dust . )",
    "only multiphase models can provide good fits over the entire pspc bandpass while also yielding temperatures and fe abundances that are consistent with results from _ asca _ and _ sax _ at large radii (  [ multi ] ) .",
    "both cooling flow and two - phase models indicate that the fraction of warm gas with respect to the total emission measure differs qualitatively for radii interior and exterior to @xmath142 ( @xmath146 kpc ) .",
    "for @xmath58 the data are consistent with a constant ( or slowly varying ) fraction of warm gas as a function of radius .",
    "but for @xmath147 the warm gas fraction varies from @xmath80 within the central bin @xmath148 to essentially zero within the next few bins ( out to @xmath149 ) .",
    "this behavior is to be contrasted with the absorption optical depth profiles which are approximately constant with radius .",
    "the oxygen absorption and soft emission from warm ( @xmath134 k ) gas in m87 we have detected using the _ rosat _ pspc ( 0.2 - 2.2 kev ) is also able to satisfy the detections of excess emission with data at lower energies ( 0.07 - 0.25 kev ) from _ euve _ (  [ euv ] ) and the detection of excess absorption at higher energies ( 0.5 - 10 kev ) from _ einstein _ and _ asca _ (  [ mass ] ) .",
    "previous studies using only _ euve _ data ( e.g. , berghfer et al . 2000 ) could not decide between a non - thermal and thermal origin for the excess soft emission .",
    "similarly , the previous detections of absorption with _ einstein _ @xcite and _ asca _ @xcite could not constrain the temperature of the absorber and always assumed a cold absorber with solar abundances . even previous studies with _ rosat _ that neglected data below @xmath63 kev also could not constrain the temperature of the absorber ( allen & fabian 1997 ; sanders et al .",
    "2000 ) because of the strong dependence of the inferred absorption on the lower energy limit of the bandpass ( see our figure [ fig.1t_spec ] ) .",
    "hence , the _ rosat _ detection of intrinsic absorption that is localized in energy ( 0.5 - 0.8 kev ) is the key piece of evidence for establishing the presence of warm ( @xmath134 k ) gas distributed throughout ( at least ) the central 100 kpc .",
    "this evidence for a multiphase ism in m87 essentially confirms the original detection within the central @xmath2 using the _ einstein _ fpcs @xcite .",
    "however , instead of intrinsic oxygen absorption @xcite inferred a super - solar o / fe ratio which does not agree with subsequent analyses of m87 using other instruments . the anomalous o / fe ratio",
    "is probably attributed to either calibration error in the fpcs ( see tsai 1994 ) or to an underestimate of the continuum due to the absorption edges ( see end of  [ previous ] ) .",
    "although many previous studies have shown that the _ rosat _ data ( 0.1 - 2.4 kev ) of galaxy clusters rule out large quantities of cold absorbing gas in these systems ( e.g. , arabadjis & bregman 2000 ) , our spatial - spectral deprojection analyses of m87 in this paper and of a1795 in paper1 strongly suggest that large quantities of warm ( @xmath150 k ) gas are distributed ( at least ) throughout the central @xmath145 kpc of cluster cooling flows .",
    "the total mass of the warm gas implied by the oxygen absorption is consistent with the amount of matter deposited by an inhomogeneous cooling flow (  [ mass ] ) . on the other hand , the mass deposition profile ( figure [ fig.cf_tau ] ) and the profile of warm emission fraction of the two - phase models ( figure [ fig.2 t ] )",
    "indicate that the emission of the warm component is suppressed over @xmath151 where the radio emission from the agn jet clearly distorts the x - ray isophotes @xcite .",
    "this coincidence suggests that the agn has influenced the hot ism in these central regions and may have suppressed the cooling emission of the warm component (  [ feedback ] ; see binney 1999 ) . within the central arcminute",
    "the gas has apparently readjusted and is cooling while at large radii , @xmath58 , the cooling flow was not disturbed significantly by the agn .",
    "a hybrid model of a standard cooling flow with agn feedback seems promising for m87 .",
    "it is puzzling , however , why the oxygen absorption optical depth does not dip between @xmath152 as would be expected if the absorption and excess soft emission arise from the same material .",
    "perhaps this is a result of the simplifications we have employed in this investigation ( e.g. , see  [ mass ] ) , and with rigorous consideration of the radiative transfer and the absorption from several ionization states of oxygen ( and carbon and nitrogen ) a self - consistent description of the multiphase medium will be obtained .",
    "the highly significant detection of intrinsic oxygen absorption in the _ rosat _ pspc data of m87 confirms the picture of a multiphase warm+hot medium in cooling flows deduced from the lower s / n pspc data of galaxies and groups in paper1 and paper3 . with new",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm _ data the spatial distribution of the different phases can be mapped with novel accuracy , and thus the structure and evolution of cooling flows , and the role of agn feedback , will be elucidated .",
