    "<S> many weakly interacting sub - electronvolt particles ( wisps ) are easily accommodated in extensions of the standard model . </S>",
    "<S> generally the strongest bounds on their existence come from stellar evolution and cosmology , where to the best of our knowledge observations seem to agree with the standard budget of particles . in this talk </S>",
    "<S> i review the most demanding constraints for axions and axion - like - particles , hidden photons and mini - charged particles .    </S>",
    "<S> there is little doubt in the particle physics community about the need of complementing the already very successful standard model ( sm ) to pursue a completely satisfactory final theory of elementary particles . on the other hand , and with the exception of the dark matter </S>",
    "<S> , our increasingly precise knowledge of the universe shows no trace of physics beyond the sm . </S>",
    "<S> if new light particles exist they should be very weakly interacting , probably only accessible to extremely precise experiments . </S>",
    "<S> experiments such as the ones presented in this conference .    </S>",
    "<S> astrophysics and cosmology are often strong probes of weakly interacting particles . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is clear : the huge magnitudes of the typical sizes , time scales , densities or temperatures in the early universe or in stars can convert a tiny  microscopic \" effect in a big qualitative change in the evolution of the whole system . </S>",
    "<S> this conclusion is specially emphasized when we note that the only weakly interacting sub - ev particles ( wisps ) in the standard model are neutrinos , whose production cross sections are strongly energy - dependent and therefore their role is increasingly inhibited as temperatures drop below the electroweak scale . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in an non - extreme range of temperatures the early universe and stellar plasmas are very opaque to standard particles and wisps can be the most efficient way of energy transfer . whenever such an anomalous energy transfer has an observable implication we can derive strong constraints on the wisp interactions with the standard particles constituting the relevant plasma .    </S>",
    "<S> the oldest picture of the universe we have is a dense and hot plasma of elementary particles that expanded against gravity . as this plasma cooled down , </S>",
    "<S> the three long range forces clustered the particles into the structures which nowadays are found : the color force first confined quarks into protons and neutrons and later merged them into light nuclei ( at bbn ) , the coulomb force combined them with electrons into atoms ( releasing the cmb ) that gravity finally clustered into galaxies , then into clusters , etc ... after the first galaxies formed , the conditions for stars to be born were settled . during all these steps of structure formation ( in a broad sense ) </S>",
    "<S> the role of wisps can be constrained . </S>",
    "<S> let us start this review in chronological order . </S>",
    "<S> summary plots on the reviewed bounds are shown at the end of this contribution .    _ </S>",
    "<S> big bang nucleosynthesis.- _ bbn left an invaluable probe of the early universe environment imprinted in today s observable light nuclei abundances @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> below @xmath0 mev the weak reactions @xmath1 became ineffective , fixing the neutron / proton density ratio to @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> all particles present contribute to the energy density @xmath3 which determines the speed of the cosmic expansion @xmath4 and the  freeze - out \" ratio @xmath5 in turn . </S>",
    "<S> the larger @xmath6 the sooner the @xmath7-@xmath8 freezing and the higher @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> later , all neutrons are confined into @xmath9he nuclei whose primordial abundance can be measured today , leading to a bound on the non - standard energy density @xmath10 during bbn , usually expressed as an effective number of thermal neutrino species , @xmath11 @xcite , where we assumed three standard neutrinos .    therefore , while a spin - zero particle thermalized during bbn is allowed , this is not the case for other wisps like a mini - charged particle ( mcp ) ( @xmath12 ) or a massive hidden photon @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the interactions of mcps and @xmath13s with the standard bath should not allow thermalization before bbn . </S>",
    "<S> mcps @xmath15 are produced with a rate @xmath16 ( with @xmath17 the mcp electric charge ) while @xmath13s with @xmath18 with @xmath19 the standard compton scattering rate . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath20 is the effective @xmath21 mixing in the plasma , which for sub - ev @xmath13 masses is @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio of the @xmath13 mass to the plasma frequency @xmath23 is extremely small before bbn so it suppresses @xmath13 production with respect to other wisps . comparing with the expansion rate @xmath6 </S>",
    "<S> we find that mcps with @xmath24 would be allowed  @xcite but there are no significant bounds for hidden photons  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> _ cosmic microwave background.- _ the today s measured cmb features an almost perfect blackbody spectrum with @xmath25 angular anisotropies . </S>",
    "<S> it is released at @xmath26 ev but the reactions responsible of the blackbody shape freeze out much earlier , at @xmath27 kev . </S>",
    "<S> reactions like @xmath28wisp@xmath29 will deplete photons in a frequency dependent way , which can be constrained by the precise firas spectrum measurements  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this has been used to constrain light mcps  @xcite and hps with @xmath30 mev  @xcite . on the other hand , around @xmath27 </S>",
    "<S> ev the primordial plasma is so sparse that wisps would free - stream out of the density fluctuations , diminishing their contrast . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , thermal wisps contribute to the _ radiation _ energy density , delaying the matter - radiation equality and reducing the contrast growth before decoupling . in these matters </S>",
    "<S> they act as standard neutrinos  @xcite so @xmath10 ( and the couplings that would produce it ) can again be constrained from the value of @xmath31 inferred from analysis of cmb anisotropies and other with other cosmological parameters such as the dark matter density . ] </S>",

    "<S> bound ly-@xmath33 forest data has been deliberately omitted . </S>",
    "<S> ly-@xmath33 has systematically favored values of @xmath34 larger than zero @xcite which could be revealing the existence of a cosmic wisp relic density . </S>",
    "<S> if this anomaly is due to a population of @xmath13s created through resonant oscillations @xmath35 between bbn and the cmb decoupling it can be tested in the near future by new laboratory experiments such as alps at desy  @xcite .    _ bounds from stellar evolution.- _ the production of wisps in stellar interiors can substantially affect stellar evolution @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> wisps can be only scarcely produced in the dense plasmas of stellar interiors , but they will easily leave the star contributing directly to its overall luminosity . on the other hand , only photons of the photosphere ( or neutrinos ) contribute to the standard energy loss . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the wisp luminosity is enhanced at least by a volume / surface factor and a further @xmath36 ( @xmath37 a relevant particle density , @xmath38 ) with respect to the standard luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> this can be a huge enhancement which certainly justifies the typical strong constraints .    </S>",
    "<S> stars evolve fusing increasingly heavier nuclei in their cores . </S>",
    "<S> heavier nuclei require hotter environments , and when a nuclear species is exhausted in the core this slowly contracts and heatens up until it reaches the new burning phase . </S>",
    "<S> wisp emission shortens normal burning phases ( the energy loss rate is higher than standard but the total energy is limited by the number of nuclei ) but enlarges the intermediate ( red giant ) phases ( wisp cooling delays reaching the appropriate temperature during the core contraction ) .    these effects have been used to constraint a variety of wisps in different stellar environments  @xcite for which information on evolutionary time scales is available . </S>",
    "<S> the strongest limits for general axion - like - particles ( alps ) with a two photon coupling and mcps come from observations of horizontal branch ( hb ) stars in globular clusters ( gc )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for the standard qcd axions , the best constraints come from white dwarf cooling  @xcite through the coupling to electrons ( dfsv axions ) and from the duration of the sn1987a neutrino burst  @xcite through the nucleon coupling ( ksvz axions ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the sun is less sensitive than these other stars to wisp emission , even though its properties are better known . </S>",
    "<S> solar bounds have been obtained from studies of its lifetime , helioseismology and the neutrino flux  @xcite , but although more precise they are also less demanding . nevertheless , if wisps are emitted from the sun one can detect them with a dedicated laboratory experiment at earth  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one of the so - called helioscope axion searches  @xcite , cast , has recently beaten the hb constraints for alps with a two photon coupling  @xcite , and its results have been used to limit a possible solar @xmath13 flux  @xcite . following the now disclaimed  @xcite pvlas 2005 results  @xcite , specific models were recently built that suppress wisp emission from stars  </S>",
