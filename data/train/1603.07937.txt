    "the last 30 years has seen a lot of progress in understanding the collective behaviour of coupled oscillating dynamical systems , especially since the pioneering work of winfree  @xcite and the coupled phase oscillators of kuramoto  @xcite which has inspired many studies of criteria for synchronization and applications in a variety of areas , notably neuroscience @xcite ; see also  @xcite for reviews .",
    "most of the theoretical work has focussed on the continuum limit of large populations of various types of oscillator , and has been guided by large numerical simulations - see for example  @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , relatively small networks may show a lot of nontrivial and remarkable behaviour that will be present in larger networks .",
    "we consider a general system of  @xmath1 coupled _ identical _ phase oscillators as in @xcite but with a general coupling / phase interaction function @xmath0 : @xmath6 where @xmath7 represents the phase of the oscillators , @xmath8 the natural frequency of the oscillators and @xmath0 is the @xmath9-periodic smooth coupling function ( also called the phase interaction function ) .",
    "such systems arise naturally as approximations of coupled limit cycle oscillators in a weak coupling limit ; see for example @xcite .",
    "this case of identical oscillators is clearly highly symmetric - indeed , it is equivariant under the group of permutation symmetries @xmath10 acting by permutation of coordinates as well as being equivariant under translation along the diagonal @xmath11 - giving a symmetry group @xmath12 .",
    "some consequences of these symmetries have been studied in @xcite and subsequently in @xcite - tools from symmetric dynamics @xcite allow one to understand a lot of the behaviour of the system by looking at the action of the symmetry group on phase space . in particular , for any point in @xmath13 we associate the _ isotropy subgroup _ which is the subgroup @xmath14 . for each subgroup",
    "@xmath15 we can define the _ fixed point subspace _ @xmath16 ; it is a standard result from @xcite that for any @xmath17 , @xmath18 is dynamically invariant for any @xmath19-equivariant dynamical system .",
    "there is a twist in the story in that here  @xmath19 acts on the manifold @xmath20 rather than @xmath21 , giving rise to more non - trivial structures than expected from  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we also explore the presence of time - reversal symmetries @xcite for even @xmath2 .    in order to understand how ( [ eq : oscn ] ) may have complex spatio - temporal attractors of various symmetry types , we study this fully symmetric case for small @xmath1 and specific @xmath2 to gain an insight into the general case .",
    "for the case of kuramoto  sakaguchi coupling @xcite @xmath22 one can perform a detailed analysis of the general @xmath1 case and one finds either synchrony or antisynchrony are attracting , with the cases @xmath23 , @xmath24 giving special integrable structure  @xcite that corresponds to `` vertical branches '' at bifurcation .",
    "however , this sort of behaviour is highly degenerate for a general dissipative system .",
    "on addition of higher harmonics to the coupling function we expect , and usually find , that the degeneracies typically unfold into generic situations .",
    "indeed such higher harmonic terms are present in a generic system even near hopf bifurcation @xcite .",
    "a range of solutions , their stabilities and bifurcations , and the invariant subspaces imposed on phase space for the case of general  @xmath2 is discussed in  @xcite .",
    "this paper briefly reviews and then extends and applies some of these results in two contexts .",
    "the first aim of the paper is to consider the detailed bifurcation behaviour for the most generic two harmonic coupling function .",
    "this means we determine which degeneracies of   are unfolded by addition of the second harmonic , for the cases of @xmath25 . in doing",
    "so we extend the analysis in @xcite to the most general two harmonic coupling .",
    "the paper @xcite examines the cases @xmath26 and @xmath27 for ( [ eq : oscn ] ) and presents complete global bifurcation diagrams for the phase interaction function discussed in @xcite @xmath28 however , for this parametrized family the only even coupling functions are already in ( [ eq : ks ] ) . to next order @xcite",
    ", the generic lowest order terms will be of the form @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are arbitrary constants ( specific cases of such coupling was considered by  @xcite in the context of @xmath32 ) .",
    "more generally one can consider as in  @xcite @xmath33-harmonic coupling @xmath34 where , without loss of generality , we can assume @xmath35 , and ( [ eq : g2 ] ) corresponds to @xmath36 .",
    "the second aim of this paper is to consider the behaviour of the system ( [ eq : oscn ] ) for arbitrary , but even @xmath37 .",
    "following @xcite , we note there will be special structure in the dynamics , and a range of non - trivial recurrent dynamics appears for @xmath2 that are small perturbations of even functions",
    ". this has been illustrated by the observation of chaotic attractors @xcite and extreme sensitivity to detuning @xcite for fully symmetric systems of oscillators .",
    "indeed , chimera states @xcite for structured ( but not necessarily fully symmetric ) networks are usually found close to even coupling .",
    "we observe that there is zero divergence for ( [ eq : oscn ] ) and time - reversal symmetries for the system of phase difference ( though typically not for the original system ) .",
    "it is known there are @xmath4 independent smooth integrals of the motion for any @xmath38 for the special case @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "this still holds for general even @xmath2 and @xmath26 but , surprisingly , we show here that it does not hold for @xmath5 and general even @xmath2 : the flow is not fully integrable .    the paper is structured as follows : after discussing some parameter and phase symmetries , we recall the reduction of the dynamics to a canonical invariant region . in section  [ sec : bifs ] we summarise some stability properties and bifurcations of periodic orbits by symmetry type .",
    "section  [ sec : n34 ] applies this to general two harmonic coupling and @xmath26 or @xmath27 oscillators , extending the bifurcation analysis in @xcite to general second harmonic coupling .",
    "this includes a new characterization of bifurcation of two - cluster states as the discriminant of a certain polynomial equation .",
    "section  [ sec : oddeven ] examines some consequences of the coupling function @xmath2 itself being odd , or even for small @xmath1 .",
    "if @xmath2 is odd , it is known that the system for phase differences ( but not the original system ) has a variational structure and can be written as a gradient flow .",
    "if @xmath2 is even , there are additional time - reversal symmetries @xcite for the system for phase differences , as well as a zero divergence condition .",
    "we characterise the points with nontrivial time - reversal symmetries for @xmath26 and @xmath5 in detail .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : discuss ] considers the relation between even coupling and integrability . for @xmath26 and general even @xmath2 , or for @xmath40 and @xmath39",
    "it is known since @xcite that there are @xmath4 independent integrals of the motion .",
    "this constrains the dynamics for @xmath40 to be at most two - frequency quasiperiodic .",
    "we show this is not the case for @xmath40 and more general even @xmath2 : for examples with @xmath5 and @xmath2 with @xmath41 harmonics , we find structures that respect the time - reversal symmetries , but that can not appear in a fully integrable structure .",
    "we discuss this , and highlight some open questions .",
    "if we consider general two harmonic coupling of the form ( [ eq : g2 ] ) , the case ( [ eq : hmm ] ) considered in @xcite corresponds to @xmath42 , @xmath43 .",
    "we wish to understand the behaviour of ( [ eq : oscn],[eq : g2 ] ) on varying the parameters @xmath44 there are parameter symmetries ( such that @xmath45 for all @xmath46 ) @xmath47 using ( [ eq : parsym1 ] ) and rescaling time by a positive scaling , we assume from hereon that @xmath42 : using ( [ eq : parsym2 ] ) we can assume from hereon that @xmath48 .",
    "we choose @xmath42 to give easy comparability to @xcite .",
    "there is a time - reversal parameter symmetry ( such that @xmath49 for all @xmath46 ) , assuming @xmath42 this is @xmath50 by classifying qualitative dynamics up to time - reversal , we will can reduce to parameters in the region @xmath51 in the later bifurcation analyses ; using ( [ eq : timerev ] ) we can classify for @xmath52 .",
    "finally , there is a phase - reversal parameter symmetry ( i.e. such that @xmath53 for all @xmath46 ) , assuming @xmath42 this is @xmath54 this means in principle we can reduce to ( [ eq : qrab ] ) with @xmath55 $ ] and apply phase and time reversal as necessary .",
    "because the dynamics of ( [ eq : oscn ] ) depends only on phase differences , one can usefully reduce the dynamics from a flow on @xmath20 to one on @xmath56 which represents only the phase differences .",
    "this corresponds to looking at the quotient dynamics of the system on the @xmath57-orbits .",
    "more precisely , if we consider a projection @xmath58 that maps the @xmath57-orbits onto points and consider @xmath59 , the original system ( [ eq : oscn ] ) becomes a reduced system on @xmath56 of the form @xmath60 this clearly depends on @xmath2 and @xmath1 but not on @xmath8 .",
    "there are several ways to choose @xmath61 , or , equivalently , a set of  @xmath62 phase differences @xmath63 that span the set of all phase differences . however , permutation symmetry will never act orthogonally on such a set of phase differences if @xmath38 , meaning that symmetries are not obvious from plots of phase differences . for @xmath26 and @xmath5",
    "there is a useful representation introduced by  @xcite that avoids this problem .",
    "if we examine an orthogonal projection of the dynamics onto a codimension one subspace orthogonal to the diagonal @xmath11 , this will carry an orthogonal ( and irreducible ) representation of  @xmath64 on @xmath65 , the covering space of  @xmath56 .",
    "in addition , the complement of fixed point subspaces where two of the phases are identical ( isotropy  @xmath66 ) forms a partition of  @xmath65 into connected components that are all images of the _ canonical invariant region _ ( or cir ) @xcite .",
    "this is the set @xmath67 whose boundary consists of points with  @xmath66 isotropy .",
    "there is a residual symmetry @xmath68 @xmath69 on  @xmath70 generated by @xmath71 note that  @xmath72 with @xmath73 is the only fixed point of the action of  @xmath74 in  @xmath70  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : cir ] illustrates the @xmath70 for the cases @xmath26 and @xmath5 - the boundaries of @xmath70 are invariant for dynamics governed by ( [ eq : oscn ] ) for any coupling function @xmath2 , though they may not be invariant for arbitrarily small perturbations that make the @xmath2 or the @xmath8 different for different oscillators - in this case we may have _ extreme sensitivity to detuning _",
    "nonetheless , even in this case the trajectory will remain most of the time in one image of the cir , and the dynamics can usefully be understood as being a perturbation of the highly symmetric case .     for @xmath26 and @xmath5 .",
    "panels  ( a , c ) show  @xmath70 ( shaded ) in terms of the phase differences @xmath75 and  ( b , d ) as an orthogonal projection of the diagonal into  @xmath76 and  @xmath77 , respectively .",
    "the edges of  @xmath70 for ( a , b ) and the faces of  @xmath70 for ( c , d ) are points with  @xmath66 isotropy .",

    "particularly important are _ @xmath84-cluster states _ which correspond to states where for some partition of @xmath85 there are precisely @xmath86 oscillators at the same phase , for some @xmath87 ( the number of clusters ) and @xmath88 ( the size of the @xmath89th cluster ) .",
    "these correspond to fixed point subspaces for isotropy groups @xmath90 .",

    "first , the equations  , may have more equilibria that depend on the coupling function chosen . as these lie in  @xmath257",
    "they have symmetric stability properties .",
    "second , the equilibria that are not contained in  @xmath257 appear to play an important role and yield a mechanism that could give rise to complex heteroclinic networks in the system .",
    "for example , assume that  @xmath337 is a hyperbolic equilibrium with trivial isotropy .",
    "since the vector field is divergence free , the equilibrium has to be a saddle .",
    "suppose that @xmath338 has one - dimensional stable and two - dimensional unstable manifold .",
    "the action of symmetries and time - reversal implies that there are  @xmath1 symmetric copies of  @xmath338 . at the same time",
    ", there are  @xmath1 copies with inverse stability properties that are given by the group orbit of  @xmath339 .",
    "an intersection of the unstable manifold of  @xmath338 with  @xmath295 or  @xmath296 yields a heteroclinic connection to an equilibrium related by the time - reversal symmetry .",
    "such a heteroclinic connection may have trivial isotropy ( given the way @xmath295 and  @xmath296 subdivide the cir into connected components ) or nontrivial isotropy , depending on where this intersection takes place . in this way",
    ", a network between the ( symmetrically and reversing symmetry related ) copies of @xmath338 may be formed .",
    "as noted in for @xmath26 and arbitrary even coupling function , there is @xmath340 constant of the motion , in agreement with the case for kuramoto coupling @xcite .",
    "it is natural to consider whether there are @xmath4 independent constants of the motion for @xmath5 and arbitrary even coupling function .",
    "if this was the case , the only invariant sets would be two frequency quasiperiodicity .",
    "although  @xcite and the presence of time - reversal symmetries might hints this might be the case , we present evidence there is at most one integral of the motion for @xmath5 .",
    "in particular , for @xmath5 and the states with @xmath66 isotropy on the boundary of @xmath70 , figure  [ fig : n4nonintegrable ] demonstrates that for the case @xmath5 and even coupling functions with up to four harmonics of the form   are not fully integrable . in cases ( c ) , ( d ) of the figure , we argue there are no nontrivial smooth integrals of the motion within the @xmath66 subspace , owing to the appearance of sink / source pairs .",
    "we only find such evidence of nonintegrable behaviour if @xmath341 and @xmath342 are non both zero : if @xmath341 and @xmath342 are both zero ( only two harmonics ) then there are apparently no equilibria within @xmath66 that are not fixed by a time reversal symmetry and the phase portraits are consistent with the presence of a smooth constant of the motion .",
    "it is still possible that there is one integral of the motion for the case @xmath5 and general even coupling , as long as this integral is zero on the boundary of the canonical invariant region , and the trajectory shown in figure  [ fig : n4space ] is consistent with this .",
    "oscillators show a wide range of continua of heteroclinic cycles on the boundary of  @xmath70 . here",
    "we show a face of the cir with  @xmath66 isotropy , assuming even  @xmath2 with the first four harmonics given by  .",
    "dashed black lines are points with @xmath79  isotropy foliated with fixed points and gray lines indicate  @xmath257 .",
    "for equilibria , triangles are saddles , circles are centres , open squares are sources , and filled squares are sinks ; these points are degenerate on the dashed line with  @xmath79 isotropy which corresponds to  @xmath335 with transversal stability given by  .",
    "observe that four our choice of  @xmath343 , @xmath344 , all equilibria lie within  @xmath257 if @xmath345 , but there are sink / source pairs ( indicating lack of integrability ) for cases where one of them is non - zero .",
    "[ fig : n4nonintegrable ] , width=566 ]      we finish by highlighting some open questions raised in this paper .",
    "firstly , we note that addition of the second harmonic does unfold many degeneracies , though not all .",
    "we note that there may be some that are still present for ( [ eq : oscn ] ) even for coupling functions with an infinite number of harmonics present , and these will disappear on considering more general coupling that is not of `` pairwise '' type ( see @xcite ) .",
    "there seems to be a subtle interplay of the order  @xmath1 , the symmetries of  @xmath2 and the number of harmonics  @xmath33 that determine the dynamics .",
    "extending a bifurcation analysis to higher  @xmath1 will be harder than extending to higher  @xmath33 , but the latter seems worthwhile especially if it is possible to determine the location of global bifurcations .",
    "we do extend the bifurcation analysis here in part analytically , using the special form of the coupling function to write the bifurcations of two - cluster in polynomial form .",
    "potentially this can be extended to more general cluster states , though at the expense of ever more complex expressions . as an alternative approach , rather than doing a bifurcation analysis for fixed  @xmath33 , one could conversely ask whether some harmonics are crucial for specific bifurcations to occur .",
    "the dynamics for the case of an even coupling function shows remarkable subtlety .",
    "numerical experiments show a variety of periodic orbits which can be quite complicated in examples of even coupling functions where a higher harmonic dominates ; cf .  figure  [ fig : n4space ] .",
    "although we demonstrate in the previous section that one can not expect there to be fully integrability with  @xmath4 independent constants of the motion  ( * ? ?",
    "* theorem , p249 ) , there may well be one constant of the motion in the general even coupling case which we have not yet been able to determine .    for even coupling we demonstrate for @xmath346 that the set of phases with time - reversal symmetry within the canonical invariant region is a nontrivial ( typically noninvariant ) set that organizes the dynamics .",
    "complicated dynamics , such as chimera states  @xcite and chaotic dynamics  @xcite ( and as a consequence also the chaotic weak chimeras constructed in  @xcite ) , typically arise in systems for small perturbations away from a system with time - reversal symmetry .",
    "we anticipate that understanding these heteroclinic networks in greater detail will shed light on how complicated arise in networks of coupled phase oscillators .",
    "naturally , the more equilibria there are , the more intricate the heteroclinic network can be .",
    "thus , deriving conditions for the existence of equilibria depending on the coupling function seems like a first step to understand the dynamics for even coupling functions  @xmath2 .",
