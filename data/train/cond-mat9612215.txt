    "much , if not most , of the progress in describing theoretically the complex physics of high - temperature superconductors and strongly correlated electrons has been achieved using numerical methods,@xcite while analytical methods have been rather approximate and not often checked against numerical data .",
    "a simple and transparent analytical or semianalytical model can however be very valuable by providing physical insights for _ understanding _ in addition to describing the system and by being easily extendible to other problems .",
    "currently this is the role of the so - called self - consistent born approximation,@xcite which provides a fairly good description of the undoped model .",
    "more accurately , in this method @xmath0 the model is expressed in terms of holons and bosons@xcite ; then @xmath1 the boson part is solved to leading order in @xmath2 ( spin - wave theory ) ; and finally @xmath3 the interacting holon - boson system is solved numerically using leading - order diagrams .",
    "( for points @xmath4 and @xmath5 , higher - order terms / diagrams have been analyzed by liu and manousakis.@xcite )    in this publication i report a study of the model in a different scheme",
    ". the hilbert space of holons and bosons is expanded , so that they are no longer constrained by each other .",
    "another important difference is that the fermionic green s function in the expanded model corresponds directly to the green s function of fermions in the original model .",
    "numerical results are then obtained for the model on the square lattice at half - filling .",
    "for the first and simplest stage of analysis in the new representation , it is suggested to use mean - field treatment for zero- and two - magnon terms in the hamiltonian .",
    "the effective model obtained this way , consisting of interacting holes and spin waves , is the same as in the usual constrained representation with the constraint ignored except for the presence of a bare hole dispersion due to the hole moving by eating away spin fluctuations present in the ground state . solving the equations of motion for one hole in the self - consistent born approximation",
    ", i find a fairly good agreement with numerical results for all analyzed quantities , such as the bandwidth and the band structure , and for all parameter regimes .",
    "the two - hole problem is also studied using the leading - order , noncrossing diagrams , demonstrating again viability of the method albeit much less convincingly .    in the following sec .",
    "[ sec : transform ] , i describe the discussed formulations of the model .",
    "then , in sec .  [ sec : results ] the obtained results for single- and two - hole problems",
    "are compared against the available numerical data and against the results obtained in the usual slave - fermion representation .",
    "the report ends with a summary ( sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] ) .",
    "the familiar hamiltonian is @xmath6 where the notation is standard with the addition that , both here and throughout the paper , @xmath7 , @xmath4 , and @xmath8 refer to any , spin - up , and spin - down sublattice sites , respectively ( @xmath7 as a subindex is not to be confused with the electron number operators @xmath9 ) .",
    "the square lattice is implied , although much of the discussion is independent of this .",
    "recently , an extra @xmath10 term describing next - nearest - neighbor hopping is usually added to the model.@xcite this study however , being mainly for demonstrative and comparative purposes , is restricted to the original model eq .",
    "( [ eq : htj ] ) .    the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ eq : htj ] ) is written without the commonly included electron projection operators on the understanding that , instead , the hilbert space is restricted to no double electron occupancy ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : hilbert ] ) .",
    "it also goes without saying that the `` electrons '' of the model are in fact zhang - rice singlets.@xcite      to disentangle the hamiltonian , the main degrees of freedom must be identified and suitable operators introduced .",
    "intuitively , spin fluctuations and mobile holes are the main underlying objects .",
    "it was , to the best of the author s knowledge , schmitt - rink , varma , and ruckenstein@xcite who first proposed to represent the system as a combination of a spinless - fermion ( holon ) field and a boson field . in this slave - fermion representation ,",
    "the electron operators are written as @xmath11 and the hilbert space of holons @xmath12 and bosons @xmath13 is constrained by @xmath14 .",
    "we can think of bosons @xmath13 as the schwinger bosons of some spin field @xmath15 , which in this case corresponds directly to the physical spin , @xmath16 .",
    "this spin field @xmath15 can also be of course represented by another type of bosons , such as the bosons @xmath17 of the holstein - primakoff or dyson - maleev transformation .",
    "the entire system is then represented in terms of operators @xmath12 and @xmath17 ( in the normally implied case of antiferromagnetic order the bosonic operators @xmath17 are different on the two sublattices ) . the hilbert space is constrained in this case by @xmath18 .",
    "finally , the spin field @xmath15 can be present directly rather than via bosons .",
    "this corresponds to what was done in ref .   and is described here in some detail since it is closer to the model presented later .",
    "the model hilbert space fig .",
    "[ fig : hilbert ] is mapped onto the one in fig .",
    "[ fig : holonhilbert ] . at any site @xmath7",
    ", there can be a holon @xmath12 and there is _ always _ a spin @xmath15 .",
    "a `` normal , '' that is containing one electron , site is thought of as having no holon , while the spin field on such site is identified with the physical electron spin , @xmath19 for @xmath20 .",
    "an empty site is considered to have one holon .",
    "the spin @xmath15 on such a site is a dummy , or a ghost ",
    "it is unphysical .",
    "we choose to make it _ up _ if the site is on the spin - up sublattice and _ down _ otherwise .",
    "this choice is arbitrary and is motivated by the ising limit .",
    "the relations for operators are as follows .",
    "the physical spin is @xmath21 .",
    "the electron operators are @xmath22 and @xmath23 for the spin - up sublattice and @xmath24 and @xmath25 for the spin - up sublattice .",
    "the hamiltonian is then in this representation ( ignoring spin projection operators ) @xmath26 again , we have an inhomogeneous hilbert space , in which a spin deviation and a holon can not coexist on a site .",
    "this transformation can be generalised to @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is some spin transformation with appropriate properties .",
    "the representations described so far constitute big progress relative to the `` raw '' model . in such analytical representations , by use of the half - filled state as the background",
    ", most correlations present in the system are already taken into account . due to fermion statistics",
    ", it is automatically guaranteed that not more than one holon can be on a site .",
    "however there are also problems .",
    "\\(1 ) the first one is the constraint , which any not overly complicated wave functions can hopefully satisfy only on average . of course",
    ", we may `` get rid '' of the constraint by introducing into the hamiltonian projection operators , but then the hamiltonian becomes complicated .",
    "it will then have some artificial complicated terms of purely `` kinematic '' origin .",
    "\\(2 ) the second disadvantage is that the holon operators in these representations only approximately correspond to the original electron operators .",
    "indeed , @xmath29 is defined differently on different sublattices , so that @xmath30 is not the same as @xmath31 but rather is a combination of @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "it is then necessary to do additional calculations to find the green s function of operators @xmath33 ( see ref .   and also the appendix of ref .  ) .",
    "physically , both points ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are related to ground - state quantum spin fluctuations and dissappear completely for a classical nel background .",
    "in fact even for the quantum nel background as long as _ linear _ spin - wave theory is used , the constraint can be formally ignored .",
    "both problem however get quickly more dramatic as antiferromagnetic order is weakened , which is known to happen in copper oxides .",
    "there is also a problem with analyzing the spin field by itself .",
    "spin - wave theory is certainly only approximate and has its limitations .",
    "however that is a general problem of condensed - matter physics rather than a problem with any particular representation of the model .",
    "it is possible to study the model in a substantially different representation .",
    "the central idea is to relax the constraint , so that when there is a hole on a site the ( ghost ) spin on that site can have _ any _ value .",
    "this is a big step .",
    "the new hilbert space has four states per site instead of three in the original model . instead of being able to have strictly a holon _ or _ a boson",
    ", we can have a holon _ and/or _ boson .",
    "thus we have essentially a different , a bigger model .",
    "no one - to - one transformation is taking place .",
    "( it has in fact been claimed recently@xcite using symmetry arguments that it is impossible to transform the model to a model of commuting fermions and spins . )",
    "we may still call the new model a `` representation '' of the model in the sense of group theory ( a reducible representation ) .",
    "two of the states in the new model , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , correspond to one state in the original model , @xmath36 .",
    "the correspondence for spin operators is as simple as before , @xmath37 .",
    "it is also clear that a hole remains a hole . for single - fermion operators",
    "there is however no simple relation .",
    "we are free to define the dynamics of the ghost spin in new model  one can think of it as choosing the gauge .",
    "( the dynamics of the nonghost spin should , of course , be the same as in the original model . ) for example , we can choose the hopping part of the hamiltonian to have the following form , @xmath38 here @xmath39 is a nonghost spin , and so it should just hop without flipping .",
    "we have chosen that the ghost spin , @xmath40 , also simply hops .",
    "the ghost spin is thus permanently attached to the hole .",
    "note that it is important here to consider hopping as a single elementary process , not as a combination of two processes of destruction and creation of the hole .",
    "the complete hamiltonian , when written in terms of spin operators , is then @xmath41 the subindex @xmath42 at @xmath43 emphasises that this hamiltonian is not the hamiltonian .",
    "@xmath44 is different from @xmath45 , it acts in a different hilbert space , in a hilbert space that it is not even isomorphic to the hilbert space of the hamiltonian .",
    "nevertheless @xmath46 has been constructed in such a way that the properties in the model can be simply derived from the properties in the `` @xmath47-@xmath48 '' model .",
    "the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ eq : hwangrice ] ) has been derived by wang and rice.@xcite however i believe that their method of derivation is doubtful and their interpretation is different in that they claim to have an exact expression of the model ( _ i.e. _ a one - to - one transformation ) . in any case , there have been no calculation in this representation .    the spin - fermion interaction in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hwangrice ] ) is of a very natural form for spinless fermions .",
    "the fermion propagates either by emitting and absorbing two magnons or directly by using fluctuations present in the ground state .",
    "the opposite cases of completely antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic order are naturally covered .",
    "although quite simple and very symmetric , this model is relatively difficult to study because it leads to two - magnon processes .",
    "below , the model with ghost - spin dynamics defined in a different way will be analysed .",
    "the dynamics of the ghost spin at hopping processes is defined by the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : processes ] . the logic behind these relatively complicated rules is clarified in appendix  [ sec : appendix ] where an ising - type situation is considered .",
    "the intention is to have two - magnon - type interaction for the relatively - infrequent interaction with ground - state fluctuations but single - magnon for creating fluctuations .",
    "now it is time to see if the problems ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) of the slave - fermion representation have been answered .",
    "\\(1 ) it is important that there are now no boson - fermion constraints , the two fields are interacting dynamically but are _ kinematically _ completely free from each other .",
    "their might be constraints on the bosons when the spin field @xmath15 is expressed through them .",
    "however this is a constraint , _",
    "e.g. _ , from spin - wave theory and it concerns bosons alone .",
    "the new model does not solve the problem of magnetic order as such , but it does separate it from the total problem .",
    "\\(2 ) to prove that the properties of fermions in this model are equal to the properties of holes in the model , consider the following argument .",
    "let us set _ at photoemission processes _ the following correspondence : @xmath49 and @xmath50 and likewise for hermitian conjugates .",
    "that is to say that creation of a hole is represented as creation of a holon and , importantly , the spin on the site remains unchanged ( we may say that it turns from a nonghost one to a ghost one ) . at subsequent hoppings the ghost spin changes according to the rules outlined above ; the physics should be independent of this .",
    "then we have @xmath51 and it is easy to see that there will be a direct relation for green s functions .",
    "the holon is now in _ some _ sense a symmetric mixture of spin - up and spin - down holes",
    ".    it should be also possible to introduce spin - carrying holes",
    ". the hilbert space would be the direct product of the space of @xmath52 and @xmath53 ( coexistence forbidden ) and of spin @xmath15 .",
    "however it is unclear if such a version would give any advantages .      at this point",
    "the hamiltonian has only become more complicated .",
    "the important point however is that it can now be simplified significantly without loosing much accuracy .",
    "fortunately , having numerical data allows to quickly test if this is so , at least in simple situations .",
    "the guidance for the simplifications is that the spin fluctuations in the ground state are present in small numbers .",
    "the well - known@xcite characteristics of the nel ground state are the staggered magnetization , @xmath54 and the nearest - neighbor spin correlator , @xmath55    the first two processes in fig .",
    "[ fig : processes ] describe the hole propagating by emitting and absorbing spin waves .",
    "these processes are the same as known for the slave - fermion scheme and i treat them to leading order in @xmath2 .",
    "the last two processes of fig .",
    "[ fig : processes ] describe the hole moving `` friction - free , '' by using the liquid component of the nel state . in these terms",
    "i replace spin combinations by their expectation values ( _ i.e. _ do a mean - field / hartree - fock procedure where the inverse influence of the holes on the spin field is ignored ) . a relationship required here",
    "is @xmath56    in the following , the following standard notation is used , @xmath57 is the coordination number , @xmath58 is the number of sites on the lattice , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 .    with the described simplifications and after fourier transformations ,",
    "the effective hamiltonian is [ eq : hfinal ] @xmath62 the first term here , as a noticeable difference from the unconstrained case , is a bare fermion dispersion @xmath63 the next two terms , describing spin waves with dispersion @xmath64 and interaction between holes and spin waves , are the same as in the slave - fermion case",
    ". the vertex function can be ( conveniently ? ) written as @xmath65 ^{1/2}.\\ ] ] the last term , with @xmath66 may be called a `` contact '' interaction as it describes instantaneous attraction of holes on hearest - neighbor sites ( easily recognized to be due to the `` broken - bond '' mechanism ) .",
    "this interaction is also present in the slave - fermion case but is usually omitted since it is negligible in the usually considered regime of @xmath67 and completely irrelevant in the single - hole problem .",
    "the effective model does not cover , obviously , the extreme nagaoka case of @xmath68 and the high - energy physics .",
    "it is trivially seen that the slave - fermion model is recovered when switching off the bare hole dispersion .",
    "the linear - in-@xmath69 hole dispersion in the static limit has been known for some time.@xcite it may be obtained directly by calculating the amplitudes @xmath70 and remembering to normalize hole operators .",
    "what is remarkable is that this effect can be added `` linearly '' to the spin - wave - emission mechanism .",
    "to find the single - hole green s function given the effective hamiltonian eqs .",
    "( [ eq : hfinal ] ) it appears natural to use the same self - consistent born approximations that has been used in the slave - fermion case .",
    "the first crossing diagram fig .",
    "[ fig : crossing ] is prohibited by kinematic reasons ( it may be seen when the two - sublattice formalism is used that the spin wave emitted when the hole jumps from sublattice @xmath71 to sublattice @xmath72 must be absorbed when the hole jumps from sublattice @xmath72 back to @xmath71 ) .",

    "other quantities , such as the structure of the spectral function , were in good agreement too .",
    "note also that since no account has been taken of small - cluster specifics , such as a slightly different magnetic order and a relatively large influence of the hole on the spin order ( very roughly speaking , one hole on a @xmath76 lattice constitutes a sizeable @xmath77 doping ) , it may be conjectured that the method is even more accurate than may be suggested by the given comparison . that the agreement is not an artifact of",

    "[ fig : band16 ] , where the dispersion relation is compared to that obtained@xcite by the green s function monte carlo method on the @xmath78 lattice . in examining the accuracy",
    "it should also be remembered that physically the low - energy part of the band is most important ( the close agreement for the quasiparticle residue at the band bottom is thus most encouraging ) .",
    "since the computational load is quite low , it is easy to move on to fairly large lattices .",
    "finite - size effects per se almost disappear starting from the @xmath79 lattice .",
    "the main drawback of small clusters seems to be a lack of resolution in @xmath80 space ( however in the case of dispersion , which is a very smooth function , it can be mostly overcome by using trigonometric - function fits ) .",
    "the dispersion relation calculated on a @xmath81 lattice is shown in figs .  [",
    "fig : band32 ] and  [ fig : band3d ] . of course , the most notable difference from previous slave - fermion studies is that there is no degeneracy between @xmath80 and @xmath82 . in the low - energy part of the band",
    "there is now an extended nearly flat region near @xmath83 .",
    "this is in agreement with the experimental angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) data and is probably key to explaining some of the experimental properties of the cuprates.@xcite    another effect observed in the results is that the band minimum slightly shifts away from @xmath84 towards @xmath85 while the maximum splits , moving from @xmath86 in the direction of @xmath83 and @xmath87 .",
    "using various lattices and supplementing it with interpolation by means of trigonometric - functions fits , i found the minimum to be at @xmath88 for @xmath89 and at @xmath90 for @xmath91 .",
    "higher - order terms will probably lead to a renormalization of the values of @xmath69 and @xmath92 , similar to what was found in the slave - fermion case.@xcite in the present study , the shape of the dispersion is almost the same in a fairly wide parameter range and is presumably very accurate but the absolute numbers may change .      as a further test of the method s usefulness , i applied it to the two - hole problem .",
    "many issues that come up here are the same as in the many - body problem and , again , availability of some numerical data makes it a good opportunity to test viability and/or accuracy of the diagrammatic approach in a context more complex than the single - particle one . to the best of the author s knowledge , no such test has been made in the framework of the slave - fermion approach either and i believe this problem must be definitively solved analytically before attacking the many - body problem .",
    "all the following consideration is restricted to pairs with total momentum zero .",
    "the bound state is found by solving the bethe - salpeter equation @xmath93 where @xmath94 is half the total energy ( _ i.e. _ the energy _ per hole _ ) .",

    "the frequency cutoff was typically @xmath100 .",
    "although despite appearances the structure of the vertex allows fft over momenta as well , doing so in practice involves fairly large overheads and small lattices are solved faster by direct summation in @xmath80 space , using all available symmetries .",
    "the bound state energy is found as the @xmath94 at which ( the real part of ) the largest eigenvalue for a given symmetry becomes equal to 1 ( the imaginary part was kept under @xmath101 and its negligible influence was verified ) .",
    "the binding energy per pair is then @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is the minimum single - hole energy ( for consistency , this must be found from the momenta actually available on the cluster instead of by interpolation or by using the bulk limit result ) .",

    "the results , presented in fig .  [ fig : binding ] , show a maybe - satisfactory agreement with numerical data .",
    "the dependence of binding energy on @xmath105 is noticeably different .",

    "a more accurate approximation is to take into account holes velocity but assume a static green s function , @xmath108 this approach , used in several studies of the model,@xcite is based on the following argument .",

    "the easy way out is to fully employ the ghost spin by forcing it flip when necessary , thus carrying much more information and doing much more work .",
    "figure  [ fig : thebigone ] illustrates the motion of a hole as described by the new conventions .",
    "the direction of the ghost spin effectively indicates whether any encountered spin flip could have been created by the hole back in time or if it is a background spin fluctuation . in the latter case",
    ", the hole advances to the next site free  no strings attached .",
    "another potential reason for discrepancy is more subtle .",
    "consider for example the case of @xmath119 .",
    "in solving the problem analytically , it is easy to generate a very large number of virtual spin waves , while in fact physically it is clear that the number has to be less than the number of lattice sites .",
    "the diagrammatic approach is inherently for the bulk limit , which means that a direct comparison is not always possible .",
    "the actual criterion for agreement should be then that when no finite size effects are found in numerical data , then the results must agree .",
    "otherwise the procedure is undefined , and some conclusions can only be drawn indirectly .",

    "<S> the report discusses the slave - fermion representations of the model and describes another representation , in which fermions and bosons are completely commuting and in which the properties of fermions are directly related to the properties of physical holes . for a study of the system in the new representation at half - filling , interaction of fermions with two magnons is treated in mean - field theory . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained effective model , in comparison to that of the usual slave - fermion representation , has an additional bare hole dispersion due to the hole moving by using quantum spin fluctuations present in the undoped antiferromagnetic ground state . </S>",
    "<S> the single - hole green s function at half - filling is then found numerically using the self - consistent born approximation . </S>",
    "<S> for all studied quantities good or excellent agreement with numerical data is observed in the entire parameter range , noticeably better than in the studies with the slave - fermion representation . using the same effective model , the two - hole problem </S>",
