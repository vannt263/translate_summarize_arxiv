    "this paper deals with the coupled problem describing the time - harmonic motion of the mechanical system that consists of an inviscid , incompressible , heavy fluid ( water ) in which a partially immersed structure floats freely .",
    "the latter means that there are no external forces acting on it other than gravity ( for example , due to constraints on its motion ) .",
    "it is assumed that water occupies ( together with the immersed part of the structure ) a half - space and the structure consists of a finite number @xmath0 of bounded surface - piercing bodies .",
    "the water motion is supposed to be irrotational and the surface tension is neglected on the free surface of water ; moreover , the motion of the system is supposed to be of small amplitude near equilibrium , which allows us to use a linear model . in our previous papers @xcite and @xcite , we considered the case of a single body which floats freely in water of finite and infinite depth , respectively .    in his pioneering article @xcite ,",
    "f. john developed the time - dependent model for a single freely floating body .",
    "the two - dimensional version of the coupling conditions proposed by him ( in particular , the equations of body s motion ) were presented in the convenient matrix form in @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", a similar form was developed for the three - dimensional problem and here we use its generalisation to the case of multiple bodies . assuming that the water motion is simple harmonic in time , we reduce the time - dependent problem to a coupled spectral problem with the frequency of oscillations playing the role of spectral parameter ; it appears in the boundary conditions , the radiation condition at infinity as well as in the equations of motion of each body .",
    "since the system s energy is proved to be finite , it is possible to reformulate this spectral problem as an operator equation in a hilbert space ( see @xcite , where this approach was developed for a similar problem in a channel symmetric about its centre - plane ) .",
    "however , such a formulation is superfluous for our purpose of constructing trapping structures and the corresponding trapped modes .    in our papers @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "various uniqueness theorems were proved for the time - harmonic problem for finite and infinite depth of water , respectively . in the first of these papers , the original proof of john",
    "@xcite was essentially simplified . for proving the uniqueness theorem in @xcite , a new non - dimensional form of the problem",
    "was proposed ; this allowed us to evaluate the lower bound for frequencies at which the uniqueness is guaranteed .",
    "the last paper also contains various examples of a single body with the following properties .",
    "it is motionless , floats freely and traps axisymmetric wave modes .",
    "earlier , similar examples were obtained for the two - dimensional problem in @xcite .",
    "one has to keep in mind that in the vast majority of published papers the questions of uniqueness and existence of solutions and of trapped modes are studied for the scattering and radiation problems under the assumption that an immersed body or several such bodies are fixed ( see @xcite and @xcite for surveys , whereas the most recent uniqueness theorems can be found in @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "before 2010 , the only rigorous result for the problem of a freely floating body was that of john @xcite , who proved a uniqueness theorem ( unfortunately , without formulating the problem explicitly ) .",
    "no other rigorous results about this problem had been obtained until recently . however , after 2005 a number of authors considered the question of trapped modes at the heuristic level and various two - dimensional and axisymmetric trapping structures were proposed by virtue of numerical computations ( see @xcite , which are listed in the chronological order ) . in",
    "most of these papers , a simplified model is treated ; it deals with a freely floating body constrained to the heave motion only .",
    "the exception is the article @xcite in which an example of trapping structure is considered whose motion is combined ( heave and sway ) .    in the present paper ,",
    "our aim is to construct explicitly trapped modes , that is , eigensolutions of the coupled time - harmonic problem involving freely floating structures that consist of multiple bodies ; some of these ( may be none ) are motionless , whereas the rest part of bodies ( may be none ) are in the heave motion . for this purpose",
    "we apply the so - called inverse method that replaces finding a solution to a problem in a given domain by determining a physically acceptable water region for a given solution .",
    "it is worth mentioning that this method widely used in continuum mechanics prior to the advent of computers ( see @xcite for a survey ) appears in two forms distinguished by the involvement of boundary conditions .",
    "if some of these conditions , but not all , are prescribed at the outset , the method is referred to as semi - inverse and this particular form of it is used here .",
    "the paper s plan is as follows .",
    "we begin with formulating the time - dependent problem in  2.1 .",
    "then we apply an ansatz that introduces complex - valued unknowns appropriate for considering time - harmonic oscillations and reduces the time - dependent problem to a coupled spectral problem (  2.2 ) . the brief  3 deals with the energy of the coupled time - harmonic motion ; it also contains the definition of a trapped mode . in the main  4 , various trapped modes and the corresponding axisymmetric water domains are constructed .",
    "let the cartesian coordinates @xmath1 , @xmath2 , be such that the @xmath3-axis is directed upwards , whereas the mean free surface of water lies in the @xmath4-plane , and so the water domain is a subset of @xmath5 .",
