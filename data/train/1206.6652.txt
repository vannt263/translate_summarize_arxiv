    "if weakly mixed particles exist , then the sphaleron processes can create the baryon asymmetry of the universe @xcite . as it is noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , the long - lived fourth generation particles save baryon asymmetry generated in the early universe from erasure by the sphaleron transitions .",
    "the sphaleron transitions conserve @xmath146 , thus , if in the early universe @xmath147 is generated , then the final baryon and lepton asymmetries being proportional to @xmath146 are completely erased .",
    "if the fourth generation particles weakly mix with three quark - lepton generations of the standard model , then two additional quantities are conserved : @xmath148 and @xmath149 , where @xmath150 and @xmath151 are the densities of baryons and leptons of the fourth generation , while @xmath103 and @xmath152 are the densities of baryons and leptons of three light generations . in ref .",

    ", if heavy baryons of the 4th generation do not decay prior to big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) , the light baryon number density at bbn could be different from that determined from the angular fluctuations of cmb .",
    "the impact of this effect on the light element abundances is discussed below .",
    "for such a scenario to occur the lifetimes of the fourth generation quarks and leptons should be at least larger than the universe age at the sphaleron freeze - out : @xmath157 s. for the mixing angles in the case of @xmath158 decay it gives @xmath159 @xcite , much smaller than what we need to explain the large cpv in @xmath0-decays , see eq .",
    "( [ 36 ] ) .",
    "so in our case quarks of the fourth generation should be much stronger mixed with quarks of three light generations .",

    "according to the standard cosmological scenario nonrelativistic matter started to dominate the cosmic energy density at redshift @xmath186 . if we demand that @xmath170 should decay before that epoch , its life - time",
    "should be sufficiently short , @xmath187  s , from which we obtain the lower bound @xmath188 .",
    "( let us note that direct searches exclude @xmath170 as a unique dark matter candidate @xcite ) .",
    "a stronger bound on @xmath189 follows from the equilibrium form of the energy spectrum of cmb . according to ref .",
    "@xcite a large influx of energy into the usual cosmological cosmic background would be thermalized if it took place before @xmath190 .",
    "otherwise the observed black body spectrum of cmb would be noticeably distorted . since the precision of the spectral shape is at the level of @xmath191 , only a very small distortion is permitted .",
    "the condition that @xmath170 decays before or at @xmath192 demands @xmath193 s , or @xmath194 .",
    "if @xmath170 indeed decays before @xmath190 , the contribution from its decay to the energy density of cmb would be not larger than 1% and the ratio of baryon to photon number densities @xmath195 at bbn epoch and at cmb recombination would be slightly different but in principle measurable by the light element abundances .",
    "more interesting and pronounced effect appears if heavy quarks of the 4th generation are long - lived . in this case",
    "we can not explain the large value of cpv in @xmath0 decays but may explain the difference of @xmath196 at bbn epoch ( @xmath197 ) and at the recombination ( @xmath198 ) which is probably requested by the recent data on the light element abundances  @xcite .",
    "if heavy baryons of the 4th generation decays after bbn but before the hydrogen recombination , the number of light baryons in the comoving volume at bbn would be different from that at the recombination .",
    "the ratio @xmath199 at these epochs could be either larger or smaller than unity depending upon the value of the baryon asymmetry in the heavy quark sector and the energy influx to cmb from the heavy baryon decays .",
    "so in principle both rise or decrease of @xmath197 is possible and the number of light neutrino species influence nucleosynthesis , the change in the value of @xmath197 can be formulated as an additional ( positive or negative ) number of light neutrino species @xcite . ] .    in the limit @xmath200 heavy particles of the fourth generation",
    "are not produced : @xmath201 , @xmath202 . in the physically interesting opposite limit",
    "@xmath203 the value of baryon asymmetry is nonzero since the right - handed neutrinos of three light generations are not produced in the primordial plasma violating symmetry between the leptons of four generations which would occur at @xmath204 .",
    "the characteristic time of the right - handed neutrino to thermalize is @xmath205 and for @xmath206 kev ( which is valid for three light neutrinos ) this time is longer than the universe age , @xmath207 for @xmath208 gev , @xcite .",
    "in introduction we determined what ratio of the penguin to the tree amplitudes of @xmath1 decay is needed to get the observed cp asymmetry . in section 2 we found that the factorization describes the tree amplitude with good accuracy ; concerning the penguin amplitude it appears to be twenty times smaller than one needs to describe the experimental data on @xmath141 . in section 3",
    "we demonstrated that in the case of @xmath209 decay the factorization underestimates the penguin amplitude by factor 2 . in the case of @xmath210 decay the penguin amplitude is enhanced by factor 2 - 3 in comparison with the factorization result .",
