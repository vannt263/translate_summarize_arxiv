    "the problem of constructing an optimum lattice - like structure over a curved surface has become an area of interest in diverse contexts within condensed matter physics .",
    "some examples are in work on flexible tethered membranes , fullerene molecules , the thomson problem of electrons on a spherical surface , and in models of two - dimensional systems using a spherical geometry to study both the quantum hall effect ( qhe)and thin film superconductors .",
    "the well known fullerene molecules demonstrate how a low energy structure can be formed by folding a hexagonal lattice of carbon atoms ( as is found in graphite ) onto a closed surface , as long as twelve five - membered rings ( pentagons ) are present a simple consequence of euler s theorem .",
    "these pentagons are essentially disclination defects in the hexagonal lattice .",
    "the first discovered fullerene molecule was @xmath2 in which each of the sixty atoms holds an identical symmetry position within the structure of the molecule , so the atoms reside on the surface of a sphere.@xcite this is a special case and as the number of carbon atoms increases in these molecules the shape may distort from a sphere to reduce the strain from the ideal hexagonal lattice over large areas .",
    "the interaction between the energy cost of bending the surface of the molecule and the strain energy within the molecule due to the disclination defects is of central importance in the question of the stability of different structures.[24 ]    the same considerations are important in the behaviour of membranes with internal crystalline order and the ability to buckle out of the two - dimensional plane .",
    "a disclination defect may lower its energy by buckling . if this reduces the total energy of the defect such that it diverges at most logarithmically with the system size , then this raises the possibility of a buckling transition as defects begin to proliferate at some finite temperature.@xcite alternatively , if we consider a closed membrane , such as a vesicle made from surfactant bilayers , then the interaction of the internal orientational order with the physical curvature may alter the shape,@xcite or even the topology@xcite of the membrane .",
    "some important and well studied models involve these problems but with the curvature of the system fixed .",
    "one instance is thomson s problem of trying to find the lowest energy configuration for n electrons that are constrained to lie on the surface of a sphere .",
    "although the problem was first proposed in the rather dated context of classical models of the atom,@xcite it has been extensively studied recently .",
    "this is partly because of the general relevance to any physical system of this geometry , but also for its interest as an unsolved problem , providing a testing ground for various numerical optimization methods.[913 ]    a different model where a two - dimensional system is restricted to a spherical surface has been studied both in the context of the qhe and in numerical studies on thin film superconductors . in this model , a magnetic field perpendicular to the surface",
    "is imposed by placing a dirac monopole at the centre of the sphere .",
    "the possible electronic states on the surface of the sphere split into landau levels under the influence of the magnetic field , in analogy with the problem on a flat plane .",
    "the reason the model was put on a sphere by haldane was to allow `` the construction of homogeneous states '' with only a finite number of electrons.@xcite recent monte carlo simulations of 2d superconductors have been performed with a similar model to haldane s with a superconducting wavefunction in the lowest landau level on the sphere.[2022 ] this wavefunction contains @xmath0 zeros that correspond to vortices in the supercurrent , where @xmath0 depends on the quantized strength of the monopole .",
    "the reason for using this model is again to enable translational invariance which is not possible in a finite system on a flat plane .",
    "the monte carlo simulations on a sphere have led us to consider in detail the ground states of this model . while the problem of finding the ground state of an infinite type ii superconductor penetrated by vortices was long ago solved and found to be the triangular vortex lattice,@xcite such a lattice can not form on a sphere without the presence of twelve vortices with only five nearest neighbours .",
    "these twelve vortices are the centres of disclination defects . by considering the strains from the perfect triangular lattice , caused by the disclination defects , within elasticity theory ,",
    "we have approximated the ground state energy in the large @xmath0 limit using similar methods used in theoretical work on membranes and fullerene molecules .",
    "we have also found numerically the ground states with finite @xmath0 , using symmetry considerations to reach large system sizes .",
    "we find values of @xmath0 that give particularly low energies and this is explained . by extrapolating our numerical results to large @xmath0",
    "we find a finite energy cost per vortex on the sphere compared to the infinite plane ground state that is consistent with our results from elasticity theory .",
    "our model thin film superconductor consists of a spherical shell of superconducting material , thickness @xmath3 , radius @xmath4 and a monopole at the centre of the sphere that produces an integer multiple of flux quanta through the spherical surface .",
    "we ignore spatial fluctuations in the magnetic flux density , @xmath5 , at the surface ; the effective penetration depth for supercurrents in thin films becomes arbitrarily large as @xmath3 is reduced .",
    "we choose a cylindrically symmetric gauge consistent with this field with @xmath6 .",
    "we measure lengths in the units @xmath7 which if there are @xmath0 quanta of flux gives @xmath8 .",
    "if we may describe the properties of the superconductor by a complex order parameter @xmath9 , then the ginzburg - landau free energy hamiltonian will be given by @xmath10= \\int d^3r \\left [ \\alpha(t ) { |\\psi|}^2                   + \\frac{\\beta}{2}{|\\psi|}^4   + \\frac{1}{2 m } \\psi^ * { d}^2 \\psi \\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "we diagonalize the operator @xmath13 by expanding @xmath14 in a basis of eigenfunctions of @xmath13 which form degenerate landau levels .",
    "the degenerate set with the lowest eigenvalue may be filled by the orthonormal functions@xcite @xmath15 with @xmath16 and @xmath17}^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "this is the lowest landau level ( lll ) and over a large range of fields and temperatures it is a good approximation to restrict @xmath14 to the lll , @xmath18 .",
    "we set @xmath19 . with this restriction",
    "we can write the hamiltonian in terms of the basis coefficients , which for @xmath20 is given by @xmath21,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is given in @xcite , @xmath23 is the reduced temperature variable and we have scaled the coefficients as @xmath24 . the quartic term in equation  ( [ eq : oneill ] ) can be rewritten to give@xcite : @xmath25   , \\ ] ] where @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the beta function and @xmath28 is the heaviside step function .",
    "the vortices in this system correspond to the zeros in @xmath9 .",
    "the phase of the order parameter changes by @xmath29 when a path is followed that encircles any zero once .",
    "this becomes clear if we make the projection @xmath30 this gives the form @xmath31 .",
    "therefore @xmath32 is a holomorphic function of @xmath33 with @xmath0 simple zeros in the complex-@xmath33 plane .",
    "it can always be written in the alternative product form @xmath34 .",
    "@xmath35 is an overall complex amplitude and @xmath36 are the vortex positions in the projection of equation  ( [ eq : proj ] ) .",
    "the function @xmath9 is equally well described by the set @xmath37 or the set @xmath38 .",
    "there is no simple relation between the two , although numerical routines may be used to find the positions of the zeros for a given set of basis coefficients .",
    "despite this lack of a simple relation from the basis coefficients to coordinates on the sphere , there are still some spatial transformations one can make using the @xmath37 formalism .",
    "for instance rotation about the @xmath39-axis by an angle @xmath40 may be performed by the transformation @xmath41 .",
    "reflection in the @xmath42-@xmath39 plane results in @xmath43 .",
    "rotation by @xmath44 about the @xmath42-axis occurs under the change @xmath45 .",
    "we are interested in the ground states of @xmath46 .",
    "we write the hamiltonian as @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 is the abrikosov factor .",
    "this is minimized by @xmath50 to give @xmath51 , so minimizing @xmath52 is equivalent to minimizing @xmath53 .",
    "the correct @xmath54 is then given by a scale factor on the basis coefficients that does not alter @xmath55 .",
    "the ground state of the lll vortex system on an infinite plane is well known to be the triangular lattice@xcite which has @xmath56 . with periodic boundary conditions ,",
    "this is also the ground state on the finite systems used in other simulations.@xcite however , a perfect triangular lattice can not form on a spherical surface .",
    "the closest configuration the vortices can make to an ideal lattice must contain twelve `` disclinations '' , i.e.  twelve vortices that only have five nearest neighbours . in section  [ sec : num ]",
    "we give our results for directly minimizing @xmath46 using a simple numerical method , but first we describe in section  [ sec : elastic ] calculations using elasticity theory to give the finite energy cost that the spherical system will have as @xmath1 due to the twelve disclinations .",
    "for a lattice in a two - dimensional plane , the elastic energy cost of deformations from the perfect ground state lattice is given in the harmonic approximation by @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the elastic strain matrix .",
    "the displacement represents the deformation of the lattice from the point @xmath59 to the point @xmath60 .",
    "the elastic constants @xmath61 and @xmath62 are related to the shear and bulk moduli by @xmath63 and @xmath64 . for the lll ground state",
    "the bulk modulus is infinite ; the vortex system is incompressible so @xmath65 .",
    "the shear modulus is given by@xcite @xmath66 the gl parameter @xmath67 is the ratio of magnetic and superconducting correlation lengths , which diverges when we neglect the magnetic screening of supercurrents . in our approximation",
    "we can write the shear modulus as @xmath68 .    from the elastic energy in equation  ( [ eq : enelastic ] ) hooke s law",
    "may be derived by minimizing @xmath69 to give @xmath70 for the stress tensor @xmath71 the zero divergence condition allows the reformulation of the problem in terms of the airy stress function@xcite @xmath72 .",
    "( this is analogous to the vector potential that ensures zero divergence of magnetic fields . )    in the presence of topological defects , such as the disclinations we are considering , the displacement field @xmath73 is multi - valued .",
    "a disclination is defined by the change in bond angle @xmath74 as a closed loop is followed .",
    "encircling a five - fold disclination in a triangular lattice will increase @xmath75 by @xmath76 .",
    "this results in the noncommutativity of the derivatives of @xmath75 at the centre of the disclination . writing the strain field in terms of the airy stress function results in the biharmonic equation that contains all of 2d",
    "elasticity theory:@xcite @xmath77 the density of disclinations is @xmath78 where @xmath79 labels each defect and @xmath80 for a five - fold disclination . in equation  ( [ eq : biharm ] )",
    "@xmath81 is the 2d young s modulus , which in the lll is @xmath82    of course , our problem is not on a flat plane but on a sphere , so we must take into account the bending of the system out of the plane . in the large @xmath0 limit",
    "the surface will be flat locally compared to lattice spacings . over a small region",
    ", we may approximate the sphere as a plane with some small perpendicular deflection , @xmath83 . for our purposes we neglect the bending energy which will tend to a constant independent on the system",
    "size when integrated over the whole sphere .",
    "however , we will need to write the strain matrix as @xmath84 .",
    "this alters the biharmonic equation by adding an extra term , @xmath85 , the gaussian curvature to equation  ( [ eq : biharm ] ) : @xmath86 for a sphere the curvature is constant , @xmath87 .",
    "we write @xmath88 as the superposition of twelve contributions corresponding to each disclination , @xmath89 .",
    "the solution to equation  ( [ eq : biharm2 ] ) is found in [ app : airy ] .",
    "the elastic energy from equation  ( [ eq : enelastic ] ) can be written in terms of the airy stress function as in equation  ( [ eq : enfin ] ) .",
    "we have calculated the energy cost for these twelve disclinations for different configurations . for any configuration the total energy scales with the surface area of the sphere , so there is a finite energy cost per vortex in the limit @xmath1 .",
    "the minimum energy is found with the disclinations at the corners of an icosahedron . in this case",
    "we find an energy cost per vortex of @xmath90 in section  [ sec : num ] we will compare @xmath91 with the energy @xmath91 obtained by direct minimization of @xmath92 for finite @xmath0 .",
    "we have used a simple quasi - newton algorithm to find configurations @xmath93 that minimize the abrikosov ratio @xmath94 ; this is equivalent to finding the minimum energy of the system .",
    "clearly there are some transformations of @xmath93 under which @xmath55 is invariant .",
    "the energy of the system remains unchanged after a global phase change in the order parameter , or after a rotation of the whole system about some axis .",
    "these freedoms can be fixed by restrictions on the coefficients.@xcite our results up to @xmath95 are shown in figure  [ fig:1 ] .",
    "the presence of `` magic numbers '' , for which the ground state has a lower energy than nearby values , is clearly seen at @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "to some extent we can explain the magic numbers from the expected symmetry of the most stable ground states .    by finding the zeros of the ground states",
    ", we can look at the vortex configurations .",
    "as might be expected they make up a triangular network , but with twelve five - coordinated centres .",
    "the magic number states display icosahedral symmetry with the disclinations corresponding to the corners of the icosahedron , as in figure  [ fig:2 ] .",
    "in fact the structures appear to be projections on to the sphere of icosadeltahedra , which are polyhedra with identical equilateral triangular faces and icosahedral symmetry.@xcite these may be constructed by considering the number of triangular lattice vectors between neighbouring five - fold centres , labelled by the indices @xmath101 .",
    "= 8 cm     +    = 15 cm     +    a simple geometrical argument shows that this divides each face of the icosahedron into @xmath102 triangular faces with @xmath103 , so t may be equal to @xmath104 .",
    "this gives a total of @xmath105 faces and @xmath106 vertices to the icosadeltahedra .",
    "the magic numbers we find satisfy these conditions , the only remaining question being why some possible values of @xmath0 are not so low in energy , eg .",
    "@xmath107 or @xmath108 .",
    "notice that the structures for @xmath109 and @xmath99 possess a chirality .",
    "in fact this will always be the case for @xmath110 ( as long as neither is zero ) .",
    "this may be a factor in deciding the lowest energy structures as the complex conjugation of the coefficients is equivalent to a reflection .",
    "if a ground state has no chirality then any reflection of the state will be equivalent to a rotation .",
    "this would require that we could write the ground state with all coefficients having the same phase .",
    "it is unlikely that this combination would be effective in minimizing the complex interactions in the quartic term of the hamiltonian especially as the system size increases .",
    "therefore the chirality allows a greater variety of phase differences between the coefficients .",
    "such subtleties may explain why the ground states for some non - chiral icosahedral numbers are not particularly stable , as with @xmath111 .",
    "remarkably , the same structures that are found when we minimize our vortex system for some magic numbers are seen in nature in the form of the shells of certain viruses.@xcite in particular the structure shown in figure  [ fig:2](c ) for @xmath112 is also observed in double and single shelled simian rotaviruses , in a left handed configuration.@xcite that these similarities exist in such different systems suggests that some general principle exists for the criterion of the most stable structure .",
    "it is possibly related to a mathematical problem that also generates these structures .",
    "this is the `` covering '' problem : how may @xmath0 equal overlapping circles ( without gaps ) cover a sphere so that the diameter of the circles is minimized?@xcite the centres of these circles correspond to the vortices in our system .",
    "the alternative problem of maximizing the diameter of the circles apparently gives different solutions .",
    "the details of the magic number states becomes less important as @xmath0 becomes large , the limit treated in section  [ sec : elastic ] within elasticity theory .",
    "as @xmath0 increases the numerical minimization becomes less trivial as there is an increasing overlap between the basis states resulting in more complex phase interference ( see ref .   where numerical minimization on a plane in cylindrical coordinates resulted in rather high values of @xmath55 ) .",
    "another possibly related problem is the growth in the number of metastable states with energies only slightly above the ground state .",
    "the numerical work on thomson s problem has found that the number of metastable states grows exponentially with the system size.@xcite we may use our knowledge of the symmetry of the most stable configurations to reduce the number of free variables by an order of magnitude .",
    "we assume the icosahedral properties of the ground state , and choose a five - coordinated vortex at @xmath113 .",
    "the five - fold symmetry about the @xmath39-axis is imposed by setting @xmath114 for @xmath115 where @xmath116 is any integer .",
    "the icosahedron also has five two - fold axes of symmetry at right angles to each five - fold axis .",
    "this two - fold rotational symmetry will arise if we set @xmath117 .",
    "we have performed the same minimization routine using these constraints for @xmath118 up to @xmath119 .",
    "our results for large @xmath0 are shown in the inset to figure  [ fig:1 ] .",
    "the data fits well to the form @xmath120 with @xmath121 and @xmath122 . as @xmath1",
    ", @xmath55 does not seem to converge to the infinite plane value @xmath123 ( contrary to the conclusions of ref .   from the minimizations of small system sizes ) .",
    "this extrapolation implies a finite energy cost per vortex on the sphere in the large @xmath0 limit of @xmath124 the difference between this and the result of equation  ( [ eq : eldiff ] ) from elasticity theory may be explained by the inadequacy of the harmonic approximation in this calculation .",
    "as there are large strains associated with the disclination defects , non - linear effects will be important in determining the total energy cost . in their calculation of disclination defects on flat membranes nelson and seung@xcite found the same mismatch between elasticity theory and numerical results , with elasticity overestimating the energy cost by a similar proportion .",
    "within the approximations of section  [ sec : elastic ] the correction for finite @xmath0 is not predicted .",
    "numerically the energy cost per vortex falls as @xmath125 at large @xmath0 which implies a total contribution that grows proportionally to the radius .",
    "it must be stressed that the results of this section required no great numerical effort .",
    "more sophisticated optimization methods ( eg .  simulated annealing@xcite and its generalizations@xcite ) may give greater confidence in whether or not the absolute minima have been found .",
    "more extensive work would also give results for larger @xmath0 .",
    "however , our use of symmetry has allowed us to do a great deal with just a simple routine .",
    "the original motivation of this work was for the use of the numerical ground states in monte carlo simulations.@xcite we also wanted to investigate the differences between these ground states and the ground states on a flat plane , for which other groups have performed simulations obtaining different results .",
    "the work in this paper shows that the vortex ground states on the sphere do not approach the ground state of the infinite flat plane as @xmath1 .",
    "the presence of the twelve disclinations remains important however large the sphere .",
    "this work may also be of interest in wider contexts : first , in its relation to other optimization problems of points on a sphere .",
    "our particular system allows a use of symmetry that may not be so straightforward with position variables .",
    "this enables us to find approximate ground states at large @xmath0 with quite unsophisticated numerical techniques .",
    "our elasticity calculation may be relevant to the large @xmath0 limit of thomson s problem , using properties of the wigner lattice on a 2d infinite plane .",
    "this limit has been considered before , and projection of the wigner lattice onto a spherical surface was used to estimate the extra energy on the sphere.@xcite however , no consideration was taken of the required disclination defects .",
    "this paper also provides a numerical test of the accuracy of elasticity theory for curved membranes and disclination defects where the approximation of small deviations from the ideal lattice breaks down . finally , the fact that the structures we see in the magic number ground states are the same structures seen in such a different field as virology suggests that these fascinating shapes are the result of some general optimization criteria .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank mike moore for his help and encouragement as well as mike evans for useful conversations .",
    "in this appendix we derive the contributions from each of the twelve disclinations to the the airy stress function @xmath89 and describe how this leads to the elastic energy cost of these disclinations . from equation  ( [ eq : biharm2 ] ) with @xmath87 and @xmath126",
    "we have : @xmath127 where @xmath128 , and @xmath129 and @xmath130 are the polar and azimuthal angles with respect to the axis through the disclination . using the symmetry about this axis , this may be integrated to give @xmath131 with @xmath132 a constant .",
    "for @xmath133 to be well defined the integral of @xmath134 over the whole sphere must be zero , which means @xmath135 .",
    "integrating again leads to @xmath136\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\int_0^{\\sin{\\frac{\\theta'(\\alpha)}{2 } } } \\frac{\\ln{(1-x^2)}}{x}dx\\}.\\label{eq : imp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the integral in equation  ( [ eq : imp ] ) can not be written as a finite number of elementary functions.@xcite from equation  ( [ eq : enelastic ] ) the elastic energy of the disclinations can be written @xmath137\\\\ & = & \\frac{1}{2}\\int d^2r \\left[\\frac{1}{k_0 } ( \\nabla^2\\chi)^2 -\\frac{1+\\sigma}{k_0}\\epsilon_{ik}\\epsilon_{jl}\\partial_k\\partial_l \\left ( \\partial_i\\chi\\partial_j\\chi\\right ) \\right],\\label{eq : enfin}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the 2d poisson ratio @xmath138 equal to unity in the lll approximation .",
    "the second term in equation  ( [ eq : enfin ] ) only gives contributions on boundaries , and so is zero on the sphere .",
    "therefore from equation  ( [ eq : del2 ] ) we can find the energies of different configurations of the disclinations on the sphere .",
