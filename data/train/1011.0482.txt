    "experiments at the frontiers of quantum mechanics and gravity are rare .",
    "we would like to explore in this essay , in honor of danny greenberger and helmut rauch , situations which could lead to such experiments .",
    "the key is to understand the phenomenon of quantum incompressibility  of macroscopically coherent quantum matter in the presence of inhomogeneous , tidal gravitational fields , such as the earth s .",
    "see figure [ radial - converging - geodesics ] .",
    "[ radial - converging - geodesics ]   with respect to the vertical plumb line equidistant between them . according to a distant inertial observer , the radial convergence of these objects trajectories towards the center of the earth causes them to undergo small horizontal components of acceleration @xmath0 of the radial acceleration @xmath1 .",
    "these components are equivalent to a tidal gravitational force that , in a newtonian picture , causes the two objects to converge toward one another.,title=\"fig:\",width=192 ]    as an example of quantum incompressibility  during free fall of an extended quantum object ,  let us first consider the single electron of a circular rydberg atom @xcite ( ignoring electron spin ) , which is prepared in the state @xmath2where @xmath3 is the principal quantum number , which is large , i.e. , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 is the maximum possible orbital angular momentum quantum number for a given @xmath3 , and @xmath6 is the maximum possible azimuthal quantum number for a given @xmath7 , i.e. , the stretched  state .",
    "the @xmath8 axis has been chosen to be the local vertical axis located at the center of mass of the atom .",
    "then the wavefunction of this electron in polar coordinates @xmath9 of the hydrogenic atom in this state is given by haroche - and - raimond@xmath10where @xmath11 is a normalization constant .",
    "[ rydberg ]   has a strongly peaked , ring - like probability distribution , i.e. , an electron cloud , indicated by the heavy black loop .",
    "currents in this state lead to a magnetic field @xmath12 , indicated by the directional loops .",
    "the @xmath8 axis is the local vertical axis.,title=\"fig:\",width=192 ]    the probability density associated with this wavefunction has the form of a strongly peaked distribution which lies on the horizontal @xmath13 plane , in the shape of a ring of radius @xmath14where @xmath15 is the bohr radius .",
    "thus one recovers the bohr model of the hydrogen atom in the correspondence - principle limit of large @xmath3 .",
    "this ring - like probability distribution is illustrated in figure 2 .",
    "the question we would like to address here is this : how does the size of this atom change with time as it undergoes free fall in earth s inhomogeneous , tidal gravitational field ?",
    "the magnetic moment of the rydberg atom in the state ( [ ring - like wf ] ) is quantized , and is given by@xmath16where @xmath17 is the bohr magneton and @xmath3 is an integer .",
    "the electron current density in the ring - like structure of a circular rydberg atom in figure 2 is similar to that of a persistent supercurrent of cooper pairs in a superconducting ring with a quantized flux given by@xmath18where @xmath19 is the flux quantum and @xmath3 is an integer .",
    "the quantum incompressibility of the ring - like structure of a circular rydberg atom , and the quantum incompressibility of the cooper pairs of electrons in a superconducting ring , both arise from the same quantum mechanical principle , namely , the single - valuedness of the wavefunction after one round trip around the ring , which follows from the condition@xmath20where @xmath21 is the phase of the wavefunction , and @xmath22 is an integer corresponding to the state under consideration .",
    "another necessary condition for quantum incompressibility is the existence of a substantial energy gap separating the @xmath22th state from adjacent states of the system .",
    "the analogy between the rydberg atom and the superconducting ring is not a perfect one , since the selection rules for allowed transitions between adjacent states will be different in the two cases .",
    "the transitions @xmath23 and @xmath24 are electric - dipole allowed for the rydberg atom , whereas the transitions @xmath25 and @xmath26 between adjacent flux - trapping states of the superconducting ring are highly forbidden .",
    "this is because a macroscopic number of identical cooper pairs of electrons must all simultaneously jump from a state with @xmath27 units to a state with @xmath28 units or with @xmath29 units of angular momentum per electron pair .",
    "hence the persistent current of a superconducting ring is highly metastable , and does not change with time , unless a macroscopic quantum transition occurs .",
    "if the characteristic frequency of an external perturbation , such as that of the tidal gravitational fields acting on the system during free fall in earth s gravity , is much less than the smallest energy gap of an allowed transition divided by planck s constant , then the system can not make a transition ( i.e. , a quantum jump ) out of its initial state .",
    "thus it must stay rigidly in its initial state .",
    "( for a rydberg atom with @xmath30 , this transition frequency lies in the gigahertz range , so that this assumption is well satisfied . )",
    "the size of the circular rydberg atom and the size of the persistent currents of the superconducting ring will therefore remain constant in time during perturbations arising from earth s tidal fields during free fall , apart from a sequence of possible quantum jumps  in a quantum staircase ,  though such transitions occur only in highly unusual circumstances in the gravitational field of the earth .",
    "it has been previously shown @xcite that the electron wavefunction of a hydrogen atom will be altered by the presence of curvature .",
    "the hamiltonian operator for such an operator is given by@xmath31where @xmath32 is the unperturbed operator , and @xmath33 is an interaction hamiltonian due to curvature .",
    "this interaction operator was shown to be@xmath34where @xmath35 is the mass of the electron , @xmath36 are components of the riemann curvature tensor , and @xmath37 and @xmath38 are components of the position operator of the electron . equation ( [ h_i ] ) is obtained by taking the nonrelativistic limit of the dirac equation embedded into curved spacetime @xcite@xcite .  the subscript @xmath39 is used for parker , the author of the papers referenced here , and his index notation is adopted as well .",
    "superscripts @xmath7 and @xmath22 are contravariant indices satisfying @xmath40 , and should not be confused with quantum number @xmath7 or mass @xmath22 .",
    "the index @xmath41 refers to the time components .",
    "greek indices are spacetime indices , and latin indices are space indices only .  the einstein summation convention is used here as well , in which repeated indices are summed over all possible values .    expressing these components of the riemann tensor in terms of the gravitational scalar potential",
    ", which satisfies@xmath42one can show that near the surface of the earth , the interaction hamiltonian is given by @xmath43 in cartesian coordinates , or@xmath44\\]]in spherical coordinates .",
    "it is worth noting that this interaction hamiltonian is proportional to the second - degree , zero - order spherical harmonic @xmath45  thus , this interaction hamiltonian represents a rank-2 angular momentum operator , since its angular dependence is quadrupolar @xcite .",
    "one immediate consequence is that , by the wigner - eckart theorem , there will be no effect on a hydrogen atom in a state with zero angular momentum ( i.e. where @xmath46 ) , to first order , through this interaction hamiltonian .",
    "the energy shift associated with @xmath47 is given by@xmath48taking the expectation values with respect to the stretched - state wavefunction in ( [ ring - like wf ] ) , one obtains@xmath49where the approximation is valid for large values of principal quantum number @xmath50    in addition to the energy shift derived from the interaction hamiltonian @xmath51 , one can use dewitt s minimal coupling rule , which is associated with an asymptotically flat coordinate system , unlike the operator @xmath47 , which is associated with the transverse - traceless gauge often used in general relativity .",
    "let us show that quantum incompressibility is predicted to occur in a circular rydberg atom , starting from dewitt s minimal coupling rule .",
    "the dewitt hamiltonian for a freely falling hydrogenic atom , such as a circular rydberg atom in presence of weak electromagnetic and gravitational fields , is given in si units by@xmath52where @xmath53 is the electromagnetic vector potential , and @xmath54  is dewitt s gravitational vector potential @xcite .    before perfoming any quantitative analyses ,",
    "it is stated here beforehand that while the hamiltonian in ( [ dewitt hamiltonian for rydberg atom ] ) applies to the entire atom , one can apply a center - of - mass and relative coordinates transformation to the unperturbed hamiltonian , treating the interaction hamiltonians containing the vector potentials as perturbations .",
    "the fact that the proton has a much larger mass and is located at a much smaller distance from the center of mass causes the proton contributions to the energy shifts to be negligible compared to those of the electron contributions .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian for the @xmath55 term ( the landau diamagnetism term  landau&lifshitz ) is given by  @xcite@xmath56 in the symmetric gauge , where @xmath57 , for @xmath58 , and where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the unit vectors along the @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath8 axes , respectively , this yields@xmath63 in cartesian coordinates , or@xmath64 in spherical coordinates , where @xmath65 is the azimuthal angle .",
    "the energy shift in first - order perturbation theory resulting from the presence of the @xmath53 field is given by@xmath66recalling that the wavefunction for the circular rydberg state is given by ( [ ring - like wf ] ) , the expectation value in ( [ energy a ] ) becomes@xmath67for large values of the principal quantum number @xmath3 , where @xmath68 .",
    "it follows that the first - order energy shift of the atom in the presence of a magnetic field is@xmath69this result implies that , in first - order perturbation theory , the size of the atom does not change in the presence of the applied dc magnetic field , in the sense that the root - mean - square transverse size of the atom , which is given by@xmath70does not change with time during the application of the dc magnetic field .",
    "moreover , the wavefunction @xmath71 remains unaltered in first - order perturbation theory in the presence of a weak applied field .",
    "furthermore , this is still true for applied magnetic fields which vary sufficiently slowly in time , so that no transitions ( i.e. , quantum jumps ) can occur out of the initial state of the system @xmath71 .",
    "the concept of the quantum incompressibility  of a rydberg atom is thus a valid concept during the application of sufficiently weak , and sufficiently slowly varying , magnetic fields .",
    "the energy shift given by ( [ a.a_energy_shift ] ) causes the atom to become a _ low - field seeker _ in inhomogeneous magnetic fields through the relationship@xmath72where @xmath73 is the force on the atom in the ring - like state ( [ ring - like wf ] ) in the presence of an inhomogeneous magnetic field .",
    "next , let us consider the more interesting case of when weak tidal gravitational fields are present without any accompanying electromagnetic fields , i.e. , when @xmath74 and @xmath75 . as before , the atom is initially prepared in the state given by ( ring - like wf ) before it is released into free fall in the earth s inhomogeneous gravitational field . the @xmath8 axis , which goes through the center of mass of the atom ,",
    "is chosen to be the local vertical axis of the earth s field .",
    "the horizontal tidal gravitational fields of the earth experienced during free fall by the atom , as observed in the coordinate system of a distant inertial observer , where the @xmath13 plane is the local horizontal plane , will be given by@xmath76where @xmath77 is the velocity of a freely falling , point - like test particle located at @xmath13 and observed at time @xmath78 by the distant inertial observer @xcite , @xmath0 is the horizontal component of earth s gravitational acceleration arising from the radial convergence of free - fall trajectories towards the center of the earth as seen by this observer ( see figure [ radial - converging - geodesics ] ) , @xmath79 is the radius of the earth , and @xmath80 and @xmath81 are respectively the unit vectors pointing along the @xmath61 and the @xmath62 axes , in this observer s coordinate system . in ( [ tidal h field ] ) we have assumed that the horizontal excursions of the electron in @xmath61 and @xmath62 are very small compared to the earth s radius .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian for the @xmath82 term in ( [ dewitt hamiltonian for rydberg atom ] ) is given by@xmath83therefore , the shift in energy of the atom in the circular rydberg state , due to the earth s tidal fields given by ( [ tidal h field ] ) , is given in first - order perturbation theory by@xmath84for large values of @xmath3 , where @xmath68 .",
    "once again , since the expectation value in ( [ energy shift for h ] ) is the mean - square transverse size of the atom , this implies that the size of the atom does not change during free fall , according to first - order perturbation theory . in other words ,",
    "the atom is quantum incompressible  in the presence of the inhomogeneous , tidal fields of the earth , just like in the case of the atom in the presence of an applied dc magnetic field , as long as transitions ( i.e. , quantum jumps ) out of the initial quantum state @xmath71  can not occur .",
    "this conclusion is valid assuming that the characteristic frequency of the applied tidal fields is much less than the gap frequency ( i.e. , the energy gap divided by planck s constant , which is typically on the order of gigahertz for @xmath85 ) corresponding to a quantum transition from the @xmath3th state to the nearest adjacent allowed states , and assuming that the tidal gravitational field of the earth is sufficiently weak .    in the gravitational case , just as in the magnetic case ,",
    "the energy - level shift caused by the tidal perturbations arising from the earth s inhomogeneous gravitational field , leads to a force on the atom .",
    "this force causes the atom to become a _ low - field seeker _ in the inhomogeneous gravitational _ _  _ _ field of the earth through the relationship@xmath86thus a hydrogen atom in a circular rydberg state , which is an _ extended _ quantum object , will fall slightly more slowly than a point - like classical test particle which is simultaneously released into free fall along with the atom near the center of mass of the atom in earth s inhomogeneous field .",
    "the gravitational , landau - like energy shifts of the atom given by ( energy shift for h ) are much too small to be measured directly in earth - bound experiments using current technology , but in principle they can be measured spectroscopically by monitoring the frequencies of transitions between adjacent rydberg states , for example , in a satellite laboratory which is in a highly elliptical orbit around the earth .",
    "it is therefore a genuine physical effect .",
    "one might be tempted to say that the force given by ( [ f_h.h ] ) questions the universal applicability of the equivalence principle , i.e. , the universality of free fall .",
    "but it must be kept in mind that the equivalence principle applies strictly to point objects only , inside of which tidal effects can be neglected .",
    "this is manifestly not the case for the extended quantum systems being considered here .",
    "[ 2-sc - cubes - with-2-sc - wires ]   field inside this superconducting circuit , much like in the circular rydberg atom .",
    "all dimensions of the cubes and the length of the wire are given by the same distance @xmath87 .",
    "the @xmath8 axis denotes the local vertical axis passing through c.m .. ,title=\"fig:\",width=288 ]    the analogy between the rydberg atom and superconducting ring suggests a simple experiment to test the idea of quantum incompressibility  during free fall , which can be performed in an ordinary laboratory .",
    "consider a horizontal system consisting of two superconducting cubes joined by two parallel superconducting wires to form a superconducting circuit .",
    "see figure 3 .",
    "when a coherent quantum connection between the two cubes is not present ( due , say , to the effect of heating coils wrapped around the midsections of both wires which drive them to a normal state by heating them above their transition temperature , so that the coherent quantum connection between the cubes is thereby destroyed ) , the centers of masses of the two spatially separated cubes , which will have decohered with respect to each other , will follow the converging free - fall trajectories shown in figure radial - converging - geodesics , which are inclined at a slight angle @xmath65 with respect to the vertical plumb line passing through the midpoint c.m .",
    ", with@xmath88where @xmath87 is separation of the two cubes , which is also their dimensions ( thus chosen for simplicity ) , and @xmath79 is the radius of the earth . it should be noted that the _ decoherence _ , and therefore the _ spatial separability _ , of entangled states arising from perturbations due to the environment @xcite , is a necessary precondition for the applicability of the equivalence principle @xcite , so that here the universality of free fall can be applied to the free - fall trajectories of the _ disconnected _ superconducting cubes @xcite .    when a coherent connection is _ _",
    "_ _ present between the two cubes , they will become a single , macroscopic quantum object like the freely - falling rydberg atom .",
    "the cooper pairs of electrons of the system will then remain motionless with respect to the midpoint c.m .",
    ", since their macroscopic wavefunction corresponds to a zero - momentum eigenstate relative to c.m . , and therefore ,",
    "by the uncertainty principle , the electrons are completely nonlocalizable within the entire , coherently connected two - cube system .",
    "the cooper pairs of electrons , like the electron in rydberg atom , will then exhibit quantum incompressibility  during free fall .",
    "this follows from the fact that the mean - squared size of the coherent electrons of the _ entire _ superconducting system remains unchanged in response to the tidal gravitational fields of the earth , according to first - order perturbation theory .",
    "however , the ions , which have undergone decoherence due to the environment @xcite@xcite , are completely _ localizable _ , and therefore , by the equivalence principle , will want to follow the free - fall trajectories that converge onto the center of the earth shown in figure radial - converging - geodesics .",
    "by contrast , the cooper pairs of electrons will remain coherent during free fall , since they are protected from decoherence by the bcs energy gap @xcite , and will therefore remain completely _ nonlocalizable _ , since they will remain in a zero - momentum eigenstate .",
    "this difference in the motion of the ions and of the cooper pairs of electrons will then lead to the charge - separation effect indicated in figure 3 , in which the ions will be extruded through the innermost faces of the cubes , because of the convergence of their radial trajectories that point towards the center of the earth , and in which the cooper pairs of electrons , which resist this convergence , will be extruded through the outermost faces of the cubes .",
    "[ ball - and - stick - model ]   and @xmath89 are attached to rigid rods with lengths @xmath87 to form two dumbbells , which model the configuration of charges in figure 3 .",
    "the two innermost charges , both of which are @xmath89 , are separated by a distance @xmath87 .",
    "these two innermost charges dominate the coulomb force between the two dumbbells , so that the net force is a repulsive one.,title=\"fig:\",width=288 ]    the cooper pairs of electrons in the zero - momentum eigenstate , which remain at rest rigidly with respect to the _ global _ c.m .  of the entire , coherent two - cube system , will therefore be displaced away from the ions by a distance @xmath90 on left face of the left cube , and also on the right face of the right cube .",
    "the resulting charge configuration can be approximated by a ball - and - stick model of two charged dumbbells shown in figure [ ball - and - stick - model ] .",
    "on the one hand , the net coulomb force between the two dumbbells in figure [ ball - and - stick - model ] is given by@xmath91where @xmath92 is a pure number on the order of unity ( this follows from dimensional considerations , since @xmath87 is the only distance scale in the problem ) .",
    "on the other hand , the tidal gravitational force between the cubes  in figure 3 is given by@xmath93where @xmath94 is the mass of the cube ( which is mainly due to the ions ) , and@xmath95is the horizontal component of the acceleration due to earth s gravity acting on the centers of the cubes , which is directed towards the midpoint c.m .  of the two cubes",
    "thus , in equilibrium,@xmath96    the voltage difference between the two ends of a given dumbbell ( which is a model of the voltage difference between the opposite faces of a given cube ) is given by@xmath97where @xmath98 is another pure number of the order of unity ( again , this follows from dimensional considerations , since @xmath87 is only distance scale in the problem ) .",
    "substituting the squared quantity @xmath99 obtained from ( [ beta ] ) into ( [ alpha ] ) , one gets@xmath100solving for the voltage difference @xmath101 , one obtains@xmath102where the characteristic free - fall voltage scale @xmath103 for characteristic experimental parameters ( @xmath104 cm , @xmath105 kg / m@xmath106 ) is given by@xmath107which is experimentally interesting , given the reasonably large capacitances of the two - cube system .",

    "the order - of - magnitude estimate given above indicates that experiments are feasible .",
    "an experiment was performed at merced , in which a slowly time - varying , inhomogeneous , tidal gravitational field is produced by means of two piles of lead bricks placed diametrically opposite each other on a slowly rotating , circular platform , as the sources of the field .",
    "the two piles of bricks , which weigh approximately a ton , will orbit slowly and symmetrically around a superconducting circuit similar to the one shown in figure 3 , which is suspended inside a dilution refrigerator above the center of the rotating platform .    for simplicity , we consider each pendulum to have two support wires , as shown in figure [ pendula ] , so that the motion is constrained along one dimension .",

    "the magnitude of the gravitational forces will vary according to newton s inverse - square law .  in each instant in time , the forces on the pendula can be calculated .  assuming that the angular frequency of the rotating source masses is sufficiently small , a quasi - static model can be implemented , in which the system is in static equilibrium at any given time .",

    "\\(iii ) charge - separation ?",
    "\\(iv ) charge - separation ?",
    "based on the arguments presented above , we would expect ( i ) to be the outcome , if the cooper pairs were to be able to drag the ions of the lattice into co - motion with these superconducting electrons during free fall . in the tug - of - war between the uncertainty principle and the equivalence principle , the uncertainty principle wins in ( i ) .",
    "by contrast , if there is nothing special about this superconducting system over any other material system , i.e. , if the universality of free fall were to apply to the cooper pairs inside the superconducting circuit so that they would undergo free fall along with the ions , and therefore the superconducting system would remain electrically neutral and unpolarized during free fall , then we would expect ( ii ) to be the outcome .",
    "the equivalence principle wins in ( ii ) .",
    "if , however , there does exist a charge - separation effect , but the ions of the lattice were to drag the cooper pairs into co - motion with the ionic lattice during free fall , then we would expect ( iii ) to be the outcome .",
    "finally , there exists the remote possibility of outcome ( iv ) , which would indicate that newtonian gravity would somehow have failed to produce any deflection at all of the pendula in this experiment , but that nevertheless the system remains electrically neutral and unpolarized in the presence of the ton of bricks .",
    "results from this cavendish - likeexperiment will be presented elsewhere .    under the present experimental conditions of the cavendish - like experiment ,",
    "two of the four outcomes listed above have been ruled out . to understand why let us consider one of the superconducting pendula plumb bobs , and",
    "suppose that a stable dc charge separation effect exist within the plumb bob for @xmath164 .",
    "note that , as shown above , this dc charge separation effect would lead to an internal voltage drop of approximately 1 volt across the superconducting plumb bob . by stable ,",
    "it is meant that there are no time changing quantities so that @xmath165because there is no external electric field to cancel out the internal electric field produced by the predicted stable dc charge separation effect for @xmath166 , there must be a measurable voltage drop across the superconducting plumb bob .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the case of a conductor placed between two parallel plates of a capacitor where there exists a stable charge separation effect but no measurable voltage drop across it .",
    "hence , if we allow the system to evolve at @xmath167 , the cooper pairs deep inside the sc will experience a scalar potential ( @xmath168 ) which imparts energy to the pairs .",
    "@xmath169where we set @xmath170 volt as predicted above . comparing this energy with the ground state energy gap involved in most conventional type i superconductors , @xmath171",
    ", we see that such scalar potential would excite the cooper pairs into the quasi - particle state , thus leading to a pair - breaking mechanism .",
    "therefore , such dc charge separation effect would not be stable and there would be no measurable charge separation in the present cavendish - like experiment . hence outcomes ( i ) and ( iii ) , where a measurable stable dc charge separation effect are expected , have already been ruled out , leaving us with outcome ( ii ) and ( iv ) as the only remaining two possibilities , though in an experiment involving high - frequency perturbations , these two outcome possibilities may remain .",

    "michael scheibner , bong - soo kang , and philip jensen for their assistance concerning the cavendish - like experiment .",
    "in addition to the @xmath55 and the @xmath172 terms , there are also @xmath173 and @xmath174 terms in the perturbation hamiltonian . however , these latter terms lead to energy shifts which vanish in the limit that @xmath175 in comparison with the former . for details , see r.y .",

    "the general relativistic concept of a geodesic  is fundamentally that of a classical trajectory .  as bohr has taught us , however , the very concept of a classical trajectoryloses all physical meaning under circumstances in which the uncertainty principle destroys all such classical trajectories",
    "this is the case here for the free - fall trajectories of cooper pairs inside the superconducting system , since these electron pairs will remain in a _",
    "zero - momentum eigenstate _ during free fall when they are initially prepared in the bcs ground state at the moment of release into free fall ."
