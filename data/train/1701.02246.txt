    "in robotics fields , caging is a type of grasping where robots capture an object by surrounding or hooking it . thus the caging problem based on the shape of the robots and the object",
    "is addressed on geometrical representation .",
    "its mathematical description has been partially studied with focusing on methodology how to cage an object by certain robots .",
    "though it is rigorous , it is not for arbitrary target objects and robots . in this article , we propose an essential of caging to describe arbitrary target objects and robots from a mathematical viewpoint , and then it naturally leads us to a degree of difficulty of escaping and caging .",
    "it is a novel concept of the caging which is connected with practical approaches .",
    "caging or holding an object has been discussed in mathematics field such as @xcite , and has been applied to robotic manipulation in parallel .",
    "rimon and blake raised a caging by two circular robots driven by one parameter in two dimensional planar space @xcite , and formulated its conditions .",
    "wang and kumar proposed caging by multi - robot cooperation with mathematical abstract formulas @xcite .",
    "more than three dimensional caging problem is formulated by @xcite , although only circular and spherical robots are referred . there studies discuss existence of object s free movable space closed by the robots",
    ". hence path connectivity of the free space for the captured object @xcite is an important matter to investigate whether the object is caged or able to escape . as mentioned above , confinement of caging formation is studied by previous works such as @xcite , particularly for problems of two dimensional caging .",
    "additionally although path connectivity can be examined by using probabilistic search algorithm @xcite , the difficulty of caging constraint is not quantitatively qualified .",
    "therefore this paper aims to describe caging problem in robotics in the following viewpoint : to apply the formulation to arbitrary robots and objects ; to reveal difficulty of caging constraint mathematically .    from a mathematical viewpoint ,",
    "we recall the fundamental fact that a compact connected @xmath0-dimensional topological manifold @xmath1 in @xmath0-dimensional euclidean space @xmath2 could be wrapped by the @xmath3-dimensional sphere @xmath4 , which corresponds to holding in the real world . this fact is described well by the homotopy group @xmath5 .",
    "it is based on the mathematical fact that @xmath4 in @xmath2 divides @xmath2 into its inner side and outer side .",
    "the subspace @xmath1 has the configuration space @xmath6 $ ] by the euclidean moves @xmath7 , i.e. , @xmath6=\\{\\psi(m)\\}$ ] .",
    "let us fix the sphere @xmath4 and then it divides @xmath6 $ ] to the part @xmath6_{in}$ ] of the inner side of @xmath4 , that of the outer side , @xmath6_{out}$ ] , and the intersection part @xmath6_{int}$ ] , i.e. , @xmath6=[m]_{in}\\coprod [ m]_{out}\\coprod [ m]_{int}$ ] and @xmath6_{int}:= \\{m ' \\in [ m]\\ | \\",
    "m'\\cap s^{n-1}\\neq \\emptyset\\}$ ] .",
    "if @xmath6_{in}$ ] is not empty , it means that @xmath4 holds @xmath8_{in}$ ] .    on the other hand ,",
    "caging is to divide the configurations space @xmath6 $ ] using an @xmath9 dimensional topological manifold @xmath10 .",
    "then there arises a problem how @xmath10 with 2-codimension can divide the configuration space @xmath6 $ ] mathematically .",
    "this is a fundamental problem on caging .",
    "there are many mathematical studies on this problem to cage some proper geometrical objects using special @xmath10 as mentioned above .",
    "further fruchard and zamfirescu @xcite geometrically studied the geometrical conditions whether a circle holds a convex object @xmath6 $ ] .",
    "rodriguez , mason and ferry investigated geometrical and topological properties the multifinger cages rigorously @xcite .",
    "however there was no investigation on the above fundamental problem for general @xmath1 and @xmath10 .",
    "though the path connectivity of an object @xmath1 in @xmath11 studied well in @xcite is an essential property of caging , it is not sufficient .",
    "for example if we regard a wire puzzle constituting two pieces as a pair of a robot @xmath10 and a target object @xmath1 , @xmath1 is not caged by @xmath10 because there is a path between @xmath1 in of @xmath10 and that of the outer side of @xmath10 . however a wire puzzle should be considered as an example of caging and holding from a practical viewpoint .",
    "it is related to the probabilistic treatment of the path connectivity @xcite .",
    "however the path space is very complicate in general @xcite and it is very difficult to assign a probabilistic measure in the path space .    in order to introduce a degree of escaping mathematically , in this article",
    ", we describe the fundamental problem more mathematically , and then we show that caging is represented in terms of recursion of the simple euclidean moves , i.e. , the piecewise euclidean move defined in definitions [ def : pwem ] and @xcite .",
    "the move means that caging is classified countably and naturally leads us to the degree of difficulty of escaping of @xmath6 $ ] from @xmath10 .",
    "it is closely related to a combinatorial explosion and the wire puzzle .",
    "it means that there might be a difference between practical caging and complete caging . when we capture a complicate object by caging , we propose that the difficulty should be proactively considered from a practical viewpoint .",
    "further if we treat the euclidean moves probabilistically , we could assign a natural measure on the moves .",

    "more practically , the first caging is much more important than higher @xmath27-th caging case because the concerned shape @xmath6 $ ] is not so complicate .",
    "even for the first caging , it is not easy to find whether it is the first caging or not because the dimension of @xmath14 is six if @xmath134 .",
    "determination of the first caging means the determination of topological property of @xmath14 .",

    "thus in order to avoid the problems , there are several attempts and proposals including the c - closure method .",
    "the second named author has investigated the problem using the c - closure concept @xcite . in another way , intuitive geometrical features such as loop shape @xcite and _ double fork and neck _ @xcite help us derive sufficient conditions for caging constraint .",
