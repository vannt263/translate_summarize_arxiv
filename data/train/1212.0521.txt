    "complex uniruled projective varieties are nowadays considered through the mori minimal model program ( mmp ) as the natural generalization to higher dimensions of birationaly ruled surfaces ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in particular , as in the case of ruled surfaces , these are the varieties for which the program does not yield a minimal model , but a mori fiber space .",
    "these varieties are also conjectured to be the natural generalization to higher dimensions of surfaces of negative kodaira dimension , the conjecture being in fact established as long as the abundance conjecture holds true @xcite , hence in particular for smooth threefolds . during the past decades",
    ", the systematic study of the geometry of rational curves on these varieties has been the source of many progress in the structure theory for higher dimensional , possibly singular , projective varieties to which the mmp can be applied .",
    "the situation is much less clear for non complete varieties , in particular affine ones .",
    "the natural analogue of ruledness in this context is the notion of @xmath1-ruledness , a variety @xmath2 being called _ @xmath1__-__ruled _ if it contains a zariski dense open subset @xmath3 of the form @xmath4 for a suitable quasi - projective variety @xmath5 .",
    "a landmark result of miyanishi - sugie @xcite asserts that a smooth affine surface is @xmath1-ruled if and only if it has negative logarithmic kodaira dimension @xcite . for such surfaces",
    ", the projection @xmath6 always extends to a fibration @xmath7 with general fibers isomorphic to the affine line @xmath1 over an open subset of the smooth projective model of @xmath5 , providing the affine counterpart of the fact that a smooth birationaly ruled projective surface has the structure of a fibration with general fibers isomorphic to @xmath8 over a smooth projective curve .",
    "this result , together with the description of the geometry of degenerate fibers of these fibrations , has been one of the cornerstones of the structure theory of smooth affine surfaces developed during the past decades .",
    "but in contrast , the foundations for a systematic study of @xmath1-ruled affine threefolds have been only laid recently in @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , from the point of view of logarithmic kodaira dimension , the appropriate counterpart of the notion of uniruledness for a non necessarily complete variety @xmath2 is to require that @xmath2 is generically covered by images of the affine line @xmath1 , in the sense that the set of points @xmath9 with the property that there exists a non constant morphism @xmath10 such that @xmath11 is dense in @xmath2 with respect to the zariski topology .",

    "a smooth @xmath1-uniruled quasi - projective variety @xmath2 has negative logarithmic kodaira dimension .",
    "it is conjectured that the converse holds true in any dimension , but so far , the conjecture has been only established in the case of surfaces by keel and mckernan @xcite .",
    "it follows in particular from these results that for smooth affine surfaces the notions of @xmath1-ruledness and @xmath1-uniruledness coincide .",
    "pursuing further the analogy with the classical projective notions , it seems then natural to expect that these do no longer coincide for higher dimensional affine varieties .",
    "our main result confirms that this is indeed the case .",
    "namely , we establish the following :    for every @xmath14 , the complement of a smooth hypersurface @xmath15 of degree @xmath16 in @xmath17 is @xmath1-uniruled but not @xmath1-ruled .    the anti - ampleness of the divisor @xmath18 enables to easily deduce the @xmath1-uniruledness of affine varieties of the form @xmath19 from the general log - deformation theory for rational curves developed by keel and mckernan @xcite . the failure of @xmath1-ruledness",
    "is then obtained in a more indirect fashion .",
    "indeed , it turns out that for the varieties under consideration , @xmath1-ruledness is equivalent to the stronger property that they admit a non trivial action of the additive group @xmath20 .",
    "we then exploit two deep results of projective geometry , namely the non rationality of the smooth cubic threefold in @xmath21 in the case @xmath22 and the birational super - rigidity of smooth hypersurfaces @xmath23 if @xmath24 , to exclude the existence of such non trivial actions .    in the last section",
    ", we consider more closely the case of complements of smooth cubic surfaces in @xmath25 which provides a good illustration of the subtle but crucial difference between the two notions of @xmath1-ruledness and @xmath1-uniruledness in higher dimension .",
    "we show in particular that even though such complements are not @xmath1-ruled they admit natural fibrations by @xmath1-ruled affine surfaces .",
    "we study automorphisms of such fibrations in relation with the problem of deciding whether every automorphism of the complement of a smooth cubic surface is induced by a linear transformation of the ambient space @xmath25 .",
    "here we review general properties of affine ruled varieties , with a particular focus on the interplay between @xmath1-ruledness of an affine variety and the existence of non trivial algebraic actions of the additive group @xmath20 on it .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for basic properties of the correspondence between such actions on affine varieties and their algebraic counterpart , the so - called locally nilpotent derivations of their coordinate rings .    a quasi - projective variety @xmath2 is called _ affine ruled _ or @xmath1__-ruled _ _ if it contains a zariski dense open subset @xmath3 of the form @xmath4 for a suitable quasi - projective variety @xmath5 .",

    "the converse is not true since for instance the product of the punctured affine line @xmath28 with a smooth projective curve of positive genus is ruled but does not contain any @xmath1-cylinder . in particular , in contrast with ruledness , the property of being @xmath1-ruled is not invariant under birational equivalence .",
    "note similarly that the existence of an @xmath1-cylindrical open subset of @xmath2 is a stronger requirement than that of a dominant birational morphism @xmath29 for a suitable variety @xmath5 : for instance , the affine cone @xmath30 over a projective plane curve @xmath31 of positive genus does not contain @xmath1-cylinders but on the other hand , blowing - up the vertex of the cone @xmath2 yields a smooth quasi - projective variety @xmath32 with the structure of a locally trivial @xmath1-bundle @xmath33 hence , restricting to a subset @xmath5 of @xmath34 over which @xmath35 is trivial , a dominant birational morphism @xmath36 .",

    "let us briefly recall the argument for the convenience of the reader : the existence of a principal @xmath1-cylinder in @xmath2 is equivalent to the existence of an element @xmath51 and an isomorphism of @xmath38-algebra @xmath52 $ ] , where @xmath53 is transcendental over @xmath54 .",

    "it is worthwhile to note that the strategy to establish this fact in case of @xmath22 is quite different from that of the case of @xmath91 .      here",
    "we will exploit the birational super - rigidity of smooth hypersurfaces @xmath23 of degree @xmath92 to deduce that the corresponding affine varieties @xmath93 are not @xmath1-ruled .",

    ". then @xmath100 is birationaly super - rigid .",
    "[ rk : birsuprig - auto ] a noteworthy consequence of the above result is that every birational map @xmath101 between smooth hypersurfaces of degree @xmath16 is in fact a biregular isomorphism which has the additional property to be induced by the restriction of a linear transformation of the ambient space @xmath17 .",
    "this follows from the fact that anti - canonical divisors on @xmath15 coincide with hyperplane sections of @xmath15 .",
    "in particular , the group @xmath102 of birational automorphisms of @xmath15 coincides with that of projective automorphisms @xmath103 and the latter is a finite group .",
    "now we are ready to prove the following :    [ prop : non - ruled - n4 ] the complement of every smooth hypersurface @xmath90 of degree @xmath24 is @xmath1-uniruled but not @xmath1-ruled .",
    "the @xmath1-uniruledness of @xmath93 is an immediate consequence of theorem [ thm : log - uni - crit ] .",

    "since a smooth cubic surface @xmath114 in @xmath25 is rational , the same argument as in the previous section depending on birational super - rigidity is no longer applicable to deduce the non @xmath1-ruledness of its complement @xmath115 .",
