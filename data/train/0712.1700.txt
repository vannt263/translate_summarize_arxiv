    "scattering of waves in periodic structures ( e.g. in a crystalline solid material ) can be described by bloch s theorem @xcite , a theory that gives extended , propagating waves .",
    "a completely different situation appears if the periodicity of the scattering structure is disturbed by disorder : the scattered waves do not propagate any longer but become _ localized _ due to complex interference effects , provided that the disorder is sufficiently strong .",
    "this phenomenon , also known as _ anderson localization _",
    ", was originally proposed for quantum states @xcite and later discussed in more detail in terms of a renormalization approach by abrahams et al .",
    "an important finding of the latter is that the tendency towards localization is stronger in low dimensions than it is in higher dimensions .",
    "according to this approach , quantum states are always localized in one and two dimensions , regardless of the strength of disorder",
    ". however , there are exceptions from this result . one case , where delocalized states can appear in the presence of random scattering in two dimensions , are relativistic ( dirac ) states @xcite .",
    "the main difference between nonrelativistic ( schrdinger ) and relativistic ( dirac ) states is that the former are scalar and the latter are spinor ( i.e. vector ) states , indicating that the dimensionality of the state ( i.e. scalar vs. vector ) plays a crucial role in the appearance of localization .",
    "scattering of electromagnetic waves in a random ensemble of scatterers is a common problem in physics , biology , engineering , and astronomy .",
    "it can be used for a remote analysis of complex objects like , for instance , the surface of a distant planet .",
    "a characteristic feature of light scattering is coherent backscattering ( a comprehensive review can be found in @xcite ) . in this context , a more exotic and , at least experimentally , less understood subject is anderson localization of light .",
    "this has been studied in terms of theory and experiment by a number of groups @xcite . in particular , the existence of anderson localization for electromagnetic waves was discussed in ref .",
    "in contrast to the localization of quantum states , the electromagnetic field is always a three - dimensional vector field . however , there are special situations in which the scattering process affects only one component of the electromagnetic vector field .",
    "an example is a wave scattered by a stack of layers with different refractive indices ( cf .",
    "1 ) : if the wave vector of the incident wave is perpendicular to the layers , the vector components are scattered separately , and the resulting scattering equation is a scalar one ( the helmholtz equation ) which is formally equivalent to the schrdinger equation of a quantum state . the helmholtz equation has been widely used to study scattering in infinite and semi - infinite random media @xcite . for the case of polarization ,",
    "however , this can only be determined from the vector form of the maxwell equation @xcite .",
    "a particular case of a scattering medium is the layered system with a number of interesting features @xcite .",
    "the arrangements of layers is either periodic with an alternating refractive index or the refractive index changes randomly from layer to layer .",
    "realizations of layered systems can be found in biological tissues , in the atmosphere , and in coated optical devices .",
    "the effect of anderson localization then can be used to protect and cover an object if the latter is coated with random layers of non - absorptive materials .",
    "the advantage of this effect is that the electromagnetic waves are prevented to enter the coated object without absorbing the electromagnetic waves .",
    "an important aspect of the layered system is that the scattering is effectively a one - dimensional process .",
    "since the vector components of the electromagnetic wave scatter independently only if the incident wave is perpendicular to the layers , by changing the direction of the incident wave one can couple the components of the electromagnetic wave in the scattering process . in other words , we can tune our scattering process from being a scalar one to being a vector one .",
    "thus the scattering by layers will allow us to study the dependence of localization effects on the scalar or vector nature of the scattered field .",
    "in this paper we study the localization of electromagnetic waves by a stack of layers with randomly chosen refractive indices .",
    "the strength of localization is characterized by the lyapunov exponent of the scattered wave in the direction perpendicular to the layers .",
    "it can be understood as the inverse of the localization length which can be measured in experiments .",
    "the advantage of considering the lyapunov exponent in our calculations is the fact that it is believed to be a self - averaging quantity @xcite .",
    "this enables us to perform the calculation without averaging over random ensembles .",
    "our aim is to compare anderson localization with absorption , where the latter is described by an imaginary part in the refractive index @xcite .",
    "both effects lead to an exponential decay of the intensity of light along the scattering process .",
    "the difference of their physical origin , however , should lead to different behavior with respect to wavelength and angle of the incident light .",
    "we consider a 3d system with random dielectric layers that are perpendicular to the @xmath0 direction with refractive index @xmath1 .",
    "for the electric field @xmath2 we can use the ansatz as a stationary plane wave in @xmath3 and @xmath4 direction : @xmath5 using the short - hand notation @xmath6 and @xmath7 , the electric field is determined by the maxwell equation ( x)=(x)*e*(x )  ,   ( x)=n(x)^2(/c)^2 .
