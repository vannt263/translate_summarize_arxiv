    "the surface chemical composition of extremely metal - poor stars is believed to reflect the yields of heavy elements produced by the first generations of massive stars in our galaxy . reported large variations of the elemental abundance patterns of some species ( in particular those associated with carbon and the neutron - capture elements ) found in very metal - poor stars ( e.g. , mcwilliam et al .",
    "1995 ; ryan , norris , & beers 1996 ; cayrel et al . 2004 ) suggest a diversity of the nucleosynthesis and explosion mechanisms of the supernovae which were presumably responsible .",
    "our previous study of the extremely metal - poor star cs  29498043 ( [ fe / h]@xmath3 ) = @xmath4 , and @xmath5 for elements a and b. ] revealed remarkable overabundances of c , n , mg , and si in this object @xcite .",
    "the chemical nature of this object , which is similar to that of another extremely metal - poor star , cs  22949037 ( mcwilliam et al .",
    "1995 , norris , ryan & beers 2001 ; depagne et al .",
    "2002 ) , suggests that these objects formed from the yields of supernovae that ejected relatively little material from the regions surrounding their iron cores at the time of their explosion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a remaining important question is the origin of the large overabundances of c and n , because these two elements are expected to be significantly affected during the evolution of low - mass stars . in order to distinguish the contributions of low- and high - mass stars , determinations of the o abundance , as well as those of the @xmath2 elements , are quite important .",
    "the o abundance is also vital to estimate the metallicity of this object . in this paper",
    ", we report a new analysis of the chemical composition of cs  29498043 , including the o abundance , derived from high - resolution , high signal - to - noise spectra obtained with the subaru telescope .",
    "the observations reported herein were obtained with the subaru telescope high dispersion spectrograph ( hds ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with a spectral resolving power @xmath6 , in october 2002 and may 2003 .",
    "the wavelength coverage and signal - to - noise ratios per pixel ( s / n ) are listed in table  [ tab : obs ] .",
    "the eev - ccd with 13.5  @xmath7 m pixels was used with the @xmath82 binning mode .",
    "standard data reduction procedures were carried out with the iraf echelle package .    for the abundance analysis described herein , we combined these spectra with a similar - quality blue spectrum obtained in our previous study @xcite .",
    "equivalent widths of absorption lines for 12 metals ( 14 ionization species ) were measured by fitting gaussian profiles , and are listed in table [ tab : ew ] along with the line data used in the analysis .    in order to investigate the binarity of this object , which might have relevance for the interpretation of the origin of the abundance peculiarities , we measured heliocentric radial velocities ( @xmath9 ) for each spectrum , as given in table  [ tab : obs ] .",
    "the measurements were made using clean , isolated lines .",
    "our measurements for spectra obtained in previous observing runs are also given in table  [ tab : obs ] .",
    "no clear variation of the radial velocities is found for this object , although the @xmath9 values are slightly decreasing over the past three years .",
    "further monitoring of radial velocity to determine if it is in fact a long - period binary is clearly desirable .",
    "an lte abundance analysis was carried out using the model atmospheres of @xcite .",
    "an estimate of the effective temperature , @xmath10 , was obtained from the @xmath11 color index , using the @xcite empirical temperature scale , adopting the photometry data from @xcite ( @xmath12 ) and from the 2 micron all sky survey point source catalog @xcite ( @xmath13 ) , along with an interstellar reddening of @xmath14 , estimated from the @xcite map .",
    "we adopted @xmath15  k for the following abundance analysis .",
    "after the analysis was completed , @xmath16 and @xmath17 photometry data also became available , obtained with the eso - danish 1.54 m telescope and dfosc .",
    "the derived colors , @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( cousins system ) , result in temperature estimates of @xmath20  k and 4500  k , respectively , if alonso et al .",
    "( 1999 ) s scale is applied .",
    "these results support our effective temperature determined from the @xmath11 color .    in our previous analysis @xcite",
    ", we adopted @xmath21  k as a preferred value , taking account of the correlation between the derived fe abundances and the lower excitation potential of lines found in the result for @xmath15  k. however , this correlation is not clear in the present analysis , which includes new lines detected in the revised spectrum covering both blue and red ranges , especially the lines with high excitation potentials ( @xmath22  ev ) . for this reason ,",
    "we have adopted @xmath23  k as the preferred value , but consider 4400  k as an alternative choice .    using the model atmospheres of @xcite for the adopted effective temperatures , we performed abundance analyses in the standard manner for the measured equivalent widths .",
    "surface gravities ( @xmath24 ) were determined from the ionization balance between fe i and fe ii ; the microturbulence ( @xmath25 ) was determined from the fe i lines by demanding no dependence of the derived abundance on equivalent widths .",
    "the effect of large enhancements of c , n , mg , and si were included in the calculation of chemical equilibrium for the abundance analysis .",
    "the excess of oxygen found in the present analysis , as noted below , was also taken into account .",
    "we note that these effects are not included in the calculations of the thermal structure of atmospheres , but they are estimated to be small for such low metallicity stars .",
    "the final derived atmospheric parameters are @xmath26  km  s@xmath27 and [ fe / h]@xmath28 .",
    "the derived abundances ( [ x / fe ] and [ fe / h ] ) are listed in table  [ tab : res ] .",
    "the sixth column provides the results when @xmath29  k is adopted .",
    "the surface gravity , determined by the same methods , but for @xmath29  k , is @xmath30 . the same microturbulence and metallicity as for @xmath23  k were used .",
    "for comparison , in the last column of this table , we also provide the chemical abundances derived for the atmospheric parameters adopted by @xcite ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 and [ fe / h]@xmath28 ) .",
    "since the iron abundances from and derived by our ( lte ) analysis show a significant discrepancy ( 0.5  dex ) , we assumed [ fe / h]@xmath28 , which is similar to the value derived from lines , to derive [ x / fe ] values for individual elements .",
    "the [ ] 6300   line is clearly detected in the spectrum of cs  29498043 . since , at this wavelength",
    ", the october 2002 spectrum is significantly affected by strong [ ] emission in the earth s atmosphere , the analysis was made using the may 2003 spectrum , which provided a more favorable velocity shift .",
    "figure  [ fig : o1f]a shows a comparison of the spectra of cs  29498043 and a standard star ( hd  178840 ) observed just after the observation of cs  29498043 with a similar zenith distance .",
    "we confirmed that the telluric lines are corrected by the spectrum of the standard star within 1  % of the continuum level for the lines at 6295.9 , 6298.4 , and 6302.0   .",
    "this indicates that telluric absorption does not significantly affect the measurement of the equivalent width of the [ ] line , which is estimated to be 31.4 m ( table 2 ) .",
    "the spectrum of this star , corrected for the telluric absorption lines ( primarily h@xmath33o ) and the doppler shift estimated from clean lines , is shown as the heavy dots in figure  [ fig : o1f]b .",
    "the lines are synthetic spectra for the three assumed oxygen abundances presented in the figure(o)@xmath34=8.74 determined from the 6300   forbidden line by @xcite , which is consistent with @xcite within the uncertainty . ] .",
    "the equivalent width of the [ ] 6363   line measured for our spectrum is 14  m , which provides a consistent oxygen abundance with that obtained from the [ ] 6300   .",
    "however , the quality of the observed spectrum at 6363   is not as good as that at 6300   , and a few unidentified lines with similar strengths to the [ ] 6363   line appear around this wavelength .",
    "therefore , we adopt the result obtained from the [ ] 6300   line for the oxygen abundance derived from forbidden lines .",
    "the triplet lines at 77707776   are also clearly detected in cs  29498043 .",
    "figure [ fig : o1ir ] shows the observed and synthetic spectra for this wavelength range .",
    "we note that the observed spectrum in this wavelength range is , unfortunately , affected by fringes due to interference occurring at the surface of the ccd @xcite . however , our equivalent widths agree well with those measured by @xcite for their keck / hires spectrum .",
    "the oxygen abundance derived from the triplet is 0.47  dex higher than that obtained from the forbidden line ( table  [ tab : res ] ) . however",
    ", it should also be noted that the triplet lines are known to be significantly affected by nlte effects . @xcite",
    "estimated the nlte correction for the oxygen abundance derived from the triplet lines to be about @xmath35  dex for giants with @xmath36  k. this correction reduces the discrepancy between the oxygen abundances from the triplet and forbidden lines to about 0.4  dex .",
    "similar discrepancies have also been found in other very metal - poor ( [ fe / h]@xmath37 ) stars studied in detail by @xcite .",
    "hence , we do not pursue the origin of this problem further .",
    "we note that the discrepancy is larger ( @xmath38 dex , after nlte correction ) if the lower effective temperature ( 4400  k ) is adopted , since the strengths of the high excitation triplet lines are quite sensitive to temperature .",
    "we adopt the oxygen abundance derived from the forbidden line in the following discussion , because the result is insensitive to the temperature and nlte corrections .",
    "@xcite recently reported a large o overabundance for cs  29498 - 043 from an analysis of the triplet ( [ o / fe]=+3.12 ) , adopting @xmath39=4300  k. the oxygen abundance derived by our lte analysis for the triplet lines adopting their atmospheric parameters is [ o / fe]=+3.36 .",
    "they reported the nlte correction for the oxygen abundance derived from the triplet lines to @xmath40  dex for this object ; after applying this correction , our results agree very well with theirs .",
    "in addition , @xcite also reported the oxygen abundance from the forbidden line that is about 0.5  dex lower than that from the triplet line ( the discrepancy is about 0.8  dex after the nlte correction is applied ) .",
    "this large discrepancy , compared with that found in our above analysis for @xmath23  k ( 0.4  dex ) , is likely due to the low assumed effective temperature ( 4300  k ) . @xcite",
    "have also detected the triplet in the extremely metal - poor star cs  22949037 , which also exhibits similar overabundances in c , n , o , and the @xmath2-elements as in cs  29498043 .",
    "they reported an even more significant discrepancy ( 1.2  dex ) between the oxygen abundances derived from the triplet and the forbidden line @xcite for cs  22949037 .",
    "given the large discrepancy of oxygen abundances in this object , and also in cs  29498043 , further detailed discussion of o abundances in these objects is difficult .",
    "however , it remains clear that the o overabundances are remarkable in these two stars .      a standard analysis using model atmospheres",
    "was performed for the measured equivalent widths for most of the other detectable elements , while a spectrum synthesis technique was applied for the c@xmath33 and cn molecular bands , and the al and mn lines which exhibit contamination from ch molecular lines .",
    "the analysis technique and molecular line data are the same as reported in @xcite .",
    "an exception is that the effect of hyperfine splitting is included in the analysis of mn and co lines , using the line list of @xcite and @xcite , respectively , in the present work .",
    "the results are listed in table  [ tab : res ] .",
    "the abundances of the species co and ni , which were not detected in the previous spectrum , are reported here for the first time .",
    "we searched for mgh @xmath41 lines in the region 51005200   , but found no clear feature of this molecule .",
    "since the strength of the strongest mgh lines expected for the mg abundance in table  [ tab : res ] is about 1  m , spectra with higher quality are required to measure the mgh features .",
    "random abundance errors in the analysis are estimated from the standard deviation of the abundances derived from individual lines for each species .",
    "these values are sometimes unrealistically small , however , when only a few lines are detected .",
    "for this reason , we adopted the larger of ( a ) the value for the listed species and ( b ) that for ( 0.09  dex ) as estimates of the random errors .",
    "errors arising from uncertainties of the atmospheric parameters were evaluated using @xmath42  k , @xmath43 , and @xmath44  km s@xmath27 . finally , we derived the total uncertainty by adding in quadrature the individual errors , and list them in table [ tab : res ] .",
    "nlte effects on our abundance analysis are estimated from the study of metal - poor giants by @xcite .",
    "they derived the abundance corrections ( [ x / h]@xmath45[x / h]@xmath46 ) for fe ( derived from lines ) , na ( from the d - lines ) and mg to be typically + 0.1 , + 0.0 , and + 0.2  dex , respectively , for stars with @xmath4740005000  k and @xmath32 .",
    "the correction for fe abundance propagates to a change of estimated surface gravity , which is determined from the ionization equilibrium between and , by about 0.3  dex .",
    "though this correction will make a systematic change of the abundance results , the effect is still within the uncertainties estimated above .",
    "recent studies of o abundances in very metal - poor stars , within the framework of one - dimensional model atmospheres , have revealed the presence of a possible increase of o / fe ratios with decreasing metallicity in the range of [ fe / h]@xmath37 .",
    "figure [ fig : ofe ] shows [ o / fe ] as a function of [ fe / h ] for our object and for other stars described in the literature @xcite .",
    "the filled symbols show the [ o / fe ] values determined from the [ ] line , while open symbols indicate those obtained from either the triplet lines or oh molecular lines .",
    "a discrepancy between the results from the different indicators is seen , as discussed in subsection 3.1 . however , the o overabundance of cs  29498043 , as well as that of cs  22949037 @xcite , is unusually high , compared with the other very metal - poor stars ( [ o / fe]@xmath48 ) .",
    "the [ o / fe ] of the most iron - deficient star presently known , he  01075240 ( [ fe / h ] = -5.3 ; christlieb et al .",
    "2002 , 2004 ) is also as high as found in these two stars @xcite .",
    "we note that , even though three of the four objects with [ fe / h]@xmath49 have [ o / fe]@xmath50 , there are stars in this metallicity range in which oxygen lines are _ not _ detected , and hence whose oxygen abundances are not as high as in these three stars . though it remains possible that [ o / fe ] values continuously increase with decreasing [ fe / h ] for stars with [ fe / h]@xmath51 , the unusually high oxygen abundances in the above three stars are more likely to arise from a different nucleosynthesis history from that pertaining to other metal - deficient stars .",
    "figure [ fig : res ] shows the relative elemental abundances ( [ x / fe ] ) , as a function of atomic number , for cs  29498043 and cs  22949037 .",
    "the similarity of the abundance patterns between these two stars is remarkable .",
    "the present analysis for the new spectrum of cs  29498043 confirms the similarity for o and na , which show large overabundances in both stars .",
    "the [ o / fe ] value of cs  29498043 is higher , by 0.36  dex , than that of cs  22949037 , if the same solar o abundance is adopted .",
    "however , we do yet not insist on a real difference of the o abundances between the two stars , taking account of the uncertainty in the o abundance determination ( as seen , e.g. , in the discrepancy in the results between the [ ] line(s ) and the o triplet ) .",
    "recall that for the present analysis , the o abundances in both objects were determined from the [ ] 6300   line .",
    "the solid line in figure [ fig : res ] shows the abundance ratios predicted by the supernova model of @xcite for a 30  @xmath52 star , assuming substantial mixing and fall - back ( umeda & nomoto 2004 ) .",
    "the large overabundances of c , o , mg , and si relative to iron - peak elements are well reproduced by this model .",
    "the large overabundance of n in these stars could be associated with the operation of the cn - cycle during their evolution on the red - giant branch @xcite .",
    "note as well that the co / fe and ni / fe ratios of cs  29498043 might be slightly lower than those of cs  22949037 .",
    "the upper - limit on the zn abundance of cs  29498043 is also lower than the zn abundance of the other object . in the umeda & nomoto ( 2004 ) models , lower co and zn abundance ratios indicate a smaller explosion energy and/or more effective mixing .",
    "more accurate estimates of the abundance ratios of these elements in the present objects , as well as for other similar stars that might be found in the future , are desirable to better constrain the parameters of the present explosion models .",
    "finally , we would like to consider the metallicity of these objects and their extremely low iron abundances .",
    "we here define the metallicity by the _",
    "total abundance _ of c , n , o , mg , si , and fe , i.e. , [ a / h]=[(c+n+o+mg+si+fe)/h ] . the metallicities of cs  29498043 and cs  22949037 , using this definition , are [ a / h]@xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively .",
    "oxygen is the most important contributor to the metallicity in these stars ( 6070% of the metallic species ) .",
    "when we adopt the above definition of metallicity , these three objects might be regarded as _ extremely iron - deficient stars _ rather than _ extremely metal - poor stars_.    the metallicity of the most iron - poor ( [ fe / h]@xmath55 ) star he  01075240 @xcite is [ a / h]@xmath56 , using this definition , adopting [ o / fe]@xmath57 @xcite , and assuming [ si / fe]=0.0 . in this case , however , the dominant contributor to the metallicity is carbon ( about 95% ) . the abundance pattern of this object can also be explained by supernova models by @xcite , assuming a larger mixing region and a smaller matter ejection factor .",
    "although this object shows no clear overabundance of @xmath2-elements , the origin of its peculiar abundance pattern may be related to those of cs  29498043 and cs  22049037 .",
    "the extremely iron - deficient ( [ fe / h]@xmath49 ) stars found in previous studies ( norris et al .",
    "2001 , carretta et al .",
    "2002 , francois et al .",
    "2003 ) , in general , _ do not exhibit _ large excesses of lighter elements , except for cs  22949037 ( norris et al .",
    "these stars can be regarded as extreme cases of metal - deficient stars with higher iron abundance ( @xmath58[fe / h]@xmath59 ) , which would form from interstellar matter polluted by first - generation supernovae .",
    "their extremely low metallicity suggests high explosion energies of the supernovae that provided metals , and induced the formation of second - generation stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "hence , the formation mechanism of the above three iron - deficient stars with excesses of c and o may be quite different from the other iron - deficient stars .",
    "even though their total atmospheric metallicities are rather high ( [ a / h]@xmath60 ) , these three stars are also expected to be produced from material polluted by first - generation supernovae , because of their peculiar abundance patterns .",
    "however , the extremely low iron abundances of these objects might be regarded as resulting from the particular yields of their progenitors , rather than from mixing processes within the interstellar matter from which they were formed .",
    "the relatively high total metallicity of these objects may indicate low explosion energies of the supernovae which induced the formation of these objects .",
    "if the species c and o were present in the interstellar matter of the birth clouds of these objects they would supply important cooling sources , in particular for he  01075240 , hence their overabundances may help understand the possibility of low - mass star formation in the early galaxy , as suggested by @xcite ( see also bromm & loeb 2003 ) .",
    "this may also explain the existence of the plethora of c - rich objects amongst extremely iron - deficient stars ( norris , ryan , & beers 1997 ; beers 1999 ; rossi et al .",
    "further abundance studies of stars with extremely low iron abundances are indispensable to establish the proper classification of these stars , and to understand the formation mechanism(s ) of early - generation stars in our galaxy .",
