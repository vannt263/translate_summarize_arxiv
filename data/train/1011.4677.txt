    "stimulated by the recent discovery of strong coupling of magnetism and ferroelectricity in some frustrated manganites as tbmno@xmath1 and tbmn@xmath2o@xmath3 @xcite , the research on multiferroics has attracted worldwide attention . in these materials ,",
    "both magnetic and ferroelectric orders coexist . although this kind of coexistence has been discovered decades ago , most known multiferroic materials , e.g. bifeo3 , show very weak magnetoelectric coupling because their ferroelectricity and magnetism come from different ions in the unit cell , with partially filled @xmath4 shells and empty @xmath4 shells respectively .",
    "these two orders , therefore , tend to be mutually exclusive and interact weakly with each other@xcite . on the contrary , the ferroelectricity found in these frustrated manganites is of magnetic origin , i.e. , induced by complex spin configuration .",
    "the spontaneous electric polarization occurs in special magnetically ordered states which break the inversion symmetry , and the electric polarization can be switched and reversed via changing the magnetic states by external magnetic field .",
    "these fascinating phenomena are of great importance both for the fundamental physics and potential technological application @xcite .",
    "there are several reported types of magnetic orderings which can break the space inversion invariance and produce spontaneous electric polarization .",
    "for example , the simple inequivalent nearest - neighbor exchange striction in the commensurate collinear @xmath5 spin chains can shift ions away from centrosymmetric positions and induce the electric polarization along the spin chain .",
    "but most of the realistic multiferroic frustrated magnets are of much more complex spin configurations , which are usually noncollinear and incommensurate at low temperatures .",
    "one of the commonly accepted microscopic mechanism comes down to the inverse dzyaloshinskii - moriya(dm ) interaction , which was first proposed as an antisymmetric relativistic correction to the superexchange coupling@xcite .",
    "it can also be expressed as the equivalent spin current model by katsura , nagaosa and balatsky(knb)@xcite . according to their theoretic analysis ,",
    "the microscopic polarization induced by neighboring spins can be formulated as @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the coupling constant determined by the spin - orbit coupling and exchange interactions , and @xmath8 the unit vector connecting site @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "it is also consistent with the corresponding phenomenological symmetry analysis@xcite , and has worked well in the helimagnetic tbmno@xmath1 and other multiferroics .",
    "but at present the accurate prediction of the magnitude still lacks since much more complicated factors in real systems must be considered@xcite .    on the other hand , according to the known microscopic mechanism of magnetoelectric coupling , the polarization and dielectric properties of multiferroic compounds can also help to explore the complex magnetic structures , which traditionally have to be characterized by the much more difficult and expensive experimental techniques such as neutron diffraction @xcite .    at present , our particular interest is on the recently discovered multiferroicity in iron vanadate(fevo@xmath0 ) .",
    "the crystal structure of fevo@xmath0 has been investigated in the early 1970s@xcite .",
    "fevo@xmath0 have a triclinic crystal structure ( ref : pdf number 71 - 1592 space group @xmath11 , @xmath12=6.719 , @xmath13=8.060 , @xmath14=9.254 , @xmath15=96.4@xmath16,@xmath17=106.8@xmath16 , @xmath18=101.5@xmath16 ) , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.1 ] .",
    "the magnetism of fevo@xmath0 comes from the fe@xmath19 ions at three different sites , which is orbitally quenched and in the high spin @xmath20 state .",
    "the fe@xmath19 ions form a peculiar chain - like structures , well separated by non - magnetic vo@xmath0 tetrahedrons .",
    "the complex fe - o - fe superexchange ( se ) and fe - o - o - fe super - super - exchange(sse ) interactions between fe@xmath19 ions lead to the magnetic frustration in fevo@xmath0 , and therefore complex magnetic behavior .",
    "disclosed by the recent measurements of susceptibility and heat capacity @xcite , fevo@xmath0 undergos two successive magnetic transitions at t@xmath2122k and t@xmath2215k respectively . the preliminary neutron diffraction experiment ( in zero field )",
    "reveals a spiral spin structure at lower temperature ( t@xmath23t@xmath24 ) , while a collinear antiferromagnetic(afm ) ordering in the intermediate state(t@xmath24@xmath23t@xmath23t@xmath25)@xcite .",
    "the two kinds of magnetic structures are both incommensurate but the ferroelectricity is found only concomitant with the non - collinear magnetic order at low temperature .",
    "the physical nature of its multiferroicity , however , remains elusive .",
    "the detailed magnetic structure and its further evolution with external field deserve further in - depth research .",
    "till now , there is only a few reports on the multiferroic fevo@xmath0 .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we carried out the systematically dielectric , ferroelectric and magnetic measurements on polycrystalline fevo@xmath0 at low temperatures .",
    "out work will help to determine the complex magnetic structures and further unravel the microscopic mechanism of the multiferroicity in fevo@xmath0 .",

    "the detailed procedures have been described elsewhere@xcite .",
    "it is notable that v@xmath26o@xmath28 is volatile and reacts with alumina crucible at high temperature , which leads to the heavy contamination of the samples",
    ". the use of alumina crucibles should therefore be avoided , and instead , a platinum crucible with a cover is recommended in the sinter procedure .",
    "magnetic properties were measured on a squid magnetometer(mpms-5s , quantum design ) and a 9t - physical properties measurement system ( ppms ) with a magnetization option .",
    "to measure dielectric properties of fevo@xmath0 , the polycrystalline bulk is polished to thin plates with thickness of @xmath29 mm .",
    "we use silver epoxy attached to both sides as electrodes to form a parallel plate capacitor whose capacitance is proportional to the dielectric constant(@xmath30 ) .",
    "the samples are glued on the cryogenic stage of our homemade probe , and connected to a high - precision capacitance meter .",
    "the main sources of error as residual impedance in the whole circuit are carefully considered and compensated .",
    "our measure system has been tested with the standard commercial capacitors(0.5 - 10pf ) , which is close to our samples . for temperature - dependent dielectric measurements ,",
    "the sample s capacitance was measured over a range of frequencies with an excitation of 1 v , while the temperature was swept at a very slow warming or cooling rate(0.1k-0.5k / min ) to avoid the thermal inhomogeneity and lagging feedback of the cernox thermometer .",
    "we also tried different excitations(50mv to 1v ) , sweeping rates and so on .",
    "no apparent difference was found in the different conditions .",
    "the electric polarization ( @xmath31 ) is obtained from the integration of the measured pyroelectric current .",
    "we first poled the sample during the cooling process with applied electric field of over 400kv / m , then removed the electric field and shorted the sample at lowest temperature for at least 30 minutes to discharge the free charge carriers .",

    "the effective magnetic moment(@xmath36 ) in the paramagnetic phase is about 5.96@xmath37 , which is deduced from the fitted curie constant @xmath38 .",

    "it is also noted that the transition temperatures reported by he et al @xcite(20k and 13k respectively ) , are quite lower , possibly due to the al contamination from the alumina crucibles used in the crystal growth process .",
    "[ fig.3](a ) shows our raw data of the sample capacitance in zero field , which is proportional to the dielectric constant of fevo@xmath0 .",
    "the most remarkable feature is the sharp peaks of dielectric anomaly at t@xmath24 , which is clearly observed for all our testing frequencies , indicating the high quality of our sample .",

    "the sharp peak in the dielectric loss at t@xmath24 coincides with the peak in @xmath30(t ) , which is a typical feature of proper ferroelectric transition .",

    ", there is no discernable difference between the two h@xmath43e and h@xmath44e measuring configurations , since the intrinsic anisotropy in fevo@xmath0 is canceled out in our polycrystalline bulk .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.4](a ) , the slight discontinuous increase in @xmath30(t ) around t@xmath25 , which is associated with the first magnetic transition , remain almost unchanged by magnetic field up to 9 t . to demonstrate the fine variance in @xmath30(t ) induced by h , , the corresponding temperature derivative of @xmath30(t )",

    "[ fig.4](c ) .",
    "the most remarkable feature induced by magnetic field occurs around the second magnetic transition at t@xmath24(@xmath4515.4k ) .",
    "the sharp peak in @xmath30(t ) in zero field is gradually suppressed by increasing magnetic fields .",
    "this behavior also occurs in dielectric loss(fig .",
    "[ fig.4](b ) ) , indicating that magnetic field suppresses ferroelectricity .",
    "however , the corresponding transition temperature , which is defined by the maximum of @xmath30(t ) peak , remains unchanged even in the the highest field(h=9 t ) .",
    "another significant characteristic is the emergence of a new dielectric hump around the 14.7k ( denoted as t@xmath42 , which is slightly lower than t@xmath24 ) as h is strong enough ( @xmath343 t ) .",
    "as h grows further , the emerging dielectric hump grows gradually , while the peak at t@xmath24 are further suppressed . the similar behavior is also observed in d(t)(fig .  [ fig.4](b ) ) .",
    "our dielectric measurement has been repeated several times and also on other fevo@xmath0 samples with different sizes to exclude possible extrinsic effects such as space charge and inhomogeneity in ceramics .",
    "all the present results indicate a possible new field - induced new transition at t@xmath42 , which is also a ferroelectric one ( deduced from the simultaneous anomalies in @xmath30 and d independent of the testing frequencies ) . to further confirm the nature of this possible transition",
    ", we also carried out the pyroelectric measurements in different h. the pyroelectric current measured at a fixed warming rate ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.4](d ) ) is proportional to the temperature derivative of electric polarization ( @xmath46 ) and better reveals the field - induced fine change than the @xmath31(t ) curve itself ( see the inset ) .",
    "the pyroelectric current peak in zero field is very sharp , which marks the narrow ferroelectric transition at t@xmath24 .",
    "the peak is suppressed greatly by increasing h. however this suppression by magnetic fields seems to saturate as h@xmath478 t . when h@xmath343 t , a secondary peak of the pyroelectric current emerges and develops with growing h , indicating the new additional ferroelectric polarization induced by external field around t@xmath42 .",
    "the total @xmath31 includes the different contributions from two transitions , which are hard to be separated , as shown in the inset . to our knowledge",
    ", it may be the first evidence that there exist a field - induced new multiferroic transition in the fevo@xmath0 system , which is owed to our accurate and elaborate measurements .",
    "considering the magnetic origin of the ferroelectricity in fevo@xmath0 , the new multiferroic transition must be closely related the change of spin structures in strong fields .",
    "so we performed the magnetization measurements in different fields ( h=0.3 - 9 t ) and the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.5](a ) .",
    "the first magnetization anomaly at t@xmath25 is evident in all h up to 9 t with negligible temperature shift , consistent with the corresponding dielectric measurements(see fig .",
    "[ fig.4](a)and ( c ) ) .",
    "the second magnetization anomaly at t@xmath24 can be clearly discerned only in low fields(h@xmath235 t ) , then gradually fades away with growing up - turn background as h increase further , and finally become indistinguishable in h=9 t .    to further explore the fine change of the low - temperature magnetic states in different h , we measured the field - dependent magnetization , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.5](b ) .",
    "the deviation from linearity in m - h curves is small . to manifest this deviation",
    ", we plotted the corresponding field - dependent susceptibility ( @xmath32(h ) ) in fig .",
    "[ fig.5](c ) .    in the high temperature paramagnetic state(@xmath34t@xmath25 ) , as t=35k , the quite linearity of the m - h curve and nearly constant @xmath32(h ) is observed up to 9 t . in the intermediate state between t@xmath25 and t@xmath24(t=17.5k ) , the @xmath32(h ) deviates slightly from the constant and grows with increasing h. the increase in @xmath32 come possibly from the partial suppression of the antiferromagnetic ordering by external magnetic field .",
    "as cooled further down to t@xmath48 10 and 5 k ( both well below t@xmath42 ) , in zero field , fevo@xmath0 is dominated by the incommensurate helicodal magnetic ordering , which has been disclosed in recent neutron diffraction experiment@xcite .",
    "the nonlinearity in m - h curves becomes much pronounced as h@xmath34 3 t .",
    "especially , a broad kinking appears in @xmath32(h ) between 3 t and 6 t . in the high field limit , the @xmath32(h ) at 5k and 10k seems to merge together , suggesting a new common stable magnetic ground state .",
    "our data indicates a field - induced metamagnetic transition at t@xmath23t@xmath24 , although its nature is still unclear . according to our observed ferroelectric behavior and the the inverse dm mechanism , we conjectured that the new field - induced magnetic phase must be also noncollinear .",
    "the neutron diffraction measurements on fevo@xmath0 in strong fields is greatly expected in future to disclose the new magnetic phase in detail .    by the way , the multiferroicity is usually highly anisotropic , while only bulk average properties can be acquired on our polycrystalline samples .",
    "so the growth of large - sized single crystals is necessary to explore the anisotropic intrinsic dielectric response and electric polarization to unravel the complex magnetic orderings via magnetoelectric coupling in multiferroic fevo@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the effect of the partial substitution of fe@xmath19 by other transition metal ions is also our work under way .     measured in different fields(0.3 - 9 t ) on a 9 t ppms .",
