    "carbon , nitrogen , and oxygen , the ` cno - elements ' , are among the most abundant species after hydrogen and helium .",
    "being formed by p- and @xmath4-capture reactions in the interior of stars , the cno nuclei are partially released by means of stellar winds , planetary nebula ejecta , and supernova explosions into the interstellar medium ( ism ) . @xmath5c and 16  and , qualitatively , 13  and 17 nucleosynthesis appears to be understood ( , wilson & matteucci 1992 ; henkel & mauersberger 1993 ; henkel  1994b ; prantzos  1996 ) .",
    "the dominant cooking site of the rare nitrogen isotope , 15 , is however not yet known .",
    "while 14  is produced in both high and lower mass stars , it is not yet clear whether 14  or 15  is the more ` primary ' isotope ( see sect.[sec:15n - discussion ] ) .    to obtain new constraints for nitrogen nucleosynthesis",
    ", we measured  abundance ratios in so far unexplored molecular environments . the molecular studies by johansson  ( 1994 ) , chin  ( 1996 , 1997 , 1998 ) , and heikkil  ( 1997 , 1998 ) demonstrate that it is possible to detect rare molecular species in the magellanic clouds .",
    "since such metal poor environments may also characterize cosmologically relevant sources at high redshift , we searched for  in three magellanic star - forming regions showing prominent h@xmath5c@xmath6n ( hereafter hcn ) emission . in view of the low  ratios predicted by henkel & mauersberger ( 1993 ) and henkel  ( 1994b ) for starbursts",
    ", we also searched for  in the southern ( post- ) starburst galaxy ngc4945 .",
    "the data were taken in september and november 1997 and in january and july 1998 using the 15-m swedish - eso submillimetre telescope ( sest ) at la silla , chile .",
    "a 3 mm sis receiver yielded overall system temperatures , including sky noise , of order  = 250k on a main beam brightness temperature ( ) scale .",
    "the backend was an acousto - optical spectrometer ( aos ) .",
    "a channel separation of 42khz corresponding to 0.14 at 88ghz was employed for the observations toward the magellanic clouds , while the low resolution spectrometer with a channel separation of 0.7mhz ( or 2.4 ) was used for ngc4945 .",
    "the antenna beamwidth was 55  at the observed line frequencies taken from lovas ( 1992 ) .",
    "the observations were carried out in a dual beam - switching mode ( switching frequency 6hz ) with a beam throw of 1140  in azimuth .",
    "all spectral intensities were converted to a  scale , correcting for a main beam efficiency of 0.76 ( l.b.g .",

    "calibration was checked by monitoring on orion kl and ngc4945 and was found to be consistent between different observation periods within @xmath010% .",
    "the pointing accuracy , obtained from measurements of the sio masers rdor and whya , was better than 10 .",
    "toward the prominent lmc star - forming regions n113 and n159hw we have detected the @xmath7 emission lines of hydrogen cyanide ( hcn ) and its rare isotopic species  and .",
    "although they were also detected toward the core of the ( post- ) starburst galaxy ngc4945 ( , koornneef 1993 ) , only hcn was seen in the smc star - forming region lirs36 ( see chin  1998 ) .",
    "spectra and line parameters obtained from gaussian fits are displayed in fig.[fig:15n - spectra ] and table[tbl:15n - parameter ] .",
    "observed line intensity ratios , derived opacities , and isotopic abundance ratios (  and ) are given in table[tbl:15n - ratio ] .",
    "apart from optical depth effects , integrated line intensity ratios should be identical to isotope ratios within the observational errors , since rotational constants of the various hcn isotopomers are similar .",
    "a fractionation of nitrogen isotopes via charge exchange reactions , as expected in the case of carbon ( see watson  1976 ) , must be negligible , because the nitrogen ionization potential is higher than that of hydrogen ; n@xmath8 abundances are small in molecular clouds .",
    "for the two lmc star - forming regions and for ngc4945 we then find  @xmath1 100 . in the case of n113 ,",
    "the  ratio does not depend on an assumption on . instead ,",
    "is _ directly _ derived from the hcn/  integrated line temperature ratio and from a fit to the hcn hyperfine components ( see table[tbl:15n - ratio ] ) . toward n159hw",
    ", the hcn main line also appears to be almost optically thin but a larger intrinsic linewidth makes the fit less convincing .",
    "observations indicate that 14  production involves both , a primary and a secondary component ( , matteucci 1986 ; vila - costas & edmunds 1993 ; van zee  1998 ) , which is currently understood in terms of primary hydrostatic 14  production in massive low metallicity stars ( cf .",
    "laird 1985 , timmes  1995 ) , while the secondary production of 14  through the cno cycle is dominating for @xmath9 @xmath10 z@xmath11 ( cf .  timmes  1995 ; van den hoek & groenewegen 1997 ) .    @xmath12n is destroyed during hydrostatic hydrogen - burning ( , wannier  1991 ; el eid 1994 ; langer & henkel 1995 ) and is thus thought to be a product of explosive hydrogen nucleosynthesis .",
    "it is synthesized in novae as a mostly primary nucleus ( , jos & hernanz 1998 ) .",
    "however , current models produce insufficient amounts to account for the galactic 15  abundance ( kovetz & prialnik 1997 ) . alternatively",
    ", it may be produced in type  ii supernovae through neutrino spallation of primary 16  ( woosley & weaver 1995 , timmes  1995 ; see also audouze  1977 ) . a small contribution from type",
    "ia supernovae is also possible ( clayton  1997 ; although see nomoto  1984 ) . in the first case ( novae ) , there is a time delay between star formation and the occurrence of 15  enriched ejecta , leading to initially high  ratios that gradually decrease with time ( for an illustration , see  fig.4 of gsten & ungerechts 1985 ) . in the second case ( massive stars ) , rapid injection of 15  into the ism leads to initially small  ratios that gradually increase with time when the 14  contribution from low - mass stars becomes significant .",
    "analyzing  data from hcn and , it soon became obvious that local ism and galactic center  ratios are moderately and strongly enhanced relative to the solar system value .",
    "assuming that the solar system , the local ism , and the galactic center region form a sequence of increasing degree of nuclear processing ( the solar system was assumed to reflect the composition of the outer galaxy at a time almost five billion years ago ) led to the conclusion that 15  is predominantly arising from massive stellar progenitors ( , audouze  1977 ; gsten & ungerechts 1985 ) . in this case",
    "the more secondary 14  nucleus becomes more abundant relative to 15  with higher degree of nuclear processing , yielding  ratios of 270 , 300  400 , and 500  1000 in the solar system , the local ism , and the galactic center region , respectively .",
    "two complications led to the present ` nitrogen puzzle ' : firstly , the sun is more metal rich than the local ism ( , russell & dopita 1992 ; cameron 1993 ; cunha & lambert 1994 ; meyer 1997 ) , in spite of its age .",
    "secondly , dahmen  ( 1995 ) found a galactic disk gradient with  ratios ( from hcn ) increasing with galactocentric distance .",
    "the first complication is easily resolved within the framework of primary 15  production , if we note that the sun is particularly enriched with nuclei processed in massive stars .",
    "this leads to enhanced  ratios ( henkel & mauersberger 1993 ; henkel  1994b ) and to reduced  ratios relative to the local ism .",
    "the  gradient is a more severe problem .",
    "the gradient implies that either the initial mass function ( imf ) is biased in favor of high mass stars in the inner galactic disk ( there is no observational support for such a bias ) or that infall of halo gas or of cannibalized dwarf galaxies have altered interstellar abundances .",
    "most galactic  values are determined from  :  double isotope ratios .",
    "carbon fractionation may lead to small deviations between hcn/  and  abundance ratios ( see langer  1984 , 1989 ; wilson & matteucci 1992 ; wilson & rood 1994 ) , but this should not alter the sign of a gradient .",
    "assuming instead delayed injection of 15  via novae into the ism ( , dahmen  1995 ) fails to account for the large measured  ratios in the galactic center region with its high number of potential nova candidates ( see shafter 1997 ) .",
    "solving the nitrogen puzzle requires the determination of small ( @xmath1 100 )  ratios in a ( post- ) starburst environment , that is strongly influenced by the ejecta from massive stars ( henkel & mauersberger 1993 ; henkel  1994b ) .",
    "only a lower  limit of order 100 was obtained toward m82 ( henkel  1998 ) .",
    "our  ratio from ngc4945 strongly suggests that the bulk of 15  is ejected by massive stars .",
    "the ism of the lmc is less processed than the solar system and the local ism and should also be characterized by overabundances of nuclei ejected from massive stars .",
    "[ c / o]@xmath13 @xmath14 [ n / o]@xmath13 @xmath15 is consistent with this hypothesis ( , westerlund 1990 ) .",
    "thus , if 15  is released by massive stars , an ` overabundance ' of 15  relative to 14  is expected ; in the lmc ,  should be significantly smaller than ratios measured in the solar system and the local ism .    _ our observational results from the lmc and",
    "ngc4945 are thus providing strong support for 15  being predominantly ejected by type  ii supernovae_. this finding is not consistent with the sign of the galactic disk  gradient ( dahmen  1995 ) .",
    "it also seems to be in conflict with numerical calculations of massive star nucleosynthesis ( , weaver & woosley 1993 ; woosley & weaver 1995 ) . while without the contribution of neutrino - induced nucleosynthesis to the production of 15",
    ", massive stars would destroy rather than produce this isotope ( cf .",
    "weaver & woosley 1993 ) , woosley & weaver ( 1995 ) find the neutrino production with the ( uncertain ) currently predicted neutrino scattering cross sections not sufficient to explain the solar system abundance of 15  ( cf .  also timmes  1995 ) .",
    "however , recent massive star models which take the effects of rotation on the stellar structure and nucleosynthesis into account ( heger  1997 , 1999 , langer  1999 ) indicate the possibility of abundant hydrostatic production of 15  in case of mixing between the hydrogen - burning and the helium - burning shell , a mechanism already discussed by jorissen & arnould ( 1989 ) . consequently , although there are considerable uncertainties and weakly restricted parameters in the rotating massive star models which need to be explored in the near future , massive stars should be considered as an important source of 15  in galaxies , particularly so after the observational facts reported in the present paper .    we thank j.h .  black and u.  ott for useful discussions and criticism .",
