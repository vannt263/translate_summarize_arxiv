    "adaptive beamforming techniques are widely used in numerous applications such as radar , wireless communications , and sonar @xcite-@xcite , to detect or improve the reception of a desired signal while suppressing interference at the output of a sensor array . currently , the beamformers designed according to the constrained minimum variance ( cmv ) and the constrained constant modulus ( ccm ) criteria are among the most used criteria due to their simplicity and effectiveness .",
    "the cmv criterion aims to minimize the beamformer output power while maintaining the array response on the direction of the desired signal .",
    "the ccm criterion is a positive measure ( chapter 6 in @xcite ) of the deviation of the beamformer output from a constant modulus ( cm ) condition subject to a constraint on the array response of the desired signal .",
    "compared with the cmv , the ccm - based beamformers exhibit superior performance in many severe scenarios ( e.g. , steering vector mismatch ) since the positive measure provides more information for parameter estimation with constant modulus signals .    for the design of adaptive beamformers , numerous adaptive filtering algorithms",
    "have been developed using constrained optimization techniques @xcite",
    "the stochastic gradient ( sg ) and recursive least squares ( rls ) @xcite , @xcite are popular methods with different tradeoffs between performance and complexity .",
    "a major drawback is that they require a large number of samples to reach the steady - state when the array size is large . in dynamic scenarios , filters with many elements",
    "usually provide a poor performance in tracking signals embedded in interference and noise . the multistage wiener filter ( mswf )",
    "@xcite provides a way out of this dilemma .",
    "the mswf employs the minimum mean squared error ( mmse ) criterion and its extended versions with the cmv and the ccm criteria are reported in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "another cost - effective technique is the auxiliary vector filtering ( avf ) @xcite algorithm . in this scheme ,",
    "an auxiliary vector is calculated by maximizing the cross correlation between the outputs of the reference vector filter and the previously auxiliary vector filters .",
    "the weight vector is obtained by subtracting the scaling auxiliary vector from the reference vector . in @xcite ,",
    "the avf algorithm iteratively generates a sequence of filters that converge to the cmv filter with a small number of samples .",
    "its application in adaptive beamforming has been reported in @xcite .    motivated by the fact that the ccm - based beamformers outperform the cmv ones for the cm signals",
    ", we propose an avf algorithm based on the ccm design for robust adaptive beamforming .",
    "the beamformer structure decomposes the adaptive filter into a constrained ( reference vector filters ) and an unconstrained components ( auxiliary vector filters ) .",
    "the constrained component is initialized with the array response of the desired signal to start the iteration and to ensure the ccm constraint , and the auxiliary vector in the unconstrained component can be iterated to meet the cm criterion .",
    "the weight vector is computed by means of suppressing the scaling unconstrained component from the constrained part .",
    "the main difference from the existing avf technique is that , in the proposed ccm - based algorithm , the auxiliary vector and the scalar factor depend on each other and are jointly calculated according to the cm criterion ( subject to different constraints ) .",
    "the proposed method provides an iterative exchange of information between the auxiliary vector and the scalar factor and also exploits the information about the cm signals , which leads to an improved performance .",
    "simulations exhibit the robustness of the proposed method in typical scenarios including array mismatches .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : we outline a system model and the problem statement in section 2 .",
    "the proposed scheme is introduced and the ccm - avf algorithm is developed in section 3 .",
    "simulation results are provided and discussed in section 4 , and conclusions are drawn in section 5 .",
    "consider @xmath0 narrowband signals that impinge on a uniform linear array ( ula ) of @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) sensor elements .",
    "the sources are assumed to be in the far field with directions of arrival ( doas ) @xmath3,  ,@xmath4 .",

    "to avoid mathematical ambiguities , the steering vectors @xmath20 are normalized and considered to be linearly independents .",
    "the output of the beamformer is @xmath21 where @xmath22^{t}\\in\\mathbb c^{m\\times 1}$ ] is the complex weight vector of the beamformer , and @xmath23 stands for hermitian transpose .    with the signals introduced in ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] )",
    ", we can present the ccm beamformer design by minimizing the following cost function @xmath24^{2}\\big\\},~~ \\textrm{subject~to}~~{\\boldsymbol w}^{h}(i){\\boldsymbol a}(\\theta_{0})=1,\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the direction of the signal of interest ( soi ) and @xmath26 denotes the corresponding steering vector .",
    "the cost function is the expected deviation of the squared modulus of the array output to a constant , say @xmath27 .",
    "the constraint is set to maintain the power of the soi and to ensure the convexity of the cost function .",

    "note that ( [ 4 ] ) is a function of previous values of @xmath32 ( since @xmath33 ) and thus must be initialized to start the iteration .",
    "we keep the time index @xmath5 in @xmath34 and @xmath35 for the same reason .",
    "the calculation of the weight vector is costly due to the matrix inversion .",
    "the sg or rls type algorithms can be employed to reduce the computational load but suffer from a poor performance when the dimension @xmath1 is large .",
    "in this section , we introduce a ccm - based adaptive filtering structure for beamforming and develop an efficient ccm - avf algorithm for robust adaptive beamforming .",

    ", we start the iteration by initializing the weight vector @xmath38    then , we subtract a scaling auxiliary vector ( unconstrained component ) that is orthogonal to @xmath39 from @xmath40 ( constrained component ) and obtain @xmath41 where @xmath42 with @xmath43 , and @xmath44 is a scalar factor to control the weight of @xmath45 .",
    "the auxiliary vector is supposed to capture the signal components in @xmath46 that are not from the direction @xmath25 .",
    "the aim of ( [ 7 ] ) is to suppress the disturbance of the unconstrained component while maintaining the contribution of the soi .",
    "the cost function in ( [ 5 ] ) appears in unconstrained form since the constraint has been incorporated in the weight adaptation .      from ( [ 7 ] ) , it is necessary to determine the auxiliary vector @xmath45 and the scalar factor @xmath44 for the calculation of @xmath47 .",
    "assuming @xmath45 is known , @xmath44 can be obtained by minimizing @xmath48 ^ 2\\}$ ] . substituting ( [ 7 ] ) into this cost function ,",
    "computing the gradient with respect to @xmath44 and equating it to zero , we obtain @xmath49 where @xmath50\\in\\mathbb c^{m\\times m}$ ] and @xmath51\\in\\mathbb c^{m\\times 1}$ ] .",
    "note that @xmath52 , i.e. , @xmath53 needs to be avoided here since the design is equivalent to a matched filter if it happens .",
    "on the other hand , the calculation of the auxiliary vector @xmath45 should take the conditions @xmath54 and @xmath55 into account .",
    "the constrained minimization problem with respect to @xmath45 can be transformed by the method of lagrange multipliers into @xmath56 ^ 2\\big\\}\\\\ & -2~\\mathfrak{r}\\big\\{\\lambda_1\\big[\\boldsymbol g_1^h(i)\\boldsymbol g_1(i)-1\\big]-\\lambda_2\\boldsymbol g_1^h(i)\\boldsymbol a(\\theta_0)\\big\\ } , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are scalar lagrange multipliers .",
    "for the sake of mathematical accuracy , we note that the cost function to be minimized is phase invariant , namely , if @xmath59 satisfies it , so does @xmath60 for any phase @xmath61 . to avoid any ambiguity , we assume that only one auxiliary vector can be obtained",
    ".    following the procedure to get @xmath44 , the auxiliary vector can be expressed by @xmath62 where @xmath63\\in\\mathbb c^{m\\times 1}$ ] and @xmath64 .",
    "we keep the time index @xmath5 in @xmath65 since it is a function of @xmath32 , which must be initialized to provide an estimation about @xmath66 and to start the iteration .",
    "the expression of @xmath45 is utilized to enforce the constraints and solve for @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "indeed , we have @xmath67 @xmath68 where @xmath69 denotes the euclidean norm .",
    "substitution of @xmath57 and @xmath58 back in ( [ 10 ] ) leads to @xmath59 that satisfies the constraints and minimizes ( with @xmath44 ) the squared deviation of @xmath66 from the cm condition , yielding @xmath70    so far , we have detailed the first iteration of the proposed ccm - avf algorithm for time index @xmath5 , i.e. , @xmath40 in ( [ 6 ] ) , @xmath47 in ( [ 7 ] ) , @xmath44 in ( [ 8 ] ) , and @xmath45 in ( [ 13 ] ) , respectively . in this procedure",
    ", @xmath46 can be viewed as a new received vector that is processed by the adaptive filter @xmath47 ( first estimation of @xmath71 ) to generate the output @xmath66 , in which , @xmath47 is determined by minimizing the mean squared error between the output and the desired cm condition .",
    "this principle is suitable to the following iterations with @xmath72 .",
    "now , we consider the iterations one step further and express the adaptive filter as @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 will be calculated based on the previously identified @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "@xmath74 ( @xmath76 ) is chosen to minimize the cost function @xmath77 ^ 2\\}$ ] under the assumption that @xmath75 is known beforehand .",

    "generally , there exists a maximum ( or suitable ) value of @xmath85 , i.e. , @xmath86 , that is determined by a certain rule to stop iterations and achieve satisfactory performance .",
    "one simple rule , which is adopted in the proposed ccm - avf algorithm , is to terminate the iteration if @xmath87 is achieved .",
    "alternative and more complicated selection rules can be found in @xcite . until now",
    ", the weight solution at time index @xmath5 can be given by @xmath88 .",
    "the proposed ccm - avf algorithm for the design of the ccm beamformer is summarized in table [ tab : avf ] .",
    ".proposed ccm - avf algorithm [ cols= \" < \" , ]      there are several points we need to interpret in table [ tab : avf ] .",
    "first of all , initialization is important to the realization of the proposed method .",
    "@xmath32 is set to estimate @xmath66 and so @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 .",
    "@xmath40 is for the activation of the weight adaptation .",
    "note that the calculation of the scalar factor , e.g. , in ( [ 8 ] ) , is a function of @xmath45 and the auxiliary vector obtained from ( [ 13 ] ) depends on @xmath44 .",
    "it is necessary to initialize one of these quantities to start the iteration .",
    "we usually set a small positive scalar value @xmath92 for simplicity . under this condition",
    ", the subscript of the scalar factor for the calculation of @xmath93 should be replaced by @xmath94 instead of @xmath85 , as shown in table [ tab : avf ] .",
    "second , the expected quantities @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 are not available in practice .",
    "we use a sample - average approach to estimate them , i.e. , @xmath95 where @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath65 are substituted by their estimates in the iterative procedure to generate @xmath96 . to improve the estimation accuracy , the quantities in ( [ 17 ] ) can be refreshed or further regularized during the iterations .",
    "specifically , we use @xmath83 in the iteration step instead of @xmath32 in the initialization to generate @xmath97 , and related @xmath46 and @xmath66 , which are employed to update the estimates @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 . compared with @xmath101 , @xmath83 is more efficient to evaluate the desired signal .",
    "thus , the refreshment of the estimates based on the current @xmath96 is valuable to calculate the subsequent scalar factor and the auxiliary vector .",
    "third , we drop the normalization of the auxiliary vector @xcite-@xcite .",
    "note that the calculated auxiliary vectors @xmath102 are constrained to be orthogonal to @xmath39 .",
    "the orthogonality among the auxiliary vectors is not imposed .",
    "actually , the successive auxiliary vectors do satisfy the orthogonality as verifies in our numerical results .",
    "we omit the analysis about this characteristic here considering the paper length .",
    "the proposed ccm - avf beamformer efficiently measures the expected deviation of the beamformer output from the cm condition and provide useful information for the proposed algorithm for dealing with parameter estimation in many severe scenarios including low signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) or steering vector mismatch .",
    "the proposed ccm - avf algorithm employs an iterative procedure to adjust the weight vector for each time instant .",
    "the matrix inversion appeared in ( [ 4 ] ) is avoided and thus the computational cost is limited . since the scalar factor and the auxiliary vector depend on each other , the proposed algorithm provides an iterative exchange of information between them , which are jointly employed to update the weight vector .",
    "this scheme leads to an improved convergence and the steady - state performance that will be shown in the simulations .",

    "all output sinr values increase to the steady - state as the increase of the snapshots ( time index ) .",
    "the rls - type algorithms enjoy faster convergence and better steady - state performance than the sg - type methods .",
    "the proposed ccm - avf algorithm converges rapidly and reaches the steady - state with superior performance .",
    "the ccm - based mswf technique with the rls implementation has comparative fast convergence rate but the steady - state performance is not better than the proposed method . in fig .",

    "the most adequate iteration number for the proposed ccm - avf algorithm is @xmath109 , which is comparatively lower than other analyzed algorithms , but reach the preferable performance .",
    "we also checked that this value is rather insensitive to the number of users in the system , to the number of sensor elements , and work efficiently for the studied scenarios .",
    "we developed an avf algorithm based on the ccm design for robust adaptive beamforming .",
    "the algorithm provides a positive measure of the expected deviation of the beamformer output from the cm condition and thus is robust against the severe scenarios .",
    "the weight solution is iterated by jointly calculating the auxiliary vector and the scalar factor , which iteratively exchange information between each other and lead to an improved performance over prior art .",
    "the selection of the iteration number may be more efficient and adaptive with the change of the system ( e.g. , the number of users change ) if we employ other techniques @xcite .",
