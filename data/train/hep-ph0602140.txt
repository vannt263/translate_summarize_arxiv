    "some puzzles have been found in @xmath1 meson decaying processes , such as ( a ) the large branching ratios ( brs ) of @xmath12 @xcite , ( b ) the small longitudinal polarizations of @xmath2 decays @xcite and ( c ) the unmatched cp asymmetries ( cpas ) and brs in @xmath6 decays @xcite .",
    "the interesting thing is that the mazy problems are all related to the flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) @xmath13 decays .",
    "the resultants push us not only to consider more precise qcd effects but also to speculate the existence of new physics .",
    "it is known that the fcnc processes usually arise from the loop corrections in the standard model ( sm ) like models .",
    "the preference of loop corrections originates from the strict constraints of @xmath14 meson oscillation .",
    "however , the constraints of @xmath14 system are only on the first two generations , the fcnc at tree level in third generation has no significant limit yet . in especial ,",
    "the direct constraint from @xmath15 mixing , dictated by @xmath13 interactions , is a lower bound in experiment @xcite .",
    "hence , it will be interesting to investigate the models which fcnc occurs at tree level and they could provide the solutions to the puzzles in @xmath13 decays .",
    "one of simple extensions of sm for the effects of fcnc is the unconventional @xmath0 model , in which fcnc is arisen from the family nonuniversal couplings @xcite , i.e. the couplings of @xmath0 to different families are not the same .",
    "one of possible ways to get the family nonuniversal couplings is to include an additional @xmath16 gauge symmetry ; and then by the requirement of anomaly free , the gauge charges for different families are different @xcite .",
    "other models giving the family nonuniversal @xmath0 interactions could be referred to ref .",
    "the detailed phenomenological analyses for various low energy physics could be found in ref .",
    "especially , the implications on time - dependent cpa of @xmath17 and on the brs of @xmath18 have been studied by ref .",
    "moreover , the solution to the @xmath6 puzzle by the nonuniversal @xmath0 couplings is also discussed by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite . to further pursue the effects on @xmath1 decaying processes , in this paper",
    ", we will take all the measurements of @xmath19 and @xmath6 into account to constrain the free parameters . by the constrained parameters , we investigate the implications of the @xmath0 model on brs , cpas and polarization fractions ( pfs ) for the decays @xmath20 , @xmath6 and @xmath21",
    ".    for two - body color - allowed processes of @xmath1 decays , it is known that the dominant hadronic effects are the factorized parts which could be simply expressed as the multiplication of effective wilson coefficients ( wcs ) , the decay constant , and the transition form factors , _ e.g. _ @xmath22 . furthermore , by the observed cpa of o(10% ) in @xmath23 , we know that the large strong phases have to be introduced .",
    "in order to self - consistently calculate the hadronic effects , we employ the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) approach @xcite to evaluate the hadronic matrix elements , where the large strong phases could be generated by the annihilation effects of the effective operator @xmath24 .",
    "it is known that in @xmath1 system which is composed of a heavy quark and a light quark , the residual momentum of the light quark is typically @xmath25 with @xmath26 being the mass of the b - meson ( b - quark ) . in @xmath1",
    "decays , if we regard that the processes are dominated by short - distant interactions , for catching up the energetic quark from the b - quark decay to form a energetic meson with the typical energy being @xmath27 , the light quark inside the @xmath1 meson has to obtain a large momentum from the b - quark via the gluon exchange .",
    "hence , the momentum transfer carried by the hard gluon could be estimated to be @xmath28 , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 denote the momenta of spectator quarks inside the @xmath1 meson and produced meson , respectively . in terms of light - cone coordinates ,",
    "the large components of @xmath31 could be defined by @xmath32 with @xmath33 being the momentum fractions .",
    "hence , the squared momentum of the exchanged hard gluon is @xmath34 . as known that the residual momentum of light quark in the @xmath1 meson is @xmath35 , @xmath36 is roughly @xmath37 .",
    "since the produced light meson is energetic , the momenta of valence quarks should be @xmath38 , i.e. @xmath39 . by taking @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 gev , we get @xmath43 gev .",
    "since the value reflects the typical reacting scale of @xmath1 decays in the framework of the pqcd , for the sm contributions , in our calculations the values of weak wcs are estimated at the scale @xmath44 gev .    the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",

    "<S> we study the impacts of nonuniversal @xmath0 model , providing flavor changing neutral current at tree level , on the branching ratios ( brs ) , cp asymmetries ( cpas ) and polarization fractions of @xmath1 decays . </S>",
    "<S> we find that for satisfying the current data , the new left- and right - handed couplings have to be included at the same time . </S>",
    "<S> the new introduced effective interactions not only could effectively explain the puzzle of small longitudinal polarization in @xmath2 decays , but also provide a solution to the small cpa of @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the favorable cpa of @xmath3 is opposite in sign to the standard model ; meanwhile , the cpa of @xmath4 has to be smaller than @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , by using the values of parameters which are constrained by @xmath6 , we find that the favorable ranges of brs , cpas , longitudinal polarizations , and perpendicular transverse polarizations for @xmath7 are @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively . </S>"
