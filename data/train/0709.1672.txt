    "dark matter still remains one of the main unsolved problem in physics .",
    "the common accepted paradigm is the existence of an exotic weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) .",
    "such a particle has to be found in some extension of the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics .",
    "supersymmetry and extra space - time dimensions are commonly used ingredients for a consistent theory beyond the sm .",
    "one the most studied framework is the mssm , the minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm . in the mssm",
    "the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) is usually a neutralino , which is a good candidate for cold dark matter ( for a recent review see  @xcite ) .",
    "the pattern of the soft supersymmetry breaking terms and the presence of extra space - time dimensions greatly affects the composition and the strength of the dominant interactions of the neutralino .",
    "hence it is crucial to study the neutralino phenomenology in different scenarios .",
    "the glast experiment will have a great chance to shed light on the nature of dark matter , for example through the analysis of the continuum @xmath0-ray flux supposed to come from pair wimp annihilations .",
    "one of the most studied supersymmetric scenario is the constrained mssm ( cmssm ) in which the soft supersymmetry breaking terms are supposed to derive from a high energy supergravity theory with a common scalar mass @xmath1 and a common gaugino mass @xmath2 at the gut scale . in this framework",
    "the neutralino is the lsp in most of the parameter space .",
    "it can be studied through indirect detection of @xmath0-rays from pair annihilation .",
    "the expected @xmath0-ray continuum flux at a given photon energy @xmath3 from a direction that form an angle @xmath4 is given by @xmath5 it depends on the particle physics model assumed through the neutralino mass @xmath6 , the total annihilation cross section @xmath7 and through the sum of all the photon yield @xmath8 per each annihilation channel weighted by the corresponding branching ratio @xmath9 .",
    "the flux  ( [ gammafluxcont ] ) also depends on the wimp density in the galactic halo @xmath10 .",
    "the integral has to be performed along the line of sight ( l.o.s . ) .",
    "the wimp density profiles @xmath10 are in general extremely cuspy towards the galactic center ( gc ) that hence is a good place where to look for an exotic signal . in our analysis we take into account the navarro , frenck and white ( nfw ) profile  @xcite and the moore profile  @xcite .",
    "the usual parametrization for a dark matter halo density is @xmath11^{(\\beta-\\gamma)/\\alpha } } \\;\\;. \\label{profile}\\ ] ] the nfw profile behaves like @xmath12 towards the gc while the moore profile goes as @xmath13 . in general",
    "one expects also contributions coming from standard astrophysical sources . in many diffuse continuum @xmath0-ray production models  @xcite in our galaxy ,",
    "the dominant astrophysical contribution comes from @xmath14 .",
    "this has to be considered the `` standard '' background .",
    "we performed a statistical analysis , based on the usual @xmath15 test , in order to determine what are the models that can be disentangled against the background by glast at a given significance  @xcite .",
    "we have taken into account only the statistical errors , i.e. @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the number of background photons in each energy bin .",
    "doing a detailed scan of the cmssm parameter space defined by @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 one can find the regions that are detectable by glast .",
    "besides the previously explained parameters @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath18 denotes the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two neutral components of the su(2 ) higgs doublet , @xmath19 is the proportionality factor between the supersymmetry breaking trilinear couplings and the yukawa couplings while @xmath21 is determined ( up to a sign ) by imposing the electro - weak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) conditions at the weak scale .    the result , at a @xmath22 confidence level , for @xmath23 case is shown in fig .",
    "[ tanbe55cmssm ] .",
    "we assumed a total exposure of @xmath24 , an angular resolution ( at @xmath25 gev ) of @xmath26 sr and 4 years of data taking  @xcite .    ]",
    "blue solid lines represent the glast reach for a nwf and moore profile while dashed lines represent the neutralino isomass contours ( expressed in gev ) .",
    "gray shaded regions are parameter space regions excluded by either theoretical or experimental ( accelerator ) constraints .",
    "the upper left region is excluded because the lightest stau is the lsp , the lower left region is excluded due the accelerator bounds on the higgs boson masses , @xmath27 , slepton and squark masses , etc . , while the right lower region is excluded because there is no electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the wmap compatible region ( with relic density @xmath28 ) is the red one while in the green region the neutralino is a subdominant dark matter component ( with @xmath29 ) .",
    "in recent times many scenarios involving extra space - time dimensions with or even without supersymmetry received great attention .",
    "it is very interesting to see if glast is able to detect signals in this context .",
    "we consider a very wide scenario involving extra dimensions and low energy supersymmetry  @xcite .    in this framework",
    "there are three additional parameters , namely the typical size of extra dimensions @xmath30 , their number @xmath31 and the number @xmath32 of fermion generations that are allowed to have extra kaluza - klein ( kk ) states .",
    "the most striking feature in this class of models is the presence of power - law corrections to all the couplings and masses of the mssm  @xcite .",
    "this implies that one can have a grand unification scale ( gut ) scale as low as few tev . from the point of view of indirect detection",
    "the case @xmath33 in which some fermion generation have kk tower is disfavored .",
    "thus in the following we concentrate on the minimal case @xmath34 . moreover the number of extra dimensions @xmath31 does not seem to be crucial for the neutralino phenomenology  @xcite . in almost all the parameter space",
    "the neutralino is still the lsp .",
    "one of the main result is that , unlike the standard cmssm case , the neutralino is no longer bino - like but it tends to be a very pure higgsino . in general",
    "this result holds for not too high compactification scale @xmath35 tev while going towards higher scale the neutralino tends to be a bino .",
    "we show the @xmath22 glast reach ( along the line sketched in the previous section ) for @xmath36 tev , @xmath37 and @xmath34 and for a low value of @xmath18 .",
    "tev , @xmath37 and @xmath34 [ glast reach extradim 104 ] ]    the plot assumptions and the explanation of the different regions are the same as in fig .",
    "[ tanbe55cmssm ] . in this scenario",
    "a nfw profile is not enough for glast to be able to explore the cosmologically favored region in which the neutralino has a mass greater than @xmath38 gev . in order to do that a moore profile is needed .",
    "this corresponds to an enhancement factor of about one order of magnitude in the continuum flux .",
    "it has to be remarked that assuming some non standard cosmological evolution the green region could become a wmap compatible region .",
    "this is due to a non thermal enhancement of the relic density ( see for example  @xcite ) .",
    "these kind of scenarios are particularly motivated in scenarios with extra dimensions . in fig .",
    "[ glast reach extradim 108 ] we show the case with @xmath39 tev and with only one extra dimensions @xmath40 .",
    "all the kk particles are quite heavy in this case but the effects on the low energy theory , through one loop processes , are still sizable .",
    "tev , @xmath40 and @xmath34 [ glast reach extradim 108 ] ]    in this scenario the glast reach for a nfw profile is still below the wmap allowed region but for a moore profile glast will be able to probe almost all the cosmologically favored region .",
    "we have shown that , assuming a nfw profile , glast will be able to probe a huge part of the wmap allowed zone of the cmssm parameter space especially in the high @xmath18 case . in the scenario involving extra dimensions , with quite low compactification scale @xmath41 tev , glast will still be able to probe some part of the cosmologically favored region of the parameter space either in the case of more cuspy moore profile or in the case of an enhancement of the neutralino relic density in a non standard cosmological scenario . in the case of higher compactification scale @xmath42 tev glast will be able to cover almost all the wmap region .",
