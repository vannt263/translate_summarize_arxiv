    "one of the most basic characteristics of macromolecules with linear `` chemical architecture '' is chain flexibility ( or lack thereof , stiffness ) @xcite .",
    "while many synthetic polymers are fully flexible , and the statistical properties of their conformations under good solvent conditions have been extensively investigated @xcite , recently also semiflexible polymers have found much interest , in particular since important biopolymers such as dna , some proteins , rodlike viruses , or actin filaments belong to this class @xcite . moreover , also synthetic polymers such as polyethylene exhibit some stiffness over short distances along the chain .",
    "particular interest in the problem of chain stiffness has arisen due to the discovery that in macromolecules with `` bottle - brush architecture '' @xcite their stiffness can be varied over a wide range by changing the length and grafting density of side chains . since short bottle - brush polymers in solution",

    "@xcite ) . also in a biological context semiflexible macromolecules with bottle - brush architecture are found @xcite , and have interesting functions such as lubrication in mammalian joints @xcite .    while for fully flexible polymers under good solvent conditions excluded volume interactions ( loosely speaking , monomers of a polymer chain can not `` sit '' on top of each other ) are of central importance @xcite , the standard model to describe semiflexible chains ignores them completely @xcite . this `` standard model '' is the `` wormlike chain model '' of kratky and porod @xcite , described by a hamiltonian ( in the continuum limit )    @xmath3    where the curve @xmath4 describes the linear polymer of contour length @xmath5 , and the parameter @xmath6 describing the bending stiffness is related to the `` persistence '' length @xmath7 as @xmath8 . for chain molecules in the absence of excluded volume , where distances between monomers that are far apart satisfy gaussian statistics , one can show that the orientational correlation function between bond vectors decays exponentially with @xmath9    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is bond length between two subsequent monomers along the chain , @xmath12 .",
