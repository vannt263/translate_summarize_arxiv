    "recent astronomical observations have provided strong evidence that our universe is undergoing an accelerated expansion due to an exotic energy component with negative pressure which is called dark energy perlmutter-99,bennett-03,tegmark-04,allen-04 . by far a leading candidate of dark energy model",
    "is the einstein s cosmological constant model ( @xmath0cdm ) which is consistent with the late - time observational data .",
    "however , it is confronted with the so - called  cosmological constant problem \" and  coincidence problem \" @xcite . therefore , many dynamical dark energy models @xcite , such as quintessence @xcite , phantom @xcite , quintom @xcite , tachyon @xcite , generalized chaplygin gas @xcite , etc , have also been taken into account .",
    "the cosmological constant problem may be essentially an issue of quantum gravity problem , since the cosmological constant is commonly considered as the vacuum expectation value of some quantum fields . although a complete theory of quantum gravity has not been established , according to some principles of quantum gravity , one can make some attempts to probe the nature of dark energy model .",
    "the holographic dark energy model is just an appropriate and interesting example .",
    "this model is based on the holographic principle of quantum gravity theory @xcite , and is derived from the relationship between the ultraviolet ( uv ) and the infrared ( ir ) cutoffs proposed by cohen _",
    "@xcite . according to the limit set of the formation of a black hole",
    ", the uv - ir relationship gives an upper bound on the zero point energy density @xmath1 , which means that the maximum entropy of the system is of the order of @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the scale of ir cutoff and @xmath4 is the entropy of the black hole .",
    "compared with the holographic dark energy model and based on the k@xmath5rolyh@xmath5zy relation @xcite , the so - called agegraphic dark energy model was proposed , where the age of the universe @xmath6 is used as the ir cutoff @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in ref.@xcite , the interacting agegraphic dark energy has been introduced and investigated .",
    "it was shown that the equation of state of interacting agegraphic dark energy can cross the phantom division .",
    "the interacting agegraphic dark energy model also has been extended to the universe with spatial curvature in ref .",
    "recently , using the phase space analysis , it was shown that the accelerated scaling attractor solutions of the interacting agegraphic dark energy in the einstein universe did exist and the results agree with the observations @xcite .    on the other side , scalar - tensor theories of gravity",
    "have been widely applied to cosmology @xcite .",
    "the simplest alternative to einstein s general relativity which includes a scalar field in addition to the tensor field is brans - dicke theory .",
    "this theory is more consistent with the mach s principle and less reliant on absolute properties of space brans - dicke-65 .",
    "it got a new impetus in recent years because it arises naturally as the low energy limit of many theories of quantum gravity such as super string theory or kaluza - klein theory . noticing that the holographic dark energy density belongs to a dynamical cosmology constant , it is more natural for a dynamical frame to replace the einstein s general gravity .",
    "therefore , it is worthwhile to investigate the holographic dark energy model within the framework of brans - dicke theory y.g.gong-04,y.g.gong-08,ahmad sheykhi-09,j.liu-10 . the extended holographic dark energy model with hubble horizon in brans - dicke theory has been proposed and it is found that the model is not a viable dark energy model unless the brans - dicke scalar field has a potential .",
    "so it is a very interesting attempt to deeply investigate the agegraphic dark energy model in the framework of brans - dicke theory .    considering that dark energy ( de ) and dark matter ( dm ) contribute to the most fraction of the content of the universe , it is natural to look into the possibility of the interaction between de and dm , which has been widely discussed @xcite .",
    "it has been argued that the coupling between de and dm can provide a mechanism to alleviate the coincidence problem and lead to an accelerated scaling attractor solution with similar energy densities in the dark sector today @xcite .",
    "noticing that there is no fundamental theory which can be used to select a specific interacting dark energy model , any interacting dark energy model will necessarily be phenomenological .",
    "there are two criterions to determine whether the model is correct and feasible .",
    "one is the observations , the other is to examine whether the interacting model can lead to the accelerated scaling attractor solutions , which is a decisive way to achieve similar energy densities in dark sector and alleviate the coincidence problem . in this work ,",
    "we firstly introduce a new series of interacting agegraphic dark energy models including linear and nonlinear forms . using the phase - plane analysis",
    ", it is found that the accelerated scaling attractor solutions do exist in these models .",
    "what s more , these agegraphic dark energy models are in accordance with the late - time observational data .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ] ,",
    "the agegraphic dark energy models in brans - dicke theory is constructed and a series of dark sector coupling forms are introduced . in section [ sec3 ] , using the phase - plane analysis , the accelerated scaling attractor solutions are discussed in these models . in section [ sec4 ] , using the newly released hubble parameter data hubble .. expand .. jimenez , hubble .. expand ..",
    "simon , hubble .. expand .. stern , hubble ..",
    "macong , these agegraphic dark energy models are tested .",
    "some conclusions will be presented in section [ sec5 ] .",
    "according to our metric convention , @xmath7 , the lagrangian for brans - dicke theory with a scalar field in the jordan frame is @xmath8 , \\label{1.0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the dimensionless @xmath9 is the coupling constant , and @xmath10 is the matter lagrangian .",
