    "recent experimental and theoretical investigations of transition metal oxides have revealed the interplay between spin , charge and orbital degrees of freedom , leading to dramatic changes of magnetic and transport properties.@xcite the best known examples of this joint effect of several degrees of freedom are high - temperature superconductivity and colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) .",
    "when orbital degrees of freedom contribute , as in the cmr manganites , they may strongly influence magnetic properties and also may play a key role for the charge transport .",
    "@xcite particularly in the manganites the strong coupling between orbital states and local lattice distortions plays a prominent role , and orbital order is stabilized to a large extent by the jahn - teller interactions.@xcite under these circumstances quantum orbital fluctuations are suppressed and classical orbital order determines the spin structure and dynamics.@xcite this is most clearly displayed by the large difference between the temperatures of the orbital and magnetic phase transitions in lamno@xmath2 , being @xmath8 k and @xmath9",
    "k.@xcite    a challenge for the theory of spin - orbital systems and a qualitatively different situation is encountered in the @xmath10vo@xmath2 perovskites , where @xmath10=lu , yb,@xmath11,la . in these perovskites ,",
    "i.e. , controlled by @xmath12 valence electrons , the orbital - lattice coupling is weak while the spin - orbital coupling is the dominant interaction and thus orbital fluctuations are not suppressed .",
    "a common feature is the onset of the @xmath5-type alternating orbital ( @xmath5-ao ) order below the characteristic orbital ordering temperature @xmath13 which is in these compounds relatively low , @xmath14 k , and comes close to the nel temperature @xmath15 k for the magnetic transition to the antiferromagnetic ( af ) phase with af order in @xmath16 planes accompanied by ferromagnetic ( fm ) order along the @xmath7 axis , the @xmath6-af phase.@xcite unlike @xmath17 orbitals in the cmr manganites , in this class of compounds the @xmath12 orbitals may form orbital ordered states which are subject to strong orbital quantum fluctuations .",
    "the consequences of quantum spin - orbital interplay in the @xmath10vo@xmath2 perovskites were discussed in the theory , @xcite and have been observed in several experiments.@xcite the changes of spin and orbital correlations are responsible for the temperature dependence of the optical spectral weights,@xcite as well as for the dimerization of fm interactions in the @xmath6-af phase observed in the neutron scattering in yvo@xmath2,@xcite and also in lavo@xmath2.@xcite related instability of fm chains toward dimerization occurs at finite temperature when spin and orbital degrees of freedom couple.@xcite orbital fluctuations and their competion with orbital - lattice coupling play also a crucial role for the explanation of the nonmonotonous dependence of the orbital transition temperature on the radius @xmath18 of @xmath10 ions along the @xmath10vo@xmath2 series.@xcite    the phase diagram of the perovskite - type @xmath10vo@xmath2 compounds@xcite shows several spin- and/or orbital ordered phases . in the regime of compounds with low values of ionic radii @xmath18 of rare earth ions",
    "@xmath10 , another af phase with complementary @xmath5-type af ( @xmath5-af ) order@xcite accompanied by @xmath6-type alternating orbital ( @xmath6-ao ) order ( with staggered orbitals in @xmath16 planes and repeated orbitals along the @xmath7 axis ) appears below the second magnetic transition at @xmath19,@xcite for example in yvo@xmath2 @xmath20 k. @xcite in addition , recent raman experiments@xcite suggest that the short - range orbital fluctuations of the @xmath5-type occur in this intermediate @xmath6-af phase  they coexist with the @xmath6-ao order and make it thus quite different from the one observed in lavo@xmath2 .",
    "the magnetic exchange constants which determine the magnons in the @xmath6-af phase are about a factor two smaller than those found in the low - temperature @xmath5-af phase.@xcite therefore , it has been argued that this phase transition in yvo@xmath2 follows from large entropy of spin and orbital excitations in the @xmath6-af phase,@xcite but the observed reduction of the energy scales of magnetic excitations remained puzzling and could not be explained by theory so far .",
    "@xcite    in recent years the effect of doping in several cubic vanadium oxides systems such as la@xmath0sr@xmath1vo@xmath2 , pr@xmath0ca@xmath1vo@xmath2 , nd@xmath0sr@xmath1vo@xmath2 , and y@xmath0ca@xmath1vo@xmath2 has been systematically explored by various experimental techniques .",
    "@xcite resistivity data , specific heat and magnetic measurements have been used to set up the phase diagram as function of doping.@xcite in contrast to the high-@xmath21 cuprates , where the metal - insulator ( mi ) transition is found at a few percent doping,@xcite in the vanadates the mi transition occurs at much higher doping concentrations:@xcite 18% sr in la@xmath0sr@xmath1vo@xmath2 and even up to 50 % ca in y@xmath0ca@xmath1vo@xmath2 .",
    "the evolution of optical spectra with doping for these two systems shows that the defects lead to impurity states which appear as absorption band deep inside the mott gap.@xcite this suggests that bound small polarons are the cause of the mi transition at such high doping concentrations.@xcite it is eventually the growth of the mid - infrared absorption with increasing doping and the gradual shift of this absorption toward zero energy which accompanies the insulator - metal transition .",
    "when taking all these experimental features into account one arrives at a clear physical picture:@xcite ( i ) most importantly , the trends of the optical conductivity show that the edge of the mott - hubbard gap is essentially unaffected by doping , and only fades away when the mi transition is approached ; ( ii ) defects play a central role , not just by introducing holes , but as generators of deep impurity states which appear in the optical conductivity as midgap absorption at low doping ; and finally ( iii ) the defects introduce two distinct energy scales . on one hand",
    "one finds the defect binding energy of about 1 ev , i.e. , in the dilute doping regime , and on the other hand there is clearly an activation energy of @xmath22 ev or less in transport experiments.@xcite our aim here is to show how generic ca defects doped into the mott - insulator yvo@xmath2 explain these phenomena in a natural way .",
    "we begin our investigation with a discussion of the properties of ca defects inserted into an orbital degenerate mott - hubbard insulator .",
    "we adopt a multiband hubbard model description of the @xmath12 electrons,@xcite and we use the unrestricted hartree - fock ( hf ) method.@xcite this approach is chosen as it allows us to introduce in a straightforward manner the lower hubbard band ( lhb ) of the @xmath12 orbital states as well as the upper hubbard bands ( uhbs ) with the appropriate multiplet splitting .",
    "the most pronounced effect of the defect is the coulomb potential of the ca - impurity which gives rise to an upward shift of the vanadium @xmath12 states in the neighborhood of the defect .",
    "this leads to deep impurity states in the mott - hubbard gap .",
    "interestingly , on one hand a ca defect introduces one hole , but on the other hand it generates defect states on eight equivalent vanadium neighbors .",
    "@xcite thus the topmost defect states that are split off the lhb are partially filled and pin the chemical potential .",
    "transport inside the narrow defect band at weak doping will be affected by the coulomb disorder@xcite of the charged defects .",
    "consequently one expects anderson localization as was actually already conjectured by mott@xcite for the la@xmath0sr@xmath1vo@xmath2 system .",
    "subsequently we proceed to our central aim , namely the investigation of the effect of defects on the spin - orbital dynamics in the dilute limit .",
    "hence important aspects concerning defects , namely : ( i ) consequences of disorder , ( ii ) the role played by the long - range coulomb interaction , and most importantly ( iii ) the interaction effects at higher doping , will not be discussed here , but will be addressed elsewhere .",
    "one of the striking differences between the @xmath5-af and @xmath6-af phase is the stability of the latter phase in doped la@xmath0sr@xmath1vo@xmath2 and y@xmath0ca@xmath1vo@xmath2 compounds .",
    "for example , in la@xmath0sr@xmath1vo@xmath2 the @xmath6-af order survives even beyond the insulator - to - metal transition at doping @xmath23,@xcite and disappears only at @xmath24 .",
    "@xcite the @xmath5-af of yvo@xmath2 , however , is fragile and is destabilized in the y@xmath0ca@xmath1vo@xmath2 compounds already at @xmath25 , where the @xmath6-af phase takes over .",
    "@xcite we shall argue below that in order to understand this behavior it is crucial to treat explicitly the dynamics of orbital degrees of freedom .",
    "the cubic symmetry is broken at v@xmath26 ions due to the orthorhombic lattice distortion which occurs below the structural transition and favors energetically the electron occupancy of @xmath27 orbital.@xcite this symmetry breaking was also confirmed by the electronic structure calculations performed for lavo@xmath2 and yvo@xmath2.@xcite due to hund s exchange both electrons in a @xmath28 configuration at v ion form a high - spin @xmath29 state , so the second @xmath12 electron occupies either @xmath30 or @xmath31 orbital , resulting in a @xmath32 local configuration at each v@xmath26 site .",
    "the orbital state is quite different in both magnetic phases of yvo@xmath2 , below and above @xmath19 .",
    "lattice distortions are large in the low - temperature @xmath5-af phase and suggest @xmath6-ao order .",
    "this orbital order is further stabilized by increasing pressure.@xcite above @xmath19 the distortions decrease and are compatible with a weak @xmath5-type ao ( @xmath5-ao ) order.@xcite it was suggested by ishihara @xcite that the phase transition at @xmath19 could originate from the orbital physics and would be triggered by orbiton softening induced by the reduction of the spin order parameter . while the orbital degrees of freedom certainly play a role as the orbital order indeed changes at @xmath33 , there is no evidence of orbiton softening so far .",
    "it could be expected that the observed transition is caused instead by local phenomena close to ca impurities in y@xmath0ca@xmath1vo@xmath2 rather than by the global change of orbital excitation scale .",
    "we suggest that it is plausible that impurities could locally destabilize the @xmath6-ao order , and introduce a microscopic model to treat this effect below .",
    "an earlier theoretical analysis within the charge - transfer model has shown that both phases are indeed energetically close,@xcite and one may thus expect that small changes of the thermodynamic potential around @xmath33 could trigger a first order magnetic phase transition .",

    "optical spectroscopy has shown that the absorption in the mott - hubbard gap grows as a function of ca doping in y@xmath0ca@xmath1vo@xmath2.@xcite in the low doping range @xmath40 it has a characteristic energy close to 1.2 ev,@xcite and moves to lower energies at higher doping .",
    "the intensity of the mid - infrared peak increases proportionally to doping @xmath41 .",

    "the major part of our study is based on an effective low - energy hamiltonian which can be denoted as a _ spin - orbital _ @xmath44-@xmath45 _ model _ ; the model provides a description of magnetism and hole motion in the lower hubbard band of a doped and orbital degenerate mott - hubbard insulator . in the undoped case the model coincides with the spin - orbital superexchange model @xcite which was shown earlier to lead to a satisfactory description of spin - orbital physics , e.g. , in yvo@xmath2 .",
