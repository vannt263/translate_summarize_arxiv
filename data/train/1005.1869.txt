    "due to the proton - neutron monopole interaction , the energies of the single particle states are changing along an isotopic or isotonic chain by varying the number of neutrons or protons , respectively . as a consequence ,",
    "shell gaps may disappear , or new shell closures may develop .",
    "one of the new subshell closures is at @xmath1=14  @xcite the strength of which was determined to be 4.2 mev in @xmath3o  @xcite .",
    "recently , disappearence of this @xmath1=14 gap in carbon isotopes has been reported via the spectroscopy of @xmath4c  @xcite .",
    "this observation has been confirmed also by the measurement of the mass deformation in @xmath4c  @xcite in inelastic scattering on a liquid hydrogen target . as a byproduct of this study , we investigated the interaction of the @xmath0n beam with the hydrogen and a lead target , as well .",
    "this allowed us to study the transiton along the @xmath1=14 line and to give spectroscopic information on the structure of the lighter neutron rich nitrogen isotopes .",
    "the experiment was performed at riken nishina center using a @xmath5ar primary beam of 63  mev / nucleon energy and 700  pna intensity .",
    "the radioactive species were produced through fragmentation reaction on a @xmath6ta target of 0.2  mm thickness , and their momentum and mass were analyzed by the riken isotope separator ( rips )  @xcite .",
    "an aluminium wedge degrader of 221  mg/@xmath7 thickness was placed at the momentum dispersive focal plane ( f1 ) in order to purify the secondary beam .",
    "rips momentum acceptance was set to the maximum value of 6% in order to achieve the highest intensities since a sharply defined energy was not crucial for our purposes .",
    "the resultant beam included several nuclei , mainly @xmath8b , @xmath9c , @xmath4c , @xmath0n and @xmath3n with a total intensity of about 100  particle / s ( pps ) , to which the contribution of @xmath0n was around 30  pps .",
    "the identification of these constituents was carried out event - by - event using energy loss ( @xmath10e ) , time - of - flight ( tof ) and magnetic rigidity ( @xmath11 ) information  @xcite .",
    "a complete separation of the istopes was achieved by the @xmath10e - tof-@xmath11 method .",
    "two plastic scintillators of 0.3  mm thickness placed at the second and third focal planes ( f2 and f3 ) determined the tof , while the @xmath10e value was measured by a si detector of 0.1  mm thickness at f2 .",
    "ppacs at f2 and f3 monitored the cocktail beam which was transported to the secondary targets of @xmath12pb and liquid hydrogen with 1445  mg/@xmath7 and 190  mg/@xmath7 thickness , respectively .",
    "the mean energy of the @xmath0n ions in the middle of the hydrogen and lead target was 52.0  mev / nucleon and 48.1  mev / nucleon .",
    "the scattered particles were detected and identified on the basis of @xmath10e , tof and total energy ( e ) information .",
    "80  cm downstream of the target a plastic scintillator of 1  mm was put to measure the @xmath10e and to provide the start signal for the tof measurement .",
    "the end of the tof signal was determined by an array of plastic detectors located 4.3  m downstream of the target , which also measured the total energy of the isotopes .",
    "this array consisted of 16 bars of 60  mm thickness with a total area of 1@xmath131  m@xmath14 , and its angular acceptance of 6.5@xmath15 in the laboratory frame granted almost 100% coverage of the cross section .",
    "160 nai(tl ) crystals of the dali2 array  @xcite surrounding the targets detected the @xmath16 rays emitted by the inelastically scattered nuclei .",
    "since knock - out reaction channels were strong for the hydrogen target ( for pb target this effect was negligible ) , the separation of the outgoing isotopes was necessary .",
    "the identification of the atomic number ( z ) was perfect using the @xmath10e and tof information , while the mass number ( a ) was determined on the basis of tof and total energy ( fig .",
    "[ fig : aid ] ) .",
    "the segregation in a for the segments of the plastic scintillator array was different therefore only those detectors were used for the identification of @xmath16 rays where the adjacent mass numbers were completely resolved .",
    "however , for the deduction of cross section of @xmath0n inelastic scattering reaction , the other detectors were also employed because the @xmath0n and @xmath9n nuclei , which emitted @xmath16 rays with similar energy , were distinct .",
    "the doppler - corrected spectra using the hydrogen target were produced with multiplicity ( m ) 1 and 2 of the dali2 array for all the isotopes .",
    "spectra for @xmath17n served as a cross - check of the procedure , since the low - energy excited states for this nucleus are well - known  @xcite . using this information a geant4  @xcite simulation of the m=1 and m=2 spectra",
    "was performed and the resulting response curves plus additional smooth background polynomials fitted the experimental data points well . for the heavier isotopes ,",
    "the spectra were fitted first by gaussian functions and polynomial backgrounds in order to determine the position of the peaks .",
    "these were then compared to the @xmath16 lines and level scheme found in ref .",
    "the resulting peaks were fed into geant4 simulation again and the response curves were fitted to the experimental spectra and the relative intensities were deduced .",
    "two peaks were found for @xmath9n in the neutron knock - out reaction at 529(21 )  kev and 1137(26 )  kev ( fig .",
    "[ fig:19n ] ) .",
    "this is in a good agreement with ref .",
    "@xcite where these transition form a cascade .",
    "the lower energy @xmath16 ray connects the second excited state with the first one while the higher energy @xmath16 ray is emitted during the transition from the first excited state to the ground state .",
    "the @xmath4n neutron knock - out spectra are more complicated and could be best fitted by four peaks at 500(21 )  kev , 832(17 )  kev , 920(30 )  kev and 1052(24 )  kev .",
    "this conclusion is mainly based on the m=2 spectrum since the m=1 one contains basically the 832  kev peak .",
    "this observation is consistent with the level scheme deduced in ref .",
    "@xcite which consists of two cascades with similar energies .    for @xmath0n ( fig .",
    "[ fig:21n ] ) , the transition between the first excited and ground state ( e@xmath18=1140(30 )  kev ) dominates the proton inelastic scattering spectra with m=1 while the m=2 spectra also contains events originating from the transition between the second and first excited state ( e@xmath18=1210(33 )  kev ) .",
    "this agrees well with the conclusion drawn in ref .",
    "@xcite on the level scheme where the two strongest peaks were found at 1177  kev and 1228  kev .",
    "+     +      besides the level scheme , the inelastic scattering cross sections were also deduced for @xmath0n both with hydrogen and lead targets .",
    "the net counts in the nearby peaks for the spectra with liquid hydrogen were derived by fixing the known peak positions and the peak widths determined above .",
    "the relative intensities deduced from the spectrum containing all the multipolarities are : 100(10 ) for the 1140  kev and 60(6 ) for the 1210  kev line .",
    "the gamma feeding of the first excited state was taken into account while deriving the excitation cross sections .",
    "since only the first excited state was populated in the pb case and no @xmath16 ray was detected in the m=2 spectrum , no correction was taken into account there .",
    "the three excitation cross sections determined are @xmath19(1140,h)=6.6(8 )  mb , @xmath19(2350,h)=12.3(16 )  mb and @xmath19(1140,pb)=11.4(34 )  mb .",
    "as in several earlier cases , e.g. ,  @xcite , the cross sections were interpreted in terms of the collective model using the fresco code  @xcite .",
    "the optical potential for the hydrogen target was calculated by a parametrized formula from a global phenomenological evaluation  @xcite , while the optical potential determined experimentally in @xmath8o+@xmath12pb reaction  @xcite was applied for the lead target .",
    "the spins of the states involved were taken from shell model calculations  @xcite as follows : the ground state has a spin 1/2 , the first excited state at 1140  kev has spin 3/2 while the second excited state at 2350  kev has spin 5/2 .",
    "the determination of the proton and neutron deformation lengths ( @xmath20,@xmath21 ) was performed in a similar way described in details in ref .",
    "@xcite therefore we recall here some details .",
    "the exception was that here the proton inelastic cross section of the second excited state was also available and was used in the @xmath22 analysis .",
    "as a first step , a pair of neutron and proton deformation lengths has been chosen .",
    "these are in the following correspondence with the matter and coulomb deformation lengths for the two probes ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25=@xmath26=@xmath20 ) : @xmath27 @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the neutron and proton sensitivity parameters . @xmath33 , @xmath34 are the input parameters in the coupled channel code .",
    "the difference between the calculated and experimental cross sections has been quantified in a @xmath22 value so we ended up with a set of data ( @xmath21,@xmath20,@xmath22 ) .",
    "this procedure was repeated with varied initial ( @xmath21,@xmath20 ) parameters and the results are visualized in a contour plot of @xmath22 values ( fig .",
    "[ fig : chi ] ) . from this figure ,",
    "the neutron and proton deformation lengths can easily be determined at @xmath21=0.95(5 )  fm , @xmath20(=@xmath25=@xmath26)=0.95(15 )  fm which implies @xmath23=@xmath24=0.95(5 )  fm .",
    "the corresponding reduced electric quadrupole transition probability ( @xmath35 ) and the multipole proton and neutron transition matrix elements ( @xmath36 ) could directly be calculated with the following formulae : @xmath37 @xmath38 at m@xmath39=110 ( 12 )  @xmath40 , m@xmath41=28 ( 9 )  @xmath40 , and the ratio @xmath42=2.0 ( 3 ) .",
    "this ratio is equal to @xmath43 , which shows the pure isoscalar character of the transition .",
    "these results are similar to those of the @xmath3o nucleus having 14 neutrons just one proton closer to stability  @xcite where also small transition matrix elements together with @xmath44 were extracted .    according to the weak coupling approximation  @xcite",
    ", the sum of the e2 strengths from the ground state to the 3/2@xmath45 and 5/2@xmath45 states in the @xmath0n isotope gives the b(e2;@xmath46 ) strength in its appropriate core .",
    "we have measured the b(e2 ) value to the first excited state and the mass transition rate to both the first and the second excited states .",
    "since these states are expected to have mainly @xmath47 nature , it is a good approximation to assume that for both states the ratio of the mass and electric transition rates is the same . using this assumption , the effective b(e2 ) value of the ground state transiton in the core of @xmath0n",
    "can be estimated as 56(18 )  e@xmath14@xmath40 .",
    "the shell model calculations give 54  e@xmath14@xmath40 summed strength for @xmath0n  @xcite , which is about twice of the @xmath3o value and lies at about half way between the neighbouring oxygen and carbon b(e2;@xmath46 ) values .",
    "the shell model calculation gives 110  e@xmath14@xmath40 for @xmath4c , which is much larger than the experimental value ( @xmath4818  e@xmath14@xmath40 ) due to the decoupling of the neutrons from the core in heavy carbon nuclei  @xcite .",
    "this fact shows that the core structure of the nitrogen isotopes is softer than that of the singly - closed shell oxygen isotopes and is consistent with the 1.2  mev reduction of the @xmath1=14 shell closure when going from @xmath3o to @xmath0n as a result of the removal of a proton from the @xmath49 orbit  @xcite .",
