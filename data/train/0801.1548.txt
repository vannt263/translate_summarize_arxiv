    "tight correlations between supermassive black hole ( smbh ) masses and large scale properties of the host bulges are interesting for two obvious reasons . they enable us to predict smbh masses in thousands of galaxies where the black hole s sphere - of - influence is highly unresolved , and they provide clues to the physical processes responsible for the co - evolution of black hole and host bulge .",
    "recent endeavors have advocated relations involving not one but two bulge parameters and therein claims of `` fundamental planes '' , akin to the fundamental plane for elliptical galaxies ( djorgovski & davis 1987 ; dressler et al .",
    "the existence of such smbh fundamental planes imply that current theories for the @xmath4-@xmath1 relation ( ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ) or the @xmath4-@xmath6 relation ( mclure & dunlop 2002 ; marconi & hunt 2003 ; updated in graham 2007 ) , which do not include a third parameter , are incomplete .",
    "this article investigates the fundamental planes for smbhs involving the parameters @xmath0 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 ( barway & kembhavi 2007 ) , @xmath0 , @xmath9 , and @xmath1 ( marconi & hunt 2003 ; de francesco et al .",

    "it is explained why a previous claim for a small ` total ' scatter ( 0.19 dex ) about the @xmath0-@xmath9-@xmath11 plane was the result of a miscalculation . in section  3",
    "it is revealed that the galaxies which deviate from the @xmath0-@xmath1 relation , giving rise to the @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath9 , @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath6 , and @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath7 relations with less scatter than the @xmath0-@xmath1 relation , are predominantly barred galaxies .",
    "a `` barless @xmath0-@xmath1 '' relation , and an elliptical - only @xmath12-@xmath1 relation , is subsequently constructed in section  4 and found to heavily nullify the evidence for fundamental planes for smbhs and their host bulges .",
    "given the recent discussion in the literature about biases in the @xmath0-@xmath1 and/or @xmath0-@xmath6 relation , and also in the local sample of galaxies with direct smbh mass measurements , these concerns are explored here . in sections  5",
    "a @xmath1-@xmath6 relation is constructed and shown to be equal to that obtained using sdss early - type galaxy data , thereby laying to rest concerns that the local sample of galaxies with direct smbh mass measurements may be biased with respect to the greater population ( e.g.  yu & tremaine 2002 ; bernardi et al .",
    "2007 ) . furthermore , in section  6",
    ", the @xmath13-band @xmath0-@xmath6 relation and the barless @xmath0-@xmath1 relation are shown to yield consistent results with neither giving smbh masses greater than @xmath14 .",
    "barway & kembhavi ( 2007 , hereafter bk07 ) made the interesting claim that a combination of two photometric parameters , namely the effective radius @xmath16 and the mean effective surface brightness @xmath17 , can be used to predict smbh masses with a greater degree of accuracy than single quantities such as luminosity or velocity dispersion .",
    "a tight relation exists between black hole mass , @xmath0 , and the luminosity , @xmath6 , of the host bulge .",
    "the luminosity can of course be expressed in terms of two other parameters because @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is average intensity within the effective half light radius , @xmath9 , of the bulge .",
    "one question of interest is whether the scatter about the @xmath0-@xmath20 relation can be reduced by allowing the exponents on @xmath21 and @xmath9 to deviate from their 1:2 ratio and , importantly , if this results in less scatter than the other competing relations .",
    "given the small scatter about the fundamental plane  involving @xmath9 , @xmath22 , and @xmath1  and the tight relationship between @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( merritt & ferrarese 2001 ; tremaine et al .",
    "2002 ) , one may indeed expect a well defined plane using the parameters @xmath9 , @xmath11 , and @xmath0 .",

    "scatter in the @xmath23 direction , when using @xmath11 and @xmath24 as predictor quantities of @xmath0 , is 0.25 dex ( and 0.19 dex when excluding the outlier ngc  4742 ) .",

    "the data for @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath11 have been taken from table  1 in bk07 . due to the absence of reported errors on the quantities @xmath24 and @xmath35 in bk07 ,",
    "measurement errors are not included in the regression , and subsequently no attempt to quantify the intrinsic scatter has been made .",
    "parameter uncertainties are derived here using a bootstrap sampling of the data points ( i.e.  sampling with replacement from the original sample ) to produce 1000 monte carlo samples from which 1000 optimal fits are derived .",

    ". the low value of 0.19 dex reported by bk07 appears to have arisen by dividing their scatter in the @xmath24 direction ( 0.061 ) by the coefficient in front of the @xmath23 term in their eq.3 ( which is their fitted plane ) .",

    "it may however be that some other physical property such as nuclear disks or kinematically decoupled cores are influencing the measured velocity dispersions .",

    "an alignment of the ( radial orbits in the ) bar with our line - of - sight may result in such a scenario . indeed , the barred galaxy ngc  3384 is highly inclined and has the bar closely aligned with the projected minor axis ( busarello et al .",

    "one thing which is clear is that the biasing presence of disc ( especially barred ) galaxies appear responsible for much of the alleged evidence for requiring a fundamental plane for smbhs .",
    "one should not use either the `` barless @xmath0-@xmath1 '' relation nor the standard @xmath0-@xmath1 relation for barred galaxies because the resultant smbh mass estimates may be in error ( too high ) by 0.5 to 1.0 dex .",
    "one should also not apply an @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath9 fundamental plane in the hope of accounting for barred galaxies because such a plane will introduce a bias to the non - barred galaxies .",

    "given the offset nature of some of the barred galaxies in the @xmath0-@xmath1 diagram  in the sense that they have overly large velocity dispersions for their smbh masses  it is apposite to explore if the barred galaxies may be responsible for the allegedly biased nature of these local inactive galaxy samples .",

    "the @xmath107-band @xmath0-@xmath6 relation used by lauer et al .  was much steeper than this , having a slope of @xmath112 ( i.e.  @xmath113 ) , and subsequently predicted notably more massive smbh masses .",

    "bcg magnitudes do tend to produce smbh mass estimates that are roughly twice as large as those predicted from their velocity dispersions . from liu",

    "this halo of stars is very likely , at least in part , due to stars that have been tidally stripped from galaxies within the cluster environment ( e.g.merritt et al .  1985 ) . as such , it pertains more to the cluster than the bcg , and should be excluded from measurements of the bcg luminosity .    to avoid the issue of the outer envelope",

    "the danger is that some of the outermost portion of the light profile which was modeled may have been elevated to a brighter level by the flux of the envelope .",
    "as the light profiles did not extend to large radii , the ` break ' in the profile , where the envelope starts to dominate , may have been missed .",
    "if so , such contamination would result in the best - fitting @xmath50 model having an increased effective radius and a brighter total flux .",
    "therefore , before concluding a problem exists with the bcgs , it would be prudent to actually perform a galaxy / envelope decomposition ( e.g.  gonzalez et al .",

    "it is perhaps worth noting that a few galaxies are known to possess both a smbh and a nuclear star cluster , leading one to wonder whether a ) the combined masses should be used and b ) do the ` offset ' barred galaxies have significant nuclear star clusters ?",
    "as noted in gd07 , the barred galaxy ngc  3384 has @xmath124 .",

    "nonetheless , a careful quantitative analysis of the nuclear structure of galaxies with smbhs would be highly desirable ; it would additionally enable one to explore the @xmath0  central surface brightness relation proposed by gd07",
