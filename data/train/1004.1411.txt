    "a significant fraction of massive galaxies at @xmath8 are early - type galaxies containing quiescent stellar populations ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these galaxies must have formed very early in the universe s history and can therefore provide important constraints on galaxy formation and evolution models .",
    "many of these quiescent galaxies have been found to be extremely compact , with effective radii a factor @xmath9 smaller than their low - z counterparts ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this is quite puzzling , since these compact galaxies are passively evolving and are therefore not expected to change strongly in size or mass if they do not merge .",
    "we note that @xcite find some large massive quiescent galaxies at @xmath10 , showing that not all massive quiescent galaxies at high redshift are compact .    within the context of current - day models ,",
    "galaxy mergers play an important role in galaxy evolution ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these mergers may cause compact @xmath11 galaxies to grow `` inside - out '' , i.e. , the mergers would increase the size of the galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) . whether the resulting size growth is large enough , however , is uncertain ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "several authors have emphasised that there are several systematic uncertainties that affect both radius and mass determinations .",
    "first , effective radii may be underestimated due to complex morphologies .",
    "specifically , an extended low surface brightness component could remain undetected due to low signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) , thereby lowering the observed size ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite , but see @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "second , mass - to - light gradients may result in a luminosity - weighted effective radius that is smaller than the mass - weighted effective radius ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "such gradients arise in certain models for the formation of massive ellipticals ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "finally , the inferred stellar masses may be affected by incorrect assumptions regarding the initial mass function ( imf ) and stellar evolution models ( e.g. , @xcite , and references therein ) .    in this letter",
    "we use new very deep near - infrared ( nir ) imaging data from the hubble space telescope s wide field camera 3 ( hst / wfc3 ) to investigate the possibility of size underestimation due to the lack of s / n .",
    "we examine the possibility of a `` hidden '' faint extended component being present in @xmath8 compact quiescent galaxies , focusing on the most massive quiescent galaxy in the hubble ultra deep field ( hudf ) ( beckwith et al 2006 ) , which has previously been studied by @xcite .",
    "we adopt the following values for cosmological parameters : @xmath12 km s@xmath13 mpc@xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",
    "all stellar masses are derived assuming a kroupa imf @xcite .",
    "all effective radii are circularized , unless noted otherwise .",
    "our study utilises new wfc3/ir",
    "@xmath1-band imaging data taken within the hudf . these data are part of the first of the three ultra - deep pointings which will be completed over the next year as part of the hudf09 hst treasury program ( go11563 ) .",
    "the current wfc3 imaging consists of 78600 seconds of exposure time in the @xmath1 band , leading to a limiting magnitude of 28.8 .",
    "the post - spread function ( psf ) fwhm is @xmath16 arcsec .",
    "details of the data reduction can be found in @xcite .",
    "since the wfc3 data does not cover the complete hudf , most of the compact massive @xmath8 galaxies from e.g. @xcite and @xcite fall outside of the observed area . from the compact @xmath8 galaxies inside the wfc3 hudf image area",
    "we select the most massive one , located at @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "this galaxy has a spectroscopic redshift @xmath0 @xcite , stellar mass @xmath19 ( @xcite ; frster schreiber in preparation ) , and effective radius @xmath20 kpc in the observed @xmath21 band ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it was identified by @xcite as passively evolving based on the @xmath22 criterion .",
    "a summary of the galaxy s structural parameters is given in table  [ tab : prop ] .",
    "an image of the galaxy is shown in figure  [ fig : galim ] .",
    "it is sufficiently separated from its neighbors to prevent contamination of its surface brightness profile .",
    "l c c l c c this letter & @xmath23 & @xmath24 & @xmath25 & & @xmath26 + previous work & @xmath27 & @xmath28 & @xmath29 & @xmath30 & @xmath31 +    we use the galfit package @xcite to fit two - dimensional @xcite model profiles convolved with the psf to the observed surface brightness distribution .",
    "this is an essential step in deriving the structure of the galaxy , as the fwhm of the psf of the wfc3 images is significant compared to the size of the galaxy .",
    "we use a psf extracted from a nearby unsaturated star and base our masking image on a sextractor ( @xcite ) segmentation map .",
    "we fit nine different models with a fixed srsic index ( @xmath32 ) , as well as a model where @xmath33 is a free parameter .",
    "the effective radii from the srsic fits range between 0.42 and 0.48 for srsic indices varying between @xmath34 and @xmath35 , with the free-@xmath33 fit producing a value of 0.43 kpc ( at @xmath4 ) .",
    "the best - fit srsic profiles are shown in figure  [ fig : profile ] . despite the fact that the effective radii are rather similar ,",
    "it is clear that the derived profiles vary significantly with @xmath33 .",
    "there is no intrinsic reason why galaxies should have `` perfect '' srsic profiles .",
    "although locally the surface brightness profiles of elliptical galaxies are well fitted by single srsic profiles over a large range of radii ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the situation may be different at high redshift .",
    "in particular , if elliptical galaxies grow by an inside - out process ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , the surface brightness profiles of their progenitors may deviate from srsic profiles .",
    "we therefore developed a method to derive more robust intensity profiles , which depend less on the srsic @xmath33 parameter used for the fit .",
    "our approach is the following : for each srsic fit , we calculate the residual image , which is an image of the observed flux minus the psf - convolved model .",
    "we derive a profile of the residual flux measured along circles centered on the galaxy .",
    "we add this residual profile to the deconvolved model srsic profile .",
    "we note that the intrinsic profile is deconvolved for psf , but the residuals are not .",
    "this procedure is similar to how the clean deconvolution method employed in radioastronomy handles residuals @xcite .",
    "we thus remove or add flux at those radii where the model does not adequately describe the data , making a first order correction for errors caused by the incorrect profile choice . for large radii , where ( systematic ) uncertainties in the sky determination become significant , we extrapolate the residual - corrected profile by using the uncorrected srsic profile , scaled to the residual - corrected profile at the transition radius .",
    "these `` residual - corrected '' profiles are then integrated in order to determine the true half - light radius , which we refer to as @xmath36 .",
    "the residual - corrected profiles are shown in figure  [ fig : profile ] .",
    "the structural parameters of the best - fitting profile are given in table  [ tab : prop ] .",
    "it is clear from figure  [ fig : profile ] that the residual - corrected profiles are much less sensitive to the srsic-@xmath33 value adopted for the initial modeling , especially at radii beyond a few kpc .",
    "furthermore , deviations from the srsic profile are taken into account ; as we show in section 4 , using the residual - corrected profile we can trace the true surface brightness profile much more accurately than using simple analytical srsic fits .",
    "this is due to the fact that the s / n of the faint emission at large radii is so low that the fitting procedure ignores it , even though a lot of flux can originate there .",
    "thus the stability of the parameters derived from srsic fits is no guarantee for correctness .",
    "this is particularly relevant when the galaxies have complex morphologies , such as in the case of a bright , compact galaxy surrounded by a faint , extended envelope .",
    "uncertainties in @xmath37 and the total @xmath38-band magnitude are estimated from the range in values obtained from the fixed-@xmath33 residual - corrected profiles .",
    "the errors given in table  [ tab : prop ] are the rms errors of the best - fit parameters from all of the fits , and give an indication of the systematic errors due to differences between the observed surface brightness profile and the srsic models used in the fitting procedure .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath33 is estimated using simulations : we add random sky noise to the observed galaxy image .",
    "this is repeated several times , resulting in a number of images , on each of which we perform the fitting procedure described above .",
    "the uncertainty given in table  [ tab : prop ] is two times the rms error of the best - fit parameter from all of the fits .",
    "our results are the following : the galaxy is best fit by a srsic profile with @xmath4 .",
    "using the residual - corrected profile we find that the effective radius of the galaxy is @xmath39 arcsec , which corresponds to @xmath40 kpc .",
    "if we fix the srsic index to a constant value , the inferred size does not vary substantially : @xmath41 varies from 0.31 kpc for @xmath35 to 0.51 kpc for @xmath34 .",
    "thus , the deviations from the best - fitting profile are @xmath42 .",
    "our size estimate is therefore reasonably robust to deviations from the model profile .",
    "we have investigated the influence of psf uncertainties ; if we use psfs extracted from other stars in the field we find variations in @xmath37 of @xmath43 .",
    "we have used the tiny tim software package to investigate the spatial dependence of the psf independently .",
    "we find that the derived effective radius changes very little with the position of the reference star used , with a maximum of 10% in opposite corners of the field .",
    "the difference in effective radius due to the distance between the reference star and the galaxy is less than 1% .",
    "we therefore conclude that psf errors do not present a significant problem in our analysis .",
    "we now determine whether faint extended emission would be detected using our data . to this end",
    "we construct several simulated galaxy images which consist of two components ; a compact component , described by a @xmath44 srsic profile with an effective radius roughly equal to the observed galaxy ( see table  [ tab : prop ] ) , and an extended component , described by a srsic profile with either @xmath44 , @xmath45 kpc or @xmath34 , @xmath46 kpc .",
    "the extended component has a flux that is either 10% or 50% of the compact component s flux . the compact component s flux is chosen such that the total flux of the two components is equal to the observed galaxy s total flux .",
    "the images are convolved with the psf , and sky and readout noise are added .",
    "the images are then fit with a single srsic profile using galfit , and a residual - corrected profile is constructed . by comparing the half - light radii obtained in this way to the intrinsic half - light radii we can quantify the sensitivity of our data to low surface brightness components .",
    "the results of our simulated galaxy fits are shown in figure  [ fig : sim ] .",
    "the residual - corrected profiles closely follow the intrinsic profiles .",
    "the effective radii derived from the residual - corrected profiles are very close to the intrinsic effective radii : in three of the cases the difference is less than @xmath47 . for the @xmath34 extended component with a total flux equal to half of the compact component s flux",
    "the inferred radius is 10% smaller than the intrinsic radius , comparable to the systematic error due to modeling uncertainties ( see section  [ sec : psf ] ) .",
    "we also tested @xmath44 and @xmath34 models with effective radii of several kpc for the @xmath34 extended component : these models are so well approximated by srsic models with higher values of @xmath33 ( @xmath48 ) that normal srsic profile fitting immediately retrieves the correct effective radii .    in conclusion ,",
    "our method used on these deep data is sensitive to a faint extended component down to a surface brightness of @xmath49 mag arcsec@xmath3 , and using our method we retrieve effective radii that are within @xmath50 of the true value .",
    "we note that the effective radii obtained using the conventional method are , in most cases , very close to the intrinsic effective radii",
    ". however , the surface brightness profiles obtained in this way clearly deviate from the intrinsic profiles .",
    "we have found that the galaxy under consideration is indeed remarkably small . we have fitted a srsic model to the observed flux distribution , and corrected the profile for the observed deviations .",
    "we have measured the galaxy s half light radius : @xmath51 kpc .",
    "this result is robust to changes in the imposed srsic profile . as a check of our data s sensitivity to a low surface brightness component",
    "we have constructed simulated galaxy images which include a faint extended component .",
    "we can reproduce the effective radii to 10% using our technique .",
    "a possible cause for concern is that the galaxy might deviate strongly from a srsic profile .",
    "we have incorporated the residuals in our fit to compensate for such errors , and we note that the residuals from our best srsic model fit are quite low ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "this implies that our model profile is close to the real profile .",
    "this , and the fact that varying @xmath33 has little influence on the derived half - light radius , suggests that our results are not strongly affected by this source of error .    thus , our findings indicate that the small effective radius that has been found is not due to oversimplified modeling or a lack of s / n , and gives additional evidence that a strong evolution in size occurs from @xmath8 to @xmath53 .",
    "it should be noted that our derived effective radius is @xmath54 times smaller than the radii derived by @xcite in the @xmath55 and @xmath21 bands . when we repeat our analysis on the acs @xmath21-band data we obtain a slightly different value , @xmath56 kpc ( uncircularized ) , closer to the deep @xmath38-band imaging , and somewhat smaller than the value derived by @xcite ( but consistent within the errors ) .",
    "hence all bands indicate a very small size .",
    "figure  [ fig : rel ] illustrates the difference in size and mass between our galaxy and the @xmath53 elliptical population ; plotted in the first two panels are the compact galaxy we have studied and a sample of low - redshift central galaxies from groups and clusters in the sloan digital sky survey , analyzed by @xcite .",
    "the compact @xmath8 galaxy lies far off from the @xmath53 mass - size relation .",
    "the middle panel shows the galaxy on the mass - luminosity relation .",
    "we estimated the luminosity evolution of the compact galaxy from @xmath0 to @xmath53 in two ways : we first used the rest - frame @xmath57 color difference between low and high redshift to estimate the difference in mass - to - light ratio .",
    "second we used the fundamental plane to estimate the evolution from @xmath53 to @xmath58 from @xcite , and used the average evolution of the mass - to - light ratios of early - types in the cdfs at @xmath58 and the @xmath0 galaxy , both from frster schreiber et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .",
    "the resulting evolution is 1.8 - 2.2 magnitudes . as a result",
    ", the galaxy still lies off from the size - magnitude relation after correcting for evolution .    in the third panel of figure",
    "[ fig : rel ] we compare the surface brightness profile of this galaxy to those of elliptical galaxies in the virgo cluster .",
    "the profile shown has been corrected for cosmological surface brightness dimming and passive luminosity evolution from @xmath0 to @xmath53 .",
    "the total correction is @xmath59 magnitudes .",
    "even though the galaxy has an average density @xmath60 times larger than the average @xmath53 elliptical of the same mass , its surface brightness profile in the central kpc is actually rather similar to those of the most massive galaxies at @xmath53 - the average density measured at fixed physical radius is not that different .",
    "this is consistent with results obtained by other authors ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the main difference between @xmath53 and this @xmath8 galaxy is at larger radii where the @xmath8 galaxy has much lower surface brightness .",
    "such a result could be explained by inside - out growth .",
    "we also note that there may be significant errors in the mass determination of @xmath8 compact galaxies , due to e.g.  incorrect assumptions about the imf .",
    "changes in the low mass end of the imf affect both the masses of the high redshift and low redshift galaxies , and are nearly irrelevant .",
    "however , changes in the slope of the imf will affect the derived passive evolution between @xmath61 and @xmath53 , and will increase or decrease the size evolution .",
    "changes in the imf could thus have important consequences for evolution .",
    "future deep nir spectroscopic data should provide direct information on the kinematics of these objects and will allow us to confirm their high masses ( see e.g. , @xcite )",
    ".    finally , it will be interesting to obtain similar deep data on other compact massive galaxies , so that their profiles can be analyzed to the same surface brightness limit .",
    "we note that stacking can also lead to a great increase in imaging depth ; e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite stack samples of compact galaxies and obtain very good constraints on their average surface brightness profile . however , with the new wfc3 data available in the coming years many more compact massive galaxies can be studied on an individual basis .",
