    "comparative studies of cities adopt classifications , such as cultural or geographical criteria , and then apply analytical tools to characterize the existing groups in morphological terms @xcite",
    ". however , in recent space syntax investigations devoted to the comparative classification of urban textures , the predefined categories have been avoided and groups have been interpreted as a result of the analysis @xcite .",
    "methods for automatic classification or grouping , broadly termed _",
    "hierarchical clustering _ have been discussed in @xcite .",
    "the general idea behind the hierarchical clustering is that elements of any set have similarities and differences that can be mapped as distances in a multi - dimensional space in which each characteristic ( variable ) represents an axis .",
    "then , clusters are created by grouping isolated elements or subgroups or , alternatively , splitting the set into smaller groups , according to the distance between them .    in the present paper ,",
    "we propose the new automatic classification method based on the structural statistics of so called justified graphs used in urban space syntax theory @xcite .",
    "most real world networks can be considered complex by virtue of features that do not occur in simple networks .",
    "the encoding of cities into non - planar dual graphs ( sec .",
    "[ sec : graphrepresentations ] ) reveals their complex structure , @xcite .",
    "if cities were perfect grids in which all lines have the same length and number of junctions , they would be described by regular graphs exhibiting a high level of similarity no matter which part of urban texture is examined . this would create a highly accessible system that provides multiple routes between any pair of locations .",
    "it was believed that pure grid systems are easy to navigate due to this high accessibility and to the existence of multiple paths between any pair of locations @xcite .",
    "although , the urban grid minimizes descriptions as long as possible in the ideal grid all routes are equally probable ; morphology of the perfect grid does not differentiate main spaces and movement tend to be dispersed everywhere @xcite .",
    "alternatively , if cities were purely hierarchical systems ( like trees ) , they would clearly have a main space ( a hub , a single route between many pairs of locations ) that connects all branches and controls movement between them .",
    "this would create a highly segregated , sprawl like system that would cause a tough social consequence , @xcite .",
    "however , real cities are neither trees nor perfect grids , but a combination of these structures that emerge from the social and constructive processes @xcite .",
    "they maintain enough differentiation to establish a clear hierarchy @xcite resulting from a process of negotiation between the public processes ( like trade and exchanges ) and the residential process preserving their traditional structure .",
    "the emergent urban network is usually of a very complex structure which is therefore naturally subjected to the _ complex network theory _ analysis .    in order to illustrate the applications of complex network theory methods to the structural investigations of dual graphs representing urban environments ,",
    "we have studied five different compact urban patterns .",
    "two of them are situated on islands : manhattan ( with an almost regular grid - like city plan ) and the network of venice canals ( imprinting the joined effect of natural , political , and economical factors acting on the network during many centuries ) . in the old city center of venice that stretches across 122 small islands in the marshy venetian lagoon along the adriatic sea in northeast italy ,",
    "the canals serve the function of roads , and every form of transport is on water or on foot .",
    "we have also considered two organic cities founded shortly after the crusades and developed within the medieval fortresses : rothenburg ob der tauber , the medieval bavarian city preserving its original structure from the 13@xmath0 century , and the downtown of bielefeld ( altstadt bielefeld ) , an economic and cultural center of eastern westphalia .    to supplement the study of urban canal networks ,",
    "we have investigated that one in the city of amsterdam .",
    "although it is not actually isolated from the national canal network , it is binding to the delta of the amstel river , forming a dense canal web exhibiting a high degree of radial symmetry .",
    "* table 1 : some features of studied dual city graphs *    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in tab .  2 ,",
    "we have presented the structural distances between the dual graphs of five compact urban patterns calculated in accordance to ( [ scalar_distance ] ) .",
    "it is important to note that the structural distances given in the tab .",
    "2 have been calculated independently for each pair of urban textures with reference to their sizes and distributions of far away neighbors .",
    "it is obvious that they do not belong to the same space and therefore can not be immediately compared .",
    "the _ degree distribution _ has become an important concept in complex network theory describing the topology of complex networks .",
    "it originates from the study of random graphs by erds and rnyi , @xcite .",
    "the importance of the implemented street identification principle is worth mentioning for the investigations on the degree statistics of dual city graphs .",
    "the comparative investigations of different street patterns performed in @xcite implementing the icn principle reveal scale - free degree distributions for the vertices of dual graphs .",
    "however , in @xcite it has been reported that under the street - name approach the dual graphs exhibit small - world character , but scale - free degree statistics can hardly be recognized .",
    "the results on the probability degree statistics for the dual graphs of compact urban patterns analyzed in accordance with the above described street identification principle are compatible with that reported in @xcite . in general , compact city patterns do not provide us with sufficient data to conclude on the universality of degree statistics .",
    "the probability degree distributions for the dual graph representations of the five compact urban patterns mentioned in tab .  1 has been studied by us in @xcite . to give an example , we display in fig .",
    "[ fig1_09 ] the log - log plot is sketched of the number of streets @xmath1 in manhattan versus the number of their junctions @xmath2 , where @xmath3.\\ ] ] these numbers are displayed by points .",
    "the solid line is associated to cumulative degree distribution , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the probability that the degree is _",
    "greater than or equal _ to @xmath2 .",
    "the presentation of degree data by the cumulative degree distribution has an advantage over the degree distribution ( [ degdistr01 ] ) , since it reduces the noise in the distribution tail , @xcite .",
    "it is remarkable that the observed profiles are broad indicating that a street in a compact city can cross the different number of other streets , in contrast while in a regular grid . at the same time",
    ", the distributions usually have a clearly noticeable maximum corresponding to the most probable number of junctions an average street has in the city .",
    "the long right tail of the distribution which could decay even faster then a power law is due to just a few `` broadways , '' embankments , and belt roads crossing many more streets than an average street in the city , @xcite . it has been suggested in @xcite that irregular shapes and faster decays in the tails of degree statistics indicate that the connectivity distributions is _ scale - dependent_. as a possible reason for the non - universal behavior is that in the mapping and descriptive procedures , inadequate choices to determine the boundary of the maps or flaws in the aggregation process can damage the representation of very long lines .",
    "being scale - sensitive in general , the degree statistics of dual city graphs can nevertheless be approximately universal within a particular range of scales .",
    "the scale - dependence of degree distributions indicate that the degree statistics alone does not give us the enough information to reach a qualified conclusion on the structure of urban spatial networks .",
    "thus , the statistics of far - away neighbors would be targeted to reduce the gap providing us with a new method for automatic structural classification of cities .",
