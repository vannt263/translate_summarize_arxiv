    "recently capelas de oliveira , mainardi and vaz @xcite have investigated the complete monotonicity of the function of the mittag - leffler type @xmath0 where @xmath1 denotes the prabhakar function @xcite with three positive order - parameters @xmath2 . for more details on this function",
    "see e.g. @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the prabhakar function ( [ eq : ml3_seriesexpansion ] ) is a special case of the more general fox ",
    "wright function @xmath3 which was first investigated by wright in 1935 @xcite .    for some particular values of the parameters",
    "this function and its laplace transform ( lt ) @xmath4 with @xmath5 , provide the response function and the complex susceptibility ( @xmath6 ) respectively , found in the most common models for non  debye ( or anomalous ) relaxation in dielectrics .",
    "in fact , the classical dielectric models , referred to as cole ",
    "cole @xcite , davidson",
    " cole @xcite and havriliak ",
    "negami @xcite , are derived according to the scheme @xmath7    moreover , the application of fractional operators based on the prabhakar function have been recently investigated @xcite for describing the unsaturated behavior of the free electron laser and the derivation of a renewal point process generalizing the classical homogeneous and the time  fractional poisson processes .",
    "in @xcite the authors have proved that the function @xmath8 is locally integrable and completely monotone ( licm ) defined for @xmath9 is said to be completely monotonic ( cm ) if it possesses derivatives @xmath10 for all @xmath11 and if @xmath12 for all @xmath13 .",
    "the limit @xmath14 finite or infinite exists .",
    "it is known from the bernstein theorem that a necessary and sufficient condition that @xmath15 be cm is that @xmath16 where @xmath17 is non - decreasing and the integral converges for @xmath18 . in other words @xmath15",
    "is required to be the real lt of a non negative measure , in particular @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a standard or generalized function known as spectral distribution . for more mathematical details ,",
    "e.g. _ the survey by miller and samko @xcite . ] under the conditions @xmath21    as discussed by several authors ( e.g. , see @xcite ) the cm is an essential property for the physical acceptability and realizability of the models since it ensures , for instance , that in isolated systems the energy decays monotonically as expected from physical considerations . studying the conditions under which the response function of a system is cm is therefore of fundamental importance .",
    "the purpose of this note is to complement the analysis in @xcite by providing a more direct proof of the complete monotonicity through an explicit formula for the corresponding spectral density ( see section [ s : spectraldistribution ] ) .",
    "moreover , we discuss the problem of the numerical evaluation of the prabhakar function and we present some new numerical tests , based on a novel matlab routine , for validating the results on the cm and better presenting the behavior of the prabhakar function ( see section [ s : numericalexperiments ] ) .",
    "the present analysis allows us to point out that the havriliak ",
    "negami model described in ( [ eq : scheme ] ) may be extended to @xmath22 provided @xmath23 so that the corresponding response function keeps its licm character with a non - negative spectrum density .",
    "finally , section [ s : concludingremarks ] is devoted to conclusions and final remarks .",
    "we first note that for @xmath24 the lt in eq . ( 1.3 ) exhibits a branch cut on the negative real semi - axis but no poles .",
    "therefore , the inversion of the lt through the bromwich integral reduces to the evaluation of the integral on an equivalent hankel path which starts from @xmath25 along the lower negative real axis , encircles the small circle @xmath26 in the positive ( counterclockwise ) sense and returns to @xmath25 along the upper negative real axis .",
    "as shown in @xcite , when @xmath27 it is @xmath28 where @xmath29\\ ] ] denotes the spectral distribution of @xmath8 . in other words , since @xmath30 is required to be the iterated lt of @xmath31 , we recognize that it is the stieltjes transform of the spectral distribution . as a consequence",
    ", the spectral distribution can be determined as the inverse stieltjes transform of @xmath32 via the so - called titchmarsh inversion formula ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) as pointed out in the above equation .    by virtue of the bernstein theorem , to ensure the complete monotonicity of @xmath8 the spectral distribution @xmath31 is required to be non - negative for all @xmath33 .    in @xcite",
    "the authors have provided the conditions of complete monotonicity based on the requirements stated in the treatise by gripenberg et al .",
    "@xcite , see theorem 2.6 , pp .",
    "144 - 145 , which provide necessary and sufficient conditions to ensure the cm of a locally integrable function from its lt . here",
    "we do not take advantage of that theorem but we prefer to compute explicitly the spectral distribution from the titchmarsh formula and derive the conditions of non - negativity .",
    "it is indeed possible to observe that @xmath34 from which , after standard manipulations in complex analysis , we get @xmath35 }   { \\left ( r^{2\\alpha } + 2 r^{\\alpha}\\,\\cos(\\alpha\\pi)+1 \\right)^{\\gamma/2 } } } \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath36   \\in [ 0,\\pi]\\,.\\ ] ] for details we refer to the appendix where a warning on the correct branch of the function @xmath37 is also outlined .",
    "we easily recognize that @xmath38 is a non - negative and increasing function of @xmath39 limited by @xmath40 , as shown in the figure 1 , where the dotted lines indicate the limit values @xmath41 .",
    "in fact for @xmath42 it is direct to check its asymptotic behavior @xmath43     for @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    then we recognize that in order the spectral distribution to be non - negative the argument of the @xmath47 function in the numerator must be included in the closed interval @xmath48 $ ] and henceforth we find the conditions stated in @xcite , that we repeat for convenience :    @xmath49    in figures [ fig : fig_hkp_alpha050_lower1 ] , [ fig : fig_hkp_alpha050_great1 ] , [ fig : fig_hkp_alpha075_lower1 ] and [ fig : fig_hkp_alpha075_great1 ] we report the spectral distributions for the h - n model , obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : conditioncm ] ) assuming @xmath50 , keeping fixed @xmath51 and varying @xmath52 .",
    "we explicitly note the non - negativity of the spectral distributions ( ensuring the complete monotonicity of the corresponding response function ) not only when @xmath53 but more generally when @xmath54 , so @xmath52 can overcome the value 1 and generalize the h - n model .     for @xmath55 and @xmath56.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    , for @xmath57 , and @xmath58.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    , for @xmath59 and @xmath60.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    , for @xmath61 and @xmath62.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]",
    "the aim of this section is to validate the theoretical results on the cm of the prabhakar function by means of some numerical experiments .",
    "we will first discuss some methods for evaluating the function and we will validate their results by comparison with some asymptotic expansions ; hence we will provide some graphical evidences in order to confirm the correctness of the condition stated in ( [ eq : conditioncm ] ) for the cm of the function under investigation .      to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "very few mathematical packages provide built - in facilities for the computation of the ml function .",
    "one of the most used codes , the matlab mlf.m function devised by podlubny and kacenak @xcite and implementing algorithms similar to those investigated in @xcite , allows to compute the two parameters function with high accuracy but does not apply to the more general three parameters case .",
    "this is also the case of the computational software mathematica in which , starting from the recent version 9 , the ml function has been introduced but only for 1 and 2 parameters .",
    "other algorithms for the computation of the 2 parameters ml function were developed in @xcite .",
    "for the computation of the prabhakar function it is therefore necessary to device specific algorithms and we consider here three different approaches :    1 .",
    "truncation of the series expansion in ( [ eq : ml3_seriesexpansion ] ) ; 2 .",
    "evaluation of the lt ( [ eq : ml3_ltspectraldensity ] ) of the spectral distribution ( [ eq : ml3_spectraldensity ] ) ; 3",
    ".   numerical inversion of the lt ( [ eq : ml3_laplacetransform ] ) .    in the first approach some terms of the series expansion in the original definition ( [ eq : ml3_seriesexpansion ] ) are evaluated and summed up until their difference in absolute value is below a given threshold .",
    "this is the most straightforward and easy to implement approach but , unfortunately , it is the less reliable .",
    "it indeed works in an acceptable way only for small values of @xmath63 since otherwise the slow convergence imposes the computation of a huge number of terms ; in this case , not only the computation requires a large amount of time but it can also be impossible due to overflow errors in computing @xmath64 and @xmath65 and numerical cancellation in summing terms with very different magnitude .    with the second approach , the ml function ( [ eq : ml3_seriesexpansion ] ) is evaluated as the lt of its spectral distribution ( [ eq : ml3_spectraldensity ] ) by applying some numerical quadrature rule ( for instance , we use the adaptive gauss  kronrod quadrature implemented by the matlab quadgk function supporting infinite intervals and functions with endpoints singularities ) .",
    "we must however observe that this kind of quadrature is usually very time  consuming and moreover , as we will experimentally observe , it works only with singularities of moderate type , i.e. when @xmath66 is not much larger than @xmath67 .",
    "the third approach is performed into two main steps : the bromwich line in the formula for the inversion of the lt is first deformed into an equivalent path beginning and ending in the left half of the complex plane ( in this way the exponential factor @xmath68 rapidly decays without strong oscillations which are source of numerical instability ) ; hence a numerical quadrature ( for instance , the simple compound trapezoidal rule ) is applied along this path .",
    "an algorithm based on contours of parabolic type has been extensively studied in @xcite and successfully applied to the two parameters ml function in @xcite ; it is appreciated since any preassigned accuracy can be achieved with a modest computational effort ; moreover , since it is mainly based on the analysis of the singularities of the lt of the ml function , it can be easily adapted to evaluate the three parameters extension too @xcite .",
    "while the first two approaches apply to a very restricted range of parameters and arguments , the last one appears as the most robust and reliable for general use .",
    "we thus intend to evaluate the ml function by inverting its lt and use the other two methods just for validating the obtained results .",
    "as we can see from figures [ fig : fig_alpha050_beta090_gamma160_accuracy ] and [ fig : fig_alpha070_beta090_gamma110_accuracy ] , where we have plotted the difference , in absolute values , between the outcomes resulting from the application of the three above described approaches ( labeled respectively as @xmath69,@xmath70 and @xmath71 ) , the method based on the truncation of the series expansion of the ml function is reliable only when @xmath63 is not too far from the origin , otherwise large errors are expected .",
    "the evaluation by the lt of the spectral distribution and the numerical inversion of the lt of the ml function provide very similar results , with a difference very close to the machine precision , thus confirming the high accuracy which they are able to provide .",
    "we must however observe that the numerical evaluation of the lt ( [ eq : ml3_ltspectraldensity ] ) is a quite complicated task when @xmath72 because of the endpoint singularity in the spectral distribution ( [ eq : ml3_spectraldensity ] ) .",
    "the matlab quadrature code quadgk used for approximating the integral in ( [ eq : ml3_ltspectraldensity ] ) has been able to provide accurate results when @xmath57 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 ( see figure [ fig : fig_alpha050_beta090_gamma160_accuracy ] ) , i.e. for a singularity with a strength @xmath75 but not when @xmath76 , i.e. when the strength of the singularity is @xmath77 . at the same time it is has been possible to correctly evaluate the integral for @xmath78 , @xmath73 and @xmath79 as shown in figure [ fig : fig_alpha070_beta090_gamma110_accuracy ] but not when @xmath80 .",
    "we think however that this approach deserves a more in - depth investigation ( which is beyond the scope of this paper ) since more suitable quadrature rules could be applied to efficiently evaluate ( [ eq : ml3_ltspectraldensity ] ) .      to further validate the numerical computation of the prabhakar function , especially for large values of the argument @xmath63 , it is useful to derive some asymptotic expansions for @xmath81 .",
    "the first expansions in the whole complex plane were provided by wright in 1935 and 1940 in two distinct papers @xcite devoted to the analysis of more general hypergeometric functions .",
    "more recently ,",
    "paris @xcite improved the analysis of wright by considering also exponentially small expansions .",
    "although the results in the papers or wright and paris are very rigorous , their practical use is quite complicate since it demands for the computation of some residues of non elementary functions ; thus , for our aims it is more convenient to derive specific expansions by inverting the lt ( [ eq : ml3_laplacetransform ] ) as @xmath82 .",
    "it is simple to observe that the full series expansion in positive powers of @xmath83 of @xmath84 is @xmath85 where the binomial coefficients can be computed by recurrence and are related to gamma functions as follows @xmath86 by term by term inversion , and recalling the generalized lt pair ( see , for instance , the classical book of doetsch @xcite ) @xmath87 which holds for non integer @xmath88 , we get as @xmath89 the following asymptotic series for @xmath90 @xmath91 whilst , by neglecting in ( [ eq : ml3_asymptotic_lt ] ) the spurious singular term @xmath92 , in the case @xmath93 we have @xmath94 ( similar results are obtained , by using the mellin ",
    "barnes integral representation of the prabhakar function , in @xcite where however , perhaps due to a misprint , it seems that a term @xmath95 is missing ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the dominant term for @xmath81 ( asymptotic representation ) is given by    @xmath96    the plot in figure [ fig : fig_difference_asymptotic ] presents the difference , in absolute value , between the ml function ( [ eq : ml3_generalized ] ) evaluated by numerically inverting the lt and the truncation ( after the first 3 terms ) of the asymptotic expansions ( [ eq : ml3_asymptoticexpansion1]-[eq : ml3_asymptoticexpansion2 ] ) ; since the expansion are derived for @xmath81 , the first part of the positive real axis is omitted in the plot .",
    "-[eq : ml3_asymptoticexpansion2]).,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    as we can see , for the three selections of the order parameters @xmath2 ( which cover the three main different cases @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 ) the numerical evaluation of the ml function ( [ eq : ml3_generalized ] ) agrees in a reasonable way with the expansions ( [ eq : ml3_asymptoticexpansion1]-[eq : ml3_asymptoticexpansion2 ] ) and their difference is very small ( in some cases it rapidly achieves values below the machine precision of the floating  point arithmetic used for the computation ) .",
    "the rate at which the asymptotic expansions ( [ eq : ml3_asymptoticexpansion1]-[eq : ml3_asymptoticexpansion2 ] ) converge to the ml function ( [ eq : ml3_generalized ] ) obviously depends on @xmath100 ( or @xmath101 , when @xmath102 ) , i.e. the power of the leading term in the expansion of @xmath103 as @xmath81 .      on the basis of the observations in the previous subsections , the method exploiting the numerical inversion of the lt tuns out to be reliable and efficient for the computation of the prabhakar function and therefore it will be used in this work for validating the theoretical findings on cm properties .    in figure",
    "[ fig : fig_alpha0.70_gamma1.30_e_beta ] we show , for @xmath104 and @xmath105 the behavior of the function as the second parameter , namely @xmath66 , varies in a neighborhood of the threshold @xmath106 for which cm is expected .    ,",

    "@xmath113 and @xmath105.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    it is interesting to note that for values of @xmath66 below but very close to the threshold values @xmath67 for which cm is no longer assured , the cm can be only apparent .",
    "as we can see in figure [ fig : fig_alpha070_beta0905_gamma130_e ] indeed it could seem that the function is non negative and monotonic but a closer inspection , and on a wider range for @xmath63 , shows that negative values and a non monotonic behavior are achieved ( see the box inside the same figure [ fig : fig_alpha070_beta0905_gamma130_e ] ) .    ,",
