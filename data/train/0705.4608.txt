    "the _ nabla operator _ introduced by francois bergeron and adriano garsia  @xcite plays a fundamental role in the theory of symmetric functions and macdonald polynomials . to define this operator ,",
    "let us first introduce some notation .",
    "we let @xmath1 denote the ring of symmetric functions in the variables @xmath2 with coefficients in the field @xmath3 .",
    "the vector space @xmath1 has many well - known bases , all indexed by integer partitions .",
    "we will use the following bases of @xmath1 in this paper : the monomial symmetric functions @xmath4 ; the homogeneous symmetric functions @xmath5 ; the elementary symmetric functions @xmath6 ; the power - sum symmetric functions @xmath7 ; the schur functions @xmath8 ; and the modified macdonald polynomials @xmath9 .",
    "more details may be found in the encyclopedic reference  @xcite .",
    "the nabla operator is the unique @xmath3-linear map on @xmath1 such that @xmath10 for all partitions @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the transpose of @xmath11 .",
    "thus , the modified macdonald polynomials are the eigenfunctions of the nabla operator . from the combinatorial point of view , the nabla operator is important because it encodes a wealth of information about @xmath14-analogues of combinatorial objects such as lattice paths , parking functions , and labelled forests .",
    "the connection to combinatorics arises by considering the matrix of the linear operator @xmath15 relative to various bases for @xmath1 .",
    "given any two bases @xmath16 and @xmath17 of @xmath1 and any linear operator @xmath18 on @xmath1 , we write @xmath19_{(b_{\\lambda})}}$ ] to denote the unique matrix of scalars @xmath20 such that @xmath21 for all partitions @xmath22 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath23 and @xmath24 is the dual basis for @xmath25 relative to the hall inner product on @xmath1 , it follows that @xmath26 we often restrict consideration to the subspace @xmath27 of symmetric functions of degree @xmath28 , so that the matrix in question is a finite square matrix with rows and columns indexed by the partitions of @xmath28 .    by definition , @xmath29_{(\\tilde{h}_{\\mu})}}$ ] is a diagonal matrix with diagonal entries @xmath30 . for other choices of the input and output bases ,",
    "one obtains other @xmath3-matrices representing the nabla operator .",
    "remarkably , the entries in these matrices are often _ polynomials _ in @xmath31 and @xmath32 with integer coefficients all of like sign ; i.e. , we often have @xmath33 $ ] .",
    "whenever this occurs , one can seek combinatorial interpretations for various entries @xmath34 as sums of suitable signed , weighted objects .",
    "such interpretations have been sought after , conjectured , and ( in some cases ) proved by many different authors .",

    "our goal in this paper is to present a new conjecture that gives a combinatorial interpretation for _ every _ entry in the matrix @xmath38_{(s_{\\lambda})}}$ ] .",
    "we shall see that this conjecture unifies and clarifies the partial conjectures mentioned in table  [ tab : nabla ] .    in section  [ sec : conjecture ] of this paper , we describe our conjectured combinatorial model for the monomial expansion of @xmath39 and explain some connections to the more specialized conjectures in table  [ tab : nabla ] . in section  [ sec :",

    "our second claim is that the fillings of the skew shapes are semistandard . that the entries increase up columns is the content of condition  [ lndp : cond2 ] while rows are forced to weakly increase by condition  [ lndp : cond5 ] .",

    "we are left to consider the scenario that two paths intersect as in figure  [ fig : labint].1 or 2 ( @xmath423 is allowed to be one in either case ) .",
    "we claim that each object containing an intersection of type  1 can be paired with an object containing a region of type  2 .",
    "assume we have an intersection such as that of figure  [ fig : labint].1 .",
