    "it has been shown @xcite that , if a plane electromagnetic wave is scattered on a finite dielectric object , structural resonances can be excited in the object ( e.g. , whispering gallery modes ) .",
    "they are associated with very high amplitudes of oscillating em fields in the dielectric and its vicinity .",
    "their maxima exceed values reached in resonant cavities of typical linear accelerators by several orders of magnitude .",
    "therefore , one can think of applying these fields to accelerate charged particles @xcite .",
    "many other applications of the whispering gallery modes are described in @xcite .    as for the proposals given in @xcite ,",
    "both light produced by lasers and microwaves are conceivable .",
    "however , it is difficult to achieve the required synchronization of wave particle in the optical frequency range . in the microwave frequency range",
    ", this mechanism would require excessive total excitation energy and so may not be practical .    in this paper",
    "we demonstrate that the last mentioned problem can be overcome by locating the dielectric object in a resonant cavity .",
    "this appeals to traditional accelerating structures used in slac , see * figure  1*. in the latter case , maximum amplitudes of accelerating fields are restricted by joule heating losses in conducting walls and electric breakdown . in this connection , in existing accelerators ( e.g. , in lhc ) one avoids sharp edges of the walls and uses superconductive resonant cavities .",
    "unfortunately , since superconductivity of the walls disappears if the magnetic field on the wall exceeds a critical value , the maximal values of accelerating fields in these highly complicated cavities are not much higher than those reached in slac .",
    "the presence of a dielectric in the central part of the resonance cavity shifts the magnetic field maximum from regions close to the metallic wall towards the dielectric surface .",
    "this considerably lowers skin effect losses in the wall .",
    "even though additional losses due to dielectric heating are introduced , total losses would nevertheless be lower if one could apply ultra low loss dielectrics ( with @xmath0 ) as described in @xcite . in that case ,",
    "a resonator quality reaching @xmath1 can be obtained , as compared to @xmath2 for slac .",
    "our approach to describe electromagnetic oscillations in a resonant cavity assumes that the cavity can be divided into regions in which the fields can be determined analytically .",
    "the resonant frequency is defined by the fact that the fields must satisfy boundary conditions at the cavity wall along with continuity conditions at the interfaces .",
    "this frequency will be determined by numerically solving the consistency condition for these requirements .    in general , we assume that the cavity is bounded by a conducting spherical surface , and filled concentrically with @xmath3 either dielectric or vacuum layers . each dielectric layer is assumed to be homogeneous .",
    "we introduce a spherical coordinate system @xmath4 with its origin at the cavity center .",
    "the layers are bounded by @xmath5 , up to @xmath6 for the metallic boundary , see * figure [ cavity]*.    ) . ]",
    "the harmonically oscillating electromagnetic fields in each concentric layer are described by maxwell s equations ( gaussian units , magnetic permeability @xmath7 , and complex fields proportional to exp@xmath8 ) : @xmath9 where @xmath10 @xmath11 is the angular frequency , and @xmath12 denotes complex dielectric permittivity @xmath13 these fields split into transverse electric ( te ) or transverse magnetic ( tm ) , which have no radial components of either field @xcite . in an ideal resonator with perfectly conducting walls and perfect dielectrics , pure te or tm modes can be excited .",
    "they will also be approximately valid in real resonators if their energy losses are not too high .    using ( 9.116 ) , and ( 9.119 ) in @xcite , which describe the vacuum te field in spherical coordinates , and replacing there @xmath14 we obtain the most general form of the te field in the uniform dielectric : @xmath15 where @xmath16 @xmath17 are vector spherical harmonics as defined by eq .",

    "this means that it carries no electric or magnetic field",

    "an electric field , intensified by structural resonance , can be used to accelerate electrons .",
    "this is demonstrated here by placing a dielectric sphere concentrically inside a spherical resonator , in which an appropriate whispering gallery mode is excited .",
    "a strong , accelerating field appears next to the surface of the dielectric . at the same time",
    ", the tangential component of the magnetic field at the wall of the resonator is minimal .",
    "this makes losses at the metallic walls negligible without engaging expensive cryogenic systems ensuring superconductivity of the walls .",
    "the q factor of the resonator only depends on losses in the dielectric . for existing dielectrics ,",
    "this gives a q factor three orders of magnitude better than obtained in existing cylindrical cavities .",
    "furthermore , for the proposed spherical cavity , _ all _ field components at the metallic wall are either zero or very small , see figure  [ fields ] .",
    "therefore , one can expect the proposed spherical cavity to be less prone to electrical breakdowns than the traditional cylindrical cavity .",
