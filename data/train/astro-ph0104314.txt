    "other than for the magellanic clouds , one usually tries to explain the bulge s  with `` self  lensing '' models ; the lenses and the sources come from the same ( dynamical ) distribution .",
    "justification for this comes from the micro ",
    "lensing event  duration distribution , as well as recent determinations of the initial  mass function and the fraction of invisible matter in the solar neighbourhood ,",
    "all of which indicate that there is no significant amount of dark matter in the plane of the galaxy nor a large number of brown dwarfs ( alcock 1997 ; gould , flynn & bahcall 1998 ; kroupa 1998 ; kuijken & gilmore 1989 ; fuchs , jahreiss & flynn 1998 ) .",

    "the high measured value of @xmath4 by alcock ( 1997 ) could be reproduced by a barred density distribution , if oriented almost parallel to the  ( zhao & mao 1996 ) . however , this is not within the scope of realistic models that reproduce observed stellar surface densities and kinematics ( binney , gerhard & spergel 1997 ; bissantz 1997 ; zhao , rich & spergel 1996 ; nikolaev & weinberg 1997 ; fux 1997 ; sevenster 1999 ) .",

    "this measurement gives one of the most convincing arguments for non  circular motions in the galactic disk .",
    "many explanations have been proposed for the origin of the arm , ranging from an explosive event in the  to non  circular motions forced by a rotating bar ( shane 1972 ; yuan 1984 ; binney 1997 ; englmaier & gerhard 1999 ) .    in most stellar samples such",
    "a longitude  velocity structure can not be traced , for obvious reasons .",
    "however , we can identify nine oh / ir stars from a systematic sample as `` 3kpc '' stars (; see sevenster 1999 for details ) .",
    "they do not only share their longitude  velocity structure with the hi filament , but also their latitudes : all are well within a degree from the plane .",

    "the ages of the stars and the 53  expansion rate also rule out an explosive origin of the 3kpc arm .",
    "they should be at a radius of 10 kpc by now , whereas the current position is about half way between the sun and the galactic center .",
    "the evident explanation for this close association of the oh / ir stars and the hydrogen , that has survived for 2 galactic revolutions , is that they move along the same single filled elliptical orbit , swept up by the rotating bar into an inner ring ( 2 ) .",
    "this is in agreement with independent determinations of the pattern speed ( eg . kalnajs 1991 ; kalnajs 1996 ; fux 1997 ) .",

    "this provides another good reason to assume that there is an inner ring in the galaxy , such as commonly observed in other barred galaxies .",
