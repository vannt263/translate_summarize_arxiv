    "<S> we calculate a long - range string order directly rather than an extrapolated string order in a finite - size system . in the nel phase , the string correlations decay exponentially . in the xy phase ( tomonaga - luttinger liquid phase ) , the behaviors of the string correlations show a unique two - step decaying to zero within a relatively very large lattice distance , which makes a finite - size study difficult to verify the non - existence of the string order . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in the haldane phase , the non - vanishing string correlations in the limit of a very large distance allow to characterize the phase boundaries to the xy phase and the nel phase , which implies that the transverse long - range string order is the order parameter for the haldane phase . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the singular behaviors of the von neumann entropy and the fidelity per lattice site are shown to capture clearly the phase transition points that are consistent with the results from the transverse long - range string order . </S>",
    "<S> the estimated critical points including a berezinsky - kosterlitz - thouless transition from the xy phase to the haldane phase agree well with the previous results : @xmath0 for the xy - haldane phase transition and @xmath1 for the haldane - nel phase transition from the density renormalization group . from a finite - entanglement scaling of the von neumann entropy with respect to the truncation dimension </S>",
    "<S> , the central charges are found to be @xmath2 at @xmath0 and @xmath3 at @xmath1 , respectively , which shows that the xy - haldane phase transition at @xmath4 belongs to the heisenberg universality class , while the haldane - nel phase transition at @xmath5 belongs to the two - dimensional classical ising universality class . </S>",
    "<S> it is also shown that , the long - range order parameters and the von neumann entropy , as well as the fidelity per site approach , can be applied to characterize quantum phase transitions as a universal phase transition indicator for one - dimensional lattice many - body systems . </S>"
