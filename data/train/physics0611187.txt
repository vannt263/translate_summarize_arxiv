    "optical ring cavities have very interesting particularities distinguishing them from ordinary linear cavities .",
    "the most important one is that the counterpropagating modes have independent photon budgets , i.e.  a light scattering object can pump photons from one mode into the reverse mode .",
    "the phase of the standing wave formed by interference of the counterpropagating modes then becomes a degree of freedom .",
    "this features is exploited in ring laser gyroscopes , whose central device is a ring cavity .",
    "when the ring cavity rotates about the normal vector of the plane in which the laser beams propagate , the resonant frequencies of the counterpropagating optical modes of the ring cavity are doppler - shifted by an amount proportional to the rotation velocity .",
    "this phenomenon is known as the sagnac effect .",
    "a well - known problem of gyroscopes is mode locking , i.e.  an undesired complete phase synchronization of the counterpropagating waves at low rotation velocities @xcite , when the resonant frequencies of the waves are almost degenerate .",
    "the problem arises when some amount of light in a ring cavity mode is scattered into the solid angle of the counterpropagating mode .",
    "this light seeds the cavity mode into which it is scattered and thus forces it to adopt the same frequency .",
    "scattering from mirror imperfections is almost unavoidable . in practice in a laser gyroscope , this phase locking is circumvented by lifting the mode degeneracy by various means , i.e.  faraday effect , using higher - order transversal modes or modulation of the mirrors positions . in particular , dithering techniques where the position of one or several mirrors is slightly modulated and the signal phase - sensitively analyzed have led to amazing resolutions in state - of - the - art laser gyros .",
    "e.g.  the tumbling of the earth s rotation axis can be measured with a precision of 1 part in @xmath0 @xcite    mode locking is always a problem when the phase of the standing wave in the ring cavity is needed as a degree of freedom .",
    "this is not only the case in laser gyros , but also when the subject of interest is the interaction of a medium inserted into the cavity with the counterpropagating optical modes .",
    "recently , ring cavities have been rediscovered for cold atom optics @xcite .",
    "atoms suspended within the mode volume of the cavity scatter light from the pumped into the reverse mode thus establishing a phase relation between the modes .",
    "however the atoms , although they have some inertia , can not be considered immobile . from this",
    "results a self - consistent dynamics with a time - dependent frequency shift between the locked cavity modes @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon has been termed the collective atomic recoil laser ( carl ) . in such a system",
    "additional backscattering from the mirror surfaces plays a noticeable role leading , under certain circumstances , to degenerate frequency locking for a atomic coupling strength below a certain threshold @xcite .",
    "the problem is particularly disturbing when the coupling mechanism under investigation is weak .",
    "this is the case in the superradiant regime of the carl @xcite , which arises when the collective coupling is weak compared to the cavity decay rate .",
    "it is even more prominent in the so - called quantum regime @xcite . in the present paper ,",
    "we experimentally study mirror backscattering in a high - finesse ring cavity .",
    "most of the solutions developed to reduce this problem in laser gyros with an active medium are not applicable to our system . here",
    "we propose a scheme which can be adapted to empty sagnac interferometer , such as our ring cavity , pumped from only one side .",
    "it consists in compensating mirror backscattering by injection of an additional light field , whose phase is controlled via an active feedback mechanism .",
    "in contrast to the gyro , we want the absence of any light field in one mode to avoid seeding .",
    "the ring cavity is very similar to the one used in refs .",
    "it consists of one plane incoupling mirror with the intensity transmission @xmath1 and two curved high reflecting mirrors with @xmath2 .",
    "the cavity is @xmath3 cm long and has a beam waist of @xmath4 m . for the sake of definiteness",
    ", we describe in the following the cavity modes by their field amplitudes @xmath5 scaled to the field per photon , so that @xmath6 is the number of photons in the modes @xcite . only the mode @xmath7 is continuously pumped by a titanium - sapphire laser at @xmath8 nm .",
    "the laser can be stabilized to this mode using the pound - drever - hall method .",
    "the counterpropagating ( probe ) mode is labeled by @xmath9 .",
    "the ring cavity can be operated in two ways depending on the polarization of the incoupled light . for @xmath10-polarized light a finesse of 87000",
    "is determined from a measured intensity decay time of @xmath11s . for @xmath12-polarized light",
    "the finesse is 6400 .",
    "we measure the intracavity light power via the fields leaking through the cavity mirrors ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the outcoupled light power is related to the intracavity power by @xmath13 and @xmath14 respectively , where @xmath15ghz is the free spectral range of the cavity and @xmath16 the laser frequency .",
    "although no light is injected into the reverse mode @xmath9 , we observe that it carries a considerable amount of light , between @xmath17 and @xmath18 of the light power in the pumped mode .",
    "furthermore , thermal drifts which slightly influence the cavity geometry [ and hence the resonant frequency as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) ] also cause variations of the reverse power [ see fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) ] .",
    "the origin of the light found in the reverse mode is backscattering from the surfaces of the three cavity mirrors . the mirrors ( research electro - optics ,",
    "generate losses due to absorption in the dielectric layers or to scattering from imperfections at the surfaces .",
    "the losses due to scattering are typically below @xmath19  ppm for high - quality surface mirrors @xcite .",
    "let us assume that the light scattering from a mirror surface is isotropic .",
    "the amount of light scattered into the reverse mode is proportional to the solid angle @xcite @xmath20 with the amplitude reflection coefficient @xmath21 the intermode coupling strength reads @xmath22 therefore , in units of the cavity decay rate @xmath23 the coupling strength is @xmath24 .",
    "figs .  [ fig2](a , b ) suggest a correlation between the drifts of the cavity length and the amount of backscattering .",
    "information about the nature of the scatterers can only be gathered by injecting light into the cavity , which is only possible when the pump laser is resonant with a cavity mode . apart from tuning the resonant frequency of the cavity by modifying its length",
    ", one can probe the discrete set of longitudinal modes by varying the pump laser frequency .",
    "the analysis of the reverse power as a function of the pump frequency should lead to a better understanding of the temporal behavior of the reverse power .",
    "the experiment exhibited in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] indeed shows a strong dependence of the backscattering rate on the frequency of the pump laser , when it is resonant to an eigenfrequency of the cavity .",
    "a very simple model can be used to describe the transfer of light between the modes by the backscattering mechanism . for simplicity",
    "we assume that only one mode , @xmath7 , is pumped by resonant light .",
    "the pump laser is tightly locked to this mode .",
    "the losses due to transmission through the cavity mirrors or to backscattering at the mirror surfaces are negligible , so that the mode @xmath7 is in a steady state .    at a given frequency",
    ", the mode coupling induced by mirror backscattering can be expressed by a single complex quantity : the coupling strength @xmath25 describes at which rate a scatterer sitting at a given location shuffles photons from one mode into the reverse mode .",
    "@xmath26 is the wavenumber of the resonant pump light . the basic equation for the evolution of the reverse mode @xmath27",
    "can then be written as @xcite , @xmath28 the model is lend from a more general system @xcite , where the backscattering is provided by atoms .",
    "in contrast , here we assume spatially fixed scatterers .",
    "the cavity decay rate @xmath29 describes the losses for the reverse mode . obviously , the coupling strength is frequency - dependent @xmath30 .",
    "since the cavity consists of three mirrors , the scatterers are spatially separated . if we assume the presence of one microscopic scatterer sitting on each mirror surface localized at the position @xmath31 along the optical axis , we get , @xmath32 the reverse power results from interference of the waves backscattered from all three cavity mirrors . the stationary solution of the carl equations  ( [ eq01 ] ) without atoms , but with three immobile point - like scatterers is @xmath33 this expression is invariant upon simultaneous translations of all mirrors , @xmath34 .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are satisfied when the cavity is resonant , i.e.  @xmath35 holds separately for every @xmath36 , but only if @xmath37 .",
    "fitting the expression to the measured values ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) permits to determine the contributions @xmath38 of every mirror to backscattering .",
    "the values are consistent with the rough estimation ( [ eq02 ] ) from the mirror surface roughness .    based on this model",
    "we may also understand the observation of fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) .",
    "a strictly uniform expansion of the cavity length by @xmath39 modifies the distances between any two mirrors by @xmath40 , but leaves the quantity @xmath25 unchanged .",
    "the observations of fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) thus result from a _ non - uniform _ expansion of the cavity .",
    "the assumption that the scattering defects or dust particles at the mirror surfaces are point - like is a course approximation . in reality scatterers sitting on the same mirror",
    "may be much larger than an optical wavelength and cross many phase planes",
    ". if the scattering is not uniform across the scatterer , the dispersion spectrum @xmath41 is additionally modulated . however , since the spatial distribution of the scatterer being on the order @xmath42 , where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the reflection angles in the ring cavity , the spectral width will be large , @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , the broadening of the scatterers distribution on one mirror only slightly influences the spectrum recorded in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . nevertheless , it may account ( together with thermal drifts during the data recording ) for deviations between the measurement and the fitted curve . from the experimental point of view",
    ", the most interesting feature is that backscattering can be reduced by a proper choice of the resonant cavity mode .",
    "we have seen in the previous section that the frequency - dependence of the amount of backscattered light is due to interference of the light reflected from all three cavity mirrors . if a forth scatterer could be introduced on purpose , its amplitude and phase could be designed such as to cancel out the field produced by the cavity mirrors .",
    "such an additional scatterer can be simulated by injecting a laser beam into the reverse mode of the ring cavity .",
    "moreover , by continuously monitoring the amount of light in the reverse mode and using this information to control the phase of the injected beam , the intensity in the reverse mode can be stabilized to zero by a servo loop as shown in fig .",
    "this is necessary since , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the amount of backscattering varies in time due to thermal drifts .",
    "the bandwidth of the servo loop must be larger than the drift rate of the amount of backscattering , which is on the time scale of minutes .",
    "however , one has to be aware that the phase of the injected light field may be subject to acoustic noise itself .",
    "nevertheless , a piezo transducer ( mounted to mirror m4 ) appears to be sufficient for applying the corrections .",
    "concretely , we feed back part of the light leaking through mirror m3 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , thus providing an additional tunable backscattering mechanism .",
    "let us denote the coupling strength generated by the feedback interferometer by @xmath46 .",
    "then taking the mirror backscattering from eq .",

    ", we set up the locking scheme fig .",
    "we reinject a light beam leaking out of the pump mode through one of the cavity mirrors into the reverse mode .",
    "the power in the reverse mode , whose behavior is shown in part ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , exhibits strong fluctuations due to acoustic noise randomly shifting the phase of the injected beam .",
    "the power fluctuations vary within the range @xmath60 .    by controlling the phase of the reinjected beam by a servo loop its light can be made to cancel out the light in the reverse mode due to mirror backscattering .",
    "part ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows the power in the reverse mode when the servo loop is operating . in part ( c )",
    "the injection beam is blocked , so that the power in the reverse mode is due to mirror backscattering only .",
    "the backscattering ratio is @xmath61 .",
    "comparison of ( b ) and ( c ) reveals a more than 10-fold reverse power reduction .    for detecting the coupling dynamics due to the medium inserted into the ring cavity ,",
    "the active servo must be interrupted by a sample - and - hold circuitry .",
    "otherwise , the servo loop works to compensate the atomic backscattering mechanism under investigation .",
    "since the typical time scale for the medium - induced coupling is @xmath62s , the inertia of the mirrors positions is sufficient to guarantee steady - state conditions during the measurement , even when the servo loop is briefly interrupted .",
    "mirror backscattering in a ring cavity is not a doom . for a fixed cavity geometry",
    "it can be minimized by tuning the laser to a longitudinal resonator mode where backscattering happens to be small .",
    "this is however not possible if the cavity is subject to non - uniform drifts . in this work we discussed and demonstrated how to couple an additional light field into the reverse mode with an amplitude and phase chosen such as to obtain destructive interference @xcite",
    "this measure allows us to limit the power in the reverse mode to below 200  ppm of the pump power .",
    "a further improvement may be expected from a more stable mechanical mounting and by replacing the piezo modulation with an electro - optic phase modulation at high frequencies .",
    "the optical sidebands generated by such a phase modulation could be used to implement a pound - drever - hall type locking scheme , whose advantage is a very large servo bandwidth .    to give a rough idea of how much the reverse power can be suppressed with a better servo loop",
    ", we estimate the shot noise limit .",
    "the number of photons recorded by the photodetector of the locking servo within the @xmath63ms integration time is @xmath64 .",
    "this signal is subject to poisson - distributed noise , @xmath65 .",
    "the shot noise level is reached when the phase @xmath66 of the injected laser beam controlled by the servo has fluctuations of only @xmath67 .",
    "these phase excursions produce a reverse power ratio of @xmath68 when the locking servo regulates to minimum reverse power and @xmath69 .",
    "hence , @xmath70 with typical pump powers of @xmath71w and under the premise of a perfectly operating servo system the shot noise level is @xmath72 .",
    "this leaves room for improvement using a faster servo loop , e.g.  having a much larger servo bandwidth .",
    "the effect bears some analogy with the accelerated depletion of a cavity by injection of phase - shifted light published in h. rohde , j. eschner , f. schmidt - kaler , and r. blatt : j. opt .",
