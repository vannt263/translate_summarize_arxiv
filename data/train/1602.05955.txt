    "generating quantum superposition states in macroscopic systems is an important goal in experimental quantum science .",
    "studying such states will allow us to probe the limits of applicability of quantum mechanics and to harness quantum physics for new technologies .",
    "early evidence for quantum phenomena with massive systems was provided by electron diffraction experiments  @xcite and , through the efforts of the last nine decades , quantum - matter - wave behaviour has been observed for neutrons  @xcite , trapped ion systems  @xcite , ultracold atoms  @xcite , and even molecules comprising many hundreds of atoms  @xcite . a promising route to explore quantum behaviour on an even more macroscopic scale is provided by quantum optomechanics  @xcite where a mechanical oscillator interacts with an optical field via radiation pressure .",
    "this versatile quantum - optical platform enables tests of fundamental physics  @xcite , the development of microwave - to - optical interfaces  @xcite , and high - precision weak - force sensors  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the ligo gravitation - wave antenna can be considered a large - scale optomechanical system  @xcite .",
    "recently , impressive progress has been made using both opto- and electro - mechanical systems with examples including single - phonon - level operations  @xcite , quantum coherent coupling  @xcite , mechanically - induced squeezing of light  @xcite , and even opto - mechanical entanglement  @xcite .",
    "experimental efforts continue in a diverse set of directions , however , progress is hindered by three main factors : weak single - photon coupling , sensitivity to optical loss , and mechanical decoherence .",
    "the approach we introduce here exploits measurement - induced non - linearities  @xcite to overcome the challenges of weak coupling and optical loss .",
    "in addition , our approach offers resilience against initial thermal occupation and can also be readily employed in cryogenic systems to overcome the challenge of thermal decoherence .    to understand radiation pressure consider the reflection of a single photon from a mechanical resonator .",
    "the reflection imparts a momentum  inversely proportional to the wavelength  onto the resonator and concurrently the optical field acquires a phase - shift  proportional to the mechanical displacement .",
    "this momentum , however , is typically very small compared to the quantum noise of the resonator due to weak optomechanical coupling . in order to enhance the strength of this interaction , experimental efforts often employ an optical cavity to increase the number of reflections  @xcite .",
    "utilising such cavity enhancement , the seminal works of bose , jacobs , and knight  @xcite ; and marshall _ et al_.  @xcite , proposed using a superposition of the optical vacuum and a single photon to generate optomechanical entanglement with the motion of a mechanically oscillating mirror forming part of a fabry - perot cavity . in this case , the mechanical resonator is subject to a quantum superposition of the identity operation ( no photon present ) and a displacement operation ( single photon present ) , thus generating a mechanical schrdinger - cat state .",
    "our method enables the generation of mechanical superposition states without the need for non - classical optical input states such as single photons .",
    "rather , we use an optomechanical interaction for a time much shorter than the mechanical period  @xcite with a weak optical coherent state and then project the reflected field , via photon counting , onto a superposition of zero and one photon to conditionally generate the superposition .",
    "in contrast to refs .",
    "@xcite , the measurement used in our scheme leaves the mechanics in a single - mode superposition state , which is achieved by projection from a more easily prepared form of optomechanical correlations . a single - mode quantum superposition state  with components separated in the momentum quadrature ",
    "will show interference fringes in the position probability distribution with a frequency inversely proportional to the superposition separation .",
    "when the photon detection registers the required event to prepare such a state an independent readout beam is then used to verify and characterise the mechanical state .",
    "the process of our scheme is non - classical and generates quantum states of motion independent of the coupling strength and for finite initial thermal occupation .",
    "moreover , the size of the generated mechanical superposition state can be made larger by projection onto an optical @xmath0-state  @xcite , which can be implemented using coherent state inputs , multi - port interferometry , and multi - photon coincidence measurements  @xcite .",
    "unlike preparation of large @xmath0 states , projection onto these states is experimentally simple .",
    "we implement this process experimentally and observe the first mechanical interference fringe pattern and the predicted phase - superresolution for a two - photon coincidence measurement . in this proof - of - concept experiment",
    "we observe a high - visibility fringe pattern in the mechanical position but we do not observe any non - classical features due to quantum decoherence and low readout sensitivity . generating and observing single - mode non - classicality , such as wigner negativity , of a massive mechanical oscillator remains an outstanding challenge .",
    "our measurement - based - scheme offers a promising route to achieving this important goal and can be readily applied to a number of optomechanical systems beyond the system used here .",
    "this experimental technique provides a powerful platform to empirically explore open - quantum - system dynamics , test potential collapse models of the wavefunction  @xcite , and enable the development of quantum - enhanced weak force sensors .",

    "the two optical fields inside the interferometer then interfere on a beam - splitter and photon counting is performed on the two output ports .",
    "a single - photon click on one of the detectors effectively projects the optical state that was inside the interferometer onto the path - entangled number state , i.e. @xmath1 , which is the state used in refs .  @xcite .",
    "if , instead , both detectors register a single photon then , due to second - order quantum interference , the optical state that interacted with the mechanical resonator within the interferometer must have been a 2-photon @xmath0-state @xmath2 . in this case , the mechanical oscillator was subject to a superposition of the identity operation and a two - photon radiation - pressure displacement , thus enhancing the size of the superposition by a factor of two compared with the single photon detection case .",

    "thus , the super - resolution achieved by such projections is used here as a resource for state preparation . in a quantum regime ,",
