    "in an effort to meet the escalating demand for increasingly higher - capacity and improved - reliability wireless systems , the ` massive ' or large - scale multiple - input multiple - output ( ls - mimo ) concept has been proposed @xcite-@xcite , where typically each base station ( bs ) is equipped with a large number of antenna elements ( aes ) to serve a much smaller number of single - ae users . this way each user may have access to several aes .",
    "this large - scale mimo technology offers several significant advantages in comparison to the conventional mimo concept having a moderate number of aes .",
    "firstly , asymptotic analysis based on random matrix theory @xcite demonstrates that both the intra - cell interference and the uncorrelated noise effects can be efficiently mitigated , as the number of aes tends to infinity .",
    "furthermore , the energy consumption of cellular bss can be substantially reduced @xcite and the ls - mimo systems are robust , since the failure of one or a few of the aes and radio frequency ( rf ) chains would not appreciably affect the resultant system performance @xcite .",
    "additionally , low - complexity signal - processing relying on matched - filter ( mf ) based transmit precoding ( tpc ) and detection can be used to for approaching the optimal performance , when the number of aes at the bs tends to infinity  @xcite .",
    "similar to conventional mimo systems , knowledge of the channel state information ( csi ) is also required at the bs of ls - mimo systems , namely for data detection in the uplink ( ul ) and for multi - user tpc in the downlink ( dl )  @xcite . in the time - division duplexing ( tdd ) protocol , the bs estimates the ul channels and obtains the dl csi by exploiting the channel s reciprocity  @xcite .",
    "however , this approach suffers from the so - called pilot contamination ( pc ) problem @xcite in multi - cell multi - user scenarios due to the reuse of the pilot sequences in adjacent cells , which imposes grave interference on the channel estimate at the bs .",
    "furthermore , the commonly used mf and zero - forcing ( zf ) tpc schemes will impose inter - cell interference ( ici ) on the dl transmission , which can not be reduced by increasing the number of aes at the bs .",
    "hence , the problem of ici and pc has been extensively studied @xcite . the fractional frequency reuse ( ffr )",
    "scheme  @xcite adopted in lte release 9 aims for mitigating the ici by assigning orthogonal frequency bands to edge users in the adjacent cells at the cost of additional spectral resources .",
    "the original frequency - division duplexing ( fdd ) based coordinated multi - point ( comp ) transmission of lte - a release 11 @xcite is able to avoid the ici between adjacent cells , whereby each user estimates and feeds back the quantized dl channel from all adjacent cells to the corresponding bs , and then the bs distributes the csi to adjacent cells",
    ". however , this kind of fdd based comp technique would not be feasible for massive mimo since the csi feedback overhead would be huge as the number of bs antennas increasing @xcite . using time - shifted pilot sequences for asynchronous transmission among the adjacent cells",
    "@xcite partially mitigates this problem , but it leads to mutual interference between data transmission and pilot transmission .",
    "a tpc scheme can be used for mitigating the ici with the aid of joint multi - cell processing  @xcite , but again , imposes a high information exchange overhead .",
    "the authors of  @xcite imposed specific conditions on the channel s covariance matrix , which is only valid for the asymptotic case of infinitely many aes at the bs .",
    "the angle - of - arrival ( aoa ) based methods of  @xcite exploit the fact that the users having mutually non - overlapping aoas hardly contaminate each other even if they use the same pilot sequence , but naturally , the efficiency of these methods relies on the assumption that the aoa spread of each user is small , which is not always the case under realistic channel conditions .",
    "a data - aided channel estimation scheme was proposed in  @xcite , whereby partially decoded data is used for estimating the channel and the pc effects can be beneficially reduced by iterative processing at the cost of an increased computational complexity .",
    "additionally , the blind method of  @xcite based on subspace partitioning is capable of reducing the ici under the assumption that the channel vectors of different users are orthogonal , which is not often the case in practice .",
    "the scheme proposed in @xcite is capable of eliminating pc all together , but this is achieved with the aid of a complex dl and ul training procedure .",
    "note that all these existing contributions treat all users in the same way , as though they suffer from the same pc , but in reality the severity of pc varies among the users .    against the above background , inspired by the ffr scheme  @xcite adopted in lte release 9 ,",
    "we propose a soft pilot reuse ( spr ) scheme for mitigating the pc of ls - mimo systems , whereby a cell - edge pilot group is applied for the cell - edge users in adjacent cells , while the cell - center users reuse the same center pilot group in all cells .",
    "furthermore , by extending the classical block diagonalization ( bd ) precoding @xcite to a multi - cell scenario , a multi - cell block diagonalization ( mbd ) tpc techniques is conceived for mitigating the ici and for enhancing the quality of service ( qos ) for the edge users .",
    "specifically , the contributions of this paper are summarized as follows .",
    "* we break away from the traditional practice of treating the pc for all users identically - instead , we divide the users into two different groups to be considered separately , namely , center users subjected to a slight pc and the edge users suffering from more severe pc . in this way , the center users can benefit directly from the ls - mimo technology and the efforts can be directed towards improving the qos for the edge users . * in contrast to the ffr scheme , which assigns orthogonal frequency bands to the edge users in adjacent cells , the proposed spr scheme divides the pilot types into two groups within the same frequency band , i.e. in a center pilot group , which is reused for the center users in all cells and in an edge pilot group , which is applied for the edge users in adjacent cells .",
    "thus , for the edge users , the accuracy of the channel estimation is improved and the ul achievable rate is increased . moreover , by using slightly more pilot resources for edge users , the bs becomes capable of estimating not only the intra - cell channels of the users within the reference cell , but also the knowledge of the ` inter - cell channels ' of the edge users in the adjacent cells .",
    "* different from the original comp technique has to obtain the inter - cell channels by consuming large overhead @xcite , the proposed mbd precoding can directly exploit the partial knowledge of the ` inter - cell channels ' and is capable of suppressing the ici imposed on the edge users of the adjacent cells . specifically , by extending the classical bd tpc to a multi - cell scenario , the mbd tpc projects the dl transmit signal onto the null space of the subspace spanned by the partially known ` inter - cell channels ' .",
    "thus , the ici imposed on the edge users of the adjacent cells can be substantially mitigated , hence the qos of the edge users is significantly enhanced . * in order to analyze the performance of our proposal , we compare the associated pilot requirements , derive the attainable average ul as well as dl rate and characterize the computational complexity imposed .",
    "our theoretical derivation confirms that both the achievable ul and dl rate of the edge users is significantly improved at the cost of requiring slightly more pilots .",
    "moreover , our simulation results show that the average ul and dl cell throughput in the spr and mbd aided system is able to approach and even exceed that of the conventional system , provided that a modestly increased number of bs aes is affordable .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ s2 ] , we briefly review the multi - cell ls - mimo system model , while section  [ s3 ] is devoted to detailing the pc , which is the main performance - limiting factor of ls - mimo systems .",
    "section  [ s4 ] further details the motivation of this paper , while the proposed spr scheme and mbd precoding are discussed in section  [ s5 ] .",
    "section  [ s6 ] provides our performance analysis of the proposed spr scheme and mbd precoding .",
    "our simulation results quantifying the benefits of our proposals are presented in section  [ s7 ] , while our conclusions follow in section  [ s7 ] .    throughout our discussions ,",
    "boldface lower and upper - case symbols represent vectors and matrices , respectively .",
    "the transpose , conjugate , and hermitian transpose operators are given by @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "the moore - penrose pseudo inverse operator is denoted by @xmath3 and the trace operator is represented by @xmath4 , while @xmath5 denotes the diagonal matrix associated with @xmath6 at its diagonal entries and the @xmath7 identity matrix is given by @xmath8 .",

    "[ eq1 ] , the large - scale fading coefficients @xmath24 are the same for the different antennas at the same bs , but they are user - dependent . moreover , they are related to both the pathloss and shadow fading , which will be addressed in detail in the context of our simulations . thus , the channel matrix of all the @xmath15 users in the @xmath19-th cell and the bs in the @xmath20-th cell can be represented by @xmath25\\nonumber\\\\   = & \\big[\\mathbf{g}_{i , j,1 } ~ \\mathbf{g}_{i , j,2 } \\cdots \\mathbf{g}_{i , j , k}\\big ]   \\mathbf{d}_{i , j}^{1/2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 denotes the large - scale fading matrix relating all the @xmath15 users in the @xmath19-th cell to the @xmath20-th cell s bs .    by adopting the tdd protocol , the bs obtains the dl channel estimate by exploiting the reciprocity of the ul and dl channels .",
    "more specifically , both the small - scale fading vectors and the large - scale fading coefficients may be deemed to be equal for both the dl and ul directions , provided that the bandwidth is sufficiently narrow for avoiding the independent fading of the dl and ul .    before considering the pc phenomenon",
    ", we summarize the asymptotic orthogonality on random vector @xcite .",
    "let @xmath27 be two independent vectors with distribution @xmath28 . then from the law of large numbers",
    ", we have @xmath29 where @xmath30 denotes the almost sure convergence .",
    "by considering the tdd protocol , we adopt the widely used block - fading channel model , whereby the channel vectors @xmath31 remain constant during the channel s coherence interval . as shown in fig .  [ tdd ] , each coherence interval is comprised of four stages for each user @xcite : 1 )  ul data transmission ; 2 )  ul pilot transmission ; 3 )  bs processing ; and 4 )  dl data transmission .    at the first stage",
    ", all users in all cells synchronously send ul data to their corresponding bss and the user data received at the bs in the @xmath20-th cell can be represented as @xmath32 , where @xmath33 with @xmath34 denotes the symbol transmitted from the @xmath18-th user roaming in the @xmath19-th cell , @xmath35 represents the ul data transmission power and @xmath36 denotes the corresponding ul channel s additive gaussian white noise ( awgn ) vector associated with @xmath37 .    for a typical ls - mimo system , the pilot sequences used within a specific cell are orthogonal , but the same pilot group is typically reused in the adjacent cells due to the limited number of orthogonal pilot sequences .",
    "thus , during the second stage , the matrix of pilot sequences received at the bs of the @xmath20-th cell , which is denoted by @xmath38 , can be represented as @xmath39 , where the matrix @xmath40^t\\in\\mathbb{c}^{k\\times\\tau}$ ] containing the transmitted pilot sequence satisfies @xmath41 , @xmath42 is the transmission power of the pilots and @xmath43 denotes the ul channel s awgn matrix .    during the third stage , the bs of the @xmath20-th cell obtains an estimate of the channel matrix @xmath44 using any conventional channel estimation method by directly correlating the received pilot matrix with the local pilot matrix , yielding @xmath45 it can readily be seen that the channel estimate of the @xmath18-th user in the @xmath20-th cell , namely @xmath46 , is a linear combination of the channels @xmath31 for @xmath47 , which include the channels of the users in the other cells associated with the same pilot sequence .",
    "this phenomenon is referred to as pc  @xcite .",
    "given the estimated channel matrix @xmath48 and by adopting the low - complexity mf detector , the detected symbol arriving from the @xmath18-th user in the @xmath20-th cell can be represented as @xmath49 where @xmath50 denotes the @xmath18-th column of @xmath51 , @xmath52 represents the interference , which can be reduced to an arbitrarily low level by increasing the number of transmit antennas @xmath14 at the bs , and @xmath53 indicates that the approximation holds by invoking the asymptotic orthogonality associated with @xmath54 .",
    "thus , the ul signal to interference plus noise ratio ( sinr ) of the @xmath18-th user in the @xmath20-th cell can be calculated as @xmath55 and the achievable ul rate can be expressed as @xmath56 , where @xmath57 evaluates the spectral efficiency reduction caused by the pilot transmission @xcite .",
    "it is clear the ul achievable rate remains limited by the pc and it can not be increased by simply assigning an increased transmission power and/or pilot power , i.e. , by increasing @xmath35 and/or @xmath42 .",
    "the pc affects the dl transmission during the fourth stage as well .",
    "the normalized mf precoding matrix  @xcite is commonly used for the dl transmission , which can be represented by @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is a normalization factor .",
    "the bs in the @xmath20-th cell transmits an @xmath14-dimensional signal vector as @xmath60 , where @xmath61^t$ ] with @xmath62 denotes the source symbol vector for the @xmath15 users in the @xmath20-th cell .",
    "the received signals of the @xmath15 users in the @xmath20-th cell can be collected together as @xmath63 , where @xmath64 denotes the dl channel awgn vector associated with @xmath65 .",
    "similar to the derivation seen in ( [ sinrul ] ) , the dl sinr of the @xmath18-th user in the @xmath20-th cell can be derived as @xmath66 where @xmath67 denotes the corresponding interference similar to @xmath52 given in ( [ uldatadetection ] ) .",
    "the corresponding dl rate can be represented as @xmath68 .    in summary , the pc caused by the reuse of the same orthogonal pilot group in adjacent cells can not be reduced by increasing the number of antennas at the bs , hence it limits the achievable performance of multi - cell multi - user ls - mimo systems .",
    "in the existing state - of - the - art solutions @xcite , which aim for reducing the pc , all users are treated identically . however , according to ( [ sinrul ] ) and ( [ sinrdl ] ) , it becomes clear that the attainable sinr is proportional to the large - scale fading coefficients @xmath69 , which are different for the @xmath15 users of each cell .",
    "thus , we have to break away from this traditional concept of treating the pc for all users identically , which this motivates our idea of dividing the users of each cell into two groups , namely the group of center users subjected to modest pc and the group of edge users suffering from severe pc .",
    "we will treat them differently .",
    "in fact , the limit of the ul sinr of the @xmath18-th user in the @xmath20-th cell , which is defined by @xmath70 specifies the severity of the pc for this user .",
    "therefore , it is easy to sort the users in a cell according to their sinr values @xmath71 , if all the large - scale fading coefficients @xmath72 are known at the bs , which is a key assumption stipulated in the state - of - the - art contributions  @xcite .",
    "however , in practice , it is difficult for the bs to obtain an accurate estimate of the large - scale fading coefficients of the users in other cells , i.e. , of @xmath73 for @xmath74 , unless bs - cooperation is invoked , which is typically associated with a substantial side - information overhead .",
    "since we have @xmath75 , we may also use @xmath69 for estimating the severity of the pc for the @xmath18-th user roaming in the @xmath20-th cell .",
    "in contrast to @xmath73 for @xmath74 , all the large - scale fading coefficients @xmath76 of the @xmath15 users in the @xmath20-th cell can be readily obtained .",
    "thus , the @xmath15 users in the @xmath20-th cell can be readily divided into two groups according to @xmath77 the user - grouping threshold @xmath78 can be set to @xmath79 where @xmath80 can be adjusted according to the specific system configuration .",
    "a simple case is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ celldivision ] , where according to the large - scale fading coefficients @xmath76 and the given threshold @xmath78 , the users are divided into two groups , namely the center users associated with only a slight pc and the edge users subjected to severe pc .",
    "note that the threshold @xmath78 is not based on the geographic locations of the users - it is rather based on the signal space of @xmath76 .    since the center users only suffer from minor pc , the conventional ls - mimo scheme outlined in the previous section is capable of attaining a high performance .",
    "by contrast , the edge users suffer from serious pilot contamination , hence their performance based on the conventional ls - mimo scheme is expected to be poor . in order to enhance the qos of the edge users , who suffer from heavy pc , we propose the more sophisticated spr scheme and mbd precoding in the following section .",
    "based on the division of users into two groups as outlined in the previous section , it is plausible that the center users indeed benefit from the conventional ls - mimo technique .",
    "by contrast , improved measures have to be considered for enhancing the qos of the edge users , such as our spr and mbd schemes , which will be discussed in detail in the following three subsections : 1 )  the proposed spr scheme ; 2 )  channel estimation based on spr ; and 3 )  the mbd precoding advocated",
    ".      inspired by the ffr scheme , which assigns orthogonal frequency bands to edge users in adjacent cells to prevent serious ici in 3gpp lte release 9 , we propose the srp scheme to mitigate the pc , whereby orthogonal pilot sub - groups are assigned to the edge users in the adjacent cells , while a center pilot group is reused for the center users of all cells .    more specifically , consider a typical ls - mimo system , which is composed of @xmath13 hexagonal cells , where the @xmath20-th cell supports @xmath81 users .",
    "in the conventional ls - mimo scheme @xcite , the number of orthogonal pilot sequences required can be calculated as @xmath82 in contrast to the conventional ls - mimo scheme , where all users are treated identically , the @xmath81 users of the @xmath20-th cell are firstly divided into two groups according to their large - scale fading coefficients @xmath76 , which have cardinalities of @xmath83 where @xmath84 denotes the number of center users , while @xmath85 represents the number of edge users .",
    "thus , the number of orthogonal pilot sequences needed in the proposed spr scheme can be calculated as @xmath86 where @xmath87 denotes the number of pilot sequences assigned to the center users , while @xmath88 denotes the number of pilot sequences dedicated to the edge users .",
    "it should be pointed out that we assume having @xmath13 cooperating cells , thus @xmath13 is a moderate value .",
    "for example , we have @xmath13=7 for the classic seven - cell system .",
    "then the entire set of pilot resources @xmath89 associated with @xmath90 can be divided into @xmath91^t , \\ ] ] where @xmath92 is reused for the center users in all cells and @xmath93 is applied to the edge users of the adjacent cells .",
    "furthermore , @xmath94 can be divided into @xmath13 partitions , as @xmath95^t , \\ ] ] where @xmath96 is applied to the @xmath97 edge users in the @xmath20-th cell .",
    "thus , the pilot sequences applied to edge users are orthogonal to those of the other users roaming in the adjacent cells .    in the example of fig",
    ".  [ intercellchannel ] , there are 3 hexagonal cells associated with @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 users . in order to completely eliminate",
    "the pc would require 15 orthogonal pilot sequences .",
    "it can be readily calculated that we have @xmath101 and @xmath102 for this simple case .",
    "although the proposed spr scheme requires slightly more pilot resources than the conventional scheme , the qos of the edge users can be significantly improved , which will be verified in the following subsections .      by applying the proposed spr scheme",
    ", the bs becomes capable of estimating the channels for its edge users in the absence of pc , since the pilot sequences assigned to the edge users are all orthogonal .",
    "moreover , the bs can also obtain the partial knowledge of the inter - cell channels of the edge users in adjacent cells , which is the dominant source of the ici inflicted upon these edge users of the adjacent cells during the bs s dl transmissions .",
    "specifically , we consider the same ls - mimo system as in subsection  [ s5.1 ] , which is composed of @xmath13 hexagonal cells , where the @xmath20-th cell has @xmath81 users . based on the proposed spr scheme",
    ", we divide the channel matrix @xmath103 as defined in ( [ channeldefine ] ) into two parts @xmath104,\\ ] ] where @xmath105 denotes the channel matrix of the link spanning from the center users in the @xmath19-th cell to the bs in the @xmath20-th cell , while @xmath106 denotes the channel matrix of the link spanning from the edge users in the @xmath19-th cell to the bs in the @xmath20-th cell .",
    "then , the pilot sequence received at the bs of the @xmath20-th cell can be represented by @xmath107 where @xmath108 denotes the sub - matrix comprised of the first @xmath109 rows of @xmath110 , while @xmath111 denotes the corresponding awgn matrix at the ul receiver .",
    "then the bs becomes capable of estimating the channel of its center users as @xmath112 where @xmath113 which can be reduced to an arbitrarily small value by increasing @xmath14 , and @xmath114 denotes the matrix comprised of the first @xmath115 columns of @xmath116 .",
    "note that if we have @xmath117 , then @xmath118 zero vectors are used to fill @xmath114 .",
    "in contrast to the conventional scheme of ( [ eq6 ] ) , the proposed scheme only allows the center users to reuse the same pilot group of @xmath110 , since the pc imposed on these center users is modest .",
    "consequently , the severity of the pc inflicted upon the channel estimation of the center users given in ( [ eq22 ] ) is minor .    on the other hand , by adopting the proposed spr scheme , the bs of the @xmath20-th cell becomes capable of acquiring the channel estimate of its edge users without excessive pc , yielding @xmath119 where we have @xmath120 , which can be made arbitrarily small by increasing the number of antennas at the bs .",
    "it is clear that the pc is completely eliminated for these edge users and , therefore , the channel estimation accuracy of these edge users is significantly enhanced . by contrast , with the conventional scheme , these edge users suffer from grave pc , and hence their channel estimates have extremely poor quality , which severely limits the achievable ul detection performance . with the aid of the proposed spr scheme , the full channel estimate at the bs of the @xmath20-th cell",

    "the inter - cell channel matrix @xmath128 provides important information for the dl transmit precoding design .",
    "armed with its accurate estimate @xmath129 , the bs of the @xmath20-th cell will be able to beneficially preprocess its transmissions for the sake of reducing the ici inflicted upon its neighbouring edge users roaming in the adjacent cells , which is the topic of the next subsection .      by selecting the tpc vector for a specific user from the null space spanned by the channels of other users , the classical bd tpc scheme @xcite adopted in single - cell multi - user mimo systems is capable of eliminating the multi - user interference .",

    "similarly , by projecting the conventional zf transmit precoding matrix onto the null space @xmath156 , we can generate the zf based mbd matrix as @xmath157 where the normalization factor @xmath158 is calculated as @xmath159    both the precoding matrices @xmath160 and @xmath161 are capable of eliminating the ici imposed on the edge users of the adjacent cells .",
    "an illustrative example is depicted in fig .",
    "[ nullspaceprecoding ] , where based on the proposed spr scheme , the bs becomes capable of estimating the partial inter - cell channels of the edge users roaming in the adjacent cells .",
    "the mbd tpc then projects the dl transmission signal onto the null space of the partial inter - cell channels in order to eliminate the ici contaminating the reception of these edge users in the adjacent cells .",
    "therefore , the mbd tpc significantly increases the dl achievable rate of edge users , and consequently the qos of edge users is considerably enhanced .",
    "before we investigate the performance of the proposed spr and mbd schemes , we first discuss the amount of pilot resources required , then derive both the ul as well as the dl achievable rate , and finally consider the computational complexity imposed .      as seen in ( [ kcs ] ) , the conventional scheme requires @xmath162 number of orthogonal pilot sequences and it suffers from grave pc . again , in order to eliminate the pc caused by the reuse of the same pilot group in adjacent cells , the most plausible solution is to apply orthogonal pilot sequences to all users in all cells .",
    "however , the number of orthogonal pilot sequences would be increased to @xmath163 which leads to a substantial spectral efficiency reduction .",
    "recall that the proposed spr and mbd schemes are capable of enhancing the qos for edge users at the expense of a slightly increased number of pilot resources . more specifically , by comparing ( [ kcs ] ) and",
    "( [ kspr ] ) , the additional pilot resources required by the proposed spr scheme can be derived as @xmath164 where @xmath165 denotes the index of the cell which has the most users , i.e. , @xmath166 .",
    "it is clear that the additional number of pilot sequences is close to the total number of the edge users .",
    "since the edge users are classified according to the threshold @xmath78 , which can be adjusted by the parameter @xmath80 , the number of edge users can be flexibly adjusted too .",
    "more explicitly , the careful choice of the parameter @xmath80 provides a flexible trade - off between the pilot resources required and the achievable system performance of the proposed spr scheme .",
    "at one extreme end , when the parameter @xmath80 is set to 0 , all the users will be regarded as edge users and the proposed spr scheme becomes equivalent to the orthogonal scheme , where all users in all cells use orthogonal pilot sequences .",
    "naturally , this achieves the best performance but relies on the most pilot resources , requiring @xmath167 orthogonal pilot sequences . at the other extreme ,",
    "when the parameter @xmath80 is set to a sufficiently large value , e.g. @xmath168 , then all users are regarded as center users and the proposed spr scheme degrades to the conventional scheme that reuses the same pilot group in all cells .",
    "hence the resultant arrangement attains the worst performance but consumes the minimum pilot resources , hence requiring only @xmath169 orthogonal pilot sequences .      for the center users , the average sinr performance of spr - aided ul transmission becomes almost the same as that of applying the conventional scheme .",
    "this is because for the center users in a cell , the estimated channel matrix of ( [ eq6 ] ) obtained by applying the conventional scheme is very similar to that of ( [ eq22 ] ) obtained by applying the spr scheme .",

    "the performance of ul transmission for the edge users is much more complex , as seen below .",

    "our contribution is twofold .",
    "firstly , we break away from the traditional practice of treating all users as though they suffer from the same level of pc , and propose a simple yet effective means of dividing the users into cell - center and cell - edge users .",
    "this grouping allows us to apply the proposed spr scheme , whereby a center pilot group is reused for the center users in all cells , while the edge pilot group is applied to the edge users in the adjacent cells . by requiring a slightly increased number of pilot sequences ,",
    "the proposed spr scheme eliminates the pilot contamination inflicted upon the edge users who would otherwise suffer from severe pc in the conventional scheme .",
    "this significantly enhances the qos for the edge users , meanwhile ensures both the average ul and dl cell throughput with slight and negligible reduction compared with that of the conventional system .",
    "secondly , we further exploit the fact that the bs becomes capable of estimating the inter - cell channels of the edge users in the adjacent cells with the aid of the our spr regime without the deliterious effects of pc . finally , we extend the classical bd precoding to a multi - cell scenario and propose the mbd precoding to eliminate the ici imposed on the edge users of the adjacent cells in the dl .",

    "<S> based on this distinction , the spr scheme is proposed for improving the qos for the edge users , whereby a cell - center pilot group is reused for all cell - center users in all cells , while a cell - edge pilot group is applied for the edge users in the adjacent cells . by extending the classical block diagonalization precoding to a multi - cell scenario , the mbd precoding scheme projects the downlink transmit signal onto the null space of the subspace spanned by the inter - cell channels of the edge users in adjacent cells . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the inter - cell interference contaminating the edge users signals in the adjacent cells can be efficiently mitigated and hence the qos of these edge users can be further enhanced . our theoretical analysis and </S>",
    "<S> simulation results demonstrate that both the uplink and downlink rates of the edge users are significantly improved , albeit at the cost of the slightly decreased rate of center users .    </S>",
