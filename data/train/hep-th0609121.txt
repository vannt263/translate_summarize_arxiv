    "these formulae presents the intensities as sums over the modes of the dielectric waveguide .",
    "however , as the corresponding eigenmodes are not explicitly known , this form is not convenient for the numerical evaluation of the radiation intensity . in appendix , by using the generalized abel - plana formula , we derive a summation formula for the series over the normal modes of the dielectric cylinder which allows to extract from the radiation intensity the parts corresponding to the radiation in a homogeneous medium and to present the inhomogeneity - induced part in terms of exponentially converging integrals . unlike to the parts corresponding to the homogeneous medium , the terms induced by the presence of the cylinder are finite also in the case when the dispersion is absent .",
    "we have specified the condition under which the influence of dispersion on the inhomogeneity - induced effects can be neglected .",
