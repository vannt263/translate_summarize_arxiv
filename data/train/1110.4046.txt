    "even though the evolutionary variable is discretized by a standard crank - nicolson method , the error analysis presented in this section is non - standard .",
    "this is due mainly to the fact that the form and the projection used are @xmath14-dependent and calculated at the mid - points of a uniform range partition .",

    "a general complex elliptic boundary value problem posed on a two - dimensional rectangular domain with mixed boundary conditions is analyzed in section 4 . if dirichlet or neumann conditions hold along the boundary , then in the weak formulation of the boundary value problem the trace integral terms vanish .",
    "a general approach of proving global regularity , @xcite , is to prove this estimate for half - balls , and then by change of variables , stretch the compact boundary locally and cover it by a finite union of half - balls . in our case , we analyze a complex elliptic problem posed on a rectangular domain of @xmath79 .",
    "the boundary is compact and consists of four linear segments along which dirichlet and robin conditions are imposed .",
    "we apply directly on this domain the half - balls technique without change of variables as the boundary is already stretched locally .",
    "further , we define appropriate test functions , in order to eliminate the trace terms from the weak formulation of the problem and prove the regularity estimate in theorem [ 3.2.9 ] .",
