    "most known interstellar molecules have been detected in the millimeter wavelength range .",
    "this is clearly related to the fact that , in general , the simplest and hence the lightest molecules are the most abundant cosmic molecular species .",
    "their strongest rotational lines at the temperatures characteristic of the molecular interstellar medium arise at mm and submm wavelengths .",
    "heavier molecules , often with large permanent dipole moments , have detectable rotational lines at lower frequencies in the microwave range .",
    "transitions between low energy levels are more favorable in terms of line intensities , especially in regions of low or modest density and low temperature .",
    "the latter include , in particular , the inner parts of dark clouds , which are among the coldest regions of the interstellar medium , because they have no internal energy sources and are shielded from external sources of radiation by their own gas and dust .",
    "another reason why observations at low frequencies are needed is the fact that the line intensities of molecules having fractional abundance below approximately @xmath11 relative to h@xmath1 fall below the confusion level in the millimeter wavelength range . in such cases , sensitive observations at low frequencies , which are less `` contaminated '' by the emission of simple molecules ,",
    "in addition , hyperfine splitting is often negligible at high frequencies , but detectable at low frequencies ( e.g. for species hc@xmath2n , hc@xmath6n , etc . ) .",
    "hyperfine splitting may be used to determine line opacities and thus to obtain more accurate molecular column densities and abundances .",
    "spectral scans , covering wide ranges of frequencies , are powerful tools for molecular searches .",
    "typically many lines of the same molecule fall within the observed spectral window , making it possible to more reliably identify observed spectral features .",
    "a number of spectral scans of molecular clouds have so far been carried out in atmospheric windows between 17  ghz and 700  ghz .",
    "a selection of the frequency ranges covered and references are 17.622 ghz @xcite ; 72144 ghz @xcite ; 330360 ghz @xcite ; 455507 ghz , @xcite ; 607725 ghz , @xcite ; 780900 ghz , @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite carried out a spectral scan of the dark cloud tmc-1 in the frequency range between 8.8 and 50 ghz .",
    "however , no spectral scan has been performed at frequencies below 8.8  ghz .",
    "therefore we undertook a spectral survey of tmc-1 at 46 ghz .",
    "this is the lowest frequency spectral survey carried out toward a molecular cloud .",
    "tmc-1 has a shape of a ridge elongated in the northwest - southeast direction .",
    "the structure and chemical composition of tmc-1 have been studied by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the temperature of this object is about 10  k , which is typical for dark clouds ; the h@xmath1 density estimates towards the `` cyanopolyyne peak '' ( see below ) vary between @xmath12  @xmath13 @xcite and @xmath14  @xmath13 @xcite . the study by peng et al .",
    "( 1998 ) revealed 45 clumps which are grouped into 3 cylindrical features oriented along the ridge .",
    "the lsr velocities of these features are approximately 5.7 , 5.9 , and 6.1  km  s@xmath15 .",
    "tmc-1 has proven to be an excellent object for the study of chemistry in dark clouds under quiescent conditions .",
    "it shows a carbon  rich chemistry with chemical gradients across the densest part of the ridge extending over 0.2 pc x 0.6 pc .",
    "the most prominent chemical feature of tmc-1 is the high abundance of various carbon  chain molecules , such as cyanopolyynes hc@xmath16n and radicals c@xmath17h .",
    "the peak position of the line intensities of cyanopolyynes ( the cyanopolyyne peak ) was found to be located @xmath18 southeast from another prominent position in tmc-1 , the peak of the ammonia line emission .",
    "the heaviest known interstellar molecule , hc@xmath19n , as well as a number of other heavy molecules have been found exactly towards the cyanopolyyne peak , making it an especially interesting object for observations at low frequencies .",
    "the observations were performed with the 305-m radio telescope of the arecibo observatory . the entire arecibo c - band ( 46  ghz ) was observed towards the cyanopolyyne peak position ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) .",
    "the c - band observations were performed in total power mode which is effective as a result of the excellent system stability , and which maximizes the signal to noise ratio .",
    "two senses of linear polarization were independently observed and the two outputs averaged together .",
    "the four correlator boards of the spectrometer were offset in frequency by 5.25  mhz , and each was set to a bandwidth of 6.25  mhz , thus yielding an instantaneous continuous frequency coverage of 21  mhz with a frequency resolution of 3  khz ( 0.183 km  s@xmath15 at 5  ghz ) .",
    "each frequency setup was observed for 5 minutes .",
    "the entire c - band was observed 3 times , with one observation shifted by 3  mhz , yielding an rms sensitivity of about 1718 mk ( about 22.3  mjy ) .",
    "in addition , a number of selected frequency ranges within the c - band and x - band ( 810  ghz ) were observed with longer integration times and rms sensitivities 78 mk or higher .",
    "the x - band observations were performed in two senses of circular polarization .",
    "the beam size was about @xmath22 in c - band and about @xmath23 in x - band .",
    "the gain was about 8 k / jy in c - band and about 4  k / jy in x - band .",
    "the frequency ranges were centered at the frequencies of different molecular transitions taken from the jpl catalog of line positions and intensities ( http://spec.jpl.nasa.gov/ftp/pub/catalog/catform.html ) and the cologne database for molecular spectroscopy ( http://www.ph1.uni-koeln.de/vorhersagen/ ) , as well as from the catalog of known molecular lines by f.  lovas ( http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/micro/table5/start.pl ) .",
    "each scan of the total power observations consisted of 50 6second on source observations followed by two 10second calibration scans .",
    "the first of these calibration scans was taken with a noise diode switched on , and the second with the noise diode off .",
    "the data were calibrated by dividing the on source spectra by the calibration spectra ; the latter were calculated as the difference of the two calibration signal scans . to optimize the accuracy of the calibration while minimizing the effect of noise in the calibration scans , the calibration scans were approximated by polynomials of order 20 to 29 .",
    "polynomoials of low order ( up to 3 ) were applied to remove residual baselines from the calibrated spectra . both the calibration and subsequent data reduction were performed with the class software package .",
    "lines with resolved hyperfine structure ( i.e. , when the hyperfine components are presented as different entries in table  [ gauss ] ) were fitted using the standard class method hfs .",
    "this method enables us to derive the optical depth of the strongest component from the relative intensities of the observed components assuming that the excitation temperatures , lsr velocities , and linewidths of individual components are the same .",
    "tmc-1 has a very narrow lines of less than 0.4  km  s@xmath15 width . in order to achieve high velocity resolution of 0.18  km  s@xmath15 with the available number of spectrometer channels the entire band of 46  ghz was divided into 381 spectra .",
    "a portion of one of the c  band spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "[ scan ] . as a result of the spectral scan itself",
    ", we detected only lines of h@xmath1co and hc@xmath2n .",
    "however , in more sensitive observations at selected frequencies in c and x  bands we detected lines of c@xmath1s , c@xmath3s , c@xmath4h , c@xmath4h@xmath1 , hc@xmath3n and its @xmath5c substituted isotopic species , hc@xmath2n , hc@xmath6n , and hc@xmath7n .",
    "the @xmath24 line of hc@xmath6n and all lines of hc@xmath7n , c@xmath4h@xmath1 , ccs , and c@xmath3s are new , i.e. , they were not included in the catalog of known interstellar lines by f.  lovas at the time of writing this paper .",
    "the list of the detected lines with their fitted gaussian parameters is presented in table  [ gauss ] .",
    "most of our results were analysed with rotational diagrams . to construct rotational diagrams , we derived a rotational level population from the total intensity of relevant hyperfine components .    for optically thin emission , the integrated line intensity , @xmath25 ( k cm s@xmath26 ,",
    "is related to the upper level column density @xmath27 by the well - known relation :    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is the line strength , @xmath30 is the permanent electric dipole moment , and @xmath31^{-1}$ ] . at low frequencies , where @xmath32 , @xmath33 is approximately equal to @xmath34 .",
    "@xmath35 and @xmath36 are the excitation temperature and the background brightness temperature , respectively .",
    "if @xmath37 , the term @xmath38/[j(\\nu , t_{ex } ) - j(\\nu , t_{bg})]$ ] approaches unity . in this case , assuming lte and applying boltzmann s equation , one can obtain from eq .",
    "( 1 ) :    @xmath39    where @xmath40 is the energy of the upper level of the transition , @xmath41 is the partition function , and @xmath42 is the excitation temperature characterizing the rotational transitions of interest . using eq . ( 2 ) , one can obtain the total molecular column density @xmath43 and rotational temperature @xmath42 from observations of several lines of the same molecule .",
    "however , in the case of hc@xmath2n and some other molecules the rotational temperature is fairly low ; hence , the assumption @xmath44 is not valid , and the term @xmath38/[j(\\nu , t_{ex } ) - j(\\nu , t_{bg})]$ ] must be taken into account .",
    "therefore we derived @xmath43 and @xmath42 applying the following iterative approach :    1 .",
    "determination of `` initial guesses '' of @xmath42 and @xmath43 from eq .",
    "( 2 ) 2 .",

    "the calculated rotational temperatures and column densities are given in table  [ trot ]    for c@xmath4h and c@xmath4h@xmath1 , no rotational diagrams were constructed .",
    "to estimate column densities of these species , we assumed that the energy level populations are thermalized at a temperature taken from the literature and presented in table  [ trot ] .",
    "first , the optical depths of the observed lines were determined from the relation @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the main beam brightness temperature .",
    "then , using the prescription from the secton `` intensity units and conventions '' of the jpl catalog documentation ( http://spec.jpl.nasa.gov/ftp/pub/catalog/doc/catdoc.pdf ) absorption coefficients per molecule per km  s@xmath15 , @xmath48 , were found .",
    "column densities @xmath43 were obtained using the relation @xmath49 .",
    "the same technique was applied to obtain the upper limits to the column density presented in table  [ neg ] .",
    "the spectra of the @xmath50 hc@xmath3n emission are shown in fig  [ hc3n ] .",
    "one sees a complex line profile , already found in a number of other molecular lines , and explained in terms of the existence of small - scale structure in tmc-1 @xcite . following @xcite ,",
    "who distinguished three main kinematic components towards tmc-1 , we approximated the hyperfine ",
    "split line by a sum of three kinematic components with their intensities , lsr velocities , and linewidths free .",
    "the lsr velocities of the components proved to be 5.69 , 5.85 , and 6.06  km  s@xmath15 , which are approximately coincident with the velocity components determined by peng et al . and by dickens et al .",
    "a very limited number of offset measurements were performed which showed that ( 1 ) the peak of the 5.69  km  s@xmath15 emission is located approximately 40 arcsec south ; ( 2 ) the peak of the 5.85  km  s@xmath15 emission is located approximately 30 arcsec southeast ; and ( 3 ) the peak of the 6.06  km  s@xmath15 emission is located approximately 40 arcsec north of the nominal position . however , both the extent and the sampling of our `` map '' are insufficient to determine the spatial distribution of the hc@xmath3n emission .",
    "the optical depth of the main hyperfine component is fairly small ( about 0.2 for the 5.69 and 5.85  km  s@xmath15 components ) ; however , it is in agreement with optical depths about unity for the higher frequency transitions reported by , e.g. ,  @xcite",
    ". therefore , simple methods of analysis , such as rotation diagrams , are not adequate ( the formal use of the basic rotation diagram method yields a rotational temperature of 2 k ) , and a statistical equilibrium ( se ) analysis which allows for effects of finite optical depth should be used ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in addition to the main species , we detected the @xmath51 hcc@xmath5cn emission and marginally detected two other @xmath5c substituted isotopomers , hc@xmath5ccn and h@xmath5cccn .",
    "the weakness of the lines of the @xmath5c  subsituted species did not allow us to measure reliably the isotopic abundance ratios , but the results seem to be in a qualitative agreement with the previous results of @xcite , obtained from the observations of the @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 lines at higher frequencies , i.e. , the hcc@xmath5cn emission is the strongest and the hc@xmath5ccn and h@xmath5cccn emission is weaker by a factor of 1.3 .",
    "the ratio of the hc@xmath3n / hcc@xmath5cn line intensities , @xmath55 is also in agreement with the ratio of hc@xmath3n / hcc@xmath5cn abundances of 55 found by takano et al . , indicating a small optical depth for the lines observed using arecibo .",
    "we detected @xmath56 emission of hc@xmath2n ( fig .  [ cyanop ] ) .",
    "the ratio between the intensities of different hyperfine components corresponds to lte with small optical depth . combining our line intensity with the intensities of different lines of hc@xmath2n published by @xcite , in a rotational diagram ( fig .",
    "[ rot ] ) we derive a hc@xmath2n rotational temperature of 4.3  k , in agreement with e.g. , @xcite , and a column density of @xmath8 @xmath9 .",
    "the @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 lines were observed and spectra are shown in fig .",
    "the rotation diagram ( fig .",
    "[ rot ] ) was constructed assuming hc@xmath6n source size of @xmath60  @xcite , and yields a rotational temperature of 7.7  k and a hc@xmath6n column density of @xmath61  @xmath9 .",
    "we detected the @xmath62 and @xmath63 transitions of hc@xmath7n , and marginally detected the @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 lines .",
    "the @xmath67 line was not found because of the weakness of the rotational transition and its hyperfine splitting ( fig .",
    "[ hc9n ] ) .",
    "rotational diagrams were constructed assuming a source size equal to @xmath60 ( fig .",
    "[ rot ] , upper right ) and @xmath68 , suggested by @xcite ( fig .  [ rot ] , lower right ) .",
    "one can see that the best fit to our data is obtained for the former source size .",
    "thus , we derived a rotational temperature equal to 8.4  k and a hc@xmath7n column density equal to @xmath10  @xmath9 .    our results on cyanopolyyne rotational temperatures are in agreement with the previous results by @xcite , who found that the rotational temperatures of the cyanopolyynes increase with the number of heavy atoms over the range hc@xmath2n  hc@xmath7n and explained this effect in terms of less efficient radiative decay in the longer cyanopolyyne chains .",
    "an unexpected result is the weakness of the tentatively detected @xmath69 line of ccs at 5402.6  mhz relative to the 10 line of c@xmath3s at 5780.8  mhz ( fig .",
    "[ other ] ) .",
    "the ccs abundance is higher by an order of magnitude @xcite , and usually ccs lines are much stronger than c@xmath3s lines at approximately the same frequencies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the ccs line is intrinsically weaker than the c@xmath3s line ( @xmath70 for the c@xmath3s line and only 6.71 for the ccs line ) .",
    "the relevant rotational diagram ( fig .",
    "[ rot ] ) yields a rotational temperature of 5.7  k and a ccs column density of @xmath71  @xmath9 , which is in good agreement with that derived by means of a lvg analysis by @xcite .",
    "we derived the c@xmath3s column density from lvg calculations , assuming @xmath72  k and n@xmath73  @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "our value , @xmath74  @xmath9 , is in good agreement with that derived by fuente et al .",
    "thus , the weakness of the @xmath75 line of ccs is a consequence of its intrinsic weakness , the high location of its energy levels ( @xmath76 equals 10.84  k for the @xmath77 ccs level ) , and the fairly low rotational temperature of ccs .",
    "we detected a strong @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 transition of c@xmath4h ( fig .",
    "[ hc3n ] ) , already observed in tmc-1 by bell et al .",
    "( 1982 , 1983 ) .",
    "the arecibo line is narrow as a result of the weakness of the 6.06  km  s@xmath15 component towards the observed position .",
    "since this component is fairly strong in the @xmath81 line of hc@xmath3n , our data suggest that there is a difference between the small scale ( about @xmath82 ) distributions of hc@xmath3n and c@xmath4h .",
    "note that the same c@xmath4h line , observed with a much larger @xmath83 beam ( see fig .  2 in @xcite ) , is broader , having a width of about 0.4  km  @xmath84 , which is typical of tmc1 .",
    "we believe that the detection of the @xmath85 para - c@xmath4h@xmath1 line is real , since the c@xmath4h@xmath1 column density ( derived from the line intensity under the assumptions that the c@xmath4h@xmath1 rotational temperature is 4.2  k and the ortho - to - para ratio is 4.2 @xcite ) is equal to @xmath86  @xmath9 , which is comparable to , but somewhat smaller than , the value of @xmath87  @xmath9 derived by kawaguchi et al .",
    "the @xmath88 h@xmath1co line , detected using arecibo ( fig .  [ scan ] ; table  [ gauss ] ) is rather similar but not identical to that observed previously by e.g. , @xcite with a @xmath89 beam .",
    "the relative intensities of hyperfine components yielded the optical depth of the main component to be 1.6 and the line excitation temperature to be 1.2  k. no @xmath88 h@xmath90co and h@xmath1c@xmath91o lines were detected .",
    "we estimate the lower limits to the ratios of the @xmath92 level populations for h@xmath1co / h@xmath90co and h@xmath1co / h@xmath1c@xmath91o assuming equal excitation temperatures for the @xmath88 transition of all isotopic species .",
    "the limits are 24 and 76 , which are below the @xmath93c/@xmath5c and @xmath94o/@xmath91o abundance ratios by factors of approximately 3 and 6 , respectively .",
    "thus , the non  detection of the @xmath88 h@xmath90co and h@xmath1c@xmath91o lines does not contradict to the known values of the @xmath93c/@xmath5c and @xmath94o/@xmath91o abundance ratios .",
    "table  [ neg ] presents the upper limits to the antenna temperatures of observed but undetected lines together with the relevant column density limits .",
    "the column density limits were calculated from eq.(1 ) under the assumption that the line populations are thermalized at 10  k. most of the molecular species from table  [ neg ] have already been found in tmc-1 at higher frequencies .",
    "comparison of the published column densities with the upper limits in table  [ neg ] shows that an increase in sensitivity by a factor of 25 could lead to the detection of a much larger number of molecular lines .",
    "thus , molecular observations at low frequencies ( 410 ghz ) may be useful for studying dark clouds if the sensitivity ( at @xmath95 level ) is about 510 mk or better .",
    "we did not estimate h@xmath90co and h@xmath1c@xmath91o column densities because of well - known strong deviations from lte of the level populations of these species .",
    "note that some other molecules may remain undetected in dark clouds due to excitation particularities rather than low abundances .",
    "for instance , ch@xmath1nh was not detected in tmc-1 and l134 by @xcite ; they suggested that it may be an excitation effect , since the observed transitions have critical densities of about @xmath96  @xmath13 , which is well below the density of tmc-1 .",
    "our non  detection of the @xmath88 ch@xmath1nh emission line is probably a result of the @xmath97 transition at 167.4  ghz ( @xmath98  cm@xmath15 ) , which can radiatively depopulate the @xmath92 level at the moderate densities found in tmc-1 .",
    "the results of the lowest frequency spectral survey carried out toward a dark cloud , studying tmc-1 in the 46 ghz range using the arecibo radio telescope , and those from sensitive observations at selected frequencies in c and x  bands can be summarized as follows :    * a number of molecular lines were detected .",
    "the majority of the detected lines belong to the cyanopolyynes hc@xmath3n , hc@xmath2n , hc@xmath6n , and hc@xmath7n . *",
    "the rotational temperatures of the detected molecules fall in the range 49 k. cyanopolyyne column densities vary from @xmath8  @xmath9 for hc@xmath2n to @xmath10  @xmath9 for hc@xmath7n .",
    "* molecular observations at low frequencies ( 410 ghz ) can be useful for studying dark clouds , but to be really effective , the sensitivity must be increased by a factor of 2 to 3 . to date , observations at around 10  ghz have been more fruitful than those at lower frequencies .",
    "the national astronomy and ionosphere center is operated by cornell university under a cooperative agreement with the national science foundation .",
