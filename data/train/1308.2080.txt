    "<S> however , for sufficiently high carrier densities ( @xmath65@xmath54 ) coulomb assisted processes prevail even at large detuning and lead to a significant cavity feeding that is one order of magnitude stronger in comparison to the jc coupling alone . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , there is a pronounced asymmetry between positive and negative detuning for low temperature . </S>",
    "<S> this is expected , since any thermal bath favors the process which lowers the system energy , all the more so at low temperatures .    </S>",

    "<S> for identical electron and hole wave functions the exciton is not only globally but also _ locally _ neutral and there is no electrostatic interaction between the exciton and the wl carriers . </S>",

    "<S> this is made obvious in eqs  ( [ eq : we]),([eq : wh ] ) , where the integrals become @xmath66-independent and the direct terms cancel out . </S>",
    "<S> thus only the typically much smaller exchange ( fock ) integrals remain . </S>",
    "<S> this points to an intrinsic difference between interband cavity assisted feeding and intraband scattering processes : in the latter case electrons and holes can scatter independently , while in the former case the emission of a photon requires the presence of an exciton , i.e. , a fully correlated electron - hole pair . as a consequence </S>",
    "<S> any formalism describing the off - resonant cavity feeding , which relies on an interaction of coulombian origin , like qd - wl auger interaction , or frhlich interaction of qd carriers with lo phonons , must obey the following local neutrality condition : _ for locally neutral excitons and discarding the exchange terms the off - resonant process should vanish exactly_. so far , we have presented results based on an approximate , perturbative diagonalization of the jc interaction part of the hamiltonian . as an alternative approach , </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a non - perturbative treatment of the coulomb interaction between qd excitons and wl carriers by using a suitable unitary transform . </S>",
    "<S> the idea is in many ways similar to the polaron transform of the ibm . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of the exciton generates an external field to which the lattice ions react by displacements of their oscillation centers . </S>",
    "<S> the polaronic transform connects the distorted lattice with the original one . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , in the present case the exciton perturbs the wl - carrier system by an external field term @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> the source of this field is localized around the qd , which thus acts as a scattering center for the continuum of extended wl states . </S>",

    "<S> the exciton renormalization should be considerably smaller in comparison to the sum of independently broadened electron and hole energies . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : mean_ren ] we show how artificially uncorrelated electrons and holes would influence the cavity feeding . to this end </S>",
    "<S> we introduce an additional renormalization to the qd exciton energy in eq .   by replacing @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the sum of the independently broadened electron and hole energies . </S>",
    "<S> it is seen that by increasing the total broadening @xmath89 the off - resonant cavity feeding gains substantially . being an artifact , this result underscores the need for the correct treatment of correlations between the electron and hole , which reduce the efficiency of interband transitions assisted by wetting layer carriers .    in conclusion , for the off - resonant coupling between qd emitters and optical cavity modes , the auger - like recombination assisted by wl carriers has been identified as a possible cavity feeding channel . </S>",
    "<S> it coexists with other processes like phonon - assisted recombination , which is only efficient for small detuning , or multi - exciton effects , which require qds with several shells . for large carrier densities in the delocalized states , </S>",

    "<S> the off - resonant coupling of qd emitters has profound implications for the description and characterization of qd microcavity lasers , where a small number of close to resonant emitters are accompanied by many far - detuned emitters . </S>",
    "<S> their background emission can enhance the photon production rate sufficiently to result in a reduced laser threshold and modified photon statistics . </S>",
