    "the prediction of the new phenomenon of the anderson localization anderson has strongly stimulated both theoretical and experimental study of disordered materials .",
    "this work demonstrates the extraordinary intuition of the author that allowed him to make outstanding predictions . at the same time",
    ", one could see from that work that quantitative description of the disordered systems was not a simple task and many conclusions were based on semi - qualitative arguments .",
    "although many interesting effects have been predicted in this way , development of theoretical methods for quantitative study of quantum effects in disordered systems was clearly very demanding .",
    "the most straightforward way to take into account disorder is using perturbation theory in the strength of the disorder potential @xcite .",
    "however , the phenomenon of the localization is not easily seen within this method and the conventional classical drude formula for conductivity was considered in @xcite as the final result for the dimensionality @xmath1 .",
    "this result is obtained after summation of diagrams without intersection of impurity lines .",
    "diagrams with intersection of the impurity lines give a small contribution if the disorder potential is not strong , so that @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the energy of the particles ( fermi energy in metals ) and @xmath4 in the elastic scattering time .    although there was a clear understanding that the diagrams with the intersection of the impurity lines were not small for one dimensional chains , @xmath5 , performing explicit calculations for those systems was difficult .",
    "this step has been done considerably later by berezinsky @xcite who demonstrated localization of all states in @xmath6 chains by summing complicated series of the perturbation theory . this result confirmed the conclusion of mott and twose @xcite about the localization in such systems made previously .",
    "as concerns the higher dimensional systems , @xmath1 , the anderson transition was expected at a strong disorder but it was clear that the perturbation theory could not be applied in that case .",
    "so , the classical drude theory was considered as a justified way of the description of disordered metals in @xmath1 and @xmath7 . at the same time , several results for disordered systems could not be understood within this simple generally accepted picture .    in 1965",
    "gorkov and eliashberg @xcite suggested a description of level statistics in small disordered metal particles using the random matrix theory ( rmt ) of wigner - dyson @xcite . at first glance , the diagrammatic method of ref .",
    "@xcite had to work for such a system but one could not see any indication on how the formulae of rmt could be obtained diagrammatically . of course , the description of ref .",
    "@xcite was merely a hypothesis and the rmt had not been used in the condensed matter before but nowadays it looks rather strange that this problem did not attract an attention .    the prediction of localization in thick wires for any disorder made by thouless @xcite could not be understood in terms of the traditional summing of the diagrams either but , again , there was no attempt to clarify this disagreement .",
    "apparently , the diagrammatic methods were not very widely used in that time and therefore not so many people were interested in resolving such problems .",
    "actually , the discrepancies were not discussed in the literature until 1979 , the year when the celebrated work by abrahams et al .",
    "@xcite appeared . in this work ,",
    "localization of all states for any disorder already in @xmath8 was predicted .",
    "this striking result has attracted so much attention that it was simply unavoidable that people started thinking about how to confirm it diagrammatically .",
    "the only possibility could be that there were some diverging quantum corrections to the classical conductivity and soon the mechanism of such divergencies has been discovered @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the sum of a certain class of the diagrams with intersecting impurity lines diverges in the limit of small frequencies @xmath9 in a low dimension @xmath10 .",
    "this happens for any weak disorder and is a general phenomenon .",
    "the corresponding contribution is represented in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .    the ladder in this diagram can be considered as an effective mode usually called now cooperon \" .",
    "this mode has a form of the diffusion propagator and its contribution to the conductivity @xmath11 can be written in the form@xmath12 where @xmath13 is the classical diffusion coefficient and @xmath14 is the classical conductivity .",
    "the parameters @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the fermi velocity and density of states on the fermi surface .",
    "similar contributions arise also in other quantities .",
    "( [ a1 ] ) demonstrates that in the dimensions @xmath17 the correction to conductivity diverges in the limit @xmath18 .",
    "it is very important that the dimension is determined by the geometry of the sample . in this sense",
    ", small disordered particles correspond to zero dimensionality , @xmath19 and wires to @xmath5 .",
    "the contribution coming from the diffusion mode , eq . ( [ a1 ] ) , is conceptually very important because it demonstrates that the traditional summation of the diagrams without the intersection of the impurity lines is not necessarily applicable in low dimensionality .",
    "one can see that most important contributions come from the diffusion modes that are obtained by summation of infinite series of diagrams containing electron green functions .    the cooperon contribution , eq .",
    "( [ a1 ] ) , has a simple physical meaning .",
    "it is proportional to the probability for a scattered electron wave to come back and interfere with itself @xcite .",
    "the interference implies the quantum coherence and this condition is achieved at low temperatures .",
    "there are many interesting effects related to this phenomenon but discussion of these effects and experiments is beyond the scope of this chapter .",
    "it is also relevant to mention that the cooperon contribution is cut by an external magnetic field , which leads to a negative magnetoresistance @xcite . at the same time",
    ", higher order contributions can still diverge in the limit @xmath20 and these divergencies are not avoidable provided the coherence is not lost due to , e.g. , inelastic processes .    in this way",
    ", one can reconcile the hypothesis about the wigner - dyson level statistics in disordered metal particles and assertion about the localization in thick wires and @xmath8 films with the perturbation theory in the disorder potential .",
    "the divergences due to the contribution of the diffusion modes make the perturbation theory inapplicable in the limit @xmath9 and therefore one does not obtain just the classical conductivity using this approach . of course , summing the divergent quantum corrections is not sufficient to prove the localization in the low dimensional systems and one should use additional assumptions in order to confirm the statements . usually , the perturbation theory is supplemented by the scaling hypothesis @xcite in order to make such far going conclusions .    at the same time , the divergence of the quantum corrections to the conductivity makes the direct analytical consideration very difficult for small @xmath21 because even the summation of all orders of the perturbation theory does not necessarily lead to the correct result . for example , the formulae for the level - level correlation functions @xcite contain oscillating parts that can not be obtained in any order of the perturbation theory .",
    "all this meant that a better tool had to be invented for studying the localization phenomena and quantum level statistics . analyzing the perturbation theory one could guess that a low energy theory explicitly describing the diffusion modes rather than single electrons might be an adequate method .",
    "the first formulation of such a theory was proposed by wegner @xcite ( actually , almost simultaneously with ref .",
    "he expressed the electron green functions in terms of functional integrals over conventional complex numbers @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the coordinate , and averaged over the disorder using the replica trick .",
    "then , decoupling the effective interaction by an auxiliary matrix field @xmath24 he was able to integrate over the field @xmath22 and represent physical quantities of interest in terms of a functional integral over the @xmath25 matrices @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the number of replicas that had to be put to zero at the end of the calculations .",
    "assuming that the disorder is weak the integral over the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath24 was calculated using the saddle point approximation .    as a result , a field theory in a form of a so called @xmath28-model was obtained . working with this model one has to integrate over @xmath25 matrices @xmath24 obeying the constraint @xmath29 .",
    "the @xmath28-model is renormalizable and renormalization group equations were written in ref .",
    "these equations agreed with the perturbation theory of eq .",
    "( a1 ) and with the scaling hypothesis of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "however , the saddle point approximation was not carefully worked out inwegner because the saddle points were in the complex plane , while the original integration had to be done over the real axis .",
    "this question was addressed in the subsequent publications @xcite .    in the work @xcite , the initial derivation of ref .",
    "@xcite was done more carefully shifting the contours of the integration into the complex plane properly . in this way",
    ", one could reach the saddle point and integrate over the eigenvalues of matrix @xmath24 coming to the constraint @xmath29 . after calculating this integral one",
    "is left with the integration over @xmath24 that can be written as @xmath30where @xmath31 is an @xmath32 pseudo - orthogonal or pseudo - unitary matrix .",
    "this matrices vary on a hyperboloid , which corresponds to a noncompact group of the rotations .",
    "this group is quite unusual for statistical physics .",
    "in contrast , the method of @xcite was based on representing the electron green functions in a form of functional integrals over anticommuting grassmann variables and the use of the replica trick .",
    "one could average over the disorder as well and further decouple the effective interaction by a gaussian integration over @xmath24 .",
    "the integration over the anticommuting variables leads to an integral over @xmath24 .",
    "the integral over the eigenvalues of @xmath24 can be calculated using , again , the saddle point method , while the saddle points are now on the real axis . as a result , one comes to a @xmath28-model with @xmath24-fields of the form of eq .",
    "( [ a2 ] ) .",
    "however , now one obtains @xmath32 matrices @xmath31 varying on a sphere and the group of the rotations is compact .",
    "the difference in the symmetry groups of the matrices @xmath24 of these two approaches looked rather unusual and one could only hope that in the limit @xmath33 imposed by the replica method the results would have agree with each other .",
    "this is really so for the results obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite by using the renormalization group method or perturbation theory .",
    "the compact replica @xmath28-model of ref .",
    "@xcite has later been extended by finkelstein @xciteto interacting electron systems .",
    "an additional topological term was added to this model by pruisken@xcite for studying the integer quantum hall effect .",
    "so , one could hope that the replica @xmath28-models would help to solve many problems in the localization theory",
    ".    however , everything turned out to be considerably more complicated for non - perturbative calculations . desperate attempts @xcite to study the level - level statistics in a limited volume and localization in disordered wires lead the present author to the conclusion that the replica @xmath28-model of ref .",
    "@xcite could not give any reasonable formulae .",
    "calculation of the level - level correlation function using both the compact and noncompact replica @xmath28-models was discussed later by verbaarschot and zirnbauer @xcite with a similar result .",
    "[ recently , formulae for several correlation functions for the unitary ensemble ( @xmath34 ) have nevertheless been obtained kanzieper from the replica @xmath28-models by viewing the replica partition function as toda lattice and using links with panleve equations . ]    the failure in performing non - perturbative calculations with the replica @xmath35-models lead the present author to constructing another type of the @xmath35-model that was not based on the replica trick .",
    "this method was called supersymmetry method , although the word supersymmetry \" is often used in field theory in a more narrow sense .",
    "the field theory derived for the disordered systems using this approach has the same form of the @xmath36-model as the one obtained with the replica trick and all perturbative calculations are similar @xcite .",
    "an attempt to calculate the level - level correlation function lead to a real surprise : the method worked @xcite leading in a rather simple way to the famous formulae for the level - level correlation functions known in the wigner - dyson theory @xcite , thus establishing the relevance of the latter to the disordered systems . since then one could use the rmt for calculations of various physical quantities in mesoscopic systems or calculate directly using the zero - dimensional supermatrix @xmath28-model .",

    "then , the tunnelling leads to an overlap between the wave functions of the different centers and to formation of a conduction band with an effective bandwidth @xmath356@xmath357 where @xmath358 is a coefficient .",
    "the exponential decay of the diffusion coefficient @xmath348 , eq . ( [ e11 ] ) , can follow quite naturally from such a picture .",
    "of course , the picture implies the existence of weakly overlapping centers of the localization near this transition .",
    "a well established multifractality of wave functions at the transition ( for a recent review , see , e.g. @xcite ) may point out on this strong inhomogeneity near the transition .",
    "another indication in favor of the presented picture comes from the fact that the solution @xmath204 of eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) looses the sensitivity to the existence of the transition at frequencies @xmath359 @xmath272 .",
    "this can be seen from a more detailed analysis of eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) .",
    "the interpretation in terms of formation of a very narrow conduction band near the transition with the bandwidth @xmath272 is consistent with this property of the solution @xmath204 .",
    "the fixed point found in @xmath243 for small @xmath238 corresponds to a weak disorder and the strong inhomogeneities are not seen in this approach .",
    "one can not speak of a narrow conduction band near the transition in @xmath243 dimensions within this picture .    in principle ,",
    "centers of ( quasi ) localization exist in @xmath8 and can be described in the framework of @xmath28-model ( for a review , see refs .",
    "however , the idea about these centers of the ( quasi ) localizations is not incorporated in the conventional @xmath244 scheme .",
    "so , the standard continuation of the results obtained for small @xmath360 to @xmath246 may result in loosing an important information .",
    "the non - trivial form of the function @xmath204 ( see e.g. fig . [ fig2 ] ) has lead the present author to the idea @xcite that this function might play the role of an order parameter for the anderson transition .",
    "it was guessed that a laplace transform of this function could be related to a conductance distribution .",
    "this idea has been further developed in ref .",
    "efetov90 , where a functional in an extended space was constructed such that its minimum was reached at the function @xmath193 .",
    "this resembles the landau theory of phase transitions but the role of the order parameter is played a by a function .        in this paper",
    "the basics of the supersymmetry method has been presented .",
    "it is explained how the non - linear supermatrix @xmath36-model is derived and it is shown how one can calculate within this model .",
    "it is demonstrated how one comes to the wigner - dyson statistics in a limited volume and how one obtains anderson localization in disordered wires .",
    "renormalization group scheme is explained in @xmath151 and @xmath243 dimensions for small @xmath361 renormalization group equations are written and solved .",
    "it is shown how one solves the problem of the anderson metal - insulator transition on the bethe lattice and high dimensionality .    from the technical point of view",
    "all this was a demonstration how one can calculate in the dimensions @xmath362 , @xmath5 , @xmath363 and @xmath364 . due to the lack of the space",
    "the present paper is not a complete review of the application of the supersymmetry technique and many interesting works are not mentioned .",
    "however , the calculational schemes presented here have been used in most of the subsequent works .",
    "so , having read this paper one can get an idea on how one can work in all situations where the supersymmetry method is useful .",
    "this is a chapter in the book devoted to 50 years of the anderson localization and i tried to describe shortly how one of the directions of the field was developing in 1980s after the second most important work on the anderson localization aalr has been published .",
    "many of the authors of the present volume entered this field motivated by this publication .",
    "i hope that the development of the supersymmetry method has been useful in solving several interesting problems of the anderson localization .",
    "although the supersymmetry method proved to be an adequate method for studying disordered systems ( at least , without electron - electron interaction ) , several very important problems have not been solved so far . in spite of",
    "the common believe that all states are localized in disordered films ( orthogonal and unitary ensembles ) , the solution for the two - dimensional @xmath36-model has not been found in the limit of low frequencies .",
    "the problem of the integer quantum hall effect has not been solved either , although the idea about instantons @xcite was very useful for the understanding of this phenomenon . the problem of describing the critical behavior near the transition between the hall plateaus still awaits its resolution .",
    "of course , a lot of information comes from numerical simulations but solving the @xmath8 problem analytically would be really a great achievement . as concerns the anderson transition in @xmath365 the hope to solve it exactly is not realistic because even a simpler ising model has not been solved in spite of numerous attempts .",
    "however , in the conventional theory of phase transition one can start with a mean field theory justifiable in high dimensions , determine the upper critical dimension and then make an expansion near this dimensionality .    unfortunately , until now a similar procedure has not been found for the anderson transition ,",
    "although the supermatrix @xmath36-model resembles spin models for which this procedure is standard .",
    "this concerns also the @xmath8 case , where conventional spin @xmath28-models are solvable .",
    "however , the well developed methods like the bethe ansatz or methods of the conformal field theory do not work here .",
    "the formal reason of the failure of these approaches for studying the supermatrix @xmath28-model is that the group of the symmetry of the supermatrices @xmath24 is not compact .",
    "these supermatrices consist of a block varying on a sphere and another one with elements on the hyperboloid .",
    "the latter part of @xmath24 is formally responsible for the localization but its presence leads to difficulties when applying the well developed methods .",
    "it is clear that the importance of the noncompact symmetry is not fully appreciated ."
