    "the origin of the extragalactic x - ray background ( xrb ) is one of the key questions in astrophysics .",
    "the excellent fit of the microwave background , as observed by cobe , to a pure blackbody undistorted by compton scattering from hot electrons , has ruled out a major contribution to the xrb ( @xmath15few % ) from diffuse hot gas ( mather 1990 ) , so a large collection of discrete sources must be responsible .",
    "previous x - ray surveys with rosat have been dominated by qsos ( shanks 1991 ; boyle 1993 ) which , to a flux limit of @xmath16 erg @xmath1 s@xmath2 ( the band 0.5 - 2.0 kev is used throughout this paper ) , can account directly for @xmath1730% of the cosmic soft xrb . here , following preliminary reports by jones ( 1995 ) and ( 1995 ) which listed most of the major conclusions , we present full details of the deepest optically identified x - ray survey yet made which clarify the origin of the remainder of the cosmic soft xrb .",
    "the x - ray data consist of a 115 ksec rosat pspc observation reaching a flux limit of @xmath0 erg @xmath1 s@xmath2 ( section 2 ) .",
    "this observation was made in two parts and source counts from the first 73 ksec of the observation have already been given by branduardi - raymont ( 1994 - hereafter gbr ) .",
    "deep optical ccd images ( section 3.1 ) have been taken in v and r of the inner 15 arcmin radius of the rosat field to provide optical identifications and colours .",
    "optical spectra ( section 3.2 ) have subsequently been taken of sources in a statistically complete sub - section comprising @xmath18 of the 15 arcmin radius survey area .",
    "deep radio surveys at 20 and 6 cm have also been made of the survey area and some preliminary results are presented here .    the main purpose of this paper is not to recalculate the integral source counts of gbr using an increased dataset , although we do present such counts , but to discuss the identification content of the survey ( section 4 ) and to consider the implications for the origin of the soft x - ray background . within a region comprising @xmath18 of the full 15 arcmin radius x - ray survey region",
    ", we have optical spectroscopic observations of almost all likely optical identifications for almost all x - ray sources .",
    "we refer to this regions as our ( spectroscopically ) ` complete area ' and all discussion of the identification content of our survey refers to this area . we show that although qsos dominate at the brighter flux levels , as found in previous rosat surveys , galaxies mainly with narrow emission lines ( nelgs ) dominate at the faintest flux levels .",
    "we also note that a small number of sources are definitely identified with groups or clusters of galaxies .",
    "the x - ray spectra of the various classes of identifications are discussed in section 5 where they are compared with the spectrum of the remaining unresolved xrb . in section 6",
    "we calculate the contribution of the various classes of identified sources to the soft xrb and show that , if the nelg source counts extrapolate to @xmath19 erg @xmath1 s@xmath2 they will account for almost all of the remaining soft xrb .",
    "we also discuss their possible contribution to the xrb at higher energies .",
    "the optical spectra of the nelgs are compared with those of other narrow emission line galaxies such as starburst or seyfert 2 galaxies in section 7 and in section 8 we compare the nelgs with field galaxies in a similar redshift range . in section 9",
    "we summarise our results .",
    "observations with the rosat position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) were made at position ra 13 34 37.0 dec + 37 54 44 ( j2000 ) , in a region of sky of extremely low obscuration ( @xmath20 @xmath1 ) .",
    "the low obscuration was initially found in the neutral hydrogen survey of stark ( 1992 ) and confirmed by analysis of the iras 100@xmath21 cirrus maps which showed very low emission in the chosen direction .",
    "the observations were made in two parts .",
    "the source counts resulting from the first 73 ksec observation in june 1991 have already been reported by gbr who provide details of the absorption measurements .",
    "fluctuation analysis of these same data were presented by barcons ( 1994 ) .",
    "these two initial papers show that the source density flattens off below a euclidean distribution at fluxes less than @xmath22 erg @xmath1 s@xmath2 .",
    "a further observation of 42ksec was made with the pspc in june and july 1993 .",
    "together these two observations comprise the second deepest rosat x - ray survey made .",
    "the deepest pspc survey , of @xmath10150ksec duration , is in the direction of the first lockman hole ( 10h 48 m + 57@xmath23 ) by hasinger ( 1993 ) but optical results have not yet been published from that survey .",
    "initial analysis of the combined ao1 and ao4 data were carried out using the uk asterix software system to create an image from the combined datasets .",
    "following gbr we have rejected data with high anticoincidence rate ( master veto rate @xmath17 170 ) or bad aspect ratio .",
    "this has left 115ksec of ` clean ' data . to optimise the search for point sources we have restricted the energy band to 0.5 - 2.0 kev . below 0.5 kev",
    "there is a substantial contribution to the background from diffuse emission in our own galaxy and above 2.0 kev the particle background dominates .",
    "source searching was carried out using our own software , based on the cash ( 1979 ) statistic , including the radial variation of the psf .",
    "our algorithm is essentially the same as the standard starlink pss source detection algorithm but improves the fitting of the local background .",
    "we set our detection criterion such that @xmath10one of the sources in our survey is expected to be false .",
    "this is approximately the same as using a 3.5@xmath24 significance detection threshold .",
    "flux variability between the ao1 and ao4 observations is small with only @xmath1020% of the sources showing variability , with a maximum detected variation of @xmath1020% amplitude .",
    "we leave discussion of source variability to a future paper and here consider time - averaged fluxes .    to convert between count rate and flux we follow gbr and assume that the x - ray spectra of most sources are described by power laws of energy index @xmath25=+1.1 ( where the flux , @xmath26 , at an energy , @xmath27 , is given by @xmath28 ) and that the absorbing column is @xmath29 @xmath1 .",
    "the conversion then is that 1 pspc ( 0.5 - 2.0 kev ) count s@xmath2 = @xmath30 erg @xmath1 s@xmath2 .",
    "varying the assumed column by 20% ( eg to @xmath31 @xmath1 ) has no measureable effect on the conversion but varying @xmath25 has a small effect .",
    "for example , assuming @xmath25=0.5 gives 1 pspc ( 0.5 - 2.0 kev ) count s@xmath2 = @xmath32 erg @xmath1 s@xmath2 . in section 5",
    "we will see that , although an energy index of @xmath33 is correct for the qsos which comprise the majority of the bright sources , there is a population of faint galaxies with flatter spectra , @xmath34 .",
    "however as the uncertainty in the count / flux conversion is a very small effect , particularly for faint sources where photon counting errors are noticeably larger , we continue to use the conversion factor appropriate to @xmath25= 1.1 for all sources",
    ".        we have conducted simulations to determine the level of completeness of our survey and the accuracy of our positions .",
    "the simulations were carried out in a manner similar to that described in gbr .",
    "each simulated observation consists of a single square frame 34 arcmin along each side with 4 arcsec square pixels .",
    "sources are positioned randomly about the frame and assigned a flux between @xmath35 and @xmath36 erg @xmath1 sec@xmath2 drawn from the observed source counts of the survey with a linear extrapolation below @xmath37 erg @xmath1 sec@xmath2 .",
    "we simulated 150 frames giving a total area of @xmath10 250 times that of the present deep survey .",
    "the source detection algorithm is then applied to the simulated observation frame . in the simulations we use only the on - axis pspc psf throughout .",
    "the ( small ) effect of the radial variation of the psf and the effective area are considered below .",
    "the source fitting procedure produces a list of positions of ` found ' sources @xmath38 with measured fluxes ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "the observed positions and fluxes are then compared with the list of known ` real ' ( ie input ) positions @xmath40 and fluxes ( @xmath41 ) in order to find likely matches .",
    "the comparison was performed as follows .",
    "each ` real ' source brighter than @xmath42 erg @xmath1 sec@xmath2 is read in and compared to each of the ` found ' sources within a 1 arcmin radius using a @xmath43-like statistic : @xmath44 each ` real ' source is then matched with the best - fit ( minimum-@xmath26 ) ` found ' source and the resulting real / found pairs are removed from their respective source lists .",
    "the matching process continues until only unmatched ` real ' and ` found ' sources remain .",
    "unmatched ` real ' sources are referred to as missing sources and unmatched ` found ' sources are referred to as spurious sources . in order to avoid edge - effects ,",
    "all ` real ' and ` found ' sources within 1 arcmin of the edge of the simulated frames are removed from the analysis .",
    "the statistic ` s ' is distributed very much like the @xmath43 statistic , ie the large majority of matches have a low value of s corresponding to ` real ' and ` found ' sources of very similar flux and position .",
    "a very small number of matches have large values of s , but that is just what we would expect in any real observation .",
    "we therefore do not impose any upper limit on the accepted value of s. our only cut - offs are that the matches should occur within 1 arcmin and that we do not match ` real ' sources of flux less than @xmath45 erg @xmath1 sec@xmath2 .",
    "we could easily impose an upper cut - off on s , such as the equivalent of a @xmath46 confidence limit , but it would have a negligible effect on the number of matched sources .

    "+    1.0    as is already clear from figures  [ fig : diff_ids ] and [ fig : int_ids ] , we see again in table  [ tab : xrb ] and figure  [ fig : contrib ] that qsos are the dominant contributor to the 1 - 2 kev xrb at bright fluxes whereas nelgs dominate at low fluxes . by extrapolating the differential source counts to fluxes below our survey limit we see , in table  [ tab : xrb ] , that qsos contribute very little more to the soft xrb whereas the contribution from nelgs continues to rise . indeed ,",
    "if the nelg source counts continue to rise then the overall source counts should start to show an upturn at fluxes not far below our survey limit .",
    "although not required by the rosat deep field fluctuation analyses ( hasinger 1993 ; barcons 1994 ) the predicted upturn is consistent with these analyses . a useful constraint on nelg evolution would therefore be provided by a survey which extended the soft x - ray overall source counts , without the need for identifications , to a flux limit a factor of only a few below the present survey limit .    in table",
    "[ tab : xrb ] we separately list the contribution to the soft xrb of the unidentified sources .",
    "the unidentified sources have a rising source count slope similar to that of the nelgs and some unidentified sources are very probably nelgs , but obscured qsos or very distant clusters can not be ruled out at this stage .",
    "the unidentified sources provide the major uncertainty in the contribution of the various identified classes of sources to the xrb and so completion of the identifications of our sample remains a high priority .",
    "an estimate of the contribution of various classes of object to the xrb can also be made by modelling the evolution of their luminosity functions .",
    "the evolution of the qsos in the present sample , together with qsos from the emss sample ( stocke 1991 ) , has been considered by jones ( 1997 ) and , considering also rixos and other samples , by page ( 1997a ) .",
    "the evolution of the nelgs in the present sample has been considered by page etal ( 1997b ) and pearson ( 1997 ) .",
    "jones deduce that , depending on the evolutionary model chosen , between 31% and 51% of the soft xrb can be contributed by qsos and page ( 1997b ) agree , giving an upper limit of 45% .",
    "the present qso results are in agreement with the previous work although towards the lower end of the jones range .",
    "page ( 1997b ) conclude that nelgs contribute between 15% and 35% of the soft xrb , in approximate agreement with extrapolations from previous surveys eg boyle ( 1995 ) .",
    "our nelg results are also in agreement with previous work .",
    "we have resolved a total of 52% of the 1 - 2 kev x - ray background into point sources at the flux limit of 2x10@xmath54 erg @xmath1 s@xmath2 .",
    "most of the resolved flux ( 31% ) arises from qsos .",
    "approximately 8% arises from nelgs , and the rest comes from clusters and groups of galaxies ( @xmath55 ) , with some sources as yet unidentified . however extrapolating the differential source counts to a flux a factor 4 below the survey limit ( @xmath56 ergs @xmath1 s@xmath2 ) , we expect that @xmath57 of the 1 - 2 kev xrb would be resolved .",
    "the nelg surface density at @xmath58 ergs @xmath1 s@xmath2 would be between 1000 and 2500 deg@xmath59 sufficient , unlike the surface density of qsos , to explain the isotropy of the xrb ( see fabian and barcons ( 1992 ) for a review of the isotropy of the xrb ) .",
    "the nelgs have hard x - ray spectra , similar to that of the xrb , and harder than those of seyfert galaxies in the 2 - 10 kev range ( @xmath60 ) . if their x - ray spectra extrapolate smoothly to higher energies ( see section 7 ) they will be significant contributors to the xrb at energies above those considered in the present survey ( @xmath61 kev ) . as their spectra are similar to the xrb then , to first order , they will contribute similar fractions of the xrb in higher energy bands as they do in the rosat band ( table  [ tab : nelg_hard ] ) .",
    "thus they will be significant contributors but , assuming that we can ignore the scattering model for their x - ray spectra discussed in section 5 , they will not explain all of the presently unresolved hard xrb and , as in every new band , new populations of sources will be needed .",
    "however , as in the present study , nelgs will only be detectable as significant contributors at faint fluxes , well below the level of all sky surveys such as that of ariel v ( 1981 ) .",
    "nelgs should be detectable in small numbers in deep asca observations but in large numbers in xmm and axaf observations .",
    "to determine what the nelgs might be , and how they might relate to other established galaxy types , we consider next their photometric and spectroscopic properties .",
    "we have observed the majority of the survey field in the v - band as well as r - band , and some i - band observations have also been made .",
    "thus we have observed v - r colours for the nelgs .",
    "these colours , which correspond to approximately rest frame b - v colours , or even bluer in most cases , lie in the range 0.1 - 1.0 , with a mean around 0.5 , more indicative of spiral than elliptical galaxies .",
    "morphologically , we have obvious visual examples of spiral host galaxies in the more nearby nelgs ( eg source 32 ) .",
    "we also note that some galaxies appear flattened ( eg rosat 93 and 103 ) whilst others are more circular ( rosat 121 ) . thus some nelgs are certainly spiral galaxies , but the possibility that some are elliptical galaxies can not be ruled out at this stage .",
    "we also note some rather distorted morphologies and evidence of interactions with neighbouring galaxies in many cases .",
    "the results of visual examination are given in the notes on individual sources .",
    "however a proper morphological classification of the majority of nelgs on the basis of our present ccd data requires model fitting .",
    "a proper morphological and colour analysis of the nelgs will be presented in a future paper ( newsam , in preparation ) .",
    "the observed nelgs lie in the redshift range 0.061 to 0.590 , with the majority lying in the range 0.2 - 0.4 . within the present small sample",
    "there is no evidence for evolution in the nelg population or for a redshift cut - off , principally because of the uncertainty associated with the nature of the unidentified sources .",
    "however when the present sample are combined with nelgs from the rixos sample , there is some evidence for evolution ( page 1997b ) , but at a slower rate than found for broad line agn . from analysis of a small sample of nelgs with brighter fluxes , boyle ( 1995 )",
    "find a broadly similar result to that of page .",
    "griffiths ( 1996 ) claim a higher rate of nelg evolution but their sample consists of nelgs from both rosat and einstein observations and so may be subject to additional uncertainties .",
    "the details of nelg evolution are therefore far from clear and even deeper x - ray surveys are required to resolve the isssue .",
    "the absolute magnitudes of the nelgs lie in the range @xmath62 -20 to -23 , typical of large spirals or ellipticals .",
    "however their x - ray luminosities lie in the range @xmath63 to @xmath64 ergs s@xmath2 , factors of 10 - 100 more than normal large spiral galaxies and at the upper bound for large non - cluster ellipticals ( see fabbiano 1989 for a review of x - ray emission from normal galaxies ) .",
    "agn can easily produce such x - ray luminosities , which are towards the lower end of the distribution of agn x - ray luminosities .",
    "however typical agn x - ray spectra are steeper ( energy index @xmath65 ) than the observed average nelg x - ray spectral index ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "blazar - like agn ( eg 3c273 , turner 1990 ; leach 1995 ) have similarly flat x - ray spectra but have much higher observed luminosities ( @xmath67 ergs s@xmath2 ) .",
    "recently there has been some interest in advection dominated accretion onto black holes ( eg narayan and yi 1995 ) . such accretion produces a very hard x - ray spectrum and so advection dominated accretion onto a very massive black hole could account for both the observed luminosities and x - ray spectra of the nelgs .",
    "x - ray data on starbursts galaxies is not as good as for agn because of the generally lower x - ray fluxes of starburst galaxies .",
    "many ` starburst ' galaxies of apparent high x - ray luminosity turn out , on closer inspection , to be agn ( eg moran 1994 ) .",
    "the maximum luminosity so far detected ( 0.5 - 2 kev ) is @xmath68 ergs s@xmath2 ; griffiths and padovani 1990 ; read and ponman 1997 ) .",
    "however with these provisos we note that rephaeli ( 1995 ) measure the average x - ray spectral index of 51 candidate starburst galaxies to be @xmath69 ( 1 - 100 kev ) , very similar to the average spectral index of the nelgs .",
    "rephaeli also consider various possible x - ray emission mechanisms .",
    "they conclude , as does fabbiano ( 1989 ) , that x - ray binary sources , which have hard x - ray spectra extending out to at least 20 kev , can contribute up to @xmath70 ergs s@xmath2 .",
    "such binary systems , which would be distributed throughout the bulge and disc , would be resolvable in many of our nelgs by axaf .",
    "other possibilites include supernovae remnants ( which have a variety of spectral indices ) , compton scattering off relativistic electrons from supernovae ( hard spectrum ) and thermal emission from a supernova - driven galactic wind or from an extended gaseous halo ( soft spectrum ) .",
    "these possibilities require high supernovae rates .",
    "a simple scenario is that starburst / x - ray binary activity dominates the x - ray emission from the lower luminosity nelgs but that agn activity dominates the higher luminosity ones .",
    "more detailed observations , particularly x - ray spectral observations of individual nelgs such as will be possible with xmm , are required to clarify the issue .",
    "our optical spectra ( figures  [ fig : spectra1 ] ,  [ fig : spectra2 ] and  [ fig : spectra3 ] ) show a variety of narrow ( fwhm @xmath71 1000 km / s ) emission lines .",
    "@xmath72 is often redshifted out of the detectable spectral band but [ oii ] is usually within range , and present .",
    "the rest frame equivalent width of [ oii ] is typically 20 - 60@xmath73 , larger than that found in nearby galaxies except for irregular galaxies and markarian galaxies ( kennicutt 1992 ) . @xmath74 and [ oiii ]",
    "are usually in range and sometimes present .",
    "although the spectra are not all of the same signal to noise , it is clear that the spectra are not all identical .",
    "some show strong lines , others weak , and the line ratios vary between the spectra .    in order to quantify the spectra we have plotted the standard diagnostic line ratios ( cf veilleux and osterbrock 1987 ) of [ oiii]5007/@xmath75 _ vs. _ [ nii]6583/@xmath76 ( figure  [ fig : nii ] ) , and [ oiii]5007/@xmath75 _ vs. _ [ sii]6716 + 6731/@xmath76 ( figure  [ fig : sii ] ) .",
    "veilleux and osterbrock show that these line ratios provide a reasonable discriminant between starburst galaxies and true agn .",
    "we find that the nelgs are distributed between the higher ionisation bound of hii region ( ie starburst ) galaxies and the lower ionisation area of true agn .",
    "although not plotted here , a further diagnostic diagram is provided by the ratio of [ oiii]5007 to [ oii]3727 ( eg plotted as [ oiii]5007/@xmath75 _ vs. _ [ oii]3727/@xmath75 by tresse ( 1996 ) in their figure 3 ) . for our sample [ oiii]5007/@xmath77 is usually slightly greater than unity and [ oii]3727/@xmath77 is a factor of a few greater than unity , placing our nelgs in the region of parameter space occupied by liners ( low ionisation nuclear emission region galaxies , eg ferland and netzer 1983 ) .",
    "thus , the nelgs appear to be a mix of galaxy types , generally of low ionisation , including liners and starbursts but also some seyfert ii galaxies .",
    "0.48 0.48    0.48 0.48    0.48 0.48    0.48 0.48    0.48 0.48    0.48 0.48    0.48 0.48    0.48 0.48    0.48 0.48    as a further diagnostic of the nelg emission mechanism we plot , in figure  [ fig : lxlopt ] , the nelg x - ray / optical ratios .",
    "typically accretion powered objects , ie agn , have x - ray / optical ratios close to unity , whereas starburst galaxies have ratios nearer @xmath78 ( eg moorwood 1996 ) .",
    "our nelgs have a wide range of ratios and are distributed in between these two values",
    ". taken together with the line ratio plots , the x - ray / optical ratios indicate that there is probably not one single emission mechanism which is responsible for the x - ray emission in the nelgs .",
    "it is more likely that there is a mixture of emission mechanisms not only within the sample as a whole but within individual objects .",
    "it is likely that both starburst and true agn emission exists together in many of the nelgs .",
    "1.0    1.0    in addition to the x - ray and optical surveys , we have carried out deep radio observations of the whole 30 arcmin diameter x - ray survey area with the very large array ( vla ) reaching source detection limits of @xmath79 mjy at both 20 and 6 cm . a full analysis of these data will be presented elsewhere and here we simply note that , of the 10 x - ray brightest nelgs , 4 are detected in our 20 cm vla survey with fluxes @xmath170.5 mjy .",
    "these are noted in table  [ tab : main ] .",
    "the luminosities are high ( @xmath80 w hz@xmath2 at 20 cm ) by normal spiral galaxy standards ( condon 1992 ) but , with one exception , well below those of classical radio galaxies .",
    "condon shows that radio emission in non - agn galaxies is related to the recent star formation rate ; similarly benn ( 1993 ) find that the optical spectra of sub - mjy radio sources are similar to those of the faint starburst galaxies detected in observations with the infrared astronomical satellite observatory ( iras ) .",
    "our radio observations are therefore consistent with the suggestion above that some of the nelg x - ray emission arises in starburst activity .",
    "1.0    some galaxies with similar optical spectra to our nelgs have been detected in previous x - ray surveys with brighter flux limits ( eg boller 1993 ; boyle 1995 ; carballo 1995 ) . however in these surveys they represented a small fraction of the identified sources .",
    "it was therefore not possible to determine reliably whether they were likely to be a major contributor to the xrb at fainter fluxes or not .",
    "our observations unambiguously show that they are .",
    "the statistical association of galaxies with faint x - ray sources ( in the form of x - ray fluctuations ) has also been reported previously .",
    "lahav ( 1993 ) find an association between ginga x - ray fluctuations and ugc galaxies ( of unknown spectral type ) and , of particular relevance to the present work , roche ( 1995 ) find a @xmath46 correlation between galaxies of r@xmath7123 and fluctuations in a 50ksec rosat pspc observation .",
    "however optical spectra are generally not available for the galaxies in the lahav and roche correlations and so their nature was unknown .",
    "our observations indicate that those galaxies probably included a mixture of nelgs and the absorption line galaxies such as we find to be associated with groups and clusters .",
    "above we have discussed the likely nature of the nelgs . we see that they are generally of low ionisation but that some true agn contribution , as well as a starburst contribution to the x - ray and optical emission , is likely in at least some nelgs .",
    "we have preliminary indications that the nelgs may be related to the faint radio galaxy population , and they are certainly related to starburst galaxies which are already well known to be moderately luminous x - ray sources ( eg griffiths and padovani 1990 ; rephaeli 1991 ; fruscione and griffiths 1991 ; moran , halpern and helfand 1994 ) .",
    "however we note that the x - ray luminosities of the nelgs ( @xmath81 to @xmath64 ergs s@xmath2 ) are all well above the x - ray luminosities of typical starburst galaxies ( maximum detected luminosity @xmath82 ergs s@xmath2 ; griffiths and padovani 1990 ; read and ponman 1997 ) .",
    "thus either the nelgs are extreme examples of starburst galaxies or they contain another x - ray emission source , eg an agn . if they are starbursts , then their implied far infrared luminosities should be detectable in deep iso observations .",
    "there has been much speculation as to the likely contribution of starburst galaxies to the xrb but uncertainty in their evolution and in extrapolating to faint flux levels has prevented any reliable conclusions from being reached .",
    "we note that the nelgs are predominantly blue , and faint , and so we may speculate about their relationship to the faint blue galaxy population ( eg colless 1990 ) .",
    "however we note that , based on their angular correlation function , the faint blue galaxies have likely redshifts of 0.2 - 0.3 ( landy 1996 ) , a little lower than that of the nelgs . for that assumed redshift range ,",
    "the faint blue galaxies have absolute magnitudes @xmath83 magnitudes fainter than the nelgs .",
    "the obvious question therefore arises as to whether the various faint galaxy populations are really different in any way or merely different manifestations of broadly the same basic phenomenon .",
    "it is therefore interesting to compare our nelgs with the field galaxy population in a similar redshift range .",
    "tresse et al ( 1996 ) have examined the spectra of 138 galaxies selected from an i - band magnitude limited sample ( @xmath84 ) out to redshift 0.3 .",
    "as their sample selects galaxies on the basis of their old stellar population it avoids bias towards starburst galaxies which dominate b - band or iras selected samples .",
    "however they still find that 85% of their sample display at least narrow line @xmath72 in emission and 53% display , in addition , several forbidden emission lines ; 17% of their galaxies display spectra consistent with seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "only 15% display pure absorption line spectra .",
    "the tresse sample shows a very similar distribution of emission line spectra to our nelgs and their emission line galaxies have a very similar distribution to our nelgs in the standard line ratio plots ( veilleux and osterbrock 1987 ) , straddling the boundary between agn ( seyfert ii ) and hii region spectra .",
    "the distribution of [ oii]3727 equivalent widths is very similar in our nelgs and in the tresse sample .",
    "the average absolute magnitude of tresse et al s emission line galaxies , @xmath85 , is less luminous than that of our nelgs ( @xmath62 -20 to -23 ) by around 3 magnitudes , but is similar to that estimated for the faint blue galaxies by landy our nelgs may therefore just represent the more luminous examples of the emission line field galaxies .",
    "if the optically less luminous , but more numerous , emission line field galaxies produce similarly lower luminosity x - ray emission , then we may reasonably expect that the contribution of nelgs to the xrb will continue to rise at lower x - ray fluxes , supporting the extrapolations made in section 6",
    ".    the tresse sample is selected up to redshift 0.3 , whereas our nelgs reach redshift 0.6 thus the possibility of evolutionary differences between the two samples exists .",
    "similarly , in the very local universe huchra and burgh ( 1992 ) find very few active galaxies indicating possible evolution in the activity of field galaxies between redshift 0 and 0.3 . however , as discussed by tresse , the fraction of field galaxies which are active which is given by huchra and burgh ( 2% ) should be treated cautiously and is probably an underestimate of the overall number of emission line galaxies ( including galaxies other than seyferts ) .",
    "evolutionary uncertainties therefore prevent detailed extrapolation of the contribution of nelgs to the xrb at very faint fluxes , however we do note that page ( 1997b ) find no strong evidence for evolution in the nelg populations found in the present survey and in the rixos survey and so the simple extrapolations given in section 6 may not be too far wrong .    thus we conclude that a substantial fraction of the xrb is contributed by field galaxies .",
    "the iras galaxies , and sub - mjy radio sources , are most likely simply the starburst - dominated fraction of these same emission line field galaxies .",
    "in the deepest optically identified x - ray survey so far made , we have resolved approximately half of the x - ray background at 1 kev .",
    "the identifications are spectroscopically 85% complete to @xmath86 erg @xmath1 s@xmath2 ( 0.5 -2.0 kev ) . at brighter fluxes ( @xmath4 erg @xmath1 s@xmath2 )",
    "we confirm the results of previous less deep x - ray surveys with 84% of our sources being qsos .",
    "however at the faint flux limit the survey is dominated by a population of galaxies , mainly with narrow emission lines ( nelgs ) . whereas the qso differential source count slope below @xmath87 erg @xmath1 s@xmath2 is @xmath10 - 1.4 , severely sub - euclidean , the differential nelg slope is close to euclidean ( @xmath11 ) . to the survey limit qsos still contribute the largest identified fraction of the xrb , @xmath1731% as opposed to 8% for nelgs and 10% for clusters .",
    "we note that a small number of the fainter nelgs may be misidentifications and that some of the unidentified sources are almost certainly faint qsos , although some are also likely to be either nelgs or clusters .",
    "however as we are unable to correct our observed contributions to the xrb until these sources are properly identified , we simply note that all of our contributions are observed values .",
    "however if the observed differential source counts can be reliably extrapolated to fainter fluxes , clusters will contribute almost nothing more to the xrb and qsos will contribute only a small amount more . on the other hand",
    "the nelg contribution to the xrb will double by a flux limit a factor 4 below the present survey .",
    "the nelgs observed so far lie in the redshift range 0.1 - 0.6 , as one might expect given an identification limit of r=23 .",
    "it is not yet clear whether there is any astrophysical significance to the maximum observed redshift .",
    "the nelgs have generally blue colours , and have optical spectra similar to that of the active field galaxy population at a similar redshift .",
    "some nelgs are definitely large spirals but the possibility that some are ellipticals can not be ruled out on the basis of the present analysis .",
    "many of the nelgs are in disturbed or interacting systems .",
    "the nelgs , both as a sample and individually , appear to be a mixture of starburst galaxies and true agn .",
    "by comparison with the field galaxy surveys of tresse , the simplest interpretation of our results is that the nelgs which we detect are simply the more luminous members of the normal field galaxy population .",
    "the average nelg x - ray spectrum is harder than that of the qsos , and similar to that of the remaining unresolved cosmic soft x - ray background ( xrb ) .",
    "nelgs should therefore be a major contributor to the xrb at higher energies although without a detailed understanding of the nelg x - ray emission mechanism it is not possible to say up to which energies one might reasonably expect them to contribute . however their fluxes at higher energies will still be low ( @xmath88 erg @xmath1 s@xmath2 , 2 - 10 kev ) and so they may not show up in large numbers in asca surveys but should be prominent in surveys with xmm and axaf .",
    "we also find that a small number of groups or clusters of galaxies are identified as x - ray sources .",
    "so far we have not found any x - ray identifications with entirely isolated absorption line galaxies .",
    "all such galaxies appear to have at least a few faint companions . however the groups / clusters are generally not very rich .",
    "the number of groups found is in approximate agreement with a zero - evolution scenario for low luminosity clusters , unlike the situation for rich clusters in the same redshift range ( @xmath89 ) .",
