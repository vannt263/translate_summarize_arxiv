    "a number of models have been proposed to explain this fact , the simplest of which is the cosmological constant .",
    "while a cosmological constant is enough to explain the current data , its constancy leads to a fine tuning problem ( sahni & starobinski 2000 ; peebles & ratra , 2002 ; padmanabhan , 2002b ) .",
    "a simple phenomenological generalization of the cosmological constant is to model the dark energy component that drives the acceleration as an ideal fluid with an equation of state given by @xmath2 in which the equation of state parameter @xmath1 is allowed to vary with time . in this parameterization",
    "the cosmological constant corresponds to @xmath3 , while for other viable models @xmath4 at the present epoch .",
    "such a parameterization indeed arises naturally in several models , such as quintessence ( ratra & peebles 1988 ; wetterich 1988 ) , k - essence ( armendariz - picon et al . 1999 ) and a tachyonic scalar field ( gibbons 2002 ; padmanabhan 2002a ; padmanabhan & roy choudhury 2002 ; bagla et al .",
    "however the precise form of @xmath0 is model dependent .    in view of this",
    "there has been considerable interest in attempts to summarize the current ( and future ) data in terms of a few numbers .",
    "there are several ways of doing this , such as using a polynomial approximation for @xmath0 ( e.g. weller & albrecht , 2002 ) or in terms of derivatives of the expansion factor ( called statefinders by sahni et al .",
    "2002 ) . to be able to fit data using a polynomial form we have to choose a low order polynomial since realistic data contains only a finite amount of information . on the other hand",
    "we need to use enough polynomial orders so that the data is adequately described .",
    "saini et al .",
    "( 2003 ) investigate in some detail the issue of how to go about this and show that the current data and near future data seem to require at most a low order polynomial .",
    "( this , of course , does not imply that the true equation of state is also of a low order polynomial form . )",
    "these methods attempt to capture the effect of an unknown function @xmath0 , which is equivalent to infinite number of parameters , in terms of a finite ( and often small ) number of parameters . in the limited redshift range probed by supernova data the true variations in @xmath0",
    "might be such that a low order polynomial fit is a reasonable approximation .",
    "alternatively one can expand the function @xmath0 in terms of a some set of basis functions which are complete in the given redshift interval .",
    "if the basis functions are chosen judiciously only a small set of expansion coefficients will be required to describe the function @xmath0 within the limits of the experimental accuracy .",
    "owing to the random noise in cosmological data any of these choices could fit the data adequately in a maximum likelihood sense .",
    "since the distance measures are integrals over nonlinear expressions involving @xmath0 , any parameter determined by such a maximum likelihood analysis represents some non - trivial average of the true @xmath0 .",
    "our main aim in this paper is to show that the actual _ functional _ relation of the cosmological distance measures to @xmath0 is not far from being linear .",
    "this allows us to deduce an approximate relation between the fitted coefficients and the true @xmath0 .",
    "this allows one to obtain a quantitative description of the averaging involved in reducing a function @xmath0 to a finite set of numbers .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section  2",
    "we derive the linear response approximation relating the coordinate distance and the equation of state of the dark energy , and show that within a reasonable range of parameters for the dark energy it works to better than @xmath5 .",
    "in section  3 we use this approximation to relate the fitted coefficients of a polynomial form to the true equation of state for the case of fitting to the luminosity distance , and show that they are related through a weighted integral of the true equation of state .",
    "we then generalize this result to the case of an arbitrary functional form which is linear in the parameters . in section  4",
    "we derive a similar relationship for cmb where , in the simplest case , only one measurement of the angular distance to the last scattering surface is available . in section  5",
    "we show that the linear approximation also enables a non - parametric estimation of @xmath0 .",

    ", a large value for @xmath20 indicates that @xmath21 is relatively more sensitive to the independent variable around the point @xmath22 ; and a small value for @xmath20 will indicate relative insensitivity of @xmath21 to the independent variable around @xmath22 .",
    "this follows directly from the definition of derivative of a function @xmath23 in the case of @xmath21 depending not on a single variable but on a _ function _ @xmath24 we need to study how @xmath21 changes if the function @xmath24 is changed slightly around a point @xmath25 .",

    "if we bin the supernovae in redshifts interval of @xmath45 , this will give a relative error in the luminosity distance of about @xmath46 .",
    "saini et al .",
    "( 2002 ) show that given this level of precision and given the present uncertainty in the value of @xmath47 , the data seems to require at the most a linear polynomial order in @xmath0 . to show how accurately eq  [ eq : approximation ] gives the luminosity distance in this restricted case , in fig  [ fig : contours ]",

    "the approximation works even better at smaller redshifts but less so at higher redshifts , but the measurement errors are expected to be larger here . therefore , the conclusions drawn from this approximation are expected to remain valid until an unprecedented accuracy is achieved in the measurement of luminosity distance .",
    "since we have no fundamental understanding of the nature of dark energy , it is necessary to assume some suitable , versatile , functional form for @xmath0 to fit the cosmological data . since the luminosity distance depends on the equation of state through an integral relation , and the cosmological data is often fitted through maximum likelihood method , we can always add a small fast varying term to any well fitting @xmath54 , while still retaining a good fit . and",
