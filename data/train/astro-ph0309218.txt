    "most stars form in clustered environments , and it is now believed that a significant fraction are born in sparse groups and clusters with @xmath13 stars @xcite .",
    "study of the stellar and brown dwarf populations of sparse groups is therefore important for all star formation and stellar evolution issues , e.g. the nature of the imf , issues of dynamics and dispersal of young groups into the galactic field , binarity , and the evolution of proto - planetary discs .",
    "our laboratory to study such issues is the @xmath2 cha star cluster  a recently - discovered sparse , young and nearby stellar group that is kinematically linked with the rich sco - cen ( sco ob2 ) association ( mamajek , lawson & feigelson 1999 , 2000 ) . owing to its proximity to the sun , compactness in the sky , and distance from obscuring clouds",

    "x - ray , proper motion , photometric and spectroscopic study of the cluster had resulted in the discovery of 15 primaries prior to this work ( see also lawson et al . 2001 , 2002 ) . in sections 2 and 3 , we update the cluster membership with the addition of two new m5 wtt stars , and we estimate the fraction of multiple systems in the cluster . with a largely complete census for stars earlier than @xmath15 m6 , we study the cluster imf and its implications for the undiscovered low - mass star and brown dwarf population ( section 4 ) .",

    "pms populations form a natural isochrone in the colour - magnitude diagram that is elevated in brightness above the location of a majority of field stars owing to a combination of stellar youth , proximity and , for pms populations now distant from their parent molecular cloud , the absence of significant interstellar reddening . for pms groups discovered via others means , e.g. x - ray study or objective prism surveys , optical photometric study also permits an independent evaluation of completeness within the survey field .",
    "for example , @xcite used the ( @xmath16 ) versus @xmath17 colour - magnitude diagram to locate x - ray faint pms stars in the @xmath2 cha cluster that had similar photometric properties to the x - ray selected recx stars @xcite . in a limited area search of @xmath18 arcmin@xmath19",

    "the data were obtained under photometric conditions in @xmath27 arcsec seeing , with the raw aperture - extracted observations of stars in each ccd field then transformed to the standard system using observations of southern photometric standard stars and extinction values measured for the sutherland site .",
    "exposure times in the @xmath17 and @xmath26 bands of 90 s and 30 s , respectively , permitted detection ( for @xmath14 myr - old pms stars located at @xmath28 pc ) of stars of spectral type @xmath29 m6 with @xmath30 and ( @xmath16 ) @xmath31 at a photometric precision better than 3 percent .",
    "following @xcite , we investigated stars with properties approximate to known members , choosing objects with magnitudes in the range of @xmath32 mag of the sequence of recx stars in the ( @xmath16 ) versus @xmath17 colour - magnitude diagram .",
    "this criterion is intended to account for the possibility of a greater spread of ages within the cluster than is apparent in the recx stars , highly reddened stars or binary stars with elevated @xmath17 magnitudes , and the likelihood of non - linearities in the colour - magnitude relationship for the cluster @xcite . with the exception of the three bright early - type stars and the two brightest k - type members which saturated the ccd ,",

    "the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) is important for studies of star formation and stellar evolution in clusters and galaxies .",
    "surprisingly , the imf has been shown to be essentially uniform in space and time , suggesting that the basic process of the star formation is somewhat universal @xcite .",
    "however , imf studies are usually confined to rich clusters or widespread field populations , and have rarely been examined in a sparse cluster environment .      using the membership and masses in table [ t2.tab ] , we compare the imfs of the sparse @xmath2 cha cluster and rich orion trapezium cluster in figure 5 . for the trapezium cluster ,",
    "we adopt power - law slopes @xmath61 for @xmath62 m@xmath47 , @xmath63 for @xmath64 m@xmath47 , and @xmath65 for @xmath66 m@xmath47 , where @xmath67 = @xmath68log @xmath69(@xmath70 log @xmath71)/@xmath68log @xmath71 @xcite .    for both the distributions of primary ( figure 5a ) and member masses ( figure 5b ) , we scale the trapezium imf to the observed cumulative distributions for @xmath2 cha by minimizing the kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) statistic , or supremum difference between the distributions .",
    "we find the distribution of primaries / members is consistent with the trapezium imf at the @xmath72 percent confidence level according to the k - s test , although we suspect a few low mass stars may remain to be discovered in high - mass ratio multiple systems . also , if the cluster population does significantly extend beyond the limits of the searched area , then they are likely to be low - mass members ejected by dynamical interactions .",
    "a number of recent dynamical studies @xcite find small stellar groups can evolve toward evaporation and dispersal on timescales of a few myr , with an outer halo dominated by low - mass single stars .    extending the comparison to masses @xmath73 m@xmath47 , we predict ( for primaries ; figure 5a ) an additional 10 stars between @xmath9 m@xmath47 and 10 brown dwarfs between @xmath74 m@xmath47 . for all members ( primaries and companions ) the comparable numbers are 14 and 15 , respectively .",
    "thus from this calculation we expect the undiscovered low - mass population ( objects with @xmath75 m@xmath76 ) of the @xmath2 cha cluster is comparable in number to the known stellar population , if this cluster follows the imf of a rich young stellar clusters such as trapezium .",
    "we also consider the suggestion of @xcite that young small groups and rich clusters represent different types of physical systems and hence different models of star formation .",
    "therefore , we compare the mass function of @xmath2 cha cluster with the mass function of other young small groups . in this case , we use the ratio @xmath77 of intermediate- to low - mass stars where @xmath77 = @xmath69(@xmath78 m@xmath47)/@xmath69(@xmath79 m@xmath47 ) because the mass bins are wider than the uncertainties in stellar mass determination from pms models and to alleviate the statistical issues raised when comparing mass functions of groups with small populations . for the @xmath2 cha cluster",

    "@xcite shows a correlation between the stellar density of compact groups and open clusters , and the mass of the most massive cluster member ; also see figure 2 of clarke , bonnell & hillenbrand ( 2000 ) .",
    "the @xmath2 cha cluster follows the correlation seen in other clusters ; see figure [ f6.fig ] .",

    "we count 8 primaries within 6 arcmin of our adopted cluster centre lead by the @xmath86 m@xmath47 b9 star @xmath2 cha .",

    "employing @xmath69-body simulations of stellar cluster populations , @xcite suggest that mass segregation in rich clusters reflects the initial conditions of the cluster , and is not a consequence of dynamical interactions .    in figure [ f7.fig ] , we plot the cumulative radial ( a ) number and ( b ) mass distributions for primaries ( thin lines ) and members ( bold lines ) in the @xmath2 cha cluster .",
    "these distribution plots are flat beyond @xmath87 arcmin , reflecting the absence of cluster members beyond this radius .",
    "the dotted lines are the expected distributions for isothermal spheres with core radius @xmath88 arcmin ( 0.5 pc ) .",
    "the radial distribution ( figure 7a ) of stars is consistent with an isothermal sphere .",

    "an alternative measure of mass segregation considers the radial ( @xmath91 ) colour excess , where the photometric colour effectively acts as a mass surrogate .",
    "@xcite studied 12 open clusters via integrated _ ubv _ colours using the observations of individual cluster members and demonstrated that clusters showing pronounced mass segregation also show significant radial variations in integrated colour , where @xmath92(@xmath91 ) = [ ( @xmath91)@xmath93  ( @xmath91)@xmath94 ) ] @xmath95 mag . for the @xmath2 cha cluster stars , with no available @xmath96-band photometry , we estimated the photospheric @xmath96-band magnitude using the colour conversion tables of @xcite- and @xmath97-band fluxes , since pms stars often show @xmath96- and @xmath97-excesses due to chromospheric emission . ] . comparing the integrated colour for members residing within @xmath98 arcmin ( the inner region ) , and those outside ( the outer region ) we find @xmath92(@xmath91 ) @xmath99",

    "we conclude that significant mass segregation is present in the @xmath2 cha cluster .",
    "this is the sparsest stellar cluster for which mass segregation has been seen . without detailed dynamical modeling and the availability of precise space velocities for cluster members ; see e.g. delgado - donate et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , our observations do not as - yet allow us to distinguish between mass segregation arising from the cluster formation process or from dynamical two - body or @xmath69-body interactions .",
    "a related question is whether the immediate environments of higher mass stars have unusual densities of lower mass stars , e.g. orion trapezium ob stars show high numbers of nearby low - mass stars @xcite which may support models where high mass stars form from the coalescence of many lower mass stars @xcite .",
    "two of the intermediate - mass stars , rs cha ( known double , and probable triple system ) and hd 75505 ( itself single ) , have @xmath100 low - mass stars residing within a few arcmin , while @xmath2 cha itself ( probable binary ) appears isolated .",

    "<S> we report new results in our continuing study of the unique compact ( 1 pc extent ) , nearby ( @xmath0 pc ) , young ( @xmath1 myr ) stellar cluster dominated by the b9 star @xmath2 chamaeleontis . </S>",

    "<S> the cluster now consists of 17 primaries and @xmath6 secondaries lying within 100 au of their primaries . the apparent distribution of 9:7:1 single : binary : triple systems shows @xmath7 higher multiplicity than in the field main sequence stars , and is comparable to that seen in other pre - main sequence ( pms ) populations . </S>",
    "<S> the initial mass function ( imf ) is consistent with that of rich young clusters and field stars . by extending the cluster imf to lower masses , </S>",
    "<S> we predict @xmath8 additional low mass stars with @xmath9 m@xmath5 and @xmath10 brown dwarfs with @xmath11 m@xmath5 remain to be discovered . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath2 cha cluster extends the established stellar density and richness relationship for young open clusters . </S>",
    "<S> the radial distribution of stars is consistent with an isothermal sphere , but mass segregation is present with @xmath12 percent of the stellar mass residing in the inner 6 arcmin ( 0.17 pc ) . considering that the @xmath2 cha cluster is sparse , diffuse and young , the cluster may be an ideal laboratory for distinguishing between mass segregation that is primordial in nature , or arising from dynamical interaction processes .    </S>",
