    "string dualities give us many interesting equivalences between different expressions for string theory .",
    "for example , the t - duality relates type iia and iib string theory , where the background fields in both sides are non - trivially related to each other .",
    "the s - duality is a more non - trivial example of the string dualities , which relates the weak and strong coupling regimes of type iib string theory . since it involves the strong coupling regime in one side , in order to test the s - duality we need some non - perturbative analysis beyond the perturbative string theory .",
    "one of the promising way to test the s - duality is to examine bps states . in general ,",
    "bps states are important probes of non - perturbative properties of the theories with extended ( @xmath3 ) supersymmetry .",
    "the bps states are generically stable under the change of the hyper multiplet moduli parameters , such as the string coupling constant .",
    "however , their degeneracy can actually `` jump '' at some codimension one subspace in the vector multiplet moduli space .",
    "this is called wall - crossing phenomena , which make it valuable and interesting to study counting the bps states . the bps counting problem and",
    "the wall - crossing phenomena are important also in many other research areas , such as black hole microstates @xcite , donaldson - thomas invariants @xcite , topological strings and instanton counting @xcite , m - theory viewpoint @xcite , exact counting of @xmath4 dyons @xcite , supersymmetric gauge theories @xcite and many others @xcite .    in this paper , we test the string dualities by studying the bps states of the theory . in particular , we compare the spectra of bps states in both sides of the duality . in one side , we consider the d4-d2-d0 system in type iia string theory on the resolved conifold . after taking the t and s - duality , this d - brane system is mapped to a d5-d3-f1 system in type iib theory on @xmath5 .",
    "the original conifold geometry is mapped to two ns5-branes after the t - duality transformation @xcite and then the s - duality changes them into two d5-branes .",
    "our purpose in this paper is to check the equivalence of the bps spectra in both sides of the duality , including the effects of the wall - crossing phenomena .",
    "we start from the type iia side , where our d - brane bound states of interest are composed of one non - compact d4-brane and various numbers of d2 and d0-branes bound to it .",
    "we let our d2-branes be wrapped on the compact two - cycle of the conifold so that the d2-branes have finite mass , while the d4-brane is stretched in a non - compact divisor of the conifold .",
    "the bps partition function is defined by @xmath6 where @xmath7 denotes the bps index of charge @xmath8 and @xmath9 stands for one unit of the non - compact d4-brane charge .",
    "the unit d2 and d0-brane charges are denoted by @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively . therefore @xmath12 are d2 and d0-brane charges of the bound states .",
    "the four - form @xmath13 is dual to the compact two - cycle of the conifold .",
    "the boltzmann weights for d2 and d0 branes are denoted by @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively .",
    "this bps partition function of the d4-d2-d0 states was already evaluated in @xcite by using the kontsevich - soibelman s wall - crossing formula @xcite .",
    "as was previously mentioned , the partition function @xmath16 depends on the moduli parameter @xmath17 , whose imaginary part @xmath18 is roughly the size of the compact two - cycle of the conifold . so that the central charge of a d2-brane is equal to @xmath17 .",
    "when @xmath18 is large , @xmath19 and @xmath18 are regarded as the b - field and the size of the compact two - cycle of the conifold . ]",
    "suppose we fix @xmath20 and move @xmath18 from @xmath21 to @xmath22 .",
    "when the moduli cross the walls of marginal stability , the partition function jumps . for @xmath23 ,",
    "it is given by in equation is replaced by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the euler characteristics of the four - cycle @xmath26 wrapped by the d4-brane . since our d4-brane is non - compact , the euler characteristics @xmath25 generally has an ambiguity .",
    "however , in this paper , we omit all such ambiguities coming from the non - compactness and simply set @xmath27 . ]",
    "@xmath28 the integer @xmath29 denotes the number of wall - crossings that occur when we move the moduli from @xmath30 to its given value .",
    "on the other hand , for @xmath31 , the partition function can be written as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the number of walls between the given value of @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "now , our remaining task is to evaluate the bps partition function in the dual type iib side , and compare the result with the above expressions in the type iia side .",
    "this is the main subject of this paper .",
    "let us here summarize our results in this paper .",
    "we study the spectrum of the bps d5-d3-f1 states in type iib theory , which are dual to the above d4-d2-d0 states on the conifold .",
    "one of the most important advantages of the type iib side is that the bps spectrum can be analyzed in the perturbative open string theory on the flat spacetime @xmath5 .",
    "the d0 and d2-brane charges in the type iia side are identified with the winding number of the fundamental strings and the electric charge on the d5-brane , respectively .",
    "we examine the spectrum of the bps fundamental strings stretched between d3 and d5-branes , and calculate the bps partition function .",
    "the result is exactly the same as ( [ bps1 ] ) and , including the wall - crossing phenomena .",
    "this result is a quite strong evidence of the duality .",
    "we also show that the moduli parameters in the type iia side can be identified with the relative positions of the d5-branes and the electric field on the d3-brane in the type iib side .",
    "this gives us the pictorial understanding of the wall - crossing phenomena of the original d4-d2-d0 system .",
    "the construction of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec : duality ] , we discuss the dualizing procedure of our conifold system with d4-d2-d0 branes .",
    "we identify the relevant moduli and the charges in the dual picture .",
    "section [ sec : open - string ] and section [ sec : wall - crossing ] involve the main result of this paper .",
    "we count bps states by investigating bps open string spectrum on the d5-d3 system and obtain the bps partition functions in all the chambers .",
    "they completely agree with the bps spectrum in the type iia side .",
    "in this section , we consider the type iib dual of the d4-d2-d0 states on the conifold , which will turn out to be d5-d3-f1 states . in the original type iia side , we put one d4-brane on a non - compact holomorphic four - cycle @xmath26 of the conifold @xmath36 , and consider d2-branes wrapped on the rigid @xmath37 and d0-branes localized in the conifold .",
    "these d - brane bound states can be seen as charged particles in four - dimensional spacetime transverse to the six - dimensional conifold geometry .",
    "their bps partition function was evaluated in @xcite as and .",
    "below , we show that this brane configuration is dual to a d5-d3-f1 system after the t and s - dual transformations .",
    "we also discuss how the moduli parameters of the theory are mapped under the duality transformations .",
    "our staring point is the d4-d2-d0 bound states in type iia string theory on the conifold .",
    "the brane configuration is summarized in table [ table : d4-d2-d0 ] .",
    ".the bps d - brane configuration of interest in the original type iia setup .",
    "there is one d4-brane wrapped on the non - compact divisor @xmath26 of the conifold .",
    "the d2-branes are wrapped on the rigid @xmath37 while the d0-branes are localized in the conifold . [",

    "in this section , we evaluate the spectrum of our bps bound states with two d5-branes , a single d3-brane , and fundamental strings ( table [ table : d5-d3-f1 ] ) .",
    "we first note that the configuration of table [ table : d5-d3-f1 ] always saturates the bps bound if there is no fundamental string .",
    "this is obvious because such a configuration is dual to a single d4-brane wrapped on a holomorphic cycle in the type iia side .",
    "putting fundamental strings on the d5-d3 system corresponds to adding d2 and d0-brane charges in the original type iia setup .",
    "thus , the bps spectrum of interest can be evaluated by counting the number of bps string states on the d5-d3 system .",
    "one advantage of our analysis in the dual iib side is that we only have to analyze the perturbative string theory in _ flat _",
    "spacetime , while analysis in the type iia side should take into account non - trivial @xmath38-corrections due to the curved background .- corrections , it is difficult to evaluate the bps spectrum directly in the type iia side . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors instead used the kontsevich - soibelman formula that tells us how the bps index changes in wall - crossings . ]",
    "it is for this reason that we can explicitly count the number of bps states for arbitrary values of moduli parameters .",
    "we first note that fundamental strings which we should count is only those on the d3-brane and those stretched between d5 and d3-branes .",
    "this is because we are now considering _ the bound states _ of the d3-brane and some number of fundamental strings ; the fundamental strings must be open strings and at least one end of each string must be attached to the d3-brane .",
    "the first one will be studied in [ subsec : d3-d3 ] , while in [ subsec : d5-d3 ] we analyze the second one .      by definition ,",
    "bps saturated states lie in the bottom of the mass spectrum with fixed charges .",
    "thus , our bps string states can be identified with the lowest energy states with the winding number along @xmath39-direction and electric charge on the d5-brane fixed .",
    "recall here that the zero point energies of string states in ns and ramond sectors can be written as @xmath40 \\qquad a_{\\rm r } & = & 0,\\label{eq : ramond_zero}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] respectively , where @xmath41 denotes the number of dimensions in which one of the open string endpoints has the dirichlet boundary condition and the other has the neumann boundary condition . we start from strings stretched between the d5 and d3-branes ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : three ] ) . for simplicity , we first consider the case of @xmath42 for the electric field on the d3-brane .",
    "recall first that the position of the d5-brane is given by when the d5-brane is located at @xmath43 . since our d3-brane ends on the d5-brane and",
    "is extended to @xmath44 , we should impose @xmath45 on the moduli parameter @xmath17 so that the strings between the d5 and d3-branes can saturate the bps bound . with @xmath46 , a string stretched between the d5 and d3-branes can not be orthogonal to the d3-brane , and therefore breaks all the supersymmetry . ]",
    "such strings generally have the winding number @xmath47 along the compactified @xmath48 and the electric charge @xmath49 on the d5-brane .",
    "these two charges correspond to the d0 and d2-brane charges in the original type iia setup . from table [",
    "table : d5-d3-f1 ] , we find that such open strings have @xmath50 and therefore the lowest energy states for the strings arise from the r - sector .",
    "this means that the bps strings between the d5 and d3-branes are fermions in target space .",
    "in fact , the r - sector has two fermionic zero modes for oscillations in @xmath51 and @xmath39-directions ( see table [ table : d5-d3-f1 ] ) , which form the two - dimensional clifford algebra @xmath52 for @xmath53 .",
    "thus , before the gso - projection , the lowest energy states behave as a two - dimensional dirac fermion in target space , while the gso - projection reduces a chiral half of them .",
    "the chirality operator is now defined by @xmath54 and we choose the gso - projected lowest energy state @xmath55 so that @xmath56 .",
    "here , the charge @xmath57 denotes the energy of the bps string , while @xmath47 is its winding number along @xmath39-direction . note here that there are no other conserved momentum or winding number in @xmath58 directions . for later use",
    ", we here define @xmath59 in terms of the winding number @xmath47 by @xmath60 here , the sign @xmath61 depends on the choice of the string orientation , and @xmath62 is the distance between the d5 and d3-branes . recall also that @xmath63 is the radius of @xmath48 on which @xmath39-direction is compactified ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] ) .    in order to obtain physical ground states",
    ", we have to further impose @xmath64 and @xmath65-conditions . in our notation , @xmath64 and @xmath65",
    "are given by and @xmath65 does not include contributions from ghosts in .",
    "we also mention that the previous definition of @xmath59 is just for simplicity of equation . ]",
    "@xmath66 where @xmath67 and the dots involve the contributions from oscillations .",
    "hence , the @xmath64-condition implies @xmath68 while the @xmath65-condition gives a constraint @xmath69 in the second equality of , we used the condition @xmath56 and the anti - commutation relation .",
    "thus , the @xmath64 and @xmath65-conditions imply that @xmath70 .",
    "this means that the energy of a bps string stretched between the d5 and d3-branes is determined by its winding number @xmath47 .",
    "hence , we can conclude that _ there is only one fermionic quantum state for each winding number @xmath47 of the bps string stretched between the d5 and d3-branes .",
    "_ note here that equation and the condition @xmath71 imply that the winding number should satisfy @xmath72 or @xmath73 according to the orientation of the string .",
    "changing the string orientation corresponds to the charge conjugation for the original d2-branes in the type iia side .",
    "therefore the winding number @xmath47 is positive or zero if the original d2-brane charge @xmath74 , while it should be positive if @xmath75 .",
    "this fact is important when we evaluate the bps partition function .",
    "hereafter , we call strings for @xmath74 `` d3-d5 strings '' and strings for @xmath75 `` d5-d3 strings '' ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : three ] ) .",
    "we here investigate strings on the d3-brane , namely `` d3-d3 strings . '' with the vanishing winding number , such strings just describe the quantum fluctuations of the d3-brane .",
    "but now , since @xmath39-direction is compactified on @xmath48 , there are bps strings on the d3-brane with the non - vanishing winding number @xmath47 along the @xmath48 .",
    "the winding number @xmath47 corresponds to the d0-brane charge @xmath76 in the type iia side . for the non - vanishing @xmath77 , this system again becomes a d5-d3-f1 system , but now it does not have any d2-brane charge .",
    "this is because both ends of such strings are on the d3-brane .",
    "hence , these bps bound states are dual to the d4-d0 states on the resolved conifold in the type iia side .",
    "let us now count the number of such bps strings .",
    "for each value @xmath47 of the winding number there is a supersymmetric string ground state .",
    "this is just the same subtlety appeared in the d4-d0 bound states in iia side . ] , which follows from and .",
    "such a single - string configuration contributes @xmath78 to the bps partition function .",
    "however , there are more string configurations that give @xmath78 to the partition function . for example , let us consider two strings on the d3-brane with the winding numbers @xmath79 and @xmath80 , respectively .",
    "such a two - string configuration also contributes @xmath78 to the bps partition function . in general , for a given value @xmath47 , there are @xmath81 configurations of strings on the d3-brane that contribute @xmath78 to the bps partition function , where @xmath81 denotes the partition number of @xmath47 .",
    "then , we can write a generating function of such bps bound states as @xmath82 this is precisely equal to the bps partition function of d0-branes bound to a single d4-brane on @xmath83 .",
    "having discussed the number of bps d5-d3-f1 bound states , we can now calculate the bps partition function .",
    "the result we will obtain here is consistent with @xcite , which supports the validity of the ts - duality of the conifold .",
    "to evaluate the bps partition function , we use the following facts :    1 .",
    "bps strings between the d5 and d3-branes with the winding number @xmath47 carry the d0-brane charge @xmath77 .",
    "the possible values of @xmath47 depends on their d2-brane charge @xmath84 , that is , @xmath72 for @xmath74 while @xmath73 for @xmath85 .",
    "we call strings for @xmath86 `` d3-d5 strings '' and those for @xmath75 `` d5-d3 strings .",
    "strings on the d3-brane carry the vanishing d2-brane charge .",
    "their contributions to the partition function has been evaluated as .",
    "the number of fermionic bps states with charge @xmath8 contributes to the witten index @xmath7 with a minus sign .    combining these facts",
    ", we can evaluate the bps partition function in our type iib setup .",
    "let us first evaluate the contribution from the d3-d5 strings .",
    "such strings have the winding number @xmath87 , each of which contributes @xmath88 to the partition function .",
    "recall here that bps d3-d5 strings are spacetime fermions .",
    "in general , we can consider multi - string configurations of such fermionic d3-d5 strings , and therefore the total contributions of the d3-d5 strings to the partition function can be written as @xmath89 similarly , we can evaluate the contributions of the d5-d3 strings .",
    "the only one difference is that the winding number @xmath47 now runs over @xmath90 .",
    "thus , the d5-d3 strings contribute @xmath91 to the partition function .",
    "note that the d5-d3 strings have the different orientation from the d3-d5 strings , and therefore an opposite d2-brane charge @xmath75 .",
    "then , taking these together with the contributions from the d3-d3 strings , we find that the full bps partition function is evaluated as @xmath92 this result agrees with the d4-d2-d0 partition function for @xmath93 .",
    "the limit @xmath93 means that all the walls of marginal stability are crossed when we move the moduli @xmath17 from @xmath30 to @xmath23 .",
    "the reason for this is that we now do not take into account the b - field @xmath94 on the original d4-brane in the type iia side . by taking it into account , in the next subsection",
    ", we will see more concrete correspondence between the type iia and iib sides .",
    "we now examine how the wall - crossing phenomena can be understood in the type iib side . for this purpose ,",
    "let us turn on the b - field along the non - compact cycles in the original type iia side .",
    "as seen in subsection [ subsec : moduli ] , the b - field on the divisor wrapped by the d4-brane can be mapped to the electric field @xmath95 on the dual d3-brane .",
    "such an electric field modifies the bps condition of our d5-d3-f1 system , which leads to different `` slope '' of the fundamental strings stretched between the d5 and d3-branes .",
    "we will see that such a modified iib picture provides a pictorial interpretation of the wall crossing phenomena of our bps states .",
    "let us consider the bps configuration of strings between the d5 and d3-branes under the non - vanishing electric field @xmath95 on the d3-brane .",
    "recall that the world - sheet action of a string coupled to the electric field at its boundary is written as @xmath96 where @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "we set @xmath99 to be the boundary of the string ending on the d3-brane , and therefore @xmath100 takes values in @xmath101 , i.e.  the directions in which our d3-brane is extended . for a constant background field @xmath95 , the gauge potential @xmath102 can be written in a suitable gauge as @xmath103 the variation of the world - sheet action with respect to @xmath104 leads to the boundary condition , and @xmath105 at @xmath99 .",
    "for the other boundary @xmath106 , we impose the neumann boundary condition on @xmath107 and the dirichlet boundary condition on @xmath108 , corresponding to the existence of the d5-brane . ]",
    "@xmath109 which particularly implies @xmath110    from the condition , we find that our bps strings end on the d3-brane with a `` slope '' depending on the electric field @xmath95 .",
    "to see this explicitly , we estimate @xmath111 along the string world - sheet . note that our d5-d3 strings can not have non - vanishing momentum in the @xmath39-direction .",
    "this implies that for bps d5-d3 strings @xmath112 has no @xmath113-dependence .",
    "depends on @xmath113 if and only if it has non - vanishing momentum @xmath114 . ]",
    "therefore , we can identify @xmath111 with @xmath115 for bps d5-d3 strings .",
    "in particular , taking the virasoro constraint @xmath116 into account , this slope can be evaluated at the boundary @xmath99 as @xmath117 this quantity vanishes when @xmath118 , while does not vanish when @xmath119 must be satisfied ] .    the quantity @xmath111 represents the `` slope '' of the bps strings in @xmath120-@xmath39 plane .",

    "since our strings saturate the bps bound and have no excitations , they should have the constant slope along their world - sheets .",

    "thus , the corresponding bps partition function in the @xmath132-th chamber ( @xmath143 ) is now given by @xmath144 in particular , in the limit of @xmath22 , the partition function has no @xmath14-dependence : @xmath145 this is because there is no bps open string stretched between the d5 and d3-branes while only the d3-d3 strings remain stable ( see fig .",

    "all the above results perfectly agree with those obtained by the analysis in the original type iia side , that is , the wall - crossing phenomena of d4-d2-d0 states on the conifold .",
