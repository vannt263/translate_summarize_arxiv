    "this leads to the growth of resonance amplitudes .",
    "on the other hand , the linewidth of resonances becomes bigger , and the quality factor  lower , because attaching good contacts to the stripe increases the dipole radiation of plasmons and hence their radiative decay .",
    "the red shift of modes is caused by screening of the plasmon field by electrons in contacts .    it should be noticed that , quantitatively , the value of the radiative decay and the amplitude of resonances depend on the dielectric properties of the surrounding medium and , in particular , on the shape and dimensions of contacts . in our model",

    "in addition , since in the van der pauw samples the contacts touch the sample edge only in a few small points ( in contrast to our model , figure [ geometry ] ) , one should expect a big difference between the right and left cyclotron resonance ( cr ) absorption peaks .",

    "@xcite to be negligibly small as compared to that at @xmath171 ( due to the condition @xmath172 the plasmon - related shift of the cr line was negligible in @xcite ) .",

    "in contrast , the giant @xmath0-periodic photoresistance oscillations and the zrs effect were found in @xcite to be notably insensitive to the sense of circular polarization .",
    "we believe that this strongly indicates on the _ edge _ or , more exactly , _ near - contact origin _ of these effects .",
    "first , the local field near the contacts is linearly polarized , with the electric field , perpendicular to the edge of the system , at any sense of circular polarization of the incident wave , figures [ eingap ] and [ polariz ] .",
    "second , the field near the edge is _ much _ stronger than that of the incident wave , figure [ eingap ] .",
    "since the photoresistance is a non - linear phenomenon , it will manifest itself , first of all , near the contacts .",
    "third , the near - contact - zrs - origin hypothesis may resolve the plasma - shift paradox @xcite .",
    "assume that there exist not one ( bulk ) but two ( bulk and near - contact ) contributions to the microwave induced photoresistance .",
    "the bulk contribution is sensitive to the circular polarization sense , results from the heating of the electron gas by microwave radiation , and leads to weak resonances at the bulk magnetoplasmon frequencies , which have been observed in the earlier microwave photoresistance experiment @xcite , as well as recently in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the zrs experiments",
    "@xcite the bulk contribution was not visible because it was masked by a bigger edge ( near - contact ) oscillating contribution ( whose specific nature is not clear at present ) , which is insensitive to the circular polarization sense and manifests itself only in very - high mobility samples .",
    "this hypothesis is consistent with that fact that in some zrs experiment @xcite a weak magnetoplasmon - related resonance has been seen on the background of evolving giant photoresistance oscillations .",
    "we have theoretically studied the microwave absorption spectra of a finite - width 2d electron - gas stripe , supplied by two semiinfinite side metallic contacts .",
    "we have shown that at zero magnetic field the presence of the contacts leads to additional radiative broadening of plasmon - polariton resonances , to the growth of their amplitude ( the absorption is growing because the contacts work as antennas ) , and to the red shift of modes .",
    "in finite magnetic field the contacts influence the relative strength of the absorption resonances of the clockwise and counter - clockwise circularly polarized waves . under certain conditions , the inversion of the resonance absorption strengthes for two types of circular polarized waves is predicted .",
    "it would be interesting to observe the effects predicted in this paper , especially the inversion of the absorption maxima in finite magnetic fields at @xmath161 ( figure [ b ] ) , in a direct experiment .",
    "the best possible geometry for such an experiment is , probably , a large corbino disk , as our model is close to it . it would be also interesting to compare absorption spectra in the corbino disk and in a 2d electron ring @xcite .",
