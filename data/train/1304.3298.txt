    "atoms and molecules interacting with a strong laser field may be ionized by absorbing more photons than necessary .",
    "this highly nonlinear phenomenon is called above - threshold ionization ( ati ) and has attracted increasing attention since its 1979 discovery by agostini and co - workers @xcite . recently",
    ", impressive progress has been achieved in the study of ati .",
    "for example , great emphasis has been placed on employing ati as a tool for the attosecond imaging of molecular orbitals @xcite .",
    "imaging applications are based on the physical mechanism behind this phenomenon , in which the active electron ( i ) is released in the continuum , ( ii ) is accelerated by the field , and ( iii ) reaches the detector without returning or after rescattering with its parent molecule .",
    "the former and the latter scenario are known as direct ati , and as rescattered or high - order ati ( hati ) , respectively .",
    "quantum mechanically , this electron may be released along several pathways , and the corresponding transition amplitudes will interfere .",
    "previous studies of ati have shown that for the strong - field ionization of molecules , there are two kinds of quantum interference displayed in the ati spectrum . in the first scenario , for a given energy ,",
    "the electronic wave packet may reach the continuum at events occurring at different times in one cycle of laser field @xcite .",
    "hence , the transition amplitudes associated with ionization along different orbits in the time domain will interfere .",
    "this leads to a fringe structure in the ati spectrum @xcite , which is present regardless of whether the target is an atom or a molecule .",
    "for that reason , we will refer to this type of interference as  temporal interference \" .",
    "recently , ati spectra with unusual two - photon separation in the direction perpendicular to the laser polarization @xcite have been revealed due to the temporal interference .    in the second scenario , due to the multi - core structure of molecules",
    ", there may be electron emission from spatially separated centers , which results in a multi - slit like interference pattern in the ati spectrum . in the context of",
    "linearly polarized fields and diatomic molecules , spatial - interference effects have been widely studied @xcite .",
    "such studies range from simplified molecular models to exact three - dimensional time - dependent calculations . employing the molecular strong - field approximation ( sfa )",
    ", a generalized spatial interference condition for diatomic molecules that accounts for the orbital geometry and @xmath0 mixing has been derived @xcite . for such fields , however , the dynamics are mainly confined along the field polarization axis .",
    "elliptically polarized laser fields exhibit a nonvanishing electric - field component perpendicular to the major polarization axis , which affects the motion of the electron in the laser field .",
    "hence , they have been proposed as a resource for controlling strong - field phenomena by varying the ellipticity .",
    "for example , it is known that elliptical polarization has great significance as a tool to produce isolated attosecond pulses @xcite and to increase the contribution of long orbits in the hati process",
    "@xcite . so far , the ellipticity dependence of ati has been widely studied since the mid 1990s .",
    "most studies , however , focus on the influence of the field ellipticity on the angular dependence of the ionization rate of ati @xcite , while the imprints left on the ati spectrum by a nonvanishing driving - field ellipticity have received little attention .    in an early paper @xcite ,",
    "features related to the above - mentioned temporal interference have been identified experimentally for direct ati .",
    "therein , it was found that the photoelectron yield as a function of the driving - field ellipticity behaves in two very distinct ways for hati and direct ati energy ranges .",
    "while in the former case this yield decreases monotonically for larger driving field ellipticity , following the predictions of classical models , for direct ati the electron ellipticity distributions display several  shoulder \" structures .",
    "these structures have been related to the quantum temporal interference between the two sets of orbits that contribute to ati in this energy region .",
    "however , how the ellipticity influences the two orbits still remains unexplored to a great extent .    in this work ,",
    "we are interested in how the driving - field ellipticity influences the above - mentioned two kinds of interferences in the ati spectra of diatomic molecules , exemplified by n@xmath1 and ar@xmath1 . throughout",
    ", we focus on direct ati , for which temporal interference effects are also prominent . employing the molecular sfa and saddle - point methods , we find that , in general , the temporal interference in the ati spectra will become blurred in the elliptically polarized field . for electron momenta along the major polarization axis , however , the temporal interference remains clear and the positions of the interference minima shift towards lower photoelectron energies with increasing ellipticity .",
    "these features are well explained in terms of the ellipticity dependence of the initial electron velocity along each orbit , and we show that the downshift of the interference minima is responsible for the  shoulder \" structure observed in the ellipticity distributions of ati electrons in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "furthermore , for the spatial interference , clear interference minima which do not depend on the ellipticity are found for n@xmath2 if only @xmath3 or @xmath4 states are taken .",
    "however , if @xmath0 mixing is introduced , sharp fringes are only present for linear polarization if the molecule is aligned perpendicular to the field axis . for all other cases ,",
    "these minima are blurred even for linear polarization .",
    "for ar@xmath2 , the ati spectra display several clear minima caused by the spatial interference .",
    "the reasons for the differences between n@xmath1 and ar@xmath1 molecules are discussed in detail in terms of the shapes of their highest occupied molecular orbitals ( homo ) . in this view",

    "[ ati_sp](c ) ] , the minima from the temporal interference are blurred as discussed in the previous section , but the minima from the two - center interference are still very clear .",
    "that is because the two - center interference condition , eq .",
    "( [ sstate ] ) , is given for field - dressed initial bound states @xcite .",
    "in this case , it is independent on the ellipticity .",
    "similarly , for the @xmath4-state contributions , the two - center interference minima appear in the middle of the each panel in figs .",
    "[ ati_sp](b ) and ( d ) , because the corresponding electron momentum is perpendicular to the molecular axis , i.e. , @xmath156 .",
    "hence , the interference condition , eq .",
    "( [ pstate ] ) , always holds .",
    "however , when we consider the full @xmath153 homo of the n@xmath1 molecule and include @xmath0 mixing , the minima from the two - center interference can not be observed in the ati spectra .",

    "[ fig1](c ) , ( b ) , ( e ) , and ( f ) .",

    "first , if @xmath0 mixing is included , the interference condition also depends on the sum of @xmath157 in eq .",
    "( [ prefactor2 ] ) , where @xmath38 .",
    "this influence is expected to be considerable for @xmath158 , as its @xmath159 homo has a high degree of @xmath0 mixing .",
    "second , the ionization time @xmath27 has a positive imaginary part , which can be related to the width of the barrier through which the electron must initially tunnel @xcite .",
    "thus , the sum in eq .",
    "( [ prefactor2 ] ) is usually not purely real or imaginary , and therefore , the absolute value of eq .",
    "( [ prefactor2 ] ) will never completely vanish , i.e. , no clear minima will be observed in the ati spectra .",

    "( c ) and ( d ) ati spectra obtained by employing only individual orbits in the ( @xmath161 , @xmath151 ) for @xmath71 .",
    "the white curves indicate the minima caused by the two - center interference . ]",
    "nevertheless , there is a specific case in which clear spatial interference fringes are present in the full ati spectra of n@xmath2 , if @xmath0 mixing is included .",
    "[ ati_sp_90](a ) shows the spectra for linear polarization with the alignment angle @xmath160 .",
    "apart from the minima from the temporal interference , there are two other minima . in order to show them more clearly",
    ", we calculate the ati transition probability density @xmath92 by employing only individual orbits to remove the pattern associated with the temporal interference . figs .",
    "[ ati_sp_90](c ) and ( d ) display the ati spectra without the temporal interference , where the clear minima from the spatial interference are observed .",
    "the reason for the appearance of the spatial interference in this specific case is that for the perpendicular alignment @xmath162 and for linear polarization , the ionization prefactor in eq .",
    "( [ prefactor3 ] ) can be simplified as @xmath163 where the momentum @xmath164 in the @xmath165 direction is real .",
    "thus , @xmath166 can be factorized in both the first and the second terms in eq .",
    "( [ prefactor4 ] ) , and the remaining terms are time - independent and purely real . using eq .",
    "( [ prefactor4 ] ) , we obtain the minima from the destructive spatial interference in the ati spectra , shown by the white curves in figs .",
    "[ ati_sp_90](a ) , ( c ) , and ( d ) , which agree well with what is observed in the spectra . on the other hand , for elliptical polarization , the imaginary parts in the two terms in eq .",
    "( [ prefactor3 ] ) are different .",
    "hence , they can not be factorized and the absolute value of eq .",
    "( [ prefactor2 ] ) will never vanish .",
    "this is also the case if the field is linearly polarized , but @xmath167 , as seen from eq .",
    "( [ prefactor4 ] ) .",
    "[ ati_sp_90](b ) shows that as the ellipticity increases to @xmath78 , the minima from both the spatial and temporal interference in the spectra fade .",
    "molecule , with internuclear distance @xmath155 a.u .",
    ", coded in false colors in the ( @xmath69 , @xmath151 ) plane .",
    "the major axis of the polarization ellipse is along the molecular axis , @xmath73 . the results in panels ( a ) and ( b ) have been computed for ellipticity @xmath71 and @xmath72 , respectively .",
    "the minima caused by the two - center interference are indicated by white curves .",
    "the remaining field parameters are the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . ]    in contrast , the ati spectra of the ar@xmath1 molecule present clear minima from the two - center interference , as seen in fig .",
    "[ ar2](a ) .",
    "in addition , fig .",
    "[ ar2](b ) shows that , with increasing ellipticity , most minima from the temporal interference are blurred .",
    "however , the spatial minima remain unaltered .",
    "the critical reason for the difference between ar@xmath2 and n@xmath2 molecules is that , in the @xmath154 homo of ar@xmath1 , the contributions of the @xmath4 states dominate and the contributions of the @xmath3 states are practically vanishing for the internuclear separation in this work .",
    "hence , the corresponding two - center interference condition is given by eq .",
    "( [ sstate ] ) , which holds for _ pure _ @xmath4 states and ungerade symmetry .",
    "this condition , shown by the white lines in fig .",
    "[ ar2 ] , is independent of the driving field and is consistent with the interference minima in the simulation .",
    "furthermore , since ar@xmath2 has a very large equilibrium internuclear distance , @xmath155 a.u .",
    ", several two - center minima are observed in the momentum range of interest according to eq .",
    "( [ sstate ] ) .",
    "in summary , we theoretically study temporal and spatial interference in the direct ati spectra of aligned diatomic molecules in an elliptically polarized laser field .",
    "temporal interference relates to ionization events occurring at different times within a field cycle , and spatial interference is associated with electron ionization at spatially separated centers in the molecule . throughout , we have employed the molecular sfa , saddle - point methods and field - dressed bound states .",
    "we have also assumed that only the homo is active .",
    "with increasing ellipticity , there will be a blurring of the temporal - interference patterns , except when the photoelectron momenta @xmath111 are parallel to the major polarization axis .",
    "this blurring is caused by the fact that a nonvanishing driving field ellipticity affects the electron velocities unequally for the two ionization events occurring within each field cycle .",
    "for linear polarization , these events are equally probable . in order , however , to compensate the motion induced by the small component of the elliptically polarized field , it is necessary that , for one of the orbits , the electron be released in the continuum with a larger velocity .",
    "this will lead to a suppression of the corresponding ionization probability , and hence to a disappearance of the temporal interference patterns .",
    "nevertheless , if the electron is released along the major polarization axis , the absolute value of the initial velocity will be the same for the two ionization events .",
    "hence , the temporal - interference minima in the ati spectrum will remain clear . for these specific parameters ,",
    "we have analyzed in detail how a non - vanishing ellipticity shifts these minima towards lower energies , and have traced them to a decrease in the phase difference between the transition amplitudes related to both orbits .",
    "these results are in agreement with the studies performed in @xcite .",
    "our results also show that , in general , the spatial , two center interference is much more robust with regard to the electric field parameters than the temporal interference , as long as the homo does not exhibit a high degree of @xmath0 mixing . as a consequence of @xmath0 mixing , however , or of the temporal dependence of the ionization prefactor eq .",
    "( [ prefactor2 ] ) , the interference patterns become blurred , even for linear polarization . only for the very specific case of linear polarization and a molecule aligned perpendicular to the field direction",
    "will sharp fringes be observed .",
    "this is exemplified by computations in n@xmath2 . on the other hand ,",
    "if either @xmath3 or @xmath4 states are dominant in the homo , the patterns will be very clear over a large parameter range and practically independent of the driving - field ellipticity .",
    "this is shown for the ati spectra of ar@xmath1 , which display clear spatial - interference patterns due to fact that the @xmath4-state contributions are dominant .",
    "several minima exist due to the large equilibrium internuclear distance .",
    "therefore , one can trace all the interference patterns observed , or the absence thereof , to the dynamics of the electronic wave packet and the velocity with which it is released in the continuum .",
    "these patterns can be controlled by an appropriate choice of the the field and molecular parameters .",
    "concrete examples provided in this work include the laser - field polarization , the molecular targets , the angle between the electron momentum and the major polarization axis , and the molecular orientation with regard to the field .",
    "this control is related to the energy position and to the sharpness of the patterns .",
    "we also identify a parameter region , for which clear interference fringes can be easily observed .",
