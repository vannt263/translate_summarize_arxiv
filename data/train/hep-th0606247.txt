    "minimal surfaces , i.e.  surfaces of minimal area with specified boundary conditions , are found in many areas of physics , mathematics and biology . their existence , uniqueness and other properties ( such as possible singularities or stability )",
    "are still actively studied by mathematicians @xcite . in the laboratory , minimal surfaces are most commonly realized as soap films bounded by a given wire - frame , a problem discussed already in 1873 by plateau @xcite . in some cases their morphology and stability have actually been elucidated experimentally in this context @xcite .",
    "other systems where minimal surfaces play a role include lipid - water solutions , diblock copolymers , crystallography , protein structure , or liquid crystals such as smectics @xcite .",
    "they also arise as world - sheet instantons in string theory , for example in the semiclassical , fixed - angle high - energy limit of scattering amplitudes @xcite .",
    "0.5 mm the minimal surfaces that will interest us here arise in the problem of partial wetting of a solid by a liquid @xcite . in the standard experimental situation , a liquid with free surface of area @xmath0 ( liquid - air interface ) wets a flat solid plane over an area @xmath1 ( liquid - solid interface ) .",
    "the free surface meets the solid plane along a line , called _ contact line _",
    ", at an angle @xmath2 which is defined locally .",
    "the interfacial energy is the difference @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the energy per unit area ( or surface tension ) of the liquid - air interface , and @xmath5 is the difference in surface tension between the solid - air ( sa ) and the solid - liquid ( sl ) interfaces .",
    "the force per unit length pushing a segment of the contact line towards the unwetted region is thus @xmath6 .",
    "requiring that it vanishes gives young s @xcite local equilibrium condition , @xmath7 .",
    "the minimal - surface problem at hand is thus a problem with _ mixed neumann and dirichlet _ boundary conditions . in the idealized",
    "setting of an infinite liquid container and a perfectly homogeneous planar wall , there exists a simple solution to this problem : it is a planar liquid - air interface meeting the wall along a straight contact line .",
    "strictly - speaking , as we will discuss in section [ s:2 ] , the properties of the container at infinity must be carefully chosen in order not to destabilize this solution .",
    "0.5 mm    two extra forces play in fact a role in the general formulation of the wetting problem .",
    "the first comes from the drop in pressure across the liquid - air interface , which adds to the gibbs energy a volume term : @xmath8 . here",
    "@xmath9 is the pressure difference and @xmath10 the volume of the fluid .",
    "the free surfaces that minimize this energy have constant rather than vanishing mean curvature @xcite .",
    "it is quite remarkable that the corresponding equations are ( at least formally ) integrable , see for instance @xcite .",
    "note that in the special case of an incompressible fluid , @xmath9 is a lagrange multiplier determined by the constraint that the `` droplet '' volume @xmath10 be fixed .",
    "the second force that plays in general a role is gravity , which introduces an additional scale , the capillary length @xmath11 . here",
    "@xmath12 is the fluid mass density , and @xmath13 is the gravitational acceleration . in this paper",
    "we will study situations where both pressure and gravity can be ignored .",
    "this is usually valid if one concentrates on length scales @xmath14 , and considers a fluid connected to an infinite reservoir so that effectively @xmath15 .",
    "note that the capillary length is typically of the order of a few millimeters , but it can be made much larger in free - fall ( e.g. space - based ) experiments , or if one replaces the air by a second non - mixing fluid of roughly equal mass density . thus setting @xmath16 is a good approximation in a wide range of experimentally - feasible situations , and we will do so in this paper . technically , one can further justify that gravity be ignored _ at all scales _ if a condition , identified below , is satisfied .",
    "0.5 mm what is in fact more questionable is the assumption of a perfectly homogeneous wall . indeed , in most of the experimental setups of wetting , roughness and impurities of the solid substrate couple directly to the position of the contact line , which may as a result be effectively pinned . computing the energy of a _",
    "deformed _ contact line is thus a question of foremost importance .",
    "for small deformations , as joanny and de gennes ( jdg ) have shown @xcite , the contact line obeys _ non - local linear elasticity_. these linear equations may become unstable at wavelengths comparable to some global - geometry scale , as several earlier studies have established @xcite .",
    "the issue of non - linear elasticity , which becomes relevant for larger deformations , has been addressed only recently @xcite .",
    "it could play a role @xcite in resolving the apparent disagreement between recent experimental measurements of contact - line roughness @xcite , and renormalization - group calculations near the depinning transition @xcite or numerical simulations @xcite that were based on the jdg linear theory @xcite . to be sure",
    ", hysteresis and other dynamical phenomena , which have attracted much of the recent attention @xcite , may also prove important in interpreting the above experimental data .",
    "nevertheless , a systematic analysis should start with a thorough understanding of the non - linear and possibly non - local effects in the simpler , equilibrium situation .",
    "this is the problem that we will study here .",
    "0.5 mm    the area of a minimal surface bounded by a given ( closed ) curve is simple when expressed in conformal coordinates .",
    "non - linearities arise because this choice of coordinates depends non - trivially on the boundary curve , through the conformal - gauge ( or virasoro ) conditions . in this paper",
    "we develop systematic methods for solving the ensuing non - local and non - linear equations , either in perturbation theory or numerically .",
    "we focus , in particular , on the case of a planar wall , and derive simple diagrammatic rules that calculate the energy of a deformed contact line to any given order in the deformation amplitude .",
    "the method can be extended to more complicated container geometries , but the details become more involved . as a relatively simple illustration ,",
    "we show how to extend the rules , and calculate the jdg linear theory , in the case of two contact lines lying on parallel opposite walls .",
    "we also describe a novel algorithm which finds the minimal surface energy with no need for surface triangulation .",
    "finally , we discuss some general properties of these perturbative expansions , which bear a fascinating similarity to problems encountered in perturbative string theory .",
    "we hope to return to some of these questions , as well as to the implications of our results for the wetting problem , in a future publication .    0.5 mm    the paper is organized as follows : in section [ s:2 ]",
    "we describe our basic model , point out the need for global tadpole cancellation , and discuss the relation of the mixed neumann / dirichlet to the pure dirichlet problem . in section [ s:3 ]",
    "we give the formal solution of the latter problem , for an arbitrary boundary curve , in terms of conformal coordinates .",
    "this is standard material which is included here for completeness . in section [ s:4 ]",
    "we specialize to the case of a planar wall , derive the corresponding non - linear boundary equations , and express the energy in terms of their solution .",
    "we pay particular attention to the decoupling of the large - volume cutoff , which as we will explain is rather subtle . in section [ s:5 ]",
    "we solve the boundary equations perturbatively , and compute the corrections to the jdg energy , up to quartic order .",
    "section [ s:6 ] describes an alternative approach , using lagrange - multiplier fields and leading to a simple diagrammatic representation of the perturbative expansion .",
    "the numerical algorithm is presented in section [ s : c ] . in section [ s:7 ]",
    "we extend this to the case of two parallel walls , and calculate the quadratic interaction of the contact lines .",
    "finally , in section [ s:8 ] we establish the finiteness of the perturbative expansion order by order , and point out some intriguing directions for future work .",
    "the weierstrass parameterization of our fluid surfaces , a calculation confirming the decoupling of the large - volume cutoff are described , respectively , in appendices [ s : weierstrass ] and [ s : b ] .",
    "we consider a fluid inside a tubular container @xmath17 , where @xmath18 corresponds to the height coordinate @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is some ( a priori arbitrary ) connected region in the @xmath21 plane , with boundary @xmath22 .",
    "let us for now assume that the fluid surface has no overhangs  it can then be parameterized by the height function @xmath23 .",
    "we may express the energy functional as the following sum of two - dimensional bulk and boundary terms : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the infinitesimal length along the boundary of @xmath20 .",
    "the first term in ( [ grl ] ) is the fluid - air interfacial energy @xmath26 , the second is due to the difference in pressure between air and fluid , the third to gravity , while the last comes from the fluid - solid interface . for convenience , we have slightly generalized the model so that the tension of this interface may vary along the container walls , as can be done by design .",
    "the more general case of a @xmath27 depending on both @xmath28 and @xmath19 , due for instance to the presence of impurities , will be discussed below . for",
    "now @xmath27 is only a function of @xmath28 .    in the absence of gravity @xmath29 ,",
    "the minimum of the energy @xmath30 is a surface of constant mean curvature , with specified contact angles : @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 is a unit vector normal to the boundary @xmath34 .",
    "these non - linear equations do not always admit a global solution , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "a necessary ( but not sufficient ) condition for a solution to exist is @xmath35 this is a condition of _ average - force cancellation _ : indeed , the left - hand side of the above equation couples linearly to the zero mode of @xmath23 , and would lead to a runaway solution if it did not vanish , the energy being unbounded in that case . by analogy with string theory we may refer to this as a global tadpole cancellation condition .",
    "note , in particular , that for a homogeneous wall , for which @xmath27 is constant , one must fine tune the ratio of perimeter to area so that it equals @xmath36 . if the average - force condition is satisfied , the average height of the fluid surface becomes a free dynamical parameter of the solution , analogous to the string - theoretic _",
    "moduli_. its role must be examined with care as it threatens a priori the stability of any perturbative expansion at weak disorder , and may thus lead to qualitatively new behavior . 0.5 mm    the emergence of condition ( [ tadp ] ) clearly originates from the neglect of gravity . if @xmath37 , it is easy to see that the energy is always bounded from below and that the fluid will tend to rise such that @xmath38 , the well known capillarity effect . hence if @xmath39 is non zero , one expects that the theory studied here , obtained setting @xmath29 , breaks down for wavevectors @xmath40 ( hence especially for the zero mode ) . however , the interesting point , discussed below , is that if one imposes @xmath41 then one can safely set @xmath29 and obtain a theory which is well defined at all scales .",
    "this is the theory studied here .",
    "it is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f : compcoord ] .",
    "let us consider minimizing the energy in two steps : we first solve the bulk equations keeping the contact line fixed , i.e.  we find the surface of constant mean curvature , @xmath42 , such that the restriction of @xmath43 to @xmath34 is a given function @xmath44 .",
    "we denote the corresponding bulk energy ( or reduced energy functional in the language of @xcite ) by @xmath45:={\\cal e}_{\\rm bulk}(z_h)$ ] .",
    "the energy of the equilibrium configuration is then the minimum over all contact lines of @xmath46 - \\oint_{\\partial\\omega}\\ , \\gamma^\\prime \\ , h\\ .\\ ] ] thus @xmath27 plays the role of a source , and the minimum energy is just the _ legendre transform _ of the reduced energy functional .",
    "if @xmath27 were to depend also on @xmath19 , the source would be field - dependent .",
    "we will comment on the subtleties of this legendre transformation between the dirichlet and neumann problems in the concluding section .    , it is flat and perpendicular to the gravitational field ( left ) . enlargement for distances smaller than @xmath47 ( right ) which is the range of scales studied here .",
    "the unperturbed surface is a plane , making an angle @xmath48 with the wall .",
    "when perturbed , the conformal parameters @xmath49 approach cartesian coordinates far from the wall , as discussed in section [ s:4].,scaledwidth=65.0% ]    0.5 mm    let us describe the simplest configuration studied here , which consists of a semi - infinite fluid bounded by a homogeneous planar wall at @xmath50 .",
    "we assume from now on that @xmath51 , and that the container at infinity has been adjusted so that the global tadpole condition is satisfied .",
    "the unperturbed fluid surface is then an inclined plane , making a contact angle  @xmath52 with the wall , as illustrated in figure 1 .",
    "we are choosing the origin of coordinates so that the unperturbed fluid surface intersects the wall along @xmath53 , while the perturbed contact line is given by @xmath54 .",
    "it turns out to be convenient for the following to define : @xmath55 \\ , \\equiv\\ ,    e[h ] - e[0 ]   -   \\gamma\\cos\\theta_0 \\int_y   h    \\ ,",
    "\\ ] ] if the contact line deformations are concentrated in a finite region one expects this energy difference to also be concentrated in a finite region , and the outer boundaries of the container to decouple . more generally , the simple planar model of figure [ f : compcoord ] should give an adequate description of the physics if all other distance scales of the system ( including the capillary length , @xmath56 , and all geometric scales ) are much larger than the typical deformation wavelength",
    "we will come back to this subtle issue later on .",
    "note that we have included in the energy difference the contribution , @xmath57 , of the homogeneous wall .",

    "let us briefly mention the case of impurity disorder . in this case translation symmetry of the tube",
    "is in general broken by the roughness of the wall .",
    "the effect of impurities can then be modeled by a variable fluid - solid tension , and the boundary term in ( [ grl ] ) becomes : @xmath60 the two stage minimization can then be summarized as follows .",

    "we will use expressions such as pinning condition , or pinned configuration in the following only to denote the fixed-@xmath66 conditions .",
    "computing the area of a minimal surface bounded by a continuous closed curve @xmath67 is a classical problem of applied mathematics . in this section",
    "we will explain how , in conformal gauge , it reduces to a ( non - linear and non - local ) equation for a function of one variable on the boundary .",
    "let @xmath68 be an arbitrary parameterization of the surface , i.e.  @xmath69 is the position of the surface @xmath70 corresponding to the values of the two ( a priori arbitrarily - chosen ) parameters @xmath49 .",
    "we will assume that @xmath70 has the topology of a disk , and that the parameterization is global , i.e.  that there is a one - to - one correspondence between points of @xmath70 and points in some parameter domain @xmath71 .",
    "one should of course keep in mind that , for some boundary curves , these assumptions may have to be relaxed . in terms of the induced metric @xmath72 ,",
    "the area of @xmath70 reads : @xmath73 this expression is invariant under any reparametrization with non - vanishing jacobian , i.e.  @xmath74 and @xmath75 with @xmath76 . for a surface without ` overhangs ' we may use this freedom to set @xmath77 , in which case ( [ area ] ) reduces to the expression for the area used in eq .",
    "( [ grl ] ) .",
    "this is a useful parameterization when @xmath78 and @xmath79 are small , but more generally the minimization of the area in this gauge leads to non - linear partial differential equations in two variables , which are hard to solve .",
    "a more convenient choice is conformal coordinates , which are defined implicitly by the two conditions  : @xmath80 put in words , the two vector fields tangent to the surface are orthogonal everywhere and of equal , not necessarily constant , length .",
    "[ as the reader can easily verify , the parameterization @xmath81 is conformal only in the special case of constant @xmath19 . ]",
    "it follows from ( [ conf1n ] ) that @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the so - called `` conformal factor '' .",
    "thus in this gauge the area can be written as @xmath84 and the variational equations are the laplace equations in two dimensions  : @xmath85 the embedding coordinates @xmath86 are therefore harmonic functions of @xmath49 , and can be written as the real parts of analytic functions of the complex variable @xmath87  : @xmath88 this property of harmonic functions is very special to two dimensions .",
    "our problem is now to determine @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 for the given boundary curve @xmath67 .    to this end ,",
    "note first that if the surface is non - singular and bounded , the functions @xmath92 and @xmath91 must be analytic in the interior of the domain @xmath93 .",
    "they are furthermore related by the two conformal - gauge conditions ( [ conf1n ] ) , which can be combined in the following equivalent form  : @xmath94 where the prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath95 .",
    "this rewriting makes manifest the residual freedom of analytic reparametrizations of @xmath95 .",
    "such complex - analytic changes of coordinates preserve indeed the conformal condition ( [ conf4n ] ) , and can be used to map the parameter domain to any convenient simply - connected region in @xmath96 .",
    "let us assume , for instance , that @xmath97 is the unit disk .",
    "we write @xmath98 , and denote by @xmath99 the boundary curve parameterized by the special conformal coordinate @xmath100 .",
    "note that @xmath101 has a unique harmonic extension to the interior of the disk , and thus determines unambiguously the minimal surface .",
    "this follows easily from the fact that the analytic function @xmath102 admits a taylor expansion @xmath103 so that its restriction to the boundary has no negative - frequency fourier modes , when identifying @xmath104 .",
    "thus , to extend @xmath105 to the interior of the disk , we need only split it into positive- and negative - frequency parts , @xmath106 . then @xmath107 can be extended to @xmath102 by the replacement @xmath108 , while @xmath109 extends to the complex - conjugate anti - analytic function @xmath110 .",
    "if @xmath105 has a zero mode , it must be split equally between the two parts .",
    "a simple calculation leads in fact to the following cauchy relation between @xmath102 and the boundary restriction of @xmath111 : @xmath112 similar relations hold of course between @xmath113 and @xmath114 , and also @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "it is , furthermore , easy to check that since @xmath117 , the conformal - gauge condition ( [ conf4n ] ) is equivalent to @xmath118\\ .\\ ] ]    let us go back now to the expression ( [ ng1n ] ) for the area . if the surface is minimal , integrating by parts and using laplace s equation allows to rewrite its area as a boundary integral : @xmath119 the integrand involves the radial derivative of @xmath120 , but with the help of cauchy s equation ( @xmath121 , and similarly for the functions @xmath90 and @xmath91 ) we can convert this to an angular derivative , with the result : @xmath122 here @xmath123 is the fourier transform of the function on the circle @xmath124 . for later use ,",
    "we also give two alternative ( equivalent ) expressions for the minimal area : @xmath125 the first can be obtained from eq .",
    "( [ secv ] ) by fourier transform , while the second follows by a double integration by parts and the fact that , thanks to the @xmath126 prescription , only the cross term in the numerator contributes .",
    "note that for suitably smooth @xmath127 these integrals are manifestly finite in the @xmath128 region ( hence the @xmath129 can be dropped in the final expression - but not if one expands the square ) .",
    "0.5 mm    we have thus succeeded to express the minimal area as an explicit ( non - local , but quadratic ) functional of @xmath101 , so one may think that our problem is effectively solved .",
    "this is , however , not quite the case , because the transformation from the original parameter of the boundary , to the special conformal coordinate @xmath100 , depends itself non - trivially on the boundary curve . to make this relation explicit ,",
    "let us write @xmath130 , so that @xmath131 . a straightforward calculation starting from the integral expression ( [ intt ] )",
    "gives @xmath132 plugging this in the gauge condition ( [ cgc ] ) leads to a non - linear integral equation , that can be used ( in principle ) to determine @xmath133 for any given boundary curve @xmath67 .",
    "this is still a non - trivial task , but we have at least reduced the minimal - surface problem to one involving only one unknown function of a single variable . in some cases ,",
    "the problem can be simplified further by using the residual freedom of conformal transformations to map the unit disk to a suitably - chosen domain .",
    "such is the case when the contact line lies on a plane , as we will now see .",
    "in the configuration of fig.1 the contact line is restricted to a planar wall , located at @xmath50 . assuming that it has no overhangs , such a contact line is naturally parameterized by the height function @xmath134 .",
    "we want to adapt our previous general discussion to this special situation .",
    "the story is somewhat simplified by using the convenient conformal coordinates ( reminiscent of the proper - time gauge of string theory ) : @xmath135 here @xmath136 is a positive constant , and we have traded @xmath49 for the lighter notation @xmath137 . in imposing ( [ choice ] ) we have used the residual freedom of conformal transformations , and the fact that @xmath89 is an analytic function .",
    "note , however , that this choice of gauge might be obstructed globally , as we will explain in appendix a. since the fluid surface extends out to infinity , the new parameter domain is the upper - half complex plane , @xmath138 .",
    "later we will consider a second wall at @xmath139 , in which case @xmath93 will be the infinite strip @xmath140 .",
    "the points at infinity must actually be treated with care : the right procedure is to first make @xmath93 finite , by bounding the fluid with outer walls , then move these outer boundaries to infinity",
    ".    we will be here interested in surfaces that approach asymptotically the inclined plane @xmath141 it is therefore convenient to choose @xmath142 , and to define the difference @xmath143 note that the gauge condition ( [ choice ] ) ensures that the first component of @xmath144 is identically zero . since the components of both @xmath120 and @xmath145 are harmonic , so are those of their difference @xmath144 .",
    "we can in fact write @xmath146 and @xmath147 , where the new analytic functions are given by @xmath148 following the same logic as in section [ s:3 ] , we also define the restrictions of @xmath149 and @xmath150 to the real axis , @xmath151 and @xmath152 . the extension of these functions to the upper - half plane",
    "is uniquely determined by the property that they should be both bounded and harmonic .",
    "indeed , the analytic function @xmath153 must have a fourier - laplace expansion involving only positive - frequency modes : @xmath154 since it would otherwise diverge when @xmath155 .",
    "thus , to extend @xmath156 to the upper - half plane , we must first split it into its positive- and negative - frequency parts , @xmath157 , then extend @xmath158 analytically and @xmath159 as its complex - conjugate anti - analytic function .",
    "the cauchy integral formula relating @xmath160 and @xmath156 reads @xmath161 the right - hand side is analytic in the upper - half complex plane provided that @xmath162 vanishes at infinity .",
    "of course a similar formula relates also @xmath163 to its analytic counterpart @xmath164 .",
    "our problem is thus reduced to that of finding the two real functions on the real axis , @xmath163 and @xmath156 .",
    "these are related by the pinning condition of the contact line : @xmath165 furthermore , they must obey the conformal constraint ( [ conf4n ] ) . after inserting the expressions ( [ logic ] ) , and using the obvious identities @xmath166 and @xmath167 , this constraint reads : @xmath168 the pair of coupled , non - local equations ( [ bc1n ] ) and ( [ constr ] ) is in principle sufficient to determine @xmath169 and @xmath156 , and hence also the complete shape of the fluid surface . in the following sections we will discuss how to solve these equations numerically , or by a series expansion in powers of @xmath59 .",

    "the factor @xmath188 , with @xmath189 a derivative in the direction normal to @xmath190 , is the jacobian that arises upon converting @xmath191 to a @xmath192-function in parameter space .",

    "the next term in the above quadratic energy corresponds to an elastic rod with effective tension @xmath438 .",
    "this has also a simple geometric interpretation : the rod is in fact a thin strip , of width @xmath434 , which is deformed by an amount@xmath439 in the transverse direction .",
    "in the previous sections we have shown how to calculate the energy of a deformed , almost rectilinear , contact line to any desired order in perturbation theory .",
    "we would now like to discuss some general properties of this expansion .",
    "one important point is that perturbation theory is _ quasi - local _ ,",
    "i.e.  the total energy is concentrated in a region of size equal to the typical wavelength of the deformation .",
    "we indeed saw that , as long as the large - volume cutoff has been fine - tuned so as to cancel the global tadpole , it decouples from any localized perturbation .",
    "one would expect the same to be true for all other geometric length scales of the system , such as the wall s inverse curvature .",
    "if this is true , at sufficiently short distances perturbation theory should be scale - covariant , as was pointed out in section [ s:5 ] . in momentum space ,",
    "the scaling symmetry ( [ rescale ] ) reads : @xmath440\\ , = \\",
    "\\lambda^2 \\ , \\tilde e[h]\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ { \\rm for}\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ h^{(\\lambda)}_{\\ , k } = \\lambda^2 \\ , h_{\\lambda k}\\ .\\ ] ] inspection of eqs .",
    "( [ a6])([endd ] ) shows that this indeed holds at each order of the expansion , and even for each individual diagram .",
    "note , in passing , that the scaling symmetry does not imply conformal invariance , as would have been the case if the one - dimensional theory were truly local .",
    "0.5 mm    finiteness of the jdg quadratic energy requires that @xmath441 in other words , @xmath59 must be continuous everywhere and finite , and it must vanish as @xmath171 .",
    "a more stringent condition is , in fact , required to prove ultraviolet finiteness at all higher orders .",
    "it reads @xmath442 stated differently , the profile function @xmath59 must also have a continuous first derivative . that this is indeed necessary follows by considering for instance the `` comb '' diagrams , the first few being ( [ a10 ] ) , ( [ e6n ] ) and ( [ e8n ] ) . as the reader can check , a power fall - off slower than ( [ fallo ] )",
    "would make the comb diagrams with a large enough number of vertices diverge . to show that this condition is also sufficient ,",
    "it is convenient to assign the scaling dimensions @xmath443= 1 $ ] and @xmath444 = -2 $ ] to the factors entering in a diagram . because @xmath445 at high momentum , the degree of divergence of any partial integration is bounded from above by the corresponding scaling dimension , in which one only counts elements that depend on the integrated momenta .",
    "the scaling symmetry ( [ virt ] ) implies that the overall scaling dimension of any tree diagram is @xmath271 , so there is no divergence from the integration region where all the momenta go to infinity .",
    "keeping one ( or more ) of the momenta fixed amounts to removing from the counting a factor @xmath446 , and at most one solid and @xmath447 curly propagators that emanate from the corresponding vertex .",
    "this can only lower the scaling dimension , so all the partial integrations are also ultraviolet finite . _",
    "q.e.d_.    0.5 mm infrared finiteness is trickier to establish diagrammatically",
    ". condition ( [ falloff ] ) suffices to ensure that there is no divergence when the momenta flowing into individual vertices go to zero .",
    "the dangerous diagrams are , however , those for which such momenta _ add up _ to zero along some curly line .",
    "inspection of the expression ( [ inspect ] ) shows , nevertheless , that the result is finite up to quartic order , thanks to the heaviside functions that multiply such dangerous terms . to prove finiteness at all higher orders , it is more convenient to go back to the pair of classical equations ( [ bc1n ] ) and ( [ constr ] )",
    ". let @xmath448 and @xmath449 be the solutions of these equations at @xmath319th order .",
    "it is then straightforward to check that , if these functions vanish at @xmath171 for all @xmath450 , they will continue to do so for @xmath451 .",
    "this is in turn sufficient to guarantee the infrared finiteness of the energy at all orders .",
    "0.5 mm    what about non - perturbative effects ? to fix ideas ,",
    "let @xmath361 with @xmath362 a given profile function , and @xmath363 the parameter controlling the perturbative expansion .",
    "one expects that the radius of convergence of this expansion is finite , since at large enough @xmath363 the solution to eqs .",
    "( [ bc1n ] ) and ( [ constr ] ) should stop being analytic .",
    "this could signal either one of the following two things : ( i ) that our parameterization is singular , or ( ii ) that the surface develops real geometric singularities or that there is a change in topology .",
    "it would be very interesting to find some general criteria which could distinguish between these two possibilities .",
    "note that a topological transition may occur if it is energetically favorable to drill two holes in the fluid surface , and to replace the corresponding disks by a cylinder .",
    "in any case , the following simple ( though rather crude ) linear bound @xmath55\\ ,",
    "< \\ , \\gamma \\int_y \\ , \\vert h\\vert \\ , + \\ , \\bigl\\vert \\gamma^\\prime \\int_y\\ , h\\ , \\bigr\\vert\\ ] ] shows that the energy of a pinned contact line stays finite .",
    "furthermore , localized microscopic perturbations always have a vanishingly - small energy , and should decouple from the physics at longer scales .",
    "0.5 mm    this brings us to our final remark @xcite : as was explained in section [ s:2 ] , the purely - dirichlet minimal surface problem is related to the mixed dirichlet - neumann problem , relevant for capillary phenomena , by a legendre transformation .",
    "a legendre transformation looks at first sight rather benign , but it drastically modifies the nature of perturbation theory .",
    "this is best illustrated by the following spectacular phenomenon @xcite : a wedge in the tubular contour @xmath34 of section [ s:2 ] , with opening angle less than @xmath452 , is a local geometric obstruction which forces the capillary surface to develop a second sheet .",
    "this has been observed in micro - gravity experiments .",
    "notice that the wedge can be of microscopic transverse size , but it should extend to all values of the height coordinate @xmath19 .",
    "it is the latter assumption which is responsible for the apparent non - decoupling of short - distance scales .",
    "the story is reminiscent of the role played by wormholes in theories of quantum gravity .",
    "this analogy , as well as the possible impact of wedge defects on the problem of wetting , deserve further investigation .",

    "this is indeed the case in perturbation theory , but more generally , for a given analytic @xmath454 , the solution of ( [ constr ] ) will not give an analytic function @xmath153 . a constructive solution of the conformal - gauge condition , that guarantees analyticity , is given by the weierstrass representation    @xmath455    where @xmath456 and @xmath457 are holomorphic functions in the upper - half plane . to go to the special gauge eq .",
    "( [ choice ] ) of section [ s:4 ] , one sets @xmath458 .",
    "the surfaces are then parameterized by a single function : @xmath459    clearly , this special parameterization is non - singular if and only if @xmath13 has no zeroes in the upper - half complex plane . since in the expression ( [ wei ] )",
    "both @xmath237 and @xmath13 are allowed to have any number of zeroes , this shows that the condition ( [ choice ] ) need not always define a good global gauge .",

    "note that when @xmath469 the surface becomes singular , and the energy per period diverges .",
    "in this appendix we will repeat the calculation of the energy of section [ s:4 ] , using a more general container with an outer wall at an arbitrary inclination angle .",
    "the characteristic function @xmath470 now reads @xmath471 the inclination angle @xmath100 of the outer wall is a control parameter , which should drop out in the @xmath178 limit .",
