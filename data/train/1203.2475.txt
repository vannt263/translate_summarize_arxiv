    "classical physics which is based on physical realism makes the distinction between ontic and epistemic state in a clean way .",
    "the ` ontic ' state are the actual values of the dynamical variables @xmath1 defined in the evolution or configuration space and solutions of the hamilton or lagrange equations describing the system .",
    "they represent the system even if there is not observer at least in a local universe ( for a nonlocal universe where correlations can exist between disconnected region of space and time the definition should probably be amended a bit : one could for example states that the absence or presence of the observer should not disturb ` too much ' the rest of the universe ) .",
    "the inclusion of the observer involves others dynamical variables @xmath2 ( therefore the observer is included in the theory ) . in principle , the coupling between the observer and the system of interest could be reduced at will and therefore the ontic state is also experimentally accessible .",
    "the ` epistemic ' state is the density of probability @xmath3 defined in the same configuration space and which evolves in time following the liouville equation @xmath4 .",
    "it represents the objective - subjective knowledge of the experimenter and is statistic by nature ( of course certainty is a particular degenerate case of this general frame ) . in classical physics the density being given at one time @xmath5 one can calculate it at any times ( past or future ) .",
    "additionally , we can arbitrary ` mathematically ' impose @xmath6 in the equations .",
    "fundamentally , this means that the dynamic is decoupled from the probabilistic evolution : the trajectories in the evolution space are the same whatever the density function @xmath7 chosen .",
    "this is an important property which in part explains why the statistical mechanics of boltzmann - gibbs requires some additional postulates ( based on symmetries or plausible boundary conditions in the remote past ) in order to fix the equilibrium states of statistical thermodynamics .",
    "the foundations of statistical physics is still a subject of active research ( in particular if we consider the subjective - objective dualism concerning interpretation of probability ) .",
    "however , its foundation relying on an ontic state @xmath8 is universally accepted by classical physicist and therefore never contradicts realism .      in quantum mechanics",
    "the situation is different .",
    "indeed , we start from a statistical theory ` the epistemic state ' but we do nt have any dynamic or trajectory @xmath1 . instead , we have observable @xmath9 which can not all be measured ` simultaneously ' for the same individual system .",
    "this leads to the principle of complementarity which states that measurement associated with non commuting operator require experimental procedures which mutually exclude each other .",
    "in the same vain by a generalization of heisenberg uncertainty principle we deduce that due to entanglement , i.e. quantum correlation , with the measurement apparatus we can not define unambiguously et univocally the hypothetical ` classical ' path followed by a particle in an interferometer .",
    "therefore , the wave - particle dualism can not be solved experimentally and the concept of trajectories become somehow metaphysical . the introduction of hidden dynamical variables written generically @xmath10 after bell is therefore regarded by most orthodox quantum practitioners as a kind of useless superstructure identical by nature to the hypothetical ether postulated in the xix@xmath11 century . however , postulating the mere existence of such @xmath10 has at least the advantage to solve the problem of the ` heisenberg - cut ' that is the duality classic - quantum or observer - object which is so important in bohr philosophy is a frequency of occurrence defined as the limit @xmath12 .",
    "this is of course a postulate in the same sense as we postulate newton s laws ( indeed we can never experience infinity : this is also a reply to bayesianism : a natural law is an hypothesis therefore we do nt need to use a non - frequentist approach to probability ) .",
    "however , since it requires ` @xmath13 ' we admit that probability is only a approximate tool used for practical reasons ( ignorance for example )",
    ". it can not be fundamental and can not be used as a final truth .",
    "the same should be true in quantum mechanics and therefore the theory can not be complete ( i took and deliberately deviate this reasoning from c. fuchs ` qbism ' interpretation ) . ] . in the copenhagen interpretation",
    "we must indeed accept a form a macro realism ( with all what this implies ) together with a micro ` non - realism ' ( whatever this can mean ) .",
    "however , since the cut is movable it is difficult to understand how realism can mute into non - realism or reciprocally ( the ` cut ' leads even to uncountable difficulties if we consider seriously einstein s relativity and its arbitresses concerning space - time foliations and reference frames ) .",
    "clearly , if we accept the hidden variable approach the problem is automatically solved in a simple and drastic way since then the paradoxical cut does not exist anymore ( i think that it was also the point stressed by schrodinger in its famous cat example ) .",
    "i am not sure that practitioners of orthodox quantum mechanics would really appreciate this fact . for them the counter intuitive nature of such @xmath14-theories ( in particular after bell theorem concerning nonlocality in the 1960 s ) would make the price too high to pay and they would probably prefer to let the question open or at least not decidable .",
    "i would even say than in order to convince quantum mechanics practitioners one or more revolutionary principles are clearly missing to solve the problem of nonlocality in a not ad - hoc way .",
    "additionally , such a model should ultimately make new predictions going beyond current quantum mechanics ( again the problem of ether ) .",
    "+ still , for the present days it is at least on a logical ground remarkable that hidden variable models can be precisely defined .",
    "it was indeed in my opinion the clear merit of de broglie and bohm to construct such a hidden variable model ( the only one which is working fine for all practical purpose i.e. without modifying schrodinger equation i would even say ) .",
    "the model is classical in the ontic sense discussed before since it introduces trajectories but it is also epistemic since it reproduces every statistical predictions of standard quantum mechanics through a clearly ( unfortunately ) nonlocal and contextual dynamic . for this last reason it would be better to call the model neo - classic since there is no nonlocal interaction in classical xix@xmath11 century physics .",
    "+ after bell s work people get more interested in this topic and in bohm s work since they discovered that they can put some experimental limits on the apriori infinite number of possible @xmath14-theories by using some ` simple ' no - go theorems .",
    "in particular , local causal models can be eliminated if we reject loopholes , fatalistic and superdeterministic approaches . by the same approach non - contextuality",
    "was also eliminated by bell , kochen and specker ( bks ) .",
    "recently , a new work by m.  pusey , j.  barret and t.  rudolph ( pbr in the following ) was put on arxiv @xcite and submitted for publication claiming a new revolutionary no - go theorem .",
    "this of course stirred much debates in blog discussions ( see for example the blog of m.  leifer : http://mattleifer.info/ from which i stole the title of the present text ) and nature even posted an article about it .",
    "the idea of the pbr theorem will be discussed in details below but shortly its aim can be summarized in a simple way . indeed , pbr show that if a hidden variable exists it can not be epistemic in a specifical sense of the word epistemic . more precisely , the theorem ( which is i think mathematically true ) states that the only way to include hidden variable in a description of the quantum world is to suppose that for every pair of quantum states @xmath15 and @xmath16 the density of probability must satisfy the condition of non intersecting support in the @xmath14-space : @xmath17 if this theorem is true it would really make hidden variables redundant ( as i perceived it ) since it could be possible to define a bijection or relation of equivalence between the lambda space and the hilbert space : ( loosely speaking we could in principle make the correspondence @xmath18 )",
    ". therefore it would be as if @xmath14 is nothing that a new name for @xmath0 it self ( not even an ether ) .",
    "+ very recently i read the pbr paper with a lot of interest in particular because i had the feeling that they missed something .",
    "i will try in the following to show what they missed and what it means really for hidden variable theories . at the end",
    "i hope that i will manage to convince you that it is still possible to deny the validity of eq .  1 for most interesting @xmath14-models .",
    "we consider a simple q - bit space @xmath19 and two states @xmath20 and @xmath21 such that in the orthogonal basis @xmath22 we have @xmath23 clearly the states are orthogonal since @xmath24\\psi_1\\rangle\\nonumber \\\\=\\langle \\psi_2|+\\rangle\\langle+|-\\rangle\\langle-|\\psi_1\\rangle=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we now consider a hidden variable model and we write the probabilities to find the outcomes @xmath25 @xmath26 in these equations we introduced the conditional ` transition ' probabilities @xmath27 for the outcomes @xmath28 supposing given the hidden state @xmath14 .",
    "we have of course @xmath29 . for the case here",
    "considered we deduce @xmath30 if @xmath31 and similarly @xmath32 if @xmath33 .",
    "+ we then obtain that if @xmath34 for some values of @xmath14 ( which means that @xmath35 and @xmath36 have intersecting supports in the @xmath14-space ) then @xmath37 for such @xmath14 values .",
    "now this is impossible since we have by definition @xmath29 for every @xmath14 .",
    "we conclude therefore that @xmath38 for every @xmath14 i.e. that @xmath35 and @xmath36 have nonintersecting supports in the @xmath14-space .",
    "we consider in the same q - bit space the two states @xmath20 and @xmath21 defined by @xmath39 and @xmath40 is an orthogonal basis and where @xmath41 $ ] is a second orthogonal basis .",
    "+ now we introduce the 2 q - bit hilbert space @xmath42 and the orthogonal basis @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 .",
    "we get the following coefficient matrix in the @xmath47 basis :    .coefficient table in the @xmath47 basis . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in spatial regions where wave packets interfere or cross .",
    "the beam splitter example is actually reminiscent of the famous two slit interference experiment which was treated in details by bohm and his followers .",
    "the trajectories look sometime ` surrealistic ' but this is the price to pay to agree with both a wave and a particle in a @xmath14-world .",
    "+ of course , if we throw away the @xmath48 and use instead @xmath49 the whole reasoning of pbr collapses since we are not allowed to compare the states as we did in section 2 .",
    "+ consider for example the orthogonal case .",
    "we now have instead of eq .",
    "4 : @xmath50 we deduce of course that @xmath51 if @xmath52 and @xmath53 if @xmath54 . now if @xmath55 for some values of @xmath14 ( which means once again that @xmath35 and @xmath36 have intersecting support ) then @xmath56 for the @xmath14s in the intersection of the two supports .",
    "what is fundamental here is that contrarily to what occurred for the models considered by pbr here eq .",
    "[ truc ] does nt imply any contradiction .",
    "therefore the pbr theorem can not be proven any more !",
    "all cases with either orthogonal or non orthogonal states can always be analyzed and criticized with the same method : if we substitute @xmath27 by @xmath57 the pbr theorem can not be proven .",
    "+ the theorem proposed by pbr is thus simply not general enough .",
    "it fits well with the xix@xmath11 like hidden variable models but it is not in agreement with neo - classical model such as the one proposed by de broglie and bohm : qed _ reducio ad absurdum_. in other words : the class of model pbr consider contradict wave particle duality ( see our example with the beam splitter ) .",
    "i think that peoples who apply naively xix@xmath11 century - like epistemic reasoning to quantum mechanics should seriously worry about pbr theorem ( the others like bohmian s can sleep peacefully ) . finally , we point out that since bohm s model is deterministic one must have @xmath58 ( where @xmath59 is the kronecker symbol ) since for one given @xmath14 only one trajectory is allowed .",
    "equivalently , the actual value @xmath60 can only takes one of the allowed eigenvalues @xmath61 associated with the hermitian operator @xmath62 .",
    "we show in the appendix that this is indeed the case for the particular half - spin model described by bohm theory .",
    "however the result is actually very general .",
    "lets be positive : even if pbr theorem is generally wrong it is actually very interesting : it ruins the old fashion hidden variable approach in a nice way and show that there are some fundamental differences between classical @xmath63 century physics and the neo - classical mechanics proposed by bohm and others .",
    "both are based on realism .",
    "both are admitting an ontic and epistemic parts .",
    "but now the wave function is part of the dynamic all the way along since it gives a contribution to the ontic state which subsequently affects the dynamic of the @xmath14-particle .",
    "the initial liouville approach separating the epistemic and the ontic part ( i.e. @xmath7 and @xmath1 ) appears to be wrong if we forget the wave function ( i.e. a same @xmath14 with different @xmath64 will lead to different trajectories and density of probability ) .",
    "i think that pbr managed to do what was the original dream of von neumann however both approaches are restricted to a very narrow class of hidden variable models ( which are not orthogonal to each other by the way ) .",
    "we consider the simple q - bit space for a single spin-@xmath65 @xcite . in this model a neutral single particle with spin @xmath65 and mass @xmath66 , is represented by a wave packet having two components @xmath67 in presence of a magnetic field inside a stern and gerlach apparatus the two contributions of the wave packet are oriented in one or the other of the exits @xcite , separating the trajectories associated with the two states @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "naturally , any modifications of the magnetic field orientation change the analyzed basis @xmath70 . consequently in presence of the stern and gerlach apparatus analyzing the spin components along @xmath71 and",
    "@xmath72 the density of probability @xmath73 depends explicitly on the orientation of the magnetic field and must be written @xmath74 .",
    "the evolution of the wave function in the stern and gerlach apparatus is thus given by the pair of equations : @xmath75 ( @xmath76 is the magnetic dipole moment ) .",
    "+ now , bohm says that the ontic state can be described dynamically as a point like object moving with the velocity @xmath77\\left(\\mathbf{x},t\\right)$ ] .",
    "here @xmath78/m\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath79 define the probability current and probability density respectively , and @xmath80 are the phases of @xmath81 .",
    "+ to understand some specificities of this theory i remind you that from eqs  [ e3 ] one deduce easily using the polar form of the wave function @xmath82\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is the local form of the conservation of probability rule .",
    "we also obtain a pair of de broglie - bohm version of hamilton - jacobi classical equations :      the quantum potential @xmath84 is a specific feature of this theory which allows us to describe the quantum statistical properties of the half spin using a classical - like stochastic dynamic .",
    "importantly this quantum potential depends on the absolute value of the wave function ( up to an arbitrary constant ) therefore the dynamical evolution will also depends on the wave function .",
    "this feature is completely different from what occurs in classical physics where the dynamic and the probability are respectively associated with a pure ontic an epistemic feature . in classical physics one is free to change the initial density of state without modifying the dynamic .",
    "however here the two features are unseparable since the wave function is part of the ontic and epistemic state at the same time .",
    "this feature has a strong consequence on the dynamical evolution which can also be seen more directly from the equation of motion    @xmath85}{m(|\\psi_{+\\mathbf{a}}\\left(\\mathbf{x},t\\right)|^{2}+|\\psi_{-\\mathbf{a}}\\left(\\mathbf{x},t\\right)|^{2 } ) } = \\frac{\\hbar}{2m}\\frac{\\textrm{im}[\\psi^{\\dagger}\\boldsymbol{\\nabla}\\psi]}{\\psi^{\\dagger}\\psi}\\left(\\mathbf{x},t\\right).\\label{e4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in order to integrate even formally this equation we first have to integrate the schrodinger equation and we will obtain solution of the form @xmath86 where the kernel @xmath87 can be evaluated from the green function .",
    "inserting these solutions in eq .",
    "[ e4 ] leads to a new differential equation for @xmath88 which reads formally as : @xmath89 this is a first order equation which not only depends on @xmath88 at the same given time @xmath90 ( i.e. when the derivative is evaluated ) but also require the knowledge of the wave function and its complex conjugate evaluated for every position @xmath91 of the evolution space at the initial time @xmath5 .",
    "this set of initial values @xmath92 plays therefore the role of additional constants of motion .",
    "therefore the complete trajectory wil be given by a functional having the general form @xmath93 now , in bohm s model we can define an instantaneous spin vector @xmath94 the projection @xmath95 spans a continuum of values during the interaction with the magnetic field but at end of the measure ( i.  e.  at @xmath96 ) we have @xmath97 corresponding to the spin observable @xmath98 .",
    "we can naturally define the mean value of the spin projection @xmath99 by @xmath100 we can always define univocally the actual position @xmath101 measured for example at @xmath102 by a function of the initial coordinate @xmath103 of the particle at a time @xmath104 , i.  e.  a long time before that the particle enters in the stern and gerlach apparatus .",
    "due to the conservation of probability requirement the number of states defined by @xmath105 in the elementary volume @xmath106 is naturally identical to @xmath107 i.  e.  : @xmath108 this result is of course well known in fluid dynamics where it is associated to the names of euler and lagrange ( the so called euler - lagrange coordinates ) .",
    "this law can also be written    @xmath109\\rho\\left(\\mathbf{x}(t),t,\\mathbf{a}\\right)d^{3}\\mathbf{x}(t)\\nonumber\\\\ = \\int [ \\int_{\\delta v}\\delta^{3}(\\mathbf{x}'-\\mathbf{f}_{\\mathbf{a}}(t;\\mathbf{x}_0(t),t_0,\\{\\psi^{\\dagger}(\\mathbf{x}',t_0),\\psi(\\mathbf{x}',t_0)\\}_{\\mathbf{x}'}\\forall \\mathbf{x}'))d^{3}\\mathbf{x}']\\rho\\left(\\mathbf{x}_0(t_0),t_0\\right)d^{3}\\mathbf{x}_0(t_0)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the second line in this equation is deduced from eq .",
    "this expression is therefore a generalization for the continuous observable @xmath110 of eq .",
    "18 which is valid only for dichotomic observable .",
    "similarly @xmath111 can be expressed as a function of the initial coordinates of the particle and can be written @xmath112 . if we consider now the expectation value @xmath113 , we can write          this quantity approaches asymptotically the definition of the projector operator on the @xmath118 direction and therefore gives us the probability for the dichotomic spin projection observable .",
