    "a theory which has drawn the attention of the scientific society in the last few years is the galileon gravity @xcite .",
    "it belongs to the modified theories of gravity in which a noncanonical scalar field is introduced and the field equations are invariant under the galilean transformation .",
    "the action integral of the galileon gravity belongs to the horndeski theories @xcite , which means that the gravitational theory is of second - order @xcite .",
    "the vast applications of study for galileons in the literature covers all the areas of gravitation physics from neutron stars , black holes , acceleration of the universe , for instance see @xcite and references therein .    in this work",
    "we are interested in the cosmological scenario and specifically in the so - called galileon cosmology @xcite . in cosmology",
    ", the galileon field has been applied in order to explain various phases of the evolution of the universe @xcite .",
    "specifically the new terms in the gravitational action integral can force the dynamics in a way such that the model fits the observations .",
    "the mechanics can explain the inflation era @xcite as also the late time - acceleration of the universe @xcite .",
    "last but not least the growth index of matter perturbations have been constrained in @xcite .",
    "as we mentioned in the previous paragraph , galileon gravity belongs to the hondenski theories and specifically there is an infinite number of different models which can be constructed from a general lagrangian .",
    "a simple model is the cubic galileon model @xcite where the  action integral is that of a canonical scalar field plus a new term which has a cubic derivative on the galileon field .",
    "the theory can be seen as a first extension of the scalar field cosmology . due to this cubic term , the nonlinearity and the complexity of the field equations is increased dramatically . recently in @xcite a cubic galileon model was derived which admits an additional conservation law and where the field equations formed an integrable dynamical system .",
    "integrability is an important issue in all the areas of physics and mathematical sciences .",
    "the reason is that while a dynamical system can be studied numerically , it is unknown if an actual solution which describes the orbits  exist .",
    "the integrable cubic galileon model admits special solutions which describes an ideal gas universe , that is , power - law scale factors .",
    "while this is similar to the solution of the canonical scalar field , we found that the power of the power - law solution is not strongly constrained by the galileon field and that is because of the cubic term . on the other hand a special property of that model",
    "is that when the potential in the action integral dominates , then the cubic term disappears which mean that the theory approach is that of a canonical scalar field .",
    "however as we shall see from our analysis , the existence of the conservation law provides new dynamics which have not been investigated previously .",
    "the scope of this work is to study the evolution of the integrable cubic galileon cosmological model . for that we perform an analysis of the critical points . in particular , in section [ sec : level1 ] we briefly discuss the cubic galileon cosmology and we review the integrable case that was derived before in @xcite .",
    "section [ dynaev ] includes the main material of our analysis where we rewrite the field equations in dimensionless variables .",
    "we define variables different from that of the @xmath0-normalizaton where we find that the dynamical system is not bounded . because of the latter property the critical points at the finite and",
    "the infinite regions are studied . at the finite region",
    "we find various critical points which can describe the expansion history of our universe as also the matter dominated era .",
    "appendices [ analysisq1 ] , [ appendixa ] , [ appp2 ] , [ appp4 ] , [ appp14 ] and [ appp15-p16 ] include important mathematical material which justify our analysis .",
    "one important property of the integrable model that we study is that there is a limit in which the terms in the field equations ( which follow from the cubic term of the galileon lagrangian ) vanish and the model is then reduced to that of a canonical scalar field cosmological model . hence , in order to study the effects of the cubic term in section [ asym ] we perform an asymptotic expansion of the solution when the cubic term dominates the universe . in section",
    "[ matter ] we extend our analysis to the case where an extra matter term is included in the gravitational action integral .",
    "finally , we discuss our results and draw our conclusions in section [ conc ] .",
    "the cubic galileon model is defined by the following action integral @xmath1 which has various cosmological and gravitational applications .    in the cosmological scenario of a homogeneous and isotropic universe with zero spatially curvature",
    "the line element of the spacetime is that of the flrw metric@xmath2 where @xmath3 is the scale factor of the universe .    indeed for this line element ,",
    "variation with respect to the metric tensor in ( [ lan.03 ] ) provides the gravitational field equations @xmath4 and @xmath5 while variation with respect to the field @xmath6 , provides the ( modified ) klein - gordon  equation @xmath7 which describes the evolution of the field , and @xmath8 .",
    "recall that we have assumed that the galileon field inherits the symmetries of the spacetime , that is if @xmath9is an isometry of ( [ bd.05 ] ) , i.e. @xmath10   = 0 $ ] , then @xmath6 inherits the symmetries of the spacetime if and only if @xmath11   = 0 $ ] .",
    "therefore @xmath6 is only a function of the @xmath12  parameter , i.e. @xmath13 .    an equivalent way to write the field equations is by defining fluid components such as energy density and pressure which corresponds to the galileon field . indeed",
    "if we consider the energy density @xmath14 and the pressure term @xmath15 the field equations take the form @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the energy momentum tensor corresponding to the galileon field and @xmath18 in which @xmath19 is the normalized comoving observer @xmath20 .",
    "last but not least equation ( [ f2 ] ) is now equivalent to the bianchi identity @xmath21 , that is,@xmath22    last but not least the dark energy equation - of - state parameter is defined as follows .",
    "@xmath23   .",
    "\\label{eos}\\ ] ] it can be shown that with a proper election of @xmath24 , the equation - of - state parameter @xmath25 can realize the quintessence scenario , the phantom one and cross the phantom divide during the evolution , which is one of the advantages of galileon cosmology .",
    "in general the specific functions of @xmath26and @xmath27 are unknown and for different functions there will be a different evolution .",
    "recently in @xcite two unknown functions were specified by the requirement that the gravitational field equations form an integrable dynamical system .",
    "specifically the following functions were found @xmath28 there exists a symmetry vector which provides , with the use of noether s second theorem , the following conservation law for the field equations @xmath29    because of the nonlinearity of the field equations the general solution can not be written in a closed - form .",
    "however from the symmetry vector invariant curves have been defined and by using the zero - th order invariants some power law ( singular solutions ) have been derived .",
    "in particular the following solutions were obtained : @xmath30 and @xmath31 these solutions are special solutions since they exist for specific initial conditions . in order to study the general evolution of the system we perform an analysis in the phase - space .",
    "a phase - space analysis for this cosmological model has been performed previously in @xcite , however the integrable case with @xmath32 and @xmath27 given by the expressions ( [ pot ] ) were excluded from @xcite .",
    "moreover there is a special observation in the integrable case in the sense that @xmath33 .",
    "the latter means that when @xmath34 dominates , @xmath35 becomes very small and the cubic galileon model reduces to that of a canonical scalar field which can mimic also the cosmological constant when @xmath36 .    in the following",
    "we write the field equations in new dimensionless variables and we perform our analysis .",
    "from equation one immediately sees that the hubble function @xmath37 can cross the value @xmath38 , from negative to positive values , or vice - verca .",
    "this means that the standard @xmath0-normalizaton is not useful and new variables have to be defined .",
    "we introduce the new variables @xmath39 and the parameter @xmath40 so we obtain the three - dimensional dynamical system @xmath41 where  @xmath42 and functions @xmath43 are  defined by the following expressions    [ eq.38b]@xmath44 and prime denotes the new derivative @xmath45 .",
    "interestingly , the system admits the first integral    @xmath46    which is the friedmann s first equation and constrains the evolution of the solution .",
    "thus , the dynamics are restricted to a surface given by . for a fixed value of @xmath47 , the first and last equations in are invariant under the discrete symmetry @xmath48 .",
    "thus , the fixed points related by this discrete symmetry have the opposite dynamical behavior . by definition ,",
    "@xmath49 .",
    "let s compare with the variables introduced in @xcite defined by @xmath50    since we have chosen here @xmath51 and @xmath24 such that @xmath52 we have the relations @xmath53 and the extra relation @xmath54 this implies that the fixed points @xmath55 and @xmath56 investigated in detail in @xcite , do not exist in our scenario since the values of their coordinates @xmath57 do not satisfy the above extra relation .",
    "furthermore , some cosmological parameters with great physical significance are the effective equation of state parameter @xmath58 ( because we set @xmath59 ) and the  deceleration parameter@xmath60 some conditions for the cosmological viability of the most general scalar - tensor theories has to be satisfied by extended galileon dark energy models ; say the model must be free of ghosts and laplacian instabilities @xcite . in the special case of the action ( in units where @xmath61 )",

    "the discussion about the physical interpretation of these points and the points at infinity is left for section [ discussion - points ] +    we proceed with the determination of critical points at the infinity .      because the phase space of the system is unbounded",
    "we introduce the poincar compactification and a new time derivative @xmath64 @xmath65 the dynamics on the `` cylinder at infinity '' can be obtained by setting @xmath66 ; the dynamics in the coordinates @xmath67 is governed by the equations    @xmath68    we linearize around a given fixed point on the cylinder at infinity  by introducing @xmath69 , with @xmath70 .",
    "notice that @xmath71 , so to examine the stability of the fixed points at the cylinder , and from the interior of it , we have to estimate how @xmath72 evolves , not only the stability in the plane @xmath67 .",
