    "cluster algebras , invented @xcite by sergey fomin and andrei zelevinsky around the year 2000 , are commutative algebras whose generators and relations are constructed in a recursive manner . among these algebras , there are the algebras of homogeneous coordinates on the grassmannians , on the flag varieties and on many other varieties which play an important role in geometry and representation theory .",
    "fomin and zelevinsky s main aim was to set up a combinatorial framework for the study of the so - called canonical bases which these algebras possess @xcite @xcite and which are closely related to the notion of total positivity @xcite @xcite in the associated varieties .",
    "it has rapidly turned out that the combinatorics of cluster algebras also appear in many other subjects , for example in    * poisson geometry @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite  ; * discrete dynamical systems @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite  ; * higher teichmller spaces @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite  ; * combinatorics and in particular the study of polyhedra like the stasheff associahedra @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite  ; * commutative and non commutative algebraic geometry and in particular the study of stability conditions in the sense of bridgeland @xcite , calabi - yau algebras @xcite @xcite , donaldson - thomas invariants in geometry @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite  and in string theory @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite  ; * in the representation theory of quivers and finite - dimensional algebras , cf .",
    "for example the survey articles @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite     as well as in mirror symmetry @xcite , kp solitons @xcite , hyperbolic @xmath2-manifolds @xcite ,   .",
    "we refer to the introductory articles @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite and to the cluster algebras portal @xcite for more information on cluster algebras and their links with other subjects in mathematics ( and physics ) .    in these notes , we give a concise introduction to cluster algebras and survey their ( additive ) categorification via derived categories of ginzburg dg ( = differential graded ) algebras .",
    "we prepare the ground for the formal definition of cluster algebras by giving an approximate description and the first examples in section  [ s : description - examples ] . in section  [",
    "s : cluster - algebras - associated - with - quivers ] , we introduce the central construction of quiver mutation and define the cluster algebra associated with a quiver and , more generally , with a valued quiver ( section  [ ss : valued - quivers ] ) .",
    "we extend the definition to that of cluster algebras of geometric type and present several examples in section  [ s : cluster - algebras - of - geometric - type ] .",
    "here we also review results on ring - theoretic properties of cluster algebras ( finite generation and factoriality ) . in section  [",
    "s : general - cluster - algebras ] , we give the general definition of cluster algebras with coefficients in an arbitrary semifield . in this general framework ,",
    "the symmetry between cluster variables and coefficients becomes apparent , for example in the separation formulas in theorem  [ thm : separation - formula ] but also , at the ` tropical level ' , in the duality theorem  [ thm : tropical - langlands - duality ] . in section  [ s : quantum - cluster - algebras - and - quantum - dilogarithms ] ,",
    "we present the construction of quantum cluster algebras and its link with the quantum dilogarithm function .",
    "we show how cluster algebras allow one to construct identities between products of quantum dilogarithm series .",
    "this establishes the link to donaldson  thomas theory , as we will see for example in section  [ ss : proof - quantum - dilog ] .    in section  [ s : categorification ]",
    ", we turn to the ( additive ) categorification of cluster algebras . in section  5 of @xcite ,",
    "the reader will find a gentle introduction to this subject along the lines of the historical development .",
    "we will not repeat this here but restrict ourselves to a description of the most recent framework , which applies to arbitrary symmetric cluster algebras ( of geometric type ) .",
    "the basic idea is to lift the cluster variables in the cluster algebra associated with a quiver @xmath3 to suitable representations of @xmath3 .",
    "these representations have to satisfy certain relations , which are encoded in a potential on the quiver .",
    "we review quivers with potentials and their mutations following derksen - weyman - zelevinsky @xcite in section  [ ss : quivers - with - potential ] . a conceptual framework for the study of the representations of a quiver with potential",
    "is provided by the derived category of the associated ginzburg dg algebra ( section  [ ss : der - cat - ginzburg - alg ] ) . here",
    "mutations of quivers with potential yield equivalences between derived categories of ginzburg algebras ( section  [ ss : der - eq ] ) .",
    "in fact , each mutation canonically lifts to _ two _ equivalences .",
    "thus , in trying to compose the categorical lifts of @xmath4 mutations , we are forced to choose between @xmath5 possibilities .",
    "the canonical choice was discovered by nagao @xcite and is presented in section  [ ss : patterns ] .",
    "the framework thus created allows for the categorification of all the data associated with a commutative cluster algebra ( theorem  [ thm : decategorification ] ) . a recent extension to quantum cluster algebras ( under suitable technical assumptions ) is due to efimov @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , the combinatorial data determine the categorical data to a very large extent ( sections  [ ss : reign - of - the - tropics ] and [ ss : rigid - objects - and - cluster - monomials ] ) .",
    "we end by linking our formulation of the ` decategorification theorem '  [ thm : decategorification ] to the statements available in the literature ( sections  [ ss : proof - of - decategorification ] ) and by proving theorem  [ thm : quantum - dilog - identity ] on quantum dilogarithm identities ( section  [ ss : proof - quantum - dilog ] ) .",
    "this introductory survey leaves out a number of important recent developments , notably monoidal categorification , as developed by hernandez - leclerc @xcite @xcite and nakajima @xcite , the theory of cluster algebras associated with marked surfaces @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite   and recent progress on the links between ( quantum ) cluster algebras and lie theory @xcite @xcite @xcite   .",
    "this survey expands on a talk given by the author at the gcoe conference ` derived categories 2011 tokyo ' , where theorem  [ thm : quantum - dilog - identity ] was presented .",
    "he deeply thanks the organizers for their invitation and their kind hospitality .",
    "he is very grateful to b.  leclerc for correcting an error in a previous version of example  [ ss : gr-3 - 6 ] and to h.  nakajima for a helpful conversation on the results of @xcite .",
