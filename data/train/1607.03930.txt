    "theoretical metamagnetic models are systems that have both antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic coupling interactions . at zero external field @xcite , they undergo a second - order phase transition at the nel temperature @xmath10 .",
    "besides the usual nearest - neighbor staggered arrangements of the spins , the ordered phase can be , for instance , ferromagnetic planes ordered antiferromagnetically to each other , or even ferromagnetic chains ordered antiferromagnetically , where the latter phase is usually called a superantiferromagnetic phase . at non - zero field , applyied longitudinally to the direction of the magnetization , the nel transition temperature decreases as the magnitude of the external field increases and the line of second - order transition comes to an end at a finite temperature . beyond this point , the transition is first order and ends up , at zero temperature , at a finite field @xmath11 .",
    "this phenomenon has been previously well described by landau @xcite and by griffiths @xcite , where one has the presence of a tricritical point ( the point joining first- and second - order transition lines ) .    on the other hand , through the years , experimental realizations of magnetic materials exhibiting the above characteristics have been studied .",
    "for example , chernyi and co - workers @xcite have considered the kinetics of a magnetization process in quasi - one - dimensional ising superantiferromagnet named as trimethylammonium cobalt chloride [ ( ch@xmath12)@xmath12nh]cocl@xmath132h@xmath14o , denoted by cotac , belonging to a wider series of organometallic compounds with general chemical formula [ ( ch@xmath12)@xmath12mx@xmath12]cocl@xmath132h@xmath14o with m = mn , co , ni , fe , and x = br or cl . however , one of the first studies known in the literature on the effects of a longitudinal magnetic field in superantiferromagnetic systems has been done on the ( c@xmath14h@xmath16nh@xmath12)@xmath14cucl@xmath17 compound @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that superfluid mixtures of the two helium isotopes @xmath18he and @xmath19he , and a class of anisotropic metamagnets such as fecl@xmath14 , febr@xmath14 and ni(no@xmath12)@xmath20h@xmath14o , although microscopically different at first sight , show in their thermodynamic behavior a striking similarity in that they exhibit a phase diagram in which a line of @xmath21type transition points ( second - order transition line ) ends up at a tricritical point ( see , for instance , reference @xcite ) .",
    "based on these real experimentations , we will treat herein a quantum version of a metamagnet conveying not only the basic features of the relevant classical interactions above discussed , which leads to a tricritical behavior similar to the well known classical blume - capel @xcite and beg models @xcite , but also the inclusion of quantum fluctuations due to a transverse field , which will be in fact important in the low temperature regime .",
    "moreover , there has been , in recent years , an extensive literature on competitive interaction models that present a superantiferromagnetic ( saf ) ordering , where , for instance , ferromagnetic chains are coupled in an antiferromagnetic way in two dimensions . according to these lines ,",
    "the system to be treated herein corresponds to a two - dimensional spin-@xmath22 ising model with different exchange interactions along the two lattice directions , in the presence of transverse and longitudinal magnetic fields .",
    "additional motivations to study the ising model is because it can be used to describe the critical behavior of a broader class of materials , including easy - axis magnets , binary alloys , simple liquids and their mixtures , polymer solutions , subnuclear matter , etc . @xcite .    in the present case",
    ", the corresponding model can be described by the following hamiltonian @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the @xmath25 pauli spin-@xmath22 operator component at site @xmath26 on a square lattice of @xmath27 sites , @xmath28 is the exchange coupling along the @xmath29 axis , the first and second sum are over nearest - neighbors along the @xmath8 and @xmath9 axis , respectively , @xmath0 is the longitudinal magnetic field , and @xmath30 is the transverse magnetic field .",
    "the corresponding ordered state is composed by a superantiferromagnetic phase , and is characterized by a parallel spin orientation in the @xmath8 direction , and an antiparallel spin orientation in the @xmath9 direction , therefore exhibiting a kind of nel order between two sublattices of linear chains that can be denoted by @xmath31 and @xmath32 .    the classical version of model ( [ 1 ] ) ,",
    "i.e. @xmath33 , on anisotropic square lattices has been investigated by using a modified mean - field theory , in which the intrachain interaction is treated exactly and the interactions between chains are taken into account in a mean - field way ( linear chain approximation - lca ) @xcite .",
    "several other approaches , such as usual mean - field approximation ( mfa ) @xcite , effective - field theory ( eft ) @xcite , mean - field renormalization group ( mfrg ) @xcite , effective - field renormalization group ( efrg ) @xcite , monte carlo simulations ( mc ) @xcite , and high - temperature series expansion ( se ) @xcite have also been applied to this classical model .",
    "although these approaches agree with the overall phase diagram in two dimensions , lca @xcite and eft @xcite approaches produce a reentrant behavior in the first - order transition line .",
    "the same reentrant behavior is obtained for the three - dimensional model by the eft with four spins @xcite .    on the other hand , the quantum version of the model , given by the hamiltonian ( [ 1 ] ) ,",
    "has not been ubiquitously treated in the literature as its classical counterpart .",
    "nevertheless , phase diagrams and some thermodynamic properties have been obtained by using the eft @xcite , and a pair approximation for the free energy ( the latter case only for @xmath34 @xcite ) .",
    "it has been noted that only second - order phase transitions are present in the computed phase diagrams .    in the present paper , using the mfa based on a variational method for the free- energy , we investigate the phase diagram behavior of the spin-@xmath22 ising superantiferromagnet in the presence of both longitudinal and transverse external fields .",
    "we would like to seek out not only the effect of the quantum fluctuations in the model but also the presence or not of the tricritical points and first - order transitions , since the eft has only given a second - order character .",
    "the remaining of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section we outline the formalism and its application to the transverse ising superantiferromagnet in the presence of a longitudinal magnetic field ; in sec .",
    "iii we discuss the results and present some final comments .",
    "we will treat model ( [ 1 ] ) by the mean - field approximation ( mfa ) using a variational method based on peierls - bogoliubov inequality , which can be formally written as @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are free energies associated with two systems defined by the hamiltonians @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively , the thermal average @xmath40 should be taken in relation to the canonical distribution associated with the trial hamiltonian @xmath39 , with @xmath41 standing for the variational parameters .",
    "the approximated free energy @xmath36 is then given by the minimum of @xmath42 with respect to @xmath41 , i.e. @xmath43 .    the trial hamiltonian @xmath44 is chosen as free spins , distributed in two different sublattices @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "each sublattice consists of ferromagnetic linear chains coupled antiferromagnetically with two neighboring chains .",
    "we then have @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are two variational parameters .",
    "it is not difficult to compute the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) and , after minimizing @xmath42 , the variational parameters @xmath46 and @xmath47 can be written as a function of the sublattice magnetizations @xmath48 and @xmath49 . the approximated mean - field helmholtz free energy per spin , @xmath50 ,",
    "can thus be written as @xmath51with the corresponding sublattice magnetizations @xmath48 and @xmath49 given by @xmath52and @xmath53where @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath5 is the ratio between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions . for a given value of the set of parameters @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , eqs .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) and ( [ 5 ] ) are numerically solved for @xmath48 and @xmath49 and , when several solutions are found , the stable phase will be the one that minimizes the free energy @xmath61 . in this context",
    ", the equilibrium state corresponds always to the minimum value of @xmath61 with respect to @xmath48 and @xmath49 .    for a metamagnetic system , it is more convenient to formulate the problem in terms of the total @xmath62 and the staggered @xmath63 magnetizations , which are defined as @xmath64 and @xmath65 . therefore , we can rewrite eqs .",

    "although the first - order transition line must be computed by numerically seeking the minimum of the free energy , the second - order transition line , as well as the location of the tricritical point , can be obtained through a landau expansion of the free energy , given by eq .",

    "[ mfa_diagrams_1](a ) we can see that as the transverse field increases , the transition temperature decreases .",

    "as expected , by increasing the longitudinal field the transition temperature decreases . for @xmath102",
    "the transition is always second order .",

    "moreover , as the present one - spin mean - field approach provides a final transition temperature even in one dimension , better procedures should be very welcome to treat the present model .",
    "nevertheless , from the present results , one can clearly see that the results are indeed different from those obtained by employing eft @xcite and no reentrant behavior is observed in the first - order transition lines at low temperatures .",
    "the same qualitative results are expected for the model in three - dimensions , where the chains are arranged in a staggered way .",
    "in summary , we investigated the anisotropic two - dimensional nearest - neighbor ising model with competitive interations in an uniform longitudinal and traverse fields by using the mfa approach .",
    "we obtained the phase diagrams in the @xmath114 and @xmath115 planes varying the value of @xmath60 , where the critical frontier separates the saf order with the paramagnetic disorder .    at zero temperature , the critical field",

    "we showed also that for this approach appear in the phase diagrams lines of the first order as well as tri - critical points , and that the first order lines are derived from the construction of maxwell .",
