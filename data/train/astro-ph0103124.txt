    "1995 ) identified the 14 brightest stars in this cluster with jhk photometry and br@xmath3 and br@xmath2 hydrogen recombination lines , showing that these stars had the characteristic colors and emission lines of wolf - rayet ( wr ) and he i emission - line stars .",
    "the strength of the br@xmath2 and br@xmath3 emission lines suggests that these stars are losing mass at rates of 2@xmath610@xmath7  .",
    "using k - band spectroscopy , cotera et al .",
    "( 1996 ) also found 12 stars in the cluster with spectra consistent with late - type wn / of types , and which have 1@xmath820 @xmath6 10@xmath7 m@xmath9 , and 800@xmath81200 .",
    "recent observations of the arches cluster indicate that the number of massive stars is much greater than suggested by the initial studies .",

    "( 1999 ) calculate that the total cluster mass exceeds 10@xmath11 m@xmath9 with as many as 160 o - stars and a stellar density of @xmath12 3@xmath610@xmath13 m@xmath9 pc@xmath14 .",
    "these parameters make the arches cluster one of the densest and most massive young stellar clusters in the galaxy .",
    "in addition , the ionizing flux ( estimated to be a few  10@xmath15 s@xmath16 ) is sufficient to ionize the surrounding arched filaments h ii complex ( serabyn et al . 1998 ; lang et al . 2001 ) .",
    "the relative placement of the arches cluster and the filamentary nebular features is depicted in figure 1 .",
    "thermal radio emission from ionized stellar winds is detectable at radio wavelengths and arises from the outer parts of the wind envelope .",
    "the classic theory of panagia & felli ( 1975 ) and wright & barlow ( 1975 ) predicts that the spectrum of radio emission from a stellar wind is @xmath17 @xmath18 for a spherically symmetric , isothermal , stationary wind expanding at a constant velocity .",
    "previous surveys made with the very large array ( vla ) of the national radio astronomy observatory have detected radio emission from ob supergiant and wolf - rayet stellar winds ( abbott et al .",

    "here , we present multi - frequency vla observations of the arches cluster in an attempt to detect stellar wind emission from the individual stars known to be members of this dense cluster .",
    "vla multi - frequency continuum observations were made of the arches cluster in july 1999 ( a - array ) at 4.9 ghz and 8.5 ghz ( 4 hours each ) , and in october 1999 ( bna array ) at 43.3 ghz ( 3 hours ) .",

    "standard procedures for calibration , editing , and imaging were carried out using the _ aips _ software of nrao . at all wavelengths ,",
    "3c286 was used for flux density calibration , and at 8.5 and 4.8 ghz , 1751 - 253 was used as a phase calibrator . at 43 ghz ,",
    "fast switching between the bright source sgr a@xmath5 and the phase center of the observations ( an angular distance of 125 ) was carried out on a 90 second cycle in order to closely track the phase variations . the resulting spatial resolutions and rms noise levels in the images are 079  033 , pa=128 and 45 @xmath19jy  at 4.9 ghz ; 041  016 , pa=28 and 25 @xmath19jy  at 8.5 ghz ; and 029  007 , pa=492 and 300 @xmath19jy  at 43.3 ghz .",
    "figure 2 shows the 8.5 ghz image of the radio sources within a 16  ( 0.7 pc ) region centered on the bright source at the cluster center .",
    "the crosses represent the positions of 9 of the 14 stars in nagata et al .",
    "( 1995 ) which showed br@xmath3 and br@xmath2 recombination lines .",
    "these positions have been shifted by 005 ( 066 ) to correct for what appears to be a systematic offset to the west . at 8.5 ghz ,",
    "eight sources are detected above a 6@xmath20 level and are referred to as ar1@xmath88 .",
    "seven of the sources ( with the exception of ar6 ) appear to be associated with the stellar positions plotted in figure 2 .",
    "ar7 also shows a larger displacement ( @xmath21@xmath2=05 ) from the corresponding stellar position than the rest of the radio sources .",
    "however , the absolute uncertainty in the near - infrared positions is 2  or less , so an association is quite possible within these limits . since the a priori probability of finding a 8.5 ghz background source with flux density greater than 0.1 mjy in the region considered is 0.005 ,",
    "we conclude that all the radio sources detected are indeed associated with the galactic center arches cluster .",
    "the positions and properties of ar1@xmath88 are listed in table 1 .",
    "four of these sources are detected in the 4.9 ghz observations ( ar1 , ar4 , ar6 , ar7 ) , while the central source ar1 is additionally detected in the 43.3 ghz observations . at 43.3 ghz",
    ", ar1 has a flux density of 3.10.1 mjy , consistent with the 4.9/8.5 ghz spectral index ( @xmath2 + 0.35 ) .",
    "spectral indices between 4.9/8.5 ghz are calculated for the sources detected at 4.9 ghz .",
    "upper limits for the flux densities at 4.9 ghz can be estimated for the remaining sources , with resulting lower limits for the spectral indices .",
    "seven of the sources show rising spectra in the range of + 0.3 to + 0.9 with the exception of ar6 , which has a nonthermal spectral index ( = @xmath80.7 ) .",
    "the sources ar2@xmath88 are point sources with angular sizes @xmath22 025 .",
    "the deconvolved size of ar1 at 8.5 ghz is 011 ( 0.005 pc ) , implying a brightness temperature of 3000 k , a reasonable value for an ionized wind .",
    "the spectral indices of the detected sources are consistent with values expected from stellar wind emission .",
    "several of the sources have spectra which are flatter ( @xmath2  + 0.3 ) than the predicted @xmath2=+0.6 , and ar6 has a negative spectral index ( @xmath2  @xmath80.7 )",
    ". however , these spectra do not rule out stellar wind detections . about 25% of stellar winds arising from massive stars have been found to have flat or nonthermal spectra in the radio regime ( bieging , abbott & churchwell 1989 ) .",
    "the precise mechanism that produces these nonthermal spectra is not established , but internal shocks in the wind of a single star ( white 1985 ) or the presence of interacting winds in close binary systems have been proposed ( contreras & rodrguez 1999 ) . for a typical late - type wn star at the galactic center ,",
    "the expected flux density at 8.5 ghz arising from a stellar wind is 250 @xmath19jy based on the assumed values of 1000 , 5@xmath610@xmath7  and t10@xmath11 k. this value is similar to the flux densities we measure at 8.5 ghz for ar2@xmath88 .",
    "figure 2 also shows an excellent positional correspondence between the radio sources and the stellar sources detected by nagata et al .",
    "table 2 lists the spectral types of these stars as determined by cotera et al .",
    "the stars have been classified as late - type wn and of stars , all of which are expected to be losing mass at high rates from their surfaces . as noted above , such stars often exhibit flattened or nonthermal spectral indices due to the presence of a nonthermal component .",
    "therefore , the range of spectra we detect is consistent with predictions for late - type wn stars .",
    "the radio source ar6 is displaced by @xmath21@xmath2=1  from the corresponding stellar position of nagata et al .",
    "( 1995 ) . at 8.5 ghz",
    ", there is a 75 @xmath19jy source ( 3@xmath20 ) closer to the stellar position , which may be the correct identifcation .",
    "the stellar source at this position has been classified as a wn8 star by cotera et al .",
    "if this displacement is real , we have then to consider the possibility that ar6 is associated with another star in the cluster .",
    "t tauri stars are sometimes found to have associated nonthermal emission , usually interpreted as gyrosynchrotron produced by electrons accelerated in situ by magnetic reconnection flares near the stellar surface ( andr et al .",
    "1988 ; rodrguez , anglada , and curiel 1999 ) .",
    "if this is the case , we may be detecting for the first time a young , low mass member of the cluster .",
    "the flux densities at 8.5 ghz were used to calculate a mass - loss rate based on panagia & felli ( 1975 ) :    @xmath23    where s@xmath24 is the flux density of the source at 8.5 ghz ,  is the terminal velocity of the wind , and d is the distance to the source ( 8 kpc ) . we have assumed an electron temperature of = 10@xmath11 k , z=1 , and a mean molecular weight , @xmath19=2 , due to the enrichment in heavy elements of the late - type wn stars ( leitherer et al .",
    ". the mass loss rate of ar1 has the largest value , = 1.7  10@xmath25  yr@xmath16 , comparable only to stars with extreme values for , such as in the r136 stellar cluster at the center of 30 doradus ( de koter et al .",
    "the values of  for ar2@xmath88 are in the range of 3@xmath84.5  10@xmath7  , consistent with values found for for late type wn stars by leitherer et al .",
    "( 1997 ) : 2.5@xmath83.9 @xmath610@xmath7  yr@xmath16 .      the rich population of massive stars in the radio arc region , which includes both the arches and quintuplet clusters ( figer et al .",
    "1999 ) , suggests that the interstellar environment should be strongly influenced by the energetic processes related to such massive star formation and evolution .",
    "ionization of the molecular material in this region and formation of the unusually shaped arched filaments and sickle h ii regions can be accounted for by the ionizing fluxes of each cluster ( lang et al .",
    "1997 , 2001 ) .",
    "in addition , interactions between the winds in the densely - packed arches cluster may give rise to a shock - heated diffuse `` cluster wind '' , which could have a temperature as high as 10@xmath26 k ( cant , raga & rodrguez 2000 ) .",
    "this emission is predicted to be detectable in the x - ray regime with the _ chandra x - ray observatory_. studies of the interaction between the massive stars in the arches and the surrounding interstellar environoment are currently underway at a number of complementary wavelengths .",
    "we present the following results from our 4.9 , 8.5 , and 43.3 ghz observations of the arches cluster :    \\(1 ) eight radio sources are detected at 8.5 ghz , four sources at 4.9 ghz , and one of them is detected also at 43.3 ghz .",
    "seven of the eight detections show rising spectral indices between 4.9 and 8.5 ghz in the range + 0.3 to + 0.6 , while one source shows a nonthermal spectrum ( @xmath80.7 ) .",
    "all of the detections are consistent with stellar wind emission from mass - losing stars .",
    "however , the nonthermal source may be tracing a young , low mass member of the cluster .",
    "this is the first detection of emission associated with the members of the arches cluster at a band other than the near - infrared .",
    "\\(2 ) seven of the eight radio sources are coincident in position with the br@xmath3 and br@xmath2 emission - line stellar sources of nagata et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , which correspond to the late wn and of stellar types as classified by cotera et al .",
    "these positional correspondences further confirm that the ionized winds from stars in the arches cluster are detected .",
    "\\(3 ) based on the radio flux density , ar1 has a mass - loss rate of 2@xmath610@xmath25  yr@xmath16 , comparable only to that of the stars in 30 doradus ( de koter et al .",
    "mass - loss rates for ar2@xmath88 are found to be in the range 3@xmath84.5@xmath610@xmath7  , similar to the large mass loss rates for other late - type wn systems ( leitherer et al .",
