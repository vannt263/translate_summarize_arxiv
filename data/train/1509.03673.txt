    "quantum anomaly  @xcite is one of the most fundamental concepts in quantum field theory and anomaly - related phenomena appear in various physical systems from elementary particle reactions at high energy to tabletop experiments in condensed matter physics .",
    "thus , it would offer tremendous opportunities in theory and experiment to seek for novel manifestation of quantum anomaly .",
    "recently , the chiral magnetic effect ( cme ) has been attracting broad interest , which was first triggered in the research field of the ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collision  @xcite . later on ,",
    "the cme theory has been formulated in terms of the chiral ( axial ) chemical potential @xmath0  @xcite and in this way the application opportunities of the cme have opened to a wider range of the research fields . although it is still challenging to confirm any smoking - gun experiment through the charge asymmetry fluctuations in the heavy - ion collision  @xcite , materials in condensed matter systems would provide us with more controllable environments .",
    "recently , the material realization of 3d dirac fermions  @xcite and weyl fermions  @xcite has been established .",
    "in fact , it is claimed that an evidence for the cme has been observed in @xmath1 with parallel electric and magnetic fields , for which the magnetoconductance has quadratic dependence on the magnetic field  @xcite .    in the present paper",
    ", we propose another manifestation of quantum anomaly which we call the `` chiral pumping effect '' ( cpe ) .",
    "this effect can be understood as a cousin of the cme originating from a variant of anomaly relation .",
    "first , let us recall that the cme relation  @xcite is given by a compact formula : @xmath2 where @xmath3 represents the levi - civita symbol .",
    "this relation states that a charge current @xmath4 is induced in parallel to the applied magnetic field @xmath5 , provided that the chiral chemical potential @xmath6 (= @xmath0 ) is nonzero .",
    "we can anticipate the cpe by exchanging the @xmath7 and @xmath8 indices in the above relation , which leads to the following relation for a charge density : @xmath9 of course , the net charge must be conserved , so we must understand this relation in an open system setup .",
    "this means that the charge is pumped into the system from the surrounding reservoir , and the change is proportional to the inner product of the axial - vector field @xmath10 and the magnetic field . in the language of weyl semimetals",
    ", @xmath10 corresponds to the displacement of two weyl points .",
    "since the cpe originates from quantum anomaly similarly to the cme , we expect that the coefficient in the relation   should be renormalization free .    here",
    ", let us mention on a related approach with an inhomogeneous axion term @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "the chern - simons - maxwell equations suggest that a charge density , @xmath12 , is induced  @xcite . on the algebraic level",
    "this is almost equivalent to eq .",
    "once @xmath13 is identified with @xmath10 ( which is possible only in the massless case ) .",
    "the crucial difference in physics is that @xmath14 should usually belong to the property of the material , whereas our @xmath10 in eq .",
    "is an external field that is experimentally adjustable as we see later .",
    "it is actually quite non - trivial how to implement such axial - vector field using electromagnetic devices . in the case of experimental confirmation of the cme , in fact , it is technically difficult to control @xmath0 and so the formula   can not work as it appears for the experimental signature . it should be noted that @xmath15 in the chern - simons - maxwell theory would immediately lead to eq .",
    "as pointed out originally in the very first cme paper  @xcite and later in the context of weyl semimetals also  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , our case of the cpe has an advantage that we can easily manipulate @xmath10 .",
    "moreover , the balanced configuration of charge and axial - charge ( i.e.  chirality ) turns out to be a system of capacitor of chirality which should be useful for more direct cme studies .",
    "the aim of this work is to propose a tractable experimental setup to manifest the cpe in 3d dirac systems . a key step to realize the axial - vector field @xmath10 experimentally is , as discussed below , that we utilize a rotating electric field , i.e. , circularly polarized laser rotating in a two dimensional plane ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : schematic ] for a schematic illustration ) .",
    "we also refer to a related idea with circular polarizations in 3d dirac semimetals  @xcite and more general photo - induced effects  @xcite . using a simple fermionic description",
    ", we will show that the dirac point splits into two weyl points . with an additional magnetic field  @xcite ,",
    "a finite density arises from the lowest landau level ( lll ) of one chirality , which manifests a concrete picture of the cpe in ( 1 + 1)-dimensionally reduced theory of fermions  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : floquet ] we discuss the floquet effective hamiltonian to confirm an axial - vector field . in sec .",
    "[ sec : response ] we consider a combination with a magnetic field and perform explicit calculations for the charge density and the axial current .",
    "inhomogeneous electric charge and chirality should be balanced with each other .",
    "we solve these coupled equations of the cpe and the cme to obtain a balanced distribution of the electric charge and the chirality in sec .",
    "[ sec : distribution ] . finally , sec .",
    "[ sec : discussions ] is devoted to our discussions and conclusions .",
    "we explain how to realize the axial - vector field in a 3d gapless dirac system by applying a circularly polarized laser .",
    "we note that concrete calculations below are known ones , but a clear recognition of the axial - vector field has not been established .",
    "when continuous laser fields are imposed externally , the hamiltonian @xmath16 becomes periodically time - dependent , i.e. , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the periodicity .",
    "quantum states in time periodic driving are described by the floquet theory  @xcite , that is , a temporal version of the bloch theorem .",
    "the essence of the floquet theory is a mapping between the time - dependent schrdinger equation and a static eigenvalue problem .",
    "the eigenvalue is called the floquet pseudo - energy and plays a role similar to the energy in a static system .",
    "applications of the floquet theory to periodically driven systems with topology changing has been a recent hot topic  @xcite and experiments have also been done  @xcite .    to make this paper as self - contained as possible , in this section , we derive the effective hamiltonian in an explicit way , though the final result is not very new but already known .",
    "let us consider a hamiltonian , @xmath19 , with @xmath20 that describes the one - particle dirac system coupled to an external gauge field and @xmath21 are the dirac matrices satisfying @xmath22 .",
    "in an electric field with circular polarization in the @xmath23-@xmath24 plane , we can write the time - dependent vector potentials down as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the frequency . we can conveniently decompose the interaction part of the hamiltonian into two pieces as @xmath27 where @xmath28 with @xmath29 .",
    "now we assume that the the period @xmath18 of the circular polarization is small enough as compared to the typical observation timescale .",
    "we can then expand the theory in terms of @xmath30 ( with @xmath31 being a frequency corresponding to some excitation energy ) . taking the average over @xmath32 we can readily find the following effective hamiltonian  @xcite : @xmath33    \\simeq h_0 + \\frac{1}{\\omega}[h_-,h_+ ] \\;,\\ ] ] to the first order in the expansion .",
    "we can also find the same form from the floquet hamiltonian using the van vleck perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "interestingly we can express the induced term as @xmath34    = -\\frac{(ee_0)^2}{\\omega^3}i\\gamma^x\\gamma^y    = -\\beta \\gamma^0 \\gamma^z \\gamma_5 \\ ; , \\label{eq : hind}\\ ] ] where we defined @xmath35 .",
    "this means that the circular polarized electric field would induce an axial - vector background field @xmath36 perpendicular to the polarization plane .",
    "essentially the same expression was obtained in the context of `` floquet weyl semimetal '' and the corresponding floquet bands were figured out  @xcite .",
    "the physics is basically the same as this preceding work  @xcite , but we use a different language here and , for completeness , we shall see the energy dispersion relations in the rest of this section .",
    "the effect of finite @xmath37 is easily understandable from the energy dispersion relations .",
    "we can immediately diagonalize @xmath38 and the four pseudo - energies read : @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "we display low - lying @xmath41 in fig .",
    "[ fig : disp ] . which shows that the dirac point splits into two weyl points with a displacement given by @xmath42 in fact , @xmath37 is nothing but a momentum shift along the @xmath43-axis that is positive for the right chirality state ( i.e. , @xmath44 ) and negative for the left chirality state ( i.e. , @xmath45 ) .",
    "we point out that time - resolved arpes should be able to see this splitting of weyl points in a similar manner as the gap opening  @xcite of the 2d dirac point already observed experimentally  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , as long as @xmath46 , the pseudo - energy always has two weyl points ( if they are inside of the brillouin zone ) even for @xmath47 .",
    "therefore , we do not have to require strict massless - ness to realize gapless dispersions , which should be a quite useful feature for practical applications including the schwinger or landau - zener effect . in",
    "what follows below , we limit ourselves to the @xmath48 case just for technical simplicity .     as a function of @xmath49 and @xmath50 for @xmath46 [ in the figure @xmath51",
    "was chosen ] . ]",
    "the generalization from the one - particle hamiltonian to the many - body field theory is straightforward .",
    "it is then more convenient to work with the lagrangian density corresponding to @xmath38 , that we can express as @xmath52 here we include @xmath0 for completeness , which is a necessary ingredient for the cme .",
    "it is clear from this hamiltonian that we should identify @xmath37 as a parameter representing what is called the _ chiral shift _  @xcite .",
    "we should emphasize a crucial difference from the idea of the chiral shift that is not directly controllable but secondarily generated by finite - density effects . in our present problem",
    ", however , @xmath37 is an external parameter that we can control with the amplitude and/or the frequency of the circular polarized electric field .",
    "what we will see is that , conversely to discussions on the chiral shift  @xcite , a finite density is generated by this externally given @xmath53 .",
    ") with ( a ) chiral chemical potential @xmath0 relevant for the cme and ( b ) chiral shift @xmath37 relevant for the cpe",
    ".   filled ( blank ) dots represent states that are newly occupied ( unoccupied ) . ]",
    "it is the most essential point that we can regard @xmath37 as the @xmath43 component of an axial - vector field ; @xmath54 .",
    "then , if we further impose an external magnetic field @xmath5 on this system , we should expect the following anomaly relation ; @xmath55 , immediately from the cpe or eq .  .",
    "we will confirm this expectation with explicit calculations , but before going into details , let us consider an intuitive interpretation to understand eq .  .",
    "for the purpose of comprehensible illustration it would be useful to sketch the dispersion relations in the same way as in a cme literature  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : shift ]  ( a ) shows the dispersion relations of the lowest landau levels ( llls ) relevant for the cme with @xmath56 and @xmath57 . in this case with @xmath58 the energies of the right - handed ( @xmath59 ) particles are decreased , while those of the left - handed ( @xmath60 ) particles are increased .",
    "note that only one spin state is chosen out for the lll depending on the sign of @xmath61 .",
    "therefore , a positive @xmath0 favors more @xmath59 than @xmath60 .",
    "this explains how a finite chiral density is accumulated , while a net density remains vanishing .",
    "also we see that the cme current flows from the lll with @xmath0 and gives an intuitive picture for the anomaly relation  .",
    "in contrast , as seen in fig .  [",
    "fig : shift ]  ( b ) for @xmath62 , the energy dispersion of @xmath59 ( and @xmath60 ) is shifted positively ( and negatively , respectively ) along the @xmath50 axis .",
    "thus , assuming that particles can flow in through the @xmath50-integration edges [ as indicated by the dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : shift ]  ( b ) ] , both @xmath60 and @xmath59 lll states increase their occupation .",
    "this is the mechanism of how a finite density develops from a combination of @xmath37 and @xmath63 ( that causes the dimensional reduction ) through the anomaly relation  .",
    "the argument at the same time tells us that a @xmath59 excess in @xmath64 and an @xmath60 excess in @xmath65 contribute to a negative flow of the net chirality , which is an analogue of the cme current . summarizing the above discussions we should expect non - zero @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "now we shall make sure of our qualitative argument by performing explicit calculations and identify the coefficient of eq .",
    "following the calculations done previously  @xcite .",
    "we set @xmath68 in the following and concentrate on the cpe only .",
    "the fermion propagator with @xmath37 in the presence of @xmath69 is @xmath70\\ ] ] near the coincidence limit , where @xmath71 is the spin projection operator and the first term , @xmath72 , is the lll contribution .",
    "the ( feynman ) propagator for each landau mode is @xmath73 \\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath74 is the chirality projection operator and we defined @xmath75 using this form of the propagator we can express the current expectation value as @xmath76\\;.\\ ] ] we can simplify the calculation by noting that @xmath77 = 1 $ ] where two @xmath78 are independent . because @xmath31 in the numerator should be vanishing after the @xmath31 integration , it is straightforward to check that @xmath79",
    ". therefore only the lll contribution survives , which yields : @xmath80 after the @xmath31 integration .",
    "the above is a finite integral only from @xmath81 .",
    "actually , this simple expression is precisely a concrete realization of our qualitative argument based on fig .",
    "[ fig : shift ]  ( b ) . finally , after the @xmath82 integration",
    ", we recover the same result as previously obtained one  @xcite : @xmath83 which is quite reminiscent of the formula for the cme current , namely , @xmath84 .",
    "this compact formula itself is a known one , but the fact that the above @xmath66 can be easily realized with a circularly polarized laser is our main claim in this work .    remembering our qualitative argument , we can in turn expect an axial current @xmath67 which is similar to what is called the chiral separation effect ; @xmath85  @xcite . to see this ,",
    "let us perform an explicit calculation using @xmath86 $ ] .",
    "in this case we use @xmath87 = \\pm\\frac{i}{4}{\\mathrm{tr}}(\\gamma^z\\gamma_5\\gamma^0\\gamma^x\\gamma^y)=\\pm 1 $ ] , where the last @xmath78 refers to @xmath78 of @xmath88 .",
    "then , the lll contribution is completely identical to that for @xmath66 except for the overall sign , that means , @xmath89 .",
    "we can immediately explain this proportionality for the lll from the property of the two - dimensional dirac matrices ; @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the two - dimensional counterpart defined by @xmath92",
    ". in this case , however , some complication appears from non - zero landau levels as is the case for the chiral shift  @xcite .",
    "we can write those contributions down explicitly as @xmath93 this is a subtle expression whose precise value depends on how to organize the infinity in the landau sum and the momentum integration .",
    "for example , if we take the landau sum up to @xmath94 and the momentum integration within @xmath95 in such a way that @xmath96 , then the @xmath82 integration is easy to perform and we find @xmath97 . for more general situation @xmath94 should be replaced with @xmath98 , which approaches @xmath99 in the opposite limit of @xmath100 . in reality",
    "these cutoffs should be fixed by the microscopic properties of the material , especially the debye mass and the brillouin zone structures .",
    "the conclusion is that the system comes to have a finite axial - current as given by @xmath101 the coefficient @xmath102 of which is not anomaly protected unlike eq .   and",
    "it is a material - dependent problem to fix @xmath102 .",
    "so far , we assumed an infinitely large system",
    ". imposing surface boundary conditions with a finite extent , we should take account of the polarization and screening effects to find a balanced distribution of the charge and the chirality density .",
    "let us consider a finite - size material whose thickness in the @xmath43 direction is @xmath103 ; we take the @xmath43 coordinate so that the material is placed in a range @xmath104 . then , because of the surface effects , we should introduce @xmath43 dependent @xmath105 and @xmath106 , the determination of which is the goal of this section .    in the presence of @xmath106 , the cme current should follow from eq .  .",
    "in equilibrium , however , there should be no current and the cme current should be canceled by the polarization effect , i.e. @xmath107 where the second term in the right - hand side appears from ohm s law with the electric conductivity @xmath108 . in fact , @xmath109 is nothing but an electric field associated with the polarization or the charge distribution @xmath110 .",
    "qualitatively , this last term represents a flow to flatten the charge distribution . for the balance equation for @xmath111 we postulate the same structure as eq .   with the replacement of @xmath112 and @xmath113 (",
    "i.e. , the chiral separation effect  @xcite ) : @xmath114 where we added the last term to consider diffusion processes of chirality introducing a diffusion constant @xmath115",
    ". intuitively , this last term represents movement of chirality to decrease the chirality gradient .",
    "the densities , @xmath116 and @xmath117 , are given as @xmath118 where a cpe contribution to @xmath116 is added to the standard density - chemical potential relation .",
    "we plug these expressions to the conservation laws ; @xmath119 and @xmath120 ( note that there is no @xmath121 with our electromagnetic configuration ) .",
    "since we are interested in the static profile only , we can drop the time - derivatives to reach finally : @xmath122 we should solve these differential equations under the charge constraint ; @xmath123 , which leads to @xmath124 .",
    "if the thickness @xmath103 of the material is sufficiently small , we can find an approximate solution by expanding the solutions in terms of @xmath43 , that is , @xmath125 here , we further used a condition to impose zero net chirality .",
    "it should noted that these are leading - order results and , to satisfy eq .",
    "strictly for example , we should consider a term @xmath126 in @xmath106 which we neglected .",
    "the charge density is thus more screened near the surface at larger @xmath127 unlike an ordinary conductor , while there are more @xmath59 ( and @xmath60 ) near the bottom at negatively large @xmath43 ( and near the top at positively large @xmath43 , respectively ) .",
    "this is very interesting result ; the system behaves as a capacitor of chirality or the chiral battery in which a non - zero slope in the chirality distribution is sustained by the cpe as well as a finite net density .",
    "such a realization of the chiral battery should be useful for more quantitative investigations of the cme and related phenomena , e.g. , the chiral plasma instability  @xcite for instance .",
    "we note that the idea of the chiral battery can be traced back to the original work  @xcite and extensively discussed as chiral electronics  @xcite .",
    "the anomalously induced charge density @xmath66 given by eq .   or is an experimentally detectable quantity .",
    "one possible way to observe this is using transient grating techniques  @xcite .",
    "the grating of the circular polarized field would lead to inhomogeneous charge distribution , and the dynamics afterward can be measured .",
    "it is also an interesting possibility to make use of eq .   instead of eq .",
    "since @xmath102 could take a large number ( involving some cutoffs at least in a naive estimate ) .",
    "in the two - component spinor representation , @xmath128 is nothing but the spin expectation value .",
    "hence , for systems with gapless dirac particles , eq .",
    "indicates not only the dynamical flow of chirality but also the spin polarization .",
    "spin polarization can be probed by pump - probe magneto - optical kerr effect .",
    "in addition , when topological current or density exists in general , there can be some photo - emission processes via anomaly as discussed in refs .  @xcite .",
    "it deserves further investigations to quantify emitted photon spectra associated with the cme and the cpe .",
    "we will leave them for interesting future problems .    in summary",
    ", we formulated the cpe that generates a finite density from the combination of the circular polarized electric field and the magnetic field .",
    "the interesting point in this setup is that the externally imposed electric and magnetic fields are always pointing orthogonal to each other and there is no inner product of @xmath121 which is usually the source of topological charge and parity breaking .",
    "instead , the circular polarization breaks the parity symmetry , and so it alone can take care of the role of @xmath121 .",
    "besides , thanks to rotating electric field , we do not need to subtract a huge background due to ordinary electric current that obeys ohm s law .",
    "we gave intuitive arguments about the generation of the density and the axial current and confirmed our expectations by explicit calculations recovering previously known expressions .",
    "we saw that the density @xmath66 is expressed in a compact form similar to the cme and its coefficient is anomaly protected .",
    "in contrast to this , @xmath67 has complicated contributions that need some ultraviolet regularization or physical cutoff .",
    "we would here emphasize the following point : each building block for our conclusion was known ; the appearance of a @xmath129 term from the floquet weyl semimetal and the topologically induced density from the chiral shift were all `` re - derived '' in this work , but our novelty is found in a combination of them .",
    "the most important is that our controlling parameter @xmath37 is given externally unlike the axion term associated with intrinsic properties of the material .",
    "although it is difficult to determine the coefficient of @xmath67 , it is still proportional to @xmath37 or a combination of @xmath130 ( as long as @xmath26 is large enough to justify the leading - order expansion as we did in this work ) .",
    "this characteristic dependence of @xmath131 should give a consistency check for anomalously induced @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "fortunately , such ambiguity in @xmath67 does not enter the determination of the static charge and chirality distribution in the material .",
    "our study implies that the induced @xmath66 gets slightly smaller near the material surfaces .",
    "the most interesting is that the chirality has a non - trivial distribution also and the chirality separation is sustained by the cpe , which realizes a system of the chiral battery .",
    "the experimental confirmation of the cpe itself is quite challenging , and furthermore , the cpe opens a new possibility for more direct cme studies using this chiral battery .",
