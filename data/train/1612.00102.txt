    "we underscore the wealth of flow polytopes with product formulas for volumes .",

    "all current results relating to these volumes show these formulas as a result of various computations that surprisingly yield products .",

    "( thus , @xmath15 and @xmath14 are combinatorially equivalent , and have the same volume and ehrhart polynomial . )",
    "the polytope @xmath15 is a face of the birkhoff polytope , the polytope of all doubly stochastic matrices , prominent in combinatorial optimization . remarkably , the volume of the @xmath15 polytope is the product of the first @xmath20 catalan numbers , as conjectured by chan , robbins and yuen in @xcite and proved by zeilberger analytically in @xcite . under volume in this paper we mean the normalized volume of a polytope .",

    "together with the loop at the largest vertex , @xmath301 has at least @xmath125 edges .",
    "if @xmath301 has exactly @xmath125 edges , then @xmath301 must be a directed tree with a loop attached at the largest vertex .",
    "moreover , @xmath301 is a directed decreasing tree for the following reason . if we follow a directed path , by the second condition ( 2 ) of the definition of @xmath244-tesler tableau , we can always find a loop at the end .",
    "if @xmath301 is not a directed decreasing tree then there is a vertex of out - degree at least @xmath2 , which implies that there are at least two loops .",
    "this is a contradiction to the fact that @xmath301 has @xmath125 edges .",
    "thus we have @xmath299 .",
    "it is easy to see that the map @xmath304 is a desired bijection .    using the previous lemma",
    ", we can compute the number of vertices of @xmath274 when @xmath244 has two nonzero elements .",
    "let @xmath305 and @xmath306 then the number of vertices of @xmath274 is @xmath307 .    by theorem",
    "[ face - poset - characterization ] and lemma  [ forest ] , the number of vertices of @xmath274 is equal to the number of decreasing forests on @xmath288 such that @xmath308 $ ] and the leaves are contained in @xmath309 .",
    "suppose that @xmath279 is such a decreasing forest .",
    "since every tree in @xmath279 has at least one leaf , @xmath279 has at most @xmath2 trees .",
    "we will count how many ways to construct @xmath279 in the following two cases .",
    "case 1 : @xmath279 has two trees @xmath265 and @xmath266 , where @xmath265 has only one leaf @xmath98 and @xmath266 has only one leaf @xmath310 .",
    "since @xmath279 is a decreasing forest and each tree has only one leaf , each tree is determined by its vertices . for @xmath311 , we have two possibilities : @xmath29 is a vertex of @xmath265 or not . for @xmath312 , we have three possibilities : @xmath251 is a vertex of @xmath265 , a vertex of @xmath266 or not a vertex of them .",
    "thus there are @xmath313 ways to construct such @xmath279 .",
    "case 2 : @xmath279 has only one tree .",
    "then @xmath279 has two leaves which are @xmath98 and @xmath310 or only one leaf which is @xmath98 .",
    "note that @xmath314 is the unique root in @xmath279 .",
    "let @xmath129 ( resp .",
    "@xmath183 ) be the set of vertices in the unique path from @xmath98 ( resp .",
    "@xmath310 ) to @xmath314 .",
    "then @xmath279 is uniquely determined by @xmath129 and @xmath183 .",
    "let @xmath315 .",
    "observe that @xmath316 and we have @xmath317 if and only if @xmath279 has only one leaf .",
    "we define two sets @xmath318 and @xmath319 as follows .",
    "@xmath320 then @xmath318 and @xmath319 satisfy    1 .",
    "@xmath321 , 2 .",
    "@xmath322 , 3 .",
    "@xmath323    the two sets @xmath129 and @xmath183 can be reconstructed from @xmath318 and @xmath319 by @xmath324 thus , @xmath318 and @xmath319 determine @xmath279 .",
    "moreover , any two sets @xmath318 and @xmath319 satisfying the above three conditions will make a decreasing forest @xmath279 considered in this case .",
    "thus the number of @xmath279s in this case is equal to the number of two sets @xmath318 and @xmath319 , which is @xmath313 .    by the above two cases",
