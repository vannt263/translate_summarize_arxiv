    "it is well known that phase - insensitive amplifiers introduce at least 3 db extra noise in the output , whereas phase - sensitive amplifiers may preserve the input signal - to - noise ratio , and in this sense are  noiseless \" @xcite .",
    "a spectral analysis of some cavity - based noiseless amplifiers has been given in ref.@xcite , but these investigations are carried out exclusively in the time domain , while spatial aspects are neglected by introducing the plane wave approximation , i.e. by considering only one spatial mode .    however , the spatial domain is relevant for the subject of noiseless amplification . indeed , many areas of physics would benefit from having a possibility of noiseless amplification of faint optical images . here , based on this motivation , we analyse the parametric image amplification in two different cavity geometries @xcite .",
    "a possible realization of a parametric image amplifier is shown in fig.1 .",
    "a faint image which is to be amplified is located in the object plane @xmath0 .",
    "this image is projected by a lenses system in the input plane of a ring - cavity degenerate optical parametric amplifier . the amplified image from the output plane",
    "is then projected in the image plane @xmath1 by another lenses system .",
    "each lens has a focal length @xmath2 .",
    "the presence of the dashed part in the scheme depends on the geometry one wants to consider , as we shall see . instead , the presence of a pupil @xmath3 of finite area @xmath4 , is necessary for evaluation of the noise properties .",
    "let us now intruduce the two - component transverse wave vector @xmath5 and position vector @xmath6 .",
    "moreover , let @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , @xmath10 the photon annihiliation and creation operators of the field in the object plane and image plane respectively .",
    "we shall assume that the field in the object plane is in a coherent state with real amplitude @xmath11 modulated ( and even ) in space .",
    "the observable , in the image plane , is the surface photocurrent density @xmath12 , with @xmath13 the photodetection efficiency .",
    "however , the quantity of interest for us is the number of photodetections @xmath14 registered by the pixel , of area @xmath15 , centered at the point @xmath16 in the image plane in the time window @xmath17 $ ] , i.e. @xmath18 we shall consider the mean number @xmath19 of registered electrons as the amplified signal of our scheme .",
    "its variance characterizes the noise properties of the image @xmath20 the power signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of the amplified image is given by @xmath21 equivalent quantities , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , can be built up in the object plane . finally , by definition , the noise figure is @xmath25 and we refer to the situation of @xmath26 as the noiseless amplification . in order to investigate this possibility we have to express the image field in terms of object field .",
    "we first consider the case of planar cavity @xcite .",
    "hence , the dashed part in fig.1 has to be neglected .",
    "the behavior of the slowly varying part of the field operator @xmath27 inside the cavity is described by the following langevin equation @xmath28+\\sqrt{2\\gamma}\\,b_{in}({\\vec\\xi}\\,,t)\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the wave number , @xmath30 is the cavity decay rate , and @xmath31 is the cavity detuning .",
    "@xmath32 is the constant of parametric interaction proportional to the amplitude of the pump field taken as a classical quantity .",
    "the symbol @xmath33 denotes the transverse laplacian .",
    "the above equation can be solved by means of spatio - temporal fourier transformations ; furthermore , with the aid of transformations at lenses @xmath34 we arrive at @xmath35\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the impulse response function , i.e. the fourier transform of the pupil function @xmath3 ( for an infinitely large pupil @xmath37 ) .",
    "the coefficients @xmath38 are @xmath39 [ 1-i\\delta({\\vec\\rho}\\,,-\\omega)]+{\\cal a}_p^2 } { [ 1+i\\delta({\\vec\\rho}\\,,\\omega ) ] [ 1-i\\delta({\\vec\\rho}\\,,-\\omega)]-{\\cal a}_p^2}\\,,\\label{u } \\\\",
    "v({\\vec\\rho}\\,,\\omega)&=&\\frac{2{\\cal a}_p } { [ 1+i\\delta({\\vec\\rho}\\,,\\omega ) ] [ 1-i\\delta({\\vec\\rho}\\,,-\\omega)]-{\\cal a}_p^2}\\,.\\label{v}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath40 is the local mismatch function , with @xmath41 a characteristic transverse length .",
    "now , the quantities of interest can be calculated by using eq.([eofa1 ] ) , and some simplifying assumptions , i.e. : @xmath42 much smaller than the typical scale of change of @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , so we can take the latter functions out of integral when they enter as a product with @xmath36 ; the size of each pixel is the smallest of all the spatial scales , so that we can substitute integration over the pixel area by multiplication by @xmath15 ; observation time @xmath46 long compared with the inverse cavity bandwidth @xmath47 .",
    "all that leads to @xmath48 with @xmath49 the gain factor @xmath50 ^ 2 + 4\\delta^2({\\vec\\rho}\\,,0)\\}/\\{[1+\\delta^2({\\vec\\rho}\\,,0 ) -{\\cal a}_p^2]^2\\ } \\,.\\ ] ] for the variance we get @xmath51 \\right\\}\\nonumber \\\\&+&{\\rm self\\ ; interference\\ ; of\\ ; the\\ ; noise } \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have introduced the squeezing parameter @xmath52 = |u({\\vec\\rho}\\,,0)|\\pm |v({\\vec\\rho}\\,,0)|$ ] , and the orientation angle @xmath53 -\\arg\\left[u({\\vec\\rho}\\,,0)\\right ] -\\arg\\left[v({\\vec\\rho}\\,,0)\\right]$ ] .",
    "the condition to neglect the ( unspecified ) noise terms in eqs.([ni1 ] ) , ( [ deltani1 ] ) reads @xmath54 it also fixes the resolution of the scheme .",
    "once it is satisfied , the noise figure becomes @xmath55\\}/ \\{\\eta g({\\vec\\rho}\\,)\\ } \\,.\\ ] ] the optimum condition for noiseless amplification , coming from eqs.([g1 ] ) and ( [ f1 ] ) , is @xmath56 .",
    "hence , depending on the value of the detuning , the noiseless amplification takes places in a small region around the optical axis or in a anular region . therefore , for reconstruction of the whole image one has to use scanning .",
    "let us now go to the configuration with confocal cavity @xcite .",
    "in this case the dashed part of the optical scheme in fig.1 has to be considered . in particular the confocality is guaranteed by means of a specific relation between the focal length of the intracavity lens and the cavity round trip length .",
    "the intracavity field @xmath57 can be expanded on the basis of the gauss - laguerre modes @xmath58 as @xmath59 all the modes with @xmath60 even have the same frequency ; the same is true for the modes with @xmath60 odd ; the frequency separation between the two groups of modes is equal to one half the free spectral range . due to the frequency degeneracies ,",
    "the field can be split into even and odd part @xmath61 .",
    "we consider the modes with @xmath60 even quasi - resonant with the signal . since the detuning is equal for all these modes , it is possible to get the following langevin equation for the intracavity field @xmath62+\\sqrt{2\\gamma}\\,b_+^{in}({\\vec\\rho}\\,,t)\\,.\\ ] ]",
    "this equation can be solved in the frequency domain ; furthermore , with the aid of transformations at lenses @xmath63 we can write @xmath64\\,,\\ ] ] where the coefficients @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the same of eqs.([u ] ) and ( [ v ] ) with now the mismatch function no longer dependent from the position vector , i.e. @xmath67 . repeating the steps of previous section , we easily obtain the mean number of photoelectrons @xmath68 where now the gain factor @xmath49 takes a simpler form @xmath69 ^ 2\\,,\\ ] ] considering the situation of perfect resonance , i.e. @xmath70 . for the variance we have @xmath71 to neglect the noise terms in eqs.([ni2 ] ) and ( [ deltani2 ] ) , we again use the condition ( [ noisecond ] ) . then , the noise figure becomes @xmath72 as can be seen from eqs.([g2 ] ) and ( [ f2 ] ) , the noiseless amplification occours uniformely over the transverse plane .",
    "hence , this scheme offer the possibility of amplification of the whole image at once .",
    "moreover , a high gain is required to only compensate the effect of non efficient detection ."
