    "the einstein s field equations with cosmological constant take the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the unknown lorentzian metric , @xmath2 is the ricci curvature tensor , @xmath3 is the scalar curvature in which @xmath4 is the inverse of @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the cosmological constant , @xmath7 stands for the newton s gravitational constant , @xmath8 is the velocity of the light and @xmath9 is the energy - momentum tensor . in a vacuum , i.e. , in regions of space - time in which @xmath10 , the einstein s field equations ( 1.1 ) reduce to @xmath11 or equivalently , @xmath12 in cosmology ,",
    "the cosmological constant @xmath6 was proposed by einstein as a modification of his original theory of general relativity to achieve a stationary universe .",
    "unfortunately , einstein abandoned the concept after the observation of the hubble redshift indicated that the universe might not be stationary , since he had based his theory off the idea that the universe is unchanging ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however , the discovery of cosmic acceleration in the 1990s has renewed the interest in a cosmological constant . in this paper , we will construct a new kind of solutions , in particular the space - periodic solutions of the einstein s field equations ( 1.2 ) ( or equivalently ( 1.3 ) ) with non - vanishing cosmological constant .",
    "recently , kong and liu @xcite presented an effective new method to find the exact solutions of the einstein s field equations , and by using this method they constructed some new exact solutions including the time - periodic solutions .",
    "the time - periodic solutions presented in @xcite can be used to describe a regular space - time , which has vanishing riemann curvature tensor but is inhomogenous , anisotropic and not asymptotically flat . in the series work @xcite , the authors constructed several kinds of new time - periodic solutions of the vacuum einstein s field equations",
    "whose riemann curvature tensors vanish , keep finite or take the infinity at some points in these space - times , respectively . however the norm of riemann curvature tensors of all these solutions vanishes .",
    "this implies that these solutions essentially describe regular time - periodic space - times .",
    "more recently , kong , liu and shen @xcite constructed a new time - periodic solution of the vacuum einstein s field equations . for",
    "the solution described in @xcite , not only its riemann curvature tensor takes the infinity at some points , but also the norm of the riemann curvature tensor also go to the infinity at these points .",
    "therefore , this solution possesses some physical singularities .",
    "moreover , it has been shown that this solution is intrinsically time - periodic and then can be used to describe a time - periodic universe with the  time - periodic physical singularity \" . by calculating the weyl scalars of this new solution , some new physical phenomena are discovered and new singularities for the universal model described by our new solution has been analyzed .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the vacuum einstein s field equations with non - vanishing cosmological constant , namely , the equations ( 1.2 ) or ( 1.3 ) .",
    "we first construct a new kind of solutions to ( 1.2 ) , in particular including the space - time - periodic solution , then analyze the properties of curvature tensors , e.g. , riemann curvature tensor , weyl scalars and so on , finally investigate the singularities of these solutions . some new physical phenomena are also discovered .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we present our method to construct the new kind of solutions to the vacuum einstein s field equations with non - vanishing cosmological constant .",

    "in this section , we first construct a new kind of solutions to the equations ( 1.3 ) , then calculate the riemann curvature tensors , the norm of the riemann curvature tensors and then analyze the weyl scalars of the solutions constructed .    in the coordinates @xmath13",
