    "electron transport through nano - size transistors containing the quantum dots , molecules and/or nanowires is determined by the available energy levels ( tunable by external gate voltage ) and strongly depends on the coulomb interactions @xcite .",
    "discretization of the energy levels is responsible for oscillations of the differential conductance upon varying the gate voltage , whereas the correlation effects lead to the coulomb blockade and can induce ( at low temperatures ) the kondo resonance enhancing the zero - bias conductance to a unitary value @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "besides promising perspectives for the applications in modern electronics / spintronics the nanoscopic structures represent also valuable testing grounds for probing the many - body effects .",

    "the resulting currents are sensitive to a competition between the induced on - dot pairing and the coulomb repulsion . in such context there have been experimentally explored the signatures of @xmath1-junction @xcite , josephson effect @xcite , superconducting quantum interference @xcite , quantum entanglement by splitting the copper pairs @xcite , multiple andreev scattering @xcite , and interplay of the on - dot pairing with the kondo effect @xcite . these and similar related activities have been discussed theoretically by various groups @xcite .    since in practical realizations",
    "the nanoscopic objects are never entirely separated from an environment ( e.g.  a given substrate or external photon / phonon quanta ) therefore transport properties are also affected by the interference effects .",
    "a convenient prototype for studying such phenomena is the tunneling setup shown in figure [ scheme ] , where the central quantum dot is coupled to the side - attached quantum dot and eventually to other degrees of freedom .",
    "transport through this t - shape double quantum dot ( dqd ) occurs predominantly via the central quantum dot ( qd@xmath2 ) , whereas electron leakage to / from the side - coupled quantum dot ( qd@xmath3 ) brings in the interference effects . in the case of both normal ( n ) electrodes and assuming a weak interdot coupling it has been argued @xcite that the differential conductance should reveal the asymmetric fano - type lineshapes",

    "recently we have explored the interferometric patterns for the dqd case placed between the metallic and superconducting electrodes @xcite . in such heterostructures",

    "the double quantum dot heterojunction shown in fig .  [ scheme ] can be described by the anderson - type hamiltonian @xmath5 where @xmath6 denote the normal @xmath7 and superconducting @xmath8 charge reservoirs , @xmath9 refers to both quantum dots ( together with the phonon bath ) and the last term @xmath10 describes the hybridization to external leads .",

    "their energy levels are denoted by @xmath20 and @xmath21 refer to the on - dot coulomb potentials .",
    "since we are interested in the fano - type interference we focus on the electron transport only via the central quantum dot @xmath22 this situation can be extended to more general cases when electron tunneling directly involves both the quantum dots . for clarity reasons we postpone such analysis for the future studies .",
    "energy spectrum and transport properties of the system ( [ model ] ) can be inferred from the matrix green s function @xmath23 defined in a representation of the nambu spinors @xmath24 , @xmath25 . in the equilibrium conditions ( for @xmath26 ) such matrix green s function depends only on time difference @xmath27 .",

    "such situation has been studied in the literature by a number of authors @xcite applying various methods to account for the correlation effects @xmath48 .",
    "generally speaking , the phonon modes have both the quantitative and qualitative influence on the electron transport through nanodevices @xcite . in particular they can be responsible for such effects as : appearance of the multiple side - peaks , polaronic shift in the energy levels , lowering of the on - dot potential @xmath21 ( even to the negative values promoting the pair hopping @xcite ) , suppression of the hybridization couplings @xmath49 and often serve as a source of the decoherence . these and related subjects have been so far studied by many groups , mainly considering the single quantum dots coupled to the normal leads @xcite . here",

    "spectroscopic measurements of the andreev conductance would thus be able to detect such phonon induced interferometric features .",
    "the subgap quasiparticle lorentzian peaks ( often referred as _ the bound andreev states _ ) depend on the energy level @xmath97 .",

    "the fact that @xmath97 is located aside the superconducting energy gap causes asymmetry of the quasipartice spectral weights . besides these broad lorentzians we additionally notice the narrow peak at the fermi level signifying the kondo effect .",
    "such kondo peak is considerably reduced in comparison to the normal case @xmath133 because of a competition with the on - dot pairing @xcite .",
    "on top of this picture we recognize the phonon degrees of freedom appearing as the fano - type resonances at @xmath134 .",

    "we additionally observe the fano - type resonances .",
    "they destructively affect the zero - bias enhancement whenever the phonon features happen to be located nearby the kondo peak .",
    "the zero - bias feature itself is also quite sensitive to the asymmetry ratio @xmath135 - practically it is visible only when both couplings @xmath49 are comparable @xcite .",
    "we have studied influence of the phonon modes on the spectral and on the andreev transport in the double quantum dot vertically coupled between the metallic and superconducting electrodes .",
    "our studies focused on the weak interdot coupling @xmath86 assuming that phonons directly affect only the side - attached quantum dot . under such circumstances",
    "an external phonon bath leads to some interferometric effects , reminiscent of the dephasing setup introduced by bttiker @xcite .",
    "in particular we find a number of the equidistant fano - type patterns manifested both in the effective spectrum and in the subgap transport properties .",

    "electron correlations @xmath21 on the quantum dots can induce additional coulomb satellites of these fano features .",
    "we have investigated in some detail how the correlation effects get along with the fano interference taking into account the induced on - dot pairing .",
    "we notice that phonon features are sensitive to the subgap andreev states ( dependent on @xmath21 ) and to the kondo effect .",
    "the latter one is important whenever the phonon lineshapes are induced in a vicinity of the kondo peak .",
    "we thus expect that quantum interference would destructively affect the kondo physics by partly suppressing its zero - bias hallmark @xcite .",
    "it would be of interest for the future studies to check if the presently discussed effects are still preserved when the interdot coupling @xmath86 is comparable to the external hybridization @xmath49 .",
    "we suspect , that the fano - type patterns shall evolve into some new qualities typical for the complex molecular structures .",
    "furthermore , the role of coulomb interaction @xmath66 might prove to be more influential via the higher order exchange integrations inducing some exotic kinds of the indirect kondo effect @xcite .",

    "in general , the fano - type lineshapes @xcite emerge whenever the localized ( resonant ) electron waves interfere with a continuum ( or with sufficiently broad electron states ) .",
    "following @xcite let us consider the very instructive example in which the `` direct '' transmission channel @xmath140 ( here @xmath141 denotes its conductance and @xmath142 stands for an arbitrary phase ) is combined with the transmission amplitude @xmath143 of another `` resonant '' level @xmath144 . from general considerations",
