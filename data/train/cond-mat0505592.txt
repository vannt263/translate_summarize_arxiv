    "the @xmath3 absorption and @xmath4 emission spectra of lanthanide ions in crystals are usually characterized by multi - phonon broad bands as a consequence of the large difference in the strength of interactions with ligands between @xmath5 and @xmath6 orbitals . in most cases",
    "the lifetimes of excited states decrease with increasing temperature as a result of a substantial increase in non - radiative relaxation rate ( the radiative relaxation rate usually also increases slightly ) .",
    "in contrast , measurements of eu@xmath0 in caf@xmath1 @xcite showed that the lifetime of the excited state increases with increasing temperature from about 10k to room temperature .",
    "so far only qualitative explanations have been given for this phenomenon .",
    "in this work we carry out systematic measurements of excited state lifetimes of eu@xmath0 doped in caf@xmath1 at various temperatures from 4k to 450k to clarify the experimental results and then calculate of the energy level structure and lifetime of the @xmath2 excited configuration to simulates the measured results .",
    "laser excitation was provided by a small nitrogen pulsed laser . pulse duration and energy were approximately 2ns and 100 @xmath7j respectively .",
    "the powdered caf@xmath1:0.1mol% eu sample was mounted in an oxford microstat cold finger liquid helium cryostat .",
    "sample temperatures could be varied from 5 - 500k using a resistive heater attached to the cold finger .",
    "the emission from the sample was collected by quartz optics and detected in two separate systems for fluorescent lifetime or spectral measurement . a 10 cm bausch and lomb monochromator equipped with",
    "an emi 9659 photomultiplier tube tuned to the peak of the f - d emission was used for the lifetime measurements .",
    "the pmt signal was averaged on a digital oscilloscope and downloaded to a computer for processing .    for spectral measurements ,",
    "the emission was collected by a quartz fibre optic bundle and analysed by a triax 320 spectrograph , equipped with a liquid nitrogen cooled ccd .",
    "measurements of the lifetime and f - d emission spectrum were recorded at various sample temperatures .    at low temperature ( lower than 50k )",
    "the emission spectra are characterized by sharp zero - phonon line at around 413 nm companied by a broad vibronic band centered at 425 nm with some one - phonon lines clearly distinguishable .",
    "these one - phonon lines and zero - photon line become indistinguishable around 80k and 120k respectively .",
    "the vibronic band becomes broader as temperature increases .",
    "the decay curves were all found to be exponential with time so each curve gives a single lifetime for a certain temperature .",
    "the lifetime did not vary across the emission band .",
    "the results are listed in table [ lifetime ] .",
    "it can be seen that between 100k and 320k the lifetime increases with increasing temperature , which is similar to early findings@xcite .",
    "however , at temperatures lower than 100k , the measured lifetime shows the usual trend of decreasing with increasing temperature , different from ref .",
    "@xcite . at higher temperatures",
    "the lifetimes show the usual trend of rapid decrease with increasing temperature , which we attribute to a large increase in the nonradiative relaxation rate .",
    "the dynamical processes of excitation in eu@xmath0:caf@xmath1 are show in fig .",
    "[ schematicdiagram ] .",
    "the lowest excited states belong to the @xmath2 configuration .",
    "the excitation to @xmath2 bands quickly relax to the bottom of the band and than relax radiatively to the ground states of @xmath8 configuration by emitting a photon or nonradiatively by either a multi - phonon processes or by ionization of the @xmath6 electron to conduction band.@xcite    methods for simulating one - photon and two - photon absorption spectra of eu@xmath0 in caf@xmath1 have been developed using an extended crystal - field hamiltonian@xcite which takes into account major interactions in both @xmath9 and @xmath10 configurations and the interaction between them @xcite .",
    "the simulations have successfully explained energy level positions , one - photon and two - photon transition intensities and line widths.@xcite    there are around 30,000 states in @xmath2 configuration .",
    "the lowest few hundred of them in the range of 24,000 @xmath1130,000 @xmath11 are spin octet states and have a large line strength for transitions from and to the near - degenerate ground octet multiplet @xmath12 of @xmath8 configuration.@xcite because of fast nonradiative relaxation among these @xmath2 states , there is thermal equilibrium among these @xmath2 excited states before fluorescence occurs .",
    "this explains why the fluorescence lifetime does not vary across the emission band .",
    "radiative relaxation from each of these excited states gives a broad band , with zero - phonon and some one - phonon lines distinguishable at only low temperatures .",
    "a superposition of the transitions allows us to calculate the emission spectrum and lifetime as a function of temperature .",
    "the lowest few @xmath2 energy levels , their degeneracy , and relative radiative relaxation rates are presented in table [ energylevels ] .",
    "the relaxation rate of the thermal - equilibrium states can be written as @xmath13 in this expression @xmath14 is the lifetime at 0 k , @xmath15 is the degeneracy of the state , @xmath16 the relative radiative decay rate , @xmath17 the energy difference between the @xmath18th state and the lowest excited state , @xmath19 boltzmann s constant , and @xmath20 the temperature .",
    "the dramatic decrease of lifetimes with increasing temperature above room temperature is common in fluorescence materials .",
    "it is usually due to a rapid increase in nonradiative relaxation rate . as the temperature increases , both the nonradiative multiphonon relaxation rate@xcite and the nonradiative relaxation of excitation due to ionization of @xmath6 electron to conduction band @xcite increase sharply at high temperature .",
    "phenomenologically , the nonradiative relaxation rate @xmath21 can be written as : @xmath22 where the non - radiative rate constant @xmath23 and the activation energy @xmath24 are treated as parameters .",
    "this mechanism only contributes significantly at room temperature or even higher temperature .",
    "the electronic energy levels also couple with vibrations . at zeroth order approximation ,",
    "the electronic and vibrational states can be considered as two independent systems and the lifetime of the states of the electron - phonon ( ep ) system is independent of the vibronic states . however , at higher - order approximations , especially when the electronic states and the vibrational modes are degenerate , the coupled ep states split into several states , the first few of which separate from each other by a few to a hundred wavenumbers.@xcite these coupled ep states can have slightly different radiative relaxation rates .",
    "this effect may be modelled phenomenologically as follows : @xmath25,\\ ] ] where , again , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are treated as fitting parameters .",
    "this mechanism contributes significantly only at low temperature .",
    "the lifetime at any temperature can be calculated by combining the above rates to give @xmath28 with five fitting parameters @xmath14 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the experimental results and the fitted results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ lifetimefigure ] .",
    "the parameter values used are listed in the figure caption .",
    "it can be seen that the calculated curve gives the right trend of lifetime as a function of temperature . however , the calculated lifetime increase is greater than the measured lifetime .",
    "a possible explanation is that the radiative transition rate of each state increases due to a deviation from the condon approximation .",
    "the fluorescence lifetime of the @xmath29 transition of eu@xmath0 doped in caf@xmath1 has been measured at various temperatures between 4k and 450k . between 100k and 300k the lifetime increases with increasing temperature , different from the usual lifetime - temperature dependence .",
    "energy levels of @xmath8 and @xmath2 configurations and transitions rates between them have been calculated using an extended crystal - field hamiltonian .",
    "the results show that several excited @xmath2 energy levels separated by energies of a few hundred wavenumbers contribute to the excited state lifetimes .",
    "the lowest excited state has a much larger radiative decay rate than the other excited states that are thermally populated . as temperature increases , the chance of initial states occupying higher excited energy levels , which have a smaller radiative decay rate , increases and therefore the average radiative decay rate decreases .",
    "between 100k and 320k in caf@xmath1 , the radiative decay dominates the @xmath30 excitation relaxation and therefore we observe an increasing lifetime with increasing temperatur . at low or high temperatures the lifetime decreases with increasing temperature due to thermal activation and quenching effects .",
