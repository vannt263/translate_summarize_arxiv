    "<S> the string - black hole correspondence principle can be investigated in the non - bps scenario by studying the string configuration and entropy when the string coupling is slowly increased . through a rigorous analysis , it is shown how an ensemble of string states at fixed mass and neveu - schwarz charges gets dominated in any dimension by compact states for which the one - loop corrections are important ( possibly signaling the transition to a black hole regime / description ) and with a size ( spread ) within the horizon radius of the expected correspondent black holes .    </S>",
    "<S> the relation between the hawking - bekenstein entropy of black holes and the counting of microstates is one of the most studied topics in black holes physics . in this short communication </S>",
    "<S> we deal with the non - bps scenario in the setup of closed superstring theory . in doing so , we touch upon some important questions : how to individuate the relevant microstates , how and when the two descriptions ( general relativity and quantum string ) match and , finally , how geometric features of black holes arise from the quantum description .    within string theory , the string - black hole correspondence principle </S>",
    "<S> @xcite states that a classical black hole is in one - to - one correspondence with an ensemble of string and/or d - brane states ( depending on its type of charges ) .    </S>",
    "<S> two quantities in particular play a key role in the analysis : the string coupling @xmath0 in @xmath1 extended spatial dimensions . ] and the black hole horizon radius @xmath2 , especially in relation with the string length scale ( in the string frame ) is smaller than the string scale , this yields the condition @xmath3 . ] @xmath4 .    </S>",
    "<S> the string and the black hole entropy are conjectured to become equal at a correspondence point @xmath5 in parameter space , where @xmath6 is the mass of the string states in the ensemble , equal to the black hole s one at this point , and @xmath7 are the neveu - schwarz charges , where @xmath8 refer to the ( anti)holomorphic part of the string . ] . </S>",
    "<S> also , at this point @xmath2 approaches @xmath9 .    </S>",
    "<S> there are major obstacles to verifying such a statement within string theory . </S>",
    "<S> we must show what happens to the relevant ensemble of string states and their entropy when the string coupling ( adiabatically ) increases from @xmath10 to @xmath11 .    </S>",
    "<S> this entails coping with two main issues : i ) computing the relevant corrections to the tree - level results due to interactions , ii ) correctly defining and measuring the size of string states and their _ size distribution _ and check its relation with the horizon radius of the expected correspondent black hole </S>",

    "<S> in fact , these problems where previously treated in approximated models , leading to a variety of results @xcite , but never in fully rigorous string formalism .    in coping with ii ) , the traditional approach of defining a size operator for the string failed to comply with the requirements of the theory . </S>",

    "<S> the basic idea is that , in a theory where the observables are scattering amplitudes , the size of an object is measured by scattering probes over it . for mixed states ( ensembles ) , the form factor obtained in this way can be related to their size distribution .    in a microcanonical ensemble , the entropy of the superstring at zero coupling and fixed ( tree ) mass level @xmath12 , neveu - schwarz charges @xmath13 and size @xmath14 was found to be ( @xmath15 ) @xmath16    turning on interactions ( @xmath17 ) yields corrections to the free - string result . neglecting those related to @xmath14 ( renormalization of the size ) , the relevant ones come from the string mass - shift .    </S>",
    "<S> the study of mass shifts in string theory is very difficult because very few physical vertex operators for massive string states are actually known ( in covariant gauge ) and also because of the intrinsic complications in the computations of amplitudes @xcite .    in order to obtain </S>",
    "<S> the average squared mass shift for the relevant ensemble of states at fixed tree - level mass charges and size , ref </S>",

    "<S> first , the unitarity of the string s - matrix and , then , the modular and periodicity properties of the string amplitudes on the torus , which allowed to determine a system of recurrent equations for the amplitude itself .    eventually , the average squared mass shift for the ensemble of string states at fixed mass and charges . </S>",
    "<S> [ specifchargesmass ] ] was found @xcite to be as expected from field theory considerations . </S>",
    "<S> we are writing the result in terms of the physical mass @xmath6 , which is probably an even more accurate estimate . ] @xmath18 while the average squared mass shift for the ensemble of states at fixed @xmath19 is @xcite @xmath20 absorbing an inessential proportionality constant in @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we can then infer the corrections to the single - string entropy @xmath21 when the @xmath0 is adiabatically increased @xcite @xmath22 in particular , we see that for @xmath23 the entropy becomes dominated by strings whose size is @xmath24 which has the same perturbative formula of the horizon radius of the correspondent black hole . </S>",
    "<S> it approaches the string length at @xmath25 , in accordance with the correspondence principle .    </S>",
    "<S> the string entropy is dominated in particular by the states with the minimum possible size . </S>",
    "<S> it can be shown @xcite that perturbation theory is sufficient to determine the minimal size only in @xmath26 , yielding @xmath27 it is finally interesting to observe that the relative average one - loop mass shift for these minimum size states is of order @xmath28 , possibly signaling a radical change in the relation between entropy and mass for @xmath29 and hinting to a transition between a perturbative string regime and a black hole one . </S>",
