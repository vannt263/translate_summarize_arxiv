    "following the fabrication of monolayer graphene ( mlg ) , @xcite bilayer graphene(blg ) has attracted intensive attention due to its unique electrical flexibility @xcite and unusual physical properties including the unconventional quantum hall effects .",
    "@xcite at the same time , blg is regarded as a good candidate in spintronics because compared with mlg , blg shows longer spin - relaxation times at room temperature , @xcite which is crucial for spintronic devices .",
    "@xcite in particular , transition metal atom is usually used as a spin provider in spintronic devices , @xcite and this motivates us to study the properties of magnetic adatom in the blg system .    because of the vanishing density of states ( dos ) at the dirac point , when we dope mlg with magnetic adatoms , their local moments could be conserved well at finite temperature .",
    "@xcite the behavior of magnetic impurity in mlg has been considerably studied @xcite and kondo effects are difficult to observe in this system . significantly different from the mlg ,",
    "the two sublattices in bernal stacked@xcite blg are no longer equivalent .",
    "the dos near the dirac point would be largely modified @xcite because of the degeneracy lifted by the inter - layer hoppings and the local density of states ( ldos ) have distinguishing values on the two sublattices which plays a more important role .",
    "this spatial inhomogeneity in ldos could be directly detected experimentally with the scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) .",
    "@xcite in blg with bernal stacking , it has been reported that whether the missing carbon atoms ( vacancy ) are generated on sublattice a or b greatly alters the defect - induced magnetism and the localization of the zero mode in vacancy states .",
    "@xcite in addition , the use of stm tip provides the possibility to control the position of adatoms with atomic precision on the two - dimensional open surface .",
    "@xcite     and @xmath0 are the surface unit vectors . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : blg ] , we show such asymmetry : the carbon atoms on sublattice a belonging to layer @xmath1 lies directly on the top of those belonging to layer @xmath2 so that the number of inter - layer hopping is one , while the carbon atoms on sublattice b in one layer is just fixed at the center of hexagon in the other layer so that it has three inter - layer hoppings .",
    "the direct consequence is that the ldos in bernal stacked blg has spatial inhomogeneity . in the vicinity of dirac point ,",
    "the ldos on sublattice a is much smaller than that on sublattice b. we find that the local moment of the magnetic impurity on top of sublattice a could develop better than that on sublattice b. this difference is not only reflected by the physical quantities of impurity itself but also by the spatial correlation functions between the impurity and the carbon electrons .    in this paper , we report a quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) study of a magnetic impurity placed on the top of the sublattices a and b in the bernal stacked blg and compare the results with their monolayer counterpart .",
    "the qmc method we used deals with infinite sea of conduction electrons and many - body effect without any approximations , so the results we present are essentially exact .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we give a brief introduction to our theoretical model , the anderson impurity model in bernal stacked blg , as well as our numerical methods .",
    "we also compute ldos for sublattices a and b in blg without impurity and compare them with the monolayer case .",
    "the purpose is to see the symmetry breaking generated by the bernal stacking in bilayer system . in sec .",
    "iii , we present our results obtained from the quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulation .",
    "firstly , we show the basic thermodynamic quantities on the impurity site , including occupancy , double occupancy , local magnet moments and spin susceptibility varying the chemical potential and the temperature . secondly , using the maximum entropy method with particle - hole symmetry , we do analytical continuation for the green s function obtained from qmc to extract impurity s spectral densities . finally , we study the charge - charge and spin - spin correlation functions between the impurity and the carbon sites .",
    "all the calculations were worked out on both sublattices a and b and the results in bilayer case are compared with those in mlg . in sec .",
    "iv , we summarize our results .",
    "our starting point is the single - impurity anderson model which has an impurity orbit of energy @xmath3 and on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath4 .",
    "@xcite the impurity orbit hybridizes with a conduction band with strength @xmath5 .",
    "the total hamiltonian is @xmath6 @xmath7 is a tight - binding hamiltonian . for blg",
    "it is    @xmath8    where @xmath9(@xmath10 ) annihilates an electron with spin @xmath11 at the site @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) on sublattice a(b ) of graphene s hexagonal structure in the m - th layer .",
    "the lattice structure of blg is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : blg ] .",
    "intra - layer hopping @xmath14 is the nearest neighbor hopping integral between sublattices a and b in the same plane and @xmath14 is about @xmath15 . @xcite here @xmath14 is used as the energy unit in our calculation . for the inter - layer hopping ,",
    "we use slonczewski - weiss - mcclure parametrization , @xcite i.e. , @xmath16 and @xmath17 and the configurations of these two couplings can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : blg](a ) .",

    "+ @xmath19 is the impurity hamiltonian @xmath20 where @xmath21 annihilates an electron with spin @xmath11 at the impurity orbit .",
    "+ finally , @xmath22 describes the hybridization between the impurity adatom and a carbon atom on the blg .",
    "if we place the impurity adatom on the top of a site in the first layer , then the hamiltonian is written as @xmath23    , @xmath24 in blg . ]",
    "if the adatom is added on the top of sublattice a , @xmath25 , otherwise @xmath26 .",
    "our principal computational tool is the hirsch - fye qmc algorithm . @xcite basic thermodynamic properties of the impurity site",
    "are directly calculated by this algorithm and the spectral density is extracted by the method of bayesian statistical inference .",
    "the hirsch - fye algorithm naturally returns the imaginary - time green s function @xmath27 of the impurity . with this green s function",
    ", we can easily compute basic thermodynamic quantities of the impurity orbit , such as the expectation values of the total charge @xmath28 the local moment squared @xmath29 and the double occupancy @xmath30 according to the fact that the impurity charge can either be zero or one , we note that @xmath31 a non - zero value of @xmath32 indicates the formation of a moment on the adatom orbit .",
    "the closer this value is to one , the more fully developed is the moment .",
    "we also calculate the static impurity spin susceptibility @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath35 .    using imaginary - time green s function obtained from the qmc method , we can calculate the spectral density @xmath36 by numerically solving @xcite @xmath37 the detailed procedure of bayesian inference method is presented in ref .  .",
    "this bayesian inference procedure is also called the maximum entropy method .",
    "we also use an extension of the hirsch - fye algorithm @xcite to compute the charge - charge correlation function @xmath38 and the spin - spin correlation function @xmath39    using the standard particle - hole transformation on one of the sublattice , we can prove that @xmath40 and consequently that @xmath41 when @xmath42 .",
    "@xcite these two results in turn imply the symmetries with respect to the sign of @xmath18 in various thermodynamic quantities of interest .",
    "these symmetries also mean that without loss of generality , we can restrict our attention to the behavior of the system when @xmath43 .",

    "@xcite . in general",
    ", the degeneracy near the dirac energy are lifted due to the inter - layer hoppings @xmath44 and @xmath45 , so blg shows larger dos than mlg near the dirac energy .",
    "@xcite to gain some primary insights of the spatial inhomogeneity in blg , we first calculate the ldos without the magnetic impurity ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",

    "the values of the local moment squared @xmath32 and the spin susceptibility @xmath49 also show the same order , while the double occupancy shows the opposite order to them .",
    "this results from the relation @xmath58 , which is satisfied automatically in our simulation although these three quantities are calculated independently . in fig .",
    "[ fig : kait ] , we study the spin susceptibility @xmath59 versus temperature @xmath60 in cases a and b . in both cases , as @xmath18 moves below the dirac point and @xmath60 is lowered , we see that @xmath49 crosses over from a curie - weiss behavior to the @xmath60-independent behavior as a screened local moment . in particular , near the dirac point , we see that the local moment on the sublattice a is developed better that on the sublattice b as the temperature is lowered . in principle , spin susceptibility defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : suscep ] ) depends not only on the local moment itself but also on the spin correlation with conduction - band electrons .",
    "@xcite as a result , when the ldos of conduction electrons is higher , the spin correlation is larger , and @xmath49 has smaller value and this is consistent with the results of ldos in fig .",

    "furthermore , @xmath72 is directly depended on the ldos of conduction band in fig  [ fig : dos ] , so in bernal stacked blg , the spatial inhomogeneity for spin susceptibility can be understood .",

    "the results obtained from the quantum monte carlo method are essentially exact , in the sense that we start with an infinite sea of conduction electrons and use no approximations to deal with many - body problem in our simulations .",
    "the ldos on the two sublattices show spatial inhomogeneity in blg . as a result ,",
    "when we put magnetic impurity on the top of the two sublattices , such spatial inhomogeneity greatly influences the magnetic property of the impurity .",
    "it is interesting that this inhomogeneity was also seen in vacancy - induced magnetism in blg experimentally .",
    "@xcite in general , we found that the local moment on the sublattice a is conserved better than that on sublattice b and this difference becomes more apparent as hybridization @xmath5 increases and coulomb repulsion @xmath4 decreases .",
    "other physical quantities mostly have the same feature .",

    "<S> we investigate a magnetic impurity in bernal stacked bilayer graphene by a non - perturbative numerical exact approach . in the two cases we study , </S>",
    "<S> impurity is placed on the top of two different sublattices ( a and b ) in bilayer graphene . </S>",
    "<S> we find that similar to the monolayer case , magnet moment of the impurity could still be tuned in a wide range through changing the chemical potential . </S>",
    "<S> however , the property of the impurity depends strongly on its location due to the broken symmetry between sublattices a and b caused by the bernal stacking . </S>",
    "<S> this difference becomes more apparent with the increase in the hybridization and decrease in the on - site coulomb repulsion . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , we calculate the impurity spectral densities and the correlation functions between the impurity and the conduction - band electrons . </S>",
    "<S> all the computational results show the same spatial dependence on the location of the impurity . </S>"
