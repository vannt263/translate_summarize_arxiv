    "broadband photometric imaging surveys in the uv / optical ( e.g. , sdss @xcite , kids @xcite , euclid @xcite , galex mis ) are , and will continue to be , a main source of information from which the physical properties of galaxies must be deduced .",
    "it is , however , a well known issue that the uv / optical emission of galaxies is strongly attenuated by dust and that this attenuation should be taken into account ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "this is particularly the case for late - type galaxies , which are usually much more gas- and dust - rich than early - type galaxies ( as recently re - confirmed using _ herschel_-data by e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "* ) show that most of the dust is associated with large - scale structures in the neutral and molecular gas layers , which in turn causes the attenuation to depend heavily on disk inclination @xcite .",
    "while it is generally agreed that the uv / optical emission of late - type galaxies must be corrected for dust attenuation , it has proven to be a challenge to measure the opacities of the disks , and various approaches exist .",
    "the most powerful method is to utilize infrared measurements of dust emission in combination with uv / optical data , since the attenuating dust is heated by the uv / optical - emission it absorbs , and the bulk of this energy is re - radiated longwards of 60 @xmath5 m in the far - infrared ( fir ) and submm spectral range .",
    "approaches utilizing this uv / optical - fir / submm information range from semi - empirical ones , such as the irx absorption estimator @xcite , via sed fitting using energy balance considerations @xcite , to radiation transfer modelling approaches , which explicitly calculate the uv / optical illumination of dust and the resulting fir / submm - emission ( * ? ? ?",

    "unfortunately , such a coverage of the full uv / optical - fir / submm sed is seldom , or only incompletely available for the population of spiral galaxies ( despite their significant dust opacities ) due to the scarcity of wide and sufficiently deep fir surveys .",
    "consequently , these methods can often only be applied to more massive spiral galaxies and starbursts .    in the absence of fir data semi - empirical methods , based solely on uv / optical - data , such as the uv - spectral - slope @xmath6 or the balmer decrement",

    "we then discuss our findings in the context of the production / injection / survival of dust in spiral galaxies and the scaling relations between specific star formation rate , stellar mass , and stellar mass surface density in  [ discussion ] , and summarize our results in  [ summary ] .",

    "in this paper we quantitatively link the characteristics of the attenuation of starlight in spiral galaxies to the mass of dust in the galaxies as directly determined from the fir / submm integrated photometry .",
    "this approach mandates assumptions about the spatial distribution of dust in the galaxies . here",

    "we only supply a brief summary and detail its application to our data.the model consists of a bulge with an old stellar population and two exponential disks describing the distribution of old and young stellar populations as well as of diffuse dust located in these disks .",
    "this diffuse dust component can be seen as representing dusty structures ( such as cirrus ) with a substantial projected surface filling factor .",
    "emission from a dustless bulge is parameterized through the inclusion of a bulge - to - disk ratio ( b / d ) to accommodate a range of geometries along the hubble sequence .",
    "in addition the model includes a clumpy dust component with an embedded young stellar population representing star - forming regions .",
    "the fraction of uv emission escaping from the regions into the diffuse ism is given by a factor @xmath12 ( fixed to @xmath13 for this analysis , following pt11 ) .",
    "this model , specifically the relative scale lengths and scale heights of the stars and diffuse dust in the exponential disks , has been calibrated on and fixed to the reproducible trends found in the local edge - on spiral galaxies analyzed in the radiation transfer analysis of @xcite . as such",
    ", the wavelength dependence of the scale lengths is also fixed .    in the pt11 model",
    "the opacity of the disk at a given frequency and position can be expressed in terms of the central face - on optical depth of the combination of the two dust disks at a reference wavelength ( pt11 use the b - band at 4430  ) , @xmath0 .",

    "the value of @xmath63 is almost independent of the wavelengths at which the _ herschel _ data are obtained , as the median temperature of sources with only a @xmath61 m pacs detection is @xmath64k , while that of sources with a pacs detection only at @xmath19 m is @xmath65k .",

    "the requirement of a datapoint at @xmath61 m or shortward does not appear to induce a strong bias towards warmer sources , since the median temperature of our sample is consistent with the mean value of @xmath68k for blue galaxies with @xmath69 ( roughly comparable to our sample ) found by @xcite using a stacking analysis of h - atlas data on optically selected galaxies .",
    "overall , we believe that the isothermal model constrained by spire data at @xmath70 m and a pacs data point at 100 and/or @xmath61 m represents a robust method of determining dust masses using minimal assumptions , due to the decrease in the uncertainty of both temperature and amplitude arising from a data point constraining the peak of the dust emission , and because the wavelength coverage ( @xmath71 m ) misses any significant emission arising from warm dust in sf regions or from stochastically - heated small grains in the diffuse ism ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "this picture of rapid destruction and formation in the ism is , however , difficult to reconcile with key physical and chemical properties of pre - solar grains as found in meteorites , most notably the segregation into separate populations of silicate and carbonaceous grains with a high abundance of minerals similar to those known to be produced in stellar sources . as discussed in detail by @xcite ,",
    "one is consequently confronted with a conundrum : either the grain destruction rates in the ism have been grossly overestimated , allowing most refractory grains in the ism to have an origin in agb stars , or , alternatively , an as yet unidentified but very efficient mechanism exists that can convert gaseous metals in a low temperature and low pressure ism into solid particles with the observed physical and chemical characteristics of interstellar grains .",
    "the close to linear relation between @xmath150 and @xmath75 underlying the @xmath4 relation naturally favors the existence of a mechanism for efficient growth of refractory dust out of the ism , since any such mechanism would tap into the full reservoir of metals in the ism , which are related to the integrated star formation over the lifetime of a galaxy .",
    "by contrast , if interstellar dust were mainly composed of longer - lived grains injected by agb stars on timescales of @xmath152 , one would expect the total mass of dust to be approximately proportional to the star formation rate ( sfr ) multiplied by a residency time , at least for systems with ages larger than the average dust destruction timescale .",
    "since the residency time should decrease with increasing sfr ( since the frequency of destructive sn shocks should be proportional to the sfr ) , and the sfr per unit stellar mass is known to decrease as a function of stellar mass , a strongly sublinear dependence between @xmath150 and @xmath75 would be predicted , even if an increase in the dust yield as a function of metallicity is taken into account . as such , if the origin of dust grains in the ism were predominantly stellar , one would expect an at most very weak dependence of dust mass on stellar mass .",

    "overall , the fact that disk opacities scale systematically with stellar mass surface density , as opposed to being randomly distributed , may help to explain the preservation of systematic and in some cases surprisingly tight relations between optical or uv tracers of physical quantities , even when these observational tracers are heavily affected by dust attenuation , and may help to explain why many relations were historically discovered only with relatively crude corrections for dust attenuation . apart from the scaling relations analyzed here , a further relation which would be particularly pertinent",
    "to reanalyze would be the tully - fisher ( tf ) relation between luminosity and dynamical mass @xcite , which is even tighter than the @xmath134 vs. @xmath75 relation .",
    "a similar analysis to that applied to the @xmath134 vs. @xmath75 relation here applied to the tf relation could provide a still sharper tool for statistical analysis of attenuation corrections , as well as potentially improving the accuracy of the tf relation at shorter wavelengths , both as a distance indicator , and as a diagnostic of the formation and evolution of spiral galaxies .",
    "finally , we re - emphasize that the corrected relations are only for subsets of the galaxy population restricted in @xmath75 and @xmath1 according to the limits of our present calibration of the @xmath4 relation as defined in ",
    "[ correlation ] . in order to establish attenuation - corrected scaling relations for the whole population of disk galaxies ,",
    "it is crucial to extend knowledge of fir / submm emission , and thereby calibration of the @xmath75 and @xmath1 relation , to a representative subset of the entire population of rotationally supported disk galaxies , including dwarf galaxies .",
    "we have presented a correlation between the face - on b - band dust - opacity @xmath57 and the stellar mass surface density @xmath1 for normal late - type galaxies for a range in @xmath1 ( in units of @xmath171 ) of @xmath172 . using the attenuation - inclination relation for rotationally supported late - type galaxies",
    "we have demonstrated that the values of @xmath57 estimated by means of this correlation successfully correct statistical samples of late - type galaxies for dust attenuation . in order to apply the correlation to complete samples of spiral galaxies in terms of @xmath75 ,",
    "the present depth of fir / submm data used to derive the @xmath57 - @xmath1 correlation means such samples need to be limited to @xmath173 .",
    "while the selection method employed to select spirals depends on the availability of nuv and optical data , only photometric optical data is needed to estimate the values of @xmath57 , as the required srsic fits are performed on optical ( _ r_-band ) imaging , and stellar masses have been derived using only optical data .",
    "as such this correlation presents a means to obtain attenuation corrections for samples of galaxies on the basis of optical photometric data alone , and is thus applicable to a large range of data - sets .",
    "we quantitatively demonstrate the efficacy of attenuation corrections using the @xmath0 - @xmath1 relation in concert with the pt11 model through analysis of the attenuation - inclination relation in the nuv and the @xmath134 vs. @xmath75 relation for a large sample of local universe spiral galaxies .",
    "both the inclination - dependent and the face - on components of attenuation are well predicted ; for the latter we find that the scatter in the @xmath134 vs. @xmath75 relation is minimized for corrections within 10 percent of those estimated using the @xmath0 - @xmath1 relation and the pt11 model , consistent with the large majority of dust residing in the diffuse ism , rather than in opaque clouds .",
    "overall our results are consistent with a general picture of spiral galaxies in which most of the submm emission originates from grains residing in translucent structures exposed to uv in the diffuse interstellar radiation field .",
    "we identify a roughly linear relation between the dust - mass and stellar mass of a galaxy for the range of @xmath75 probed by our sample to be the dominant driver for the @xmath0 - @xmath1 correlation . combining this result with known empirical dependencies of the gas - to - stellar mass ratio and metallicity on stellar mass",
    ", we make a largely model - independent inference requiring the rapid ( re-)formation of dust grains after their destruction in the ism , as has also been inferred from chemo - dynamical modelling of the dust cycle in the milky - way and external galaxies .",
    "our requirement that the reformed dust is refractory and largely resides in the diffuse ism ( rather than in dense clouds ) will further constrain models of the dust cycle in galaxies .",
    "we posit that the @xmath0 - @xmath1 relation applied to statistical samples of late - type galaxies subdivided by , e.g , morphology / lateness and sfr , may provide a diagnostic tool to investigate the applicability to late - type galaxies in general of results pertaining to grain formation derived from studies of the local ism in the milky way .    at the moment , the determination of @xmath0 using modified black body functions as well as the uncertainty , introduced by the effects of diffuse dust and the bulge - to - disk ratio , on the measured scale lengths of galaxies are major contributors to the uncertainties in the results presented . on the other hand ,",
    "however , the approach chosen in this paper which gives rise to these uncertainties , also ensures that the result given by eq .",

    "in the pt11 model , the opacity of the disk of a spiral galaxy is determined by the mass distribution of the diffuse dust component .",
    "this is modeled as the sum of two exponential disks and has been constrained by the reproducible trends found in the radiation transfer analysis of the galaxy sample of @xcite .",
    "for such an axisymmetric distribution of diffuse dust the face - on optical depth @xmath174 at a given frequency @xmath175 and a given radial position @xmath18 is related to the dust surface density @xmath176 and the dust spectral emissivity @xmath177 as @xmath178 .",
    "accordingly , for each disk @xmath179 in the pt11 model , @xmath180 ( the face - on optical depth at frequency @xmath175 and radial position @xmath18 of the disk @xmath179 ) can be expressed as : @xmath181 where @xmath182 is the central dust surface density of the disk @xmath179 , @xmath183 is the scale length of the disk @xmath179 at a reference wavelength , @xmath184 is the dust emissivity at a reference frequency , and @xmath185 describes the frequency dependence of the dust emissivity given by the @xcite dust model ( @xmath185 is not analytically known ) .",
    "clearly , in this model geometry , the value of @xmath182 is proportional to the mass of dust in the disk @xmath179 and inversely proportional to the area of the disk , respectively the scale length squared , i.e : @xmath186 thus , with the opacity of the pt11 model consisting of the sum of two such exponential disks , the optical depth at a given wavelength and position can be fully expressed in terms of the central face - on density of dust , respectively the face - on opacity in a reference band ( the b - band at 4430 for pt11 ) as : @xmath187 where @xmath188 is a constant containing the details of the geometry and the dust model of @xcite.following the pt11 model , the total mass of dust @xmath15 in a galaxy is given by @xmath189 where @xmath190 is the mass of diffusely distributed dust and @xmath191 is the mass of dust in self - shielded clumps , not partaking in the attenuation of optical emission .",

    "[ taubf2 ] in  [ rtmodel ] , with the fixed geometry of the pt11 model being used to re - express @xmath16 as @xmath209 ( although we set @xmath210 in the work presented here for the purpose of determining dust masses , we have chosen to include the factor @xmath211 in the derivation presented here for purposes of completeness ) . although the approximation of the dust emission from a galaxy by a single temperature modified planckian is a reasonable assumption at fir / submmm wavelengths , real galaxies will tend to have a range of components of different temperatures and the temperature derived will correspond to a luminosity weighted average temperature . furthermore , the emissivity of the dust model of @xcite is only approximately a modified planckian with a fixed emissivity @xmath6 , and the actual mass fraction of dust in clumps is not known and difficult to constrain , as the emissivity in these regions may vary with respect to that in the diffuse medium.here we have attempted to take these effects into account in first oder by empirically determining the numerical value of @xmath36 using the radiation transfer solutions to the @xcite galaxy sample , in particular ngc891 . for a known source with @xmath212 , @xmath213 , @xmath214 , @xmath215 , and @xmath216 eq .

    "finally we wish to draw attention to the fact that the grain absorption cross sections in the uv and fir of the @xcite model have been empirically constrained with respect to the hydrogen gas column through measurements of extinction and emission of diffuse dust in the milky way .",
    "thus the values of opacity are empirically constrained per unit hydrogen column , i.e @xmath228 . the derivation of dust masses , as e.g. given above",
    ", however , requires the absorption cross sections to be expressed per unit grain mass , i.e @xmath229 . with the conversion unit hydrogen column to unit grain mass being relatively uncertain ,",
    "the cross sections in the uv and fir / submm are much more tightly constrained with respect to each other , than their absolute values .",
    "for example , as noted in @xcite , the value of @xmath230 for the model of @xcite requires more heavy elements than are expected to be available and may easily overestimate the mass of dust by a factor of @xmath161 . in terms of the analysis presented here",
    ", such an overestimate will only affect absolute values such as dust masses , while leaving the predicted attenuations unaffected .",
    "spiral galaxies are fundamentally multi - component systems , consisting , to first order , of a disk and a bulge .",
    "nevertheless , their light profiles are often fitted using single srsic profiles , especially in the case of marginally resolved systems . in order to link the observed sizes , i.e the effective radius , to the intrinsic length scales of the disk and the bulge , multiple factors",
    "must be considered.while the ratio between effective radius and scale - length for a simple exponential disk is 1.68 , the ratio between the effective radius of a single srsic profile fit to a bulge + disk system and the scale - length of the disk component will decrease as the importance of the bulge increases .",
    "conversely , the presence of diffuse dust in a late - type galaxy will influence the measured sizes of these objects if the surface density of diffuse dust possesses a radial gradient . under these circumstances",
    "the apparent size measured will tend to be larger than the intrinsic size .",
    "the severity of this effect depends on both the value of @xmath0 and the inclination of the disk @xmath109 , and is sensitive to the details of the dust geometry in the galaxy .",
    "furthermore , as the degree of attenuation caused by diffuse dust varies as a function of wavelength , the effect will also be wavelength dependent .",
    "this effect has been quantitatively predicted for pure disk systems @xcite , and has been observed in the wavelength dependence of galaxy sizes ( e.g. , @xcite).a joint consideration of these effects , investigating the combined dependencies of the ratio between observed single srsic effective radius and and the scale - length of the disk component on wavelength , bulge - to - disk ratio @xmath73 , inclination @xmath109 , and @xmath0 has been performed by pastrav et al .",

    "<S> we report the discovery of a well - defined correlation between b - band face - on central optical depth due to dust , @xmath0 , and the stellar mass surface density , @xmath1 , of nearby ( @xmath2 ) spiral galaxies : @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> this relation was derived from a sample of spiral galaxies taken from the galaxy and mass assembly ( gama ) survey , which were detected in the fir / submm in the _ </S>",
    "<S> herschel_-atlas science demonstration phase field . using a quantitative analysis of the nuv attenuation - inclination relation for complete samples of gama spirals categorized according to stellar mass surface density we demonstrate that this correlation can be used to statistically correct for dust attenuation purely on the basis of optical photometry and srsic - profile morphological fits . </S>",
    "<S> considered together with previously established empirical relationships of stellar mass to metallicity and gas mass , the near linearity and high constant of proportionality of the @xmath4 relation disfavors a stellar origin for the bulk of refractory grains in spiral galaxies , instead being consistent with the existence of a ubiquitous and very rapid mechanism for the growth of dust in the ism . </S>",
    "<S> we use the @xmath4 relation in conjunction with the radiation transfer model for spiral galaxies of popescu & tuffs ( 2011 ) to derive intrinsic scaling relations between specific star formation rate , stellar mass , and stellar surface density , in which attenuation of the uv light used for the measurement of star - formation rate is corrected on an object - to - object basis . </S>",
    "<S> a marked reduction in scatter in these relations is achieved which we demonstrate is due to correction of both the inclination - dependent and face - on components of attenuation . </S>",
    "<S> our results are consistent with a general picture of spiral galaxies in which most of the submm emission originates from grains residing in translucent structures , exposed to uv in the diffuse interstellar radiation field . </S>"
