    "noncommutative geometry provides a new paradigm of geometric space , coming from and expressed in the language of quantum mechanics , _",
    "i.e. _  that of operators in hilbert space",
    ". the space itself is encoded by its algebra @xmath0 of coordinates which is concretely represented as operators in a hilbert space @xmath1 .",
    "the geometry of the space is encoded by its inverse line element which is also an operator @xmath2 acting in the same hilbert space .",
    "ordinary geometric spaces , _",
    "i.e. _  riemannian manifolds @xmath3 , fit in this framework using the hilbert space @xmath4 of spinors , the action of the algebra of functions on @xmath5 by multiplication , and the dirac operator @xmath2 .",
    "while this appears at first as a reformulation of geometric notions in an algebraic language , one gets an immediate reward which is a complete list of gravitational observables , _",
    "i.e. _  of diffeomorphism invariant quantities of the given geometry @xmath3 .",
    "they are given by the spectrum of the operator @xmath2 and the relative position ( generalized angle ) of the two algebras of operators given by @xmath0 on one hand and the algebra of functions of @xmath2 on the other .",
    "moreover the einstein - hilbert action itself is easily expressed as a spectral invariant of the operator @xmath2 .",
    "but another key virtue of the new paradigm is that it does not require the commutativity of the algebra @xmath0 .",
    "the gauge sector of the standard model is non - abelian and the possibility to extend geometry to the noncommutative case allows one to consider for instance the algebra @xmath0 of matrices @xmath6 of functions on an ordinary manifold @xmath5 .",
    "what one finds is that the theory of `` pure gravity '' on such a slightly noncommutative space , gives ordinary gravity on @xmath5 minimally coupled with pure yang - mills theory for the gauge group @xmath7 .",
    "this is a good indication but such simplistic gauge models are still quite far from the intricacies of the standard model minimally coupled with gravity , and for a long time the leitmotif of the bottom - up approach of noncommutative geometry has been to understand where the above fundamental physical model fits in the new paradigm of geometry .",
    "this culminated in @xcite with a noncommutative geometric formulation of the standard model , including the full higgs sector and see - saw mechanism , unified with gravity .    from a mathematical perspective",
    ", the spectral standard model appears naturally in the classification of irreducible finite geometries of @xmath8-dimension @xmath9 ( modulo @xmath10 ) performed in @xcite .",
    "the breaking of the natural algebra @xmath11 which results from that classification to the subalgebra @xmath12 corresponding to the standard model was effected using the requirement of the first order condition on the dirac operator .    in this paper",
    "we analyze the first order condition and the above breaking much further .",
    "we shall illustrate our analysis by a simplified case here and treat the case of the full standard model in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the origin of the first order condition and its name come from the algebraic encoding of the fact that the dirac operator over an ordinary geometric space is a differential operator of order one .",
    "it is not a derivation of the algebra of functions @xmath0 into itself but a derivation of the algebra @xmath0 into the commutant of @xmath13 where the antilinear isometry @xmath14 takes its origin in the work of tomita , and fulfills the commutativity condition @xmath15=0 \\qqq a , b \\in \\a.\\ ] ] thus the first order condition is @xmath16,jb j^{-1}]=0 \\qqq a , b \\in \\a.\\ ] ] the operator @xmath17 is a simultaneous incarnation of tomita s anti - isomorphism operator , of the charge conjugation operator and of the nuance between a @xmath8-homology cycle and a @xmath18-homology cycle .",
    "so far , the notion of inner fluctuations of the noncommutative geometry was developed under the requirement of the first order condition .",
    "the fluctuated metrics are of the form @xmath19\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is such that @xmath21 and @xmath22 is a self - adjoint universal one form ( we denote by @xmath23 rather than @xmath24 the universal differential ) .",
    "these fluctuations are the counterpart for the metric of the inner fluctuations of the automorphisms of the algebra .",
    "the inner automorphisms are the automorphisms @xmath25 of @xmath0 of the form @xmath26 ( for a unitary @xmath27 ) and they form a normal subgroup of the group of automorphisms which plays the same role as the group of gauge transformations as a subgroup of the symmetry group of the lagrangian of gravity coupled with matter . the first order condition is essential in order to guarantee the gauge invariance of the inner fluctuations under the action of the gauge group given by the unitaries @xmath28 for any unitary @xmath27 .",
    "our point of departure for this paper is that one can extend to the general case , _",
    "i.e. _  without assuming the order one condition",
    ". it suffices to add a quadratic term which only depends upon the universal @xmath29-form @xmath30 to the formula and one restores in this way ,    * the gauge invariance under the unitaries @xmath28 * the fact that inner fluctuations are transitive , _",
    "i.e. _  that inner fluctuations of inner fluctuations are themselves inner fluctuations .",
    "we show moreover that the resulting inner fluctuations come from the action on operators in hilbert space of a semi - group @xmath31 of _ inner perturbations _ which only depends on the involutive algebra @xmath0 and extends the unitary group of @xmath0 .",
    "this opens up two areas of investigation , the first is mathematical and the second is directly related to particle physics and model building :    1 .",
    "investigate the inner fluctuations for noncommutative spaces such as quantum groups and quantum spheres .",
    "2 .   compute the spectral action and inner fluctuations for the model involving the full symmetry algebra @xmath32 before the breaking to the standard model algebra .",
    "for the first point we refer to @xcite for natural examples of spectral triples not fulfilling the first order condition .",
    "the second point is the contents of a separate paper @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we will treat a simpler toy model , involving the algebra @xmath33 .",
    "it serves as an illustration of the generalized form of the inner fluctuations , the spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism appearing in the spectral action , and as a preparation for the full model based on @xmath11 . in the aforementioned classification of irreducible finite geometries of ko - dimension 6 ( modulo 8) of @xcite",
    ", this toy model corresponds to the case @xmath34 ( whereas the full model corresponds to @xmath35 ) .",
    "we note that the case @xmath36 was discussed recently in a slightly different context in @xcite .",

    "wdvs thanks ihs for hospitality during a visit from january - march 2013 .",
    "we generalize inner fluctuations to real spectral triples that fail on the first - order condition . in this case , the usual prescription @xcite does not apply , since the operator @xmath37 with @xmath38 does not behave well with respect to the action of the gauge group @xmath39 .",
    "in fact , one would require that conjugation of the fluctuated dirac operator by the unitary operator @xmath40 for @xmath41 can be implemented by a usual type of gauge transformation @xmath42 + uau^*$ ] so that @xmath43 however , the simple argument only works if @xmath44 = 0 $ ] for all @xmath45 and @xmath41 , that is , if the first - order condition is satisfied .",
    "we start with the following general result on morita equivalence for spectral triples @xmath46 that possibly do not satisfy the first - order condition .",
    "first , we introduce some notation .",

    "subsequently , we can introduce a linear operator @xmath54 on @xmath55 using the induced conjugate _ left _",

    "let @xmath47 be a finite - projective right @xmath0-module , equipped with a _ universal _",
    "connection @xmath60 .",
    "then @xmath61 moreover the triple @xmath62 is a real spectral triple where @xmath63 and the real structure is given by @xmath64    since the module @xmath47 is finite and projective , one can find an integer @xmath65 and an idempotent @xmath66 such that @xmath47 is isomorphic to the right module @xmath67 .",
    "one then has @xmath68 in order to prove we first assume that the connection @xmath60 is the grassmannian connection given by @xmath69 for such a connection one gets , for @xmath70 such that @xmath71 , @xmath72 indeed one has , in terms of the matrix components @xmath73 of @xmath66 , @xmath74 but since @xmath75 one gets that , in @xmath76 and for each @xmath77 @xmath78 as one shows using @xmath79 and @xmath80 where @xmath23 is applied componentwise to the matrix @xmath73 .",

    "@xmath284 one readily checks that the components of @xmath285 and @xmath286 enter in @xmath115 in precisely the same combinations as before to form the fields @xmath287 and @xmath288 .",
    "in fact , we simply have @xmath289 the result then follows by combining @xmath290 , @xmath291 and finally @xmath292    we conclude that the additional term @xmath115 in the inner fluctuations that is due to the failure of the first - order condition actually does not generate new scalar fields but is parametrized by the same fields that enter in @xmath116 .",
    "even more , the inner fluctuations are of rank 1 , and we are dealing with composite , rather than fundamental `` higgs '' fields .",
    "this is quite convenient for the computation of the spectral action , as we will see next .",
    "recall that the spectral action @xcite gives rise to a potential @xmath293 in terms of the fields @xmath294 and @xmath288 this reads : @xmath295 this follows from the explicit form of @xmath266 given above and the relation @xmath296 which holds for any vector @xmath297 and @xmath298 .",
    "in fact , including also the field @xmath304 , the hessian matrix of @xmath305 with respect to @xmath277 at @xmath306 is given by @xmath307 thus , upon including the field @xmath304 , the point @xmath308 is a critical point of @xmath309 , with the only negative second - derivative in the direction of the @xmath304-field .",
    "note that at this point the only non - zero entry in @xmath313 is given by @xmath314 .",
    "then , the gauge transformation @xmath315 with the unitary @xmath119 and @xmath316 implies that this minimum transforms as @xmath317 where @xmath318 .",
    "this implies that the only such matrices that leave the minimum invariant are given by @xmath319 since @xmath320 acts trivially , this reduces @xmath321 to @xmath322 .",
    "this mechanism also generates mass terms for the gauge fields corresponding to the coset @xmath323 . as usual , these come from the terms in the spectral action of the form @xmath324 with the gauge fields minimally coupled to the scalar fields @xmath294 and @xmath288 entering in @xmath266 .",
    "we will not digress on the computational details , and leave a complete treatment for the separate paper @xcite , addressing the full ( @xmath35 ) model .      after the fields @xmath325 have reached their vevs @xmath326 , there is a remaining potential for the @xmath304-field : @xmath327 selecting one of the minima of @xmath328 spontaneously breaks the symmetry further from @xmath329 to @xmath330 , and generates mass terms for the @xmath331 abelian gauge field . again",
