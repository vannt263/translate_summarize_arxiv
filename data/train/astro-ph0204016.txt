    "over the past decade there has been converging observational and theoretical evidence of differential molecular gas phase depletions that tracks the dynamical evolution of star forming cores .",
    "this chemical sequence begins with the depletion of sulfur - bearing molecules , which have strong bonds to grain surfaces and are predicted to show the largest depletion `` holes '' in their emission ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter bl97 and c97 ) ; indeed shell - like structures are now commonly observed for such molecules in low mass cores ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter tf02 ) .",
    "later in the process even volatile molecules , such as co , deplete ; as clearly demonstrated by several observational efforts @xcite .",
    "besides , the molecule predicted to be least affected by the condensation process is , which is more volatile than co and is easily removed from grain surfaces by whatever desorption process acts in molecular cores ( bl97 ; c97 ) . the homonuclear molecule  is not directly observable , but its chemical daughter products ,  and , are observed to trace dense cloud cores where other species such as co and cs are depleted ( * ? ? ?",
    "* tf02 ) , consistent with theoretical expectations ( bl97 , c97 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in this letter we present evidence for the depletion of both   and  in the cold pre - stellar b68 dark cloud .",
    "the detection of  depletion opens the possibility that the cores of molecular clouds may evade detection by conventional techniques which rely upon molecules as probes .",
    "we discuss the implications of this result for future chemical and star formation studies .",
    "the j=1 - 0 transitions of  ( 109.78218 ghz ) ,  ( 112.359277 ghz ) , and  ( 93.17378 ghz ) were observed during april 2000 and 2001 using the iram 30 m telescope .  was mapped with nyquist sampling , whereas pointed observations of  were conducted using the  map as a guide . for  the inner 50@xmath3 of b68",
    "was mapped with nyquist sampling , but the remainder of the map was obtained with honeycomb ( 24@xmath3 ) spacing . the half - power beam width at 110 ghz and 93 ghz is 22@xmath3 and 26@xmath3 , respectively .",
    "the system temperatures were typically @xmath4160190 k. in april 2001 we also obtained observations of the j=3 - 2 transition of  ( 279.512 ghz ; @xmath5 ) . each line was observed in frequency switching mode with autocorrellators as the backends providing a velocity resolution of 0.053 km s@xmath6 ( ) , 0.02 km s@xmath6 (  3 - 2 ) , and @xmath40.1 km s@xmath6 (  1 - 0 , ) .",
    "pointing was checked frequently on nearby point sources ( in april 2001 mars was located only 9@xmath7 from b68 ) yielding an uncertainty of @xmath8 .",
    "the data were calibrated using the standard chopper wheel method and are presented here on the t@xmath9 scale using standard calibrations from iram documentation .",
    "in figure 1a and 1b we compare the integrated intensity distribution of  j=10 and  j=1 - 0 ( all hyperfine components ) with the map of visual extinction ( ) obtained by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter all01 ) .",
    "the  emission peaks in a partial shell - like structure with a radius @xmath10 , approximately centered on the  peak . likewise , the  emission maxima form an arc centered on the  peak , but lie interior to the  shell . in figure 2a we present a direct position - by - position comparison to the visual extinction data using the techniques first described in @xcite . for",
    "there is little scatter with the main feature being a dramatic break in the linear rise in co emission with visual extinction at  @xmath11 mag .",
    "this break is followed by a slow but systematic _ decrease _ in co emission at greater extinctions . as discussed by @xcite , in the absence of non - lte excitation ( as expected for ) , a linear correlation between integrated intensity and  corresponds to an constant abundance throughout the cloud .",
    "a break in the correlation toward greater extinction could be the result of either a decrease in molecular abundance or high opacity saturating the molecular emission .",
    "however , the more optically thin  emission ( @xmath12 ) , shown in the lower right of figure 1b , displays similar behavior and does not increase for a@xmath13 10 mag and we therefore interpret the structure seen in figure 1a and 2a as the result of co depletion .",
    "a similar conclusion , using  and  data , has been reached by @xcite .    in figure 2b",
    "we present the  j=1 - 0 and j=3 - 2 ( 2 detections ) integrated intensity as a function of . in figure 1b",
    "the  emission exhibits a local minima at the location of the  peak . in figure 2b",
    "this minima is not clearly evident , and the positions in the depression are located as a cluster of points with @xmath14dv @xmath15 k km s@xmath6 for  @xmath16 25 mag . a definitive conclusion regarding  depletion is complicated by the presence of a few points at similar cloud depths with high intensities ( points located as the maxima on the `` ring '' in figure 1b ) .",
    "we find no difference between the opacity derived from fits to the hyperfine structure from emission in the `` ring '' and emission coincident with the depression .",
    "however , due to the known presence of excitation gradients in b68 ( all01 ) and the expectation of significant non - lte excitation for , simple conclusions regarding depletion can not be drawn from figure 2b ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "one additional notable feature in figure 2b is the lack of significant  emission for  @xmath17 5 mag .",
    "a similar threshold is found in ic 5146 by @xcite , which can be interpreted as a decrease in the  abundance due to photodestruction of  by the interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) .      to determine molecular abundances as a function of cloud depth",
    "we have coupled the results from chemical models to a 1-d spherical monte - carlo radiation transfer model @xcite .",
    "our procedure is an iterative one in which we first estimate the radial abundance profile for a given species from a time - dependent chemical model in which we fix profiles of the radial density , n@xmath18(@xmath19 ) , and kinetic temperature , t@xmath20 . the calculated abundance profile , along with the adopted density and temperature profiles ,",
    "are then incorporated as input to the radiation transfer model ( see tf02 ) .",
    "the radiative transfer model determines the expected profile of integrated intensity , which is convolved to the appropriate angular resolution to compare directly to the observed data .",
    "the parameters of the chemical model are then adjusted until the predicted integrated intensity profile matches the observed one .",
    "for example , for co the variables in this iterative solution are : the magnitude of the incident local isrf , the binding energy of co to grains ( effectively the desorption rate ) , and time .",
    "we fix the radial density profile used in the chemical and radiative transfer models to that determined from the extinction profile ( all01 ) .",
    "further , we adopt as the temperature profile that derived for dust in pre - stellar bonnor - ebert spheres by @xcite , assuming t@xmath21 t@xmath22 .",
    "however , we adjust the temperature profile by a uniform reduction of 2  k in order to match the observed intensities of both  transitions at the center of the cloud .",
    "although the molecular data in b68 show evidence for systematic velocity gradients @xcite , we assume a static cloud in the radiative transfer model , which may overestimate the line opacities .",
    "however , we do incorporate the observed variation in the spectral line width in the model .",
    "the model line width includes contributions from the thermal and turbulent widths , with the latter increasing as a function of radius . to be successful",
    "a model must reproduce both the dependence of @xmath23dv with  ( i.e. , figure 2 ) and @xmath24v with radius ( not shown ) .      for the chemistry of co we adopted the time dependent analytical expression given by @xcite .",
    "this model assumes that there is no gas phase co formation and destruction , only depletion onto grain surfaces and evaporation by cosmic ray impacts ( using the formalism of @xcite ) . in the model , co starts with an equilibrium abundance of @xmath25(co ) @xmath26 ( relative to h@xmath1 ) and is allowed to adsorb and desorb . because we have information on the abundance at cloud edges we also account for  photodestruction using approximations of @xcite .",
    "we further adopted the standard isrf @xcite . due to the inclusion of  self - shielding ,",
    "the model is solved by lagging the solution of the co column behind the abundance determination .",
    "similar to @xcite and @xcite no solution is found consistent with a co binding energy , @xmath27 960 k. adopting @xmath27 1210 k we find a solution at t @xmath28 years .",
    "the abundance profile derived from this model is given in figure 3 and the comparison to the observations is given in figure 2a . to match the observed structure at low extinction required reducing the uv field by adding an additional 1 mag of extinction to the model .",
    "this model provides an excellent fit to the  data from  @xmath29 1 to 27 mag and suggests that the  abundance declines by over 2 orders of magnitude from  @xmath30 to the center .      because of the large number of potential gas phase reaction partners for  we used the chemical model described in bl97 .",
    "the initial chemical abundances are set to evolved cloud abundances taken from @xcite , except @xmath25(co ) @xmath29 8.5 @xmath32 and @xmath25 ( ) @xmath33 .",
    "in addition we use @xmath34(co ) @xmath35 k and @xmath34 ( ) @xmath36 k. this model is run until the time matched the timescale determined by the co analysis at which point the theoretical co abundance profiles predicted by the two models were compared and found to be in good agreement .    in this fashion",
    "the abundance of co , a major destroyer of , is fixed and the primary variables that alter the  concentration are the abundance of heavy metals and the binding energy of its pre - cursor . changing the metal ion abundances will uniformly change the destruction rate of  at depths @xmath37 mag ( where carbon is not ionized ) .",
    "in contrast , raising  binding energy will decrease the formation rate in high density regions where depletion dominates .",
    "no match to the data given in figure 2b is found for a constant  abundance .",
    "an abundance reduction at cloud edges is required and the predicted emission does not fit the cluster of data points corresponding to the emission depression discussed in  3.1 . if we fix the metal ion abundances to the values given by @xcite , we can match both the j @xmath38 and j @xmath39 emission , provided we lower the @xcite temperature profile uniformly by 2  k ( as mentioned earlier ) and raise the  binding energy to e@xmath40 ( ) @xmath41 k.    the `` best '' match abundance profiles for b68 are given in figure 3 and the fit to the observed emission is shown as a solid curve in figure 2b .",
    "the abundance profile includes a reduction at cloud edges , peaks at  @xmath42 mag with @xmath25 ( ) @xmath43 , and declines by a factor of two by  @xmath44 mag . over this range the concentration of  declines by a factor of 5 .",
    "_ the abundance profile , and n@xmath1h@xmath2 depletion , is constrained by the observations and the radiative transfer ; _ however , the parameters of the chemical model may not be unique .",
    "for example , the  abundance is sensitive to e@xmath40 ( ) and the ionization fraction .",
    "observations of other molecular ions , which we are in the process of obtaining , will better constrain the ionization fraction and the binding energy .",
    "our observations and analysis provide compelling evidence for the existence of co depletion in b68 .",
    "perhaps the most interesting result of our experiment , however , is the finding of  depletion .",
    "the robustness of this result depends on the validity of our assumptions .",
    "the density profile is well constrained by observations , but the temperature structure is not .",
    "b68 is a pre - stellar core ; hence the most likely dependence is the adopted one with hot edges and a cold center .",
    "moreover , the detection of  j @xmath39 in the core center constrains the temperature in the region where depletion is dominant .",
    "opacity is a concern .",
    "the monte - carlo radiation transfer properly handles the photon propagation , but we have not accounted for the hyperfine structure or systematic line center velocity motions .",
    "however , these effects would reduce the opacity , and re - enforce the claim of depletion .",
    "consequently the evidence for  depletion in b68 is relatively firm . in our best fit model",
    "we have chosen to fit between the scatter of points at   @xmath45 mag and not the points in the emission depression .",
    "thus we likely have underestimated the  and  depletion .",
    "indeed it is entirely possible that  is almost completely frozen out in the dense center of b68 , similar to co. depletion has been found to characterize the inner regions of many quiescent cloud cores .",
    "the chemical daughter products of  (  and ) have previously been identified as the best available tracers of these regions .",
    "however , our finding of  depletion opens the possibility that the very centers of dense cores could be effectively opaque to conventional methods of observation .",
    "one casualty of this unfortunate situation is the search for infall wings using optically thin molecular emission @xcite will be hampered by depletion in the very regions where the infall speed is highest .",
    "however , because   does not deplete onto grains , its chemical daughter product , h@xmath1d@xmath46 , could therefore prove to be the best tracer of gas in the innermost regions of pre - stellar molecular cores . indeed ,",
    "because of  and co depletion , the abundance of h@xmath1d@xmath46 is expected to be large @xcite . of course , b68 could be a unique object and may be more stable than cores like l1544 .",
    "this would allow for chemistry to evolve over longer times , resulting in greater freeze out .",
    "alternatively , @xcite showed that selective depletion could lead to  destruction by gas - phase chemistry , primarily at longer timescales and higher densities . because of the potential implications of near complete molecular freeze - out , additional searches for  and depletion are needed to infer the general applicability of this result .",
    "regardless , our observations and analysis provide important constraints on the chemical evolutionary processes active in the b68 cloud .",
