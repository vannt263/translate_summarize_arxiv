    "the precise value of the mass of the @xmath0 meson has been the subject of intense debate for several years .",
    "the situation seems to have been finally resolved with the publication of four experiments that obtained consistent results to high accuracy  @xcite . in all these new experiments the meson",
    "was cleanly identified through one or more of its decay modes , @xmath9  @xcite , @xmath10  @xcite , or both  @xcite , or these plus @xmath11 and @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "taking only decay experiments into account , the particle data group now quote their `` best '' estimate of the mass as being @xmath13  mev/@xmath8  @xcite .",
    "experiments in which the @xmath0 meson was identified through a missing - mass peak in a hadronic production reaction have all reported a lower value for the mass , typically by about @xmath14  mev/@xmath8 .",
    "this was the case for the @xmath15 reaction , where the beam momentum was determined macroscopically to high precision using the floating wire technique  @xcite . in the two experiments where the @xmath16he@xmath6 reaction was used  @xcite ,",
    "the beam momentum was measured by studying other two - body reactions with known final masses .",
    "one possible concern might be whether the background under the @xmath0 peak could have been slightly distorted by a strong coupling of , for example , @xmath17he@xmath18he .",
    "alternatively , the beam momenta could have been poorly determined , though this was done using different techniques for the three experiments  @xcite , or the spectrometers aligned insufficiently well .",
    "the situation can only be clarified through the performance of a much more precise missing - mass experiment  @xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to provide results of such an investigation of the two - body @xmath2he@xmath6 reaction near threshold that is comparable in accuracy with those that studied the @xmath0 decay products  @xcite .",
    "for this to be successfully achieved , it is necessary ( i ) to establish the beam momentum , ( ii ) to identify well the @xmath0 meson from the @xmath2he@xmath3 missing - mass peak , and ( iii ) to establish the increase of the final - state momentum with excess energy @xmath19 above the @xmath20he@xmath6 reaction threshold with high accuracy . here",

    "here we are particularly fortunate in that the @xmath2he@xmath6 total cross section rises within the first 1  mev above threshold to its plateau value of @xmath22  nb and then remains nearly constant up to @xmath23  mev  @xcite .",
    "this allows one to collect similar statistics over a wide excess energy range , even very close to threshold , without expending excessive measuring time .",
    "furthermore , it has been demonstrated that the anke facility is well suited for measuring the total and differential cross sections of the @xmath2he@xmath6 reaction .",
    "the spectrometer has full geometrical acceptance for excess energies @xmath24  mev .",
    "the multipion background under the @xmath0 peak varies smoothly with @xmath25 , making a robust subtraction of this background possible  @xcite .",

    "momentum as a function of the beam momentum . due to resolution or smearing effects , which are always present in any real detector ,",
    "the reconstructed momenta can be shifted compared to the true ones . to understand and compensate for such effects ,",
    "a careful study of the entire anke spectrometer is needed .",
    "after calibrating the spectrometer by measuring a variety of other nuclear reactions , the requisite precision was achieved by demanding that the magnitude of the true @xmath1he momentum from the @xmath2he@xmath6 reaction should be identical in all directions in the c.m",
    "this check was only possible because of the 100% angular acceptance of anke for the reaction of interest .",
    "we have previously described in full the measurement of the beam momenta via the induced spin depolarization technique  @xcite .",
    "the background subtraction that allows the extraction of the @xmath0 meson signal from the @xmath2he@xmath3 reaction is essentially identical to that of our earlier work  @xcite . therefore , most of the emphasis here will be on describing the fine calibrations of the spectrometer required to get the necessary precision in the final @xmath1he momenta . after outlining the method for determining the @xmath0 mass in sec .",

    "the good agreement with other precision measurements was only achieved through the exploitation of the large angular acceptance of anke for this @xmath0-production reaction , a feature that was not available in earlier missing - mass experiments .",

    "the @xmath0 mass is extracted by measuring the relevant kinematic variables at a single fixed energy .",
    "this requires both a precise calibration of the detector , for a correct determination of the @xmath1he momentum , and an accurate measurement of the deuteron beam momentum .",
    "a much more effective way to measure the @xmath0 mass relies on the determination of the production threshold by investigating the change of the final - state momentum as a function of the beam momentum .",

    "the latter is completely fixed by the masses of the initial particles and the laboratory momentum , @xmath29 , of the deuteron beam ; @xmath30    the final - state momentum depends only on the beam momentum , the @xmath0 mass and other well - measured masses  @xcite .",
    "if one can fix the production threshold , @xmath31 , the @xmath0 mass can then be determined from knowledge of @xmath29 .",
    "the precision is enhanced because in this region @xmath32 .    an obvious advantage of the threshold determination method is that it does not require a perfect spectrometer calibration .",

    "although this shape depends slightly on @xmath36 , it is essentially a straight line over the range shown .",
    "the stability of the threshold extrapolation is illustrated by the dashed red and blue lines , where the measurements of @xmath27 are scaled by arbitrary constants @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively . ]    to reduce the sensitivity of the method to systematic errors in the spectrometer calibration , an additional scaling factor @xmath39 is introduced which multiplies the right - hand side of eq .  .",
    "such a factor will occur in a real experiment , e.g. , through minor inaccuracies in the determination of the interaction vertex relative to the detection system .",
    "if one then used data at a single excess energy , this would lead to an error in the determination of the missing mass .",
    "however , by measuring over a range of excess energies , such a scaling factor would not affect the value of @xmath29 corresponding to the production threshold that is used in the mass determination .",

    "a method to determine the beam momentum to high precision in a storage ring was developed at the electron - positron machine vepp-2 m at novosibirsk  @xcite .",
    "the technique uses the spin dynamics of a polarized beam and relies on the fact that depolarizing resonances occur at well - defined frequencies , which , apart from the gyromagnetic anomaly , depend only upon a particle s speed . by depolarizing a polarized beam with an artificial spin resonance induced by a horizontal radio frequency magnetic field of a solenoid",
    ", the value of the beam momentum can be measured to high accuracy .",
    "the frequency of such an artificial resonance @xmath40 is fixed in terms of the machine frequency @xmath41 by the relativistic @xmath42 factor of the particle . since frequencies can be routinely measured with a relative precision @xmath43 , an accurate value of @xmath42 and hence momentum can be deduced . when this method was used for the first time at cosy with a vector - polarized deuteron beam , the precision achieved was more than an order of magnitude better than that of conventional methods  @xcite .    in the cosy - anke experiment ,",
    "twelve closely - spaced beam momenta above the @xmath35 threshold were divided alternately into two so - called supercycles that involved up to seven different machine settings .",
    "in addition to six momenta above threshold , one was included below threshold in both supercycles to provide the background description .",
    "each supercycle covered an excess energy range from @xmath44  mev to @xmath45  mev .",
    "the beam momenta were measured both before and after five days of data - taking in order to study systematic effects .    in both supercycles",
    "there were collective shifts of the spin resonance frequencies of @xmath46  hz , which probably originated from changes in the orbit length in cosy of about 3  mm .",
    "the set of beam momenta from the first supercycle were found to decrease slightly over the data - taking time whereas those of the second supercycle showed the inverse behavior .",
    "average values of the measurements , before and after data - taking , were calculated for each of the twelve beam momenta and these were used in the threshold fits . the maximum uncertainty for these mean values was conservatively evaluated as @xmath47  kev/@xmath5 .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the orbits changed linearly in time to give a uniform probability distribution of true momenta over this interval .",
    "the systematic uncertainty of the averaged beam momenta is therefore estimated to be @xmath48  kev/@xmath5 ( rms ) .",
    "evidence in favor of the approach adopted here is found by comparing the results obtained with the two supercycles , which are discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : etamass ] .",
    "the statistical uncertainty in one of the twelve beam momenta in the range 3.13.2  gev/@xmath5 is dominated by that of the revolution frequency @xmath41 .",
    "the measured revolution frequency deviated randomly by up to @xmath49  hz from measurement to measurement .",
    "the rms uncertainty in this frequency , 3.5  hz , corresponds to a statistical uncertainty in the beam momentum of @xmath50  kev/@xmath5 .    in total , the twelve beam momenta were measured with an overall accuracy of @xmath51 .",
    "this is sufficient to satisfy the needs of a competitive @xmath0 mass measurement .",
    "the experiment was performed at the cooler - synchrotron of the forschungszentrum jlich  @xcite using the anke magnetic spectrometer  @xcite that is located at an internal target station of the storage ring .",
    "anke includes three dipole magnets ( d1 , d2 , d3 ) that deflect the cosy beam through a chicane in the ring ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "this allows particles produced at small angles , which would normally escape down the beam pipe , to be detected and this is of particular importance for near - threshold reactions .",
    "d1 deflects the circulating beam by an angle off its straight path onto a cluster - jet target  @xcite , the spectrometer dipole magnet d2 separates the produced particles from the beam for momentum analysis , and d3 leads the unscattered particles back onto the nominal orbit . although anke is equipped with a variety of detectors , only the forward system ( fd ) was used for the @xmath0 mass measurement .",

    "the tracks of fast charged particles detected in the anke fd - system can be traced back through the precisely known magnetic field to the interaction point and this leads to a momentum reconstruction for registered particles .",
    "in addition to the three parameters mentioned , i.e. , the magnetic field , deflection angle , and interaction point , the drift and wire chamber positions also have to be determined with high accuracy , and this requires a precise calibration of the detection system . in the standard procedure",
    "@xcite , the positions of the drift and wire chambers on the movable platform are first aligned by using data taken at the beginning of the beam time with a deflection angle of @xmath56 and no magnetic field in d2 .",

    "the global positions of the drift and wire chambers are defined by that of the moveable fd - system platform .",
    "although the positions of the platform and interaction vertex are already known by direct measurement , a much more precise determination of their values is possible by investigating a series of reference reactions at all the energies used in the @xmath0-mass determination .",

    "the correction is about 2.22  mev/@xmath5 for the lowest momentum and decreases steadily with @xmath27 .",

    "compensation for the effects of the momentum resolution is essential for an accurate determination of the production threshold . without this correction , the value obtained for the @xmath0 mass would be lower by about 150  kev/@xmath8 .",
    "in order to obtain a robust value for the mass of the @xmath0 meson , it is necessary to extrapolate the experimental data with high precision in order to determine the value of the deuteron beam momentum at threshold . for this purpose",
    "we show the complete set of final - state and beam momenta @xmath128 with statistical uncertainties in table  [ tab1:pfpd ] .",
    "also shown are the corrections that were included in the values quoted for @xmath27 .    due to the resolution effects , the twelve @xmath27 distributions are found to be slightly asymmetric over the whole angular range , both for the experimental data as well as the monte carlo simulated events , as shown for a typical energy in fig .",
    "the values of the @xmath27 means were determined for both data and simulations within @xmath84 limits .",

    "in total @xmath131 events were collected in the experiment . after applying the resolution correction to the measured @xmath27 ,",
    "the overall uncertainty is increased , as indicated in table  [ tab1:pfpd ] .",
    "although the description of the reconstructed final - state momentum distribution in fig .  [ fig8 ] by the monte carlo simulation is very good , it is not perfect , especially in the high momentum tail .",
    "such discrepancies could arise from slight imperfections in the spectrometer calibration , @xmath1he scattering in the wire chambers , or limitations in the background subtraction approach . in order to quantify their influence on the value extracted for the @xmath0 mass , the interval used to determine the means of the @xmath27",
    "was varied between @xmath132 to @xmath133 , where @xmath134 represents the peak width .",
    "such a variation leads to a collective shift in the extracted final - state momenta of approximately 0.16  mev/@xmath5 .",
    "since this effect corresponds to an overall shift in the final state momenta , it is not included in the numbers quoted in table  [ tab1:pfpd ] but must be considered in the final @xmath0 mass determination , where it introduces a systematic uncertainty of 12  kev/@xmath8 .",

    "the approximate values of @xmath25 quoted here are merely used to label the twelve settings . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     this uncertainty in the beam momentum translates into one in the mass of @xmath135 and hence , taken together with all other systematic uncertainties , to a final value of @xmath136    to investigate further some of the systematic effects , the results were extrapolated separately for the data obtained in the two supercycles and the individual values of the @xmath0 mass and the scaling factor @xmath39 are given in table  [ tab2:etamass ] .",
    "there is only a tiny difference between the two separately determined @xmath0 mass values of 7  kev/@xmath8 .",
    "this agreement supports the validity of taking the mean values of the beam momenta determined at the beginning and end of the measurements and the subsequent correct handling of the corresponding systematic uncertainties .",
    "we have measured the mass of the @xmath0 meson in a missing - mass experiment by identifying precisely the production threshold in the @xmath2he@xmath6 reaction . as is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] , the value obtained is consistent with all the recent measurements where the meson decay products were studied  @xcite .",

    "our result , cosy - anke 12 , is completely consistent with these more refined experiments . ]",
    "this success was based upon a precise determination of the beam momentum using the spin - resonance technique  @xcite , a clear identification of the @xmath0 signal  @xcite , and a systematic study of the measurement of the @xmath1he@xmath82 final - state momentum in the anke spectrometer .",
    "the latter was made possible only through the complete geometric acceptance of anke for the @xmath126 reaction close to threshold .",
    "this allowed us to require that the c.m .",
    "momentum in the final state should be identical in all directions .",
    "this is a powerful technique that might be useful for other two - body reactions . unlike the mami methodology  @xcite ,",
    "the experiment relied purely upon kinematics rather than yields to determine the threshold momentum and hence the meson mass .",
    "however , it is important to realize that the anomalous behavior of the production cross section , where the cross section jumps so rapidly with excess energy , leads to the desirable high count rates near threshold .",
    "our result differs by about 0.5  mev/@xmath8 from earlier missing - mass evaluations  @xcite and so the hypothesis of a distortion of the background under the @xmath0 peak must be discarded .",
    "unlike experiments with external targets , the energy loss in a windowless cluster jet is negligible , but the current experiment had other advantages over these measurements . in particular ,",
    "if we had access only to data taken in the forward direction , this would not have allowed the fine tuning of the spectrometer and a somewhat different value would have been found for @xmath36 .",
    "finally , twelve energies above threshold were investigated and this allowed a reliable extrapolation to be made to find the production threshold .",
    "this is intrinsically subject to far fewer systematic uncertainties than a measurement at a single energy .",
    "it is therefore clear that , with care , a missing - mass approach can be competitive with experiments in which meson decays are measured .",
