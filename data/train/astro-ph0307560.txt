    "studies of luminous ellipticals in high - density regions out to @xmath1 suggest that their stellar populations are formed via a short burst of star formation at high-@xmath2 ( probably @xmath3 ) , with little additional star formation at @xmath4 ( bower , lucey & ellis 1992 ; ellis et al.1997 ; stanford et al .",
    "1998 ; poggianti et al .",
    "2001 ; kelson et al.2001 ) .",
    "further support for this conclusion comes from the apparent lack of evolution in the metallicity of the intracluster medium out to @xmath5 ( tozzi et al .",
    "the short dynamical times expected in the densest regions at high-@xmath2 coupled with the intense star formation necessary to form the stellar population of a luminous elliptical suggest that this formation phase may resemble a classical `` monolithic '' collapse  even within a hierarchical cosmogony ( kauffmann 1996 ; baugh et al .",
    "a clear test of this paradigm is to _ directly _ observe the epoch of elliptical formation in high-@xmath2 protoclusters .",
    "there are expected to be two distinct observational signatures of this formation phase .",
    "firstly , the intensity of the star formation event and the high metallicity of the stars in ellipticals today ( as well as the intracluster medium ) all argue that this activity will produce a large amount of dust .",
    "this will obscure the later phases of the starburst and the most active systems , those with star formation rates of @xmath6@xmath7yr@xmath8 , would be classed as ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) with far - infrared luminosities of @xmath9 .",
    "the sensitivity of submillimeter ( submm ) cameras such as scuba on the jcmt is sufficient to detect these systems out to @xmath10 ( chapman et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the second observational signature derives from the apparently close correlation seen locally between the mass of central black holes and the mass of the spheroid which hosts them ( kormendy & richstone 1995 ; magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ; ferrarese & merritt 2000 ) , which in turn suggests a tight linkage between the formation of these components .",
    "as the most massive spheroids , luminous cluster ellipticals are expected to host supermassive black holes ( smbh ) , @xmath11m@xmath12 .",
    "thus many young ellipticals may also exhibit signatures of nuclear activity as their smbh will be actively fueled and growing during the dusty starburst phase , and should be detectable in deep x - ray imaging .    to investigate the formation of the elliptical galaxy population of rich clusters using these observational tools we need to identify the likely site of their formation : proto - clusters at @xmath3 .",
    "in standard cosmological models , massive galaxies at @xmath3 are expected to strongly cluster in the deepest potential wells , onto which other galaxies later accrete , assembling the rich clusters we see at @xmath13 .",
    "the strongly clustered population of luminous high-@xmath2 radio galaxies ( hzrg ) are believed to host massive black holes and thus may represent some of the most massive galaxies at these epochs ( e.g.  de breuck et al .",
    "2000 ) which in turn could trace some of the highest density environments .",

    "moreover , one of these x - ray sources has the same redshift as the radio galaxy in its vicinity and a second is also likely to be at the same redshift as its neighboring hzrg .",

    "our identifications of _ chandra _ counterparts to the scuba galaxies in these fields are statistical in nature and hence the possibility exists that the two populations are simply tracing the same large - scale structures , rather than being _ directly _ related .",
    "however , the relatively small spatial scale of the associations,@xmath81kpc , suggests that there is a direct relationship and so the following discussion proceeds on that assumption .    the rate of detection of scuba sources in our _ chandra _ maps is @xmath82% , this is somewhat higher than the @xmath8310% detection rate reported from comparable - depth _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observations ( barger et al .",

    "we also identify a significant overdensity of _ chandra _ sources within a 1-mpc region around the radio source in the 4c41.17 field , in both the soft and hard - bands .",
    "similar overdensities have been previously reported around mrc1138@xmath18262 ( p02 ) and 53w002 ( white et al .",
    "2003 ) , suggesting that the environment of hzrgs at @xmath3 are also fertile ground for triggering agn activity .",
    "this activity appears to be linked to the excess of luminous submm sources found in these regions , as can be seen if we measure the mean submm flux of _ all _ _ chandra _ sources within our scuba maps .",
    "we estimate a mean flux of @xmath88mjy from the 15 soft - band sources ( excluding the 3 radio galaxies ) .",
    "this flux is roughly twice that of blank - field _ chandra _ sources at similar x - ray flux limits ( almaini et al .",

    "2003 ) , although the result is only significant at the @xmath35-@xmath59 level due to the small sample size .",

    "2003b ) .    these scuba galaxies with pairs of _ chandra _ counterparts are remarkable systems  suggesting that the ultraluminous scuba events are triggered by the interaction between multiple ( ?",
    ") massive galaxies . the activity in these paired _",
    "chandra _ sources implies that they are currently interacting and their separations then suggests that the pericentric passage probably occured within the last @xmath91myrs , consistent with the expected life time of the starbursts in scuba galaxies ( smail et al .",
    "moreover , the presence of smbhs in the progenitors means they have either been formed on the timescale of the current interaction , or these galaxies had sufficient prior activity to build a smbh ( and by implication a massive spheroid ) , yet still retain significant quantities of gas needed to power the current , obscured starburst .",
    "the final merger of these pairs of galaxies , probably within the next 100200myrs or by @xmath92 for the 4c41.17 pair , will produce a remanent which hosts two smbhs .",
    "the interaction of the two smbhs is predicted to produce a flattening of the stellar distribution in the core of the remanent ( ravindranath , ho & filippenko 2002 ) .",
    "this is a structural feature common to bright elliptical galaxies , and also one which is preferentially found in ellipticals in clusters ( laine et al .",
    "2003 ; quillen , bower & stritzinger 2000 ) .",
    "hence the identification of multiple _ chandra _ sources within a modest fraction of the scuba population is consistent with the expectation that these galaxies will evolve into luminous ellipticals at the present - day and that the environments we find them in at high-@xmath2 are regions which will go on to become the cores of rich clusters .",
    "however , the relatively modest mass estimates we derive for these smbh , @xmath93@xmath94m@xmath12 , compared to the @xmath95m@xmath12 smbhs found in bright ellipticals today gives scope for subsequent growth of the smbhs in these systems during the final stages of the merger .",
    "the success rate for identifying _",
    "counterparts to scuba galaxies in our x - ray images suggests that x - ray observations may provide a useful route to localise the submm - emitting galaxies in these regions .",
    "this would normally be achieved through sensitive radio observations ( e.g.  ivison et al .",
    "2002 ) , but the presence of the very bright radio source in these fields restricts the depth that can be achieved due to dynamic - range limitations .",
    "we summarise the main results of this work .",
    "we study moderate depth x - ray observations of luminous submm galaxies in the fields of three luminous radio galaxies at @xmath743.8 .",
    "we identify a significant overdensity of x - ray sources around the most distant target , 4c41.17 at @xmath37 .",
    "we also identify possible x - ray counterparts to 4 submm galaxies in these fields ( as well as the 3 submm - luminous central radio galaxies ) .",
    "these associations either indicate a direct relationship between the _ chandra _ and scuba sources , or simply that both populations are tracing the same large - scale structures .",
    "spectroscopic and narrow - band imaging suggests that two of these _ chandra _ sources lie at the same redshifts as their neighbouring hzrgs , hence our identification of these objects as submm sources extends the number of dusty , ultraluminous galaxies likely to reside in structures around radio galaxies at @xmath3 .",
    "we also highlight the properties of two of these submm galaxies , one appears to be associated with at least _ two _ _ chandra _ sources , while the second has a _",
    "counterpart and also a bright x - ray companion in close proximity .",
    "these results suggest that the ultraluminous activity in some fraction of the scuba population may result from the interaction of pairs of massive galaxies , each of which can be identified by the x - ray emission from their central supermassive black holes .",
    "the presence of two smbhs in the resulting merger remanent is predicted to produce a clear structural signature , a flattened core , in the stellar profile .",

    "<S> we compare sensitive _ chandra _ x - ray images  which identify actively - fueled smbhs  and submm observations  </S>",
    "<S> capable of detecting obscured activity in luminous galaxies at high redshift  of the environments of three hzrgs . </S>",
    "<S> these observations exhibit overdensities of x - ray sources in all three fields and a close correspondence between the _ chandra _ and scuba populations . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that both substantial star formation and nuclear activity may be occuring in these regions . </S>",
    "<S> we identify possible pairs of _ chandra _ sources with each of two scuba sources , suggesting that their ultraluminous activity may be triggered by the interaction of two _ massive _ galaxies , each of which hosts an accreting smbh . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of two smbhs in the resulting remanent is predicted to produce a flattened stellar core in the galaxy , a morphological signature frequently seen in luminous cluster ellipticals . </S>",
    "<S> hence the confirmation of pairs of _ chandra _ sources within individual , luminous scuba galaxies would provide additional evidence that these galaxies at @xmath04 are the progenitors of the giant elliptical galaxies found in clusters at the present - day . </S>"
