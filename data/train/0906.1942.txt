    "the renormalization group approach to disordered statistical mechanics systems introduces a very interesting viewpoint on the role of disorder and on whether or not the critical behavior of a quenched system coincides with the critical behavior of the corresponding _ pure _ system .",
    "the harris criterion @xcite is based on such an approach and it may be summarized in the following way : if the specific heat exponent of the pure system is negative , then a _ small _ amount of disorder does not modify the critical properties of the pure system ( _ irrelevant disorder regime _ ) , but if the specific heat exponent of the pure system is positive then even an arbitrarily small amount of disorder may lead to a quenched critical behavior different from the critical behavior of the pure system .",
    "a class of disordered models on which such ideas have been applied by several authors is the one of pinning models ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite and the extensive bibliography in @xcite ) .",
    "the reason is in part due to the remarkable fact that pure pinning models are exactly solvable models for which , by tuning a parameter , one can explore all possible values of the specific heat exponent @xcite . as a matter of fact , the validity of harris criterion for pinning models in the physical literature finds a rather general agreement .",
    "moreover , for the pinning models the renormalization group approach goes beyond the critical properties and yields a prediction also on the location of the critical point .    recently , the harris criterion predictions for pinning models have been put on firm grounds in a series of papers @xcite and some of these rigorous results go even beyond the predictions .",
    "notably in @xcite it has been shown that disorder has a smoothing effect in this class of models ( a fact that is not a consequence of the harris criterion and that does not find unanimous agreement in the physical literature ) .",
    "however , a substantial amount of the literature on disordered pinning and harris criterion revolves around a specific issue : what happens if the specific heat exponent is zero ( _ i.e. _ at _ marginality _ ) ?",
    "this is really a controversial issue in the physical literature , started by the disagreement in the conclusions of @xcite and @xcite . in a nutshell ,",
    "the disagreement lies on the fact that the authors of @xcite predict that disorder is irrelevant at marginality and , notably , that quenched and annealed critical points coincide at small disorder , while the authors of @xcite claim that disorder is relevant for arbitrarily small disorder , leading to a critical point shift of the order of @xmath8 ( @xmath1 ) for @xmath9 ( @xmath2 is the disorder variance ) .",
    "recently we have been able to prove that , at marginality , there is a shift of the critical point induced by the presence of disorder @xcite , at least for gaussian disorder .",
    "we have actually proven that the shift is at least @xmath10 .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to go beyond @xcite in three aspects :    1 .",
    "we want to deal with rather general disorder variables : we are going to assume only that the exponential moments are finite .",
    "we are going to improve the bound @xmath11 , @xmath12 , on the critical point shift , to @xmath13 ( @xmath14 arbitrarily small , and @xmath15 ) .",
    "3 .   we will prove our results for a generalized class of pinning models .",
    "pinning models are based on discrete renewal processes , characterized by an inter - arrival distribution which has power - law decay ( the exponent in the power law parametrizes the model and varying such parameter one explores the different types of critical behaviors we mentioned before ) .",
    "the generalized pinning model is obtained by relaxing the power law decay to regularly varying decay , that is ( in particular ) we allow _ logarithmic correction _ to power - law decay . this , in a sense , allows zooming into the marginal case and makes clearer the interplay between the underlying renewal and the disorder variables .      in mathematical terms ,",
    "disordered pinning models are one - dimensional gibbs measures with random one - body potentials and reference measure given by the law of a renewal process .",
    "namely , pinning models are built starting from a ( non - delayed , discrete ) renewal process @xmath16 , that is a sequence of random variables such that @xmath17 and @xmath18 are independent and identically distributed with common law ( called _ inter - arrival distribution _ ) concentrated on @xmath19 ( the law of @xmath20 is denoted by @xmath21 ) : we will actually assume that such a distribution is regularly varying of exponent @xmath22 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 is a slowly varying function , that is @xmath26 is measurable and it satisfies @xmath27 for every @xmath1 .",

    "( this is probably not a standard terminology , but it will come handy ) , that is the positive measurable functions that behave like @xmath28 as @xmath29 , with @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "these functions are just a particular class of slowly varying functions , but it is already rich enough to appreciate the results we are going to present . moreover",
    "we will say that @xmath25 is trivial if @xmath32 . the general statements about slowly varying function that we are going to use can be verified in an elementary way for logarithmic slowly varying functions ; readers who feel uneasy with the general theory may safely focus on this restricted class .    without loss of generality",
    "we assume that @xmath33 ( actually , we have implicitly done so when we have introduced @xmath20 ) .",
    "this does not look at all like an innocuous assumption at first , because it means that @xmath20 is _ persistent _ , namely @xmath34 for every @xmath35 , while if @xmath36 then @xmath20 is _ terminating _ , that is @xmath37 a.s .. it is however really a harmless assumption , as explained in detail in ( * ? ? ?",

    "the presence of @xmath59 in the right - hand side means that we are looking only at trajectories that are _ pinned _ at the endpoint of the system .",
    "this is just a boundary condition and we may as well remove @xmath59 for the purpose of the results that we are going to state , since it is well known for example that the free energy of this system is independent of the boundary condition ( _ e.g. _ ( * ? ? ?",

    "the main focus of @xcite , is on the case @xmath115 and trivial @xmath25 .",

    "the conclusions of the two papers differ : @xcite stands for @xmath120 for @xmath114 small , while in @xcite one finds an argument in favor of @xmath123 as @xmath9 ( with @xmath1 an explicit constant ) .",
    "we will not go into the details of these arguments , but we wish to point out why , in these arguments , @xmath115 plays such a singular role .    1 .   in the approach of @xcite an expansion of the free energy to all orders in the variance of @xmath124 , that is @xmath125 , is performed . in particular ( in the gaussian case ) @xmath126 and , when @xmath25 is trivial , @xmath127 behaves like ( a constant times ) @xmath128 for @xmath129 ( this is detailed for example in @xcite ) and like a constant for @xmath130 .",
    "this suggests that the expansion can not work for @xmath110 , because the second - order term , for @xmath131 , becomes larger than the first order term ( @xmath132 ) .",
    "the borderline case is @xmath115 , and trust in such an expansion for @xmath115 may follow from the fact that @xmath114 can be chosen small . in conclusion ,",
    "an argument along the lines of @xcite predicts disorder relevance if and only if @xmath110 ( if @xmath25 is trivial ) .",
    "the approach of @xcite instead is based on the analysis of @xmath133 at the pure critical point @xmath98 .",
    "this directly leads to studying the random set @xmath134 ( it appears in the computation in a very natural way , we call it _ intersection renewal _ ) , with @xmath135 an independent copy of @xmath20 ( note that @xmath136 is still a renewal process ) : in physical terms , one is looking at the _ two - replica system_. it turns out that , even if we have assumed @xmath20 persistent , @xmath137 may not be : in fact , if @xmath25 is trivial , then @xmath138 is persistent if and only if @xmath139 ( see just below for a proof of this fact ) . and @xcite predicts disorder relevance if and only if @xmath140 .",
    "some aspects of these two approaches were made rigorous mathematically : the expansion of the free energy was proved to hold for @xmath141 in @xcite , and the second moment analysis of @xcite was used to prove _ disorder irrelevance _ in @xcite , making it difficult to choose between the predictions .",
    "we can actually find in the physical literature a number of authors standing for one or the other of the two predictions in the marginal case @xmath115 ( the reader can find a detailed review of the literature in @xcite ) .",
    "but we would like to go a step farther and we point out that , by generalizing naively the approach in @xcite , one is tempted to conjecture disorder relevance ( at arbitrarily small @xmath114 ) if and only if the intersection renewal is recurrent .",
    "let us make this condition explicit : while one does not have direct access to the inter - arrival distribution of @xmath138 , it is straightforward , by independence , to write the renewal function of @xmath138 : @xmath142 it is then sufficient to use the basic ( and general ) renewal process formula @xmath143 to realize that @xmath138 is persistent if and only if @xmath144 .",

    "we point out that @xmath154 is a special type of slowly varying function ( a _ den haan function _",
