    "a rigid sphere falling through a viscous medium is a classic problem in fluid dynamics , which was first solved in the steady state for the limit of vanishingly small reynolds number in an infinite domain by g. g. stokes in 1851 @xcite .",
    "the time - dependent approach to the steady state allows the partial differential equation for the sphere and fluid to be reduced to an integrodifferential equation for the motion of the sphere in an infinite medium .",
    "the physical effects included in this equation are the buoyancy which drives the motion , the inertia of the sphere , the viscous drag , an added mass term , and a memory or history integral @xcite .    in the case of a _",
    "newtonian fluid _ , the main effect of the memory integral on the dynamics is to modify the approach to steady state from exponential to algebraic .",
    "the integral also makes the equation effectively second order , though it is generally accepted that no oscillations occur as the sphere reaches its steady state value @xcite .",
    "physically it is clear that no oscillations can occur due to the absence of a restoring force against gravity , and a sphere released from rest in a newtonian fluid at low reynolds number is observed to reach its terminal velocity monotonically .",
    "however , it is not directly evident mathematically that oscillating solutions are precluded , particularly as the governing integrodifferential equation can be transformed to a nonautonomous second order ordinary differential equation which has the form of a harmonic oscillator @xcite .    in",
    "a _ non - newtonian fluid _ , such as a polymer solution , a falling sphere is often observed to undergo transient oscillations before reaching its terminal velocity @xcite .",
    "these oscillations occur due to the elasticity of the fluid , which provides a restoring force @xcite .",
    "the steady state value is of primary concern in many applications , and much work focuses only on this aspect of the problem .",
    "the oscillations which occur during the approach to steady state have been reproduced in a linear viscoelastic model by king and waters @xcite .",
    "more recently , _",
    "nontransient _ oscillations of falling spheres ( and rising bubbles ) have been observed in specific aqueous solutions of surfactants ( wormlike micellar solutions ) @xcite .",
    "these observations were initially made for a bubble in the wormlike micellar fluid ctab / nasal @xcite , which showed oscillations in its position and shape .",
    "the shape oscillations included an apparent cusp which momentarily appears at the trailing end of the bubble .",
    "such a cusplike tail is a well known property of rising bubbles in non - newtonian fluids @xcite , which we initially believed to play an important role in the micellar oscillations .",
    "= 5.5 cm    @xmath0    subsequent observations of solid spheres which also oscillate while falling through the same solutions made it clear that the cusp is not involved in the phenomenon , and that another explanation must be sought .",
    "unlike a sedimenting sphere in a conventional non - newtonian fluid , these oscillations do not appear to be transient @xcite .",
    "an example is given in figure [ f - expt ] , which shows the motion of a 1/8  teflon sphere falling through a tube ( @xmath1 cm , @xmath2 cm ) filled with a 6 mm 1:1 solution of ctab / nasal @xcite .",
    "our attempts to model this phenomenon brought to our attention the unusual aspects of the integrodifferential equation for a falling sphere . we prove here that the equation for sedimenting sphere in a newtonian fluid in the limit of zero reynolds number ( creeping flow ) does not admit oscillating solutions , despite some appearances that it does .",
    "this result is due to the special properties of the error function when multiplied by oscillating functions .",
    "it is ultimately related to the stability of nonautonomous ordinary differential equations with monotone secular terms , which is appropriately viewed as an initial value problem , and not in terms of linear stability analysis around the terminal velocity .",
    "we begin by reviewing some classical results for the equation of motion governing a falling sphere in a viscous newtonian fluid of infinite extent ( no boundaries ) .",
    "an incompressible fluid in the absence of body forces is described by the equations @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the density of the fluid , @xmath5 is the pressure , @xmath6 is the velocity field for the fluid , and @xmath7 is the extra stress tensor , which measures force per unit area ( other than pressure ) in the present configuration of the fluid .",
    "a newtonian fluid is a fluid for which the stress tensor @xmath8 is linearly related to the rate of strain tensor @xmath9 through the relation @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the viscosity of the fluid and @xmath12 is the symmetric part of the velocity gradient @xmath13 . from ( [ ce2]),([ce3 ] ) , and ( [ st ] ) one obtains the navier - stokes equation : @xmath14    non - newtonian fluids are fluids for which the assumption ( [ st ] ) is invalid . for instance ,",
    "polymeric and viscoelastic fluids often fail to conform to the instantaneous relation between stress and velocity gradients implicit in ( [ st ] )",
    ". in general @xmath15 will depend nonlinearly on @xmath9 and on the past history of stress in the fluid .    by choosing a time scale and an appropriate length scale , ( [ ns ] ) can be written in a nondimensional form @xmath16 where , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the nondimensional velocity and pressure .",
    "the dimensionless constant @xmath19 is called the reynolds number and it measures the relative importance of inertial effects to that of viscous effects .",
    "when the inertial effects are negligible ( @xmath20 ) , equation ( [ ns ] ) is called the stokes equation . in this paper",
    "we restrict our analysis to this situation .",
    "stokes solved the steady version of ( [ ns2])-([incomp2 ] ) for the case of sphere falling though the fluid for vanishing reynolds number .",
    "the stokes solution gives the steady state drag on the sphere of radius @xmath21 falling through a fluid with a steady speed @xmath22 to be @xmath23 .",
    "however , in order to solve the transient problem of falling sphere , we first solve the problem of sphere oscillating with a frequency @xmath24 and compute the drag experienced by the sphere as a function of @xmath24 .",
    "the drag experienced by a sphere falling at a arbitrary speed @xmath25 can then be computed as a fourier integral of this drag .",
    "consider a sphere of radius @xmath21 and density @xmath26 in a newtonian fluid of density @xmath27 and viscosity @xmath11 .",
    "the exterior stokes flow driven by small oscillations of the sphere at a frequency @xmath24 can be solved exactly @xcite , which leads to a hydrodynamic force dependent on both @xmath22 and @xmath28 : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a diffusive lengthscale common to stokes problems , and @xmath31 is the kinematic viscosity . using this",
    ", the general time - dependent problem of the motion of a falling sphere can be reduced from a partial to an ordinary differential equation for the speed @xmath25 of the sphere , an exact equation which takes into account the motion of the surrounding fluid @xcite . for a sphere moving with an arbitrary speed @xmath25",
    ", the hydrodynamic drag it experiences can be calculated by representing @xmath25 as a fourier integral : @xmath32 the drag for each fourier component is then given by ( [ eq : fw - drag ] ) .",
    "the total hydrodynamic drag on the sphere is obtained by integrating over all fourier components , leading to @xmath33 where the first term represents the steady state drag on a sphere falling with a velocity @xmath22 , the second term represents the added mass term ( the force required to accelerate the surrounding fluid ) , the third term is the basset memory term , and @xmath34 is the volume of the sphere . if the sphere starts from rest , then the lower limit of the integral in ( [ eq : f - net ] ) starts from @xmath35 instead of @xmath36 .",
    "the expression for the unsteady drag force can then be substituted into the balance of force equation for the sphere : @xmath37 thus the equation of motion for the sphere is @xmath38 which can be rewritten in the simpler form @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 is the density difference which drives the motion . in this approach the motion of the sphere is described by an integrodifferential equation whose integral term has the same singularity as abel s equation @xcite .",
    "note that this equation is only valid in the limit of zero reynolds number @xcite .",
    "physically one expects the solution @xmath25 to approach a terminal velocity .",
    "it is clear from ( [ eq : uprime ] ) that the only steady state solution ( @xmath42 ) possible is @xmath43 which is the classical result of balancing the stokes drag with the buoyancy .",

    "@xmath46 with this rescaling ( [ eq : uprime ] ) becomes @xmath47 where the control parameter @xmath48 is given by @xmath49 thus the motion of the sphere depends only on the relative densities of the sphere and the fluid through the parameter @xmath48 .",
    "the density of the sphere @xmath26 can range from zero to infinity , which implies a parameter range @xmath50 . when the density of the sphere is equal to the density of the fluid , @xmath51 and @xmath52 . here",

    "we are primarily concerned with the asymptotic behavior of ( [ eq : non - dim1 ] ) . moreover , since the nonautonomous term tends to zero as @xmath60 , one might expect the stability of ( [ eq : non - dim1 ] ) to mimic the homogeneous problem . with this in mind , let @xmath61 and @xmath62 denote the roots of the characteristic equation @xmath63 it",

    "moreover , the roots have positive real parts for @xmath65 .",
    "since the relevant range of @xmath48 for a falling sphere is @xmath53 , one sees that oscillations are not a priori precluded . in terms of the actual densities of the fluid and sphere the condition for complex roots corresponds to @xmath66 , which is true in the case of a heavy sphere falling through a lighter liquid ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "if additionally @xmath68 , then the complex roots have positive real parts . if we rewrite ( [ eq : non - dim1 ] ) in the asymptotic limit ( @xmath69 ) as a first order linear system @xmath70 where @xmath71 , and @xmath72 , then @xmath73 is the unique equilibrium point , which corresponds to the terminal velocity .",
    "the eigenvalues of this system are precisely @xmath61 and @xmath62 , whence the equilibrium point becomes unstable .    nonetheless , as we will show , even in this range ( @xmath74 ) , the solution to the full equation ( [ eq : non - dim1 ] ) _ monotonically _ approaches the value 1 , corresponding to the monotonic approach to the steady stokes value ( [ e - stokes ] ) for the actual velocity @xmath22 .",

    "one finds the solution @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the solution defined by ( [ eq : soln ] ) .",
    "note that the solution for arbitrary initial velocity @xmath87 is a simple rescaling of the solution for the sphere initially at rest .",

    "this is an indication that the product @xmath97 should be considered as a special function with its own properties .",
    "we begin with the transient solution to the ide or ode considered in the previous section . in addition to the insensitivity of the transient solution to the real part of the homogeneous roots ,",
    "it is surprising that the nonzero complex part does not lead to _ any _ oscillations in the velocity of the sphere , although there has sometimes been confusion on this point regarding transient oscillations @xcite .",

    "@xmath182 there exists a unique choice of initial values @xmath176 , @xmath183 such that the solution @xmath159 remains monotone for all @xmath111 .",
    "therefore the presence of a singularity at @xmath164 in the nonhomogeneous term is not necessary to obtain a monotone solution .    in light of the above analysis it becomes clear how the solution for the sedimenting sphere remains monotone in its approach to terminal velocity for _ all _ relevant values of @xmath48 ( i.e. , sphere densities ) . from equations ( [ eq : non - dim1])-([eq : non - dim2 ] ) we see that for each value of @xmath48 , equation ( [ gensho ] ) describes the dynamics for the dimensionless velocity @xmath184 , with @xmath185 , @xmath186 , and @xmath187 .",
    "moreover , for each @xmath98 we have demonstrated that equation ( [ gensho ] ) with @xmath186 , @xmath188 , and @xmath187 , has a unique initial value for which the solution remains monotone , namely , @xmath189 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 denote the roots of the polynomial @xmath190 .",

    "we have shown that there is a unique set of initial conditions that defines a solution to the nonhomogeneous problem which approaches the unstable fixed point @xmath156 monotonically , despite the surrounding instabilities .",
    "thus we return to the fundamental puzzle posed in section [ asympt ] : how is it that the nonautonomous term in ( [ eq : odealg ] ) , which decays to zero as @xmath69 , can `` stabilize '' a trajectory for all @xmath196 , in the sense that this solution approaches 0 while all other trajectories diverge due to the instability of the linearized problem ?",
    "the following observation resolves the puzzle .",
    "first , recall that the unique initial conditions for which the nonhomogeneous problem remains monotone are defined by @xmath197 second , note that as the amplitude @xmath194 of the nonhomogeneous term tends to zero , the initial conditions @xmath198 approach @xmath199 .",
    "this corresponds to the initial condition starting on the unstable equilibrium point , which is the unique initial condition for the homogeneous problem whose solution does not diverge . in other words",
    "we have a correspondence between the trajectories of the homogeneous equation and the nonhomogeneous equation , which is continuous with respect to the parameter @xmath194 .",
    "the monotone solution is then the image of the unstable fixed point under this map .",
    "in this paper we have studied the ode model for a sphere falling through a newtonian fluid .",
    "we have proven that the equations do not admit oscillations , even in the transient , in agreement with general experimental observations .    from our analysis",
    "it appears that the lack of oscillations is due to a delicate balance of terms .",
    "it is tempting to conclude that an oscillating motion could be produced with only a slight modification to the equations .",
    "however it is important that the solution still remain bounded , and as we have shown there is only one trajectory which is insensitive to the linear instability ( @xmath200 ) of the homogeneous equation .",
    "transient oscillations of a falling sphere have been successfully modeled by king & waters using an elastic constitutive model @xcite , for which a final steady state velocity is approached .    in principle , however , one can not simply modify the differential equation ( [ eq : non - dim1 ] ) or even ( [ eq : maineq ] ) to address the oscillations of a sedimenting sphere in a micellar fluid @xcite ; one must return to the full time - dependent partial differential equation .",
    "this was indeed how king & waters obtained their result for a linear viscoelastic constitutive model @xcite , but it is not clear that this approach will continue to be fruitful as the complexity of the problem increases .",
    "self - assembling wormlike micellar solutions are thought to have a nonmonotonic stress / shear rate relation @xcite , based on the existence of an apparently inaccessible range of shear rates @xcite .",
    "it may be that the dynamics of such a nonlinear fluid requires the spatial information inherent in the pdes , and that the ode reduction discussed here is practically limited to linear models .",
