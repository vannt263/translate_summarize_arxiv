    "over 50 years after the discovery of the first meson and over 25 years after the identification of its underlying quark degrees of freedom , the strong - interaction bound - state problem remains unsolved .",
    "perhaps eventually the full spectrum of mesonic and baryonic states will be calculated directly from quantum chromodynamics via lattice gauge theory .",
    "this would require use of techniques that were unknown to the founding fathers of qed .",
    "for the present though , researchers have had to content themselves with attempts to extend bits and pieces of traditional qed bound - state treatments into the realm of qcd .",
    "unfortunately , for those bound systems whose constituent kinetic or potential energies are comparable to constituent rest masses , nonrelativistic techniques are inadequate from the start .    in the qed bound - state problem , weakness of the coupling permitted calculation through perturbation about the nonrelativistic quantum mechanics of the schrdinger equation . using the equation adopted by breit",
    "@xcite-@xcite(eventually justified by the bethe - salpeter equation @xcite ) , one was faced with the fact that a nonperturbative numerical treatment of the breit equation could not yield spectral results that agree to an appropriate order with a perturbative treatment of the semirelativistic form of that equation@xcite-@xcite .",
    "this form of the equation contained such terms as contact terms bred by the vector darwin interaction that could be treated only perturbatively , spoiling the interpretation of the breit equation as a bona - fide wave equation .",
    "forays into the full relativistic structure defined by the bethe - salpeter equation turned up fundamental problems which fortunately could be sidestepped for qed due to the smallness of @xmath0 .    in the absence of definitive guidance from qed , in recent years researchers in qcd have felt free to jump off from any point that had proven historically useful in qed .",
    "some have chosen to approach the spectrum using time - honored forms from the `` relativistic correction structure '' of atomic physics .",
    "others have employed truncations of field - theoretic bound - state equations in hopes that the truncations do no violence to the dynamical structures or their relativistic transformation properties . a third set",
    "have broken away from qed by choosing to guess at `` relativistic wave equations '' as though such equations have no connection to field theory .",
    "is there another way to attack this problem ?",
    "imagine that we could replace the schrodinger equation by a many - body relativistic schrodinger equation or improved breit equation that could be solved numerically .",
    "one would have to establish its validity by connecting it to quantum field theory , and its utility by solving it for qcd .",
    "of course such an approach would apply equally as well to qed and so would have to recapitulate the known results of qed .",
    "( these results might reemerge in unfamiliar forms since not originating in the usual expansion about the nonrelativistic limit . )    now , for the two - body bound - state problem , there is such an equation or rather a system of two coupled dirac equations - for an interacting pair of relativistic spin one - half constituents .",
    "it turns out that for the two - body case , use of dirac s constrained hamiltonian mechanics @xcite-@xcite in a form appropriate for two spinning particles @xcite , @xcite ( pseudo - classical mechanics using grassmann degrees of freedom@xcite,@xcite)leads to a consistent relativistic quantum description . in the two - body case , one may explicitly construct the covariant center of momentum rest frame of the interacting system .",
    "in fact , the relativistic two - body problem may be written as an effective relativistic one - body problem @xcite , @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the proper formulation of this relativistic scheme requires the successful treatment of the quantum ghost states ( due to the presence of the relative time ) that first appeared in nakanishi s work on the bethe - salpeter equation@xcite .",
    "it might seem that although fully covariant and quantum mechanically legitimate , such an approach would merely give a sophisticated method for guessing relativistic wave equations for systems of bound quarks .",
    "however , this method assumes its full power when combined with the field - theoretic machinery of the bethe - salpeter equation . when used with the kernel of the bethe - salpeter equation for qed , our approach combines weak - potential agreement with qed @xcite with the nonperturbative structure of the field - theoretic eikonal approximation@xcite,@xcite . the extra structure is automatically inherited from relativistic classical@xcite , @xcite and quantum mechanics@xcite . in qed",
    "our approach amounts to a quantum - mechanical transform  @xcite,@xciteof the bethe salpeter equation provided by two coupled dirac equations whose fully covariant interactions are determined by qed in the feynman gauge@xcite,@xcite .",
    "these two - body dirac equations  are legitimate quantum wave equations that can be solved directly @xcite,@xcite(without perturbation theory ) whose numerical or analytic solutions automatically agree with results generated by ordinary perturbative treatment .",
    "( in our opinion the importance of this agreement can not be overemphasized .",
    "a common fault of most of the models we discuss in this paper is that they lack such agreement .",
    "but , if a numerical approach to a two body bound state formalism when specialized to qed can not reproduce the results given by its own perturbative treatment , how can one be certain that its application to highly relativistic qcd bound states will not include spurious short range contributions . )    of course there is a fly in the ointment - but one to be expected on fundamental grounds .",
    "it turns out that the only separable interacting system as yet explicitly constructed in a canonical relativistic mechanics is the two body system . in practical terms",
    ", this means that we must confine the present treatment to the meson spectrum .",
    "so far , even the relativistic treatment of the three - body problem of qed in the constraint approach is unknown .",
    "no one has been able to produce three compatible separable dirac equations which include not only mutual interactions but also necessary three body forces in closed form@xcite .",
    "although still considered unusual or unfamiliar by the bulk of bound - state researchers , the structures appearing in these equations may have been anticipated classically by j. l. synge , the spin structures were introduced into qed ( incorrectly ) by eddington and gaunt@xcite,@xcite , and they have appeared in approximate forms appropriate for weak potentials in the works of krapchev , aneva , and rizov@xcite and of pilkuhn@xcite .",
    "of greatest surprise but greatest value ( to the authors ) , their perturbative weak - potential versions were uncovered in qed by j. schwinger in his virial treatment of the positronium spectrum@xcite .",
    "the associated relativistic mechanics transforms properly under spin - dependent generalizations of generators found by pryce @xcitenewton and wigner@xcite .",
    "the techniques for quantization go back to those found by dirac@xcite , and applied by regge and hanson to the relativistic top@xcite , by nambu to the string , by galvao and teitelboim to the single spin one - half particle @xcite , and by kalb and van alstine @xciteand by todorov@xcite to the pair of spinless particles .",
    "their progenitors can be found in the bilocal field theories of yukawa , markov , feynman and gell - mann as well as the myriad treatments of the relativistic oscillator beginning with the work of schrdinger .    in this paper",
    ", we will compare our latest results for the meson spectrum provided by two - body dirac equations with the corresponding results given by a representative sample of alternative methods .",
    "the present paper is not a detailed account of this method ( already presented elsewhere - see refs.@xcite@xciteand references contained therein ) . neither is it an attempt to conduct an even - handed or thorough review",
    "rather , its purpose is to show how such an organized scheme fares in the real world of calculation of a relativistic spectrum and to contrast its results with those produced by an array of approaches , each chosen on account of popularity or structural resemblances or differences with our approach . in this paper",
    "we consider only approaches like ours that do not restrict themselves to the heavy mesons but attempt fits to the entire spectrum thus obtaining a more demanding comparison .",
    "( we do not consider here the myriad of partial spectral results for either the light or heavy mesons appearing in the recent literature ) .",
    "where possible , we shall show how certain distinguishing features of the various approaches are responsible for success or failure of the resulting fits to the meson spectrum .",
    "whether our equations ultimately prove correct or not , they have the virtue that they are explicitly numerically solvable without additional revisions , cutoffs , etc . unlike certain other approaches",
    "whose spectral consequences depend on ad hoc revision necessary for numerical solution .",
    "all of the treatments we examine attempt to describe the interactions of qcd through the inclusion of spin - dependent interactions that in part first appeared as small corrections in atomic physics .",
    "all include relativistic kinematics for the constituents . one contributor to the use of such techniques",
    "@xcite has even asserted that all of the alternative approaches that include relativistic kinematics are actually equivalent to the nonrelativistic quark model , so that the detailed relativistic structure of the interaction makes no difference to the bound state spectrum .",
    "however , as we shall see in a fully relativistic description with no extraneous parameters , the detailed relativistic interaction structure in fact determines the success or failure of a calculation of the full meson spectrum from a single equation .",
    "the order of the paper is as follows :    first , in section ii , we review enough of the structures of our two - body dirac equations and their origins in relativistic constraint dynamics to make clear the equations that we are solving and the relativistic significances of the potential structures appearing in them .",
    "( those readers who are already familiar with constraint dynamics might wish to go directly to the qcd applications of section iii . )  in section iii , we detail how we incorporate the interactions of qcd into our equations by constructing the relativistic version of the adler - piran static quark potential@xcite that we use when we apply our equations to meson spectroscopy . in section iv , we examine the numerical spectral results that are generated by this application of the two - body dirac equations .",
    "the feature of our approach that most distinguishes it from other more traditional  two - body formalisms is its use of  two coupled constituent equations ( instead of one ) containing two - body minimal substitution forms and related structures that incorporate the minimal interaction form of the original one - body dirac equation . in section",
    "v we rewite this form of the two body dirac equations first as an equivalent one that incorporates the interactions through the kernel structures that appear in most older approaches and second as an equivalent form closely related to the breit equation . in this section",
    "we examine how the relativistic interaction structures of the constraint approach lead even for qed to classifications of interaction terms that differ from the designations used in some of the other approaches . in section",
    "vi , we examine an attempt to use the salpeter equation to treat the meson spectrum : the wisconsin model of gara , durand , durand , and nickisch@xcite .",
    "although these authors try to keep relativistic structures , they ultimately employ weak - potential approximations and structures obtained from perturbative qed in a non - perturbative equation ( with no check to see that the procedure even makes nonperturbative sense in qed itself ) . in section vii we examine the iowa state model of sommerer , spence and vary @xcite which uses a new quasipotential approach for which , in contrast to the wisconsin model , the authors check that the equation makes nonperturbative sense  in qed at least for the positronium ground state . in section viii , we examine the breit equation model of brayshaw @xcite , which illustrates the sort of successful fit that one can still obtain when one is allowed to introduce confining interactions ( into the breit equation ) through terms whose relativistic transformation properties are ambiguous . in section ix , we look at the most popular treatment - the semirelativistic model of godfrey and isgur @xcite .",
    "this model includes a different smearing and momentum dependent factor for each part of the various spin - dependent interactions .",
    "although each interaction is introduced for apparently justifiable physical reasons , this approach breaks up ( or spoils ) the full relativistic spin structure that is the two - body counterpart of that of the one - body dirac equation with its _ automatic _ relations among the various interaction terms .",
    "we examine this model to see how well our fully covariant set of two - body dirac equations , employing only three potential parameters used in two different invariant interaction functions , can do versus godfrey s and isgur s semirelativistic equation with relativistic kinematics and pieces of relativistic dynamical corrections ( introduced in a patchwork manner with ten potential parameters used in six different interaction functions ) , when required to fit the whole meson spectrum ( including the light - quark mesons ) .",
    "finally , in section x , we conclude the paper by reviewing some of the features of the constraint approach that played important roles in the relative success of its fit to the meson spectrum .",
    "we then use apparent successes of recent fits produced by the ordinary nonrelativistic quark model to point out dangers inherent in judging rival formalisms on the basis of fits to portions of the spectrum .  at the end of the paper , we supply sets of tables for spectral comparisons and appendices detailing the radial form of our two - body dirac equations that we use for our spectral calculations , and the numerical procedure that we use to construct meson wave functions .",
    "we also include a table summarizing the important features of the various methods that we compare in this paper .",
    "in order to treat a single relativistic spin - one - half particle , dirac originally constructed a quantum wave equation from a first - order wave operator that is the matrix square - root of the corresponding klein - gordon operator @xcite .",
    "our method extends his construction to the system of two interacting relativistic spin - one - half particles with quantum dynamics governed by a pair of compatible dirac equations on a single 16-component wave function . for an extensive review of this approach ,",
    "see refs.@xcite and works cited therein . for the reader unfamiliar with this approach , we present a brief review .",
    "about 27 years ago , the relativistic constraint approach first successfully yielded a covariant yet canonical formulation of the relativistic two - body problem for two interacting spinless classical particles .",
    "it accomplished this by covariantly controlling the troublesome relative time and relative energy , thereby reducing the number of degrees of freedom of the relativistic two - body problem to that of the corresponding nonrelativistic problem@xcite-@xcite . in this method ,",
    "the reduction takes place through the enforcement of a generalized mass shell constraint for each of the two interacting spinless particles : @xmath1 . mathematical consistency",
    "then requires that the two constraints be compatible  in the sense that they be conserved by a covariant system - hamiltonian . upon quantization ,",
    "the quantum version of this compatibility condition  becomes the requirement that the quantum versions of the constraints ( two separate klein - gordon equations on the same wave function for spinless particles ) possess a commutator that vanishes when applied to the wave - function . in 1982 , the authors of this paper used a supersymmetric classical formulation of the single - particle dirac equation due to galvao and teitelboim to successfully extend this construction to the pseudoclassical  mechanics of two spin - one - half particles @xcite . upon quantization",
    ", this scheme produces a consistent relativistic quantum mechanics for a pair of interacting fermions governed by two coupled dirac equations .",
    "when specialized to the case of two relativistic spin - one - half particles interacting through four - vector and scalar potentials , the two compatible 16-component dirac equations @xcite take the form    @xmath2    in terms of @xmath3 operators that in the free - particle limit become operator square roots of the klein - gordon operator .",
    "the relativistic four - vector potentials @xmath4 and scalar potentials @xmath5 are effective constituent potentials that in either limit @xmath6 go over to the ordinary external vector and scalar potentials of the light - particle s one - body dirac equation .",
    "note that the four - vector interactions enter through minimal substitutions  inherited ( along with the accompanying gauge structure ) from the corresponding classical field theory@xcite .",
    "the covariant spin - dependent terms in the constituent vector and scalar potentials ( see eq.([vecp ] and eq.([scalp ] ) below ) are recoil terms whose forms are nonperturbative consequences of the compatibility condition    @xmath7\\psi=0 . \\label{cmpt}\\ ] ]    this condition also requires that the potentials depend on the space - like interparticle separation only through the combination @xmath8 with no dependence on the relative time in the c.m . frame .",
    "this separation variable is orthogonal to the total four - momentum @xmath9 @xmath10 is the time - like unit vector @xmath11 the accompanying relative four - momentum canonically conjugate to @xmath12 is @xmath13 in which @xmath14 is the total c.m .",
    "the @xmath15 s are the invariant c.m .",
    "energies of each of the ( interacting ) particles@xcite .",
    "the wave operators in eqs.([tbdea],[tbdeb ] ) operate on a single 16-component spinor which we decompose as @xmath16{c}\\psi_{1}\\\\ \\psi_{2}\\\\ \\psi_{3}\\\\ \\psi_{4}\\end{array } \\right )   \\label{spinor}\\ ] ] in which the @xmath17 are four - component spinors .",
    "once we have ensured that the compatibility condition is satisfied , eqs.([tbdea],[tbdeb ] ) provide a consistent quantum description of the relativistic two - body system incorporating several important properties @xcite .",
    "they are manifestly covariant .",
    "they reduce to the ordinary one body dirac equation in the limit in which either of the particles becomes infinitely heavy .",
    "they can be combined to give @xcite coupled second - order schrdinger - like equations ( pauli - forms ) for the sixteen component dirac spinors . in the center of momentum ( c.m . )",
    "system , for the vector and scalar interactions of eq.([vecp ] ) and eq.([scalp ] ) below , these equations resemble ordinary schrdinger equations with interactions that include central - potential , darwin , spin - orbit , spin - spin , and tensor terms .",
    "these customary terms are accompanied by others that provide important additional couplings between the upper - upper ( @xmath18 ) and lower - lower ( @xmath19 ) four component spinor portions of the full sixteen component dirac spinor .",
    "the interactions are completely local but depend explicitly on the total energy @xmath14 in the c.m . frame . in this paper",
    "we use a recently developed rearrangement of these equations @xcite ( similar to that first presented in @xcite ) that provides us with ones simpler to solve but physically equivalent  the resulting local schrdinger - like equation depending on the four - component spinor @xmath20 takes the general c.m .",
    "form @xmath21 with no coupling to other four component spinors .  the explicit version of the potential @xmath22 in eq.([clpds ] ) that results from the rearrangement has a structure that produces couplings between the spin components of @xmath23 that are no more complicated than those of  its nonrelativistic counterpart - with the customary spin - spin ,  spin - orbit , non - central tensor or spin - orbit difference terms appearing .",
    "we have checked that both the simpler form eq.([clpds ] )  and the equivalent coupled forms give the same numerical spectral results when tested for qed bound states as in @xcite and when tested for our new qcd spectral results appearing in this paper .",
    "( this provides an important cross check on our numerical calculation of the meson spectra ) .",
    "eq.([clpds ] ) is accompanied by similar equations for @xmath24 and @xmath25 once eq.([clpds ] ) is solved , one can use eq.([tbdea],[tbdeb ] ) to determine @xmath26and @xmath27 . because of the decoupling it is not necessary to determine @xmath28 and @xmath27 to solve the eigenvalue equation ( [ clpds ] ) .  however , the detailed form of @xmath22 for @xmath29 results from their elimination through the pauli reduction procedure . in these equations ,",
    "the usual invariant @xmath30 plays the role of energy eigenvalue .",
    "this invariant is the c.m .",
    "value of the square of the relative momentum expressed as a function of the invariant total c.m .",
    ".    note that in the limit in which one of the particles becomes very heavy , this schrdinger - like equation turns into the one obtained by eliminating the lower component of the ordinary one - body dirac equation in terms of the other component .    the vector potentials appearing in eqs.([tbdea],[tbdeb ] )",
    "depend on three invariant functions @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 that define time - like vector interactions ( proportional to @xmath10 ) and space - like vector interactions ( orthogonal to @xmath10 , with @xmath34 ) @xcite @xmath35 while the scalar potentials @xmath5 depend on @xmath33 and two additional invariant functions @xmath36 and @xmath37 @xmath38 note that the terms in [ vecp ] and [ scalp ] which are explicitly spin - dependent through the gamma matrices are essential in order to satisfy the compatibility condition [ cmpt ] . later on , when the equation is reduced to second - order pauli - form , yet other spin dependences eventually arise from gamma matrix terms ( that , when squared , lose their gamma matrix dependence ) .",
    "these are typical of what occurs in the reduction of the one - body dirac equation to the pauli form .",
    "the gamma matrices also give rise to spin independent terms in the pauli - forms .",
    "these terms emerge in a manner similar to the above two sources of spin dependent terms in the pauli - form of the equations .    in the case",

    "the deceptively simple form of eq.([mnml ] ) in fact incorporates retarded and advanced effects through its dependnce on the c.m . energy @xmath14 . on the other hand , recently jallouli and sazdjian @xcite obtained eqs.([tvecp1 ] ) and ( [ mp ] ) in quantum field theory after performing a necessarily laborious eikonal summation to all orders of ladder and cross ladder diagrams together with all constraint diagrams ( lippmann - schwinger like iterations of the simple born diagram)@xcite .",

    "thus , in this model , if the confining part of the potential is a world scalar , then in the large @xmath43 limit the remaining portion , regarded as an electromagnetic - like interaction corresponding to our invariant function @xmath42 , would be an attractive @xmath128 potential with a coupling constant on the order of 1 .",
    "this is in reasonable agreement with the adler model which also has an attractive @xmath128 part .",
    "support for the assumption that the @xmath129 term belongs only to @xmath73 also arises from phenomenological considerations .",
    "we find that attempts to assign the @xmath129 term to the scalar potential have a drastic effect on the spin - spin and spin - orbit splittings .",
    "in fact , using this term in @xmath72 through eqs.([mp ] ) generates spin - spin and spin - orbit splittings that are much too small .    in our previous work",
    ", we divided the confining part equally between scalar and time - like vector so that the spin - orbit multiplets would not be inverted .",
    "this was done in order to obtain from our model the @xmath130 meson which was then considered as the prime candidate for the relativistic counterpart of the @xmath131 meson .",
    "however , recent analysis indicates that that meson may be instead a meson - meson or four quark bound state ( see however , @xcite , which even interprets the @xmath130 meson as part of a new scalar ( @xmath132 ) meson @xmath133 multiplet outside of the usual quark model ) while a meson with mass of 1450 mev may be the correct candidate for the quark model state @xcite .",
    "interpretation of this other state as the @xmath131 meson would in fact require a partial inversion of the spin - orbit triplet ( from what one would expect based on the positronium analog ) .",
    "this partial inversion is consistent with the @xmath131 candidate for the @xmath134 system also appearing in a position that partially inverts the spin - orbit splitting .",
    "since the sole purpose of including @xmath113 in our previous treatment was to prevent the inversion , we exclude it from our present treatment . in our older treatment @xcite",

    "the corrected decoupling ( appearing in eq.([sch ] ) ) is included in the new meson calculations appearing in this paper .    in the present investigation , we compute the best fit meson spectrum for the following apportionment of the adler - piran potential :    @xmath136+\\frac{c_{4}}{r}+\\frac{e_{1}e_{2}}{r},\\ \\",

    ", the exponential factor gradually turns off the electromagnetic - like contribution to the potential at long distance except for the @xmath128 portion mentioned above , while the scalar portion gradually turns on , becoming fully responsible for the linear confining and subdominant terms at long distance .",

    "are dominated by the scalar interaction , while at short distances ( @xmath154 the electromagnetic - like portion of the interaction gives the dominant contribution to the fine structure .",
    "furthermore because the signs of each of the spin - orbit and darwin terms in the pauli - form of our dirac equations are opposite for the scalar and vector interactions , the spin - orbit contributions of those parts of the interaction produce opposite effects with degrees of cancellation depending on the size of the quarkonium atom .",
    "we obtain the meson masses given in column three as the result of a least squares fit using the known experimental errors , an assumed calculational error of 1.0 mev , and an independent error conservatively taken to be 5% of the total width of the meson .",
    "we employ the calculational error not to represent the uncertainty of our algorithm but instead to prevent the mesons that are stable with respect to the strong interaction from being weighted too heavily .",

    "the numbers given in parentheses to the right of the predicted meson masses are the contribution of that meson s calculation to the total @xmath155 of 101 .",
    "the 17 mesons that contain a @xmath160 ( or @xmath161 ) quark contribute a total of about 5.4 to the @xmath155 , at an average of about 0.3 each .",
    "this is the lowest contribution of those given by any family .",
    "since the adler - piran potential was originally derived for static quarks , one should not be surprised to find that most of the best fit mesons are members of the least relativistic of the meson families .",
    "note , however , that five of the best fit mesons of this type contain highly relativistic @xmath162 and @xmath163 quarks ( for which our equation reduces essentially to the one - body dirac equation for the light quark ) .",
    "the 24 mesons that contain a @xmath164 ( or @xmath165 ) quark contribute a total of about 50.7 to the @xmath155 at an average of about 2.2 each .",
    "this is the highest contribution of those given by any family .",
    "a significant part of this contribution is due to the @xmath166 meson mass being about 32 mev off its experimental value .",
    "another part of the contribution is due to fact that the mass of the high orbital excitation of the @xmath167 tensor meson is 80 mev below its experimental value .",
    "in addition , the high orbital excitation of the @xmath168 is 60 mev low .",
    "the 24 mesons that contain an @xmath163 ( or @xmath169 ) quark contribute a total of about 46.3 to the @xmath155 at an average of about 1.3 each , less than that for the @xmath164-quark mesons .",
    "this is important because the @xmath163 quarks are lighter than the @xmath164 quarks .",
    "part of the reason for this unexpected effect is that our @xmath155 fitting procedure accounts for the fact that our meson model ignores the level shifts ( due to the instability of many of the mesons that contain an @xmath163 quark ) through the introduction of a theoretical error on the order of 5% of the width of the unstable mesons .",
    "the 36 mesons that contain a @xmath162 ( or @xmath170 ) quark contribute a total of about 54.6 to the @xmath155 at an average of about 1.5 each while the 16 mesons on our list that contain a @xmath171 ( or @xmath172 ) quark contribute a total of about 18.6 to the @xmath155 at an average of about 1.2 each .",
    "the worst fits produced by our model are those to the @xmath166 and the @xmath173 and @xmath174 high orbital excitations .",
    "although two of these mesons contain the light @xmath162 and @xmath171 quarks , in our fit the more relativistic bound states are not in general fit less well .",
    "in fact , the @xmath175 and @xmath176 mesons are fit better than these two excited @xmath173 and @xmath174 mesons .",
    "we see that over all , the two - body dirac equations together with the relativistic version of the adler - piran potential account very well for the meson spectrum over the entire range of relativistic motions , using just the two parametric functions @xmath73 and @xmath72 .",
    "we now examine another important feature of our method : the goodness with which our equations account for spin - dependent effects ( both fine- and hyperfine- splittings ) .",
    "table i shows that the best fit versus experimental , ground state singlet - triplet splittings for the @xmath177 systems are 48 vs 46 , 59 vs 47 , 151 vs 117 , 134 vs 142 , 132 vs 142 , 147 vs 144 , 418 vs 398 , 418 vs 398 , and finally 648 vs 627 mev .",
    "we obtain a uniformly good fit for all hyperfine ground state splittings except for the @xmath178 system .",
    "the problem with the fit for that system of mesons occurs because the @xmath179 and @xmath180 states are significantly low while the @xmath166 is significantly high .",
    "furthermore , the singlet and triplet @xmath181 states are uniformly low .",
    "an attempt to lower the @xmath164 quark mass by correcting the @xmath166 mass while raising the charmonium and @xmath182 state masses would require raising the @xmath164 quark mass .",
    "reducing one discrepancy would worsen the other .",
    "below , we will uncover what we believe is the primary cause for this discrepancy as we examine other aspects of the spectrum .",
    "for the spin - orbit splittings we obtain values for the @xmath183 ratios @xmath184 of 0.71,0.67,0.42,-0.19,-0.58,-3.35 for the two @xmath185 triplets , and the @xmath186 spin triplets compared to the experimental ratios of 0.66,0.61,0.48,0.09,-0.97,-0.4 .",
    "this fit ranges from very good in the case of the light @xmath187 multiplet to miserably bad for the two lightest multiplets . from the experimental point of view",
    "some of the problem may be blamed on the uncertain status of the @xmath131 light quark meson bound states and the spin - mixing in the case of the @xmath188 multiplet . from the theoretical point of view",
    ", the lack of any mechanism in our model to account for the effects of decay rates on level shifts undoubtedly has an effect .",
    "another likely cause is that as we proceed from the heavy mesons to the light ones , the radial size of the meson grows so that the long distance interactions , in which the scalar interaction becomes dominant , play a more important role .",
    "the spin - orbit terms due to scalar interactions are opposite in sign to and tend ( at long distance ) to dominate the spin - orbit terms due to vector interactions .",
    "this results in partial to full multiplet inversions as we proceed from the @xmath189 to the @xmath190 mesons .",
    "this inversion mechanism may also be responsible for the problems of the two orbitally excited @xmath167 and @xmath168 mesons described above .",
    "it may be responsible as well for the problem of the singlet and triplet @xmath181 states since the scalar interaction tends to offset the dominant shorter range vector interaction , at least slightly .",
    "we also examine the effect of the hyperfine structure of our equations on the splitting between the @xmath191 and weighted sum @xmath192/9 $ ] of bound states .",
    "we obtain pairs of values equal to 3.520,3.520;1.408,1.432 ; 1.392,1416 for the @xmath193 families versus the experimental pairs of 3.526,3.525;1.402,1.375;1.231,1.303 .",
    "the agreement of the theoretical and experimental mass differences is excellent for the @xmath166 system , slightly too large and of the wrong sign for the @xmath194 system and too small and of the wrong sign for the @xmath190 system .",
    "part of the cause of this pattern is that pure scalar confinement worsens the fit for the light mesons because of its tendency to reverse the spin - orbit splitting , thereby shifting the center of gravity .",
    "the agreement , however , for the light systems is nevertheless considerably better than that in the case of the fine structure splitting @xmath183 ratios .",
    "another part of the discrepancy may be due to the uncertain status of the light @xmath131 meson as well as the spin - mixing in the case of the @xmath188 multiplet .",
    "note that in the case of unequal mass @xmath181 states , our calculations of the two values incorporate the effects of the @xmath195 spin - mixing effects .",
    "( the use of nonrelativistic notation is only for convenience . )",
    "these differences between heavy and light meson systems also occur in the mixing due to the tensor term between radial @xmath72 and orbital @xmath196 excitations of the spin - triplet ground states .",
    "this mixing occurs most notably in the @xmath197 and @xmath190 systems .",
    "the three pairs of values that we obtain are 3.808,3.688;1.985,1.800;1.986,1.775 respectively versus the data 3.770,3.686;1.714,1.412;1.700;1.450 .",
    "our results are quite reasonable for the charmonium system but underestimate considerably the splitting for the light quark systems . as happened for the significant disagreement in the case of the fine structure ,",
    "our results here worsen significantly for the light meson systems .",
    "the spectroscopy of the lighter mesons is undoubtedly more complex due to their extreme instability ( not accounted for in our approach ) .",
    "note , however , that for the spin - spin hyperfine splittings of the ground states the more relativistic ( lighter quark ) systems yield masses that agree at least as well with the experimental data as do the heavier systems .",
    "this same mixed behavior shows up again for the radial excitations .",
    "the incremental @xmath155 contributions for the six @xmath198 states of the @xmath187 system is just 1.8 .",
    "it is 12.9 over three states for the triplet charmonium system ( primarily due to the @xmath166 deviation ) , 3.0 for the two @xmath199 states , 1.6 for the three @xmath132 states of the @xmath194 system ( note , however that these fits include expected errors due to the lack of level shift mechanisms and are thus reduced ) , 7.3 for the two @xmath198 states of for the @xmath188 system , 2.2 for the three triplet @xmath190 states and 8.2 for the three singlet @xmath190 states .",
    "the @xmath155 contribution at first increases , then decreases with the lighter systems .",
    "overall , the masses are much too large for the radially excited light quark mesons .",
    "these discrepancies may be due both to neglect of decay - induced level shifts and to the increased confining force for large @xmath43 from linear to quadratic ( there is no term to compensate for the quadratic @xmath151 term ) .",
    "the isospin splitting that we obtain for the spin singlet @xmath200 meson system is 1 mev .",
    "our calculation includes the contribution from the @xmath135 mass difference of 3.3 mev as well as that due to different charge states .",
    "the effect of the latter tends to offset the effects of the former since the @xmath160 and @xmath170 have the same sign of the charge while the @xmath160 and @xmath172 have the opposite while @xmath201 . in the experimental data",
    "this offset is complete ( 0 ) . in the case of the @xmath202 splitting our mass difference of 7",
    "mev represents the combined effects of the @xmath135 mass difference and the slightly increased electromagnetic binding present in the case of the @xmath203 and the slightly decreased binding in the case of the @xmath204 .",
    "the experimental mass difference is just 4 mev .",
    "these effects work in the same way for the spin - triplet splitting resulting in the theoretical value 5 mev compared with the experimental value 3 mev . for the @xmath205 isodoublet we obtain 4 mev versus about 0 for the experimental values . our isospin splittings are enhanced because of the large @xmath135 quark mass difference that gives the best overall fit . for the @xmath206 family the experimental value for the isospin splitting is @xmath207mev for the singlet and triplet ground states .",
    "this splitting actually grows for the orbital excitation ( @xmath208 ) to 7 mev .",
    "the probable reason for this increase is that at the larger distances , the weak influence of the coulomb differences becomes small while only the actual @xmath135 mass difference influences the result ( although it does seem rather large ) .",
    "it is difficult to understand why our results stay virtually zero for all three isodoublets .",
    "note that as with the @xmath200 doublets , the theoretical contributions of the combined effects of the @xmath135 mass differences and the electrostatic effects tend to cancel .",
    "however , the experimental masses do not show this expected cancellation .",
    "recently , the babar collaboration @xcite found evidence for a new @xmath210 strange - charmed meson at 2.32 gev .",
    "using the parameters above and assuming the state is a @xmath131 @xmath211 meson we find a predicted mass of 2.35 gev , about 130 mev below our predicted value for the @xmath205 counterpart .",
    "the corresponding mass difference in the godfrey - isgur model is 2.590 - 2.480 = 110 mev .  both are well off the experimental mark of 2.572 - 2.317=255 mev .",
    "it is not surprising that its place in the quark model has been the subject of some debate .",
    "overall comparison with the experimental data shows that the primary strength of our approach is that it provides very good estimates for the ground states for all families of mesons and for the radial excitation and fine structure splittings for the heavier mesons . on the other hand , it overestimates the radial and orbital excitations for the light mesons .",
    "its worst results are those for the fine structure splittings for the @xmath212 and @xmath190 mesons .",
    "both weaknesses are probably due to long distance scalar potential effects .",

    "note , however , that the shape of our pion curve is not what one would expect  from the goldberger - trieman relation@xmath234    [ ptb ]    f50.ps    thus this aspect of our model requires further investigation .",

    "we make no such weak potential assumption  and therefore must deal directly with the fact that our dirac equations themselves relate components of the sixteen component wave function to each another .",

    "moreover , even a casual glance at the results shows one glaring discrepancy that results from their approach - their hyperfine splittings for the light quark mesons .",
    "the cause of this is probably the fact that their reduced salpeter approach does not include coupling of the upper - upper piece to the other 12 components of the 16 component wave function .",
    "in fact , the lighter the meson , the worse is their result . in our qed numerical investigations we found that couplings to the other components of the wave function were essential in order to obtain agreement with the standard perturbative spectral results of qed .",

    "several features separate the two approaches .  first , as we found in @xcite the qed results provided by our equation agree with those of standard perturbative qed for more than just the ground state while it is unknown if the parameters that the iowa state model uses that ensured its fit to the singlet ground state of positronium would work for the other states .",
    "second the constraint approach generates similar structures for scalar interactions and systems of vector and scalar interactions with agreement with the corresponding perturbative field - theoretic results while again it is unknown whether the parameters that the iowa state model uses that gave good fits to the singlet ground state of positronium would work in the presence of other potentials .",
    "third , the match to singlet positronium that we obtained was an analytic consequence of our equations for qed and therefore a test of those equations @xcite , not the result of a numerical fit .",
    "fourth , our approach includes essential contributions from all sixteen components of the relativistic wave function , not just the positive energy  components @xcite .",
    "fifth , an important consequence of the fully relativistic dynamics and gauge - theoretic structure of the constraint equations is that they produce values of the light quark masses closer to current  algebra values than do alternative approaches .",
    "the quark masses that we obtained in our comparison fit with the iowa state model are @xmath293 mev and @xmath294 mev which are significantly closer to the current  algebra  values of @xmath295 mev and @xmath296mev than the iowa state model s values of 405 and 346 mev respectively .",
    "brayshaw @xcitetreats quarkonium with the aid of the breit equation and an interaction hamiltonian with five distinct parts , four of which are independent . as usually done for the breit equation the times associated with each particle are identified or related in some favored frame ( normally c.m . ) selected so that the relative time does not enter the potential . in that frame brayshaw uses the equation @xmath297 in which @xmath298 is the free breit hamiltonian @xmath299 while @xmath300 and @xmath301 are a coulomb and an associated breit interaction @xmath302 as indicated in our discussion about the salpeter equation in section(vi ) , this part of the interaction comes from the vector portion of the kernel .",
    "the author acknowledges the difficulties associated with the breit interaction , pointing out that the radial equation has a singularity at a radial separation of @xmath303 .",
    "he bypasses breit s proposal that this interaction be used only in first order perturbation theory by using only positive energy spinors in his variational procedures .",
    "we point out that this was not necessary in our approach since the hyperbolic structure of our eight basic interactions avoids problems inherent in breit s formulation @xcite .",
    "in particular , it avoids appearance of midpoint singularities .",
    "unfortunately , just like the wisconsin group , having avoided the pitfalls of the breit equation , he uses his replacement without testing whether or not his formalism would yield the standard qed results numerically if he limited his interaction to the usual coulomb interaction .",
    "once again such a test would ( if successful ) help eliminate the possibility that the wave equation introduces spurious physics .    in eq.([bry ] ) , @xmath304 is a long range confining portion which incorporates the requirement that the wave function vanish identically for radial separations @xmath305 with a boundary condition at @xmath306 .",
    "brayshaw argues for this term over and above a linear confinement piece on the grounds that at some separation @xmath307 corresponding to a threshold energy @xmath308 , production of @xmath133 pairs should become energetically favorable .",
    "his radial parameter @xmath221 plays the role of @xmath307 in specifying the range at which such effects ( among others ) dominate confinement .",
    "he expects that @xmath221 is on the order of @xmath309 for the light quark mesons while wave functions for the heavy quark mesons would have fallen to zero for @xmath310 .",
    "when introducing the explicit form of his linear confinement potential , the author finds that it can not simply be added as a lorentz scalar to the hamiltonian since such a term produces far too large a mass shift for the light quark systems .",
    "instead he chooses @xmath311 which he shows contributes very weakly for the light quark systems , while contributing significantly for the heavy quark systems with an intermediate contribution for the hydrogen - like intermediate mass mesons .",
    "unfortunately , however , we note the important fact that the lorentz transformation character of this confining interaction is ambiguous , being neither scalar ( @xmath312 ) nor ( time - like ) vector ( @xmath313 ) .",
    "finally brayshaw introduces a special short range attractive piece solely in order to obtain a good fit to the pion and kaon . instead of a spin - dependent contact term used in a number of semirelativistic approaches",
    "@xcite he uses @xmath314 this term resembles a cross term between a linear confinement piece and the breit term that might emerge from some sort of iteration .",
    "the short range character of this part - scalar , part - vector interaction is specified through taking @xmath315 .",
    "in contrast , our approach possesses a short range spin - spin interaction that is quantum mechanically well defined and which arises straightforwardly from the schrdinger reduction of our dirac equations .",
    "we do not need to add it in by hand .      in spite of its ad hoc nature",
    ", we have included the procedure of brayshaw among our comparisons because it turns out that his resultant fit for the 56 mesons ( that overlap with our fit ) is quite good , just slightly worse than our fit . in table",
    "iv we include in the fourth column the fit we would obtain with our model if we included only the 56 mesons that our fit has in common with brayshaw s . on a meson by meson basis we compare by using incremental @xmath155 values .    of the 56 mesons in the table , our fits are closer to data in only 26 , although overall our fit is better",

    "the fits of both models are of about the same quality .",
    "note that excited pion predictions bracket the experimental results .",
    "this appears to be a common feature of the radial and orbital excitations of the light quark mesons , with his results on average closer to the experimental values .",
    "our results are , on average , better for the heavier mesons .",
    "however , his apparently good fit emerges from a potential structure that has ambiguous lorentz transformation properties .",
    "the potentials are chosen in a patchwork manner using the 5 parameters @xmath320(he sets @xmath321 ) . in terms of lorentz transformation properties",
    "his scheme uses four invariant functions ( scalar , time - like , electromagnetic like and mixed ( @xmath322 and @xmath323 ) ) .",
    "the adler - piran potential that we use has only two invariant functions corresponding to scalar and electromagnetic like interactions .",
    "the constraint approach is not a patchwork ; instead its wave equation itself ( once @xmath73 and @xmath72 are chosen ) fixes the spin , orbital and radial aspects of its potential and its spectra .",
    "we also note that just as in the case of the wisconsin model , brayshaw has not tested the nonperturbative reliability of his equation . on the other hand an important result of his approach",
    "is that the @xmath324 quark masses required for his fit are very small ( 10 mev ) and significantly closer to the current quark mass values than ours .",
    "his strange quark mass ( 200 mev ) is also closer to the proposed current quark mass values than our value .",
    "the most important warning provided by brayshaw s approach is that an ad hoc structure with ambiguous lorentz properties can do so well at fitting the spectrum .",
    "we begin with a general discussion of semirelativistic quark models ( with and without full relativistic kinematics ) .",
    "we term a semirelativistic quark model  one that uses a two - body wave equation that takes one of the following three forms in the c.m .",
    "frame : @xmath325 in each of these equations @xmath326 is the square of the c.m .",
    "relative momentum while @xmath327 is an effective potential which includes central , spin - orbit , spin - spin , tensor and possibly darwin terms . in each",
    ", the wave function has four components with no coupling to lower - lower components .",
    "the most important difference between the first form and the others is that the latter two have exact relativistic kinematics .",
    "the former is almost always called a nonrelativistic quark model although strictly speaking almost all spin dependences ( at least those that arise from vector and scalar interactions ) vanish in the nonrelativistic limit .",
    "these equations differ from the two - body dirac equations and the breit and instantaneous bethe - salpeter approaches primarily in that their spin - dependences are put in by hand , abstracted from the fermi - breit reductions of the breit and instantaneous bethe - salpeter approaches . for coulomb - like",
    "potentials originating in the coulomb gauge , these terms contain singular potentials .",
    "consequently they must either be treated purely perturbatively ( thus ruling out application to the light quark mesons ) or through the introduction of smoothing parameters that may or may not be features of the actual potential .",
    "the two - body dirac equations of constraint dynamics , like their one - body cousin , have a natural smoothing mechanism - potential dependent denominators in the spin - dependent and darwin terms of the resultant schrodinger - like form - that eliminates the necessity for ad hoc introduction of such terms .",
    "the breit equation may also possess a natural smoothing mechanism , but a nonperturbative treatment of it leads to erroneous results in qed @xcite .",
    "the instantaneous salpeter equation may have a natural smoothing mechanism , but has not been tested nonperturbatively for qed even though the equation is over 50 years old .",
    "authors who have attempted to use these types of semi - relativistic equations to treat the entire meson spectrum include lichtenberg @xcite(the third type ) , stanley and robson @xcite and godfrey and isgur @xcite ( the second type ) , and morpurgo , ono , and schberl @xcite(the first type ) .",
    "each of these authors ignore the spin - independent part of the fermi - breit interaction .",
    "this neglect is not justifiable since this part of the interaction will have an effect on @xmath72 states that is significantly different from its effect on non @xmath72-states , being normally short ranged compared with the rest of the central force part of the problem . in this paper",
    ", we select one of these models for our final comparison , the model of godfrey and isgur , since this model , even though already 18 years old ,  is by far the most often cited in recent experimental works and theoretical papers on rival approaches .",
    "as we have said , godfrey and isgur assume a semi - relativistic wave equation of the second type possessing exact relativistic kinematics but through the inconvenient sum - of - square - roots form .",
    "they then determine the form of interaction in the following way .",
    "they assume that the confining piece of the interaction is a world scalar .",
    "they modify the coulomb potential with the aid of a smoothing function . at the same time",
    "they appear to ignore the darwin term ( e.g. the spin independent contact term present in the one - body limit ) in the on - shell reduction of the @xmath133 scattering amplitude .",
    "although they modify the short range part of their interaction with the aid of a smearing function , this modification does not compensate for the ignored darwin term .",
    "we have shown elsewhere @xcite , @xcite that the darwin interactions for scalar and vector interactions lead , through a canonical transformation to the quadratic local terms @xmath151 and @xmath328 that appear in our equations .  since the authors have ignored this part of the darwin interactions their results contain none of the dynamical consequences of the @xmath151 or @xmath329 pieces .",
    "what portion of the darwin term they include they parametrize separately just as they do the other portions of the fermi - breit interaction .",
    "these terms include the spin - spin contact term , the spin - orbit terms , and the tensor terms . in our opinion , this patchwork way of handling the physics blurs the relativistic significance of their quark model . in our two - body dirac equations",
    "the darwin portion and each of the spin - dependent portions is tied directly to and fixed by the lorentz forms @xmath330 of the interaction which are in turn set by the @xmath331 invariant potentials . in qed these fixed terms yield the correct spectrum with no additional parameters needed to adjust their relative sizes .",
    "in addition to bypassing the problems of singular spin - dependent terms by assuming a smoothing parameter , godfrey and isgur include nonlocal ( momentum - dependent ) potentials by replacing the mass dependent @xmath332 in the fermi - breit term by @xmath333 .",
    "they claim that this is necessary because the fermi - breit reduction ( or the on - shell @xmath133 scattering amplitude in c.m . )",
    "does not adequately express the full momentum dependence ( or nonlocal nature ) of the potential .",
    "while this might be true , we have found that such nonlocal behavior is not necessary to obtain very good results either in lowest order qed or in the quark model .    like the adler - piran potential that we use in our approach ,",
    "their potential includes a running coupling constant .",
    "in fact , by convolving a parametric gaussian fit to the running coupling constant with the @xmath334 , they obtain their desired smoothing of the coulomb potential , thus killing two birds with one stone .",
    "in addition , they are able to treat the zero isospin mesons like the @xmath335 and @xmath336 by including a phenomenological annihilation term .",
    "we leave out this term in our results of table i - iv and in our comparison with the results of godfrey and isgur in table v. lichtenberg @xcite has compared an earlier version of our quark model for the meson spectrum with that of godfrey and isgur .",
    "the potential we used in that earlier version was the one - parameter richardson potential , with the confinement piece chosen to be one - half time - like vector and one - half scalar .",
    "as lichtenberg pointed out , godfrey and isgur obtained significantly better agreement with the data than we did .",
    "he states that this is because they use significantly more parameters than we do including four in the potential and six to describe relativistic effects , ten altogether , compared to our one .",
    "however , we do not believe that as a general rule the number of parameters that appear in the potential is , in itself , of as much significance as how these parameters are distributed .",
    "for example , in our present and previous models there are two invariant functions , @xmath73 and @xmath72 related to the single nonrelativistic ( adler - piran ) @xmath337 that itself depends on two parameters .",
    "these parametric functions are not entirely independent , being related by eqs.([asap],[apa],[aps ] ) .",
    "specifying their form fixes both spin - independent and spin - dependent parts of the quasipotential @xmath338 .",
    "we might say that our formalism has 5 quark mass parameters and two parametric functions . increasing the number of parameters that @xmath339 depend on may or may not increase the goodness of the fit . according to our way of counting , godfrey and isgur have independent parametric functions for the two spin - orbit parts of the potential , the spin - spin contact part , the tensor part , the scalar potential , and the spin - independent part of the vector potential , altogether 6 parametric functions . from our way of counting the number of parameters",
    "the number of parametric functions would not increase no matter how many parameters are included in fixing the functional form of each of these six functions . likewise , in our case , no matter how many parameters we use in fixing @xmath339 there are only two independent parametric functions .",
    "our approach is distinct from that of godfrey and isgur in that we do not alter the functional form at the level of the spin - dependence but rather at the level of the kernels .    finally ,",
    "before we compare our present work with that of godfrey and isgur , we note that our present model differs from our earlier one used by lichtenberg in his comparison of the two approaches .",
    "our present treatment differs in its replacement of the richardson potential by the adler - piran potential .",
    "the intermediate range form of the a - p potential is closely tied to an effective field theory related to qcd and is therefore superior to richardson s ansatz .",
    "furthermore , in calculations based on our earlier treatment we ignored the tensor coupling and unequal mass spin - orbit difference couplings which we explicitly include in the present calculations .",
    "we have also corrected a defect in the decoupling we used between the upper - upper and lower - lower components of the wave functions for spin - triplet states in our older treatment .",
    "we now compare the fit given by our model to that provided by the model of godfrey and isgur .    in table",
    "v  we display in the fourth column the fit we would obtain with our model if we included only the 77 mesons that our fit has in common with that of godfrey and isgur .",
    "we then compare the fits by examining the incremental @xmath155 values for each meson .",
    "( in an rms comparison they would obtain about 63 compared to our value of 79 ) .",
    "for the 77 mesons in their table , our fits are closer to data in only 32 ; overall their fit is better . generally speaking our results",
    "are better on the newer mesons while their fit is better on the older mesons .",
    "a detailed comparison reveals the following .",
    "their @xmath183 values for the two upsilon , the one charmonium , the @xmath188 , @xmath199 and @xmath316 triplet @xmath181 multiplets are 0.29,0.50,0.57,0.36,0.42,0.47 and are distinctly different from our values of 0.68,0.76,0.41,-0.66,-0.21,-4.00 and the experimental numbers of 0.66,0.61,0.48,0.09,-0.97,-0.4 .",
    "as was true for the brayshaw analysis , the constraint / adler - piran combination gives a distinctly better fit than the isgur - wise approach for the heavier mesons , while both give poor results for the lighter mesons . as was the case for brayshaw s spectrum ,",
    "none of their light multiplets are inverted , whereas although ours are inverted they are not inverted in the same way as the experimental numbers are .",
    "again , our inversions are due to the action of the scalar potential .",
    "godfrey and isgur include a time - like contribution in the spin - orbit part of their hamiltonian",
    ". this may be responsible for their lack of the partial inversion that appears in the data .",
    "computing their @xmath276 averages @xmath192/9 $ ] along with the @xmath191 mesons for the charmonium , @xmath188 and @xmath340 system we find the following three pairs of numbers : 3.524,3.520;1.392,1.340;1.262,1.220 .",
    "comparison with our numbers of 3.519,3.520;1.424,1.411;1.419,1.397 and the experimental numbers of 3.526,3.525;1.402,1.375;1.231,1.303 shows the constraint approach giving slightly better numbers for the heavier mesons and the @xmath188 while the godfrey - isgur results are somewhat better for the lighter mesons .",
    "their @xmath341 average @xmath342/15 $ ] and their @xmath343 meson for the @xmath188 are 1.795,1.780 mev while our results and the experimental results are 1.873,1.879 and 1.774,1.773 mev respectively .",
    "our results are relatively closer to one another while theirs are closer to the data in an absolute sense .",
    "this is indicative of the general trend of our orbitally excited light mesons being somewhat high .",
    "we suspect that this is due to the @xmath151 behavior becoming dominant at longer distance , changing the behavior of the confining potential in the effective schrdinger - like equation from linear to quadratic .",
    "their values of the hyperfine splittings are 130,60,160,150,430,130,620,150,120 mev for the two charmonium multiplets , and the @xmath344 two @xmath345 and three @xmath265 pairs .",
    "comparison with the experimental splittings of 117,92,142,144,398,-48,627,165,354 mev and our results of 150,78,133,145,403,208,645,239,166 mev demonstrates that while our results are closer than theirs for most of the newer mesons and the @xmath206 , their results are more in line for most of the older mesons .",
    "again this shows a pattern of our method overestimating the radially excited states of the light mesons .",
    "let us see if this trend of overestimation by the constraint approach continues for the radial excitations of fixed quantum numbers .",
    "the six upsilon states in the data portion of the table occur at intervals of 563,332,225,285,154 mev while the three charmonium triplet states and the two charmonium singlet states occur at intervals of 589,354,614 mev whereas the three singlet @xmath194 and the two triplet @xmath188 states occur at intervals of 977,370 and 520 mev .",
    "finally the three pion and three rho excitations occur at 1160,495 and 698,654 mev .",
    "the corresponding isgur - wise intervals are 540,350,280,250,220,580,420,650,980 , 570,680,1150,580,680,550 mev compared to our intervals of 570,336,256,213,186,561,393,633,1099,495,894,1383,634,986,561 mev .",
    "again we encounter a pattern of our results being more accurate overall for the newer mesons while theirs are more accurate for the older ones ( with our results too large for all of the older ones ) .",
    "primarily what we learn from this comparison is that not only does the scalar interaction lead to partial triplet inversions for the lighter mesons but also yields radial and orbital excitations that are too high for a related reason : the presence of the @xmath151 term in the effective potential . on the other hand , as godfrey and",
    "isgur themselves point out , their treatment of the relativistic effects is schematic , with no wave equation involved , allowing an uncontrolled approach in which there are no tightly fixed connections among the various spin - dependent and spin - independent parts of the effective potential @xmath22 .",
    "an important feature of our approach that differs significantly from the model of godfrey and isgur  ( as well as those of the wisconsin and iowa state groups ) is the size of its resulting light quark masses .",
    "our @xmath324 quark masses are about a factor of  four or five smaller than theirs , significantly closer to the current algebra values .",
    "godfrey and isgur argue that since a constituent quark model requires dressed quarks of a finite size ( to avoid singular potentials in their wave equation among other reasons ) one should not expect the model quarks to have current - quark masses .",
    "we argue that a properly structured relativistic wave equation should not require finite quark sizes .",
    "similar remarks have been made historically to justify tampering with the wave equation in qed to avoid treating singular terms .",
    "however , in qed  those terms are perturbative artifacts .",
    "in fact , in the constraint equations for qed , they arise from premature weak - potential approximation to terms that are actually well - behaved at the origin .",
    "similarly , when we apply the constraint approach to qcd we need no size parameters .",
    "finally we mention what we consider the major theoretical shortcoming in the approach of godfrey and isgur .",
    "the formalism that they use gives very good results on the hyperfine splittings for light and heavy mesons .",
    "however , it is unknown if this is an artifact of their smearing factors and the introduction of relativistic momentum dependent corrections to the potentials ( that is , through the replacement of quark masses @xmath346 by @xmath347 ) needed to modify the singular nature of the potentials that they start with .",
    "it would be of interest to test the wave equation used by godfrey and isgur numerically with @xmath277 and @xmath92 for positronium to see if any of their successes with mesonic hyperfine splittings are reflections of corresponding nonperturbative successes in qed .",
    "if their method were not able to obtain an acceptable fit to the qed spectral results through order @xmath94 , then the legitimacy of its fits in qcd would be seriously called into question . without such tests one could not be sure whether the method they employ to avoid the singular potentials has distorted the dynamics .",
    "the constraint approach has passed this test in that without introducing additional parameters it does faithfully reproduce the correct spectral results in qed .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated how well the relativistic constraint approach performs in comparison with selected alternatives when used to produce a single fit of experimental results over the whole meson spectrum .",
    "this approach is distinguished from others by its foundation - a set of coupled , compatible , fully covariant wave equations whose nonperturbative numerical solution yields the mass spectrum along with wave functions for the @xmath133 meson bound states .",
    "its virtue - generation of fully covariant spin structures - also serves to restrict and relate plausible interaction terms just as the ordinary single - particle dirac equation determines relations among pauli spin dependences and fixes the proper strength of the thomas precession term in electrodynamics .",
    "the dynamical structures of the constraint approach were originally discovered in classical relativistic mechanics but have since been verified for electrodynamics through diagrammatic summation in quantum field theory in the field - theoretic eikonal approximation @xcite .    to use such relativistic equations to treat the phenomenological chromodynamic @xmath133 bound - state , one must construct a relativistic interaction that possesses the limiting behaviors of qcd . in our approach",
    "we have done this by using the nonrelativistic static adler - piran potential to construct a plausible relativistic interaction that regenerates the ap potential as its nonrelativistic limit . in our equations , this process generates a host of accompanying interaction terms . when describing these interactions , one must guard against a semantic difficulty in the verbal classification of the various parts of the interaction as scalar , vector , pseudovector  etc .",
    "the various formalisms classify these in different ways but in our equations , the meaning of these terms can be readily determined through examining their roles in the defining equation eq.([tbdes],[cnhyp],[cnmyp],[del ] ) .",
    "once these terms have been introduced , the constraint formalism automatically produces a system of important accompanying terms like quadratic terms that dominate at long distance ( reinforcing or undermining confinement ) or spin dependences that accompany chosen interactions producing level splits that agree or disagree with the experimental results in various parts of the spectrum .",
    "after identification of the relativistic transformation properties of interaction terms the constraint method leaves almost no leeway for fiddling with ( unnecessary ) cutoffs , etc .",
    "some years ago , when applied to the @xmath348 system , its structure proved restrictive enough to rule out within it the presence of postulated anomalous resonances@xcite . in recent work on the relation of our equations to the breit and earlier eddington - gaunt equations for electromagnetic bound - states , the method has explicitly demonstrated the importance of keeping spin couplings among pieces of the full 16-component wave - functions whose counterparts are often truncated or discarded in alternative treatments @xcite .",
    "the fits that we have examined as alternatives fall into different classes : motivated relativistic fits ( constraint vs truncations of standard field - theoretic ) , ad - hoc relativistic fits , and cautious semirelativistic fits .    among the relativistic ones ,",
    "there is a danger exemplified by the brayshaw model which achieves relative success despite the dubious relativistic nature of its interaction .",
    "as always , what makes fits hard to judge at this stage is the ease with which one can achieve apparent success over limited regions of the spectrum using highly - parametrized interactions .",
    "we have attempted to avoid this problem by limiting comparisons to published treatments that include both the light and heavy meson portions of the spectrum , not just one of the two sectors .",
    "our choices for comparison are meant to be representative ( we do not attempt an exhaustive review ) ( see @xcite for other important treatments )",
    ".    with the exception of the iowa state model @xcite all of the comparison models fail to test whether or not a nonperturbative treatment of  their wave equations would yield the known results if the qcd kernels used were to be replaced by ones appropriate for qed .  with the exception of the quark masses obtained by brayshaw ,",
    "@xcite our light quark masses are substantially closer to the current algebra values than are those produced by the other comparison models . in our application of the constraint approach , it is possible to describe the  nonperturbative physics that accommodates a typical size for an effective or constituent quark mass used in the other approaches and which at the same time has the size necessary to account for baryon magnetic moments .",
    "even though our @xmath162 and @xmath171 quark masses are small compared with constituent quark masses found in the competing approach , if we compute the expectation value @xmath349 we find a range that includes those values .",
    "we find the range of values for this effective mass from @xmath350 mev for the pion to @xmath351 mev for the rho .",
    "its value depends not only on the quantum numbers of the meson but also the flavor of the other quark .",
    "for example , for the @xmath196 meson we find @xmath352mev whereas for the @xmath200 we obtain 258 mev .",
    "finally , some authors have even produced unabashedly nonrelativistic fits .",
    "they claim to obtain good fits to the meson spectrum through the use of variants of the nonrelativistic quark model ( nrqm ) .",
    "@xcite , @xcite .",
    "these authors even claim success at fitting the light quark mesons for which the assumptions @xmath353 , @xmath354@xmath355 of the nonrelativistic schrdinger equation are patently false .",
    "what can account for the apparent success of the nrqm ?",
    "morpurgo states @xcite that the various potential models , including the nonrelativistic quark model , are merely different parametrizations of an underlying exact qcd lagrangian description .",
    "that is , all use essentially the same spin and flavor structures .",
    "for example , for the mesons one can derive a parametrized mass  with general form ( for the present discussion restricted to @xmath356 ) @xmath357 in which @xmath358 is the projector onto the strange quark sector .",
    "these authors say that this structure although typical of an nrqm description , follows from qcd itself .",
    "they state that the form eq.([mor ] ) is common to all of the relativistic or semirelativistic quark models .",
    "they assert that any one of them can be successful but not superior to any other , if it merely reproduces the spin flavor structure of the general parametrization .",
    "thus , from their point of view selection of the best  model is entirely a matter of taste and simplicity .",
    "we disagree with this assessment for the following reasons .",
    "first , the kinetic and potential parameters have significances beyond simply producing a fit for the two - body bound - state sector in isolation .",
    "when the spin - flavor structure in ( [ mor ] ) appears in the constraint approach , its accompanying constituent quark masses turn out to be closer to the current - quark masses than those produced by most other approaches while the constraint method requires only two parametric functions to be used beyond the parameters of the constituent quark masses .",
    "the constraint scheme successfully uses one set of these parametric functions for the entire spectrum of meson states including the radial as well as orbital excitations .",
    "but most importantly , within the bound - state spectrum itself , in our relativistic approach even though superficially sharing the basic spin - flavor structure ( [ mor ] ) , all potentials do not fare equally well .",
    "the essential point is that even in the simplest form of our equations , the parametrization is different from that given in the morpurgo form in that its parameters a , b , c , d , are themselves dependent on the energy operator on the left hand side . when that happens , some relativistic potentials do better than others .",
    "in particular , of those we investigated , the potential that works the best ( the adler - piran potential ) is one possessing many of the features important in lattice qcd calculations ( e.g. linear and subdominant logarithmic confining pieces ) .",
    "the combination of the constraint approach with the adler - piran potential embodies more of the important physical effects contained in qcd - related effective or numerical field theories .",
    "can one understand the apparent successes of the nrqm fits by starting from the relativistic treatments ?",
    "some authors @xcite and @xcite have used bounds on the kinetic square - root operator @xmath359 to attempt to understand the apparent success of the nonrelativistic potential models for relativistic quark - antiquark states . instead , we will give an explanation that starts directly from the relativistic constraint approach .",
    "some years ago , caswell and lepage @xcite rewrote a relativistic constraint equation in an effective nonrelativistic schrodinger - like form . here , we do the opposite and recast the nrqm schrodinger equation in a form resembling the constraint equation .",
    "as we have seen our two - body dirac equations lead to an effective schrdinger - like equation of the form @xmath360\\psi = b^{2}(w)\\psi\\ ] ] in the c.m .",
    "system this becomes @xmath361\\psi = b^{2}(w)\\psi\\ ] ] even though the stationary state nonrelativistic schrdinger equation @xmath362\\psi = e_{b}\\psi\\label{nre}\\ ] ] has a similar form , the corresponding structures in each have entirely different physical significances .",
    "for example , in eq.([nre ] ) , the vectors @xmath363 and @xmath364 are nonrelativistic quantities in contrast with their counterparts in the constraint approach that appear in the relativistic equation in the c.m . system .",
    "one can easily manipulate the nonrelativistic schrdinger equation into a form similar in appearance to the constraint schrdinger form by multiplying both sides of the equation by @xmath365 and adding @xmath366 to both sides .",
    "the result is @xmath361\\psi = b^{2}(w)\\psi\\ ] ] in which @xmath367 in numerical calculations the @xmath363 operator and @xmath364 variable are treated in the same manner in calculations based on both the relativistic constraint equation and the nonrelativistic equation .",
    "but as we have seen , they have different physical significances in each equation .  when used to fit parts of the meson spectrum ,",
    "the apparent success of the nrqm from this point of view is then due to its incorporation of variables numerically indistinguishable from their covariant versions together with a potential that fortuitously coincides ( for a limited range of states ) with a covariant one modified by an energy dependent constant term that varies from state to state .",
    "reference @xcite sets out two - body dirac equations containing general covariant interactions along with their accompanying schrdinger - like forms .",
    "the general interactions consist of the eight lorentz invariant forms corresponding to scalar , time and space - like vector studied here along with five others : pseudoscalar , time- and space - like pseudovector , axial and polar tensor .",
    "when eq.([tbdes ] ) is written in terms of the four four - component spinors @xmath369 it decomposes into eight coupled equations . in @xcite long and crater showed how these may be rearranged in pauli - form or schrodinger - like equations in terms of the combination @xmath214 in the process providing a simpler coupling scheme than that used in @xcite which involves coupled equations between @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "eq.(4.24 ) of reference @xcite yields the following equation ( simplified here for electromagnetic - like interactions ( @xmath370 ) and scalar interactions alone ) : @xmath371@xmath372\\phi_{+}\\]]@xmath373 in which the kinetic - recoil terms appear through the combinations : @xmath374\\bigr]\\ ] ]    @xmath375\\bigr]\\ ] ]    @xmath376\\bigr]\\]]@xmath377\\bigr].\\ ] ] manipulations using both sets of pauli - matrices then lead to the form presented in the text in eq.([sch ] ) .",
    "we obtain the radial forms of eq.([sch ] ) that we use for our numerical solution for the general fermion - antifermion system by forming standard matrix elements of spin - dependent operators ( see appendix c of ref.(@xcite  ) ) .",
