    "one method of analysis appears to dominate in describing the statistics of granular packings : computations of the distributions of normal forces are _ de rigeur_.    experimental studies on granular packings use a variety of techniques to measure the distribution of normal contact forces @xmath1 between particles and container walls @xcite , where @xmath2 - all measured normal forces @xmath3 are normalized with respect to the average force @xmath4 .",

    "we have demonstrated that large scale simulations of granular packings offer insight into the effects of particle friction on measurements of the distribution of particle - particle and particle - wall contact forces @xmath1 .",
    "our detailed comparison between simulation and empirical fits , obtained from experiments @xcite , showed moderate agreement .",
    "however , we were only able to fit our data over the full range in @xmath7 after renormalising our data by neglecting the smallest forces in the system ( using the partial data set ) .",
    "we reason that this is an appropriate way to account for the limited resolution in experiment .",
    "we also reiterate the fact that many simulation and numerical studies of force distributions do not show a clear exponential tail either at large @xmath7 and we believe this may partly be due to the resolution of very small forces in such computer experiments that affect the total normalisation parameters .",
    "we were able to discern the influence that friction plays on @xmath1 in the small force region .",
    "the fraction of particle - particle contacts that experience very small forces increases with friction even though the total number of contacts decreases with increasing @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "excluded volume effects rather than the functional form of the force law appear to dominate the bulk behaviour of the system for dense packings .",
    "our studies of very large systems show that the tails of @xmath1 become marginally steeper with decreasing friction , i.e.  @xmath85 in eq .",
    "[ equation1 ] increases as @xmath0 decreases .",
    "our ongoing work on simulating confined packings will investigate some of these issues further @xcite .",
    "the force - force spatial distribution function and contact point radial distribution function indicate that spatial correlations between the contact forces and the positions of the contact extends out only to approximately three particle diameters .",
    "this shows that force correlations dissipate quickly in the bulk and that the force transmission network propagates locally but becomes diffuse rapidly . on introducing a force",
    "cut - off scheme to analyse force - bearing structures , we found no clear evidence for distinct ` weak ' and ` strong ' force phases .",
    "in general this discussion was only concerned with unloaded or unperturbed amorphous granular packings . in this sense",
    "we have provided information on the `` reference state '' of a granular material from a microstructural point of view .",
    "this state is rather insensitive to friction and is primarily determined by construction history @xcite .",
    "although we have not investigated the perturbed state or response function of these systems @xcite , it is likely that particle properties play a much more significant role in the response of a granular system than in the static state .",
    "some theoretical treatments @xcite on force chain analysis may benefit from the information of this unperturbed system when calculating the resulting response of such a system under some force perturbation .",
    "in fact , the contact angle distribution in fig .",
    "[ figure7 ] seems to suggest that the ` splitting angle ' @xmath130 , in the language of ref .",
    "@xcite , does seem lie predominantly in the range @xmath131 . comparing the experimental visualisation in ref .",
    "@xcite and the theoretical model in ref .",
    "@xcite , the force chain analysis can be thought of as a superposition of force chains on top of the background force network .",
