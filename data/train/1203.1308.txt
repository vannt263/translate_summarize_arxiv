    "when considering the chromatic number of certain graphs , one may notice colourings which are best possible ( in that they use as few colours as possible ) but which are in some sense wasteful . for instance , an odd cycle can not be properly coloured with two colours but can be coloured using three colours in such a way that the third colour is used only once .",
