    "functional techniques based on the two - particle - irreducible ( 2pi ) effective action  @xcite provide a powerful tool to devise systematic non - perturbative approximations , of particular interest in numerous physical situations @xcite where standard expansion schemes are badly convergent @xcite .",
    "however , the systematic implementation of 2pi techniques for gauge theories has been postponed for a long time due to formal intricacies  @xcite . here",
    ", we discuss the issue of renormalization and show how to remove uv divergences for any loop approximation of the 2pi effective action . for the sake of simplicity , we consider qed in the vacuum although our approach could in principle be used for non - abelian gauge theories at finite temperature or finite chemical potential . we choose a covariant gauge ,",
    "for which the classical action reads @xmath0\\psi+\\frac{1}{2}a_\\mu\\big[g^{\\mu\\nu}\\partial^2-(1-\\lambda)\\partial^\\mu\\partial^{\\nu}\\big]a_\\nu\\right\\}\\,,\\ ] ] with @xmath1 the gauge fixing parameter .",
    "a detailed version of this work is found in  @xcite .",
    "the 2pi effective action for qed in the absence of mean fields is given by @xmath2=-i{\\hbox{tr}}\\ln d^{-1}-i{\\hbox{tr}}\\ , d_0^{-1}d+\\frac{i}{2}{\\hbox{tr}}\\ln g^{-1}+\\frac{i}{2}{\\hbox{tr}}\\,g_0^{-1}g+\\gamma_{\\rm int}[d , g]\\,,\\ ] ] where the trace tr includes integrals in configuration space and sums over dirac and lorentz indices .",
    "the free inverse propagators are given by @xmath3_{\\alpha\\beta}\\delta^{(4)}(x - y)\\,,\\\\ ig_{0,\\mu\\nu}^{-1}(x , y ) & = & \\left[\\,g_{\\mu\\nu}\\partial_x^2-(1-\\lambda)\\partial^x_\\mu\\partial^x_\\nu\\,\\right]\\delta^{(4)}(x - y)\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the functional @xmath4 $ ] is the infinite series of closed two - particle - irreducible ( 2pi ) diagrams with lines corresponding to arbitrary two - point functions @xmath5 and @xmath6 and with the usual qed vertex .",
    "the physical two - point functions @xmath7 and @xmath8 can be obtained from the condition that the 2pi functional be stationary , which can be written as @xmath9}{\\delta d^{\\beta\\alpha}(y , x)}\\right|_{\\bar d,\\bar g}\\equiv   \\bar\\sigma_{\\alpha\\beta}(x , y)\\,,\\\\   \\bar g_{\\mu\\nu}^{-1}(x , y)- g_{0,\\mu\\nu}^{-1}(x , y ) & = &   -2i\\left.\\frac{\\delta\\gamma_{\\rm int}[d , g]}{\\delta g^{\\nu\\mu}(y , x)}\\right|_{\\bar d,\\bar g}\\equiv \\bar\\pi_{\\mu\\nu}(x , y)\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the next sections we explain how to renormalize @xmath7 and @xmath8 . in this procedure , an important role",
    "is played by the four - point function with four photon legs which is constructed as follows ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "first , one defines the 2pi four - point kernels @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 by @xmath14 } { \\delta g_{\\nu\\mu}(p)\\,\\delta g_{\\rho\\sigma}(k)}\\right|_{\\bar d,\\bar g}\\ , , \\\\",
    "\\bar\\lambda_{gd}^{\\mu\\nu;\\alpha\\beta}(p , k ) & \\equiv & \\left.-2\\frac{\\delta^2\\gamma_{\\rm int}[d , g ] } { \\delta g_{\\nu\\mu}(p)\\,\\delta d_{\\alpha\\beta}(k)}\\right|_{\\bar d,\\bar g}\\ , , \\\\",
    "\\bar\\lambda_{dg}^{\\alpha\\beta;\\mu\\nu}(p , k ) & \\equiv & \\left.-2\\frac{\\delta^2\\gamma_{\\rm int}[d , g ] } { \\delta d_{\\beta\\alpha}(p ) \\,\\delta",
    "g_{\\mu\\nu}(k)}\\right|_{\\bar d,\\bar g}\\ , , \\\\",
    "\\bar\\lambda_{dd}^{\\alpha\\beta,\\delta\\gamma}(p , k ) & \\equiv & \\left.\\frac{\\delta^2\\gamma_{\\rm int}[d , g ] } { \\delta d_{\\beta\\alpha}(p)\\,\\delta d_{\\delta\\gamma}(k)}\\right|_{\\bar d,\\bar g}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these are then combined in order to build the kernel @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 the kernel @xmath18 is 2pi with respect to photon lines but 2pr ( two - particle - reducible ) with respect to fermion lines .",
    "finally the four - photon function @xmath19 is obtained from the equation @xmath20 where @xmath21 .",
    "the four - photon function @xmath19 is 2pr both with respect to fermion and photon lines .",
    "in the absence of mean fields , the 2pi effective action satisfies the ward - takahashi identity @xmath22=\\gamma_{\\rm int}[g , d]$ ] with @xmath23 and @xmath24 . in view of eliminating divergences in @xmath7 and @xmath8 ,",
    "one modifies the 2pi effective action by adding a shift @xmath25 $ ] compatible with all the symmetries of the system , namely lorentz and gauge symmetry . at two - loop order",
    "the shift reads for instance : @xmath26&=&\\int_x\\left\\ {   -{\\hbox{tr}}\\big[(i\\delta z_2\\slashchar{\\partial}_x -\\delta m)d(x , y)\\big ]   + \\frac{\\delta z_3}{2}\\,\\big(g^{\\mu\\nu}\\partial_x^2   -\\partial_x^\\mu\\partial_x^\\nu\\big)g_{\\mu\\nu}(x , y)\\right.\\nonumber\\\\   & & \\qquad+\\frac{\\delta\\lambda}{2}\\,\\partial_x^\\mu\\partial_x^\\nu g_{\\mu\\nu}(x , y )   + \\frac{\\delta m^2}{2}\\,{g^\\mu}_\\mu(x , x)\\nonumber\\\\   & & \\qquad\\left.+\\,\\frac{\\delta g_1}{8}\\,{g^\\mu}_\\mu(x , x){g^\\nu}_\\nu(x , x)+   \\frac{\\delta g_2}{4}\\,g^{\\mu\\nu}(x , x)g_{\\mu\\nu}(x , x)\\right\\}_{\\!\\!y = x}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 denotes the trace over dirac indices . the counterterms @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30",
    "are the analog of the corresponding ones in perturbation theory",
    ". only appears at higher orders in the 2pi loop - expansion . ]",
    "the extra counterterms @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 have no analog in perturbation theory but are allowed by the 2pi ward - takahashi identity .",
    "their role is to absorb non - transverse divergences in the two- and four - photon functions . at higher loops ,",
    "additional diagrams including counterterms need to be considered .",
    "if we were to work with the exact 2pi effective action ( no truncations ) , it would be easy to check that the two - photon and four - photon functions @xmath35 and @xmath19 are transverse .",
    "this would prevent the appearance of non - transverse divergences in @xmath35 and @xmath19 and would lead to @xmath36 , as one is used to in perturbation theory .",
    "however , one has in general to approximate the 2pi effective action by truncating its diagrammatic expansion to a certain loop order .",
    "this leads to non - transverse contributions in the two- and four - photon functions .",
    "for instance , at two - loop order order , one can check that divergent non - transverse contributions appear in @xmath19 at order @xmath37 : @xmath38 where @xmath39 represents the dimension of space in dimensional regularization . in general , at @xmath40-loop order , non - transverse divergences appear at order @xmath41 and one has to devise a procedure to consistently remove them .",
    "first one needs to remove four - photon sub - divergences in @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "a diagrammatic analysis reveals that these are nothing but the ones encoded in @xmath19 .",
    ", @xmath8 and @xmath19 is also easily seen at finite temperature where requiring that @xmath7 and @xmath8 do not contain temperature dependent divergences is equivalent to requiring that @xmath19 is finite . ]",
    "renormalization of @xmath19 is then achieved by tuning @xmath33 and @xmath34 via the renormalization condition @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the longitudinal projector , with @xmath44 .",
    "notice that , as the number of loops goes to infinity , the renormalization condition becomes an identity ( 1pi ward - takahashi identity ) , ensuring that no new parameter is introduced and that @xmath45 and @xmath46 , as they should .",
    "once sub - divergences have been eliminated , there only remain overall divergences in @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "divergences in @xmath7 are removed as usual via @xmath30 and @xmath28 which are fixed by imposing the renormalization conditions @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "similarly , for the photon self - energy , one can impose the following condition on the transverse part of the photon polarization tensor @xmath49 .",
    "usually ( in perturbation theory for instance ) , this is enough to fix the photon wave - function renormalization counterterm and to remove all divergences , which are purely transverse . in the 2pi framework , however , non - transverse divergences appear and one needs to fix three counterterms @xmath29 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "two other independent conditions are thus needed .",
    "again , we choose renormalization conditions which are automatically fulfilled in the exact theory in order to ensure that @xmath50 and @xmath51 , in the limit of an infinite number of loops .",
    "a possible choice is to impose transversality of the photon polarization tensor : @xmath52 since in the exact theory the transversality condition has to hold for all momenta , one can further impose that @xmath53    9 j.  m. luttinger , j.  c. ward , prd * 118 * , 1417 ( 1960 ) ; g. baym , pr * 127 * , 1391 ( 1962 ) ; j.  m. cornwall , r. jackiw , e. tomboulis , prd * 10 * , 2428 ( 1974 ) . j.  p.  blaizot , e.  iancu , a.  rebhan , in _ quark gluon plasma 3 _ , eds .",
