    "in the last two decades considerable research attention has been paid to the study of supermarket models .",
    "supermarket models are a class of interesting parallel queueing networks with dynamic and real - time adaptive control , for example , size - based routine selection , and information - based resource scheduling .",
    "such a supermarket model can be applied to , such as , computer networks , manufacturing systems , transportation networks and healthcare systems . since",
    "a simple supermarket model was discussed by mitzenmacher @xcite , vvedenskaya et al . @xcite and turner @xcite ,",
    "more studies have been done by , for instance , vvedenskaya and suhov @xcite , graham @xcite , luczak and mcdiarmid @xcite , bramson et al .",

    "for the fast jackson networks ( or supermarket networks ) , readers may refer to martin and suhov @xcite , martin @xcite and suhov and vvedenskaya @xcite .    in many stochastic networks , servers subject to breakdowns and repairs always encounter in practical areas , such as , computer systems , communication networks , manufacturing systems , and transportation networks .",
    "because system performance deteriorates quickly due to servers breakdowns and limited repair capacity , analyzing such a stochastic systems with repairable servers is not only important from theoretical perspective but also necessary from practical engineering . on this research line ,",
    "important examples include mitrany and avi - ttzhak @xcite , neuts and lucantoni @xcite , kulkarni and choi @xcite , li et al .",

    "it is interesting but difficult to discuss stochastic systems of parallel queues with unreliable servers , e.g. , see an excellent survey by adan et al .",
    ". up to now , the available results on parallel - queue systems with repairable servers are still very few .",

    "ravid et al .",
    "@xcite considered the repair systems with exchangeable items and the longest queue mechanism .",
    "stimulated by practical need of many distributed parallel systems , the study of supermarket models and work stealing models is highly paid attention on computer systems and communication networks .",
    "this motivates us in this paper to apply the mean - field theory to analyzing supermarket models with servers subject to breakdowns and repairs , which are a class of important complex reliability networks , and specifically , the different groups of repairmen make analysis of such a reliability network more difficult and challenging .",
    "it is necessary to provide a simple survey for the mean - field theory .",
    "the mean - field equations and the asymptotic independence ( or propagation of chaos ) play an important role in the study of interacting particle systems , e.g. , see liggett @xcite and kipnis and landim @xcite . for the mean - field theory of",

    "the main contributions of this paper are threefold .",
    "the first one is to describe and analyze a class of important complex reliability networks : supermarket models with repairable servers , which play a key role in performance evaluation of computer systems and of communication networks .",
    "notice that a supermarket model contains multiple repairable servers , thus the different groups of repairmen make analysis of the supermarket model more complicated .",
    "in the situation , this paper considers four interrelated supermarket models with repairable servers through observing two different arrival dispatched schemes and two different groups of repairmen .",
    "the second contribution is to apply the mean - field theory to studying the four interrelated supermarket models with repairable servers .",
    "this paper demonstrates such a mean - field analysis through the following three steps : ( a ) providing a probability computation for setting up the systems of mean - field equations , ( b ) calculating the fixed points through the systems of nonlinear equations , and ( c ) giving performance analysis of the supermarket models with repairable servers and developing numerical computation for useful observation on model improvement .",
    "the third contribution is to provide a better example in order to demonstrate how to develop numerical solution in the study of complex supermarket models . since the nonlinear structure of the mean - field equations makes a supermarket model almost impossible to find an analytic solution to the system of mean - field equations , it is a key to sufficiently develop numerical computation in performance evaluation of supermarket models .",
    "based on this , numerical examples are used to provide valuable observations on how to improve performance of supermarket models either from system parameter optimization or from various resource deployment ( e.g. , arrival dispatched schemes , allocated service ability , and groups of repairmen ) .    finally , note that this paper discusses a special class of supermarket models with unreliable servers , while their failed states and the groups of repairmen have influence on the arrival joining schemes .",
    "to analyze such a supermarket model , the most relevant references to this paper are li et al .",
    "@xcite and li and lui @xcite from two points of view : ( 1 ) the environment invariant factors were proposed to setting up systems of mean - field equations for complex supermarket models . as studied in li et al .",
    "@xcite , this paper also analyzes a double dynamic routine selection scheme both for the arrival dispatched schemes and for the groups of repairmen .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that such a multiple dynamic routine selection scheme is a new and interesting topic in the study of supermarket models and of work stealing models .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we first describe four interrelated supermarket models with repairable servers where customer arrivals make use of system information and repair ability is grouped in some different structures .",
    "then we use the fraction vector to describe an infinite - dimensional markov process for each supermarket model with repairable servers . in sections 3 ,",
    "we provide two types of probability representations both for the arrival dispatched schemes by means of system information and  for the repair ability grouped in different ways . in sections 4 , for each of the four interrelated supermarket models with repairable servers , we set up an infinite - dimensional system of mean - field equations . in section 5 , we discuss the fixed points for the systems of mean - field equations , and show that the fixed points can be determined by the systems of nonlinear equations . in section 6 ,",
    "we first provide useful performance measures of the supermarket models with repairable servers .",
    "then we use some numerical examples to make valuable observations on model improvement by means of performance numerical comparison .",
    "section 7 concludes with a summary .",
    "the proofs of some key results are provided in appendix a.",
    "in this section , we first describe four interrelated supermarket models with repairable servers , where the arrival dispatched schemes make use of system information and the repair ability is grouped in different ways .",
    "then we use the fraction vector ( or empirical measure ) to describe an infinite - dimensional markov process for each supermarket model with repairable servers .      *",
    "the arrival processes *    customers arrive at the system as a poisson process with arrival rate @xmath0 for @xmath1 . upon arrival",
    ", an arriving customer chooses @xmath2 servers from the @xmath3 servers independently and randomly .",
    "then the customer will select one server ( or queue ) to join .",
    "such a server selection is based on two different information observations as follows :    * ( a.1 ) * _ . _",
    "the arriving customer joins the shortest queue among the @xmath4 queues .",
    "if there is a tie , the customer makes the choice equally likely among the shortest queues of the same length .    *",
    "( a.2 ) * .",
    "the arriving customer joins the shortest queue with the working server as higher priority than the server in repair among the @xmath4 selected servers .    * the service processes *    the service times at each server are i.i.d . and",
    "are exponential distributed with service rate @xmath5 .    * the repair processes",
    "*    each server has an exponential life time with failure rate @xmath6 .",
    "when the server fails , it enters a failure state and undergoes the repair process immediately .",
    "the service of a customer interrupted by a server s failure is resumed as soon as the server is repaired .",
    "we assume that the repaired server is as good as new and the service time is cumulative . to deploy the repair resource effectively",
    ", we consider three types of repair schemes as follows :    * ( r.1 ) * _ .",
    "_ there are @xmath3 repairmen corresponding to the @xmath3 servers , and thus each server has a repairman of itself . the repair times are i.i.d exponential random variables with repair rate @xmath7 .    *",
    "( r.2 ) * _ . _ * * there is only one fast repairman whose repair time is exponentially distributed with repair rate @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "this super repairman chooses @xmath10 servers from the @xmath3 servers randomly .",
    "if all the @xmath11 servers are working , then the repairman is idle ; if at least one of the selected @xmath11 servers is failed , then the repairman repairs the failed server with the longest queue .",
    "if there is a tie , the repairman select one randomly .    *",
    "( r.3 ) * _ .",
    "_ there are a large repairman and @xmath12 small repairmen , where the repair time of the large repairman is exponentially distributed with the repair rate @xmath13 , and the repair time of each small repairman is exponentially distributed with repair rate @xmath7 .",
    "each of the @xmath12 small repairmen can repair one failed server at a time , if any ; whilst the large repairman chooses @xmath11 servers from the @xmath3 servers independently and randomly . if all the selected @xmath11 servers are working , then the large repairman is idle ; if at least one of the selected @xmath11 servers is failed but not repaired by small repairmen yet , then the large repairman repairs the failed server with the longest queue .",
    "if there is a tie , the repairman selects the failed server with the longest queue .",
    "we assume that all the random variables defined above are independent of each other .",
    "figure 1 shows a supermarket model with repairable servers and a large repairman .",
    "now , we construct four interrelated supermarket models with repairable servers , which are constructed by different combinations of ( a.@xmath14 ) * * and ( r.@xmath14 ) for @xmath15 as follows :    * model i * ( ( a.@xmath16 ) * * and ( r.@xmath16 ) ) : in this model , an arriving customer only needs to observe the queue lengths of the @xmath4 selected server and joins the shortest queue .",
    "there are @xmath3 repairmen corresponding to the @xmath3 servers , hence each server has one repairman of itself .",
    "* model ii * ( ( a.@xmath16 ) * * and ( r.@xmath17 ) ) : in this model , the queue selection rule is the same as model i. however , there is only one super repairman who chooses @xmath11 servers from the @xmath3 servers independently and uniformly at random . if all the selected @xmath11 servers are working ,",
    "then the repairman is idle ; otherwise , the repairman repairs the failed server with the longest queue length .    * model iii * ( ( a.@xmath17 ) * * and ( r.@xmath16 ) ) : in this model , an arriving customer observe not only the queue lengths of the @xmath4 selected servers , but also the states ( working or repairing ) of the @xmath4 selected servers .",
    "the customer then joins the shortest queue with working servers having higher priority than failed servers .",
    "there are @xmath3 repairmen corresponding to the @xmath3 servers , hence each server has one repairman of itself .",
    "* model iv * ( ( a.@xmath17 ) * * and ( r.@xmath17 ) ) : in this model , the customer s queue selection rule is the same as model iii .",
    "however , there is only a super repairman , which chooses @xmath11 servers from the @xmath3 servers independently and uniformly at random .",
    "if all the selected @xmath11 servers are working , then the repairman is idle ; otherwise , the repairman repairs the failed server with the longest queue .",
    "actually , ( r.@xmath18 ) is a more general scheme of repair resource allocation , and its analysis can be completed through by modifying the mean - field equations in ( r.@xmath16 ) and ( r.@xmath17 ) . here , we do not consider ( r.@xmath18 ) , and ( r.@xmath18 ) will be investigated in another paper .",
    "next , we shall provide a complete mathematical analysis for the four interrelated supermarket models , and present some numerical examples to show how the system information ( ( a.@xmath14 ) * * and repair resource allocation ( r.@xmath14 ) for @xmath15 ) affect performance of the supermarket models with repairable servers .",
    "some insightful observations are made for designing and controlling the arrival , service and repair processes to improve the supermarket models .",
    "now , we use the empirical measure to provide an infinite - dimensional markov process for studying each of the four interrelated supermarket models with repairable servers .    for @xmath19 ,",
    "we denote by @xmath20 the numbers of working ( or idle ) servers  with at least @xmath19 customers at time @xmath21 , and @xmath22 the numbers of failed servers with at least @xmath23 customers  at time @xmath21 .",

    "let@xmath30@xmath31 and@xmath32 clearly , the state of the supermarket model of @xmath3 identical repairable servers is described as a stochastic process @xmath33 .",
    "since the arrival process is poisson , and the distributions of the service , life and repair times are all exponential , @xmath34 is an infinite - dimensional markov process whose state space is given by@xmath35    for a fixed pair array @xmath36 with @xmath21 and @xmath37 , it is easy to see from the stochastic order that @xmath38  for @xmath19 and @xmath39  for @xmath23 .",

    "in this section , we provide two types of probability representations for customer arrivals by means of system information and  for repair ability grouped in different ways . for notational simplicity , the two types of probability representations are denoted as the four pair control schemes : ( ( a.@xmath14 ) , * * ( r.@xmath14 ) ) for @xmath15 .",
    "the probability representations are useful for establishing the systems of mean - field equations later .    for the supermarket models of @xmath3 identical repairable servers , to set up the probability representations , we only need to determine the expected change in the number of servers with at least @xmath28 customers over a small time period @xmath49 .",
    "this subsection provides the probability representations for the arrival processes , in which the two different cases of ( a.@xmath16 ) and ( a.@xmath17 ) are discussed .",
    "note that the analysis of ( a.@xmath16 ) is similar to that of li et al .",

    "<S> supermarket models are a class of interesting parallel queueing networks with dynamic randomized load balancing and real - time resource management . </S>",
    "<S> when the parallel servers are subject to breakdowns and repairs , analysis of such a supermarket model becomes more difficult and challenging . in this paper , we apply the mean - field theory to studying four interrelated supermarket models with repairable servers , and numerically indicate impact of the different repairman groups on performance of the systems . </S>",
    "<S> first , we set up the systems of mean - field equations for the supermarket models with repairable servers . </S>",
    "<S> then we prove the asymptotic independence of the supermarket models through the operator semigroup and the mean - field limit . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we show that the fixed points of the supermarket models satisfy the systems of nonlinear equations . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we use the fixed points to give numerical computation for performer analysis , and provide valuable observations on model improvement . </S>",
