    "as we entered a new energy frontier at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) with data collected at @xmath6  gev , 2360  gev , and 7  tev from fall 2009 to spring 2010 , it became painfully clear that the monte carlo ( mc ) simulations designed to represent the collective knowledge of the field on diffractive cross sections and event final states did not meet the challenge presented to them in this new higher energy environment .",
    "the most commonly used event generators , pythia  @xcite and phojet  @xcite , were found to disagree not only with the data but also with each other .",
    "the latter clearly meant that the two simulations could not both be right .",
    "therefore , an update of the mcs was urgently needed .",
    "because of the importance of minimum - bias ( mb ) mc simulations in estimating trigger rates , backgrounds , and the machine luminosity at the lhc , a `` diffraction '' workshop was organized at cern on 7 may 2010  @xcite that brought experimentalists and theorists together to exchange ideas with the goal of producing a reliable mc generator for the lhc .",
    "this paper is based on a talk i presented at that meeting and an expanded version presented at this workshop .",
    "diffraction dissociation in @xmath0/@xmath1 interactions may be defined by the signature of one or more `` large '' and characteristically not exponentially suppressed  @xcite rapidity gaps ( regions of rapidity devoid of particles )  @xcite in the final state .",
    "the rapidity gap is presumed to be due to the exchange of a strongly - interacting color singlet quark / gluon combination with the quantum numbers of the vacuum , traditionally referred to as `` pomeron ''  ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "diffractive processes are classified as single diffraction ( sd ) , double pomeron exchange ( dpe ) , also referred to as central dissociation ( cd ) , and double diffraction ( dd ) . in @xmath1 sd@xmath8  ( sd@xmath9 ) , the @xmath10 dissociates while the @xmath11 remains intact escaping the collision with momentum close to that of the original beam momentum and separated from the @xmath12  ( @xmath13 ) dissociation products by a _",
    "forward _ gap ; in dpe both the @xmath13 and the @xmath12 escape , resulting in _ two forward gaps _ ; and in dd a _",
    "central _ gap is formed while both the @xmath12 and @xmath13 dissociate .",
