    "the simplest known definition of the jones polynomial is the kauffman bracket @xcite , which in this paper will be denoted by @xmath5 and will be called the @xmath6 bracket .",
    "the @xmath6 bracket is given by the following recursive rules : @xmath7    the goal of this part of the paper is to derive definitions of the following three variants of the jones polynomial :    there is an invariant for regular isotopy of projections of links and tangled trivalent graphs called @xmath8 which is given by the following recursive rules : @xmath9 where the coefficients are defined as : @xmath10 @xmath11 is an indeterminate , and @xmath12 .",
    "[ existg2 ]    there is an invariant for regular isotopy of projections of links and tangled trivalent graphs called @xmath13 which is given by the following recursive rules : @xmath14 where @xmath11 is an indeterminate and @xmath15 .",
    "[ exista2 ]    there is an invariant for regular isotopy of projections of links and tangled trivalent graphs called @xmath16 which is given by the following recursive rules : @xmath17 where @xmath11 is an indeterminate and @xmath18 .",
    "part of the invariant can also be defined by the recursive rules : @xmath19 which are related to the first set of rules by : @xmath20 [ existc2 ]    these invariants are not new .",
    "in fact , all three invariants are special cases of the reshetikhin - turaev invariants @xcite .",
    "( it should be emphasized that these invariants are part of a wide literature of closely related ideas .",
    "two other influential papers are @xcite and @xcite . )",
    "according to reshetikhin and turaev , for each simple lie algebra @xmath21 , there exists an invariant @xmath22 of appropriately colored tangled ribbon graphs .",
    "each edge is colored by an irreducible representation of @xmath21 and each vertex should be colored by a tensor of a certain kind .",
    "the invariants we define all satisfy @xmath23 if the graph is colored in a certain simple way .",
    "( by our notation , the kauffman bracket also satisfies this equation . )",
    "this connection will be explained in detail in the second part of the paper .",
    "in addition , the @xmath24 bracket is essentially a specialization of the homfly polynomial @xcite , because the homfly polynomial describes @xmath25 ; and the @xmath26 bracket is essentially a specialization of the kauffman polynomial , because the kauffman polynomial @xcite    describes @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 . by the relation @xmath30",
    ", the @xmath26 bracket encompasses a second specialization of the kauffman polynomial .",
    "( the kauffman polynomial should not be confused with the kauffman bracket . )",
    "thus , the most interesting case is the @xmath0 bracket .",
    "the reshetikhin - turaev definition in the @xmath0 case is also cast in an explicit form in @xcite .",
    "the author recently learned that many of the results presented here , in particular the definition of the @xmath24 and @xmath0 brackets , were obtained independently by francois jaeger @xcite .",
    "the author would like to thank andrew casson , vaughan jones , robion kirby , kenneth millett , nicolai reshetikhin , and oleg viro for their sustained interest in the work that resulted in this paper and for their helpful comments .",
    "the author is also indebted to rena zieve for checking certain important calculations .      by a planar graph we mean a finite combinatorial graph which is embedded in the sphere @xmath31 .",
    "we allow planar graphs to have edges which go in a circle and have no vertices , as well as a multiple edges between vertices and vertices connected to themselves .",
    "a face of a planar graph is a connected component of the complement of the graph .",
    "when interpreting the illustrations of planar graphs in this paper , the reader should identify the border of the page to a point .",
    "let @xmath32 be a disk in @xmath31 .",
    "we define a planar graph with boundary to be the intersection of @xmath32 with a planar graph which is transverse to the boundary of @xmath32 .",
    "thus a planar graph with boundary is a graph which is embedded in a disk such that the edges of the graph meet the boundary of the disk transversely at special vertices of degree 1 , called endpoints .",
    "the boundary of a planar graph in @xmath32 is defined to be the boundary of @xmath32 together with the endpoints and an inward - pointing normal .",
    "if @xmath33 is a boundary , the opposite boundary @xmath34 is defined to be the same object with the distinguished normal vector reversed . in this paper",
    "we will consider graphs decorated in various ways and it is understood that the endpoints of a graph with boundary should be decorated correspondingly .",
    "for example , if the edges of a graph are colored , the endpoints should be assigned the same colors . if the edges are oriented , each endpoint should be assign a distinguished normal vector .",
    "the idea is that if two possibly decorated planar graphs have opposite boundaries , their union should be a planar graph without boundary decorated in the same way .",
    "we define a graph projection to be a planar graph with special tetravalent vertices , called crossings , such that one pair of opposite incoming edges is labeled as passing `` over '' the other pair , like so : @xmath35 we define a graph projection with boundary similarly .",
    "we define a regular isotopy of a graph projection to be a sequence of operations consisting of ambient isotopy of the 2-sphere and the following combinatorial moves : @xmath36 there are versions of the last two moves for every possible kind of vertex in the graph , although the moves are only illustrated for a trivalent vertex .",
    "we define a tangled ribbon graph ( introduced in @xcite ) to be an equivalence class of graphs projections under regular isotopy .",
    "regular isotopy moves for graph projections with boundary are the same , except that an ambient isotopy must leave the boundary of the graph fixed .",
    "we can also consider regular isotopy of graphs decorated in various ways ; there is a version of each regular isotopy move for every possible decoration of the arcs involved in the move .",
    "two important classes of graph projections are those with no vertices , which are called link projections , and those with only trivalent vertices , which we will call freeway projections .",
    "( a link projection with boundary is allowed to have univalent vertices at the boundary . ) here is an example of a freeway projection : @xmath37 a ribbon link ( also called a framed link ) is an equivalence class of link projections , a freeway is an equivalence class of freeway projections , a ribbon link with boundary ( also called a framed tangle ) is an equivalence class of ribbon links with boundary , and a freeway with boundary is an equivalence class of freeway projections with boundary .",
    "here is an example of a freeway projection with boundary : @xmath38    a tangled ribbon graph has a natural 3-dimensional interpretation as ( the equivalence class under ambient isotopy of ) a graph embedded in @xmath39 together with a ( continuous ) distinguished normal vector at each point .",
    "alternatively we can think of a tangled ribbon graph as a graph embedded in @xmath39 together with a ribbon ( a long , thin rectangle ) assigned to each edge and a disk assigned to each vertex with the incident ribbons attached at the boundary in such a way that an oriented surface results .",
    "a graph projection is then the projection of the graph in the usual sense , where the normal vector everywhere points upward out of the plane of the projection , or the surface consisting of the ribbons and disks lies flat against the plane of the projection .",
    "a tangled ribbon graph with boundary can be thought of as a graph , with its ribbons or normal vectors , embedded in a ball in @xmath39 and with its endpoints lying at the boundary of the ball .",
    "we define a freeway invariant to be a function defined on freeway projections which depends only on the underlying freeway .",
    "the topological invariants presented in this paper are best understood as linearly recurrent invariants .",
    "let @xmath40 be some @xmath41-valued invariant of some tangled graphs @xmath42 which are possibly decorated in some way .",
    "there is a natural way to extend the invariant @xmath43 to an invariant @xmath44 for graph with boundary @xmath45 which takes values in a certain vector space over @xmath41 which depends only on @xmath46 .",
    "if @xmath33 is a boundary , then we let @xmath47 be the vector space of all @xmath41-valued functions on the set of all links with boundary @xmath34",
    ". then if @xmath48 , we can choose @xmath49 to simply be the function which takes @xmath50 to @xmath51 .",
    "we call the resulting invariant @xmath52 the vector invariant associated to the scalar invariant @xmath43 .",
    "so far , the notion of @xmath52 is not very interesting because the vector space @xmath47 may be very large .",
    "however , it may happen that only a small portion of @xmath47 is needed to understand the original invariant @xmath43 .",
    "we define the spanning space @xmath53 to be the span of @xmath44 for all @xmath45 such that @xmath48 .",
    "we say that @xmath43 is a linearly recurrent invariant , or a recurrent invariant for short , if @xmath53 is finite - dimensional for all @xmath33 .",
    "the motivation for the name is that if the dimension of the space @xmath53 is small , then it is often possible to define the original invariant @xmath43 recursively by describing the invariant @xmath54 and the vector space it lives in for only a few choices of @xmath45 , a strategy which is similar to the definition of a linearly recurrent sequence of numbers .",
    "another more suggestive notation for scalar and vector invariants is bra - ket notation , by analogy with quantum mechanics . in this notation",
    "the value of the scalar invariant for some link or tangled graph @xmath42 is @xmath55 , while the corresponding vector invariant for some link or tangled graph with boundary @xmath45 is denoted @xmath56 .    as a warm - up for the rest of the paper , we review the derivation and definition of the kauffman bracket , a linearly recurrent invariant of regular isotopy of links .",
    "we denote the kauffman bracket by @xmath5 and by the bra - ket convention we denote the corresponding vector invariant by @xmath57 .",
    "we assume that the 4-point spanning space is 2-dimensional and that the two crossingless tangles with 4 endpoints are a basis , and we assume that the 0-point spanning space is 1-dimensional . in this case",
    "there are necessarily relations : @xmath58 if we assume that the bracket is invariant under the first of the regular isotopy moves , we can compute : @xmath59 to obtain the consistency equations : @xmath60 we must also check the second regular isotopy move . however , by a ubiquitous trick in the theory of linearly recurrent invariants , if the ket of a crossing is a linear combination of kets of crossingless tangles ( or in other contexts crossingless graphs ) , the second regular isotopy move is a corollary of the first regular isotopy move ( more generally , a corollary of other moves involving vertices ) .",
    "we parameterize the solutions by setting @xmath61 , which is slightly peculiar but is natural with hindsight .",
    "we obtain the recursive rules described in the introduction .",
    "the invariant is completely determined except for its value at the empty link , which lies at the base of the recursive rules .",
    "the choice of this value is equivalent to the choice of a global normalization factor .",
    "the most natural normalization in the context of this paper is to choose @xmath62 .",
    "we assume that there is a scalar freeway invariant @xmath8 whose corresponding vector invariant is @xmath63 and which satisfies the following condition : for @xmath64 , the bracket of the acyclic , crossingless freeways with @xmath65 endpoints are linearly independent vectors , and that the bracket of a freeway which consists of a face with @xmath65 sides is a linear combination of these acyclic freeways .",
    "these freeways are precisely the ones listed in the statement of theorem  [ existg2 ] .",
    "thus , we assume the existence of coefficients @xmath66 , @xmath33 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 as given in the statement of theorem  [ existg2 ] ( but we do not yet assume the formulas given for those coefficients ) .",
    "we call this assumption the 1,0,1,1,4,10 ansatz because there are 1,0,1,1,4 , and 10 acyclic freeways with 0,1,2,3,4 , and 5 endpoints , respectively . note that by symmetry there can only be two distinct coefficients for the relation for a square and pentagon , for otherwise the bracket of a square or a pentagon would satisfy more than one linear relation , which would violate the linear independence assumption .    [ uniqg2 ] every freeway invariant which satisfies the 1,0,1,1,4,10 ansatz is equal to the invariant defined in theorem  [ existg2 ] for some value of @xmath11",
    ".    we will proceed by proving theorem  [ uniqg2 ] .",
    "along the way all of the conditions for the existence of the invariant will be met , thereby proving theorem  [ existg2 ] .",
    "the following lemma shows that the coefficients @xmath66,@xmath72,@xmath71 completely determine @xmath8 for crossingless freeways , provided that the coefficients are chosen so that the bracket exists , up to a choice of global normalization .",
    "as in the case of the kauffman bracket , we choose for the sake of convention @xmath12 .",
    "let @xmath73 be a non - empty crossingless freeway .",
    "the graph @xmath73 has at least one simply - connected face with five or fewer sides which does not share an edge with itself .",
    "if we allot each face one third of each of its vertices and one half of each of its edges , then the euler characteristic of a simply - connected face with @xmath65 sides is @xmath74 and the euler characteristic of a multiply - connected face is negative or zero .",
    "if no face shares an edge with itself , then since the euler characteristic of the sphere is 2 , we must have at least one face with positive euler characteristic .",
    "suppose instead that at least one face does share an edge with itself .",
    "then we may draw a circle which is inside this face except at one point : @xmath75 if we draw a circle for each such face , then at least one of the circles must be innermost , i.e. it must bound a region containing no such faces .",
    "the total euler characteristic of the faces in this region is at least 5/6 , so once again there must be a face in the region with the desired property .    a variation of the proof of this lemma yields a self - justification for the 1,0,1,1,4,10 ansatz : if a crossingless freeway has @xmath65 endpoints , then either the freeway is acyclic or the total euler characteristic of its faces is at least @xmath74 . if @xmath64 , then any freeway with @xmath65 endpoints is a linear combination of acyclic freeways .",
    "the ansatz implies that the acyclic freeways are bases for the first six spanning spaces of the bracket .",
    "we now derive the values for the coefficients @xmath66 , @xmath33 , @xmath67 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 which are consistent for the values of the bracket on all crossingless freeways .",
    "let @xmath78 be a minimal crossingless freeway projection for which the recursive definition contradicts itself .",
    "suppose that the projection @xmath78 has two faces @xmath79 and @xmath45 with five or fewer sides which are not adjacent .",
    "then reducing the face @xmath79 must yield the same result as reducing the face @xmath45 , because after we reduce @xmath79 we are still free to reduce @xmath45 , and vice versa .",
    "thus , the only possibility of a contradiction arises when @xmath78 has two adjacent faces with at most five sides .",
    "suppose , for example , that @xmath78 has a triangle next to a pentagon ; it suffices to consider the case when @xmath78 is a triangle next to a pentagon and nothing more , like so : @xmath80 we can in this case reduce either the pentagon or the triangle : @xmath81 by the linear independence assumptions , we obtain the scalar equations :    @xmath82    we can perform this procedure for all cases of a face with @xmath65 sides adjacent to a face with @xmath83 sides except @xmath84 .",
    "we obtain the equations :    @xmath85    since we have not made any linear independence assumptions for freeways with six endpoints , we do not obtain any equations which the coefficients must satisfy _ a priori _ in the case of two neighboring pentagons .",
    "nevertheless , we must check the equations anyway , since the relevant freeways might be linearly independent . here",
    "are the equations which result : @xmath86    the only remaining possibility is that there are two faces with five or fewer sides which have two or more edges as their common border .",
    "this case is inconsequential and the reason is left as an exercise to the reader .",
    "undeterred by the sprawl of these equations and by the fact that there are more constraints than unknowns , we can proceed by reducing them to a sequence of relatively simple relations .",
    "first , we note that one solution can be varied in an uninteresting way to obtain another : we can multiply @xmath33 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath70 by a constant and @xmath69 and @xmath71 by the square of that constant . to eliminate this degree of freedom ,",
    "we normalize by declaring that @xmath87 .",
    "( the case @xmath88 produces only trivial solutions . )",
    "then we can eliminate variables by using some of the equations to simplify the algebra : we find that @xmath89 by equation ( [ firsttodo ] ) , then express @xmath69 in terms of @xmath68 by equation ( [ secondtodo ] ) , then @xmath67 in terms of @xmath68 by equation ( [ thirdtodo ] ) , then we find @xmath33 by equation ( [ fourthtodo ] ) , and finally @xmath66 by equation ( [ fifthtodo ] ) . in the process",
    "we see that the other equations are satisfied automatically , and we are left with a second free parameter .",
    "we make the useful reparameterization @xmath90 , with @xmath11 an indeterminate , to obtain the solutions given in the statement of theorem  [ existg2 ] .    to extend the invariant to links and to freeways with crossings , we further assume that a crossing is a linear combination of the four acyclic , crossingless freeways with four endpoints . to find the four coefficients @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 for this linear dependence",
    ", we must investigate the behavior of the bracket under the regular isotopy moves .",
    "we first reduce the `` before '' and `` after '' pictures of the first regular move : @xmath95 this yields the equations :    @xmath96    the third and fourth moves result in the equations : @xmath97    comparing equations ( [ usemea ] ) and ( [ usemeb ] ) , we obtain : f_1 g_1 = f_2 g_2 = = [ usemee ] multiplying equations ( [ usemec ] ) and ( [ usemed ] ) and substituting the formula ( [ usemee ] ) , we obtain : @xmath98 since we now know the sum and the product of @xmath99 and @xmath100 , we obtain a quadratic equation .",
    "the result is the solutions given in the statement of theorem  [ existg2 ] .",
    "it remains to check the second regular isotopy move .",
    "as in the case of two adjacent pentagons , we do not obtain any equations which the coefficients must satisfy _ a priori _ , but we must check the move anyway . in this case",
    "the ubiquitous trick which was left as an exercise to the reader in the case of the kauffman bracket appears again .",
    "if we have invariance under the other moves , and if a crossing is a linear combination of crossingless freeways , then the second regular isotopy move is automatically satisfied .",
    "in solving the quadratic equation we must break a galois symmetry which maps the parameter @xmath11 to @xmath101 . a rationale for making the choice presented here , as well as for choosing the parameter @xmath11 in the first place ,",
    "will be presented in the second part of the paper .",
    "we can repeat the approach of section  [ secconstruct ] two more times by changing the notion of a freeway and picking a new ansatz . to avoid confusion ,",
    "let us define a @xmath0 freeway to be what we previously called a freeway .",
    "the solutions will be polynomial invariants of a single variable .",
    "however , for the purpose of a uniform treatment of all of the invariants , it is desirable in general to make this variable a certain root of a variable @xmath11 which will be reused for each of the invariants .",
    "therefore the final answers will be elements of the field @xmath102 .",
    "for every rational number @xmath66 we distinguish a power @xmath103 of the indeterminate @xmath11 in such a way that for every integer @xmath65 , @xmath104 .",
    "we define an @xmath24 freeway to be an oriented planar graph with crossings and junctions that look like this : @xmath105 we assume the existence of a regular isotopy invariant @xmath13 which satisfies the 1,0,1,1,2 ansatz : the acyclic , crossingless @xmath24 freeways with 0,1,2,3 , or 4 endpoints are assumed to be bases for their respective spanning spaces .",
    "this ansatz , although simpler , comes with some technicalities . in the 2-endpoint case , one endpoint must be oriented inward and the other outward . in the 4-endpoint case",
    ", two endpoints must be oriented inward and two outward , and we get two different bases which differ in the ordering of the endpoints in the projection : @xmath106 the two possible boundaries are equivalent , but not canonically , so there is no canonical formula for a change of basis . the endpoints of a 3-endpoint freeway must all be oriented inward or all outward , but in fact the 3-endpoint case of the ansatz is not needed in the derivation of the invariant .",
    "the 1-endpoint case is even less relevant to the derivation because there are no @xmath24 freeways whatsoever with only 1 endpoint .    by a derivation similar to that of section  [ secconstruct ] ,",
    "the only possibilities for @xmath13 are the ones described by theorem  [ exista2 ] .",
    "as before , the rules given in the theorem suffice as an recursive definition because any trivalent planar graph must have a face with at most 5 sides , except the situation is simpler because all faces of an @xmath24 freeway must have an even number of sides .",
    "the invariant @xmath13 is identically equal to @xmath107 if all edges are colored with the 3-dimensional representation @xmath108 .",
    "the edges are oriented because the representation is not self - dual .",
    "the invariant is a special case of the homfly polynomial with a normalization that makes it a regular isotopy invariant rather than an isotopy invariant : @xmath109    we also define a @xmath26 freeway to be a planar graph with two kinds of edges , illustrated as double and single edges , with junctions and crossings that look like this : @xmath110 the ansatz for @xmath16 has a somewhat different form .",
    "we first assume the existence of a relation which we call a switching relation : @xmath111    associated to the switching relation is a switching move : @xmath112 we define a switching class of @xmath26 freeways to be an equivalence class under switching moves .",
    "we say that a double edge of a @xmath26 freeway is external if at least one of its vertices is an endpoint of the freeway , otherwise the edge is internal",
    ". then the ansatz says that when @xmath113 , a collection of acyclic , extended @xmath26 freeways with @xmath114 single endpoints and @xmath115 double endpoints and no internal double edges are a basis if the collection has one representative from each switching class .",
    "the caveat about ordering of endpoints applies here just as in the @xmath24 case .    by a third iteration of section  [ secconstruct ] ,",
    "the only possibilities for @xmath16 are those of theorem  [ existc2 ] . to show that these rules suffice as an inductive definition , we define the angles of a ( trivalent ) junction to be @xmath116 , @xmath116 , and @xmath117 , like so : @xmath118 we define the curvature of a face to be @xmath119 minus the sum of the exterior angles . by an euler characteristic argument",
    ", every crossingless @xmath26 freeway without boundary must have a face with positive curvature , and such a face can be reduced by the switching move to one for which one of the other moves applies .",
    "another approach to the @xmath26 bracket is to define an extended @xmath26 freeway to be one which can also have tetravalent vertices with no incident double edges .",
    "a tetravalent freeway is one with no double edges whatsoever .",
    "we assume the existence of a relation : @xmath120 where the constants @xmath121 and @xmath122 are arbitrary except that @xmath121 must be non - zero to avoid degeneracy .",
    "if we interpret the four angles at a tetravalent vertex to be 90 degrees , we can derive recurrence rules for tetravalent freeways by reducing faces with positive curvature , namely faces with at most 3 sides . a face with @xmath65 sides now has @xmath123 endpoints , and for @xmath124 the number of acyclic tetravalent graphs with @xmath123 endpoint is 1,1,3 , and 14 .",
    "but by the ansatz for the @xmath26 bracket , these acyclic graphs must be a basis provided that @xmath125 .",
    "thus we obtain an example of a linearly recurrent theory for tetravalent graphs ; double edges and trivalent vertices are avoided .",
    "( note that a tetravalent vertex should not be confused with a crossing . )",
    "moreover , some of the choices of the constants @xmath121 and @xmath122 result in a simpler recurrent calculus than others .",
    "a particularly fortuitous choice is @xmath126 and @xmath127 , whose first advantage is a simpler relationship between the trivalent and tetravalent theories : @xmath128 its second advantage is that in the recurrence relations , the coefficients of 1 of the acyclic graphs with 4 endpoints and 10 of the acyclic graphs with 6 endpoints vanish .",
    "the resulting recurrence relations are those given in the second half of the statement of theorem  [ existc2 ] .",
    "currently the tetravalent @xmath26 bracket , for various values of @xmath121 and @xmath122 , merely represents examples of linearly recurrent invariants that satisfy the 1,1,3,14 ansatz .",
    "what are all the invariants of tangled tetravalent graphs that satisfy this ansatz ?",
    "the @xmath26 bracket constitutes two special cases of the kauffman polynomial , one for plain edges and one for double edges .",
    "the two relations it satisfies , both in `` dubrovnik '' form , are : @xmath129      in this section we present the results of a few calculations with @xmath8 .",
    "we begin with the auxiliary recursive rules : @xmath130 note that these rules can be inferred from @xcite , and that they allow one to compute the bracket for any knot with 7 or fewer crossings .",
    "the simplest link which seems to defeat these rules is the borromean rings , with 6 crossings and 3 components .",
    "unfortunately , the borromean rings have also defeated the author s attempts at calculations by hand .",
    "however , some other possibly interesting values of the bracket and relations of the ket follow : @xmath131 note that all of the links and graphs are evaluated with the projection framing .",
    "in this part of the paper we place the invariants @xmath132 in the proper context of the invariants @xmath22 defined by reshetikhin and turaev in @xcite and study their properties from the point of view of representation theory of lie algebras .",
    "we review some of the theory of finite - dimensional left modules , or representations , of a hopf algebra @xmath133 .",
    "if we have two representations @xmath134 and @xmath135 , the tensor product @xmath136 is also a representation by the coalgebra structure of @xmath133 .",
    "there is a trivial representation @xmath43 such that @xmath137 canonically .",
    "however , there is no canonical isomorphism between @xmath136 and @xmath138 as representation of @xmath133 , and indeed the two modules need not be isomorphic at all . in particular , the switching map , which takes @xmath139 to @xmath140 , is in general not a module homomorphism . on the other hand",
    ", we do have @xmath141 , and it is still true that if @xmath79 and @xmath45 are morphisms between representations , @xmath142 is also .",
    "also , for each representation @xmath134 there is a representation @xmath143 and a canonical identification of @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "there is also a representation @xmath146 with a canonical identification of @xmath147 with @xmath148 .",
    "although there are canonical isomorphisms @xmath149 , @xmath150 need not be isomorphic to @xmath134 .",
    "finally , we define @xmath151 by analogy with the case when @xmath133 is a group algebra .",
    "there is a visual notation for morphisms in the category of @xmath133-modules and their compositions .",
    "if @xmath152 is a morphism from @xmath153 to @xmath154 , we can represent @xmath152 by a diagram with one vertex : @xmath155 similarly for compositions of morphisms .",
    "for example , if @xmath156 , @xmath157 , and @xmath158 are morphisms , then we can express @xmath159 by the diagram : @xmath160 note that the facts stated in the previous paragraph allow us to erase internal edges labeled with the representation @xmath43 ; by a slight abuse of notation we may , for example , draw a morphism @xmath161 as : @xmath162    in general these diagrams must be planar graphs in which none of the edges pass through a slope of zero .",
    "however , it is sometimes possible to augment the structure of a hopf algebra to obtain a ribbon hopf algebra , in which the graphs can have edges that bend arbitrarily and can have edges that cross each other , provided one arm of each crossing is labeled `` over '' and the other `` under '' .",
    "first , there is a distinguished element @xmath163 of @xmath164 which we can use to construct , for each @xmath134 and @xmath135 , an isomorphism @xmath165 which is denoted by a right - handed crossing : @xmath166 the inverse @xmath167 , which need not equal @xmath168 , is denoted by a left - handed crossing : @xmath169 second , there is a distinguished element @xmath170 of @xmath133 which we can use to construct an isomorphism @xmath171 .",
    "it follows that there exist canonical morphisms which can be denoted as follows : @xmath169 in light of the existence of these morphisms and the identification of @xmath143 and @xmath146 , we can orient the edges of the diagrams and declare that an edge labeled with @xmath143 is equivalent to an oppositely oriented edge labeled with @xmath134 . in a ribbon hopf algebra the elements @xmath163 and @xmath170 must satisfy certain axioms which can be translated to various identities for the corresponding morphisms . here",
    "are some of these identities : @xmath172    these identities allow us to interpret the finite - dimensional representation theory of a given ribbon hopf algebra @xmath133 as an invariant of colored ribbon graphs , where each edge is colored by a representation of @xmath133 and each vertex is colored by an element of @xmath173 , where @xmath174 are the colors of the incoming edges going clockwise around the vertex .",
    "( the vertex must also be marked to identify which edge corresponds to the first factor in the tensor product ; however there is an identification between the sets of colors allowed for two different markings .",
    "although there is no single preferred isomorphism between @xmath136 and @xmath175 , there is such an isomorphism between @xmath176 and @xmath177 .",
    "it is constructed from the @xmath178 morphisms . )",
    "we may interpret the value of a ribbon graph with no endpoints as a morphism from @xmath43 to @xmath43 , i.e. as a scalar invariant .",
    "but the invariant is also a linearly recurrent invariant ; the spanning space of endpoints colored with @xmath174 is again @xmath173 .",
    "this invariant of colored ribbon graphs is the reshetikhin - turaev invariant corresponding to the ribbon hopf algebra @xmath133 .",
    "we remark that for a fixed graph , the invariant is multilinear under direct sums , and more generally under extensions , of the colors of the edges , so it suffices to consider irreducible representations as colors .",
    "we also consider the consequences of an irreducible representation @xmath134 being self - dual .",
    "if @xmath134 is symmetrically self - dual , i.e. there is an element @xmath45 of @xmath179 which is invariant under the switching map , then we can allow an unoriented edge colored by @xmath134 by interpreting it as two oriented edges using @xmath45 : @xmath180 on the other hand , if @xmath134 is anti - symmetrically self - dual , i.e. the invariant tensor @xmath45 negates under the switching map , then this construction has a sign ambiguity . but suppose that all representations of @xmath133 are self - dual , some of them anti - symmetrically self - dual",
    ". then we may resolve the ambiguity by observing that the reshetikhin - turaev theory works equally well for hopf superalgebras . if we reinterpret anti - symmetrically self - dual representations as being negatively graded , they become supersymmetric .",
    "it is possible to replace the hopf algebra @xmath133 with a hopf superalgebra @xmath181 for which these are the natural gradings .",
    "the other essential ingredient in the reshetikhin - turaev theory is a collection of examples of ribbon hopf algebras . for each simple",
    "lie algebra @xmath182 there is a hopf algebra @xmath183 , the quantized universal enveloping algebra of @xmath182 , over the field @xmath184 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the representation ring of this hopf algebra is the same as that of @xmath182 or @xmath185 .",
    "consequently we will refer to the irreducible representations @xmath183 as @xmath186 , where @xmath187 is the highest weight of the corresponding representation of @xmath182 .",
    "however , the calculus of morphisms between the representations is only the same as that for @xmath182 at the specialization @xmath188 .",
    "we denote the corresponding ribbon graph invariant by @xmath22 .",
    "the most important first case of the ribbon graph invariants is their value on the untwisted unknot colored with some @xmath186 .",
    "the value of @xmath22 for this graph is known as the quantum dimension of @xmath186 and equals the trace of the element @xmath170 .",
    "this element is a member of the subalgebra of @xmath183 generated by the cartan subalgebra of @xmath182 , and this subalgebra is the same as the corresponding subalgebra of a certain completion @xmath185 , the ordinary universal enveloping algebra . if @xmath189 is half of the sum of the positive roots of the root system of @xmath182 and @xmath190 is the corresponding element of the cartan subalgebra , then @xmath191 .",
    "the upshot is that the trace of @xmath170 on @xmath186 is @xmath192 , where @xmath121 runs over the weights of @xmath186 and @xmath193 is the multiplicity of @xmath121 .",
    "another formula for the quantum dimension is the quantum weyl dimension formula : @xmath194}{\\prod_{\\alpha \\succ 0 } \\left[(\\rho,\\alpha ) \\right]},\\ ] ] where @xmath195 = \\frac{q^{n/2}-q^{-n/2}}{q^{1/2}-q^{-1/2}}$ ] is a `` quantum integer '' ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ch . 6 , p. 151 ) for a proof that this is the trace of @xmath170 ) .",
    "for example , when @xmath196 , we obtain : @xmath197[12][2]}{[6][4]}\\ ] ] as the quantum dimension of the smallest non - trivial irreducible representation .",
    "note , however , that when we perform a supersymmetric conversion of a ribbon hopf algebra @xmath133 as described above , the quantum dimension of a negatively graded representation negates .",
    "we restrict our attention to the exceptional simple lie algebra @xmath0 .",
    "all representations of @xmath0 are symmetrically self - dual .",
    "the vector space @xmath200 is 1-dimensional ; let us choose some element @xmath201 in it . we interpret a @xmath0 freeway as a colored ribbon graph by coloring all edges with the 7-dimensional representation @xmath108 and all vertices with @xmath201 .",
    "in this way we obtain a value of @xmath202 for @xmath0 freeways .",
    "we can verify by a computation with weight diagrams that @xmath203 is 1,0,1,1,4 , and 10 as @xmath65 ranges from 0 to 5 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "a lengthier calculation shows that the values of @xmath202 on acyclic graphs with @xmath65 endpoints are indeed a basis for @xmath204 and @xmath188 ( and therefore also for @xmath11 an indeterminate ) . the author and rena zieve performed this calculation explicitly .",
    "the tensor @xmath201 was chosen as a trilinear form @xmath205 on @xmath108 .",
    "it is well - known that for the compact real lie group @xmath0 , @xmath108 can be interpreted as the imaginary octonions , or cayley numbers , which are equipped with a positive - definite inner product and a cross product , a bilinear function `` @xmath206 '' with the property that if @xmath66 and @xmath33 are orthogonal unit vectors , @xmath207 is a unit vector which is orthogonal to both @xmath66 and @xmath33 .",
    "we define @xmath208 .",
    "the conclusion is that the invariant @xmath202 satisfies the 1,0,1,1,4,10 ansatz .",
    "it remains only to show that the parameter @xmath11 in @xmath202 agrees with the parameter @xmath11 in @xmath8 .",
    "to do this we first check that the quantum dimension of @xmath108 equals the constant @xmath66 in the recurrence relation of @xmath8 , and we compute the factor gained by a right - hand twist : @xmath209 we verify that @xmath210 .",
    "thus , the two parameterizations are the same , up to a constant factor in the choice of @xmath201 .",
    "( the choice of @xmath201 above for the explicit @xmath188 computation agrees with the right choice for @xmath8 . )",
    "notice in particular that the casimir element is always positive , which assures us that the ambiguity between @xmath11 and @xmath101 has been resolved in agreement with convention .    by similar but simpler reasoning",
    "we can show that @xmath211 , where all edges of an @xmath24 freeway are colored with the 3-dimensional representation @xmath108 , whose dual is @xmath212 .",
    "the orientations of the edges are needed because @xmath108 is not self - dual .",
    "the colors for the vertices can be recognized as the determinant , or the usual 3-dimensional cross product .",
    "we also have @xmath213 , where the single edges are colored with the 4-dimensional representation @xmath108 and the double edges are colored with the 5-dimensional representation @xmath212 . the representation @xmath108 is the canonical representation of @xmath214 .",
    "note that it is anti - symmetrically self - dual . to convert from @xmath16 , where edges are not oriented , we must use the hopf superalgebra @xmath215 instead of @xmath216 .",
    "this superalgebra can also be thought of as @xmath217 , where @xmath218 is an orthosymplectic lie superalgebra .",
    "( similarly , the kauffman bracket @xmath5 more properly describes invariants from the representation theory of @xmath219 rather than the theory of @xmath220 . ) finally , the representation @xmath212 is the canonical representation of @xmath221 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath66 , @xmath33 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 in the definition of the @xmath0 bracket , as well as their analogues for the @xmath24 and @xmath26 brackets , are all laurent polynomials in @xmath11 with either nonpositive or nonnegative integer coefficients .",
    "this is a coincidence which can not be explained by the freedom in choosing the parameter @xmath11 .",
    "the coefficients could be complicated rational or even algebraic functions _ a priori_. moreover , using the notion of a quantum integer given above , we can write :      the coefficients for the @xmath24 and @xmath26 brackets have similar expressions . in general , saying that a laurent polynomial in @xmath11 invariant under @xmath223 with rational coefficients is a ratio of products of quantum integers is equivalent to saying that the zeroes of the polynomial are all roots of unity .",
    "the known properties of quantum dimension provide the answer to this question in the case of the coefficient @xmath66 as well as the value of the unknot for the other brackets .",
    "however , the author knows no analogous reasoning for the other coefficients .",
    "let us say that a crossingless @xmath0 freeway ( also an @xmath24 freeway ) has non - positive curvature if all interior faces have at least six sides . from the definition of @xmath8 ,",
    "it is clear that the set of freeways of non - positive curvature spans the spanning space of tangles with @xmath65 endpoints .",
    "it is not so clear when @xmath224 that the same freeways span the corresponding spanning space for @xmath202 , which can be identified with the vector space @xmath225 .",
    "nevertheless , it follows from the fundamental theorem of invariant theory for @xmath0 @xcite :    ( schwarz ) the set of all multilinear invariant forms on the imaginary octonions is generated by addition and multiplication of an invariant bilinear form @xmath226 , an invariant trilinear form @xmath205 ( both unique up to a scalar multiple ) , together with the hodge dual of @xmath205 .",
    "let us call the third form @xmath227 .",
    "then the theorem says that graphs of this form : @xmath228 span @xmath225 .",
    "strictly speaking , the theorem only applies when @xmath188 , but by genericity , it must also hold for @xmath11 an indeterminate . also , although the graphs mentioned by the theorem have crossings and also a new tetralinear form , both of these are some linear combination of the four acyclic @xmath0 freeways with four endpoints .",
    "thus , the set of all freeways span , and therefore the ones with non - positive curvature do too .",
    "it suffices to show that the number of such freeways equals @xmath229 .",
    "the latter number is also equal to the coefficient of the @xmath230 term in the polynomial : @xmath231 by the character formulas in @xcite .",
    "the author has verified the conjecture up to @xmath232 by this method ; the number of acyclic , crossingless freeways with @xmath65 endpoints for @xmath65 from 0 to 9 is 1 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 4 , 10 , 35 , 120 , 455 , and 1728 , respectively .",
    "the situation is similar for @xmath24 and @xmath26 .",
    "it follows from the classical fundamental theorem of invariance theory for @xmath233 and @xmath234 that freeways with non - positive curvature span .",
    "however , the endpoints of an @xmath24 freeway must be labeled as either `` incoming '' or `` outgoing '' depending on the orientation of the edges containing the points , and the endpoints of a @xmath26 freeway are labeled as `` single '' or `` double '' .",
    "recall that in the @xmath26 case we have extra equivalences which are conveyed by switching moves .",
    "consider a fixed set of @xmath41 incoming and @xmath65 outgoing points on a circle .",
    "the set of @xmath24 freeways of nonpositive curvature having these points as endpoints is a basis for @xmath235 .",
    "it suffices to show that the number of such freeways equals the coefficient of the @xmath236 term in the polynomial : @xmath237    consider a fixed set of @xmath41 points labeled `` single '' and @xmath65 points labeled `` double '' on a circle .",
    "a collection of @xmath26 freeways of nonpositive curvature , with one member in each switching class , constitutes a basis for @xmath238 .",
    "it suffices to show that the number of switching classes equals the coefficient of the @xmath236 term in the polynomial : @xmath239 [ conjc2 ]    note that these conjectures have an analogue for the kauffman bracket as well . in this case",
    "we may conjecture that crossingless tangles with @xmath123 endpoints form a basis for @xmath240 . by the fundamental theorem of invariant theory they must form a spanning set ; it is well - known that the both the number of tangles and the dimension of the invariant space equal the catalan number @xmath241 .",
    "richard stanley and john stembridge have shown the author a proof of conjecture [ conjc2 ] in the case @xmath242 by a variant of the berele insertion algorithm @xcite , which plays the same role in the combinatorics of @xmath243 that the robinson - schensted algorithm does in the combinatorics of @xmath244 . recall that when @xmath242 we can consider tetravalent freeways instead of switching classes of trivalent freeways .",
    "( sketch ) let @xmath245 be a tetravalent freeway with nonpositive curvature .",
    "let @xmath246 be the @xmath123 endpoints of @xmath245 .",
    "we interpret @xmath245 as a collection of crossing line segments whose endpoints are the @xmath247 s , so that the @xmath247 s are paired by arcs of the freeway .",
    "we let @xmath248 if @xmath247 is connected to @xmath249 .",
    "then the function @xmath83 is a perfect matching , a fixed - point - free involution of the numbers from 1 to @xmath123 .",
    "let @xmath250 to be the matching @xmath83 , constructed using @xmath245 .",
    "it is easy to show by induction on @xmath65 that the matching @xmath250 satisfies what we will call the 6-point condition : for every three numbers @xmath251 , @xmath252 , and @xmath253 , we can not simultaneously have @xmath254 .",
    "moreover , @xmath83 is a bijection between freeways with non - positive curvature and matchings that satisfy the 6-point condition .    for each @xmath255 from 0 to @xmath123",
    ", we construct a young tableau @xmath256 , an infinite array whose entries are positive integers or infinity .",
    "all but finitely - many entries of a young tableau must be infinity , and the rows and columns must be non - decreasing . here is an example of a young tableau with the infinities omitted : @xmath257 the young tableaux @xmath258 and @xmath259 are both the empty tableau , the one with no finite entries . we proceed to construct @xmath256 from @xmath260 by considering @xmath261 .",
    "if @xmath262 , we insert @xmath261 into @xmath260 by schensted insertion : we replace the highest entry @xmath263 in the first column which is greater than @xmath261 with @xmath261 .",
    "if @xmath263 is finite , we then insert @xmath263 by schensted insertion into the tableau consisting of the second column onward ; if @xmath263 is infinity , we stop .",
    "if @xmath264 , we remove @xmath255 by berele deletion : we replace @xmath255 in the tableau by infinity , and then we repeatedly switch the misplaced infinite entry by the entry below or the entry to the right , whichever is smaller , until the array becomes a young tableau again .",
    "let @xmath265 be the support of @xmath256 , the set of place where @xmath256 is non - zero .",
    "the sequence of @xmath265 s is called an up - down tableau , and the algorithm described here is a bijection between matchings of @xmath123 elements and up - down tableaux of length @xmath123 .",
    "see @xcite for a proof of this fact .",
    "matchings which happen to satisfy the 6-point condition correspond to tableaux with at most two rows . to see this",
    ", we observe that if some @xmath256 has two rows and the entry in the first column of the second row is @xmath266 , then @xmath266 is the smallest number such that @xmath267 and for some @xmath268 , @xmath269 . therefore if we consider the first @xmath256 with three rows , we see that only a violation of the 6-point condition could have resulted in transforming @xmath260 to @xmath256 .",
    "conversely , if a matching does violate the 6-point condition , the corresponding up - down tableau must at some point have three rows by the same principle .",
    "if an element of an up - down tableau has at most two rows , then that element can be described by a pair of integers @xmath270 with @xmath271 , where @xmath66 is the number of elements in the first row and the @xmath33 is the number in the second row .",
    "thus , we obtain , for each matching , a sequence of pairs of integers @xmath272 with @xmath273 such that @xmath274 and such that either @xmath275 or @xmath276 differs by 1 from @xmath277 or @xmath278 and the other is equal . this sequence is a lattice path in the weyl chamber of the lie algebra @xmath26 , and by the character theory of lie algebras , the number of such paths is the dimension of @xmath279 .",
