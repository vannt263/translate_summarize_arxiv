    "the discrepancy between the number of observed dwarf satellite galaxies of the milky way and the anticipated number of dark matter halos in cosmological simulations has been heralded as the `` missing satellite problem '' @xcite and it still remains one of the greatest puzzles of the @xmath0cdm paradigm .",
    "one class of suggested solutions to this puzzle involves modifications to the nature of dark matter ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or to the initial conditions of cosmic structure ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while another class of solutions invokes astrophysical arguments such as inefficient cooling of cosmic gas and/or feedback from young stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    motivated by this latter class of solutions , ( * ?",
    "* hereafter referred to as kgk04 ) developed a star formation model for the satellite galaxies , based on the mass assembly histories of individual dark matter halos in a @xmath0cdm cosmological simulation .",
    "that model incorporated the accretion of gas in hierarchical mergers and the loss of gas caused by the extragalactic uv background , and included both a continuous mode and a starburst mode of star formation .",
    "the model correctly reproduced the observed number of satellites of the milky way and m31 , the radial distribution of luminous satellites , and the morphological segregation of dwarf irregular ( dirr ) and dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies .",
    "recent @xmath1-body simulations of @xcite , with the updated wmap3 cosmological parameters , have confirmed the qualitative picture of kgk04 .",
    "the amount of observational data for local group dwarfs has been increasing steadily in the last several years , shifting the focus from simply counting the number of dwarf galaxies to deriving their detailed star formation histories ( sfhs ) .",
    "most local group dwarfs have now been observed with the _ hst _ , which has provided color - magnitude diagrams of resolved stellar populations in single or multiple fields @xcite .",
    "we parametrize these data as the fractions of stars formed in the last 1  gyr , 2  gyr , 5  gyr , and 10  gyr , and present these fractions in our table [ tab : sfdata_lg ] .",
    "the data show a great variety of star formation histories  some continuous , some bursty , some truncated . in this paper",
    "we extend the model of kgk04 to account for such varied histories of the local group dwarfs and argue that adding a stochastic threshold to the star formation law greatly improves the comparison between models and observations .",
    "we also make predictions for the number of ultra - faint satellites of the milky way and m31 of which there have been many recent discoveries with the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) and the megacam survey @xcite .",
    "our approach is complementary to running full hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy formation .",
    "we attempt to model star formation with a phenomenological recipe , containing several but not too many free parameters .",
    "we investigate the effects of varying each of these parameters and constrain them by comparing the model predictions for each parameter set with the observations . in this way",
    ", we obtain empirical rules that govern star formation in dwarf galaxies , even though we may not yet fully understand their physical origin . in an alternative approach",
    ", one uses cosmological hydrodynamic simulations with a detailed prescription for gas cooling and star formation , and thus obtains more physically sound results .",
    "discrepancies between the simulation results and the data may , however , be difficult to interpret or computationally expensive to investigate . by combining the two approaches ,",
    "our empirical rules will guide future developments of more sophisticated models of galaxy formation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we give a brief summary of the observational data in  [ sec : obs ] .",
    "we describe our model in  [ sec : model ] and report the primary results from adding stochasticity to the star formation law in ",
    "[ sec : threshold ] . in ",
    "[ sec : other ] we describe the results of several variants of our star formation model , including late accretion of gas , steeper slopes of the schmidt law , an extended epoch of reionization , and rejection of galaxies with delayed star formation ; none of these changes significantly alters our results . in  [ sec : lowmass ] we show our model projections for the new low - mass dwarfs , and in  [ sec : conclusions ] we summarize our main results .",

    "the star formation data used in this study , and listed in table  [ tab : sfdata_lg ] , come primarily from hubble space telescope observations with the wfpc2 camera . for a majority of the dwarfs ,",
    "the sfhs were measured by the color - magnitude diagram fitting method , described in @xcite , using photometric data from the local group stellar photometry archive @xcite .",
    "we condense the data into five parameters  the fractions of stellar mass formed in the last 1 , 2 , 5 , and 10 gyr , respectively ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) , and the mass - weighted mean age of the stellar population ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the hst observations included in archive are far from homogeneous , and , therefore , the uncertainties in the derived star formation histories cover a broad range .",
    "however , by concentrating on cumulative star formation fractions the uncertainties are greatly reduced , compared to specific star formation rates at specific times . thus , the entries in table  [ tab : sfdata_lg ] do not have associated errors .",
    "constraining comparisons between models and observations to cumulative distributions greatly reduces the sensitivity of these comparisons to uncertainties in individual galaxies .",
    "note that the observed _ hst _ fields do not necessarily cover the full extent of each galaxy and , therefore , do not allow us to calculate the total stellar mass .",

    "the star formation data are inferred from @xcite .",
    "since they give the star formation rates per unit area , in units of @xmath15 , separately for the disk and the bar of the lmc , we assume that the extent of the disk is 3.5 times larger than the extent of the bar in determining the star formation fractions and the mean age ( a.  a. cole , personal communication ) .",
    "the star formation histories for five dwarfs ( m32 , m33 , antlia , sextans , ursa minor ) are taken from table 1 of @xcite .",
    "since that table does not include the fraction of a galaxy s star formation in the last @xmath16 gyr or @xmath17 gyr , our table is also missing these entries , except for sextans and ursa minor .",
    "@xcite reported that sextans and ursa minor have formed no stars in the past 10 gyr ( i.e. , @xmath18 ) , which implies that the fractions of stars formed in the last 1  gyr , 2  gyr , and 5  gyr are also consistent with zero .",
    "for the purpose of comparing the radial distributions of different morphological types with model predictions , we combine the sc , irr , and dirr types into one broadly - defined `` dirr '' group , and the de , dsph types into the `` dsph '' group .    one object not included in table  [ tab : sfdata_lg ] is the canis major dwarf , discovered by @xcite in the sdss field , which could be part of a larger monoceros tidal stream .",
    "this object is the closest discovered to the galaxy , at a heliocentric distance of only 8 kpc .",
    "whether this galaxy is still gravitationally self - bound is unclear at present @xcite , but in any case it is being strongly tidally disrupted .",
    "an additional reason for not including it in our comparison is that such an object would have been completely disrupted in the @xmath1-body numerical simulation used to construct our models .",
    "note also that table  [ tab : sfdata_lg ] does not include any of the newly - discovered sdss and megacam ultrafaint dwarfs , since they are likely to have stellar masses below @xmath19 .",

    "the disks are vertically puffed - up , which works to the same effect to reduce the gas density .",
    "the observed stellar core radii in the local group dwarfs are a factor of @xmath41 smaller than those predicted by our model , which may favor the vertical expansion over the radial one assumed here . however , since it would not change the surface density @xmath42 , we can not fit it in our framework of the kennicutt - schmidt law of star formation .",
    "the spin parameter @xmath32 is drawn randomly from a standard log - normal distribution with @xmath43 and @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "this adds an intrinsic variance in the predictions of the star formation model . while the kgk04 model used only one set of the randomly - selected @xmath32 values to compare with the observations , in this paper we take 10 random realizations of each model , in order to account for this intrinsic variance .",
    "the gaseous disk is modeled spatially by 50 radial zones . at each simulation output epoch",
    "( about every @xmath45 yr ) , the newly accreted gas is added to these radial zones , according to the exponential profile of eq .",
    "( [ eq : gas_radial ] ) . in each zone , the rate of star formation is determined by the kennicutt - schmidt law : @xmath46 wherever the gas density , @xmath42 , exceeds the threshold , @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "standard parameters are @xmath48 , @xmath25 , and @xmath49 .",
    "most of the variants of the model discussed in this paper employ this star formation law but with an important addition , described in  [ sec : threshold ] below .",
    "in addition to this quiescent mode of star formation , the model also allows a starburst mode prompted by strong tidal interactions with other halos ( see section 6.1 in kgk04 ) . in this mode",
    "there is no density threshold and even galaxies with @xmath50 can form stars if a strong enough interaction occurs .    finally , the effect of stellar evolution is taken into account following @xcite .",
    "they find that some 40% of the initial stellar mass is lost to stellar wind and supernovae after @xmath51 gyr , given the assumptions of the initial stellar mass function from @xcite , stellar remnant masses as a function of initial stellar mass from @xcite , and main sequence lifetimes from @xcite . in the models investigated here",
    "we simply assume that 40% of the initial stellar mass is lost between the time when the stars formed and the present day .",
    "we do not `` recycle '' the liberated gas back into the ism , which would make it available to form more stars . as a result",
    "our estimate of the stellar masses are the lower limit of the true masses  a simple decrease of the total stellar mass , @xmath10 , for each dwarf by a factor of @xmath52 .",
    "accordingly , the @xmath53g}$ ] and @xmath54 values are unchanged by stellar evolution in our models and since the _ hst _ photometry for the milky way satellites is typically good enough to measure the main sequence stars we simply compare the observed @xmath53g}$ ] and @xmath54 values ( table  [ tab : sfdata_lg ] ) to the same quantities for the simulated dwarfs without any corrections .",
    "we mark as luminous ( having corrected @xmath10 for stellar evolution as just described ) those satellite halos with a predicted stellar mass @xmath3 at @xmath27 .",
    "such a cutoff agrees with the observational limit of all local group dwarfs ( table [ tab : sfdata_lg ] ) known until a few years ago , when the ultrafaint dwarfs were discovered .",
    "we defer the discussion of the model predictions for these low - mass objects until  [ sec : lowmass ] .    as in kgk04 , we do a rough morphological classification of dwarf galaxies as dsph or dirr based on the ratio of the stellar rotation velocity to the velocity dispersion : @xmath55 for dsph and @xmath56 for dirr . in the model , the rotation velocity is calculated as the circular velocity at the outer - most stellar radius , as it would be measured in observation , while the velocity dispersion is estimated from the amount of external tidal heating in strong tidal interactions with other halos",
    ". such classification does not take into account the recent star formation activity or the remaining gas content , and therefore , is only a crude indication of the observationally defined morphological type .",
    "comparison of these model predictions to the data is , in fact , completely complementary to the comparison of the star formation histories .    in the process of revising our models",
    "we have discovered that the gas densities @xmath42 in @xcite were underestimated by a factor of 2 due to an error in the code .",
    "when we quote the results for the kgk04 model here , we use the corrected values .      despite significant successes in explaining the number and spatial distribution of the local group dwarfs , the kgk04 model did not predict a sufficient amount of recent star formation .",
    "figure [ fig : sfplots ] shows that 95% of the dwarfs in that model have not formed any stars in the last 1 gyr , in serious disagreement with data .    to quantify the level of this disagreement",
    ", we use the kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test for cumulative distribution functions of the following parameters : the distance to the host ( @xmath21 ) , the distances for the dsph and dirr galaxies separately ( @xmath57 and @xmath23 ) , the star formation fractions ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) , the mean age ( @xmath8 ) , and the stellar mass ( @xmath10 ) . table  [ tab : sfdata ] shows that the recent star formation fractions in the kgk04 model ( see column @xmath58 ) have very low ks probabilities , below @xmath59 . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath7 fraction , which is a more global measure of the overall star formation , is consistent with the data at the 13% level .",
    "thus the star formation law used in the model is not necessarily at fault , but the apparent lack of recent star formation is a direct result of the fixed star formation threshold , as we will see below .",
    "the mean mass - weighted age is also inconsistent with the data , but at a less significant level ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "the mean age is a global , integral measure of the sfh , which combines the low - probability recent star formation with a higher - probability early star formation .",
    "the stellar age is systematically overestimated in the model , by a few gyr .",
    "the total stellar mass is also overestimated by a factor of several for most dwarfs .",
    "the cumulative mass function is inconsistent with the data at a level similar to the age distribution , @xmath61 .",
    "note also that kgk04 considered principally the satellite dwarfs located within the virial radius of the host galaxy at @xmath62 kpc . we extend our analysis to all dwarfs in the local group , even the potentially isolated ones lying outside the virial radius of either host .",
    "figure  [ fig : radial ] shows their cumulative radial distribution out to @xmath63 kpc .",
    "the kgk04 model does well for the distribution of all dwarfs and the distribution of irr / dirr types separately .",
    "the model slightly overestimates the number of dsph / de types outside @xmath64 kpc , but in all cases the ks probability is @xmath65% or higher , fully consistent with the observations .",
    "our phenomenological model contains several parameters that allow for some freedom in the outcome .",
    "two of the most important parameters in the model are the threshold density @xmath47 and the disk size parameter , @xmath66 ( eq . [ eq : r_d ] ) , both of which are difficult to know , _ a priori _ , from theory .",
    "since these parameters can significantly change the predicted total number of dwarfs , the observed number of ( @xmath67 ) dwarfs provides a fairly stringent constraint on these values .",
    "for example , with @xmath68 and @xmath49 , the predicted average number of dwarfs per host halo within 1  @xmath2  mpc is 20.5 .",
    "if we take @xmath69 ( with @xmath49 ) this number increases to 40.7 , and if we take @xmath70 the number of dwarfs drops to 14.3 .",
    "analogously , reducing the threshold density to 4 and @xmath71 ( with @xmath68 ) increases the average number to 21.7 and 22.3 , respectively .",
    "none of these fixed threshold models , however , adequately reproduces the observed star formation histories .",
    "therefore , we look for additional physical ingredients for our model .    in our extension of the kgk04 model , we attempt to retain the correct radial distribution of the dwarf galaxies , while improving the predictions for their star formation histories .",
    "we consider a number of modifications to the kgk04 model .",
    "the most promising of the modifications is the introduction of a stochastic threshold to the star formation law .    at each output epoch",

    "locally the density is high , but the azimuthal average at a particular distance @xmath76 from the center may be either high ( if molecular clouds are common at @xmath76 ) or low ( if they are rare ) . thus , by invoking the threshold @xmath47 , we are effectively parameterizing the fraction of molecular gas available for star formation .",
    "when we take the threshold to vary , we are thus accounting for stochastic star formation in isolated hii regions , such as those found by _",
    "galex _ in nearby spirals @xcite .",
    "nearby dwarf galaxies often show a very high hi gas fraction , i.e. the ratio of gas mass to baryon ( gas+stars ) mass , up to 90% @xcite .",
    "the current star formation rates in those galaxies are low , and therefore most of the gas is inert .",
    "hydrodynamic simulations of @xcite , which treat the formation of molecular hydrogen in detail , also suggest that dwarf disks may contain large reservoirs of diffuse atomic gas that is unable to condense in molecular clouds and participate in star formation .",
    "this inefficiency of forming molecular clouds at low densities effectively results in the threshold density for star formation .",
    "figure [ fig : sfplots ] shows that the stochasticity greatly improves the agreement of the recent star formation fractions ( @xmath77 , @xmath6 ) with the local group data .",
    "the predicted distributions are much closer to the observed ones than in the kgk04 model , and are , in fact , statistically consistent with each other at @xmath78 level .",
    "we quantify this effect by gradually increasing the amount of stochasticity , @xmath79 .",
    "table  [ tab : sfdata ] shows the ks test results for @xmath79 ranging from 0.05 to 0.2 , which approximately corresponds to 10% to 60% variation in the threshold density @xmath47 .",

    ", increasing @xmath79 leads to better recent star formation parameters but worse early star formation parameters .",
    "the probability of the @xmath7 distribution decreases from 13% to under 5% for @xmath82 and even below a percent for @xmath85 .",
    "the mean age is most consistent with the data ( @xmath86 ) for @xmath82 .",
    "the total number of dwarfs also increases systematically with @xmath79 while the stellar mass function and the radial distributions are not significantly affected by the variation of @xmath79 .",
    "additionally , the @xmath87 and @xmath85 models begin to overpredict the total number of luminous dwarfs per host halo , implying that at these values the overall star formation becomes too efficient .",
    "this overabundance can be seen in table  [ tab : sfdata ] , or graphically in fig .",
    "[ fig : radial ] .",

    "figures  [ fig : sfr_gasprofile ] and [ fig : sfr_vs_sfr ] illustrate why the stochasticity is so successful .",
    "they show star formation histories and corresponding gas density profiles for two representative model dwarfs .",
    "figure  [ fig : sfr_gasprofile ] is for the case of a fixed density threshold , @xmath89 . without the stochasticity , and in the absence of radial gas flows , the gas above the threshold is steadily converted into stars at early times ( 10 and 12 gyr ago ) at substantial rates , @xmath90 . at these epochs",
    "the galaxies evolve effectively in isolation , while still growing by gas - rich hierarchical mergers . at later time ,",
    "when these galaxies become satellites of the larger host galaxy , they are tidally truncated and no new gas is accreted .",
    "after the high - density gas supply is exhausted , the rest of the gas hovers just under the threshold , unable to form new stars . in the first dwarf , shown in the top panels in figure  [ fig : sfr_gasprofile ] , star formation almost completely halts 8 gyr ago",
    "the other dwarf , shown in the bottom panels , experiences several distinct episodes of star formation , the last one finishing 3 gyr ago . in both cases there",
    "is effectively no star formation in the last 2 gyr , @xmath91 .",
    "if instead the threshold density varies in time , at later epochs the gas may find itself above the threshold and allow more recent star formation .",
    "figure  [ fig : sfr_vs_sfr ] shows the star formation histories for the same dwarfs but now with a variable threshold and using @xmath82 .",
    "there is more star formation overall and more star formation at later times . as a result , the stellar mass is higher by 20% to 30% and mean stellar age is lower by about 1 gyr . more importantly , several percent of all stars are formed in the last 2 gyr .",
    "this stochastic enhancement of the star formation rate allows the model to reproduce the star formation episodes at late times when gas - rich mergers ( which increase the available gas supply ) and strong interactions ( which can prompt starbursts ) are relatively less common .",

    "[ fig : sfr_vs_sfr ] the observed star formation histories of two dwarf galaxies , ngc 3109 and ic 1613 .",

    "there still remain discrepancies of the fiducial model with the observed data .    first , there is still not quite enough very recent star formation , a problem which is quantified by the ks - test result for @xmath4 in table  [ tab : sfdata ] ( @xmath92 ) and is apparent in fig .",

    "thus , in the fiducial model ( @xmath82 ) over 25% of the dwarfs have less than @xmath93 of their stars formed in the last 1 gyr , compared with about 10% of such dwarfs in the observed sample .",
    "note that the current observations are sensitive to sfhs with large fractions of star formation at later times .",
    "the very deep _ hst _ acs imaging of leo a by @xcite have confirmed that majority of all star formation has occurred in the last half of the age of the universe .",
    "second , the total stellar masses of the luminous dwarfs in the models tend to be significantly above the observed stellar masses of the local group dwarfs .",
    "this result is apparent for any value of @xmath79 between 0 and 0.2 ( see bottom right panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : radial ] ) .",
    "this excess stellar mass in our models can perhaps be traced to the fact that we do not include thermal and ionizing feedback from young massive stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which can disrupt molecular clouds and drive galactic outflows , thus reducing the available gas supply for star formation .",
    "third , the model does not predict enough very _ early _ star formation .",
    "this is a generic problem with any hierarchical model in which the presently - massive satellites form and accrete onto the host late and , at early times , therefore , do not contain significant amounts of gas above the threshold .",
    "our model predicts that some 20% to 30% of the dwarf galaxies will have formed greater than 85% of their stellar mass in the last 10 gyr ( i.e. @xmath94 ) . in other words",
    ", there exists in the model a number of dwarfs with anomalously young stellar populations , whereas , by contrast , the local group data in table  [ tab : sfdata_lg ] does not show any dwarfs having formed more than 86% of its stellar mass in the last 10  gyr ( the saggitarius dsph has the highest fraction )  at least 14% of all stars in the observed dwarfs formed in the first 4 gyr after the big bang . some of the simulated dwarfs with very young stellar populations include objects which form the bulk of their stars in one , punctuated star formation event caused by a close tidal interaction , prompting a starburst which happened to occur in the last 10  gyr .",

    "qualitatively , the improvement is most dramatic for @xmath4 since allowing the additional accretion of gas is more important at late times , and because the virial radius of the host halo will be larger than at earlier epochs ; also the dwarf galaxies at late times are likely to be closer in .",

    "the @xmath7-distribution lacks objects with @xmath136 , i.e. with no star formation in the first 4 gyr after the big bang .",
    "unfortunately , the time resolution of the observed sfhs does not allow us to discriminate among the three variants of the cut .",
    "but all of them provide the needed fix : the @xmath7-distribution is fully consistent with the data ( @xmath137 ) .",
    "table  [ tab : reject_lb2 ] shows that the other probabilities remain roughly the same or even decrease relative to the fiducial model .",
    "if we are to accept any of the `` reject late beginners '' variants , we would prefer the least restrictive @xmath134 gyr model .",
    "ideally , of course , we prefer to develop a better understanding of early star formation that would make this cut unnecessary .",
    "figure  [ fig : noearly_t_vs_m ] shows the stellar age as a function of stellar mass in the fiducial model and its three variants . rejecting any of the `` late beginners '' increases the stellar age by less than 1 gyr , which is significantly smaller than the dispersion of the sample at all masses .",
    "a general trend , also largely overcome by the dispersion , is for the mean age to increase with mass until @xmath138 and then to decrease at larger masses .",
    "the local group data are consistent with the younger stellar ages , and extended sfhs , for more massive galaxies . at the lowest - mass end , however , the observations show a number of very old objects that are still not present in our models , even with the strictest age cut .",
    "it is apparent from this and previous plots that our prescription for star formation in the first few gyr of cosmic time still needs improvement .",
    "it is possible that the starburst mode of star formation is causing very young stellar ages in small galaxies .",
    "we have checked , however , that the anomalously young dwarfs do not all have significant starbursts at late times and are hosted by dark matter halos with a wide range of masses .",
    "in fact , galaxies with the highest fraction of stellar mass built in starbursts are typically old , with @xmath54 between 10 and 12 gyr .",
    "starbursts are not very important overall ",
    "91% of the dwarfs have less than 10% of their stellar mass formed in the starburst mode .",
    "also , we have varied the two parameters describing the starburst mode ( the minimum required tidal force and the fraction of gas converted into stars ) and found that it has little effect on the sfh distributions .    it should also be mentioned that there does seem to be a trend , at @xmath139 , for the anomalously young dwarf halos to be more massive than the other , more typical , dwarf halos in the model  observationally speaking , these dwarfs would have higher dynamical mass - to - light ratios .",
    "interestingly , at the end of reionization these anomalous dwarfs are hosted by halos with a very wide range of masses , so that there is significant dynamical evolution from the epoch of reionization until the present day .",
    "in other words , the younger dwarfs really do have rather `` tumultuous '' lives .",

    "( [ eq : r_d ] ) , thereby allowing a larger portion of gas to participate in star formation , are not viable options since these modifications invariably overpredict the number of @xmath183 dwarfs . in other words",
    ", lowering the density threshold produces so many dwarfs that the `` missing satellites '' are no longer missing and we are once again left with the expectation that we should see in the sky @xmath184 or more luminous dwarf galaxies around the milky way , whereas we only observe @xmath185 .",
    "@xcite also reports a deficit of ultra - faint dwarfs from an independently - developed semi - analytical model of galaxy formation applied to a different collisionless @xmath1-body simulation and using the same cosmic reionization model employed here .",
    "observationally , a new interesting puzzle for our understanding of dwarf galaxy formation is presented by @xcite . in that study",
    "they observe the hi emission from leo t , the only ultrafaint dwarf with measurable gas content and recent star formation .",
    "based on the density and temperature of hi gas and velocity dispersion of stars , they find that the gas is everywhere globally jeans - stable , whereas the observed pockets of blue , 200 myr - old stars indicate continuous star formation",

    "leo t may thus present another example of stochastic star formation in a handful of isolated molecular clouds , surrounded by largely inert atomic gas .",
    "another relatively massive dwarf , canes venatici i , also shows a small fraction of relatively young ( @xmath187 gyr ) , more metal - rich stars in addition to the predominantly old ( @xmath188 gyr ) , metal - poor population @xcite .",
    "thus even the ultrafaint dwarfs may , in the future , reveal complex , extended star formation histories .",
    "we have presented phenomenological models for star formation histories of dwarf galaxies in the local group , based on the mass assembly histories in cosmological simulations and the stochastic density threshold in kennicutt - schmidt law of star formation .",
    "our main conclusions are as follows :    @xmath189 models with a stochastic star formation threshold are much more successful than non - stochastic models , such as kgk04 , in reproducing the observed star formation histories of the local group dwarfs . while the kgk04 model predicted 95% of luminous dwarfs without any recent ( @xmath190 gyr ago ) star formation , our fiducial stochastic model correctly predicts that most dwarfs form a few percent of their stellar mass at late times , in agreement with the recent star formation fraction inferred for the local group dwarfs ( see table  [ tab : sfdata_lg ] , @xmath4 column and fig .",
    "[ fig : sfplots ] ) .",
    "stochasticity allows star formation to proceed in isolated regions at late times if the threshold decreases .",
    "@xmath189 despite significant improvements of the stochastic model , a some discrepancies with the data remain .",
    "( 1 )  total stellar masses are typically too large by a factor of several .",
    "this is a generic problem of both the fixed - threshold and stochastic models presented here .",
    "( 2 )  about 10% of the dwarfs in both fixed - threshold and stochastic models have anomalously young stellar populations .",
    "these objects build the bulk of their stellar mass in the last 10  gyr , whereas all of the observed dwarfs contain at least 15% of stars",
    "older than 10  gyr .",
    "these young stellar populations in the models are not created only by tidally - induced starbursts , but rather represent late mass assembly of some of the larger satellites .",
    "@xmath189 relaxing several model assumptions does not significantly alter these predictions .",
    "we have considered the following variants of the fiducial model : allowing late gas accretion within the virial radius of the host halo ; different slopes of the star formation law ; extended epoch of reionization ; and different prescriptions for the photoevaporation of gas from low - mass halos after reionization .",
    "all of these variants predict statistically similar observables to the fiducial model .",
    "@xmath189 a variant of the fiducial model that rejects dwarfs with no star formation in the first 1 or 2 gyr after the big bang significantly improves the @xmath7 stellar fraction .",
    "even though we do not yet have an adequate justification for such a cut , this model predicts the @xmath7-distribution fully consistent with the local group data .",
    "stellar masses , however , are still overestimated .",
    "@xmath189 our fiducial model predicts only a modest population of dwarfs with @xmath191 , such as those recently discovered by sdss and the megacam survey . the predicted stellar mass function would be an underestimate if the observed numbers are extrapolated to all sky .",
    "however , our mass function is still consistent with the presently known dwarfs .",
    "our phenomenological model contains several free parameters , which allows significant freedom in the range of predicted properties of the satellite galaxies . as we discuss in  [ sec : kgk ] , a combination of the parameters , @xmath66 and @xmath72 , is well constrained by the observed number of dwarfs .",
    "other parameters of the model , apart from the stochasticity @xmath79 which strongly affects late - time star formation , lead only to small and relatively insignificant varations from the fiducial model .",
    "this analytical prescription for star formation is applied to the mass assembly histories of the halos in the cosmological @xmath1-body simulation .",
    "since we average over three host halos , our results should not depend significantly on a particular host - halo merger history .",
    "also , by construction all the massive satellite halos that become galaxies in our model survive tidal disruption in the host halo , so that their total number is predicted robustly even if their mass after tidal stripping may depend on the particulars of the simulation .    we should emphasize that our model is not a unique interpretation of the sfh data .",
    "our inferences here neccesarily depend on the assumptions of a schmidt law of star formation and an exponential profile for the gas density distribution inside dwarf halos as well as the assumptions we have made with the minimum density threshold for star formation , @xmath47 . with this latter part of the model we have found that both stochasticity in this threshold over time (  [ sec : threshold ] ) and a monotonically decreasing function (  [ sec : mono_sec ] ) can lead to extended sfhs  the feature missing from the kgk04 model .",
    "we have assumed in our model that the gas clouds moving on circular orbits should generally remain at the same distance from the galaxy center .",
    "however , during mergers and tidal interactions the angular momentum of the gas can be perturbed , leading to radial infall .",
    "such inflow of gas may bring the central gas density above the threshold in some halos soon after the big bang and lead to more early star formation .",
    "modeling this process would be very interesting , as it may provide a nice solution for the @xmath7 problem , but the complexity of such a process is beyond our simple model and requires a detailed hydrodynamic simulation .    additionally , we have not considered any gas outflows due to the radiative and thermal feedback of young stars .",
    "such processes could reduce the amount of available gas supply and the total stellar mass of the simulated dwarfs , which may lead to a closer agreement of the predicted and observed stellar mass function .",
    "however , given the uncertainty in the evolution of the gas density profile , we can not conclude that such feedback is required to reconcile the stellar masses .",
    "in fact , from figure  [ fig : lowmass_projections ] we see that in very low mass halos , where feedback is expected to be stronger , our model needs a boost , rather than a reduction , of star formation .",
    "the actual complex details of the condensation of molecular clouds in dwarf halos , which lead to the formation of stars , may turn out more important than the feedback of the stars after their formation .    in spite of these uncertainties ,",
    "the conclusion we would like to draw from our investigation is that the complex and extended sfhs of the local group dwarfs are generally consistent with the expected star formation in cold dark matter halos , and that this star formation is generally governed by the ( low ) efficiency of conversion of atomic gas into molecular clouds .",
