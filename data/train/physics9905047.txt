    "this is in contrast to the interaction with separated traveling waves@xcite or counterpropagating traveling waves applied on adjacent transitions@xcite , where to get higher harmonics one needs a number of pulses@xcite .",

    "this detection technique has the nice feature for atom interferometry experiments that the signal is not accompanied by a ( possibly large ) background due to the zeroth harmonic of the atomic density distribution .",

    "in these traces one can clearly see three different echoes , the one two - pulse and two three - pulse echoes , that fall into the selected time interval .",
    "it is interesting to notice that when the sw3 pulse is applied , the amplitude of the two - pulse echo produced by sw1 and sw2 becomes smaller .",

    "being insensitive to the energy of the atomic internal motion , the shape and the center of the ground state ramsey fringes do not depend on perturbations of the internal state .",
    "simultaneously , the accuracy of measurements is not related to any frequency of internal transitions .",
    "it allows one to increase the time of the atomic coherences evolution @xmath9 by 2 - 3 orders of magnitude@xmath268 or reduce requirements for frequency stabilization by 2 - 3 orders of magnitude .",
