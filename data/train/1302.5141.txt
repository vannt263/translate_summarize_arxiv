    "at x - ray energies , the extra - solar sky is dominated by the emission from accreting binary systems containing black holes and neutron stars . however , at higher energies ( gev to tev ) very few interacting neutron star or black hole binaries are known sources  @xcite .",
    "the relative paucity of gamma - ray binaries can be attributed to the necessity for not only a power supply , but also non - thermal mechanisms  @xcite .",
    "there are , however , evolutionary reasons to expect more gamma - ray binaries to exist  @xcite , and there are many unidentified _ fermi _ lat sources .",
    "gamma - ray binaries are expected to show orbitally - modulated gamma - ray emission due to changes in viewing angle and , in eccentric orbits , the degree of the binary interaction .",
    "periodic modulation has indeed been seen in ls 5039 ( 3.9 day period ) , ls i + 61 303 ( 26.5 days ) , cygnus x-3 ( 4.8 hours )  @xcite , and 1fgl j1018.6 - 5856 ( 16.65 days )  @xcite and emission is orbital phase dependent for psr b1259 - 63 ( 3.4 years )  @xcite . a search for periodic modulation of gamma - ray flux from _ fermi _ lat sources may thus yield further gamma - ray binaries , potentially revealing the predicted hmxb precursor population .",
    "the second _ fermi _ lat catalog of gamma - ray sources ( `` 2fgl ''  @xcite ) contains 1873 sources , many of which do not have confirmed counterparts at other wavelengths and thus are potentially gamma - ray binaries .    in order to search for modulation we regularly update 0.1 - 200 gev light curves for all 2fgl sources and calculate power spectra of these .",
    "we use aperture photometry with a 3  radius , with photons weighted by the probability that they came from the source of interest to increase the signal - to - noise level . to avoid solar gamma - ray emission , we exclude times when the sun was closer than 5to an aperture .",
    "we then calculate power spectra of all light curves to search for periodic modulation . to account for variations in exposure , each time bin s contribution to the power spectrum",
    "is weighted by its relative exposure  @xcite .",
    "from an examination of the power spectra for all sources in the 2fgl catalog , orbital modulation is strongly detected in the known gamma - ray binaries ls 5039 , ls i + 61 303 , and 1fgl j1018.6 - 5856 (= 2fgl j1019.0 - 5856 ) .",
    "artifacts near 1 day and the precession period of _ fermi _ s orbit at 53 days are also seen in the power spectra of a number of sources .",
    "in addition to these , we noted complex sets of peaks in the power spectra of 2fgl j0753.2 + 1937 and 2fgl j2356.3 + 0432 .",
    "2fgl j0753.2 + 1937 does not have an identified counterpart at other wavelengths , while 2fgl j2356.3 + 0432 is identified with the blazar mg1 j235704 + 0447  @xcite .",
    "although these two sources are widely separated on the sky , it was determined that the peaks in both sources were all harmonics of a 27.3 day period ( figure  [ fig - power ] ) . when the light curves are folded on this period , brief flares are seen in both sources ( figure  [ fig - fold ] ) .",
    "interactions of cosmic rays with the moon s surface result in the production of gamma rays .",
    "this makes the moon a rather bright source for the _ fermi _ lat with a flux above 100 mev of 10@xmath0 ph @xmath1 s@xmath2  @xcite , and it was even detectable with egret  @xcite .",
    "we note that the sun is also a gamma - ray source . although the 2fgl catalog notes sources potentially affected by solar emission , no such analysis was done for the moon  @xcite .",
    "the moon s sidereal period is 27.321 days .",
    "the sharp recurrent flares from 2fgl j0753.2 + 1937 and 2fgl j2356.3 + 0432 can be understood as due to repeated passages of the moon sufficiently close to these sources to affect the light curves .",
    "power spectra are not ideal for detecting brief flaring activity as this strongly non - sinusoidal modulation results in the power being spread over a very large number of harmonics .",
    "we investigated other period - detection techniques such as stellingwerf s phase dispersion minimization  @xcite method and others .",
    "it was found that lunar modulation was best detected by creating a modified power spectrum , similar to the z@xmath3 test  @xcite , with each point replaced with a sum of itself and up to the 10th harmonic .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig - harm ] where we show the power spectrum , and summed - harmonic power spectrum of 2fgl j0816.9 + 2049 , a source which is identified with the blazar 2fgl j0816.9 + 2049  @xcite . from harmonic - summed power spectra of the entire 2fgl catalog we detected 38 sources that suffered from significant lunar contamination ( table  [ table - sources ] ) .",
    "._fermi _ lat sources with apparent lunar contamination [ cols= \" < , > , > \" , ]",
    "fermi _ spacecraft files do not currently include lunar coordinates .",
    "one of us ( psr ) has provided a utility ( `` ` moonpos ` '' ) that uses the jpl spice toolkit  @xcite to add lunar coordinates .",
    "this is available from the _ fermi _ science support center on the user contributions web page .",
    "the addition of lunar coordinates enables filtering to exclude data obtained when the moon was close to a source via the standard analysis tool ` gtmktime ` .",
    "we find that excluding data within 8 degrees of a source removes almost all contamination .",
    "the technique of summing harmonics to reveal the presence of lunar contamination is also useful in the search for gamma - ray binaries . for example , the binary psr b1259 - 63 is only active for a brief portion of its 3.4 yr orbit  @xcite .",
    "other systems exhibiting similar repeating brief flares will be more readily detected using harmonically - summed power spectra .",
    "so far no definite non - lunar periodic flaring has been detected for any source , but the hunt continues .",
    "* lunar gamma - ray emission can significantly contaminate the light curves of lat sources near the ecliptic plane . + * lunar modulation at 27.3 days is directly detected in the power spectra of a few sources .",
    "+ * adding power - spectrum harmonics ( 10 ) reveals the 27.3 day signal in 38 2fgl sources . +",
    "* software has been developed to facilitate exclusion of lunar contaminated data .",
    "this is publicly available .",
