    "the solar magnetic field is maintained by the action of a hydromagnetic dynamo .",
    "the well - known eleven year solar activity cycle corresponds to a twenty - two year magnetic cycle , the origin of which lies deep within the solar interior ( see , for example , charbonneau 2005 ) .",
    "the key to understanding the generation of the solar magnetic field lies in establishing the form of both the large- and small - scale fluid flows in the interior .",
    "helioseismology , the study of acoustic fluctuations within the sun , has provided a map of the solar differential rotation ( schou et al .",
    "1998 ) , which shows that the surface latitudinal dependence is largely maintained throughout the convection zone while the solar interior rotates as a solid body .",
    "these two profiles are matched in a thin , stably stratified layer of strong differential rotation ( shear ) at the base of the convection zone  a region known as the tachocline .",
    "a discussion of the dynamics of the tachocline can be found in tobias ( 2005 ) and hughes , rosner & weiss ( 2007 ) .",
    "this region of pronounced shear is believed to be of paramount importance in the generation ( via the so - called @xmath0-effect ) , storage and eventual instability of a strong toroidal magnetic field .",
    "the regeneration of poloidal field from toroidal field is less well understood .",
    "it is typically ascribed to the @xmath1-effect of mean field electrodynamics , but the precise origin and location of this mechanism remain unclear .",
    "a number of possibilities have been suggested ( see the review of ossendrijver 2003 ) .",
    "the most natural is to appeal to convective turbulence in the presence of rotation ( parker 1955 ; steenbeck , krause & rdler 1966 ) .",
    "there are however some difficulties for this approach both in the linear ( cattaneo & hughes 2006 , hughes & cattaneo 2008 ) and nonlinear regimes ( see the reviews by diamond , hughes & kim 2005 ; brandenburg & subramanian 2005 ) . an alternative is to appeal to magnetic buoyancy instabilities of the tachocline field interacting with rotation ( schmitt , schssler & ferriz - mas 1996 ; thelen 2000 ; see also cline , brummell & cattaneo 2003 for a related model ) .",
    "a third possibility places the generation of poloidal field well away from the tachocline , the assumed location for the generation of toroidal field . in this paradigm",
    "( dikpati & charbonneau 1999 ; dikpati & gilman 2001 ) poloidal flux is regenerated via the decay of active regions at the solar surface ( babcock 1961 ; leighton 1969 ) . in these models",
    "meridional circulation is invoked in order to transport the new poloidal flux to the tachocline .",
    "this model too is not without difficulties ( see the review by tobias & weiss 2007 ) .    in this paper we shall consider models of dynamos operating at an interface between regions of turbulent rotating convection and velocity shear .",
    "the idea of an interface dynamo  with neighbouring regions of @xmath1- and @xmath0-effects  was introduced by parker ( 1993 ) expressly to avoid the difficulties caused by the strong suppression of turbulent magnetic diffusion by a weak mean field . in parker",
    "s model , strong toroidal field is generated in the tachocline by radial shear . there , and only there , does it suppress the diffusion , leading naturally to confinement of the toroidal field within that layer .",
    "the @xmath1-effect and a healthy turbulent diffusion operate relatively unimpeded in the bulk of the convection zone .",
    "parker suggested that provided the diffusivity is not suppressed too strongly , observed solar fluxes and the 22-year solar period could be accommodated .",
    "parker s original kinematic model has been extended into the nonlinear regime to investigate explicitly the quenching not only of the turbulent diffusion but also of the @xmath1-effect ( tobias 1996 ; charbonneau & macgregor 1997 ; markiel & thomas 1999 ) .",
    "a crucial ingredient for efficient interface dynamo action is the transport of magnetic flux between the two spatially disjoint generation regions .",
    "for this reason , dynamo action is , typically , more difficult to excite in such models than in those with spatially - coincident generation mechanisms ( parker 1993 ) . indeed ,",
    "if such a transport mechanism is absent , this places a severe constraint on the applicability of interface dynamos ( dikpati et al .",
    "2005 ) . within the sun",
    "there are however a number of possible mechanisms that could transport magnetic field .",
    "for example , convective pumping ( e.g.  drobyshevski & yuferev 1974 ) is believed to transport flux downwards from the convection zone into the tachocline ( e.g.  tobias et al .",
    "1998 , 2001 ; dorch & nordlund 2001 ) .",
    "turbulent diffusion , which is believed to act throughout the convection zone but could be significantly reduced in the tachocline ( parker 1993 ) , acts to reduce gradients in field .",
    "mean flows , such as the meridional circulation ( choudhuri et al .",
    "1995 ) , which is observed to be polewards at and just below the solar surface but is undetermined at the base of the convection zone , will act to advect mean flux .",
    "the only transport mechanism that is unambiguously directed outwards is magnetic buoyancy , which is believed to play a key role in the emergence of active regions at the surface ( see , for example , the reviews by schssler 2005 and hughes 2007 ) .",
    "these competing effects may occur on different timescales and depend on the local strength of magnetic field .",
    "indeed , the general picture we have of the solar dynamo is of the field being confined and maintained at the base of the convection zone , with occasional eruptions .    in this paper",
    "we consider the effect of incorporating non - diffusive flux transport in an interface dynamo model . in keeping with the simple yet illustrative nature of parker s original model , we include magnetic transport via an effective velocity .",
    "indeed , such a velocity arises naturally in mean field electrodynamics as the ` @xmath2-effect ' , resulting from the anti - symmetric part of the @xmath1-tensor ( rdler 1968 ) .",
    "it should be noted that mean field electrodynamics is not without problems , particularly in the high magnetic reynolds number regime applicable to the sun .",
    "nonetheless , our hope is that it is possible to capture some features of the interaction of generation , transport and diffusion of magnetic fields via a simple mean - field model .    in this paper",
    "we shall investigate the role of the @xmath2-effect on the onset of the dynamo instability for two kinematic @xmath3-dynamo models .",
    "a natural starting point is to extend parker s 1993 model , in which the interface separates two spatially unbounded regions .",
    "it is though important to consider the more realistic case of vertically bounded domains , which is the aim of our second model . in  2 we discuss those characteristics that are common to both models .",
    "the effect of introducing flux transport is investigated , for the two models , in  3 and  4 .",
    "the possible implications for an interface dynamo in the sun are discussed in  5 .",
    "we consider the role of flux transport for two models of kinematic , @xmath3-interface dynamos in a local cartesian geometry ( see figure  [ fig : geometry ] ) .",
    "the region @xmath4 represents the convection zone ( although there is no convection as such in our framework ) , wherein the @xmath1-effect generates the poloidal field and there is no @xmath0-effect .",
    "the region @xmath5 models the tachocline , where the radial shear regenerates the toroidal field ( the @xmath0-effect ) and @xmath6 .",
    "the assumption of axisymmetry translates to solutions that are independent of the azimuthal direction , @xmath7 say , and we shall consider fields that are periodic in @xmath8 .",
    "the induction equation for the mean field @xmath9 takes the form ( see , for example , moffatt 1978 ) @xmath10 where @xmath11 represents the mean flow , @xmath12 is the molecular magnetic diffusivity , and @xmath13 is the mean electromotive force , which takes the form @xmath14 for simplicity we shall consider the effects of anisotropy only in the @xmath15 tensor , which we assume to take the form @xmath16 .",
    "we assume that @xmath17 ; @xmath18 is then a turbulent magnetic diffusivity .",
    "equation ( [ eq : mf3 ] ) now becomes @xmath19 in which @xmath20 .",
    "we shall consider models in which @xmath21 may take different constant values in @xmath4 and @xmath5 ; thus , for the purpose of deriving the jump relations below , we do not take @xmath21 outside the derivative in the above equation .",
    "the large - scale velocity @xmath11 is chosen to represent the radial shear of the tachocline .",
    "the effective velocity @xmath22 describes the radial non - diffusive transport of magnetic flux between the two layers .",
    "we therefore take @xmath23 where @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the heaviside function . here",
    "@xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are constants .",
    "we may think of the situation in which @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) as the case in which magnetic pumping is the prevailing transport mechanism leading to a net transport radially inwards , while the case in which the dominant transport effect is by magnetic buoyancy ( and hence directed radially outwards ) is modelled by @xmath32 .",
    "as the system is axisymmetric ( @xmath7-independent ) , it is useful to decompose the field into poloidal and toroidal parts , @xmath33 .",
    "we proceed with the convention that subscripts @xmath34 and @xmath35 refer to quantities in @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively . assuming that the shear is much stronger than the @xmath1-effect in generating the toroidal field ( the @xmath3-approximation ) , it follows from equation ( [ eq : mf2 ] ) that in @xmath4 the governing equations are @xmath36 while in @xmath5 we have @xmath37 in both regions we seek wave - like solutions of the form @xmath38 , \\qquad b=\\re[b(z)e^{pt+\\textrm{i}kx } ] , \\ ] ] where @xmath39 ( @xmath40 , @xmath41 ) , @xmath42 is the wavenumber ( @xmath43 ) , and @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the ( complex ) amplitudes of the dynamo waves .",
    "temporally growing solutions ( @xmath46 ) , with period @xmath47 , propagate equatorwards when @xmath48 and towards the north pole when @xmath49 . both @xmath50 and @xmath51 are continuous .",
    "the solutions are matched at the interface @xmath52 by the jump conditions ( derived by integrating equation ( [ eq : mf2 ] ) across the interface ) @xmath53_0=0,\\qquad",
    "\\big[\\eta \\frac{{\\partial}{b}}{{\\partial}{z}}- \\gamma b \\big]_{0}=0,\\ ] ] where @xmath54_0 $ ] denotes the jump in the specified quantity across @xmath52 .",
    "applying the boundary conditions in @xmath55 , which will be described later , leads to a dispersion relation connecting the growth rate and wavenumber to the non - dimensional dynamo number ( @xmath56 , say ) , which measures the relative strength of induction to diffusion .",
    "as the definition of @xmath56 differs between the two models , we postpone its definition to the later sections .    to set the scene we now describe the spatial form of the transport mechanisms that we implement . as already described , the efficiency of an interface dynamo is crucially reliant on flux transport between the two generation layers . in parker s model transport is solely by diffusion , with , in the simplest case , @xmath57 .",
    "the intention of parker s model was to show how a strong field could be confined to a thin layer beneath the convection zone owing to that field suppressing the effective diffusion , leading to @xmath58 .",
    "we shall therefore investigate the role of the @xmath2-effect in models with uniform diffusion ( @xmath57 ) and in those with @xmath59 .",
    "we will consider the following illustrative cases :    * * bidirectional transport with uniform diffusion * + we consider first the case in which @xmath60 with @xmath61 , modelling pumping in @xmath4 and magnetic buoyancy in @xmath5 .",
    "for simplicity we take @xmath57 . although one might expect stronger transport to increase the efficiency of the dynamo",
    ", we will show that this is not necessarily the case .",
    "we will then compare these results with the situation @xmath62 , which represents flux transport away from the interface in both generation layers and hence may naively be expected to yield the least efficient dynamo .",
    "* * unidirectional transport with uniform diffusion * + next we consider @xmath63 and @xmath57",
    ". we may think of @xmath61 as the typical solar case in which transport inwards by convective overshoot is expected to dominate the buoyant rise of magnetic field . *",
    "* dominant transport in the convection zone * + here we assume that the net transport is much stronger in @xmath4 and that effects due to magnetic buoyancy in @xmath4 are small in comparison with convective transport .",
    "we therefore consider @xmath64 and investigate the effects of increasing the magnitude of @xmath65 .",
    "this is motivated by what is believed to be the case at the base of the solar convection zone .",
    "we compare the case @xmath66 with the more relevant case @xmath58 .    for chosen values of the @xmath2-effect and diffusion coefficients ,",
    "the dispersion relation is solved to yield a critical dynamo number @xmath67 and corresponding critical frequency @xmath68 as functions of the wavenumber .",
    "dynamo action sets in for @xmath69 $ ] , with preferred wavenumber @xmath70 and corresponding frequency @xmath71 .",
    "we shall say that transport hinders dynamo action if increasing the magnitude of @xmath2 increases the critical dynamo number @xmath72 , while if @xmath72 is somewhere a decreasing function of @xmath2 then transport aids the dynamo instability . the effect of transport on the period of the dynamo wave ( @xmath73 ) , reflecting the time taken to reverse the sign of the magnetic field , will also be investigated , as will its role in modifying the spatial profile of the magnetic field .",
    "finally , it is also of interest to consider the effect of transport on the phase relation between the radial and azimuthal fields .",
    "observations indicate that @xmath74 at active latitudes , i.e.  the two components have a phase shift @xmath75 ( see , for example , stix 1976 ; yoshimura 1976 ; schlichenmaier & stix 1995 ) .",
    "this phase difference has traditionally been difficult to reproduce with the simplest @xmath3-dynamo models that rely upon diffusive communication : given the sign of @xmath76 from helioseismology , the sign of @xmath1 required for equatorward migration ( @xmath77 in the northern hemisphere , @xmath78 in the southern ) generates poloidal field whose sign is inconsistent with the above phase relation ( see parker 1987 ; schssler 2005 ) .",
    "it is therefore of interest to investigate whether more complex @xmath3-models can reproduce the observed behaviour .",
    "we note that a non - zero phase difference is inherent in the dynamo equations , even for models with spatially coincident generation regions ( see parker 1955 , for example ) . for our dynamo models",
    ", the phase difference will be found by examination of the temporal profiles of the azimuthal and radial fields .",
    "for example , at @xmath79 we find @xmath80 \\sim \\cos\\left(\\frac{2 \\pi t}{t}\\right ) , \\qquad \\re\\left[\\frac{\\partial a(t)}{\\partial x}\\right]\\sim   \\cos\\left(\\frac{2 \\pi t}{t}+\\phi\\right ) , \\ ] ] where @xmath81 is the phase difference .",
    "it is important also to note that the observational evidence for the phase lag arises from the behaviour of the two components of field at the solar surface . since the toroidal field is created in the tachocline at approximately @xmath82 and is subject to complex processes operating throughout the bulk of the convection zone during its rise to the surface , the phase lag is likely to vary with depth . in this investigation",
    "we choose to evaluate @xmath81 at the interface of the convection zone and tachocline ( @xmath52 ) . for the model of infinite extent in @xmath55 ( model  i ) this",
    "is done owing to the lack of any other preferred location , whereas in the vertically bounded model ( model  ii ) this is done to minimise the role of boundary conditions .    before turning to the details of the models ,",
    "it is interesting to note a common characteristic of both models . as can be observed directly from equations ( [ eq : dynamo_z>0 ] ) and",
    "( [ eq : dynamo_z<0 ] ) , in the large wavenumber limit the evolution is governed by the diffusive term .",
    "thus @xmath83 as @xmath84 .",
    "furthermore , since in this limit the critical dynamo number and corresponding frequency are independent of the magnitude of the transport mechanism , all the stability curves for different magnitudes of @xmath85 and @xmath29 collapse onto that for @xmath86 .",
    "in this section we solve the dynamo equations ( [ eq : dynamo_z>0 ] ) and ( [ eq : dynamo_z<0 ] ) in a domain that is unbounded in the @xmath55-direction ( see figure  [ fig : geometry]a ) , with boundary conditions @xmath87 since neither the shear nor the @xmath1-effect alone can sustain dynamo action .",
    "following parker ( 1993 ) , we seek solutions of the form ( [ eq : solns ] ) with @xmath88 } , \\qquad a_{1}(z)=(f+ez)\\exp{[-(s+\\textrm{i}q)z ] } \\quad \\textrm { in } z>0,\\ ] ] and @xmath89 } , \\qquad b_{2}(z)=(l+mz)\\exp{[(s+\\textrm{i}q)z ] } \\quad \\textrm { in } z<0.\\ ] ] here @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath40 , @xmath95 are real constants , while we allow @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 to be complex . since",
    "our analysis is linear , there exists one arbitrary amplitude , which we take as @xmath90 .",
    "the boundary conditions ( [ eq : bconds ] ) require that @xmath101 and @xmath102 . applying continuity and the jump relations ( [ eq : jump ] )",
    "then leads to the relation ( see appendix  a ) @xmath103\\left[(s+\\textrm{i}q)+\\mu^2(s+\\textrm{i}q ) + \\frac{(\\gamma_{1}-\\gamma_{2})}{\\eta_{1}}\\right ] \\left[2(s+\\textrm{i}q ) + \\frac{\\gamma_{1}}{\\eta_{1}}\\right]\\left[2(s+\\textrm{i}q)-\\frac{\\gamma_{2}}{\\eta_{2}}\\right]= \\textrm{i}k^4 \\left(\\frac{\\alpha g}{\\eta_1 ^ 2 k^3}\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath104 and @xmath105 . in order to satisfy the conditions at infinity , the signs in expressions ( [ eq : sigom ] ) are to be chosen so that @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "the term in parentheses on the right - hand side of equation ( [ eq : m2disp ] ) is a dimensionless measure of the relative strength of induction to diffusion and is defined as the dynamo number for this problem , i.e.  @xmath106 . without loss of generality , we take @xmath107 .",
    "there exist similar solutions for @xmath108 but they propagate in the opposite direction .",
    "note that , owing to the lack of any physical length scale in this problem , the dynamo number is here defined in terms of the wavenumber @xmath42 ( e.g.  parker 1955 ) .",
    "thus when we consider the effects of transport on the onset of the dynamo instability as a function of wavenumber we consider the dependence of @xmath2 on @xmath109 .",
    "we note that in the absence of the @xmath2-effect the model reduces to that of parker ( 1993 ) . in the case of uniform diffusion , ( @xmath57 ) equations ( [ eq : m2disp ] ) and ( [ eq : sigom ] ) then yield @xmath110 in what follows we take the @xmath111 , @xmath112 solutions as our starting point when considering the effects of non - zero transport ; i.e. , as the magnitude of @xmath2 increases , our solutions are smoothly linked to expressions ( [ eq : parker_mu1 ] ) with the positive signs . as discussed earlier , we split the general case into the following subcases .",
    "we begin with the case @xmath60 and @xmath113 . relations ( [ eq : m2disp ] ) and ( [ eq : sigom ] ) then yield @xmath114 it is clear that increasing @xmath2 increases both @xmath115 and @xmath68 .",
    "thus transport hinders the onset of the dynamo instability and decreases the time taken to reverse the field polarity . furthermore ,",
    "both relations are independent of the sign of @xmath2 .",
    "thus , although one may expect the dynamo properties of the two cases @xmath61 and @xmath62 , representing flux transport towards and away from the interface in both domains , respectively , to be very different , the critical parameters governing the onset of dynamo action are not affected by the direction of flux transport .",
    "we believe this unusual property to be a consequence of the infinite extent of the model .",
    "it is noted that the parameters governing the @xmath55-structure of the solution are sensitive to the sign of the @xmath2-effect , _ viz .",
    "_ @xmath116 . as a consequence ,",
    "the dependence on @xmath2 of the phase difference between the azimuthal and radial fields is different for positive and negative @xmath2 , as shown in figures  [ fig : parker_g_up_down](a , b ) . in the case",
    "when transport is directed towards the interface ( @xmath61 ) , the phase lag is increased as @xmath117 increases , while transport away from the interface ( @xmath62 ) brings the two components of field more in phase .",
    "the structure of the azimuthal and radial fields is illustrated in figures  [ fig : parker_g_up_down](c , d ) .",
    "as expected , the eigenfunctions are narrower ( wider ) when transport is towards ( away from ) the interface .      given that flux transport towards the interface hinders the excitation of the dynamo instability in exactly the same manner as does transport away from the interface , it appears intuitively unlikely that a unidirectional @xmath2-effect operating throughout the domain will enhance the efficiency of dynamo action .",
    "indeed , in the case @xmath63 and @xmath113 , analytic investigations yield @xmath118 the dynamo is most easily excited at @xmath119 , where @xmath120 .",
    "thus transport again hinders the onset of the dynamo instability .",
    "the frequency increases with increasing magnitude of the transport , and the dynamo prefers to generate waves with ever decreasing wavelength ( @xmath121 ) .",
    "it may also be shown analytically that at @xmath52 increasing the magnitude or changing the direction of the transport has no effect on the phase difference between the toroidal and radial fields , as @xmath122 always . furthermore , since the phase relation remains constant even though the critical parameter governing the onset of dynamo action can increase dramatically , the phase lag is not a property that controls the efficiency of dynamo action in the regime studied here .    figure  [ fig : m2_efns ] compares the structure of the azimuthal and radial fields for unidirectional transport directed downwards with that for upwards transport .",
    "downwards transport reduces the decay length of the fields in @xmath4 , while upwards transport reduces the decay length in @xmath5 .",
    "we now consider the effects of removing the @xmath2-effect from @xmath5 . in these cases",
    "the toroidal field generated in the shear layer will rely upon diffusion to transport it into @xmath4 , where it will act as a source for poloidal field regeneration .",
    "figures  [ fig : m2_g20_mu1](a , b ) illustrate the marginal stability curves for the case @xmath65 , @xmath64 and @xmath123 . for small wavenumbers",
    "@xmath124^{1/3 } k^{1/3 } , \\qquad   \\omega_c \\approx \\left[\\frac{\\eta \\gamma_1 ^ 2}{2}\\right]^{1/3 } k^{4/3 } , \\quad \\textrm{as } k \\rightarrow 0,\\ ] ] which may be compared with ( [ eq : parker_mu1 ] ) for the case of @xmath125 .",
    "thus , again , transport hinders the onset of dynamo action and increases the frequency of the dynamo waves .",
    "it is interesting to note that in comparison with the uniform transport case of  [ sec : parker_eqge ] , the removal of the @xmath2-effect from @xmath5 results in a phase difference that is dependent on the magnitude of @xmath28 [ figure  [ fig : m2_g20_mu1](c ) ] . in this case increasing @xmath28 increases the phase difference .",
    "the ratio of the phase difference to the period of the wave also increases [ figure  [ fig : m2_g20_mu1](d ) ] .",
    "the eigenfunctions , shown in figures  [ fig : m2_g20_mu1](e , f ) , exhibit similar behaviour to the case of a unidirectional transport , with the fields being distorted towards the interface from above ( the direction in which the transport operates ) .",
    "the marginal stability curves for the case @xmath65 , @xmath64 , @xmath126 and @xmath127 are shown in figures  [ fig : m2_g20_mus](a , b ) . again",
    "transport hinders the operation of the dynamo and decreases the period of the dynamo wave .",
    "the phase difference between the radial and azimuthal fields behaves in a qualitatively similar manner to the cases investigated above in which the @xmath2-effect is directed downwards , with both @xmath81 and @xmath128 increasing as the magnitude of @xmath28 increases [ figures  [ fig : m2_g20_mus](c , d ) ] .",
    "the behaviour of the eigenfunctions appears to be such that the downwards - directed transport reduces the decay lengths in @xmath4 [ figures  [ fig : m2_g20_mus](e , f ) ] .    comparing these results with the uniform diffusion case described above (  [ sec : m2_mu1g20 ] )",
    ", one finds that in the absence of @xmath28 the dynamo is easier to excite in the case of uniform diffusion than for @xmath129 , for those wavenumbers considered .",
    "indeed , in the limit @xmath130 , parker ( 1993 ) , in the absence of transport , derived the relations @xmath131 while for @xmath132 we have expressions ( [ eq : parker_mu1 ] ) .",
    "clearly , in the absence of non - diffusive transport , @xmath133 yields a greater critical dynamo number and a smaller frequency than for the case of uniform diffusion .",
    "however , our results reveal that for finite @xmath28 the situation is reversed at a certain wavenumber , @xmath134 , say . for wavenumbers less than @xmath135",
    "the dynamo is easier to excite in the case with smaller @xmath136 , while for @xmath137 dynamo action occurs for smaller values of @xmath138 in the case with uniform diffusion .",
    "this can be seen by comparing figures [ fig : m2_g20_mu1](a ) and [ fig :",
    "m2_g20_mus](a ) for the case @xmath139 , where @xmath140 . for those @xmath28 considered ,",
    "the frequencies are larger in the case of uniform diffusion than they are for @xmath127 .",
    "however , it should be noted that for different spatial profiles of @xmath2 it is not always the case that uniform diffusion results in a larger frequency ( for example , compare the frequencies in figure  [ fig : m2_eqg_eta2](b ) for @xmath141 and @xmath127 in the case of @xmath142 ) .",
    "finally , inspection of the eigenfunctions shows that the reduced @xmath136 results in a smaller vertical length scale for the toroidal field in @xmath5 , as expected ( parker 1993 ; tobias 1996 ) .",
    "it is instructive to consider the effect of varying the diffusivity in @xmath5 in the absence of the @xmath2-effect and to compare the results with the corresponding situation when @xmath2 is non - zero .",
    "we consider a fixed value of the wavenumber , here chosen to be @xmath143 , and we take @xmath63 for simplicity .",
    "figure  [ fig : m2_eqg_eta2](a ) illustrates that in both cases the effect on @xmath144 of varying @xmath136 is non - monotonic .",
    "decreasing @xmath136 from unity initially allows a more effective production of toroidal field in @xmath5 and thus the dynamo becomes easier to excite .",
    "however , there exists a transition point ( @xmath145 , say ) after which decreasing the diffusion hampers the coupling between the two regions sufficiently that the onset of dynamo action is delayed .",
    "figure  [ fig : m2_eqg_eta2](b ) illustrates that when the @xmath2-effect is absent the frequency decreases monotonically as @xmath136 decreases , while when @xmath146 there are two distinct regimes .",
    "the first is when @xmath147 , in which the frequency of the wave is governed by diffusive transport between the layers . here",
    "the frequency decreases as @xmath136 decreases .",
    "the second regime begins when @xmath148 becomes comparable with @xmath2 , and the frequency is then controlled both by diffusion and the @xmath2-effect . as @xmath136 is decreased further there is an increase in the frequency of the dynamo wave until @xmath68 eventually saturates at a constant value . in the final state",
    "the frequency of the wave is governed by the @xmath2-effect .",
    "figure  [ fig : m2_eqg_eta2](c ) shows that the phase difference between the toroidal and radial fields is also governed both by diffusion and the @xmath2-effect .",
    "the phase difference is typically a non - monotonic function of the diffusion , even for the case @xmath125 .",

    "figures  [ fig : m3_gud_mu1](c , d ) illustrate the effect of transport on the phase difference between the azimuthal and radial fields , and on the ratio of the phase difference and the period of the wave . for comparison , also presented is the case when transport acts away from the interface in both regions . transporting flux towards the interface",
    "causes the two components of field to become more out of phase whereas when @xmath171 is directed away from the interface the phase difference decreases , in agreement with model  i.    conveying magnetic flux towards the interface favours field generation there , causing both the toroidal and poloidal fields to become increasingly localised around @xmath52 [ figures  [ fig : m3_gud_mu1](e , f ) ] . in the contrasting situation of flux transport away from the interface ( @xmath169 ) the main effect is to cause the peak in toroidal magnetic field to move towards the lower boundary ( behaviour that is qualitatively similar to that shown in figure  [ fig : m3_eqg_mu1](e ) for uniform downwards transport ) , whereas there is little change in the @xmath55-structure of the poloidal field .",

    "since at large wavenumbers the marginal stability profiles must approach the results ( [ eq : m3_eqgeqn_lk ] ) for model  i , it follows that for those @xmath176 there exists a preferred wavelength for the dynamo instability ( for example , @xmath181 for @xmath182 ) .",
    "figures  [ fig : m3_eqg_mu1](a , b ) illustrate that transport hinders the excitation of the dynamo and decreases the period of the wave .",
    "the phase difference between the azimuthal and radial fields follows a non - monotonic behaviour as the magnitude of @xmath171 is increased , and is dependent upon the direction of flux transport [ figures  [ fig : m3_eqg_mu1](c , d ) ] .",

    "interestingly , increasing the magnitude of the transport results in the majority of the poloidal field residing in @xmath5 , even though it is generated in @xmath4 .",
    "we now consider the case motivated by the sun , in which the downwards pumping of the convection is much stronger in @xmath4 than in @xmath5 .",
    "we take @xmath186 and @xmath187 and consider the effects of increasing @xmath188 . flux transport in the tachocline region is then controlled only by diffusion .",
    "we first consider the case of uniform diffusion , @xmath113 .",
    "figures  [ fig : m3_g20_mu1](a , b ) show that there is a magnitude of the transport ( @xmath189 , say ) for which there is a qualitative change in the behaviour of the solution at small wavenumbers .",
    "this behaviour is similar to the case of a unidirectional @xmath2-effect ( see   [ section : parkerbddeqneqg ] ) although here the results are dependent on the direction of flux transport . for @xmath179 and @xmath187",
    "we have @xmath190 . for @xmath191",
    "the most readily destabilised mode satisfies @xmath192 and @xmath193 for @xmath162 , while for @xmath194 and @xmath162 we have @xmath195 and @xmath196 . most notably however , and in contrast to all previous calculations , it is found that the minimum of @xmath67 over all wavenumbers as a function of the transport speed @xmath197 possesses a stationary value .",
    "thus there exists a preferred magnitude of transport for which dynamo action is most efficient . for @xmath179",
    "the transport that leads to the most efficient dynamo is @xmath198 , where @xmath199 .",
    "we shall return to this point in  [ section : efficient ] [ see also figure  [ fig : m3_mindc](c ) ] .    the effect of the transport mechanism on the phase relation between the radial and azimuthal fields is illustrated in figures  [ fig : m3_g20_mu1](c , d ) .",
    "the monotonically increasing behaviour with @xmath188 is similar to that for the same case in model  i ( cf .  figures  [ fig : m2_g20_mu1](c , d ) ) .",
    "figures  [ fig : m3_g20_mu1](e , f ) illustrate the structure of the poloidal and toroidal fields as the transition from transport enhancing to hindering the dynamo occurs .",
    "although it is difficult to infer from the eigenfunctions alone why a small magnitude of transport helps the dynamo ( there appears to be little difference in the spatial profile of the solutions in the cases @xmath200 ) , it is interesting to note that in the case when the transport exceeds the preferred magnitude the majority of both the toroidal and poloidal fields resides in @xmath5 .",
    "this behaviour is suggestive that @xmath201 corresponds to the strength below which the main effect is to enhance the downwards transport of flux into the tachocline , more readily feeding the @xmath0-effect and leading to more efficient dynamo action , whereas above @xmath201 the diffusive transport of toroidal field into the convection zone is hindered significantly , thus inhibiting the operation of the @xmath1-effect and making the dynamo cycle more difficult to complete .",
    "interestingly , the behaviour of the fields in @xmath4 bears some similarity to the case of a uniform downwards transport throughout the domain [ cf .",
    "figures  [ fig : m3_eqg_mu1](c , d ) ] .",
    "thus the reason that the dynamo is more difficult to excite in the case of uniform transport ( the minima of @xmath67 over all @xmath42 in figure  [ fig : m3_eqg_mu1](a ) are greater than those in figure  [ fig : m3_g20_mu1](a ) ) is likely to be due to the behaviour in @xmath5 : when @xmath202 is finite the toroidal field is translated towards the lower boundary where it is annihilated .",
    "we now consider the case in which the the diffusivity in @xmath5 is much smaller than that in @xmath4 .",
    "we take @xmath126 , @xmath127 and compare the results with the uniform diffusion case above (  [ section : parkerbddg20eqn ] ) .",
    "the profiles of the critical dynamo number and corresponding frequency are shown in figures  [ fig : m3solar](a , b ) .    at large values of the wavenumber the profiles collapse onto those for @xmath203 .",
    "indeed , for @xmath160 and @xmath133 the critical dynamo number and frequency are given by the relations  ( [ eq : m2_g0smu_dcwc ] ) ( parker 1993 ) .",
    "the numerical results show that for @xmath162 , @xmath204 and @xmath205 , where the coefficients @xmath168 and @xmath170 are non - monotonic in @xmath197 .",
    "thus again a preferred magnitude of transport , @xmath201 , exists for which the dynamo is most easily excited . for @xmath127 and @xmath187 , @xmath206",
    "[ see also figure  [ fig : m3_mindc](d ) ] .",
    "it is noted that when transport is absent the dynamo is easier to excite when @xmath141 than when @xmath127 ; however a comparison of the preferred strengths in the two cases ( i.e.  @xmath207 compared with @xmath208 ) shows that the stronger @xmath2-effect and smaller diffusivity ratio results in a more efficient dynamo .",
    "the effect of transport on the phase relation between the radial and azimuthal fields , and also the ratio of the phase lag to the period of the wave , is shown in figures  [ fig : m3solar](c , d ) .",
    "the behaviour is qualitatively similar to that for the case of uniform diffusion with @xmath186 ( cf .",
    "figures  [ fig : m3_g20_mu1](c , d ) ) .",
    "figures  [ fig : m3solar](e , f ) illustrate the effect on the eigenfunctions of increasing the transport in @xmath4 . the structure of the toroidal field is affected only weakly , whereas the poloidal field becomes more localised around the interface , the effect being particularly pronounced in @xmath4 .      finally , to summarise the findings for this model and to compare the efficiency of the four cases considered , figures  [ fig : m3_mindc](a - d ) present the minimum value of the critical dynamo number over all wavenumbers as a function of the @xmath2-effect for each case .",
    "figure  [ fig : m3_mindc](a ) illustrates the most efficient dynamo model in which the @xmath2-effect is directed towards the interface from both above and below .",
    "increasing the strength of the @xmath2-effect in this case monotonically decreases the threshold for the dynamo instability .",
    "figure  [ fig : m3_mindc](b ) illustrates the least efficient dynamo model . in this case a uniform transport mechanism operating throughout the domain hinders dynamo action , with the minimum critical dynamo number increasing monotonically with increasing strength of the @xmath2-effect .",
    "figures  [ fig : m3_mindc](c , d ) illustrate the cases when the non - diffusive transport is restricted to operate only in @xmath4 , with uniform diffusion in the former and a reduced diffusion in @xmath5 in the latter . in both of these cases there",
    "exists a preferred magnitude of the @xmath2-effect for which dynamo action is most efficient .",
    "we have considered the role of anisotropic transport on the efficiency of an interface dynamo in the linear regime , and its effect in modifying the temporal structure of the solution , through the frequency of the dynamo wave and the phase relation between the radial and azimuthal fields .",
    "one of the main findings of the investigation is that the conclusions to be drawn depend crucially upon the geometry of the model .",
    "the first model considered was of infinite vertical extent . in the absence of transport , the preferred wavenumber for the onset of the dynamo instability is @xmath209 , where the critical parameter @xmath210 .",
    "although , clearly , this can not be decreased by incorporating the @xmath2-effect , for all forms of transport investigated it is found that @xmath211 $ ] increases as the magnitude of the transport increases .",
    "thus dynamo action is less readily achieved .",
    "also , the period of the dynamo wave decreases as the magnitude of the @xmath2-effect increases .",
    "thus although the dynamo is more difficult to excite , it more quickly reverses the polarity of the field .",
    "perhaps most noteworthy is that for this model the two cases of the @xmath2-effect directed towards the interface from both above and below and of the transport directed away from the interface in both regions have identical critical dynamo numbers and corresponding frequencies (  [ sec : m2_bidirectional ] ) .    the effect of the transport mechanism in the more realistic model  ii is more complex .",
    "the model geometry is the same as that of model  i except that the domain of the problem is bounded in the vertical direction .",
    "here it is found that a uniform transport velocity throughout the convection zone and tachocline delays the onset of the dynamo instability and increases the frequency of the dynamo waves .",
    "however , transport directed towards the interface in both @xmath4 and @xmath5 decreases both the critical dynamo number and the frequency .",
    "thus transport aids the onset of the instability in this case , although it then takes longer to reverse the field polarity . restricting the transport mechanism to the convection zone reveals a preferred strength for dynamo action .",
    "it is of interest to relate our studies to previous investigations of the effects of transport on dynamo models .",

    "brandenburg et al .",
    "( 1993 ) illustrated that a galactic wind can enhance the instability by transporting field into regions of stronger generation , while turbulent diamagnetism can act to oppose this effect and hence hinder dynamo action .",
    "similarly , gabov et al .",
    "( 1996 ) illustrated that the critical dynamo number is larger when the effects of turbulent diamagnetism are present .",
    "this was attributed , in part , to an increase in the effective diffusion coefficient .",
    "it was then shown that the effective dynamo number @xmath213 ( where @xmath214 is the mean value of the turbulent diffusion coefficient ) decreases as @xmath214 is increased .",
    "it was further illustrated that for highly supercritical dynamo numbers the linear growth rate is larger when turbulent diamagnetism is present than in its absence . in our study",
    "we have concentrated on the effects of transport on marginally stable solutions .",
    "nightingale ( 1983 ) incorporated the @xmath2-effect into a spherical @xmath215-dynamo model and found that the dynamo growth rate is smaller when @xmath2 is non - zero than when there is no transport .",
    "rdler ( 1986 ) considered spherical @xmath3- and @xmath215-dynamos and showed that although radial transport mainly hinders dynamo action , certain strengths of @xmath2 can promote the instability .",
    "finally , we remark that interface dynamo models relying purely upon diffusive communication are sometimes rejected owing to their inability to reproduce either the observed direction of propagation of the dynamo belts ( exemplified in the butterfly diagram ) or the observed phase relation between the radial and azimuthal fields . in this regard",
    ", it is of interest to note that the study by brandenburg et al .",
    "( 1992 ) showed that a sufficiently strong downward pumping can lead to an equatorward migration of the magnetic field even when the conventional rule for the sign of @xmath216 yields a poleward migration . also , here we have shown that the transport mechanism changes the ratio of the phase difference to the period of the dynamo wave .",

    "<S> the operation of an interface dynamo ( as has been suggested for the sun and other stars with convective envelopes ) relies crucially upon the effective transport of magnetic flux between two spatially disjoint generation regions . in the simplest models communication between the two regions </S>",
    "<S> is achieved solely by diffusion . here </S>",
    "<S> we incorporate a highly simplified anisotropic transport mechanism in order to model the net effect of flux conveyance by magnetic pumping and by magnetic buoyancy . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the influence of this mechanism on the efficiency of kinematic dynamo action . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the effect of flux transport on the efficiency of the dynamo is dependent upon the spatial profile of the transport . </S>",
    "<S> typically , transport hinders the onset of dynamo action and increases the frequency of the dynamo waves . </S>",
    "<S> however , in certain cases there exists a preferred magnitude of transport for which dynamo action is most efficient . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we demonstrate the importance of the imposition of boundary conditions in drawing conclusions on the role of transport .    </S>",
