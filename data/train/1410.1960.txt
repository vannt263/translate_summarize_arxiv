    "cmes are the most important space weather - relevant events on the sun , in close association with solar flares and prominence eruptions .",
    "the three eruptive phenomena are hence suggested to be different manifestations of a single physical process , which involves the large - scale disruption and restructuring of the coronal magnetic field @xcite .",
    "most often cmes are studied at high altitudes using coronagraphs @xcite , although their formation and initiation take place in low corona .",
    "the reason is twofold : on one hand , the cme progenitor is often hardly discernible in the traditional euv passbands ( e.g. , 171 and 195   ) without the presence of a dense prominence ; on the other , the observational coverage of low corona , in terms of cadence , resolution , and temperature discrimination ability , has not been sufficient to capture in detail the early impulsive acceleration of cmes , until the introduction of the solar dynamic observatory ( sdo ; * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite concluded from a study of two cmes that the hot channel serves as a continuous driver in the early acceleration phase since it rises earlier , and at a faster speed , than the cme leading front in low corona .",

    ", we report on a cme associated with an x - class flare , which has a double hot channel forming in the core of the cme during the early phase . in the sections that follows ,",
    "we study in detail the initiation and the early evolution of the cme in low corona and its relation to coronal waves and oscillations ( section 2 ) ; we then highlight the unique features that are uncovered by the high - cadence , high - resolution data ( section 3 ) .",
    "the cme s subsequent evolution in high corona and propagation in interplanetary space as well as its impact on space weather will be covered in a separate study .",

    "the reverse s - shaped dimming and its subsequent evolution into a rising hot arch in aia 94   is reminiscent of the transformation from an s - shaped loop into arch - shaped at the onset of the sigmoidal eruption studied by @xcite .",
    "we speculate that the interpretation of the s - shaped loop as a flux rope formed prior to the eruption also applies to the present case .",
    "the cme undergoes an extremely fast acceleration during the nonthermal phase , up to 35 km  s@xmath1 in low corona , which is two orders of magnitude larger than the gravitational acceleration on the solar surface , and to our knowledge is the fastest cme acceleration recorded in the literature so far .",

    "could be smoothed out with low cadence measurements . in our case ,",
    "the high value of acceleration is measured close to the peak of nonthermal hxrs , hence is expected to decrease soon .",

    "on the other hand , despite that the cme `` under - expands '' laterally in low corona , displaying a slightly increasing aspect ratio @xmath2 with time , both a global and a local euv wave are detected in the present case (  [ ss - wave ] ) .",
    "this is in contrast to the recorded lateral `` overexpansion '' in several studies involving euv waves ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in which a temporary decrease in the aspect ratio is suggested to be the potential trigger of the waves .",
    "it is difficult to determine exactly when the global euv wave initiates , but one knows for sure that it must be excited earlier than the onset of the plume oscillation at about 01:36 ut .",
    "it would take about 6 minutes for the wavefront to travel from the edge of the loop system ( p - angle @xmath38 deg ) to the plumes ( p - angle @xmath39 deg ) at @xmath0600 km  s@xmath14 , as suggested by the type ii burst .",
    "this corresponds well with the time that the expanding loop system starts to push downward the neighboring loops ( bottom panels in fig .",
    "[ osci ] ) .",
    "we speculate that this downward push produces pressure pulses propagating outward at the local fast magnetoascoutic speed .",
    "these pulses later evolve into a wave packet as seen in aia 193   running difference images ( fig .",
    "[ wave](d  h ) ) and excite weak type ii radio burst from about 01:40 ut onward ( fig .",
    "[ radio ] ) . at about 01:49 ut",
    ", the wave packet might steepen into a shock , as evidenced by the clear interface between the rarefaction and compression front ( fig .",
    "[ wave](g ) ) , which corresponds to the drastic enhancement of the type ii burst from that time onward ( fig .",
    "[ radio ] ) .    from a case study ,",
    "@xcite concluded as well that the downward compression may be key in driving the global euv wave . in our case ,",
    "the downward compression is vividly manifested as the flattening of coronal loops , whose track on the stack plot can be well fitted by a parabola with a constant acceleration of about 70 m  s@xmath40 ( bottom left panel of fig .  [ osci ] ) , suggesting that the total force applied on these loops is more or less steady .",
    "however , the pressure exerted by the expanding loop system must increase as the resistance is also expected to increase when the loops are pushed toward the surface .",
    "the rebound and subsequent oscillation of these loops indicates that the downward compression alleviates with the rapid rising of the loop system .",
    "the rapid rising , which is closely associated with the flare nonthermal phase ( fig .  [ ht ] ) , actually leads to the convergence of the two legs of the loop system ( fig .",
    "[ overview ] ) , therefore less compression on its neighboring loops .",
    "the quasi - periodic wave train beneath the expanding loop system is observed to first propagate sunward and then anti - sunward at @xmath0200 km  s@xmath14 , which is distinct from the quasi - periodic fast propagating ( qfp ) wave trains recently discovered by aia @xcite .",
    "although both are best seen in 171   within cme bubbles , qfps emanate from flare kernels and travel upward at high speeds of 5002200 km  s@xmath19 , with numerous pulses following one another @xcite .",
    "the slower wave train in the present case might be excited by an impulsive compression of the overlying field due to the extremely fast upward acceleration of the loop system , which explains why the wave train appears initially at hight altitudes and propagates downward .",
    "the subsequent upward propagation indicates a reflection of the wave due to the rapid increase in the alfvnic speed towards the core of the active region .",
    "the jet - like event that occurs in the periphery of the target active region ( fig .",
    "[ init ] ) may serve to weaken the field confining the loop system through interchange reconnections between closed and open fields , according to the classical reconnection - driven jet model @xcite , therefore resulting in its slow rise .",
    "the dhc rises later and slower than the leading edge of the expanding loop system .",
    "hence , this is not an eruption driven by the hot channel as in the cases studied by @xcite .",
    "rather , it is driven by a preexistent , high - lying flux rope associated with the s - shaped dimming .",
    "we suggest that the torus instability is the key eruption mechanism .",
    "since the torus instability sets in when the potential field external to the flux rope declines with height at a sufficiently steep rate @xcite and this decline rate normally increases with height above active regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is expected to see that the high - lying flux rope becomes unstable earlier and hence move faster than the dhc that emerges from the core of the active region ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : tau ] and figs .",
    "[ ht ] and [ hva ] ) .    to conclude , the superior _ _ data presented here have equipped us with a better understanding on physical properties of the cme s early evolution , which are potentially useful as inputs / constraints for models . in particular , an extremely fast acceleration experienced by the cme is revealed , which is not possible without high - resolution , high - cadence observations .",
    "such a high value of acceleration must not be unique , but can be easily concealed in previous low - cadence data .",
    "we conjecture that the compression of coronal plasmas skirting and overlying the expanding loop system , whose aspect ratio @xmath2 increases with time as a result of the rapid upward acceleration , excites the outward - propagating global euv wave and the sunward - propagating local euv wave , respectively .",
