    "numerical simulations followed @xcite so as to confirm the analytic predictions .",
    "it would be noteworthy that the @xmath5 spin system is viewed as a hard - core boson system @xcite .",
    "the random spin system is , thus , equivalent to the strongly repulsive boson system embedded in a certain randomness , which is of the current interest @xcite .    in these studies ,",
    "the magnitude of the constituent spin is set to be one half . in one dimension , however , there exist some other sorts of magnets such as the _ integer_-spin heisenberg chain and the @xmath5 heisenberg ladder model .",
    "the ground states of these magnets are different from the ground state of the @xmath5 heisenberg chain @xcite : in the former case , a finite magnetic excitation gap opens above the ground state , and the magnetic correlation decays exponentially in the ground state . in the present paper , we investigate the bond - random antiferromagnetic @xmath0 spin chain .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath6 the operators @xmath7 denote the @xmath0 spin operators acting on the site @xmath8 , and satisfy the periodic boundary condition , @xmath9 .",
    "we used the following bond distribution , see fig .",
    "[ bond_distribution ] ,    @xmath10    ( the function @xmath11 denotes the step function . ) note that only the antiferromagnetic bond appears .",
    "because of the presence of the excitation gap , the system ( [ hamiltonian ] ) lies beyond the scope of the previous studies of the @xmath5 magnets explained above .",
    "it is quite suggestive that the real - space decimation theory becomes inapplicable for the cases other than @xmath5 . in order to adapt the decimation procedure even for the case @xmath0 , several authors proposed schemes to map the random @xmath0 chain to an effective @xmath5 model @xcite . their theory and",
    "the consequences are reviewed afterwards .",
    "the effect of the _ non - magnetic _ impurity doping upon the spin - gap ground state has been considered rather throughly @xcite : the non - magnetic impurity causes notable influences for the heisenberg ladder . infinitesimal doping distracts the spin gap , and gives rise to a magnetically ( quasi-)ordered ground state with gapless excitation .",
    "the effect of the bond randomness , which is of the present interest , would be more subtle , and remained unsolved .    for the pure system @xmath12 , the ground - state phase diagram of the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] )",
    "is known , see the paper @xcite for details .",
    "we explain the region @xmath13 relevant to the present study . in the region",
    "@xmath14 , the system is in the haldane phase , which is mentioned above ; namely , a finite excitation gap opens , and the magnetic correlation decays exponentially in the ground state . at the critical point @xmath15 , the hamiltonian is integrable .",
    "it is predicted in a field - theoretical manner @xcite that the criticality is of the central charge @xmath16 , and the biquadratic interaction generates the excitation gap in the form , @xmath17 where @xmath18 .",
    "numerical simulations have tried to confirm the above scenario @xcite .",
    "a strong finite - size corrections , however , arise so as to prevent definite conclusions .",
    "typical simulation claims that a transition locates at @xmath19 , and gapless phase extends over @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the inconsistency might be originated in the long correlation length @xmath21 in the barber - batchelor phase @xmath22 ; @xmath23 at @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "the length apparently exceeds the limit tractable by means of the exact - diagonalization method .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we explain the previous analytic theory employing the real - space - decimation method @xcite .",
    "the theory predicts that a phase transition separates the haldane and the random - singlet phases at a certain critical randomness . in the section [ section3 ] ,",
    "we present our result by means of the exact diagonalization method .",
    "we show that the finite - size scaling assuming the theoretical prediction fails ; namely , the present numerical estimate of the transition point and the critical exponent contradicts the prediction .",
    "the haldane phase persists against the randomness until the extremely - broad - bond distribution @xmath25 .",
    "the results of the correlation length and the spin stiffness confirm the present conclusion .",
    "in the last section , we summarize our results , and discuss a possible scenario interpreting our numerical results .",
    "in this section , we review the predictions of the analytic theory @xcite . some are contrastive to our numerical results shown later .",
    "as was introduced in the section [ section1 ] , the real - space - decimation method describes the one - dimensional random magnets quite successfully .",
    "the method , however , fails in the cases other than @xmath5 .",
    "hyman and yang thus proposed the mapping with which the @xmath0 random chain ( [ hamiltonian ] ) is transformed to an effective random @xmath5 chain . the resultant @xmath5 chain constitutes the alternating two types of random bonds , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the even bonds are either ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic , whereas the odd bonds are always antiferromagnetic .",
    "we sketch how the effective @xmath5 random chain is derived .",
    "suppose a sector within the @xmath0 chain in which sector the deviation of the randomness is incidentally small .",
    "they assumed that such sector could be replaced with that without any randomness .",
    "as a consequence , the random @xmath0 chain consists of finite uniform @xmath0 sectors coupling antiferromagnetically . on the other hand , it was reported that at an end of the uniform @xmath0 open chain , the @xmath5 magnetization appears spontaneously with a certain localization length @xcite . both the end magnetizations couple antiferromagnetically ( ferromagnetically ) , if the length of the open chain is even ( odd ) .",
    "thereby , the finite uniform @xmath0 sector is replaced with the two @xmath5 spins coupling either antiferromagnetically or ferromagnetically .",
    "the real - space decimation procedure is employed afterwards .",
    "they found a fixed point at a critical randomness @xmath28 , which separates the haldane phase and the random - singlet phase @xcite .",
    "( refer to the section [ section1 ] for these phases . ) furthermore , the theory concludes that the correlation length diverges as @xmath29 with @xmath30 .",
    "the decimation procedure was simulated numerically as well @xcite .",
    "the simulation shows that an intermediate phase appears between the haldane and the random - singlet phases .",
    "in this section , we investigate the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) by means of the exact - diagonalization method . the exact - diagonalization method has been utilized successfully in the course of the studies of the @xmath5 random spin systems @xcite .      in fig .",
    "[ string_0 ] , we plotted the string correlation @xcite @xmath31 against the randomness @xmath32 at the heisenberg point @xmath33 .",

    "the string correlation was invented in order to detect characteristics of the haldane state .",
    "the long - range limit was estimated numerically , @xmath36 , at @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "( it is noteworthy that the usual correlations , such as the nel correlation , are short - range . ) in fig .",
    "[ string_0 ] , we see that the string order dominates in the weak - random region , while it becomes suppressed as the randomness is strengthened .    in order to observe whether the string correlation is long - range or not , we evaluate the binder parameter @xcite for the string correlation , @xmath37_{\\rm av } }              { 3[\\langle o^2 \\rangle]_{\\rm av } } , \\label{binder_parameter}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 .",
    "the binder parameter is enhanced ( suppressed ) with increasing the system size , if the corresponding order is long - range ( short - range ) .",
    "it is plotted in fig .",
    "[ binder_0 ] , where the parameter varies in the same range as that in fig .",
    "[ string_0 ] .",
    "we see that the string order develops in the whole range of the randomness .",
    "the result contradicts the picture @xcite reviewed in the previous section .",
    "as the biquadratic term is turned on ( @xmath39 ) , the haldane phase becomes suppressed .",
    "( note the phase diagram for the pure case reviewed in the section [ section1 ] . ) in fig .",
    "[ binder_t2 ] , where we plotted the binder parameter at @xmath40 .",
    "it is implied that there exists a transition point @xmath41 ; in one side @xmath42 the string order develops , while in the other side @xmath43 it is disturbed . some might wonder that the result of @xmath40 in fig .",
    "[ binder_t2 ] is inconsistent with the result of @xmath33 in fig .",
    "[ binder_0 ] , and the former supports the picture of the previous theory @xcite . in the following , however ,",
    "we show an evidence that the transition point ( intersection point ) is extrapolated to @xmath44 in the thermodynamic limit @xmath45 .      according to the theory @xcite reviewed in the section [ section2 ]",
    ", the transition should be the second order .",
    "namely , the binder parameter ( [ binder_parameter ] ) obeys the finite - size scaling hypothesis , @xmath46 the scaling dimension @xmath47 is zero , because the binder parameter is dimensionless .",
    "therefore , the data @xmath48-@xmath49 , the so - called scaling data , must align along a curve which is independent on the system size @xmath50 . we determine the scaling parameters @xmath28 and @xmath51 in eq .",
    "( [ scaling_theory ] ) , so that the data converge to such an universal curve ; see the appendix for details .    in fig .",
    "[ scaling_plot_t2 ] , we show the scaling plots for @xmath40 .    in order to see the systematic corrections to the finite size scaling , the scaling analyses are managed for different three sets of the system sizes ; ( a ) @xmath52 , ( b ) @xmath53 and ( c ) @xmath54 , respectively .",
    "we define the approximative transition point @xmath55 and the exponent @xmath56 , which are determined by the scaling plot @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "we found that the scaling parameters result in the following , @xmath59 the transition point converges to @xmath60 for large system sizes , and the exponent approaches @xmath61 .",
    "it is suggested that the transition point is identical with that at the heisenberg point @xmath33 , see fig .",
    "[ binder_0 ] .",
    "we show the scaling plots for @xmath62 as well , see fig .",
    "[ scaling_plot_t3 ] .",
    "the plots yield the following estimates : @xmath63 we observe that the transition point approaches @xmath64 , while the exponent rather scatters .",
    "the scaling analyses beyond @xmath65 are suffered by strong finite - size corrections which also exist for the uniform system ( refer to the section [ section1 ] ) . in consequence of the previous and the present subsections ,",
    "we observe that a phase transition might occur at @xmath25 .",
    "the universality class is rather ambiguous .",
    "it is suggested , at least , that the previous prediction @xmath30 @xcite is not accordant with our numerical analysis .    in the next subsection",
    ", we show an evidence that the transition is the first order . even for such case , the above finite - size - scaling analysis is still meaningful in the sense that it yields the estimate of the intersection point of the binder parameters .",
    "the intersection point is expected to converge to the transition point even for the first - order transition .",
    "the exponent , on the contrary , is not universal , and possibly would not be well - defined for very large system sizes .      in order to confirm that a first - order transition takes place at @xmath25",
    ", we show the result of the correlation length .",
    "we found that the correlation length is remained unchanged over the whole region @xmath66 ; namely , the correlation length does not diverge as in eq .",

    "the magnetic correlation length is hardly changed with the randomness .",
    "moreover , we observe that the correlation itself is not changed very much .",
    "the result indicates that the haldane phase with finite correlation length @xmath70 continues up to the extreme point @xmath25 .    in fig .",
    "[ stiffness_t0 ] , the spin stiffness constant is plotted .",
    "the stiffness constant @xcite is defined by @xmath71 where @xmath72 denotes the boundary twist , @xmath73 the stiffness constant is generally employed for investigating the random system : if the randomness destroys long - range coherence , the stiffness should vanish . in the haldane phase",
    ", the stiffness vanishes exponentially with enlarging the system size , because the ground state has short - range magnetic correlation .",
    "we observe in fig .",
    "[ stiffness_t0 ] that the stiffness actually decays exponentially over the while randomness with the localization length unchanged . in consequence",
    ", we conclude that in the haldane phase , the ground state property is kept unchanged against the randomness , and it transits at the point @xmath25 abruptly .",
    "we will discuss the transition scenario in the next section .",
    "we summarize and discuss our numerical results . the @xmath0 heisenberg chain ( [ hamiltonian ] ) with the bond randomness @xmath32",
    "is studied numerically .",
    "the haldane phase @xmath74 survives over the whole random region @xmath66 : the intersection point of the curves of the binder parameter converges to the point @xmath44 in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "in fact , the result is consistent with the previous theory @xcite , which suggests that the haldane phase would be stable against randomnesses considerably , because the haldane state has such a hidden correlation as the string correlation ( [ string_correlation ] ) .",
    "( hence , the theory @xcite reviewed in the section [ section2 ] somehow contradicts the above . )",
    "the present system is , thus , quite contrastive to the heisenberg ladder with the non - magnetic - impurities , whose spin - liquid ground state is unstable against infinitesimal doping @xcite .",
    "we observed that the correlation length is hardly changed with the randomness increased .",
    "hence , we conclude that the correlation length does not diverge in the vicinity of @xmath25 , and thus the phase transition is the first order .",
    "( note that according to the theory @xcite , a second - order transition separates the haldane phase and the random - singlet phase at a critical randomness @xmath28 . ) at the transition point @xmath25 , namely , the extremely - broad - bond distribution , infinitesimally weak bonds appear .",
    "it is thereby expected that at this very point the random - singlet phase is realized @xcite .    finally , we mention what phase extends beyond the point @xmath75 . in the region ,",
    "ferromagnetic bonds appear as well .",
    "this sort of randomness is considered for the @xmath5 heisenberg chain , see the article @xcite for a review .",
    "we suspect that in this region , the ground state is similar to that realized for the the @xmath5 chain : it is found that the low - temperature properties resemble those of the classical counterpart @xcite .",
    "this similarity is quite convincing , because the ferromagnetism is not affected very much by quantum fluctuation .",
    "it is natural that at least the magnitude of the spin does not alter the ground - state property .",
    "the haldane phase @xmath76 , on the contrary , owes the stabilization to the zero - point quantum fluctuation . in consequence",
    ", we see that at @xmath25 a drastic transition occurs from the haldane phase to the above rather classical phase .",
    "our computer programs are partly based on the subroutine package `` titpack ver .",

    "we explain the details of our finite - size - scaling analyses , which we managed in the section [ section3_2 ] in order to estimate the transition point @xmath28 and the exponent @xmath51 .",
    "we adjusted these scaling parameters so that the scaled data , such as those shown in figs .",
    "[ scaling_plot_t2 ] and [ scaling_plot_t3 ] , form a curve irrespective of the system sizes . in order to see qualitatively to what extent these data align ,",
    "we employ the `` local lineality function '' @xmath77 defined by kawashima and ito @xcite : suppose a set of the data points @xmath78 with the errorbar @xmath79 , which we number so that @xmath80 may hold for @xmath81 .",
