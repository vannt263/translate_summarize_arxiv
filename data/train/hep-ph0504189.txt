    "the spectral distributions eqs.([2.4 ] ) and ( [ 5.4 ] ) can be much higher than the bethe - heitler pair production distribution for small angles of incidence @xmath2 with respect to selected axis .",
    "for the case @xmath257 the quantity @xmath258 can be represented as @xmath259 the main contribution to the sum in eqs.([2.4 ] ) and ( [ 5.4 ] ) for small @xmath2 is given @xmath102 with @xmath260 , then @xmath261 where @xmath262 and @xmath263 are the characteristic periods of the potential in the plane transverse to the considered axis , @xmath16 is the angle of the projection @xmath264 onto this plane with respect to one of the planes containing the selected axis , @xmath265 and @xmath266 are integers .",
    "let us consider the spectral distribution of pair production in the extreme limit when the parameter @xmath267 . in this case",
    "the maximum of distribution is attained at such values of @xmath2 where the standard cpp becomes inapplicable .",
    "bearing in mind that if @xmath268 and @xmath269 than @xmath270 , we can conveniently use the modified theory of cpp .",
    "utilization of the modified theory for these values of @xmath271 and @xmath251 gives the exact position of maximum of the spectral distribution ( in region where @xmath272 ) and the value of the total probability within logarithmic accuracy @xmath273 .",
    "the transverse component of the vector @xmath102 in eq.([5.4b ] ) can be selected in a such way that the spectral distribution given by eq.([5.4 ] ) has a sharp maximum near the end of the spectrum at @xmath274 with relatively narrow ( in terms @xmath275 ) width @xmath276 @xmath277 it is seen that the maximum of the spectral distribution with the opposite helicity ( @xmath278 ) is suppressed as @xmath279 . at @xmath280 one",

    "the suppression of the probability with opposite helicity is more strong , so the created positrons have nearly complete longitudinal polarization .",
    "bearing in mind that @xmath281 we find that for @xmath282 @xmath283 where @xmath284 is the radiation length in a corresponding amorphous medium , @xmath285 , the function @xmath286 is defined in eq.([4.3 ] ) , @xmath287 is the number of created positrons , for tungsten one has @xmath288tev .",
    "thus , the above analysis shows that the considered mechanism of creation of longitudinally polarized positrons is especially effective because there is a gain both in the monochromaticity and the total yield of polarized positrons with the energy @xmath289 .",
    "it is shown above that at high energy in the process of production of electron - positron pair with longitudinally polarized particles by the circularly polarized photon in an oriented crystal the phenomenon of helicity transfer takes place in the case when the final particle takes away nearly all energy of the photon .",
    "this is true in the constant field limit @xmath0 as well as in the coherent pair production region @xmath290 .    in crossing channel :",
    "the radiation from longitudinally polarized high energy electrons in oriented crystals is circularly polarized ( @xmath291 ) near the end of spectrum @xcite also in both regions .",
    "this is once more the particular case of helicity transfer .",
    "so , the oriented crystal is a very effective device for helicity transfer from a photon to electron or positron and back from an electron to photon . near the end of spectrum",
