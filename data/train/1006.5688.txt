    "this paper proposes a new perspective to maximum likelihood(ml ) decoding in error - correcting codes as rational maps and shows some relationships between coding theory and dynamical systems . in section [ sec : cs ] , [ sec : lc ] , and [ sec : ml ] , we explain notations and minimum prerequisites of coding theory ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "the main results are presented in section [ sec : result ] .",
    "a mathematical model of communication systems in information theory was developed by shannon @xcite . a general block diagram for visualizing the behavior of such systems",
    "is given by figure [ fig : channel ] .",
    "the source transmits a @xmath1-bit message @xmath2 to the destination via the channel , which is usually affected by noise @xmath3 . in order to recover the transmitted message at the destination under the influence of noise",
    ", we transform the message into a codeword @xmath4 by some injective mapping @xmath5 at the encoder and input it to the channel .",
    "then the decoder transforms an @xmath6-bit received sequence of letters @xmath7 by some decoding mapping @xmath8 in order to obtain the transmitted codeword at the destination .",
    "here we consider all arithmetic calculations in some finite field and in this paper we fix it as @xmath9 except for section [ sec : ag ] . as a model of channels",
    ", we deal with a binary symmetric channel ( bsc ) in this paper which is characterized by the transition probability @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "namely , with probability @xmath12 , the output letter is a faithful replica of the input , and with probability @xmath10 , it is the opposite of the input letter for each bit ( see figure [ fig : bsc ] ) . in particular , this is an example of memoryless channels .    then , one of the main purposes of coding theory is to develop a good encoder - decoder pair @xmath13 which is robust to noise perturbations .",
    "hence , the problem is how we efficiently use the redundancy @xmath14 in this setting .              a code with a linear encoding map @xmath5",
    "is called a linear code .",
    "a codeword in a linear code can be characterized by its generator matrix @xmath15 where each element @xmath16 .",
    "therefore the set of codewords is given by @xmath17 here without loss of generality , we assume @xmath18 for all @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "we call @xmath1 and @xmath6 the dimension and the length of the code , respectively .    because of the linearity",
    ", it is also possible to describe @xmath21 as a kernel of a matrix @xmath22 whose @xmath23 row vectors are linearly independent and orthogonal to those of @xmath24 , i.e. , @xmath25 where @xmath26 means the transpose matrix of @xmath22 .",
    "this matrix @xmath22 is called a parity check matrix of @xmath21 .",
    "the dual code @xmath27 of @xmath21 is defined in such a way that a parity check matrix of @xmath27 is given by a generator matrix @xmath24 of @xmath21 .",
    "the hamming distance @xmath28 between two @xmath6-bit sequences @xmath29 is given by the number of positions at which the two sequences differ .",
    "the weight of an element @xmath30 is the hamming distance to @xmath31 , i.e. , @xmath32 .",
    "then the minimum distance @xmath33 of a code @xmath21 is defined by two different ways as @xmath34 here the second equality results from the linearity .",
    "it is easy to observe that the minimum distance is @xmath35 if and only if there exists a set of @xmath36 linearly dependent column vectors of @xmath22 but no set of @xmath37 linearly dependent column vectors .    for a code",
    "@xmath21 with the minimum distance @xmath38 , let us set @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the integer part of @xmath41 .",
    "then , it follows from the following observation that @xmath21 can correct @xmath42 errors : if @xmath43 and @xmath44 for some @xmath45 then @xmath46 is the only codeword with @xmath44 . in this sense , the minimum distance is one of the important parameters to measure performance of a code and is desirable to design it as large as possible for the robustness to noise .",
    "let us recall that , given a transmitted codeword @xmath46 , the conditional probability @xmath47 of a received sequence @xmath43 at the decoder is given by @xmath48 for a memoryless channel .",
    "maximum likelihood(ml ) decoding @xmath49 is given by taking the marginalization of @xmath47 for each bit .",
    "precisely speaking , for a received sequence @xmath50 , the @xmath51-th bit element @xmath52 of the decoded word @xmath53 is determined by the following rule : @xmath54 in general , for a given decoder @xmath8 , the bit error probability @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is one of the important measures of decoding performance .",
    "obviously , it is desirable to design an encoding - decoding pair whose bit error probability is as small as possible .",
    "it is known that ml decoding attains the minimum bit error probability for any encodings under the uniform distribution on @xmath57 . in this sense , ml decoding is the best for all decoding rules .",
    "however its computational cost requires at least @xmath58 operations , and it is too much to use for practical applications .    from the above property of ml decoding ,",
    "one of the key motivation of this work comes from the following simple question .",
    "is it possible to accurately approximate the ml decoding rules with low computational complexity ?",
    "the main results in this paper give answers to this question .",
    "let us first define for each codeword @xmath59 its codeword polynomial @xmath60 as @xmath61 then we define a rational map @xmath62 , @xmath63,$ ] by using codeword polynomials as @xmath64 where @xmath65 .",
    "this rational map plays the most important role in the paper .",
    "it is sometimes denoted by @xmath66 , when we need to emphasize the generator matrix @xmath24 of the code @xmath21 .    for a sequence @xmath43 ,",
    "let us take a point @xmath67 as @xmath68 where @xmath10 is the transition probability of the channel .",
    "then it is straightforward to check that @xmath69 .",
    "namely , the conditional probability of @xmath50 under a codeword @xmath59 is given by the value of the corresponding codeword polynomial @xmath70 at @xmath71 .",
    "therefore , from the construction of the rational map , ml decoding ( [ eq : bitml ] ) is equivalently given by the following rule @xmath72 in this sense , the study of ml decoding can be treated by analyzing the image of the initial point ( [ eq : ip ] ) by the rational map ( [ eq : map ] ) .",
    "some of the properties of this map in the sense of dynamical systems will be studied in detail in section [ sec : ds ] .",
    "we will also discuss in section [ sec : discussions ] that performance of a code can be explained by these properties .",
    "for the statement of the main results , we only here mention that this rational map has a fixed point @xmath73 for any generator matrix ( proposition [ pp : fp ] ) .",
    "let us denote the taylor expansion at @xmath0 by @xmath74 where @xmath75 is a vector notation of @xmath76 , @xmath77 is the jacobi matrix at @xmath0 , @xmath78 corresponds to the @xmath51-th order term , and @xmath79 means the usual order notation .",
    "the reason why we choose @xmath0 as the approximating point is related to the local dynamical property at @xmath0 and will be explained in section [ sec : p ] .    by truncating higher oder terms @xmath79 in ( [ eq : taylor ] ) and denoting it as @xmath80",
    "we can define the @xmath81-th approximation of ml decoding by replacing the map @xmath82 in ( [ eq : mlrule ] ) with @xmath83 , and denote this approximate ml decoding by @xmath84 , i.e. , @xmath85 let us remark that the notations @xmath86 and @xmath87 do not explicitly express the dependence on @xmath81 for removing unnecessary confusions of subscripts .",
    "we note that there are two different viewpoints on this approximate ml decoding .",
    "one way is that , in the sense of its precision , it is preferable to have an expansion with large @xmath81 . on the other hand , from the viewpoint of low computational complexity , it is desirable to include many zero elements in higher order terms .",
    "the next theorem states a sufficient condition to satisfy these two requirements .",
    "[ thm : thm ] let @xmath88 .",
    "if any distinct @xmath81 column vectors of a generator matrix @xmath24 are linearly independent , then the taylor expansion ( [ eq : taylor ] ) at @xmath0 of the rational map ( [ eq : map ] ) takes the following form @xmath89 where the @xmath51-th coordinate @xmath90 of @xmath91 is given by @xmath92    first of all , it follows that the larger the minimum distance of the dual code @xmath27 is , the more precise approximation of ml decoding with low computational complexity we have for the code @xmath21 with the generator matrix @xmath24 .",
    "especially , we can take @xmath93 .",
    "secondly , let us consider the meaning of the approximate map @xmath83 and its approximate ml decoding @xmath87 .",
    "we note that each value @xmath94 in ( [ eq : ip ] ) for a received word @xmath43 expresses the likelihood @xmath95 .",
    "let us suppose @xmath96 .",
    "then , from the definition of @xmath97 , each term in the sum of ( [ eq : hosum ] ) satisfies @xmath98 when @xmath99 , this term decreases(increases , resp . ) the value of initial likelihood @xmath100 . in view of the decoding rule ( [ eq : mlrule ] ) , this induces @xmath52 to be decoded into @xmath101 , and this actually corresponds to the structure of the code @xmath102 appearing in @xmath103 . in this sense",
    ", the approximate map @xmath104 can be regarded as renewing the likelihood ( under suitable normalizations ) based on the code structure , and the approximate ml decoding @xmath87 judges these renewed data . from this argument",
    ", it is easy to see that a received word @xmath105 is decoded into @xmath106 , i.e. , the codeword is decoded into itself and , of course , this property should be equipped with any decoders .",
    "we also remark that theorem [ thm : thm ] can be regarded as a duality theorem in the following sense .",
    "let @xmath21 be a code whose generator(resp .",
    "parity check ) matrix is @xmath24 ( resp .",
    "@xmath22 ) . as we explained in section",
    "[ sec : lc ] , the linear independence of the column vectors of @xmath22 controls the minimum distance @xmath33 and this is an encoding property .",
    "on the other hand , theorem [ thm : thm ] shows that the linear independence of the column vectors of @xmath24 , which determines the dual minimum distance @xmath107 , controls a decoding property of ml decoding in the sense of accuracy and computational complexity .",
    "hence , we have the correspondence between @xmath108 duality and encoding / decoding duality . in corollary",
    "[ corollary : ag ] , we will consider this duality viewpoint in a setting of geometric reed - solomon / goppa codes .",
    "we show the second result of this paper about the decoding performances of the approximate ml ( [ eq : apmlrule ] ) . for this purpose ,",
    "let us first examine numerical simulations of the bit error probability on the bsc with the transition probability @xmath109 .",
    "we also show numerical results on bch codes with berlekamp - massey decoding for comparison .",
    "the results are summarized in figure [ fig : berrate ] .     and @xmath110 .",
    "horizontal axis : transition probability @xmath10 .",
    "vertical axis : bit error probability .",
    "@xmath111 : 3rd order approximate ml decoding .",

    "@xmath113 : ml decoding .",

    "@xmath112 : berlekamp - massaey decoding .",
    "@xmath113 : ml decoding . , width=302 ]    here , the horizontal axis is the code rate @xmath114 , and the vertical axis is the bit error probability .",
    "the plots @xmath115 ( @xmath111 resp . ) correspond to the 2nd ( 3rd resp . ) order approximate ml ( [ eq : apmlrule ] ) , and @xmath112 are the results on several bch codes ( @xmath116 ) with berlekamp - messey decodings . for the proposed method ,",
    "we randomly construct a systematic generator matrix in such a way that each column except for the systematic part has the same weight ( i.e. number of non - zero elements ) @xmath117 . to be more specific , the submatrix composed by the first @xmath1 columns of the generator matrix is set to be an identity matrix in order to make the code systematic ,",
    "while the rest of the generator matrix is made up of @xmath118 random matrices generated by random permutations of columns of a circulant matrix , whose first column is given by @xmath119 the reason for using random codings is that we want to investigate average behaviors of the decoding performance , and , for this purpose , we do not put unnecessary additional structure at encodings .",
    "the number of matrices added after the systematic part depends on the code rate , and the plot for each code rate corresponds to the best result obtained out of about 100 realizations of the generator matrix .",
    "also , we have employed @xmath120 and 3 for the generator matrices of the 3rd and the 2nd order approximate ml , respectively . moreover ,",
    "the length of the codewords @xmath6 are assumed to be up to 512 . from figure",
    "[ fig : berrate ] , we can see that the proposed method with the 3rd order approximate ml ( @xmath111 ) achieves better performance than that of bch codes with berlekamp - massey(@xmath112 ) .",
    "it should be also noticed that the decoding performance is improved a lot from the 2nd order to the 3rd order approximation .",
    "this improvement is reasonable because of the meaning of the taylor expansion .",
    "next , let us directly compare the decoding performances among ml , approximate ml ( 3rd order ) and berlekamp - massey by applying them on the same bch code ( @xmath121 , @xmath110 ) .",
    "the result on the bit error probability with respect to transition probability is shown in figure [ fig : berprob ] .",
    "this figure clearly shows that the performance of the 3rd order approximate ml decoding is far better than that of berlekamp - massey decoding ( e.g. , improvement of double - digit at @xmath122 ) .",
    "furthermore , it should be noted that the 3rd order approximate ml decoding achieves a very close bit error performance to that of ml decoding .",
    "although we have not mathematically confirmed the computational complexity of the proposed approach , the computational time of the approximate ml ( 3rd order ) is much faster than ml decoding .",
    "this fact about low computational complexity of the approximate ml is explained as follows :",
    "non - zero higher order terms in ( [ eq : hosum ] ) appear as a result of linear dependent relations of column vectors of @xmath24 , however , linear dependences require high codimentional scenario . hence , most of the higher order terms become zeros . as a result , the computational complexity for the approximate ml , which is determined by the number of nonzero terms in the expansion , becomes small .    in conclusion",
    ", these numerical simulations suggest that the 3rd order approximate ml decoding approximates ml decoding very well with low computational complexity .",
    "we notice that the encodings examined here are random codings .",
    "hence , we can expect to obtain better bit error performance by introducing certain structure on encodings suitable to this proposed decoding rule , or much more exhaustive search of random codes .",
    "one of the possibility will be the combination with theorem [ thm : thm ] .",
    "on the other hand , it is also possible to consider suitable encoding rules from the viewpoint of dynamical systems via rational maps ( [ eq : map ] ) .",
    "this issue is discussed in detail in section [ sec : discussions ] . in any case , finding suitable encoding structure for the proposed decodings is one of the important future problem .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : ds ] , we study properties of the rational map ( [ eq : map ] ) in view of a discrete dynamical system and show some relationships to coding theory . we also show that this discrete dynamical system is related to a continuous gradient dynamical system @xmath123 .",
    "section [ sec : taylor ] deals with relationship between a generator matrix of a code and its taylor expansion ( [ eq : taylor ] ) .",
    "the proof of theorem [ thm : thm ] , which is a direct consequence of proposition [ pp : jacobi ] and proposition [ pp : fl0 ] , is shown in this section . in section [ sec : ag ] , we apply theorem [ thm : thm ] to geometric reed - solomon / goppa codes in corollary [ corollary : ag ] with a simple example by using the hermitian curve . finally , we discuss the future problems on this subject as an intersection of dynamical systems and coding theory .",
    "in this section , we discuss ml decoding from dynamical systems viewpoints .",
    "let @xmath24 be a @xmath124 generator matrix for a code @xmath21 .",
    "we begin with showing the following easy consequence of linear codes , which will be used frequently throughout the paper .",
    "[ lemma : gi ] for @xmath125 , let us denote subcodes of @xmath21 with @xmath126 and @xmath127 respectively by @xmath128 then @xmath129 .     from the assumption on the generator matrix , we have @xmath18 and let @xmath130 be the number of 1 in @xmath131 .",
    "then we have @xmath132 where the symbol @xmath133 means the number of combinations for taking @xmath134 elements from @xmath81 elements .",

    "we also define a point @xmath143 as a pole of the rational map ( [ eq : map ] ) if @xmath144 .",

    "if there exists a codeword @xmath45 such that @xmath169 , then the value of its corresponding codeword polynomial is @xmath163 .",
    "so , @xmath170 . on the other hand , if there is no such codeword , then @xmath144 , it means @xmath159 .    from this proposition ,",
    "the rational map ( [ eq : map ] ) has information of not only all codewords @xmath21 as fixed points but also non - codewords @xmath171 as poles .",
    "we call these fixed points codeword fixed points .",
    "the following proposition shows that all of the codeword fixed points are stable .",
    "[ pp : stable ] let a parity check matrix do not have zero column vectors , i.e. , there exists no codeword with weight 1 .",

    "this obviously depends on whether or not @xmath97 is located in the attractor region of the codeword fixed point , although it is actually the case when @xmath10 is small enough because of the stability .",

    "however this is an important subject since it is indispensable to give an estimate of error probabilities of ml decoding and its approximation .",
    "similar arguments also hold for a non - codeword received sequence and its repelling property .",
    "let us recall that the ml decoding rule is given by ( [ eq : mlrule ] ) which checks the location of the image for an initial point @xmath97 to the point @xmath0 .",

    "@xmath449 is given by the 1 dimensional subspace spanned by @xmath450 this plays a role to make @xmath451 to be equal , and it reflects the fact @xmath452 .",

    "@xmath453 is spanned by the stable eigenvectors @xmath454 in corollary [ corollary : eigenvector ] .",

    "however , if @xmath0 is hyperbolic , then the coding rate must satisfy @xmath455 by corollary [ corollary : eigenvalue ] .",
    "namely , the hyperbolicity prevents a code to have a high coding rate greater than half , although this is not a strict restriction in particular applications like wireless communication channels .",
    "therefore it is necessary to have a center eigenspace at @xmath0 for a code with the rate @xmath456 .",
    "the normal form theory in dynamical systems ( e.g. , see @xcite ) enables us to transform a map into a simpler form by using a near identity transformation around a fixed point .",
    "one of the essential points is that nonresonant higher order terms can be removed from the original map by this transformation .",
    "theorem [ thm : thm ] can be interpreted from the viewpoints of normal forms in such a way that an algebraic geometry code gives only zero nonresonant terms in the expansion of @xmath82 at @xmath0 .",
    "then , it leads to the following natural question whether a code whose rational map does not have resonant terms , but has nonresonant terms which are not necessarily zeros in its expansion is a good error - correcting code or not through a near identity transformation .",
    "at least , this class of codes contains algebraic geometry codes as a subclass , and a similar statement to corollary [ corollary : ag ] holds through near identity transformations .",
    "it seems to be valuable to mention a relationship to ldpc codes @xcite , @xcite , which are a relatively new class of error - correcting codes based on iterative decoding schemes ( for a reference to this research region , see @xcite ) .",
    "the iterative decoding schemes mainly use so - called sum - product algorithm for ml decoding and deal with a marginalized conditional probability in ( [ eq : bitml ] ) as a convergent point .",
    "although this coding scheme gives a good performance in some numerical simulations , mathematical further understanding of the sum - product algorithm and ml decoding is desired to design better coding schemes . from the viewpoint of dynamical systems",
