    "the evolution of field perturbation around a black hole consists roughly of three stages @xcite .",
    "the first one is an initial wave burst coming directly from the source of perturbation and is dependent on the initial form of the original field perturbation .",
    "the second one involves the damped oscillations called the quasinormal modes , the frequencies and damping times of which are entirely fixed by the structure of the background . the last one is a power - law tail @xcite @xcite behavior of the waves at very late time , which is caused by backscattering of the gravitational field .",
    "the late - time evolution of various field perturbations outside a black hole has important implications for two major aspects of black hole physics : the no - hair theorem and the mass - inflation scenario@xcite@xcite .",
    "therefore , since wheeler @xcite@xcite introduced the no - hair theorem which states that black holes are completely characterized only by three externally observable parameters : mass , electrical charge , and angular momentum , the decay rate of the various fields have been extensively studied @xcite-@xcite .",

    "starobinskii , novikov @xcite and burko @xcite analyzed the evolution of a massive scalar field in the reissner - norstrm background , and they found that , because of the mass term , there are poles in the complex plane closer to the real axis than in the massless case , which leads to inverse power - law behavior with smaller indices than the massless case .",
    "hod and piran @xcite pointed out that , if the field mass @xmath8 is small , namely  @xmath9 , the oscillatory inverse power - law behavior @xmath10 dominates as the intermediate late - time tails in the reissner - nordstrm background .",

    "recently , late - time tails of self - interacting ( massive ) scalar fields in a dilaton spacetime and in higher dimensional black hole were investigated by moderski and rogatko @xcite@xcite , and they found that the intermediate asymptotic behavior of the self - interacting scalar field is determined by an oscillatory inverse power - law decaying tail .",
