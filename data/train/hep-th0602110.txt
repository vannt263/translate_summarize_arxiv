    "the ads / cft correspondence provides an intriguing relationship between a weakly coupled @xmath3 dimensional gravity theory and a strongly coupled @xmath4 dimensional conformal field theory ( cft ) @xcite .",
    "the evidence for a holographic relationship between five - dimensional ( 5d ) gravity theories and four - dimensional ( 4d ) cfts is by now relatively well established , and articulated , for example , in @xcite .",
    "this led to several applications , particularly with regard to interpreting versions of the randall - sundrum model @xcite as an approximate 4d cft whose conformal invariance is broken in the infrared ( ir ) .",
    "the ir breaking of conformal invariance implies a discrete spectrum of cft resonances ( on the 5d side : spectrum of kaluza - klein excitations ) , and thus we have a 4d theory that really has particles and an @xmath5-matrix , allowing us to exploit this relationship for phenomenology .",
    "recent phenomenological applications of the ads / cft correspondence are the proposals of a simple holographic dual to low energy qcd @xcite . these models have allowed for the calculation of properties of mesons and baryons , given relatively few input parameters , with results that so far are remarkably consistent with experimental data to within 15% .",
    "physics such as chiral symmetry breaking and confinement that are associated with the existence of an ir brane is put in by hand , following the ads / cft dictionary .",
    "the discrete spectrum of kaluza - klein excitations of bulk fields become the composites of qcd .",
    "these models are referred to as ads / qcd models ; several extensions and simplifications of the ads / qcd models have been proposed in @xcite . for some of the earlier attempts on applying ads / cft to qcd ,",
    "see @xcite . what is most surprising about the success of ads / qcd is the success itself .",
    "the ads / cft correspondence is a duality between a cft and a string theory in a particular spacetime background .",
    "if @xmath6 and @xmath7 are large , where @xmath6 and @xmath8 are the number of colors and gauge coupling constant respectively , then stringy physics decouples and a classical field theory coupled to gravity remains .",
    "however , in qcd neither @xmath6 nor @xmath9 is large , which suggests that even if there is a holographic dual to qcd , the full string theory may be required to make useful predictions .",
    "nevertheless , it turns out that a simple model using a 5d field theory in ads space works surprisingly well .",
    "one of our motivations in this paper is to address why the ads / cft approach has worked so well for qcd , by comparing with an orthogonal approach that yields similar results .",
    "shifman @xcite and voloshin @xcite recently pointed out that in the 70s migdal computed masses of mesons in large @xmath6 qcd using a pad approximation to qcd current - current correlators , and found them to be roots of bessel functions @xcite .",
    "( see @xcite for spectrum of qcd in 2 + 1 dimensions involving roots of bessel functions .",
    ") the technique amounts to approximating the current - current correlator in the deep euclidean regime by a ratio of two polynomials of degree @xmath10 ( not to be confused with @xmath6 the number of colors ) . for large euclidean momenta , correlators are dominated by short - distance physics and exhibit conformal behavior .",
    "the pad approximant is then analytically continued to the low energy regime where resonance physics dominates .",
    "physically , the approach is tantamount to finding the best fit to high energy data with a finite set of resonances . at low energies and large @xmath10",
    ", migdal found that the pad polynomials could be approximated by bessel functions , giving the masses of the mesons as roots of bessel functions .",
    "the appearance of bessel functions in this approach is tantalizingly similar to ads / cft .    in this paper",
    "we will make explicit the relation between the pad approximation of current - current correlators and the ads / cft correspondence , and show that both approaches give identical leading order predictions .",
    "the comparison requires a careful treatment of the pad approximation in which a uv regulator scale @xmath11 and the polynomial degree @xmath10 are sent to infinity while the ratio @xmath12 is held fixed .",
    "the length scale @xmath12 is identified with the location of the ir brane in the ads / cft approach , which is also related to the confinement scale .",
    "we emphasize that just like in ads / qcd , the ir scale is put in by hand , and is _ a priori _ independent of the chiral symmetry breaking condensates .",
    "nevertheless , the pad approximation is remarkably powerful in being able to manifest other aspects of ads / cft .",
    "for instance , a very recent paper @xcite incorporated power corrections arising from condensates of quarks and gluons @xcite in the ads / qcd framework .",
    "we show that the pad approximation can also accommodate power corrections , and the result continues to agree with the ads / cft approach .",
    "finally , we show how the radial direction of 5d anti - de sitter space emerges as the order of the pad approximation increases , by analogy with deconstructed extra dimensions @xcite .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : adscft ] we review the computation of conformal two - point functions in ads / cft . in sec .",
    "[ sec : midgal ] , we describe migdal s pad approximation for the current - current correlation function and show that in the low - energy , large @xmath10 limit it gives the same expression as that obtained from ads / cft . in sec .",
    "[ sec : power ] we consider the breaking of the conformal symmetry through power corrections , and again show that the two approaches agree . in sec .",
    "[ sec : deconstruct ] we show how the pad approximation gives rise to a gauge invariant regularization of warped 5d gauge theories by analogy with deconstructed extra dimensions . finally , we conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the prototypical example of the ads / cft correspondence is the duality between 4d @xmath13=4 @xmath14 super yang - mills theory and type iib string theory compactified on ads@xmath15s@xmath16 . in a limit which involves taking the rank of the gauge group and the t hooft coupling large , string theory effects decouple and classical type iib supergravity on ads@xmath17s@xmath16 remains . with this simplification it becomes possible to analytically calculate correlation functions in the 4d gauge theory from supergravity .",
    "the basic dictionary relating correlation functions in the cft to supergravity on an ads background was found in @xcite , and many tests have since been performed . in this section",
    "we briefly review the computation of the cft two - point function for vector currents in ads / cft .",
    "each operator in the cft corresponds to a field in anti - de sitter space of one dimension higher , whose boundary value is set equal to the source for the corresponding operator .",
    "more precisely , if we consider the ads metric in the form , @xmath18 where @xmath19 , the prescription in @xcite states that @xmath20}\\right|_{\\phi^{\\rm cl}(x , z=0)= \\phi_0 } , \\ ] ] where @xmath21 $ ] is the classical action in the ads space and @xmath22 is a solution to the equation of motion whose boundary value is fixed to be the source @xmath23 ( up to a conformal rescaling ) . in practice one introduces an uv regulator @xmath24 and then takes @xmath25 . for a vector current such as @xmath26 in the cft",
    ", there is a corresponding bulk gauge field @xmath27 whose boundary value is the source for @xmath28 .",
    "the 5d action in ads space is @xmath29 where the capital roman letters @xmath30 .",
    "we have neglected a bulk mass term for @xmath31 since we are considering conserved currents .",
    "according to the ads / cft correspondence , to calculate the current - current correlator , we calculate the 5d action on a solution to the equations of motion for the corresponding gauge field such that the 5d gauge field at the uv boundary has the profile of the 4d source of the current .",
    "we will consider a finite ads space with an infrared boundary at @xmath32 .",
    "the profile of the 5d gauge field satisfying those boundary conditions is the bulk - to - boundary propagator , which we call @xmath33 .",
    "varying the action ( twice ) with respect to the boundary source gives the current - current correlator .",
    "we impose the @xmath34 gauge and fourier - transform the gauge field in four dimensions : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the fourier - transformed current source .",
    "the boundary condition @xmath37 is built into ( [ bb0 ] ) .",
    "the boundary condition at @xmath32 is not completely predetermined , but for definiteness we assume neumann boundary conditions there , @xmath38 , corresponding to the gauge invariant condition @xmath39 .",
    "the equations of motion for the transverse part of the gauge field are , @xmath40 which , given the boundary conditions , leads to @xmath41 evaluating the action on the solution leaves only the the boundary term at the uv @xmath42 if we write the fourier - transformed vector current two - point function as , @xmath43 then functionally differentiating the action ( [ act0 ] ) with respect to the source @xmath36 yields the vector current - current correlator determined by ads / cft : @xmath44 where we have retained the leading non - vanishing contribution from each of the bessel functions in the limit @xmath45 : @xmath46 note that we have neglected terms in ( [ 2pt ] ) that can be absorbed into the re - definition of @xmath47 , such as the euler constant @xmath48 in the expansion of @xmath49 . from ( [ 2pt ] )",
    "we see that the masses of the resonances in the cft , given by the simple poles in @xmath50 , are determined by roots of the bessel function @xmath51 . on the other hand ,",
    "if we simultaneously take @xmath52 , then the spectrum becomes continuous and the vector polarization @xmath50 turns into , up to contact terms , @xmath53 here we see explicitly that @xmath47 plays the role of an uv regulator . in the context of ads",
    "/ qcd , one matches ( [ sig0 ] ) onto the quark bubble calculation in qcd at large euclidean momentum , which gives , @xmath54 in units of the ads curvature @xcite .    the expression in ( [ g5 ] ) serves as a good point to discuss why a strict reading of the ads / cft correspondence would suggest that the models in ads / qcd should nt have worked so well . in qcd @xmath55 which then suggests that the 5d gauge coupling is strong .",
    "therefore higher order corrections in the ads side may be as important as the tree - level results .",
    "furthermore , on the qcd side the t hooft coupling @xmath56 , which would suggest stringy effects can not be decoupled in the ads space .",
    "again , a simple model of a 5d gauge field does not appear to be justified _ a priori _ , yet somehow produces accurate results .    in order to include corrections due to higher dimension operators in the operator product expansion ( ope ) of the two - point function ( power corrections )",
    ", we can add to the action higher dimension operators and additional bulk fields @xcite .",
    "for example , including the dilaton in the theory allows couplings which would mimic the inclusion of higher dimension operators involving the qcd field strength .",
    "alternatively , a simpler modification of the theory which also captures the effects of power corrections in the two - point function is to allow deviations in the geometry towards the boundary @xcite .",
    "these modifications directly encode breaking of conformal symmetry away from the uv , which is also a consequence of chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "we will see in sec .",
    "[ sec : power ] that migdal s pad approximation approach to estimating current correlators can be easily generalized to include higher dimension operators in the ope .",
    "in the 70s migdal proposed a systematic procedure for calculating masses of mesons in large @xmath6 qcd @xcite , which approximates the two - point function in the deep euclidean region by a rational function and then analytically continues into the infrared domain .",
    "mathematically this procedure amounts to performing the pad approximation . the rationale behind migdal s approach relies on properties of large @xmath6 , in particular the vanishing of instanton corrections to current correlators .",
    "it is unclear how nonperturbative corrections should be added in the 1/@xmath6 expansion , so the justification for the pad approximation is limited .",
    "nonetheless , ignoring the effects of qcd condensates , migdal found that the masses of the mesons in large @xmath6 qcd are proportional to roots of certain bessel functions , which is quite intriguing from the modern perspective , as was recently emphasized by shifman @xcite and voloshin @xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of this section to first give an overview of migdal s approach from nearly three decades ago and make precise the relation between ads / cft and the pad approximation of correlation functions .",
    "we will focus our discussion on the two - point function of conserved vector currents in a cft , although the construction can be generalized to arbitrary conformal tensors @xcite .",
    "two - point correlators of operators with arbitrary conformal dimension in the uv generally involve expressions of the form , @xmath57 the scale @xmath11 is a renormalization scale and @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the conformal dimension of the operator involved . for a conserved vector current ,",

    "the function @xmath65 has a branch cut which is taken to be along the positive real axis .",
    "this branch cut is approximated by a series of poles in the pad approximation , and the resonance masses are interpreted as the locations of the poles .",
    "the imaginary part of the function @xmath65 jumps by @xmath77 across the branch cut . at any location in the complex @xmath78-plane away from the positive real axis ,",
    "derivatives of the function @xmath79 are given by the cauchy integral formula along the path in fig  [ fig : cauchy ] .",

    "the integral over the large and small circles vanish ( for the orders of derivative we are considering ) , and the integrals above and below the branch cut cancel except for the change in the imaginary part of @xmath80 .",
    "what remains is given by , @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the change in @xmath65 across the branch cut .",
    "on the other hand , from ( [ pade ] ) we have @xmath83 the second term on the right hand side cancels the higher order terms in the taylor expansion of @xmath79 so that the result is a polynomial of degree @xmath10 . in our case , @xmath84 , and from ( [ qn ] ) and",
    "( [ eq : cauchy ] ) we obtain the following equations for @xmath74 : @xmath85 this set of conditions for @xmath74 is most transparent after doing the change of variables @xmath86 , @xmath87 and shifting @xmath88 @xmath89 this equation contains a product of two polynomials .",
    "the first one can be written as a sum over legendre polynomials @xmath90 where @xmath91 are calculable coefficients ( that we do not need ) .",
    "the second piece @xmath92 is some polynomial of degree @xmath10 in @xmath93 .",
    "this can be seen by realizing that @xmath94 is a polynomial of degree @xmath10 in @xmath95 , and so the factor @xmath96 removes all powers of @xmath97 in the denominator of the expansion of @xmath74 .",
    "legendre polynomials satisfy the orthogonality relation @xmath98 which combined with ( [ qn1 ] ) implies that we can identify the second piece ( [ second - piece ] ) as @xmath99 this identification is unique since ( [ qn1 ] ) with @xmath100 implies ( [ second - piece ] ) must be a polynomial of at least degree @xmath10 , but we already showed that ( [ second - piece ] ) is a polynomial of degree exactly @xmath10 . rewriting ( [ ident1-eq ] ) in terms of the original variable @xmath101 we obtain @xmath102 up to an overall normalization",
    ". the normalization does not affect the computation of the two - point function since it is canceled between the numerator and the denominator in ( [ pade0 ] ) .",
    "next , in order to make the pad approximation in ( [ pade0 ] ) as accurate as possible , migdal proposed taking @xmath103 and also the low energy limit @xmath104 , in which case the legendre polynomial reduces to a bessel function . this is most easily seen by rewriting the legendre polynomial as a special case of a jacobi polynomial @xmath105 and using the relation @xcite , @xmath106 therefore , in this limit with @xmath107 we have @xmath108 for completeness we have provided a derivation of ( [ qn3 ] ) in the appendix . here",
    "we see that , if we think of @xmath11 as the uv cutoff of the theory , then in the low energy and @xmath103 limit , a new , infrared scale emerges as @xmath109 .",
    "this infrared scale @xmath109 is not determined by the pad approximation .",
    "instead , it acts as a sort of boundary condition : we can take both the uv cutoff @xmath11 and the degree @xmath10 to infinity while keeping their ratio @xmath109 fixed , @xmath110 in sec .",
    "[ sec : deconstruct ] we will give these scales a concrete physical interpretation in the deconstructed picture .",
    "we can also calculate the numerator in the pad approximation using ( [ pm ] ) @xmath111 up to an overall constant which has been factored out of ( [ 2pt1 ] ) , the pad approximation for the polarization @xmath50 becomes , @xmath112 here we see that if we identify @xmath113 we recover exactly ( [ 2pt ] ) .",
    "what is interesting here is that we have obtained the same results as ads / cft for the two - point function , without reference to the anti - de sitter space and holography .",
    "furthermore , in the bulk - to - boundary propagator the correct dependence on the infrared boundary is reproduced in the pad approximation in the limit @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "we should emphasize that the @xmath103 limit is different from the large @xmath6 limit in a gauge theory ; in fact , migdal s starting point is already qcd in the large @xmath6 limit .",
    "it is instructive to look at the bulk - to - boundary propagator ( [ btob ] ) in ads / cft more closely , paying attention to the analytic structure of the bessel functions .",
    "the bessel function of the first kind , @xmath116 , is analytic and has no poles in the complex plane .",
    "near the origin it behaves like @xmath117 . on the other hand ,",
    "the bessel function of the second kind @xmath118 has the following series expansion , when @xmath119 is an integer , @xmath120 that is @xmath118 has a pole of order @xmath119 at the origin and a non - analytic piece @xmath121 .",
    "thus we see in ( [ btob ] ) the terms that are non - analytic in momentum @xmath122 conspire to cancel each other .",
    "both the numerator and denominator of the two - point function determined by ads / cft as in ( [ 2pt ] ) are analytic in the momentum @xmath122 .",
    "ads / cft is secretly constructing the pad approximation to the two - point function .",
    "the reason for this goes back to the large @xmath6 limit for which quantum corrections can be ignored in ads / cft .",
    "there is no source of non - analyticity at large @xmath6 , and resonances become simple poles in the two - point function .",
    "what we have found is that ads / cft gives the best approximation to the conformal behavior in the uv by means of a set of infinitely narrow resonances .",
    "in this section we show that , after breaking the conformal symmetry by adding power corrections to the two - point function in ( [ 2pt1 ] ) , pad approximation continues to reproduce the results of ads / cft .",
    "the motivation for such considerations stems from the well - known fact that in the deep euclidean region one can perform ope to the two - point function of vector currents in qcd , which exhibits a conformal behavior at leading order in @xmath123 .",
    "moreover , at subleading order the ope contains power corrections arising from various quark and gluon condensates @xcite . in the original publications @xcite migdal only considered breaking of the conformal symmetry due to the running of @xmath124 , the qcd coupling constant .",
    "we will see how to incorporate these power corrections in both the ads / cft and the pad approximation . in the context of ads",
    "/ qcd , such power corrections were recently considered in @xcite from a geometric perspective , which we will follow .",
    "power corrections arise from condensates of operators , so ads / cft instructs us to turn on a normalizable background for the 5d fields which act as the source for those operators @xcite . in order to reproduce the power corrections to correlators in the uv",
    ", we can add appropriate higher dimension operators to the 5d lagrangian , and then determine the consequences of these corrections in the ir @xcite .",
    "at lowest order in the chiral condensates , in @xcite it is shown that power corrections can be included in ads / cft instead by power law deviations from the ads metric near the uv boundary .",
    "more specifically , we consider the metric , @xmath125 where @xmath126 is a quantity with mass dimension @xmath127 and is assumed to be small compared to the ads length scale so that one can perform a perturbative expansion in @xmath126 .",
    "the bulk - to - boundary propagator @xmath33 satisfies the equation , @xmath128 with the ir boundary condition chosen to be @xmath38 as before , while the uv boundary condition fixes @xmath129 to some nonvanishing value .",

    "the extra factor @xmath156 arises from the fact that we are considering minkowski momentum , whereas @xcite considered the euclidean momentum .",
    "it is worth noting that @xmath160 , and hence @xmath161 , has the same infrared coefficient , @xmath51 , as @xmath162 , which implies that the position of the poles in the two - point function @xmath50 is not altered by the power corrections .",
    "that is the mass of the resonances in the cft is not sensitive to the power corrections at this order in perturbation theory and in the limit @xmath163 .",

    "next we discuss how to incorporate the effect of power corrections in migdal s regularization , which was not discussed in @xcite . as a matter of fact",
    ", it requires almost no effort to construct the pad approximation when including the power corrections to the conformal correlator ( [ 2pt1 ] ) , since the spirit of pad approximation is to use a ratio of polynomials and the power corrections @xmath166 are themselves in the canonical form of pad approximation .",
    "let us consider the following two - point function @xmath170 since we already know that the pad approximant to @xmath171 is @xmath172 , as discussed in the previous section , and the correction @xmath173 itself is already in the form of a pad approximant , we conclude that the pad approximant @xmath174 to @xmath50 is @xmath175 given the expression for @xmath176 and @xmath177 in ( [ qn3 ] ) and ( [ pn ] ) and the identifications in ( [ pade1 ] ) , we obtain for @xmath50 @xmath178 therefore we see that the pad approximation reproduces the result from ads / cft in ( [ 2pt4 ] ) in the limit @xmath179 , identifying @xmath180 .",
    "in our approach , the lowest order in @xmath181 simply yields a pole of order @xmath182 at @xmath183 to the pad approximant which obviously does not change the high energy behavior .",
    "however , the perturbative approach that we used here is not valid for @xmath184 , and thus the expression above including the spurious @xmath183 poles is not a valid description of the low - lying mass spectrum .",
    "indeed , in @xcite the shift in the mass for the low - lying hadrons are computed numerically and found to be non - zero .",
    "we have shown that migdal s approach using the pad approximation reproduces the two - point function obtained from maldacena s ads / cft correspondence . in both approaches the goal was to calculate at strong coupling",
    "; what is intriguing is that they both lead to the same approximation of the vector current - current correlator . in this section ,",
    "we propose an explicit correspondence between these two approaches .",
    "we propose that finite @xmath10 in the pad approximation is equivalent to @xmath10 hidden local symmetries @xcite that mock up the two - point function resonances , which in turn is just an @xmath10-site deconstruction @xcite of the ads space . in the context of qcd ,",
    "the idea of considering a large number of hidden local symmetries was discussed in @xcite and found to qualitatively and in some cases quantitatively agree with low energy data . here",
    "our observation is that the poles in the pad approximation can be interpreted as vector resonances .",
    "a pad approximant at finite @xmath10 order has @xmath10 poles , which correspond to @xmath10 vector resonances . using hidden local symmetry ,",
    "each massive vector is reinterpreted as a massive gauge boson of a broken gauge group .",
    "hence , @xmath10 massive vector resonances can be represented as a product gauge theory with @xmath10 broken gauge groups .",
    "furthermore , the residues at the poles of the resonances are positive @xcite , and can be understood as the decay constants of the resonances .    according to our proposal ,",
    "the resonance masses as determined by the pad approximation become the kaluza - klein masses of a gauge field in an extra dimension , so the product gauge theory described above is equivalent to a deconstructed extra dimension in the limit of a large number of lattice sites . in the deconstructed theory",
    ", the inverse lattice spacing roughly corresponds to the the uv scale @xmath11 , while the length of the ads space corresponds to @xmath12 .",
    "the limits ( [ limits - eq ] ) are equivalent to holding the length of the ads space fixed while taking the lattice spacing to zero , which in deconstruction corresponds to obtaining a continuous extra dimension .",
    "the masses as determined by the pad approximation are given by roots of jacobi polynomials , which may differ from a straightforward latticization of a slice of ads@xmath16 .",
    "hence , the regularization of the 5d gauge theory by a moose model based on the pad approximation differs from those discussed in @xcite , although only in the way in which it approaches the continuum theory . nevertheless , these identifications , as well as the fact that the spectrum obtained from the pad approximations matches the kaluza - klein spectrum of a 5d gauge field in a slice of the ads@xmath16 geometry , suggest it is natural to identify the large @xmath10 and low energy limit of the pad approximation with the continuum limit of a deconstructed radial direction of ads@xmath16 .    in ads",
    "/ qcd , a puzzle one might raise is the assumption that qcd , being asymptotically free and renormalizable , is equivalent to a 5d gauge theory , which is neither asymptotically free nor renormalizable . in this",
    "regard , pad approximation in the large @xmath10 and low energy limit provides a uv completion of the 5d gauge theory , since the linear moose theory is both asymptotically free and renormalizable . in other words , pad approximation provides a gauge invariant regularization of the 5d theory in which the masses are given by roots of jacobi polynomials .",
    "we should point out that the argument for the emergence of a deconstructed extra dimension is stronger than a simple identification of vector boson masses .",
    "the ads / cft prescription for computing the generating functionals in the cft arises from the deconstructed extra dimension in a natural way , as was first pointed out in @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the deconstructed theory that emerges from the pad approximation also predicts identical decay constants as the ads / cft . consider the following action for the @xmath10-site linear moose model @xmath185 where the covariant derivative is defined as @xmath186 with @xmath187",
    "the current - current correlators can be computed by first gauging the global symmetry on the zero@xmath188 site , where the cft lives , and then differentiating the action with respect to the gauge field @xmath189 : @xmath190}\\ ] ] where the gauge field at the boundary @xmath191 is non - dynamical . in the continuum limit",
    "this is equivalent to having a 5d gauge field @xmath192 with a fixed boundary condition @xmath193 furthermore , the action of the @xmath10-site moose @xmath194 becomes that of a 5d gauge theory in a slice of ads@xmath16 . at tree - level , the generating functional in ( [ func ] ) is simply @xmath195 } \\approx e^{is_{\\rm cl}[a_\\mu^{\\rm cl}]}\\ ] ] where @xmath196 is the solution to the classical field equation with the specified boundary condition ( [ bound ] ) .",
    "this is the same as the ads / cft prescription in ( [ pres ] ) : the generating functional for an operator in the cft is the same as the classical action of a bulk field whose boundary value serves as the source for the operator .",
    "the use of hidden local symmetry also makes it clear why a global symmetry carried by the vector resonances on the cft side must become a gauge symmetry in the ads picture .",
    "it is because each of these vector resonances realizes one copy of the hidden local symmetry at each lattice site .",
    "therefore in the continuum limit the gauge symmetry at each site becomes the gauge symmetry in the continuous extra dimension , which is the bulk of ads .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the equivalence of these two viewpoints is not a consequence of conformal symmetry , as exemplified by the discussion in the previous section when we break the conformal symmetry by adding power corrections .",
    "following suggestions by shifman @xcite and voloshin @xcite , we have studied the striking similarity between two approaches to estimating the bound state spectrum and decay constants in asymptotically conformal field theories : one that was invented by migdal in the 70s and the other making use of the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "the latter approach was recently applied to qcd , the input being the ads / cft correspondence and chiral symmetry breaking",
    ". the similarity of results based on holography and results based on other approximations may provide additional insight into the predictive success of the ads / qcd models .    in migdal",
    "s pad approximation to the conformal two - point correlation functions , the @xmath197 order approximation gives rise to a series of @xmath10 poles whose locations are interpreted as resonance masses ; the residues of those poles are related to the decay constants of those resonances .",
    "migdal found that the approach to the logarithmic branch cut as @xmath10 is increased is through poles whose locations are proportional to zeroes of jacobi polynomials , which approach bessel functions in the large @xmath10 limit .",
    "power corrections to the correlation function at leading order do not modify the spectrum or the decay constants in the limit @xmath198 . in the ads",
    "/ cft approach , the geometry is approximated by a slice of 5d anti - de sitter space , whose isometry near the ads boundary reproduces the conformal symmetry of the corresponding field theory in the uv .",
    "solutions to the equations of motion for 5d fields correspond to resonances .",
    "the ads geometry leads to vector meson masses that are zeroes of bessel functions , which match the result of the pad approximation to the conformal two - point functions after identifying the ir scales in both approaches .",
    "power corrections are included by modification of the ads geometry , which leads to a modification of the decay constants once again in agreement with the pad approximation .",
    "migdal s approach is similar in spirit to qcd sum rules @xcite : the input is high energy information about qcd in the form of the operator product expansion , together with some assumptions about the dynamics of chiral symmetry breaking and confinement ; and the output is low energy information about hadrons such as their spectrum , decay constants and couplings .",
    "ads / qcd is similar in spirit as well , where the prescription for extrapolating between uv and ir is dictated by the dynamics of a higher dimensional field theory in ads space .",
    "we find it remarkable that migdal s method via the pad approximation is exactly equivalent to the holographic prescription from ads / cft , at least for the vector current two - point function .",
    "we mainly concentrated on two - point functions of vector currents in this paper .",
    "it is natural to ask whether the equivalence between the approaches of migdal and ads / cft persists beyond two - point functions and if from migdal s approach one could derive the higher dimensional theory in a systematic fashion . in terms of extending the range of validity of a holographic dual of qcd in a phenomenological approach such as ads / qcd",
    ", there are still many hurdles to overcome . for example , a simple argument ( see for example @xcite ) for the regge trajectory of qcd suggests that at high energies the mass of the @xmath197 excited hadron is proportional to @xmath199 , whereas in ads / qcd models the mass is generically proportional to @xmath10 for highly excited states . on the other hand",
    ", the bulk metric must always approach ads near the boundary in order to reproduce the conformal symmetry .",
    "it would be interesting to find an ads / qcd model that would give rise to the required regge trajectory and the asymptotic conformal behavior at the same time .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : deconstruct ] we saw that , by combining the ideas of hidden local symmetry and deconstruction , the resonances determined by the pad approximation can be interpreted as arising from a linear moose model .",
    "we discussed that the moose model becomes a deconstructed warped extra dimension when the number of resonances becomes large .",
    "we further showed that this extra dimension can be identified with the radial direction of anti - de sitter space .",
    "it is interesting to ask what would happen if we applied the same setup to the two - point function of stress - energy tensors in the cft . in this case",
    ", there is a tower of massive spin-2 resonances in the pad approximation .",
    "a massive spin-2 particle can be thought of as a massive graviton , realizing a copy of broken 4d diffeomorphism invariance .",
    "therefore a theory for @xmath10 massive spin-2 resonances might be interpreted in terms of an @xmath10-site latticized extra dimension with gravity . however",
    ", a deconstructed gravitational theory is very different from a deconstructed gauge theory as the latticized gravity suffers from a strong coupling problem @xcite in such way that the effective @xmath10-site theory breaks down at a much lower scale than might naively be expected .",
    "it was recently found that in the ads space , the strong coupling problem is not as severe as in flat space @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to consider strong coupling issues from the perspective of the pad approximation .",
    "an approach like this for the spin-2 resonances might lead to a better understanding of how a gravitational theory can be equivalent to a field theory in fewer dimensions without gravity .",
    "this work was inspired by shifman and voloshin s comments on migdal s work , which we acknowledge .",
    "we benefited from conversations with juan maldacena , veronica sanz , and lior silberman .",
