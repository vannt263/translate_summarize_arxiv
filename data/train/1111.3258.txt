    "during the last decade , both theoretical and experimental studies on heavy mesons have received considerable attention .",
    "studying the properties of bottom - strange orbitally excited states can provide tests for various models of quark bound states@xcite .",
    "recently , two orbitally excited narrow @xmath3 mesons are reported by the cdf collaboration with masses @xmath4 and @xmath5 @xcite , which are assigned as the @xmath6 doublet states in the heavy quark effective theory @xcite .",
    "the d0 collaboration confirmed the @xmath7 state with mass @xmath8 in fully reconstructed decays to @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath10 states with spin - parity @xmath11 still lack experimental evidence because they are supposed to be broad decaying through an @xmath12-wave transition .    based on the potential quark models , heavy quark effective theory , and lattice qcd @xcite , masses of the @xmath10 mesons with @xmath13 have been estimated .",
    "with qcd sum rules @xcite , wang studies masses of the bottomed @xmath13 mesons .",
    "the calculation indicates that the central values are below the corresponding @xmath14 and @xmath15 thresholds respectively , which is just like the case of their charmed cousins @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "this prediction is compatible with speculation in refs .",
    "@xcite . for this reason , the strong decay of @xmath18",
    "is not predicted to occur . as a consequence ,",
    "the width of @xmath19 is very narrow since the main decay channel for this state is isospin symmetry violating @xmath20 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the isospin - violating strong decay width of @xmath19 is calculated , which is around several tens of kev .",
    "knowledge of the heavy - heavy - light mesons vertices is of crucial importance to estimate the strength of the hadron interactions .",
    "they are fundamental objects of low energy qcd . on the experimental side ,",
    "the excited @xmath3 mesons will be copiously accumulated at the cern lhc , which makes investigations of their decay characters promising .",
    "their coupling constants can bring important constraints in constructing the meson - meson potentials and help us to analyze results of existing experiments in the framework of the meson exchange model  @xcite .",
    "for example , faessler @xmath21 used a phenomenological lagrangian approach to calculate the strong and radiative decay of the @xmath10 doublets with @xmath22 , which were considered as bound states of the @xmath23 and @xmath24 mesons respectively  @xcite . in the process of their calculation ,",
    "the coupling constant of @xmath25 vertex was an necessary input parameter .",
    "however , such low - energy hadron interaction lie in a region which is very far away from the perturbative regime , precluding us to use the perturbative approach with the fundamental qcd lagrangian .",
    "therefore , we need some non - perturbative approaches , such as qcd sum rules @xcite , to deal with processes relevant to hadron physics . taking the point of view that the bottomed @xmath13 mesons @xmath26 and @xmath19 are the conventional @xmath27 mesons , strong coupling constants @xmath28 and @xmath29 are calculated with the light - cone qcd sum rules @xcite .",
    "the bottomed @xmath30 meson @xmath26 is identified with the conventional @xmath27 meson and @xmath31 vertex has been calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this article , the form factor and the coupling constant of the @xmath0 vertex",
    "is calculated in the framework of the three - point qcd sum rules . in the calculations we use the same technique developed in the previous works for the evaluation of the coupling constants in the vetices @xmath32 @xcite , @xmath33 @xcite , @xmath34 @xcite , @xmath35 , @xmath36 @xcite , @xmath37 @xcite , @xmath38 @xcite , @xmath39 @xcite and @xmath40  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we give the details of the qcd sum rules for the considered vertex when both @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons are off - shell . sec . [ sec3 ] is devoted to the numerical analysis and we compare them with results obtained in other works .",
    "in this section , we obtain qcd sum rules for the form factor of the @xmath41 vertex .",
    "the three - point function associated with the @xmath41 vertex , for an off - shell @xmath1 meson , is given by @xmath42 where the interpolating currents are @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 .",
    "the correlation function for an off - shell @xmath46 meson is @xmath47 with the interpolating currents @xmath44 , @xmath48 , and @xmath45 . in the expressions , @xmath49 is the transferred momentum .    the general expression for eq . ( [ correboff ] )",
    "has fourteen independent lorentz structures , which can be decomposed in terms of the invariant amplitudes associated with each of these tensor structures in the following form : @xmath50 in principle , we can work with any dirac structure appearing in eqs .",
    "( [ trace ] ) . however , there are still some points which one must follow : ( i ) the chosen structure must appear in the phenomenological side .",
    "( ii ) the chosen structure should exhibit good ope convergence .",
    "( iii ) the chosen structure should have a stability that guarantees a good match between the two sides of the sum rule .",
    "after some calculations , we find that the structures which obey these points are @xmath51 in the case of @xmath1 off - shell , and @xmath52 in the case of k off - shell .    in order to get the sum rules , the correlation functions need to be calculated in two different ways : in phenomenological or physical side ,",
    "they are presented in terms of hadronic parameters such as masses , leptonic decay constants and the form factor ; in theoretical or qcd side , they are evaluated in terms of qcd degrees of freedom via operator product expansion ( ope ) in deep euclidean region .",
    "the sum rules for the form factors are obtained with both representations being matched , invoking the quark - hadron global duality and equating the coefficient of a sufficient structure from both sides of the same correlation functions . to improve the matching between the two representations , double borel transformation with respect to the variables , @xmath53 and @xmath54 ,",
