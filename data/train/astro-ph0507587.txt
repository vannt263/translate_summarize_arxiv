    "in an attempt to understand the molecular content and physical characteristics of interstellar gas in the low galactic halo , we exploit infrared and ultraviolet data from two nasa satellites : the _ infrared astronomical satellite _ ( _ iras _ ) mission of 1983 and the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _  ( _ fuse _ ) satellite of 19992005 . the combination of infrared emission and ultraviolet absorption along sight lines to 45 active galactic nuclei ( agn ) allows us to correlate the infrared cirrus emission intensity with the molecular hydrogen ( h@xmath1 ) absorption column density at select locations at high galactic latitude .    _",
    "iras _  mapped the sky in four infrared bands centered on 12 , 25 , 60 , and 100  @xmath0 m .",
    "low et  al .  ( 1984 ) introduced one of the most surprising results from the _ iras _",
    "maps : diffuse filamentary dust clouds that pervade our galaxy at high latitudes , even in the direction of the galactic poles .",
    "these  infrared cirrus \" clouds are most prominent at long wavelengths , 100  @xmath0 m , but some can be seen in the 60  @xmath0 m , 25  @xmath0 m , and 12  @xmath0 m bands .",
    "comparisons between _ iras _  dust maps and maps of 21  cm emission reveal a generally good correlation between neutral hydrogen ( hartmann & burton 1997 ) and cirrus dust filaments ( figure 1 ) . because molecular hydrogen ( h@xmath1 ) forms catalytically on the surface of dust grains ( hollenbach , werner , & salpeter 1971 ) , with significant formation rates for grain temperatures @xmath16  k and gas temperatures @xmath17  k ( hollenbach & mckee 1979 ; shull & beckwith 1982 ) , the cold , dusty conditions of the infrared cirrus clouds are favorable for the formation of h@xmath1 .",
    "thus , it is plausible that some fraction of the hydrogen atoms in the cirrus clouds are bound into molecules .",
    "previously , the presence of h@xmath1  in infrared cirrus was inferred indirectly .",
    "first , under the assumption that the infrared emission and total hydrogen column density , n@xmath3 , are proportional , regions of high dust/ ratio , termed  infrared excess \" , were attributed to the presence of h@xmath1  ( de  vries , heithausen , & thaddeus 1987 ; desert , bazell , & boulanger 1988 ; reach , koo , & heiles 1994 ; moritz et  al .  1998 ; schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis 1998 , hereafter sfd98 ) .",
    "second , the detection of co in dense cirrus clouds suggests that the diffuse cirrus clouds should contain h@xmath1  as well .",
    "weiland et  al .",
    "( 1986 ) compared co maps from magnani , blitz , & mundy ( 1985 ) to _ iras _  maps of infrared cirrus .",
    "each of the 33 co clouds had a cirrus counterpart with similar morphology .",
    "this work established that at least some of the infrared cirrus cloud cores contains co gas .",
    "unfortunately , there is currently no experiment that can map diffuse h@xmath1  emission , either in the 2.12  @xmath0 m [ ( 10 ) s(1 ) ] vibrational line or in the s(0 ) , s(1 ) , s(2 ) pure rotational lines at 28  @xmath0 m , 17  @xmath0 m , and 12  @xmath0 m , respectively .",
    "although h@xmath1  is over @xmath18 times more abundant than co , the ultraviolet and infrared fluorescent emission of h@xmath1  is very weak .",
    "ultraviolet absorption - line spectroscopy is therefore the primary means for detecting cold h@xmath1  in diffuse clouds .",
    "however , it requires background sources with sufficient uv flux to provide adequate signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) to detect the weak h@xmath1  lines .",
    "the first major project to conduct such observations was the _ copernicus _ mission of the 1970s ( spitzer & jenkins 1975 ) . however , its sensitivity limited the possible background sources to early - type stars within about 500  pc of the sun .",
    "most ob stars that fit this criterion are at low galactic latitude , and they suffer from confusion and dust extinction in the galactic plane .",
    "individual features in the infrared cirrus can not be discerned at low galactic latitudes , and these stellar sight lines are not effective probes of the dusty filaments .",
    "the _ fuse _  satellite , which has been observing the ultraviolet sky since 1999 , has expanded the opportunities for detecting h@xmath1 .",
    "the increased sensitivity of _ fuse _  ( @xmath19mag ) over _ copernicus _ ( @xmath20mag ) allows us to use more distant stars as well as active galactic nuclei ( agn ) as background sources .",
    "our _ fuse _  survey of h@xmath1  toward high - latitude agn ( gillmon et  al.2005 ) is particularly well suited for probing h@xmath1  in infrared cirrus .",
    "the high - latitude sight lines avoid the confusion of the galactic disk , and they provide long path lengths through the galactic halo .",
    "in addition , the random distribution of agn on the sky samples a range of infrared cirrus emission intensities . the main limitation of using  pencil - beam \" ( absorption ) sight lines to detect h@xmath1  in infrared cirrus is the inability to determine whether the gas and dust detected along a given sight line are physically associated .",
    "therefore , we must rely on indirect correlations between cirrus and h@xmath1  absorption .    in this paper",
    ", we compare the h@xmath1  column densities in the survey by gillmon et  al .",
    "( 2005 ) with the corresponding infrared cirrus fluxes ( sfd98 ) . by establishing a correlation between the two ,",
    "we assert that at least some of the detected h@xmath1  resides in the cirrus clouds . in ",
    "2 we describe the data acquisition and analysis for both _ iras _  and _ fuse_. in   3",
    "we compare the cirrus emission and h@xmath1   absorption and discuss the correlation of the two .",
    "exploiting this correlation and summing over the distribution of h@xmath1  column densities with 100 @xmath0 m cirrus intensity , we estimate the total h@xmath1  mass ( @xmath21 ) in cirrus clouds around the milky way . with molecular fractions ranging from 130% , the total cirrus mass throughout the milky way",
    "is @xmath22 . in ",
    "4 we summarize our results and the implications of finding this amount of gas in the low halo of the milky way .",
    "the h@xmath1  absorption data were taken from _ fuse _  spectra of agn , using standard data analysis techniques ( tumlinson et  al .  2002 ; gillmon et  al .",
    "studies of h@xmath1  have been a major part of the _ fuse _  science plan .",

    "the resolution of _ fuse _  varies from @xmath23 across the far - uv band .",
    "all observations were obtained in time - tag ( ttag ) mode , using the @xmath24 lwrs aperture , with resolution @xmath25 km  s@xmath8  at 1050  .",
    "the s / n of the co - added data ranges from 211 per pixel ; the s / n per resolution element varies with spectral resolution , which is not fixed in our survey .",
    "most of the data were binned by 4 pixels before analysis , with the rare case of binning by 2 or 8 pixels .",
    "the data in this paper were taken from our high - latitude h@xmath1   survey ( gillmon et  al .",
    "2005 ) , which describes our search for h@xmath1   absorption along 45 sight lines to background agn at galactic latitudes @xmath26 . the 45 agn in the survey by gillmon et  al .",
    "( 2005 ) were a subset of the 219 _ fuse _ targets selected in wakker et  al .",
    "( 2003 ) as candidates for the analysis of galactic ovi .",
    "these targets probe diffuse gas in both the local galactic disk and low galactic halo . of the available agn at high latitude ,",
    "45 sight lines were chosen , based on an imposed s / n requirement of @xmath27 or @xmath28 with 4-pixel binning .",
    "the observed h@xmath1  lines arise from the lyman and werner electronic transitions , from the ground electronic state , x  @xmath29 , to the excited states , b  @xmath30 ( lyman bands ) and c  @xmath31 ( werner bands ) .",
    "the rotational - vibrational lines arise from the ground vibrational state and a range of rotational states .",
    "our analysis was restricted to ten vibrational - rotational bands , lyman ( 00 ) to ( 80 ) and werner ( 00 ) , which are located between 1000  @xmath32 and 1126  @xmath32 .",
    "the vibrational state notation is ( @xmath33 ) . in most sight lines ,",
    "we observed absorption lines from rotational states @xmath343 , and sometimes up to @xmath35 .",
    "the end product of the h@xmath1  absorption - line analysis is the column density , n@xmath11   ( @xmath36 ) , the physical density of h@xmath1  molecules , integrated along the sight line .",
    "each absorption line was fitted with a voigt profile in order to determine the equivalent width , a measure of the absorbed light in the line .",
    "the equivalent widths were fitted to a curve of growth , to find the column density , n@xmath37 in each rotational state @xmath38 .",
    "the points for each @xmath38 were tied together during the fitting to produce a single , consistent column density for each rotational state , n(@xmath38 ) .",
    "the sum of the column densities in all rotational states then gives the total column density , n@xmath11 .",
    "fuse spectra of 87% ( 39 of 45 ) of the observed agn showed detectable h@xmath1  absorption , with column densities ranging from n@xmath11  @xmath39  @xmath36 .",
    "the _ fuse _  survey is sensitive to n@xmath11  @xmath40  @xmath36 , depending on the s / n ( 211 per pixel ) and spectral resolution ( @xmath4120,000 ) .      to obtain infrared cirrus emission intensities ( mjy  sr@xmath8 ) , we use the 100  @xmath0 m maps presented by sfd98 .",
    "these were a composite of data from the _ iras _  mission of 1983 and the _ cobe _ mission of 19891990 , capitalizing on the strengths of each .",
    "because the interstellar dust emits like a  grey body \" , the emission intensity is sensitive to the dust temperature . as a result ,",
    "two regions with the same dust column density but different dust temperatures will have different infrared intensities .",
    "to correct for this effect , sfd98 used the ratio of the 100  @xmath0 m and 240  @xmath0 m _ cobe _ maps to produce a map of dust color temperature .",
    "they used this ratio to correct the 100  @xmath0 m _ iras _  map so that it is proportional to dust column density .",
    "_ iras _  mapped the sky in four broadband infrared channels , centered at 12 , 25 , 60 , and 100 @xmath0 m with a resolution of @xmath42 , while _ cobe _ mapped the sky in 10 broad photometric bands from 1 to 240 @xmath0 m at a resolution of @xmath43 . before combining the data sets , sfd98 took great care in the difficult removal of the zodiacal foreground emission and _ iras _  striping artifacts that arise from differences in solar elongation between scans . confirmed point sources",
    "were also removed .",
    "the maps were combined in such a way as to preserve the _ cobe _",
    "calibration and _ iras _  resolution .",
    "maps of the temperature - corrected 100  @xmath0 m intensity , @xmath44 , are presented for the northern galactic hemisphere ( figure 2 ) and for the southern galactic hemisphere ( figure 3 ) .",
    "we overplot the locations of the 45 sight lines from the _ fuse _",
    "h@xmath1  survey : 28 northern agn and 17 southern agn .",
    "before the _ fuse _  mission , the direct detection of h@xmath1  in infrared cirrus by uv absorption - line spectroscopy was prevented mainly by a lack of background sources at high galactic latitude . even though this problem has been alleviated by _",
    "s ability to observe bright agn as background sources , another problem with absorption - line spectroscopy along  pencil - beam \" sight lines comes to the forefront .",
    "absorption studies lack morphological information and can not provide distances to clouds along the line of sight .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to identify the gas that gives rise to the detected column density . the infrared cirrus problem is a classic case . for any given sight line ,",
    "it is possible that the h@xmath1  absorption is not physically associated with the infrared cirrus along the beam .",
    "if this is the case , then comparing n@xmath11  with the cirrus dust column density would lead to erroneous results .",
    "it would be helpful to determine whether the diffuse h@xmath1  along all sight lines resides in the cirrus .",
    "if no other component of the diffuse ism harbored significant amounts of h@xmath1 , then n@xmath11  for a given sight line could safely be associated with other cirrus properties .    in this section",
    ", we investigate this possibility , based on a property of h@xmath1  called  self - shielding \" .",
    "following line absorption of uv photons from the mean interstellar radiation field , h@xmath1  decays approximately 11% of the time to the dissociative continuum . as a result ,",
    "the molecular fraction , @xmath46 is generally larger in clouds with a greater total hydrogen column density , n@xmath3 = n@xmath47  + 2n@xmath11 .",
    "molecules on the outside of the cloud shield those in the interior from dissociating uv ( hollenbach , werner , & salpeter 1971 ; black & dalgarno 1976 ; browning , tumlinson , & shull 2003 ) .    in optically thin clouds",
    ", the density of molecules can be approximated by the equilibrium between formation and destruction , @xmath48 in this formula , the numerical value for @xmath2 is scaled to fiducial values of hydrogen density , @xmath49 ( 30 @xmath10 ) , h@xmath1formation rate coefficient , @xmath50 ( @xmath51 @xmath52  s@xmath8 ) , and mean h@xmath1  pumping rate in the fuv lyman and werner bands , @xmath53 s@xmath8 .",
    "the h@xmath1  photodissociation rate is written as @xmath54 , where the coefficient @xmath55 is the average fraction of fuv excitations of h@xmath1  that result in decays to the dissociating continuum .",
    "the h@xmath1  formation rate per unit volume is written as @xmath56 , where the coefficient @xmath50 depends on the gas temperature , grain surface temperature , and gas metallicity ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "the metallicity dependence comes from the assumed scaling of grain - surface catalysis sites with the grain / gas ratio . for sight lines in the local galactic disk ,",
    "this rate coefficient has been estimated ( jura 1974 ) to range from @xmath58 @xmath52  s@xmath8 at solar metallicity . this standard value for @xmath50",
    "is expected to apply at suitably low temperatures of gas ( @xmath59  k ) and grains ( @xmath60  k ) as discussed by shull & beckwith ( 1982 ) and hollenbach & mckee ( 1979 ) .",
    "the effects of self - shielding were observed by plotting @xmath2 versus n@xmath3 , the total column density of hydrogen .",
    "as h@xmath1   absorption lines in the lyman and werner bands become optically thick , the rate ( @xmath61 ) of uv pumping and molecular dissociation diminish . in this way , the presence of h@xmath1   screens molecules in the inner portions of the cloud from dissociation . a transition from low ( @xmath62 ) to high ( @xmath63 ) molecular fractions at n@xmath64  @xmath36",
    "was noted in the _ copernicus _",
    "h@xmath1  survey ( savage et  al .  1977 ) .",
    "a recent _ fuse _  survey of galactic disk stars ( shull et  al .",
    "2005 ) provided similar results ( figure 4 ) .    in assessing the molecular content of the cirrus",
    ", we consider three generic cases .",
    "the first possibility ( case  i ) is that all the detected h@xmath1 resides in cirrus clouds , with no contribution from foreground clouds . under the assumption that the total hydrogen density , @xmath65 , is proportional to the number density of dust grains in",
    "any given interstellar cloud ( hollenbach & mckee 1979 ) , the cirrus dust column density should be proportional to the amount of n@xmath66 associated with h@xmath1 . a plot of n@xmath11  vs.  dust column density",
    "should then show the familiar self - shielding transition of molecular hydrogen . in case",
    "ii , some of the observed h@xmath1  lies in the cirrus , but some resides in another component of the ism not visible in the cirrus maps .",
    "a plot of n@xmath11  vs.  dust column density would show some points that follow the self - shielding transition ( those corresponding to cirrus ) .",
    "however , the transition would be broadened by points that are randomly distributed .",
    "if a significant portion of the detected h@xmath1along a sight line is not in cirrus , n@xmath11  will not correlate with dust column density .",
    "this effect would produce sight lines with low dust column density and significant amounts of h@xmath1 .",
    "the extreme situation is case  iii , in which none of the h@xmath1  resides in cirrus clouds .",
    "we consider this unlikely , given the number of observed regions with  infrared excess \" ( high dust / n@xmath47  ratios ) and the detection of co in denser cirrus clouds .",
    "once the n@xmath11  in cirrus exceeds @xmath67",
    "@xmath36 , it should be detectable by _",
    "fuse_. for case  iii to be consistent with our survey , the covering fraction of cirrus regions with detectable h@xmath1  would need to be quite small , whereas the cirrus covering factor is observed to be @xmath5% at @xmath6 ( see   3.4 ) .",
    "the issue then comes down to whether case i or case ii is a better description of the cirrus - h@xmath1  correlation .",
    "figure 5 presents a plot of n@xmath11  along sight lines to the 45 agn in the _ fuse _  survey vs.  the temperature - corrected ir flux at each location from the sfd98 maps ( blue diamonds ) .",
    "if the temperature - corrected flux is proportional to dust column density , this plot can be used to test the three cases mentioned above .",
    "the blue diamonds appear to show the self - shielding transition discussed in case i , implying that much of the detected h@xmath1  is in the cirrus .      in this section , we describe five additional sight lines shown in red ( figure 5 ) toward the regions of lowest cirrus .",
    "these additional sight lines were chosen to explore whether the correlation between n@xmath11and 100  @xmath0",
    "m cirrus is universal .",
    "table 5 of sfd98 lists the coordinates of the regions of lowest ( temperature - corrected ) 100 @xmath0 m intensity , @xmath44 , from their maps .",
    "we searched the _ fuse _  archive for targets within @xmath68 of the given coordinates and found five targets behind regions of low cirrus ( @xmath69 mjysr@xmath8 ) that also had _ fuse _",
    "data with sufficient ( s / n)@xmath70 to conduct an h@xmath1  analysis .",
    "these five targets are in addition to those in the gillmon et  al .",
    "( 2005 ) sample of 45 agn .",
    "they are listed in table 1 and shown as asterisks in figure 5 .",
    "four of these five targets showed no evidence of h@xmath1 , with a typical upper limit of n@xmath11  @xmath71  @xmath36 .",
    "this result lends further credence to the theory that most of the observed h@xmath1  is in the cirrus ( case i )",
    ". however , one target , ugc5720 , showed significant h@xmath1  absorption lines ( figure 6 ) .",
    "an analysis , as described in   2.1 , yielded a significant column density n@xmath11  @xmath72  @xmath36 . in   3.3 ,",
    "we explore possible explanations for this anomalous sight line and for the spread in the self - shielding transition .",
    "figure 5 plots n@xmath11  vs.  temperature - corrected intensity , @xmath44 ( mjysr@xmath8 ) , and exhibits a clear self - shielding transition of h@xmath1 .",
    "this indicates that a significant fraction of the detected h@xmath1  resides in the infrared cirrus .",
    "however , with small - number statistics on 50 agn sight lines , the transition is not sharp , occurring between log  @xmath44 = 0.20.5 .",
    "there is one outlying point ( ugc5720 ) with low cirrus intensity , log  @xmath73 , but a significant column density , log  n@xmath11  @xmath74 .",
    "this outlier suggests that not all the detected h@xmath1  resides in cirrus clouds , and that other components of the diffuse gas may harbor detectable amounts of molecules .    in some sight lines that intercept non - cirrus clouds with low 100  @xmath0 m intensity , the gas may undergo an early molecular transition and appear with higher n@xmath11",
    "there are other explanations that might produce the same effects , even if all the h@xmath1 resides in cirrus clouds .",
    "one consideration is how well the temperature - corrected flux map traces the dust column density .",
    "to correct for temperature variations , sfd98 created a temperature map from the ratio of the _ cobe _ 100  @xmath0 m and 240  @xmath0 m maps .",
    "thus , low - resolution ( 1.1@xmath75 ) temperature maps were used to correct the @xmath76 resolution _ iras _  map to produce a 100  @xmath0 m map at @xmath77 resolution .",
    "it is likely that the dust temperature varies on smaller scales than can be resolved by this method , and a more accurate temperature correction might tighten the self - shielding transition .",
    "it is also possible that ugc5720 lies behind a region of cold cirrus dust unresolved by the temperature map .",
    "thus , a significant portion of the dust column density might not be indicated by the observed flux .",
    "a related consideration is that the _ iras _  map might not resolve significant variations in dust column density .",
    "the sight lines observed by _ fuse _  absorption probe gas along a very narrow beam , while the _ iras _",
    "beam is considerably larger .",
    "thus , if there were significant structure on smaller scales than the _ iras _  beam , _ fuse _  could observe a denser clump of h@xmath1  while the _ iras _",
    "emission would be  beam - diluted \" .",
    "a higher resolution infrared map might tighten the self - shielding transition and/or bring the outlier ugc5720 onto the correlation . figure 7 shows a @xmath78 section of the sfd98 flux map centered on ugc5720 .",
    "large fluctuations in temperature - corrected flux near the position of the agn suggest that the sight line may be picking up a clump of cirrus with higher dust column density unresolved by these maps .",
    "finally , there is the possibility that there are multiple cirrus features superimposed along a line of sight .",
    "duel & burton ( 1990 ) compared the morphology of cirrus clouds and h  i maps in various velocity intervals to show that cirrus features that appear simple are , in some cases , superpositions of kinematically distinct components .",
    "this idea of a  concatenation of clouds \" was proposed for translucent h@xmath1  clouds ( browning et  al .",
    "2003 ) to explain the high levels of h@xmath1  rotational excitation in systems with large n@xmath11 .",
    "these authors suggested that , if a sight line intercepts multiple , physically distinct cloud components , the h@xmath1  will be exposed to a radiation field enhanced over that expected for a single , contiguous cloud with the same total column density .",
    "the enhanced h@xmath1  destruction rate from the stronger uv radiation would reduce the mean molecular fraction and produce a gradual transition to higher n@xmath11 .",
    "some sight lines with seemingly high dust column density , but low n@xmath11 , may actually be probing multiple , superimposed filaments with high integrated dust column density .      with the empirical correlation ( figure 5 ) between ir cirrus and h@xmath1   column density , we can make a quantitative estimate of the h@xmath1  mass in the diffuse cirrus clouds .",
    "we begin with the _ iras _",
    "maps of the northern galactic hemisphere .",
    "we assume that these cirrus clouds lie at elevation @xmath79 above the milky way plane , and that clouds of intensity @xmath80 cover a fraction @xmath81 of the planar area at @xmath82 .",
    "the total h@xmath1  mass in this planar cloud deck is then , @xmath83 \\left [ \\frac { \\langle f_c \\rangle }           { 0.5 } \\right ] z_{100}^2    \\ ; , \\ ] ] where n@xmath11@xmath84 is the mean h@xmath1  column density corresponding to cirrus intensity @xmath80 ( figure 5 ) and where @xmath85 is the radius of the cirrus disk , at elevation @xmath86 subtended by the cone at @xmath87 . for this estimate",
    ", we have assumed that the cirrus covers a fraction @xmath88 of the sky at @xmath82 , independent of intensity .",
    "we now make a more careful calculation , summing over the actual data from _ iras _  and _ fuse_. figure 8 shows the distribution of cirrus covering factors , @xmath81 , averaged over northern hemisphere regions with @xmath89 greater than @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 , respectively . for our fiducial cone at @xmath82 ,",
    "approximately 50% of the sky is covered by cirrus with intensity log  @xmath93 , the value corresponding to the h@xmath1  transition ( figure 5 ) .",
    "performing the full summation ( eq .",
    "3 ) over 8 logarithmic intensity bins above the transition , of width @xmath94(log  @xmath80 ) = 0.1 , between log  @xmath95 and 1.0 , we find a total h@xmath1  mass of @xmath96 contained in the cirrus at @xmath82 .    to convert this calculation to the inner milky way , within the solar circle , we multiply by a factor @xmath97 , for the northern and southern galactic hemispheres , and scale by a factor @xmath98 to account for the number of similar conical areas around the galactic disk . note that this total h@xmath1  mass is independent of the assumed cirrus elevation , @xmath86 , since the area - scaling cancels the factor @xmath99 in equation ( 3 ) .",
    "we arrive at an extrapolated total molecular mass over the inner milky way , @xmath100 , assuming that the cirrus along the agn sightlines at @xmath6 is typical .",
    "the molecular fractions of these cirrus clouds , with n@xmath11  @xmath101  @xmath36 , range from 130% for log  @xmath44 = 0.20.5 ( see figure 6 of gillmon et  al .",
    "2005 ) , with an average @xmath102 for clouds with log  n@xmath11  @xmath103 .",
    "therefore , we estimate the total gas mass in the cirrus to be @xmath104 .",
    "the characteristics of the cirrus clouds along our agn sight lines can be verified by computing the  dust - to - gas \" ratio , defined as the ratio of 100  @xmath0 m cirrus intensity , @xmath44 ( mjy  sr@xmath8 ) , to h  i column density , n@xmath47  ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "table 2 gives these values and their ratio for 16 of our agn sight lines observed in 21  cm ( lockman & savage 1995 ) .",
    "this ratio ranges from @xmath105 mjy  sr@xmath8  @xmath106 toward pg  0953 + 414 to @xmath107 mjy  sr@xmath8  @xmath106 toward 3c  273 .",
    "the mean value and standard deviation are @xmath108 mjy  sr@xmath8  @xmath106 , when we exclude the anomalous sight line to 3c  273 , which lies behind radio loop i and the north polar spur .",
    "this mean ratio is in excellent agreement with the mean value , @xmath109 mjy  sr@xmath8  @xmath106 , found by boulanger , baud , & van albada ( 1985 ) in a @xmath110 field at high galactic latitude .",
    "we have undertaken a comparison between the column density , n@xmath11 , and the 100  @xmath0 m cirrus intensity for a total of 50 sight lines . for the cirrus",
    ", we used the temperature - corrected maps of schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis ( 1998 ) , and adopted h@xmath1  column densities from our high - latitude survey ( gillmon et  al .",
    "the presence of a clear correlation between uv ( h@xmath1 ) absorption and ir ( cirrus ) emission indicates that a significant fraction of the h@xmath1   is physically associated with the cirrus clouds .",
    "however , the self - shielding transition of h@xmath1  fraction used to define the correlation is not sharp .",
    "the existence of one outlying sight line suggests either that some of the detected h@xmath1 may exist in another component of the diffuse ism , or that the limited resolution of the infrared maps is obscuring the physical conditions .",
    "of the three possible cases for h@xmath1cirrus connections laid out in   3.1 ,",
    "case i or ii best describe the data .    put simply , h@xmath1  is contained in most , if not all diffuse cirrus clouds . at galactic latitudes",
    "@xmath6 , approximately 50% of the sky is covered with cirrus , at temperature - corrected 100 @xmath0 m intensities @xmath7 mjy  sr@xmath8 . with this correlation , we have found a convenient means of identifying the best extragalactic sight lines for  h@xmath1-clean \" far - uv absorption studies of intergalactic or interstellar matter .",
    "conversely , if the goal is to study h@xmath1   at the disk - halo interface , the cirrus maps would be a good guide .",
    "we also made a rough estimate of the h@xmath1  mass contained in these cirrus clouds . exploiting the h@xmath1cirrus correlation",
    ", we summed the distributions of ir cirrus intensity and h@xmath1   column density to find @xmath21 in cirrus h@xmath1  and @xmath22 in total hydrogen , distributed over the milky way disk - halo interface , within the solar circle . above the self - shielding transition , these",
    "diffuse halo clouds have molecular fractions ranging from 130% , for column densities n@xmath111  @xmath36 and n@xmath11  @xmath101  @xmath36 ( gillmon et  al .  2005 ) . to support such high molecular fractions by h@xmath1  formation on grain surfaces , the cirrus clouds are probably compressed sheets with densities @xmath9 @xmath10 , in which the gas and grains remain sufficiently cold to form h@xmath1 . on average , the ir cirrus clouds may actually have higher molecular fractions , on average , than diffuse clouds in the galactic disk .",
    "this point was also made by reach et  al .",
    "( 1994 ) , who estimated that the h@xmath1/h  i transition in denser cirrus clouds occurs at n@xmath112 @xmath36 , on the basis of fits to the far - infrared excess .",
    "this transition column density is almost twice that found here , probably because the infrared - excess technique requires larger molecular fractions than used for the uv absorbers ( @xmath113 ) .",
    "this initial survey opens up considerable opportunities for future studies of the h@xmath1cirrus correlation .",
    "higher resolution infrared maps with more accurate temperature corrections , such as those obtainable with the _",
    "spitzer space telescope _",
    ", would greatly improve the effectiveness of this method .",
    "a comparison with h  i 21-cm maps ( e.g. , lockman & condon 2005 ) could delineate the gaseous structures associated with the cirrus and measure the dust - to - gas ratios in these diffuse clouds . expanding the uv sample to include more sight lines to background agn",
    "would improve the statistics of such a small sample .",

    "( 2003 ) as candidates for the analysis of galactic ovi .",
    "the next 50 brightest targets have an average flux of @xmath114  erg  @xmath36 s@xmath8  @xmath8 . to achieve a s / n of 3 per pixel with _ fuse",
    "_ would require approximately 20 ksec per agn , for a program total of 1000 ksec .",
    "an ultraviolet telescope with sensitivity greater than fuse is probably necessary for feasible exposure times in a @xmath115 target survey .    another promising avenue for future exploration is to compare the cirrus maps and h@xmath1  absorption lines with other tracers , such as h  i , co and @xmath116-ray emission . on the basis of such comparisons , grenier , casandjian , & terrier ( 2005 ) suggest that many interstellar clouds in the solar neighborhood have extensive dark regions that bridge the dense cloud cores to atomic phases .",
    "these details are beyond the scope of our current paper . perhaps the most direct way to investigate the connection between diffuse h@xmath1  and",
    "ir cirrus would be to map h@xmath1 in uv or ir fluorescent emission .",
    "this method would provide the morphological information lacking in  pencil - beam \" uv - absorption sight lines .",
    "there is currently no high - resolution experiment that can map diffuse h@xmath1 emission , either in the mid - infrared ( 28 and 17 @xmath0 m ) or the far - ultraviolet ( 10001100  ) .",
