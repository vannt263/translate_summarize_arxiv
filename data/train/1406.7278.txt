    "the long - range behavior of gapped systems in condensed matter physics is accessible via topology . for noninteracting fermionic systems",
    "there is a classification of topological phases using ideas related to @xmath0-theory  @xcite . over the past few years",
    "the interacting case has been vigorously studied , for both fermionic systems and bosonic systems , with an emphasis on _ short - range entanglement _ ( sre ) ; a small sampling of papers is  @xcite .",
    "symmetry protected topological _ ( spt ) phases are captured by group cohomology  @xcite , but other investigations ( e.g.  @xcite ) reveal the existence of additional sre phases and raise the question of a complete classification . in this paper",
    "we propose an invariant of bosonic and fermionic sre topological phases constructed from effective field theory .",
    "computations and examples demonstrate that it effectively detects known sre phases .",
    "our proposal applies to gapped systems which at low energy ( long time ) can be approximated by topological field theories . such a system must be sufficiently local that it can be formulated on arbitrary manifolds , and it must have a continuum limit which is a field theory , at least at low energy .",
    "we do not investigate microscopic behavior at all in this paper , but rather simply assume the existence of a long - range topological theory .",
    "short range entanglement , or the absence of topological order , is a microscopic assumption .",
    "kitaev  @xcite has been studying sre phases from first principles microscopically , and has suggested the macroscopic consequence that the long - range topological theory has a unique vacuum on any background manifold .",
    "we go further and assume that the long - range topological field theory describing an sre phase is _ fully extended _ and _ invertible _ , concepts that we explain below . from mathematical investigations",
    "it has been known for a long time that fully extended , invertible , _ topological _ field theories are equivalent to maps between spectra in the sense of algebraic topology .",
    "this link with stable homotopy theory is the basis of our proposal .    while our proposal in   [ subsec:5.2 ] is specific and precise , we neither formulate nor prove a mathematical theorem which justifies it .",
    "also , while we enumerate groups which should house invariants of sre phases , we do not argue either that the effective field theory is a complete invariant or that every possible effective field theory is realized by a microscopic system .",
    "in place of proof the paper marshals evidence in two stages .",
    "pre-[subsec:5.2 ] is a long conceptual march leading to the proposal .",
    "post-[subsec:5.2 ] is a series of experimental checks , including the relationship to group cohomology , boundary terminations , and specific computations .",
    "we include a long discussion in   [ subsec:6.3 ] about detecting kitaev s",
    "@xmath1  phase using invertible topological field theories .",
    "there are additional possible effective field theories which are `` @xmath2 roots '' , perhaps an indication that not all possible effective theories are realized by microscopic systems .",
    "another example , the `` 3d bosonic @xmath1  phase with half - quantized surface thermal hall effect ''  @xcite , @xcite , is also treated in detail .",
    "it may be useful to broadly characterize our proposal in field - theoretic language : whereas the group cohomology captures pure gauge theories , the additional sre phases contain couplings to gravity or are purely gravitational .",
    "the spt phases have no purely gravitational component .",
    "more fundamentally , the long - range field theory is envisioned as the low - energy behavior of the coupling to gravity of the original system .",
    "( and , if there are global symmetries , we gauge them and so couple to gauge theory too . )",
    "bordism as a tool to classify spt phases appears differently in the recent papers of kapustin  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in unpublished work kitaev",
    "@xcite develops a classification of sre phases based on microscopic considerations .",
    "their results and approach differ from ours , and it will be very interesting to reconcile them",
    ". it may be that there is more microscopic information in the physics which leads to different or additional input into the effective field theories .",
    "in particular , there are a few ingredients in our proposal ( choice of tangential structure , choice of target spectrum ) which involve leaps of faith and can easily be adjusted if further microscopic implications are discovered .",
    "we begin in   [ sec:2 ] with an exposition of several formal points in field theory : extended field theory , invertible field theory , relative field theory , anomalies , global symmetries and gauging , topological field theory , unitarity . while many of these concepts are familiar to physicists , the mathematical language may be unfamiliar and we hope to provide some bridge here .",
    "we touch on the cobordism hypothesis , which classifies fully extended topological theories , in   [ subsec:2.5 ] ; the precise nature of this classification is illuminated in   [ subsec:2.7 ] with a toy example in preparation for a later discussion of the `` kitaev @xmath1  phase '' in   [ subsec:6.3 ] .",
    "but the cobordism hypothesis is overkill for _ invertible _ theories . in",
    " [ subsec:2.6 ] we describe the link between fully extended , invertible , topological field theories and stable homotopy theory in general terms . that involves particular _ madsen - tillmann spectra _ , which are unstable analogs of thom s bordism spectra ; we describe them in   [ sec:4 ] .",
    "there we also discuss the crucial theorem of galatius - madsen - tillmann - weiss @xcite which identifies these spectra as geometric realizations of bordism categories . that these _ unstable _ bordism spectra are appropriate to field theories is natural since field theories are dimension - specific .",
    "the material in   [ sec:2 ] and   [ sec:4 ] is general background not particular to condensed matter systems .    in   [ sec:3 ] we give much of the general argument about effective field theories for sre topological phases .",
    "we begin in   [ subsec:3.1 ] with elementary thoughts indicating why topology may sufficiently describe the low energy behavior of gapped systems .",
    "most of our assumptions are stated explicitly in   [ subsec:3.3 ] .",
    "there is still conceptual work to translate those assumptions into concrete mathematical statements .",
    "specifically , once we know that sre gapped phases give rise to invertible topological theories , there are still parameters to choose : the tangential structure on manifolds representing space and the target category for the field theory .",
    "the latter is discussed in   [ subsec:5.1 ] separately for bosonic and fermionic theories ; the bosonic case is a bit surprising and we settle on a kludge for the target spectrum . for the tangential structures we assume without much justification that in bosonic theories the space manifolds are oriented and in fermionic theories they are spin . along the way we encounter a few tricky issues , for example the gauging of antilinear symmetries (   [ subsubsec:2.4.3 ] , [ subsubsec:5.1.3 ] ) and implementation of unitarity (  [ subsubsec:4.2.5 ] ) .",
    "we state our proposal in   [ subsec:5.2 ] .",
    "we divide theories into bosonic and fermionic .",
    "also , symmetries may be anomalous and we propose a classification of anomaly theories and anomalous gauged theories as well .",
    "possible effective invertible topological theories for sre phases with fixed symmetry form an abelian group ; for spt phases they form a subgroup which we also delineate .",
    "our first deduction in   [ subsec:5.3 ] from the proposal is that the phases previously identified using group cohomology are included . in   [ subsec:6.1 ] we show that for bosonic theories in @xmath3 space dimensions group cohomology provides a complete classification , which agrees with known results  @xcite .",
    "already for fermionic theories in  @xmath3 the situation is more interesting , as described in   [ subsec:6.2 ] : we detect the majorana chain  @xcite in our classification . in   [ subsec:6.3 ] we identify bosonic @xmath4 sre phases .",

    "dimensional chiral conformal field theories whose chiral central charge is an integer divisible by  8 . these central charges",
    "do not show up in the usual account of the associated 3-spacetime dimensional topological field theory ; there only the reduction mod  8 is used .",
    "our explanation of how they fit in here , and so the role of the chiral central charge as a real number not taken mod  8 , is based on the easier examples discussed in   [ subsec:2.7 ] . in   [ subsec:6.4 ] we illustrate a constraint imposed by unitarizability . in",
    " [ subsec:6.5 ] we compute that the abelian group of @xmath6 bosonic time - reversal symmetric effective sre field theories is isomorphic to  @xmath7 .",
    "one generator is accounted for by group cohomology , and we claim the other is the 3d bosonic @xmath1  phase with half - quantized surface thermal hall effect mentioned earlier .",
    "finally , in   [ sec:7 ] we give a general discussion of boundary conditions / terminations / excitations and use it to justify the aforementioned claim .",
    "an appendix includes topological computations which are needed in the text .",
    "the notion of a non - extended _ invertible _ field theory arose in joint work with greg moore  @xcite .",
    "fully extended invertible topological theories , and the relation to stable homotopy theory , has been a longstanding discussion topic with mike hopkins and constantin teleman , as have many other general ideas described in   [ sec:2 ] . in particular , we used these ideas in  @xcite to construct a topological field theory based on the verlinde ring .",
    "the specific application to sre phases described here crystallized during the _ symmetry in topological phases _ workshop in princeton , and i thank the organizers for inviting me .",
    "i had long conversations with alexei kitaev after a first draft of this paper was complete , and those inspired a significant modification of   [ subsubsec:5.1.1 ] and   [ subsec:6.3 ] .",
    "i thank him for sharing his perspectives .",
    "i also thank zheng - cheng gu , mike hopkins , anton kapustin , constantin teleman , ashvin vishwanath , kevin walker , oscal randal - williams , and xiao - gang wen for very helpful conversations and correspondence .",
    "we begin with a formal viewpoint on the structure of a field theory , which is the lens through which we analyze the long - range effective topological theory in   [ sec:3 ] . in the mathematics literature",
    "this approach was abstracted in segal s axioms for two - dimensional conformal field theory  @xcite and in atiyah s axioms for topological field theories  @xcite .",

    "our focus in this paper is on _ invertible _ field theories , which we define in   [ subsec:2.2 ] .",

    "@xcite provides a classification result .",
    "invertible topological theories can be analyzed using homotopy theory , and in this section we explain why that is true but defer a more precise description to   [ sec:4 ] .",
    "we conclude with a few toy examples which illuminate subtleties we will encounter in the condensed matter systems of   [ sec:6 ] .",
    "the subtleties discussed there may have broader interest .",
    "there are many expositions of this material , in addition to the ones referenced earlier in this paragraph , and here we offer another .",
    "a somewhat different point of view on topological field theories may be found in  @xcite .",
    "the reader may wish to use this section for reference and skip on first reading to later parts of the paper .",
    "we remark that this formal viewpoint does not distinguish `` classical '' from `` quantum '' , and indeed we will give examples of both types .",
    "another remark is that the field theories which arise in condensed matter physics are usually defined on spacetimes which are products of space and time , whereas the discussion in this section models theories defined on more general spacetimes .",
    "we discuss the necessary modification in   [ subsec:4.2 ] and account for it in the proposals of   [ subsec:5.2 ] .",

    "all boundary components are `` incoming '' , whereas each interval in figure  [ fig:1 ] has an incoming boundary component and an outgoing boundary component , each a single point .",
    "there are analogous quantum evolution operators in any dimension for manifolds with both incoming and outgoing components , and the group law of quantum mechanics has a generalization .",

    "there are two kinds of composition .",
    "the internal composition glues morphisms ( figure  [ fig:4 ] ) and the external composition is disjoint union .",
    "similarly @xmath33  has two composition laws : the internal composition is the usual composition of linear maps and the external composition is tensor product .",
    "the homomorphism   is required to preserve both composition laws .",
    "this formulation is rather compact and one must unpack it to see the usual structures in field theory .",
    "of morphisms @xmath29 and @xmath34    typically one does not have bare @xmath8-manifolds , but rather each @xmath8-manifold  @xmath19 is endowed with a space  @xmath35 of fields .",
    "for example , in quantum mechanics ( figure  [ fig:1 ] ) the 1-manifolds have a riemannian metric : the total length represents time .",
    "higher dimensional field theories are often formulated on riemannian manifolds , though conformal field theories only require a conformal structure .",
    "other possible fields include orientations , spin structures , scalar fields , spinor fields , etc .",

    "so the quantum theory is not generally invertible .",
    "[ thm:1 ] this description of a field theory has an important deficiency : it does not encode _ smooth _ dependence on parameters .",

    "this is crucial for the classification of gapped topological phases : if two gapped systems are connected by a continuous path , we expect their effective topological field theories can also be joined by a continuous path .",

    "furthermore , the fact that @xmath9  preserves the symmetric monoidal structure  a field theory takes compositions to compositions and disjoint unions to tensor products  implies that @xmath160  is an infinite loop map .",
    "such sequences of spaces are called _ spectra _ and an infinite loop map gives rise to a map of spectra .",

    "the domain spectra , obtained from bordism multicategories , will be discussed in   [ sec:4 ] .",
    "we remark that to study invertible field theories one does not need the cobordism hypothesis ; the power of the latter is for more general non - invertible topological field theories .",
    "[ thm:12 ] the set of path components here has a natural abelian group structure .",
    "in fact , a spectrum  @xmath217 determines a collection @xmath218 of abelian groups , its homotopy groups .",

    "all of these are `` 1-dimensional '' .",

    "the fact that all invertible 1-morphisms are equivalent implies @xmath223 .",
    "finally we come to  @xmath224 , which captures the 2-morphisms  @xmath84 . here",

    "consider , then , a riemannian manifold  @xmath91 with riemannian metric  @xmath151 .",

    "however , if 0  is not an isolated point of the spectrum , then the low lying continuous spectrum mixes inextricably with the kernel .",
    "therefore , we isolate the kernel at long time only if there is a _",

    "this always happens if @xmath91  is compact . in that case",
    "the hodge and de rham theorems combine to prove that the kernel of the laplace operator  @xmath293 on differential forms has _ topological _ significance : the dimension of the kernel of  @xmath293 on  @xmath297 is the @xmath298   betti number of @xmath91 .",
    "a _ gapped quantum system _ is one in which 0  is an isolated point of the spectrum of the hamiltonian  @xmath299 . by the dimensional analysis above , this _ energy gap _ is equivalent to a _ mass gap _ in a relativistic quantum system .",
    "one is interested in the long time ( and large distance ) behavior of a system since that is what we can observe , and often that behavior is described by an _",
    "effective _ system .",
    "we use the general term ` long - range ' for either ` long time ' or ` large distance ' .",
    "for example , quantum field theories at large distance are often well - approximated by another quantum field theory , and the approximating theory contains more than the vacuum state if there is no mass gap ; see  @xcite for a discussion .",
    "it is sometimes said that if there is a mass gap then the low energy theory is trivial , but there is a more nuanced truism : @xmath300 for this to make sense , we need to study the theory on arbitrary spacetimes , so couple to background gravity .",
    "that can be done for many field theories .",
    "for example , 4-dimensional yang - mills theory makes sense on arbitrary riemannian manifolds , and conjecturally there is a mass gap , so one should obtain a 4-dimensional topological field in the low energy limit .",
    "( here @xmath161  is the spacetime dimension . )",
    "[ thm:15 ] the @xmath301  supersymmetric yang - mills theory also has a conjectural mass gap , and presumably the low energy effective topological theory is more interesting in that case .",
    "we turn to condensed matter systems , which we treat _ very _ heuristically .",
    "we assume the quantum hilbert space  @xmath14 is the tensor product over a set  @xmath57 of sites of finite dimensional hilbert spaces @xmath302 and we may assume @xmath303 is a fixed hilbert space independent of the site  @xmath304 ; the sites are initially arranged in a regular pattern , such as a lattice ; and the hamiltonian  @xmath299 is _ local _ in that it is a sum @xmath305 where @xmath306 relative to a decomposition @xmath307 in which @xmath308  runs over sites in a small vicinity of  @xmath304 and the operator  @xmath283 is independent of  @xmath304 .",

    "this is a nonrelativistic system , and galilean boosts have been broken by the sites , which do nt move in time .",
    "thus time is completely separate from the geometry of space .",
    "initially @xmath22  typically lies in flat euclidean space , and coupling to gravity in this context means that the system can be studied on any curved @xmath11-dimensional manifold  @xmath22 .",
    "fix a compact  @xmath22 and imagine that the finite set of sites  @xmath57 becomes more and more dense . with no pretense of precision",
    "we assume that the system is gapped in that 0  is the lowest eigenvalue of  @xmath299 and the spectrum of  @xmath299 has a fixed size gap above  0 which persists in the limit that @xmath57  becomes dense .",
    "furthermore , we assume the kernel of  @xmath299 stabilizes to a finite dimensional vector space  @xmath20 .",
    "in this situation we would like to assert  : there is an effective @xmath11-space dimensional topological field theory  @xmath9 which approximates the low energy / long time behavior of the system .",
    "the vector spaces  @xmath20 are part of that theory .",
    "the deformation class of the theory  @xmath9 is then a _ topological invariant _ of the original system , much the same way that the betti numbers are topological invariants of the laplace operator on a compact riemannian manifold .",
    "[ thm:18 ] some parts of the gluing laws of a topological field theory are clearly going to hold .",
    "for example , if @xmath309 is a disjoint union , and we envision a system as described after remark  [ thm:15 ] , then the quantum hilbert space   of  @xmath22 is the tensor product of those on  @xmath310 and  @xmath311 and the hamiltonian   decomposes accordingly .",
    "therefore , so too does the kernel  @xmath20 .",

    "[ thm:17 ] this procedure does not obviously give numerical invariants on all compact @xmath312-dimensional manifolds .",

    "when we return to the initial time the manifold and its fields can undergo a symmetry , so the manifold we obtain is a fiber bundle @xmath314 .",
    "we do expect invariants for these _ mapping cylinders_. this kind of impoverished @xmath312-dimensional field theory , perhaps with variations , goes under many names : a _ @xmath315-dimensional theory _",
    ", a theory of _ @xmath299-type _ ,  .",
    "many , in fact most , of the effective theories of @xmath299-type that we encounter do extend to full @xmath312-dimensional theories , and it may be that additional considerations in the microscopic theory can imply that property of the long - range topological theory .",
    "even more is possible .",
    "a 1-parameter family of @xmath312-manifolds parametrized by  @xmath57 is the total space of a fiber bundle @xmath316 , and the theory gives a map  @xmath317 .",
    "its winding number is an integer invariant associated to  @xmath91 .",
    "it may happen that these integer invariants are defined for _ arbitrary _ closed @xmath318-manifolds , not just mapping cylinders .",
    "this would impose a more severe constraint on the low energy effective theory , as we illustrate in   [ subsec:6.3 ] .",
    "geometrically , an @xmath299-type theory gives invariants for manifolds equipped with a rank  @xmath11 bundle stably equivalent to the tangent bundle .",
    "if one starts with a gapped quantum field theory , at first glance one can imagine its low energy behavior giving rise to a specific topological field theory , or at least a contractible space of theories depending on some mild choices in the approximation . for a condensed matter system",
    "there seem to be more choices as one must , in addition to any cutoffs , take a continuum limit .",
    "this leads to the expectation that we obtain a space of theories ",
    "again presumably contractible , but hopefully at least connected  and makes it more plausible that one could encounter the phenomenon highlighted in   [ subsec:2.7 ] .",
    "indeed , we will in   [ subsec:6.3 ] .",
    "we make explicit the assumptions beyond   which underlie our proposal in   [ subsec:5.2 ] .",
    "the most drastic of these is invertibility , which is an expression of short - range entanglement ; see  ( [ srehyp ] ) below .    1 .",
    "we assume that the low energy effective topological theory  @xmath9 is _ fully extended _ , in the sense discussed after remark  [ thm:2 ] .",
    "this is a strong form of locality , and it seems reasonable since the continuum limit theory is obtained from local discrete systems , as in   and  . to define the extended theory",
    "we must specify what sorts of ( higher categorical ) invariants @xmath9  computes on low dimensional manifolds .",
    "in other words , we must specify the target  @xmath64 for the field theory ; see  .",
    "since we restrict to invertible theories , we need only specify a spectrum .",
    "that is one of the key choices to be made ; see   [ subsec:5.1 ] for a full discussion .",
    "we assume that @xmath9  is _ unitary _ , since microscopic condensed matter systems are typically unitary .",
    "3 .   one important consideration which affects the choice of  @xmath64 is the _ topology _ on the space of theories , as already mentioned and illustrated in remark  [ thm:2 ] , example  [ thm:4 ] , and example  [ thm:13 ] .",
    "to the extent that the theory  @xmath9 has numerical invariants of closed @xmath312-manifolds , they lie in  @xmath68 ; the invariants of closed @xmath11-manifolds are @xmath68-vector spaces . in both cases",
    "we use the usual topology on  @xmath68 to allow the theory  @xmath9 to deform by continuously varying the numerical invariants , the linear maps between vector spaces , etc .",
    "two microscopic gapped systems related by a continuous deformation are considered to define the same topological phase , and they should give rise to effective topological field theories which are deformation equivalent .",
    "on the other hand , we also consider anomaly theories  @xmath129 , which can arise when gauging an anomalous global symmetry .",
    "( see   [ subsec:2.3 ] and the text before example  [ thm:10 ] . ) in that case we do not allow continuous deformations of the anomaly theory : anomalous theories relative to distinct anomaly theories should not be viewed as the same topological phase .",
    "thus , for the classification of anomalies we take the _ discrete _ topology on  @xmath68 .",
    "another important choice is of the _ background fields _",
    "@xmath38 in the low energy effective topological theory  .",
    "we expect only topological fields .",
    "our choice here is based on limited experience , and is more or less a guess .",
    "naively one may think a lattice system on a manifold induces a framing , but we hope there is rotational invariance which allows us to formulate the theory on more general manifolds . as orientations are typically used to define local hamiltonians  , we require invariance only under rotations connected to the identity . therefore ,",
    "for purely bosonic systems we choose @xmath38  to include an orientation , and if the theory includes fermions then we augment this to a spin structure . in the fermionic case one can think that the coupling of such a system to background gravity involves spacetime spinor fields , whence the necessity of a spin structure .",
    "there is an additional field  a background principal bundle  if we gauge a global symmetry , as we elaborate below in   [ subsec:3.4 ] . 5 .",
    "as already discussed in remark  [ thm:17 ] we take @xmath9 to be a theory defined in @xmath11  space dimensions which defines complex numbers only on special closed @xmath312-manifolds . in remark  [ thm:17 ]",
    "we explain then that integers are obtained for special closed @xmath318-manifolds .",
    "` special ' in both cases means the manifold is equipped with a rank   @xmath11 vector bundle and a stable isomorphism with the tangent bundle .",
    "[ srehyp ] finally , we assume @xmath9  is _ invertible _ , which is the hypothesis of _ no long - range entanglement _ , referred to as _ short - range entanglement_. the macroscopic definition given in some literature ( for example  @xcite ) is that @xmath319 for all closed @xmath11-manifolds .",
    "this _ is _ precisely invertibility at this level  dimension  @xmath11of the field theory .",
    "it is not too much of a stretch to extrapolate that to invertibility at all levels .",
    "the theorem mentioned in footnote  [ foot ] supports this extrapolation .",

    "this can include internal symmetries which act on the local hilbert space  @xmath303 in  .",
    "it can also include time - reversal symmetry , since we consider time as external to space and so time - reversal symmetries fix the points of space .",
    "we do not , however , consider symmetries which move points of space since we want to consider the theory on an arbitrary @xmath11-manifold  @xmath22 .",
    "for example , this rules out rotation and reflection symmetries of theories on euclidean space .    just as we study the condensed matter system on arbitrary space manifolds  @xmath22 to explore its low energy behavior ( coupling to gravity ) , to explore the effect of the global symmetry we attempt to construct an equivariant extension , as in   [ subsec:2.4 ] .",
