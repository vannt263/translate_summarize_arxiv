    "with a spectral type of o2 if@xmath0 @xcite , hd 93129a is among the earliest , hottest , most massive and luminous o stars in the galaxy . as such",
    ", it has an extremely powerful wind , with a terminal velocity in excess of 3000 km s@xmath8 , and a mass - loss rate thought to be in excess of @xmath9 @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "in fact , hd 93129a has been considered to have the highest mass - loss rate of any o star in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "this star , therefore , provides an interesting test of the wind - shock paradigm of massive star x - ray emission , both because of the tremendous kinetic power in its wind and because of the dominant role played by x - ray absorption in such a dense wind . in order to study the x - ray emission and absorption we have analyzed the _ chandra _ hetgs spectrum with a focus on individual line profiles . in addition",
    ", we analyze the low - resolution , zeroth - order acis ccd spectrum in order to determine the relative contributions of high - temperature thermal emission and wind attenuation to the observed spectral hardness .",
    "these complementary analysis techniques provide information about the temperature and kinematics of the x - ray emitting plasma , about its spatial distribution , and about the wind mass - loss rate .",
    "x - ray emission from o stars is attributed to three mechanisms : ( 1 ) embedded wind shocks ( ews ) , generally assumed to be associated with the line - driving instability ( ldi ) @xcite ; ( 2 ) colliding wind shocks ( cws ) in some binary systems @xcite ; and ( 3 ) magnetically confined wind shocks ( mcws ) for stars with significant dipole magnetic fields @xcite . of these , the ews mechanism is assumed to operate in all o stars , while cws may dominate in massive binaries with strong enough winds and mcws in those small number of o stars with strong , large - scale magnetic fields .",
    "the ews mechanism produces plasma of several million degrees and is associated with relatively soft x - ray emission , while the other two mechanisms produce stronger shocks , higher temperatures , and harder x - ray emission .",
    "however , it should be kept in mind that soft x - ray absorption by the bulk wind can harden the observed x - rays from ews in o stars with high mass - loss rates @xcite .    in high - resolution x - ray spectra ,",
    "the hallmark of embedded wind shocks is broad emission lines @xcite . by analyzing the widths and profile shapes of individual x - ray emission lines in the grating spectra of o stars , the kinematics of the hot , x - ray emitting plasma embedded in the warm ,",
    "partially ionized bulk wind can be determined , testing the predictions of the ews scenario .",
    "furthermore , due to preferential absorption of red - shifted line photons from the far hemisphere of o star winds , x - ray emission lines from embedded wind shocks have a characteristic blue - shifted and skewed shape , in proportion to the characteristic wind optical depth @xcite .",
    "it recently has been shown that a wind mass - loss rate can be determined by fitting the ensemble of derived characteristic optical depths , given a model of the bulk wind x - ray opacity @xcite .",
    "the initial application of this technique to @xmath10  pup ( o4 if ) provided a mass - loss rate determination that was roughly a factor of three lower than the traditional value derived from the strength of the @xmath7 emission under the assumption of a smooth , unclumped wind .",
    "this lower value is consistent with other recent reassessments @xcite that do account for small - scale wind clumping , which affects density - squared diagnostics such as @xmath7 emission strength .",
    "the associated clumping factors are consistent with those seen in numerical simulations of the ldi @xcite .",
    "indeed , there is a consensus emerging that many , if not all , o stars mass - loss rates must be lowered by factors of several due to the effects of clumping @xcite . in this context , the x - ray line profile mass - loss rate diagnostic is especially useful , as it is not affected by small - scale clumping , as long as the individual clumps are optically thin to x - rays @xcite .",
    "both numerical simulations and the lack of significant observed x - ray variability indicate that clumps in o star winds are on quite small scales , with sizes @xmath11 .",
    "since even the entire wind of hd 93129a is only marginally optically thick to bound - free absorption of x - rays , it is very likely that such small clumps will be individually quite optically thin to x - rays .",
    "this means they can not have much of the self - shadowing that would reduce the exposure of wind material to x - rays , and would thus lead to a significant `` porosity '' reduction in the overall absorption .",
    "an important point here then is that , while such porosity requires a strong clumping ( with individual clumps that are optically thick ) , a clumped wind need not be porous ( if the clumps are optically thin ) .",
    ", reserving `` porosity '' to describe the effects of optically thick clumps .",
    "for the unmodified term `` clumping '' , the reader should bear in mind that density - squared diagnostics such as @xmath7 will still always be affected , but that x - ray transmission will be affected by an associated porosity if and only if the clumps are optically thick .",
    "finally , we note that a given clump or clump distribution may be optically thin at one wavelength and thick at others . ]",
    "hd 93129a lies in the trumpler 14 cluster in the carina nebula , at a distance of 2.3 kpc , but with a modest visual extinction of @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "it has a visual companion , hd 93129b , at a separation of 2.7 , with a spectral type of o3.5 , and it also has a closer visual companion ( hd 93129ab ) detected using the hst fine guidance sensor ( fgs ) at a separation of 0.053 @xcite .",
    "this closer companion is also estimated to have a spectral type of o3.5 .",
    "non - thermal radio emission has been detected from the system , presumably indicating the existence of colliding wind shocks @xcite .",
    "this motivated the initial cws interpretation of low - resolution _ chandra _  ccd spectral measurements of the relatively hard x - rays from hd 93129a @xcite , although given the large separation of components aa and ab ( over 100 au @xmath13 @xmath1 ) , any x - ray emission associated with the wind interaction zone should be relatively weak and the overall emission is likely dominated by ews emission arising much closer to the photosphere of component aa .",
    "@xcite has recently suggested that only 10 to 15 percent of the x - ray emission is due to cws x - rays .",
    "furthermore , given the high wind mass - loss rate of hd 93129a , significant attenuation of the soft x - ray emission is expected .",
    "this paper represents an attempt to account for wind absorption when analyzing the star s x - ray properties .    detailed analysis and modeling of the optical and uv spectra of hd 93129a",
    "was presented by @xcite . that work included an analysis of the interstellar absorption features in the uv , which yielded a hydrogen column density measurement of @xmath14 @xmath15 that is basically consistent with",
    "the observed reddening and inferred extinction ( @xmath16 @xmath15 is implied by the color excess ) .",
    "important results from the uv and optical spectral analysis include a very high wind mass - loss rate and terminal velocity in addition to a bolometric luminosity in excess of @xmath17 @xmath18 and evidence for non - solar abundances in line with cno processing ( a nitrogen abundance several times solar and carbon and oxygen abundances a factor of a few lower than solar ) .",
    "these authors estimate a zero - age main sequence mass of 120 @xmath19 for hd 93129a .",
    "more recent analysis by @xcite finds a significantly lower effective temperature and a modestly lower bolometric luminosity along with a higher wind mass - loss rate .",
    "the stellar parameters derived from these two studies are summarized in table [ tab : properties ] .",
    "we note that the presence of the close binary companion will affect the radius determination , and related quantities . given that the companion is about a magnitude dimmer than the primary , this effect will be small @xcite .",

[ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : line_fits ]    before we move on to interpreting these model - fitting results , we report on a few experiments involving fitting different types of models to these same emission lines .",
    "specifically , gaussian profiles have traditionally been fit to the broadened emission lines seen in o stars .",
    "therefore , we fit the highest signal - to - noise single line in the spectrum , the mg xii @xmath20 line , with an unshifted gaussian . as expected from the asymmetry seen in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : individual_lines ] , the fit is poor ( the wind profile fit is preferred at @xmath21 99.99% ) . allowing the gaussian centroid to be a free parameter",
    ", we find an improved fit with a large centroid blue shift ( to @xmath22  ) , equivalent to @xmath23 km s@xmath8 , and a width of @xmath24 km s@xmath8 .",
    "this shifted - gaussian fit is statistically indistinguishable from the wind profile model fit .",
    "although the _ windprofile _ fit is more meaningful , as it is based on a physically realistic model while having no more free parameters than the gaussian model , the gaussian fit confirms and quantifies the large line widths and blue shifts expected from ews emission .",
    "along similar lines , he - like complexes can be fit with three gaussians , providing a direct measure of the @xmath25 ratio , from which a single radius of formation can be inferred .",
    "we show these results in fig .",
    "[ fig : hegauss ] . for the mg xi complex",
    "we find a low ratio of @xmath26 .",
    "we next fit the same model , but with the @xmath25 ratio fixed at the `` low density limit '' that would be expected if the x - ray plasma were very far from the photosphere , where photoexcitation can not alter the ratio .",
    "this fit ( which is also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hegauss ] ) is poor compared to the @xmath27 fit , implying that the hot plasma is relatively close to the photosphere .",
    "this conclusion is in good agreement with the result from fitting the three wind - profile model ( _ hewind _ ) , in which the onset radius of a distributed source of x - ray emitting plasma , @xmath28 , is constrained to be within 1 stellar radius of the photosphere .",
    "ratio is a free parameter ( red ) , it is low ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "when the ratio is fixed at the normal , equilibrium limit ( @xmath30 ) with no photoexcitation , as would be expected far from the star ( green ) , the fit is poor . , width=321 ]    porosity , due to optically thick clumps , can affect x - ray line profiles by reducing the average optical depth of the wind @xcite , and is another effect we might consider when fitting the emission line data .",
    "however , the porosity length that is necessary to provide a measurable effect is quite large @xcite compared to the small - scale structure in state - of - the - art 2-d radiation hydrodynamics simulations @xcite . to explore the effects of porosity on the fit quality and on the other parameters",
    ", we fit the mg xii @xmath20 line with a model having an effective opacity modified by porosity from spherical clumps .",
    "this model is similar to the one described in @xcite  using the same porosity - length ( @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the characteristic clump size and @xmath33 is the clump filling factor ) formalism  but here employing a radial clump distribution determined by the wind beta - velocity law , as used by @xcite .",
    "we fix the characteristic optical depth at @xmath34 , which is the value we would expect at the wavelength of the mg @xmath20 line assuming a mass - loss rate of @xmath35 @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the fit we obtain is similar in quality to the _ windprofile _ fit reported in table [ tab : line_fits ] .",
    "but in order to achieve this good fit , a very large terminal porosity length of @xmath36 @xmath1 is required ( with a 68% lower confidence limit of @xmath37 @xmath1 ) , where the radially varying porosity length is given by @xmath38 .",
    "if we use @xmath39 @xmath5 as the standard , smooth - wind mass - loss rate @xcite , then the required porosity length is even larger .",
    "even the minimum porosity length of @xmath40 @xmath1 is inconsistent with the numerical simulations of the line - driving instability @xcite , requiring , for example , clumps that are individually 0.25 @xmath1 in scale in a wind with a uniform filling factor of @xmath41 .",
    "given the characteristic optical depth values ( @xmath42 , listed in table [ tab : line_fits ] ) obtained from fitting each line with the _ windprofile _ model , we can derive constraints on the wind mass - loss rate of hd 93129a .",
    "the characteristic optical depth is defined as @xmath43 , so that by assuming a model of the bulk wind s x - ray opacity , @xmath44 , as well as a value for the stellar radius and wind terminal velocity , we can fit the wavelength - dependent @xmath42 values with the mass - loss rate as the only free parameter of the fit , as @xmath45 .",
    "we have demonstrated this process for analyzing the _ chandra _ grating spectrum of the o supergiant @xmath10  pup @xcite .",
    "because of the lower quality of the _ chandra _ spectrum of hd 93129a compared to that of @xmath10  pup , and because of the much smaller number ( 5 vs.  16 ) and narrower wavelength range of usable lines , the wavelength trend in @xmath42 is not apparent for hd 93129a .",
    "however , the five @xmath42 values are certainly consistent with the expected wavelength trend .",
    "we constructed a model of the bulk wind opacity for hd 93129a , assuming that h and he are fully ionized , and assuming typical values for the ionization balance of metals ( generally dominated by triply ionized states ) .",
    "furthermore , we assume solar abundances from @xcite , except for c , n , and o , which are altered by cno processing , according to the spectral analysis of @xcite .",
    "we take the c , n , and o values from these authors , but rescale them so that the sum of the abundances of these three elements is equal to the sum of the c , n , and o in the @xcite solar abundances .",

    "the two different , largely independent , manifestations of the wind attenuation lead to consistent mass - loss rate determinations of between 4.7 and @xmath89 @xmath5 , which represent a factor of several reduction in the mass - loss rate over traditional values determined from density - squared diagnostics .",
    "as both x - ray mass - loss rate diagnostics are insensitive to density squared effects , and because some clumping is certainly expected in the wind of hd  93129a @xcite , the new , lower mass - loss rate seems quite reasonable , and is in line with the factor of three mass - loss rate reduction seen in @xmath10  pup @xcite .",
    "this is verified by our modeling of the @xmath7 line , which shows that @xmath90 @xmath5 provides a good fit if a constant clump volume filling factor @xmath54 is assumed . to explain the strong core of the @xmath7 line , a clump onset radius of @xmath55 @xmath1 also must be assumed .",
    "we note that the x - rays are not produced at radii this small .",
    "presumably the wind shocks associated with clumps at the slow - moving base of the wind are not strong enough to produce x - rays .",
    "the kinematics of the x - ray emitting plasma in hd 93129a determined from the line widths are consistent with the terminal velocity of the bulk wind ( @xmath91 km s@xmath8 ) , assuming a constant x - ray filling factor above some onset radius , @xmath28 .",
    "we derive @xmath28 values for each line or line complex from the profile fitting , and find onset radii that are somewhat lower than , but still statistically consistent with , the typical value of @xmath92 @xmath1 from numerical simulations of the line - driving instability @xcite .",
    "however , if the wind terminal velocity is lower than we assumed for our fitting , then the @xmath28 values would increase by 0.1 or 0.2 , to @xmath92 @xmath1 ( for an assumed @xmath93 km s@xmath8 ) .",
    "the location of the x - ray plasma is further constrained by the forbidden - to - intercombination line ratios in the helium - like line complexes observed in the grating spectra . using a model that includes both the broadening and attenuation effects on the line profiles in conjunction with",
    "the altered forbidden - to - intercombination line ratios due to uv photoexcitation , we find that all three helium - like line complexes are completely consistent with the x - ray emitting plasma being distributed throughout the wind of hd 93129a , starting at a height of only several tenths of a stellar radius above the photosphere . using a simpler model where we fit the forbidden - to - intercombination line ratio directly , using gaussian profiles , we find low @xmath25 ratios for the si xiii and the mg xi complexes .",
    "for both these complexes , the ratio expected if photoexcitation is unimportant , as would be the case in a binary wind - wind collision zone far from either star s photosphere , is ruled out with greater than 95% confidence .",
    "finally , we must discuss alternative interpretations of the spectra and , especially , the spectral lines .",
    "the profiles , while skewed and blue - shifted , are not as asymmetric as expected given the very high mass - loss rate traditionally found for the star .",
    "our interpretation is that this is due to an actual mass - loss rate that is modestly lower than the traditional value , but in principle , it could also be due to porosity associated with optically thick and presumably large - scale wind clumping .",
    "however , not only are the required porosity lengths very high , but the same clumps that would need to be invoked to generate a porosity effect would also lead to a mass - loss rate reduction due to their effect on density - squared diagnostics . if , for example , the required porosity lengths were achieved with clumps having a size scale of 0.25 @xmath1 and a uniform filling factor of @xmath94 in the context of an @xmath7 mass - loss rate of @xmath95 @xmath5 that assumes no clumping @xcite , then the filling factor alone , via its effect on the density - squared mass - loss rate , would reduce the mass - loss rate inferred from the @xmath7 to a value consistent with what we find from the x - rays _ without having to invoke any porosity _  as we have shown at the end of  3.2 and in fig .",
    "[ fig : halpha ] .",
    "any additional effect from porosity would make the mass - loss rates too low and the x - ray line profiles too symmetric .",
    "we have shown that the _ chandra _ grating spectrum of the extreme o star , hd 93129a , can be understood using the same paradigm that explains the canonical embedded wind shock source , @xmath10  pup , once adjustments are made for its larger wind terminal velocity and mass - loss rate . specifically , the kinematics of the x - ray emitting plasma are consistent with shocks embedded in a @xmath53 , @xmath91 km s@xmath8 wind starting at several tenths @xmath1 , and that the attenuation signatures in the line profiles are consistent with a mass - loss rate of 4.7 to @xmath89 @xmath5 , representing a modest reduction compared to traditional mass - loss rates determined from @xmath7 measurements that ignore the effects of clumping , and showing consistency with @xmath7 modeling that includes modest clumping , in line with what is seen in ldi simulations @xcite",
    ". this mass - loss rate reduction of a factor of three to four is consistent with that found for @xmath10  pup @xcite .",
    "we have also demonstrated for the first time that modeling wind absorption of x - rays for both line profiles and for the broadband spectral energy distribution leads to consistent results when a physically realistic model of the broadband wind attenuation @xcite is used .",
    "the global spectral modeling indicates that the dominant thermal emission component has quite a modest temperature , of roughly 0.6 kev , as predicted by ews models .",
    "the observed overall hardness of the spectrum is attributable to wind attenuation , rather than high plasma temperatures .",
    "the low dominant plasma temperature is also manifest in the low si xiv / si xiii ratio , which is consistent with the value found in the _ chandra _ grating spectrum of @xmath10  pup .",
    "there is likely a small amount of hard x - ray emission from colliding wind binary interaction between components aa and ab , many tens of au from either star s photosphere .",
    "because of the large separation of the components , this x - ray emission makes a small contribution to the overall x - ray spectral properties , representing less than 10% of the system s x - ray luminosity .",
    "the helium - like @xmath25 ratios also provide evidence that the bulk of the x - rays arise in embedded wind shocks .    as hd 93129a is the earliest o star known , and has one of the strongest winds of any o star , the work presented here strongly suggests that the embedded wind shock scenario , as described by numerical simulations of the line - driving instability , is widely applicable to o stars , even those with extremely strong winds .",
    "and that x - ray line profile analysis , especially in conjunction with broadband spectral modeling , provides a good means of making a clumping - independent mass - loss rate determination for o stars with dense winds .",
