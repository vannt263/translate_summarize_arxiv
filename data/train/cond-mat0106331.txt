    "ferromagnetic materials display hysteresis under the action of an external field and the magnetization depends in a complex way on the field history . in order to define magnetic properties unambiguously ,",
    "it is customary to first _ demagnetize _ the material , bringing it to a state of zero magnetization at zero field .",
    "this can be done , in practice , by the application of a slowly varying ac field with decreasing amplitude . in this way",
    ", the system explores a complex energy landscape , due to the interplay between structural disorder and interactions , until it is trapped into a low energy minimum .",
    "this demagnetized state is then used as a reference frame to characterize the magnetic properties of the material .",
    "the hysteresis properties at low fields , starting from the demagnetized state , have been investigated already in 1887 by lord rayleigh @xcite , who found that the branches of the hysteresis loop are well described by parabolas .",
    "in particular , when the field is cycled between @xmath3 , the magnetization @xmath4 follows @xmath5 , where the signs @xmath6 distinguish the upper and lower branch of the loop .",
    "consequently the area of the loop scales with the peak field @xmath7 as @xmath8 and the response to a small field change , starting from the demagnetized state is given by @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the rayleigh law has been widely observed in ferromagnetic materials @xcite , but also in ferroelectric ceramics @xcite .",
    "the current theoretical interpretation of this law is based on a 1942 paper by nel @xcite , who derived the law formulating the magnetization process as the dynamics of a point ( i.e. the position of a domain wall ) in a random potential . in this framework",
    ", the initial susceptibility @xmath0 is associated to reversible motions inside one of the many minima of the random potential , while the hysteretic coefficient @xmath1 is due to irreversible jumps between different valleys .",
    "successive developments and improvements have been devoted to establish precise links between nel random potential and the material microstructure @xcite , but in several cases the issue is still unsettled .",
    "for instance , the initial permeability of nanocrystalline materials typically displays a peak as a function of the grain size @xcite , heat treatment @xcite or alloy composition @xcite .",
    "this behavior can be associated to changes in the disordered microstructure , but can not be accounted for by nel theory that predicts a monotonic dependence of @xmath0 on the disorder width @xcite .",
    "the zero temperature random - field ising model ( rfim ) has been recently used to describe the competition between quenched disorder and exchange interactions and their effect on the hysteresis loop @xcite . in three and higher dimensions ,",
    "the model shows a phase transition between a continuous cycle for strong disorder and a discontinuous loop , with a macroscopic jump , at low disorder .",
    "the two phases are separated by a second order critical point , characterized by universal scaling laws @xcite .",
    "a behavior of this kind is not restricted to the rfim but has also been observed in other models , with random bonds or random anisotropies @xcite and vectorial spins @xcite . in addition , a similar disorder induced phase transition in the hysteresis loop has been experimentally reported for a co - co0 bilayer @xcite . thus the rfim provides a tractable model for a more generic behavior : the model has been solved exactly in one dimension @xcite and on the bethe lattice @xcite , while mean - field theory @xcite and renormalization group @xcite have been used to analyze the transition .    here , we use the rfim to analyze the demagnetization process and investigate the properties of the hysteresis loop at low fields . along the lines of refs .",
    "@xcite , we compute the demagnetization cycles exactly in one dimension and derive the rayleigh law , obtaining @xmath0 and @xmath1 as function of disorder and exchange energies .",
    "next , we analyze the problem numerically in higher dimensions ( i.e. @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) where exact results are at present not available . in @xmath11",
    ", we find that the disorder induced transition @xcite , defined on the saturation loop , is also reflected by the rayleigh loops : in the weak disorder phase the system can not be demagnetized , as the final magnetization coincides with the saturation magnetization .",
    "a similar behavior has been recently obtained analyzing subloops @xcite . in the high disorder phase , however , a demagnetization process is possible and hysteresis loops are still described by the rayleigh law . above the transition , the dependence of @xmath0 and @xmath1 on disorder is qualitatively similar in all dimensions , displaying a peak and decreasing to zero for very strong disorder in agreement with experiments @xcite .",
    "in the rfim , a spin @xmath12 is assigned to each site @xmath13 of a @xmath14dimensional lattice .",
    "the spins are coupled to their nearest - neighbors spins by a ferromagnetic interaction of strength @xmath15 and to the external field @xmath16 .",
    "in addition , to each site of the lattice it is associated a random field @xmath17 taken from given probability distribution @xmath18 . in the following we will mainly focus on a gaussian with variance @xmath19 ( i.e. @xmath20 ) , but we will also consider a rectangular distribution .",
    "the hamiltonian thus reads @xmath21 where the first sum is restricted to nearest - neighbors pairs .",
    "the dynamics proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite and used in refs .",
    "@xcite is such that the spins align with the local field @xmath22    in @xmath23 , a spin with @xmath24 neighbors _ up _ ( @xmath25 ) , will be _ up _ at the field @xmath16 with probability : @xmath26 when a spin flips _ up _ the local field of its neighbors is raised by @xmath27 so that it can happen that one or both of the two neighbors flip _ up_. in this way a single spin flip can lead the neighboring spins to flip , eventually triggering an avalanche .    it has been shown that the rfim obeys return - point memory @xcite : if the field is increased adiabatically the magnetization only depends on the state in which the field was last reversed .",
    "this property has been exploited in @xmath23 and in the bethe lattice to obtain exactly the saturation cycle and the first minor loops @xcite . in the next section",
    "we will briefly recall the results reported in ref .",
    "@xcite and we will then proceed with a general derivation for nested minor loops .",
    "to obtain the saturation loop , we start from the initial condition @xmath28 at @xmath29 and we will raise the field up to @xmath30 . we are thus moving on the lower half of the major hysteresis loop . following ref .",
    "@xcite , we define the conditional probability @xmath31 that a spin flips _ up _ at @xmath30 before a given nearest neighbor .",
    "to compute @xmath31 , we take advantage of the translational invariance of the system .",

    "we show the saturation loop for a gaussian distribution of random fields .",
    "if the field is reversed from a finite value @xmath30 , we have a new situation and the system departs from the saturation curve .",
    "it is possible to show that if the field changes from @xmath30 to @xmath39 the magnetization reaches the upper saturation loop again .",
    "thus we can restrict the analysis to fields included in @xmath40 $ ] .",
    "the first return curve can be obtained counting the spins that were _ up _ at @xmath30 and are _ down _ at @xmath41 . to this end",
    ", we introduce @xmath42 as the conditional probability that a spin is _ down _ if its neighbor is _",
    "up_. following similar steps as for @xmath31 @xcite , we obtain : @xmath43 } { 1-\\big[p_1(h_0)-p_1(h_1)\\big]},\\ ] ] where @xmath44+(1-u_0)[1-p_2(h_0)]$ ] . at this point",

    "here , we extend the approach of ref .  @xcite to more general field histories , treating explicitly the demagnetization process : the external field is changed through a nested succession @xmath47 , with @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
