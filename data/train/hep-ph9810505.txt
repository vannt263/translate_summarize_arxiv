    "we are definitively living in very exciting times in neutrino physics .",
    "the recent results from super - kamiokande ( sk ) indicating evidence for neutrino oscillations in atmospheric showers  @xcite , the reports of observed neutrino oscillations by the los alamos liquid scintillator detector ( lsnd )  @xcite in the @xmath3 and @xmath4 channels in conjunction with other hints such as the results of solar neutrino experiments  @xcite makes it difficult to believe today that all of these facts are not related to neutrino properties beyond the standard model .    in the past neutrino physics has led to the discovery of neutral currents and provided the first indications in favor of the standard model of electroweak interactions .",
    "it may as well , if neutrino oscillations turn out to be confirmed by future experiments , reveal itself as an invaluable tool to cast some light on physics beyond the standard model , in particular , on the origin of @xmath0 violation .",
    "one can hope this can be achieved in the study of the neutrino oscillation phenomena in some of the future experiments  @xcite .",
    "the recent ktev result on @xmath5  @xcite finally establishes direct @xmath0 violation in the kaon system , rules out once and for all pure superweak theory and supports the notion of a nonzero phase in the ckm matrix .",
    "this makes it even more interesting to check if a similar effect also happens in the lepton sector .",
    "as it is well known  @xcite @xmath0 violation in neutrino oscillations can , in principle , be observed in neutrino experiments by looking at the differences of the transition probabilities between @xmath0conjugate channels , @xmath6 .",
    "it has been pointed out by many authors that it may be , in practice , very difficult to get a reliable measurement of @xmath7 due to possible earth matter effects in long baseline neutrino experiments  @xcite .",
    "however we believe it is worthwhile to try to evaluate the maximal size of @xmath0 violation effect in vacuum since the vacuum oscillation experiments will be the ultimate proof of electroweakly induced neutrino flavor conversion .",
    "both solar and atmospheric neutrino data can , in fact , be explained by alternative mechanisms invoking matter phenomena  @xcite .    here",
    "we will use the asymmetry parameter , @xmath8 $ ] , suggested by cabibbo  @xcite , as an alternative to measure @xmath0 violation in the leptonic sector .",
    "we will investigate the possible values of this parameter and the corresponding maximal values of @xmath7 allowed by present experimental data for different @xmath2 situations , for a particular choice of neutrino mass squared differences .",
    "we will not make any assumption about the elements of the mixing matrix .",
    "this work will be developed in the three flavor neutrino scheme and for this reason only two mass scale indications can be taken to be right  @xcite .",
    "we will fix them to be : @xmath9    which are taken within the allowed regions given by the atmospheric  @xcite and terrestrial neutrino experiments  @xcite respectively .",
    "we will also take into account the probability constraints coming from this two types of experiments .",
    "we admit here that the solar neutrino problem may be understood invoking other types of mechanisms  @xcite .    we can get the analytical expressions for @xmath7 and @xmath1 using the usual form of the ckm matrix parameterization :    @xmath10 , \\label{km}\\ ] ]    where @xmath11 and @xmath12 denote the cosine and the sine of the respective arguments .",
    "thus @xmath7 in vacuum can be written as : @xmath13 with @xmath14 and @xmath15 where @xmath16 and the well known jarlskog invariant  @xcite @xmath17    we can see from eqs .",
    "( [ dp]-[jcp ] ) that in vacuum @xmath18 so they are all simply referred to as @xmath19 .    on the other hand @xmath20 , which depends on the specific channel @xmath21 ,",
    "is given by : @xmath22    in practice , for a real experiment , one has to average the probabilities in eqs .",
    "( [ dp ] ) and ( [ acp ] ) over the corresponding experimental conditions , i.e. neutrino energy spectrum , distance @xmath23 , efficiencies etc .",
    "we have studied the experimental constraints imposed on the neutrino oscillation probabilities by several experimental results . in order to obtain realistic constraints we have , for each experiment , averaged the corresponding probability over its distributions of @xmath23 and neutrino energy .",
    "this will be denoted by @xmath24 in what follows .    in the terrestrial case",
    "we have taken the results from two short baseline accelerator experiments lsnd  @xcite and e776  @xcite for the channels @xmath25 and @xmath26 respectively . to analyze lsnd",
    "we have used the simple model quoted in ref .  @xcite . in the case of",
    "e776 the neutrino beam energy spectrum was taken from ref .",
    "+ lsnd : @xmath27    e776 : @xmath28    for the oscillation channel @xmath29 we have used the data from chorus  @xcite .",
    "the chorus relevant information is available at their web site  @xcite .",
    "this short baseline accelerator experiment gives    @xmath30    we have obtained from chooz  @xcite , a long baseline reactor experiment searching for the disappearance of the @xmath31 , the limit :    @xmath32    and from the bugey  @xcite reactor experiment    @xmath33    we have read out the positron energy spectrum for chooz from ref .",
    "@xcite and for bugey from ref .",
    "@xcite and used the relation @xmath34 to extract the neutrino energy spectrum .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ expt ] our own reproduction of the exclusion ( allowed in the case of lsnd ) regions of these experiments .",
    "we observe a reasonable agreement with the original experimental plots that can be found in refs .",
    "this is a demonstration that eqs .",
    "( [ plsnd]-[pbugey ] ) correctly represent the constraints coming from these reactor and accelerator neutrino experiments .    in the case of atmospheric neutrinos",
    ", we only have used the latest sk  @xcite result since it is the most precise one .",
    "we have performed our analysis of sk atmospheric data in the following way .",
    "we have separately used the muon neutrino events ( @xmath35-like events ) ratio    @xmath36    and the electron neutrino events ( @xmath37-like events ) ratio    @xmath38    where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the distributions of monte carlo @xmath35-like and @xmath37-like events taken from ref .",
    "@xcite and @xmath41 is a constant to take into account the overall normalization .",
    "we have taken the value of this constant to be 1.16 in accordance with ref .",
    "we have introduced in eqs .",
    "( [ rmu ] ) and ( [ re ] ) the shorthand @xmath42 .",
    "the probabilities @xmath43 have been smeared by the resolution function given in ref .",
    "@xcite at each @xmath2 value .    on the other hand , from fig .  4 of ref .",
    "@xcite we can read eight different values of @xmath2 and their corresponding @xmath35-like and @xmath37-like ratios . using this",
    "we have calculated the simple average of each ratio obtaining :    @xmath44    defining two allowed bands , one for the @xmath37-like events and the other for the @xmath35-like events ratio .",
    "these are our selection criteria coming from sk data which were used in the following way : for a given set of values of the mass squared differences , the mixing angles and the phase we have computed the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ rmu ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ re ] ) taking an average over the eight @xmath2 bins and verifying if they satisfy the conditions given by eqs .",
    "( [ remu ] ) .",
    "it is important to stress that working with @xmath35-like and @xmath37-like event ratios separately has the advantage that we are able to constraint independently @xmath45 and @xmath46 . indeed doing this",
    "we observe that these probabilities are always below a few % , this is much more stringent that the sk analysis shown in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it must be noted that this simple sk analysis is not totally rigorous , in fact by using the @xmath2 distribution from ref .",
    "@xcite we only work with a sub - sample of the sk data ( fully - contained events ) .",
    "moreover there are quite large uncertainties in the determination of this distribution due to the fact that one relies on the observed final lepton to infer the neutrino physical quantities , these uncertainties are discussed in ref .",
    "nevertheless we consider our approach good enough for the goals of this paper .    since the eqs .",
    "( [ plsnd]-[remu ] ) are in fact independent of the number of neutrino generations we are now free to use these probability limits in the three neutrino flavor framework .",
    "in order to determine the maximum permitted values of @xmath7 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 we proceed in the following way .",
    "we choose randomly different values of the mixing parameters @xmath51 and @xmath52 taken in the interval @xmath53 $ ] .",
    "for each drawn set of these parameters we evaluate the values corresponding to eqs .",
    "( [ plsnd]-[re ] ) .",
    "we check if they simultaneously pass all the experimental constraints given in eqs .",
    "( [ plsnd]-[pbugey ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ remu ] ) .",
    "it really means that we look for a common allowed region among all experiments . in the positive case",
    "we compute the @xmath0 violation factor @xmath54 for fixed values of the phase angle @xmath55 .",
    "we select among them the maximal value of @xmath54 , @xmath56 , for each @xmath55 and calculate the corresponding values of @xmath57 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 for @xmath2 varying from 40 to 250 .    in tables",
    "[ jmax1]-[jmax2 ] we show @xmath56 for @xmath58 ev@xmath59 and @xmath60 ev@xmath59 .",
    "we have picked these values so one can have an idea of the order of the variations that @xmath56 will have if one varies @xmath61 inside the lsnd allowed region .",
    "in general we see that the values of @xmath56 in the squared mass difference interval considered in this paper are more or less stable and of @xmath62 in agreement with ref .",
    "@xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ deltap ] we show @xmath57 as a function of @xmath2 for @xmath63 = 1 .",
    "as one could guess the oscillating behavior of this curve is dictated by the sum of sines in eq .",
    "( [ dp ] ) .",
    "we are not showing here other curves for different values of @xmath63 since they have exactly the same form as these ones , only the oscillation amplitude will change in accordance to the corresponding @xmath56 .",
    "we observe that the maximal value of @xmath64 , which increase with @xmath2 , are of the @xmath65 .",
    "this is in accordance with the estimations given in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in figs .",
    "[ acpfig1]-[acpfig2 ] we show the behavior of @xmath49 and @xmath50 as a function of @xmath2 for @xmath63=1 .",
    "we can observe that @xmath66 grows and @xmath67 decreases as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "also the maximal values for @xmath66 are of the @xmath68 while for @xmath67 they are of the @xmath69 .",
    "this result was expected since we know that the only difference between @xmath66 and @xmath67 , in vacuum , comes from the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ acp ] ) and @xmath45 is currently very much suppressed by data while sk data seems to support @xmath70 oscillations that can reach the order of @xmath71 for neutrinos coming from bellow the horizon .    as we have already mentioned at the end of sec .",
    "[ sec1 ] one has to be careful in interpreting our results in relation to future experiments and remember to take into account the average over the corresponding @xmath2 distribution . because we did not want to make any ad - hoc hypothesis on @xmath2 distribution we have deliberately chosen not to do any smearing on @xmath2 .",
    "we believe that presenting our results in this unfolded way make them more useful and ready to be applied to any real experimental situation .    to illustrate the implications of our results in future experiments we have put an arrow in fig .",
    "[ deltap]-[acpfig2 ] at the corresponding mean value of @xmath2 for minos  @xcite , k2k  @xcite and one of the possible configurations of a long baseline neutrino experiment using neutrinos from a muon collider  @xcite . based on our results",
    "we also have computed an estimation , averaging over the expected energy spectrum , of the maximal values that can be investigated at minos : @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 ; and k2k : @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 .",
    "all these values are , as expected , lower than the ones shown by the corresponding arrows in fig .",
    "[ deltap]-[acpfig2 ] since in the @xmath2 scope of minos / k2k the dominant scale is @xmath78 , the contribution from @xmath61 being averaged out .",
    "we have found the maximal allowed values for @xmath79 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 as a function of @xmath2 and @xmath63 .",
    "this was done in the three neutrino flavor framework using the most stringent constraints from recent neutrino data and admitting the two mass squared differences to be @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "in fact this is in a way complementary to ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is important to remark that we have adopted here a different approach from the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite since we do not make any assumptions about the mixing parameters other than the two squared mass difference scales and work with the probability expression without any approximation .",
    "besides we have explicitly used the experimental resolution functions in our calculations .",
    "we have seen that in general the values of @xmath1 are much more sizable than the corresponding @xmath79 .",
    "in fact , admitting the mass hierarchy considered in this paper , we have shown that the present neutrino data tremendously suppress the maximal values @xmath19 that can be investigated at the next generation of neutrino experiments .",
    "in addition since in the asymmetry the systematic errors cancel out , even if the absolute flux of the neutrino beam is determined with an accuracy of 10 @xmath82 it may be possible to measure @xmath0 violation at 1 @xmath82 level .",
    "this is particularly interesting since in long baseline experiment there are expected matter effects that fake genuine @xmath0 violation  @xcite . in a forthcoming paper",
