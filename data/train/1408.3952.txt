    "recently , many efforts have been devoted to study quantum computation and information theory using different approaches .",
    "these activities have brought new understanding of the fundamental physics associated with quantum theories @xcite .",
    "it is shown that the quantum bit or the qubit , which is based on a superposition of the two possible states , is considered as the most basic building block of such quantum theories .",
    "in fact , qubit and its generalizations are connected to many theories including string theory , d - branes , black holes , toric geometry and supermanifolds @xcite . a particular emphasis put on the link with the black holes and branes obtained from supergravity models in high dimensions .",
    "more precisely , a nice interplay between the stu black holes having eight charges and three qubits have been proposed and developed in @xcite .",
    "more recently , many works have suggested extended models using different ways . in connection with supersymmetry",
    ", superqubits get developed using @xmath9 lie superalgebra @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the qudit , which is a @xmath2-level quantum system , emerge naturally in the extended models by considering more than two bosonic states on which the qubit is built .",
    "it is recalled that @xmath1 qudits can be characterized by a couple @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 indicate the number of the qudits and the states respectively . here",
    ", we refer to these systems as @xmath0 quantum systems .",
    "inspection shows that there have been some attempts to dealt with such quantum systems but unfortunately with partial results only .",
    "the aim of the paper is to enrich these activities by proposing a new way to deal the qudits using toric geometry and its relation to type ii d - branes placed at singularities of calabi - yau manifolds used in the string theory compactification . in particular , we relate the @xmath0 quantum systems to the holomorphic sections of the line bundles on @xmath1 dimensional projective spaces @xmath10 with degree @xmath4 .",
    "using toric geometry technics , these sections are in one - to - one correspondence with @xmath5 integral points on @xmath1-dimensional simplex .",
    "to give an explicit analysis , a particular interest has been on lower dimensional examples .",
    "then , we explore the local mirror map to elaborate a linkage between the @xmath0 quantum system and type ii d - branes placed at toric singularities . @xmath6 and @xmath7 are analyzed in some details and are found to be related to the mirror of the ale space with the @xmath8 singularity and a generalized conifold respectively .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we give a short review on the qubit and qudit systems .",
    "section 3 concerns a toric description of the @xmath6 quantum systems while the generalization to @xmath0 ones is discussed in section 4 . in section 5",
    ", we propose a string theory interpretation in terms of type ii d - branes placed at toric calabi - yau singularities using local mirror symmetry .",
    "section 6 contains some including remarks .",
    "inspired by toric varieties and motivated by the existence of combinatorial calculations in quantum information , we use toric geometry to handle multiple of qudit systems .",
    "concretely , we elaborate a toric description in terms of holomorphic section of line bundles on the projective spaces @xmath3 . then , we propose a stringy interpretation using type ii d - branes placed at mirror calabi - yau singularities used in the string theory compactification . to end , let us first recall the qubit which has been extensively studied using different physical and mathematical approaches @xcite .",
    "the qubit is a two state system which can be realized , for instance , by the position of the electron in the hydrogen atom .",
    "the superposition state of a single qubit is generally given by the following dirac notation @xmath11 where @xmath12 are complex numbers satisfying the normalization condition @xmath13 it is observed that this equation can be interpreted geometrically in terms of the so called bloch sphere @xcite . the analysis can be extended to more than one qubit which has been used to discuss entanglement states .",
    "in fact , the two qubits are four level systems . using the usual notation @xmath14 ,",
    "the corresponding state superposition can be expressed as @xmath15 are complex numbers verifying now the following normalization condition @xmath16 @xmath1 qubits , in fact , are @xmath17 configuration states which can be represented by graphs sharing a strong resemblance with a particular class of adinkras formed by @xmath17 nodes connected with @xmath1 colored lines @xcite .",
    "this observation has been explored to show a new similarity between @xmath1 qubit systems and @xmath17 cycles embedded in @xmath1-dimensional torii @xmath18 . in this way",
    ", a quantum state has been interpreted as the poincar dual of the real homology cycle in @xmath18 on which type ii d - branes can wrap to generate black holes in the compactification of type iia superstring on @xmath18 .      as in the case of qubits ,",
    "the qudits represent , for instance , a physical system of spin @xmath19 particles with @xmath2 states . in the basis formed by the states @xmath20",
    ", the general state can be written as follows @xmath21 where @xmath12 are complex numbers satisfying now the extended normalization condition @xmath22 for the organization reason , one may be interested in characterizing the multiple of qudits .",
    "in fact , it should be evident to characterize them by a couple @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 indicate the number of the qudits and the states respectively . using a similar qubit notation",

    "our main objective is to explore the toric geometry language , and related topics including string theory compactification , to deal with the @xmath0 quantum systems .",
    "in this section , we borrow the idea of toric geometry to discuss qudits and make contact with other physics including the compactification of higher dimensional theories . we thus are considering a basic correspondence by replacing states by holomorphic sections of line bundles on toric varieties . before going ahead , we first start by giving some basic facts on toric geometry being one of the most useful mathematical tools used in superstrings , m and f - theories @xcite . indeed ,",
    "a @xmath1-dimensional toric variety @xmath24 is a complex manifold which can be represented by a toric graph known by polytope @xmath25 consisting of @xmath26 vertices @xmath27 in an @xmath28 lattice satisfying @xmath29 where @xmath30 are called mori vectors .",

    "it is interesting to note , in passing , that the local calabi - yau condition is satisfied by the following relation @xmath32 familiar examples of toric varieties , which have many applications in both mathematics and quantum physics , are the complex projective spaces @xmath33@xcite . for @xmath33 , @xmath30 reduce to a simple vector @xmath34 with @xmath35 and",
    "the equation ( [ toric ] ) becomes a simple relation given by @xmath36 forming a @xmath1-dimensional simplex which will be explored to discuss holomorphic sections of the line bundles on @xmath33 .",
    "having introduced the mathematical backgrounds , we move now to present a toric description of a single qudit . for a sake of simplicity ,",
    "we consider quantum trit or qutrit associated with the couple @xmath37 .",
    "it is a three level system which can be simulated by a physical system dealing with spin-1 particles .",
    "it can be also realized by the degree of freedom of a photon living in five dimensional space - time , which can be obtained from the string theory compactification on a 5-dimensional compact sapce . in this way ,",
    "a superposition state is a vector of a three dimensional hilbert space , given by latexmath:[\\[\\label{state1 } |\\psi\\rangle = a_0|0\\rangle+a_1 |1\\rangle+a_2    basis .",
