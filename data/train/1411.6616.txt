    "cosmological inflation @xcite not only explains the homogeneity of the universe on very large scales , but provides a theory for the seeds of structure , explaining the observed level of anisotropy .",
    "typical slow - roll models generically predict gaussian , adiabatic and nearly scale - invariant primordial fluctuations , but it is ultimately observations of the galaxy distribution and the microwave background anisotropies which determine the shape of the primordial spectra .",
    "the simplest assumption is that the initial spectrum has a power - law form , parameterised in terms of the spectral amplitude @xmath4 and the spectral indices @xmath5 , where the _ i _ refers to scalar or tensor components .",
    "recent analyses have shown , however , that the spectral index may deviate from a constant value ( close to unity ) and so consideration of models that provide some running of the index is warranted @xcite .",
    "the inflationary sector of the models explored in this paper is given by the potential @xmath6 where @xmath1 is a positive constant less or equal to one and @xmath2 is the scale of ( pseudo nambu - goldstone ) symmetry breaking .",
    "was originally proposed to justify the inflationary potential in the context of high energy physics , where the inflaton is a pseudo nambu - goldstone boson resulting from symmetry breaking @xcite . however , as we also show in this paper , when tested against observations , @xmath2 lies above the planck scale .",
    "this is usually attributed to the fact that the same inflaton must end inflation after at least 50 e - folds of expansion .    to overcome this possible weakness in the   model , other",
    ", more complete and equally well motivated models have been formulated . in particular , the _ hybrid natural inflation _ ( ) model was first presented in @xcite .",
    "the model is an improvement over  in that a waterfall - like auxiliary field @xcite is considered to end inflation thus allowing the scale @xmath2 to get planckian or sub - planckian values .",
    "it is thus imperative to constrain the parameter space of the model with the observations at hand . in this paper",
    "we derive constraints for the parameters of the   model when subject to the latest cmb observations .",
    "we do this for two cases : one with no priors on the model parameters , and a second case where the symmetry breaking scale @xmath2 takes the planck value .    in an effort to restore realistic values of the symmetry breaking parameter @xmath2 , we relieve the inflaton in   from the requirement of ending inflation , and endow the model with a second , waterfall scalar field , responsible of the end of inflation ( see @xcite for the details ) .",
    "in fact , if we set the parameter @xmath7 in eq .  , we recover a hybrid version of _ natural inflation _ ( ) , we call this scenario _ waterfall natural inflation _ ( ) . with the constraints imposed by observations at hand , we explore the theoretical and phenomenological differences between   and . throughout this paper",
    "we carry two parallel analyses . a first analysis only taking the planck data on account , with the wmap polarisation data @xcite , and a second analysis taking the bicep2 polarisation data as a product of primordial gravitational waves , as reported in the collaboration paper @xcite .",
    "alternative interpretations of these results , attributing the polarisation signal to foreground dust are still to be confirmed by the planck satellite and hence the motivation to contrast both datasets studied here .",
    "our presentation is organized as follows : in section  [ frame ] we present both models of inflation , _ hni _ and , identifying the inflationary stage and the form of their spectral parameters . in section  [ results ]",
    "we present likelihood contours of parameter values , in light of the latest planck data release @xcite and wmap polarization maps ( wp ) @xcite , hereafter planck+wp ; and separately for the combination of planck+wp and the results of the bicep2 experiment @xcite ( here pl+ wp+bicep2 .",
    "we do this for three different cases : the general _ hni _ model with no priors on the pair of parameters @xmath8 , the case @xmath9 corresponding to , and finally the case with no prior over @xmath1 but with the symmetry breaking scale @xmath2 restricted to the largest physical value @xmath10 , in planck units . in section  [ analyses ] we analyse the featured results identifying pathological cases where either the scale @xmath2 acquires unphysically large values , or where the running could over - produce primordial black holes , as is the case for other models of inflation where the potential slope flattens toward the end of inflation @xcite .",
    "finally , in section  [ conclu ] we conclude by discussing the observational and theoretical constraints to the featured models .",
    "in slow - roll inflation , the spectral indices are given in terms of the slow - roll parameters of the models , which involve the potential @xmath11 and its derivatives ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) @xmath12here primes denote derivatives with respect to the inflaton @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the reduced planck mass @xmath15 which we set @xmath16 in most of what follows . in the slow - roll approximation observables",
    "are given by ( see e.g. @xcite,@xcite ) @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes the running of the tensor index , @xmath19 the running of the scalar index and @xmath20 the running of the running , in a self - explanatory notation .",
    "the density perturbation at wave number @xmath21 is @xmath22 , the scale of inflation is @xmath23 with @xmath24 and @xmath25 the ratio of tensor to scalar perturbations .",
    "all the quantities with a subindex @xmath26 are evaluated at the scale @xmath27 , at which the perturbations are produced , some @xmath28 e - folds before the end of inflation .",
    "in particular the pivot scale is set to @xmath29 @xcite . the limited number of slow - roll parameters in eq .",
    "yields consistency relations between inflation observables , e.g. , @xmath30 where we simplify by defining @xmath31 .",
    "it is a well established convention to assume a parameterised form for the spectra of scalar and tensor perturbations , and the simplest shape is that of a power - law , parameterised in terms of the spectral amplitude @xmath4 and the spectral indices @xmath5 , where the subindex @xmath32 refers to either scalar @xmath33 or tensor @xmath34 components .",
    "slow - roll inflation predicts the spectrum of curvature perturbations to be close to scale - invariant .",
    "based on this result , the primordial power spectra @xmath35 , scalar and tensor , are commonly expressed as : @xmath36 the vast amount of data at hand allows cosmologists to consider a more accurate description of the power spectra @xcite .",
    "this improvement is parameterised by including the running , and even the running of the running of scalar perturbations @xcite . in this case , the expressions above become , following @xcite , @xmath37 all indices are such that , for example , @xmath38 stands @xmath39 implicitly throughout the paper .",
    "thus we may consider scale dependent indices as , @xmath40    although the power - law spectra of eqs .",
    "( [ ss1 ] ) and ( [ ts1 ] ) have provided reasonable agreement with cosmological observations , recent analyses of planck data have shown that if a running of the scalar spectral - index be a free parameter , there exists a preference for a negative running - value at 2@xmath41 @xcite . on the other hand , the additional parameters ( @xmath42 ) do not only help to describe the underlying model more accurately on observable scales , but they also allow for additional shapes of the potential at stages of inflation away from the observable range .",
    "in general , we want to avoid positive values of the running as they may result in an over - production of primordial black holes ( pbhs ) at the smallest scales , near the end of inflation @xcite . we will address this point for the case of  in sec .",
    "[ analyses ] .",
    "let us now focus on the inflationary sector of the model given by the potential of eq .  .",
    "the running and running of the running of the scalar power spectrum satisfy the following relations @xcite @xmath43 from eq .   for the spectral index we obtain an expression for @xmath2 involving the second parameter of the model",
    ", @xmath1 : @xmath44 it is thus evident that in a slow - roll stage , this model is fully described in terms of the parameter @xmath45 alone .",
    "the _ hni _",
    "model allows for more flexibility in the potential , since the constraint coming from the number of e - folds does not fix @xmath2 .",
    "the end of inflation is specified by a waterfall field which plays no role during inflation .",
    "when considering the particular case @xmath9 we are reduced to a _ waterfall _ version of natural inflation .    in fig .",
    "[ ps ] , we plot @xmath2 and @xmath19 in terms of @xmath1 , at a fixed @xmath46 and for @xmath47 values .",
    "if we assume the values of bicep2 of the order @xmath48 ( red lines ) , for @xmath9 the running tends to be very close to zero and @xmath49 . on the other hand , if we consider values allowed by planck ( blue lines ) , @xmath2 values decreases to order @xmath50 .",
    "similarly for @xmath51 values ( black dashed line ) , @xmath1 tends to be order of @xmath52 and hence @xmath53 for bicep2 and @xmath54 for planck values ( see however subsection [ resultsf ] , where we fix @xmath2 to the value @xmath51 and study its consequences ) .    from fig .",
    "1 we can identify the corner of parameter space where a theoretically consistent value for @xmath2 ( @xmath55 ) is obtained during slow - roll .",
    "we go further to constrain the   model by employing the most recent tracers of the cmb . in particular",
    ", we use the latest release of planck dataset @xcite which , combined with the nine - year wmap polarisation maps @xcite , allow to constrain the temperature and polarisation spectra ( t , e and b components ) . furthermore , we provide a joint - analysis with the bicep2 data release @xcite , interpreting these results as a non - vanishing tensor contributions . to carry out the exploration of the parameter space , we incorporate the   potential into the standard cosmological equations , by performing the minor modifications to the camb code @xcite .",
    "we use the camb runs to explore the parameter space with the software cosmomc @xcite . throughout the analysis we consider purely gaussian adiabatic scalar and tensor perturbations .",
    "we assume a standard @xmath23cdm model specified by the following parameters : the physical baryon density @xmath56 and cdm density @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the dimensionless hubble parameter such that @xmath59 kms@xmath60mpc@xmath60 ; @xmath61 , which is @xmath62 the ratio of the sound horizon to angular diameter distance at last scattering surface , and the optical depth @xmath63 at reionisation .",

    "the results suggest that , when leaving @xmath2 arbitrary , _ hni _ shows no significant improvement over _ wni _ since @xmath2 has to be bigger that one and the running uninterestingly small .",
    "more interestingly , the planck+wp+bicep2 data favour a vanishing running but with a parameter @xmath1 close to one ( @xmath71 ) and @xmath72 as shown in table  [ table1 ] , instead of the small and always negative running of _ wni _ with @xmath9 and larger @xmath2 @xcite .",

    "one of the main motivations for introducing the model of _ hni _",
    "@xcite , where the end of inflation is not triggered by the slow - rolling inflaton field but by a second waterfall field , is to release the parameter @xmath2 from inflationary constraints and to have values equal or less than the planck scale . being @xmath2 the scale of ( nambu - goldstone ) symmetry breaking it is desirable not to surpass the planck value as occurs in ordinary _ ni _ , where the same field which produces inflation is also in charge of terminating it . what we see from fig .",
    "[ fighnif1 ] is that _ hni _ with @xmath51 is consistent with planck+wp data alone but , when taking running through the bicep2 dataset the overlap is almost vanishing .",
    "this evidences a strong tension between the two datasets for the model .",
    "also , a set value for the parameter @xmath2 , means that the single degree of freedom @xmath1 determines the value of the other parameters .",

    "let us now analyse the results presented above in terms of the self - consistency of the models and the consistency with the constraints imposed by the null observations of primordial black holes . from figs .",
    "[ fighniaf ] and [ fighnia1 ] , we immediately read that the model requires a symmetry breaking parameter @xmath2 with a value well above the planck scale which we consider undesirable . requiring that the scale @xmath2 is at most @xmath51 , in planck units , we get fig .  [ fighnif1 ] where we see that   is still compatible with the planck+wp data . when combined with the bicep2 data however , we find that there is a strong tension between the two datasets with an almost vanishing overlap .",
    "this is most evident from the combined data plotted in fig .",
    "[ ps1 ] . to get a handle of these results we present in table  [ table1 ] the mean values for the model parameters @xmath2 and @xmath1 as well as for the observable tensor @xmath65 , spectral index @xmath3 and running @xmath19 for the three cases of   studied here .",
    "when , for the case @xmath51 , we combine both datasets there is an additional constraint coming from the possible over - production of primordial black holes ( pbhs ) . the large positive value of the running @xmath19 in fig",
    ".  [ fighnif1 ] ( see also fig .",
    "[ ps ] ) , could invert the red spectrum of scalar perturbations and induce , at small scales , inhomogeneities with amplitudes ruled out by observations . following the argument of @xcite , the undesired amplitude for perturbations at which pbhs could be over - produced",
    "is @xmath74 ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) . since this is most likely to happen toward the end of inflation , when the number of remaining e - folds of inflation is @xmath75 , the inflaton field has the order of 50 or 60 e - folds to evolve from the initial @xmath76 to the pbhs overproduction value .",

    "such truncated expansions may seem incomplete to evaluate the amplitude of the spectrum , at about 50 e - folds away from observable scales , but they have been successfully employed to constrain undetermined parameters ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",

    "the right hand side then imposes a constraint on positive values of the running . substituting the values of table  [ table1 ]",
    "we see that the model with @xmath10 is restricted to values of the running @xmath80 , which practically excludes the central value of the parameter adjusting the planck+wp+bicep2 data .",
    "note that for this same model , the planck+wp data yield a smaller value of @xmath81 , which is not excluded by the abundance of pbhs .",
    "our calculation shows that , when the bicep2 data is interpreted as a signature of primordial gravitational waves , the model of   with @xmath51 would be discarded .",
    "we find that when the scale of symmetry breaking @xmath2 is left unrestricted , _ hybrid natural inflation _ is not essentialy different from natural inflation both favouring a small running consistent with a vanishing value .",
    "the case where @xmath51 , however , is consistent with planck+wp data alone but not when combined with bicep2 data .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fighnif1 ] evidencing a strong tension between both data sets .",
    "table  [ table1 ] shows that when the planck+wp+bicep2 data is used ,   with @xmath51 is disfavoured since the spectral index starts moving away from observed values . at the ultraviolet end of the spectrum ,",
    "the over - production of pbhs imposes a bound on the value of the running @xmath82 .",
    "this has also been reported in previous works of single - field inflation : for running mass inflation @xcite and for the more general hilltop inflationary models @xcite .",
    "the common feature shared by these models and  is that the slope of the inflationary potential flattens toward the end of inflation , allowing for both a large number of e - folds and an enhancement in the amplitude of field fluctuations .",
    "two comments are in place regarding the validity of constraints derived from bicep2 and the bounds to pbhs abundance .",
    "recent observations @xcite have raised doubts regarding the cleanliness of the bicep2 data . additionally , our results seem to support the argument that bicep2 data at face value may be incompatible with slow - roll inflation in general @xcite .",
    "thus , a conclusive analysis on the feasibility of  awaits more data .    on the other hand ,",
    "recent studies have shown that the formation of pbhs is not solely determined by the amplitude of perturbations .",
    "indeed , not all profiles of overdensities with a common amplitude will get to form pbhs @xcite , and the probability of formation might be significantly reduced , @xcite . on the other hand , the overproduction of pbhs at the end of inflation could trigger the subsequent reheating period @xcite . while this argument requires fine - tuning",
    ", it is worth exploring the final stages of inflation since , in addition to the analysis above , a waterfall field , like the one expected to end inflation in the models studied here , is likely to produce pbhs copiously at the end of inflation @xcite .",
    "we leave the study of these possibilities for future work .    in conclusion ,",
    "our results show that when we force  to desirable values of the symmetry breaking parameter , the @xmath51 case is compatible with planck+wp - only data but not when combined with bicep2 since a smaller spectral index @xmath38 is favoured and over - production of pbhs at the end of inflation occurs .",
    "this disagreement is not yet ruling out the @xmath10 scenario given that the polarisation data from planck @xcite , indicates that the signal detected by bicep2 may be completely due to galactic dust",
