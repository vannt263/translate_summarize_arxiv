    "<S> the asymptotic low temperature dependence in different directions must be identical for @xmath10 , where @xmath11 here @xmath12 is the inelastic scattering rate . </S>",
    "<S> anderson and zhou@xmath13 conjectured that the renormalized matrix elements @xmath14 in cuo compounds at low temperatures due to orthogonality effects . </S>",
    "<S> an alternative conjecture@xmath15 put forward to resolve the issue is that @xmath16 also @xmath17 as @xmath8 due to impurity scattering in a non fermi - liquid . </S>",
    "<S> recent experiments@xmath18 measuring the resistivity at low temperatures by suppressing @xmath2 in a large magnetic field support this conjecture and find @xmath19 at low temperature . </S>",

    "<S> the pole in the single particle green s function , the quasiparticle , vanishes at the chemical potential and is replaced by a branch - cut . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath26 may be used to characterize a non fermi - liquid . the gentlest departure from a landau fermi - liquid with @xmath27 </S>",
    "<S> has been termed a marginal fermi - liquid.@xmath28    the observed linear temperature dependence of the resistivity and corresponding behavior of the frequency dependent conductivity implies directly that the momentum scattering rate , @xmath29 , in cu - o compounds is proportional to @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> the imaginary part of the single particle self - energy @xmath31 can not have a higher power dependence on @xmath32 than the momentum scattering rate . through kramers - kronig transformation , this implies @xmath26 . </S>",

    "<S> this can be done to a considerable extent without reference to any microscopic theory of the non - fermi - liquid . </S>",

    "<S> of course @xmath36 may depend on @xmath37 .    </S>",
    "<S> consider impurities which in the absence of electron - electron interactions have finite s - wave scattering amplitude.@xmath39 the vertex correction due to the interactions will in general introduce scattering into higher partial waves . </S>",
    "<S> but there is no reason why the s - wave scattering should vanish . </S>",
    "<S> consider only this part for which the forward scattering limit characterizes the properties . in this limit </S>",
    "<S> , a ward identity provides the vertex including the effect of electron - electron interactions .    </S>",
    "<S> let the bare impurity potential be @xmath40 where @xmath41 are the position of the impurities assumed randomly distributed . </S>",
    "<S> we will assume also that @xmath42 and the concentration of impurities @xmath43 is low enough so that the mean - free path @xmath44 calculated without electronic renormalizations satisfies @xmath45 . </S>",

    "<S> if an impurity couples to a non - conserved quantity , ( for instance for cu - o compounds , it can change the equilibrium charge difference between cu and o in a unit cell or alter the local kinetic energy in a cu - o bond ) a ward - identity gives that@xmath49 ( at @xmath50 ) , @xmath51 where @xmath52 the self - energy due to impurities from such a vertex for a given impurity configuration illustrated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1a ) is @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 is the exact single particle green s function including the effect of impurities .    in eq . </S>",

    "<S> vertex renormalization which spans across impurities , such as in fig . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1b ) are proportional to @xmath56 so that ( 8) may be considered asymptotically exact .    </S>",
    "<S> the strategy adopted here is to first evaluate a subset of the processes in the expression ( 8) , which are expected to be the most singular . </S>",
    "<S> the result so obtained is used to calculate corrections which show that the expectation is borne out . </S>",
    "<S> the most singular processes for the impurity averaged self - energy are expected to be given by the self - consistent born approximation represented by fig . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1c ) : @xmath57 where we include in @xmath58 the self - energy @xmath59 which includes @xmath60 as well as @xmath61 .    assuming a constant density of states @xmath62 over a bandwidth @xmath63 in the pure limit , ( other assumptions about the pure density of states do not produce any essential difference ) , eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 9 ) gives @xmath64 where @xmath65 . for @xmath66 </S>",
    "<S> evaluated from the marginal self - energy and for @xmath67 , @xmath68    in the opposite limit @xmath69 the above results are valid for @xmath70 . for @xmath71 should be substituted for @xmath72 in eqs . </S>",

    "<S> the cross - over from ( 11 ) to ( 12 ) occurs for @xmath73 or at @xmath74 at @xmath75 note that below @xmath76 the density of states near the fermi - energy : @xmath77 which approaches zero at the chemical potential .    </S>",
    "<S> the two major omissions in evaluating ( 7 ) in the self - consistent born approximation are ( i ) possible strong renormalized scattering from a given impurity and ( ii ) interference effects between scattering at different impurities . consider the former . </S>",
    "<S> for fermi - liquids the singular scattering from a given impurity in the born - approximation is remedied by evaluating the t - matrix , fig . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1d ) : @xmath78 the @xmath79 matrix obeys the unitary limit @xmath80 as @xmath66 becomes very small ( but not zero ) , as in heavy fermions . </S>",
    "<S> this is because for fermi - liquids @xmath81 , the bare density of states , independent of the value of @xmath66 .    </S>",
    "<S> we may check the validity of the self - consistent born approximation by evaluating the corrections to the self - energy due to ( 16 ) by using @xmath82 in ( 16 ) . </S>",
    "<S> now we note that on impurity averaging , one gets correction terms @xmath83\\ ] ] using ( 15 ) , we see that the singularity due to @xmath84 is cancelled out to all orders leaving an analytic correction of @xmath85 </S>",
    "<S> .    we may similarly consider correction due to crossed graphs , fig . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1e ) . </S>",
    "<S> again the renormalized density of state cancels the singularity in @xmath86 and the corrections are successive powers of @xmath87 . </S>",
    "<S> since interference between scatterers is not important , the wavefunctions are not localized ; the important effect is the vanishing of the density of states at the chemical potential , as in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 15 ) .    for @xmath26 , eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 12 ) is modified to @xmath88 so the effects of impurities are more singular .    </S>",
    "<S> the most important effect neglected above is the renormalization by impurities of the fluctuation which produced the non - fermi - liquid state in the pure limit . </S>",
    "<S> this can not be discussed without a microscopic theory for such fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> a theory of such fluctuations has been constructed@xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> the corrections to the fluctuations due to impurities have been briefly examined which appear not to change the results here in an essential way . </S>",
    "<S> this matter is however far from being settled . at this point </S>",
    "<S> it is best to leave this as an assumption and to point out that the results thus obtained appear to agree with experiments , as discussed below .    a prediction following from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 15 ) is that the specific heat @xmath89 and the magnetic susceptibility @xmath90 have the forms @xmath91 , for @xmath92 . for s - wave scattering by impurities , there are no backward scattering ( vertex ) corrections for the calculation of resistivity . </S>",
    "<S> the resistivity can then be calculated from the single particle green s function alone and is proportional to @xmath93 for @xmath92 .    </S>",
    "<S> consider now the anisotropic resistivity of quasi - two - dimensional materials . </S>",
    "<S> two distinct temperature scales need to be defined to discuss the anisotropic resistivity of non - fermi - liquids . </S>",
    "<S> one of them is @xmath94 defined in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) , and the other is @xmath95 defined in eq . ( </S>",
    "<S> 14 ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath94 is enough to discuss fermi - liquids . for @xmath96 , </S>",
    "<S> the layers are mutually phase incoherent and momentum in is not conserved in the process of electron transfer between the planes . </S>",
    "<S> one can calculate @xmath97 by a tunneling rate calculation . </S>",
    "<S> the tunneling rate ( if the tunneling matrix element has some momentum dependence ) is proportional to the ( in - plane ) inelastic scattering rate . then @xmath98 . for @xmath99 </S>",
    "<S> a coherent propagation must prevail in a fermi - liquid and @xmath100 . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior is indeed observed , for example in @xmath101.@xmath102    for non - fermi - liquids two limiting cases can easily be distinguished . </S>",
    "<S> ( i ) @xmath103 : which occurs for highly anisotropic and fairly dirty materials . the resistivity in the c - direction increases with decreasing temperature for all temperatures but below @xmath94 . both @xmath16 and @xmath104 </S>",
    "<S> have similar temperature dependences below @xmath94 but for @xmath105 . </S>",
    "<S> very high quality samples of @xmath106 appear to fall in this class if we assume that in this low anisotropy material @xmath94 is above the measured temperature range . </S>",
    "<S> the more anisotropic dirty materials are consistent with class ( i ) but in the high quality samples studied @xmath95 is quite low , not too far from @xmath94 . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , in the measurements of boebinger et al.@xmath107 on @xmath108 , @xmath109 is estimated to be about 15 which with @xmath110 and @xmath111 , estimated from the slope of the linear restivity and the optical conductivity@xmath28 gives @xmath112 from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 17 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the temperature at which @xmath1 has a minima in the experiments and asymptotically below which a logarithmic temperature dependence is observed . </S>",
    "<S> systematic estimations of @xmath109 are not yet available to test eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 14 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the results here have possible applications to other situations where interactions lead to non - fermi - liquid properties in the pure limit . these include the quantum critical points in itinerant ferromagnets and antiferromagnets as well as the mysterious transitions in @xmath113.@xmath114 it would appear from the results here that disorder is strongly relevant at metal - insulator transitions otherwise driven by electronic correlations . the effect of disorder in driving @xmath115 appears stronger than the localization effect which sets in only for @xmath116 . </S>",
    "<S> the pseudo - particle green s function at the @xmath117 quantum hall effect also have a marginal fermi - liquid form.@xmath118 but since in this case the green s function is a gauge dependent object , a separate investigation is required for physical quantities .    </S>",
