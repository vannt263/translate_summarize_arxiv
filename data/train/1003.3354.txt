    "entangled states of composed quantum systems are a subject of particular interest since they manifest genuinely quantum mechanical properties @xmath0 they yield correlations between observables measured on the subsystems that can not be explained by any local realistic model @xcite . since entanglement is the primary resource that allows quantum communication and computation protocols to outperform classical ones @xcite , its investigation reaches far beyond fundamental concepts of quantum physics",
    ". it also has a central role in some macroscopic properties of solids - internal energy , heat capacity or magnetic susceptibility can reveal the existence of entanglement within solids in the thermodynamical limit @xcite .",
    "entanglement is further related to superfluidity , the meissner effect and flux quantization in superconductors as well as long range order correlations in bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) @xcite .",
    "a natural framework for considering systems composed of parts , which are associated with disconnected regions of space , is quantum field theory with its causal and local structure , where one may treat fields supported on spacelike separated regions as subsystems . here we will consider the entanglement of the relativistic vacuum state .",
    "this is not only thought to be connected with black holes thermodynamics @xcite or the holographic principle @xcite , but also to manifest itself in the bekenstein - hawking black hole radiation @xcite and unruh acceleration effects @xcite .",
    "there are a number of studies proving entanglement between spatial regions in the ground state of relativistic quantum field theory .",
    "the central result underlying all the `` proofs in principle '' is the reeh - schlieder theorem @xcite , formulated in the language of algebraic quantum field theory .",
    "let @xmath1 be a space - time region and @xmath2 the local algebra of all the operators with support in @xmath1 .",
    "is defined as the algebra generated by operators of the form @xmath3 , @xmath4 with test functions @xmath5 , @xmath6 . ]",
    "the theorem states that , for any state of finite energy @xmath7 ( in particular , the vacuum ) the subspace @xmath8 is dense in the entire hilbert space , which means that for an arbitrary state @xmath9 , we can find a sequence of _ local _ operations @xmath10 such that @xmath11 . in particular , we can reconstruct an arbitrary state @xmath12 in region @xmath13 by applying such operations in @xmath1 and then tracing outside @xmath13 .",
    "the vacuum is thus an entangled state as it allows for a remote state preparation @xcite .    as a consequence of the reeh - schlieder theorem and the positivity of a partially transposed separable density matrix , it is possible to prove that causally separated local regions are entangled in the vacuum state @xcite .",
    "there exist operators @xmath14 , @xmath15 in algebras @xmath2 , @xmath16 associated with causally separated regions @xmath1 , @xmath13 that allow for constructing an entanglement witness ( an operator whose mean value is larger or equal to zero for all separable states ) , which is violated ( i.e. negative ) in the vacuum reduced to these two regions .",
    "it is possible to choose operators @xmath14 , @xmath15 as annihilation or creation operators of some local bosonic modes but the explicit construction is not known .",
    "it is also possible to prove the existence of local , bipartite observables that allow violation of bell inequalities in the vacuum state @xcite , but , again , the specific form of these observables is not known .",
    "another result is that it is possible to locally couple two qubits ( detectors ) to the field in such a way that , after a finite time , the reduced state of such a pair of two - level systems has negative partial transpose @xcite . in this last case",
    ", one needs an explicit expression for the space - time dependence of the detector - field couplings . in order to prove entanglement for arbitrary separation of the detectors , these couplings need to be of a very specific , fine - tuned , form , involving superoscillating functions that require switching the sign of the interaction between the field and probes during the experiment",
    "this seems technically extremely demanding . along different lines",
    "( without referring to observables ) in @xcite entanglement between two separated segments of one - dimensional free klein - gordon field in the vacuum state is quantified by the logarithmic negativity which is investigated numerically and shown to be finite for both critical and noncritical field limit .",
    "to which extent can the vacuum of a quantum field be operationally accessed and used as an entanglement resource ? by integrating over scalar klein - gordon field operators with compactly supported real functions ",
    "i.e.  detection profiles localized in two regions of space  we define collective field operators ( and collective conjugate momenta ) . these weighted averages of operators allow reducing the vacuum to a system of two effective bosonic modes .",
    "to such a reduced state we apply the entanglement measure for continuous variables systems based on simon s criterion for separability @xcite .",
    "this approach has several advantages .",
    "since separability criteria for infinite - mode states are unknown , we need to reduce the vacuum to a more comprehensible system . our approach enables to quantify entanglement present in the resulting two - mode system , which is still infinite dimensional , unlike in @xcite , where entanglement is first transferred to two qubits .",
    "physical probes have finite spatial resolution , so introducing collective observables is a reasonable first approximation towards a more realistic treatment of the problem .",
    "finally , the klein - gordon field is the continuum limit of an infinite linear harmonic chain , and within this `` collective approach '' entanglement between blocks of oscillators in the ground state of the chain was found and quantified in @xcite .",
    "it is therefore interesting in itself to understand the relation between the field and the chain from this particular perspective .    in this paper",
    "we prove the existence of a critical distance between two regions of space above which two effective bosonic modes associated with the regions become separable . from the numerical analysis of the linear harmonic chain this critical distance",
    "is estimated to be of the order of the compton wavelength of the particle corresponding to the massive one - dimenisonal klein - gordon field ( the continuum limit of the linear harmonic chain ) .",

    "we give their definition in terms of the detection profiles and discuss the constraints on the latter .",
    "next , we derive one of the main results : the proof of the existence of a critical distance above which the modes defined within the collective operators approach , become separable .",
    "the section is closed with an explicit construction of the interaction needed to read out our observables .",
    "section [ sec : discrete ] deals with the linear harmonic chain .",
    "first , the relation between harmonic chain and continuous field is briefly reviewed .",
    "second , on the basis of numerical analysis , the optimal profiles ( maximizing the entanglement witness ) in the discrete case are described and the critical distance for them is obtained . for the optimal profiles in the continuum limit this distance",
    "is then estimated to be of the order of the particles compton wavelength . in sec .",
    "[ sec : field ] we give an explicit example of profiles that allow for defining entangled modes and present the numerical results obtained for this special case .",

    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in this paper we use a particular form of the separability criterion derived by simon @xcite , necessary and sufficient for two - mode gaussian states . following the original notation",
    ", we introduce a vector of phase space operators for the two modes system : @xmath17    where @xmath18 denotes transposition .",
    "canonical commutation relations ( ccr ) in natural units , i.e.  @xmath19 , can be concisely written in a matrix form @xmath20=i\\omega _ { ij},\\ ] ] where we use the two - mode symplectic matrix @xmath21    defining the variance matrix @xmath22 , where @xmath23 , we obtain a compact statement of the heisenberg uncertainty relations : @xmath24 every physical state has to satisfy this inequality .",
    "for separable states it must hold also after partial transposition .",
    "the effect of partial transposition at the level of variance matrix elements is only @xmath25 , provided that the system also satisfies @xmath26 which is always the case for us ( one can always find a local symplectic transformation that enforces a1 and a2 @xcite ) .",
    "thus , all physical separable states fulfilling a1 , a2 , satisfy the following inequality ( simon s criterion ) : @xmath27 in the case that the system additionally satisfies @xmath28 we can considerably simplify the separability criterion by first factorizing it @xmath29 notice that the second factor is always non positive .",
    "if it equals zero , both correlations @xmath30 and @xmath31 must vanish , but then also the first factor equals zero . so finally , the above inequality is equivalent to @xmath32 condition a3 is not satisfied for general profiles , but can be justified by physical assumptions ( e.g. , using the same detectors in regions a and b ) . in sec .  [",
    "sec : discrete ] this assumption will also be supported by numerical results .",
    "we also have some evidence that profiles that minimize the left - hand side of satisfy a3 ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : discrete ] ) .    to quantify entanglement",
    ", we will use the degree of entanglement given by @xmath33 for gaussian states @xmath34 iff the state is entangled . in this case",
    "@xmath35 is a monotonically increasing function of the negativity @xmath36 ( the absolute sum of the negative eigenvalues of the partially transposed density matrix ) : @xmath37 .",
    "the negativity is based on the peres - horodecki criterion @xcite and was shown to be an entanglement monotone @xcite .    in the literature",
    "there are plenty of other criteria which , as well as the one we use , are necessary and sufficient for gaussian states and also are phrased with second order correlations between phase space operators ( e.g.  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "it is then obvious that for gaussian states they all yield the same results .",
    "however , for non - gaussian states those criteria are only sufficient , so we should ask which of these is in general the strongest .",
    "in other words : are there any non - gaussian entangled states such that one criterion out of those mentioned above would detect it , whereas some other would fail ?",
    "the answer is negative : either all of them will be satisfied or all violated . from a physical point of view this is clear , simply because we can not discriminate gaussian from non - gaussian states on the basis of their variance matrices ( second order correlations ) .",
    "mathematically , it can be shown that all those criteria are given by the same inequality up to a local linear canonical transformation of modes .",
    "this means that the choice of any of these criteria results in the same set of states detected as entangled . in any case , as we are going to see , in this work we will only be concerned with gaussian states , so that ( and , when a3 is met ) will always provide necessary and sufficient conditions for separability .",
    "we consider a massive klein - gordon ( kg ) field .",

    "the vacuum state is defined by the property @xmath45    we study the possibility to detect entanglement in the vacuum state when the allowed measurements are constrained to field operators _ smeared _ over two bounded space - time regions ( _ collective _ field observables ) .",
    "our motivation is twofold : first , a field operator in a single space - time point is not a physical observable but a purely mathematical concept .",
    "physical probes always have finite spatial resolution , so introducing collective observables is a reasonable first approximation towards a more realistic treatment of the problem .",
    "second , since separability criteria for infinite - mode states are unknown , we want to reduce the vacuum to a system consisting of only two bosonic modes . in a general case ,",
    "the smearing is given by two different real functions @xmath46 , @xmath47 with compact supports and collective operators in the regions @xmath1 , @xmath13 are defined as follows : @xmath48 we consider collective operators that satisfy ccr @xmath49=i \\;,\\\\ \\displaystyle [ \\hat q_{a},\\,\\hat p_{b}]=0 \\;,\\\\ etc\\ , ... \\end{array}\\ ] ] which hold if the profiles satisfy orthonormality conditions ( to be discussed in the next paragraph ) . the fact that collective phase space operators satisfy ccr guarantees that indeed we deal with two distinct bosonic modes , so it is meaningful to treat them as subsystems and speak about entanglement or separability of their joint state and @xmath13 generate two commuting subalgebras , that in turn induce two subsystems in the hilbert space @xcite , each of which is isomorphic to the space of a one - dimensional particle .",
    "] .    completing the set @xmath50 to an orthonormal basis in @xmath51 , ( [ coll ]",
    ") can be extended to a linear canonical transformation of modes , two of which coincide with our collective ones .",
    "tracing the global ground state over all but these particular two modes gives the final state of the two subsystems .",
    "since the vacuum of a scalar quantum field is gaussian and both transformations preserve this property , the final reduced state is gaussian as well .",
    "this observation is very important as it means that the criterion is in our case necessary and sufficient ( if condition a3 is satisfied ) and indeed gives the degree of entanglement between the two bosonic modes .",
    "it is clear that the expectation values of all the possible products and combinations of the collective operators in the global vacuum coincide with their values calculated with respect to the reduced state .",
    "the idea of restricting the possible measurements to a pair of collective modes is an extension of @xcite ( where the chain of harmonic oscillators is considered ) to the framework of scalar quantum field theory ( qft ) with general profiles .",
    "our main goal is to explicitly find two profiles @xmath52 such that the effective modes are entangled .",
    "[ [ conditions - on - the - profiles . ] ] conditions on the profiles .    before proceeding to prove our main results",

    "it is useful to express them in terms of the fourier transform @xmath53 we require that the collective operators satisfy ccr .",
    "all the relations involving only collective position or only momentum operators are automatically satisfied due to .",
    "the remaining ones lead to orthonormalization of @xmath54 in @xmath55 . with @xmath56",

    "so , ( with assumption a3 ) it is only necessary that @xmath60 and @xmath61 are finite .",
    "this indeed holds , if the fourier transforms of the smearing functions decay fast enough : @xmath62 finally , we demand a1-a3 .",
    "note that a1 , a2 are satisfied for every profile , while a3 is equivalent to the additional conditions @xmath63    all correlations appearing in the criterion in terms of the fourier transforms of the profiles read ( @xmath56 ) @xmath64 we will further denote @xmath65 .",
    "this parameter , appearing in @xmath66 and @xmath67 , is a measure of the distance ( separation ) between the subsystems .",
    "[ [ large - separations - limit . ] ] large separations limit .",
    "it is natural to ask whether there exist profiles satisfying all the constraints given above and defining entangled modes for arbitrary separations . in this paragraph",
    "we will show that this is not possible . below",
    "we prove that for every pair of allowed profiles there exists a finite critical distance @xmath68 such that corresponding collective operators are separable at distances larger than the critical one .",
    "more precisely : for every pair of orthonormal functions @xmath52 , satisfying a3 and [ giving finite correlations in ] there exists @xmath69 such that the modes defined by @xmath70 are separable for every @xmath71",
    ". we will give the proof in three space dimensions but it remains valid in arbitrary finite dimensions .",
    "first , notice that the integral form of the cauchy - schwarz inequality ( i.e.  hlder s inequality ) together with condition , not only guarantees the finiteness of all the correlations but , also asserts that their integrands are functions from @xmath72 ( space of functions , which absolute value is integrable ) .",
    "in particular , it enables to prove that both @xmath73 and @xmath74 are in @xmath72 .    from riemann - lebesgue lemma @xcite ( it says that the fourier transform of an @xmath75 function vanishes at infinity )",
    "it now immediately follows that @xmath76 @xmath77 in consequence , for @xmath78 the left - hand side of the criterion reduces to the product @xmath79 .",
    "because of ccr imposed on the collective operators , the heisenberg uncertainty relation guarantees that this product is always greater or equal @xmath80 , so in the limit of infinite separation the modes become separable .",
    "however , we obtain much stronger result by utilizing eq .  .",
    "let us write the product @xmath79 as a double integral symmetrized over the integration variables @xmath81 the last inequality is a direct consequence of the normalization of the profiles [ conditions ] , the fact that @xmath82 for all @xmath83 and that the latter saturates only on the hyperplane @xmath84 , which has zero lebesgue measure .    summarizing , we have shown that @xmath85 , which is equivalent to @xmath86 this is , however , exactly the separability condition .",
    "so states that , given a pair of orthonormal functions @xmath46 , @xmath47 which satisfy and a3 , there exists @xmath69 such that once @xmath87 , the modes defined by @xmath88 , @xmath89 are separable .",
    "it is interesting , although not very relevant from the physical point of view , that this result is not restricted to functions with compact support , as this property has no specific role in the proof ( only orthonormality is needed ) . for example , it holds for any pair of orthonormal test functions ( element of schwartz space :  rapidly decreasing functions ) satisfying a3 .    [ [ measure ] ] measurement of the collective observables .    a significant difference between our and other related works lies in the treatment of the detector .",
    "we define it only in terms of the observables that it measures . in this paragraph",
    "we propose a model by which a system interacting with the field can be used to implement the desired measurements of the collective observables .",
    "we will follow the method discussed in @xcite . in order to measure each of the operators we thus need a different interaction .",
    "in general , however , to either of the effective modes @xmath90 we couple another bosonic mode  a detector . then , under the coupling of the suitable degrees of freedom of the subsystem and the detector , measurements made on the latter reveal the value of the corresponding observable .",
    "let us consider a universal situation when observable @xmath91 is measured on mode @xmath92 , with @xmath93 .",
    "the hilbert space @xmath94 of the joint system comprised of the subsystem @xmath92 ( with hilbert space denoted by @xmath95 ) and its detector ( with hilbert space @xmath96 ) is a tensor product @xmath97 .",
    "we introduce the phase space observables for the detector @xmath98 , which satisfy canonical commutation relations @xmath99=i$ ] .",
    "in other words , we consider the detector s state space to be isomorphic to the hilbert space of a one - dimensional particle .",
    "an interaction hamiltonian , which allows a measurement of the operator @xmath91 , takes the form @xmath100 where @xmath101 is a time independent coupling constant for this particular interaction . as bases of the hilbert spaces",
    "@xmath102 we take the sets of eigenvectors of @xmath103 , namely @xmath104 such that @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "( we consider here observable @xmath91 with continuous spectrum because we are primary interested in measuring the collective observables , however the framework considered below applies also to operators with discrete spectrum . )",
    "the state of the subsystem @xmath92 is mixed . in the chosen basis",
    "it can be written as @xmath107 the initial state of the detector is , in an idealized situation , a pure eigenstate @xmath108 of @xmath109 .",
    "therefore , prior to the interaction , the joint state @xmath110 of the two systems is @xmath111 if the time scale of the measurement process is much smaller then that of the free evolution of the field and the detector , the time evolution of the density matrix @xmath110 is given by the hamiltonian : @xmath112 making use of the fact that the momentum operator is a generator of spatial translations ( see e.g. @xcite ) we notice that @xmath113 so finally @xmath114 performing measurements on the detector s degrees of freedom , we can reconstruct the values of the observable @xmath91 in the state of subsystem @xmath92 given by .",
    "it is straightforward to derive that the probability amplitude for the detector to be at time @xmath115 in some eigenstate @xmath116 of @xmath109 is proportional to @xmath117 , which is in turn the probability amplitude of subsystem @xmath92 being in state @xmath118 .",
    "a more realistic treatment would involve assuming for the initial state of the detector not an eigenstate of @xmath109 but rather a superposition @xmath119 [ e.g.  for a coherent initial state @xmath120 would be a gaussian packet ] .",
    "in such a case the amplitude for the detector to be at time @xmath115 in the state @xmath116 is proportional to @xmath121 .    in the above example the considered subsystem",
    "was coupled to the detector s degree of freedom which corresponds to the operator @xmath122 .",
    "this choice is of course arbitrary , i.e.  equivalently well the other degree of freedom , corresponding to @xmath109 , may be utilized to perform the measurement . in such a case",
    "the interaction takes form @xmath123 , where @xmath124 is again a time independent coupling constant . as a basis of the hilbert space @xmath96 we take the set of eigenvectors of @xmath122 and , as the initial state of the detector",
    ", we consider the eigenstate of @xmath122 .",
    "following all the previous steps with these changes in mind , we obtain that measuring this detector s state in the momentum basis , again , enables to reconstruct the value of the observable @xmath91 on the state of subsystem @xmath92 .",
    "although we couple each mode with an ( effective ) one - dimensional particle , different degrees of freedom of the measured modes are involved in measurements of conjugate collective observables .",
    "so , in the outlined scheme the interactions are relatively simple but the detectors serve solely as devices to reconstruct the values of collective operators in the two - mode state considered . on the other hand , if the vacuum entanglement is actually transferred to the detectors ( as in @xcite ) , by the price of a very fine tuned , time dependent interaction , it is possible to detect entanglement for arbitrary separations .",
    "the result of the previous section says that no matter what are the shapes of the detection profiles , collective operators too distant from each other must be separable , but it does not give any indication about the possibility of finding entanglement by measurements in regions sufficiently close together .",
    "it is not trivial to tackle this problem directly , as the possible detection profiles form an infinite dimensional space and many of them will still define separable modes ; it is therefore instructive to study a discretized version of the system , where numerical analysis can be performed",
    ". the numerics will give important insights into the shape of the profiles that can show entanglement and , furthermore , it will give evidence of the existence of a critical distance independent of the specific profile , thus strengthening the results of sec .",

    "a one - dimensional bosonic field can be formally obtained as the continuum limit of a chain of coupled harmonic oscillators .",
    "this is especially useful for us , as the discrete system can be better analyzed ; in particular , the freedom in the choice of profiles reduces to an optimization problem of functions of a finite number of degrees of freedom .",
    "let us briefly review the relation between the harmonic chain and the continuous field ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
