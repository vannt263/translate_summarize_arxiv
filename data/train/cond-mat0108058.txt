    "over many years the study of phase transitions in fluid mixtures has become an important field because of their omnipresent occurrence in nature and more importantly because of their technological meaning in creating new materials@xcite : blending of different species can reduce cost , improve processibility , provide synergy between components and allow for recycling .",
    "sophisticated analytical techniques ",
    "e.g. , self consistent field theory@xcite or p - rism theory@xcite  exist for calculating the phase behaviour and detailed interfacial properties of polymer blends . because of the large extension of polymer chains equilibrium properties",
    "are well described ; however , the analytical description is much less satisfactory for the dynamics of multi  component systems .",
    "the transition from a completely homogeneous mixture to an equilibrated two phase system is a very long process consisting of a sequence of highly inhomogeneous states .",
    "many different methods to analyse this process have been applied including experiments , theory , and computational simulations .",
    "after quenching a polymer blend from the one phase region deep into the two phase region spinodal decomposition takes place .",
    "different time regimes are recognised during spinodal decomposition . during early stages",
    "the amplitudes of the concentration fluctuations , that are amplified , are still so small that they do not interact with each other . for later times",
    "the local composition reaches the equilibrium value of the coexisting phases , and nonlinear interactions between the fluctuation modes become more and more important . at even later stages hydrodynamics dominates the coarsening@xcite .",
    "spinodal decomposition can be approximately described through time dependent ginzburg ",
    "landau theory , also known as cahn  hilliard ",
    "cook theory@xcite .",
    "many efforts have been made to numerically calculate the time evolution of a mixture in the framework of this theory@xcite .",
    "these calculations are appropriate to give a first insight into how phase separation takes place , but are far from describing the system quantitatively well .",
    "even though binary polymer blends are an ideal testing bed for these approaches , earlier monte carlo simulations@xcite found rather pronounced deviations from their predictions . to find a quantitatively better description ,",
    "it is necessary to go beyond ginzburg ",
    "landau theory .",
    "self consistent field theory@xcite ( scft ) has proven to be one of the most successful descriptions of equilibrium properties of polymer mixtures on a mean field level .",
    "the idea to use scft to develop a dynamical mean field theory is not new@xcite , but , although scft describes equilibrium properties well , usually the influence of the single chain dynamics is neglected due to computational expenses , again leading to a more qualitative than quantitative description of the phase separation . in most calculations",
    "a simple constant onsager coefficient is used which would be appropriate if the movement of the polymers were comparable to the movement of point particles . remembering the connectivity of polymers it is not likely that this local coupling is sufficient to lead to a quantitatively correct description of the dynamics and other nonlocal onsager coefficients have been proposed@xcite .    in this study",
    "we are interested in the early stages of spinodal decomposition in an incompressible symmetric binary polymer mixture after a quench from the one phase region to the two phase region paying special attention to the differences in the collective dynamics when the chains obey local and rouse dynamics .",
    "we therefore employ two dynamical versions of self consistent field theory for polymer mixtures . the first method , referred to as dynamic self consistent field theory@xcite ( dscft ) , uses the free energy functional of the scft for an incompressible mixture in terms of the local composition .",
    "this free energy functional leads to a kinetic equation for the time dependent local composition which is integrated numerically .",
    "this method has been applied for studying the ordering kinetics in block copolymer and surfactant systems@xcite .",
    "we use both a local and a nonlocal onsager transport coefficient , as is expected for polymers obeying rouse dynamics .",
    "the underlying idea of the second method is to express the free energy of the investigated system only in terms of the effective external fields , which are thermodynamically conjugated to the composition .",
    "this description leads to an equation of motion for the effective external fields , which is integrated in time . following maurits _",
    "et al._@xcite who derived a similar equation of motion neglecting random fluctuations we refer to this method as the external potential dynamics ( epd ) , which has been shown to automatically incorporate rouse dynamics .",
    "the aim of our study is to explore both methods and to investigate the role of the onsager coefficient . to decide whether our results resemble any ` real ' dynamics a comparison with results obtained through other methods is preferable",
    "although many experiments have analysed spinodal decomposition in binary polymer mixtures only few@xcite have looked at early stages of demixing and the influence of the onsager coefficient .",
    "another difficulty in comparing experimental results with our calculations lies in the fact that actual demixing is influenced by many factors , for example , preparation of the probe , polydispersity , or strong dynamic asymmetries due to different glass transition temperatures of the two species@xcite .",
    "therefore a quantitative mapping between theory and experimental systems is difficult . to gain a quantitative insight",
    "we compare our mean field calculations with results obtained through monte carlo simulations .",
    "no parameters have to be adjusted for this comparison . in the simulations we employ the bond fluctuation model@xcite which is well established for studying properties of polymer melts .",
    "it has been shown that the equilibrium properties of a polymer mixture as given by the self consistent field theory are almost quantitatively reproduced through monte carlo simulations using the bond fluctuation model@xcite .",
    "our paper is organised in the following way . in section",
    "[ sec : scft ] we introduce the self consistent field theory for a binary polymer mixture , explaining how equilibrium properties can be derived with this method .",
    "then we introduce general aspects of the dynamics in a polymer mixture and show how they can be incorporated in the scft leading to dynamic self consistent field theory .",
    "the following section presents another approach to including dynamics in scft regarding the effective external fields as the time dependent variable .",
    "implications regarding density fluctuations in this description are discussed in detail .",
    "section [ sec : mc ] serves as a brief introduction to the performed monte carlo simulations and explains how a direct comparison with scft calculations is possible . in section [ sec : results ] results of our calculations and simulations are presented first showing the difference between the use of local and nonlocal coupling , then comparing the mean field results with the simulations and finally analysing the influence of random fluctuations .",
    "the paper finishes with a summary .",
    "we consider an incompressible mixture of a and b polymers consisting of @xmath0 polymers in a volume @xmath1 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "there are @xmath2 polymers of kind a in the system , for b polymers respectively @xmath3 . in scft@xcite polymers",
    "are modelled as gaussian chains with the end  to ",
    "end distance @xmath4 .",
    "in addition we choose the a and b polymers to both have the same number of monomers @xmath5 and to be of the same architecture .",
    "the overall particle density in the system is denoted as @xmath6 .",

    "this is incorporated effectively via the incompressibility constraint which is expressed through the @xmath16function in eq.([eq : part_bulk])@xcite .",

    "the functional integral in eq.([eq : part_new ] ) also can not be calculated explicitly .",
    "therefore we employ a saddle point approximation .",
    "this means that only the largest contribution to the integrand is considered and the integration does not have to be carried out .",
    "the saddle point approximation of eq.([eq : part_new ] ) is equivalent to the minimisation of the free energy ( [ eq : free_en ] ) with respect to the auxiliary variables .",

    "eqs.([eq : saddle_phi_a ] ) and ( [ eq : saddle_phi_b ] ) make clear that in equilibrium the average microscopic density @xmath29 actually equals the thermal average monomer density of a single a chain in an external field @xmath30 . in other words after starting with a description where we would have to take all possible interactions of every polymer chain into account , see eq.([eq : part_bulk ] ) , we have now found a mean field description of the system in which it is sufficient to look at a single chain in an effective external field .    to calculate the monomer densities it is useful to define the end segment distribution @xmath31 , which gives the probability to find the end of a chain with length @xmath32 at position @xmath33 when exposed to a field @xmath30 : @xmath34{\\mathcal{p}}_a[{\\mathbf{r}}(t ) ] \\delta({\\mathbf{r}}(t)-{\\mathbf{r}})\\exp\\left[-\\int^t_0 d\\tau w_a({\\mathbf{r}}(\\tau))\\right ] , \\label{eq : end_seg_dis}\\ ] ] for this end segment distribution the following diffusion equation holds@xcite @xmath35 with the boundary condition @xmath36 .",
    "after finding a solution to this equation the monomer density is immediately given through the following expression : @xmath37 the single chain partition function can be calculated with : @xmath38 after having presented all necessary equations to calculate equilibrium properties of polymer mixtures , we are now interested in using this description for calculating the dynamics in a polymer mixture .",
    "two ways to achieve this are introduced in the following sections .      because of the fact that the concentrations of the polymers are conserved the continuity equation is valid : @xmath39 @xmath40 denoting the current density of the monomers at position @xmath33 at time @xmath32 .",
    "one now assumes@xcite a linear relation between the current density and the gradient of the exchange potential @xmath41 ( note there is only one independent chemical potential in the system because of the incompressibility constraint ) @xmath42 with the kinetic coefficient @xmath43 describing the connection between the force acting on the monomers through the gradient of the chemical potential at position @xmath44 and the resulting current density at position @xmath33 .",
    "this describes a purely relaxational dynamics , effects due to hydrodynamic flow are not captured .",
    "the onsager coefficient @xmath45 can be modelled in different ways : the simplest approach would be local coupling which results in the onsager coefficient being proportional to the local density .",
    "bearing in mind that polymers have a certain extension it is clear that nonlocal coupling should lead to a better description , although local coupling is often used in calculations of dynamic models based on ginzburg  landau type energy functionals for simplicity reasons@xcite . in the rouse model forces acting on a monomer caused by the other monomers",
    "are also taken into account@xcite .",
    "this leads to a kinetic factor that is proportional to the pair ",
    "correlation function@xcite .",
    "these two approaches lead to the following onsager coefficients : @xmath46 @xmath47 denoting the single chain diffusion constant and @xmath48 the pair  correlation function .",
    "the rouse onsager coefficient written in eq .",
    "is only approximately valid , when the pair ",
    "correlation function is the same for both polymer species .",
    "a more general expression is found in reference@xcite .",
    "another model for nonlocal coupling is the reptation model@xcite which is appropriate for polymer melts with very long chains , i.e.  very entangled chains .",
    "hereby the idea is that a polymer chain is constrained by the other polymers and is forced to move along the polymer tube axis .",
    "this dynamics is expected@xcite to also lead to an onsager coefficient that is proportional to the pair  correlation function .",
    "therefore the influence of single chain rouse and reptation dynamics on the collective dynamics of the system is qualitatively comparable .",
    "reptation shall not be regarded in the further study .",
    "eqs.([eq : cont_eq ] ) and lead to the following diffusion equation the last term representing noise that obeys the fluctuation  dissipation theorem .",
    "@xmath49 after the fourier transformation this diffusion equation has a simple form : @xmath50    these diffusion equations implicitly assume that the relaxation time of the chain conformations is smaller than the time scale on which composition fluctuations evolve .",
    "the chain conformations are expected to be ` in equilibrium ' with respect to the instantaneous spatially varying composition .    to use the introduced diffusion equation ( [ eq : diff_eq ] ) in the frame of scft , let us return to the general expression ( [ eq : part_new ] ) that describes the canonical partition function depending upon the variables @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 that are independent of each other .",
    "if we now employ a saddle point approximation in the variables @xmath19 and @xmath20 we find eqs.([eq : saddle_phi_a ] ) and ( [ eq : saddle_phi_b ] ) , that describe a unique relation between the fields @xmath30 , @xmath51 and the densities @xmath52 , @xmath53 .",
    "this means we can calculate the densities explicitely with eqs.([eq : diff_eq_end ] ) , ( [ eq : dens_calc ] ) , and ( [ eq : si_ch_part_calc ] ) , if the fields @xmath30 and @xmath51 are known .",

    "the following set of orthonormal functions is used in all our scft calculations : @xmath59    we have now found all necessary equations to numerically calculate the time evolution of the densities in a binary polymer mixture , leading us the following procedure we refer to as the dynamic self consistent field theory ( dscft ) method : first we have a given density profile at time @xmath60 . as mentioned before eqs.([eq : diff_eq_end ] ) , ( [ eq : dens_calc ] ) and ( [ eq : si_ch_part_calc ] ) give us the possibility to explicitly calculate the single chain densities for known external fields . unfortunately the inversion is needed because we have given densities and have to find the matching external fields .",
    "this leads to a set of nonlinear equations , that is numerically solved through the newton ",
    "broyden method@xcite .",
    "after the external fields , that ` create ' the given density profile , have been found the exchange potential @xmath61 is calculated via eq.([eq : chem_pot ] ) and then inserted into the diffusion equation ( [ eq : diff_eq_q ] )",
    ". the diffusion equation is subsequently integrated using a simplified runge ",
    "kutta method .",
    "this leads to a new given density after a discrete time step and the whole procedure starts anew .",
    "apart from regarding local dynamics in our dscft calculations it is favourable to consider nonlocal coupling because this leads to a better description of the dynamics in a polymer mixture .",
    "however in dscft the difficulty in using rouse dynamics lies in the computational expense of calculating the pair ",
    "correlation function for each time step . as an approximation during early stages of demixing the pair ",
    "correlation function of a homogeneous melt , as it is given through the random phase approximation ( rpa)@xcite , is used leading to the following onsager coefficient : @xmath62 @xmath63 is defined as @xmath64 with @xmath4 denoting the end  to ",
    "end distance of a polymer .      in the previously introduced dscft method we needed a way to reduce the number of independent variables in the partition function . through the saddle point approximation in the fields we obtained a free energy functional in terms of the densities .",

    "for which @xmath117 exceeds the critical value @xmath159@xcite only slightly , one has @xmath160@xcite , and then the theory would yield a linear cahn plot , also consistent with corresponding observations@xcite .",
    "the latter case is less interesting , however , because then the polymer mixture is to a large extent equivalent in behaviour to a fluid mixture of small molecules , and there is no longer an effect of internal rouse relaxation modes on the phase separation dynamics in this limit .",
    "if we now compare our results for larger wave vectors we see big discrepancies independent of the chosen dynamics in scft : at @xmath135 the structure factor is independent of time in the early stages of the scft calculations , i.e.  structure factors at different times exhibit a common crossing point at @xmath135 , see the inset graphs of fig.[fig : glostr_scf_mc ] .",
    "no such intersection occurs in the simulation data .",
    "mean field theory damps the density modes with @xmath142 while monte carlo simulations lead to a relaxation rate fluctuating around zero .",
    "this behaviour is also seen in the global structure factor , see fig.[fig : glostr_scf_mc ] : the right side of the scft peak decays fast , while the monte carlo peak is much broader with a slower decay .",
    "both the earlier change of the exponential behaviour and the form of the relaxation rate for larger wave vectors are the result of random fluctuations .",
    "as was expected , the influence of fluctuations during the very early stages of spinodal decomposition on the growth of the density modes is rather small , but they are crucial for smaller wave lengths and determine the change in the exponential behaviour , because random fluctuations cause some modes to reach an amplitude where the non  linear regime sets in early .",
    "the diffusion equations we have used so far are completely deterministic , but obviously in all dynamic processes random statistical fluctuations are present . to regard these fluctuations we have to add a random force @xmath102 to our diffusion equations ( [ eq : diff_eq ] ) and ( [ eq : diff_eq_epd ] ) that is linked to the onsager coefficient through the fluctuation ",
    "dissipation theorem : @xmath161 or fourier transformed : @xmath162 in our calculations the diffusion equation is integrated through discrete time intervals @xmath163 that are determined through the runge ",
    "kutta scheme . in dscft , for example",
    ", we use the langevin equation : @xmath164 with @xmath165 expressing random fluctuations that obey the fluctuation dissipation theorem@xcite : @xmath166 @xmath167 is a random number with the properties @xmath168 , @xmath169 .    the analogue @xmath165 is used to perform epd calculations with fluctuations .",
    "the difficulty in this case is to interpret the resulting fluctuations of the external field @xmath170 in terms of the density @xmath171 .",
    "as we have seen in section [ sec : epd ] the field and the density fluctuations are linked to each other through equations and .    to ensure that the way the fluctuations are included is correct and the validity of these eqs . and is given , we consider a homogeneous , @xmath172 , one dimensional system with length @xmath173 using both dscft and epd . from the dscft calculations we derive @xmath174 for each wave vector while the epd method leads to @xmath175 . in both cases we averaged over 10000 snapshots of the density or the field made during their time evolution . in fig.[fig",
    ": phi - w_rpa ] @xmath174 and @xmath175 are plotted versus @xmath134 .",
    "the solid line is the expected result from rpa . for larger values of @xmath134",
    "we find good agreement , but the amount of used configurations was not enough to find reliable results for smaller values of @xmath134 because the correlation times are much longer due to the diffusive dynamics .",
    "if we plot @xmath174 versus @xmath175 , as is done in fig.[fig : epd_dscft_fluct ] , we find good agreement of our data with the expected linear behaviour .    after having proven that the above treatment of random fluctuations leads to the expected behaviour we focus on the influence of fluctuations on spinodal decomposition .",
    "monte carlo results show that the exponential behaviour changes earlier than in scft calculations without fluctuations resulting in a reduced relaxation rate .",
    "the relaxation rates for different time intervals obtained through the monte carlo simulations and the epd method are presented in fig.[fig : relaxationsrate_dw_dt_fluct ] .",
    "the epd results were obtained by averaging the time evolution of the fields of 64 two dimensional configurations . for earlier time",
    "intervals the relaxation rate is quantitatively very similar to the rate without fluctuations in the region below @xmath135 . for later times",
    "however when calculations without fluctuations still show the same exponential behaviour the relaxation rate is reduced as is also seen in the monte carlo simulations . in the range above @xmath135 the modes of the fields or densities",
    "do not follow an exponential behaviour but fluctuate around zero .",
    "consequently the relaxation rate is not well defined in this region leading to strong fluctuations of the relaxation rate in fig.[fig : relaxationsrate_dw_dt_fluct ] .",
    "for very early times when the density modes are still of the order of the fluctuations of the homogeneous system it is also not possible to see an exponential behaviour because the density changes caused through random fluctuations conceal the growth of the modes during very early spinodal decomposition .",
    "in this study we analysed the influence of single chain dynamics on the collective diffusion during early stages of spinodal decomposition in a symmetric binary polymer blend .",
    "we used the scft for polymer mixtures to explore two versions of dynamical mean field theory .",
    "the single chain dynamics enters these descriptions through an onsager coefficient .",
    "the first method we call dscft propagates the densities in time and gives us the possibility to model both local dynamics and approximately the nonlocal dynamics we expect for the rouse model .",
    "in dscft the correct treatment of rouse dynamics would involve the calculation of the pair ",
    "correlation function at every time step , which is a computationally rather expensive task . on the other hand during early stages of demixing the mixture is only weakly inhomogeneous so that the use of the pair ",
    "correlation function of a homogeneous mixture , which is analytically known , serves as a sufficient approximation . in the second method",
    "the instantaneous configuration is not described by the densities but by the effective external field ( epd ) .",
    "we find a langevin equation for the external field which using ` local ' kinetics in the fields is found to describe a polymer mixture with rouse dynamics .",
    "apart from ` automatically ' including rouse dynamics this epd method has the big advantage of being up to an order of magnitude computationally faster than the dscft method .    first numerical calculations with these methods for a quench from the one phase , @xmath129 , to the two phase , @xmath130 , region neglecting random fluctuations show a clear exponential behaviour of the density modes , as was expected for a mean field description",
    ". the relaxation rate of the density mode is strongly influenced by the choice of the onsager coefficient : in the growth region rouse dynamics reduces the relaxation rate compared to local dynamics and the position of the maximum growth rate is shifted to smaller values of @xmath134 . for @xmath142 however rouse dynamics causes the modes to be damped less quickly .",
    "we also find good agreement for early stages between the dscft method using the pair ",
    "correlation function for the homogeneous system and the epd method .    to quantitatively test these mean field predictions",
    "we compare them with results obtained through monte carlo simulations employing the bond fluctuation model .",
    "the chains used in these simulations are expected to show rouse behaviour because of the chosen chain length @xmath114 .",
    "the comparison is possible without any adjustable parameter .",
    "we compare the global structure factor , which is the experimentally accessible quantity , and the relaxation rates .",
    "local dynamics in dscft overestimates the growth of the global structure factor by far , but the agreement is better for rouse dynamics especially for earlier times . neglecting random fluctuations in our mean field calculations proves to be justified for wave vectors with positive relaxation rates and earlier times , but should be included to investigate later times .",
    "fluctuations can easily be included in dscft and epd .",
    "the difficulty in the epd method is the fact that the field fluctuations have to be interpreted in terms of the physical density fluctuations .",
    "we can find a relation between the field and the density fluctuations .",
    "epd calculations with fluctuations lead to an earlier change in the exponential behaviour of the density modes as was also the case for the monte carlo simulations .",
    "the missing dampening of the modes with @xmath142 as is found in the simulations is also reproduced .",
    "we have seen that the single chain dynamics has a pronounced influence on the collective dynamics of a polymer mixture . comparing quantitatively monte carlo simulations and dynamical mean field theory we have validated the mean field calculations .",
    "note , however , that we have considered a deep quench far below the critical point ; for shallow quenches close to the critical point mean field theories are not expected to be accurate .",
    "the later stages of spinodal decomposition are not accessible with either method . during later times",
    "hydrodynamical interactions become important .",
    "lattice model monte carlo simulations lack a hydrodynamical mechanism . in dynamical mean field calculations hydrodynamic coupling",
    "can be included@xcite , and , hence , they can be extended beyond the validity of the lattice model .",

    "generous access to computers at the nic jlich and the hlr stuttgart are gratefully acknowledged .",
    "as mentioned before it is possible to show that the epd method using local coupling is a good approximation for reproducing rouse dynamics of the physical densities .",

    "this means we can choose with which of the two variable sets we would like to calculate . on the other hand the pair ",
