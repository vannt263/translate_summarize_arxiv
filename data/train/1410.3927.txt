    "keplerian disks are ubiquitous around t - tauri ( class ii ) sources ( @xmath10 , simon et al . 2000 ) , and are considered to be the nurseries of planetary systems .",
    "around younger protostellar ( class 0i ) sources there are @xmath3200010000 au scale protostellar envelopes that often show rotating and infalling gas motions @xcite .",
    "recent high - resolution interferometric observations in ( sub)millimeter molecular lines have found keplerian disks around protostellar sources @xcite .",
    "the masses ( @xmath30.010.03 @xmath7 ) and radii ( @xmath380300 au ) of these keplerian disks around protostars are comparable to those of circumstellar disks around t - tauri stars @xcite .",
    "these results show that formation of keplerian disks proceeds in the innermost parts of the infalling envelopes .",
    "it remains controversial as to how keplerian disks form out of the infalling envelopes around protostars .",
    "mellon & li ( 2008 ; 2009 ) , and li et al . (",

    "( 2014 ) successfully produced rotationally supported disks , with their masses comparable to the observed results .",
    "their argument is that the ohmic dissipation and the dispersal of the surrounding infalling envelope that anchors the magnetic field significantly reduce the effect of the magnetic field on the disk formation .    to put stringent observational constraints on the theories of disk formation , direct imaging of the transition from infalling envelopes to keplerian disks , and studies of evolutions of keplerian disks embedded in infalling envelopes , are crucial .",
    "takakuwa et al .",
    "( 2013 ) have found infalling gas outside of the keplerian disk around l1551 ne , a class i protobinary located @xmath32@xmath115 north - east of l1551 irs 5 , and revealed that the angular momentum of the infalling gas is much smaller than that of the keplerian disk .",
    "furthermore , the infalling velocity onto the central keplerian disk is much smaller than the free - fall velocity toward the central stellar mass of 0.8 @xmath12 as derived from the keplerian rotation .",
    "these results suggest a reduced infalling velocity and possible magnetic braking which decreases the rotational angular momentum of the infalling material . a slower infalling velocity than the free - fall velocity has also been identified in the envelope surrounding a keplerian disk around a class 0/i protostar l1527 irs @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "yen et al . ( 2014 ) found parabolic free - falling flows where the rotational angular momentum is conserved enroute to the central keplerian disk around l1489 irs .",
    "these observational reports are so far the only examples of the transition from the infalling envelopes to the keplerian disks .",
    "hence , a general picture of the transition , and the evolutionary sequence of keplerian disks embedded in infalling envelopes , are not yet established .    in order to further study the formation mechanism of keplerian disks , we have performed submillimeter array ( sma ) observations of l1551 irs 5 , one of the best - studied class i protostars , in the submillimeter continuum and cs ( @xmath0=76 ) emission .",

    "previous interferometric observations of l1551 irs 5 in millimeter molecular lines have found a @xmath32500 au - scale rotating and infalling envelope surrounding the protobinary @xcite . the rotational motion in the envelope shows a radial dependence of @xmath14 at a radii of @xmath3300  1000 au ,",

    "for radii at @xmath15300 au , higher - velocity ( @xmath16 km s@xmath6 ) features are present , which indicates that the central mass should be as high as 0.5 @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "our previous sma observations of l1551 irs 5 in cs ( 76 ) found rotation - dominant gas motion in the inner @xmath3400 au scale of the protostellar envelope , suggesting the presence of a keplerian disk @xcite .",
    "however , the lower angular resolution in the sma early science study ( @xmath332@xmath420 ) prevented us from unambiguously identifying the keplerian disk .",

    "the raw visibility data were calibrated and flagged with mir , which is an idl - based data reduction package @xcite .",
    "all the chunks at both sidebands except for those assigned for the strong molecular lines were combined to make a single continuum channel , providing the total continuum bandwidth 3.444 ghz in the subcompact observation and 6.560 ghz in the extended observations .",
    "both the continuum channels taken in the subcompact and extended observations were co - added , and the continuum image was generated with uniform weighting of the measured visibilities . in the present paper , we will focus on the results of the continuum emission ( hereafter 343 ghz continuum emission ) and the cs ( 76 ) line .",

    "the high - velocity cs ( 76 ) emission immediately surrounding l1551 irs 5 exhibits a clear velocity gradient along the northwest ( red )  southeast ( blue ) direction .",
    "since the direction of the velocity gradient is parallel to the major axis of the dust - continuum emission and the high - velocity cs emission traces the overall structure of the dust - continuum emission , a natural interpretation of the high - velocity cs emission is a rotating circumstellar disk .",
    "recent interferometric observations of protostellar sources have been successfully modeling the circumstellar disks as geometrically - thin keplerian disks @xcite .",

    "<S> we present combined submillimeter array ( sma ) + atacama submillimeter telescope experiment ( aste ) images of the class i protobinary l1551 irs 5 in the cs ( @xmath0 = 76 ) line , the submillimeter images of l1551 irs 5 with the most complete spatial sampling ever achieved ( @xmath1  @xmath2 ) . the sma image of l1551 irs 5 in the 343 ghz dust - continuum emission is also presented , which shows an elongated feature along the northwest to southeast direction ( @xmath3160 au @xmath4 80 au ) , perpendicular to the associated radio jets . </S>",
    "<S> the combined sma+aste images show that the high - velocity ( @xmath51.5 km s@xmath6 ) cs emission traces the structure of the dust component and shows a velocity gradient along the major axis , which is reproduced by a geometrically - thin keplerian - disk model with a central stellar mass of @xmath30.5 @xmath7 . the low - velocity ( @xmath81.3 km s@xmath6 ) cs emission shows an extended ( @xmath31000 au ) feature that exhibits slight south ( blueshifted ) to north ( redshifted ) emission offsets , which is modeled with a rotating and infalling envelope with a conserved angular momentum . </S>",
    "<S> the rotational motion of the envelope connects smoothly to the inner keplerian rotation at a radius of @xmath364 au . </S>",
    "<S> the infalling velocity of the envelope is @xmath3three times lower than the free - fall velocity toward the central stellar mass of 0.5 @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> these results demonstrate transition from the infalling envelope to the keplerian disk , consistent with the latest theoretical studies of disk formation . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that sizable ( @xmath950200 au ) keplerian disks are already formed when the protostars are still deeply embedded in the envelopes .    </S>",
