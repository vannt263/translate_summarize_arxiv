    "the idea that cosmic strings may have been a source of inhomogeneities in the universe has been around for some time ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite for an overview ) .",
    "even though it now seems that inflation is the primary source of the inhomogeneities which lead to anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , the idea has persisted .",
    "the main reason for this is that the amplitude of fluctuations produced by strings formed close to a grand unified theory ( gut ) phase transition ( @xmath13 ) is of the order of observed density inhomogeneities on large scales , making it an attractive probe of physics at energies way above that possible in terrestrial accelerators .",
    "it may seem very non - minimal to have two mechanisms creating inhomogeneities and contrary to the common - sense approach advocated by occam s razor . however , there are at least two classes of inflation models , linked to popular ideas in fundamental physics , where strings can be formed and the two sets of perturbations have similar amplitudes .",
    "one is based on supersymmetric hybrid inflation  @xcite and the other is brane inflation  @xcite . in both cases",
    "cosmic strings can be formed during the phase transition at the end of inflation  @xcite .",
    "it was shown in ref.@xcite that this can happen in a large number of symmetry breaking schemes and it is possible that semi - local strings could form  @xcite in situations where strings are not forced to exist on topological grounds .    one can not rule out strings using observations per se , rather one can only constrain the tension ( or the mass per unit length ) of the strings , and hence the energy scale at which the strings are formed .",
    "the tension is usually quantified in terms of the dimensionless ratio @xmath3 .",
    "this can be done in many different ways . in this paper",
    "we will focus on two : the anisotropies , created by the kaiser - stebbins effect  @xcite and related pre - recombination processes in the cmb ; and the stochastic background of gravitational waves created by the decay of string loops  @xcite .",
    "there are serious difficulties in setting such limits due to the dynamic range involved in modeling the evolution of a cosmic string network over cosmological scales .",
    "this has led to a number of different constraints being published in the literature which are often contradictory  these will be reviewed in the subsequent sections .",
    "the objective of the present paper is two - fold . for both types of observations we will review the important physics and attempt to delineate the key uncertainties .",
    "we then present what we believe are the most reliable constraints based on the present knowledge . in the case of the cmb observations we will present two different constraints , based on different assumptions about the evolution of the string network .",
    "we note that the constraints presented here will apply only directly to strings where the intercommutation probability , @xmath14 , is unity ; that is , they can only be directly applied to normal field theoretic strings and not necessarily to cosmic superstrings  @xcite .",
    "the key to predicting the observed cmb anisotropies from strings is a detailed understanding of the evolution of a cosmic string network .",
    "the main idea is that , after formation , the network evolves toward a self - similar scaling regime , whereby the average properties of the network remain approximately constant as a function of time . in the standard scenario",
    "this is achieved by the production of loops and their subsequent decay into radiation , usually assumed to be gravitational .",
    "the scaling assumption is not at issue .",
    "it has been observed in just about every simulation that has ever been done .",
    "however , the precise characteristics of the scaling regime are of critical importance for predicting the cmb anisotropy spectrum .",
    "the problem is that each simulation technique needs to make assumptions in order to achieve sufficient dynamical range .",
    "the two most popular approaches are : ( a ) to solve the nambu equations of motion for a string in an expanding universe and include the effects of reconnection by hand ; and ( b ) to solve the equations of motion for the abelian - higgs ( ah ) model . in method",
    "a one ignores the effects of radiation backreaction , which is likely to be important in setting the size of loops which the string network creates , making the observed scaling dependent on the removal of sufficiently small loops from the simulation .",
    "radiation into propagating modes of the field is included in method b , but one is necessarily forced to consider simulation box sizes which are only @xmath15 times greater than the core string width , thereby reducing the dynamical range .",
    "this could also lead to the radiation being stronger in the simulation than in realistic string networks since the typical radius of curvature is large relative to the core width .",
    "moreover one has to accept contortions involving fixing , or reducing the rate of growth of , the core width in comoving units in order to perform simulations in an expanding universe .",
    "dynamical range is less of a problem in method a , since the core width is zero and the strings are represented as 1d objects , as opposed to the 3d box required for field theory simulations , thereby allowing much larger grid sizes .",
    "having said that no simulation can achieve the dynamical range required to model the real universe !    simulations using method a have been used to derive the key statistical parameters of the string network which appear to be different in the radiation and matter eras  @xcite .",
    "it is found that the correlation length @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the particle horizon distance , differs substantially between the radiation and matter eras , with @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) , corresponding to a significantly lower string density ( @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the string tension - whose value is the main subject of the paper ) in the matter era .",
    "there is substantial small - scale structure on the long string network .",
    "this can be quantified in terms of a renormalized string tension  @xcite , @xmath22 , and it is found that @xmath23 and @xmath24 . on the other hand , the rms velocity of the string segments only varies very slightly between the different eras , with @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "it has been shown that a velocity dependent one - scale model can be used to describe the evolution between the radiation and matter eras , and the extrapolation into the cosmological constant dominated era .",
    "this typically involves a long transient with the string density only achieving its matter era value around @xmath27 .",
    "contrasting results are found using method b  @xcite .",
    "typically very small loops are created from the fragmentation of horizon scale loops and most of the energy loss , required in order to maintain scaling , is achieved by radiation of the massive modes associated with the ah model . @xmath28 and @xmath29  @xcite",
    "are computed from the simulations , with little difference observed between simulations performed in the radiation and matter eras .",
    "the nature of the observed small - scale structure on the strings is different but is compatible with @xmath30 .",
    "we note that ringeval _",
    "et al _  @xcite find that @xmath31 and @xmath32 using nambu simulations which corresponds to a change in density between the radiation and matter densities of @xmath33 as opposed to @xmath34 which would be the case if @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "this will lead to results more similar to those which come from the ah model .",
    "in addition an attempt to compute the spectrum directly from nambu simulations has recently being made  @xcite .    in both cases one can in principal compute the unequal - time correlator ( uetc ) , @xmath37 , of the string network stress - energy tensor , @xmath38 , from the simulation . using the stiff source approximation , one",
    "can then compute the cmb anisotropies by either decomposing the uetc in eigenmodes  @xcite , or averaging realizations with the correct statistical properties .",
    "an alternative approach is to model the uetc using what has become known at the unconnected segment model ( usm ) .",
    "this models the string network as an ensemble of string segments of length @xmath39 with an rms velocity @xmath40 .",
    "this idea  @xcite was first used in the context of the cmb in refs .",
    "@xcite and was later adapted to include the matter - radiation transition  @xcite and the effects of small - scale structure on the network via the ` wiggliness ' parameter , @xmath41  @xcite .",
    "the weakness of this approach is that there is some freedom due to the parameters of the model , @xmath42 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , which could be functions of time , but these can be and have been computed from simulations .",
    "the present work uses the usm and the code cmbact  @xcite which was also used in refs .",
    "the spectrum computed using the usm and the parameters from the nambu simulations ( model a ) are presented in the left hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] , along with the spectrum computed from the ah model simulations  @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the two spectra are very different , with model a having a fairly sharp peak at around @xmath43 , whereas the ah spectrum has a lower and broader peak , and falls off very sharply at high @xmath44 .",
    "it is not necessary for the string spectrum to be known to the level of precision of the inflationary component , since it is constrained to be @xmath45 of the total anisotropy .",
    "however , the discrepancy illustrated here is larger than is acceptable and it leads to important quantitative differences when each of the spectra are applied to the data .",
    "the spectrum computed using the usm is not unique , being a function of the parameters , and in particular the first cmb spectrum computed using it  @xcite looks very similar to that computed from the abelian - higgs simulations .",
    "this first spectrum just used a single , constant value for @xmath42 and @xmath40 , and ignored the effects of the matter - radiation transition and small - scale structure , that is , it had @xmath46 .",
    "it seems plausible that it might be possible to compute an ah ` mimic ' model using the usm ( model b ) . in order to investigate this we ran a suite of simulations of the usm with 3 parameters , @xmath42 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , all assumed to be constant with time , and then minimized the residuals to the true ah spectrum taking into account the decomposition into the scalar , vector and tensor ( svt ) modes , all of which are present in cosmic string spectra .",
    "we found that @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 gave the best fit .",
    "these are quite close to the values computed from the ah model simulations discussed earlier .",
    "the spectrum created using model b is compared to that from the ah model simulations in the right hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] .",
    "we see that there is remarkably good agreement between the spectra and that the values of @xmath3 required to achieve the observed level of fluctuations are very similar .",
    "this suggests that the discrepancy in the spectra between the usm used to describe the nambu simulations and that from the ah model simulations is mainly due to the computed correlation properties , and the differences in the simulation techniques , not the subsequent methods used to infer the cmb spectrum .",
    "we have also computed the cdm power spectrum for both string models , but these are subdominant compared to the inflationary component when normalized to the observed large angle cmb amplitude  @xcite . since the string contribution is limited to @xmath45 of the total anisotropy , the cdm power spectrum from strings is completely subdominant .",
    "it is worth investigating what are the primary reasons for the differences between the nambu and ah spectra . in fig .",
    "[ fig : morph ] we have first removed the matter - radiation transition , making the spectrum just a function of single values of @xmath42 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "we have then varied each of the three parameters relative to the ah mimic model .",
    "it is clear that the most significant reason for the discrepancy is the effect of the matter - radiation transition , which is present in the nambu simulations but not observed in the ah simulations .",
    "the other important effect comes from the correlation length @xmath42 , whereas the parameters @xmath40 and @xmath41 appear to have little effect on the overall spectrum .",
    "the small - scale structure parameter , @xmath41 , does play an important role in regulating the relative contribution of the scalar , vector and tensor components ; values of @xmath50 have an enhanced scalar component relative to the vector component .",
    "the tensor component is low in all cases .    in the next section , where we describe constraints on @xmath3 , we will present results for the two spectra ( model a and b )  the qualitative conclusions are similar , but there are important quantitative differences , particularly in the upper limit on @xmath3 .",
    "it is instructive to try understand why there is such a significant discrepancy in the properties derived from the 2 different simulation methods which leads to these differences .",
    "the most worrying aspect of the ah simulations is their size relative to the core width .",
    "it could be that the absence of small - scale structure is related to the artificially strong massive radiation seen in the simulations .",
    "it is plausible that this could smooth out the small - scale structure on the long strings and remove the need for loop formation .",
    "the fact that the string width is kept constant in comoving coordinates , which makes it artificially large relative to the horizon , may be responsible for there being little difference between the scaling behaviours in the radiation and matter eras .",
    "the achilles heel of the nambu simulations is the absence of radiation which could over - produce small - scale structure .",
    "clearly more work needs to be done to resolve these discrepancies , but it is reassuring that both models can be represented with the necessary level of accuracy using the usm . an alternative to presenting results for",
    "the two separate models would be to allow @xmath42 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 to vary within the usm and marginalized over them as nuisance parameters .    .",
    "[ tab : sdss ] cmb + sdss constraints on string models using @xmath51 as the parameter .",
    "models denoted by s use strings and ns indicates that we have not used strings in the mcmc , while hz denotes a harrison - zeldovich spectrum ( i.e. @xmath52 ) .",
    "nambu refers to the usm spectrum using the parameters derived from the nambu simulations and ah to that of the ah mimic model .",
    "upper limits on @xmath3 and @xmath53 are @xmath54 .",
    "the @xmath55 values of the models can be computed from @xmath56 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      as a by - product of our analysis , we find there is strong evidence that @xmath57 within the 6 parameter family of @xmath58cdm models . with no strings , including the bbn prior increases the @xmath59 between hz and variable @xmath4 from @xmath60 to @xmath61 ( as noted above , a similar @xmath59 for bbn is also true with strings ) .",
    "one can further quantify this significance by computing the bayesian evidence using the savage - dickey method ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . to do this",
    ", we assume gaussian prior information on @xmath4 with mean 1 and standard deviation 0.2 .",
    "the resulting bayes factor between hz and variable @xmath4 models is @xmath62 , corresponding to an odds ratio of @xmath7 , which provides `` moderate - to - strong '' evidence that @xmath57 .",
    "it is expected that the cosmic string network will emit gravitational waves , the dominant contribution coming from loop decay   coming from the possible overproduction of high energy cosmic rays .",
    "] , leading to a stochastic background which can be constrained by pulsar timing and also recent measurements made by ligo  @xcite . at this stage",
    "those from pulsar timing are the strongest , and therefore we shall concentrate on them .",
    "just as with the limits from the cmb anisotropy there are a number of constraints available in the literature , many of which are contradictory , mainly due to the different assumptions which are made .",
    "there are two important issues here : the size of the loops produced by the string network and the spectrum of the radiation they produce .",
    "these issues require detailed modeling of the behaviour of the string network on small scales and an understanding of the impact of radiation backreaction .",
    "the size of loops produced is usually assumed to be a constant fraction of the horizon size at formation , @xmath63 , and will be related to the gravitational backreaction scale by @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is defined below .",
    "the nambu simulations do not include the effects of radiation backreaction , and we have argued that the ah simulations include massive radiation at an unnaturally strong level . therefore , there is no reliable determination of the loop production size @xmath8 from either type of simulation .",
    "the spectrum of radiation emitted by given loop solutions of the nambu equations of motion can be computed using the quadrupole formula under the assumption that backreaction does not effect the shape of the string trajectory . in particular",
    "one finds that the total power emitted by a loop is independent of the size the loop , @xmath66 , and if given by @xmath67 .",
    "this can be written in terms of harmonics of half of the string length , @xmath68 , as @xmath69 where @xmath70 .",
    "typically values of @xmath71 are 4/3 for loops which generate cusps  @xcite , a point on the loop which travels at the speed of light at some point during its evolution , and 2 for a square loop which has 4 kinks on it  @xcite .",
    "however , this simplification has a significant drawback : it assumes that the string solution is not affected by radiation backreaction .",
    "this would mean that the cusps and kinks , both of which are points on the string moving at the speed of light , are not rounded off by the radiation they produce .",
    "the issue of gravitational radiation backreaction is difficult to address quantitatively , but it might be possible to glean some understanding of the process by studying goldstone boson radiation from global strings instead . although it is typically much stronger , this radiation is in many other ways similar to gravitational radiation , but in contrast it can be studied using a field theoretic approach .",
    "it has been shown that kinks on global strings are rapidly smoothed out by goldstone boson radiation , and an initial kink perturbation is more or less indistinguishable from a sinusoidal perturbation after a few timesteps  @xcite ; a similar effect is expected for cusps .",
    "this suggests that the radiation spectrum from a loop will be modifed either by a change in the power law , or strong cut - off at large @xmath72 .    in order to make contact with bounds on a stochastic background of gravitational waves from pulsar timing we need to estimate the spectral energy density of gravitational waves @xmath73 emitted by the network",
    "this can be related to the dimensionless strain by @xmath74    in ref .",
    "@xcite the effects of varying the power spectrum of radiation from the strings were studied .",
    "it was shown that the observed gravitational radiation background in the region relevant for pulsar observations ( @xmath75 was sensitive spectrum of radiation emitted by the strings .",
    "in particular , it was shown that the amplitude of the background at these frequencies was around a factor of 3 higher when @xmath76 compared to @xmath77 .",
    "a similar result was obtained by truncating the @xmath76 spectrum at some point @xmath78 .",
    "the reason for this is that the emission at this particular frequency receives contributions from loops formed in the radiation era and also those from the matter era if they emit into high harmonics .",
    "whatever one does with the spectrum of radiation emitted by loops from the matter era , the radiation era contribution will remain and , therefore , given the uncertainties in the spectrum of radiation from loops discussed above , we will take a conservative approach and just use the radiation era contribution as a lower bound on the signal for a given @xmath3 .",
    "tighter , but less reliable , constraints can be found by including the matter era contribution .",
    "we will assume that @xmath8 is undetermined and use the analytic form for the radiation era spectrum presented in ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 is the total matter density relative to the critical density . in what follows we use parameters measured from the nambu simulation to give @xmath82 , @xmath83 and we set @xmath84 .",
    "we will ignore the uncertainties in these parameters since their cummulative effect is likely to be less than the uncertainties imposed by the lack of knowledge of @xmath8 and the radiation spectrum .",
    "the constraints on @xmath3 are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : pulsar ] for @xmath85 and as a function of @xmath8 for a number of different possible values for the limit on @xmath86 .",
    "probably the most reliable of the published limit is @xmath87  @xcite .",
    "there is stronger published limit of @xmath88  @xcite , although this is controversial  @xcite .",
    "we have also included the value of @xmath89  @xcite which is that used in ref .",
    "@xcite . in each case",
    "the limit is flat for @xmath90 and is @xmath91 for @xmath92 ; this asymptotic behaviour can be understood easily from ( [ omg ] ) . using the limit of ref .",
    "@xcite we find that @xmath9 for @xmath10 and @xmath93 for @xmath12 .",
    "in the former case this is weaker than the bound from the cmb and in the latter could be much stronger dependent on the value of @xmath8 .",
    "there are a wide range limits on @xmath3 presented in the literature , often using identical or at the very least similar data . in this paper",
    "we have tried to clarify these issues and present what we believe are current constaints from the cmb and large scale structure data , and also from pulsar timing .",
    "we have presented evidence that the string spectra which come from different simulation techniques can all be modelled using the usm with parameters measured in simulations and deduce limits of @xmath0 if the nambu simulations are correct and @xmath94 if the ah simulations are correct .",
    "these use cmb+sdss data and @xmath51 as the parameter .",
    "we have also included data from bbn and used @xmath95 $ ] as the parameter with similar but quantitatively different conclusions .",
    "the limits from pulsar timing could already be much stronger than those from the cmb , for example , if @xmath8 is large .",
    "however , the uncertainties in interpretation of the pulsar limits on @xmath86 are much more severe . at this stage",
    ", it seems safest to use the low @xmath8 limit of @xmath96 , which is one that is unlikely to have to be taken back .    as a final point",
    "we should note that a network of cosmic strings has another possible observational consequence in the cmb , albeit one of lower amplitude : the creation of b - mode polarization  @xcite whose detection to very low values of @xmath97 might be possible if lense cleaning is found to be possible  @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that a substantial fraction of the anisotropies created by strings are vector modes . in fig .",
    "[ fig : bmode ] we have presented the b - mode spectra for the nambu and ah models with the value of @xmath3 set to their repsective upper limits .",
    "these spectra are very different to those predicted in by inflationary models parameterized by the scalar - to - tensor ratio , @xmath98 which are also included in the figure . in fact , the spectra for @xmath99 are similar to that produced by gravitational lensing particularly for tte nambu case .",
    "this is because the b - mode polarization is created along the line of sight , albeit on different scales to the gravitational lensing pf the primary e - mode signal .",
    "these spectra comprise a white noise portion and a peak corresponding to the dominant scale which is on slightly larger scales in the ah model and , by coincidence , very similar to the lensing for the nambu model . for the nambu cas",
    "this similarity will make them difficult to detect unless one can detect the analogue of the reionization bump which peaks around @xmath100 .",
    "it is , however , interesting since most inflationary models which produce strings create very low levels of gravitational waves .",
    "it has been shown that it is possible to discriminated them in the ah case  @xcite .",

    "the calculations were performed on computing infrastructure purchased with funds from the canadian foundation for innovation and the british columbia knowledge development fund .",

    "<S> the degeneracy between @xmath3 and the power spectrum slope @xmath4 is substantially reduced from previous work . </S>",
    "<S> inclusion of constraints on the baryon density from big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) imply that @xmath5 at around the @xmath6 level for both the nambu and abelian - higgs cases . as a by - product of our results </S>",
    "<S> , we find there is `` moderate - to - strong '' bayesian evidence that the harrison - zeldovich spectrum is excluded ( odds ratio of @xmath7 ) by the combination of cmb , sdss and bbn when compared to the standard 6 parameter fit . using the contribution to the gravitational wave background from radiation era loops as a conservative lower bound on the signal for specific values of @xmath3 and loop production size , @xmath8 , we find that @xmath9 for @xmath10 and @xmath11 for @xmath12 . </S>"
