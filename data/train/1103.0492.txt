    "the evolution of multi - particle systems arising in very diverse domains ranging from biology to material science is often governed by activated processes that occur with very low probability , but have a dramatic effect on the structure .",
    "examples of physical phenomena controlled by such rare events are protein folding in biology , defect diffusion and crystal nucleation in condensed matter physics and cluster rearrangement in chemistry .",
    "activated events are characterized by the fact that when they occur , their duration is rather short , e.g. of the order of the picoseconds in dense molecular systems , but that , in contrast , the typical time needed for them to start is very large .",
    "this separation of time - scale is the very definition of metastability ; its origin may be energetic ( high barriers ) or , more likely in high dimensional systems , at least partly entropic ( pathways hard to find ) . even though physical times of activated events can be achieved in computer simulation",
    "using molecular dynamics , monitoring rare fluctuations is computationally expensive and still remains a challenge because of the long waiting time for the event to occur . to overcome this problem ,",
    "several different strategies have been developed over the past years .",
    "a common idea behind these techniques is to bias the dynamics of the system in order to enhance the occurrence of reaction , or to use previous knowledge of the outcome of the reaction and to fix the endpoint of the trajectory . in order to implement this , in many cases one needs to know an order parameter able to discriminate between the reactant basin , the saddle regions and the product basin .",
    "a set of methods involving the direct sampling of path ensembles has been developed during the last decade .",
    "@xcite the strategy is to restrict paths to the subset of reactive paths , those that interpolate between reactant and product basins .",
    "examples of such methods are transition path sampling ,  @xcite transition interface sampling .",
    "@xcite another family of methods such as metadynamics  @xcite and forward flux sampling  @xcite simulate the evolution in time of the system , and include some form of bias that guarantees that the reaction happens , but then of course the effect of the bias has to be discounted in order to retrieve the true statistics .",
    "methods differ also in the way rate constants are estimated ,  @xcite and the ability to handle nonequilibrium steady states .",
    "observation of rare events and exploration of energy landscapes of a multi - particle system are indeed two interconnected problems .",
    "the requirement of knowing the target of the reaction , and in particular a relevant order parameter that parametrizes the path is problematic in physical situations where nothing _ a priori _ is known .",
    "thus , a preliminary step prior to the calculation of finite - temperature rate constants using the sampling techniques mentioned above may consist in locating the saddle points of the energy and the corresponding energy minima using one of the eigenvector following methods described in the literature ( e.g. the activation - relaxation technique ,  @xcite optim  @xcite or the dimer method  @xcite ) .",
    "the technique in all these methods relies on monitoring the eigenvalues of the hessian matrix ( the matrix of the second derivatives of the potential energy ) , in order to individuate stable or unstable directions , i.e. minima or saddles .",
    "a limitation of these methods is that energy saddles only correspond directly to the actual barriers for the dynamics if the temperature is very low , otherwise the entropic contribution to the dynamics becomes relevant .",
    "another approach that may be used to explore the _ free - energy _",
    "( i.e. finite - temperature ) barriers between basins @xcite is inspired by supersymmetric quantum mechanics , which has been used in the context of field theory to derive and generalize morse theory , precisely the analysis of the saddle points of a function .",
    "transposing to statistical physics this formalism , one obtains a family of generalizations of langevin dynamics , converging to barriers and reaction paths of different kinds , rather than to the equilibrium basins .",
    "the resulting method involves the evolution in phase space of a population of independent trajectories that are replicated or eliminated according to the value of their lyapunov exponent.@xcite the theory guarantees that by selecting trajectories having larger lyapunov exponents in a specified way , the bias is just what is needed so that the population describes the evolution of the _ transition current _ , rather than that of the configurations,@xcite as they would in an unbiased case .",
    "the advantage is that the convergence of the current distribution is much faster than the typical passage time .",
    "in this paper we shall present a more direct and elementary derivation of this dynamics without resorting to quantum theory ( section  [ theorie ] ) . extending the more concise demonstration of ref .",
    ", we will show how the modified dynamics precisely reproduces the evolution in the phase space of the probability current ( or more precisely , the ` transition ' probability current ) between equilibrium basins , thus achieving a _ probability current sampling _ of the system dynamics .",
    "as the transition current evolves in time , it explores the different barriers , indicating which states are reached after different passage times . starting from an initial equilibrium configuration , far from equilibrium phenomena",
    "are easily sampled , as the simulated current is an intrinsically out of equilibrium quantity.@xcite in section   [ method ] , we discuss the actual population dynamic algorithm that may be used to simulate the probability current .",
    "finally , in order to assess the performances of this probability current sampling , we present in section [ sec : lj38 ] an application to the structural transitions of a lennard - jones cluster , sampled under different physical conditions . we shall recover known results , and discuss some new ones , obtained in all cases at rather small computational costs .",
    "let us consider a 3d many - body system composed of _ n _ particles in contact with a thermal bath .",
    "we denote @xmath1 the configurational degrees of freedom and @xmath2 the interaction potential . in the limit of large friction @xmath3 , where inertia can be neglected",
    ", the system evolves with a standard overdamped langevin dynamics @xmath4 where @xmath5 are independent gaussian white noises of unit variance and @xmath6 correspond to the particle masses .    the probability to find the system at position @xmath7 then evolves with the fokker - planck equation  @xcite @xmath8 where we have introduced the fokker - planck operator @xmath9 .",
    "we can use the probability current @xmath10 to write eq .  [",
    "1.1 ] as a continuity equation for the probability density : @xmath11 for systems with separation of time scales , the dynamics can be split into two regimes .",
    "starting from an arbitrary probability distribution , @xmath12 relaxes _ rapidly _ into a sum of contributions centered on the metastable states . at _ much longer times _ , the rare transitions between the metastable states make @xmath13 relax to the equilibrium distribution .",
    "two time scales can also be identified for the dynamics of the probability current . while the probability density rapidly relaxes into the metastable states , the probability current converges _ on the same time scale _ to the most probable transition paths between the metastable states .",
    "then , the late time relaxation towards equilibrium corresponds to a progressive vanishing of the current , when forward and backward flux between each metastable state balance .",
    "@xcite note that the same line of reasoning holds for non - equilibrium systems in which the forces do not derive from a global potential . in such systems ,",
    "the probability current never vanishes and converges instead to its steady - state value .",
    "if one were able to simulate the evolution of the probability current , one would thus have all the knowledge relevant for the transitions between metastable states , while only having to simulate the system for relatively short time - scales ( similar to the equilibration time within a metastable state ) . as mentioned in the introduction , simulating directly the transition current is the goal of this paper and we now derive a self - consistent evolution equation for @xmath14 .",
    "let us define the _ current operator _",
    "@xmath15 : @xmath16 so that the probability current and the fokker - planck operator becomes    @xmath17    the evolution of the probability current is then given by @xmath18 where we have assumed that @xmath9 does not depend explicitly on time .",
    "straightforward algebra shows that @xmath19 and @xmath20 which turns equation into @xmath21 using the expressions and for the currents and fokker - planck operator we obtain @xmath22 note that the equations and are not self - contained : the knowledge of @xmath23 is required to compute @xmath14 . on the contrary ,",
    "depends exclusively on the current , and can readily be used to simulate @xmath14 , without having to compute @xmath23 beforehand .",
    "the only condition is that the current distribution at the initial time @xmath24 indeed derives from a probability distribution , i.e. is of the form : @xmath25   \\label{initial}\\ ] ] this means that the initial current distribution should be such that the quantity @xmath26 @xmath27 is a gradient , @xmath28 .",
    "a particularly simple initial condition is obtained if one assumes that @xmath29 is gibbsean @xmath30 in a region @xmath31 , and zero elsewhere .",
    "then , from eq .",
    "( [ initial ] ) , @xmath32 is zero everywhere except on the surface of @xmath31 , where it takes the form of a vector normal to the surface of @xmath31 , and with amplitude proportional to the gibbs weight .",
    "the evolution of current distribution given by equation , starting from an appropriate initial current @xmath33 converges to the stationary distribution of currents between metastable states _ on the same time scale _ as the usual langevin equation converges to metastable - state .",
    "it is thus not necessary to wait for rare events to identify the transition path between the metastable states , an important improvement over standard md methods .",
    "if there are several metastable states and transitions with different rates , the current distribution at longer times concentrates on the paths between regions that have not yet mutually equilibrated , and vanishes in transitions between states that have had the time to mutually equilibrate .      in many physical situations inertia plays an important role and one can not rely on overdamped langevin equations .",
    "@xcite in such case , the stochastic dynamics of @xmath34 interacting particles is given by    @xmath35    [ langund ]    where @xmath36 correspond to the @xmath37 velocities .    in order to transpose the derivation of the current evolution given in subsection [ sec : fp ] to the inertial case , we have to consider the kramers evolution equation @xmath38 instead of the fokker - planck equation :  @xcite @xmath39p\\;.\\ ] ] as in the overdamped case , this can be written as a conservation equation where the probability current _ in phase space _ is given by    [ test ] @xmath40    once again , the current contains all the information about transitions between metastable states .",
    "there is however a conceptual difference : the presence of inertia makes it inherently difficult ( and indeed , useless ) , to compute  ( [ test ] ) as it stands .",
    "the reason is that the _ phase - space _",
    "current @xmath41 is non - zero even in canonical equilibrium .",
    "for example , in a harmonic oscillator @xmath42 $ ] , the phase - space current in equilibrium turns clockwise in circles around the origin .",
    "for this reason , the part of the current that corresponds to transitions between metastable states is screened by the large contributions of the currents within metastable states ( see figure [ fig : exprobcur ] ) .",
    "the probability current and does not really represent the transition paths between metastable states .",
    "we can however define a _",
    "transition current _",
    "@xcite    [ eqn : transcur ] @xmath43    which has two interesting properties .",
    "firstly , this current differs from the probability current by a divergenceless term and thus also satisfies the continuity equation @xmath44 .",
    "fluxes out of a closed surface surrounding a metastable state are then the same for the probability and transition currents .",
    "the latter current thus contains the relevant information about , for instance , transition rates .",
    "secondly , the transition current vanishes in equilibrium , as can be checked by comparing   and  .",
    "this current thus contains only the information relevant for the transitions between metastable states ( see figure  [ fig : exprobcur ] ) and is _ not _ screened by the large ` equilibrium ' currents within them .     in phase space",

    "the probability density @xmath49 is a scalar field that can be obtained by simulating many copies of the system , evolving their positions and velocities with the langevin equation  , and constructing histograms . on the contrary",
    ", @xmath50 is a vector field and thus can not be obtained in the same way : it also requires vectorial degrees of freedom .",
    "we first present a population dynamics that can be used to construct the evolution of the transition current in section  [ sec : evolcurtheory ] and then give the corresponding diffusion monte carlo algorithm in section  [ sec : evolcuralgo ] .      for systems with many degrees of freedom ,",
    "the direct resolution of the partial differential equation   yielding the evolution of @xmath50 is not achievable numerically . in the same way",

    "the explicit construction of the dynamics was already presented in detail in a previous paper .",
    "@xcite the idea is to proceed in two steps .",

    "secondly , the transition current @xmath50 is given by the following average : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a joint distribution obtained from the langevin dynamics , for instance by simulating a large number of copies of the system .",
    "@xcite    in practice , the coupling between the vectorial and phase space degrees of freedom is obtained by the following population dynamics .",
    "one consider @xmath56 copies of the system ( called ` clones ' ) , identified by positions and velocities @xmath57 and @xmath58 , which all carry a @xmath51 dimensional unitary vector @xmath59 .",
    "the dynamics of each clone is then as follows :  @xcite    * @xmath57 and @xmath60 evolve with the standard langevin dynamics with inertia   * the vector @xmath59 evolves with @xmath61 * each clone has a _ birth - death rate _ @xmath62 .",
    "this is the only way the vector @xmath59 influences the dynamics .",
    "the distribution of clones @xmath63 then evolves with  @xcite @xmath64 f - { \\bf u}^\\dagger { \\bf m } { \\bf u } f\\ ] ] the first term of the r.h.s .",
    "comes from the langevin dynamics  , the second one from the evolution of the vector   and the last one from the birth - death events .",
    "the transition current is then given by  .",
    "on can indeed check that taking the time derivative of the r.h.s of   and using  , one recovers the evolution of the transition current   ( see previous papers  @xcite for more details ) .",
    "we first present the implementation of the population dynamics of the clones and then discuss the construction of the transition current .",
    "the @xmath65-th clone is denoted by its phase - space coordinates and vectors at time @xmath66 , @xmath67 .",
    "we start with @xmath68 clones whose positions and vectors are arbitrarily chosen . at every time step , the dynamics is as follows :    1 .",
    "all the vectors @xmath69 are rescaled to have a unitary norm .",
    "the positions and velocities of the clones are propagated using a leap - frog discretized langevin dynamics .",
    "@xcite 3 .",
    "the vectors @xmath69 evolve with the ( leap - frog discretized version of ) the following dynamics : @xmath70 note that at after this step , the vectors are no more of unitary norm .",
    "4 .   for each clone one records @xmath71 .",
    "we associate to each clone @xmath65 a probability weight @xmath72 and a random number @xmath73 chosen uniformly in @xmath74 . the clone is then replaced by @xmath75 copies , with @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the integer part of @xmath78 : if @xmath79 , @xmath80 new copies of the m - th clone are made . if @xmath81 , the clone is deleted and if @xmath82 , nothing happens .",
    "the population size is thus increased by @xmath80 if @xmath79 or decreased by @xmath83 if @xmath81 .",
    "after the step 5 , the population is rescaled from its current size @xmath84 to its initial size @xmath68 , by uniformly pruning / replicating the clones .",
    "steps 1 to 3 correspond to the propagation step of independent clones , whereas steps 4 to 6 correspond to selection steps . in particular , the steps 4 and 5 correctly represents the cloning rate @xmath85 of the previous subsection since @xmath86 , so that @xmath87 .",
    "the rescaling of the population at the step 6 can be done in many ways .",
    "for instance , one can pick a new clone at random @xmath68 times among the @xmath88 clones obtained at the end of the step 5 .",
    "we used an alternative approach that is less costly in terms of data manipulations : if @xmath89 , we kill @xmath90 clones chosen uniformly at random among the @xmath88 obtained at the end of the step 5 .",
    "conversely , if @xmath91 , we choose uniformly at random @xmath92 clones and duplicate them . note that even though the clones evolve independently during the propagation step , their dynamics are correlated because the deleted clones are replaced by the duplicated ones at the selection steps . when the probability weights of the clones are all equal",
    ", we have @xmath93 and @xmath82 . as a result",
    ", the population is left unchanged .",
    "conversely , when the clone weights take distinct values , clones with small weights are likely to be replaced by those with large weights .",
    "there are many ways of implementing the resampling of the population ( steps 5 - 6 ) , well documented in the literature on diffusion monte carlo .",
    "@xcite in particular , it could be advantageous to do the resampling only every @xmath94 time steps , where @xmath94 is tuned to ensure ergodicity in phase space , i.e. to achieve enhanced sampling towards the unstable regions where saddles are located .",
    "since the clones move in phase space with a langevin dynamics , it can be surprising that they converge rapidly to the reaction paths , i.e. that they explore efficiently the transition states .",
    "this can however be understood by noting that their dynamics ( without taking the averages ) is the so - called _ lyapunov weighted dynamics _",
    "@xcite which is used to bias the langevin dynamics in favor of chaotic trajectories .",
    "the clones will then tend to ` reproduce ' favorably in the neighborhood of saddles , which are particularly chaotic regions of phase space , and to die in wells .",
    "this generates an ` evolutionary pressure ' that helps the clone escape from metastable states and find the reaction paths .    as mentioned before , this dynamics",
    "does not provide _ directly _ the transition current and one still has to construct the averages .",
    "this can be difficult and clever methods to do so were discussed in the literature , for instance by mossa and clementi who studied the folding of chain of aminoacids .",
    "@xcite the difficulty is connected to the well - known sign problem : large population of clones with arrows pointing in opposite directions cancel in the average but can numerically screen smaller asymmetric distribution that contains the information relevant for the transition current .",
    "one can however show that if one starts from a population of clones uniformly spread over a reaction path separating two metastable states and pointing in the same direction , the time taken for the sign problem to occur is of the order of the tunneling time through the barrier ( see appendix  [ app : ex1d ] ) . in the following",
    "we will always simulate much shorter times and omit the averaging steps to simply look at the distribution of clones .",
    "this distribution often suffices to locate the reaction paths , as can be seen on figure [ fig : exprobcur ] for the double well potential . to extract further information , for instance regarding the reaction rates",
    ", we would need to do the averages , as was done in ref .  , but this is beyond the scope of this article .",
    "we now turn to the study of transitions between metastable states in the 38-atom lennard - jones cluster , a benchmark model system that has been extensively investigated in the past .",
    "@xcite this system has a complex potential energy landscape organized around two main basins : a deep and narrow funnel contains the global energy minimum , a face - centered - cubic truncated octahedron configuration ( fcc ) , while a separate , wider , funnel leads to a large number of incomplete mackay icosahedral structures ( ico ) of slightly higher energies .",
    "although the lowest potential energy minimum corresponds to the fcc structure , the greater configurational entropy associated to the large number of local minima in the icosahedral funnel make this second configuration much more stable at higher temperatures . as temperature increases ,",
    "this system thus undergoes the finite - size counterpart of several phase transitions .",
    "first , a solid - solid transition occurs at @xmath95 when the octahedral fcc structure gives place to the icosahedral ones . at a slightly higher temperature , @xmath96 , the outer layer of the cluster melts , while the core remains of icosahedral structure .",
    "@xcite this ` liquid - like ' structure , also referred to as anti - mackay in the literature , then completely melts around @xmath97 .",
    "@xcite    the numerical study of this system is challenging : global optimization algorithms have failed to find its global energy minimum for a long time  @xcite and direct monte carlo sampling fails to equilibrate the two funnels .",
    "the study of the equilibrium thermodynamics of this system required more elaborate algorithms such as parallel tempering ,  @xcite basin - sampling techniques ,  @xcite wang - landau approaches  @xcite or path - sampling methods .",
    "@xcite    more recently , the dynamical transitions between the two basins has been studied following various approaches .",
    "the interconversion rates between the fcc and ico structures have been computed using discrete path sampling .",
    "@xcite this elaborate algorithm relies on the localization of minima and saddles of the potential energy landscape , using eigenvector following , and then on graph transformation  @xcite to compute the overall transition rate between two regions of phase space . to the best of our knowledge , this is the most successful approach as far as computing reaction rates in lj@xmath0 is concerned .",
    "@xcite however , the numerical methods involved are quite elaborate , require considerable expertise and have a number of drawbacks , all deriving from the fact that it is based on the harmonic superposition approximation and the theory of thermally activated processes .",
    "it thus requires any intermediate minima between the two basins to be equilibrated and this is only possible for small enough systems at low temperatures .",
    "@xcite more importantly , when the difficulty in going from one basin to the other is due to entropic problems , as is the case for instance in hourglass shaped billiards , then the knowledge of minima and saddles of the potential energy landscape is not sufficient .",
    "another attempt to study the transitions between the two funnels of lj@xmath0 relies on the use of transition path sampling .",
    "@xcite because of the number of metastable states separating the two main basins , the traditional shooting and shifting algorithm failed here , despite previous success for smaller lj clusters .",
    "@xcite the authors thus developed a two - ended approach which manages to successfully locate reaction paths between the two basins : they started from a straight trial trajectory linking the two minima , and obtained convergence towards trajectories of energies similar to those obtained in the discrete path sampling approach .",
    "@xcite although the authors point out the lack of ergodicity in the sampling within their approach and the sensitivity on the ` discretization ' of the trajectories , this is nevertheless a progress and the main drawback remains the high computational cost ( the work needed @xmath98 hours of cpu time ) to obtain such converged trajectories .",

    "to show the spread of the various basins in the @xmath123 plane , we ran several molecular dynamic simulations , long enough to equilibrate within each basin but short enough so that one does not see tunneling ( see figure  [ fig : bassinsmd ] ) .    .",

    "given the high dimensionality of the system , it is difficult to follow the evolution of all the coordinates of the clones in order to know if they have localized interesting structures .",
    "instead , we proceed as follows : we plot the evolution of the average over the clone population of @xmath118 , @xmath119 and @xmath128 as a function of the simulation time and we frequently store the positions and velocities of all the clones .",
    "if we see a plateau in @xmath129 , @xmath130 and @xmath131 , two cases are possible : either the clones have converged to a reaction path , or they are stuck in a metastable basin . in order to distinguish the two situations , we run an auxiliary short molecular dynamic simulation ( _ without cloning _ ) starting from the positions and velocities of the clones .",
    "the duration of this auxiliary simulation is long enough to observe relaxation into the metastable basins , but much shorter than the transition times .",
    "if the clones evolve away from the region they had populated in phase - space , we know they had found a reaction path and the auxiliary md simulation converges to the metastable basins connected by this reaction path . if on the other hand the clones do not evolve away , we know that they had been stuck in some local basin",
    ". in such a case we can change two parameters to enhance the sampling of the phase space : the number of clones and the friction @xmath132 ( see below for more details ) .",

    "any observable that can measure whether the population of clones splits in two separate sub - populations after a short langevin dynamics would be suitable . if the clone population splits in two subpopulations with the same @xmath118 , @xmath119 and @xmath128 , we may fail to detect the corresponding barrier .",
    "however , this coincidence would be extremely unlikely .",
    "last , in addition to help us localize barriers , these short langevin simulations allows us to explore the true dynamics close to a particular transition states .",
    "we first ran several simulations at @xmath134 , where the most stable state is the mackay icosahedral minimum ( icom ) while the liquid - like phase ( icoam ) and the fcc basin are metastable .",
    "starting from the icom basin with @xmath135 clones and a low friction @xmath136 , the clones rapidly find ( @xmath137 ) a transition path to the liquid - like phase icoam .",
    "later on ( @xmath138 ) an activated event bring the clones to another reaction path that points towards the fcc funnel .",
    "these times have to be compared with the transition time between the icom and fcc basins that was previously evaluated in the literature at roughly @xmath139 .",
    "@xcite note that each barrier or path act as a metastable state for the cloned dynamics and it is by activation that the population jumps from one barrier to another .",
    "running the same dynamics with a larger number of clones ( @xmath140 ) tends to stabilize the first barrier so that one has to wait longer to see the transition to the second one .",
    "starting from the fcc minimum with the same number of clones and at the same friction results in the clones rapidly going out of the fcc funnel and falling in the amorphous zone at the entrance of the icosahedral funnel .",
    "@xcite a reaction path is _ followed _ by the clones but not _ maintained_. to stabilize this reaction path , we increased the number of clones and the friction .",

    "the method has several attractive features :    _ i _ ) it does not require any previous knowledge of the relevant reaction coordinates . on the other hand , if an approximation of the reaction path is known _ a priori _ , one may always start the clones along this path , and they will populate the true current distribution in a shorter time .",

    "reaction paths between non - equilibrium metastable states , which can not be described in term of a free energy , may be studied in the same way .",
    "the only difference is that the average   does not vanish in the long time limit and converges instead to the steady - state transition current .",
