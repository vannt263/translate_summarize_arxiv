    "we find that the njl model predicts that , except well below nuclear matter density , it is energetically much more favorable to form three diquarks than it is to form two nucleons , and that there are no nucleon instabilities for the high densities where color superconductivity is expected to occur .",
    "however we should not conclude on the basis of these results that there is no competition between nucleon formation and diquark condensation .",
    "since this model predicts that nuclear matter should consist of diquarks , a result clearly at odds with what is actually observed , some elements of reality are missing .",

    "it poses a rather deep question about the interpretation of the njl model at finite densities . in much of the recent literature",
    "it has been used to model an instanton - induced interaction between the quarks in high - density matter beyond the chiral / deconfining phase transition .",
    "we have tried to follow a more traditional approach , where the model is interpreted as a density model for hadron structure in the vacuum . in that case",
    "the model contains _ unphysical _ diquark degrees of freedom , which may be ignored at zero density as being `` irrelevant '' . both of these approaches have flaws . in the first ( high - density ) interpretation",
    ", we have no clue as to what remnants of confinement may play a role in the interaction . in the second ( low - density ) interpretation we can not even describe nuclear matter properly .",
    "standing back and looking at our results in the light of these problems with the model , we note from fig .",
    "[ enernuc ] that the nucleon energy is roughly independent of density .",
    "it is mainly the increase in the diquark binding that renders the nucleon unstable .",
    "one could naively add to the njl model a three - body force that provides attraction in the color - singlet channel , to incorporate an approximate description of confinement .",
    "alternatively one might modify our treatment to use confined rather than free quark and diquark propagators @xcite .",
    "both of these choices have some appeal , but neither really deals with the underlying mechanism of confinement .",
    "one should also remember that our results have all been obtained using the `` rainbow - ladder '' approximation to the diquark bethe - salpeter equation and the faddeev equation . in the context of models with nonlocal interactions between the quarks",
    ", it has been shown @xcite that this approximation over - predicts diquark binding . with a toy model for the gluon propagator which leads to quark confinement",
    ", diquark condensation has been shown to occur even though diquarks are no longer bound at zero density @xcite .",
    "hence another way to approach this problem may be to study the faddeev equation within a less restrictive calculational scheme .",
    "we are very grateful to noriyoshi ishii for providing us valuable details of the derivation of the bethe - salpeter and faddeev equations .",
