    "+ first we consider an abstract version of the problem : given a number field @xmath80 and a morphism @xmath286 such that there exists an automorphism @xmath287 of @xmath288 such that @xmath289 is the base extension of a morphism @xmath290 , find such morphisms @xmath287 and @xmath129 .      representing @xmath287 as a mbius transformation @xmath296 , one can ,",
    "after scaling by a non - zero @xmath297 , solve for the coefficients @xmath297 in terms of coordinates of the points @xmath298 and @xmath299 .",
    "it is then easy to see that @xmath300 for all @xmath294 and thus @xmath301 .",
    "one can solve the abstract problem in the following situation : let @xmath292 be 3 distinct points and suppose there exists an automorphism @xmath302 such that @xmath303 and each @xmath304 satisfy the hypothesis of lemma [ l : moebius ] .",
    "then @xmath303 is defined over @xmath34 .",
    "setting @xmath305 , we get a commutative diagram @xmath306_f\\ar[rr]^{\\phi_{/k}}&&\\p^1\\ar[d]^{g_{/k}}\\ar[rr]^{\\phi'_{/k } } & & \\p^1\\ar[dll]^{g'}\\\\ & & \\p^1 & & } \\ ] ] since one has @xmath307 , we conclude that @xmath308 is defined over @xmath34 and differs from @xmath129 by the @xmath34-automorphism @xmath309 .",
    "+ now suppose @xmath47 is given by the equation @xmath310 .",
    "let @xmath311)$ ] be the splitting field of @xmath312 . then the 2-torsion points of @xmath47 are defined over @xmath80 .",
    "let @xmath313 be the 2-torsion points of @xmath47 and define @xmath314 to be @xmath315 , with @xmath316 the quotient map and @xmath317 the dual isogeny .    as in @xcite*4.4 the isogeny @xmath318 changes the weil pairing by @xmath125 ( since for a 2-isogeny @xmath319 , @xmath320 , where the first equality is @xcite*iii.8.2 ) .",
    "in particular , if @xmath48 is an elliptic curve and @xmath55 \\cong e[5]$ ] is an anti - symplectic isomorphism ( so that the map induced by the weil pairing is @xmath57 ) then the composition @xmath55 \\cong e[5 ] \\xrightarrow{\\psi_1 } e_1[5]$ ] ( where @xmath321 is the restriction to @xmath63 $ ] of @xmath321 ) is symplectic .",
    "this induces an isomorphism @xmath322 over @xmath323 , which is the situation of the above discussion .    to apply this ,",
    "let @xmath324 be three points induced by the isogenies @xmath325 . by computing @xmath326 , it is easy to compute explicit points on @xmath327 which represent @xmath328 .",
    "let @xmath329 be the roots of @xmath312 .",
    "since @xmath330 is the @xmath22-coordinate of the 2-torsion point @xmath331 , the galois action on the ordered set @xmath329 agrees with the action on @xmath332 , and thus also on @xmath333 .",
    "our hypothesis is that we have an explicit identification of @xmath334 with @xmath203 .",

    "one can explicitly compute @xmath314 , @xmath338 , @xmath339 , and the map @xmath340 ; equations for the map @xmath341 are computed in @xcite .",
    "the composition @xmath342 is thus an explicitly computable model for the map @xmath247 .",

    "now let @xmath47 be given by the equation @xmath343 . in @xcite the equations for the map @xmath246",
    "are given as a function of the coefficients @xmath344 and @xmath345 of @xmath47 .",
    "it it clear that the technique of this appendix can be refined to do the same for the map @xmath281 , since all of the numbers constructed ( e.g. the @xmath110-invariants of the 2-isogenous curves @xmath314 ) depend algebraically on @xmath344 and @xmath345 .",
