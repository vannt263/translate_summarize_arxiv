    "while their results satisfactorily describe observed properties of galaxy clusters @xcite , some discrepancy seems to appear when we consider galaxy haloes .",
    "n - body simulations predict a very steep , nfw - like density profile of the central region of the dark matter haloes @xcite .",
    "the navarro - frenk - white profile behaves there as @xmath1 .",
    "though recent simulations favour the einasto profile @xcite @xmath2 \\label{15a0}\\ ] ] with a finite density in the center @xcite , the index of the profile is so high ( typically , @xmath3 ) that it can also be considered as a cuspy one .    on the contrary , observations @xcite show that galaxies have a core ( i.e. a region with rather a shallow density profile ) in the center .",
    "@xcite fitted the dark matter density profiles of a large array of spiral galaxies by the einasto profile , considering the einasto index @xmath4 as a free parameter .",
    "they found that einasto profile provides a significantly better fit of observational data of the central region than either nfw or the cored pseudo - isothermal profiles .",
    "however , the einasto index is found to be small ( @xmath5 ) , that actually corresponds to a cored profile and is not in agreement with the predictions from @xmath6cdm simulations .",
    "dwarf spheroidal galaxies also show no cusps in their centra @xcite .",
    "there are several possible ways to account for this disagreement .",
    "it can be caused by baryons ( though this explanation does not seem very convincing for the dwarf spheroidals , containing only a very minor fraction of baryon matter ) .",
    "the absence of the cusps could be a sign that the dark matter is warm and consists of light particles like sterile neutrinos .",
    "finally , n - body simulations are not obligatory infallible @xcite : in particular , they model minuscule dark matter particles by @xmath7 bodies .",
    "moreover , the central region of dark matter haloes is notoriously difficult for cosmological numerical simulations to resolve , as very high particle numbers and very short time steps are required @xcite .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to show that a central profile , very close to the observed one , inevitably forms in the center of dark matter haloes if we make the only supposition about a moderate energy relaxation of the system during the halo formation .",
    "first of all , we should define the term moderate energy relaxation. let us denote by @xmath8 the total energy of a unit mass of the matter , @xmath9 is the gravitational potential .",
    "when a halo collapses , remarkable inhomogeneities and caustics appear ; their strong small - scale gravitational field may significantly change parameters of the dark matter particles with respect to the initial ones .",
    "the idea of the violent relaxation @xcite was the supposition that a particle completely forgets its initial state during the relaxation , and its final energy has no connection with the initial one .",
    "however , recent n - body simulations @xcite suggest that the supposition is not true : the energies of the majority of the particles do not change completely and correlate with the initial ones",
    ".    the absence of violent relaxation should not be very surprising : the main fraction of mass of the future halo is initially concentrated in the outer layers with the highest initial @xmath10 ( since their volume grows as @xmath11 ) .",
    "meanwhile , as it was shown by @xcite , the efficiency of all relaxation processes ( and so the alternation of the particle energy ) rapidly drops with @xmath10 : even in that work the outer part of the system remained unrelaxed .",
    "moreover , simulations show that a significant part of the total mass of the halo accretes to the already collapsed halo @xcite .",
    "this substance has a respectively high total energy and can not be significantly affected by the violent relaxation .",
    "though , as we will see , the density shape in the center of the halo is not similar to the nfw profile if our supposition about moderate relaxation is true , we will use the nfw halo concentration @xmath12 to qualitatively characterize a halo , because of popularity of the nfw profile .",
    "concentration @xmath12 of the milky way galaxy , for instance , lies between @xmath13 and @xmath14 @xcite , and should be even higher for smaller galaxies @xcite .",
    "we suppose hereafter that the energy relaxation of the _ galactic _ dark matter haloes was _ moderate _ in the following sense :    for the majority of the particles , the final energy in the formed halo @xmath15 differs no more than @xmath16 times from the initial value @xmath17",
    "@xmath18    for the milky way galaxy it means that the energies of the majority of the particles have not changed more than @xmath19-@xmath20 times ; for less massive ( and , consequently , more concentrated ) haloes the assumption is even softer .",
    "of course , there are always particles , which energies have changed more than ( [ 15a1 ] ) ; however , we suppose that their fraction is small .",
    "the condition of the moderate relaxation will be specified and restated in the discussion section .",
    "we should underline that we suggest the moderate relaxation only for relatively low - mass objects like haloes of galaxies .",
    "moreover , despite of all the reasoning above , this is no more than a hypothesis : now the assumption can not be certainly proved , while the validity of all results of this article depends on the feasibility of this basic supposition .",
    "however , as we will see , the fulfilment of condition ( [ 15a1 ] ) automatically leads to a central density profile in good agreement with observations @xcite .",
    "for this reason alone it is worthy to consider the moderate relaxation , at least as a hypothesis .",
    "let us consider the initial distribution of matter . hereafter in this article",
    "we will consider a spherically - symmetric task and neglect the presence of baryon matter .",
    "the mass and initial radius of the halo are @xmath21 and @xmath22 , @xmath23 .",
    "if the dark matter is cold , the initial velocity of the matter may be thought of as to be zero without loss of generality @xcite .",
    "( as we will see at the end , the conclusions of this section is also valid for the warm dark matter ) . to begin with ,",
    "let us consider the case when the matter is uniformly distributed inside @xmath22 ( @xmath24 , the tolman case ) .",
    "inside the sphere : @xmath25 @xmath26 hence we obtain the initial energy distribution of the substance : @xmath27\\ ] ] where @xmath28 . performing similar calculations ,",
    "we obtain for the case of initial density perturbation @xmath1 @xmath29\\ ] ] as one can see in fig .",
    "[ 15fig1 ] , distributions ( [ 15a4 ] ) and ( [ 15a5 ] ) differ not so strongly : all the particles lie in a respectively narrow energy range @xmath30 $ ] and the majority of the particles have energies close to @xmath31 .",
    "moreover , the initial energy spectrum of any real ( smooth ) density perturbation lies between ( [ 15a4 ] ) and ( [ 15a5 ] ) : the perturbation collapses when @xmath32 , and @xmath33 weakly depends on its shape .",
    "consequently , if the initial shape of @xmath34 is a smooth function , distributions of @xmath9 and @xmath35 differs from ( [ 15a2 ] ) and ( [ 15a3 ] ) only on a multiplier of the order of @xmath36 . as a result",
    ", distribution @xmath37 does not differ very significantly from the uniform one ( [ 15a4 ] ) . as an illustration",
    ", we also consider profile @xmath38 that well approximates real initial perturbations .",
    "the corresponding energy distribution , represented in in fig .",
    "[ 15fig1 ] , turns out to be quite close to ( [ 15a4 ] ) .",
    "it seems reasonable to say that the initial energy distribution is similar to ( [ 15a4 ] ) under any reasonable choice of shape of the initial perturbations .",
    "if we divide a spherically symmetric initial distribution on radial layers of thickness @xmath39 , @xmath40 is constant within the layer , and the volume of the layer grows as @xmath41 . as a result , the particles with @xmath42 ( which corresponds to @xmath43 ) dominate in the initial energy spectrum even in the case of quite a steep profile ( @xmath44 ) . a strong departure from ( [ 15a4 ] )",
    "will take place only if the initial profile is very steep ( for instance , @xmath45 )",
    ". on the other hand , such profiles are hardly suitable to describe the initial perturbations of dark matter .",
    "so for a large variety of initial conditions the initial energy distribution of the particles is similar to ( [ 15a4 ] ) , at least , in the following sense : the majority of the particles have the energy close to @xmath31 , and their energy distribution is quite narrow . in case of distribution ( [ 15a4 ] ) , for instance , for all the particles @xmath46 $ ] .",
    "this conclusion is also valid for the warm dark matter .",
    "indeed , the smearing of the energy spectrum with respect to the cold dark matter case is of the order of the temperature of dark matter at the moment of the structure collapse . for the structure to be able to collapse ,",
    "the temperature should be much lower than @xmath47 .    in view of our principle assumption that the energy distribution of the particles changes moderately with respect to the initial one",
    ", the similarity between the initial distributions leads to a similarity of the particle energy spectra of the relaxed halo . but",
    "how can the system evolve at all , if the energies of the bulk of the particles remain almost the same ?",
    "the mechanism is the following : the particles oscillate in the potential well .",
    "initially they oscillate cophasal .",
    "then , even if energies of the particles remain constant , their phases diverge .",
    "typically , the period sharply depends on @xmath40 for the majority of potential wells . but even if the energies of the particles precisely coincide , their phases can diverge as a result of a small nonsphericalness , perturbations from the nearby structures etc . finally , the phases of the oscillations are mixed thoroughly , and each phase becomes equiprobable .",
    "this is exactly the situation , corresponding to the stationary halo .",
    "it is important to underline that the phase mixing goes on continuously , in contrast to the energy exchange , which is effective only during the first short stage of violent relaxation .",
    "finally , the halo collapse forms a stationary potential well @xmath48 , where @xmath9 does not depend on time",
    ". each particle can be characterized by its specific angular momentum @xmath49|$ ] and maximum radius @xmath50 from the center the particle can reach .",
    "radius @xmath50 is one - to - one bound with the specific particle energy by evident relationship @xmath51 .",
    "we may consider the halo particle distribution function over @xmath50 .",
    "@xmath52    if the energy evolution of the halo is moderate , @xmath53 has a very peculiar appearance .",
    "indeed , the potential well of the collapsed halo is much deeper than the initial one .",
    "an initial perturbation had @xmath54 , as we could see from eqn .",
    "[ 15a4]-[15a5 ] , while a formed galactic halo always has @xmath55 .",
    "for instance , a navarro - frenk - white halo has @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "accepting for the milky way @xmath57 , @xmath58  kpc @xcite , we obtain @xmath59 .",
    "meanwhile , escape speed near the solar system undoubtedly exceeds @xmath60  km / s @xcite and may in principle be much larger ( @xmath61  km / s or even higher @xcite ) .",
    "it means that @xmath62 for the milky way and should be even higher for less massive systems .",
    "the specific energies of the particles bound in such a well may in principle lie between @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) and @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "however , if we accept _ principle assumption _ ( [ 15a1 ] ) , the real energy range occupied by particles is narrower .",
    "indeed , as we could see , the particles are strongly concentrated towards @xmath63 in any reasonable initial perturbation , and if we consider profile @xmath38 as a good approximation of real initial perturbations , we saw that the energies of all the particles fall in @xmath67 $ ] ( see fig .",
    "[ 15fig1 ] ) .",
    "if assumption ( [ 15a1 ] ) is true , it suggests that the majority of the particles still concentrate near @xmath63 : the energy exchange of the particles during the relaxation is more or less a stochastic process , while the total energy of the system should conserve .",
    "thus the narrowness of the initial energy distribution , the relative smallness of the energy evolution , and the fact that the final potential well is much deeper , than the initial one , together result in crowding of the particle apocentre distances @xmath50 near @xmath68 .",
    "however , a much more important for us consequence of assumption ( [ 15a1 ] ) is that the halo contains almost not at all particles with energies less than @xmath69 .",
    "radius @xmath50 , corresponding to @xmath70 , depends on the density profile .",
    "however , it a fortiori exceeds .",
    "n - body simulations show that the orbits of the majority of the particles are rather prolate @xcite , and in this case the influence of the angular momentum on @xmath50 is negligible",
    ". however , even in the worse case of circular orbit , @xmath50 of a particle can not be more than two times smaller than one for a radially moving particle with the same energy . ]",
    "@xmath71 , which corresponds to the gravitational field of a point mass @xmath72 ; for a high - concentrated nfw halo @xmath73 corresponds to @xmath74 .",
    "since condition ( [ 15a1 ] ) states that a halo contains only a few particles with @xmath75 , it means that the halo contains only a few particles with @xmath76 $ ] .",
    "actually , a number of particles with @xmath77 should also be relatively small , since initial distribution @xmath38 contains only a few particles with @xmath78 .",
    "we may conclude that distribution function @xmath53 has a steep maximum near @xmath79 and that it is almost equal to zero when @xmath80 .",
    "the later property is the most important for us .",
    "though the fraction of particles with @xmath81 is small , the region @xmath82 is quite large ( @xmath83-@xmath84  kpc for our galaxy ) and contains a very significant fraction of the galaxy mass .",
    "it means that the dominant contribution into the dark matter profile in the halo center is given by particles that come there from the outside , i.e. that have apocenter distances @xmath50 significantly larger than the radius of the region under discussion .",
    "hereafter we will consider even smaller area around the halo center , @xmath85 , where we thus have @xmath86 for almost all the particles . on the other hand ,",
    "this area is still quite large ( @xmath87  kpc for the milky way galaxy ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath88 corresponds to the radius where a nfw halo has @xmath89 ; consequently , we may expect that if a halo has a core , its radius is smaller than the radius of the area under consideration .",
    "as we will see , if the central profile is created by particles with @xmath86 , the dark matter density profile is quite universal , does not depend on the detailed properties of distribution @xmath53 and is close to the einasto profile with @xmath90 .",
    "we can easily find the density distribution in the center of the halo , created by the particles coming to this region from the outside , using the method offered in @xcite .",
    "let us single out the particles with a certain @xmath50 .",
    "we denote their total mass by @xmath21 .",
    "n - body simulations @xcite suggest that the distribution over tangential velocities is close , but do not coincide with gaussian . according to these results , we assume for simplicity that specific angular momentum @xmath91 $ ] of the particles has gaussian distribution @xmath92 here @xmath93 is the width of the distribution ; generally speaking ,",
    "@xmath94 is a function of @xmath50 .",
    "as we could see , the majority of the particles have @xmath95 , and so only those with small @xmath96 can penetrate into the area of our interest @xmath97 .",
    "so the distribution in the halo center is mainly determined by the behavior of ( [ 15a7 ] ) when @xmath98 .",
    "thus our calculation is not very sensitive to the assumption of gaussian distribution : any other distribution with the same behavior at @xmath99 would give a similar result .",
    "a particle moving in gravitational field @xmath48 has two integrals of motion : @xmath96 and @xmath100 .",
    "the radial velocity of the particle is equal to @xmath101 we introduce the maximum angular momentum of a particle wherewith it can reach radius @xmath10 @xmath102 then ( [ 15a8 ] ) may be rewritten as @xmath103 a particle having maximal radius @xmath50 and minimal radius @xmath104 contributes into the halo density on all the interval @xmath105 $ ] . the contribution of a single particle of mass @xmath21 on an interval @xmath39 is proportional to the time the particle passes on this interval @xcite . @xmath106 here @xmath107 is the half - period of the particle , i.e. the time it takes for the particle to fall from its maximal radius to the minimal one @xmath108 @xmath109 is , generally speaking , a function of @xmath50 and @xmath96 .",
    "we can obtain the density distribution from ( [ 15a11 ] ) , substituting there ( [ 15a10 ] ) instead of @xmath110 and @xmath111 instead of @xmath35 : @xmath112 in order to find the density distribution produced by all the particles of the halo with a certain @xmath50 , we should integrate ( [ 15a13 ] ) over distribution ( [ 15a7 ] ) .",
    "@xmath113 this is the exact solution ; we can significantly simplify it , however , if we take into account that @xmath109 is in general a very weak function of @xmath96 , especially for small @xmath96 , since @xmath109 has an extremum at @xmath114 . as we see in fig .",
    "[ 15fig2 ] , @xmath115 differs from @xmath116 on no more , than @xmath117 , for any reasonable potential , if @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is the angular momentum corresponding to the circular orbit .",
    "only particles with small @xmath96 can reach the central region under consideration : consequently , we may approximate @xmath107 by @xmath120 : then we can take the integral in ( [ 15a14 ] ) @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the dawson function @xmath123 .",
    "of course , all particles in a real halo have some distribution over @xmath50 : @xmath124 . in order to take it into account",
    ", we should substitute @xmath125 instead of @xmath21 to ( [ 15a15 ] ) and integrate the result over @xmath50 .",
    "moreover , equation ( [ 15a15 ] ) can be significantly simplified in the central part of the halo .",
    "first of all , gravitational potential of the centre of the halo , @xmath126 , is finite for any reasonable halo profile ( otherwise the annihilation signal , produced by the halo , would be infinite , being proportional to @xmath127 )",
    ". then we may rewrite ( [ 15a9 ] ) as @xmath128 the two last factors may be neglected in the center of the halo , and we can use approximations @xmath129 , @xmath130 .",
    "so the total density distribution in the central part is @xmath131 we can simplify this equation with the help of the following reasoning .",
    "as we could see , @xmath53 is almost equal to zero for small @xmath50 .",
    "moreover , the formed halo is dominated by the particles with @xmath95 .",
    "it means that the main contribution to the integral in ( [ 15a18 ] ) is given by the part , where @xmath64 , roughly speaking , by @xmath132 .",
    "as we could see , function @xmath53 sharply depends on @xmath50 at this interval . on the contrary ,",
    "@xmath133 should not change much on interval @xmath134 $ ] : @xmath133 is widely believed to be a power - law dependence with the index between @xmath135 and @xmath136 @xcite .",
    "@xmath137 changes even slower : for instance , @xmath138 for the nfw profile with @xmath139 .",
    "moreover , @xmath122 is a finite and not very sharp function if its argument . comparing this with the sharp behavior of @xmath53",
    ", we may neglect the weak dependence of the argument of function @xmath122 in ( [ 15a18 ] ) on @xmath50 and substitute there some value , averaged over the halo @xmath140 then we can rewrite ( [ 15a18 ] ) and obtain the final result : @xmath141 since @xmath142 , when @xmath143 , @xmath144 is the central density of the halo . as we can see , it is always finite . at the same time , the shape of the density profile depends on the only parameter @xmath145 .",
    "@xmath145 defines the radius at which rather a shallow central region of the density profile transforms into a much steeper outer part .",
    "so is actually the core radius of profile ( [ 15a20 ] ) .    in deriving ( [ 15a20 ] ) ,",
    "we used several times the fact that @xmath86 .",
    "this raises the question : for what @xmath146 is equation ( [ 15a20 ] ) still valid ? in order to check this , we solved numerically exact equation ( [ 15a14 ] ) on condition ( [ 15a7 ] ) and for distribution @xmath147 .",
    "since our approximation @xmath148 is the least acceptable for the particles with high angular momentum , we used the maximal possible value for @xmath149 .",
    "it is apparent that @xmath150 can not substantially exceed this estimation : otherwise a significant part of the dark matter would not be gravitationally bound in the halo .",
    "@xmath48 appears in expression ( [ 15a14 ] ) , and we need to write out equation @xmath151 in order to close the task .",
    "the exact density profile ( dashed line ) and profile ( [ 15a20 ] ) with the same @xmath152 ( solid line ) are represented in fig .",
    "[ 15fig3 ] .",
    "we see that ( [ 15a20 ] ) well approximates the exact solution up to @xmath153 .",
    "so ( [ 15a20 ] ) can be valid in quite a large area around the halo centre .",
    "fig .  [ 15fig4 ] represents density profile ( [ 15a20 ] ) for @xmath154 . for comparison , einasto profile with @xmath155 and @xmath156",
    "is also plotted .",
    "as we can see , the profiles are quite similar , i.e. ( [ 15a20 ] ) has a core and is close to einasto profile with @xmath155 , which , in its turn , well fits observational dark matter profiles of galaxies @xcite .",
    "so profile ( [ 15a20 ] ) is in agreement with observational data for , at least , some types of galaxies , but clearly disagrees with n - body simulations and observational data for galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "it suggests that the violent relaxation takes place in galaxy clusters but does not occur in galaxies .",
    "there can be various plausible explanations for it : baryon influence , warmth of the dark matter etc .",
    "however , the cause may be much simpler : galaxy clusters have low concentrations @xmath157 .",
    "condition ( [ 15a1 ] ) is very strict for an object with @xmath158 ( the energy of the majority of the particles should not change on more that @xmath159% ) and unsatisfiable for @xmath160 .",
    "galaxies have significantly higher @xmath12 : @xmath161 for massive galaxies and probably even higher for dwarf objects .",
    "so in order to be violent , the relaxation should change the energies of a significant part of the particles on @xmath162% in the case of galaxy clusters and at least five times in the case of galaxies .",
    "consequently , the relaxation may be violent enough to form cusps in galaxy clusters , but moderate in galaxies .",
    "we can now specify the condition of feasibility of our _ principle assumption _ : a moderate energy evolution of the system during the halo formation .",
    "we are interested in the density profile in the very center of the halo ( @xmath163 , where @xmath145 is the core radius ) .",
    "we can divide all the particles of the halo into two groups :      both the groups give some yield into the density profile of the central region .",
    "our consideration ( in particular , the derivation of equation ( [ 15a20 ] ) ) shows that the contribution of group 2 is always einasto - like with small einasto index ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "so , in order to ascertain that the total density profile of the central part of the halo is close to ( [ 15a20 ] ) , we only need the contribution of group 1 to be small .",
    "this requirement asserts automatically , if the energy exchange between the dark matter particles is moderate in sense ( [ 15a1 ] ) .",
    "we would like to summarize the main conclusions of this article .",
    "first , if the halo relaxation is moderate , the density profile in the central part of a formed halo describes by equation ( [ 15a20 ] ) , i.e. is einasto - like with small einasto index ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "the profile is quite universal and weakly depends on the shape of the initial perturbation .",
    "this is a result of the fact that the potential well of the formed halo is much deeper than that of the initial perturbation . as a result",
    ", quite a large area builds up in the centre of the halo , where the particles do not reside , but just come there from the outside : their apoapsides lie outside of the area . in order that the orbit of a particle entirely lie within the area , the particle energy should be dramatically decreased with respect to the initial value .",
    "such a process is always hampered in a dissipationless system , and hence the particles , coming to the central area from the outside , dominate there and form einasto - like universal density profile ( [ 15a20 ] ) .",
    "the shape of the profile is totally determined by single parameter @xmath145 ( [ 15a19 ] ) , which can be considered as the core radius .    financial support by bundesministerium fr bildung und forschung through desy - pt , grant 05a11ipa , is gratefully acknowledged .",
