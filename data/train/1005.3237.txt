    "superposition of waves is one of the fundamental concepts in the subject matters of waves @xcite and optics @xcite .",
    "it allows the study and explanation of interference patterns in optics , which is one of the most beautiful physical phenomenon .",
    "futhermore , it allows physicists to explain many interesting sound phenomena like beat phenomenon , which is a slow variation in the intensity of sound when we add two waves of sligthly different frequencies .",
    "the beat phenomenon is used by musicians in tunin theirs musical instruments @xcite , it is caused by the amplitude modulation effect produced by superposing waves of sligthly different frequencies .",
    "the conceptual foundation in which is based the study of these phenomena is the principle of superposition , which rougly speaking state , in the case of waves , that the resultant of adding @xmath0 waves is the sum of the individual waves .",
    "when this subject is taught in the beginning years of undergraduate physics or engineering courses@xcite , the analysis usually is carried out by summing only two waves as follows : @xmath1    if the waves are in phase ( i. e. @xmath2 ) and with the same amplitude , i.e. @xmath3 ( and observed at some fixed point ) , we can express the result as the multiplication of two sinusoidal waves as follows @xcite : @xmath4 if the two frequencies are rather similar , that is when : @xmath5 then , it is stated in many texbooks that equation ( [ two - waves ] ) represents a wave that oscillates at frequency @xmath6 and whose intensity increase and decrease at the beating frequency @xmath7 .",
    "in fact , it is common to write equation ( [ two - waves ] ) in the following way : @xmath8 where @xmath9 .",
    "equation ( [ two - waves-2 ] ) is interpreted as a wave that oscillates at the high frequency @xmath6 multiplied by a slowly variable amplitude @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , most texbooks agree that equation ( [ two - waves-2 ] ) clearly shows that the sum of two waves of almost equal frequency produces the phenomenon of amplitude modulation .",
    "accordingly , texbooks reproduce the plot of equation ( [ two - waves ] ) when @xmath11",
    ". however , in almost all textbooks , nothing is mentioned about the case when equation ( [ approx1 ] ) is not fulfilled .",
    "futhermore , maybe because to sum @xmath0 waves usually is carried out using complex functions , the next step which consist in the task of summing @xmath0 waves is not done in the beginning courses .    in most universities ,",
    "this next step in the study of superposition of waves ( i. e. suming @xmath0 waves for @xmath12 ) arrives with the course called oscillation and waves .",
    "then , representing waves as complex functions ( i.e. @xmath13 ) it is possible to obtain the following analitycal expression for the sum of @xmath0 waves of equal succesive phase diference @xmath14 @xcite : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the last frequency of the sequence and @xmath17 is the first . in general , the @xmath18 frequency can be obtaining by summig @xmath19 times @xmath14 to the wave with frequency @xmath17 , that is : @xmath20    to deduce equation ( [ suma - seno ] ) , the textbook s authors sum the geometric progression @xmath21 , where @xmath22 , see pages @xmath23 and @xmath24 in reference @xcite or page @xmath25 in reference @xcite .",
    "it is worth to mention that another way to arrive to equation ( [ suma - seno ] ) is by using the phasor method @xcite .",
    "also , it is important to highly that in the same way that occur with equation ( [ two - waves ] ) most textbooks usually plot equation ( [ suma - seno ] ) when @xmath26 which implies ( for @xmath0 not so high ) : @xmath27 equation ( [ approx - n ] ) is pretty similar approximation than equation ( [ approx1 ] ) . both plots , that of equations ( [ two - waves ] ) and ( [ suma - seno ] ) , are practically the same when conditions given by equations ( [ approx1 ] ) and ( [ approx - n ] ) are fulfilled .",
    "the oscillations in both situations are similar , and it is taken for granted that the plot of equation ( [ suma - seno ] ) oscillates at frequency @xmath28 with the envelope oscillating at frequency @xmath29 .    to summarize , almost all texbooks on the subject matter of waves @xcite and optics @xcite agree that when two ( or @xmath0 ) waves of sligthly different frequencies are superposed the most prominent observed effect is the _",
    "amplitude modulation_. almost all of them does not mention any thing about _ phase variation or modulation_.    because of being such an important and fundamental concept , the study of the superposition of waves is of high importance and deserves its study since the beginning of the syllabus to make the most of learning .",
    "therefore , it would be convenient to find a way to introduce the study of these concepts in full details since the beginning .",
    "in particular , as probably many students does not know the subject of complex numbers , it would be convenient to present at this stage the superposition of @xmath0 waves , when @xmath12 , without the use of complex functions .",
    "on the other hand , from the point of wiew of physical education research ( per ) there is the goal to present new conceptual ways to approach the teaching of relevant physical concepts .",
    "then , reaching this goal is one of the most important learning steps that a teacher can focuses on .",
    "it is worth to emphazise that one of the fundamental goals of the per s field is to discover new and imaginative ways of teaching physics .",
    "part of this goal could be accomplished by finding easier conceptual and mathematical ways to solve model problems .    in this work ,",
    "we present a method to sum @xmath0 waves in a simple conceptual way ; just by using the trick , usually attributed to gauss , of arranging numbers by pairs to sum them .",
    "this is a quite simple conceptual method that could be taught to any student with only basic knowledge on trigonometric identities and , of course , it could be taught to more advanced students .",
    "also , we analyze this superposition in other settings different to the usual restriction of @xmath30 . we have found that the sum of @xmath0 waves is more richer and complex phenomenon than that presented in some texbooks .",
    "the most important discovery of this work is that _ we found that together with an amplitude modulation there exist a phase modulation when we superpose two or more waves of slightly different frequencies_. it is worth to highly this result because it could have important practical implications .",
    "furthermore , this approach to study the superposition of waves allows to introduce an historical account in teaching , both to increase the student interest and to show the problems associated with the history of scientific facts , in this case the problem associated with who ( and how ) discovered the procedure to sum an arithmetic sequence .",
    "also , there is an interesting question in the work done by raleigh that we will draw at the end of subsection 3 a. there have been many advocates about the convenience of treating problems of historical science facts in the classroom to enhance the grasp of something that is complicated or difficult to understand , see for instance the the recent published review by teixeira , et .",
    "@xcite , the illuminating works of m. a. b. whitaker @xcite and see , also , reference @xcite .",
    "whether apocryphal or not it is well known the story of gauss s method to sum an arithmetic sequence of numbers @xcite ( or alcuin of york method @xcite or archimedes @xcite ) . the story and its weakness and drawbacks are well summarized in the article by brian hayes @xcite .",
    "when gauss was a child his teacher gave all the students the task of summing an arithmetic progression @xcite ; in order to be explicit we suppose here that the arithmetic sequence was the first one hundred numbers .",
    "it is said that using his great talent gauss did nt make the procedure of adding one number to the other , instead he grouped together the numbers in pairs and found that the sum of a pair of numbers was the same for numbers located at equidistan distance from the extrem , that is @xmath31=@xmath32=@xmath33=@xmath34=@xmath35=@xmath36 .",
    "then , the sum is @xmath37 times @xmath38 .",
    "it is worth to mention that the difference between the grouped numbers is lowered by two , given a sucession of odd numbers , that is @xmath39 @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath34 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 .",
    "also , you can choose anhother sequence and apply the same rule .",
    "for example , the sequence @xmath44,@xmath34 @xmath45 , and group it in the same way @xmath46 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath47 even you can use the same procedure to sum distances ; this is not a surprise if we consider that to every real number @xmath48 correspond a distance given by the absolute value @xmath49 .    more generally , an arithmetic sequence is a set of numbers such that each of them is obtained by summing to the previous number a constant , say @xmath14 .",
    "for example , the set @xmath50 is an arithmetic progresion with constant @xmath51 , which has as a first number @xmath52 and as a last number @xmath38 .",
    "an arbitrary term of the arithmetic sequence can be calculated as follows : if @xmath53 is the first term then the secon term @xmath54 is : @xmath55 the third term can be written as : @xmath56 therefore , the @xmath57 term of the arithmetic sequence is given by : @xmath58    as was stated above , an arithmetic sequence has the property that the sum of two numbers , which are at the same distance ( equidistant ) repectively from its nearest extrem in the sequence , is equal . to prove this ,",
    "suppose that @xmath59 is the first number of the sequence and @xmath60 the last number , then if @xmath61 is the number located at the @xmath57 point from the first and @xmath62 is the number located at the @xmath57 point from the last then : @xmath63 therefore @xmath64    equation ( [ arithmetic - equality ] ) shows that the sum of two elements in the arithmetic sequence that are located at equidistant points from the extrems ( i. e. one of them from the first number in the sequence and the other from the last ) is the same .    on the other hand",
    ", it is worth to notice that equation ( [ n - th ] ) is the same equation ( [ omega - n ] ) ( and is the same that equation ( [ condition - arithmetic ] ) below ) , this will allow us to think about the sum of @xmath0 waves as representing a superposition of an arithmetic sequence of frequencies and to use the properties of this kind of sequences , in particular the property given by equation ( [ arithmetic - equality ] ) , to sum them . this way of thinking contrast with that of textbook s authors who used to think about the sum of @xmath0 waves in terms of geometric sequences .",
    "the historical problem about who was the first person who discovered the trick to sum an arithmetic sequence is explained by haynes in references @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this historical sucess can be used to show students the problems to exactly determine some historical facts and to increase their understanding of the nature of science @xcite .",
    "it is notable that many people really know that the trick was found by gaus , but few people know that such trick was published before ( in books ) by at least two people : alcuin of york and archimedes @xcite .",
    "as was stated above , when we add two waves which have slightly different frequencies their superposition produces an amplitude - modulated wave . based on the superposition principle , the sum of two or more waves is a wave too , which satisfaces the wave equation .",
    "the magnitude of the wave sum at any space point and at some time depends on the phase value of every wave component .",
    "that is , the wave s phase is a function of both the space and time .    in this section",
    "we are going to study the case where we superpose @xmath0 waves ( with @xmath0 an even number ) with the same phase constant , same amplitude and different frequencies at a fixed point @xmath61 .",
    "we consider an interval of frequencies @xmath65 and make a partition of the interval in an even number between , say , @xmath17 to @xmath66 , i. e. @xmath67 .",
    "that is , we have : @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the angular frequency of the @xmath57 wave , @xmath70 is the wave number , and @xmath71 is the initial phase constant . for the sake of simplicity we are going to consider the case where the waves have the same initial phase constant . also , as we are interested in analyzing the case where the waves are superposed at some fixed point , without loss of generality we can set @xmath72 .",
    "therefore equation ( [ suma ] ) reduces to :    @xmath73    we consider the case when the upper limit in the sum , i.e. @xmath0 , is an even number . also , we make the partition of the @xmath65 by adding a @xmath14 to the next frequency in the sequence , that is",
    ", we have : @xmath74    therefore , if we compare equation ( [ condition - arithmetic ] ) with equation ( [ n - th ] ) we conclude that the set of frequencies form an arithmetic sequence .",
    "therefore , in order to be able to use gauss method , we group the sum given in equation ( [ sumax0 ] ) by pairs as follows :    @xmath75+\\left[\\cos(\\omega_{99}t)+\\cos(\\omega_2t)\\right]+\\cdots+      \\left[\\cos(\\omega_{51}t)+\\cos(\\omega_{50}t)\\right]\\bigg\\}.\\label{groupingsum}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    now , using the following trigonometric identity @xmath76 we can rewrite the sum of the grouped cosine functios in equation ( [ groupingsum ] ) as the product of two cosines functions .",
    "then , by substituting equation ( [ trigoidentity ] ) in equation ( [ groupingsum ] ) we have : @xmath77 + \\nonumber\\\\   & & \\left[2\\cos\\left(\\frac{(\\omega_{99}+\\omega_2)t}{2}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{(\\omega_{99}-\\omega_2)t}{2}\\right)\\right]+\\cdots\\nonumber\\\\   & + & \\left[2\\cos\\left(\\frac{(\\omega_{51}+\\omega_{50})t}{2}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{(\\omega_{51}-\\omega_{50})t}{2}\\right)\\right]\\bigg\\}.\\label{substrigo}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now , as by equation ( [ condition - arithmetic ] ) @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and so on , therefore @xmath80 , then @xmath81 so , we can factorize the cosine of the frequencies sum in equation ( [ substrigo ] ) as follows : @xmath82 on the other hand , by equation ( [ condition - arithmetic ] ) , we have @xmath83 . then , the equation ( [ sum - factorizado ] ) can be written as : @xmath84    we can still carry out a further step and group together by pairs the cosine functions that are inside the braces of equation ( [ sum - factoriz - delta ] ) . by applying equation ( [ trigoidentity ] ) , this will produce twenty five factors with the common factor @xmath85 which can be factorized .",
    "you can make additional steps by grouping by pairs the rest of the cosine fucntions , and you can follow this procedure until you arrive to a short expression .",
    "we left this as an exercise to the students . to show how the procedure works in full details , in the next subsection we carry out all the steps in the case where we superpose ten waves .",
    "in this subsubsection we are going to study the case of the superposition of ten waves . in this case",
    "the arithmetic sequence is @xmath86 .",
    "the total superposition will be , where we have grouped together the cosines funcions by pairs in a convenient way :    @xmath87+\\left[\\cos(\\omega_{9}t)+\\cos(\\omega_{2}t)\\right]+\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\left[\\cos(\\omega_{8}t)+\\cos(\\omega_{3}t)\\right]+\\left[\\cos(\\omega_{7}t)+\\cos(\\omega_{4}t)\\right]\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\left[\\cos(\\omega_{6}t)+\\cos(\\omega_{5}t)\\right]\\bigg\\}.\\label{}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    therefore the total sum , as @xmath88 and @xmath89 , is : @xmath90\\bigg\\{\\cos\\left[\\frac{9\\delta\\omega t}{2}\\right]+      \\cos\\left[\\frac{7\\delta\\omega t}{2}\\right]+\\nonumber\\\\      & & \\cos\\left[\\frac{5\\delta\\omega t}{2}\\right ]      + \\cos\\left[\\frac{3\\delta\\omega t}{2}\\right]+\\cos\\left[\\frac{\\delta\\omega t}{2}\\right]\\bigg\\}.\\label{10-sum - factory}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the next step is to group together by pairs the cosine functions that are inside the braces of equation ( [ 10-sum - factory ] ) and to use the trigonometric identity given by equation ( [ trigoidentity ] ) as follows :    @xmath91 + \\left[\\cos\\left(\\frac{7\\delta\\omega t}{2}\\right)+\\cos\\left(\\frac{3\\delta\\omega t}{2}\\right)\\right]+ \\cos\\left(\\frac{5\\delta\\omega t}{2}\\right )   \\bigg\\}=\\nonumber\\\\ \\bigg\\{2\\cos\\left(\\frac{5\\delta\\omega t}{2}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{4\\delta\\omega t}{2 } \\right)+2\\cos\\left(\\frac{5\\delta\\omega t}{2}\\right ) \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\delta\\omega t}{2}\\right)+ \\cos\\left(\\frac{5\\delta\\omega t}{2}\\right)\\bigg\\}=\\nonumber\\\\ \\cos\\left(\\frac{5\\delta\\omega t}{2}\\right)\\bigg\\{2\\left[\\cos\\left(2\\delta\\omega t\\right)+\\cos\\left(\\delta\\omega t\\right)\\right]+1\\bigg\\}= \\cos\\left(\\frac{5\\delta\\omega t}{2}\\right ) \\bigg\\{4\\cos\\left(\\frac{3\\delta\\omega t}{2 } \\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\delta\\omega t}{2}\\right)+1\\bigg\\}.\\label{total - factory1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]        substituting equation ( [ total - factory1 ] ) into equation ( [ 10-sum - factory ] ) we arrive to :    @xmath92\\cos\\left(\\frac{5\\delta\\omega t}{2 } \\right )      \\times\\bigg\\{4\\cos\\left(\\frac{3\\delta\\omega t}{2 } \\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\delta\\omega t}{2}\\right)+1\\bigg\\}.\\label{final - sum}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    equation ( [ final - sum ] ) has , like equation ( [ suma - seno ] ) , a cosine term with an argument that oscillates at the mean frequency @xmath93 . the plot of equation ( [ final - sum ] ) when @xmath30 is the same as the plot of equation ( [ suma - seno ] ) under similar condition",
    ". in this case ,",
    "that is when equation ( [ delta - approx ] ) is fulfilled , the function seem effectively to oscillate at the mean frequency @xmath94 .",
    "however , when we plot equation ( [ final - sum ] ) togheter with the cosine function that oscilates at the mean frequency @xmath95 we find that there is a phase delay each time that there is a destructive interference .",
    "whe show this in figure 1 , where we plot equation ( [ final - sum ] ) and also we have plotted the cosine function that oscillates at the mean frequency , i. e. @xmath96 .",
    "the plot clearly shows that there is a phase delay between the superposition of waves given by equation ( [ final - sum ] ) and the @xmath96 function . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this phase delay was not previously noticed or reported .",
    "also , _ it is worth to mention that the same phase delay is observed if we add two , ten or more waves_. we will give a probable explanation of this effect in the last part of this subsubsection .",
    "previously , we are going to examine equation ( [ final - sum ] ) in a different setting .",
    "on the other hand , we can explore the effects produced by different conditions on the superposition of waves .",
    "in particular , we can focuses in the condition given by : @xmath97    as @xmath98 and @xmath99 , then condition given by equation ( [ conditiongg ] ) implies :    @xmath100    in figure 2 we plot equation ( [ final - sum ] ) when condition given by equation ( [ conditiongg ] ) is fulfilled . in this case",
    "it is clear that the wave sum does not oscillates at the mean frequency @xmath101 , this is show in figure 2 where we plot also the function @xmath102 .",
    "it is easy to see that the wave sum oscillates at a frequency similar to @xmath103 ; however , there are deviations from @xmath102 which strongly suggest that this plot shows a frequency or phase modulation .",
    "this could explain the phase delay show in figure 1 which then could be produced by a phase modulation effect .",
    "to state it clearly : _ together with an amplitude modulation , in the superposition of waves with similar frequencies , it is probable that there is also a phase modulation . which in the case of figure 1 it is expressed by a phase delay_.    to show that this is effectively the case , let us recall that a phase modulated signal @xmath104 is represented by the following equation , see problem 6.30 in crawford s book @xcite : @xmath105}. \\label{ph - equation}\\ ] ]    using basic trigonometric identities , equation ( [ ph - equation ] ) can be rewritten in the following form : @xmath106 where @xmath107 .",
    "now , if we consider the case where @xmath108 then @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "therefore , equation ( [ ph - equ - expan ] ) gives :    @xmath111    equation ( [ fm - equ - expan2 ] ) resembles equation ( [ two - waves ] ) , they are similar in the sence that both are the product of two sinusoidal functions with different frequencies .",
    "so beginning with a phase modulation equation we can deduce , under certain approximations , an equation similar to equation ( [ two - waves ] ) .",
    "this allows us to conclude as higly probable that the phase delay that is observed in figure 1 is due to a phase modulation .",
    "this phase and amplitude modulation is also observed in figure 2 .",
    "the preceding paragraps give a plausible explanation of the phase delay observed in the plots .",
    "this explanation is based on an implicit similarity between equations ( [ fm - equ - expan2 ] ) and ( [ two - waves ] ) .",
    "however , if there exist a phase modulation then there has to be a way to express equation ( [ ecu1 ] ) in the form that equation ( [ ph - equation ] ) has .",
    "that is to say , we need to be able to write equation ( [ ecu1 ] ) in the following two ways :    @xmath112}. \\label{pm - way}\\ ] ]    fortunatelly , this has been done long time ago .",
    "at least since the time where john william strutt , 3rd baron rayleigh ( a british scientist ) lived . at the end of the 19 century strutt wrote a book titled the theory of sound @xcite , in this book ( see page 23 ) he wrote the sum of two waves similar to the last right part of equation ( [ pm - way ] ) .",
    "the equation that he wrote is :    @xmath113    where @xmath114 and @xmath115 where @xmath59 and @xmath116 are the amplitude of the two waves , @xmath117 and @xmath118 are the initial phase .",
    "this equation can be calculated using the phasor method .",
    "so chosing @xmath119 and @xmath120 whe fulfill the initial condition of our problem .",
    "additionally , we have found a book that has an equation similar to equation ( [ strutt1 ] ) @xcite .",
    "the authors of this book , rossing and fletcher @xcite , write the superposition of two waves as : @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the imaginary number , and @xmath10 and @xmath123 are similar to equations ( [ strutt2 ] ) and ( [ strutt3 ] ) respectively , see page @xmath124 in reference @xcite . notably , these authors , clearly state that the resulting vibration has `` both amplitude and phase varying slowly '' .    in conclusion",
    ", the sum of two waves can be writing in the usual form that a phase modulation equation has , that is the far rigth of equation ( [ pm - way ] ) is true .",
    "therefore , equation ( [ strutt1 ] ) ( and ( [ ross ] ) ) allow us to conclude that effectively * there is a phase modulation * - at the same time that _ there is an amplitude modulation _ - when we sum two ( or @xmath0 ) waves of nearly the same frequency .",
    "now , to finish this subsection , we will draw a historical issue about these points .",
    "it is interesting to notice that equation ( [ strutt1 ] ) was no noticed before by many texbook s authors , including famous books like that of reference @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it seems that people working in sound uses this equation as a teaching tool .",
    "then , the historical problem here is : which book and author first published equation ( [ strutt1 ] ) ?",
    ", why scientist working in the subject matters of waves and optics have no noticed this equation before ? .      instead of grouping the arithmetic sequence as we did in the the first paragrap ( fifteen row ) of section",
    "ii , we can group it by pairs as @xmath125 .",
    "that is , the difference between numbers is a constant . in this case , their sum descent by two in the interval between @xmath126 $ ] as follows : @xmath127 .",
    "then , instead of equation ( [ groupingsum ] ) we can group together by pairs the wave s sum as follows : @xmath128+\\left[\\cos(\\omega_{99}t)+\\cos(\\omega_{49}t)\\right]+\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\cdots+     \\left[\\cos(\\omega_{51}t)+\\cos(\\omega_{1}t)\\right]\\bigg\\}.\\label{groupdifferen}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now , using the trigonometric identity given by equation ( [ trigoidentity ] ) we have : @xmath129+\\nonumber\\\\      & & \\left[\\cos\\left(\\frac{(\\omega_{99}+\\omega_{49})t}{2}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{(\\omega_{99}-\\omega_{49})t}{2}\\right)\\right]+\\nonumber\\\\      & & \\cdots+ \\left[\\cos\\left(\\frac{(\\omega_{51}+\\omega_{1})t}{2}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{(\\omega_{51}-\\omega_{1})t}{2}\\right)\\right]\\bigg\\}\\label{substrigo2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    now , as @xmath130 then @xmath131 ; also we have that @xmath132 , @xmath133 , @xmath34 , @xmath134 .",
    "therefore , @xmath135 so , in equation ( [ substrigo2 ] ) we can factorize the cosines that have the same argument @xmath136 : @xmath137    in a further step , we can group by pairs cosines functions that are inside the braces in equation ( [ resta - factory ] ) in such a way that the difference between the arguments of the cosine function are equal .",
    "this will provide twenty five cosine functions , and the procedure can be followed to the step where you find the shortes expression .",
    "however , we will not carried ou this procedure , instead in the next subsection we focouses in the case where we have only ten waves .      in this subsubsection",
    "we are going to study the case of the superposition of ten waves . in this case",
    "the arithmetic sequence is @xmath86 .",
    "the total superposition will be -where we have grouped by pairs the cosines functions in a convenient way- :    @xmath138+\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\left[\\cos(\\omega_{9}t)+\\cos(\\omega_{4}t)\\right]+\\left[\\cos(\\omega_{8}t)+\\cos(\\omega_{3}t)\\right]\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\left[\\cos(\\omega_{7}t)+\\cos(\\omega_{2}t)\\right ] + \\left[\\cos(\\omega_{6}t)+\\cos(\\omega_{1}t)\\right]\\bigg\\}.\\label{}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    following the same steps of the example 1 in section ii , we arrive to the following final result :    @xmath139+\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\cos\\left[\\frac{2\\omega_1 + 5\\delta\\omega}{2}t \\right ] \\bigg\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "in this work we present the well known gauss method to sum an arithmetic secuence , but now as an useful aid to add @xmath0 waves . this method is simple , easy to apply and avoids students to use complex number and remember complex equations reported in the literature of waves .",
