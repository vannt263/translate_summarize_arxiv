    "young and massive o - type stars possess strong stellar winds .",
    "the winds are fast , with typical velocities up to 2500 km / s , and dense , with mass - loss rates @xmath0 .",
    "the driving mechanism for the mass - loss from ob stars has been identified with radiation pressure on spectral lines @xcite . however , it was pointed out early @xcite and later further investigated @xcite that the stationary solution for a line - driven wind is unstable ; small perturbation grow quickly and result in strong shocks giving rise to the production of hot gas and emitting of x - rays .",
    "x - rays from hot ob type stars were discovered by the einstein x - ray observatory @xcite .",
    "a large number of ob type stars was detected by the rosat all sky survey ( berghfer , schmitt & cassinelli 1996 ) , providing firm evidence that the x - ray emission is intrinsic for o star winds .",
    "the low resolution rosat spectrum of the o - type supergiant  was modeled by @xcite . in order to explain the apparent weakness of absorption in the spectrum",
    ", @xcite postulated that the x - rays are emitted far out in the stellar wind , at distances larger that @xmath1 , by an optically thin shell expanding at constant velocity .",
    "the emission from such shell would produce a broad rectangular box - like line .",
    "a box - like line profile is distinctly different from a skewed triangular line expected from radiation arising in the wind acceleration zone and attenuated in the wind @xcite .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the asymmetry of the line correlates with the wind opacity and density . in a more optically thick wind",
    "the lines are more blue - shifted . since atomic opacity is wavelength dependent , the lines are expected to differ in shape across the spectrum , with larger blue - shift at wavelengths where the wind opacity is higher .",
    "x - ray generation in the wind acceleration zone is predicted in the model by feldmeier , puls & pauldrach ( 1997 ) , who showed from hydrodynamic simulations that dense cool shells of gas form in deep wind regions .",
    "collisions of these shells can lead to strong shocks .",
    "x - rays originate from radiatively cooling zones behind the shock fronts .",
    "the hot x - ray emitting plasma is thermal , has a small filling factor , and is optically thin .",
    "the produced x - rays can be significantly attenuated by the overlying cool stellar wind . hence the blue - shifted lines are expected .",
    "high - resolution x - ray spectra of o - type stars were obtained for the first time by the chandra x - ray observatory @xcite .",
    "the resolved emission line profiles offered a stringent test for the theory .",
    "the analysis of the line ratios from he - like ions in  and   constrained the regions of x - ray formation relatively close to the stellar surface .",
    "the line width was measured to be less than corresponding to the maximum velocity , confirming that the line emission originates in the wind acceleration zone .",
    "line blue - shifts were also detected , indicating wind attenuation @xcite .",
    "however , the data revealed that the line blue - shifts do not change significantly for lines at different wavelengths in contrast to what was expected @xcite .",
    "moreover , the line fitting using the  standard model  of smooth homogeneous wind was not able to to reproduce the lines observed in non - magnetic single o stars unless with significantly reduced mass - loss rates ( kramer , cohen & owocki 2003 , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "there is a good reason to believe that mass - loss rates from o stars are need to be revised downwards .",
    "a plenitude of observational and theoretical evidence indicates the clumped inhomogeneous nature of o star winds ( * ? ? ?",
    "* bouret , lanz & hillier 2005 , fullerton , massa & prinja 2006 ) .",
    "the empirical mass - loss rates of wr stars are generally reduced by factors of a few in a clumped wind @xcite , but it is still not known by how much exactly in case of o stars @xcite .",
    "radiative transfer in a stochastic medium is distinctly different from the transfer in a smooth medium @xcite , especially when the clumps are not necessarily optically thin .",
    "therefore , it is inconsistent to apply the smooth - wind formalism in order to model spectral lines in a wind where the mass - loss rate estimates are based on the assumption of wind clumping .",
    "the transport of x - rays in a clumped stellar wind was studied analytically and numerically by feldmeier , oskinova & hamann ( 2003 ) and oskinova , feldmeier & hamann ( 2004 ) , respectively .",
    "motivated by the prediction of hydrodynamic simulations that the cool - wind clumps are radially compressed , we considered the case of anisotropic wind opacity , where the optical thickness of a clump depends on its orientation",
    ". @xcite showed and explained that the assumption of flattened wind clumps leads to nearly symmetric and blueshifted line shapes . a corresponding 2d stochastic wind model developed in @xcite demonstrated that clumping effectively reduces the wind opacity and its wavelength dependence .",
    "the latter effect leads to a similarity of the shapes of all x - ray lines .",
    "recently , @xcite used a similar model , but restricted to the specific case of isotropic clumps . in the latter model a symmetric line profile results only when the mean separation between optically thick clumps is quite large , of the order of a few stellar radii .",
    "the main objective of the present paper is to compare , for the first time , the model lines from clumped winds with the lines observed in the x - ray spectra of the prominent single non - magnetic o stars , , , and .",
    "our basic strategy is to adopt the best available parameters for the stars and their winds , compute on their basis the model line profiles , and compare them with the observation .",
    "thus we do not infer the model parameters from the line fitting , but instead answer the question whether the observed lines can be described in the framework of the x - ray transport in stochastic media .",
    "we utilize the most recent empirical mass - loss rates of our sample stars , and evaluate the mass - absorption coefficient in the wind using state - of - the - art non - lte atmosphere code .",
    "observed x - ray spectra are analyzed to infer the zone of x - ray emission and the wind velocity field .",
    "the only remaining free parameter of our model is the average time interval between subsequent clumps passing the same point in the stellar wind . for this parameter",
    "we adopt the wind flow time , @xmath2 .",
    "with _ all _ model parameters defined , we model each line and compare it with the observation",

    "the effect of wind clumping on the lines profiles is most pronounced when clumps are optically thick for the incident radiation @xcite .",

    ". a comparison of fluxes between modeled and observed lines would be a very sensitive tool .",
    "the influence of the velocity field on model line profiles is illustrated in fig.[fig : bet ] .",
    "hydrodynamic simulations of @xcite indicate that the velocity of the hot plasma is nearly the same as the cool - wind velocity . in this paper , we approximate the velocity field as monotonic ( see @xcite for the treatment of non - monotonic velocity ) . from the width of the line profiles we infer that the x - ray emission in all four stars is originating in a region extending from about @xmath188  to @xmath189 .",
    "the corresponding radii of emission can be obtained if the velocity - law parameter @xmath139 is known .",
    "vice versa , if radii of emission are given , @xmath139 can be inferred from the line - profiles .",

    "@xcite obtained for  @xmath190 , while @xcite obtain @xmath191 and notice that different values may apply for inner and outer parts of the wind .",
    "@xmath192 was inferred from the line profile variability in  @xcite .",

    ": bet ] , the line profile changes significantly in dependence on @xmath139 .",
    "the synthetic lines for our four program stars shown in the figures were actually slightly optimized by adjusting @xmath139 within the uncertainties of previous estimates ( see figure captions ) .",
    "the optical depth in a smooth wind is given by eq.([eq : tauhz ] ) , which was employed by @xcite and @xcite to fit the line profiles observed in the x - ray spectra of  and .",
    "they have used @xmath193 as one of their four free fitting parameters .",
    "assuming @xmath194g@xmath195 for all analyzed lines in , it was shown that the best - fitting values of @xmath196 imply significantly reduced mass - loss rates , e.g. due to the wind clumping . in a clumped wind , however , the optical depth is given by eq.([eq : tint ] ) , which is more general than eq.([eq : tauhz ] ) .",
    "the latter applies only for a limiting case of numerous and _ optically thin",
    "_ clumps .",
    "little is known so far about mass , density and geometry of individual clumps .",
    "clump optical depths are likely to be different at different radii in the wind .",
    "this is reflected in our stochastic wind model , where the mass of a clump is conserved , but its radial optical depth scales as @xmath197 ( eq.[eq : taujrad ] ) .",
    "furthermore , since clump optical depth is proportional to @xmath94 , a clump can be optically thick at one wavelength and optically thin at another . as can be seen from table[tab : kappa ] , the mass absorption coefficient differs by one order of magnitude between the wavelenghts of the sixiv and the oviii line .",
    "figure[fig : pupl1 ] shows model lines of sixiv and oviii in .",
    "for the sixiv line the difference between clumped and smooth model is small , indicating that the clumps are optically thin at @xmath198(sixiv ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the model lines of oviii for smooth and clumped wind are significantly different , and , therefore , at least some fraction of the clumps are optically thick at @xmath199(oviii ) .",
    "consequently , eq.([eq : tint ] ) can be applied for the sixiv line , but can not be used for the oviii line .",
    "overall , when stellar mass - loss rates are revised down because of the wind clumping , the clumped wind radiative transfer should be applied for consistency .      as discussed in detail in @xcite , the optical depth in a clumped wind",
    "is determined by two factors .",
    "the first factor is the probability that a photon which encounters a clump is absorbed by clump material .",
    "this probability is obviously equal to one for optically thick clumps , @xmath200 , and is reduced otherwise to ( see eq.[eq : tint ] ) .",
    "the second factor is the probability that a photon propagating along the ray towards the observer does encounter a clump .",
    "when clumps are distributed randomly in the wind , this probability depends on the length of the path .",
    "the longer a photon travels through the wind , the higher is the probability that it will be intercepted by a clump .",
    "therefore , photons emitted in the part of the wind which is receding from the observer have higher probability to be absorbed .",
    "thus there are less photons in the red wing of a line reaching an observer than in the blue part .",
    "this is the basic physical reason for the blueshift of the x - ray emission line profiles .",
    "moreover , the probability that a photon does encounter a clump depends also on the clump cross - sections . approximating clumps as spheres ,",
    "the clump cross - section is the same from all directions , which is conceptually similar to the atomic cross - sections .",
    "the emergent line profiles are skewed in both cases .",
    "=    to explain the observed near - symmetry of line profiles in the framework of the smooth wind model , @xcite and @xcite suggested the reduction of mass - loss rates , which implies lower densities . when the particle number density is reduced , the photon mean free path is increased . in a clumped wind with spherical clumps ,",
    "each clump is analogous to a particle . in order for the line profile to be symmetric , the `` particle '' ( i.e.  clump ) number density",
    "must be reduced , which consequently leads to a larger photon mean free path ( i.e.  porosity length ) .",
    "this deep analogy between smooth winds on one side and clumped winds with spherical clumps on the other side explains the principal similarity between the conclusions reached in @xcite and in @xcite , namely the requirement of large mean free paths in order to produce symmetric emission line profiles .",
    "a qualitatively different behavior of the radiative transfer is achieved , however , for anisotropic opacity ( i.e.  non - spherical , oriented clumps ) , as studied in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this effect of clump geometry on emergent line profiles is demonstrated in fig.[fig : shape ] .",
    "two model lines are calculated with the the same fragmentation frequency and the same value of @xmath196 .",
    "the only difference is that in one case isotropic opacity , i.e. spherical `` ball - like '' clumps are assumed , while the other model is calculated for the anisotropic opacity in the limiting case of clumps which are flat like `` pancakes '' .",
    "figure[fig : shape ] clearly shows that in the latter case the line is non - skewed and less blueshifted than in the former case .",
    "the assumption of flat clumps was used in the present paper to model the observed line profiles .",
    "we have demonstrated that this model yields good agreement with the observed data .",
    "the effect of clumping on the wind attenuation is threefold .",
    "firstly , it reduces the wind absorption compared to the smooth - wind model , allowing for more flux to escape .",
    "secondly , it leads to a weaker dependence of the effective opacity on wavelength , making it entirely grey in the case of optically thick clumps .",
    "this prediction of similar opacity for different lines agrees well with the similarity of line profiles observed at different wavelengths .",
    "thirdly , it affects the shape of line profiles , but only in the case when effective anisotropic opacity is assumed . the radially compressed , slab - like shell fragments lead to the emergence of the symmetric , but blue - shifted lines profiles which are indeed observed .",
    "inhomogeneity of the stellar wind can reduce the mass - loss rates estimated empirically from the analysis of recombination and h@xmath13 lines .",
    "these reduced mass - loss rates should be used in conjunction with the stochastic wind radiative transfer formalism in order to consistently model x - ray emission line profiles .",
    "the radii in the wind where continuum optical depth for the x - rays is unity is below 10@xmath16 in chandra meg energy band for , , , and .",
    "stellar wind in  is almost transparent for the x - rays , consequently the emission line profiles show no effect of wind absorption .",
    "we estimate that @xmath201% of the mechanical energy of the wind of  is converted into x - ray emission .",
    "the x - ray emission lines observed in the spectra of , , and  are affected by wind absorption .",
    "this result , as well as shape of line profiles , is in agreement with the analysis of line ratios in the he - like ions .",
    "the above analysis constrains the origin of x - ray emission to the acceleration zone in the stellar wind .    summarizing ,",
    "we conclude that by using independently determined parameters as input for the model of an inhomogeneous stellar wind we are capable to reproduce the observed x - ray emission lines in o stars .",
