    "double parton collisions are a new feature of high energy hadron interactions which becomes increasingly important at high energies .",
    "the number of partons that can undergo a hard collision is in fact a fast growing function of @xmath1 and , as a consequence , when the c.m .",
    "energy is large enough , the probability of having more than one hard partonic interaction in the same inelastic event becomes sizable .",
    "double parton collisions , foreseen long ago by several authors@xcite , have been in fact observed recently by cdf@xcite .",
    "the non - perturbative input to the double parton collisions are the double parton distributions , which are independent on the parton distributions usually considered in large@xmath2 physics , since they are related directly to the two - body parton correlation of the hadron structure . in the simplified hypothesis of neglecting all correlations in fractional momenta , the inclusive double parton scattering cross section for the two parton processes @xmath3 and @xmath4 reduces nevertheless to a simplest factorized expression : @xmath5 where @xmath6 when @xmath3 and @xmath4 are indistinguishable processes and @xmath7 when they are distinguishable . @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the inclusive single scattering cross sections for producing the processes @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively and all the new information on the structure of the hadron in transverse space is summarized in the value of the scale factor @xmath0 .",
    "this simplest hypothesis has not been contradicted by the experimental evidence@xcite , whose results are in fact described with a single parameter ( the scale factor @xmath0 ) .",
    "the experimental value quoted by cdf , @xmath10 mb , is however too small to be understood in a simplest uncorrelated picture of the multi - parton distribution and indicates that correlations in transverse space play an important role@xcite .",
    "a possibility which has been considered@xcite to explain the smallness of the value of @xmath0 is to correlate the population of gluons and sea quarks with the configuration of the valence in transverse space , in such a way that the average number of gluons and sea quarks is small when the valence quarks are all close in transverse space and , on the contrary , is large when they are separated by a ( relatively ) large transverse distance .",
    "such a mechanism increases the dispersion in the number of multiple parton collisions and , as a consequence , @xmath11 ( which is proportional to that dispersion@xcite ) .",
    "the value of @xmath0 is therefore diminished with respect to the uncorrelated case .",
    "the scale factor , on the other hand , is the result of the overlap in transverse space of the matter distribution of the two interacting hadrons and a feature of the model above is that the average transverse distance of a pair of valence quarks is different as compared with the average transverse distance of a pair of gluons or sea quarks . in the model @xmath0 is therefore different for double parton scatterings involving valence quarks and for double parton scattering involving sea quarks and gluons . although the details of the model should be understood in a qualitative rather than in a quantitative sense , it is rather natural to expect different values of the scale factor in different reactions .",
    "we think therefore that it may be interesting to have an indication , even if only qualitative , on the size of the effect and , to that purpose , we work out in the present note the values of the scale factor foreseen in the model @xcite in a few cases of interest .",
    "at large energies one will be able to observe double parton collisions in various channels@xcite@xcite@xcite . in particular the production of two equal sign @xmath12 bosons , at relatively low @xmath13 , goes almost entirely through double parton collisions@xcite and is originated , to a large extent , by interactions with valence quarks . another case",
    "where double parton collisions are expected to play an important role is in the production of two @xmath14 pairs .",
    "the corresponding integrated cross section is in fact rather large , by using eq.[fact ] one may estimate that the double parton scattering cross section for producing two @xmath14 pairs is of the order of @xmath15 at the energy of the lhc .",
    "the dominant mechanism of @xmath16 production is gluon fusion and the observation of double parton collisions , in a equal sign @xmath12 boson pair production and in the production of two @xmath14 pairs , allows therefore one to compare the distribution in transverse space of valence quarks with the distribution in transverse space of gluons .    to work out the scale factor in the two cases",
    "we write the inclusive double parton scattering cross section , for the parton interactions @xmath3 and @xmath4 , as @xmath17 where @xmath18 are the double parton distributions , depending on the two fractional momenta of the partons @xmath19 and @xmath20 and on their relative transverse distance @xmath21 .",
    "the indices @xmath22 and @xmath23 refer to the different kinds of partons , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the partonic cross sections and the qcd dependence on the scale of the interaction is implicit in all quantities . in the case we are considering",
    "the dependence of @xmath26 on @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 is factorized : @xmath27 where @xmath28 are the usual parton distributions .",
    "if @xmath29 do not depend on @xmath22 and @xmath23 one obtains eq.[fact ] and the scale factor @xmath0 is universal . in general",
    "the double scattering cross section is however written as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the hadronic inclusive cross section for two partons of kind @xmath22 and @xmath23 to undergo the hard interaction @xmath3 , and @xmath32 are geometrical coefficients , with dimensions of the inverse of a cross section , depending on the various parton processes .    in the model",
    "@xcite the probability to find the proton in a given configuration , with @xmath33 gluons or sea - quarks , has the following expression :    @xmath34 { \\rm exp}\\bigg\\{-\\frac{b_d^2}{\\langle b_d^2\\rangle}\\int g(x)dx \\bigg\\ } \\label{pdistr2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath35 are the inclusive distributions of valence quarks , as a function of the momentum fraction @xmath36 , and @xmath37 is the density of valence quarks in transverse space , where the coordinates of valence quarks in transverse space @xmath38 are given by @xmath39 in the model @xmath40 , where @xmath41 represents the distribution density of the proton in coordinate space .",
    "the explicit expression used is @xmath42 where @xmath43 with @xmath44fm , the proton charge radius .    given a configuration of the valence , the average density of gluons and sea quarks in a point with transverse coordinate @xmath21 and momentum fraction @xmath45 is given by @xmath46 .",
    "the overall average number of gluons and sea quarks at a given @xmath45 ( namely after integrating on @xmath21 and on the configurations of the valence ) is @xmath47 and is identified with the inclusive distribution of gluons and sea quarks . in the same way the inclusive distributions of the valence quarks , @xmath35 , are the result of integrating over",
    "the transverse coordinates @xmath38 and of summing over all configurations of gluons and sea quarks .",
    "the dependence of the average density of gluons and sea quarks on the transverse coordinate @xmath21 is expressed by @xmath48 which is the projection on the transverse plane of a sphere of radius @xmath49 , rescaled with the factor @xmath50 , where the average @xmath51 is taken with the density @xmath37 .",
    "the average density of gluons and sea quarks and the corresponding average number ( which grows as @xmath50 ) are therefore correlated with the configuration of the valence , while all fractional momenta are uncorrelated .",
    "the model distinguishes two different kinds of partons , as far as the number and density in transverse space are concerned , the valence quarks and the sea quark and gluons . the indices @xmath22 and @xmath23 , as a consequence , can take two different values , @xmath52 and @xmath1 , and the relevant transverse densities of parton pairs to be considered are @xmath53 by using eq.[fb ] and the expression below , the matrix @xmath54 and the effective cross section are readily evaluated : @xmath55",
    "the resulting values of @xmath56 are shown in the table .",
    "the scale factor @xmath0 is plotted as a function of the c.m .",
    "energy in fig.1 and in fig.2 , corresponding to @xmath57 and @xmath58 interactions respectively , in various processes of interest : @xmath22 ) production of two equal sign @xmath12 bosons , @xmath59 ) production of a @xmath12 boson of either positive or negative sign together with two jets or @xmath60 ) with a @xmath16 pair , @xmath61 ) production of four jets , @xmath52 ) production of two @xmath16 pairs . in the case of jets",
    "the scale factor has been evaluated by using as a lower cutoff in @xmath13 the value of @xmath62 ( the scale factor is however rather insensitive to that choice ) .",
    "all the single scattering cross sections in eq.[seff ] have been computed at the lowest order in the coupling constant and by making use of the martin - roberts - stirling 1999 ( mrs99 ) parton distributions@xcite .",
    "the different results obtained for @xmath63 and @xmath64 production for @xmath57 collisions is mainly due to the different content of @xmath65 and @xmath66 quarks in the proton .",
    "a consequence is in fact the different contribution of the sea quarks in the two cases , whose distribution is sizably different in the model in comparison with the distribution in transverse space of the valence . to check the dependence on the choice of the distribution functions we have repeated the calculation by using the cteq5 parton distributions@xcite . in all cases the scale factor",
    "is not changed by more than a few percent .",
    "in fact the results for @xmath0 are rather insensitive to the choice of parton distributions , since @xmath0 is obtained by making ration of cross sections .",
    "the main qualitative feature of the results obtained is the strong difference , at tevatron energy , between final states with and without a @xmath12 boson , and the energy dependence of the scale factor , which is sizable when moving from tevatron to lhc energy in the channels containing a @xmath12 boson .    while the actual values should be considered only as indicative , the qualitative features just pointed out are likely to be of more general validity , since they are originated by the different source of initial state partons in the case of @xmath12 production , which in most cases involves valence quarks , in comparison with the other channels considered , that are mainly generated by interactions of sea quarks and gluons .",
    "the overall indication is that it is plausible to expect non minor differences in the values of @xmath0 in different processes .",
    "it is also apparent that a basic element , to understand the three dimensional structure of the proton , is a quantitative information on the correlations in transverse space of the various pairs of initial state partons and that the scale factors , of the different double parton collision processes , are the physical observables which can provide that information .",
