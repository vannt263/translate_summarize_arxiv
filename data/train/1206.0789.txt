    "obviously the signal transmission between neurons in different brain areas is not instantaneous .",
    "thus non - zero transmission times have to be taken into account as crucial quantities that influence the dynamics of individual neurons to a large extent .",

    "the analytical results are in excellent agreement with the numerical calculations .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : acflines](a ) of the previous section , the lines obtained analytically from the resonance condition ( [ eq : res3dlfin2 ] ) agree very well with the numerical results on the isi of regular spiking .",
    "however , the regions of periodic spiking fill only a part of the parameter plane .",
    "the isi approach does not allow for an analysis of bursting - type solutions .",
    "there , the time series exhibits bunched spiking patterns and thus different timescales .    therefore , we consider the autocorrelation function ( acf ) @xmath180 as an alternative tool for the analysis of the coupled system dynamics @xcite .",

    "the second largest maximum marks the best coincidence between the original and the shifted time series , and is found for @xmath188 , which characterizes the length of the repeated ( periodic or quasi - periodic ) pattern , and in case of periodic spiking equals the isi .    the result of this alternative analysis based on the acf is depicted in fig .",

    "the yellow and red areas in fig .",
    "[ fig : reslines ] that are missing in fig .",
    "[ fig : acflines](a ) .",
    "the acf allows for investigation of both periodic and quasi - periodic behavior .",
    "figure  [ fig : traj1 ] shows time series and phase space projections for bursting - type solutions . since the time series consists of repeated bunches of spikes , the mean interspike interval is no longer a good measure .",
    "this is due to two different timescales in the activator variables @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "to investigate this bursting - type behavior we use again the acf analysis .    figure  [ fig : acfx1smp](b ) displays the acf of the time series from fig .",
    "[ fig : traj1 ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig : acfx1smp](a ) the time series for the first activator @xmath54 is shown again for convenience and fig .",
    "[ fig : acfx1smp](b ) presents the acf @xmath180 .",
    "it can be seen that the acf approaches unity for the second time  after the trivial perfect correlation at @xmath189  at a displacement of @xmath190 , which equals the repetition period of the bursting pattern .",
    "the bursts can also be resolved by the acf as the fast oscillations .",
    "to conclude , the acf enables to distinguish between inter - burst and intra - burst timescales .",
    "we have investigated effects of heterogeneous time delays for mutual and self - coupling of a simple network motif that consists of two neural systems .",
    "this setup is realized by two delay - coupled elements of fitzhugh - nagumo type , which is a paradigmatic model of neural interaction .",
    "the two subsystems operate in the excitable regime , and excitation occurs due to the incoming delayed signals via both mutual and self - coupling .    at first , we have considered identical self - coupling delays and analyzed the regular periodic dynamics on the basis of the mean interspike interval . for small feedback strengths ,",
    "the system exhibits regular behavior with the period of about twice the mutual coupling delay . with increasing feedback strength , however , the self - feedback term becomes stronger and the system can perform more frequent spikes due to this additional source of excitation .",
    "this happens if the mutual coupling and self - feedback delays are in resonance . in the parameter plane of self - coupling delay and strength , the regions where the regular oscillations exist , resemble stripes emerging from the resonance with the mutual couping delays .",
    "we have provided an analytical formula for these resonance conditions and the period of the synchronized oscillations .",
    "a comparison with numerical simulations shows excellent agreement .",
    "next , we have focused on the case of non - identical self - coupling delays .",
    "we have considered two - dimensional projections of the parameter space and measured the regularity of the dynamics by the mean interspike interval as well as by the autocorrelation function .",
    "similar to the case of identical self - coupling delays , we observe synchronized periodic dynamics , if the three delay times satisfy a resonance condition .",
    "we have also derived a formula for the period of the synchronized regular dynamics , and compared the theoretical results with our numerical simulations .    finally , we have studied bursts of subsequent excitation spikes . to identify such solutions the measure of interspike intervals",
    "is not appropriate any more , and we have used the autocorrelation function as an alternative tool for the analysis of the dynamics .",
    "we have restricted our investigations to local dynamics of type - ii excitability related to a hopf bifurcation ( fitzhugh - nagumo model ) .",
    "it is also interesting to consider other models describing , for instance , type - i excitability involving a saddle - node bifurcation on an invariant cycle or physiologically oriented models such as hodgkin - huxley- or morris - lecar - like equations , but those studies are beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "another important direction for future research is to increase the number of elements .",
    "first approaches to study delayed coupling in large networks have already been reported ( see references in sec .  [",
    "sec : intro ] ) . in principle , the results of the presented work can also be applied to coupled systems of more than two elements .",
    "then one has to carefully analyze the combinatorics of the various exciting self - feedback and cross - coupling pluses based on the given network topology . in the case of networks , asymmetries in the coupling strengths can also become important , e.g. , if multiple subthreshold excitations accumulate .",
    "in addition , different coupling strengths play a crucial role in the presence of both excitatory and inhibitory connections in neural networks . in the presented study of two coupled elements , however , incoming pulses result in all - or - nothing events : if the signal is large enough , it will trigger a full - scale excitation .",
    "otherwise , only a small , subthreshold excitation is possible .",

    "the formula ( [ eq : t_b - c ] ) was derived only for @xmath11 close to unity , i.e. , close to the bifurcation point . for larger values of @xmath11 , however , a similar estimate holds .",
    "in fact , the idea is to integrate in time along the right branch of the cubic nullcline from the point @xmath191 to the point @xmath2 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : phaseplane ] ) . if @xmath11 is close to 1 , the coordinates of these points can be approximated by @xmath192 and @xmath193 . for large @xmath11",
    "this approximation is rather bad .    to improve the formula one can do the following .",
    "the @xmath194-coordinate of point @xmath195 can not exceed @xmath196 , because the cycle can not cross the fixed point @xmath197 .",
    "therefore , the maximum coordinates for @xmath195 are approximately @xmath198 .",
    "since the transition from the left branch to the right branch of the cubic nullcline happens almost instantaneously , the @xmath93-coordinate of @xmath191 could also be approximated as @xmath199 .",
    "this yields @xmath200 .    to calculate the coordinates of the point @xmath2 we proceed as follows . since the periodic trajectory in fig .",
    "[ fig : phaseplane](b ) appears to be symmetric with respect to the origin @xmath201 , the @xmath93-coordinate of @xmath2 can be obtained as @xmath202 , and hence @xmath203 .",
