    "however , the kolmogorov - obukhov analysis @xcite does not provide a rigorous mathematical definition of the `` fluctuation of scale @xmath0 '' . in the literature this is tacitly understood as fourier components with wavenumbers approximately equal to the inverse scale @xmath1 and the analysis is performed in wavenumber space .",
    "this definition meets global characteristics of the fully developed isotropic turbulence , but , being based on the fourier transform , is essentially nonlocal and therefore hardly applicable to such important properties of the fully developed turbulence as the coherent structure formation . to catch the local properties of the turbulent velocity field ,",
    "the decomposition into localized wave packets and wavelets have been performed by many authors @xcite .",
    "most of the wavelet applications to turbulence are restricted either to an analysis of the measured turbulent fields with the `` wavelet microscope '' , capable of simultaneous analysis of the same velocity field at different resolution @xcite , or to a numerical solution of the navier - stokes equations ( nse ) in the wavelet basis @xcite .",
    "the application of the continuous wavelet transform with the derivatives of the gaussian taken as basic wavelets was already used in the analytical study of the nse @xcite , in particular , in research on energy dissipation .",
    "however , at least to the authors knowledge _ the wavelet decomposition has not been yet applied to the stochastic iterative solutions of the navier - stokes equation or in the framework of the field theory approach to statistical hydrodynamics _ @xcite .",
    "our interest in extending the stochastic hydrodynamics approach by wavelet - defined random processes is stimulated by recent developments in application of the field theory and renormalization group methods to the fully developed isotropic turbulence , see e.g. @xcite for a short summary .",
    "the `` field theoretic methods '' are taken to mean the stochastic diagram technique , the functional integral representation of the characteristic functional and the renormalization group methods .",
    "the latter , being inherited from the theory of critical behavior in equilibrium phase transitions clearly demonstrates the need for a scale - dependent random measure in the field theoretic approach to turbulence .",
    "such measures , having been already in use for phenomenological studies of multifractal behavior and itermittency @xcite , have not been yet used in analytical approach of stochastic hydrodynamics .",
    "the aim of this paper is to extend the wavelet representation of the stochastic navier - stokes equations in such a way that the probability distribution of the stirring force , used to compensate the energy dissipation , is defined for the wavelet coefficients of random force ( for the scale components of forcing ) . in our description",
    "the velocity field wavelet coefficients @xmath2 attain the kolmogorov meaning of local velocity fluctuations of scale @xmath0 at a given point @xmath3 ( a particular case of the difference of two gaussians or delta - functions was considered in the literature @xcite ) . defining the random force in the space of wavelet coefficients",
    "we get an extra analytical flexibility : there are random processes in the space of wavelet coefficients with different correlation functions whose images under inverse wt coincide in the space of common random functions . tuning the random force correlation function in the space of wavelet coefficients , in stochastic hydrodynamics formalism",
    ", we get rid of loop divergences ; for a special type of narrow - band forcing the contributions to the response and the correlation functions are explicitly calculated .",
    "it is shown that the kolmogorov hypotheses , the statistical closures of moment equations , the stochastic hydrodynamics approach and the wyld diagram technique are naturally reformulated in multiscale ( wavelet ) formalism .",
    "besides , the consideration of random processes depending on scale explicitly @xmath4 gives a possibility of the perturbation expansion converging without introducing an ultra - violet ( uv ) cutoff wavenumber , and an extra contribution to the kolmogorov energy dissipation term @xmath5 .",

    "_ we review the methods of solution of the nse by the fourier decomposition and by the wavelet decomposition . in _ section 3",
    "_ the stochastic hydrodynamics approach is reformulated for the random processes explicitly depending on scale .",

    "section 4_. _ section 5 _ presents a generalized form of the kolmogorov hypotheses formulated in a multiscale framework . in _ conclusion",
    "_ we discuss some perspectives of the method .",
    "in analytical studies of the hydrodynamic turbulence the basic role is played by the navier - stokes equations : @xmath6 our consideration of hydrodynamic turbulence , based on the navier - stokes equations , assumes a fully developed homogeneous isotropic turbulence far from any boundaries .",
    "although the adequacy of the stochastic nse to fully developed turbulence still remains an open problem , a significant progress has been achieved in studying simple models , proving the kolmogorov spectrum from basic principles @xcite and calculating the anomalous scaling corrections @xcite .",
    "turbulence in an incompressible fluid considered in these settings is more frequently studied in a wavenumber space rather than in a real space .",
    "the advantage of wavenumber space is a very simple form of the laplacian  this enables to eliminate the pressure term from the nse .",
    "the price paid for this simplification is the non - locality of the fourier transform that completely hides all information related to the real space distribution of the velocity field .",
    "the discrete fourier transform used in numerical simulations also imposes periodicity on the system .",
    "the usefulness of the wavenumber representation stems from two basic reasons : the existing of fast fft algorithms and pseudospectral methods @xcite and the direct experimental interpretation of the power spectra density of velocity fluctuations @xcite . for the incompressible",
    "fluid the pressure term can be eliminated from the nse by the substitution @xmath7 in the wavenumber space representation @xmath8 both the inverse laplacian operator @xmath9 in and the incompressibility condition @xmath10 are simplified and the nse system becomes a system of integro - differential equations @xmath11",
    ", \\quad p_{ij}(\\vk )   = \\delta_{ij } - \\frac{k_i k_j}{\\vk^2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the system of equations allows for perturbative calculations , statistical closures of moment equations . , but is not local in the coordinate space and therefore is of little use when studying the effects locally produced by fluctuations .",
    "the system of equations is complete and , being correctly solved numerically , gives reliable results .",
    "this however requires taking into account a tremendous number of fourier modes , that is hardly bearable even for modern supercomputers ; alternatively certain block - averaging procedures in wavenumber space can be applied , the spectral reduction @xcite .",
    "the idea of studying turbulence using the space - scale or wavenumber - scale representation is not a new one .",
    "the band - pass filtering of the turbulent signals was used to study intermittency long ago @xcite .",
    "later the prototype of wavelet cascade model was given in @xcite .",
    "the wavelet transform ( wt ) is known to be an excellent local tool , widely used in a turbulence data analysis @xcite and numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "wt in real space , as a particular type of filtering @xcite , reveals the formation of the coherent structures @xcite and is useful to study the local energy dissipation effects related to filament formation @xcite .",
    "wt in @xmath12 space enables to enhance the idea of band - pass filtering by separating the contributions of different scales .    in this paper",
    "we use continuous wavelet transform ( cwt ) to derive the equations for the fluctuations of different scales .",
    "this analytical consideration goes along with the filtering approach @xcite , when considering moment closures for a fully developed isotropic turbulence . _",
    "the crux of our approach is the application of continuous wavelet transform in the stochastic hydrodynamics framework : the wt is applied to both the velocity field and the random force stirring the turbulence_. working in the space of wavelet coefficients , rather than in a real space of velocity fields , we can define the random stirring force , which is essentially used in rg calculations , see @xcite  in a way that allows for getting rid of loop divergences in the stochastic perturbation expansion of the velocity field statistical momenta @xcite .    for simplicity",
    "we restrict ourselves with the homogeneous isotropic turbulence and the isotropic wavelets @xmath13 . in this case , the wavelet transform of the velocity field @xmath14 , taken with respect to the basic wavelet @xmath15 , and the corresponding reconstruction formula are @xmath16 we perform the wavelet transform only in the spatial argument of the velocity field because we need the _ spatial _ resolution .",
    "using the @xmath17 norm instead of @xmath18 , we provide wavelet coefficients @xmath19 with the same @xmath20 dimension as the velocity field @xmath21 itself .",
    "the wavelet coefficients @xmath19 are referred to hereafter , as the components of the velocity field corresponding to scale @xmath22 ; @xmath23 is referred to as an analyzing function used to measure the scale components .    for practical calculations",
    "it is often convenient to express wavelet transform ( [ dcwt],[icwt ] ) in @xmath24 representation taking the fourier transform in the spatial argument . in fourier form the direct and inverse wt",
    "are : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the fourier transform of the velocity field @xmath27 ( the minkovski - like notation @xmath28 is used . ) therefore , the wavelet transform can be considered as a frequency filter that conveys the harmonics with typical wavenumbers of order @xmath29 and is localized close to point @xmath30 .    the only restriction imposed on the basic wavelet @xmath31 to make the wavelet transform invertible  the admissibility condition  is the finiteness of the normalization constant @xmath32 : @xmath33 for a real - valued basic wavelet @xmath15 we can restrict the integration to the positive frequencies only @xmath34 if the basic wavelet is also isotropic @xmath13 , we get @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the area of the unit sphere in @xmath37 .",
    "in this paper we will assume @xmath38 integration and the isotropic real wavelets .",
    "thus , the decomposition of the velocity field with respect to the basic wavelet @xmath31 takes the form @xmath39 we drop the integration limits @xmath40 hereafter . substituting the wavelet",
    "transform into the system of the component equations , we yield the system of equations for the scale components @xmath41 : @xmath42 let us derive statistical closures for the scale components .",
    "for this purpose we take eq . and",

    "doing so , we get @xmath47 applying the same procedure to the second of the equations and summing up the results at coinciding time arguments @xmath48 , we get the moment equation @xmath49 which is different from its plane wave counterpart only by extra scale indexes and extra integrations in scale logarithms @xmath50(octaves ) . to express the third order moments in via the second moments",
    ", we must substitute @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the response function .",
    "the difference from the standard plane - wave approach @xcite is that additionally to the summation over vector indices we have to sum up over octaves to integrate over @xmath50 in each scale variable .",

    "the stochastic hydrodynamics approach consists in introducing random force in the navier - stokes equations and calculating the velocity field momenta @xmath59 using the stochastic perturbation theory , pioneered by wyld @xcite , or the functional integral formalism .    in a coordinate representation ,",
    "the stochastic nse is written in the form @xmath60 the random force correlator @xmath61 should obey certain conditions to make the resulting theory physically feasible and the perturbation expansion suitable for analytical evaluation .",
    "first , the energy injection by random force should be equal to the energy dissipation ; secondly , the forcing should be essentially infrared ( ir ) , it should be localized at large scales ; third , it is desirable to have a parameter to control the ir divergences ( when the size of the system tends to infinity ) .    to exclude the pressure term in using the incompressibility condition ,",
    "the fourier representation is used @xmath62 the random force correlator is usually taken in the form @xmath63 where the function @xmath64 has a suitable power - law behavior . in the simplest , but not very feasible physically , case @xmath65 , we deal with the white noise , @xmath66-correlated in both space and time .",
    "what is most realistic physically , is to have a random force concentrated in a limited domain in @xmath67-space @xmath68 .",
    "this case , however , is difficult to evaluate analytically in the perturbation theory @xcite . in the multiscale approach",
    "we are going to present , we solve this problem by constructing a noise acting in a limited domain of scales @xmath22 in @xmath24 space",

    "leads to a system of integro - differential equations for the scale components @xmath69 : @xmath70 now we face the problem of appropriate choice of the force correlator @xmath71 it was shown in the previous paper @xcite that the @xmath12 representation provides an extra analytical flexibility in constructing random processes with desired correlation properties in a coordinate space . for instance , the random process given by wavelet coefficients with the correlation function @xmath72 possesses the same correlation properties in @xmath37 coordinate space as the white noise does",
    ". casting @xmath73 in terms of @xmath74 by means of we get @xmath75 that coincides with the correlation function of the white noise .",

    "physically , the scale - dependent processes obeying and , respectively , describe quite different processes : fluctuations of the former type are mutually correlated only for coinciding scales ( @xmath78 ) , while for the latter case all fluctuations are correlated .",

    "taking into account we deal with the incompressible fluid in @xmath80 dimensions , we can put down a general form of the desired force correlator @xmath81 the @xmath66-correlated random force in the wavenumber space does not provide an adequate description of hydrodynamic turbulence , for it gives an energy injection in all scales , small and large . in physical settings , the fluid is usually stirred at a predetermined scale , or in a narrow range of scales , comparable to the size of the system . as a simplest model of such a forcing , we can consider a force acting on a single scale @xmath82 by choosing @xmath83    now let us turn to the perturbative calculations . the stochastic diagram techniques for the component fields @xmath84 stems from eq . and is a straightforward generalization of the wyld diagram technique for the fourier components @xmath85 : @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the bare response function for fourier component . to keep the scales and wavevectors on the same footing and",

    "the initial value @xmath93 should be restored .",
    "the validity of considering @xmath91 as a small parameter of perturbation expansion is justified by renormalization group methods @xcite ; see also @xcite for recent developments and generalizations .",
    "in the zero - th order of perturbation expansion the response function does not depend on scale and coincides with @xmath94 for all scale components : @xmath95 in the @xmath96 and the next orders of perturbation expansion the standard stochastic diagram techniques , used by many authors @xcite , is reproduced with the difference that : ( i ) each vertex , each response and correlation function attain scale superscripts ; ( ii ) integration over octaves @xmath50 is performed over all pair - matching scale indices .",
    "mathematically , this means that each diagram line corresponding to the plane wave component @xmath97 in standard techniques now attains an extra wavelet factor and becomes @xmath98 .",

    "regardless phenomenologically clear and widely accepted kolmogorov @xcite theory of fully developed turbulence , still there are discussions on the preference of either differential equations , or field theoretic methods based on renormalization group , or multifractal approach to describe the turbulence in an incompressible fluid .    as it concerns the physical interpretation of the velocity field wavelet coefficients , by this paper we intended to say that stochastic nature of spatially extended hydrodynamic turbulence prescribes a certain kind of `` wave - particle dualism '' to the turbulent phenomena , in a sense , that the answer we get depends on the basic functions used to describe the turbulence .",
    "if the basis of plain waves was chosen , there are no fair reasons to comply about @xmath197 behavior or paradoxes : what we get is what we set . alternatively ,",
    "if we want to have an analytical description of the spatially extended turbulence compatible with the kolmogorov phenomenology of local turbulent pulsations of given scales , we need to set a functional basis that respects the scale locally .",
    "this is the wavelet decomposition .",
    "the fourier transform , being essentially nonlocal , apparently does not fit the above mentioned requirements , but the windowed fourier transform , or wave packet decomposition used by v.zimin @xcite and t.nakano for the analysis of turbulence does , and possibly there is only a technical difference between our approach and that of nakano @xcite . however , it is important to emphasize that the incorporation of the basic function @xmath31 into consideration makes us to admit that the definition of the local fluctuations of a given scale is not completely objective and depends on means of observation .",
