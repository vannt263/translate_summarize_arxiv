    "with the recent explosion of interest in graphene , there are numerous experimental motivations for understanding the influence of impurities on its electronic and transport properties . for non - interacting electrons ,",
    "the influence of a dilute concentration of impurities on transport properties has been investigated in some depth @xcite . here",
    "we shall instead study in some detail the physics associated with a _ single _",
    "impurity carrying electrical charge @xmath1 .",
    "nanoscale studies of the electronic properties of a single graphene sheet have recently become possible @xcite , and so it should eventually be possible to observe the variation in the charge density and the local density of states as a function of distance from the impurity .",
    "we shall show here that this spatial structure is a sensitive probe of the strong correlations between the electrons in graphene , and of the unusual nature of screening in a two - dimensional semi - metal with a dirac dispersion spectrum .    for non - interacting electrons ,",
    "the influence of a coulomb impurity exerting a potential @xmath2 ( where @xmath3 is the distance from the impurity ) was studied some time ago @xcite .",
    "this case is equivalent to the familiar `` friedel problem '' but for dirac fermions .",
    "however , even for this seemingly simple case , there are subtleties which were overlooked in the initial treatment @xcite , and corrected in ref .  .",
    "a number of papers appeared @xcite while our paper was being written , presenting additional results on this non - interacting problem .",
    "we shall review and extend the results of ref .   for non - interacting electrons in section  [",
    "sec : nonint ]",
    ". we shall then proceed to the full treatment of the impurity problem , and allow for electron - electron coulomb interactions . in short ,",
    "our results are as follows . for noninteracting electrons",
    ", the screening charge is a local delta - function in space to all orders in perturbation theory over the impurity charge .",
    "the sign of this screening charge is opposite to that of the impurity , as is usually the case .",
    "however , once interaction between electrons is turned on , the screening charge develops a long - range tail , even for small impurity charges .",
    "the tail follows approximately an @xmath0 law , with a coefficient which varies quite slowly with @xmath3 .",
    "notably , the sign of this tail is the same as that of the impurity .",
    "the long - range tail of the screening charge , thus , is a sensitive probe of the interaction between electrons , in particular to the renormalization of the fermion velocity and the `` quantum critical '' aspects @xcite of the interacting dirac fermion problem .",
    "many essential aspects of the theory above follow from its properties under the renormalization group ( rg ) transformation under which @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "a standard analysis shows that all three couplings in @xmath26 , namely @xmath11 , @xmath1 , and @xmath27 , are invariant under this transformation at tree level .",
    "indeed , for two of the couplings , this invariance extends to all orders in perturbation theory : the coupling @xmath27 does not renormalize because of the non - analytic @xmath28 co - efficient , while @xmath1 remains invariant because it is protected by gauge invariance @xcite .",
    "so we need only examine the rg flow of a single coupling , the velocity @xmath11 . because @xmath11 is a bulk coupling ,",
    "its flow can not be influenced in the thermodynamic limit by a single impurity , and so can be computed in the absence of the impurity .",
    "such a rg flow was initially examined in the more general context of theories with chern - simons couplings in ref .  , but a complete presentation was given in the present context in ref .",
    ": we shall use the notation and results of the latter paper here , with the exception that we use two - component dirac fermions with @xmath4 while ref .",
    "uses four - component dirac fermions with @xmath29",
    ".    it will be useful for our analysis to introduce two combinations of the above couplings which also have engineering dimension zero , and hence are pure numbers .",
    "these are @xmath30 ( we have set @xmath31 elsewhere in the paper ) .",
    "as we will see , the coupling @xmath32 is a measure of the strength of the electron - electron coulomb interactions , while @xmath33 measures the strength of the electron - impurity coulomb interaction .",
    "we shall limit our explicit results here to the spatial form of the charge density @xmath34 ( where @xmath35 acts on the dirac space ) induced by the impurity .",
    "however , our rg strategy can be extended to other observables of experimental interest , such as the local density of states .",
    "as noted above , we will begin in section  [ sec : nonint ] by considering only the electron - impurity coulomb interaction , while electron - electron coulomb interactions will be accounted for in section  [ sec : int ] .",
    "this section will ignore the electron - electron coulomb interactions .",
    "formally , we work in the limit @xmath36 , but @xmath33 is kept fixed .",
    "the problem reduces to that of a single dirac electron in the attractive impurity potential @xmath37 this problem was originally studied in ref .  .",
    "however , they introduced an arbitrary cutoff at high energy to regulate the problem at short distances , and this leads to spurious results @xcite . as we will demonstrate here , there is no dependence upon a cutoff energy scale at all orders in perturbation theory , provided the high energy behavior is regulated in a proper gauge - invariant manner . with no cutoff energy scale present , a number of results can be deduced by simple dimensional analysis .",
    "the fourier transform of the charge density @xmath38 is dimensionless , and therefore we can write @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a universal function of the dimensionless coupling @xmath33 . note that @xmath41 is required by this dimensional argument to be @xmath28-independent , and so @xmath42 .",
    "the arguments so far are perturbative , but non - perturbative effects can be deduced by solving the full dirac equation in the potential in eq .",
    "( [ vr ] ) .",
    "this solution has appeared elsewhere @xcite , and so we will not reproduce it here .",
    "such an analysis shows that the perturbative arguments apply for @xmath43 , but new physics appears for @xmath44 .",
    "in particular , shytov _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that @xmath45 for @xmath44 ( the sign of this tail is opposite to that of the impurity ) .",
    "we shall limit our discussion in this section to the @xmath46 case .",
    "one reason for doing so is that electron - electron coulomb interactions act to reduce the effective value of @xmath33 .",
    "this will become clearer in section  [ sec : int ] , but we note here that a standard rpa screening of the potential @xmath47 in eq .",
    "( [ vr ] ) can be simply accounted for by applying the mapping @xmath48 to the results of the present section .",
    "the value of @xmath32 in graphene is not small @xcite .",
    "we shall now establish the existence of the universal function @xmath40 in eq .",
    "( [ n1 ] ) to all orders in @xmath33 .",
    "the existence of a universal @xmath40 is a consequence of the non - renormalization of the impurity charge @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "we compute @xmath41 diagrammatically , and the needed diagrams all have one fermion loop and are shown in fig .",

    "we will now consider the full problem defined in eq .",
    "( [ zz ] ) , and account for both the electron - electron and electron - impurity coulomb interactions .",
    "the problem can be solved in two limits : in the weak coupling limit @xmath36 and the large @xmath66 limit , @xmath67 with fixed @xmath68 . in both cases",
    "@xmath69 , so one can limit oneself to linear response in which the induced charge is [ generalizing eq .",
    "( [ p0 ] ) ] @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the full propagator of the coulomb potential @xmath17 , and @xmath72 is the polarization tensor .",
    "the connection between @xmath71 and @xmath72 is @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the bare propagator , @xmath75 to leading order ( either in coupling or @xmath76 ) , the polarization operator was given in eq .",
    "( [ p0res ] ) , and we showed in section  [ sec : nonint ] that this gives rise to a @xmath28-independent @xmath41 , or a screening charge localized at @xmath77 .    however , if we compute corrections , we find logarithmically divergent diagrams , where the logarithms are cut off from above by the inverse lattice size and from below by @xmath28 .",
    "the leading logarithms are summed by a standard rg procedure . since the theory is renormalizable",
    ", we can eliminate the dependence on the cutoff by expressing the each diagram in terms of the renormalized parameters , instead of the bare parameters of the lagrangian .",
    "choosing the renormalization point to be @xmath78 , and denote @xmath79 as the fermion velocity at the scale @xmath11 , the polarization tensor can be schematically written as @xmath80 in @xmath81 there are logarithms of the ratio @xmath82 .",
    "we notice that @xmath83 is is invariant under a change of the renormalization @xmath78 , given that @xmath79 is changed correspondingly ( the particle density has no anomalous dimension ) .",
    "to eliminate the powers of @xmath84 we can choose @xmath85 , hence @xmath86 where in the perturbative expansion of the right hand side there is no large logarithms .",
    "thus to leading order it is given by a single diagram , which was computed previously [ eq .  ( [ p0res ] ) ] , @xmath87 all the leadings logarithms are contained in the function @xmath88 , which satisfies the equation @xmath89 with the boundary condition @xmath90 .",
    "the screening charge is then @xmath91 the problem is now reduced to the problem of finding @xmath88 [ or , equivalently , @xmath92 .",
    "this problem has a long history  @xcite ; most recently it has been revisited in ref .",
    "( see also below ) .    to find the spatial charge distribution @xmath93",
    "one needs to take fourier transform of eq .",
    "( [ nlambda ] ) .",
    "first one notice that if the velocity does not run then @xmath93 is proportional to @xmath94 .",
    "only when @xmath11 runs with the momentum scale does @xmath93 differ from @xmath95 away from the origin . when the running is slow ( as at weak coupling or at large @xmath66 ) , the amount of screening charge enclosed inside a circle of radius @xmath3 ( assumed to be much larger than the lattice spacing ) , to leading order , is @xmath96 the total screening charge is small if @xmath32 at the scale @xmath97 is small , and close to @xmath98 if @xmath32 is large .",

    "positive_. to see what is happening , let us take the limit @xmath100 in eq.([nr - int ] ) .",
    "this limit corresponds to the infrared limit @xmath101 .",
    "we know that asymptotically @xmath88 grows to @xmath102 in this limit ( although only logarithmically ) , hence @xmath103 i.e. , the total screening charge is zero when integrated over the whole space ( although the integral goes to zero very slowly ) .",
    "the presence of an external ion , therefore , only leads to charge redistribution : a fraction of the unit charge is pushed from short distance ( of order of lattice spacing ) to longer distances , but none of the charge goes to infinity .",
    "therefore , there is a finite negative screening charge localized near @xmath77 .",
    "its value can be found by taking @xmath3 to be of order of inverse lattice spacing @xmath104 in eq .",

    "the reason is that for the charge density @xmath38 to be nonzero , it is necessary that the coupling constant runs .",
