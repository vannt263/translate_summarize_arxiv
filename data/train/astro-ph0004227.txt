    "the last year or so has seen the first serious attempts to provide some direct connections between `` fundamental '' high - energy physics @xcite and `` low - energy '' standard cosmology @xcite . although this `` top - down '' approach is still at a very early stage , a number of crucial general trends already became apparent .",
    "for example , since high - energy theories are formulated in higher dimensions , any low energy limit will necessarily involve dimensional reduction , and possibly also compactification @xcite .",
    "this turns out to be crucial because as a result of this process the low energy , four - dimensional coupling constants become functions of the radii of extra dimensions , which are often variables .",
    "one can therefore end up with low - energy effective models in which some of the `` fundamental '' constants of nature are time and/or space - varying quantities .",
    "there are a number of known examples of such models @xcite . on the other hand , there are recent tentative suggestions of a time - variation of the fine structure constant @xcite , but these require further confirmation .",
    "it is therefore interesting to study the possible observational signatures of such variations , and in particular to find out how such observational signatures constrain the possible models .",
    "it turns out to be easier to study this issue by constructing simple `` toy models '' .",
    "this provides a `` bottom - up '' approach , in which one gives up the possibility of testing particular assumptions from first principles , but instead has the possibility of exploring a larger patch of parameter space .",
    "this idea goes back at least to dirac , and had its first detailed realization with the brans - dicke model @xcite , which has a varying @xmath3 .",
    "a number of toy models have recently been constructed to analyse possible variations of the fine structure constant @xcite , the speed of light @xcite and electric charge @xcite .",
    "a somewhat related approach is that of `` quintessence '' ( see for example @xcite )",
    ". these are essentially models with a time - varying cosmological constant .    here",
    "we consider the possible observational effects of having a universe made up of different domains , each with a different value of the cosmological constant .",
    "such a structure would dramatically influence the future evolution of the universe @xcite .",
    "recent observations of type ia supernovae up to redshifts of about @xmath4 @xcite , when combined with cmbr anisotropy data , seem to indicate that our patch of the universe is currently characterised by the parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 , implying that the cosmological constant become important only very recently .",
    "as has been pointed out before , the supernovae measurements are local , and so they can not be extrapolated all the way to the horizon .",
    "for example , we could be living in a small , sub - critical bubble , and our local neighbourhood could have a value of @xmath7 that is uncharacteristic . here",
    "we discuss some basic consequences of such a scenario .",
    "we shall assume that different regions of space have different values of the vacuum energy density , separated by domain walls .",
    "this can be achieved if there is a scalar field , say @xmath8 , which within each region sits in one of a number of possible minima of a time - independent potential .",
    "the above simplifying assumptions could be relaxed ; for example one could instead consider quintessence - type fields .",
    "this would introduce quantitative differences , but would not change the basic qualitative results we are discussing .    in the following section we describe our numerical simulations of the evolution of the domain wall network .",
    "we then proceed to discuss the basic features of the structure formation mechanism for this scenario in section  [ growth ] .",
    "finally we present our results in section  [ results ] and discuss our conclusions in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "we consider the evolution of a network of domain walls in a k=0 friedmann - robertson - walker universe with line element :    @xmath9    where @xmath10 is the cosmological expansion factor and @xmath11 is the conformal time .",
    "the dynamics of a scalar filed @xmath8 is determined by the lagrangian density ,    @xmath12    where we will take @xmath13 to be a generic @xmath14 potential with two degenerate minima    @xmath15    where @xmath16 smoothly interpolates between @xmath17 at @xmath18 and @xmath19 at @xmath20 and is otherwise such that the potential @xmath13 has two minima at @xmath21 which have different energies .",
    "this obviously admits domain wall solutions @xcite .",
    "the precise form of the function @xmath16 is not important as it will not affect domain walls dynamics if @xmath22 for all possible values of the scalar field @xmath8 . by varying the action    @xmath23    with respect to @xmath8",
    "we obtain the field equation of motion :    @xmath24    with    @xmath25    when making numerical simulations of the evolution of domain wall networks ( or indeed other defects ) it is also often convenient to modify the equation of motion for the scalar field @xmath8 in such a way that the comoving thickness of the walls is fixed in comoving coordinates .",
    "this is known as the prs algorithm @xcite and it will not significantly affect the large - scale dynamics of domain walls .    hence , we will modify the evolution equation for the scalar field @xmath8 according to the prs prescription :    @xmath26    where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are constants .",
    "we choose @xmath29 in order for the walls to have constant comoving thickness and @xmath30 by requiring that the momentum conservation law for how a wall slows down in an expanding universe is maintained @xcite .",
    "we perform two - dimensional simulations of domain wall evolution for which @xmath31 .",
    "these have the advantage of allowing a larger dynamic range and better resolution than tree - dimensional simulations .",
    "we assume the initial value of @xmath8 to be a random variable between @xmath32 and @xmath33 and the initial value of @xmath34 to be equal to zero everywhere .",
    "we normalise the numerical simulations so that @xmath35 .",
    "we have checked @xcite that the initial conditions are unimportant ( as expected ) , because the domain wall network rapidly approaches a scaling solution with its statistical properties being independent of the initial configuration .",
    "as described previously , we shall assume that the universe is made up of several regions ( domains ) , with different vacuum energy densities .",
    "we will discuss the case where there are two such possible values , but it would be easy to generalise this to a distribution with a continuous range of values .",
    "moreover , one assumes that the thin region separating any two of the domains considered ( domain wall ) is not relevant for structure formation .",
    "this happens if the potential of the field is small enough at the origin .",
    "vacuum energy becomes dominant only for recent epochs and so we shall be concerned with the evolution of perturbations only in the matter - dominated era , neglecting the contribution of the radiation component .",
    "the average vacuum density is @xmath36 , so that    @xmath37    where @xmath38 is the critical density .",
    "we define @xmath39 in a particular domain as    @xmath40    where @xmath41 is the value of the vacuum energy density inside the domain . in our case",
    "@xmath39 can have one of two possible values @xmath42 .    in the synchronous gauge , the linear evolution equation for cold dark matter density perturbations , @xmath43 , in a flat universe with a non - zero cosmological",
    "constant can be written as    @xmath44    where the evolution of the scale factor @xmath45 , is governed by the friedmann equation    @xmath46    here a dot represents a derivative with respect to conformal time , the superscript ` 0 ' means that the quantities are to be evaluated at the present time , and @xmath47 .",
    "note that the average matter and vacuum energy densities at an arbitrary epoch can be written as    @xmath48    and @xmath49 , where we have also chosen @xmath50 .",
    "we start the simulation sufficiently early ( say at a red - shift @xmath51 ) so that we do not have to worry about the initial compensation .",
    "because our aim is to investigate the average equation of state of each domain we shall assume the following initial conditions for eq .",
    "( [ one ] ) :    @xmath52    we will parametrise the density perturbations @xmath43 in each domain as a fluctuation @xmath53 in the local value of the matter density .",
    "it is easy to show that the time component    @xmath54    of the pseudo - stress - energy tensor , @xmath55 , must be compensated on super - horizon scales ( with @xmath56 ) @xcite . here",
    ", the quantity @xmath57 can be interpreted as a fractional variation in the local expansion rate parametrised by @xmath2 .",
    "we verified that :    @xmath58    where @xmath59 except near the boundary between different domains as expected from the previous discussion .",
    "note that the factor of two in the ` hubble ' term of the above expression arises because the friedmann equation relates @xmath60 to the average matter and vacuum energy densities .",
    "this can be confirmed in fig .  1 , which shows the value of the three terms above , as well as of its sum , for a particular simulation .",
    "the cancellation is almost perfect everywhere except where there are domain walls .",
    "a more detailed study also shows that at the domain walls the area where the sum of the three terms is positive is equal to that where the sum is negative , so that these average out to zero over the whole box .",
    "one key assumption of our model is that the energy scale of the phase transition which produced the domain walls is sufficiently low so that the domain walls have a negligible effect on structure formation .",
    "the standard bound of 1 mev @xcite obviously applies here .",
    "the main consequence of this assumption is that the inhomogeneities are not generated by the domain walls but are due to the different vacuum densities in different domains .",
    "the fact that the vacuum densities only become important at late times explains why these inhomogeneities in the local values of the cosmological parameters @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 are created only at recent times .",
    "different values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 lead to different linear growth factors from early times to the present . for primordial perturbations in a flat @xmath61 model ,",
    "the quantity    @xmath62    provides a very good fit to the suppression of growth of density perturbations relative to that of a @xmath63 universe @xcite .",
    "this rescaling was also shown to be valid for generic topological defect models for structure formation on all scales of cosmological interest and for any reasonable combination of the cosmological parameters @xmath2 , @xmath1 and @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "our model will thus lead to a universe made up of several domains , in which the growth factor @xmath64 has different values .",
    "the result is an inhomogeneous universe today with , for example , the abundance of clusters of galaxies varying from one position to another .",
    "hence , we expect the presence of occasional ` great walls ' separating domains with different values of the cosmological parameters at high red - shift .",
    "however , given that in our model the domain walls do not generate any cosmologically relevant fluctuations these ` great walls ' will simply provide a smooth transition between domains with different values of the cosmological parameters .",
    "this can clearly be seen in figs .  1 and 2 .",
    "given that the length - scale corresponding to these inhomogeneities is expected to be close to the horizon scale ( simply due to the dynamics of the domain walls ) , we may not be able to realize that we live in an inhomogeneous universe .",
    "this happens because as we look far away we are also looking backwards in time and the universe will get more and more homogeneous as the red - shift of the cosmological objects we are looking at increases ( note that @xmath65 decreases very rapidly with red - shift ) .",
    "in fact , the higher the red - shift we are looking at the larger is the possibility of finding a domain with different local values of the cosmological parameters but the harder is to realize that .",
    "this is clearly illustrated in fig .",
    "2 , which shows the values of @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 for a particular simulation .",
    "one should notice the different colour schemes being used for @xmath69 and @xmath70 ; had we used the same colour scheme for the earlier redshift , no significant fluctuations would be detectable by visual inspection .",
    "this also explains why cmb fluctuations created at last scattering will be completely negligible .",
    "significant cmb fluctuations can only be created at late times but even these are expected to be small if we do not live near the edge of our domain .",
    "however , we know that to be true ( if @xmath71 is not too small ) because otherwise the universe would look very anisotropic .",
    "this makes the observational detection of this effect somewhat non - trivial .",
    "the best way of doing it should be through the determination of the number density of objects as a function of redshift in different directions , assuming that one has a reliable understanding of other possible evolutionary effects .",
    "specific examples would be the counting of x - ray or sunyaev - zeldovich galaxy clusters as a function of the red - shift @xmath72 such as can be performed by xmm or planck @xcite , large - scale velocity flows @xcite or gravitational lensing statistics of extragalactic surveys @xcite . another possibility is to look for cosmological anisotropies out to @xmath4 with supernovae ia .",
    "results from a recent analysis @xcite using a combined sample of 79 high and low red - shift supernovae are consistent with an homogeneous and isotropic universe but do not exclude the existence of significant anisotropies on cosmological scales .",
    "unfortunately , some of their assumptions and results do not apply to our model .",
    "such an investigation within the scope of our model is more complex because the allowed variations on the local values of the cosmological parameters are not independent and the spatial distribution of the patches with different values of the cosmological parameters is unknown .",
    "a simplified analysis of supernova and cmb data constraints was recently performed in @xcite",
    "in this paper we have provided a simple example of a cosmological scenario where the universe becomes inhomogeneous at a very recent epoch , in a way which is perfectly consistent with current observations assuming that we are not very close to one of the boundaries .",
    "the inhomogeneity arises due to the onset of vacuum energy domination , if the value of the ` cosmological ' constant is different in different domains .",
    "this in turn implies that the subsequent dynamics of each patch of the universe will be different , leading to different values of other cosmological parameters in each patch , such as the matter density and the hubble constant .",
    "the size of each patch is determined by the dynamics of the domain walls but is expected to be of the order of the horizon ( although causality prevents it from exceeding it ) .",
    "this fact makes the detection of the cosmological signatures of this kind of model more difficult given that the contribution of the vacuum energy density rapidly becomes negligible with increasing red - shift .",
