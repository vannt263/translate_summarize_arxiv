    "the geometric phase is the phase difference acquired over the course of a precession loop .",
    "the precession time @xmath53 ( i.e. the slow characteristic time of our problem ) is the time at which the axis @xmath21 is rotating one cycle around the axis @xmath8 , i.e. such that @xmath54 .    according to eq.([larmor ] ) , the precession time is given by : @xmath55    we can now give the expression of the number @xmath56 ( the subscript @xmath57 stands for the non - inertial approximation ) of rotation around the @xmath21 axis ( spinning rotation ) during the time of a precession of the same axis around @xmath8 . according to the relation @xmath58 , we have : @xmath59 where we used eq.([precession_time ] ) , eq.([gyromag ] ) , and the expression of the larmor angular velocity @xmath60 . anticipating over the next section , we introduce the `` slowness parameter '' @xmath61 defined as the dimensionless angular momentum @xmath62 scaled with the angular momentum @xmath63 , i.e. the ratio of the slow over the fast angular momentum , or equivalently of the slow over the fast time - scale : @xmath64 the last term in the right - hand side of eq.([slowg ] ) defines the fast characteristic time @xmath65 of the motion .",

    "eq.([deltapsi2 ] ) and eq.([deltapsi1 ] ) gives the expression of @xmath80 : @xmath81    on the other hand , in the framework of the ampere s model of the `` molecular currents '' , a microscopic magnetic moment is defined by the * bohr magneton * @xmath82 generated by an electron of mass @xmath4 and charge @xmath5 moving in a loop of bohr radius @xmath74 .",

    "the scalar gyromagnetic relation eq.([gyromag ] ) used above in the framework of the mechanical ( or gilbert s ) model of the magnetic dipole coincides with the usual vectorial definition @xmath2 of the gyromagnetic relation if the inertial effects are neglected @xmath10 .",

    "this equation is the adiabatic limit ( i.e. without damping ) of the inertial llg presented in previous studies @xcite .",
    "it is convenient to rewrite eq.([illg ] ) , with the dimensionless time @xmath98 and the slowness parameter @xmath61 ( both defined in eq.([slowg ] ) ) .",

    "these equations allow the adiabatic movement to be studied below in terms of the geometric phase . the generalized equation including gilbert damping has been studied in previous reports @xcite .",
    "the number @xmath102 of rotation around the @xmath21 axis performed by the magnetization vector during the ( dimensionless ) time @xmath103 of one precession is : @xmath104    where @xmath105 is the dimensionless angular velocity @xmath106 . due to the conservation of the angular momentum component @xmath37",
    ", @xmath107 is constant which implies @xmath108 the hannay angle @xmath109 is @xmath110 which is the solid angle swept by the axis in one precession cycle .",
    "following ref.@xcite we seek for the slow manifold , _ i.e. _ the set of initial conditions in the phase space for which the particular solution of the equations of motion eqs.([illg3 ] ) corresponds to pure precession , which means precession in the absence of nutation .",
    "it therefore corresponds to @xmath111 , from which inserted in eq.([illg3]a ) gives @xmath112 the dynamics of pure precession therefore give two corresponding precessional velocities , a slow one @xmath113 and a fast one @xmath114 , which are given by @xmath115    the square root in this equation shows that the pure precession requires @xmath116 .",
    "therefore , pure precession without nutation is possible for @xmath117 for any inclination angle @xmath14 , whereas for @xmath118 , pure precession is only possible for inclination angles such that @xmath116 .",
    "we now consider the slow precession velocity @xmath113 given by eq.([pureprecessions ] ) .",
    "for such slow pure precession it is possible to derive exact results from eq.([psi1 ] ) . in this case @xmath119 and @xmath14 are constant , and since @xmath113 is negative whatever the sign of @xmath120 , the precession time reads @xmath121 .",
    "combined with @xmath122 , eq.([psi1 ] ) gives @xmath123 using from eq.([gpureprecession ] ) @xmath124 and using the slow precession velocity from eq.([pureprecessions ] ) @xmath125 eq.([psi3 ] ) gives @xmath126    this expression generalizes eq.([deltapsig ] ) of section iii to the inertial regime for the pure precession .",
    "this is of course the same expression as that obtained for the spinning top in ref.@xcite . in this framework , the first term @xmath127 of",
    "the expansion was the dynamical phase .",
    "the question that was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , was about the nature of the second term @xmath128 .",
    "there was an ambiguity about associating it to the dynamical phase or to the geometric phase .",
    "it appears below that , in the framework of the `` bohr magneton '' approach used in section iii - d for the magnetic monopole , the two first terms in the right hand side of eq.([psi4 ] ) are identical . indeed , according to the ii - d , we have @xmath129 and eq.([psi4 ] ) reads :    @xmath130    the geometric phase @xmath131 is a function of the precession angle @xmath14 and the slowness parameter @xmath61 .",
    "note that if we remove the dynamical angle @xmath132 , the developpement is a function of a single parameter @xmath133 only .",
    "the generalization of the magnetic monopole eq.([monopolemag ] ) is @xmath134 so that    @xmath135 \\\\ & = & \\frac{2\\cos\\theta}{r^2 }   \\left ( 2 +   \\left ( \\frac{cos \\theta}{g^2 } \\right ) -     \\left(\\frac{cos \\theta}{g^2 } \\right)^2 + 2     \\left ( \\frac{cos \\theta}{g^2 } \\right)^3 - 5     \\left ( \\frac{cos \\theta}{g^2 }",

    "magnetization dynamics have been investigated beyond the usual assumption of the total separation of time scales between slow and fast magnetic degrees of freedom , for the adiabatic limit .",
    "we have exploited the analogy with the spinning top by pushing the mechanical model of the magnetic dipole beyond gilbert s assumption .",
    "fast degrees of freedom are introduced with the angular momentum @xmath1 and its time variation ( with non - zero first and second principal moment of inertia @xmath136 ) .",
    "the problem is investigated from the viewpoint of the geometric phase which allows the magnetic monopole to be defined naturally .",
    "the effect of inertia is then taken into account , and an analytical expression is obtained in the case of the _ pure precession _ , for which the nutation vanishes .    in the case of pure precession with precession angle @xmath14 , the calculation of the geometric phase shows that , beyond a dynamical phase of the form @xmath137 , the hannay angle is a simple function of the parameter @xmath138 , where @xmath139 is the slowness parameter ( i.e. the ratio of the slow characteristic time of the precession over the fast characteristic time ) .    the magnetic monopole ( defined as the radial magnetic field produced from a punctual center ) , is derived directly from the geometric phase . in the usual case without inertia ( @xmath140 ) ,",
    "the bohr magneton approach gives a very simple expression of the magnetic monopole as a function of the precession angle @xmath141 . in the case of pure precession ,",
    "the correction due to the action of the fast degrees of freedom is given as a simple expression @xmath142 $ ] .",
    "note that in an experimental context , the magnetic monopole @xmath80 is constant because it is related to a given material , and the precession angle @xmath14 depends the parameter @xmath61 .",
    "this result suggests that the pure precession - i.e. the slow manifold for the dynamics of the magnetization @xcite - should not be a purely formal concept , but could correspond to the actual motion of the magnetization for the ultrafast precession of the magnetization , that would correspond to the minimum power dissipated by the system ( in comparison with the motion that includes nutation oscillations superimposed to the precession ) .",
    "this point should however still be clarified in further studies .",
