    "in the inflationary universe scenario , large scale structure is generated by the stretching of subatomic scale quantum fluctuations to macroscopic length scales , during an epoch of superluminal expansion supposed to have occurred prior to the radiation dominated era .",
    "indeed such expansion appears to be essential to the creation of correlations on super - hubble radius scales , a feat prohibited by causality in the standard hot big bang era .",
    "however , cosmic inflation does not resolve the problem of the initial singularity , and it seems clear that a more complete theory than inflation is needed to deal with it .",
    "but if time existed before the the initial singularity , it is a logical possibility that the large scale structure and density perturbations we see today were generated during this pre - singularity epoch .",
    "the ekpyrotic and cyclic scenarios@xcite provide explicit realisations of this idea ( pre - figured in the ` pre - big bang ' scenario of veneziano et al.@xcite ) . in the ekpyrotic and cyclic scenarios , scale invariant large scale density perturbations are generated during a phase which is contracting ( in the einstein frame ) before the bounce to expansion@xcite .",
    "the task of matching these perturbations across the bounce to the expanding epoch is highly challenging , since general relativity must break down there , and the use of string theory methods will ultimately be essential .",
    "there are indications that for the particular type of singularity involved here ( namely the collapse of a single extra dimension ) the divergences are relatively weak@xcite , but the matching issue remains unsettled at the present time@xcite .    in a contracting universe",
    ", the growing mode adiabatic density perturbation corresponds to a shift in the time to the ` big crunch ' . a perturbation in the space curvature , however , is a decaying mode perturbation because it becomes increasingly irrelevant as the scale factor shrinks .",
    "( these statements both hold in einstein frame and comoving gauge ) .",
    "however , in an expanding universe , the situation is reversed .",
    "a time delay is now a decaying mode perturbation and the curvature perturbation is the growing mode .",
    "this has led several authors to suggest that in the ekpyrotic and cyclic scenarios , where scale invariant density perturbations are generated in the collapsing phase growing mode , that these perturbations would match on to pure decaying mode perturbations in the subsequent expanding phase . indeed",
    "this result is obtained if one insists on matching the curvature perturbation across the bounce @xcite .    however , this behaviour would appear surprising from a more physical viewpoint . in the models being considered , gravity is attractive throughout .",
    "the growing mode instability is driven by gravitational attraction and it is physically implausible that it should precisely reverse at a bounce so as to dissipate after the bounce and render the final universe perfectly homogeneous .    in this paper",
    "we address this issue by considering a model in which the issue can be definitively settled within conventional general relativity .",
    "it is well known that a massive scalar field in a closed friedman - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe can lead to a bounce without a singularity , and without violating the weak energy condition .",
    "this model has a long history starting with schrdinger @xcite , however he did not include the back - reaction of the scalar field on the background scale factor .",
    "it was also employed in semi - classical studies of quantum effects ( see for example @xcite ) , and of course is a common model in quantum cosmology and studies of the no boundary proposal ( see for example @xcite , and more recently @xcite ) .",
    "the classical dynamics for the spatially homogeneous case have also been investigated quite extensively , see for example @xcite .    a preliminary study of cosmological perturbations in such a universe ( and in other bouncing models )",
    "was performed by hwang and noh @xcite , with inconclusive results since the usual large scale approximations break down around the bounce .",
    "we develop new approximations that do not break down around the bounce , and using numerical simulations , accurately determine the propagation of linear perturbations through the bounce .",
    "we show that growing mode perturbations developed in the collapsing phase do not match to pure decaying mode perturbations in the expanding phase , thus there is no contradiction with the physical argument given above . of course",
    ", this does not at all prove that the same is true in the ekpyrotic / cyclic models : as the original papers made clear , an unambiguous matching condition is still required .",
    "but the present work does show that propagation of a growing mode perturbation across a bounce is possible at least in this toy model .",
    "we would also like to briefly mention recent work on the ekpyrotic / cyclic scenarios .",
    "durrer and vernizzi @xcite showed how matching across the bounce depends on what surface the matching is done on and the intrinsic stress energy of that surface .",
    "they showed that only for the special case of matching on constant energy density surfaces with no surface tension that the growing mode in the collapsing phase matches completely onto the decaying mode in the expanding phase .",
    "generally , some of the growing mode in the collapsing phase will go to the growing mode in the expanding phase .",
    "we should also mention a recent study of the possibility of isocurvature perturbations in the ekpyrotic model @xcite . peter and pinto - neto @xcite studied the matching problem in a hydro - dynamical fluid , and in a second publication employed a scalar field with negative kinetic energy in order to obtain a regular bounce @xcite .",
    "the problem of matching quantum fields across a bouncing universe of the type relevant to the ekpyrotic / cyclic scenarios has been considered by tolley and turok @xcite , and a number of studies have been made of analogous bouncing models within string theory @xcite .",
    "the equation for the scale factor in a frw universe is given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the scale factor , dot denotes a derivative with respect to time , @xmath2 is the density , @xmath3 is the pressure and @xmath4 is the reduced planck mass .",
    "as the scale factor is always positive and @xmath5 is negative for a collapsing universe , it follows from eq .",
    "( [ rachaduri ] ) that the strong energy condition ( @xmath6 ) must be violated for @xmath7 . which is what is needed for a bounce at a finite scale factor to be possible .",
    "this is the same as the condition for inflation .",
    "it is satisfied by a scalar field that is potential dominated as @xmath8 and @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the value of the scalar field and v is its potential . for simplicity",
    "we shall only consider a quadratic potential @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the constant mass of the scalar field .",
    "using the friedman equation @xmath13 it can be seen that the background curvature ( @xmath14 ) must be positive for the universe to bounce .",
    "this is because at the bounce @xmath15 and @xmath16 . as @xmath17",
    ", it follows that the weak energy condition is never violated by this model .",
    "although the above arguments show that it is possible for a closed universe with a scalar field to bounce , it does depend on the initial conditions .",
    "the scalar field evolution is given by the klein - gordon equation @xmath18 where @xmath19 . in a expanding universe @xmath20 and",
    "so the @xmath21 acts as a friction term . while in a collapsing universe @xmath22 and",
    "so the @xmath21 acts as an anti - friction term .",
    "so , it is possible that the the system will always be kinetic energy dominated and go to @xmath23 and @xmath24 instead of bouncing .",
    "it is only for a small subset of initial conditions that such a universe would bounce @xcite .",
    "the bounce will be symmetric in the background quantities if @xmath25 when @xmath26 .",
    "we use this case to study the evolution of perturbations through the bounce which is taken to occur at @xmath27 .",

    "the scalar field is represented by the ball and @xmath28 is proportional to the size of the ball . the scale factor changed by approximately 15 e - folds from its minimum to maximum size in the numerical integration .",
    "first the scalar field rolls up the potential as the universe collapses .",

    "in this article we have examined the way perturbations evolve across a bounce in a scalar field dominated closed universe .",
    "the background model naturally bounces without violating general relativity or the weak energy condition .",
    "analytical approximations were found for the background and perturbations .",
    "the perturbation approximations were found to work well around the bounce @xmath198 and away from the bounce in the slow - roll regime @xmath51 .",
    "however the overlap between the approximations was not sufficient to use the analytical approximations alone for arbitrary initial conditions .",
    "but they were useful in checking and interpreting the analytical solutions .",
    "the numerical solutions were complicated by the ordinary differential equation for @xmath61 having a singular coefficient at the bounce .",
    "thus a taylor approximation had to be used around the bounce and shooting methods used to obtain the numerical solution for particular initial conditions for a wider domain .",
    "the taylor expansion around the bounce could also be used to show that the perturbations and their first and second time derivatives are finite at the bounce and so non - linearities in the einstein tensor are not inevitable , but depend on the choice of initial conditions .",
    "it was shown that all wave number modes violate the large scale condition for @xmath51 and so become oscillatory around the bounce .",
    "we also found during the collapsing phase the growing mode could cause the comoving pressure to increase sufficiently to make @xmath145 vary significantly as the bounce is approached .",
    "the same is true for the decaying mode as the bounce is approached from the expanding phase side .",
    "thus , in general we do not expect @xmath145 to be constant around the bounce .",
    "a formula predicting when @xmath145 starts to vary was given .",
    "we also showed numerically that , for this model , a pure ingoing growing mode ( @xmath199 ) did not lead to a pure outgoing decaying mode ( @xmath200 ) .",
