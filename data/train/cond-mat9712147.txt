    "as first suggested by edwards and thouless @xcite , the sensitivity of the spectrum @xmath5 of disordered conductors to a small twist of phase @xmath6 in the boundary conditions @xmath7 is a powerful tool to probe the space structure of eigenfunctions and distinguish between the extended and the localized states .",
    "more precisely , the quantity @xmath8 that is now referred to as the `` level curvature '' , was introduced in ref .",
    "[ ] in order to describe this sensitivity quantitatively : @xmath9 where the mean level spacing @xmath10 is related to the mean density of states @xmath11 and the size of the @xmath12-dimensional sample @xmath13 .    in complex or disordered quantum systems ,",
    "the quantity @xmath8 fluctuates over the ensemble of energy levels @xmath5 or , for a given level , over the ensemble of realizations of disorder .",
    "the typical width of the distribution of level curvatures @xmath1 is of the order of the dimensionless conductance @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the diffusion coefficient . thus studying this distribution one can study the anderson transition from metal to insulator that takes place upon increasing the disorder .",
    "recent work @xcite has shown that the distribution of the fluctuating quantity @xmath8 is a particular example of _ parametric level statistics _ ,",
    "i.e. statistics of spectral responses of the system to a perturbation proportional to some parameter @xmath16 .",
    "a remarkable property that the parametric level statistics @xcite share with the usual level statistics @xcite , is that in a certain limit they are universal for all classically chaotic and disordered systems and can be described by the random matrix theory ( rmt ) of wigner and dyson @xcite .",
    "for disordered systems considered here this limit coincides @xcite with @xmath17 . for chaotic systems the same role",
    "is played @xcite by the ratio @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the first nonzero mode in the spectrum of the perron - frobenius operator that describes the chaotic behavior of the corresponding classical system . in particular , for a time - reversal - invariant system without spin - dependent interactions ( orthogonal ensemble ) the distribution of level curvatures , eq.([k ] ) , was found @xcite in this limit to have the form : @xmath20 is the average modulus of the level curvature .",
    "further study @xcite has shown that the the form of the curvature distribution is still given by eq.([rmt ] ) even when weak localization is taken into account ; only the dimensionless conductance in the expression for @xmath21 is changed appropriately .",
    "the form of eq.([rmt ] ) is universal .",
    "it does not depend , e.g. on the details of the system and the perturbation .",
    "its validity only requires the system to be t - invariant with @xmath22 , and the perturbation to break this invariance .",
    "the underlying physics behind this universality is the basis invariance of rmt which is equivalent to the eigenfunctions of the physical system being structureless .",
    "anderson localization apparently breaks the basis invariance .",
    "thus at a sufficiently small value of @xmath23 the universality of the spectral statistics should break down as well . in the strong localization limit",
    "one would expect @xcite a logarithmically normal decay rather than the power - law tails of the edwards - thouless curvature distribution function .",
    "this is because the fluctuations of level curvature @xmath24 can be viewed in this case as the consequence of the gaussian fluctuations of the localization radius @xmath25 for the exponentially localized wave functions .",
    "this picture is qualitatively confirmed by recent analytical @xcite and numerical @xcite calculations .    in the present paper",
    "we present a comprehensive review of our recent analytical and numerical results on the correction to the level curvature distribution @xmath26 when one approaches the anderson transition point @xmath27 from the metal side @xmath28 .",
    "some of the results discussed below are published in @xcite .",
    "it turns out that there are two completely different contributions to the correction @xmath29 .",
    "one of them @xmath30 is regular in the small parameter @xmath31 and can be obtained by a perturbative treatment @xcite of the nonzero spatial modes of the nonlinear supersymmetric sigma - model @xcite .",
    "the main result of this treatment @xcite is that the _ sign _ of the correction @xmath30 depends on the topological nature of perturbation .",
    "it is different for the `` global '' edwards - thouless curvature , where the perturbation is represented by a global twist of the phase in the boundary conditions,@xcite and for the case in which the curvature is probed by a `` local '' t - breaking perturbation such as magnetic impurities or random magnetic fluxes .",
    "below we present a numerical evidence of this fact .    on top of the regular correction",
    ", there is @xcite also a nonperturbative in @xmath31 correction @xmath32 which is proportional to @xmath33 .",
    "the latter correction is due to the so called pre - localized states @xcite , i.e. eigenstates with anomalously high peak(s ) in the probability density @xmath34 .",
    "there are reasons to consider the highly irregular , multifractal critical eigenstates @xcite as the result of a proliferation of such pre - localized states .",
    "this point of view is partly supported by the observation that weakly localized states in the critical dimensionality @xmath35 also exhibit a ( weak ) multifractality , as can be shown by means of the same methods ( renormalization group @xcite or space inhomogeneous saddle - point approximation @xcite ) that were used to discover the pre - localized states responsible for the slow current relaxation in disordered conductors@xcite .",
    "this idea enables us to extend the results for @xmath32 obtained by the novel saddle - point approximation @xcite for @xmath0 metals to the critical state at the anderson transition in @xmath36 dimensions .",
    "thus we can explain the branching nonanalyticity at @xmath37 found numerically in @xcite for the @xmath4 critical level curvature distribution function @xmath38 .",
    "furthermore , we suggest a relationship between the branching power and the exponent @xmath3 describing generic multifractal critical states @xcite .",
    "this relationship fits well the numerical results and provides a link between the spectral statistics and statistics of wavefunctions near the anderson transition .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we describe the perturbative in @xmath31 approach for calculating @xmath30 . in section",
    "iii we generalize the instanton approximation of ref .",
    "[ ] for the problem of level curvature distribution and calculate the nonperturbative contribution @xmath32 for the metallic ( weakly - localized ) states in quasi-@xmath39 and @xmath0 systems . in section iv we extend the results of section iii to the critical states in @xmath36 dimensions and derive the relationship between the branching nonanalyticity in @xmath38 and the fractal dimensionality @xmath3 . in section v the results of numerical simulation on the anderson model are presented .",
    "some open questions are discussed in the conclusions .",
    "a general approach to calculate the @xmath41-corrections using the nonlinear supersymmetric sigma - model @xcite has been suggested in @xcite and applied to the distributions of different quantities @xcite .",
    "it is based on a perturbative analysis of the nonzero diffusion modes which are integrated out to produce @xmath41 corrections to the zero - mode supersymmetric sigma - model @xcite .",
    "the latter must then be handled exactly .    before going into the details of the calculations we would like to formulate the main results for @xmath30 for the case of t - breaking perturbations over the orthogonal ensemble : @xmath42 where @xmath43 here @xmath44 , where @xmath45 , ( @xmath46 ) in the case of the periodic boundary conditions ( for an unperturbed system ) considered in this paper .",
    "a remarkable feature of eqs.([mr]),([c ] ) for @xmath47 is that the _ sign _ of the correction is different for global ( * case i * ) and local ( * case ii * ) t - breaking perturbations .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .    the positive sign at small @xmath48 in * case i * reflects the tendency towards a weaker spectral response to a change in the boundary conditions with decreasing @xmath23 .",
    "it is related to long - range correlations in the wavefunctions that result in mesoscopic fluctuations of the matrix element of perturbation .",
    "the same long - range correlations cause mesoscopic fluctuations of the diffusion coefficient .    the negative sign of the correction @xmath49 for local perturbations [ * case ii * ] is entirely due to the effect of the energy level statistics that lead to mesoscopic fluctuations of the density of states .",
    "the mesoscopic fluctuations of the matrix elements are suppressed in this case , because the effect of long - range correlations of the unperturbed wavefunctions is cut by the local nature of the perturbation .    in order to illustrate the effect of the energy level statistics on the level curvature we invoke the expression for @xmath50 in terms of the matrix element of the perturbation @xmath51 and the exact eigenvalues in the absence of perturbation @xmath52 : @xmath53 from this expression we can clearly identify the two sources of the fluctuations in the level curvature . if the fluctuations of the matrix elements are suppressed , @xmath51 can be replaced by a constant . then there is only one source of fluctuations left , that is the energy level statistics .",
    "notice that _ implicitly _ this contains the effect of the statistics of the _ eigenfunctions _ as well , and in particular , their long - range correlations .",
    "upon decreasing @xmath23 the system of energy levels becomes less and less correlated . in the extreme limit of uncorrelated levels the distribution of curvatures",
    "is known @xcite to become of the cauchy - lorentz form @xmath54 .",
    "since @xmath55 and @xmath56 we conclude that the effect of softening the energy level correlations on the shape of the curvature distribution is such that @xmath57 , in full agreement with the results for the * case ii*.    the principal result of this section is that thouless relationship of proportionality @xmath58 breaks down beyond rmt .",
    "the ratio @xmath59 _ increases _ above its rmt value @xmath60 , the correction being equal to : @xmath61      we know describe how eqs .",
    "( [ mr]),([c ] ) have been obtained .",
    "let us consider a disordered mesoscopic @xmath12-dimensional system with a random white - noise impurity potential @xmath62 perturbed by a small vector - potential @xmath63 .",
    "it is described by the microscopic hamiltonian of the form : @xmath64    in * case i * we assume the sample to be closed into a ring geometry pierced by a small static magnetic flux @xmath65 .",
    "then the effect of the perturbation is equivalent to a twist of the boundary conditions generating the phase @xmath66 ( @xmath67 is the flux quantum ) . as a vector potential",
    "we will take a constant vector of the form @xmath68 .    in the `` local '' * case ii",
    "* we consider @xmath69 to be a random @xmath70-correlated vector - potential : @xmath71 the parameter @xmath6 is introduced in this way in order to keep @xmath72 the same as to the `` global '' curvature ( case i ) .",
    "the curvature distribution function @xmath73 can be expressed in terms the two - level parametric correlation function @xmath74 @xmath75 in a form similar to one derived in ref .",
    "[ ] for the distribution of level velocities : @xmath76 indeed , using the exact expression for the fluctuating density of states @xmath77 we have : @xmath78 because of the level repulsion , in the limit @xmath79 and @xmath80 only terms with @xmath81 contribute to the sum eq.([kz ] ) . on the other hand , with a perturbation which is odd under time reversal , the t - invariant level energy @xmath82 must be even@xcite in @xmath6 . then choosing @xmath83 we immediately arrive at eq.([p - r ] ) .",
    "the two - level correlation function @xmath84 can be represented in the form of a functional integral using the efetov s supersymmetry approach .",

    "we have to separate the zero modes from all other modes and then integrate over all the nonzero modes using a certain perturbative scheme .    following the method suggested by kravtsov and mirlin @xcite we decompose matrices @xmath108 as follows :",
    "@xmath109 where @xmath110 describes the zero mode and @xmath111 does not contain the zero mode at all .    as has been already noticed , the main contribution to the functional integral comes from the zero mode .",

    "next we note that the terms proportional to the first derivative can be absorbed into the function @xmath158 : @xmath164 . in doing",

    "all what is left is the term with the second derivative which describes the change in the _ shape _ of the distribution function .",
    "the final result of these tedious calculations is very simple : @xmath170 this equation means that the rmt curvature distribution @xmath171 plays the role of the generating function for its own corrections .",
    "it has been known for quite a while that the relaxation of current and the local density of states ( dos ) in disordered conductors exhibit an anomaly even in the weak - localization regime .",
    "namely , it has been shown in ref .",
    "[ ] that there exists a small ( but not exponentially small ) probability of finding a current relaxation time or a local dos that is much larger than the corresponding mean values .",
    "these anomalies have been attributed to quasi - localized ( or pre - localized ) states @xcite , that is , states with an anomalously large peak in @xmath34 at some point @xmath172 .",
    "very recently the problem of current relaxation in disordered conductors has been reconsidered @xcite by an elegant instanton approximation @xcite applied to the supersymmetric version of the nonlinear sigma - model@xcite . in these papers",
    "the main result of the previous work @xcite has been confirmed for @xmath0 systems .",

    "later the same idea @xcite has been applied @xcite to find directly the distribution of @xmath173 and the distribution of local densities of states @xcite .",
    "thus the existence of quasi - localized states has been proved and the corresponding configuration of the random impurity potential has been found@xcite .",
    "the main idea of edwards and thouless @xcite is that it is possible to distinguish between localized and extended states by analyzing the sensitivity of the spectrum to a twist of the phase in the boundary conditions .",
    "this sensitivity is significant only for states with a localization radius larger than the sample size @xmath13 and negligible for strongly localized states .",
    "it is clear that the existence of the pre - localized states should lead to an enhancement in @xmath1 at small @xmath174 . in low dimensional systems",
    "@xmath175 where the pre - localized states correspond to localized states with an anomalously small localization radius , one may expect a singularity in @xmath1 at @xmath2 . in @xmath4 metal",
    "the typical pre - localized state looks like a sharp peak in @xmath34 on top of the extended background @xmath176 .",
    "the level curvature that corresponds to such a state does not vanish but only slightly decreases .",
    "thus the pre - localized states in @xmath4 in the weak localization regime should have much weaker effect on the level curvature distribution .      in order to check these predictions",

    "support for the existence of such contributions can be gained by noticing that in the functional representation of @xmath1 , eq.([main ] ) , eq.([f ] ) , the level curvature @xmath48 plays the same role as the frequency in the problem of the current relaxation in disordered conductors @xcite , thus @xmath180 being analogous to time .",
