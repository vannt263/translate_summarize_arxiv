    "geometric random graph models play an emerging role in the modelling of real - world networks such as on - line social networks @xcite , wireless networks @xcite , and the web graph @xcite . in such stochastic models , vertices of the network are represented by points in a suitably chosen metric space , and edges are chosen by a mixture of relative proximity of the vertices and probabilistic rules . in real - world networks ,",
    "the underlying metric space is a representation of the hidden reality that leads to the formation of edges .",
    "such networks can be viewed as embedded in a _ feature space _ , where vertices with similar features are more closely positioned .",
    "for example , in the case of on - line social networks , for example , users are embedded in a high dimensional _ social space _ , where users that are positioned close together in the space exhibit similar characteristics .",
    "the web graph may be viewed in _ topic space _ , where web pages with similar topics are closer to each other .",
    "we note that the theory of random geometric graphs has been extensively developed ( see , for example , @xcite , @xcite , and the books @xcite ) .",
    "the study of countably infinite graphs is motivated in part by the theory of the _ infinite random graph _ , or the _ rado _ graph ( see @xcite ) , written @xmath6 the graph @xmath7 was first discovered by erds and rnyi @xcite , who proved that with probability @xmath8 any two randomly generated countably infinite graphs , where vertices are joined independently with probability @xmath9 , are isomorphic .",
    "the graph @xmath7 has several remarkable properties , such as universality ( all countable graphs are isomorphic to an induced subgraph ) and homogeneity ( every isomorphism between finite induced subgraphs extends to an isomorphism ) .",
    "the investigation of @xmath7 lies at the intersection of logic , probability theory , and topology ; see @xcite and chapter 6 of bonato .",
    "in @xcite we considered infinite random geometric graphs . in our model ,",
    "the vertex set is a countable dense subset of @xmath10 for a fixed @xmath11 and two vertices are adjacent if the distance between the two vertices is no larger than some fixed real number .",
    "more precisely , consider a metric space @xmath12 with metric @xmath13a parameter @xmath14 a countably infinite subset @xmath15 of @xmath12 , and @xmath16 .",
    "the _ local area random graph @xmath17 _ has vertices @xmath18 and for each pair of vertices @xmath19 and @xmath20 with @xmath21 , an edge is added independently with probability @xmath22 .",
    "the model can be similarly defined for @xmath15 finite . for simplicity , we consider only the case when @xmath23 ; we write @xmath24 in this case .",
    "the larg model generalizes well - known classes of random graphs .",
    "for example , special cases of the @xmath25 model include the random geometric graphs , where @xmath26 , and the binomial random graph @xmath27 , where @xmath12 has finite diameter @xmath28 , and @xmath29 .",
    "let @xmath30 be the set of metrics defined on @xmath31 we will say that a metric @xmath32 is _ unpredictable _ if for all dense subsets @xmath15 in @xmath33 such that for all @xmath9 , with positive probability graphs generated by @xmath24 are non - isomorphic .",
    "the results of this paper show that a large class of metrics @xmath32 are unpredictable .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the @xmath34-metric is unpredictable , while the @xmath1-metric is not .",
    "for all @xmath35 it was shown in @xcite that the @xmath36-metric is predictable , while the @xmath34-metric is not ( that is , _ predictable _ : there exists a countable dense set @xmath15 in @xmath37 such that for all @xmath9 , with probability @xmath38 , any two graphs generated by @xmath24 are isomorphic ) .",
    "we have therefore , the following natural classification program for infinite random geometric graphs .    * geometric isomorphism dichotomy ( gid ) * : determine which metrics in @xmath30 are unpredictable .    in the next section ,",
    "we describe our main results which greatly extend our understanding of the gid for a large family of so - called norm derived metrics , which includes all the familiar @xmath4-metrics and the hexagonal metric .",
    "the hexagonal metric arises in the study of voronoi diagrams and period graphs ( see @xcite ) which have found applications to nanotechnology .",
    "we note that in @xcite , it was shown that the hexagonal metrics in the case @xmath2 are unpredictable .",
    "all graphs considered are simple , undirected , and countable unless otherwise stated . given a metric space @xmath12 with distance function @xmath39 , denote the ( open ) _ ball of radius @xmath40 around @xmath41 _ by @xmath42we will sometimes just refer to @xmath43 as a _ @xmath44-ball _ or _ ball of radius _ @xmath44 .",

    "a metric @xmath60 has the _ truncating property _",
    "if for all countable dense sets @xmath15 in @xmath61 , every step - isometry @xmath56 is an isometry . in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that @xmath61 with the @xmath3-metric has the truncating property , but the @xmath62-metric does not .",
    "for example , in the case @xmath63 with the @xmath1-metric , consider the map @xmath64 given by : @xmath65 it is straightforward to check that @xmath66 is a step - isometry , but not an isometry .",
    "our motivations for considering step - isometries is that any isomorphism between graphs generated by the larg model with @xmath9 must be a step - isometry .",
    "we record this fact in the following lemma , which follows directly from theorem  2.1 and corollary  2.5 of @xcite .",
    "[ newlemmm ] for all dense sets @xmath15 and @xmath9 , if @xmath66 is an isomorphism between two graphs generated by the @xmath24 , then with probability @xmath38 , @xmath66 is a step - isometry .    for any dense set @xmath15 in @xmath61 , and metric @xmath39 , there are only a limited number of possibilities to form a bijective isometry from @xmath15 to @xmath15 .",
    "this imposes strong restrictions on any possible isomorphism between graphs with vertex set @xmath15 .",
    "this suggests a close relationship between the truncating property and unpredictability .",
    "we will show that , for the cases we consider , the metrics which are unpredictable are indeed precisely those that have the truncating property .",
    "a metric @xmath39 is _ translation - invariant _ if for all @xmath67 , we have that @xmath68 the metric @xmath39 is _ homogeneous _ if for all @xmath69 , @xmath70 .",
    "any translation - invariant , homogeneous metric @xmath39 induces a norm , given by @xmath71 .",
    "conversely , a norm @xmath72 induces a translation - invariant , homogeneous metric @xmath73 the metrics we consider are precisely those that are derived from norms .",
    "we define a _ norm - derived _ metric as a metric defined by a norm ( referred to as the _ underlying norm _ ) .",
    "a well - studied family of norm - derived metrics consists of metrics derived from the @xmath4 norm , where @xmath74 ; recall that for @xmath75 , @xmath76    it is straightforward to check that the unit ball around @xmath77 of any norm - derived metric @xmath39 must be a convex , point - symmetric set @xmath78 which we call the _ shape _ of @xmath39 .",
    "conversely , a convex , point - symmetric set @xmath79 with non - empty interior defines a norm @xmath80 and a corresponding metric @xmath81 as follows .",
    "fix a vector @xmath82 , and let @xmath83 be the unique point where the ray from @xmath77 to @xmath84 intersects @xmath78 .",
    "then we have that @xmath85 and the metric @xmath81 is defined as @xmath86 observe that the unit ball around @xmath77 of @xmath81 equals @xmath78 .",
    "note that in @xmath61 , for @xmath87 the @xmath4 metric has shape a superellipse or lme curve , while the @xmath62-metric has shape a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes , and the @xmath88-metric has shape a square with the diagonals parallel to the coordinate axes . throughout this paper",
    ", we will use the notation @xmath81 for the norm - derived metric with shape @xmath78 .",
    "we only consider norm - derived metrics whose shape is either a polygon ( and we call such metrics _ polygonal _ ; these include the @xmath4-metrics in the case @xmath89 ) , or metrics whose shape can be described by a smooth curve ( we call such metrics _ smooth _ ; they include the @xmath4 metrics in the case @xmath90 and @xmath91 ) .",
    "we think that the results in this paper apply equally to norm - based metric whose shape has both straight and curved sides , and that this can be proved with methods similar to those presented here .",
    "however , we do not pursue this generalization here , due to the excessive technicalities . to conserve notation ,",
    "_ from now on we denote by @xmath92 the set of all both smooth and polygonal norm - derived metrics in @xmath61_.      we now have defined almost all concepts needed to state our main results , which constitute a classification of all metrics in @xmath92 in terms of predicability and the truncating property .",
    "we next define a special class of polygonal metrics ; our main result will show that this is the class of metrics in @xmath93 which do not have the truncating property .",
    "a metric @xmath94 is a _ box metric _ if its shape is a _ parallelogram_.    [ thm : main ] a metric @xmath94 has the truncating property if and only if @xmath39 is not a box metric .",
    "the proof of the theorem will follow from a series of lemmas presented in section  2 .",
    "the proof considers separately the polygonal and smooth cases .",
    "an important corollary of theorem  [ thm : main ] shows that , in @xmath95 where @xmath81 is not a box metric , three well - chosen points completely determine a step - isometry , as they do an isometry .",
    "for example , if @xmath81 is the @xmath3-metric , then the restriction on the 3 points is that they should not be collinear . for general norm - derived metrics , the restriction is slightly more complicated , and we need some definitions before we can state the corollary .    a set of three points @xmath96 so that @xmath97 is a _ triangular set _",
    "if @xmath98 if @xmath39 is the @xmath3-metric , then @xmath99 forms a triangular set if and only if the points are not collinear ; the same is not true for metrics where the unit ball @xmath78 is a polygon .",
    "for example , let @xmath100 be the metric derived from the @xmath101-norm , and let @xmath102 , @xmath103 , and @xmath104",
    ". then @xmath105 and @xmath106 , so @xmath99 do not form a triangular set , despite the fact they are not collinear .",
    "triangular sets exist in any countable dense set and for any metric @xmath94 which is not a box metric .",
    "namely , fix @xmath107 such that the lines through @xmath84 and @xmath108 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 , and @xmath109 and @xmath84 have slope @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 , respectively .",
    "if @xmath39 is a smooth metric , then if @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 are all different , then @xmath113 is a triangular set . if @xmath39 is a polygonal metric , and if the lines through the origin with slopes @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 intersect @xmath78 in three different , non - parallel sides , then @xmath113 is a triangular set .",
    "it follows immediately from the properties of norm - derived metrics that triangular sets have the following _ anchoring property _ : if @xmath15 is a set dense in @xmath61 and @xmath114 is a triangular set , and if @xmath56 an isometry , then the images under @xmath66 of the points in @xmath12 completely determine the map @xmath66 .",
    "( the argument can be found explicitly in the proof of theorem  [ non2 ] . )",
    "hence , images of triangular sets completely determine the images of points of @xmath15 under an isometry .",
    "thus , it follows as corollary from theorem  [ thm : main ] that if @xmath39 is not a box metric , then triangular sets have the anchoring property if only the truncated distances are given .",
    "[ cor:3pts ] let @xmath15 be a countable dense set and let @xmath114 be a triangular set , and let @xmath94 be a norm - based metric which is not a box metric .",
    "then for every step - isometry @xmath56 , the images under @xmath66 of the points in @xmath12 completely determine @xmath66 .    by theorem  [ thm : main ]",
    ", the step - isometry @xmath66 is an isometry .",
    "the points of @xmath12 completely determine , therefore , the position of all points in @xmath15 .",
    "the proof now follows since the image of a triangular set under an isometry is also a triangular set .",
    "thus , if the coordinates of the points in @xmath12 are given , and for all other points in @xmath15 the truncated distance to each of the points in @xmath12 is given , then the coordinates of all points in @xmath15 are determined .",
    "arguments involving infinite graphs can be used with corollary [ cor:3pts ] to prove the following theorem , which settles the gid for the @xmath4-metrics and polygonal metrics on @xmath61 .",
    "[ non2 ] let @xmath39 be a metric in @xmath92 .",
    "then @xmath39 is predictable if and only if it is a box metric .",
    "we defer the proof to the end of section  2 .",
    "we conjecture that analogous results as in theorem  [ non2 ] apply to higher dimensions and other norm - derived metrics .",
    "we will consider these cases in future work .",
    "the theorem classifies all metrics in @xmath92 in terms of predictability .",
    "we remind the reader that the definition of predictability involves an existential quantifier : the definitions involve the behaviour of @xmath115 on a dense subset @xmath15 , where @xmath15 must have special properties .",
    "in fact , however , the conditions on @xmath15 needed to prove the theorem are rather mild .",
    "in fact , if @xmath15 is a random dense set , chosen according to a `` reasonable '' model , then @xmath15 will possess the desired properties with probability 1 .",
    "for example @xmath15 can be the countable union of sets each chosen from @xmath61 according to a poisson point process .",
    "another example is the extension to @xmath61 of the random dense set model proposed in @xcite for @xmath116 , by first taking the union of an infinite number of such sets for the intervals @xmath117 where @xmath118 , and then taking the cartesian product of two of such unions .",
    "in this section , we will sketch the proofs of theorems [ thm : main ] and theorem  [ non2 ] , and give the sequence of lemmas needed to arrive at the proofs .      before we proceed to an outline of the proof of theorem  [ thm : main ] , we first introduce some notation and concepts that apply to all norm - derived metrics , and will be helpful in the rest of the paper .",
    "note first that it follows directly from the definition that for any point - symmetric convex set @xmath78 with boundary @xmath119 , and for any @xmath82 , we have that @xmath120    for a polygonal metric @xmath121 , we can use the description of the polygon to compute the norm and distance .",

    "this means that , if @xmath78 is centered at @xmath109 , then the line segment @xmath141 intersects @xmath78 in @xmath142 .",
    "moreover , the same is true if @xmath78 is enlarged by a factor @xmath143 ( as long as it remains centered at @xmath109 . ) also , if @xmath144 is a version of @xmath78 enlarged by a factor @xmath143 and centered at @xmath109 , and so that @xmath140 lies on the boundary of @xmath78 , then @xmath140 will lie on the enlarged version of @xmath145 .",
