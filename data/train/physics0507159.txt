    "the topic of money dynamics recently attracted considerable research interest within statistical physics @xcite . motivated by the initial work of vilfredo pareto in 1897 on distribution of income among people in some countries@xcite and some recent empirical observations of econophysicists @xcite , several money transfer models have been developed for the equilibrium money distribution based on the analogy between market economics and kinetic theory of gases @xcite .",
    "adrian drgulescu and victor yakovenko proposed a model of agents exchanging randomly in a closed economy and demonstrated that the equilibrium probability distribution of money follows the exponential boltzmann - gibbs law due to time - reversal symmetry and conservation of money @xcite .",
    "the research group of bikas k. chakrabarti investigated the statistical mechanics of money similarly , considering effects of the saving behavior of the agents @xcite .",
    "based on these studies of the subject , wang _ et.al . _",
    "introduced a new aspect of the problem : the probability distribution of money holding times @xcite .",
    "these works expand the scope of such investigations from focusing on the static distribution of money to discussing the circulation of money .",
    "the velocity of money circulation is a central matter in monetary theory which has attracted much attention for hundreds of years@xcite .",
    "although exploration of the velocity can be traced backward to the earlier works in 1660s@xcite , most of current investigations of velocity is commonly attributed to irving fisher who presented an influential exchange equation @xmath0 , where m is the amount of money in circulation , v is the velocity of circulation of money , p is the average price level and y is the level of real income @xcite . from this equation ,",
    "the velocity of money can be computed as the ratio of transaction volume or aggregate income to money stock .",
    "basing on this equation , many theoretical and empirical research works on the velocity have been carried out to examine its determinants@xcite . however , the fisher equation just proposed a definition and a measurement of velocity in any way , it could not uncover the intrinsic properties of the velocity .",
    "it resembles ohm s law , though with the help of the equation @xmath1 , resistance @xmath2 can be calculated by dividing supplied voltage @xmath3 by consequent current @xmath4 , it is determined by its internal characteristics , rather than those two variables . just as rothbard@xcite reminds us , `` it is absurd to dignify any quantity with a place in an equation unless it can be defined independently of the other terms in the equation . ''",
    "thus , by analogy with resistance , the velocity must have a `` life of its own '' characterized by the money holders .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to analyze the circulation velocity of money on the base of micro analysis . in our recent work ,",
    "the velocity was expressed as a statistical function of holding time of money@xcite .",
    "this relation provides a novel channel through which the velocity can be determined by individual goal - directed behavior . with the help of the life - cycle hypothesis ,",
    "an alternative approach without taking any aggregate macroeconomic variables into account is presented for examining the monetary velocity .",
    "to use money , people must hold money .",
    "however , what they are holding now must be spent on something on certain moment later , so a given amount of money can be used again and again to finance people s purchases of goods and services . in other words ,",
    "the money one person spends for goods and services at any given moment can be used later by the recipient of that money to purchase yet other goods and services . as a result , there must be an interval of time between the receipt of income and its disbursement over which money is held .",
    "this interval was ever called the `` average period of idleness '' or `` interval of rest '' of money by wicksell@xcite .",
    "it is obvious that the interval is not a character of money itself , but a character of its holder s behavior in utilizing the money .",
    "as mises@xcite has made clear , `` money can be in the process of transportation , it can travel in trains , ships , or planes from one place to another .",
    "but it is in this case , too , always subject to somebody s control , is somebody s property . ''",
    "so we called it holding time of money , placing emphasis on the prefix _",
    "the length of holding time is determined by the holder s motives to use money which are usually sorted into three types within the theory of money demand : the transactions - motive , the precautionary - motive and the speculative - motive@xcite . at any given moment , money in an economy may have different holding times , due to either different holders or various motives of holding money .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that money spreads over the domain of holding times ( @xmath5 ) . under continuous assumption",
    ", there must be a portion of money @xmath6 whose holding time is between @xmath7 and @xmath8 @xmath9 is defined as the probability density of money which has the following property    @xmath10    we know that the distribution of money over the holding time in an economy evolves with time .",
    "that is to say , the holding time of the same unit of money may be altered at different moment due to the alteration of holder . under certain conditions",
    "we can get an equilibrium state where the distribution of money over holding time is stationary . in this state ,",
    "any single money s holding time may strongly fluctuate over time , but the overall probability distribution of money does not change .    given a stationary distribution of money over the holding time , we then have two variables which are related to each other .",
    "the first one is average holding time of money @xmath11 which is defined as the expectation of the holding time of money , i.e. , @xmath12the second one is the circulation velocity of money which can be expressed by the mathematical expectation of @xmath13 as follows@xcite    @xmath14    it follows immediately that the velocity is inversely related to the average holding time .    since money is identical for participating trade in an economy , it is always spent randomly in exchange process .",
    "thus the exchange process for money is of poisson type , and the probability density function of money takes the following form@xcite    @xmath15    where @xmath16 corresponds to the intensity of the poisson process . with a few manipulations we get @xmath17this simple and explicit expression gives an intuitive view of the inverse relation between the velocity and the average holding time : the longer average holding time of money , the smaller the velocity of money , and vice versa .    at first glance",
    ", this relationship does not bring forth anything new since holding time and velocity of money are just different sides of the same coin .",
    "however , the relationship implies that all the impacts of factors associated with the velocity must takes their effects through influencing people s choices of holding time .",
    "thus , the velocity of money could be investigated by examining how economic agents make decisions on the holding time of money . as we will illustrate in the later sections ,",
    "this viewpoint of monetary circulation can open a new venue to identifying the determinants of the velocity .",
    "an economic system consists of various agents who may utilize money , such as consumers , firms , and investors etc .",
    "each kind of agents has its own character when they make economic decisions involved with money . to calculate the average holding time of money in an economy",
    ", we should first consider separately various behavior patterns of these agents according to their respective motives of holding money , and then put them together .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to show how the holding time can link the economic decisions and the velocity of money .",
    "thus we choose only one kind of agents , consumers , as a representative to examine how their spending decisions could be reflected by the velocity . the available model for analyzing such kind of agents",
    "is the life - cycle hypothesis which is well - known in economics .",
    "the popular life - cycle hypothesis was produced by franco modigliani , richard brumberg and albert ando which has been so far used as a theoretical basis for many empirical investigations@xcite .",
    "the primary theme of this hypothesis is to examine why people save and why the amount they do .",
    "the model considers a representative individual who expects to live @xmath18 years more , whose lifetime utility is @xmath19 where  @xmath20 is the instantaneous utility function with the following properties    @xmath21    and @xmath22 is consumption in time @xmath23 .",
    "the individual has initial wealth of @xmath24 and expects to earn labor income @xmath25 in the working periods of his or her life .",
    "the individual can save or borrow at an exogenous interest rate , subject only to the constraint that any outstanding debt must be repaid at the end of his or her life . for simplicity ,",
    "the interest rate is set to zero .",
    "thus the individual s budget constraint is    @xmath26    the individual is maximizing the lifetime utility eq .",
    "( [ utility ] ) subject to the budget condition eq .",
    "( [ constraint ] ) .",
    "we can solve this constrained optimization problem by using the lagrangian method .",
    "the corresponding lagrangian is given by    @xmath27,\\ ] ]    where @xmath28 is the lagrange multiplier .",
    "the first - order condition for @xmath29 is    @xmath30    since ( [ firstcond ] ) holds in every moment , the marginal utility of consumption is constant . and",
    "since the level of consumption uniquely determines its marginal utility , this means that consumption must be constant .",
    "thus we have @xmath31 for all @xmath23 . substituting this fact into the budget constraint yields    @xmath32 . \\label{consumption}\\ ] ]    the results indicate that people want to smooth their consumption even though their income may fluctuate in their life time .",
    "it is worth to note that the life - cycle hypothesis is a purely microeconomic theory . along with `` permanent income '' hypothesis which was formulated by milton friedman@xcite ,",
    "it builds microeconomic footings for the consumption function in which behavior is goal - directed .",
    "thus this hypothesis can be regard as the micro - foundation of total consumption which is a part of aggregate demand . in this model",
    ", we can see that no aggregate variable appears , so according to the exchange equation proposed by fisher it seems that the life - cycle hypothesis could not provide anything useful for analyzing the velocity of money .",
    "however , as we will illustrate below , with the help of the concept of holding time of money , the micro - foundation of velocity can also be constructed upon this hypothesis .",
    "for simplicity of exposition , we adopt a very simple version of life - cycle model where an individual will work for only @xmath33 periods in his life , within which his labor income @xmath34 , and has no income in the left retiring periods . assuming the individual begins with assets of @xmath35 and dies with assets of @xmath36",
    ", he will then have a amount of @xmath37 that can be spent in his entire life . from equation ( [ consumption ] )",
    ", we can see that he will be able to spend @xmath38 each time unit .    in this case ,",
    "money is the sole form of the individual s assets , and there is a complete receipt - payment process of money in the individual s entire life , in which the income @xmath25 is the inflow of money and consumption expending @xmath22 is the outflow .",
    "thus the average holding time of money corresponds to the delay time in this process , which can be computed by the following form    @xmath39t\\,dt}{\\int% \\nolimits_{0}^{t}y(t)\\,dt}.   \\label{delaytime}\\ ] ]    in the model above the average holding time in the period of lifetime can thus be obtained as follows    @xmath40    according to equation ( [ relation ] ) we then get    @xmath41    from this result we can see that the velocity of money depends reversely on the difference between the expected length of life and that of working periods .",
    "the larger the difference is , the smaller the velocity , and vice versa .    now consider a special case directly follows from equations ( [ avdelay ] ) and ( [ valueofv ] ) .",
    "when @xmath42 which means that there is no retirement for the individual , so that we have @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "this implies that as soon as people receive the money they would pay them out immediately .",
    "this result is obviously unreasonable , since it originates from a strict assumption that income is injected into people s account consecutively as a flow .",
    "however , people get their salary or income discretely in reality .",
    "so we can assume that total wealth the individual gets in his life is as the same as above , i.e. , @xmath37 , but the income is paid at equal time intervals to the individual . assuming that there is @xmath45 times income paying in the working periods , then at each time the amount he gets is @xmath46 , and the average interval for paying is @xmath47 .",
    "after these assumptions being considered , the labor income takes the following form    @xmath48    where @xmath49 is delta function and @xmath50    in this case , according to equation ( [ consumption ] ) the individual s consumption over the lifetime is still smooth . substituting these facts into equation ( [ delaytime ] ) ,",
    "we obtain    @xmath51    from this result we can see even when @xmath42 the average holding time becomes @xmath52 rather than @xmath43 , in accordance with the reality .",
    "the results we have obtained in this model indicate that the velocity depends on neither amplitude of income nor other characteristics of the individual , but only the time pattern of income and expending .",
    "thus we can conclude that the velocity is an independent entity and has a `` life of its own . ''",
    "although the velocity is always value of aggregate transactions divided into money stock , it is the velocity which determines the aggregate transactions , rather than the reverse .",
    "even though this conclusion is restricted by the specific assumptions of the life - cycle model , it still holds by altering and/or adding some other variables when the assumption is relaxed into a more general case .",
    "what this simple version of life - cycle model conveys us is how people distribute their income to their spending plan .",
    "this plan can last for a certain period such as whole life in this model , it can also last for a shorter or a longer one . meanwhile , the income can be allocated to various spending plans which may have different planning periods . whether the time period of plan is long or short ,",
    "so long as the time pattern of income is given , the time pattern of consumption expenditure can be obtained by maximizing the representative individual s goal .",
    "then the average holding time is given by equation ( [ delaytime ] ) . as a result ,",
    "the micro - foundation for velocity of money has been constructed .",
    "strictly speaking , the velocity we obtained above corresponds to consumption velocity rather than the ratio of gdp ( gross domestic product ) to the money stock . in order to cover the whole velocity , other main components of gdp , such as investment and government spending , should also be included .",
    "as mentioned above , the average holding time of money in the whole economy is determined not only by consumers but also the other economic agents behaviors .",
    "whatever the economic agents are , according to the method we provide above , the corresponding average holding time can be deduced from their own optimal choice .",
    "therefore , the theories of consumption and investment in macroeconomics provide micro - foundation not only for aggregate demand but also for the circulation velocity of money .",
    "we have proposed an alternative approach for understanding the velocity of money circulation on the base of micro analysis .",
    "a concept of holding time of money has been introduced to reflect money holders behavior .",
    "it is found that the velocity of money can be expressed by a mathematical expectation value of the inverse of holding time of money .",
    "the velocity and the average holding time are reversely related to each other and the main determinant of them is the agents behaviors .",
    "this relationship suggests that the micro - foundation of the velocity can be constructed by examining a representative individual behavior . employing the life - cycle hypothesis",
    ", we demonstrate that the average holding time can be obtained by maximizing the representative individual s lifetime utility .",
    "the velocity is found to be determined by the time pattern of income and dispense which results from the individual s optimal choice .",
    "we believe that this study promises a fresh insight into the velocity of money circulation .",
