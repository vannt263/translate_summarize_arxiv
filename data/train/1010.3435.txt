    "in this paper we consider the nonlinear equations @xmath12 arising from nonlinear inverse problems , where @xmath13 is a nonlinear frchet differentiable operator between two hilbert spaces @xmath14 and @xmath15 whose norms and inner products are denoted as @xmath16 and @xmath17 respectively .",
    "we assume that ( [ 1 ] ) has a solution @xmath18 in the domain @xmath19 of @xmath8 , i.e. @xmath20 .",
    "we use @xmath21 to denote the frchet derivative of @xmath8 at @xmath22 and @xmath23 the adjoint of @xmath21 .",
    "a characteristic property of such problems is their ill - posedness in the sense that their solutions do not depend continuously on the data .",
    "since the right hand side @xmath24 is usually obtained by measurement , the only available data is a noise @xmath2 satisfying @xmath25 with a given small noise level @xmath26 . due to the ill - posedness , it is challenging to produce from @xmath2 a stable approximate solution to @xmath18 and the regularization techniques must be taken into account .",
    "many regularization methods have been considered for solving ( [ 1 ] ) in the last two decades .",
    "tikhonov regularization is one of the well - known methods that have been studied extensively in the literature . due to the straightforward implementation ,",
    "iterative methods are also attractive for solving nonlinear inverse problems . in this paper",
    "we will consider a class of inexact newton methods . to motivate , let @xmath27 be a current iterate .",
    "we may approximate @xmath28 by its linearization around @xmath27 , i.e. @xmath29 .",
    "thus , instead of ( [ 1 ] ) we have the approximate equation @xmath30 if @xmath31 is invertible , the usual newton method defines the next iterate by solving ( [ nt ] ) for @xmath32 .",
    "computing the exact solution of ( [ nt ] ) however can be expensive in general even the problem is well - posed .",
    "thus , one might prefer to compute some approximate solution at certain accuracy and use it as the next iterate .",
    "this motivates the inexact newton methods in @xcite where for well - posed problems the convergence was carried out when the next computed iterate @xmath33 satisfies @xmath34 at each step with the forcing terms @xmath35 being uniformly bounded below @xmath36 . for nonlinear ill - posed inverse problems , @xmath31 in general",
    "is not invertible and ( [ nt ] ) usually is ill - posed .",
    "therefore one should use the regularization methods to solve ( [ nt ] ) approximately .",
    "let @xmath9 be a family of spectral filter functions .",
    "we can apply the linear regularization method defined by @xmath9 to ( [ nt ] ) to produce the next iterate .",
    "this leads to the following inexact newton method @xmath37 where @xmath38 is an initial guess of @xmath18 and @xmath7 is a sequence of positive numbers . by taking @xmath39 to be various functions , ( [ 2 ] )",
    "then produces the nonlinear landweber iteration @xcite , the levenberg - marquardt method @xcite , the exponential euler iteration @xcite , and the first - stage runge - kutta type regularization @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will consider the inexact newton method ( [ 2 ] ) in a unified way by assuming that @xmath7 is an a priori given sequence of positive numbers with suitable properties .",
    "we will terminate the iteration by the discrepancy principle @xmath40 with a given number @xmath6 and consider the approximation property of @xmath10 to @xmath18 as @xmath11 . for a large class of spectral filter functions @xmath9 we will establish the convergence of @xmath10 to @xmath18 as @xmath11 and derive the order optimal convergence rates for the method defined by ( [ 2 ] ) and ( [ dp ] ) .",
    "our work not only reproduces those known results in @xcite but also presents new convergence results and new methods .",
    "furthermore , our convergence analysis provides new insights into the feature of the inexact newton regularization methods .    in the definition of the inexact newton method",
    ", one may determine the sequence @xmath7 adaptively during computation .",
    "in @xcite the levenberg - marquardt scheme was considered with @xmath7 chosen adaptively so that ( [ m2 ] ) holds and the discrepancy principle was used to terminate the iteration .",
    "the order optimal convergence rates were derived recently in @xcite .",
    "the general methods ( [ 2 ] ) with @xmath7 chosen adaptively to satisfy ( [ m2 ] ) were considered later in @xcite , but only suboptimal convergence rates were derived in @xcite and the convergence analysis is far from complete .",
    "the methods of the present paper is essentially different in that the sequence @xmath7 is given in an a priori way which has the advantage of saving computational work .",
    "we hope , however , the work of the present paper can provide better understanding on the methods with @xmath7 chosen adaptively .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we first formulate the conditions on @xmath7 , @xmath9 and @xmath8 , and state the main results on the convergence and rates of convergence for the methods defined by ( [ 2 ] ) and ( [ dp ] ) , we then give several examples of iteration methods that fit into the framework ( [ 2 ] ) . in section 3",
