    "the phenomenon of thermal dna denaturation can be interpreted in terms of mesoscopic , one - dimensional , statistical or nonlinear lattice - dynamical models .",
    "models of the first type , based on the equilibrium statistical mechanics of the helix - coil transition , proposed and solved long ago by poland and scheraga ( ps ) @xcite have been extensively studied , refined and developed by subsequent research ; this substantial effort , incorporating a large body of enthalpic data , has led to algorithms for the detailed prediction of melting profiles with a rich internal structure @xcite ; as a result , the microscopic parametrization of this family of models is well advanced @xcite .",
    "models of the second type , first proposed by peyrard , bishop and dauxois ( pbd ) @xcite were largely motivated by the study of dynamical properties , in particular those associated with the local breathing of dna which characterizes the initiation of the transcription process ; in the limiting case of infinite , homogeneous chains they describe dna denaturation as an exact , one - dimensional thermodynamic phase transition @xcite , whose effective ( observable ) order is controlled by the strength of the nonlinear base - stacking interaction @xcite and can be followed in detail by finite - size scaling analysis @xcite .",
    "curiously , although this type of model is uniquely suited @xcite to describe the sharp multistep melting process taking place at long sequences , where the effects of cooperativity are most likely to be correctly modeled with a small set of coupling parameters , comparisons of pbd - based dna melting curves with experimental data have been confined to relatively short chains where multiphase melting is either absent @xcite or marginal @xcite . as a result ,",
    "one of the major potential sources of experimental validation of the pbd model remains unexplored .",
    "in this paper i will present an analysis of melting profiles based on the standard version of the pbd model @xcite for a number of specific sequences with many thousands of base pairs .",
    "i will use the parameters obtained by fitting two sets of published experimental data corresponding to different ionic contents , the pbr322 plasmid and the t7 phage melting profiles , to estimate the parameters variation with ionic content .",
    "this procedure provides model parameters for any ionic content in the usual experimental range and thus paves the way for predicting the melting profile of any long dna sequence .",
    "i present predicted melting profiles with no adjustable parameters and compare them with experimental data in three cases : the complete fd - phage , and the y1 and y2 fragments of the @xmath1 phage .",
    "the computed profiles , although not perfect , reflect accurately many of the actual complexities of sequence - dependent melting .",
    "furthermore , the set of parameters obtained by fitting the melting profiles can be used to predict the probability of single base - pair opening at ambient temperatures .",
    "the calculated values , in the order of @xmath2 ppm , are in line with estimates obtained from imino proton exchange measurements @xcite . in summary",
    ", the pbd model seems to provide an excellent mesoscopic , dynamically motivated framework for the quantitative description of genomic dna melting ; this could be of particular use in further work where the model enjoys a comparative advantage , e.g. in extending the study of local dna flexibility @xcite to longer sequences .",
    "the configurational energy of a chain of @xmath3 base pairs is @xmath4 where the transverse coordinate @xmath5 represents the separation of the two bases at the @xmath6th site , the anharmonic elastic term @xmath7(y_j - y_{j+1})^2 \\label{eq : stack}\\ ] ] models the nonlinear base - stacking interaction , and the on - site morse potential @xmath8 describes the combined effects of hydrogen - bonding , stacking and solvent acting on the @xmath6th base pair .",
    "i will use the same parameter values @xmath9",
    "ev/@xmath10 for the linear part of the base stacking interaction , @xmath11 for the inverse range of the nonlinear base stacking , and @xmath12 , @xmath13 for the inverse ranges of the morse potentials for all sequences discussed in this paper ; @xmath14 , the relative strength of the nonlinear base stacking will be set equal to @xmath15 , which is roughly comparable to the ratio of accepted values for the bending stiffness of double - stranded and single - stranded dna@xcite .",
    "this leaves only the depths of the morse potential @xmath16 and @xmath17 to be determined from the data ( cf .",
    "furthermore , i will assume that the chain is subject to free - end boundary conditions .",
    "key thermodynamic quantities of interest are ( i ) the partition function @xmath18 and ( ii ) the probability that the @xmath19th base pair is bound , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath22 the temperature and @xmath23 is an appropriately chosen displacement which distinguishes the open ( @xmath24 ) from the closed ( @xmath25 ) state of a base pair .",
    "unless otherwise stated , the choice will be @xmath26 .    as has been extensively discussed in the literature (",
    "e.g. @xcite ) the partition function ( [ eq : z ] ) diverges because of the flat top of the morse potential ; however , this divergence - ultimately responsible for the occurrence of an exact phase transition in the thermodynamic limit - is restricted to the disordered phase@xcite ; as a result , ( [ eq : probb ] ) is always well defined - and can be shown to be numerically stable , i.e. independent of any upper cutoff of the integrations - for sufficiently long chains @xcite .",
    "numerical work was based on expanding @xcite each factor in the partition function in terms of the complete set of eigenstates of the integral equation @xmath27 with @xmath28/k_bt}$ ] serving as a referencekernel .",
    "this transforms the multidimensional integrals in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : z ] ) and ( [ eq : probb ] ) into matrix products in the reduced space of eigenstates of ( [ eq : ti ] ) - typically of dimension 30 - 100 if one keeps only eigenstates with @xmath29 ; the resulting matrix products can be calculated quite rapidly if one stores the intermediate results .",
    "numerical computations have been performed by substituting the lower and upper limits of integration by @xmath30 ( owing to the rapid vanishing of the kernel which originates in the repulsive core of the morse potential ) and @xmath31 , respectively ; extending the region of integration in either direction does not produce any detectable change in the resulting melting profiles .",
    "[ eq : ti ] has been discretized using gauss - legendre quadratures with a mesh of @xmath32 points .",
    "further numerical details will be reported elsewhere .",
    "the fraction of unbound ( `` melted '' ) base pairs is given by @xmath33 fig .",

    "although not in perfect agreement with the experimental ones , reflect to a considerable extent the latter s complexities .",
    "note in particular the multipeak structure on the left panel , and the correct overall shape of the melting curve on the right panel .",
    "the superimposed melting map shown in the left panel ( melting temperatures , in steps of @xmath42 k , uniquely defined for each base pair via @xmath43=1/2 $ ] ) exhibits the distinct vertical regions known from statistical ( ps - type ) theories of dna denaturation to coincide with peaks of the melting profile and to characterize cooperative melting of large domains , extending over hundreds of base pairs .    a careful analysis of the critical behavior of pure at and gc sequences reveals essentially linear dependence of the melting temperature on @xmath44 in the range of interest .",
    "since @xmath45 is known @xcite to depend logarithmically on @xmath46 , it is natural to assume that @xmath47 where @xmath48 , and use the two sets of morse depth parametes to extract estimates of the proportionality constants , @xmath49 ev and @xmath50 ev , respectively @xcite .",
