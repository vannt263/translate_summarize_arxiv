    "near earth asteroid 4179 toutatis is an apollo - type object and categorized as a potentially hazardous asteroid ( pha ) .",
    "it has a highly eccentric orbit , approximately 4:1 resonant with the earth .",
    "it was firstly discovered in 1934 and the rediscovery took place in 1989 .",
    "it has closely encountered the earth every four years during the last decade , enabling a variety of ground - based assessments .",
    "radar observations generated by arecibo and goldstone reveal the irregular shape with two lobes and the tumbling , non - principal axis ( npa ) rotating state of the asteroid @xcite .",
    "@xcite calculated two rotational periods of the complicated spin state , which were 7.3 and 3.1 days using optical data acquired during 1992 flyby .",
    "meanwhile , they were determined to be 5.41 days and 7.35 days based on radar observations @xcite .",
    "@xcite pointed out that this tumbling rotation may be primordial .",
    "@xcite used 1996 near - earth approach radar observations to determine the two major rotational periods , which were estimated to be @xmath5 days and @xmath6 days .",
    "@xcite established a dynamical model of rotation and calculated the spin state parameters using radar observations during five flybys from 1992 to 2008 .",
    "the first space - based optical observation of toutatis was obtained by the second chinese lunar probe change-2 at a distance of @xmath7 meters at the end of 2012 @xcite .",
    "over 400 images were captured during the outbound flyby , through which we estimated toutatis orbit , dimensions and orientations .",
    "the three - dimensional shape model derived from radar observations @xcite , as shown in figure 1a , is used to match the optical image acquired by change-2 ( figure 1b ) and calculate the euler angles at the flyby epoch @xcite . taking the camera s orientation , the sun - asteroid - spacecraft angle and render situations into accounts ,",
    "we rotate the radar shape model about its principal axes at an interval of @xmath8 for each of the three euler angles and use image matching procedure to obtain the orientation parameters .",
    "the simulated euler angles are    @xmath9        in combination with radar observations during 1992 - 2008 @xcite , we use the least - squares method to simulate evolution of rotational dynamics of toutatis .",
    "the external gravitation torques exerted by the sun , the earth and the moon were taken into consideration to establish the rotational dynamical model .",
    "the simulated residuals of spin parameters were normalized with respect to the radar observational errors and they all located in @xmath10 region .",
    "our simulation results reveal that the orientation of angular momentum axis could be indicated by ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) in the ecliptic coordinate system , which has remained nearly unchanged in space over the past two decades .",
    "figure 2 shows the variation of longitude and latitude of this orientation due to distance from the sun for the past more than twenty years , the variation amplitudes are less than one degree in both cases .",
    "the slight misalignment of both curves originates from the 2004 near - earth flyby at a distance of about 4 earth - moon distance .",
    "the precession amplitude is determined to be approximately @xmath13 , which results in significantly different attitudes as observed from earth at different epochs .",
    "amplitudes of external gravitation torques and the resulting momentum variations are also simulated in our calculation @xcite , see also ji et al 2015 , this volume ) .",
    "solar tides plays the most important role in the past two decades and near earth flybys always led to slight changes .    by applying fourier transform ,",
    "the latitudinal variations of the asteroid s long and middle axes in the j2000 ecliptic frame ( as figure 3 shows ) is simulated to determine the two rotational periods , which are 5.38 days for the rotation and 7.40 days for precession @xcite .",
    "these results are in good agreement with the previous results reported by @xcite .",
    "( upper ) and middle axis @xmath14 ( lower ) in the j2000 inertial coordinate system in 1992.,width=326 ]",
    "in this work , we used three - dimensional shape model derived from radar observations to establish the transformation relations between inertial frame , body - fixed frame , spacecraft frame and instrument s frame .",
    "then we obtained a 3 - 1 - 3 euler angles of the conversion matrix from the celestial coordinate to the body - fixed frame , which are @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the angular momentum orientation is determined to be @xmath11 and @xmath12 , which is considered to be unchanged for the past two decades .",
    "fourier analysis is used to obtain the two major rotational periods , which are @xmath3 and @xmath4 days , respectively .",
