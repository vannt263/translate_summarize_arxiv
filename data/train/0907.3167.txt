    "in august 2003 , the belle collaboration discovered a new @xmath5 meson that they named the @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this marked the beginning of a new era in @xmath5 meson spectroscopy in which discoveries at the @xmath6 factories have tripled the number of known @xmath5 mesons above the charm meson pair threshold .",
    "of these new @xmath5 mesons , the @xmath0 remains the one for which by far the most experimental information is available .",
    "still the nature of this state is not universally recognized in the high energy physics community .",
    "there are two crucial pieces of experimental information that determine the nature of the @xmath0 unambiguously .",
    "one is its mass as measured in the @xmath1 decay mode . by combining the most recent measurements by the belle , babar , and cdf collaborations @xcite , its mass is determined to be @xmath7 mev .",
    "this mass is extremely close to the @xmath8 threshold .",
    "the energy relative to the threshold is @xmath9 mev .",
    "the central value corresponds to a bound state with binding energy @xmath10 mev .",
    "the second crucial piece of information is the @xmath11 quantum numbers .",
    "observations of decays into @xmath12 and @xmath13 by the belle and babar collaborations @xcite imply that @xmath14 is even under charge conjugation .",
    "the spin and parity quantum numbers have been constrained by the belle and cdf collaborations @xcite from studies of the angular distributions in @xmath1 decays .",
    "the cdf analysis is compatible only with @xmath15 and @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the possibility @xmath16 is disfavored by the observation of the decay into @xmath13 @xcite , because it would have to overcome multipole suppression .",
    "the possibility @xmath16 is also disfavored by the observation of decays into @xmath8 by the belle and babar collaborations @xcite , because it would have to overcome angular - momentum suppression associated with the tiny energy relative to the @xmath8 threshold .",
    "we will assume from now on that the quantum numbers of the @xmath0 are @xmath17 .",
    "given that its quantum numbers are @xmath17 , the @xmath0 has an s - wave coupling to the charm meson pairs @xmath8 and @xmath18 .",
    "the closeness of the mass to the @xmath19 threshold implies that it is a resonant coupling .",
    "this state is therefore governed by the universal properties of s - wave threshold resonances that are predicted by nonrelativistic quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "we can conclude that the @xmath0 is a charm meson molecule whose constituents are a superposition of @xmath8 and @xmath18 . among the universal properties of this molecule",
    "is that the root - mean - square separation of its constituents is @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the reduced mass of the @xmath8 .",
    "the tiny binding energy @xmath22 implies a large rms separation , with the central value 0.25  mev corresponding to an astonishing rms separation of about 6 fermis .",
    "some of the confusion regarding the nature of the @xmath0 has been prompted by measurements of the @xmath2 and @xmath23 decay modes @xcite . in the most recent analyses by the babar and belle collaborations ,",
    "these decay modes have been analyzed as if they were decays into @xmath8 and @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the resulting energy distribution must by definition vanish below the @xmath8 threshold and it has a peak just above the threshold .",
    "measurements of the position and width of this peak have been interpreted incorrectly as measurements of the mass and width of the @xmath0 .",
    "for example , in the 2008 edition of the review of particle physics @xcite , the particle data group determined their average for the mass of the @xmath0 by combining four values below the threshold from @xmath1 decays with two values above the threshold from @xmath2 and @xmath23 decays . in the pdg average mass ,",
    "the 3.5 sigma discrepancy between these two sets of measurements was taken into account by increasing the error by a scale factor of 2.5 .",
    "the particle data group also took as their average for the decay width of the @xmath0 the width of the @xmath8 energy distribution measured by the babar collaboration .",
    "several authors have misinterpreted the measurements of the @xmath2 decay modes as evidence that the @xmath0 is not a bound state with mass below the @xmath8 threshold but instead as a `` virtual state '' which is unbound @xcite .",
    "the signature for a virtual state associated with an s - wave threshold resonance is an enhancement in the production of @xmath8 just above the threshold together with the absence of a resonance in @xmath2 below the threshold .",
    "this should be contrasted with a bound state , whose signature is a similar enhancement above the threshold together with a resonance below the threshold . in misinterpreting the @xmath2 data as evidence for a virtual state , the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite did not take into account that a bound state of @xmath8 can decay into @xmath2 and @xmath23 through decays of its constituent @xmath24 or @xmath25 .",
    "this conceptual error was pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , and an analysis that takes proper account of the bound state was carried out .    in this paper",
    ", we carry out analyses of the recent data from the babar and belle collaborations on the @xmath0 resonance in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 decay channels .",
    "we begin in section  [ sec : ls - short ] by describing the line shape of an s - wave threshold resonance in a short - distance decay channel , such as the @xmath1 decay mode of @xmath0 . in section  [ sec : psipipi ] , we use that line shape to analyze the most recent data from the belle and babar collaborations on the @xmath1 decay channel .",
    "we proceed in section  [ sec : ls - long ] to describe the line shape of @xmath0 in the @xmath2 decay channel , which involves the decay of a constituent . in section  [ sec : ddpi ] , we use that line shape to analyze the most recent data from the belle and babar collaborations on the @xmath2 decay channel .",
    "we take into account the experimental procedure that identifies @xmath2 events near the @xmath3 threshold as @xmath3 or @xmath4 events above the threshold .",
    "our analysis of these energy distributions , which are nonzero only above the @xmath8 threshold , gives a mass for the @xmath0 that is below the threshold .",
    "in section  [ sec : critique ] , we present a critical discussion of previous theoretical analyses of the line shapes of the @xmath0 .",
    "our results are summarized in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "if there is an s - wave resonance very close to the threshold for a pair of particles with short - range interactions , their scattering length @xmath27 is large compared to the range of their interaction .",
    "the line shapes associated with an s - wave threshold resonance have some unusual features that are not ordinarily encountered in high energy physics .",
    "the line shapes for decay modes that involve the decay of a constituent are different from those for all other decay modes , because they can proceed even when the constituents have a large separation of order @xmath27 . for all other decay modes , the constituents must approach to within a much smaller distance comparable to the range of the interaction .",
    "we will refer to these two classes of decay modes as _ constituent decay modes _ and _ short - distance decay modes _",
    ", respectively .",
    "in the case of the @xmath0 , the constituent decay modes are @xmath2 and @xmath23 and an example of a short - distance decay mode is @xmath1 . in this section , we summarize the essential aspects of the line shape for short - distance decay modes .",
