    "it has been suggested @xcite , that globular clusters may contain central black holes with masses lying along the extension of the correlation between black hole mass and bulge velocity dispersion as seen for galaxies @xcite .",
    "however it has also been suggested that the observational evidence can be otherwise explained @xcite .",
    "these difficulties of interpretation are compounded by the small number of observable stars in the cores of globular clusters .",
    "in contrast to a galactic center , current observations approach the limit when the uncertainty of an aggregate measurement , such as a velocity dispersion , can not be reduced by further observations . once",
    "every star has been observed , there is nothing more to be done .",
    "( see drukier et al .",
    "2003 for a general discussion of issues relating to the observation and interpretation of velocity dispersions in globular clusters . )",
    "this is particularly the case for central black holes , since there is only a relatively small region over which the black hole provides the dominant contribution to the gravitational potential .",
    "most current observational work relating to the possible presence of central black holes in globular clusters has been done using radial velocity measurements to determine the central value and radial gradient of the velocity dispersion . in this _",
    "letter we explore an alternative approach , namely the use of proper motion measurements to identify individual stars whose velocities are strongly influenced by the presence of a central black hole .",
    "we find that existing crude models suggest that this approach may be fruitful , and that the considerable theoretical and observational work that will be required to apply this approach in practice may thus be justified . in  2 , we estimate the number of stars with anomalously high velocities caused by a central black hole , and in  3 we generate a list of the clusters with the highest probability of observing such stars .",
    "we find that for plausible assumptions such stars might well be observable with hst in the most favorable clusters . _",
    "consider a globular cluster with central velocity dispersion @xmath1 , where this is the dispersion outside the radius of influence , @xmath2 , of a black hole with mass @xmath3 , given by @xmath4 we define @xmath5 as the one - dimensional velocity dispersion and @xmath6 as the stellar surface density within @xmath2 .",
    "outside @xmath2 , the influence of the black hole is too small to significantly affect stellar orbits . for simplicity , we assume that the velocities are distributed as a gaussian with dispersion @xmath5 . now , at a radius @xmath7 , the fraction of stars which will have velocities greater than some multiple @xmath8 of the velocity dispersion @xmath1 is given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the dimensionality of the observed velocity ( 1 for radial velocities , 2 for proper motions , and 3 for space velocities ) . while the upper limit could ,",
    "in principle , be some multiple of the escape velocity , this is difficult to define without detailed modeling of the structure of the whole cluster . instead , as the complementary error function drops off rapidly with increasing argument , we will just use the infinite upper limit shown .",
    "this will lead to a slight overestimate in the number of expected stars , but this effect is small compared to that due to the uncertainty in @xmath11 discussed below . with this limit ,",
    "equation  ( [ e : f ] ) reduces to @xmath12 the total number of stars with `` significantly '' high velocities ( significant being defined here as @xmath8 times the velocity dispersion @xmath1 outside @xmath13 ) is then given by @xmath14    the only existing dynamical investigation of the effects of a central black hole on the structure of a globular cluster is that of @xcite who used the fokker - planck equation to integrate a steady - state , anisotropic distribution function in the vicinity of a black hole .",
    "they found that the projected velocity dispersion and surface density profiles could be approximated , for @xmath15 , by @xmath16 the two terms in equation  ( [ e : sigma ] ) deal with the flattening of the velocity dispersion profile near @xmath2 . substituting these into equation  ( [ e : n1 ] )",
    "leads , after a suitable rescaling of the integration variable , to @xmath17 where @xmath18 the integral can be evaluated numerically and gives @xmath19 to two figures . by way of comparison , if no black hole is present then , assuming @xmath20 and @xmath21 , @xmath22 for which @xmath23 , and the expected number of stars is given by equation  ( [ e : n2 ] ) with @xmath24 in place of @xmath25 .",
    "the galactic black hole mass versus velocity dispersion correlation @xcite is usually given in the form @xmath26 where @xmath1 is a suitable velocity dispersion and @xmath27 km s@xmath28 .",
    "the uncertainty in the power - law slope is the largest source of uncertainty in our estimated number of high - velocity stars .",
    "recent estimates for @xmath11 ( the variation in @xmath29 is small since all studies agree for @xmath30 ) range from @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) @xcite to @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) @xcite .",
    "these agree within their quoted errors , but , on extrapolation to the globular cluster regime , the use of @xmath35 predicts 20 times as many high - velocity stars as does the use of @xmath36 .",
    "we therefore give results for both these slopes below .",
    "the original claim for globular clusters @xcite used @xmath35 .    substituting equations  ( [ e : rh ] ) and",
    "( [ e : mbh ] ) into equation  ( [ e : n2 ] ) we arrive at the following @xmath37 where @xmath1 is measured in km s@xmath28 and @xmath38 is the number of _ measurable _ stars per square parsec .",
    "what we can easily observe is not @xmath38 but the central surface density , @xmath39 , so we need to rewrite @xmath38 in terms of @xmath39 for a reasonable globular cluster stellar population . for a defined population of stars ,",
    "let @xmath40 be the cluster luminosity per star in that population in solar units , and let @xmath41 be the fraction of these stars that are usefully measurable . then for @xmath39 in @xmath42 magnitude per square arc second , and taking @xmath43 @xmath44 in this case @xmath45 where @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 .    for our problem ,",
    "@xmath40 is determined by the luminosity function in the core of the cluster in question .",
    "it needs to take into account mass segregation effects and other possible population peculiarities as might be indicated by , for example , color gradients .",
    "the measurable fraction , @xmath41 , is an observational selection effect on the luminosity function .",
    "it will depend on the observational technique to be used , the distance of the cluster , crowding and so forth .",
    "since a complete stellar census is a difficult undertaking , we estimate @xmath40 as follows .",
    "define our population to be all the stars brighter than some magnitude , @xmath50 ( e.g. the expected magnitude limit of the observations ) in a cluster color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) .",
    "then , @xmath51 the quantities @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the mean luminosities for the bright and faint parts of the cmd ( divided at @xmath50 ) and @xmath54 is the ratio of the number of stars brighter than @xmath50 to the number of those fainter .",
    "@xmath52 can be estimated directly from the cluster cmd , for which purpose we use the cmds in the compilation by @xcite .",
    "@xmath53 and @xmath54 can be estimated from the corresponding theoretical luminosity function ( lf ) .",
    "we use those from the models of @xcite .",
    "one limitation is that these lfs only include stars from the hydrogen burning limit to the tip of the red giant branch , so we must use the cmd to correct the ratio of the number of stars in each part of the lf , @xmath55 , for the contribution of post - rgb stars .",
    "if , brighter than @xmath50 , we see in the cmd @xmath56 stars in the regions covered by the luminosity function , and @xmath57 more evolved stars elsewhere , then @xmath58 by substituting equations  ( [ e : nf ] ) and ( [ e : lbar ] ) into equation  ( [ e : n3 ] ) , we can now estimate @xmath59 for any given cluster , subject to the selection of @xmath41 .",

    ", it remains only to specify @xmath41 to get the number of fast - moving stars we could detect .",
    "we consider two scenarios : radial velocities and proper motions .    for radial velocity measurements ,",
    "@xmath41 is likely to be small , as only the brightest , least crowded , central stars are suitable . for the case of m  15 , if we compare the number of stars with radial velocities as compiled by @xcite with the _ hst _ photometric list in @xcite then , with @xmath68 , we find that about 4% of the stars",

    "@xmath74 stars .",
    "the number expected is effectively zero .    a further problem with using radial velocities to detect the fast - moving stars lies in their radial distribution as given by the integrands in equations ( [ e : i1 ] ) and ( [ e : i2 ] )",
    "after an appropriate coordinate transformation .",
    "we compare these in figure  [ f : x ] for @xmath75 and the three values of @xmath10 . in all three cases ,",
    "the fast - moving stars are concentrated well within @xmath2 .",

    "if there is a black hole , the fast - moving stars should be concentrated in the center of the cluster , with a maximum inside @xmath78 . for radial velocities ,",
    "the high - velocity stars are confined within about @xmath79 or 03 for the nearer clusters .",
    "for the higher - dimensional velocities , the detection region is somewhat broader",
    ". clearly , radial velocities are unlikely to prove the question one way or another .    for proper motions ,",
    "the situation is much better , at least for nearby clusters for which such observations are feasible . in the case of ngc 6752 , @xcite measure 153",
    "stars brighter than @xmath50 within @xmath80 of the cluster center . to the same radius , @xcite ,",
    "measure the proper motions of 15 stars .",
    "their detection region only covers about a third of the area within @xmath2 due to gaps in their 1999 data .",
    "these gaps , unfortunately , covers much of the very center of the cluster , so it is difficult to estimate the detection rate within about @xmath81 where we expect to find most of the fast - moving stars .",
    "crowding is bound to be a problem in this region , even for _ hst_. extrapolating from the most crowded regions studied by @xcite and taking into account the gaps in their coverage , we estimate that @xmath82 is appropriate for proper motions . in this case",
    "@xmath83 stars .",
    "if this @xmath0 conjecture is correct , the top three clusters should contain of order 10 high - velocity stars between them with the balance of the 12 clusters in table  [ t : top choices ] contributing another 5 or so in total .",
    "in addition , their radial range is double that for radial velocities . on the other hand , @xmath84 stars , and the black holes",
    "will be undetectable by this method .",
    "proper motions have the feature that their uncertainty is inversely proportional to the time baseline and proportional to the distance .",
    "nonetheless , the top three clusters , all with distances between 10 and 12 kpc , should be close enough that , given sufficient data , the black hole hypothesis can be tested , assuming a value of @xmath11 at the lower end of its range . the main limitation at this distance will be the increase in effective crowding , proportional to the distance squared . for the top three clusters in table  [ t : top choices ] , crowding will be 10 to 16 times higher than in the ngc  6752 observations of @xcite .    in the absence of a black hole ,",
    "the flat extrapolation would lead us to expect to see one or two fast - moving stars within @xmath2 in each of our top three candidates .",
    "these stars will have a radial distribution proportional to radius , and should be found in the vicinity of @xmath2 , not concentrated within @xmath85 as is predicted under the black hole conjecture .",
    "fast - moving stars can have origins other than a black hole , of course .",
    "ejection from the core during core - collapse is one plausible mechanism for producing such stars @xcite , but their velocity vectors will be radial unlike a star in orbit around a black hole .",
    "we caution that the numbers presented here are only estimates and depend on the scalings found by @xcite .",
    "those models are single - mass anisotropic fokker - planck simulations for the steady - state stellar distribution in the vicinity of the black hole .",
    "more modern models , which should include , at the very least , a range of stellar masses and a self - consistent potential , will be needed to fully assess the significance of any fast - moving stars which are observed in these clusters .",
    "the estimates made here also depend on the current central velocity dispersions in the globular clusters .",
    "since globular clusters can lose a large fraction of their mass due to stellar evolution and stellar - dynamical evolution , the numbers provided in table  [ t : top choices ] may well be underestimated if the proper velocity dispersion to use in determining black hole masses is the original value , not the current one .",
    "further , the mass of any central black hole will have increased to some extent due to the capture of cluster stars .",
    "using double the current velocity dispersion , for example , would increase @xmath86 by a factor of 16 and @xmath87 by a factor of 39 , in which case the higher slope also predicts significant numbers of observable stars in the top few clusters . given the sensitivity to these effects , obtaining reliable estimates for the numbers of high - velocity stars will require fully evolving models . even in the event that proper - motion studies uncover no fast moving stars",
    ", such models will allow for firm upper limits on the mass of any black hole .",
    "constructing such models , and carrying out the necessary proper motion observations , is no small task , but given the strong interest and controversy currently surrounding this topic , we believe that efforts along these lines should be vigorously pursued .",
