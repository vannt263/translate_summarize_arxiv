    "improvements in the spatial and temporal resolution of solar observations have led to a recent deluge in reported magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) wave motions ( e.g. see nakariakov & verwichte @xcite ; de moortel @xcite ; banerjee et al .",

    "these transverse motions have been called alfvn waves by some authors , although this is subject to debate and they are alternatively interpreted as kink waves ( e.g. see arguments by erdlyi & fedun @xcite ; van doorsselaere et al .",
    "the dispute rests not with the observations themselves , but with the appropriate interpretation : mhd wave modes of an overdense cylinder versus mhd waves of a homogeneous plasma . these arguments and others ,",
    "e.g. whether or not a stable waveguide actually exists in the solar atmosphere , are not the focus of this current paper .",
    "tomczyk et al .",
    "( @xcite ) utilised the _ comp / coronal multi - channel polarimeter _ instrument to report on ubiquitous , small - amplitude , transverse disturbances , propagating along magnetic field lines .",
    "the authors do not report on how the waves are generated , but do speculate the waves may originate from within the chromospheric network that forms the footpoints of the observed loops .",
    "de pontieu et al .",
    "( @xcite ) used _ hinode / sot _ measurements in an attempt to reveal alfvn / transversal waves in the chromosphere with strong amplitudes ( @xmath2km / s ) and periods @xmath3seconds .",
    "ca ii h - line images also reveal a plethora of dynamic , jet - like extrusions called chromosphere spicules , or _",
    "type ii spicules_. these spicules undergo a swaying / oscillatory motion perpendicular to their own axis , which the authors described as alfvnic motions . again",
    ", this interpretation is disputed by other authors ( e.g. he et al .",
    "@xcite ; verth et al .",
    "@xcite ) who interpreted these spicule oscillations as kink waves , due to the fact that spicules are overdense in comparison with the ambient plasma .    de pontieu et al . ( @xcite ) report on a link between chromospheric spicules / jets and their coronal spicules / jets counterparts , i.e. suggesting a mechanism for imparting chromospheric plasma into the corona .",
    "the coronal spicules are strongly heated and are seen to rapidly propagate upwards , but the authors report that there are currently no models for what drives and heats the observed jets ( see also a review by sterling @xcite ) .",
    "okamoto & de pontieu ( @xcite ) report on the statistical properties of transverse ( alfvnic ) waves along spicules and report median velocity amplitudes and periods of @xmath4km / s and @xmath5seconds , respectively ( see also review by zaqarashvili & erdlyi @xcite ) .",
    "mcintosh et al . ( @xcite ) reported transition region observations of ubiquitous , transverse ( swaying / alfvnic ) motions that are outwardly propagating , with amplitudes @xmath6km / s and periods @xmath7seconds , energetic enough to heat the fast solar wind .",
    "again , the authors note that the challenge remains to understand how and where these waves are generated in the solar atmosphere .    thus , transverse / swaying motions have been observed over a range of temperatures , wavelengths , speeds and scales .",
    "however , the origin of these propagating , transverse oscillations remains a mystery .",

    "@xcite ; ofman & wang @xcite ; erdlyi & taroyan @xcite ) . more recently",
    ", this propagating slow wave interpretation has been challenged .",
    "de pontieu & mcintosh ( @xcite ) show that _ hinode / eis _ measurements of intensity and velocity oscillations of coronal lines are driven by a quasi - periodically varying component in the blue wing of the emission line , i.e. providing evidence of quasi - periodic upflows .",
    "moreover , such upflows ( @xmath8km / s in the line - of - sight ) have also been reported in coronal loop footpoints in active regions ( de pontieu et al .",
    "@xcite ) and quiet - sun regions ( mcintosh & de pontieu @xcite ) .",
    "these authors also suggest a direct link between these outflows / propagating disturbances and chromospheric spicules , i.e. the fountain - like jets that protrude into the corona ( mcintosh & de pontieu @xcite ) .",
    "mcintosh et al .",
    "( @xcite ) analysed _ stereo _ observations of polar plumes and identified high - speed upflows , again as opposed to previous interpretations as propagating slow waves .",
    "these authors observed high - speed jets travelling along the plumes with mean velocity of @xmath9km / s and repeating quasi - periodically ( repeat times 5 - 25 minutes ) . using _",
    "sdo / aia _ to extend this analysis to plume - like structures originating from equatorial coronal holes and quiet - sun regions , tian et al .",
    "( @xcite ) found that the outflows are not restricted to plumes .",
    "these authors reported that the outflows exhibit transverse , swaying motions and probably originate from the magnetic network of the quiet - sun and coronal holes .",
    "in contrast , verwichte et al .",
    "( @xcite ) argue that a slow mode interpretation remains a valid explanation for the observed quasi - periodic intensity perturbations , and show that slow waves inherently have a bias towards emission in the blue wing of the emission line due to the in - phase nature of the velocity and density perturbations .",
    "thus , it is clear that there is a need for a better understanding of the physical generation mechanism for these ubiquitous , transverse , propagating motions , and that both quasi - periodic motions and possible flows must be kept in mind .",
    "this paper attempts to describe such a physical mechanism by utilising a dynamic , reconnection numerical model .",
    "magnetic field is continuously emerging on the sun over a range of scales ( see archontis @xcite for a comprehensive review ) .",
    "magnetic flux tubes , formed at the tachocline , rise buoyantly through the convection zone . as they reach the photosphere , their buoyant - rise ends and an instability allows the magnetic flux to penetrate into the solar atmosphere .",
    "the subsequent evolution of the newly - emerged flux is then dominated both by the properties of the rising flux tube itself and the pre - existing magnetic topology the tube emerges into .",
    "flux emergence is well described in the existing literature , as is the dynamic reconnection associated with the collision of newly - emerged flux and pre - existing magnetic field ( e.g. shibata et al .",

    "these numerous , small - scale jets , seen in , e.g. , ca ii h broadband , display an inverted y - shape , i.e. the characteristic shape of anemone jets ( e.g. shibata et al .",
    "@xcite ; yokoyama & shibata @xcite ) . the anemone shape is formed as a result of magnetic reconnection between an emerging magnetic bipole and a pre - existing vertical field .",
    "reconnection can occur when strong currents cause the magnetic fieldlines to diffuse through the plasma and change the connectivity ( parker @xcite ; sweet @xcite ; petsheck @xcite ) . in 2d , reconnection can only occur at null points ( priest & forbes @xcite ) .",
    "dungey ( @xcite ) reported that a perturbed x - point can collapse if the footpoints are free to move , mellor et al .",
    "( @xcite ) studied the linear collapse of a 2d null point , and imshennik & syrovatsky ( @xcite ) described the collapse with an exact , nonlinear solution of the ideal mhd equations .",
    "however , these papers do not include the effect of gas pressure , which acts to limit the growth of the current density . in considering the relaxation of a 2d x - type null point",
    ", craig & mcclymont ( @xcite ) found that free magnetic energy is dissipated by the phenomenon of _ oscillatory reconnection _ , which couples resistive diffusion at the null to global advection of the outer field .",
    "mclaughlin et al .",
    "( @xcite ) investigated the behavior of nonlinear fast magnetoacoustic waves near a 2d x - point and found that the incoming wave deforms the null point into cusp - like point which in turn collapses to a current sheet .",
    "the system then evolves periodically through a series of horizontal / vertical current sheets with associated changes in connectivity , i.e. the system displays oscillatory reconnection .",
    "longcope & priest ( @xcite ) investigated the diffusion at the null of a 2d current sheet subjected to a suddenly enhanced resistivity , finding that the diffusion couples to a fast mode which propagates the current away at the local alfvn speed .",
    "of particular importance to the work presented in this paper is that of murray et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "flux emerging into a pre - existing field has been studied in great detail before , but murray et al .",

    "we now focus on the observable consequences and outputs of such an evolving system .",
    "as current sheets form and reconnection commences in the simulation , we observe strong outflows emanating from the ends of the current sheet , in agreement with classic steady - state reconnection theory ( e.g. sweet @xcite ; parker @xcite ; petschek @xcite ) . upon leaving the current sheet ,",
    "these jets ( strong outflows ) collide with the magnetic field already in the outflow regions and are deflected into two secondary jets at angles of approximately @xmath86 to the original jet ( a termination shock is also present ) .",
    "the schematic structure of these reconnection jets is in good agreement with the description of forbes ( @xcite ) .",
    "since these secondary jets are deflected at angles of approximately @xmath86 and due to the orientation of the current sheets , they manifest themselves as either primarily horizontal and/or vertical outflow jets . for orientation 1 current sheets , jets from the lower end of the current sheet give rise ( periodically ) to negatively - directed @xmath87 and @xmath88 motion .",
    "meanwhile , jets from the upper end of the current sheet give rise ( periodically ) to positively - directed @xmath87 and @xmath88 motion .",
    "for orientation 2 current sheets , the two jets have mixed velocity components , and this can be clearly seen in figure [ figure4 ] .",
    "figure [ figure4 ] shows contours of @xmath87 ( top row ) and @xmath88 ( bottom row ) at four snapshots in our simulation ( the blue / red colour table corresponds to positive / negative motions ) .",

    "a similar pattern is observed emanating from the lower end of the current sheet but with the opposite orientation , i.e. at @xmath76mins ( orientation 1 ) we have negatively - directed @xmath87 motions , followed by positively - directed @xmath87 motions at @xmath81mins ( orientation 2 ) , again in a repeating cycle .",
    "let us now consider the @xmath88 behaviour ( bottom row of figure [ figure4 ] ) .",
    "the characteristic behaviour can be summarised as follows :    @xmath89=1em = 0em    at @xmath76mins ( orientation 1 current sheet ) , we have strong vertical outflows , with positively - directed @xmath88 motions ( blue ) ejected from the upper end of the current sheet .",
    "interestingly , we also have negatively - directed ( but weaker ) @xmath88 motion adjacent to ( to the left of ) our positively - directed @xmath88 outflow .",
    "this negatively - directed @xmath88 motion is associated with the inflow region of the simulated current sheet , and thus acts at right - angles to the current sheet orientation .    at @xmath81mins ( orientation 2 )",
    ", we now have a positively - directed @xmath88 motions ejected from the upper end of the current sheet .",
    "again , negatively - directed @xmath88 motion appears adjacent to ( now to the right of ) our positively - directed @xmath88 outflow ( again associated with inflow into our reconnection region ) .",
    "the cycle then repeats : we have positively - directed @xmath88 motions again at @xmath83mins ( orientation 1 ) and negatively - directed @xmath87 motions at @xmath84mins ( orientation 2 ) .",
    "the vertical @xmath88 motions are of obvious interest for comparison with observations . following the terminology of murray et al .",
    "( @xcite ) we refer to these vertical @xmath88 motions as a _",
    "collimated jet_.      we now consider these vertical outflow jets and swaying , transverse motions in further detail .",
    "to do so , we measure the @xmath87 and @xmath88 signal at a fixed point @xmath91 mm , @xmath92 mm ) where this particular point has been chosen as it is located close to the upper end of the orientation 1 current sheet ( slightly above and to the right ) and thus is well placed to measure the transverse motions and @xmath88 outflows of the resultant jets .    by considering the evolution of the collimated jet",
    ", we note that the central axis will be horizontally - displaced periodically as the current sheet contracts and lengthens ( i.e. evolves between orientation 1 and 2 , and back again ) . whilst evolving from orientation 1 to 2",
    ", the collimated jet will appear to move in the negative @xmath80direction ( i.e. an orientation 1 current sheet first contracts , then lengthens into an orientation 2 current sheet ) .",
    "conversely , whilst evolving from an orientation 2 current sheet ( back ) to orientation 1 , the collimated jet will appear to move in the positive @xmath80direction .",
    "this displacement will repeat itself as the cycle repeats .",
    "thus , the collimated jet displays a characteristic swaying or transverse motion .",
    "note that this transverse behaviour is specifically due to the oscillatory reconnection mechanism , and would be absent for a single , steady - state reconnection jet .",
    "qualitatively , this transverse displacement can be seen by comparing the locations of the ( blue ) collimated jet in figure [ figure4 ] ( bottom row ) .",
    "however , such displacement can also be quantitatively measured from our simulation . in figure",
    "[ figure5]a , we see the evolution of @xmath87 ( km / s ) at the fixed point @xmath91 mm , @xmath92 mm ) . the oscillatory behaviour of @xmath87 can be clearly seen , i.e. the quasi - periodic transverse / swaying displacement .",
    "note that the change from orientation 1 to 2 occurs at @xmath93mins .",
    "before this time , the strong positive @xmath87 motion is associated with the initial formation of the orientation 1 current sheet .",
    "figure [ figure5]b shows the evolution of @xmath88 , i.e. the vertical outflow , at the fixed point @xmath91 mm , @xmath92 mm ) .",
    "we can clearly see the oscillatory behaviour : the outflow changes from @xmath94 at @xmath95mins , to @xmath96 at @xmath97mins , to @xmath94 at @xmath98mins , to @xmath94 at @xmath99mins .",
    "after @xmath100mins , the signal is much weaker since the bulk of the ( oscillatory ) reconnection has occurred by this time .",
    "we fit the oscillation with an exponentially - damped envelope @xmath101 for @xmath96 and @xmath102 for @xmath94 ( red dashed lines ) , where @xmath103 is determined experimentally .",
    "it is also important to note that there is a stronger positive @xmath88 signal than negative @xmath88 signal , i.e. there is more than .",
    "this can be most clearly seen by calculating the average of the two exponentially decaying envelopes , i.e. @xmath104 , and this average is denoted by the blue dashed line .",
    "since this curve is positive , it indicates the presence of a positive upflow , i.e. for zero flow , we would expect the two exponentially decaying envelopes to average to zero .",
    "note that the generation of this positively - directed vertical net flow is tightly localised to the upper ends of the ( evolving ) current sheet , and thus one must be careful when analysing the oscillatory signal at a fixed point ( as in figure [ figure5]b ) .",
    "similar oscillatory results and upflows are obtained for other choices of fixed points located around @xmath91 mm , @xmath92 mm ) and within the same ( north - easterly ) domain of connectivity .",
    "we also note that for both figures [ figure5]a and [ figure5]b , the conditions before @xmath105mins are explained by the initial flux emergence itself , i.e. the flux tube is expanding upwards and sideways into the solar atmosphere and so , for @xmath106 , a small @xmath107 and @xmath108 is initially present .      in  [ sec :",

    "as detailed in mclaughlin et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , by considering the evolution of the vector potential at the center of the current sheet , one can obtain a quantitative measure of the oscillatory nature of the system . in our numerical experiment ,",
    "we track the center of the ( rising ) current sheet and plot the value of the vector potential at that point versus time . this evolution can be seen figure [ figure6 ] .    for @xmath109mins ,",
    "the oscillatory nature of our system is clear , and changes in the vector potential can be related to changes in connectivity of the system ( see  @xmath110 of mclaughlin et al .",
    "@xcite ) . meanwhile , for @xmath111mins , the vector potential changes very little and then increases ( @xmath112mins ) to a plateau ( @xmath113mins ) to a constant @xmath114 . the oscillations between @xmath109mins are directly related to the oscillatory reconnection mechanism at work in our simulations ( i.e. a local effect , searching for an equilibrium ) whereas the behaviour for @xmath111mins and beyond are related to the system settling into equilibrium on a global scale .",
    "there is no change in the vector potential for @xmath113mins .",
    "since we are primarily interested in oscillatory reconnection in this paper ( as opposed to the general behaviour of flux emergence ) we shall focus on the time period @xmath109mins , and a blow - up of the evolution of @xmath115 over this time is shown in the insert of figure [ figure6 ] .",
    "we measure the period of oscillation by considering two local extrema in the vector potential ( indicated by the vertical dashed lines in the insert ) .",
    "we measure a period of @xmath116 seconds , i.e. @xmath117mins , for the parameters and initial conditions we have considered .",
    "we now investigate the dependence of our system to varying @xmath119 , i.e. the initial magnetic strength of our buoyant flux tube .",
    "this will allow us to see how the period of oscillation changes and investigate how robust our system is to the onset of oscillatory reconnection .",
    "figure [ figure7]a shows the full time evolution of @xmath115 ( located at the center of the current sheet ) for several different values of the initial value of the magnetic field strength of the buoyant flux tube , i.e. we vary the value of @xmath119 . since this is a numerical parameter study , we choose to present values associated with @xmath118 , i.e. the non - dimensionalised initial magnetic field strength .",
    "specifically , figure [ figure7]a reports the evolution of eight values ranging from @xmath120 g or , in non - dimensional units , @xmath121 . note that  [ sec : fluxemergence ] above corresponds to @xmath122 g , i.e. @xmath123 . from the resultant curves , it is clear that oscillatory behaviour is present in all of these numerical experiments .",
    "thus , we can measure the corresponding period of oscillation for each choice of @xmath119 and this is shown in figure [ figure8]a .",
    "we also investigate larger and smaller values of @xmath119 and these results can be seen in figure [ figure7]b , which presents values of @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 and @xmath127 g , i.e. @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath110 and @xmath130 .",
    "these choices yield behaviors of a significantly different nature to those seen in figure [ figure7]a .",
    "this is for two reasons : firstly , for values of @xmath131 , i.e. @xmath132 g , the initially - submerged flux tube does not successfully emerge into the solar atmosphere .",
    "this is in agreement with the results of murray & hood ( @xcite ) who found that for low initial magnetic field strengths , the tube can not fully emerge into the atmosphere since the buoyancy instability criterion is not satisfied .",
    "thus , in this model , for values of @xmath132 g , we have no flux emergence ( or failed emergence ) and thus no onset of oscillatory reconnection .",
    "thus , high in the solar atmosphere , @xmath115 remains constant . in figure",
    "[ figure7]b , we plot @xmath115 corresponding to a @xmath128 failed emergence ( constant value green line ) for comparison .",
    "figure [ figure7]b also shows the time evolution of the vector potentials corresponding to @xmath133 ( blue line ) , @xmath134 ( purple ) and @xmath135 ( yellow ) .",
    "we note that the evolution of @xmath115 is again significantly different to that seen in figure [ figure7]a .",
    "@xmath136 is plotted as a dashed line to aid comparison between the subfigures .",
    "the reason for this significant change in behaviour is that for @xmath137 , we have successful flux emergence and current sheet/ x - point formation in a similar manner to that detailed in  [ sec : fluxemergence ] above but , critically , these strong current sheets now eject _ plasmoids _ from their ends and this fundamentally changes the properties of the current sheet / x - point , since the plasmoids take magnetic flux with them as they leave the current sheet / x - point . thus , although we still have oscillatory behaviour present in the behaviour of @xmath115 corresponding to @xmath138 and @xmath110 , this represents a fundamentally different regime to that seen for @xmath121 in figure [ figure7]a .",
    "the effect is even more pronounced for @xmath139 and beyond .",
    "let us now investigate the period associated with our choice of @xmath118 ( figure [ figure8]a ) where we restrict ourselves to @xmath121 ( as explained above , values above and below these limits correspond to fundamentally different regimes ) .",
    "we find that the period of oscillation increases with @xmath118 , for periods @xmath140seconds , i.e. @xmath1min .",
    "finally , we investigate how the final location of the x - point depends upon our choice of @xmath118 .",
    "we find that the location x - point at @xmath141mins , i.e. the final / resting location , is displaced both higher and further to the left for stronger values of @xmath118 ( again we restrict ourselves to @xmath121 ) .",
    "this behaviour can be seen in figure [ figure8]b .",
    "we have performed numerical experiments of magnetic flux emerging into a coronal hole , modeled as a pre - existing unipolar magnetic field , within a stratified solar atmosphere , and solve the compressible and resistive mhd equations using a lagrangian remap , shock capturing code : _ lare2d_. the long - term evolution of the system is followed and we investigate how the reconnecting magnetic systems behave as they search for an equilibrium .",
    "we find that the initial rise and expansion of the emerging magnetic flux tube are in good agreement with that reported in the existing literature ( figure [ figure2 ] ) .",
    "reconnection is initiated at @xmath75mins ( for @xmath123 system ) in which inflows acting perpendicular to the current sheet bring magnetic field into reconnection region , and magnetic flux is ejected at the ends of the current sheet .",
    "we find that oscillatory reconnection occurs in the model ( figure [ figure3 ] ) i.e. a process in which resistive diffusion at the x - point is coupled to global advection of the outer field .",
    "we find that the first _",
    "reconnection reversal _ ,",
    "i.e. change from an orientation 1 current sheet to an orientation 2 , occurs around @xmath93mins .",
    "the mechanism for oscillatory reconnection is well described by mclaughlin et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and murray et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and occurs due to a local imbalance of forces , primarily the gradients in thermal pressure , between the neighbouring flux systems .",
    "we find strong horizontal outflows from both ends of current sheet and , once oscillatory reconnection is initiated , these change direction periodically .",
    "similarly , we find strong vertical outflows in the positive @xmath142direction emanating from the upper end of our current sheet , and these sit side - by - side with negative @xmath142direction inflows bringing magnetic flux into the reconnection region .",
    "the direction of these positive / negative velocities changes as the system changes from orientation 1 to 2 ( figure [ figure4 ] ) but we also find on average there is a vertical upflow directed in the positive @xmath142direction ( figure [ figure5]b ) .",
    "we find that the vertical outflows / collimated jet will be displaced horizontal during the shortening and lengthening of the evolving currents sheets which results from the oscillatory reconnection mechanism .",
    "this displacement gives the vertical outflow jets a swaying nature and explains the transverse nature of the oscillations .",
    "this was further confirmed by analysing @xmath143 , which clearly demonstrated the transverse behaviour ( figure [ figure5]a ) .    in order to quantitatively estimate the vertical outflows , we measured the vertical velocity at a fixed point : @xmath144 . here",
    ", the positive ( material ejected from the end of the current sheet ) and negative ( inflow into the reconnection region ) vertical flows were visible and as well as the periodic nature of the oscillations ( figure [ figure5]b ) .",
    "only a few complete periods were observed and so we labelled this quasi - periodic behaviour .",
    "we fit the damped oscillations with exponential envelopes and found that there was a preference for positive velocity over negative , i.e. evidence of a positively - directed vertical net flow in the model .",
    "note that the generation of this positively - directed vertical net flow is tightly localised to the upper ends of the ( evolving ) current sheet and so similar results are obtained only for other choices of fixed points located around @xmath145 mm , @xmath92 mm ) and within the same domain of connectivity .    by tracking the vector potential , @xmath115 , at the center of the ( moving ) current sheet ,",
    "we quantitatively measure the period of oscillation , allowing us to measure a period of @xmath116seconds ( @xmath117mins ) for an initial magnetic flux tube strength of @xmath146 g ( @xmath123 ) .",
    "we also perform a parameter study varying the initial magnetic strength of the buoyant flux tube , i.e. @xmath119 .",
    "we find that for a range of parameters applicable to the solar atmosphere , @xmath147 g , we observed similar flux emergence and oscillatory reconnection behaviour , with each @xmath119 corresponding to its own period of oscillation in the range @xmath148mins .",
    "essentially , the stronger the initial flux tube strength , the longer the period of oscillation .",
    "however , for @xmath149 g , we do not observe successful flux emergence and thus , obviously , there is no subsequent oscillatory motion .",
    "this is in agreement with murray & hood ( @xcite ) who found that for low initial magnetic field strengths , the tube can not fully emerge into the atmosphere since the buoyancy instability criterion is not satisfied , i.e. flux emergence .",
    "further details of the buoyancy instability criterion can be found in newcomb ( @xcite ) , yu ( @xcite ) , thomas & nye ( @xcite ) , acheson ( @xcite ) and arcontis et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , it is the buoyancy instability criterion that dictates the lower limit in our model , given our choices of parameters . for different parameters ,",
    "e.g. a stronger / weaker equilibrium uni - directional magnetic field , the buoyancy instability criterion will have a higher / lower threshold , although a full investigation must be undertaken to investigate the true behaviour .",
    "we also investigate larger values , i.e. @xmath150 g .",
    "here , unlike for @xmath147 g , we observe the formation of plasmoids ejecting from the ends of our current sheet .",
    "these ejected plasmoids change the properties of the x - point , e.g. taking magnetic flux with them .",
    "thus , even though we still have oscillatory behaviour , seen in the evolution of @xmath115 , this represents a fundamentally different regime than that of @xmath147 g .",
    "the exact reason for plasmoid formation above a particular threshold strength is uncertain , and will be investigated in future work .",
    "finally , we investigated how the final location of the x - point depends upon our choice of @xmath119 .",
    "we found that the location x - point at @xmath141mins , i.e. the final / resting location , was displaced both higher and further to the left for stronger values of @xmath119 ( we restricted our records to @xmath147 g ) .",
    "both the longer duration periods of oscillation and increased displacement / height of the x - point can be fully explained since stronger @xmath119 tubes have larger emergence velocities and thus greater momenta .",
    "thus , the larger momentum flux tubes are able to compress the x - point to a greater extent ( resulting in a stronger / longer current sheer and thus longer periods for the subsequent oscillatory reconnection , which explains figure [ figure8]a ) and , secondly , higher @xmath119 flux tubes with larger momenta carry the tube higher and farther into the atmosphere ( explaining figure [ figure8]b ) .    thus , we have presented numerical simulations that _ naturally generate quasi - periodic flows with a characteristic transverse / swaying aspect_. such outputs result from the oscillatory reconnection physical mechanism , i.e. in a self - consistent manner since _ no periodic driver is imposed on our system_. the vertical speeds of the outflows , @xmath0km / s , are comparable to those reported in recent observations . by varying the initial strength of our submerged flux tube , we recover periodicities in the range of @xmath151mins .",
    "thus , the mechanism of oscillatory reconnection may provide a physical explanation for the generation of some of the recent quasi - periodic , transverse , vertical motions / jets / outflows reported by a multitude of authors ( see  [ sec : introduction ] for details ) .",
    "in particular , the oscillatory reconnection mechanism presented here may explain the observations and simulations by nishizuka et al .",
    "( @xcite ; @xcite ) and he et al .",
    "( @xcite ; @xcite ) , who detail _ hinode / sot _ observations and simulations of transverse motions on a spicule , originating from the cusp of an inverted y - shaped structure , as well as more recent work by ding et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and harra et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the oscillatory mechanism presented here may also partially explain quasi - periodic pulsations ( see reviews by aschwanden @xcite ; nakariakov & melnikov @xcite ) . such oscillatory behavior has been observed in a number of solar and stellar flares ( mathioudakis et al .",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ; mcateer et al .",
    "@xcite ; inglis et al .",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ; nakariakov et al .",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ) but the true physical mechanism responsible remains uncertain .    finally , it should also be noted that the mechanism generates both @xmath87 and @xmath88 motions together ( one can not exist without the other ) , and such motions are exponentially damped .",
    "thus , if such signals are detected , they may be decaying not due to a damping mechanism but _ due to the generation mechanism itself_. this is not surprising given that flux emergence injects a finite amount of energy into the ( oscillatory reconnection ) mechanism , and so it is expected that the phenomena and outputs will also only be of a finite duration , i.e. this is a _ dynamic _ reconnection phenomenon as opposed to the classical steady - state ( time - independent ) reconnection models .",
    "although we have only presented a specific example of reconnection initiated by flux emergence , we believe the oscillatory reconnection mechanism described in this paper is a robust , general phenomenon that may be observed in other systems that demonstrate finite - duration reconnection .",
    "further studies should focus on the inclusion of heat conduction ( e.g. miyagoshi & yokoyama @xcite ; @xcite ) which is expected to reduce the temperature of the outflow jets .",
    "however , the density of outflows will also be increased by heat conduction , i.e. to ensure force balance in the current sheet , which may make the outflow jet more observable ( e.g. shiota et al .",
    "finally , the oscillatory reconnection mechanism itself should be investigated further ( e.g. gruszecki et al .",
    "@xcite ) and extended to fully three - dimensional studies .",
