    "heisenberg spin ladders have been the subject of intense theoretical and experimental research in recent years .",
    "it is by now well established that single chain heisenberg antiferromagnets with integer spin have a gap in the excitation spectrum , whereas those with half - integer spin have gapless excitations .",
    "the former have a finite correlation length , while for the latter it is infinite with the spin - spin correlation function decaying as a power law . for @xmath1",
    "heisenberg spin ladders@xcite , the systems with an even number of legs have an energy gap , short range correlations and a  spin liquid \" ground state .",
    "on the other hand , the systems with odd number of legs have gapless excitations , quasi long range order , and a power - law falloff of spin - spin correlations , similar to single chains .    in this paper , we study the heisenberg model on a 2-chain ladder with second neighbor interactions , via ising and dimer expansions , diagonalization of finite systems , and abelian bosonization .",
    "all of the work is at @xmath2 .",
    "the motivation for studying such a system is twofold .",
    "firstly we wish to explore the effect of frustration on the properties of 2-leg @xmath3 ladders .",
    "weak frustration is not expected to change the physics of the gapped system qualitatively .",
    "however strong frustration may change the nature of the ground state at some critical coupling ratio , corresponding to a @xmath2 phase transition . furthermore in other systems , such as the @xmath4 chain ,",
    "frustration itself leads to the creation of a gapped dimer phase , and thus in the present case there is the possibility of observing the competition between two independent gap yielding perturbations .",
    "the second reason for studying such a generalized ladder system is the possibility that in real 2-leg ladder materials significant second neighbour interactions will be present .",
    "we write the hamiltonian of our system as @xmath5 \\label{h}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 denotes the @xmath7 spin at site @xmath8 of the @xmath9th chain .",
    "@xmath10 is the interaction between nearest neighbor spins along the chain , @xmath11 is the interactions between nearest neighbor spins along the rungs , @xmath12 is the interactions between the second neighbor spins .",
    "this is shown in figure 1(a ) .",
    "we denote the ratio of couplings as @xmath13 and @xmath14 . in the present paper",
    "all couplings are taken to be antiferromagnetic ( that is , @xmath15 ) .",
    "the system has an interesting symmetry property : if one exchanges the couplings @xmath10 and @xmath12 , one can recover the original hamiltonian by exchanging two spins along the rungs at even sites , that is , the hamiltonian will be invariant under exchanging the couplings @xmath10 and @xmath12 : @xmath16 therefore we only need to study the case of @xmath17 , and the system with @xmath18 can be mapped into system with @xmath17 through the identity in eq .",
    "( [ hsym ] ) .",
    "there has been some previous work on this system .",
    "of course for @xmath19 we recover the usual 2-leg ladders@xcite , which has gapless excitations only when @xmath20 .",
    "the case @xmath21 has special properties .",
    "bose and gayen@xcite first pointed out that this system has an exact dimer state : a state in which every pair of spins along the rungs form a singlet , and this perfect dimer state is the ground state for large enough values of @xmath22 .",
    "xian@xcite performed a systematic study of this system via a microscopic approach based on a proper set of composite operators , and found that the hamiltonian consists of two commuting parts : @xmath23 where @xmath24 represent the effective spin-1 operator at site @xmath8 .",
    "the first part , @xmath25 , is trivial , with no interaction between different rungs and with a gap @xmath11 between the singlet and triplet states .",
    "the second part , @xmath26 , is similar to the spin-1 heisenberg chain with each rung in the ladder corresponding to each site in the spin-1 chain . because the two part of @xmath27 commute",
    "it follows that there is an eigenstate of @xmath27 with eigenvalue : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the ground - state energy per site of the spin-1 heisenberg chain@xcite .",
    "the eigenvalue for the state with singlets on all of the rungs is @xmath30 therefore one can easily determine the transition point @xmath31 . at this crossing point",
    "the singlet - singlet gap is zero .",
    "kitatani and oguchi@xcite had independently considered the existence of a state of singlet dimers for this system for @xmath21 , and had obtained the same results as above .",
    "this paper studies the general case where exact results are not known . in section 2",
    "we report results obtained by ising and dimer expansions at @xmath2 .",
    "we compute the ground state energy and the complete spin - wave excitation spectra , as well as obtaining more accurate estimates for various quantities for the simple case @xmath19 .",
    "we also carry out finite lattice diagonalization studies for systems of 16 and 24 spins , paying particular attention to the behaviour of spin - spin correlations .",
    "section 3 describes an analytic approach , based on abelian bosonization .",
    "when comparisons are possible the various methods all provide a consistent picture . finally in section 4",
    "we provide a summary and draw some conclusions .",
    "we report here the results of numerical studies , using both series expansions and diagonalizations .",
    "these methods provide results over the whole phase diagram , and give the most detailed picture of the behaviour of this system for general values of the couplings .    our previous series work on the ladder system@xcite used expansions about both the ising limit and about a fully dimerized state , and we refer to that paper and references therein for technical details .",
    "to construct an expansion about the ising limit for this system , one has to introduce an anisotropy parameter @xmath32 , and write the hamiltonian as : @xmath33 where    @xmath34 \\label{eqh0 } \\\\ v & = &   \\sum_{i } [ j_{{}_{/\\!/ } }   ( s_{1,i}^x s_{1,i+1}^x   + s_{1,i}^y s_{1,i+1}^y   + s_{2,i}^x s_{2,i+1}^x + s_{2,i}^y s_{2,i+1}^y )   +   j_{\\perp } ( s_{1,i}^x s_{2,i}^x + s_{1,i}^y s_{2,i}^y ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & + j_2   ( s_{1,i}^x s_{2,i+1}^x + s_{1,i}^y s_{2,i+1}^y                + s_{2,i}^x s_{1,i+1}^x + s_{2,i}^y s_{1,i+1}^y ) ] \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the limits @xmath35 and @xmath36 correspond respectively to the ising and isotropic heisenberg limit , the latter being the case of primary interest .    since @xmath37 is taken as the unperturbed hamiltonian we need to identify the ground states .",
    "there are three of these , shown in figure 1(b ) .",
    "we refer to these as the nel state ( n ) , the ferromagnetic chain state ( f ) and the ferromagnetic rung state ( r ) .",
    "their regions of stability are indicated in figure 2 .",
    "the line @xmath21 , @xmath38 is a boundary between n and f states .",
    "the operator @xmath39 is treated as a perturbation : it flips pairs of spins on neighbouring sites .",
    "the quantum fluctuations represented by @xmath39 will of course result in much more complex ground states . since the system is effectively 1-dimensional",
    "no true long range order can exist , even at @xmath2 .    as in our earlier paper@xcite , to overcome a possible singularity at @xmath40 , and to get a better convergent series in the heisenberg limit , we add to the hamiltonian the following staggered field term @xmath41 for the expansion about the nel state , or the following field term @xmath42 for the expansion about the ferromagnetic rung state .",
    "@xmath43 vanishes at the isotropic limit @xmath36 .",
    "we adjust the coefficient @xmath44 to get the most smooth terms in the series , with a typical value being @xmath45 .",
    "the series expansion method has been previously described in several articles@xcite , and will not be repeated here .",
    "we have developed ising expansions about both the nel and ferromagnetic rung states for the ground state energy per site @xmath46 and the triplet spin - wave excitation spectrum for different ratios of couplings @xmath22 and @xmath47 and ( simultaneously ) for several values of @xmath44 up to order @xmath48 .",
    "the resulting series are available on request .",
    "these series have been analyzed by using integrated first - order inhomogeneous differential approximants and pad approximants@xcite .",
    "we will discuss these results later in this section .      in the limit that the exchange coupling along the rungs @xmath11 is much larger than the couplings @xmath10 and @xmath12 ,",
    "the rungs interact only weakly with each other , and the dominant configuration in the ground state is the product state with the spins on each rung forming a spin singlet .",
    "the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) can then be rewritten as , @xmath49 where @xmath50 \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we can obtain an expansion in @xmath51 by treating the operator @xmath37 as the unperturbed hamiltonian , and the operator @xmath39 as a perturbation .",
    "we have carried out the dimer expansions for the ground state energy up to order @xmath52 and for the triplet excitation spectrum up to order @xmath53 for different values of @xmath47 .",
    "the resulting series for some particular values of @xmath47 are listed in table i. the rest of the series are available on request . in our previous paper@xcite ,",
    "the series for the case @xmath54 were computed up to order @xmath55 for the ground state energy and up to order @xmath56 for the triplet excitation spectrum .",
    "our present results agree with and considerably extend these previous results .",
    "again , we use integrated first - order inhomogeneous differential approximants and pad approximants@xcite to extrapolate the series .",
    "the ground state energy per site @xmath46 is shown in figure 3 , where curves for @xmath57 as shown as functions of @xmath58 .",
    "the curves ( connecting the full point symbols ) emanating from the left side ( small @xmath22 ) are obtained from ising expansion about the r state .",
    "those emanating from the right side are from the dimer expansion .",
    "the estimates from the ising expansion about the n state agree very well with these and are not shown separately ( except for the case of @xmath54 which are shown by open point symbols with error bars ) .",
    "these curves , for any given @xmath47 , cross at a transition point @xmath59 .",
    "this corresponds to a first order ground state phase transition , resulting from a level crossing .",
    "the numerical estimate for @xmath21 of @xmath60 is in good agreement with the exact result of xian@xcite and kitatani and oguchi@xcite discussed above .",
    "the locus of the transition points is shown in figure 2 , and represents a `` gapless line '' where the gap between the two lowest energies , both of which are singlets , vanishes .",
    "everywhere else the ground state is a non - degenerate singlet .",
    "however this is not a gapless line in the usual sense of a vanishing gap for elementary excitations .",
    "there are two branches of triplet spin excitations which we denote @xmath61 , @xmath62 corresponding to symmetric and antisymmetric states with respect to interchange of the two chains .",
    "@xmath63 is the wavenumber along the chain direction . on the left side of the gapless line in fig .",
    "2 , which can be called a `` haldane '' phase , these two branches are independent and each has the appearance of a simple cosine dispersion curve , symmetric about @xmath64 and having a finite gap at the minimum energy points .",
    "however on the right side of the gapless line , the `` dimerized region '' , the branches are no longer independent , being related by @xmath65 and having a complex form , without the symmetry about @xmath64 found in the haldane region .",
    "this relation can be understood as follows .",
    "consider an initial down spin at site @xmath66 flipped to create an excitation . to form a bloch state",
    "this excitation will couple to other downs spins . in the nel or small @xmath47 region",
    "this involves even sites on the upper chain and odd sites on the lower chain leading to a shift of @xmath67 in the wavenumber .",
    "the dispersion curves are shown in figs .",
    "4 - 5 for @xmath68 for particular values of @xmath47 .",
    "the triplet gap appears to be nonzero throughout the phase diagram , except at @xmath69 .",
    "since the dimer expansion carried out here is much longer than our previous calculations@xcite , we can make more accurate estimates for the normal 2-leg ladder without frustration ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the ground - state energy is estimated to be @xmath70 in fig .",
    "6 we show the dependence of the triplet excitation gap @xmath71 on @xmath72 , in particular , they are estimated to be @xmath73 these results agree very well with the recent quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) results of frischmuth _",
    "et al._@xcite and greven , birgeneau , and wiese@xcite .      in order to obtain a more complete picture of the energy spectrum , the correct assignment of spin quantum number @xmath74 to different levels , and the variation of spin - spin correlations throughout the phase diagram we have carried out exact lanczos diagonalizations for ladders with @xmath75 and @xmath76 spins .",
    "the finite lattice corrections appear to be quite small and the results are believed to be representative of the thermodynamic limit .    in fig .",
    "7 we show the energies of low lying energies for @xmath76 , for a scan through the phase diagram ( fig.2 ) at @xmath77 .",
    "the solid lines represent singlets ( @xmath78 ) , while triplet levels ( @xmath79 ) are shown as dashed lines .",
    "the existence of the transition point discussed above , the finite singlet - triplet gap , and other level crossings can be seen .",
    "there is a region around the transition point where the lowest triplet lies above the lowest two singlets .",
    "the location of the transition point , while less accurately resolvable , is totally consistent with the series results given above .",
    "8 we show some pair correlations , for the same scan through the phase diagram at @xmath77 .",
    "the correlations show large discontinuities at the transition point @xmath80 .",
    "the sign of various correlations is consistent with ferromagnetic rung ( r ) type order for @xmath81 and nel type order for @xmath82 , in accordance with the classical ground states in figure 1 .",
    "we note also that further neighbour correlations become very small for increasing @xmath22 , consistent with a dimerized phase .",
    "in this section we present analysis , based on abelian bosonization , which can determine the phase boundary between the ferromagnetic rung ( haldane - type ) and nel ground states .",
    "our considerations are valid in the limit of small @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "since the procedure is well described in the literature @xcite , we will give only the basic steps here .",
    "the spin operators for each chain are transformed , by using the jordan - wigner transformation , into a system of spinless fermions @xmath83(chain 1 ) and @xmath84(chain 2 ) at half filling .",
    "next , since we are interested in the low - energy properties of the model , we pass to a continuum description , which was developed for a single chain by luther and peschel @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of the jordan - wigner fermions is linearized in the vicinity of the two fermi points @xmath85 :    @xmath86,\\ ] ]    where @xmath87 is the lattice spacing , and @xmath88 , @xmath89 are slowly varying on the scale of the lattice .",
    "an analogous transformation is applied to the second chain ( with corresponding fields @xmath90 , @xmath91 ) . in order to write the ladder hamiltonian ( 1 ) in bosonic form , we make use of the abelian bosonization rules :    @xmath92,\\ ] ]    where @xmath93 is a large momentum cutoff , and :    @xmath94.\\ ] ]    here @xmath95 is defined as the field , dual to @xmath96 , i.e. @xmath97 , and @xmath98 is the momentum field , conjugate to @xmath96 .",
    "similar equations describe the second chain . using the above formulas the interchain interactions can be bosonized , with the result :    @xmath99 + \\tilde{h } , \\label{eq19}\\ ] ]    @xmath100 . \\label{eq20}\\ ] ]    in the above equations , the symmetric and antisymmetric combinations of the fields are introduced via @xmath101 , and similarly for the dual fields .",
    "the ( bare ) values of the coupling constants in ( [ eq20 ] ) are @xmath102 , and @xmath103 is a cutoff independent constant .",
    "the luttinger liquid parameters in ( [ eq19 ] ) depend on the bare couplings :    @xmath104    @xmath105    without the @xmath106 terms our equations are similar to the ones obtained by strong and millis for the simple ladder @xcite . in order to emphasize that the second terms in ( [ eq21 ] ) and ( [ eq22 ] ) come from the ising interactions in the two chains , we have introduced the anisotropy parameter @xmath107 ( i.e. @xmath108 , and we should set @xmath109 at the isotropic point ) . in the limit @xmath110 the exact form of the above functions",
    "are known from the bethe ansatz solution of the chain problem , and , in particular for @xmath109 we have @xmath111 , @xmath112 @xcite . away from this exactly solvable limit , the expressions ( [ eq21 ] ) and ( [ eq22 ] ) should be viewed as valid only to lowest order in @xmath107 , @xmath113 and @xmath106 , since all lattice renormalization effects have been neglected in passing to the continuum limit .",
    "we have displayed in ( [ eq20 ] ) only the relevant ( in renormalization group ( rg ) sense @xcite ) operators and have neglected all potentially irrelevant and marginal ones .",
    "the latter contain terms that mix the symmetric and antisymmetric sectors , as well as combinations of field derivatives and cosines .",
    "the scaling dimensions of the three cosine operators in ( [ eq20 ] ) are @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 ( corresponding to @xmath117,@xmath118 and @xmath119 , respectively ) .",
    "a cosine operators is relevant if its scaling dimension is less than two .",
    "thus , in the limit @xmath120 , all operators have dimension one and are relevant . for non - zero values of the interchain couplings",
    ", one can easily see that the most relevant operators are @xmath117 and @xmath119 .",
    "these two couplings thus flow to infinity which signals formation of a gap .",
    "this strong coupling regime corresponds to a non - zero expectation value of @xmath121 @xcite .",
    "whether a ferromagnetic rung ( haldane ) or antiferromagnetic ladder ( nel ) state is realised , depends on the sign of @xmath117 and @xmath119 .",
    "the equations , governing the rg flow for @xmath117 and @xmath119 are the usual kosterlitz - thouless equations @xcite . thus , if initially @xmath122 , then @xmath123 , where @xmath9 is the rg iteration parameter .",
    "this is the nel state , characterized by a gap to triplet excitations . in the opposite limit",
    "@xmath124 the couplings flow to minus infinity , which is interpreted as a ladder with an effective ferromagnetic interchain coupling .",
    "thus we conclude that the transition line between the two states is given by the equation @xmath125 .",
    "let us note that as @xmath113 and @xmath106 increase one should include higher order terms in the operator product expansion , which leads to ( [ eq20 ] ) .",
    "the additional terms are still less relevant than the ones in ( [ eq20 ] ) but they typically couple the symmetric and antisymmetric sectors .",
    "thus , the renormalization of @xmath117 affects @xmath119 and vice versa .",
    "the location of the transition line , however , is not affected by this coupling . on the other hand we expect that lattice renormalization effects , i.e. inclusion of higher order terms in the lattice spacing , might lead to a change of the shape of the transition line , as suggested by numerical simulations ( see fig.2 . ) .",
    "we have studied the two - chain antiferromagnetic spin ladder with frustrating second neighbour interactions , using a variety of numerical and analytic methods . when the interchain nearest neighbour coupling @xmath11 is dominant the system is in a gapped `` dimerized phase '' , whereas for dominant second neighbour coupling @xmath12 the system is in a gapped `` haldane '' phase , which can be mapped onto an @xmath79 chain .",
    "these phases have the same physical origin within the low energy field theoretic framework but are distinguished by different behaviour of correlations and are separated by a first order transition line where there is a vanishing singlet - singlet gap .",
    "the system has a trivial `` valence - bond - solid '' ground state along a line in the phase diagram which separates two types of classical ising ground state .",
    "a symmetry of the hamiltonian allows these states to be mapped onto each other .",
    "using series expansions , about both ising and dimerized unperturbed states , we have computed the ground state energy and dispersion curves for singlet - triplet excitations .",
    "the latter show a qualitative change in form as the second neighbour interaction changes .",
    "our series in dimer expansions are substantially longer than in our previous study for @xmath19 , and we obtain very accurate estimates for the ground state and excitation gap , which agree very well with recent quantum monte carlo results . we have also computed ground state energies and correlations using exact diagonalizations for @xmath75 , 24 . these give a further physical of the nature of the ground state in different regions of phase diagram .",
