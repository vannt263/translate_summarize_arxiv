    "a fluid of hard rods can be considered as the simplest model for nematic liquid crystals consisting of elongated molecules . in a seminal paper in 1949 onsager showed @xcite that the steric hard - body interactions alone can bring about an isotropic - nematic transition . although the steric interactions already capture many of the essential features of liquid crystals their actual behavior is complicated by the presence of dispersion forces , flexibility , dipole moments , etc .",
    "but for certain colloidal systems of rod - like particles of synthetic or biological origin dissolved in a suitable solvent the hard rod model provides a quantitatively reliable effective description @xcite . among them",
    "the ones , which are studied in most detail , are the tabac mosaic virus and the fd - virus with length ( @xmath4 ) to diameter ( @xmath5 ) ratios @xmath6 of about 17 and 150 , respectively @xcite . from a theoretical point of view",
    "the limit of infinitely thin hard rods is especially interesting because it represents one of the very few cases for which the exact density functional is known @xcite .",
    "even more than in simple liquids , which are composed of spherically symmetric particles , surface effects are of great importance for liquid crystals . in the absence of external fields the orientation of the bulk fluid",
    "is determined by its interaction with the container walls ; this phenomenon is called anchoring @xcite . for the simplest case of a hard rod fluid near a planar hard wall , as studied theoretically by hoyst and poniewierski @xcite , the wall induces parallel alignment of the nematic director .",
    "an isotropic - nematic interface also aligns the nematic phase parallel to the interface for large aspect ratios @xmath6 while a non - trivial tilt angle arises for lower aspect ratios @xcite . in view of the substantial technical difficulties which are associated with the theoretical description on a truly microscopic scale , especially for curved surfaces ,",
    "it is a natural first step to analyze the interface between the _ isotropic _ phase and a hard wall .",
    "the corresponding density and orientational order profiles near a _",
    "planar _ wall have been determined by poniewierski @xcite in the framework of the onsager theory , who also found indications for spontaneous biaxial order at the surface already below the bulk transition to the nematic phase .",
    "mao et al . have compared this theory with computer simulations for finite aspect ratios @xmath6 @xcite and have calculated the depletion force between planar walls or large spheres immersed in a solution of rods @xcite , using the derjaguin approximation .    in the present work we focus on the orientational and positional order as well as the surface tension near _ curved _ hard walls , taking into account the steric interactions between the rods .",
    "the curvature has an appreciable effect on the structure and the thermodynamics of the fluid if the radius of curvature @xmath1 is of the order of the particle length @xmath4 .",
    "accordingly as possible applications one can think of the following systems : ( i ) rod - like particles confined to the interior of small pores within porous materials ; ( ii ) colloidal suspensions of rods that contain a second , diluted , component of larger , e.g. , spherical particles ; ( iii ) membranes , especially vesicles , immersed in colloidal rod solutions , resembling , e.g. , solutions of viruses . the curvature dependent surface tension and the depletion forces in case ( ii ) have been determined by auvray @xcite and yaman et al .",
    "@xcite for fluids of non - interacting rods corresponding to the limit of infinite dilution .",
    "their most surprising result was that the surface free energy does not contain a term linear in the curvature @xmath7 and that the quadratic term has different amplitudes for different signs of the curvature .",
    "this non - analyticity prohibits the application of the common helfrich expansion .",
    "thus for case ( iii ) above the effect of the rods on the elastic properties of the membranes can not be described by a renormalization of the bending rigidities as it is possible for membranes exposed to a suspension of spherical colloidal particles @xcite or polymers @xcite . in order to be able to assess the range of validity of the results obtained in the ideal limit of non - interacting rods , in the present paper we tackle the full problem including the inter - particle interactions by employing the onsager density - functional theory ( sec .",

    "this approach has turned out to be quantitatively reliable for @xmath23 @xcite .",
