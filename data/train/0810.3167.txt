    "the study of exclusive @xmath7 meson decays to charm and charmonium has played an important role in exploring @xmath0 violation  @xcite . amongst them",
    "the cabibbo - suppressed decays have an increased sensitivity to new physics effects and can be studied at the @xmath7 factories which , due to their high integrated luminosities , overcome the suppression factor .",
    "the @xmath8 and @xmath9 decay proceed primarily via a @xmath10 tree diagram while penguin contributions are expected to be small in the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "a large deviation of the measured @xmath0 parameters from the sm prediction can be a hint of new physics .",
    "both analyses are based on a data sample containing @xmath11 million @xmath12 pairs , collected with the belle detector  @xcite at the kekb asymmetric - energy @xmath13 collider  @xcite operating at the @xmath3 resonance .",
    "the @xmath3 meson is produced with a lorentz boost @xmath14 along the @xmath15 axis , opposite to the positron beam direction , and decays mainly into a @xmath16 or a @xmath17 pair .",
    "the reconstructed @xmath7 candidates are discriminated from background using the energy difference @xmath18 and the beam - constrained mass @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the beam energy in the center - of - mass ( cm ) system and @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the cm energy and momentum of the @xmath7 candidate .    [ [ section ] ]      the main @xmath9 diagram is not only cabbibo - suppressed but also color - suppressed .",
    "a measurement of its branching fraction , unknown so far , is shown in this paper .",
    "assuming tree dominance and factorization , the branching fraction @xmath23 ) is expected to be about @xmath24 of that of the cabibbo - favored mode @xmath25  @xcite .",
    "furthermore under these assumptions , @xmath0 violation should be negligibly small .",
    "however if penguin contributions or new physics effects are present , a non - zero charge asymmetry can occur .",
    "the @xmath26 meson is reconstructed through the @xmath27 and @xmath28 decay channels , where the @xmath29 decays to @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "inclusion of charge - conjugate modes is implied throughout the paper .",
    "contamination from the @xmath25 decays , where a kaon is misinterpreted as a pion , results in a peak at @xmath32 , which is modeled using a monte carlo ( mc ) sample .",
    "a fit performed simultaneously to all the considered @xmath26 decay modes ( fig .",
    "[ fig : psi ] ) provides the branching fraction : @xmath33 branching fractions for the @xmath34 and @xmath35 decays are extracted to measure the charge asymmetry @xmath36 .",
    "signal yields of @xmath37 and @xmath38 events for @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively , result in a charge asymmetry of @xmath39 which is consistent with no direct @xmath0 violation .",
    "finally we measure @xmath40 which is consistent with the theoretical prediction of the factorization hypothesis .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]      the time - dependent decay rate of a neutral @xmath7 meson to a @xmath0 eigenstate , such as @xmath41 , is given by : @xmath42 \\big \\ } ,   \\label{eq : basic}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 when the other @xmath7 meson in the event decays as a @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) and @xmath46 is the proper time difference between the two @xmath7 decays in the event , @xmath47 is the neutral @xmath7 lifetime , @xmath48 the mass difference between the two @xmath44 mass eigenstates .",
    "the @xmath0-violating parameters are defined as @xmath49 where @xmath50 is a complex observable depending on the @xmath44 and @xmath45 decay amplitudes to the final state and the relation between the @xmath7 meson mass eigenstates and its flavor eigenstates . when ignoring penguin corrections , the sm predictions for the @xmath0 parameters are @xmath51 and @xmath52 , where @xmath53/[v_{td}v^*_{tb}]$ ] and @xmath54 is the @xmath0 eigenvalue of @xmath41 , which is @xmath55 when the decay proceeds through the @xmath56 or @xmath57 wave , or @xmath58 for the @xmath59 wave",
    ". a significant shift of the @xmath0 parameters from the sm predictions can be a sign for new physics .",
    "the @xmath60 mesons are reconstructed in the @xmath61 and @xmath62 modes .",
    "the signal is extracted from a two - dimensional unbinned maximum likelihood fit in the @xmath63 vs. @xmath64 plane .",
    "we obtain @xmath65 signal events with a signal purity of @xmath66 .",

    "we perform a time - integrated angular analysis in the transversity basis  @xcite .",
    "the differential decay rate as a function of the transversity angle @xmath67 reads @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the @xmath0-even and @xmath0-odd fractions of the three transversity components respectively .",

    ", we reconstruct the tag - side @xmath7 vertex and its flavor inclusively from properties of particles that are not associated with the reconstructed @xmath8 decay  @xcite . the tagging information is represented by two parameters , the flavor of the tagging @xmath44 , @xmath78 , and the tagging quality given by seven @xmath79 intervals from @xmath80 meaning no flavor discrimination to @xmath81 for unambiguous flavor assignment .",
    "equation  [ eq : basic ] is modified to incorporate the effect of incorrect flavor assignment , the @xmath0-odd dilution , and the description of background events .",
    "the signal - to - background fraction is obtained on an event - by - event basis , using the previous fits of the @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath82 distributions .",
    "the free parameters in the fit are @xmath83 and @xmath84 ; these are determined by maximizing an unbinned likelihood function for all events in the fit region .",
