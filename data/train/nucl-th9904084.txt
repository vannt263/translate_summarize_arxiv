    "the majority of nuclear phenomena have been successfully described in relativistic mean - field theory using only hadronic degrees of freedom@xcite . however , due to the observations which revealed the medium modification of the internal structure of the baryons@xcite , it has become essential to explicitly incorporate the quark - gluon degrees of freedom while respecting the established model based on the hadronic degrees of freedom in nuclei .",
    "one of the first models put forward along these lines is the quark - meson coupling ( qmc ) model , proposed by guichon@xcite , which describes nuclear matter as a collection of non - overlapping mit bags interacting through the self - consistent exchange of scalar @xmath13 and vector @xmath14 mesons in the mean field approximation with the meson fields directly coupled to the quarks@xcite .",
    "the scalar @xmath15 meson is supposed to simulate the exchange of correlated pairs of pions and may represent a very broad resonance observed in @xmath16 scattering , while the vector @xmath14 meson is identified with the actual meson having a mass of about 780 mev . in the chiral models ,",
    "the scalar @xmath13 and vetcor @xmath14 mean fields represent the @xmath4 quark condensates@xcite .",
    "the qmc model thus incorporates explicitly the quark degrees of freedom and this has nontrivial consequences@xcite .",
    "it also have been extended to study superheavy finite nuclei@xcite .    in the so - called modified quark meson coupling model ( mqmc)@xcite ,",
    "it has been further suggested that including a medium - dependent bag parameter may be essential for the success of relativistic nuclear phenomenology .",
    "it was found that when the bag parameter is significantly reduced in the nuclear medium with respect to its free - space value , large cancelling isoscalar lorentz scalar and vector potentials for the nucleon in nuclear matter emerge naturally .",
    "such potentials are comparable to those suggested by relativistic nuclear phenomenology and finite density qcd sum rules@xcite .",
    "the density - dependence of the bag parameter is introduced by coupling it to the scalar meson field@xcite .",
    "this coupling is motivated by invoking the nontopological soliton model for the nucleon@xcite . in this model a scalar soliton field provides the confinement of the quarks .",
    "this effect of the soliton field is , roughly speaking , mimicked by the introduction of the bag parameter in the bag model .",
    "when a nucleon soliton is placed in a nuclear environment , the scalar soliton field interacts with the scalar mean field .",
    "it is thus reasonable to couple the bag parameter to the scalar mean fields@xcite .",
    "the qmc model was extended to finite temperatures to investigate the liquid - gas phase transition in nuclear matter@xcite .",
    "recently , the mqmc model has been also extended to finite temperature@xcite and has been applied to the study of the properties of nuclear matter where it was found that the bag parameter decreases appreciably above a critical temperature @xmath17 mev indicating the onset of quark deconfinement@xcite .",
    "the effect of glueball exchange as well as a realization of the broken scale invariance of quantum chromodynamics has also been investigated in the mqmc model through the introduction of a dilaton field@xcite .",
    "it was found that the introduction of the dilaton potential improves the shape of the saturation curve at t=0 and affects hot nuclear matter significantly@xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we extend the mqmc model to hot hypernuclear matter by introducing the scalar @xmath18 and vector @xmath19 mean fields that are coupled to the @xmath6-quark in addition to the @xmath13 and @xmath14 fields which are coupled to the @xmath4-quarks .",

    "this indicates the onset of quark deconfinement above the critical temperature : at high enough temperature and/or baryon density there is a phase transition from the baryon - meson phase to the quark - gluon phase .",
    "this behaviour is also in qualitative agreement with our earlier results for @xmath12 nuclear matter@xcite except that the decrease here is more dramatic indicating that the phase transition is much stronger than in ordinary nuclear matter .",
    "our results are also comparable to those obtained from lattice qcd calculations which have so far only explored the zero baryon density axis of the phase diagram in a meaningful way .",
    "the lattice results with 2 light quark flavors , indicate that the transition from hadronic matter to a quark - gluon plasma occurs at a temperature @xmath154 mev and that for low densities it may not be a phase transition at all but what is called a rapid crossover@xcite .",

    "it is seen that the the nucleons are dominant at low temperatures and their relative abundance @xmath161 decreases very slowly at first and deviates very little from @xmath162 until the temperature reaches about 100 mev when @xmath161 starts to decrease rapidly and becomes negligibly small for temperatures larger than about 280 mev . on the other hand ,",
    "the abundance of the hyperons is negligible at low temperatures and increases significantly as the temperature is increased beyond @xmath163 mev .",
    "they become more abundant than the nucleons for temperatures larger than 200 mev .",
    "the relative abundance of hyperons in high energy heavy ion collisions can therefore be used as a simple thermometer to measure the temperature of the hot nuclear matter produced in the reaction and probably to study the phase transition to the quark gluon plasma .    in conclusion , we have generalized the mqmc model to the case of hot hypernuclear matter by introducing two new meson fields that couple to the strange quarks and using @xmath7 symmetry to relate the coupling constants .",
