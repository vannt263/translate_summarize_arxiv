    "= 15000 = 15000    this paper has two aims .",
    "first ,  we  derive upper limits on the masses @xmath10 of any supermassive bhs in two giant , pure - disk galaxies .",
    "this provides data for a study ( kormendy et  al .",
    "2010 ) of the lack of correlation ( kormendy & gebhardt 2001 ) between bhs and galaxy disks .",
    "second , we inventory disks , pseudobulges , and classical bulges in the nearby universe and show that giant , pure - disk galaxies are not rare .",
    "this highlights the biggest problem with our mostly well supported picture of hierarchical clustering : how can so many pure - disk galaxies form , given so much merger violence ?",
    "both studies need the same observations : photometry to measure structure and spectroscopy to measure velocity dispersions and masses .      in   2 , we measure stellar velocity dispersions in high - mass , sc ",
    "scd galaxies that contain only nuclei or extremely small pseudobulges . in  3 , we derive hst- and ground - based surface photometry of the most useful subset of our galaxies to see whether they contain small classical bulges , pseudobulges , or nuclei and to measure nuclear masses and @xmath10 limits .",
    "sections2 and 3 are long . readers who need @xmath11 and @xmath10 results can find them in figure 1 and table  1 .",
    "readers who are interested in the smallest pseudobulges can concentrate on  3 .",
    "readers whose interest is the challenge that pure - disk galaxies present for our picture of galaxy formation should skip directly to  4 .",
    "nuclei are expected to have velocity dispersions that range from those of globular clusters , @xmath12 km s@xmath2 , to values similar to those in the smallest classical bulges and ellipticals ( e.g. , m32 : @xmath13 km s@xmath2 ; tonry 1984 ; 1987 ; dressler & richstone 1988 ; van der marel et  al .  1994a , b ; bender et  al .",
    "but nuclei are faint and embedded in bright disks .",
    "the @xmath11 constraint implies that we need high dispersion , and the faintness implies that we need a large telescope . as a result ,",
    "few @xmath11 measurements of nuclei are available .",
    "the best object  now very well measured  is m33 , whose exceptionally well defined nucleus has a velocity dispersion of @xmath14 km s@xmath2 ( kormendy & mcclure 1993 ; gebhardt et  al .",
    "we use it as a test case for our observations .",
    "the `` gold standard '' of nuclear dispersion measurements is walcher et  al .",
    "( 2005 ) ; they used the ultraviolet and visual echelle spectrograph on the very large telescope to measure 9 nuclei of generally modest - sized galaxies at a resolution of @xmath15 .",
    "this paper reports @xmath16 measurements of @xmath11  in  m33 , ngc3338 , ngc3810 , ngc5457 , ngc6503 , and ngc6946 . in choosing targets",
    ", we favored the largest pure - disk galaxies that have the smallest possible pseudobulges ( kormendy & kennicutt 2004 ) and the smallest possible distances .",
    "the most important galaxies for our purposes are ngc 5457 = m101 and ngc 6946 .",
    "a closely similar object is ic 342 , for which bker et  al .",
    "( 1999 ) measured a nuclear dispersion of @xmath17 km s@xmath2 at a spectral resolution of @xmath18 .",
    "all three are scd galaxies with extremely small pseudobulges or nuclear star clusters but essentially the largest possible asymptotic rotation velocities @xmath19",
    "km s@xmath2 consistent with our requirement that they contain no classical bulges .    late in our data reduction , we were scooped by ho et  al .",
    "( 2009 ) , who measured @xmath11 and collected published @xmath11 data for 428 galaxies .",
    "all of our objects are included in their paper . however , their instrumental velocity dispersion is @xmath20 km s@xmath2 , whereas ours is 8 km s@xmath2 .",
    "our measurements therefore provide important confirmation .",
    "most of their measurements prove to be remarkably accurate , even when @xmath21 .",
    "we disagree on two values .",
    "also , our measurements have estimated errors that are a factor of @xmath22 smaller than theirs .",
    "confidence in our understanding of the smallest central velocity dispersions in the biggest pure - disk galaxies is correspondingly increased .",
    "the spectra were obtained with the high resolution spectrograph ( hrs : tull 1988 ) and the 9 m hobby - eberly telescope ( het : ramsey et  al .",
    "the queue - scheduled observations were made between 2006 october 17 and 2007 april 21 .",
    "hrs is fed by optical fibers ; the image scrambling provided by the 34 m long fibers guarantees that different seeing conditions , source light distributions , and object centering accuracies do not affect the wavelength resolution .",
    "we used 3@xmath23 fibers .",
    "a central fiber was postitioned on the galaxy nucleus and two bracketing `` sky fibers '' measured the night sky and galaxy disk at radii of 10@xmath23 immediately outside the nucleus .",
    "we confirmed the nominal resolution of @xmath16 by measuring night sky emission lines .",
    "the corresponding instrumental dispersion is @xmath24 km s@xmath2 at the ca infrared triplet lines , 8498  , 8542  , and 8662  .",
    "the instrument is an echelle ; the above lines were positioned in three orders that were combined into a single spectrum as described in  2.2 .",
    "we obtained 4 , 900 s exposures of ngc 6946 .",
    "exposure times were 600 s per spectrum for the other galaxies ; we obtained two such spectra for m33 , three for ngc 6503 , four for ngc 3338 , five for ngc 5457 , and seven for ngc 3810 . in a few cases , seeing or transparency was poor ",
    "the latter is judged by signal level and the former is judged by the contrast of the nucleus against the disk , that is , by the ratio of the flux from the galaxy to that from the sky plus disk .",
    "low - quality spectra were not reduced .",
    "each spectrum was taken in 23 subexposures to allow correction for cosmic ray hits .",
    "we also obtained 1 s to 50 s exposures of five velocity standard stars , hd 117176 ( g4 v ) , hr 1327 ( g4 iii ) , @xmath25 cyg ( k0 iii ) , @xmath26 tau ( k0 iii ) , and @xmath27 and ( k3 iii ) .",
    "we have used the k0 ",
    "k3 stars in many previous papers ; they reliably fit the spectra of low- to moderate - dispersion galaxies very well . in any case , ( 1 ) the ca infrared triplet region is relatively insensitive to template mismatch ( dressler 1984 ) , and ( 2 ) the fcq program that provides our final dispersion values is specifically engineered to minimize problems with template mismatch ( bender 1990 ) .",
    "spectral reductions were carried out using the interactive image processing system iraf ( tody 1993 ) .",
    "the echelle software package was used to remove instrumental signatures from the data . for each night",
    ", we created a bias frame , a continuum flat , and a thorium - argon arc - lamp spectrum from calibration data taken before and after the observations .",
    "science frames were first bias and overscan corrected .",
    "bad pixels were flagged .",
    "next , we removed cosmic ray hits using the spectroscopy - optimized version of l.a.cosmic ( van dokkum 2001 ) , and we coadded the three spectra obtained for each galaxy .",
    "we traced and fitted the spectral orders in the continuum flats using 3@xmath28-order legendre polynomials .",
    "we removed the spectral signature of the continuum lamp from the flat fields by fitting the continuum using 7@xmath29-order legendre polynomials along the dispersion direction and divided the flat field frames by the fits .",
    "next , we extracted the science spectra ( galaxies and velocity standard stars ) using these normalized flat fields to obtain one - dimensional spectra for each order .",
    "this provided one , multi - order spectrum of the galaxy nucleus from the object fiber plus two `` sky '' spectra at galactocentric distances of 10@xmath23 bracketing the nucleus .",
    "finally , all spectra were wavelength calibrated using the th - ar lamp spectra to an accuracy of @xmath90.02 pixel @xmath300.003   @xmath300.1 km s@xmath2 .",
    "the remaining tasks are sky subtraction and the combination of separate orders into a single final spectrum rewritten on a @xmath31 scale .",
    "these steps were carried out using a combination of iraf and vista ( lauer 1985 , stover 1988 ) .",
    "two aspects of the reduction are tricky and require special care :    the first is sky subtraction .",
    "the good news is that sky spectra are taken simultaneously with the object spectra ; this is important because sky lines vary on short time scales .",
    "the bad news is that sky subtraction is more difficult than it is with long - slit spectrographs , because we can not average many spatial elements to get high signal - to - noise ratios @xmath32 .",
    "there are only two sky fibers .",
    "sky subtraction contributes significant noise .",
    "moreover , the sky fibers have slightly different throughputs than the object fiber , so the two sky spectra must be scaled ( differently ) to the object spectrum .",
    "sky subtraction is more difficult for some objects than for others , because the ca triplet lines are badly positioned with respect to night sky lines for some galaxy redshifts and benignly positioned for others .",
    "the second tricky problem is the polynomial fit to the continuum that must be divided into each spectral order to remove the blaze efficiency function .",
    "these functions are approximately @xmath33-shaped .",
    "they are not vertical at the ends of orders , but the signal is low there and hence multiplied upward by the continuum division .",
    "when ca lines fall well away from the ends of orders , then continuum fitting is easy and results are robustly reliable .",
    "but when ca triplet lines fall near the ends of orders , then ( 1 ) the fit becomes difficult because there is little continuum to fit , and ( 2 ) small fitting errors matter a lot because the line profile is divided by the low blaze efficiency .",
    "both problems are differently severe for different galaxies . as a result , the spectral lines that produce the most reliable results are different for different galaxies .",
    "we therefore discuss the consequences for each galaxy separately .    after continuum division , we kept parts of three orders that contain the ca triplet lines .",
    "two wavelength regions were used , 8450  8750   in 1024 pixels for the fourier quotient program ( fq : sargent et  al .",
    "1977 ) and 8450  8730   in 2048 pixels for the fourier correlation quotient program ( fcq : bender 1990 ) .",
    "the final reduced spectra and the best fit of a standard star spectrum are illustrated in figure 1 .",
    "our velocity dispersion measurements are discussed in  2.3 and listed in table 1 .",
    "we included m33 to check our ability to measure small @xmath11 .",
    "we obtained two , 600s exposures on different nights .",
    "they presented no problems .",
    "the nucleus is very compact and high in surface brightness and very distinct from the surrounding  disk ( see figure 1 in  3.1 here and kormendy & mcclure 1993 ) . by a factor of 2 , it provides the highest flux of any of our galaxies .",
    "sky lines fall in the red wings of the 8498   and 8542   lines and in both wings of the 8662   line .",
    "but the galaxy signal is 11 and 9 times larger than the sky signal in the two exposures .",
    "we measured the factor by which to scale the sky spectra to the galaxy spectra to 2% accuracy using 56 and 61 emission lines in the two spectra .",
    "this results in excellent sky subtraction .",
    "the continuum fit is relatively easy at the heliocentric velocity of @xmath34 km s@xmath2 ( ned ) .",
    "it also helps that the absorption lines are so narrow that they clobber few continuum pixels .",
    "combining orders is easy and the dispersion measurements are reliable .",
    "fq and fcq give consistent results .",
    "the k3 iii standard star @xmath27 and gives consistently larger scatter in @xmath11 values than the other stars ; we omit it from our averages",
    ". then the average velocity dispersion given by the other 4 standard stars is @xmath35 km s@xmath2 using fq and @xmath36 km s@xmath2 using fcq .",
    "quoted errors are for any one standard star . adding in quadrature the estimated error in the mean from averaging results for 4 stars , we get @xmath37 km s@xmath2 using fcq . we adopt this result .",
    "we tested it further by reducing six subregions of the spectra .",
    "they isolate individual ca lines or combinations of weaker lines between the ca lines .",
    "fcq finds that the average intrinsic widths of the template lines in the wavelength regions tested are @xmath38 km s@xmath2 to 38 km s@xmath2 .",
    "signal - to - noise ratios are lower and estimated @xmath11 errors are bigger when subregions are  used . but results for different subregions are  consistent . in particular , we found no significant dependence of the measured @xmath11 on @xmath39 ( see also ",
    "there is a hint that @xmath11 may be 1.0 km s@xmath2 smaller in m33 than we derive .",
    "it is not significant , so we retain the result from the whole spectrum .",
    "similar wavelength region tests gave similar results for all galaxies .",
    "_ we always tried at least one wavelength region that contains only a single ca triplet line .",
    "this guarantees that template mismatch can not be a problem . _    our result agrees very well with @xmath40 km s@xmath2 measured with @xmath41 km s@xmath2 by kormendy & mcclure ( 1993 ) .",
    "gebhardt et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) derived an integrated velocity dispersion for the whole nucleus of @xmath42 km s@xmath2 using hst  stis .",
    "merritt et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) , also with stis , found a central dispersion of @xmath43 km s@xmath2 but a rapid rise in @xmath11 to @xmath44 km s@xmath2 at @xmath45 radius ; ferrarese ( 2002 ) quoted an integrated velocity dispersion of @xmath46 km s@xmath2 from these data .",
    "most recently , ho et  al .",
    "( 2009 ) got @xmath47 km s@xmath2 in their catalog of 428 @xmath11 measurements ; this is remarkably accurate given that @xmath48 km s@xmath2 .",
    "we adopt our measurement of @xmath37 km s@xmath2 ; it was obtained with the highest wavelength resolution .      despite having the largest @xmath11 values in our sample  which means that there are fewer continuum pixels to fit ",
    "these are the easiest galaxies to reduce .",
    "the reason is that the heliocentric velocities ( @xmath49 and 993 km s@xmath2 , respectively ) put the ca triplet lines far from night sky lines and far from the ends of orders .",
    "sky subtraction and continuum fitting are both easy .",
    "wavelength range tests show that all lines give reliable results .",
    "= -4pt = -4pt    for ngc 3810 , we obtained four , 600 s exposures with good seeing and nucleus centering , all taken on different nights .",
    "the flux in the nuclear spectra ranged from 3.8 to 4.7 times that of the sky spectra in the four exposures .",
    "sky apertures were located at @xmath50 on each side of the galaxy major axis .",
    "they clearly contained galaxy absorption lines .",
    "because of disk rotation , their wavelengths differed from those of the corresponding lines in the nuclear spectrum .",
    "it was necessary to be exceptionally careful to subtract disk absorption and sky emission lines correctly from the nuclear spectrum .",
    "this was done by cleaning the sky lines out of each sky spectrum to leave only the galaxy lines , smoothing the result slightly , and subtracting this from the sky spectrum to leave only sky lines .",
    "the cleaned sky spectrum was clipped to zero at low intensities to reduce noise and leave behind only the significant sky emission .",
    "the result was subtracted from the nuclear  spectrum .",
    "this was done separately for each of the four nucleus spectra .",
    "fcq gave a velocity dispersion of @xmath51 km s@xmath2 for the nucleus .",
    "this is the mean of the @xmath11 values for the four spectra .",
    "each @xmath11 for one spectrum is an average over four standard stars .",
    "the quoted error is the sum in quadrature of the estimated error given by fcq for one spectrum reduced with one star and the error in the mean for four standard stars .",
    "our @xmath11 measurement can be compared with @xmath52 km s@xmath2 measured with an instrumental @xmath53 km s@xmath2 by hraudeau et  al .",
    "( 1999 ) and @xmath54 km s@xmath2 measured with @xmath55 km s@xmath2 by vega beltrn et  al .",
    "ho et  al .",
    "( 2009 ) adopt @xmath56 km s@xmath2 credited to hyperleda ( paturel et  al .",
    "2003 ) who averaged the above values .",
    "we also reduced the absorption - line spectrum obtained through the `` sky '' aperture and got @xmath57 km s@xmath2 at @xmath58 along the major axis of the disk of ngc 3810 .",
    "this is not significantly different from the nuclear dispersion .    for ngc 3338",
    ", we also obtained four , 600 s exposures on different nights .",
    "the galaxy flux again was @xmath59 times that in the sky spectra , but this time , the sky spectra showed no significant galaxy lines .",
    "because the overall @xmath32 was also a factor of two lower than for ngc 3810 and because all galaxy lines are benignly positioned with respect to night sky lines , we reduced only the sum of the four nuclear spectra .",
    "sky subtraction was easy and fcq gave @xmath60 km s@xmath2 .    for comparison ,",
    "hraudeau et  al .",
    "( 1999 ) got @xmath61 km s@xmath2 at @xmath53 km s@xmath2 , and ho et  al .",
    "( 2009 ) got @xmath62 km s@xmath2 at @xmath20 km s@xmath2 . our two largest and most easily measured @xmath11 values are the only ones that disagree with the ho et  al .",
    "( 2009 ) measurements . for ngc 3810 ,",
    "ho adopted a smaller @xmath11 from hyperleda .",
    "for ngc 3338 , fig .  1 shows  that @xmath63 km s@xmath2 , the near - central value in m32 .",
    "we are confident in our result .",
    "note :  our science conclusions are based on low-@xmath11 galaxies .",
    "no conclusions depend on ngc 3338 .",
    "it is included to anchor our measurements at the high-@xmath11 end in fig .  1 .",
    "9.3truein      ngc 6503 and ngc 6946 (  2.3.4 ) are more difficult than m33 . at heliocentric velocities of @xmath936 km s@xmath2 and 46 kms@xmath2 ( hyperleda ) , their ca triplet 8498   and 8542   lines",
    "are bracketed by sky lines where they merge into the continuum .",
    "most of each line profile is safe , but special care is required in sky subtraction .",
    "the 8662   line falls in a `` picket fence '' of night sky lines .",
    "they subtract well , but it is necessary to interpret results from this line with caution .",
    "sky scaling factors were again determined from several dozen night sky lines .",
    "these galaxies are also difficult because the nuclei are faint .",
    "the @xmath32 was therefore improved by subtracting sky only above a level of about 1.5 times the rms fluctuations in brightness .",
    "that is , significant sky lines were subtracted , but the sky was not subtracted between the lines where it consists mostly of noise .",
    "this is consistent with advice in the online hrs manual http://www.as.utexas.edu/mcdonald/het/het.html , links on the hrs and thence on hrs data reduction tips .",
    "the less - than - fortuitous redshifts also put the 8542   and 8662   lines near the ends of spectral orders .",
    "continuum fitting is more uncertain than normal for these lines .",
    "therefore the most reliable velocity dispersion comes from the 8498   line .    for ngc 6503 , we took two , 600 s exposures on different nights .",
    "the spectra of the nucleus are only 2.5  and  2.1 times brighter than the corresponding sky spectra .",
    "therefore ( i ) the @xmath32 is relatively low and ( ii ) the seeing or the centering  more specifically : the degree to which the nuclear spectrum isolates light from the nucleus  is significantly better in one exposure than in the other .",
    "we reduce only the better exposure to measure the velocity dispersion of the nucleus .",
    "we reduce the sum of the sky exposures to get the velocity dispersion  albeit with still lower @xmath32  in the disk .",
    "the sky apertures were positioned at @xmath64pa @xmath65 from the major axis ; that is , relatively near the minor axis of the @xmath66 , highly inclined disk of ngc 6503 .",
    "the nuclear spectrum was sky - subtracted using a median of the associated `` sky '' exposures .",
    "we assume that the inner exponential profile of the galaxy disk ",
    "i.e. , the outermost part of the profile that is fitted with an exponential in figure 16  extends to the center .",
    "then `` sky subtraction '' removes both the night sky emission lines and the contribution to the nuclear spectrum from the underlying disk .",
    "this leaves us with a spectrum ( figure 1 ) of the combination of the nucleus and pseudobulge ( see figure 16 , where @xmath67 is the radius of the spectral aperture ) .",
    "fcq gives @xmath68 km s@xmath2 for this spectrum .",
    "as noted above , the @xmath69   line alone is more reliable than the other ca triplet lines , given the hrs configuration and galaxy redshift . using only this line",
    ", fcq gives @xmath70 km s@xmath2 .",
    "we adopt the latter value .",
    "the sky exposures are noisy , but they show absorption lines .",
    "we therefore reduced the sum of the sky exposures to give us an estimate of the velocity dispersion in the galaxy disk . subtracting sky emission lines without affecting",
    "the galaxy absorption lines was tricky , because we could not afford sky exposures taken far from the galaxy .",
    "fortunately , we had one spectrum each of ngc 3810 and ngc 5457 taken on the same night as one of the ngc 6503 spectra and one more spectrum of each of these galaxies taken a few nights later .",
    "their redshifts are different enough so that galaxy lines in their `` sky '' spectra do not overlap .",
    "we therefore scaled the above four sky spectra of two galaxies together in intensity and medianed them , rejecting one low value .",
    "this very effectively removed absorption lines from the median sky spectrum .",
    "the median was scaled to the emission - line strengths in the summed ngc 6503 sky spectrum and subtracted .",
    "the result was a noisy but relatively clean spectrum of the disk of ngc 6503 at radius @xmath71 at pa = 53@xmath72 from the major axis .",
    "this corresponds to a true radius of 30@xmath23 along the major axis . for this spectrum ,",
    "fcq gave @xmath73 km s@xmath2 .",
    "using only the @xmath74 8498   line , fcq gave @xmath75 km s@xmath2 .",
    "we adopt the latter value .    in  3.4 , we use @xmath11 to constrain @xmath10 .",
    "however , a problem is revealed when we compare our central @xmath11 with published results :    ngc 6503 is a well known galaxy ; it has an extended flat rotation curve and one of the best rotation curve decompositions into visible and dark matter ( bottema 1997 ) . and it was one of the first galaxies in which a drop in @xmath11 toward the galaxy center was reported .",
    "bottema ( 1989 ) measured the dispersion profile shown in figure 2 .",
    "he found a maximum @xmath76 km s@xmath2 at @xmath77 and then a drop at larger radii to @xmath9 15  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "the outward drop in @xmath11 is no surprise .",
    "but at @xmath78 , bottema observed a highly significant drop in @xmath11 to 25 km s@xmath2 in two independent central radial bins .",
    "this was unexpected at the time , but it has since become a common observation ( e.g. , emsellem et  al .",
    "2001 ; see especially the extensive results on `` @xmath11 drops '' from the sauron group : ganda et  al .",
    "2006 ; falcn - barroso et  al .",
    "2006 ; peletier et  al .",
    "2007a , b ) .",
    "small central velocity dispersions are now known to be a defining signature of pseudobulges that are believed to be grown by secular evolution of isolated galaxy disks ( kormendy 1993 ; emsellem et  al .",
    "2001 ; mrquez et  al .  2003",
    "; kormendy & kennicutt 2004 ; chung & bureau 2004 ; peletier et  al .",
    "2006 , 2007a , b ; kormendy & fisher 2008 ) .",
    "we will conclude in  3.4 that ngc 6503 contains a small pseudobulge , based on other classification criteria .",
    "but we do not confirm the central @xmath11 drop .",
    "instead , our measurement of @xmath79 km s@xmath2 agrees with @xmath80 km s@xmath2 observed by barth et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) using the ca triplet lines at @xmath81 km s@xmath2 .",
    "both values agree with the dispersion peak observed by bottema ( 1989 ) .",
    "who is correct ?",
    "is there a central @xmath11 drop ?",
    "some aspects of the observations favor the larger central @xmath11 .",
    "the strongest argument is that the two results based on the best instrumental @xmath82 = 25 km s@xmath2 ( barth et  al .  2002 ) and @xmath82 = 8 km s@xmath2 ( this paper ) agree with each other in disagreeing with bottema s result based on @xmath82 = 35 km s@xmath2 .",
    "a possible danger in bottema s measurement is ( 1 ) that his slit width controlled his instrumental resolution and ( 2 ) that his slit may have been wider than the image of the nucleus . if the nucleus underfills the slit , then it is easy to underestimate its @xmath11 .",
    "another possible problem is the wavelength region used .",
    "we and barth observed at @xmath83  , where an admixture of young stars has almost no effect on @xmath11 measurements .",
    "bottema observed at 5020  .",
    "cid fernandes et  al .",
    "( 2005 ) show that the center is dominated by intermediate - age stars",
    ". their blue spectrum may not be as well matched by standard stars or  for broad absorption lines  as suitable for @xmath11 measurements as are near - infrared spectra .",
    "finally , bottema measured @xmath11 via cross - correlation ; this is less robust than fcq ( this paper ) or than fitting broadened star spectra to the galaxy spectrum in pixel space ( barth et  al .",
    "2002 ) . of course , these caveats are not conclusive .",
    "some aspects of the observations probably did not cause the disagreement .",
    "bottema s exposure time was a heroic 35,400  s ( 9 h 50 m ) taken in 1200 s chunks with the 2.5 m isaac newton telescope at la palma .",
    "barth s spectrum was a 3600 s exposure taken with the palomar 5 m hale telescope , and ours is a 600 s exposure taken with the 9 m hobby - eberly telescope .",
    "barth got high @xmath32 , and we got @xmath84 per resolution element .",
    "however , bottema s spectrum had good enough @xmath32 to allow him to measure small velocity dispersions at large radii .",
    "so it is unlikely that the central @xmath32 was a problem .",
    "also , our measurement of the disk dispersion at a major - axis radius of 30@xmath23 agrees well with bottema s results ( figure 2 ) .",
    "there is no reason to believe that either set of observations is unable to measure small dispersions .",
    "note that we measure mostly the radial velocity dispersion near the minor axis of the disk , whereas bottema measured mostly the azimuthal dispersion ; we do not expect them to be exactly equal .",
    "finally , spatial resolution is not the issue : bottema had 10 to 17 seeing ; barth had 15 to 20 seeing , and we had @xmath85 fwhm seeing .",
    "moreover , our aperture was 3@xmath23 in diameter , and bottema ( 1989 ) and barth et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) binned their spectra in spatial pixels of 264 and 374 , respectively .",
    "so all three observations have poor spatial resolution .",
    "it is remarkable that bottema saw a dispersion drop over a radius of @xmath86 pixels of 374 each .",
    "alternatively , could all results in figure 2 be correct ?",
    "this could happen as a consequence of the fact that we and barth observed near @xmath87   whereas bottema observed near 5020  .",
    "if the nucleus is colder than the pseudobulge and if it is brighter in the blue than in the infrared , then it could dominate bottema s result but not ours .",
    "no blue - band hst image is available to check whether the @xmath88-band photometry derived in  3.4 ( figure  16 ) is relevant for understanding bottema s data .",
    "however , the brightness contrast of the nucleus plus pseudobulge in bottema s spectrum ( his figure 2 ) looks higher than the contrast in our spectrum . also , recall that cid fernandes et  al .",
    "( 2005 ) found that the center is dominated by intermediate - age stars .",
    "it is possible that bottema measured a different stellar population than we did or than barth did .",
    "we therefore do not know whether ngc 6503 has a central drop in @xmath11 . in ",
    "3.4 , we use both @xmath11 values to derive nuclear mass - to - light ratios .",

    "( 2010 ) mass estimator used in  3.4 is valid for any set of test particles  even ones that contribute no significant mass  provided that @xmath11 and the brightness distribution are measured for the same stars .",
    "this means that we _ must _ use our @xmath11 measured in @xmath88 band to match the hst surface photometry and to derive the nuclear mass @xmath90 .",
    "we also use it to get our @xmath10 limit .",
    "ngc 6946 has almost the same redshift and therefore almost the same data reduction problems as ngc 6503 ( see the first three paragraphs of the previous section ) .",
    "however , we have much higher-@xmath32 spectra of ngc 6946 , because we have four , 900 s exposures , obtained , as always , on different nights . the nuclear contrast is better than for ngc 6503 also : the nuclear spectra are 9  11 times brighter than the `` sky '' spectra . since the latter",
    "are taken at 10@xmath23 distance from the nuclear aperture , they are , as usual , well within the galaxy .",
    "they were positioned in the transition region between what will turn out to be a tiny pseudobulge and the galaxy s exponential disk . however , galaxy absorption lines are negligible in the sky spectra , and sky subtraction was straight - forward .    for this galaxy ,",
    "the best sky subtraction was obtained by scaling the two spectra given by the sky apertures to have the same average emission - line intensities as the nuclear spectrum using a single scaling factor for each aperture ( the spectra were taken over a period of only six nights ) .",
    "the scale factors were determined for the two apertures by measuring the strengths of 239 and 297 lines in the four ngc 6946 spectra and in two m33 spectra obtained during the same nights .",
    "( the number of lines used is not the same for the two sky apertures because different pixellation of almost - unresolved lines causes different problems  for example , with blends  for different lines . )",
    "the scale factors are determined to @xmath91 1% .",
    "the sky - subtracted spectra are very clean .    however , the velocity dispersion in ngc 6946 is slightly larger than that in ngc 6503 , and the redshift is slightly different , too .",
    "the wings of the ca triplet lines reach closer to the ends of the spectral orders , so continuum - fitting was more of a problem .",
    "the best single spectrum yielded an fcq velocity dispersion of @xmath92 km s@xmath2 .",
    "all four spectra summed but analyzed only using the safest ( 8494  ) line gave @xmath93 km s@xmath2 .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratios in the best spectrum and in the sum of four spectra were 292 and 416 per resolution element , respectively .",
    "the errors in @xmath11 are completely dominated by problems with the continuum removal .",
    "they may be underestimated by fcq , which bases its error estimates on @xmath32 and on the quality of the star - galaxy spectral match .",

    "any oversubtraction or undersubtraction of the sky spectrum would result , respectively , in an underestimate or an overestimate of @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , for each of our three , 600 s exposure spectra , we measured the sky spectra scaling factors using 45  55 emission lines .",
    "these factors produced relatively clean sky - subtracted absorption - line profiles .",
    "each spectrum was reduced individually through both the fq and fcq programs .",
    "this provides a consistency check for the three separate sky subtractions .",
    "0.1pt    however , sky subtraction proves not to be the biggest problem with the ngc 5457 spectral reductions . instead , continuum fitting is especially difficult because the galaxy s redshift puts the two red triplet lines too close to the ends of orders .",

    "the low - bulge - mass - fraction error bar is similarly derived by assigning 1/2 of the classical bulge mass ( not including ellipticals ) to the pseudobulges ; this also is inconsistent with observations .",
    "= -4pt = -4pt    our conclusions are robust to uncertainties in assumptions .",
    "for example , if we use the same mass - to - light ratio for all stellar populations , then @xmath390% of the mass is in bulges and ellipticals , @xmath391% is in pseudobulges , and @xmath392% is in pseudobulges plus disks .",
    "the stellar mass results are even robust to any uncertainty in the distinction between classical and pseudo bulges , because the ratio of stellar mass in both together is @xmath393 to 0.30 for the above possible choices of mass - to - light ratios .",
    "that is , the total mass in bulges is small because most @xmath394 values in the field are small .",
    "note also that our procedure underestimates disk and pseudobulge masses significantly , because we do not inventory cold gas and because we do not correct for internal absorption , which is large in some disks but small in bulges and ellipticals .",
    "we conclude that , in the nearby field , most stellar mass and most baryonic mass is in disks ; in fact , in pure disks . the ratio of pseudobulge - to - bulge stellar mass is @xmath395 ; that is , significant but not dominant .",
    "however , the importance of pseudobulges is not in their total mass but rather in the fact that they are not merger remnants . from the point of view of galaxy formation by hierarchical clustering",
    ", their mass should be included in the disk inventory .",
    "so only 1/5 of the stellar mass in giant galaxies in our 8-mpc - radius , field volume is in probable remnants of major mergers . and",

    "<S> to better understand the prevalence of bulgeless galaxies in the nearby field , we dissect giant sc  scd galaxies with _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) </S>",
    "<S> photometry and hobby - eberly telescope ( het ) spectroscopy . </S>",
    "<S> we use the het high resolution spectrograph ( resolution @xmath0 ) to measure stellar velocity dispersions in the nuclear star clusters and ( pseudo)bulges of the pure - disk galaxies m33 , m101 , ngc 3338 , ngc 3810 , ngc 6503 , and ngc 6946 . </S>",
    "<S> the dispersions range from @xmath1 km s@xmath2 in the nucleus of m33 to @xmath3 km s@xmath2 in the pseudobulge of ngc 3338 . </S>",
    "<S> we use hst archive images to measure the brightness profiles of the nuclei and ( pseudo)bulges in m101 , ngc 6503 , and ngc 6946 and hence to estimate their masses . </S>",
    "<S> the results imply small mass - to - light ratios consistent with young stellar populations . </S>",
    "<S> these observations lead to two conclusions :    = -4pt = -4pt    \\(1 ) upper limits on the masses of any supermassive black holes ( bhs ) are @xmath4 @xmath5 in m101 and @xmath6 @xmath5 in ngc 6503 .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(2 ) we show that the above galaxies contain only tiny pseudobulges that make up @xmath7% of the stellar mass . </S>",
    "<S> this provides the strongest constraints to date on the lack of classical bulges in the biggest pure - disk galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we inventory the galaxies in a sphere of radius 8 mpc centered on our galaxy to see whether giant , pure - disk galaxies are common or rare . we find that at least 11 of 19 galaxies with @xmath8 km  s@xmath2 , including m101 , ngc 6946 , ic 342 , and our galaxy , show no evidence for a classical bulge . </S>",
    "<S> four may contain small classical bulges that contribute 512% of the light of the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> only four of the 19 giant galaxies are ellipticals or have classical bulges that contribute @xmath9 1/3 of the galaxy light . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that pure - disk galaxies are far  from  rare . </S>",
    "<S> it is hard to understand how bulgeless galaxies could form as the quiescent tail of a distribution of merger histories . </S>",
    "<S> recognition of pseudobulges makes the biggest problem with cold dark matter galaxy formation more acute : how can hierarchical clustering make so many giant , pure - disk galaxies with no evidence for merger - built bulges ? finally , we emphasize that this problem is a strong function of environment : the virgo cluster is not a puzzle , because more than 2/3 of its stellar mass is in merger remnants .    -25pt    = 15000 = 15000 </S>"
