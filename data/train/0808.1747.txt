    "the standard model ( sm ) for the elementary particles interactions has been successfully tested at the level of quantum corrections .",
    "in particular high precision and collider experiments have tested the model and have placed the border line for physics effects at energies of the order of @xmath0 @xcite . on the other hand , new physics effect in the neutrino sector have recently received an important amount of experimental information coming from flavor oscillation @xcite .",
    "this fact is the first evidence of neutrino masses different from zero , and hence , of physics beyond the sm . in this way ,",
    "the neutrino sector and in particular neutrino - nucleon interactions , could be the place where new physics may become manifest again .",
    "although the sm has been successful to describe the world at short distances , as a low energy effective theory of phenomena at higher scales , it leaves several open questions , e.g. : it does not predict the number of families and the fermions masses , has several free parameters , the mass generation mechanism through the higgs boson , where its mass is not predicted , is untested and still leaves open the hierarchy problem . in these conditions , it is believed that we should have some kind of physics beyond the sm , which is called new physics ( np)@xcite . the search of np proceeds mainly through the comparison of data with the sm predictions .",
    "the experimental way to look for np effects in a model independent fashion is to construct observables that can be affected by this new physics and then compare the measurements with the mentioned sm expectation .",
    "certain types of np can already be present at the tev scale and could participate in neutrino - nucleon interactions .",
    "hence , these np effects could possibly become apparent in neutrino telescopes .",
    "in the other hand it is well - known that scale invariance has been a powerful tool in several branches of physics and the possibility of a scale invariant weak interacting sector with the low energy particle spectrum is not ruled out . in particular , h. georgi @xcite has proposed that a scale invariant sector which does not imply conformal invariance @xcite with a non - trivial @xmath1 fixed point and coupled to the @xmath2 fields through the exchange of particles with a high mass scale @xmath3 may appear much above the tev energy scale . below this energy scale , this sector induces unparticle operators @xmath4 with a non - integral scale dimension @xmath5 that in turn have a mass spectrum which looks like a @xmath5 number of massless particles .",
    "the couplings of these unparticles to the sm fields and in particular to standard neutrinos ( i.e. massless and left - handed particles ) and quarks are described by the effective lagrangian @xcite    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the energy scale at which scale invariance emerges , the dimensionless coefficients @xmath8 are of order @xmath9 for neutrinos and quarks and @xmath10 is the generic fermion spinor .",
    "the operators with lowest possible dimension have the most important effect in the low energy effective theory regime . in eq.(1 ) we have only included the vector unparticles operators @xmath11 that couple with left neutrinos and both left and right quarks .",
    "note that the left couplings to the neutrinos and quarks are taken equal .",
    "diagrams contributing to the neutrino - nucleon cross section.,width=384 ]    in the present work we follow the georgi s approach where the feynman propagators of the unparticle operator @xmath12 is determined by the scale invariance @xcite , @xmath13 with @xmath14 the scale dimension @xmath5 is restricted in the range @xmath15 . here , the condition @xmath16 is due to the non - integrable singularities in the decay rate @xcite while @xmath17 is due to the convergence of the integrals @xcite .",
    "in this section we consider the effective operator given in eq.([lageff ] ) and calculate their contribution to the neutrino - nucleon inclusive cross section : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is an isoscalar nucleon .",
    "the corresponding process is pictured in fig .",
    "[ fig : diag ] which has the sm charged and neutral current diagrams and the unparticle contribution . for charged currents",
    "the calculation is standard and we use it to compare our results with @xcite . for neutral currents we have included the contributions of unparticles .",
    "the corresponding coupling and propagator are given in equations ( [ lageff ] ) and ( [ propagador ] ) respectively .    the sm results for the scattering amplitude for charged currents muon - neutrino scattering is @xmath20 and the corresponding differential cross section reads @xmath21 , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where for an isoscalar target we have the quark distribution functions @xmath22    similarly , the sm neutral current amplitude is @xmath23 where @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .    from the effective interaction eq.([lageff ] ) between unparticle and the sm fields we obtain the following four fermion amplitude @xmath30 where the left ( @xmath31 ) and right ( @xmath32 ) coupling constants are expressed in terms of the vector and axial vector coupling constants : @xmath33 where @xmath34    the total neutral current contribution , including the unparticle contribution , can be written as @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 the neutral current differential cross section is then @xmath38 , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where the corresponding parton distributions for a isoscalar target read @xmath39    in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigtot ] we show the behavior of the total cross section ( @xmath40 ) with the neutrino energy for different values of @xmath5 and @xmath41 .",
    "we can appreciate a considerable disagreement with the sm predictions , due to the unparticle propagator , particularly for low values of @xmath5 and low neutrino energy .",
    "this very disparate behavior do not directly translate to the neutrino flux due to strong regeneration effects , as we will see in the next section .",
    "the surviving flux of neutrinos of energy @xmath42 , with inclination @xmath43 with respect to nadir direction , @xmath44 , is the solution of the complete transport equation @xcite : @xmath45 where the first term correspond to absorption effects and the second one to the regeneration . here",
    ", @xmath46 is the number of nucleons per unit area in the neutrino path through the earth ,    @xmath47    in order to find a solution for this equation we make the following approximation @xcite : we replace the fluxes ratio inside the integral of the second member by the ratio of fluxes that solve the homogeneous equation ( i.e. , only considering absorption effects ) @xmath48 where @xmath49 \\ ; \\tau'\\ ] ] thus , integrating the transport equation we have @xmath50 where @xmath51 with @xmath52    @xmath53 is the initial neutrino flux considered as isotropic , @xmath54 is the avogradro number , @xmath55 is the radius of the earth , @xmath43 is the nadir angle taken from the down - going normal to the neutrino telescope and the earth density @xmath56 is given by the preliminary reference earth model @xcite .",
    "it is important to mention that the solution of the transport equation , eq .",
    "( [ transporte ] ) is the first , but quite accurate , approximation of the iterative method showed in ref.@xcite .    in order to illustrate the general behavior of the solution we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : psi ] , for @xmath57 , the factor @xmath58 @xmath59 with @xmath60 in this figure we show @xmath58 for the sm and for the unparticles contribution with @xmath61 and @xmath62 and we have explicitly included both factors ( @xmath63 and @xmath64 ) to see the compensation between absorption and regeneration effects .    for @xmath65",
    "the absorption and the regeneration practically compensate each other and , then , the values of @xmath58 are very near to the sm values ( fig . [",
    "fig : psi ] upper ) .",
    "for @xmath66 the absorption and regeneration effects do not cancel that efficiently and then we have values of @xmath58 that clearly differ from the sm value . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ss ] we show @xmath58 for different values of the unparticle parameters and for two angles between the directions of the neutrino beam and the nadir .",
    "the angle @xmath67 and the related ratio @xmath68 introduced in ref.@xcite are the observable that we shall use in this paper in order to study the impact of the unparticle physics on neutrino detection in a neutrino telescope such as icecube . by definition @xmath67 is the angle that divides the earth into two homo - event sectors .",
    "when neutrinos traverse the planet in their journey to the detector , they find different matter densities , and then , different number of nucleons to interact with . in this conditions ,",
    "the number of neutrinos that finally arrive to the detector depends on the arrival directions , indicated by the angle @xmath43 with respect to the nadir direction . if we consider only upward - going neutrinos of a given energy @xmath42 , that is , the ones with arrival directions @xmath43 such that @xmath69 , there will always exist an angle @xmath67 such that the number of events for @xmath70 equals that for @xmath71 .",
    "clearly , the value of @xmath67 is energy dependent . for low energies , the cross section decreases and the earth becomes transparent to neutrinos .",
    "in this case @xmath72 for a diffuse isotropic flux since this angle divides the hemisphere into two sectors with the same solid angle . obviously for extremely high energies , where most neutrinos are absorbed , @xmath73 , and for intermediate energies @xmath67 varies accordingly between these limiting behaviors .",
    "in order to define @xmath67 we consider the expected number of events ( muon tracks though charged currents @xmath74 interactions ) at icecube in the energy interval @xmath75 and in the angular interval @xmath76 that can be estimated as @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the number of target nucleons in the effective detection volume , @xmath79 is the running time , and @xmath80 is the charged neutrino - nucleon cross section .",
    "we take the detection volume for the events equal to the instrumented volume for icecube , which is roughly 1 km@xmath81 and corresponds to @xmath82 .",
    "the function @xmath44 in eq.([numberevent ] ) is the survival flux which is the solution eq.([transporte ] ) of the complete transport equation @xcite .",
    "the definition of @xmath67 is essentially the equality between two number of events , thus , to a good approximation , for each energy bin all the previous factors cancel except the integrated fluxes at each side . in this way",
    ", @xmath67 can be defined by the equation @xmath83 which is numerically solved to give the results shown in the fig .",
    "[ fig : alfunp ] .",
    "there we show the sm prediction for @xmath67 and the unparticles contribution for different values of the dimension @xmath5 .    the main characteristics of @xmath67 have been reported recently in ref.@xcite .",
    "it is worth to notice that @xmath67 is weakly dependent on the initial flux but , at the same time it is strongly dependent on the neutrino nucleon cross - section .",
    "hence , the use of the observable @xmath67 reduces the effects of the experimental systematics and initial flux dependence .",
    "since the functional form of @xmath67 sharply depends on the interaction cross section neutrino - nucleon , if physics beyond the sm operates at these high energies , it will become manifest directly onto the function @xmath67 .    in order to evaluate the impact of the observable @xmath67 to bound new physics effects , we have estimated the corresponding uncertainties on the sm prediction for @xmath67 . considering the number of events as distributed according to a poisson distribution",
    "the uncertainty can be propagated onto the angle @xmath84 .",
    "the number of events @xmath85 as a function of @xmath86 is @xmath87 where we have considered the effective volume for contained events so that an accurate and simultaneous determination of the muon energy and shower energy is possible . for icecube",
    ", it corresponds to the instrumented volume , roughly 1 km@xmath81 , implying a number of target nucleons @xmath88 .",
    "we have considered an integration time @xmath89 yr which is the expected lifetime of the experiment . to propagate the error on @xmath85 to obtain the one on @xmath90",
    ", we note that @xmath91 and dividing by @xmath85 we obtain @xmath92}\\right ] \\left ( \\dfrac{\\delta n}{n } \\right),\\ ] ] where for poisson distributed events we have @xmath93    in order to evaluate the _ errors _ on @xmath67 , it is necessary to consider a level of initial flux @xmath53 .",
    "here we have added together the cosmological diffuse isotropic flux and the atmospheric one(see fig .",
    "[ fig : flux0 ] ) . for the atmospheric flux",
    ", we have considered the one given in ref.@xcite . as for the cosmological diffuse flux ,",
    "the usual benchmark is the so - called waxman - bahcall ( wb ) flux for each flavor , @xmath94 , which is derived assuming that neutrinos come from transparent cosmic ray sources @xcite , and that there is an adequate transfer of energy to pions following @xmath95 collisions .",
    "however , one should keep in mind that if there are in fact hidden sources which are opaque to ultra - high energy cosmic rays , then the expected neutrino flux will be higher .    on the other hand",
    ", we have the experimental bounds set by amanda .",
    "a summary of these bounds can be found in refs.@xcite and as a representative value we take @xmath96 . with the intention to estimate the number of events , we have considered an intermediate flux ( int ) level slightly below the present experimental bound by amanda , @xmath97    as it was discussed in ref.@xcite",
    "the interval for maximum sensitivity for @xmath90 is @xmath98 .",
    "however , as for lower energies the atmospheric flux grows and then the errors fall , we have considered as an energy window for the fits the interval : @xmath99 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : alferr ] we show our results for the observable @xmath90 and the corresponding errors within the mentioned energy window . in fig .",
    "[ fig : flux0 ] we show the used flux .    in the same context , we can define another observable related to @xmath67 .",
    "we consider the hemisphere @xmath69 divided into two regions by the angle @xmath100 , @xmath101 for @xmath102 and @xmath103 for @xmath104 .",
    "we then calculate the ratio @xmath68 between the number of events for each region , @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the number of events in the region @xmath101 and @xmath107 the number of events in the region @xmath103 . by using @xmath68 the effects of experimental systematic and initial flux dependence",
    "are reduced .",
    "if there is only sm physics , then we have that the ratio @xmath108 . in order to estimate the capability of @xmath68 to bound unparticle effects , we have considered the values of @xmath68 along with their error bars in fig .",
    "[ fig : capa ] as if they had been obtained from experimental measurements for @xmath68 .",
    "we proceed , then , to perform a @xmath109-analysis taking as free parameters the dimension @xmath5 and the constant @xmath110 and considering as _ experimental point _",
    "the sm values for @xmath68 for the same energy bin used in fig .",
    "[ fig : alferr ] .",
    "we define the @xmath109 function in the usual way , @xmath111 where according to the definition of @xmath68 ( eq.([eta ] ) ) the statistical errors are given by @xmath112 for events distributed according to a poisson distribution .",
    "the function @xmath109 is minimized to obtain the allowed region in the ( @xmath5 , @xmath113 ) plane , which corresponds to the region below the curve * a * shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : capareg ] . in the same figure",
    "we also include other bounds obtained from different processes .",
    "the curve * b * corresponds to bounds obtained from atomic parity violation@xcite , the curve * c * corresponds to bounds from the muon anomaly @xcite and curve * e * comes from low energy @xmath114 scattering@xcite .",
    "this last bound is significatively better than all the other bounds .",
    "we would like to stress that the curve * e * corresponds to @xmath114 scattering but we are considering muon neutrinos , i.e. , a different neutrino flavor . thus ,",
    "if we consider the unparticle interactions as non - universal then this constraint would not apply and the neutrino telescope bounds may be competitive . however , there are experimental data for the ratio between @xmath115 neutral current to charged current interaction @xmath116 @xcite :    @xmath117    in order to compare with the experimental value    @xmath118    which is an average measurement for energies in the range 20 gev - 200 gev , we calculated the corresponding average value for @xmath116 :    @xmath119    and compared it with the previous experimental value ( eq.([rexperi ] ) ) for different values of the unparticles parameters ( @xmath120 ) .",
    "the allowed region corresponds to the points below the curve * d * of fig .",
    "[ fig : capareg ] .",

    "in the present work we studied the effects of unparticles contributions to the neutrino - nucleon cross section on the survival neutrino flux in a neutrino telescope like icecube . to do it , we considered an effective interaction between standard particles and unparticles .",
    "we have found a considerable disagreement with the sm prediction for the neutrino observables defined above , particulary for low values of @xmath5 and low neutrino energy . for moderate values of @xmath5",
    "this disagreement tends to disappear due to a strong cancellation between absorption and regeneration .",
    "we have also studied the possibility to bound effects of unparticles contributions to the interactions between muon neutrinos and the nucleons of the earth using the observable @xmath68 . in this context , we fitted the theoretical expression for @xmath68 as a function of the @xmath5 and @xmath113 taking as experimental data the sm values obtained for @xmath121 ( @xmath108 ) along with the errors derived for a number of events distributed according to a poisson distribution .",
