    "the measurement - calculus @xcite is a formal framework for measurement - based quantum computation . in the original model introduced by briegel and raussendorf ,",
    "all measurements are applied in the so called @xmath0-plane of the bloch sphere , however the model can be extended to other planes , namely @xmath1 and @xmath2-planes .",
    "for instance , measurements in the @xmath1-planes are universal @xcite for quantum computation , with the particular property that only real numbers are used in this case .",
    "the extended measurement - calculus @xcite is an extension of the measurement - calculus in which the three possible planes of measurement are available .",
    "the question of the reversibility is central in measurement - based quantum computation since the key ingredient of this model  the quantum measurement  has a fundamentally probabilistic evolution .",
    "reversibility is essential for the simulation of quantum circuits , and as a consequence for the universality of the model . for deciding whether an initial resource ( a graph state ) can be used to implement a reversibile evolutions , a graphical condition called _",
    "gflow _ has been introduced @xcite .",
    "gflow is not unique in general . in the non - extended case",
    "a focused gflow @xcite is nothing but a gflow in some normal form .",
    "we consider three natural extensions of the focused gflow for the extended measurement based quantum computation and we study in which cases these normal forms exist .",
    "in this section , a brief description of the extended measurement - based quantum computation is given , a more detailed introduction can be found in @xcite . an measurement - based quantum computation ( mbqc ) is :    * * initialisation . * an _ open graph _",
    "@xmath3 which describes the initial entanglement ( @xmath4 is a simple undirected graph ) , the inputs ( @xmath5 ) and outputs ( @xmath6 ) of the computation",
    ". the initial entanglement is obtained by applying the following preparation map @xmath7 which associates with every arbitrary input state located on the input qubits the initial entangled state of the mbqc : @xmath8|}{\\left| x , y \\right\\rangle}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 $ ] denotes the subgraph of @xmath10 induced by the supports of @xmath11 and @xmath12 and @xmath13|$ ] its size . in other words @xmath13|$ ] is the number of edges @xmath14 such that @xmath15 ;   + * * measurements .",

    "a vertex @xmath31 is called a _ corrector _ of @xmath22 .",
    "the maps @xmath32 should be _ extensive _ in the sense that there exists a partial order @xmath33 over the vertices of the graph s.t .",
    "any corrector @xmath34 of a vertex @xmath22 is larger than @xmath22 , i.e. @xmath35 implies @xmath36 .",
    "the extensivity of @xmath37 and @xmath38 guarantees that the corrections are applied on qubits which are no yet measured .",
    "the _ extended _ variant of mbqc refers to the possibility to perform measurements in the three possible planes @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 of the bloch sphere , whereas all measurements are performed in the @xmath0-plane in the original measurement - based quantum computation .",
    "despite of the probabilistic evolution of quantum measurements , the correction mechanism can be used to make the overall evolution of an mbqc reversible which means that there exists an isometry @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) from the input to the output qubits such that , whatever the classical outcomes of the measurements during the computation are , the evolution implemented by the mbqc is @xmath39 . in the context of measurement - based quantum computation this form of reversibility",
    "is called _ determinism _ @xcite .",
    "determinism is an essential feature which is used for instance for proving that any quantum circuit can be simulated by an mbqc .",
    "thus , this is a key ingredient for the universality of the model for quantum computing .",
    "the existence of a correction strategy that makes an mbqc deterministic crucially depends on the initial entangled state , i.e. on the open graph @xmath3 and the planes of measurement : given @xmath41 a map which associates with every non output qubit its plane of measurement , an _ extended open graph _",
    "@xmath42 is _ uniformly deterministic _ if for any measurement angles @xmath43 , there exist two corrective maps @xmath37 and @xmath38 such that the corresponding mbqc is deterministic .",
    "significant efforts have been made to characterize the open graphs that guarantees uniform determinism .",
    "flow @xcite , and generalised flow ( _ gflow _ ) @xcite are graphical conditions which are sufficient for uniform determinism .",
    "gflow can be defined as follows for the extended open graphs :    an extended open graph @xmath42 has a gflow if there exists @xmath44 s.t .",
    "@xmath45 is extensive and for any @xmath46 , @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the _ odd neighbourhood _ of @xmath49 and a map @xmath50 is _ extensive _ if there exists a partial order @xmath33 such that for any @xmath16 , @xmath22 is smaller than its image by @xmath51 i.e. , @xmath52 .    concretely , if an extended open graph @xmath3 has a gflow @xmath53 then for any measurement angles @xmath54 the corrective maps defined as @xmath55 and @xmath56 guarantees that the corresponding mbqc is deterministic @xcite .    with some additional assumptions gflow",
    "is not only sufficient but also necessary for determinism in measurement - based quantum computing .",
    "more precisely , there are mainly two cases to consider , depending on the number of inputs and outputs of the computation .",
    "when there are as many inputs as outputs , determinism corresponds to the notion of unitary evolution ( evolution @xmath39 s.t .",
    "@xmath57 ) . in this particular case ,",
    "the gflow condition is necessary for strong  i.e. , all measurements occur with the same probability  uniform determinism @xcite . in the general case ,",
    "when the number of inputs and outputs may differ , determinism corresponds to isometries ( also called _ unitary embedding _ ) . in this general case ,",
    "gflow characterizes _ stepwise _ strong uniform determinism ( roughly speaking the additional stepwise condition means that any partial computation is also deterministic ) @xcite .",
    "notice that it is not known whether the strong and stepwise conditions are required : there is no known example of uniformly deterministic mbqc which corresponding open graph does not have a gflow .    notice that if an extended open graph has a gflow then all the input qubits must be measured in the @xmath0-plane :    [ prop : xy ] if an extended open graph @xmath42 has a gflow then @xmath58 , @xmath59 .",
    "let @xmath53 be a gflow for @xmath42 , and @xmath60 , since for any @xmath16 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , thus according to the definition of gflow , @xmath63 and @xmath64 . @xmath65",
    "the gflow of an ( extended ) open graph is not unique in general . in the non extended case",
    "i.e. , when all measurements are performed in the @xmath0-plane several classes of gflow have been identified : the _ maximally delayed gflow _ which depth is minimal and which is produced by an polytime algorithm @xcite ; and the focus gflow which guarantees that the @xmath38 corrective map acts only on the output qubits .",
    "the definition of focused gflow is as follows : given an open graph @xmath3 , a gflow @xmath53 is _ focused _ if @xmath66 , @xmath67 .",
    "since any gflow can be transformed into a focused gflow @xcite , focused gflow can be used to characterize the open graphs that have a gflow :    an open graph @xmath3 has a gflow if and only if there exists @xmath68 extensive such that @xmath66 , @xmath69    focused gflow is a simpler but equivalent variant of gflow , which can be used for instance as a tool for quantum circuits translation and optimisation @xcite .",
    "so far , there is no definition of ` focused ' gflow in the context of the extended mbqc . by symmetry , there are three natural kinds of ` focused ' extended gflow : those for which @xmath70 ; those for which @xmath71 ; and finally those for which @xmath72 , @xmath73 denotes the _",
    "symmetric difference_. we define the corresponding three normal forms ( nf for short ) for extended gflows :    a gflow @xmath53 of an extended open graph @xmath42 is    * @xmath74-nf if @xmath66 , @xmath75 * @xmath76-nf if @xmath66 , @xmath77 * @xmath78-nf if @xmath66 , @xmath79    intuitively a @xmath80-nf , for @xmath81 , guarantees that in the corresponding mbqc all the correctors applied on the non output qubits are pauli-@xmath80 operators .",

    "are products of @xmath74 and @xmath78 which is nothing but pauli - y operators ( up to a global phase ) .",
