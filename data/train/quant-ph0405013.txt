    "disorder - induced localization has been one of the central problems of condensed matter physics , starting with the anderson paper @xcite .",
    "it has also attracted much attention in other physical contexts , quantum chaos being an example @xcite .",
    "recent interest in quantum computing has further emphasized its importance and allowed looking at it from a somewhat different perspective .    in many proposed physical implementations of a quantum computer ( qc )",
    "the qubit - qubit interaction is not turned off @xcite .",
    "the interaction may lead to excitation hopping from one qubit to another .",
    "however , control and measurement should be presumably performed on individual qubits .",
    "therefore it is essential to prevent excitation transfer between operations .",
    "this makes localization a prerequisite for quantum computing with perpetually coupled qubits .",
    "several approaches to quantum computing with perpetually coupled qubits have been proposed recently @xcite    in a multi - excitation system like a system of interacting electrons or a qc , inter - site ( or inter - qubit ) transitions are a many - body effect , they involve several excitations . in spite of the broad interest in the problem of many - particle localization ,",
    "only a limited number of analytical results has been obtained @xcite .",
    "numerical results are also limited : classical computers do not allow studying a large number of particles , because the hilbert space is exponentially large . on the other hand , qc s with perpetually coupled qubits provide a unique means for investigating localization in a controllable setting .",
    "in this paper we study strong on - site many - particle localization .",
    "it implies that each particle ( or excitation ) is nearly completely confined to one site .",
    "this is a stronger condition than just exponential decay of the wave function , and it is this condition that must be met in a qc .",
    "a well - known argument suggests that it is hard to strongly localize a disordered many - particle system where the on - site energies are random and uniformly distributed within a finite - width band @xcite .",
    "indeed , consider a state where particles occupy @xmath1 sites .",
    "for short - range hopping , it is directly coupled to @xmath2 other @xmath1-particle states . with probability @xmath2 one of them",
    "will be in resonance with the initial state . for large @xmath1",
    "this leads to state hybridization over time @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the inter - site hopping integral ( we set @xmath5 ) .    in a qc",
    ", the quantity @xmath4 is determined by the qubit - qubit interaction and usually characterizes the rate of two - qubit operations . at the same time , the qubit energies are not random and often can be individually controlled .",
    "it is this control that makes qc s advantageous for studying many - particle localization , as it becomes possible to construct a `` disordered '' energy sequence site by site .",
    "localization can be considered from two points of view .",
    "one is based on the analysis of _ stationary _ states of a many - particle system .",
    "the other is based on studying the system dynamics .",
    "consider a state with particles occupying a given set of sites , which is called an on - site state ( or a quantum register ) . as a result of hopping it",
    "can hybridize with another on - site state with nearly the same energy .",
    "we will study the time it takes for resonant hybridization to happen , which we call the localization lifetime @xmath6 .    in a qc",
    "all states have a finite coherence time due to coupling to the environment and external noise . for successful qc operation ,",
    "delocalization should not occur during this time . for most of the proposed models of a qc ,",
    "the coherence time is @xmath7 .",
    "therefore it is sufficient to have the localization lifetime @xmath8 .",
    "such lifetime - based formulation of the many - particle localization problem is relevant to condensed - matter systems as well , because of finite decay and decoherence times of quasiparticles for nonzero temperatures .",
    "here we construct a bounded sequence of on - site energies in a 1d chain and show that it leads to a long localization lifetime .",
    "we provide evidence that it also leads to strong localization of many - particle stationary states in sections of the chain with length up to 12 sites . in a sense , this is an explicit construction of an efficiently localizing on - site disorder .    in a qc , on - site",
    "excitation energies are interlevel distances of the qubits .",
    "they can often be individually controlled , which makes it possible to construct an arbitrary energy sequence .",
    "however , since the qubit tuning range is limited , so should be the energy bandwidth .",
    "a smaller bandwidth leads also to a higher speed of quantum gate operations , particularly if they involve changing qubit energies @xcite .",
    "of course , condensed - matter systems always have bounded bandwidth as well .    in condensed - matter physics , localization by `` controlled '' disorder has been studied in depth and many interesting results have been obtained in the context of incommensurate periodic potentials , see refs .   and papers cited therein . in contrast to this work , we are interested in strong on - site localization , and not only for single- , but in the first place , for many - particle states .",
    "the `` potential '' that we propose is not quasi - periodic , and our analytical techniques , including the time - dependent formulation for many - body systems , are different from the methods developed for quasi - periodic potentials .    to strongly localize one particle",
    ", the difference between excitation energies on neighboring sites should be much larger than the hopping integral @xmath4 .",
    "however , even for nearest neighbor coupling , the energies of remote sites should also differ to prevent transitions between them via intermediate ( nonresonant ) sites .",
    "the further away the sites are , the smaller their energy difference can be .",
    "this idea is implemented in our energy sequence . as a consequence",
    ", the single - particle transition amplitude displays nearly exponential decay with distance .",
    "we show that the decay exponent weakly depends on site and find rigorous bounds on its value",
    ".    for many - particle localization one has to suppress not only single - particle , but also combined resonances , which involve simultaneous transitions of several interacting excitations .",
    "there is no known way to eliminate all such resonances in an infinite system .",
    "however , with the increasing `` order '' of the transition , i.e. , the number of involved excitations and/or intermediate virtual states , the effective hopping integral may quickly fall off , leading to an increase of the transition time . then to obtain a desired lifetime of a localized state it is sufficient to eliminate resonances up to a certain order .",
    "we explicitly show how to do it up to fifth order , for our sequence .",
    "in a real system it will be possible to tune the energies only with certain precision .",
    "we study how errors in the energies affect localization and show that our sequence is stable with respect to small errors . we also demonstrate that , in terms of strong on - site localization , even for a small chain the constructed energy sequence is much better than fully random on - site energies with the same overall bandwidth .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we discuss the hamiltonian of coupled qubits and introduce a physically motivated one - parameter sequence of on - site energies . in sec .",
    "iii one - particle localization of stationary states is studied and quasi - exponential decay of the transition amplitude is demonstrated . a rigorous proof of such decay is provided in appendix a. the relevant scaling properties are analyzed in appendix b. in sec .",
    "iv the inverse participation ratio is calculated for many - particle states in a section of a 1d chain .",
    "this ratio can be made very close to one in a broad range of the parameter of the on - site energy sequence , but it also displays sharp resonant peaks as a function of this parameter .",
    "these peaks are discussed in appendix c. the lifetime of localized states is considered in sec .",
    "v. a minor modification of the energy sequence allows one to open a gap in the spectrum of combined many - excitation transitions up to 5th order , which is sufficient for extremely long localization lifetime .",
    "the role of errors in the on - site energies is studied , and robustness of the results with respect to these errors is demonstrated in sec .  vi . in sec .",
    "vii a highly symmetric period - doubling sequence of on - site energies is analyzed along with a sequence of uncorrelated on - site energies . both are by far inferior , in terms of localization , to the sequence discussed in secs .",
    "viii contains concluding remarks .",
    "the problem of localization can be formulated in a similar way for one - dimensional systems of interacting fermions and spins .",
    "the formulation also applies to qubits during the time when no gate operations and measurements are performed , i.e. , there are no time - dependent fields that would modulate the qubits .",
    "the relation between spin and qubit systems is simple : qubits are two - level systems , and therefore can be described by @xmath9 spins in a magnetic field .",
    "then the excitation energy of a qubit becomes the zeeman energy of a spin , whereas the qubit - qubit interaction becomes the exchange spin coupling .",
    "note that the physical interaction itself may be of a totally different nature , e.g. , electric dipolar or quadrupolar .    for many proposed realizations of qc s the qubit excitation energies",
    "are large compared to the interaction",
    ". then the qubit - qubit interaction is described by the spin - coupling hamiltonian of the form @xmath10.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath11 enumerate sites in the 1d spin chain , @xmath12 is the direction of the effective magnetic field , and @xmath13 are the interaction parameters ( @xmath14 ) . in mapping the qubit interaction on the exchange coupling we kept only those terms",
    "which , in the heisenberg representation , do not oscillate at qubit transition frequencies .",
    "this is why we have set @xmath15 . in the case of qubits ,",
    "the terms @xmath16 lead to excitation transfer between the qubits @xmath11 provided their energies are close .",
    "we note that the spin interaction of the form ( [ spin_int ] ) conserves the number of excitations in the system .",
    "it is convenient to map the spin system onto a system of spinless fermions via the jordan - wigner transformation @xcite . for nearest neighbor coupling ,",
    "the hamiltonian of the fermion system becomes @xmath17 here , @xmath18 are the fermion creation and annihilation operators ; the presence of a fermion on site @xmath19 corresponds to the @xmath19th spin being excited .",
    "the parameter @xmath20 is the fermion hopping integral .",
    "the parameter @xmath21 gives the interaction energy of fermions on neighboring sites .",
    "if the coupling of the underlying spins is isotropic , we have @xmath22 .",
    "the on - site fermion energies @xmath23 are the zeeman energies of the spins ( excitation energies of the qubits ) counted off from the characteristic central energy which is the same for all spins inside the chain .",
    "for concreteness we set @xmath24 .",
    "localization , and in particular weak localization , is often described in terms of the decay of the wave functions of stationary states at large distances .",
    "in contrast , here we are interested in strong on - site localization .",
    "it is determined by the short - range behavior of stationary states and corresponds to confinement of each particle to one or maybe a few neighboring sites .",
    "strong localization can be conveniently characterized by the inverse participation ratio ( ipr ) , which shows over how many sites the wave function spreads .",
    "for an @xmath1-particle wave function @xmath25 ( @xmath26 enumerates the stationary states ) the ipr is given by the expression @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the vacuum state . in what follows",
    "we will sometimes use the notation @xmath29 for the on - site wave function ( quantum register ) in which sites @xmath30 are occupied and other sites are empty . the quantity ( [ ipr ] )",
    "is also sometimes called the number of participating components , it shows how many matrix elements @xmath31 are substantial , i.e. , of order of their maximal value with respect to @xmath30 .    for fully localized states @xmath32 .",
    "strong on - site localization means that @xmath33 is close to @xmath34 for all states @xmath26 . in this case",
    "both the average ipr @xmath35 and @xmath36 are close to one . here",
    ", @xmath37 is the total number of @xmath1-particle states ; for an @xmath38-site chain @xmath39 .",
    "smallness of @xmath40 is a weaker condition , it is an indication of strong localization of most of the states .    in the opposite limit of extended states we have @xmath41 .",
    "a simple example is the case of one particle in an open chain ( a chain with free boundaries ) with @xmath42const .",
    "the wave functions of the particle are sinusoidal , and for an @xmath38-site chain @xmath43 . the mean ipr sharply increases with the number of particles @xmath1 , for @xmath44 .",
    "localization requires that the on - site energies @xmath23 be tuned away from each other . the strategy for choosing the sequence of @xmath23 while keeping the overall bandwidth of",
    "the energy spectrum finite can be as follows .",
    "first , we separate the energies of nearest neighbors by splitting @xmath23 into two subbands , with even and odd @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "the distance @xmath45 between the subbands should significantly exceed the hopping integral @xmath4 . then each subband is further split into two subbands in order to detune next nearest neighbors .",
    "the splitting between these subbands can be less than @xmath45 .",
    "this is because next - nearest - neighbor hopping occurs via virtual transitions to a nonresonant nearest - neighbor site , and therefore the effective hopping integral is @xmath46 .",
    "the procedure of band splitting should be continued , and higher - order splitting can be smaller and smaller .",
    "we now introduce a simple sequence of @xmath23 that implements the structure described above . except for the energy scaling factor @xmath45 , this sequence",
    "is characterized by one dimensionless parameter @xmath47 .",
    "as we show , it can already be efficient in terms of strong localization . for a semi - infinite chain with @xmath48 we set @xmath49,\\ ] ]",
    "( @xmath50 is the integer part ) .    sequence ( [ sequence ] ) does not have any simple symmetry .",
    "for example , it is not self - similar : the subband widths do not scale with the distance between the sites that belong to the same subband ( cf .",
    "vii ) . nor is sequence ( [ sequence ] ) quasi - periodic . however , the coefficients at any given power @xmath51 are repeated with period @xmath52 .",
    "this important property is essential for obtaining analytical results , see appendix a.    the energy spectrum ( [ sequence ] ) is illustrated in fig .",

    "the multisubband structure of the spectrum is clearly seen in the right panel .",
    "for small @xmath47 , the two major subbands have width @xmath53 and are separated by @xmath54 .",
    "the splitting of higher - order subbands is proportional to higher powers of @xmath47 .",

    "in a 1d system with random on - site energies all single - particle stationary states are localized , even for weak disorder , and exponentially decay at large distances .",

    "( [ correction_6 ] ) ] , the inverse participation ratio differs from its value for the case of fully localized states by @xmath412 .",
    "this deviation is due to a small nonresonant admixture of the wave functions of neighboring sites .",
    "a different approach is based on studying the lifetime of on - site states .",
    "it is sufficient to have a localization lifetime @xmath6 that exceeds the coherence time of the excitations .",
    "we have shown that such @xmath6 can be achieved in a chain of an arbitrary length and with an arbitrary number of excitations .",
    "for the explicit construction of on - site energies ( [ correction_6 ] ) , resonant transitions that lead to delocalization require at least 4 virtual nonresonant steps , and for comparatively weak particle - particle coupling even 6 virtual transitions .",
    "even in the 4-step case this leads to the ratio of the delocalization rate to the inter - site hopping integral @xmath413 already for the decay length of the amplitude of virtual transitions @xmath414 , or for @xmath415 .",
    "the results on localization can be tested with artificial condensed - matter structures , as it was done in the studies of the effects of quasiperiodicity @xcite ( see also refs .  ) .",
    "a discussion of experimental implementations is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "good examples are proposed models of a quantum computer ; we note , however , that studying localization does not require operations on qubits , and therefore does not require a fully operational quantum computer .    in terms of quantum computing , an advantageous feature of sequence ( [ sequence ] ) and its modification ( [ correction_6 ] )",
    "is that one radiation frequency can be used to resonantly excite different qubits .",
    "this can be achieved by selectively tuning them to this frequency without bringing neighboring qubits in resonance with each other , or by sweeping the frequency of the targeted qubit through the radiation frequency and having a landau - zener - type interstate transition .",
    "a two - qubit gate can be conveniently done by selectively tuning neighboring qubits in resonance with each other and having a landau - zener type excitation swap @xcite .    in many cases localization",
    "is also a prerequisite for a projective measurement .",
    "this happens when the measured quantity is the probability for each qubit to be in the excited state .",
    "often a measurement is much slower than the time @xmath385 of resonant hopping to a nearest site ; then @xmath6 should exceed the measurement time . in our approach",
    ", localization does not require refocusing @xcite , which is not always easy to implement and which is sometimes incompatible with slow measurement .",
    "our energy sequence does not lead to delocalization of stationary states due to indirect resonant @xmath416 transitions .",
    "such transitions undermine the approach to quantum computing with `` always - on qubit interaction '' proposed in ref .  , where next nearest neighbors are tuned in resonance . in terms of the localization lifetime , the width of the energy distribution ( [ correction_6 ] ) is orders of magnitude smaller than the width that would give the same @xmath6 in the approach @xcite .",
    "there the localization lifetime would be @xmath417 , where @xmath45 is the energy difference between nearest neighbors .",
    "this difference must exceed @xmath4 by a factor @xmath418 in order to have the same localization lifetime as in our approach .",
    "compared to ref .",
    "@xcite , a potential advantage of our approach is that the interaction does not have to be ever turned off , and no multi - qubit encoding is necessary for operating a qc .    the presented scheme can be extended to systems with long - range coupling .",

    "the interqubit coupling is dipolar for a few near neighbors and becomes quadrupolar or falls down even faster for remote neighbors @xcite .",
    "long - range interaction makes transitions over several sites more probable .",
    "we leave detailed analysis for a separate paper . here",
    "we note that , for sequence ( [ correction_3 ] ) and for single - particle transitions , not only hopping over 2 or 4 sites is not resonant and does not lead to delocalization , but even hopping over 6 , 8 , or 10 sites is nonresonant as well .",
    "for all these transitions , the energy difference is at least @xmath419 or @xmath420 [ for sites separated by an odd number of positions , the energy difference is always large , @xmath67 ] .",
    "our results provide proof of principle of strong on - site localization of all states , independent of the system size and the number of particles .",
    "we have not addressed the question of optimization of the energy sequence , so that maximal localization lifetime could be obtained for a minimal bandwidth of on - site energies . for a finite - length chain",
    "the optimization problem can be approached using eq .",

    "we have proposed a sequence of on - site energies ( [ sequence ] ) and its modifications ( [ correction_6 ] ) , ( [ correction_3 ] ) that result in on - site localization of all single- and many - particle states of interacting spins or fermions in an infinite chain . the sequence ( [ sequence ] )",
    "has low symmetry , which allows eliminating resonances between the states to a high order in the hopping integral . in turn",

    "as we increase @xmath47 starting from @xmath435 , pronounced peaks of @xmath203 appear for the difference in the combination two - particle on - site energies @xmath602 ) equal to @xmath603 with @xmath604 .",
    "they are due to resonant hybridization of pairs on neighboring sites @xmath171 with dissociated pairs located on sites @xmath605 for @xmath606 , and @xmath217 with even @xmath19 for @xmath607 , for example .",
    "such hybridization corresponds to two single - particle steps by one site , i.e. @xmath608 .    a specific example for the studied chain with @xmath609 , @xmath103 , and @xmath610 is the resonance between the on - site states @xmath611 , @xmath612 , @xmath613 and @xmath614 ( we remind that the arguments of @xmath615 indicate the positions of the excitations ; we have six excitations , and the available sites are @xmath616 ) .",
    "all these states can be obtained from each other by moving one excitation by two positions .",
    "for example , in the first pair the excitation goes from site 3 , where it has one nearest neighbors , to site 5 , where it has two neighbors .",

    "require more intermediate virtual steps , with @xmath637 .",
    "the @xmath638-resonances are extremely narrow for @xmath639 .",

    "each high - order resonance gives rise to a narrow band of resonant @xmath47 values .",

    "both resonances occur for @xmath654 , but the first corresponds to @xmath655 , whereas the second corresponds to @xmath656 .",

    "as mentioned above , in the region @xmath658 the positions of the ipr peaks are determined not only by the leading - order terms in @xmath47 , but also by higher - order terms .",
