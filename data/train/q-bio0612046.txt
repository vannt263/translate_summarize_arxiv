    "these notes summarize a lecture at a special session of the american mathematical society on mathematical biology , during which we discussed the central problem of comparative genomics , namely how to reconstruct the ancestral genomes that evolved into the present - day extant genomes .",
    "this is fundamentally a statistics problem , because with a few exceptions , it is not possible to sequence the genomes of ancestral species , and one can only infer ancestral genomes from the multitude of genomes that can be sampled at the present time . the problem is a grand scientific challenge that has only begun to be tackled in recent years , now that whole genomes are being sequenced for the first time . our aim is to introduce the reader to the statistical ( and related mathematical ) elements of the methods of comparative genomics , while providing a glimpse of the exciting results that are emerging from first generation attempts to reconstruct ancestral genomes . due to the complex interdisciplinary scope of the subject",
    ", we have been forced to omit a lot of detail and many interesting topics , but we hope that the curious mathematical reader may find some threads worthy of further exploration .",

    "there are very few differences between the genes .",
    "the salmonella sequence has three extra bases at the end , and the e - coli gene one extra in the beginning , there are 37 differences within the genes , and no insertions or deletions .",
    "such a comparison is easy to perform in the example above , but if there are many sequences and lots of insertions and deletions , it can be non - trivial to identify the relationships among individual bases . this _",
    "multiple sequence alignment problem _ is a major problem in comparative genomics , and is discussed in section 3 .",
    "in fact , one of our main points is that finding a good multiple alignment is the essence of the ancestral reconstruction problem .",
    "the degree of conservation of the 16s rrna gene throughout the tree of life means it is a good starting point for reconstructing ancestral genomes .",
    "in particular , we can begin modestly by asking only for the ancestral 16s rrna gene sequences .",
    "such a reconstruction entails the following :    1 .   identifying the 16s gene in many organisms , and determining the sequences . 2 .",
    "obtaining a likely phylogenetic tree that relates the sequences .",
    "3 .   inferring ancestral sequences corresponding to internal nodes in the tree .",
    "this comparative genomics programme was outlined by woese et al .",
    "it followed on the heels of the first comparative genomics papers , written by linus pauling and emile zuckerkandl @xcite .",
    "they applied fingerprinting techniques to compare amino acid sequences of hemoglobins , finding that distant species have more divergent sequences than related species .",
    "the biological problem of identifying the 16s gene and rapidly finding its sequence was solved in @xcite .",
    "more recently , new approaches have been suggested for obtaining 16s rrna sequences , even from unculturable bacteria , using `` community sequencing '' approaches @xcite .    the narrow focus of comparative genomics on 16s rrna ended with the arrival of fast and cheap sequencing technologies",
    "a recent flood of ideas and research inspired by vast amounts of genome sequences has led to the reconstruction of numerous protein sequences and even megabases of boreoeutheriean ancestral chromosomes .",
    "interesting examples of the former are @xcite and of the latter @xcite .",
    "there have been a number of recent surveys on ancestral reconstruction @xcite , and a book on the topic will appear next year @xcite .",
    "we begin in section 2 by discussing the `` easy '' case of ancestral sequence reconstruction , where the phylogenetic tree is known and the alignment of the sequences is trivial . even in this simplest case , the choice of an effective statistical model for evolution is non - trivial and extremely important .",
    "we introduce the reader to these issues by way of the simplest example possible , and provide pointers for further reading . in section 3 we discuss complexities that arise when inferences need to be made about insertions and deletions , and when the alignment of the sequences is non - trivial .",
    "the difficulty of alignment is explored in more detail in section 4 , where we present evidence , based on our own recent work , that suggests the amount of insertion and deletion in genomes has been vastly underestimated .",
    "this has major implications for ancestral genome reconstruction . in section 5",
    "we discuss the problem of tree reconstruction , which needs to be solved in the case where the phylogenetic history of the genomes being compared is unknown .",
    "this leads us to the field of phylogenetics @xcite , where we restrict ourselves to mentioning a number of recent theoretical advances pertinent to ancestral genome reconstruction .",
    "we conclude in section 6 with a list of open problems and a discussion of the role of mathematics , statistics , and computer science in reconstructing ancestral genomes .",
    "in the introduction , we mentioned the example of 16s rrna sequences , and observed that these genes are conserved in all organisms . however , within restricted domains of the tree of life , there are examples of functional elements exhibiting even more sequence conservation than rrna genes .",
    "the term _ ultra - conserved elements _ was introduced in @xcite , and is used to described genome sequences that have remained unchanged over millions of years .",
    "such sequences were first discovered in vertebrates , and their degree of conservation is astounding .",
    "[ ex : mol ] consider the sequence @xmath0 it is located in the human genome on chromosome 7 , coordinates 156,694,482156,694,523 ( version march 2006 ) .",

    "each column contains bases from different species that are _ homologous _ ,",
    "i.e. , that are derived from a shared common ancestral base .",
    "the sequence in ( [ mol ] ) is called ultra - conserved , because there appear to have been no insertions , deletions or mutations since the common ancestor ( * characters indicate columns with all characters identical ) among each group of homologous nucleotides .",
    "in fact , in @xcite we prove    [ thm : mol ] the probability that the sequence ( [ mol ] ) was not present in the genome of the ancestor of all vertebrates is less than @xmath1 , assuming a jukes - cantor model of evolution for the sequences .",
    "the jukes - cantor model is a statistical model for the evolution of characters on trees , which is explained below .",
    "while the model has many drawbacks and does not describe the full extent and structure of mutation , the tiny probability is robust to changes in the model , and it is fairly certain that ( [ mol ] ) is the ancestral sequence .    the starting point for specifying an evolutionary model for biological sequences is the data : a collection of @xmath2 sequences @xmath3 of lengths @xmath4 , each with characters from a finite alphabet @xmath5 .",
    "we use the notation @xmath6 to denote the @xmath7 element of a sequence and by a set of characters @xmath8 we mean the set of @xmath9 sequence characters that form the sequences @xmath10 .",
    "these sequences may be dna sequences ( in which case the alphabet has size @xmath11 ) , amino acid sequences ( in which case the alphabet has size @xmath12 ) , or they may be sequences derived from organisms .",
    "for example , the alphabet may have size @xmath13 , and the sequences may represent the presence or lack of genes , or morphological features in different species .",
    "the elements of the sequences are called _ characters _ , and it is important to note that in problems of interest , @xmath2 is small but @xmath14 is usually fairly large ( in the case of dna sequences , @xmath14 may be in the billions ) .",
    "we restrict our discussion here to the evolutionary model called the _ cavender  farris model _ @xcite .",
    "this is the simplest of a class of continuous time markov models for trees that are used in biological sequence analysis , and although it is very simple , it captures many of the elements of the evolutionary models that are used in practice . the cavender  farris model is an evolutionary model for _ binary _ sequences ( i.e. , the alphabet has size @xmath13 ) , and for sequences of the same length ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the first ingredient of the cavender - farris model is a directed rooted tree on @xmath2 leaves .",
    "the root of the tree has biological significance : it is the common ancestor of all the sequences .",
    "the leaves of the tree also have special significance : they correspond to the @xmath2 different sequences whose evolution is being modeled .",
    "the internal vertices of the tree correspond to speciation events .",
    "edges of the tree are directed from the root to the leaves , and the directions of the arrows specify the direction of time .",
    "the second ingredient of the cavender - farris model is a collection of @xmath16 matrices associated with each edge of the tree .",
    "these matrices are all of the form @xmath17 where @xmath18 is an edge of the tree , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 .",
    "these matrices have a biological interpretation : they describe the probabilities of characters changing along branches of the tree .",
    "although in principle these probabilities may be different for each edge _ and _ for each character within each sequence , the cavender ",
    "farris model specifies a single probability of change @xmath21 for each edge @xmath18 .",
    "if the vertices adjacent to the edge @xmath18 are @xmath22 and @xmath23 with @xmath18 oriented from @xmath22 to @xmath23 , then for the @xmath24th character of the sequence at @xmath22 , @xmath21 is the probability that the @xmath24th character of the sequence at @xmath23 is different .",
    "the cavender - farris model is an example of a _ continuous time markov chain model on a tree_. to see the connection to markov models , consider the @xmath16 square matrix @xmath25 the rows and columns of @xmath26 are indexed by @xmath27 .",
    "note that the matrix @xmath26 has the following properties : @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30 any square matrix @xmath26 ( of arbitrary size ) with the above properties is called a _",
    "rate matrix_. the following is a straightforward result about continuous time markov chains @xcite .",
    "let @xmath26 be any rate matrix and @xmath31",
    ". then    1 .",
    "@xmath32 ( chapman  kolmogorov equations ) , 2 .",
    "@xmath33 is the unique solution to the forward differential equation @xmath34 for @xmath35 ( here @xmath36 is the identity matrix ) , 3 .",
    "@xmath37 is the unique solution to the backward differential equation @xmath38 for @xmath35 , 4 .",
    "@xmath39 .",
    "furthermore , a matrix @xmath26 is a rate matrix if and only if the matrix @xmath40 is a stochastic matrix ( non - negative with row sums equal to one ) for every @xmath41 .",
    "note that for the binary rate matrix ( [ qmatform ] ) , we have @xmath42 the expected number of mutations over time @xmath43 is the quantity @xmath44 this number is called the _ branch length_. it can be computed from the substitution matrix @xmath45 and is the expected number of mutations . for this reason it is used instead of @xmath43 to label edges in a phylogenetic tree .",
    "the matrices @xmath46 in the cavender - farris model are parameterized by @xmath47 and @xmath43 : @xmath48    one way to specify an evolutionary model is to give a phylogenetic tree @xmath49 together with @xmath26 and an initial distribution for the root of @xmath49 ( which we here assume to be the uniform distribution on @xmath5 ) .",
    "the branch lengths of the edges are unknown parameters , and the objective is to estimate these branch lengths from data .",
    "thus , if the tree @xmath49 has @xmath50 edges , then such a model has @xmath50 free parameters .    returning to theorem [ thm : mol ] , we note that the jukes - cantor model is just the cavender - farris model with @xmath51 .",
    "that is , the @xmath26 matrix is given by @xmath52 in this case the branch length is given by @xmath53 ( this should be compared with ( 2.4 ) ) .",
    "the cavender - farris / jukes - cantor models are too simple to be used in practice .",
    "point mutations in genome display various asymmetries , and the general reversible markov model is preferred .",
    "the model in ( 2.7,2.8 ) is realistic , and was estimated from observed synonymous substitutions ( those that do not change the amino acid ) in human - mouse - rat alignments @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the equilibrium frequencies , and are also parameters in the model .",
    "@xmath56 the models used can be even more general , including local dependencies between sites and different functional categories for the ancestral sequences that alter mutation rates .",
    "there is an extensive literature on this topic , as well as many papers discussing the reliability of reconstructed characters in aligned sequences ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the final aspect of theorem [ thm : mol ] that we have not yet discussed is a computational one , namely how to compute the probability given the sequences , the tree and the model .",
    "the algorithm is known as felsenstein s algorithm @xcite and involves dynamic programming on a tree . in the context of ancestral reconstruction ,",
    "@xcite show how to modify felsenstein s algorithm for fast joint reconstruction of all ancestral sequences .",
    "it is best to view all these algorithms as a special case of the junction tree algorithm for a graphical model where the graph is a tree .",
    "we conclude by noting that there is a direct connection between evolutionary models such as the cavender - farris model and the emerging field of _ algebraic statistics_. this is because the families of probability distributions on the leaves are essentially parameterized algebraic varieties , and for this reason the tools of commutative algebra and algebraic geometry can be used to study the model and develop inference methods .",
    "we refer the interested reader to the recent book @xcite for an introduction to the subject .",
    "the models for ancestral reconstruction in section 2 do not account for insertions and deletions ( indels ) .",
    "this is a serious drawback because the homology between muliple sequences is complicated by insertions , deletions , rearrangements , segmental duplications , and other evolutionary events .",
    "we restrict our discussion in this section to the issues regarding ancestral reconstruction in the presence of insertions and deletions only .",

    "the elements of @xmath61 correspond to columns of the multiple alignment , and the partial order specifies the order in which columns must appear .",
    "note that the function @xmath62 specifies the homology relationships among the sequences : two characters that are mapped to the same element in the poset are homologous .",
    "thus , an alignment is just a pair @xmath63 .",
    "we call @xmath61 an _ alignment poset _ , and note that unless @xmath61 is a total order ( chain ) , there are columns of the partial multiple alignment whose order is unspecified .    , and @xmath64 corresponds to the fourth column of the multiple alignment . ]",

    "the alignment in example [ ex : mol ] is a global multiple alignment where the poset is a chain .",
    "the problem of finding a multiple alignment for a collection of sequences is to find a `` good '' poset and function @xmath62 that are likely to determine the homology correctly .",
    "this is a non - trivial problem , and its solution is essential for accurate ancestral reconstruction of sequences .",
    "a complete discussion of multiple alignment is beyond the scope of this section , but we briefly review pairwise sequence alignment .    in the case of two sequences , an alignment poset is always a disjoint union of chains . note that for two sequences of length @xmath14 and @xmath68 , there are @xmath69 alignments .",
    "we consider a simple criterion for selecting an alignment .",
    "given three parameters @xmath70 and @xmath71 , we assign a score to an alignment as follows : @xmath72 where @xmath73 ( the number of spaces in the alignment ) , @xmath74 ( the number of matches ) , and @xmath75 ( the number of mismatches ) .",
    "the problem of maximizing ( [ eq : alignment ] ) can be solved efficiently using dynamic programming , using what is known as the _ needleman - wunsch algorithm _ @xcite .",
    "as with felsenstein s algorithm , this is just a special case of the junction tree algorithm , in this case for a graphical model known as the _ pair hidden markov model_. despite the name , pair hidden markov models are non - trivial modifications of standard hidden markov models models , in that the structure of the models is not fixed . in the graphical model literature , these types of models are referred to as bayesian multinets .",

    "see @xcite or @xcite .",
    "an alignment specifies the homology relationships among nucleotides or amino acids , but provides no information about ancestral sequences . in order to make inferences about ancestral sequences , it is necessary to use the alignment to estimate the locations , sizes , and times of insertions and deletions .",
    "figure 2 shows an alignment of 17 species from the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulatory region ( cftr ) produced for the encode consortium @xcite .",
    "the phylogenetic tree on the left can be used in conjunction with the alignment to identify indel events .",
    "the boxes shown in the figure show the most parsimonious explanation ( minimum number of events ) , based on the tree @xcite .",
    "given a phylogenetic tree @xmath49 , together with a pair hidden markov model associated to each edge of @xmath49 , the _ tree alignment problem _ is to find sequences @xmath76 where @xmath18 ranges over all the internal nodes of @xmath49 such that @xmath77 is maximized .",
    "the inference performed in example 3.2 @xcite is based on a restricted version of tree alignment . in general , there is a ratio - two approximation algorithm for the problem that runs in quadratic time , together with a polynomial time approximation scheme @xcite .",
    "studies of the reliability of ancestral reconstruction have mostly focused on point mutations and the effects of using different types of evolutionary models @xcite .",
    "such studies implicitly assume that multiple alignment , while difficult , is a tractable problem and that indels can be effectively ignored , or else accounted for using procedures such as tree alignment . in this section",
    "we provide indirect evidence that even over relatively short time - scales , large number of insertions and deletions make it impossible to align sequences ( as there is little or no homology ) , and therefore it is impossible to reconstruct ancestral sequences .",
    "our arguments are based on estimating the overall numbers of indels from length differences of homologous segments .",
    "we illustrate our ideas with a calculation based on the comparison of introns in four species of the drosophila ( fruit fly ) : melanogaster , pseudoobscura , yakuba and virils .",
    "introns are sequences within genes that are spliced out after transcription but before translation , so that they do not contribute to the amino acids in the protein . although it has been shown that introns can be important for regulating the expression of genes , they consist of mostly non - functional sequence . the reason to examine drosophila is that multiple genomes have been sequenced during the past year .",
    "the reason to look at introns is that it is easy to identify homologous introns when the genes they reside in are unambiguously homologous .",
    "our methods provide an overall assessment of the number of inserted and deleted nucleotides along each branch of the tree relating the species .",
    "the inference is based on a maximum likelihood model for brownian motion on a tree , originally developed by felsenstein @xcite for modeling changes in gene frequencies over time .",
    "our application of this model to estimating indel rates from length differences of introns is new , and is the first such analysis with more than a pair of species .",
    "previous work on the comparison of lengths of pairs of homologous introns @xcite has mainly revealed that there is a correlation between the length differences and the distance between species .",

    "[ lem : dist ] the log - likelihood ( [ eq : loglik ] ) does not depend on the choice of @xmath88 . furthermore , ( [ eq : loglik ] ) is linear in the @xmath95 numbers @xmath96 .    in other words ,",
    "if we let @xmath97 , then the maximum likelihood estimator @xmath98 is well - defined and it therefore makes sense to refer to the `` log - likelihood function for the contrast brownian motion model on a tree '' .",
    "the likelihood equation becomes @xmath99 the critical equations are easy to solve and one finds that @xmath100    note that in the case @xmath101 , if @xmath102 is a tree metric then @xmath103 .",
    "this is true for general @xmath14 , and is a restatement of the fact that the maximum likelihood estimator is consistent .",
    "there are five critical equations in the @xmath104 case : @xmath105 the solution of these equations is an exercise in elimination , and can be done using grbner bases methods @xcite . using the pulley principle we can restrict ourselves to @xmath106 and @xmath107 , in which case we find one unique critical point : the global maximum .",
    "the solution consists of 5 enormous rational functions in the @xmath108 which we omit here due to lack of space .",
    "the data analyzed was obtained from @xcite .",
    "we restricted our attention to introns in the range of @xmath109bp , and cleaned up the dataset by removing duplicates or cases with ambiguous homology .",
    "we then computed , for each pair of species , the `` distance '' @xmath110 where @xmath83 is the difference in length between the @xmath111th pair of introns in species @xmath18 and @xmath24 .",
    "this is just the quantity that appears in lemma [ lem : dist ] .",
    "it is important to note that the use of the brownian motion model on the @xmath108 constitutes an approximation to a poisson process model for indels .",
    "we omit the details of this relationship and again refer to @xcite .",
    "returning to the data , we show a histogram of the differences between the intron lengths for a pair of species in figure 4 .",
    "these are the raw data we use to compute the @xmath108 distances , and then the maximum likelihood estimates for the branch lengths , which are the total number of indels .",
    "the maximum likelihood estimates are @xmath112 where vertices @xmath113 are the internal vertices in the four taxa tree ( as in figure 3 ) . in other words",
    ", we estimate that the total number of inserted and deleted bases between d. melanogaster and d. yakuba is 5725 , and between d. melanogaster and d. pseudoobscura we obtain @xmath114 .",
    "these numbers are much larger than the mean length of the introns we considered ( note that the longest introns had length @xmath115 ) .",
    "the conclusion is that the _ total _ number of inserted and deleted bases is far larger than the size of the intron .",
    "this may seem surprising at first , but is a reflection of the fact that insertions and deletions cancel each other out , and therefore a small difference in intron length does not necessarily indicate a lack of indel activity .",
    "in fact , the intuition that homologous introns of similar length must contain homologous nucleotides is false .",
    "the difference of two poisson distributions is skellam distributed , and if the rates are the same then the peak is at 0 , exactly what we see in figure 4 .",
    "the brownian motion model we have proposed is ( too ) simple ; it is the indel equivalent of the jukes - cantor model for point mutations , but it is sufficiently realistic to suggest that it may be impossible to reconstruct ancestral intron due to excessive indel turnover . the large amount of insertion and deletion should not be surprising in the light of the existence of _",
    "transposable elements_. these are repetitive elements that make up a large fraction of many genomes .",
    "the term transposable elements groups several subclasses of elements that replicate autonomously in the genome , either through reverse transcription , or directly from dna to dna via excision and repair .",
    "up to half of the human genome is composed of such elements , and although they are sometimes thought of as `` parasitic elements '' , somewhat like viruses , they clearly play an integral role in shaping genome evolution , and in many cases are believed to influence gene function .",
    "unfortunately , they confound attempts at reconstructing genomes , by virtue of creating enormous turnover in the sequences . at the very least , a complete catalog of such elements will be essential for reconstructing ancestral genomes .",
    "in the previous sections we have been assuming that the phylogenetic tree for the species under consideration is known .",
    "this assumption is , unfortunately , rarely justifiable .",
    "molecular based phylogenies may not conclusively determine certain branchings in a tree , and fossil - based phylogenies tend to have low resolution .",
    "we mention two best - case examples where despite substantial work there is still some disagreement as to the actual phylogeny . in vertebrates ,",
    "molecular techniques are not in agreement with other methods used for the rodents ( the so - called `` rodent problem '' @xcite ) , and in drosophila there is disagreement about the splits among drosophila erecta , yakuba and melanogaster @xcite .",
    "in other branches of the tree of life , the situation can be that nothing at all is known about the details of the phylogeny .",
    "thus , phylogenetic trees must be inferred , and the topology of the trees has a direct bearing on the reconstructed ancestral sequences @xcite .",
    "we begin by describing a likelihood - based strategy that can be followed , but that is computationally infeasible in practice : for each tree , the probability of the known sequences may be computed for a specific evolutionary model , and one can select the tree / evolutionary model combination with maximal likelihood .",
    "this is known as the _ maximum likelihood approach _ to phylogeny reconstruction .",
    "the reason the algorithm proposed above is computationally intractable for trees with many leaves is that the number of binary trees with @xmath2 leaves is @xmath116 .",
    "moreover , the problem of finding the maximum likelihood branch lengths for a fixed tree is very difficult @xcite .",
    "the field of phylogenetics research is very active and it is only recently that the following result was published , quantifying the difficulty of the tree reconstruction problem :    given a set of binary strings , all of the same length , and a negative number @xmath117 , it is np - hard to determine whether there is a tree @xmath49 such that the log likelihood of the sequences for the tree @xmath49 with optimal branch lengths is greater than @xmath117 .    on the positive side , there are theoretically sound approaches to phylogenetic reconstruction that are also practical for large datasets . in the context of ancestral reconstruction",
    "there are often many taxa to be considered , and the favored approach is _ neighbor joining _ @xcite ( sometimes other closely related distance - based algorithms are used @xcite ) . the neighbor joining algorithm takes as input a _ dissimilarity map _ on a set of taxa @xmath118 .",
    "this is a map @xmath119 that satisfies @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "the quantities @xmath122 are maximum likelihood estimates of the branch length ( see [ branchlength ] ) between every pair of taxa .",
    "the algorithm is :    1 .   given a dissimilarity map @xmath123 , compute the _ q - criterion _",
    "@xmath124 then select a pair @xmath125 that minimize @xmath126 as motivated by the following theorem : + [ thm : saitou ] let @xmath127 be the tree metric corresponding to the tree @xmath49 .",
    "the pair @xmath125 that minimizes @xmath128 is a cherry in the tree .",
    "2 .   if there are more than three taxa , replace the putative cherry @xmath129 and @xmath130 with a leaf @xmath131 , and construct a new dissimilarity map where @xmath132 .",
    "this is called the _",
    "reduction step_. 3 .",
    "repeat ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) until there are three taxa .",
    "neighbor - joining is fast : existing implementations run in @xmath133 where @xmath14 is the number of taxa , and it has been observed ( empirically ) to produce good results @xcite .",
    "however , despite the ubiquitous use of the algorithm , very little about it has been understood until recently .",
    "exciting new results include :    * the development of fast neighbor - joining which achieves an optimal run time of @xmath134 @xcite . * a uniqueness theorem for the algorithm @xcite .",
    "* an answer to the question of `` what does neighbor - joining optimize ''",
    "* an answer to the question of `` when ( and why ) does neighbor - joining work '' ? @xcite .    together ,",
    "these results provide new insight into the algorithm , and open up the possibility for significant improvements in accuracy .    returning to maximum likelihood phylogenetic reconstruction",
    ", recent results also show that it is possible to efficiently reconstruct the topology of trees ( with high probability ) using likelihood models of the type described in section 2 given only polylogarithmic quantities of data .",
    "[ daskalakis ] under the cavender - farris model , there is a constructive algorithm that reconstructs almost all trees on @xmath2 leaves with sequences of length @xmath135 .    a recent related result @xcite provides an alternative analysis that quantitatively couples the reconstruction problem with the ancestral reconstruction problem .",
    "indeed , it appears that ancestral sequence reconstruction and tree reconstruction are far more related than originally thought .",
    "a recent survey article @xcite proposes that `` an integrated , multi - disciplinary approach is needed in order to make progress on ancestral genome reconstruction '' .",
    "we agree with this point of view , and in the spirit of the proposal offer an invitation to mathematicians , statisticians and computer scientists by highlighting some open problems that may form a starting point for research and collaboration .",
    "we focus on problems important for biology , but many of the questions also lead to interesting mathematics @xcite .    the cavender - farris model introduced in section 2 is the simplest example of an evolutionary model . a central problem in genomics is to find appropriate models that effectively capture the mechanisms by which sequences changes , but that are also useful for inference",
    ". an important class of models that have been proposed are phylogenetic hidden markov models @xcite .        in section 4",
    ", we raise the issue of alignability of sequences , and the implications for ancestral genome reconstruction .",
    "there are other approaches to addressing the problem of alignability : in @xcite , we show that the choice of parameters is crucial for correctly identifying homologous transcription factor binding sites .",
    "the methods used are those of _",
    "parametric alignment _",
    ", which is a geometric approach to studying the dependence of optimal alignments on parameters .",
    "we propose the following problem based on @xcite .          in the field of phylogenetics",
    ", we offer two problems chosen for their specific relevance to the ancestral genome reconstruction problem . for readers interested in algebraic geometry , we mention @xcite for further mathematical problems .",
    "the reconstruction of ancestral genomes involves more than the inference of ancestral sequences based on groups of homologous extant nucleotides .",
    "the order of sequences is also important , and an important component of _ whole _",
    "genome reconstruction is the inference of the ancestral order of genomic segments .",
    "the problem is closely related to the whole genome alignment problem @xcite . in this",
    "regard , definition [ def : align ] is too restrictive .",
    "for example , it does not allow for homology relationships where there have been rearrangements , inversions , and segmental duplications . in our opinion , a major problem that needs to be solved ,",
    "where a close collaboration between biologists and mathematicians is necessary is :          for example , the signed permutation @xmath136 is a reversal alignment between the human and mouse x chromosomes ( this is an example from @xcite ) .",
    "this means that there is a division of the human x chromosome into @xmath137 pieces ( equivalently 11 breakpoints ) such that if they are labeled , in order , @xmath138 , then they appear in the mouse in the order ( [ mousex ] ) .",
    "note that the negative signs specify the direction of the segments , with a negative indicating reversal and complementation .",
    "a reversal operation involves reversing the order of a segment of a signed permutation , and flipping the signs .",
    "for example , by a reversal of ( [ mousex ] ) can consist of changing the segment @xmath139 to @xmath140 .",
    "biologically , reversals correspond to rearrangement events .",
    "the reconstruction of ancestral order is equivalent to    given a phylogenetic tree @xmath49 , a distance measure between signed permutations , and signed permutations labeling the leaves of @xmath49 , find signed permutations @xmath141 where @xmath18 ranges over all the internal nodes of @xmath49 such that the sum of the distances between permutations adjacent in the tree is minimized .",
    "the case where the distance measure is the reversal distance is already interesting and difficult , but in practice more complex distance measures need to be used ( that allow for multiple chromosomes and other events , such as duplications ) . for more on the problem see @xcite .",
    "we conclude by noting that although we have not discussed it in this paper , ancestral reconstructions of proteins can be sequenced and tested for their physiochemical properties ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , ancestral reconstructions are not merely theoretical exercises .",
    "this exciting aspect of the field continues to be developed , and will hopefully lead to tests not just of genes , but also of ancestral regulatory elements and larger genome segments .",
