    "moreover , the modulation for the data simultaneous with the observations of @xmath0-ray outbursts has the same features as the modulation for the other data , and thus the hard x - ray ( @xmath105 40 kev ) can not be the low energy tail of the @xmath0-ray emission .",

    "because using too large phase bin may suppress the orbital modulation , we fold the asm and bat lcs with @xmath108 and 30 , and obtain the modulation amplitudes @xmath109 and @xmath110 in the soft non - thermal state , respectively .    \\2 . assuming that the source stays at the state given by the pca data for @xmath111 and @xmath112 days , the modulation amplitudes for the asm and bat data are @xmath113 and @xmath114 ( @xmath115 adopted here ) , respectively .",

    "the bat lc exhibits higher ( or at least the same ) orbital modulation amplitude than the asm lc in the soft non - thermal state .",

    "in this paper , we analyzed the orbital modulations of both the soft and hard x - ray lcs of cyg x-3 , and their relation with other observation data , including the gev observations .",
    "our main results in this work are summarized as follows :    \\1 .",
    "the hid of cyg x-3 displays a `` shoe '' shape rather than the q - type shape commonly seen in other bh xrbs , and exhibits no apparent hysteresis effect , which is consistent with previous work ( hjalmarsdotter et al .",
    "2008 ; koljonen et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "we confirm that both the soft and hard lcs have stronger orbital modulation in softer states , and that the modulation amplitude decreases with increasing energy in the hard , intermediate , and very high states ; this was first reported by zdziarski et al .",
    "( 2012a ) .",
    "however , in the soft non - thermal state , the modulation amplitude of the hard x - ray lc becomes larger than that of the soft x - ray , which is in contradiction with the wind absorption scenario .",
    "there is no clear evidence of jet contribution to the observed x - ray radiation , since the modulation for the data that are simultaneous with the observations of @xmath0-ray outbursts has the same features as the modulation for the other data .",
    "the result indicates that the x - ray and @xmath0-ray emissions are created in different regions . because the hard x - ray lcs are always in phase with the soft x - ray lcs , but out of phase with @xmath0-ray emission , we can further rule out the jet origin of hard x - ray and its orbital modulation .",
