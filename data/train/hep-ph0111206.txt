    "the description of strong interactions based on qcd proves to be very successful for processes at large energies where the coupling constant is small due to the property of asymptotic freedom  @xcite .",
    "this makes perturbation theory ( pt ) computations reliable . at low energies the problem of strong coupling prevents using qcd as an unambiguous theoretical tool for computations of physical observables and various phenomenological models",
    "are introduced .",
    "these models are inspired by qcd but it is difficult to establish a quantitative relation between the underlying theory and a model used in practice . for instance , the chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) for goldstone modes is a very general model in the sense that this effective theory provides the expansion of the full qcd amplitudes at low energies according to symmetry principles without using special assumptions . in this respect",
    "the amplitudes of chpt represent the low energy limits of the exact qcd amplitudes based on current algebra and collect the current algebra results in a compact way  @xcite . of course , for the applicability of chpt one should guarantee that the expansion in the energy is well convergent ( at least explicitly ) .",
    "chpt is very practical in describing interactions of pions ( as lightest hadrons ) with nucleons or resonances at low energy in the small momentum ( and mass ) expansion  @xcite .",
    "thus the description of strong interactions at low energies relies on phenomenological models with explicit introduction of elementary hadron fields or on the closely related approaches based on general principles of analyticity , unitarity and symmetry  @xcite .",
    "a general idea of linking this approach for the description of hadrons at low energies with qcd is the concept of duality which means that the description of inclusive observables which are sensitive to the contribution of many particles is simpler than that of exclusive processes and can be represented by almost free fermions or weakly coupled quarks  @xcite .",
    "this concept works well for infrared ( ir ) soft observables in @xmath1-decays and other sum rules where the limit of massless quarks is nonsingular  @xcite . for the ir sensitive observables",
    "the realization of the duality concept for the light modes is not quite straightforward since the ir cutoff explicitly enters the calculation . in such cases",
    "the ir cutoff is usually taken from experiment such as the mass of a real hadron .",
    "strong interactions at low energies play an important role in precision tests of the standard model as a whole .",
    "they are involved in the evaluation of the cp - violating structure in the electroweak sector through hadronic matrix elements , the computation of which constitutes a main obstacle for the progress of a quantitative analysis of the nonleptonic kaon decays relevant for determination of the quark mixing matrix  @xcite and mixing of neutral pseudoscalar states  @xcite . in other tests of the standard model strong interactions enter as small corrections to very accurately measured observables .",
    "examples of high precision observables of the standard model with important contributions from strong interactions ( as corrections to the leading leptonic effects ) are the running electromagnetic ( em ) coupling constant at the scale of the @xmath2-boson mass and the muon anomalous magnetic moment ( mamm ) .",
    "the numerical values of these quantities put some constraints on the standard model parameters and can also serve as triggers of new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "a numerical value of the muon anomalous magnetic moment ( mamm ) is measured experimentally with high precision  @xcite .",
    "the value presented in a recent review  @xcite reads @xmath3 with an uncertainty of @xmath4 . in future experiments a goal",
    "is set to reach the accuracy of @xmath5 . in theoretical computations the leading contribution to the mamm is given by @xmath6 ( first calculated by schwinger ) where @xmath7 is the fine structure constant @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "the mamm is sensitive to the ir region of integration in perturbation theory diagrams . for the leptonic ( qed )",
    "part of the contribution this is reflected in a strong dependence on the electron mass .",
    "theoretically the purely leptonic part is computed in perturbative qed with finite lepton masses which leads to a function @xmath9 which is known analytically to three loops . as @xmath10",
    "the ratios @xmath11 and @xmath12 are small and the function @xmath9 can be expanded in these ratios to simplify calculations .",
    "the contribution of the muon leads to diagrams with a single scale @xmath13 that makes it simpler to compute .",
    "the complete analytical calculation is technically very complicated already at the level of three loops  @xcite .",
    "the nontrivial diagrams in higher orders were computed numerically  @xcite .",
    "the present value of the qed contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment reads  @xcite ( as a review see  @xcite ) @xmath14 computation of the electroweak ( ew ) corrections to the mamm has also been performed in perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "the ew contribution is now known with two - loop accuracy ( as a review see  @xcite ) , @xmath15 the hadronic contribution to the mamm is sensitive to the infrared region and can not be computed in perturbative qcd with light quarks .",
    "the current masses of light quarks are too small to provide a necessary infrared cutoff and explicit models of hadronization are required for a quantitative analysis  @xcite .",
    "the hadronic contribution is the main uncertainty in the theoretical computation of the mamm in the standard model . assuming the validity of the standard model for the description of elementary particle interactions @xmath16 the numerical value for the hadronic contribution to the mamm in the standard model is given by @xmath17 the experimental error dominates the uncertainty .    since the hadronic contribution is sensitive to the details of the strong coupling regime of qcd at low energies and can not be unambiguously computed in a perturbation theory framework the theoretical prediction for the mamm in the standard model depends crucially on how this contribution is estimated  @xcite . in the absence of a reliable theoretical tool for the computation in this region one",
    "turns to experimental data on low - energy hadron interactions for extracting a numerical value  @xcite . in general terms",
    "the hadronic contribution to the mamm is determined by the correlation functions of electromagnetic ( em ) currents . since",
    "a source for the em current is readily available for a wide range of energies , one tries to extract these functions or some of their characteristics relevant for a particular application from experiment . without explicit use of qcd the correction @xmath18 in the standard model",
    "is generated through the em interaction @xmath19 with @xmath20 being the hadronic part of the em current . at the leading order ( @xmath21 in formal power - counting )",
    "only the two - point correlation function of the em currents emerges in the analysis of hadronic contributions to the mamm . at the next - to - leading order ( @xmath22 ) a four - point correlation function appears .",
    "these correlators are not calculable perturbatively in the region essential for the determination of the hadronic contributions to the mamm .",
    "the leading contribution to the mamm comes from the two - point correlator referred to as the hadronic part of the photon vacuum polarization contribution while the four - point function first emerges at the @xmath22 order , most explicitly as the light - by - light scattering amplitude . to avoid using qcd in the strong coupling mode",
    "one can extract the necessary contribution to the mamm by studying these two correlation functions experimentally without an explicit realization of the hadronic em current @xmath23 in terms of elementary fields .",
    "another possibility which is close in spirit is to use phenomenological models to saturate these correlators with contributions of real hadrons at low energies  @xcite .",
    "there is also a possibility to use a concept of duality between hadron and quark - gluon descriptions modified for handling ir sensitive observables  @xcite . in the following",
    "we discuss this last option .",
    "at the leading order in @xmath7 the hadronic contribution is described by the correlator @xmath24 in terms of a single function @xmath25 of one variable @xmath26 .",
    "the contribution of @xmath25 to the muon anomalous magnetic moment ( e.g.  @xcite ) is given by @xmath27 with a one - loop kernel of the form @xmath28 here @xmath29 , @xmath30 is a muon mass .",

    "( [ stepf],[fermspect ] ) . since the integral in eq .",

    "the interpolation given by the spectral density in eq .",
    "( [ fermspect ] ) will be referred to as model  2 in the following .    at this stage",
    "it seems that hadrons have completely disappeared from the analysis and some artificial functions are rather arbitrarily used to compute the relevant integrals .",
    "the link to physics is that for such kind of inclusive observables as the mamm which are sensitive to a contribution of many hadrons the analysis can completely be done in the euclidean domain with the only ir sensitive contribution coming from the region near the origin . in the euclidean domain",
    "the contribution of all hadrons to the mamm is smeared to the extent which is determined by the distance between the integration region and the nearest physical singularity .",
    "the hadronic singularity is taken from experiment as a two - pion cut with the kinematical constraint @xmath52 .",
    "the integration , in fact , is sensitive to scales @xmath53 .",
    "therefore , a correctly normalized function ( as for duality at large energies ) with the appropriate ir behavior in the interval @xmath54 reproduces the data with reasonable accuracy . the ir behavior is mainly determined by the experimental scale @xmath55 .",
    "+    to illustrate this statement let us consider a more realistic interpolation for the vacuum polarization function in the euclidean domain from the point of view of experimental hadron physics than those described so far .",
    "the model hadron spectrum for light modes can be chosen in the following simple form @xmath56 this is a one - scale no - parameter model that satisfies the duality constraints from the operator product expansion  @xcite .",
    "the hadronic scale of the model is given by the @xmath57-meson mass @xmath58 which is eventually fixed from experiment  @xcite .",
    "we neglect small violations of flavor symmetry for the @xmath59 light modes and consider them to be degenerate . the spectrum from eq .",

    "( [ ffuncparts],[expliffun ] ) determining the mamm integral can resolve the behavior of the interpolation function @xmath61 for the hadron correlator at the scales of order @xmath68 . however , the approximation of infinitely narrow resonance in eq .",
    "( [ sphadmod ] ) is too rough for computing such an integral .",
    "thus , the low energy behavior of the spectrum is not precise enough which leads to an insufficient accuracy of the interpolation function at small @xmath69 .",

    "( [ integ ] ) are also rather close .",
    "one finds @xmath81 to be compared with @xmath82 where the first term in the sum is given by the resonance and the second by the continuum contribution .",

    "neither model  1 nor model  2 has a discontinuity across the positive semiaxis of the @xmath72-plane resembling the experimental spectrum .",
    "however , both models result in integrals over the spectrum for the respective kernels which are very close to the result obtained in the experimentally inspired model  3 and , eventually , to the data represented in eq .",
    "( [ dataint ] ) . from the purely mathematical point of view",
    "this is related to the fact that the procedure of analytic continuation is an incorrectly posed problem : small variations of functions in the euclidean domain can produce big variations on the cut .",
    "the @xmath69-dependence of the euclidean representation by the functions @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 is shown in fig .",

    "the use of direct data seems to be superior to a parameterization of the spectrum from indirect observations .",
