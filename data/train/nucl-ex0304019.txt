    "@xmath0 has been studied with increasing sophistication with baryon chiral perturbation theory ( chpt )  @xcite , i.e. , within a model - independent effective theory of qcd .",
    "the theoretical results are summarized in table  [ table2 ] and indicate remarkably robust predictions for @xmath0 at the 2 - 3% level , where the main uncertainty is related to the present knowledge of the pion  nucleon coupling constant . very recently",
    "a direct calculation confirmed that the chpt corrections at the two - loop order are small  @xcite .",
    "@xcite specifically addresses the sensitivity of muon capture experiments to physics beyond the standard model .",
    "a similar body of recent theoretical work has focused on the more intricate calculations of radiative muon capture in hydrogen ( rmc )  @xcite .    despite more than 30 years of experimental effort in this field",
    ", existing omc data only poorly constrain @xmath0 .",
    "in addition to the small rate @xmath3 and the all neutral final state of reaction  ( [ eq : mucap ] ) , a main problem lies in the kinetics of muonic hydrogen . in order to achieve acceptable muon stop rates ,",
    "most experiments were performed in high density ( i.e. liquid ) targets , where muonic atoms quickly form @xmath4 molecules .",
    "the capture rates from these states differ due to the strong spin dependence of the v - a interaction , so that the uncertain transition rate @xmath5 between the molecular ortho and para state confuses the interpretation of observed capture rates .",
    "the recent pioneering measurement of the rmc process  @xcite is less sensitive to @xmath5 , but disagrees by 4.2 standard deviations from the accurate theory .",
    "[ fig : gp ] summarizes the present controversial situation  @xcite . in spite of intense theoretical scrutiny",
    ", rmc could not be reconciled with theory , whereas even the best omc measurement can not clarify this issue due to its dependence on muonic molecular physics .",
    "the most accurate determination of @xmath0 in _ nuclear _ muon capture from a recent experiment on @xmath6he capture @xcite gives @xmath7 in good agreement with theory .",
    "note that the accuracy is limited by the theoretical extraction of @xmath0 from the three ",
    "nucleon system .",
    "a very recent calculation argues that this uncertainty in @xmath0 can be reduced to 6% by constraining the axial two - body current contributions from tritium beta decay  @xcite .",
    "the mucap experiment  @xcite is based on a new method that avoids the above mentioned molecular and other key uncertainties of earlier efforts , like the neutron detector calibration if the outgoing neutron from reaction  ( [ eq : mucap ] ) is observed .",
    "the experiment is a muon lifetime measurement in ultra - pure and deuterium - depleted hydrogen gas .",
    "the measured decay lifetime @xmath8 of the negative muon in hydrogen is shorter , compared with that of the positive muon @xmath9 , because of the additional muon capture reaction .",
    "the rate @xmath10 can be determined to 1% if both the lifetime of the positive and negative muon are measured with at least 10 ppm precision .",
    "muons of both polarities will be stopped in an active target .",
    "incoming muons are tracked by wire chambers and are stopped in a specially developed time projection chamber ( tpc ) contained in a 10-atm hydrogen pressure vessel .",
    "two cylindrical wire chambers and a large scintillator hodoscope surround the tpc , covering an effective solid angle @xmath11 ( see fig .  [ mucap ] ) .",
    "this system will reconstruct the trajectories of the electrons from muon decay .",
    "several unique features allow a dramatic improvement in precision :    * _ unambiguous interpretation .",
    "_ * as the target density is only 1% of lh@xmath12 , @xmath4 formation , which scales with density , is slowed .",
    "muon capture takes place predominantly from the singlet hyperfine state of the @xmath13 atom and is nearly independent of @xmath5 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : gp ] ) .",
    "* _ clean muon stop definition .",
    "_ * as the muon capture rate in higher - z material can exceed @xmath3 by several orders of magnitude , it is essential to eliminate muon stops and delayed diffusion to wall materials . by tracking the incident muons inside the tpc in all three dimensions , the muon stop location",
    "is determined event by event .",
    "this eliminates wall stops and allows systematic off - line studies by selective cuts on the stopping distribution .    * _",
    "gas purity control .",
    "_ * critical background reactions leading to charged recoils can be monitored _ in situ _ with the tpc .",
    "this includes detection of nuclear recoils in a @xmath14 capture , where a sensitivity to impurity levels of @xmath15 has been demonstrated .",
    "also @xmath16 transfer on isotopic deuterium impurities in the target gas , which subsequently leads to significant @xmath17 diffusion , can be directly seen in the data . in addition , a recirculating purification system is under development and gas analysis of higher - z impurities and deuterium have been developed on the 0.01 and 1  ppm sensitivity level , respectively .    * _ high statistics . _",
    "* the detector system can operate with high muon stop rates up to 30  khz using a custom designed , dead - time free readout electronics for the tpc and the electron detectors .",
    "pile - up effects , which have traditionally limited the acceptable rate by causing high accidental background , are reduced by identifying muon electron pairs by their common vertex .",
    "* _ @xmath18 rotation . _ * the remnant polarization for positive muons introduces a position - dependent intensity variation of the decay positrons , which can affect the lifetime measurement if the detector is not perfectly uniform .",
    "a saddle coil magnet generates a constant dipole field of @xmath19 80 g in the target region , which will precess the muon spin at 1 mhz .",
    "monte carlo studies indicate that this sinusoidal part largely decouples from the lifetime fit to the data .",
    "several engineering runs with prototype tpcs have been performed at psi to establish the feasibility of the new method and to optimize physics and detector parameters  @xcite .",
    "[ tpc ] shows the new tpc during assembly in the hydrogen pressure vessel .",
    "the design was optimized for the extremely stringent experimental purity requirements .",
    "only uhv - proof materials were used , bakeable to 130@xmath20 c. chamber glass frames with metallic coatings were developed onto which the gold coated tungsten wires are soldered .",
    "the glass matches the small thermal expansion of tungsten .",
    "the drift voltage of  30 kv produces a homogeneous electrical field of 2 kv / cm . in 10 bar hydrogen , this leads to drift velocities of @xmath19 5 mm/@xmath1s . in the mwpc located at the bottom of the tpc ,",
    "anode wires and cathode wires are read out giving two - dimensional coordinates .",
    "operation at @xmath19 6.5 kv high voltage results in a typical gas amplification of @xmath21 .",
    "the final hydrogen chamber system has been constructed and is presently being conditioned .",
    "the main part of the electron detector was commissioned in fall of 2002 and was used for a high statistics @xmath22 lifetime measurement in a realistic set - up .",
    "this included the precession magnet , the full data acquisition chain and a selection of target materials to study @xmath18 effects .",
    "for 2003 , two runs are planned : a commissioning / integration run of the tpc and first physics data taking in fall . in 2004 ,",
    "we foresee a high statistics mucap run with a continuous beam or with the advanced muon - on - request beam  @xcite , which is developed in the context of the mulan experiment .",
    "muon capture on the deuteron , @xmath23    results from the same hadronic current as shown in eq .",
    "[ eq : current ] and its rate @xmath24 from the doublet state of the @xmath17 atoms shows a similar sensitivity to @xmath0 as @xmath3",
    ". there are additional interesting features .",
    "the final 3-body state covers a broad range of momentum transfer to the 2-n system ( see  fig .",
    "the properties of the 2-n system enter , in particular the deuteron wave function and the neutron scattering length @xmath25 in the final state .",
    "furthermore , two - body currents contribute , making process  ( [ eq : mudcap ] ) uniquely suited to study the axial meson exchange currents ( mec ) in the 2-n system .    in recent years",
    "the structure of the two - nucleon system and its response to electro - weak probes have received considerable attention .",
    "progress has been made in complementary nuclear physics approaches , the calculation within the framework of phenomenological lagrangian models  @xcite , the development of pionless effective theory  @xcite of nucleon - nucleon interaction and the hybrid meeft approach  @xcite , which incoporates both effective field theory ( eft ) and lagrangian models .",
    "these sophisticated calculations were partially fueled by astrophysics interest , the importance of solar fusion @xmath26 as well as charged and neutral current @xmath27 scattering for the solar neutrino problem and the analysis of the sno experiment .",
    "in particular , it has been shown in model - independent eft  @xcite , that up to nnlo all neutrino deuteron break - up channels as well as pp fusion are related by one isovector axial two - body current , parametrized by the counterterm l@xmath28 .",
    "this stimulated intense effort  @xcite to calibrate all of these reactions by a single accurate measurement .",
    "alas , precision measurements of electroweak reactions in the 2-n system are extremely difficult , so that the most precise constraint of l@xmath28 is derived from the 3-n system  @xcite .",
    "it was suggested by kammel and chen  @xcite , that a determination of @xmath24 with @xmath191% precision could provide the most accurate measurement of an electroweak reaction in the two - nucleon system and , in particular , determine l@xmath28 .",
    "such an experiment is under consideration by our collaboration . in this context , one has to address at least two questions : ( a ) is reaction  ( [ eq : mudcap ] ) soft enough so that it can be compared to solar neutrino reactions ? ( b ) is a measurement at the required precision feasible ?",
    "a recent exploratory calculation  @xcite within the framework of baryon chpt constraining the axial mecs by tritium decay gives an affirmative answer to ( a ) .",
    "@xmath24 can be calculated with  1% precision , while the contribution from the small @xmath29 region , where chpt is questionable , is negligible .",
    "the l@xmath28 term contributes about 4% to the rate . on the other hand ,",
    "the applicability of pionless eft is limited to @xmath3090 mev / c and it would be preferable to measure the reduced rate for this region  @xcite .    as regards ( b ) current experimental results are of 6 - 10% precision and only marginally agree with each other  @xcite",
    ". however , the mucap strategy should allow significant improvement .",
    "moreover - if necessary - the reduced rate for the kinematic region @xmath3090 mev / c can be determined as the difference between a precise measurement of the total rate @xmath24 ( via the lifetime method ) and a measurement of the dalitz plot of neutrons with e@xmath3110 mev ( with neutron detectors ) .",
    "the latter measurement needs only limited precision of 5 - 10% , as the high - energy part contains only a small fraction of the total intensity .",
    "the main challenge is , in a different guise as for @xmath32 capture , the muon induced kinetics .",
    "the hyperfine quenching of the upper @xmath33 quartet to the @xmath34 doublet state is slow . in addition",
    ", @xmath35he@xmath1 atoms are formed after @xmath36 formation and fusion , where muon capture is larger than in deuterium .",
    "the @xmath17 system has been intensively studied as the prototype for resonant muon - catalyzed fusion  @xcite . for a clean interpretation",
    "the target conditions should be chosen such that the @xmath34 state dominates and the population of states can be verified _ in - situ _ by the observation of muon - catalyzed fusion reactions .",
    "a preliminary optimization ( fig .",
    "[ kinetics ] ) indicates promising conditions at @xmath37 and t=80 k.",
    "the fermi coupling constant @xmath2 is a fundamental constant of nature . in particular , together with @xmath38 and @xmath39 , @xmath2 defines the gauge couplings of the electroweak sector of the standard model .",
    "the most precise determination of @xmath2 comes from the measurement of the muon lifetime @xmath40",
    "@xcite @xmath41 here @xmath42 encapsulates the higher order qed and qcd corrections calculated in the fermi theory .",
    "the remaining electroweak corrections are contained in the quantity  @xcite @xmath43 defined by @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the @xmath47 coupling constant and the w boson mass , respectively .",
    "interesting quantum loop effects are absorbed in this quantity , including a remarkable sensitivity to the top quark mass and to the higgs mass as well as potential new physics  @xcite . at the moment , @xmath2 is not the limiting factor in exploiting these loop contributions , as the precision of other electroweak observables still has to be improved considerably .",
    "recent 2-loop qed calculations  @xcite led to a revised value and error of @xmath48 .",
    "the hitherto dominant theoretical uncertainty in eq .  [ eq : qedcorr ] was reduced to a negligible level .",
    "thus an extraction of @xmath2 from experiment down to the level of 0.5 ppm is becoming feasible before encountering theoretical limitations .",
    "this fact together with the spectacular precision achieved for other electroweak parameters , most notably the z mass , has stimulated a new generation of @xmath22 lifetime experiments at psi  @xcite and rutherford appleton laboratory  @xcite .",
    "the extraction of @xmath2 from eq .",
    "[ eq : qedcorr ] involves the following experimental contributions @xmath49 }                         & = & \\sqrt{0.38 ^ 2 + 9 ^ 2\\ ; [ + 10 ^ 2 ] \\ ; } ppm \\\\",
    "\\end{array}\\ ] ] the last contribution is based on the current upper bound of @xmath50kev from direct experiments .",
    "however , given the present empirical information on neutrino masses from @xmath51-oscillation and cosmic microwave background measurements , such a large @xmath52 appears unrealistic .",
    "thus the main uncertainty in @xmath2 is due to @xmath40 .",
    "the mulan collaboration  @xcite plans to reduce the uncertainty of the present experimental value of 2197.03@xmath53 0.04 ns ( 18ppm ) to 1 ppm .",
    "both the statistics and systematics must be dramatically improved , relying on the following experimental concept .",
    "_ statistics of 10@xmath54 events_. this statistics can not be achieved with the conventional `` one - muon - at - a - time '' method .",
    "instead , muons from the continuous psi beam will be electrostatically chopped  @xcite at @xmath19 50 khz in the secondary surface muon beam line of the high intensity @xmath55e3 area .",
    "this allows to accumulate pulses with several muons and then have beam free interval of @xmath56 for measurement .",
    "_ pile - up suppression_. decay positrons are registered in a soccer ball shaped arrangement of 170 tile elements consisting of 3 mm thick fast plastic scintillator pairs , which covers @xmath57 of @xmath58 .",
    "the average inner diameter of the ball is @xmath19 80 cm .",
    "the analog signals from the photomultipliers coupled to the scintillators will be digitized by 8-bit 500 mhz waveform digitizers .",
    "high segmentation , excellent pulse pair resolution and energy information are crucial to identify and suppress pile - up of two electrons hitting a tile simultaneously , which would systematically distort the observed time spectrum .",
    "_ detector stability_. target and detector material are minimized and low thresholds are used , so that the majority of michel electrons hitting a tile are detected and the effect of time - dependent gain / threshold changes is reduced .    _",
    "@xmath18 effect_. as discussed for mucap , residual @xmath22 polarization and subsequent precession and depolarization can lead to systematic distortions of the decay spectra .",
    "this effect is suppressed in several steps : by the highly symmetric detector geometry , the choice of depolarizing target material and the use of a transverse magnetic field to reduce the overall ensemble polarization per pulse and to monitor the muon spin asymmetry .",
    "a recent milestone for mulan was the development of a new kickable tune of the @xmath59 channel , based on extensive phase space simulations and measurements .",
    "the tune minimizes the angular divergence in the kicker plane , while simultaneously optimizing the phase space acceptance to obtain the required muon flux .",
    "the measured extinction factor of @xmath60 at a beam intensity of @xmath1915 mhz lies comfortably within the proposed design specifications .",
    "the new chopper is presently being built at triumf and psi .",
    "two mulan runs are scheduled for 2004 , the first for commissioning the chopper and beamline and the second for commissioning the newly built detector , electronics and high rate data acquisition .",
    "the new chopper supports different time structures , providing an exciting new facility for mulan , mucap and other fundamental muon experiments",
