    "balbus & hawley ( 1991 ; hereafter bh ) discovered a local instability of weakly magnetized accretion disks , studied earlier in the context of magnetized couette flow by @xcite and others .",
    "this instability is widely known as the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) .",
    "the instability conditions ( see @xcite ) are easily satisfied , so almost every ionized astrophysical disk is likely subject to the instability .",
    "numerical experiments have demonstrated that the mri can initiate and sustain magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence in disks ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "they have also shown that mhd turbulence in disks transports angular momentum outward . mri initiated turbulence is therefore a plausible ( arguably the most plausible ) candidate for driving accretion in astrophysical disks .",
    "disks around black holes are also likely subject to the mri .",
    "the development of the mri in these disks is of fundamental interest .",
    "but it is also of practical interest because numerical models of relativistic disks are now being developed @xcite . in particular",
    ", one would like to know if the maximum growth rate is very different from the @xmath3 expected from analyses of newtonian disks .",
    "in this short paper i will study the mri in thin , equatorial disks in the kerr metric .",
    "i will use units such that @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the black hole mass , and boyer - lindquist coordinates @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "it is useful to define the following relativistic correction factors that asymptote to @xmath0 at large distance from the black hole : @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath13 @xmath14 @xmath15 and @xmath16 these definitions are identical to those used in @xcite .    in what follows",
    "i will first develop a relativistic mechanical model for the mri (  2 ) , then a local cartesian coordinate system that permits the treatment of the mri near a rotating black hole using nonrelativistic mhd (  3 ) .",
    "i compare the maximum growth of the instability to the shear rate in  4 , and give a brief summary and prospects for future analysis in  5 .",
    "bh considered the linear theory of a magnetized disk in the wkb approximation .",
    "the full theory is rather complicated , but @xcite developed a useful mechanical model for the instability that consists of two point masses on nearly circular orbit connected by a spring .",
    "the masses are analogous to fluid elements connected by a magnetic field , which behaves like a spring .",
    "this mechanical model captures key features of the full mhd instability , including the maximum growth rate and the fact that the instability grows by exchange of angular momentum . indeed , when both the magnetic field and the wavevector of the perturbation are parallel to the axis of rotation the mechanical modes have frequencies which are _ identical _ to the wkb modes of the full mhd model if one replaces the natural frequency @xmath17 of the spring - mass system by the frequency @xmath18 .",
    "it is therefore natural to begin a study of the mri in the kerr metric by considering a relativistic version of the @xcite mechanical model .",
    "the orbits of free particles are described by the geodesic equation @xmath19 which has the following solution for circular equatorial orbits : @xmath20 @xmath21 where @xmath22 .    consider perturbations about the circular orbit , @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is small .",
    "then @xmath25 substituting @xmath26 and evaluating the connection coefficients in boyer - lindquist coordinates , one finds @xmath27 here @xmath28 is the `` vertical '' frequency and @xmath29 is the epicyclic frequency . on the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) @xmath30 .",
    "the other four modes are zero - frequency relabelings of the @xmath31 and @xmath32 coordinate .",
    "the frequencies @xmath33 and @xmath34 are defined with respect to the proper time @xmath35 ; they can be converted to frequencies with respect to the boyer - lindquist time coordinate @xmath31 ( and with respect to observers at infinity ) by dividing by @xmath36 for a circular orbit . using subscript @xmath31 to denote a frequency with respect to @xmath31 ,",
    "@xmath37 @xmath38    now consider two particles tied together by a spring .",
    "the particles lie at @xmath39 , and in the absence of rotation the natural frequency of the masses and spring is @xmath17 .",
    "the particles orbits now interact with the potential @xmath40 where @xmath41 projects the displacements into the space normal to the unperturbed ( circular ) orbit s four - velocity .",
    "the equations of motion can be derived in a variety of ways , perhaps most simply by varying the action with respect to @xmath24 .",
    "the result is @xmath42 assuming that @xmath26 , one finds that the nontrivial frequencies that correspond to motions in the equatorial plane obey @xmath43 where @xmath44 equation ( [ dispa ] ) is quadratic in @xmath45 and so easily solved . by varying @xmath17",
    "one finds that the maximum growth rate is @xmath46 which occurs for @xmath47 the maximum growth rate is defined with respect to proper time @xmath35 ; it is the growth rate measured by an observer on a circular orbit at radius @xmath48 . converting to frequencies with respect to boyer - lindquist time @xmath31 ( observers at infinity ) : @xmath49 this may be compared to the newtonian maximum growth rate @xmath50 .",
    "i will refer to the ratio of the relativistic maximum growth rate to newtonian maximum growth rate @xmath51 as the _ normalized growth rate_.    figure 1 shows the run of the normalized growth rate for @xmath52 and @xmath53 ( i.e. a counterrotating disk ) .",
    "the most dramatic effect is the drop in normalized growth rate with respect to time @xmath31 in the prograde disk .",
    "this is due to gravitational redshift ( the conversion from time @xmath35 to time @xmath31 ) so it is a global feature of the spacetime rather than a characteristic of the mri : any disk instability would experience the same redshift .",
    "the effect is strongest on the isco for prograde disks . the normalized growth rate with respect to @xmath31 drops to zero on the isco as @xmath54 , since @xmath55 there ( see eq . 9 ) .    the very limited variation of normalized growth rate with respect to proper time @xmath35 as @xmath48 and @xmath56 vary _ is _ peculiar to the mri",
    "this can be understood as follows . since @xmath57 and @xmath30 at the isco , @xmath58 at the isco",
    "one may also show that @xmath59 , hence @xmath60 at the isco .",
    "then @xmath61 on the isco .",
    "since the relativistic correction to the mri growth rate is largest at the isco , the normalized growth rate varies between @xmath1 at @xmath62 and @xmath0 as @xmath63 .",
    "in studies of thin disks in a newtonian potential it has proven useful to introduce a local cartesian coordinate frame , or _ local model_. this frame is centered on a circular orbit , the @xmath64 axis points along the radius vector , the @xmath65 axis points forward in azimuth , and the @xmath66 axis points up , normal to the disk .",
    "beginning with a global spherical coordinate system @xmath67 , the transformation to nonrelativistic local coordinates is @xmath68 @xmath69 where @xmath70 is a constant and here only @xmath71 , and @xmath72 expanding to lowest order in @xmath73 , the free particle equations of motion are @xmath74 @xmath75 @xmath76 the linear theory of magnetized disks in the wkb approximation can be carried over in its entirety to this local model because higher order terms in @xmath77 are also higher order terms in the wkb approximation .    in a relativistic disk in the equatorial plane of the kerr metric",
    "we may proceed in exactly the same way .",
    "we want to erect local cartesian coordinates near a circular orbit . in boyer - lindquist coordinates the circular orbit is located at @xmath78 and has @xmath79 .",
    "the transformation to local coordinates @xmath80 is @xmath81 @xmath82 @xmath83 @xmath72 this transformation is determined by the conditions that the local coordinates should be locally minkowski , and that the point @xmath84 should follow a circular orbit .",
    "this transformation is ( not by accident ) identical to the transformation to a corotating orthonormal basis of one - forms given by @xcite .    now consider the limit @xmath85 .",
    "expanding @xmath86 to @xmath87 , @xmath88 to @xmath89 and @xmath90 to @xmath91 ( higher order terms are not required for a consistent expansion of @xmath92 ; one can think of @xmath93 as being @xmath91 and @xmath94 as being @xmath89 ) , the metric becomes @xmath95 where @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 these are the same as the @xmath99 and @xmath33 defined in the last section .",
    "the metric component @xmath100 can be interpreted as @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the effective gravitational potential , and the @xmath103 term indicates that the local model is a frame rotating with frequency @xmath104 . using this interpretation , or working directly with the geodesic equation , one arrives at the equations of motion for a free particle @xmath105 @xmath106 @xmath107 where we have assumed that @xmath108 .",
    "one can look for motions with time dependence @xmath109 ; the free particle frequencies are identical to those found from the perturbed geodesic equation in  2 .",
    "if the disk is thin then the sound speed is small compared to the speed of light . since one expects the fluid speeds within the disk to be subsonic , the fluid motions are nonrelativistic .",
    "it follows that in the local cartesian frame the fluid obeys the equations of nonrelativistic fluid dynamics .",
    "the mhd equations of motion in the local model are then @xmath110 where @xmath111 .",
    "these equations , coupled to the continuity equation , the ( nonrelativistic ) induction equation , an energy equation , and the condition @xmath112 , give a complete description of the local evolution of the plasma in the mhd approximation .",
    "the nonrelativistic linear analysis of the balbus - hawley instability can now be carried over into the local frame by replacing the newtonian rotation frequency @xmath113 with @xmath104 , the coefficient of the tidal expansion of the effective potential @xmath114 by @xmath115 , and the newtonian vertical frequency @xmath113 by @xmath33 .",
    "general relativistic effects appear solely through the coriolis parameter @xmath104 and the tidal expansion parameter @xmath99 .    to carry forward a linear analysis we need to specify an equilibrium . the simplest choice , which captures most of the features of the nonrelativistic instability , is a uniform vertical magnetic field near the midplane of the disk , so the velocity can be written @xmath116",
    "i will restrict consideration to perturbations of the form @xmath117 ( more general perturbations do not introduce qualitatively new features in ideal mhd ) .",
    "then the dispersion relation is    @xmath118    since this is identical to the relation obeyed by the mechanical model , with @xmath119 , the maximum growth rate of the mhd instability is the same as that of the mechanical model .",
    "@xcite conjectured that the maximum growth rate should always be half the shear rate . to check this , we need a relativistic generalization of the shear rate .",
    "the natural generalization involves the scalar @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the rate - of - strain tensor and @xmath122 is the divergence of the velocity field . for a cartesian shear flow @xmath123 , where @xmath124 is constant",
    ", one finds @xmath125 , so @xmath126 is the square of the shear rate .    for circular equatorial geodesics in the kerr metric @xmath127 can be evaluated in any frame , including the boyer - lindquist coordinate frame ( this is a lengthy calculation ! ) .",
    "@xcite evaluated @xmath128 in an orthonormal tetrad moving with the flow , which is equivalent to our local coordinate frame .",
    "they found @xmath129 and all other components are zero .",
    "then @xmath130 evidently @xmath131 this confirms the relationship between the maximum growth rate and the shear rate suggested by @xcite . in the local coordinate system , of course",
    ", the relationship is trivially verified .",
    "i have shown that the growth rate of the mri in thin , equatorial disks around kerr black holes does not differ sharply from its newtonian counterpart , at least as measured by an observer on a circular orbit . as measured by an observer at infinity the growth rate",
    "is redshifted strongly for instabilities growing near the marginally stable orbit in corotating disks .",
    "a similar analysis could be carried out for inclined disks .",
    "the work of @xcite and successors ( see @xcite and references therein ) suggests , however , that close to the hole disks settle into the equatorial plane of the black hole in the presence of angular momentum diffusion ( such as that which might result from mhd turbulence initiated by the mri ) . at larger distance the deviations from newtonian gravity will be small and will likely not affect the development of the most unstable modes , which grow on the dynamical timescale .",
    "earlier work by @xcite ( see footnote 7 ) stated the results presented here without proof .",
    "@xcite gives an impressive fully relativistic linear analysis that is equivalent to results presented here ( compare figure 1 with his figure 2 ) .",
    "the fully relativistic analysis is perhaps the ultimate proof that the mri carries over nearly unchanged to relativistic disks ; the present paper states these results in a greatly simplified form ."
