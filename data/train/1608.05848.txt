    "the hypothesis that the distribution of lipids of the plasma membrane is not homogeneous , but rather is characterized by inhomogeneities , denoted `` rafts '' , that can serve as platforms for protein function continues to draw much attention .",
    "however much of the evidence for such inhomogeneities is indirect @xcite .",
    "furthermore there is no agreement on a physical mechanism that would bring about such inhomogeneities , although several have been proposed .",
    "if proteins attract some lipids in preference to others , then the aggregation of proteins would be reflected in an inhomogeneous distribution of lipids .",
    "other mechanisms which do not require the presence of proteins have also been proposed .",
    "for example , an excess of lipids in one region could result from liquid - liquid phase separation @xcite . indeed _ in vitro _",
    "ternary mixtures of a saturated lipid , representing sphingomyelin ( sm ) in the plasma membrane , an unsaturated lipid , like phosphatidylcholine ( pc ) , and cholesterol do undergo such a phase transition at biologically relevant temperatures @xcite .",
    "large macroscopically phase - separated regions have , in fact , been observed in yeast vacuoles @xcite , but never in plasma membranes .",
    "this may be due to the fact that the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane consists almost entirely of unsaturated lipid so that there is little tendency for phase separation of unsaturated and saturated lipids @xcite .",
    "it could then be argued that in the plasma membrane the critical temperature for phase separation is below biological temperatures , and that the inhomogeneities are due to fluctuations of a nearby critical point @xcite .",
    "if so , one has to understand why so many different systems are just poised at the necessary distance from a critical point that the fluctuations are just of the size thought to characterize rafts , between 10 and 100 nm .",
    "further , as noted above , there is little tendency for the inner leaflet to undergo phase separation at all .",
    "a third line of thought is that the inhomogeneities indicate that the lipid membrane is a two - dimensional microemulsion , a fluid with dynamic but well - defined structure .",
    "three - dimensional microemulsions , often consisting of oil , water , and an amphiphile are , of course , very well - known @xcite .",
    "the question then arises as to what molecule plays the role of an amphiphile in the plasma membrane .",
    "safran and co - workers @xcite have argued that the unsaturated lipids can play such a role by orienting themselves at , or near , the interface between saturated lipid - rich and saturated lipid - poor regions .",
    "there is experimental evidence , however , that this mechanism is not the origin of compositional inhomogeneities @xcite . that microemulsions could , nonetheless , be the source of compositional variations",
    "was noted by one of us @xcite observing that microemulsions can be produced by mechanisms that do not require an amphiphile .",
    "any mechanism that can produce modulated phases can produce a microemulsion as the latter can be thought of as resulting from the melting , or disordering , of the former .",
    "modulated phases have indeed been observed in mixtures of three , or four lipids @xcite and in yeast vacuoles @xcite which renders plausible the idea that the plasma membrane might be characterized as a microemulsion .",
    "two mechanisms that could bring about modulated phases and microemulsions without an amphiphile have been proposed .",
    "recently amazon et al .",
    "@xcite noted that a membrane bending modulus which varied with the local composition could bring about modulated phases on a closed bilayer vesicle .",
    "earlier , schick @xcite noted that there was a significant difference between the large spontaneous curvature of pe and the relatively small one of ps , and therefore proposed that the coupling of membrane fluctuations and a compositionally - dependent spontaneous curvature @xcite could be the mechanism at work .",
    "just such a cholesterol - dependent spontaneous curvature of pe was recently invoked by us @xcite to explain the several observations that cholesterol is located preferentially in the cytoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane @xcite .",
    "it is this mechanism that we shall invoke in this paper .",
    "because this significant difference in spontaneous curvature of the components is only characteristic of the cytoplasmic layer , we must treat an asymmetric bilayer , as had been done earlier by shlomovitz and schick @xcite . in that paper , however , the role of cholesterol was ignored , and the system was characterized by one order parameter in each leaflet . in this paper , we include cholesterol explicitly and characterize each leaflet by three components ; sm , pc , and cholesterol in the outer leaflet , pe , ps , and cholesterol in the inner leaflet .",
    "furthermore we require that the chemical potentials of the cholesterol in each leaflet be equal reflecting the rapid exchange of cholesterol between leaflets @xcite .",
    "our model is reviewed in the next section .",
    "we calculate structure functions between various components , in particular the pe - pe and sm - sm structure functions .",
    "we find that over a wide range of compositions of the inner leaflet , the pe - pe structure functions have a maximum at a non - zero wave number , a feature characteristic of a microemulsion .",
    "the wave number corresponds to a length of about 37 nm .",
    "the behavior of the structure function indicates that the inner leaflet evinces the largest response at this distance from a perturbation .",
    "the sm - sm structure function shows that the outer leaflet is either a normal fluid or a microemulsion depending upon the strength of the coupling between the two leaflets .",
    "we also examine the two - particle pe - pe correlation function of the inner leaflet obtained from the structure function .",
    "it has the form of an exponentially damped oscillatory function .",
    "however the correlation length , which sets the scale of the exponential damping , is in general considerably smaller than the wavelength of the oscillations . as a consequence",
    ", the only observable remnant of the oscillations is that the correlation function decays to zero from negative values .",
    "consequently , while the system is quite susceptible to perturbations of a large size , it does not , of itself , display inhomogeneities at such a length scale .",
    "[ sec : intro ]",
    "we consider a bilayer which contains ps , pe , and cholesterol in the inner leaflet , and sm , pc , and cholesterol in the outer leaflet .",
    "further , as we know that cholesterol tends to order the chains of the other lipids , particularly the saturated chains of sm , we consider there to be two populations of sm ; those with more - ordered chains , sm@xmath0 , and those with less - ordered chains , sm@xmath1 .",
    "these populations freely convert between one another .",
    "this description can produce @xcite the closed - loop phase diagram observed in some ternary mixtures @xcite .",
    "we denote the number of molecules of each component in the inner leaflet by @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and the total number of molecules in the inner leaflet by @xmath5 . similarly denote the number of molecules of each component in the outer leaflet by @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 and the total number of molecules in the outer leaflet by @xmath10 .",
    "then the mol fractions of the @xmath11th component is @xmath12 it is more convenient to work with the mol fractions defined in each leaflet separately rather than in the total bilayer .",
    "thus we introduce the mol fractions of the @xmath13th component in the inner and outer leaflets , @xmath14    we consider all lipids , save cholesterol , to have the same area per lipid , @xmath15 nm@xmath16 , and take that of cholesterol to be @xmath17nm@xmath16 @xcite .",

    "of course the behavior of the plasma membtane for all such ratios is unknown , but we impose this condition so as to avoid prejudicing a case for the presence of a microemulsion by stabilizing a modulated phase at values of lipid ratios near those of the actual plasma membrane .",

    "[ fig : fig1](a ) , which displays the correlation between fluctuations in the concentration of pe in the inner leaflet , is characterized by a peak at a non - zero wave vector @xmath76 nm@xmath77 which corresponds to a wavelength of @xmath78 nm .    the fourier transform of this function , the pe - pe correlation function @xmath79 , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](b ) .",
    "it displays no oscillations because the correlation length is @xmath80 nm , much shorter than the wavelength @xmath81 .",
    "nonetheless , it is notable that the correlation function does not decay as a simple exponential , but approaches its asymptotic value from below , a remnant of the exponentially damped oscillatory behavior .",
    "in contrast to the inner leaflet , the outer one does not display the characteristics of a microemulsion , but rather that of a normal fluid .",
    "for example , the structure function @xmath82 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](a ) , displays a peak at zero wave vector , and the correlation function , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](b ) , decays to zero from above with the same correlation length @xmath80 nm .",
    "such a coupling of a microemulsion in one leaflet and a normal fluid in the other has been discussed previously @xcite .",
    "if the coupling @xmath39 between leaflets is increased by an order of magnitude , we find that the microemulsion in the inner leaflet is conveyed to the outer one as evidenced by the fact that @xmath82 now displays a peak at non - zero wave vector .",
    "the structure functions arising from fluctuations in any pair of components can be obtained .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : inner ] the @xmath83 and @xmath84 functions .",

    "[ fig : outer ] shows @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "these show that the outer leaflet is a normal fluid and that the sm and cholesterol in the outer leaflet are correlated as expected . finally in fig .",
    "[ fig : cross ] we display @xmath87 and @xmath88 which shows the fluctuations in sm and cholesterol in the inner leaflet to be correlated while those of pe and cholesterol in the outer leaflet to be anticorrelated . in table",
    "[ table : lipc ] we show the concentrations of the various components in the two leaflets .",
    "the percentage of the total cholesterol which is in the inner leaflet is 61% in accord with most experiments which show that the cholesterol is either evenly divided between leaflets @xcite , or more abundant in the inner leaflet@xcite .",
    ".lipid composition of the two leaflets is shown on the left as mol fraction in the leaflet , and on the right as mol fraction in the bilayer . [ cols=\"<,^,<,^ \" , ]     that the inner leaflet is a microemulsion is due to the coupling of the membrane curvature to the membrane spontaneous curvature , dominated by that of pe .",
    "thus the appearance of the microemulsion in the inner leaflet depends upon the strength of this coupling . to consider this further ,",
    "we have multiplied by a parameter @xmath89 the term @xmath90 in eq .",
    "( [ fourier ] ) that couples the height and composition fluctuations .",
    "we find that the appearance of the microemulsion in the inner leaflet is quite robust .",
    "the strength of the coupling as measured by @xmath89 would have to be reduced by more than two orders of magnitude for the inner leaflet to behave like an ordinary fluid as indicated by a peak at zero wave number in @xmath91 thus there is a very large range of values of the coupling strength over which the inner leaflet displays the properties of a microemulsion . on the other hand , we note that with a value of spontaneous curvature appropriate to pe the microemulsion is near its limit of stability . with an increase of @xmath89 from its value of unity by about 1.7% , the correlation functions in both leaflets , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : osci ] , clearly display exponentially damped oscillatory behavior because the correlation lengths have increased to 41.5 and 55 nm , larger than the wavelength of about 33 nm .",
    "an increase in the coupling strength by 2% brings about a transition to a modulated phase .",
    "we have employed a model of an asymmetric plasma membrane with sm , pc , and cholesterol in the outer leaflet and pe , ps , and cholesterol in the inner leaflet .",
    "the membrane curvature is coupled to the concentration of pe in the inner leaflet via a cholesterol - dependent spontaneous curvature , one which reproduces the distribution of cholesterol between leaflets observed in several experiments .",
    "we find that the model predicts that the inner leaflet is almost certainly a microemulsion , but most probably a weak one with the correlation length , of order of a few nanometers or less , being much smaller than the wavelength of the spatial variations , of order 37 nm .",
    "consequently little of the latter are seen .",
    "whether this microemulsion propagates to the outer leaflet depends upon the strength of the coupling between leaflets .",
    "the results of this model for the origin of `` rafts '' differ significantly from those of others .",
    "in particular the model states that such inhomogeneities , identified as arising from a microemulsion , originate in the inner leaflet .",
    "furthermore because the microemulsion is weak , the model predicts that such inhomogeneities would not be present in a membrane consisting solely of lipids .",
    "however the response of the inner leaflet to external perturbations , due to non - lipid components , proteins perhaps , is largest at a distance of the order of 37 nm from the site of the perturbation .",
    "the origin of this length is clear in the model , and can be traced to the physical properties of the membrane itself via its bending rigidity and surface tension .",
    "the propagation of this response to the outer leaflet is enhanced by coupling between the leaflets .",
    "the strength of the microemulsion , that is the degree to which spatial variations would be evident , depends in large part on the local spontaneous curvature of the membrane , which points to the importance of membrane composition .",
    "indeed we believe that the mechanism explored here provides a plausible explanation for the modulated phases observed in the yeast plasma membrane @xcite and other systems , both _ in vitro_. @xcite and _ in vivo _",
    "given the close connection between modulated phases and microemulsions , it follows that these systems are very likely to display the latter as well .",
