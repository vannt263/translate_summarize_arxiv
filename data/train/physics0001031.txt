    "roe and woodroofe @xcite have made an interesting suggestion for modifying the `` unified approach '' to classical confidence intervals which feldman and i advocated in ref .",
    "they invoke the use of `` conditioning '' , namely replacing frequentist coverage probabilities with conditional probabilities , still calculated in a frequentist manner , but conditioned on knowledge gained from the result of the particular experiment at hand .",
    "roe and woodroofe ( rw ) illustrate their suggestion using one of the two prototype problems , that of poisson processes with background .",
    "suppose , for example that an experiment observes 3 events ( signal plus background ) .",
    "then the experimenters know that , in that particular experiment , there were 3 or fewer background events .",
    "rw therefore calculate the frequentist coverage using an ensemble of experiments with 3 or fewer background events , rather than the larger unrestricted ensemble which we used .",
    "thus , the rw ensemble changes from experiment to experiment . conditioning on an equality has a long history in classical statistics .",
    "@xcite contains key references . )",
    "however , conditioning on an inequality , as rw do when the number of events is greater than zero , is perhaps less well founded , and it is interesting to explore the consequences .    in this paper , we attempt to apply rw - like conditioning to the other prototype problem , that of gaussian errors with a bounded physical region .",
    "the result is similar to the poisson problem analyzed by rw , but difficulties which were apparently masked by the discrete nature of the poisson problem now arise . in particular ,",
    "the lower endpoints of confidence intervals are moved significantly in an undesirable direction .",
    "as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we consider an observable @xmath0 which is the measured value of parameter @xmath1 in an experiment with a gaussian resolution function with known fixed rms deviation @xmath2 , set here to unity .",
    "i.e. , @xmath3 we consider the interesting case where only non - negative values for @xmath1 are physically allowed ( for example , if @xmath1 is a mass ) .    the confidence - belt construction in ref .",
    "@xcite proceeded as follows . for a particular @xmath0 , we let @xmath4 be the physically allowed value of @xmath1 for which @xmath5 is maximum",
    ". then @xmath6 , and @xmath7 we then compute the likelihood ratio @xmath8 , @xmath9 during our neyman construction of confidence intervals , @xmath8 determines the order in which values of @xmath0 are added to the acceptance region at a particular value of @xmath1 . in practice , this means that for a given value of @xmath1 , one finds the interval @xmath10 $ ] such that @xmath11 and @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the confidence level ( c.l . ) .",
    "we solve for @xmath14 and @xmath15 numerically to the desired precision , for each @xmath1 in a fine grid . with the acceptance regions",
    "all constructed , we then read off the confidence intervals @xmath16 $ ] as in ref .",
    "in order to formulate the conditioning , we find it helpful to think of the measured value @xmath0 as being the sum of two parts , the true mean @xmath17 and the random `` noise '' which we call @xmath18 : @xmath19 we are considering the case where it is known on physical grounds that @xmath20 .",
    "thus , if an experimenter obtains the value @xmath21 in an particular experiment , then he or she knows that , _ in that particular experiment _ , @xmath22 for example , if the experimenter measures @xmath1 and obtains @xmath23 , then the experimenter knows that @xmath24 in that particular experiment .",
    "this information is analogous to the information in the poisson problem above in which one knows that in the particular experiment , the number of background events is 3 or fewer .",
    "we thus use it the manner analogous to that of rw : our particular experimenter will consider the ensemble of experiments with @xmath25 when constructing the confidence belt relevant to his or her experiment .    we let @xmath26 be the ( normalized ) conditional probability for obtaining @xmath0 , given that @xmath25 . in notation similar to that of rw , this can be denoted as @xmath27 : @xmath28 given @xmath21 , at each @xmath0 we find @xmath4 , that value of @xmath1 which maximizes @xmath26 : @xmath29 in the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath30 is then @xmath31 then the ratio @xmath8 of eqn .",
    "[ eqn - r - gauss ] is replaced by @xmath32 which vanishes if @xmath33 , and otherwise is given by @xmath34 figures [ fig - mu0.01 ] through [ fig - mu2.5 ] show graphs of @xmath27 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 , for three values of @xmath1 , for each of three values of @xmath21 .",
    "we let @xmath37 be the value of @xmath38 for which @xmath39 the modified confidence interval consists of those @xmath1 for which @xmath40    note that this entire construction depends on the value of @xmath21 obtained by the particular experiment .",
    "an experiment obtaining a different value of @xmath21 will have a different function in eqn .",
    "[ eqn - gauss - cond ] , and hence a different confidence belt construction .",
    "figure [ fig - belts ] shows examples of such constructions for six values of @xmath21 .",
    "the vertical axis gives the endpoints of the confidence intervals .",
    "each different confidence belt construction is used only for an experiment obtaining the value @xmath21 which was used to construct the belt .",
    "the interval @xmath16 $ ] at @xmath41 is read off for that experiment ; the rest of that plot is not used .    finally , we can form the graph shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - gauss - roe ] by taking the modified confidence interval for each @xmath21 , and plotting them all on one plot .",
    "these are tabulated in table  [ tab - gauss - roe ] , which includes for comparison the unconditioned intervals from table x of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "[ fig - gauss - roe - fc ] shows the modified intervals plotted together with the unified intervals of ref .",
    "the modified upper curve is shifted upward for negative @xmath0 , which results in a less stringent upper limit when @xmath18 is known to be negative ; this feature is considered desirable by some . the lower curve , however , is also shifted upward : for all @xmath42 , the interval is two - sided .",
    "we find this to be a highly undesirable side - effect .",
    "it is interesting to consider what happens if one applies fig .",
    "[ fig - gauss - roe ] to an unconditioned ensemble .",
    "the result can be seen by drawing a horizontal line at any @xmath1 in fig .",
    "[ fig - gauss - roe ] and integrating @xmath5 ( eqn.[eqn - gauss ] ) along that line between the belts . for small @xmath1 ,",
    "there is significant undercoverage , while for @xmath1 near 1.0 , there is significant overcoverage .",
    "the undercoverage was surprising , since the conditioned intervals always cover within the relevant subset of the ensemble .",
    "however , conditioning on an inequality means that these subsets are not disjoint .",
    "the undesirable raising of the lower curve is present in the poisson case , as can be seen in figure 1 of ref .",
    "however , there the discreteness of the poisson problem apparently prevents the curve from being shifted so dramatically , and the two - sided intervals do not extend to such low values of the measured @xmath43 .",
    "in this paper , we apply conditioning in the style roe and woodroofe to the gaussian - with - boundary problem .",
    "we find that the transition from one - sided intervals to two - sided intervals undesirably moves to the origin .",
    "this reflects a general feature of confidence interval construction : when moving one of the two curves , the other curve moves also . in the poisson - with - background problem ,",
    "the undesirable movement was not large , but in the gaussian - with - boundary problem , the effect is quite substantial .",
