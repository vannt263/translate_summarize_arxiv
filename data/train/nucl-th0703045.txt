    "the monopole transitions from cluster states to ground states in light nuclei are rather large in comparison with the single particle strength .",
    "for example in @xmath2o the monopole matrix elements @xmath4 between the ground state and the first and second excited @xmath5 states at @xmath6 = 6.05 mev and 12.05 mev which are known to have @xmath3c+@xmath7 cluster structure  @xcite are @xmath8  @xmath9 and @xmath10  @xmath9  @xcite , respectively .",
    "also in @xmath3c the @xmath4 value between the ground state and the first excited @xmath5 state at @xmath6 = 7.66 mev ( so - called hoyle state  @xcite ) which is known to have a @xmath11 cluster structure  @xcite is @xmath12  @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "a rough estimate of the single particle strength @xmath13 is @xmath14 for @xmath15- and @xmath16-shell nuclei ( @xmath17 fm ) .",
    "this estimation formula is obtained under the uniform - density approximation of @xmath18 for @xmath19 and @xmath20 with @xmath21 standing for the nuclear radius .",
    "the energy weighted strengths of the above mentioned monopole transitions give an appreciable portion of the sum rule values : in @xmath2o they are about 3 @xmath22 and 8 % for @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively , and in @xmath3c about 16 % for @xmath0 ( see appendix  [ sumrule ] ) .",
    "recently kawabata and his collaborators have studied the excited states of @xmath23b by performing @xmath24 reaction and they concluded that the third @xmath25 state at @xmath6 = 8.56 mev has a @xmath26 cluster structure  @xcite . among many reasons for this conclusion , one is a large monopole strength for the third @xmath25 state which is of similar value to the monopole strength for the second @xmath5 state in @xmath3c , and another is that the amd ( antisymmetrized molecular dynamics ) calculation  @xcite as well as the @xmath27 ocm ( orthogonality condition model ) calculation  @xcite have reproduced the large monopole strength and have assigned loosely bound @xmath26 cluster structure to the third @xmath25 state .",
    "the single particle estimate of the monopole transition is based on the assumption that the excited state has a one - particle one - hole excitation from the ground state .",
    "however , the cluster structure is very different from the shell - model - like structure of the ground state , and its state is described as a superposition of many - particle many - hole configurations when it is expanded by shell model configurations .",
    "this means that in the excited state with a cluster structure , the component of a one - particle one - hole excitation from the ground state configuration is expected to be very small .",
    "therefore the observation of rather large monopole strengths for cluster states which are comparable with single particle strength looks _ not _ to be easy to explain .",
    "the @xmath3c+@xmath7 ocm calculation  @xcite for @xmath2o and @xmath11 rgm ( resonating group method ) calculation  @xcite , however , have reproduced rather well the experimental data of the monopole transitions .",
    "no explicit and detailed analyses of the reason why the cluster models reproduce plausibly the experimental data have been presented so far as long as we know .",
    "there should exist underlying physics in the monopole transition strengths in light nuclei .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to clarify the basic reasons why monopole transition strength between a cluster state and the ground state in light nuclei is generally rather large in comparison with the single particle strength and shares an appreciable portion of the sum rule value , in spite of the large difference of structure between the initial and final states .",
    "we analyse the above - mentioned three cases of monopole transisions in @xmath2o and @xmath3c , namely the monopole transitions between the ground state and the first and second excited @xmath5 states in @xmath2o , and the monopole transition between the ground state and the first excited @xmath5 state in @xmath3c . by using these analyses",
    "we will show that there are two basic reasons for the generally large strength of monopole transitions .",
    "the first reason is the fact that the clustering degree of freedom is possessed even by simple shell model wave functions .",
    "the detailed feature of this fact is described by the so - called bayman - bohr theorem  @xcite .",
    "this theorem tells us that the su(3 ) shell model wave function  @xcite describing the ground state is in most cases equivalent to the cluster - model wave function discussed by wildermuth and kanellopoulos  @xcite .",
    "thus we can see what kinds of clustering degrees of freedom are embedded in the ground state . for example the doubly closed - shell wave function of the @xmath2o ground state ( total quanta @xmath28 ) which is just the su(3 ) shell model wave function with @xmath29 is equivalent to a @xmath3c + @xmath7 cluster - model wave function with @xmath28 .",
    "this means that the ground - state wave function of @xmath2o originally has a @xmath3c+@xmath7 clustering degree of freedom .",
    "the second reason is the ground state correlation induced by the activation of the cluster degrees of freedom described by the bayman - bohr theorem . in the case of the above example of the @xmath2o ground state , the ground state correlation is due to the @xmath3c + @xmath7 clustering degrees of freedom .",
    "as was explained , the first and second excited @xmath5 states of @xmath2o are the cluster states with @xmath3c + @xmath7 structure .",
    "these cluster states are formed just by the excitation of the @xmath3c + @xmath7 clustering degree of freedom which is already existent in the ground state .",
    "therefore it is quite reasonable that the large strength of the monopole transition between the ground state and the first and second excited @xmath5 states is explained by the above - mentioned first and second reasons .",
    "we will demonstrate , by deriving analytical expressions of monopole matrix elements , that the order of magnitude of the monopole strength is governed by the first reason , while the second reason plays a sufficient role in reproducing the data up to the factor of magnitude of the monopole strength .    in the present paper",
    "we discuss the details of the first and second reasons for @xmath2o and @xmath3c . in the case of @xmath2o , we make use of the microscopic @xmath3c + @xmath7 cluster wave function , while in the case of @xmath3c , we discuss the problem by using the so - called thsr wave function  @xcite .",
    "our results mean that the measurement of strong monopole transitions provides us in general with a very useful tool for the experimental study of cluster states as has been practiced in ref .",

    "the implication of the bayman - bohr theorem has been misunderstood such that the cluster model description is rather unnecessary , since a cluster model wave function is equivalent to a shell model wave function .",
    "the existence of cluster states especially as excited states is well established these days .",
    "thus , the implication of the bayman - bohr theorem should be understood straightforwardly as follows .",
    "if the ground state is well described by an su(3 ) shell model wave function equivalent to a cluster model wave function , the ground state possesses two different characters simultaneously , shell - model - state character and cluster - model - state character .",
    "this means that the ground state has mean - field degree of freedom and clustering degree of freedom simultaneously .",
    "both of them can be excited , when the nucleus is stimulated by an external field .",
    "the monopole excitation to excited cluster states demonstrates us directly the evidence that the clustering degree of freedom is embedded in the ground state . in this paper",
    "we showed that the clustering degree of freedom embedded in the ground state can reproduce the order of magnitude of the monopole strength even without taking into account the ground state correlation .",
    "moreover it was demonstrated that , if we take into account the ground state correlation activating the clustering degree of freedom described by the bayman - bohr theorem , the monopole strengths are reproduced within a factor of @xmath224 in @xmath2o and within a factor of @xmath303 in @xmath3c , in comparison with the observed values .",
    "our present study ascertains that the monopole transition between cluster and ground states in light nuclei is generally strong as to be comparable to the single particle strength .",
