    "it is a great pleasure and honor to contribute to this special day devoted to celebrate the 75th anniversary of david brink .",
    "after many years of acquaintance and collaboration i would like to state a few points i mostly got from him : 1 . ) the mean field `` moves '' the world , particularly true in nuclear dynamics , as i will show in examples discussed here ; 2 . )",
    "the role of relativity in nuclear structure and reactions ; 3 . )",
    "play always a deep attention to the suggestions of young people ; 4 . ) follow a `` sensible '' behaviour towards the political choices , i.e. try to change something only when you can count on something better . here of course i will focus on the physics part showing a series of results broadly inspired by the david ideas .    in the last years",
    "the isospin dynamics has gained a lot of interest , as we can see from the development of new heavy ion facilities ( radioactive beams ) , for the unique possibilities of probing the isovector in medium interaction far from saturation , relevant for the structure of unstable elements as well as for nuclear astrophysics see the recent reviews @xcite .    here",
    "i will show some selected results of the mean field transport approach in a wide energy range , from few @xmath3 to few @xmath4 , in non - relativistic and relativistic frames . at low energies i will discuss the isospin equilibration in dissipative collisions , fusion and deep - inelastic , through a related observable , the prompt collective dipole radiation . at high energies i will shortly present isospin effects on collective flows , on particle production and finally on the transition to a mixed hadron - quark phase at high baryon density .",
    "the possibility of an entrance channel bremsstrahlung dipole radiation due to an initial different n / z distribution was suggested at the beginning of the nineties @xcite , largely inspired by david discussions . at that time",
    "a large debate was present on the disappearing of @xmath6 in fusion reactions .",
    "david was suggesting the simple argument that a @xmath7 needs time to be built in a hot compound nucleus , meanwhile the system will cool down by neutron emission and the @xmath7 photons will show up at lower temperature .",
    "the natural consequence suggested in @xcite was that we would expect a new dipole emission , in addition to the statistical one , if some pre - compound collective dipole mode is present .",
    "after several experimental evidences , in fusion as well as in deep - inelastic reactions @xcite we have now a good understanding of the process and stimulating new perspectives from the use of radioactive beams .    during the charge equilibration process taking place in the first stages of dissipative reactions between colliding ions with different n / z ratios , a large amplitude dipole collective motion develops in the composite dinuclear system , the so - called dynamical dipole mode .",
    "this collective dipole gives rise to a prompt @xmath8-ray emission which depends : i ) on the absolute value of the intial dipole moment @xmath9 being @xmath10 and @xmath11 the center of mass of protons and of neutrons respectively , while r@xmath12 and r@xmath13 are the projectile and target radii ; ii ) on the fusion / deep - inelastic dynamics ; iii ) on the symmetry term , below saturation , that is acting as a restoring force .    a detailed description is obtained in a microscopic approach based on semiclassical transport equations , of vlasov type , introduced in the nuclear dynamics in collaboration with david @xcite , where mean field and two - body collisions are treated in a self - consistent way , see details in @xcite .",
    "realistic effective interactions of skyrme type are used .",
    "the numerical accuracy of the transport code has been largely improved in order to have reliable results also at low energies , just above the threshold for fusion reactions @xcite .",
    "the resulting physical picture is in good agreement with quantum time - dependent - hartree - fock calculation @xcite . in particular we can study in detail how a collective dipole oscillation develops in the entrance channel @xcite .",
    "first , during the @xmath14 , the two partners , overcoming the coulomb barrier , still keep their own response . then follows a _ dinuclear phase _ where the relative motion energy , due to the nucleon exchange , is converted in thermal motion and in the collective energy of the dinuclear mean field .",
    "in fact the composite system is not fully equilibrated and manifests , as a whole , a large amplitude dipole collective motion .",
    "finally thermally equilibrated reaction products are formed , with consequent statistical particle / radiation emissions .",
    "space @xmath15 ( solid lines ) and @xmath16space @xmath17 ( dashed lines , in @xmath18 ) and the correlation @xmath19 at incident energy of @xmath20 and @xmath21 for @xmath22 . ]",
    "s + @xmath23mo system at incident energy of @xmath20 and @xmath21 . ]    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we present here some results for the @xmath24s + @xmath23mo ( @xmath25 asymmetric ) reaction at @xmath26 , recently studied vs. the `` symmetric '' @xmath27s + @xmath28mo counterpart in ref.@xcite . in fig.[spiral ] ( left columns )",
    "we draw the time evolution for @xmath22 of the dipole moment in the @xmath29-space ( solid lines ) , @xmath30 and in @xmath16space ( dashed lines ) , @xmath31 , where @xmath32 , with @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) center of mass in momentum space for protons ( neutrons ) , is just the canonically conjugate momentum of the @xmath35 coordinate , see @xcite . on the right hand side columns we show the corresponding correlation @xmath19 in the phase space .",
    "we choose the origin of time at the beginning of the _ dinuclear _ phase .",
    "the nice `` spiral - correlation '' clearly denotes the collective nature of the mode . from fig.[spiral ]",
    "we note that the `` spiral - correlation '' starts when the initial dipole moment @xmath36 , the geometrical value at the touching point , is already largely quenched .",
    "this is the reason why the dinucleus dipole yield is not simply given by the `` static '' estimation but the reaction dynamics has a large influence on it .",
    "a clear energy dependence of the dynamical dipole mode is evidenced with a net increase when we pass from @xmath20 to @xmath21 .",
    "a possible explanation of this effect is due to the fact that at lower energy , just above the coulomb barrier , a longer transition to a dinuclear configuration is required which hinders the isovector collective response . from fig.[fusdyn ] a slower dynamics of the neck during the first @xmath37 from the touching configuration is observed at @xmath38 .",
    "when the collective dipole response sets in the charge is already partially equilibrated via random nucleon exchange .",
    "the bremsstrahlung spectra shown in fig.[spectra ] support this interpretation .",
    "s + @xmath23mo system at incident energy of @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( solid line ) and the first step statistical spectrum ( dashed line ) for three impact parameters . ]    in fact from the dipole evolution given from the vlasov transport we can directly apply a bremsstrahlung _ ( `` bremss '' ) _",
    "approach @xcite to estimate the `` direct '' photon emission probability ( @xmath39 ) : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the fourier transform of the dipole acceleration @xmath42 .",
    "we remark that in this way it is possible to evaluate , in _ absolute _ values , the corresponding pre - equilibrium photon emission .",
    "in the same fig.[spectra ] we show statistical @xmath7 emissions from the final excited residue .",
    "we see that at the higher energy the prompt emission represents a large fraction of the total dipole radiation .",
    "in the table we report the present status of the dynamical dipole data , obtained from fusion reactions .. we note the dependence of the extra strength on the interplay between initial dipole moment and initial mass asymmetry : this clearly indicates the relevance of the fusion dynamics .",
    "we must add a couple of comments of interest for the experimental selection of the dynamical dipole : i ) the centroid is always shifted to lower energies ( large deformation of the dinucleus ) ; ii ) a clear angular anisotropy should be present since the prompt mode has a definite axis of oscillation ( on the reaction plane ) at variance with the statistical @xmath7 . at higher beam energies we expect a further decrease of the direct dipole radiation for two main reasons both due to the increasing importance of hard nn collisions : i ) a larger fast nucleon emission that will equilibrate the isospin before the collective dipole starts up ; ii ) a larger damping of the collective mode",
    "this has been observed in ref.@xcite and more exps .",
    "are planned @xcite .    before closing",
    "i would like to note two interesting developments for future experiments with radioactive beams :    * the prompt dipole radiation represents a nice cooling mechanism on the fusion path .",
    "it could be a way to pass from a _",
    "warm _ to a _ cold _ fusion in the synthesis of heavy elements with a noticeable increase of the _ survival _ probability , @xcite .",
    "* the use of unstable neutron rich projectiles would largely increase the effect allowing a detailed study of the symmetry potential , below saturation , responsible of the restoring force of the dipole oscillation @xcite",
    "we move now to a relativistic framework for the description of the isovector part of the effective interaction .",
    "i will focus then the attention on relativistic heavy ion collisions , that provide a unique terrestrial opportunity to probe the in - medium nuclear interaction in high density and high momentum regions .",
    "an effective lagrangian approach to the hadron interacting system is extended to the isospin degree of freedom : within the same frame equilibrium properties ( @xmath43 , @xcite ) and transport dynamics ( @xcite ) can be consistently derived . within a covariant picture of the nuclear mean field , for the description of the symmetry energy at saturation ( @xmath44 parameter of the weizsecker mass formula ) ( in a sense equivalent to the @xmath45 parameter for the iso - scalar part ) , extracted in the range from 28 to 36 mev",
    ", there are different possibilities : ( a ) considering only the lorentz vector @xmath46 mesonic field , and ( b ) both , the vector @xmath46 ( repulsive ) and scalar @xmath47 ( attractive ) effective fields @xcite .",
    "the latter corresponds to the two strong effective @xmath48 ( repulsive ) and @xmath49 ( attractive ) mesonic fields of the iso - scalar sector .",
    "we get a transparent form @xcite : @xmath50 \\rho_{b } ,   \\label{esym3}\\ ] ] with @xmath51 .",
    "once the @xmath44 empirical value is fixed from the @xmath52 balance , important effects at supra - normal densities appear due to the introduction of the effective @xmath47 field .",
    "in fact the presence of an isovector scalar field is increasing the repulsive @xmath46-meson contribution at high baryon densities @xcite via a pure relativistic mechanism , due to the different lorentz properties of these fields ( the vector @xmath46 field grows with baryon density whereas the scalar @xmath47 field is suppressed by the scalar density ) .",
    "dynamical , non - equilibrium , effects can be more sensitive to such `` fine structure '' of the isovector interaction .",
    "we will see the vector couplings give @xmath5-boosted lorentz forces , and so we expect a larger isospin dependence of the high energy nucleon propagation .",
    "moreover , the scalar @xmath47 field naturally leads to an effective ( @xmath53 ) mass splitting between protons and neutrons @xcite , with influence on nucleon emissions and flows @xcite . in order to explore the symmetry energy at supra - normal densities",
    "one has to select signals directly emitted from the early non - equilibrium high density stage of the heavy ion collision .",
    "a transverse momentum analysis is important in order to select the high density source @xcite .",
    "the description of the mean field is important , since nucleons and resonances are _ dressed _ by the self - energies .",
    "this will directly affect the energy balance ( threshold and phase space ) of the inelastic channels .",
    "the starting point is a simple phenomenological version of the non - linear ( with respect to the iso - scalar , lorentz scalar @xmath49 field ) walecka model which corresponds to the hartree or relativistic mean field ( @xmath54 ) approximation within the quantum - hadro - dynamics @xcite . according to this model the baryons ( protons and neutrons )",
    "are described by an effective dirac equation @xmath55 , whereas the mesons , which generate the classical mean field , are characterized by corresponding covariant equations of motion .",
    "the presence of the hadronic medium modifies the masses and momenta of the hadrons , i.e. @xmath56 ( effective masses ) , @xmath57 ( kinetic momenta ) , where we have introduced the scalar and vector self - energies @xmath58 . for asymmetric matter",
    "the self - energies are different for protons and neutrons , depending on the isovector meson contributions .",
    "we will call the corresponding models as @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively , and just @xmath61 the case without isovector interactions .",
    "we will show also some results with density dependent couplings , in order to probe effects which go beyond the @xmath54 picture .",
    "for the more general @xmath60 case the self - energies of protons and neutrons read : @xmath62 ( upper signs for neutrons ) , where @xmath63 are the total and isospin scalar densities and currents and @xmath64 are the coupling constants of the various mesonic fields .",
    "@xmath65 is the solution of the non linear equation for the @xmath49 field @xcite .    for the description of heavy ion collisions we solve the covariant transport equation of the boltzmann type @xcite within the relativistic landau vlasov ( @xmath66 ) method , phase - space gaussian test particles @xcite , and applying a monte - carlo procedure for the hard hadron collisions .",
    "the collision term includes elastic and inelastic processes involving the production / absorption of the @xmath67 and @xmath68 resonances as well as their decays into pion channels , @xcite .",
    "a relativistic kinetic equation can be obtained from nucleon wigner function dynamics derived from the effective dirac equation @xcite .",
    "the neutron / proton wigner functions are expanded in terms of components with definite transformation properties .",
    "consistently with the effective fields included in our minimal model one can limit the expansion to scalar and vector parts @xmath69 we get after some algebra a transport equation of vlasov type for the scalar part @xmath70 ; @xmath71 { \\partial_\\mu}^{p^ * } \\ } f_i(x , p^{{*}\\mu})~=~0 , $ ] with the field tensors @xmath72 the trajectories of test particles obey to the following equation of motion : @xmath73    in order to have an idea of the dynamical effects of the covariant nature of the interacting fields , we write down , with some approximations , the `` force '' acting on a particle . since we are interested in isospin contributions we will take into account only the isovector part of the interaction @xcite : @xmath74 \\mp f_\\delta \\nabla \\rho_{s3 } \\nonumber \\\\ & \\approx &   \\pm f_{\\rho } \\frac{e^*_i}{m^*_i } \\vec\\nabla \\rho_{3 } \\mp f_\\delta \\vec\\nabla \\rho_{s3 } , ~~(p / n ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the lorentz force ( first term of eq.([force ] ) shows a @xmath75 boosting of the vector coupling , while from the second term we expect a @xmath5-quenched @xmath47 contribution .",
    "we remark that the lorentz - like force is absent in the non - relativistic vlasov transport equation discussed before .",
    "this nicely shows the qualitative different dynamics of a fully relativistic approach .",
    "you can not get it just inserting a relativistic kinematics in the classical transport equations .",
    "the flow observables can be seen respectively as the first and second coefficients of a fourier expansion of the azimuthal distribution @xcite : @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the transverse momentum and @xmath78 the rapidity along beam direction .",
    "the transverse flow can be also expressed as : @xmath79 .",
    "the sideward ( transverse ) flow is a deflection of forwards and backwards moving particles , within the reaction plane . the second coefficient of the expansion defines the elliptic flow given by @xmath80 .",
    "it measures the competition between in - plane and out - of - plane emissions .",
    "the sign of @xmath81 indicates the azimuthal anisotropy of emission : particles can be preferentially emitted either in the reaction plane ( @xmath82 ) or out - of - plane ( @xmath83 ) @xcite .",
    "the @xmath84-dependence of @xmath81 is very sensitive to the high density behavior of the @xmath43 since highly energetic particles ( @xmath85 ) originate from the initial compressed and out - of - equilibrium phase of the collision . for the isospin effects the neutron - proton @xmath86 flows",
    "@xmath87 have been suggested as very useful probes of the isovector part of the @xmath43 since they appear rather insensitive to the isoscalar potential and to the in medium nuclear cross sections , @xcite .    in heavy - ion collisions around @xmath88 with radioactive beams , due to the large counterstreaming nuclear currents",
    ", one may exploit the different lorentz nature of a scalar and a vector field , see the different @xmath5-boosting in the local force , eq.([force ] ) . in fig.[flows ] transverse and elliptic differential flows are shown for the @xmath89 reaction at @xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) , that likely could be studied with the new planned radioactive beam facilities at intermediate energies , @xcite .",
    "the effect of the different structure of the isovector channel is clear .",
    "particularly evident is the splitting in the high @xmath84 region of the elliptic flow . in the @xmath92 dynamics",
    "the high-@xmath84 neutrons show a much larger @xmath93 .",
    "this is fully consistent with an early emission ( more spectator shadowing ) due to the larger repulsive @xmath46-field .",
    "the @xmath81 observable , which is a good _ chronometer _ of the reaction dynamics , appears to be particularly sensitive to the lorentz structure of the effective interaction .",
    "we expect similar effects , even enhanced , from the measurements of differential flows for light isobars , like @xmath94 .",
    "particle production represent a useful tool to constrain the poorly known high density behaviour of the nuclear equation of state ( @xmath43 ) @xcite .",
    "in particular pion and ( subthreshold ) kaon productions have been extensively investigated leading to the conclusion of a soft behaviour of the @xmath43 at high densities , @xcite .",
    "kaons ( @xmath95 ) appear as particularly sensitive probes since they are produced in the high density phase almost without subsequent reabsorption effects @xcite . at variance ,",
    "antikaons ( @xmath96 ) are strongly coupled to the hadronic medium through strangeness exchange reactions @xcite . here",
    "we show that the isospin dependence of the @xmath97 production can be also used to probe the isovector part of the @xmath43 : we propose the @xmath2 yield ratio as a good observable to constrain the high density behavior of the symmetry energy , @xmath98 , @xcite .    using our @xmath54 transport model",
    "we analyze pion and kaon production in central @xmath99 collisions in the @xmath100 beam energy range , with different effective field choices for @xmath98 .",
    "we will compare results of three lagrangians with constant nucleon - meson couplings ( @xmath101 type , see before ) and one with density dependent couplings ( @xmath102 , see @xcite ) , recently suggested for better nucleonic properties of neutron stars @xcite . in the @xmath102 model",
    "the @xmath103 is exponentially decreasing with density , resulting in a rather `` soft '' symmetry term at high density . in order to isolate the sensitivity to the isovector components we use models showing the same `` soft '' @xmath43 for symmetric matter .",
    "pions are produced via the decay of the @xmath104 resonance and can contribute to the kaon yield through collisions with baryons : @xmath105 .",
    "all these processes are treated within a relativistic transport model including an hadron mean field propagation .",
    "the latter point , which goes beyond the `` collision cascade '' picture , is essential for particle production yields since it directly affects the energy balance of the inelastic channels .",
    "[ kaon1 ] reports the temporal evolution of @xmath106 resonances and pions ( @xmath107 ) and kaons ( @xmath108 ) for central au+au collisions at @xmath109 .",

    "it is clear that , while the pion yield freezes out at times of the order of @xmath112 , i.e. at the final stage of the reaction ( and at low densities ) , kaon production occur within the very early stage of the reaction , and the yield saturates at around @xmath113 .",
    "kaons are then suitable to probe the high density phase of nuclear matter . from fig .",
    "[ kaon1 ] we see that the pion results are weakly dependent on the isospin part of the nuclear mean field .",
    "however , a slight increase ( decrease ) in the @xmath114 ( @xmath115 ) multiplicity is observed when going from the @xmath61 ( or @xmath102 ) to the @xmath59 and then to the @xmath60 model , i.e. increasing the vector contribution @xmath116 in the isovector channel .",
    "this trend is more pronounced for kaons , see the right panel , due to the high density selection of the source and the proximity to the production threshold .",
    "the results for the @xmath102 model , density dependent couplings with a large @xmath103 decrease at high density , are fully consistent .",
    "they are always closer to the @xmath61 case ( without isovector interactions ) but the difference , still seen for @xmath117 , is completely disappearing for @xmath97 , selectively produced at high densities .    when isovector fields are included the symmetry potential energy in neutron - rich matter is repulsive for neutrons and attractive for protons . in a @xmath118",
    "this leads to a fast , pre - equilibrium , emission of neutrons .",
    "such a @xmath119 mechanism , often referred to as isospin fractionation @xcite , is responsible for a reduction of the neutron to proton ratio during the high density phase , with direct consequences on particle production in inelastic @xmath120 collisions .",
    "@xmath121 effects represent a more subtle point .",
    "the energy conservation in a hadron collision in general has to be formulated in terms of the canonical momenta , i.e. for a reaction @xmath122 as @xmath123 since hadrons are propagating with effective ( kinetic ) momenta and masses , an equivalent relation should be formulated starting from the effective in - medium quantities @xmath124 and @xmath125 , where @xmath126 and @xmath127 are the scalar and vector self - energies , eqs.([selfen ] ) . in reactions where nucleon resonances , especially the different isospin states of the @xmath128 resonance , and hyperons enter ,",
    "also their self energies are relevant for energy conservation .",
    "we specify them in the usual way according to the light quark content and with appropriate clebsch - gordon coefficients @xcite .",
    "the self - energy contribution to the energy conservation in inelastic channels will influence the particle production in two different ways . on one hand it will directly determine the thresholds and thus the multiplicities of a certain type of particles , in particular of the sub - threshold ones , as here for the kaons .",
    "secondly it will modify the phase space available in the final channel .",

    "@xmath133 collisions excite @xmath134 resonances which decay mainly to @xmath135 . in a neutron - rich matter",
    "the mean field effect pushes out neutrons making the matter more symmetric and thus decreasing the @xmath135 yield . the threshold effect on",
    "the other hand is increasing the rate of @xmath135 s due to the enhanced production of the @xmath136 resonances : now the @xmath137 process is favored ( with respect to @xmath138 ) since more effectively a neutron is converted into a proton .",
    "such interplay between the two mechanisms can not be fully included in a non - relativistic dynamics , in particular in calculations where the baryon symmetry potential is treated classically @xcite .    in",
    "the @xmath100 range the sensitivity is larger for the @xmath139 compared to the @xmath1 ratio , as we can see from fig.[kaon2 ] .",
    "this is due to the subthreshold production and to the fact that isospin effects enter twice in the two - steps production of kaons , @xcite . between the two extreme @xmath102 and @xmath60 isovector interaction models , the variations in the ratios",
    "are of the order of @xmath140 for kaons , while they reduce to about @xmath141 for pions .",
    "interestingly the iso-@xmath43 effect for pions is increasing at lower energies , when approaching the production threshold .",
    "we have to note that in a previous study of kaon production in excited nuclear matter the dependence of the @xmath139 yield ratio on the effective isovector interaction appears much larger ( see fig.8 of ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the point is that in the non - equilibrium case of a heavy ion collision the asymmetry of the source where kaons are produced is in fact reduced by the @xmath142 `` transformation '' , due to the favored @xmath137 processes .",
    "this effect is almost absent at equilibrium due to the inverse transitions , see fig.3 of ref.@xcite .",
    "moreover in infinite nuclear matter even the fast neutron emission is not present .",
    "this result clearly shows that chemical equilibrium models can lead to uncorrect results when used for transient states of an @xmath131 system . in the same fig .",

    "we get the @xmath162 surface which gives the phase coexistence region in the @xmath163 space @xcite . for a fixed value of the conserved charge @xmath164 , related to the proton fraction @xmath165",
    ", we will study the boundaries of the mixed phase region in the @xmath166 plane .",
    "we are particularly interested in the lower baryon density border , i.e. the critical / transition density @xmath167 , in order to check the possibility of reaching such @xmath168 conditions in a transient state during an @xmath118 at relativistic energies . in the hadronic phase the charge chemical potential is given by @xmath169 thus",
    ", we expect critical densities rather sensitive to the isovector channel in the hadronic @xmath43 .",
    "we compare the predictions on the transition to a deconfined phase of the two effective lagrangians @xmath170 and @xmath60 .",
    "the isoscalar part is very similar while the isovector @xmath43 is different , because in @xmath170 we only have the coupling to the vector @xmath46-field . in fig .",
    "[ rhodelta ] we show the crossing density @xmath167 separating nuclear matter from the quark - nucleon mixed phase , as a function of the proton fraction @xmath171 .",
    "we can see the effect of the @xmath47-coupling towards an @xmath172 crossing due to the larger symmetry repulsion at high baryon densities .",
    "the @xmath47-exchange potential provides an extra isospin repulsion of the hadron @xmath43 , and its effect shows up in a further reduction of the critical density .    -1.5",
    "cm    in the same figure we report the paths in the @xmath173 plane followed in the c.m .",
    "region during the collision of the n - rich @xmath174sn+@xmath174sn system , at different energies .",
    "we see that already at @xmath175 we are reaching the border of the mixed phase , and we are well inside it at @xmath109 .",
    "statistical fluctuations could help in reducing the density at which drops of quark matter form .",
    "the reason is that a small bubble can be energetically favored if it contains quarks whose z / a ratio is _ smaller _ than the average value of the surrounding region .",
    "this is again due to the strong z / a dependence of the free energy , which favors clusters having a small electric charge .",
    "these configurations can easily transform into a bubble of quarks having the same flavor content of the original hadrons , even if the density of the system is not large enough to allow deconfinement in the absence of statistical fluctuations .",
    "moreover , since fluctuations favor the formation of bubbles having a smaller z / a , neutron emission from the central collision area should be suppressed , what could give origin to specific signatures of the mechanism described in this paper .",
    "this corresponds to a _ neutron trapping _ effect , supported also by a symmetry energy difference in the two phases .",
    "in fact while in the hadron phase we have a large neutron potential repulsion ( in particular in the @xmath60 case ) , in the quark phase we only have the much smaller kinetic contribution .",
    "if in a pure hadronic phase neutrons are quickly emitted or `` transformed '' in protons by inelastic collisions , when the mixed phase starts forming , neutrons are kept in the interacting system up to the subsequent hadronization in the expansion stage @xcite .",
    "observables related to such neutron `` trapping '' could be an inversion in the trend of the formation of neutron rich fragments and/or of the @xmath1 , @xmath2 yield ratios for reaction products coming from high density regions , i.e. with large transverse momenta .",
    "in general we would expect a modification of the rapidity distribution of the emitted `` isospin '' , with an enhancement at mid - rapidity joint to large event by event fluctuations .",
    "a more detailed analysis is clearly needed .",
    "we have shown in few examples the richness of the physics we can describe using mean field transport equations , inspired by the pioneering works of david m. brink .",
    "we have seen that collisions of n - rich heavy ions from low to intermediate energies can bring new information on the isovector part of the in - medium interaction in different regions of high baryon densities , qualitatively different from equilibrium @xmath43 properties .",
    "we have presented quantitative results for charge equilibration in fusion / deep inelastic reactions , differential collective flows and yields of charged pion and kaon ratios .",
    "important non - equilibrium effects for particle production are stressed .",
    "finally our study supports the possibility of observing precursor signals of the phase transition to a mixed hadron - quark matter at high baryon density in the collision , central or semi - central , of neutron - rich heavy ions in the energy range of a few @xmath156 per nucleon . as signatures we suggest to look at observables particularly sensitive to the expected different isospin content of the two phases , which leads to a neutron trapping in the quark clusters .",
    "the isospin structure of hadrons produced at high transverse momentum should be a good indicator of the effect .",
    "i would like to warmly mention the great experience of collaborating with exceptional people on the topics and projects shortly discussed here .",
    "i will try to list some of them : v.baran , m.colonna , a.drago , t.gaitanos , v.greco , a.lavagno , b.liu , m.pfabe , h.h.wolter , s.yildirim and the essential young contributors l.bonanno , g.ferini , r.lionti , n.pellegriti , v.prassa , j.rizzo and e.santini .",

    "the main contribution to the kaon yield comes from the pionic channels , in particular from @xmath176 collisions , and from the @xmath177 channel , which together account for nearly @xmath178 of the total yield , see @xcite ."
