    "angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) of underdoped cuprates at temperatures exceeding conditional upper boundary @xmath1 of the pseudogap ( pg ) state evidences in favour to large simply connected fermi contour ( fc ) typical of the conventional fermi liquid .",
    "however , below @xmath1 , the fc is seen as transformed into disconnected arcs disposed in the nodal regions .",
    "cooling from @xmath1 down to superconducting ( sc ) transition temperature @xmath0 results in a decrease of arc length down to zero .",
    "thus , the fc degenerates into four points that give rise to the nodes of @xmath2  -  wave sc order parameter arising below @xmath0 .",
    "it seems fairly natural to conclude that , within the framework of @xmath2  -  wave pairing concept , the sc order parameter has its maximal value exactly in the antinodal directions.@xcite    for this reason , it might seem quite probable that low - temperature properties of @xmath2  -  wave superconductor should be determined by low - energy quasiparticle excitations only in the nodal region of the momentum space that is in vicinities of the sc gap nodes on the diagonals of the brillouin zone .",
    "taking into account that bogoliubov quasipatricle interference ( qpi ) , observed in the nodal region , disappears near the end points of the fc arcs,@xcite one might lead to a conclusion that only the nodal region gives rise to superconductivity whereas the gap observed in the antinodal region should be attributed to an incoherent pg state.@xcite however , a coherence in the antinodal region becomes apparent both in the arpes study @xcite and also in the andreev  ",
    "st  james experiments.@xcite therefore , in spite of the fact that high - energy qpi is not detected for the present , one can believe that the antinodal region should contribute a coherent state as well .",
    "we have argued@xcite that both pg and sc states arise exactly in the antinodal region with pronounced nesting of the fc as spatially inhomogeneous incoherent and coherent states of pairs with large momentum , respectively .",
    "the nodal region gives rise to conventional sc pairing with zero momentum which , together with the pairing with large momentum ( @xmath3-pairing ) in the antinodal region , forms a _ biordered _ sc state in the whole of the brillouin zone .",
    "kinematic constraint , inherent in @xmath3-pairing in the antinodal region , can result in oscillating real - space pairing interaction .",
    "indeed , momenta of both particles composing sc pair with nonzero total momentum @xmath3 should be either inside or outside of the fc .",
    "for this reason , a set of one - particle states turns out to be kinematically excluded because of the fact that such states can not contribute into the states of @xmath3-pairs .",
    "it means that any scattering between such excluded states should be forbidden when one defines the interaction leading to a rise of a bound state of @xmath3-pair .",
    "an exclusion of a set of the fourier components from the screened coulomb interaction results in the fact that corresponding real - space @xmath3-pairing interaction exhibits an oscillation outside of small - distance repulsive core as shown schematically in fig .",
    "it should be noted that there is an analogy between this oscillation and well - known friedel oscillation that arises owing to kohn singularity of screening enhanced by nesting of the fc .    besides the fact that two - particle problem with oscillating potential leads to a bound state of the relative motion of @xmath3-pair,@xcite it can also produce a quasi - stationary state ( qss)@xcite similar to the gamov s state of alpha - radioactive nucleus.@xcite sc gap function @xmath4 , depending on relative - motion momentum @xmath5 of @xmath3-pair , as a solution to the mean - field self - consistency equation , arises as a result of the instability of the ground state of the normal fermi liquid with respect to a rise of @xmath3-pairs in the bound state . this function can be expressed in terms of gorkov s anomalous averages describing sc condensate of @xmath3-pairs . due to a phase coherence of the sc ground state , these averages become nonzero below @xmath0 .",
    "qss with positive energy , following from the two - particle problem , can be considered as an evidence in favor to one more instability of the fermi liquid .",
    "we associate such an instability with incoherent @xmath3-pairs existing above @xmath0 .",
    "it means that gorkov s anomalous averages and corresponding gap function @xmath6 vanish under averaging over phases of @xmath3-pairs but mean square gap function remains nonzero up to @xmath7 according to the hypothesis advanced by emery and kivelson.@xcite     ( schematically ) .",
    "energies @xmath8 and @xmath9 correspond to bound and quasi - stationary states , respectively .",
    "barrier height @xmath10 corresponds to a break of the pair without tunnelling through the barrier . ]",
    "thus , one can conclude that , in the temperature range from @xmath1 down to @xmath0 , @xmath3-pairs form incoherent pg state as off - diagonal short - range order ( odsro ) . off - diagonal long - range order ( odlro )",
    "arises as sc condensate of coherent @xmath3-pairs below @xmath0 .",
    "both odlro and odsro states can be described in terms of gorkov s green functions.@xcite a phenomenological bcs - like form of the coherent contribution to the normal gorkov s function can be written as @xmath11,\\ ] ] where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are quasiparticle energy and coherence factors , respectively , @xmath14 is the kinetic energy of the @xmath3  -  pair of particles with momenta @xmath15 , @xmath16 is electron dispersion with respect to chemical potential @xmath17 and @xmath18 is quasiparticle weight .",
    "two terms in @xmath19 can be referred to @xmath3-pairs above and below the fc , respectively . diagonal green function @xmath19 describes odsro state corresponding to the existence of non - coherent qss of @xmath3  -  pairs above @xmath0 .",
    "transition from the bound paired state into long - living qss corresponds to small but finite decay @xmath20 whereas transitions into stationary states above barrier energy @xmath10 ( fig .",
    "1 ) should be associated with an infinitesimal decay , @xmath21 , leading to conventional fermi - liquid behavior of @xmath19 above @xmath7 .",
    "thus , a rise of qss results in a non - fermi - liquid behavior of @xmath19 ) that can be related to the pg state .",
    "the sc state below @xmath0 should be described by both normal and anomalous gorkov s functions .",
    "taking into account the fact that pg function @xmath6 , averaged over random phases , vanishes whereas @xmath22 below @xmath0 , one can introduce anomalous gorkov s function @xmath23 in a way we use to obtain @xmath19 : @xmath24    such an approach directly leads to uniform description of both sc and pg states in underdoped cuprates .",
    "one can see that repulsive coulomb pairing in the antinodal region necessarily results in rather complicated momentum dependence of the sc gap and pg functions , @xmath4 and @xmath6 , with energy scale @xmath25 of their domains of definition@xcite in contrast to considerably less scale of about debye energy @xmath26 that arises in the case of phonon - mediated sc pairing .",
    "it is very likely that the _ high energy problem_,@xcite arising , in particular , in the optical conductivity of the cuprates,@xcite might be associated with high energy scale of the antinodal @xmath3-pairing .",
    "we believe that @xmath3-pairs are the main players in the high - temperature superconductivity of the cuprates .",
    "recently , tsvelik and chubukov@xcite considered sc pairing on mutually orthogonal pairs of perfectly nested segments of the fc in semiphenomenological way .",
    "they presuppose that one - dimensional sc order arises only on these segments coupled with a momentum - space josephson links to give rise to two - dimensional superconductivity .",
    "actually , it is implicitly supposed that such sc state can arise owing to sc pairing with nonzero momentum .",
    "also , it is supposed that sc order with the same momentum is induced on the rest unnested part of the fc by the order on the nested segments due to a _ proximity effect in the momentum space_@xcite so that this induced order can not penetrate deep into the nodal region .",
    "it should be emphasize that such a model@xcite differs essentially from the biordered sc state.@xcite    in this paper , we study the mean - field @xmath3-pairing problem numerically to fall outside the weak coupling limits employed in our previous approach to the @xmath3-pairing problem.@xcite we show that the sc gap function with a nontrivial nodal line corresponds to a checkerboard _ pair density wave _",

    "we also show that @xmath3-pairing can originate spatial checkerboard pattern without any driving insulating order in contrast to a scenario of a rise of pdw coexisting with a charge density wave ( cdw).@xcite",

    ", it can be gapped only on those parts of the fc where @xmath37 proves to be small enough .",
    "in addition , the quasiparticle spectrum becomes asymmetrical with respect to @xmath17 .",

    "( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) should be performed over all momenta of the relative motion which can form pairs with given total momentum @xmath3 .",
    "one can see that these momenta belong to a @xmath3  -  dependent domain of the momentum space ( domain of _ kinematic constraint _ ) because of the fact that the momenta of both particles composing sc pair with given total momentum should be situated either inside or outside of the fc .",
    "this means that some part of the momentum space turns out to be excluded from the sums in eqs .",
    "( [ 1],[2 ] ) .",
    "since the kinetic energies of both particles composing sc pair with @xmath38 can be equal to @xmath17 , the low - energy limit in the sum ( [ 2 ] ) corresponds to @xmath39 whereas the upper limit is formally restricted by a half - width of the conduction band of the order of @xmath17 .",
    "however , in the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) theory,@xcite such upper limit ( debye phonon energy @xmath26 ) appears as an energy scale of a layer enveloping the fc where electron - electron scattering results in an effective attraction between electrons . as a result , pairing interaction energy @xmath29 in eq .",

    "all these speculations can be referred to the @xmath3  -  pairing problem . however , in such a case , the logarithmic singularity becomes apparent if and only if kinetic energy of @xmath3  -  pair vanishes not at isolated points , as it were most likely in the case of arbitrary fc , but on finite pieces of the fc on which _ mirror nesting _ condition , @xmath54 should be fulfilled at given @xmath3 .",
    "one can see that , for a suitable @xmath3 , this condition can be fulfilled in the case of rectilinear parallel segments on the opposite sides of the fc .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath3 should be directed along these segments .",

    "2 . then , with preassigned accuracy @xmath53 , @xmath64 if @xmath61 corresponds to near rectilinear segment of the fc",
    "therefore , the singular contribution into ( [ 2 ] ) turns out to be proportional to the length @xmath52 of such a segment .",
    "summation over the other component ( @xmath60 ) leads to an accumulation of the singularity , however , in contrast to the case @xmath38 , a gradual deviation from the fc results in a progressive increase of the difference between the kinetic energies of the particles composing @xmath3  -  pair .",
    "this leads to increasing deviation from mirror nesting condition ( [ 3 ] ) , so that , finally , the accumulation turns out to be completed when @xmath60 attains a value corresponding to energy scale @xmath65 much lesser than @xmath17 .",

    "5b ) . in the antinodal region",
    ", @xmath135 increases rapidly up to a maximum when @xmath133 .",
    "insulating order , which might be invoked to explain both @xmath136 and @xmath135 , is not discovered for now . we believe that a competition of such a hidden order@xcite with superconductivity is not the only qualitative explanation of observed spectral properties in the antinodal region .",
    "we have shown that @xmath3  -  pairing concept@xcite leads to a consistent explanation of the origin of the sc and pg states : @xmath3  -  pairing in the antinodal region gives rise to both these states .",
    "a decrease of @xmath136 at @xmath133 can be associated with non - trivial zero lines of the sc order parameter @xmath4 shown in fig .",
    "3 that is can be explained in just the same way as a decrease of @xmath136 at @xmath137 due to @xmath2-wave node .",
    "it is evident that such angle dependence of the spectral weight of the coherent peak , appearing in both nodal and antinodal regions owing to different microscopic mechanisms of sc pairing , can be considered as a direct indication of the biordered sc state . on the contrary , since the pg state is associated with qss wave function , one can expect that @xmath138 in the nodal region whereas nonzero @xmath135 in the antinodal one is compared with @xmath136 that appears there below @xmath0 .",
    "due to a random phase of the wave function of qss and corresponding gap function @xmath6 , nodal lines of these functions , that could be apparent in the antinodal region , can not give a detectable contribution into a decrease of the spectral weight at @xmath133 .",
    "expected angle dependencies of @xmath136 and @xmath135 are shown schematically in fig .",
    "5 .    we believe the antinodal region with pronounced nesting of the fc gives rise to @xmath3-pairing whereas conventional pairing with @xmath38 develops in the nodal region where the fc shows no signs of nesting .",
    "thus , we do not oppose @xmath3-pairing with the conventional pairing : these two sc pairing channels with slightly overlapped domains of definition in the momentum space form indivisible biordered sc state together .",
    "a passage from the antinodal region into the nodal one is accompanied with a redistribution of the spectral weight between these two pairing channels .",
    "a rise of the coherence in the system of the antinodal @xmath3-pairs below @xmath0 should inevitably lead to interference effects inherent in the sc state .",
    "bogoliubov qpi appears due to mixing of quasipatricle states with high spectral weight that results in a modulation of the local density of states ( ldos ) in the real space .",
    "such states , at given quasiparticle energy ( [ b ] ) , are disposed in vicinities of the points corresponding to maximal curvature of the isoline @xmath139 . in the case of biordered sc state , pairing with zero total momentum dominates @xmath3-pairing in the nodal region , therefore , @xmath140 in this region due to the fact that @xmath141 .",
    "thus , quasiparticle spectrum in the nodal region turns out to be fully symmetrical with respect to the fermi level .",
    "-wave order parameter ( @xmath142 ) and @xmath3-pairing order parameter , respectively .",
    "* b*. antinodal spectral weight of the pg state . here",
    ", @xmath143 is a conditional angle boundary separating the nodal and antinodal regions . ]    on the contrary , @xmath3-pairing dominates the pairing with zero momentum in the antinodal region including near rectilinear segments of the isolines in relatively small vicinity of the fc which primarily forms the singularity in the self - consistency equation . because @xmath144 in this vicinity , quasiparticle spectrum in the antinodal region should be slightly asymmetrical with respect to the fermi level . due to the fact that there is a considerable increase of the deviation from mirror nesting in a vicinity of conditional boundary separating nodal and antinodal regions , one can expect a pronounced increase of the asymmetry of quasiparticle spectrum in this vicinity .",
    "such a statement is compatible with photoemission data presented by yang et al.@xcite also , it shows that an insulating state , competing with the sc one , can not be considered as the only origin of the asymmetry observed by yang et al.@xcite indeed , quasiparticle spectrum in the case of insulating state with gap function @xmath145 has the form @xmath146 where @xmath147 , @xmath148 .",
    "therefore , imperfect nesting , that is a deviation from the nesting condition ( [ 6 ] ) , just as imperfect mirror nesting , results in the term ( @xmath149 or @xmath150 before the square root ) that originates electron - hole asymmetry in both cases .    to study antinodal quasiparticle spectrum qualitatively",
    ", one can neglect @xmath151 in eq .",
    "( [ a ] ) owing to the fact that antinodal segments of the fc appear as near rectilinear . for this reason , at low quasiparticle energies , isoline shape can be analyzed in general form .",
    "in such a case , isolines enclose the gapless points of intersection of the fc and the nodal line .",
    "these singular points can be found from equation system @xmath152 , @xmath153 .",
    "the nodal part of the fc can be approximated by an arc of a circle whereas the nodal lines of @xmath2  -  wave superconductor are straight lines @xmath154 . as a result ,",
    "the quasiparticle isolines become apparent as ` banana'-like closed curves.@xcite because fermi energy @xmath155 exceeds @xmath2  -  wave sc gap magnitude @xmath156 considerably , @xmath157 , ` banana ' turns out to be very thin so that exactly its end points correspond to maximal curvature of the isoline .",
    "this directly leads to the _ octet model _ of qpi in the nodal region,@xcite which defines a set of wave - vectors @xmath158 ( @xmath159 ) , corresponding to such end points , that determine ldos pattern at given quasiparticle energy @xmath160 . the octet model is presented in fig .",
    "5a where we define the main scattering momenta as @xmath161 .",
    "it should be noted that our definition of @xmath162 is somewhat different from that given by kohsaka et el.@xcite these two definitions are mutually complementary in the reciprocal lattice .        as one can see from fig",
    ".  3 , singular points of antinodal quasiparticle spectrum @xmath12 are symmetrically , with respect to the antinodal directions , disposed on near nested pieces of the fc . to study a shape of the isolines , one can approximate these pieces by straight lines and any of the nodal lines in a small vicinity of the singular point by an arc of a circle . evidently , under the condition that @xmath157 , all isolines in this vicinity are ` bananas ' enveloping a rectilinear part of the fc .",
    "indeed , if @xmath163 , an isoline of the the quasiparticle dispersion can be written in the form @xmath164 where @xmath165 , @xmath166 are dimensionless components of the relative motion momentum , @xmath167 is the fermi momentum in the antinodal direction , @xmath168 is dimensionless radius of the nodal line , @xmath169 , @xmath170 . as follows from eq .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) , there are closed isolines only under condition that @xmath171 .",
    "therefore , a transversal , with respect to the fc , size of the isoline equals @xmath172 .",
    "if @xmath173 , closed isolines shrink into two singular points ( @xmath174 ) .",
    "a longitudinal size can be estimated as @xmath175 , therefore , closed isolines appear in quasiparticle energy range @xmath176 .",
    "in addition , one can examine that @xmath177 .",
    "energy @xmath178 corresponds to a topological transition from closed , at @xmath179 , to opened , at @xmath180 , isolines .",
    "because opened isoline has no points of considerable curvature , the topological transition should result in a degradation of the interference pattern .",
    "contrariwise , due to a large curvature of the closed isoline in small vicinities of its end points , exactly these vicinities should primarily contribute into the qpi .",
    "therefore , following mcelroy et al.,@xcite one can introduce a set of momenta @xmath181 connecting different end points .",
    "here , subscript @xmath182 runs from @xmath183 to @xmath184 where @xmath185 is a number of singular points of quasiparticle dispersion ( [ a ] ) .",
    "such main scattering momenta , defined as @xmath186 for any @xmath187 , should determine the real - space interference pattern .",
    "the pattern caused by the antinodal qpi turns out to be considerably more complicated in comparison with the nodal one even in the simplest case corresponding to the only closed nodal line in each of four crystal equivalent parts of the antinodal region as shown in fig .",
    "the full set of momenta @xmath162 , following from non - trivial momentum dependence of the gap function shown in fig .",
    "3 , should result in the real - space antinodal qpi pattern that can be considered as originating from fairly uniform distribution of scattering momenta .",
    "therefore , it seems highly probable that the antinodal qpi pattern should be considerably more smooth with respect to the nodal one .",
    "it is clear that due to expansion of the closed isolines @xmath188 with an increase of @xmath160 , there is a variation ( rotation and decrease or increase of the absolute value ) of the main scattering momenta , @xmath189 with @xmath160 .",
    "all of the nodal scattering momenta are dispersive , varying with @xmath160 in accordance with the octet model.@xcite on the contrary , among the antinodal scattering momenta , there are some non - dispersive , such as `` immobile '' @xmath190 and @xmath191 shown in fig .",
    "6b , that , owing to nesting feature of the fc , remain independent of @xmath160 at small quasiparticle energies .",
    "strictly speaking , only such `` immobile '' @xmath162 can contribute into checkerboard real - space modulation in the sc state.@xcite    nodes of the antinodal quasiparticle spectrum result in the fact that , at a finite temperature , thermal equilibrium quasiparticles are excited not only near @xmath2  -  wave nodes in the nodal region@xcite but in the antinodal one as well .",
    "moreover , the equilibrium population of the antinodal quasiparticles may considerably exceed their population in vicinities of the @xmath2  -  wave nodes .",
    "this may occur if line of zeroes of the antinodal gap function , in contrast to the nodal one , turns out to be close to the fc in its extended vicinity .",
    "our concept of @xmath3-pairing in the cuprates is based on two complementary statements : @xmath192 screened coulomb repulsion is the underlying sc pairing interaction ; @xmath193 large momentum of @xmath3-pair arises due to nesting feature of the fc .",
    "sc @xmath3-pairing , prevailing in the antinodal region of the momentum space , leads directly to uniform explanation of spatial inhomogeneity of both sc state in the form of checkerboard pdw and striped pg state formed by incoherent @xmath3-pairs .",
    "@xmath3-pairing , together with the conventional sc pairing with zero momentum prevailing in the nodal region , results in an indivisible biordered sc state which naturally explains the peculiarities of the angle dependence of the spectral weight both below and above @xmath0 .",
    "complicated momentum dependence of the gap function in the antinodal region should lead to fairly reach antinodal qpi resulting in relatively smooth real - space interference pattern .",
