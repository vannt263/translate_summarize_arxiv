    "a central goal of spin - transport electronics ( or spintronics ) is the ability to switch current between spin - selective electrodes by means of spin precession @xcite . in the original datta - das proposal for such a spin - based transistor @xcite , the current which is switched carries both spin and charge .",
    "it has proven difficult to separate the effects of spin precession from purely orbital effects ( deflection of electron trajectories ) , so most succesful implementations use a nonlocal geometry @xcite to modulate the spin current at zero charge current @xcite . even in the absence of an orbital effect",
    ", the fact that different electrons ( moving along different trajectories ) experience different amounts of spin precession prevents a complete switching of the current from one electrode to the other .",
    "if the electron motion could somehow be confined to a single spatial dimension , it would be easier to isolate spin effects from orbital effects and to ensure that all electron spins precess by the same amount .",
    "complete switching of the current would then be possible , limited only by spin relaxation processes .",
    "edge state transport in the quantum hall effect is one - dimensional and spin selective ( in sufficiently strong perpendicular magnetic fields @xmath0 ) , but spin precession plays no role in the traditional experiments on a two - dimensional electron gas @xcite . in this paper",
    "we show how the quantum hall effect in an inverted - gap semiconductor offers the unique possibility to perform a one - dimensional spin precession experiment .",
    "top panel : schematic illustration of the one - dimensional pathway along which the electron spin is injected , precessed , and detected ( filled circles : occupied states ; open circles : empty states ) .",
    "bottom panel : potential profile of the _ p - n _ junction , shown for @xmath1 ( for @xmath2 the labels @xmath3 and @xmath4 should be interchanged ) . ]",
    "the key idea is to combine the spin - selectivity of edge states with free precession along a _",
    "p - n _ interface .",
    "the geometry , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_geometry ] , has been studied in graphene @xcite  but there spin is only weakly coupled to the orbit and plays a minor role @xcite .",
    "the strong spin - orbit coupling in inverted - gap semiconductors splits the first landau level into a pair of levels @xmath5 of opposite magnetic moment @xcite .",
    "one level @xmath3 ( say , with spin up ) has electron - like character and produces edge states in the conduction band . the other level @xmath4 ( with spin down ) has hole - like character and produces edge states in the valence band .",
    "the edge states from @xmath3 and @xmath4 have opposite chirality , meaning that one circulates clockwise along the edge while the other circulates counter - clockwise .",
    "these spin - selective , chiral edge states provide the spin injection at @xmath6 and detection at @xmath7 .    for the spin precession we need to combine states from @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "this is achieved by means of a gate electrode , which creates a smooth potential step ( height @xmath8 , width @xmath9 ) centered at @xmath10 , such that the fermi level lies in the conduction band for @xmath11 ( _ n_-doped region ) and in the valence band for @xmath12 ( _ p_-doped region ) . at the _ p - n _ interface states from the first landau levels @xmath3 and @xmath4 overlap at the fermi energy @xmath13 , to form a spin - degenerate one - dimensional state .",
    "spin precession can be realized externally by a parallel magnetic field @xmath14 ( in the @xmath15 plane ) or internally by bulk or structure inversion asymmetry @xcite .",
    "good overlap at @xmath13 of the states from @xmath3 and @xmath4 is crucial for effective spin precession .",
    "the requirement is that the spatial separation @xmath16 of the states should be small compared to the magnetic length @xmath17 ( which sets their spatial extent ) .",
    "this is where the inverted gap comes in , as we now explain .",
    "inversion of the gap means that the first landau level in the conduction band goes down in energy with increasing magnetic field ( because it has hole - like character ) , while the first landau level in the valence band goes up in energy ( because it has electron - like character ) . as a consequence",
    ", the gap @xmath18 has a minimal value @xmath19 much less than the cyclotron energy @xmath20 at a crossover magnetic field @xmath21 . indeed , @xmath22 in the absence of inversion asymmetry @xcite .",
    "good overlap can therefore be reached in an inverted - gap semiconductor , simply by tuning the magnetic field . in a normal ( non - inverted ) semiconductor , such as gaas",
    ", the cyclotron energy difference between @xmath3 and @xmath4 effectively prevents the overlap of landau levels from conduction and valence bands .    in the following two sections",
    ", we first present a general , model independent analysis and then specialize to the case of a hgte quantum well ( where we test the analytical theory by computer simulation ) .",
