    "we start detailing our construction for @xmath25 and then extend it to arbitrary @xmath2 by induction . given an operator @xmath26 ( @xmath27 a basis ) , we can define a state @xmath28 .",
    "it can be used @xcite for the following identity@xmath29 where @xmath30 indicates the transpose in the @xmath31 basis . consider the quantum metrology protocol ( fig .",
    "[ f : qmet]c ) for @xmath25 , and apply this identity twice : @xmath32 where @xmath33 , and we consider the general case where @xmath0 and @xmath34 may differ .",
    "choose @xmath31 as the eigenbasis of @xmath4 , so @xmath3 is diagonal , and @xmath35 .",
    "moreover , we can exploit the entanglement of @xmath36 to measure the second system in the @xmath37 basis ( we consider only the subspace spanned by @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) and project the first system in the same state , since @xmath38 .",
    "this means that after the measurement , the evolution in eq .   can be written as @xmath39 , where the initial state is @xmath7 or @xmath8 with probability 1/2 , depending on the measurement outcome .",
    "this argument shows how the parallel entangled strategy @xmath40 can be reduced to the sequential one @xmath41 for @xmath25 , see fig .",
    "[ f : ff ] .",
    ".    why is entanglement necessary ?",
    "we must require that perfect correlation is present in two complementary basis , the @xmath42 basis ( to ensure that @xmath1 is diagonal ) and the @xmath43 basis ( to ensure that the measurement on one probe projects the other in an appropriate initial state ) .",
    "an intuitive definition of entanglement is `` correlation on a property that does not ( can not ) yet exist '' , namely , a perfect correlation on complementary properties such as the two bases above .",
    "in fact , suppose we request that there is correlation only on the @xmath42 basis using the mixed state @xmath44 ) , that can be written as an equally weighted mixture of @xmath33 and @xmath45 , each with probability 1/2 .",
    "we can use the construction of eq .   obtaining a final state of the two probes given by @xmath46 or",
    "@xmath47 each with probability 1/2 .",
    "after the projection of the second probe into the @xmath43 basis , these become an equally weighted mixture of @xmath48 and @xmath49 , namely the state @xmath50 , independent of @xmath0 . in contrast , suppose we request correlation only on the @xmath43 basis using the state @xmath51 , namely an equally weighted mixture of @xmath52 and @xmath53 ( where @xmath54 in the @xmath42 basis ) .",
    "again using eq .",
    ", this is equivalent to having a final state of the two probes as @xmath55 or @xmath56 each with probability 1/2 , which , after the projection , become an equally weighted mixture of the four states @xmath48 and @xmath57 , again @xmath50 independent of @xmath0 .",
    "[ here the sql is recovered if one does not average over the projective - measurement result : that procedure is equivalent to the classical parallel strategy of fig .",
    "[ f : qmet]b . ]",
    "we have shown that for @xmath25 we can easily convert a parallel entangled strategy into a sequential one , proving that the two have the same estimation precision .",
    "we now extend this to arbitrary @xmath2 by induction : suppose ( induction hypothesis ) that the parallel entangled strategy @xmath58 has the same estimation precision as the sequential strategy @xmath59 , we need to prove that the same applies for @xmath60 . we can write @xmath61 where @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 since @xmath65 s are diagonal in the @xmath42 basis .",
    "it follows that the subspace spanned by @xmath62 and @xmath63 is invariant for application of @xmath66 , which , when restricted to such subspace , can be expressed as the @xmath67 matrix @xmath68 restricting ourselves to such invariant subspace , we can use the induction hypothesis to conclude that the last line of will have the same estimation precision as @xmath69 .",
    "[ note that in this proof it is not necessary to require that the matrix @xmath66 is diagonal , but only that it is invariant for the @xmath70 , @xmath71 subspace : an anti - diagonal tensor product would work . ]",
    "we now explore some of the consequences that can be derived from our argument .",
    "( a )  useful entanglement : up to now we have used as entangled initial state the ghz , @xmath72 , as it optimizes the quantum cramer - rao bound .",
    "our construction shows that entanglement of the type @xmath73 ( with real @xmath74 ) is the only useful one ( with the appropriate amendments when probes are indistinguishable , see below ) .",
    "in fact , suppose we use an arbitrary entangled state @xmath75 in eq .  , it becomes @xmath76 , where we want the right hand term to correspond to a sequential strategy @xmath77 ( the sequential strategy works iff the initial state is of the form @xmath78 even though for simplicity we considered only the cases @xmath43 above ) .",
    "namely , we require that @xmath79 , which implies that @xmath80 , since @xmath4 is diagonal in the @xmath42 basis .",
    "namely , we need a state @xmath81 . this argument , and the fact that achieving the quantum cramer - rao bound requires a superposition of global maximum and minimum eigenstates @xcite",
    ", shows that quantum metrology _ requires _ entanglement of the form @xmath82 .",
    "( b )  noise resilience : using our framework , we can detail a class of noise that is simple to handle ( in general , the treatment of quantum metrology in the presence of noise is highly nontrivial @xcite ) .",
    "consider the entangled parallel strategy for @xmath25 and suppose that the two probes are subject to arbitrary noise maps described by kraus operators @xmath83 and @xmath84 respectively .",
    "we can still convert a parallel strategy into a sequential one along the lines of eq .   as @xmath85 i.e.  a noise map only on the first probe if @xmath86 ( a unital map , as when @xmath87 , the pauli matrices ) , since then @xmath88 , with @xmath89 .",
    "so the first step of the induction can be applied also to unital maps in addition to the unitaries we discussed above",
    ". however , the extension to @xmath90 fails in general , as there is typically no invariant subspace to construct a reduced map as the one in : one must require that @xmath91 is a diagonal or an anti - diagonal matrix for all @xmath92 .",
    "an example of the latter is the bit flip with phase noise where the kraus operators are @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "an example of the former ( in addition to the noiseless case ) is phase flip noise ( dephasing ) with kraus operators @xmath95 and @xmath96 , which was already identified in @xcite as a noise model whose parallel and sequential performance match .",
    "it was known for a long time @xcite that an arbitrary small amount of dephasing would ruin any advantage for frequency measurement @xcite whereas the same identical noise does not affect phase estimation as much @xcite .",
    "our construction explains this curious performance : since the entangled parallel strategy is ( for this noise model ) equivalent to the sequential one , it means that the entangled strategy s performance is equivalent to one that takes @xmath2 time as long : namely , its noise sensitivity is @xmath2 times faster @xcite . while this is not a problem for estimating a phase ( which can be done in arbitrarily short time ) , it is a problem for estimating frequency which requires a measurement duration that voids any advantage from entanglement @xcite .",
    "the calculation of the quantum cramer - rao bound for frequency - estimation on a single qubit subject to dephasing ( the optimal sequential strategy ) is given in ref .",
    "@xcite , whence one can see it matches with the optimal entangled strategy ( although that was not observed there ) .",
    "our construction thus identifies some noise models whose effect is equivalent for the sequential and parallel strategies : the unital maps ( in the @xmath5 , @xmath6 invariant subspace ) where all kraus operators are either diagonal or anti - diagonal , as the examples above .",
    "it is then simple using our construction to find the states that optimize the precision in the presence of these classes of noise .",
    "( c )  indistinguishable probes : the above discussion focused on the case of distinguishable probes , where a tensor product structure ( tps ) is clear : each probe is a system with its own hilbert space . if the probes are indistinguishable particles ( e.g.  in optical interferometry , where typically one considers single - photon probes ) , such structure is absent , and one typically resorts to the fock space that enforces the symmetry properties required ( symmetry for exchange of bosons and anti - symmetry for exchange of fermions ) . in the absence of a tps , the very concept of entanglement is ill defined @xcite , and it is known that entanglement is not necessary to beat the sql in interferometry . for example , the unentangled `` n0 '' state @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is a fock state of @xmath2 photons and @xmath99 is the vacuum state ( we restrict ourselves to a finite - dimensional subspace of the radiation hilbert space ) can achieve a phase sensitivity beyond the sql : its evolution through @xmath100 ( @xmath101 being the annihilation operator of the mode ) yields @xmath102 , as in the sequential or entangled strategies of figs .",
    "[ f : qmet]a , c .",
    "because such a state can not be attained in the presence of super - selection rules @xcite and it only samples an absolute phase , in quantum - enhanced interferometry one typically considers the two mode `` n00n '' state @xcite @xmath103 , which samples a relative phase between the two modes @xmath104 of the interferometer through the evolution @xmath105 . while clearly @xmath103 has mode entanglement , the state @xmath97 has no entanglement .",
    "yet , they can both be easily cast in the framework we have used up to now , by recalling that for boson probes , one needs to consider only the subspace of the global hilbert space that is symmetric for exchange of the probes , which can be done by moving to the fock space @xcite : in each mode we have that the tensor product of minimum and maximum eigenstates @xmath106 and @xmath107 is symmetrized as @xmath99 and @xmath98 , respectively .",
    "analogously , in the two mode case , the symmetrized minimum and maximum eigenstates for the two - mode hamiltonian @xmath108 restricted to the @xmath2-photon subspace is @xmath109 and @xmath110 , respectively ( the symmetrization must be performed in each mode separately , since photons in different modes are distinguishable ) .",
    "it is hence clear that n00n state interferometry falls within the framework described here . in particular",
    ", our construction shows that n00n state interferometry is indeed equivalent to multipass interferometry , as was pointed out previously @xcite . the same trick of considering the ( anti - symmetric ) fock space",
    "can also be applied to the fermionic case , although the pauli exclusion principle makes fermionic probes unattractive .",
    "[ one may wonder whether the conventional theory of distinguishable probes is ever applicable , since clearly all probes will be ultimately be composed of indistinguishable particles .",
    "we remind that indistinguishable particles are subject to specific symmetries only regarding their global state .",
    "typically one uses only certain degrees of freedom of the probe system for measurement purposes and the remaining degrees of freedom ( spin , position , etc . ) can be used to enforce the required symmetry . ]",
    "( d )  extension of quantum metrology : conventionally , in quantum metrology the transformation that acts on the probes takes the form @xmath3 .",
    "our construction makes it easy to generalize this to a more general @xmath111 , where @xmath112 and @xmath113 are unitaries independent of @xmath0 . in this case",
    "the sequential strategy can not be a simple iteration of @xmath114 , as that will not typically increase the parameter @xmath0 by @xmath2 times ( e.g. , when @xmath115 , @xmath116 we find that @xmath117 ) , but @xmath118 .",
    "this suggests that a generalized entangled parallel strategy consists in the evolution @xmath119 , which corresponds to the sequential strategy @xmath120 .",
    "is our framework general ?",
    "the only hypothesis made so far is that there exists eigenvectors @xmath5 and @xmath6 for @xmath4 connected to the maximum and minimum eigenvalues .",
    "this requirement , certainly true in finite - dimensional hilbert spaces , implies that the states @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( for the sequential strategy ) and the ghz state @xmath121 ( for the parallel strategy ) are ones with maximum spread @xmath122 , that saturate the quantum cramer - rao bound @xcite .",
    "our framework is thus general for finite - dimensional systems , and allows one to construct new quantum metrology protocols @xcite : all that is needed is a ghz - type state with a superposition of maximum and minimum eigenstates of @xmath4 to achieve a quantum metrology protocol to estimate the parameter @xmath0 of which @xmath4 is the generator of translations .",
    "( e )  the non - asymptotic case : all results given up to now ( and most of the literature ) refer to the asymptotic case where the number of repetitions @xmath123 .",
    "however , thanks to our construction , it is possible to adapt the non - asymptotic results @xcite obtained for the sequential estimation ( by adapting the kitaev phase - estimation algorithms ) also to parallel entangled strategies .",
    "this equivalence was already pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite : all these strategies employ multiple rounds of sequential iterations or , equivalently , multiple rounds of n00n states with different @xmath2 .",
    "a completely different strategy is given in @xcite .",
    "( f )  bandwidth - noise tradeoff : our construction clarifies that the true power of entanglement in quantum metrology is in allowing one to achieve the same @xmath124 precision enhancement of the sequential strategy , while keeping the same @xmath2-fold sampling - time gain of the parallel strategy over the sequential one @xcite : high precision in short time .",
    "we presented a simple construction that shows why entanglement is necessary in quantum metrology : to transform a parallel strategy into a sequential one , we need perfect correlation in complementary bases : both in the eigenbasis @xmath42 of the generator @xmath4 and in its complementary @xmath43 basis .",
    "such correlation requires entanglement .",
    "we also presented some applications : our construction easily derives some new and some known results in quantum metrology .",
