    "over the last decade , growing astrophysical interest has been attracted by axion - like - particles ( alps )  @xcite .",
    "they are very light pseudo - scalar bosons @xmath5 characterized by a two - photon coupling @xmath6 , which are a generic prediction of several extensions of the standard model ( sm ) such as four - dimensional ordinary and supersymmetric models  @xcite , kaluza - klein theories  @xcite and especially superstring theories  @xcite ( for a review , see  @xcite ) . in the presence of an external magnetic field , the @xmath6 coupling produces a mismatch between the interaction eigenstates and the propagation eigenstates , thereby giving rise to the phenomena of single photon - alp conversion @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) and double photon - alp conversion @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) , the latter being a photon - alp oscillation , quite similar to the oscillation involving two massive neutrinos of different flavour ( apart from the fact that the external field is needed to compensate for the photon and alp spin difference )  @xcite .",
    "as far as astrophysics is concerned , their most striking feature is to drastically alter photon propagation over cosmic distances and at very high energies ( vhes ) , namely for @xmath11 . as a consequence , blazars are the natural astronomical sources to look for photon - alp conversion effects , even because the currently operating imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes ( iacts ) like h.e.s.s .",
    "@xcite , magic  @xcite and veritas  @xcite provide excellent data in the vhe range up to @xmath12 and the planned detectors like cta  @xcite , hawc  @xcite and hiscore  @xcite will be able to explore the vhe range up to @xmath13 with much better sensitivity ( hiscore is supposed to reach pev energies ) .",
    "it goes without saying that various scenarios have been proposed .",
    "a possibility is that a single photon - alp conversion @xmath7 occurs either inside the blazar  @xcite or in extragalactic space  @xcite where a large - scale magnetic field in the ng range is supposed to exist , which is consistent with presently available upper bounds  @xcite and auger results  @xcite . in either case , the result is a dimming of the source above a characteristic energy @xmath14 which depends on the model parameters , and so it shows up as a feature somewhere in the observed @xmath1-ray spectrum . a different option",
    " called darma scenario ( achronym of de angelis , roncadelli and mansutti )  contemplates photon - alp oscillations @xmath9 as taking place in extragalactic space  @xcite provided that a large - scale magnetic field in the ng range is present .",
    "alternatively , the conversion @xmath7 can occur within the blazar whereas the re - conversion @xmath8 is supposed to happen in the milky - way  @xcite .",
    "needless to say , also both cases can be realized at once  @xcite .",
    "actually , photon - alp oscillations are particularly intriguing in view of our later considerations , since what we are used to simply regard as a _ photon",
    "_ behaves for some time as a `` true photon '' and for some time as an alp .",
    "now , `` true photons '' can disappear from the beam along their way to us through the @xmath15 scattering  @xcite with low - energy infrared / optical / ultraviolet photons of the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) , namely the diffuse radiation produced by stars during the whole cosmic evolution ( for a review , see  @xcite ) .",
    "yet , alps propagate totally unaffected by the ebl , since the process @xmath16 is kinematically forbidden and the @xmath17 scattering has a ridiculously small cross - section . as a consequence , owing to photon - alp oscillations",
    "the effective photon optical depth @xmath18 gets smaller  @xcite , and even a tiny decrease entails a large enhancement of the photon survival probability @xmath19 as compared with conventional physics since the two quantities are related by @xmath20 in addition , because the ebl dimming increases with @xmath21 ( see e.g. fig . [ fig : france ] ) whereas the photon - alp oscillations alone are @xmath21-independent , the resulting observed blazar spectra become harder than expected and in particular the  @xmath1-ray horizon \" gets considerably enlarged ( a very thorough analysis of this point is contained in  @xcite ) . to date no clear - cut evidence for alps exists but some suggestions pointing toward their existence",
    "have been put forward in  @xcite and especially in  @xcite , although other ( more conventional ) astrophysical solutions have been proposed  @xcite .",
    "coming back to blazars , they dominate the extragalactic @xmath1-ray sky , both at high energy ( @xmath22 mev ) and at vhe .",
    "their powerful non - thermal emission , spanning the entire electromagnetic spectrum , is produced in a relativistic jet pointing toward the earth .",
    "their spectral energy distribution ( sed ) shows two well defined `` humps '' .",
    "the first one  peaking somewhere between the ir and the x - ray bands  derives from the synchrotron emission of relativistic electrons ( or , more generally , e@xmath23 pairs ) in the jet .",
    "the origin of the second component which exhibits a maximum at @xmath1-ray energies is more debated .",
    "leptonic models  @xcite attribute it to the inverse compton emission of the same electrons responsible for the lower energy bump ( with the possible additional contribution from external photons ) .",
    "hadronic models ( for a review , see  @xcite ) , instead , assume that the @xmath1 rays are the leftover of reactions involving relativistic hadrons .",
    "blazars are further divided into two broad groups , bl lac objects and flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs )  @xcite .",
    "bl lacs are defined by the weakness ( or even absence ) of thermal features ( most notably broad emission lines ) in their optical spectra .",
    "this evidence leads to the common belief that the nuclear region of bl lacs , where the jet forms and accelerates , is rather poor of soft photons . on the contrary ,",
    "fsrqs display luminous broad ( @xmath24 km s@xmath25 ) emission lines , indicating the existence of photo - ionized clouds rapidly rotating around the central black hole and organized in the so - called broad line region ( blr ) ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "besides their importance for the study of the structure and functioning of relativistic jets , growing interest for blazars is motivated by the use of their intense @xmath1-ray beam as a probe of the ebl ( see e.g.  @xcite ) and of the large - scale magnetic fields ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , and even more fundamentally for the study of new physical phenomena beyond the sm  like indeed alps  along with",
    "quite radical departures from conventional physics such as violation of lorentz invariance ( for a review , see  @xcite ) .",
    "as far as blazar observations are concerned , the recent evidence of vhe emission by fsrqs poses a quite serious challenge . as stressed above",
    ", the surrounding of the inner jet in fsrqs is rich of optical / ultraviolet photons emitted by the blr , necessarily implying a huge optical depth for @xmath1 rays above 10  20 gev ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the observation of some fsrqs at tev energies raised great surprise  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the detection of an intense vhe emission from pks 1222 + 216 at redshift @xmath26 in the energy range 70  400 gev  @xcite observed by magic to double its flux in only about 10 minutes  thereby flagging the extreme compactness of the emitting region  is very difficult to fit within the standard blazar models  @xcite .",
    "so far , the only possibility to solve the apparent contradiction with conventional expectations arising from both the detection of the intense and relatively hard vhe flux and the rapid variation appears to invoke the existence of very small ( @xmath27 cm ) emitting regions ( or beams of particles ) beyond the blr ( @xmath28 cm ) , that is at a large distance from the central engine  @xcite .",
    "an additional question is that pks 1222 + 216 has also been simultaneously detected by _",
    "fermi_/lat in the energy range @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "so , one would like not only to understand why the vhe @xmath1 rays are actually _ emitted _ by pks 1222 + 216 but also to find a _ realistc and physically motivated _ sed that fits _ both _ the observed _ fermi_/lat and the magic spectra , which is a logically distinct and more ambitious task .    our proposal to naturally explain all observations assumes the validity of a standard blazar model for photon production , but we add the new assumption that photon - alp oscillations take place inside the source in such a way that a considerable fraction of vhe photons can leave it , indeed much in the same fashion that a sizable amount of vhe photons emitted by blazars largely avoid ebl absorption if extragalactic space is permeated by a large - scale magnetic field in the ng range .",
    "more specifically , we envisage that the @xmath7 conversion occurs before most of the vhe photons reach the blr .",
    "accordingly , alps traverse this region unimpeded and outside it the re - conversion @xmath8 takes place either in the same magnetic field of the source or in that of the host galaxy .",
    "thus , our proposal differs from any previously considered one .",
    "moreover , we find that for observationally allowed values of the parameters of our model the resulting sed looks quite realistic and nicely fits the _ fermi_/lat and magic spectra observed at the same time .",
    "our aim is to carry out an investigation of the proposed scenario .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "the mechanism of photon - alp oscillations is reviewed in general terms in section ii .",
    "our model for pks 1222 + 216 is described in section iii and its results are presented in section iv . in section",
    "v we provide a specific picture which gives rise to the required sed , structurally similar to the model developed in  @xcite but with an important difference . finally , in section vi we draw our conclusions , comparing our proposal to others recently put forward , stressing the possibility of an astrophysical check of our model and emphasizing that an alp having precisely the right properties needed for our scenario to work will be searched for in the near future in two distinct laboratory experiments",
    "as we said , a generic feature of several extensions of the sm is the prediction of axion - like particles ( alps ) .",
    "as the name indeed suggests , they are a generalization of the axion ( for a review , see  @xcite )  the pseudo - goldstone boson arising from the breakdown of the global peccei - quinn symmetry @xmath29 proposed as a natural solution to the strong cp problem  but important differences exist between the axion and alps due to the fact that the axion arises within a very specific framework whereas in dealing with alps the aim is to bring out their properties as much as possible in a model - independent manner  @xcite .",
    "because of this different attitude , two main differences come about .",
    "one is that only the alp - photon interaction is taken into account , which is described by the lagrangian @xmath30 .",
    "here @xmath31 is the usual alp lagrangian , where @xmath32 is the alp mass and @xmath33 is a constant with the dimension of an energy , while @xmath34\\ ] ] is the heisenberg - euler - weisskopf ( hew ) effective lagrangian accounting for the photon one - loop vacuum polarization in the presence of an external magnetic field ( @xmath35 is the fine - structure constant and @xmath36 is the electron mass )  @xcite",
    ". often @xmath37 is discarded , but we will see that the inclusion of @xmath37 is essential in our analysis .",
    "the other difference is that  at variance with the case of the axion  the parameters @xmath32 and @xmath33 are supposed to be _ uncorrelated _ , and it is merely supposed that @xmath38 and @xmath39 with @xmath40 denoting the fermi scale . in this section",
    "we use natural units with @xmath41 .",
    "astrophysics provides the strongest bounds on the parameters entering @xmath42 .",
    "the cast experiment at cern  @xcite sets the quite robust bound @xmath43 for @xmath44 in agreement with theoretical bounds from stellar evolution  @xcite , while from the absence of @xmath1 rays coming from sn 1987a the stronger bound @xmath45 has been derived for @xmath46 which is however affected by a large uncertainty  @xcite .",
    "actually , the latter bound has been strongly criticized by other authors  @xcite , who pointed out additional substantial uncertainties due to the fact that both the flux of alps produced in the supernova explosion and their reconversion into photons can vary by large factors , thereby implying that a small violation of such a bound should not be regarded as a flaw of a considered model .",
    "finally , very light alps  which we will see to be our case  can not be the galactic dark matter  @xcite , and so the results of the admx experiment  @xcite are presently irrelevant .",
    "we consider throughout this paper a monochromatic photon beam of vhe @xmath21 propagating along the @xmath47 direction from the centre of the source to us in a generic ionized and magnetized medium where photons can be absorbed but alps can not .",
    "below , we describe the mechanism whereby photon - alp oscillations occur in the beam ( a more detailed account can be found in  @xcite ) .    manifestly the last term in eq .",
    "( [ t1 ] ) gives rise to the @xmath6 coupling mentioned above .",
    "note that because of the specific form of this coupling @xmath48 only the component of @xmath49 in the @xmath50 plane @xmath51 couples to @xmath5 , and in addition all physical results depend only on the combination @xmath52 to the extent that @xmath37 can be neglected .",
    "clearly here @xmath49 is the external magnetic field while @xmath53 is the electric field of a propagating photon .",
    "the first point that deserves concern is that in the approximation @xmath54 which is obviously valid here the beam propagation equation becomes  @xcite @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the two photon linear polarization amplitudes along the @xmath58 and @xmath59 axis , respectively , @xmath60 denotes the alp amplitude and @xmath61 represents the photon - alp mixing matrix .",
    "a very remarkable fact is that eq .",
    "( [ t2 ] ) is a schrdinger - like equation with @xmath47 playing the role of time , provided that the beam is in a pure polarization state .",
    "so the relativistic beam in question can formally be treated as a three - level non - relativistic unstable quantum system with in general a not self - adjoint non - stationary hamiltonian @xmath62 $ ] .",
    "this circumstance allows us to describe the behaviour of the beam by non - relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "moreover , we denote by @xmath63 the transfer matrix , namely the solution of eq .",
    "( [ t2 ] ) with initial condition @xmath64 .",
    "it is convenient to start by supposing that @xmath49 is homogeneous , so that we have the freedom to choose the @xmath59 axis along @xmath51 .",
    "correspondingly the explicit form of the mixing matrix is  @xcite @xmath65 since the faraday effect that would mix @xmath66 and @xmath67 is totally irrelevant at the energies considered in this paper .",
    "we denote by @xmath68 the photon mean free path and by @xmath69 the plasma frequency , which is related to the electron number density @xmath70 by @xmath71 then the various @xmath72 terms entering @xmath73 are @xmath74 @xmath75 @xmath76 @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the critical magnetic field .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath73 are @xmath79 @xmath80^{1/2 } \\right\\}~,\\ ] ] @xmath81^{1/2 } \\right\\}~,\\ ] ] and by using the general relations reported in appendix a of  @xcite it is straightforward to find the explicit form of the transfer matrix in this case @xmath82 where we have set @xmath83 @xmath84 @xmath85    consider now the even more particular case in which no absorption is present .",
    "accordingly the photon - alp conversion probability over the distance @xmath86 can be computed exactly and reads @xmath87 where the oscillation wavenumber @xmath88 is given by @xmath89 ^ 2 + \\left(\\frac{b_t}{m } \\right)^2 \\right\\}^{1/2}~.\\ ] ] a look at eqs .",
    "( [ t8 ] ) and ( [ t9 ] ) shows that the _ strong - mixing regime _ ",
    "in which the photon - alp conversion probability becomes maximal and energy - independent  takes place when the @xmath52 term in eq .",
    "( [ t9 ] ) dominates .",
    "this circumstance can be put into a more explicit form by introducing a low - energy cut - off @xmath90 along with a high - energy cut - off @xmath91 then the strong - mixing regime occurs in the energy range @xmath92 , where _ the plasma contribution , the alp mass term and the qed one - loop effect are negligible _ and should be discarded from the mixing matrix .",
    "the strong - mixing regime does not exist for @xmath93 .",
    "our choice to take the @xmath59 axis along @xmath51 has the advantage to make the above equations simpler and more eloquent , but in view of our later analysis it is essential to contemplate the situation in which @xmath51 forms a non vanishing angle @xmath94 with the @xmath59 axis .",
    "so , we proceed to work out the explicit form of the previous equation in the general case .",
    "accordingly , the mixing matrix arises from @xmath73 through the similarity transformation @xmath95 effected by the rotation matrix in the @xmath96 plane @xmath97 so that we get  @xcite @xmath98 with @xmath99 @xmath100 @xmath101 correspondingly , the transfer matrix becomes @xmath102 such an expression is fairly complicated in general , and we shall work it out whenever necessary .",
    "so far , we have supposed that the photons in the initial beam have a definite polarization .",
    "however , in the situation under consideration such a polarization is unknown to a considerably extent , and hence it is safe to regard the beam initially as unpolarized .",
    "therefore , it must be described by the ( generalized ) density matrix @xmath103 which  thanks to the above analogy with non - relativistic quantum mechanics  obeys the von neumann - like equation @xmath104 associated with eq .",
    "( [ t2 ] ) .",
    "then it follows that even if @xmath105 the solution of eq .",
    "( [ t5 ] ) is given by @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the initial beam state .",
    "accordingly , the probability that the beam will be found in the final state @xmath108 at @xmath47 is given by @xmath109 where it is assumed that @xmath110 .",
    "clearly in the particular case treated here eqs .",
    "( [ t5 ] ) , ( [ t5l ] ) and ( [ t72805 ] ) hold for @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "as we will see , in the present model of pks 1222 + 216 the beam crosses four regions with very different properties before being detected , and only in the first one @xmath49 can be taken as homogeneous in first approximation . in the second region",
    ", @xmath49 has a smooth @xmath47-dependence and in this case the beam propagation equation can be solved exactly owing to a drastic simplification of the @xmath72 terms entering the mixing matrix ( we find it more natural to address this issue in section iii - c where the properties of the region in question are discussed , which in turn dictate the form of the @xmath72 terms ) . in the third region",
    "@xmath49 possesses a turbulent structure which is currently modeled as random domain - like network , and this may or may not be the case in the fourth region ( more about this , later ) .    specifically , in the simplest situation all domains have the same size set by the coherence length of the magnetic field and the strength of @xmath49 is the same in every domain , but the orientation of @xmath49 changes randomly from one domain to the next ( however a more general situation has to be considered in the cosmological context , but these complications will be discussed later ) .",
    "therefore , inside the @xmath113-th generic domain ( @xmath114 ) the mixing matrix in eq .",
    "( [ t2 ] ) takes the form @xmath115 where the various @xmath116 quantities are just given by eqs .",
    "( [ t9nn1 ] ) , ( [ t9nn2 ] ) and ( [ t9nn3 ] ) . manifestly @xmath117 is the angle between @xmath118 and the a fiducial @xmath59 axis taken to be the same for all domains . denoting by @xmath119 the transfer matrix in the @xmath113-th domain  which is derived through the same steps as in the previous case ",
    "its explicit form just follows from eq .",
    "( [ gg28dd ] ) with @xmath86 denoting the domain size .",
    "moreover , according to quantum mechanics the transfer matrix for the whole network of @xmath120 domains is @xmath121 further , it proves convenient to denote by @xmath122 the transfer matrix corresponding to the first two regions .",
    "hence , the overall beam propagation is described by @xmath123 . as a consequence , the probability that the beam emitted in the state @xmath124 at @xmath125 will be detected in the state @xmath108 at @xmath47 for _ fixed _",
    "orientations @xmath126 of @xmath49 in every domain is @xmath127 where it is assumed again that @xmath110 .",
    "now , owing to the turbulent nature of the magnetic field in question the angles @xmath117 ( @xmath114 ) are to be regarded as independent random variables in the range @xmath128 . as a consequence , the physical detection probability for the considered beam arises by averaging the last equation over all angles , namely we have @xmath129    more specifically , since the photon polarization can not be measured at the considered energies , we have to sum eq . ( [ t7280527b ] ) over the two final polarization states @xmath130 @xmath131 in addition , we suppose for simplicity that the emitted beam consists @xmath132 of unpolarized photons , so that the initial beam state is described by @xmath133 therefore eq . ( [ t7280527b ] ) ultimately takes the form @xmath134 which gives the photon survival probability .",
    "the actual evaluation of @xmath135 goes as follows . in the first place we have to know @xmath122 .",
    "next , we arbitrarily choose @xmath117 in each domain and so we can evaluate @xmath136 for a given energy @xmath21 . thanks to eq .",
    "( [ t9nk26a ] ) and the next one , we find the photon survival probability for a single realization of the propagation process .",
    "we repeat these steps @xmath137 times , by randomly varying all angles @xmath117 each time , thereby generating @xmath137 random realizations of the propagation process . finally , we average the resulting photon survival probabilities over all these realizations of the propagation process , thereby accomplishing the average process in the last equation .",
    "we find in this way the physical photon survival probability @xmath138 when alp effects are included .",
    "we now proceed to build up our model for pks 1222 + 216 .",
    "we start by explicitly showing why it should not be observed by magic according to conventional physics .",
    "we next proceed to discuss photon - alp conversions in the beam propagation from the central region of pks 1222 + 216 to the earth .",
    "basically , four different regions crossed by the beam are identified , and in each of them we evaluate the relevant transfer matrix .",
    "all these pieces of information will be put together in section iv in order to find out the resulting physical effect .",
    "we stress that in this investigation we will make some rather rough assumptions even because of the lack of knowledge of a few properties of the source ( we defer a more detailed modelling to a future publication ) .      in the first place we need to know the relevant physical parameters .",
    "we assume a disk luminosity @xmath139 erg s@xmath25 , a radius of the blr @xmath140 , and standard values for cloud number density @xmath141 and temperature @xmath142 of the blr ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the adopted disk luminosity ( a factor of @xmath143 less than that derived in @xcite by the observed optical - uv continuum interpreted as the direct emission from the disk ) is calculated  following the method outlined in e.g.  @xcite  from the luminosity of the broad emission lines ( h@xmath35 , h@xmath144 , mgii ) recently obtained in  @xcite using several optical spectra taken in the period 2008 - 2011 .",
    "the adopted value of @xmath145 is derived from the measured line width and the black hole mass again in  @xcite .",
    "since the filling factor of the clouds is small , the average electron number density @xmath70 relevant for the beam propagation is much smaller than @xmath146 .",
    "models attributing the confinement of the clouds to a hot @xmath147 k external medium in pressure equilibrium with the clouds yield @xmath148 ( see e.g.  @xcite )",
    ". however , the presence of such a hot confining medium is disfavored by the lack of the necessarily expected bright x - ray emission .",
    "so , an extra contribution to the pressure confining the blr clouds is expected and the most likely one is due to a magnetic field with strength @xmath149",
    "@xcite ( for a review , see  @xcite ) . as a consequence ,",
    "@xmath70 gets considerably reduced , perhaps to values as low as @xmath150 .    in order to bring out quite explicitly the problem posed by the vhe observation of pks 1222 + 216 , we compute the optical depth @xmath151 of the beam photons in the blr according to conventional physics , which amounts to consider only the process @xmath15 .",
    "we follow the same procedure developed in  @xcite , to which the reader is referred for a full description .",
    "the optical depth is given by @xmath152 where @xmath21 is the energy of a @xmath1 ray , @xmath58 is the distance from the center of the blr , @xmath153 where @xmath154 is the scattering angle between the @xmath1 ray and the soft photon of energy @xmath155 , @xmath156 while @xmath157 is the spectral number density of the blr radiation field per unit solid angle at position @xmath58 and the @xmath158 pair - production cross - section reads  @xcite @xmath159 { \\rm cm}^2~,\\ ] ] which depends on @xmath21 , @xmath155 and @xmath160 only through the dimensionless parameter @xmath161^{1/2}~.\\ ] ] regarding @xmath21 as an independent variable , the process is kinematically allowed for @xmath162 the quantity @xmath157 concerning the target soft photons emitted by the photo - ionized blr clouds is calculated using the standard photo - ionization code cloudy as in @xcite using the input parameters listed above .",
    "the result is plotted as the blue long - dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : surf ] , which shows that pks 1222 + 216 should indeed be totally invisible in the energy range @xmath0 where it has instead been detected by magic .",
    "effective optical depth plotted as a function of rest - frame energy for vhe photons propagating in the blr of pks 1222 + 216 .",
    "the blue long - dashed line corresponds to the process @xmath15 .",
    "the other three lines pertain to our model containing alps .",
    "specifically , the violet dashed - dotted line corresponds to @xmath163 , the green short - dashed line to @xmath164 and the red solid line to @xmath165 ( more about this , later and in section iv - a ) . ]",
    "the derived @xmath151 is affected by some degree of uncertainty , which is a direct consequence of the uncertainty associated with some of the input parameters , in particular the luminosity of the disk and the radius of the blr .",
    "for instance , a disk luminosity smaller by a factor of @xmath166 was derived in  @xcite based on the luminosity of the broad h@xmath144 line measured from an old optical spectrum . moreover , an uncertainty in @xmath167 also affects the value of the radius of the blr , since it is customarily estimated by assuming the empirical relation @xmath168 ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we can roughly summarize the effect of the error associated with @xmath167 and @xmath145 on the optical depth by the following chain involving only the relevant quantities : @xmath169 , which indeed leads to @xmath170 .",
    "therefore , the final impact of these uncertainties is moderate .",
    "in fact , assuming @xmath171 erg s@xmath25 as in  @xcite , an optical depth comparable to our result is obtained in  @xcite .",
    "a possible complication is the presence within the blr of disk photons scattered by the high - temperature gas assumed to fill the region between the clouds .",
    "the total scattering optical depth associated with such a gas with the density @xmath150 assumed above is @xmath172 .",
    "a detailed calculation of the optical depth of @xmath1 rays associated with the scattered disk photons has been made in  @xcite , where it is found that the maximum absorption caused by this component is localized at @xmath173 gev , with a corresponding optical depth @xmath174 .",
    "clearly @xmath175 entails @xmath176 , thus showing that this contribution to the total @xmath151 can be safely neglected .",
    "as pointed out in section i , our proposal to avoid the problem of the huge optical depth is framed within the standard blazar model for photon production , but in addition we assume the existence of alps @xmath5 with parameters allowing for efficient conversions @xmath7 and @xmath177 .",
    "basically , we envisage that a large fraction of vhe photons produced as usual near the central engine become alps before reaching the blr , thereby crossing it totally unimpeded . outside the blr",
    "most of the alps are supposed to become vhe photons again in the large scale jet and in the host galaxy .",
    "because the beam traverses the extragalactic space , the possibility of photon - alp oscillations in this region has also to be taken into account .",
    "finally , we recall that the external magnetic field is the crucial quantity that triggers photon - alp conversions .    as a preliminary step , we find it very useful to rewrite eqs .",
    "( [ t9n ] ) and ( [ t9nn ] ) in the following more convenient form @xmath178 and @xmath179 so that we can very easily find out when the strong - mixing regime occurs .",
    "moreover , we observe that in the mixing matrix the plasma contribution is negligible with respect to the qed one - loop contribution for @xmath180 thanks to eqs .",

    "of course , condition ( [ t9nnk1 ] ) is relevant outside the strong - mixing regime .",

    "we start by considering the inner part of the blazar , namely the region extending from the centre to @xmath140 , to be referred to as region 1 .",
    "the magnetic field profile along the jet is well known to decrease outwards but unfortunately the presence of strong shocks and relativistic winds makes a precise estimate of the strength profile of @xmath49 for distances smaller than @xmath145 practically impossible . an analysis based on a highly idealized description relying on a one - zone , homogeneous leptonic model with external photons yields for the strength of @xmath49 at the base of the jet @xmath181  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we feel it realistic in this investigation to assume its strength to be constant and equal to its average value from the centre to the blr , which we take for definiteness @xmath182 . moreover , owing to the complicated morphology of @xmath49 , we similarly suppose that its average direction from the centre to the blr is nonvanishing and we assume it to be the same everywhere in the considered region ( equal to its average direction ) , so that we are dealing with a _ homogeneous _",
    "@xmath49 having an unknown direction . because the photon - alp conversions vanish if @xmath49 is just along the beam while it is maximal for @xmath49 transverse to the beam , we suppose in line with our heuristic attitude that @xmath49 is on average at an angle of @xmath183 with the beam direction",
    ". therefore we have @xmath184 .",
    "a natural question is to find out the energy range @xmath92 in which the strong - mixing regime takes place . as a working hypothesis we assume @xmath185 , so that @xmath186 becomes independent of @xmath32 , and in addition it follows that we are dealing with a _ very light _ alp just like in previous work  @xcite ( more about this , later ) .",
    "hence from eq .",
    "( [ t9nk ] ) we find @xmath187 for @xmath150 while @xmath188 for @xmath189 .",

    "an additional issue concerns the relevance of the qed one - loop effect . we know that it is negligible in the strong - mixing regime , but otherwise it can be important . since photon absorption is independent of @xmath49 it can presently be discarded , so that the relevant @xmath49-dependent quantity governing the photon - alp conversion probability is the oscillation wavenumber @xmath88 .",

    "( [ t9 ] ) immediately shows that the qed one - loop is unimportant with respect to the standard magnetic contribution at energies @xmath193 , namely for @xmath194 as expected .",
    "so , for @xmath33 rather close to @xmath195  which we will see to be indeed our case  the qed one - loop effect is negligible for _ fermi_/lat observations ( @xmath4 ) but of paramount importance for magic observations ( @xmath0 ) .    now , owing to eq .",

    "hence in the mixing matrix the plasma effect can be discarded .",

    "our final step consists in showing that the emitted spectra in the whole @xmath1-ray band obtained in section iv indeed lie on the sed of a realistic and physically motivated blazar model , thereby closing the circle .",
    "we stress that this problem does not have a unique solution , in the sense that it is quite conceivable that various leptonic and even hadronic models can work .",
    "nevertheless , from a methodological point of view the present work would be incomplete without the presentation of an explicit emission model .",
    "as already remarked , in an attempt to explain the observed magic emission of pks 1222 + 216 within conventional physics a particular model has been put forward  @xcite , which consists in a larger blob located _ inside _ the source responsible for the emission from ir to x - rays and a much smaller very compact blob accounting for the rapidly varying @xmath1-ray emission detected by magic . in order to avoid the blr photon absorption ,",
    "the smaller blob has been located _ well outside _ the blr , namely at a large distance from the centre ( we refer to the original paper  @xcite for a full discussion of the problems and a detailed description of this model ) . hence it looks natural to inquire whether a similar two - blob model can produce the sed needed in the present context ",
    "namely to fit the black points in figs .",
    "[ fig : seda ] , [ fig : sedb ] and [ fig : sedebl ]  with the key difference that now the smaller blob _ lies close to the central engine_. remarkably , this scenario works provided that the following parameters are chosen .",
    "briefly , each region is specified by its size @xmath362 , magnetic field @xmath295 , bulk lorentz factor @xmath363 , electron normalization @xmath364 , minimum , break and maximum lorentz factors @xmath365 , @xmath366 , @xmath367 and slopes @xmath368 , @xmath369 .",
    "the electrons radiate through synchrotron and inverse compton processes ( considering both the internally produced synchrotron radiation and the external radiation of the blr ) . for the larger region",

    "we find that an optimal choice to explain both _",
    "fermi_/lat and magic observations corresponds to the case ( @xmath353 ) without photon - alp oscillations in extragalactic space , for which we obtain through eq .",
    "( [ abc0606 ] ) the black points shown in fig .",

    "is concerned with the high - energy peak close to @xmath392 as it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : sedb1 ] , but the implied luminosity of the @xmath1-ray emission approaches @xmath393 erg s@xmath25 which appears unrealistic , since it is about 100 times larger than that of the most @xmath1-ray bright blazars ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "so , this result is unsatisfactory .",
    "we recall that the case @xmath163 has already been ruled out due to the by far too high @xmath1-ray peak .",
    "finally , the inclusion of photon - alp oscillations in extragalactic space makes the emitted spectrum slightly softer as it is evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : sedebl1 ] , but the situation still remains completely satisfactory .    in conclusion ,",
    "we find it a highly nontrivial circumstance that the benchmark case @xmath394 and @xmath395 turns out to be the best one concerning both the efficiency for vhe photons to escape from the blr and the sed of the particular two - blob model that we have adopted .",
    "thus , it turns out to be by far our best option .",
    "we have shown that the surprising @xmath1-ray detection of pks 1222 + 216 by magic can be explained  consistently with the simultaneous results by _ fermi_/lat  within a standard blazar model by adding the new assumption that inside the source photons can oscillate into alps .",
    "our explanation assumes an average magnetic field with strength @xmath182 in the jet up to the blr and a value @xmath396 for the inverse coupling @xmath397 .",
    "we remark that the emission model presented here is merely an example , and different and possibly more realistic scenarios can be constructed along similar lines .",
    "the main point we want to make is that with the photon - alp oscillation mechanism at work the emission can well originate inside the blr just like in conventional bl lac models .",
    "as far as photon - alp oscillations are concerned , their crucial role takes place in the source region before and just after the blr .",
    "needless to say , our scenario naturally applies also to the other fsrqs detected at vhe like 3c279 and pks 1510 - 089  @xcite , although these cases appear less problematic for the external emission scenario due to the absence of evident rapid ( @xmath398 day ) variability .    as already mentioned some alternative scenarios accounting for the puzzling features of pks 1222 + 216",
    "have been recently appeared in the literature .",
    "for instance , in  @xcite it is proposed that the vhe emission arises in the parsec - scale jet through the production of collimated beams of high - energy electrons by fast relativistic magnetic reconnection ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "alternatively , in  @xcite it is assumed the existence of collimated beams of neutral particles produced in the inner jet through photo - meson reactions of ultra - high energy protons .",
    "neutral particles can freely propagate to distances larger than the blr and then produce ultra - relativistic leptons interacting with the ir radiation of the dusty torus . in turn , the collimated leptons would produce highly beamed synchrotron emission . if the magnetic field at pc scale is small enough , not exceeding 1 mg , the vhe synchrotron radiation preserves the rapid variability of the inner engine at the pc scale ( but in this case the confinement of the clouds of the blr looks problematic ) .",
    "it appears to us remarkable that our proposed model lends itself to an observational test . because photon - alp oscillations can mitigate  but not completely avoid ",
    "the @xmath1-ray absorption inside the blr , a natural prediction is that at the optically - thin / optically thick transition around 30 gev ( in the source frame ) the spectrum should display a feature .",
    "so , the absence of such a feature would be hard to explain in our model but would directly support scenarios in which the emission occurs outside the blr as those discussed above .",
    "we find it quite tantalizing that precisely the most favorable value @xmath396 for the effect considered in this paper corresponds to the most favorable case for a large - scale magnetic field of @xmath354 in the darma scenario that enlarges the  @xmath1-ray horizon \" and provides a natural solution to the cosmic opacity problem  @xcite ( the darma scenario requires for the alp mass @xmath358 which is consistent with the present model ) .",
    "we want also to point out that it has recently been shown that alps with precisely the properties needed in our model naturally emerge in the large volume scenario of iib string compactifications  @xcite .",
    "in addition , a very light alp of the kind considered here is a viable candidate for the quintessential dark energy  @xcite .",
    "very remarkably , an independent laboratory check of our proposal will be performed with the planned upgrade of the photon regeneration experiment alps at desy  @xcite and with the next generation of solar axion detectors like iaxo  @xcite .",
