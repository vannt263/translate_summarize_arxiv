    "various kinds of droplet motion driven by a surface - tension gradient have been reported since , where the surface - tension gradient was given by an initial  @xcite or an external @xcite asymmetry in a surface condition .",
    "spontaneous motion in reactive spreading , or a droplet driven by a self - produced surface - tension gradient , has also been noted in various experimental systems  @xcite ; for example , a droplet of surfactant on a gold surface  @xcite , alloy melting  @xcite , and a water droplet containing silane on a glass substrate  @xcite . to interpret these phenomena , extensive theoretical studies on reactive droplets",

    "it has also been found that the motion of an oil droplet in an oil - water system exhibits chemo - sensitivity  @xcite .",
    "based on the measurement of the electrical potential at the oil - water interface in a similar system , the nature of the electrical fluctuation / oscillation has been shown to strongly depend on the chemical properties and the concentration  @xcite . however , the detailed mechanism of this effect of chemical substances has not yet been clarified .",
    "recently , it was proposed that an oil - water system also shows reactive spreading on a glass surface with recovery of the surface condition  @xcite .    in the present study",
    ", we experimentally observed the chemo - sensitive motion of an oil droplet on a glass substrate that had been partially pretreated with acid .",
    "we found that an oil droplet exhibits various behaviors , such as turning - back motion , stopping at a certain position , or slowing down around regions treated with acid .",
    "in addition , we also noted that the velocity and shape of the oil droplet show damped oscillation while the droplet moves continuously .",
    "however , detailed observations show that the motion of an oil droplet strongly depends on slight changes in the surface condition of the substrate . in terms of the argument given in our previous study  @xcite",
    ", we expect that the chemo - sensitivity of oil - droplet motion is caused by the condition of the glass surface affected by acid , which inhibits the aggregation of stearyl trimethyl ammonium ion ( sta@xmath0 ion ) on the glass surface . to confirm this hypothesis , we idealize an oil droplet as self - propelling spring - beads whose driving force is given by the surface - tension gradient .",
    "this model successfully reproduces the observed experimental results .",
    "furthermore , a numerical simulation of the model reveals that the selection among the turning - back motion , stopping at a certain position , and slowing down can be explained in terms of the effect of the acid on the glass substrate , where minute changes in the acid effect drastically change the behavior of the droplet .",
