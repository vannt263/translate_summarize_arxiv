    "recently , extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) and very soft x - ray emission has been detected from a number of clusters of galaxies . except for the coma and virgo cluster ( bowyer , lampton , & lieu 1996 ; lieu et al .",
    "1996a , b , c ; bowyer , berghfer , & korpela 1999 ; berghfer , bowyer , & korpela 2000 ) , the individual detections are controversial .",
    "other clusters which may have been detected include abell  1795 and abell  2199 ( bowyer , lieu , & mittaz 1998 ; mittaz , lieu , & lockman 1998 ) , abell  4038 ( bowyer et al .",
    "1998 ) , and abell  4059 ( bowyer 2000 ) .",
    "the excess euv detections in the rich clusters ( i.e. , not virgo ) correspond to luminosities of @xmath0 ergs s@xmath1 .",
    "the detections of abell  1795 and abell  2199 as extended euv sources have been quite controversial . for both clusters , detections with _",
    "euve _ were claimed by bowyer et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and mittaz et al .  (",
    "1998 ) . however , bowyer , berghfer , & korpela ( 1999 ) argued these detections were due to an incorrect subtraction of the background . in abell  2199 , lieu et al .",
    "( 1999b ) reobserved the cluster , and continue to claim detection of an extended euv source .",
    "an associated soft x - ray excess may have been seen with _ bepposax _ ( kaastra et al .  1999 ) .",
    "recently , _",
    "xmm _ appears to have confirmed the presence of very extended , euv / soft - x - ray excess emission in abell  1795 ( arnaud 2000 ) .",
    "in addition to the controversies about individual clusters , arabadjis & bregman ( 1999 ) argue that all the detections may be due to uncertainties in galactic absorption .",
    "thus , it is not certain at this point whether excess euv emission is a general characteristic of clusters of galaxies . in order to limit the contribution of cluster euv emission to the extragalactic background",
    ", we will assume that it is , in fact , a general property of rich clusters .",
    "if this is the case , then our calculations may give a determination of the cluster contribution to the euv background . if euv excess emission is present in only a fraction of rich clusters , then our calculations will give a strong upper limit to the contribution to the extragalactic background .    a promising theory for the euv emission by clusters",
    "is that it is produced by inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) by relativistic electrons in the intracluster medium ( hwang 1997 ; bowyer & berghfer 1998 ; enlin & biermann 1998 ; sarazin & lieu 1998 ) .",
    "this requires the presence of a distinct population of relatively low energy relativistic electrons with energies of @xmath2100 mev ( bowyer & berghfer 1998 ) beyond the population of higher energy electrons which produce radio emission in a small fraction of clusters ( e.g. , feretti 1999 ) .",
    "such a distinct population is expected theoretically , because the lower energy electrons have lifetime which are comparable to the hubble time , while the radio emitting electrons have very short lifetimes ( sarazin 1999 ; atoyan & vlk 2000 ; takizawa & naito 2000 ) .",
    "an alternative theory is that the euv emission is thermal in origin ( mittaz et al .",
    "1998 ; lieu , bonamente , & mittaz 1999a ) .",
    "there are a number of concerns with this thermal model , particularly with the energetics ( fabian 1996 ; sarazin & lieu 1998 ) .",
    "recently , lieu et al .",
    "( 1999a ) have argued that the observed euv to soft x - ray spectra of clusters decline rapidly with increasing frequency , and that this favors a thermal model .",
    "however , such a rapid decline is , in fact , what was predicted by the ic model ( sarazin & lieu 1998 ; sarazin 1999 ; atoyan & vlk 2000 ; takizawa & naito 2000 ; figure  [ fig : spectrum_model ] below ) .    in any case",
    ", we will normalize our calculations of the euv emission from clusters to the observed euv flux from the coma cluster , which is the best observed rich cluster .",
    "thus , our results are somewhat independent of the emission mechanism for the euv emission . in detail , we need a model to scale the euv luminosity of coma to other clusters and other redshifts , and we need a model for the spectrum of the emission . at present , there are no detailed thermal models for the euv emission from clusters which provide such predictions . on the other hand ,",
    "the ic model provides a very simple scaling of the luminosity and spectrum to other masses of clusters and to other redshifts (   [ sec : emit ] below ) .",
    "thus , we will adopt the ic model for the emission to scale the observed flux of the coma cluster to other clusters and redshifts .",
    "if this radiation really is a common feature of clusters at the indicated luminosity levels , it might make a contribution to the intergalactic background radiation field at uv through soft x - ray energies . in this paper",
    ", we estimate the mean intensity of the diffuse euv background from galaxy clusters , both at the current epoch and at higher redshifts .",
    "we will compare the radiation field from clusters with that produced by quasars and other active galactic nuclei ( agn ) ( e.g. , haardt & madau 1996 ) . in ",
    "[ sec : mass ] , we use press - schechter ( 1974 ) theory to calculate the abundance of clusters of a given mass as a function of redshift . in   [ sec : emit ] , the euv emission of clusters of a given mass is calculated , based on a simple ic theory .",
    "we assume that both the thermal energy of the intracluster gas and the energy of relativistic electrons are produced ultimately by intracluster shocks , and that these shocks convert a fixed fraction of the shock energy into relativistic particles .",
    "the resulting diffuse radiation field at the present epoch and at higher redshifts are given in ",
    "[ sec : results ] . the resulting ionization rates of and",
    "are also derived there .",
    "the cluster diffuse euv is compared to that produced by quasars and other agn .",

    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in order to determine the total background radiation from galaxy clusters , it is first necessary to model their number density and its evolution with redshift @xmath3 . while the present - day abundance of rich clusters is well - determined from observations ( see   [ sec : mass_compare ] below ) , the evolution of the cluster abundance is poorly determined at present , particularly at high redshifts .",
    "thus , we will use the press - schechter ( ps ) formalism ( press & schechter 1974 ) to model the cluster density and its evolution , with parameters chosen to fit the observed present - day properties of clusters and the results of more detailed numerical models of large - scale structure . comparisons to observations of clusters and to numerical simulations show that the ps provides an excellent representation of the statistical properties of clusters , if the ps parameters are carefully selected ( e.g. , lacey & cole 1993 ; bryan & norman 1998 ; viana & liddle 1999 ) .",

    "we have made the usual assumptions that each cluster under consideration has recently collapsed @xmath11 and that collapse is spherically symmetric .",

    "although there are published values for this constant ( e.g. , viana & liddle 1999 ; bahcall & fan 1998 ) , we choose to normalize our calculations to a fixed value for the observed local abundance of clusters .",
    "specifically , for each cosmology , we choose the value of @xmath13 such that the present day integrated number density of clusters with mass @xmath25 matches the observed value of @xmath26 mpc@xmath27 ( bahcall & fan 1998 ) .",
    "this method has the advantage that it forces the present day cluster abundance to be the same for each cosmology , as opposed to having a small spread in values , which occurs if an analytic approximation for the variation of @xmath13 with cosmology is used .",
    "the cosmological model is characterized by several parameters .",
    "the dependence on the hubble constant @xmath16 km s@xmath1 mpc@xmath1 just produces an overall scaling of the results , which we include through the factor @xmath28 .",

    "the number density of clusters evolves differently in each of these three models .",
    "while the latter two models agree better with observations ( e.g. , bahcall & fan 1998 ) , we include the closed model for completeness .    the evolution of the density of clusters is encapsulated in the @xmath37 term in equation  ( [ eq : psfunc2 ] ) . in general , @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the growth factor of linear perturbations as a function of cosmic time @xmath40 ( see peebles [ 1980 ] ,   11 for details ) .",

    "the closed model shows the strongest evolution , followed by the flat model , with the open model showing the weakest evolution , as expected ( e.g. , bahcall & fan 1998 ) .      as a check on these models ,",
    "we have estimated the resulting x - ray luminosity function of clusters at the present epoch . to convert the predicted mass function of clusters to an x - ray luminosity function , we first determine the temperatures of the gas in clusters using the observed mass - temperature relationship ( evrard , metzler , & navarro 1996 ; horner , mushotzky , & scharf 1999 ) @xmath59 where @xmath60 kev , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 .",

    "[ sec : intro ] , this implies that our results are upper limits on the extragalactic euv background due to clusters , if euv emission is not a common phenomena .",
    "while the mechanism for this emission is still under debate , inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) by cosmic - ray electrons seems to be a very strong candidate ( hwang 1997 ; bowyer & berghfer 1998 ; enlin & biermann 1998 ; sarazin & lieu 1998 ) . for the purposes of this analysis",

    "these values are typically 110% of the thermal energy content of the intracluster gas , @xmath89 .",
    "the observed values of @xmath89 scale as @xmath90 .",
    "the thermal energy content of the intracluster gas is the result of shock heating , where the shocks might include cluster merger shocks , overall accretion shocks , and shocks produced by galaxy winds ( sarazin 2000 ) .",
    "these shocks all have velocities of @xmath21000 km s@xmath1 .",
    "supernova remnants and other diffuse astrophysical shocks with similar velocities accelerate relativistic particles , and the radio properties of supernova remnants imply that @xmath23% of the shock energy goes into accelerating relativistic electrons ( e.g. , blandford & eichler 1987 ) .",
    "since both the relativistic electrons and the thermal energy in the intracluster gas arise from the same shocks , it seems reasonable to assume that the energy which is injected in relativistic electrons is proportional to the thermal energy content of the icm .",

    "then , the resulting spectrum was convolved with the _ euve _ effective area to give the expected count rate .",
    "this was compared to the observed values of the _ euve _ count rate ( lieu et al . 1996a ; bowyer & berghfer 1998 ; bowyer et al .",

    "there are a number of arguments which suggest that a portion of the thermal energy of the icm may have come from non - gravitational effects which probably occurred before the clusters formed ( e.g. , kaiser 1991 ; cavaliere , menci , & tozzi 1997 ) .",
    "even if this heating involved shocks , it is unlikely that primary electrons accelerated in such shocks survive to the present epoch ( sarazin 1999 ) .",
