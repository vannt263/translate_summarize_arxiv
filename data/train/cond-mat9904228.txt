    "attractions among stable colloidal particles lead to a diverse phase behavior .",
    "colloidal attractions , unlike the molecular attractions , act usually over a relatively short ( compared to the particle size ) range .",
    "it is by now well established that when the range of the colloidal attraction is decreased the phase diagram undergoes a progression from gas  liquid  solid to fluid ",
    "solid coexistence , the latter with a subcooled critical point which is metastable with respect to fluid  solid coexistence @xcite .",
    "numerous experimental studies show that suspensions often form incompletely equilibrated solids with the appearance of gels where one expects a fluid  solid @xcite or gas  liquid @xcite phase separation from equilibrium theory .",
    "the systems studied include mixtures of colloids and non - adsorbing polymer @xcite and sterically stabilized colloids in marginal solvents @xcite . in the former case ,",
    "the attractions stem from depletion of the polymer coils from the regions between closely spaced particles @xcite , and in the latter they are caused by surface grafted chain ",
    "chain interactions @xcite .",
    "the gel transition is observed when the range of attraction is short compared to the particle size . in the colloid ",
    "polymer mixtures this is achieved by choosing a small ratio of polymer to colloid size , whereas the overlap length of the surface grafted chains sets essentially the range of the attraction in the sterically stabilized particle systems .",
    "while the equilibrium phase behavior of these systems is well understood @xcite , the nature of the gel transition remains to be clarified .",
    "the gel state appears to be related to a ramified structure with interconnected particle clusters @xcite .",
    "temporal density fluctuations are very slow close to the gel transition and the suspensions acquire a yield stress and a finite low - frequency elastic shear modulus in the gel @xcite . in the past the transition to the gel state",
    "has most often been interpreted as either a static percolation transition @xcite , where a sample - spanning cluster of particles forms , or due to the fluid  solid phase transition @xcite .",
    "comparison between integral equation predictions for the percolation transition and experimental data , however , shows that the gel transition is confined to the region in the phase diagram between the static percolation threshold and the gas  liquid spinodal @xcite .",
    "colloidal gels have also been attributed to states inside a gas  liquid binodal which is metastable with respect to fluid  solid coexistence .",
    "such metastable binodals have indeed been observed for suspensions of globular proteins @xcite , which also form gels when the ionic strength is sufficiently high @xcite .    in this work we present an alternative interpretation of the dynamical arrest of the gel structure which causes colloidal systems to become disordered solids .",
    "we propose that colloidal gels are nonergodic systems that form when a dynamic gel transition is traversed .",
    "we further suggest that the gel transition is a low temperature extension of the liquid ",
    "glass transition .",
    "the gels , however , differ physically from colloidal hard sphere glasses in that they generally display a larger elastic shear modulus and that the particles are more strongly localized in the gels ; both of these effects are due to particle clustering induced by a short  range attraction among particles .",
    "we demonstrate that this is a possible explanation for colloidal gel formation by applying the idealized mode coupling theory ( mct ) of the form used to study the liquid ",
    "glass transition @xcite to systems in which the attraction is restricted to short ranges .",
    "this study is motivated by the observations made by verduin and dhont @xcite , who noted a structural arrest ( nonergodicity ) in connection with the gel transition similar to that observed for hard sphere colloidal glasses @xcite .",
    "also poon et al .",
    "@xcite have made such observations in the so - called transient gelation region of the colloid ",
    "polymer phase diagram for short polymers .",
    "krall and weitz @xcite have shown that , in the limit of strong particle aggregation , suspensions become nonergodic even at low colloid densities . to date , however , only a speculative connection has been made between the gel and liquid  glass transitions @xcite .",
    "we conduct a study of ergodicity breaking in two model systems : baxter s adhesive hard sphere ( ahs ) system and the hard core attractive yukawa ( hcay ) system .",
    "both systems supply analytical solutions for the static structure factor , the former within percus - yevick ( py ) theory @xcite , and the latter within the mean spherical approximation ( msa ) @xcite .",
    "this study provides more information on the ahs phase diagram and , in addition , serves to complement a recent independent mct study @xcite on the temperature dependence of the ahs glass transition .",
    "further , the hcay system provides a likely candidate for the gel transition in colloidal systems as an ergodicity breaking dynamic transition of the same type as the liquid ",
    "glass transition , suggesting that the experimentally observed gel transition is a low temperature extension of the glass transition .    in",
    "what follows , the idealized mode coupling theory of the liquid ",
    "glass transition , suitable for colloidal suspensions , is briefly summarized .",
    "results for the temperature dependence of the glass transition are then presented and compared to the ahs phase diagram as predicted by density functional theory .",
    "results are also shown for the hcay system , which show that the mct glass transition extends to the critical and subcritical region at low temperatures .",
    "the way in which the glass transition line traverses this part of the phase diagram is shown to be a strong function of the range of attraction .",
    "the mode coupling theory ( mct ) of the liquid  glass transition provides a dynamic description of the transition @xcite . for sufficiently strong interactions the dynamical scattering functions do not decay to zero with time , leaving instead finite residues  the nonergodicity parameters , also known as edwards  anderson parameters or glass form factors .",
    "generically , concurrent with this long - time diffusion ceases and the zero - shear viscosity diverges , both due to a diverging relaxation time .",
    "this structural relaxation time is in turn related to the particles inability of escaping their nearest neighbor cages .",
    "the glass transition within the framework of the idealized mct is not a conventional thermodynamic phase transition ; the constrained motion of the particles leads to a difference between time and ensemble averages , i.e. an ergodicity breaking transition .",
    "application of the mct to the mori  zwanzig reduced equations of motion for the density correlators , together with a @xmath0 limit , leads to the following set of closed equations  @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the number density , @xmath3 is the static structure factor , @xmath4 is the fourier  transformed ornstein ",

    "we show the zero - frequency elastic shear modulus as a function of the reduced temperature along the glass transition lines in fig .",
    "when the range of attraction is comparatively large ( b=7.5 ) the shear modulus remains constant at the hard sphere value , even for suspensions near the spinodal .",
    "this illustrates that the shear modulus , like the localization length , is determined by the large wavevector behavior of the liquid structure @xmath3 , and is unaffected by long - wavelength density fluctuations in our calculations . for shorter range attractions ( b=20 and 30 ) ,",
    "the shear modulus is dominated by particle clustering ; it increases strongly with decreasing temperature because of the stronger binding among particles , eventually showing a maximum for suspensions close to the bend in the k@xmath72 versus @xmath31 curves , where @xmath31 begins to decrease strongly with decreasing temperature . at lower density",

    "these results show that low temperature nonergodic structures , proposed to be colloidal gels here , are distinct from colloidal glasses in that they generally display a larger static shear modulus and strongly localized particles bound in clusters .    to more clearly connect this study of the low temperature behavior of the glass transition to the experimental studies of the gel transition ,",
    "we have calculated the intermediate scattering function upon approaching the glass transition at fixed volume fraction .",

    "note that additional incoherently scattered light due to particle size polydispersity @xcite may contribute appreciably and cause @xmath9 to attain such a large value .",

    "thus , a fair comparison should be made with a theory , e.g. , mwda @xcite , which can use the same input as that supplied to the mct .",
    "alternatively , the mct can be solved using a more accurate static structure factor , such as that from hmsa theory @xcite .",
    "this would enable a determination of the location of the glass transition relative to that of the fluid  solid freezing transition , testing the conjecture made here that the glass transition line tracks the freezing transition at higher density in the phase diagram .",
    "the idealized mct has been shown to provide a possible explanation for important aspects of the colloidal gel transition . in this scenario",
    "the arrest of the dynamics during the gel transition is caused by a low temperature liquid ",
    "glass transition .",
    "the underlying phenomenon is a breaking of ergodicity , caused by long - time structural arrest .",
    "it is accompanied by the cessation of hydrodynamic diffusion and the appearance of relatively large finite elastic moduli as the particles are tightly localized in ramified clusters .",
    "the ahs system was found to have endpoint singularities in the phase diagram .",
    "the spectacular dynamics close to the mct endpoint singularity has been the focus of a recent study @xcite . however , the glass transitions that occur at low temperatures in the ahs system are accompanied by numerical difficulties , resulting from the singular nature of the ahs pair interaction potential .",
    "nevertheless , the ahs system provides insight into the temperature dependence of the glass transition in systems with weak short  range attractions .",
    "subtle changes in the structure caused by the attractions lead to an initial increase in the glass transition density with decreasing temperature .",
    "the particles forming the glassy cage tend to stick together , thereby creating openings in the collective cage around a central particle which have to be filled by increasing the critical colloid density .",
    "we suggest that the recrystallization of glass samples at high densities upon addition of short polymers , reported in @xcite , is explained by this shift of the glass transition density to higher values .",
    "moreover , the mct glass transition line was observed to lie parallel to the dft fluid  solid freezing transition at high temperatures in the ahs phase diagram .",
    "introduction of a finite range of attraction and replacement of the py theory with the msa via the hcay system , yields glass transition lines that extend to low temperatures in the phase diagram . for hcay systems with moderate ",
    "range attractions the glass transition line crosses the liquid binodal . when the range of the attraction is further restricted the glass transition line passes above the critical point , likely rendering part of the ( metastable ) equilibrium phase diagram irrelevant .",
    "preliminary solutions of the dynamical mct equations for the b = 30 hcay system indicate that nearby @xmath79 singularities with @xmath80 appreciably distort the time dependent structural correlators in the intermediate time windows , even though no @xmath81 singularity @xcite could be found in the phase diagram",
    ".    the nonergodicity transitions of the hcay system are influenced by two mechanisms which are absent or not dominant in the hard sphere and lennard ",
    "jones @xcite systems . in the latter two ,",
    "the temperature dependence of the critical density @xmath82 is either trivially absent or arises from the soft repulsive part of the pair interaction potential .",
    "along the mct transition line in the lennard ",
    "jones liquid the temperature dependent packing fraction @xmath83 , resulting from the effective excluded volume diameter @xmath84 @xcite , is roughly constant @xmath85 and approximately equal to its hard sphere value @xcite . as the soft repulsion of the lennard ",
    "jones system leads to @xmath86 , the critical density smoothly decreases with temperature @xcite .",
    "note that this observation indicates that the nonergodicity transitions resulting from the solution of eq .",
    "[ coh ] for the lennard ",
    "jones system are dominated by the excluded volume effect , i.e. the primary peak of the structure factor @xmath3 , as is also the case for the hard sphere system . because the idealized mct has been developed from approximations aimed at describing the connected physical mechanism , called cage or back  flow effect , the quality of the mode coupling approximation is expected to be unaffected by temperature changes as long as these excluded volume effects dominate in eqs .",
    "[ coh ] and [ incoh ] .",
    "the nonergodicity transition lines of the hcay system on the other hand are additionally affected by the low wavevector fluctuations in the fluid structure factor , @xmath3 for @xmath20 , and by the increase in @xmath3 at large wavevectors arising from the short  range nature of the attraction .",
    "the first aspect , which also occurs for longer range attractions , leads to nonergodicty transitions tracking the spinodal curve ( see appendix ) .",
    "the short  range nature of the attraction causes the stronger localization of the particles , i.e. the shorter localization length @xmath18 , upon decreasing the temperature .",
    "also the strong increase in the elastic shear moduli along the nonergodicity transition line occurs only for sufficiently short  range attractions as shown in fig .",
    "again , the ability of the mct eqs .",
    "[ coh ] and [ incoh ] to describe such local interparticle correlations is not known .",
    "note , however , that the hcay results are independent of the numerical parameters chosen .",
    "clearly , theories aimed at long wavelength phenomena at the gel transition can not incorporate these variations of the elastic modulus as described by the mct because it arises from local potential energy considerations .",
    "the asymptotic model , defined by eq . [ asymp ] ( and b @xmath70 ) , which highlights the effects of strong short  range attractions , captures all aspects of the low density mct nonergodicity transitions qualitatively and even semi  quantitatively .",
    "furthermore , it clearly demonstrates that the gel transitions are not driven by long  range structural correlations .",
    "it can be expected that such an asymptotic model can be found for other theories of liquid structure with strong short ",
    "range attractive potentials , but the detailed predictions presented here rest upon the use of the msa for the hcay system .    based on this suggested interpretation of the mct nonergodicity transitions , several features of the computed hcay density ",
    "temperature diagrams agree qualitatively with experimental observations made on colloid  polymer mixtures and sterically stabilized suspensions @xcite .",
    "first , the gel transitions appear to lie at lower temperatures than , but otherwise track , the freezing line when present .",
    "second , for short  range attractions the gel transition can shift to comparable or higher temperatures than those required for gas  liquid phase separation .",
    "third , the gel line does not show such a strong density dependence as the static percolation transition .",
    "we emphasize that this suggested interpretation of the colloidal gel transitions is based on an extension of the idealized mct of the glass transition beyond the range its approximations were aimed at . our speculation , however , can be decisively tested by dynamic light scattering experiments .",
    "nonergodicity transitions within the mct exhibit universal dynamical properties @xcite , which for example led to the identification of the colloidal hard sphere glass transition by van megen and coworkers @xcite .",
    "as more complicated bifurcation scenarios , @xmath79 with @xmath87 @xcite , can be expected , the dynamics at the gel transitions should be very nonexponential and anomalous .",
    "moreover , the short  range attractions lead to couplings among more wavevector  modes , as can be seen from the asymptotic model defined by eq .",

    ", the coexistence region can be tentatively divided into three regions . for somewhat lower temperatures than the critical temperature , gas ",
    "liquid phase separation occurs , provided a thermodynamically stable liquid phase exists . for temperatures ( just ) below the triple point temperature ,",
    "gas  crystal phase separation takes place .",
    "decreasing k@xmath23 still more , gas  glass coexistence may be expected if  as argued from computer simulations @xcite  the way to crystallization proceeds via the initial formation of a liquid droplet , whose density lies above the nonergodicity transition line . as the glass states for this system are rather close to the ideal hard sphere glass state , we expect signatures of this well studied transition to be observed @xcite .",
    "we speculate that the vanishing of the homogeneously nucleated crystallites in the colloid ",
    "polymer systems upon addition of sufficient large molecular weight polymer , observed in @xcite , signals the presence of a nonergodicity transition as found in the colloidal hard sphere system @xcite .",
    "this suggestion can be tested by studying the dynamic density fluctuations close to the transition as has been demonstrated in the hard sphere system @xcite .    for suspensions with short  range attractions , like the b=20 or b=30curve in fig .",
    "[ ph2 ] , it seems possible that the long  range density fluctuations , likely induced by the hidden critical point , become arrested when the denser domains of the system cross the mct nonergodicity transition line .",
    "nonergodic gel states characterized by large small - wavevector form factors @xmath9 , rather short localization lengths , and finite , rather large elastic moduli can be expected .",
    "we suggest that these nonergodicity transitions cause the gel transitions observed in the colloid  polymer mixtures and sterically stabilized suspensions , and anticipate that they may also play a role in other colloidal systems , such as emulsions @xcite , emulsion ",
    "polymer mixtures @xcite , and suspensions of globular proteins @xcite , in which short  range attractions also dominate .",
    "we caution again that a proper extension of the mct used here to include a full description of the critical dynamics close to critical points has yet to be formulated .",
