    "<S> for most theories which parametrize modifications of general relativity , including those which violate the equivalence principle , gravitational redshift tests typically offer weaker constraints on such test parameters than do precision measurements of the universality of free fall ( uff ) and local lorentz invariance ( lli ) . </S>",
    "<S> although redshift anomalies are often linked with violations of uff or lli , they do not have to be . </S>",
    "<S> we offer a simple model in which particle masses anomalously vary with the gravitational potential . </S>",
    "<S> this generates gravitational redshift anomalies unconstrained by existing tests of uff or lli . </S>",
    "<S> we propose new experiments to limit such effects .    </S>",
    "<S> [ [ section ] ]    -10pt    the gravitational redshift is a classic test of general relativity ( gr ) . </S>",
    "<S> it was the first test that einstein proposed for gr  @xcite , and its verification by pound , rebka , and snider in the early 1960s  @xcite was the first of many increasingly precise tests of einstein s equivalence principle ( eep ) and gr  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the precision of some tests , particularly those of the universality of free fall ( uff )  @xcite , is such that their indirect limits  @xcite on redshift anomalies are more precise than current tests  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> modern redshift tests can nevertheless bound anomalies that are presently poorly constrained . </S>",
    "<S> we present a simple test lagrangian which can describe such anomalies , and show that placing an atom interferometer ( ai ) on a sounding rocket could improve terrestrial bounds on such anomalies by a factor of more than @xmath0 , and by at least a factor of 10 over solar system tests of a particular generalization . </S>",
    "<S> the eep is a cornerstone of gr , and has been subjected to variety of experimental  @xcite and astrophysical tests  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> eep requires that : i ) a body s gravitational mass always equals its inertial mass  known as uff , or the weak equivalence principle ; ii ) local lorentz invariance ( lli ) : the results of nongravitational experiments do not depend upon the velocity of the freely falling frame in which they are performed ; and iii ) local position invariance ( lpi ) : the result of a nongravitational experiment does not depend upon where and when it is performed  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these have been experimentally tested by i ) torsion balance experiments  @xcite , ii ) a wide variety of lorentz symmetry tests  @xcite , and iii ) gravitational redshift experiments  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the three components of the eep are closely interrelated , and follow from uff for most theories of gravity  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a simple redshift experiment involves two clocks @xmath1 and @xmath2 which locally tick at frequency @xmath3 , separated by a distance @xmath4 as in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : clocksep ] . </S>",
    "<S> if we neglect the earth s rotation and use the schwarzschild solution to the einstein field equations , the leading order gravitational redshift is @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the frequency of clock @xmath2 as measured by clock @xmath1 , and @xmath7 is the leading order redshift anomaly , if any . equation ( [ eq : redi ] ) is obtained from the effective nonrelativistic point - particle lagrangian @xmath8 if @xmath7 is a universal constant , this lagrangian produces an unobservable rescaling of @xmath9 , since any local measurement of the acceleration of free fall would yield @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the anomaly is observable if it varies for different systems , if @xmath11 in the clocks lagrangian is replaced by @xmath12 . in terms of @xmath13 , the observed anomaly </S>",
    "<S> would be @xmath14 and may therefore be constrained by gravitational redshift tests . </S>",
    "<S> this effect can also be constrained by torsion balance tests of the uff , since it predicts a different acceleration of free fall for different systems . </S>",
    "<S> the best limits on uff violations are presently obtained by the et - wash experiment  @xcite , which bounds the etvs parameter @xmath15 for beryllium relative to titanium . </S>",
    "<S> using haugan s  @xcite formula to estimate the resultant limits for magnetic hyperfine transition energies , this bounds the observable atomic clock @xmath16 at the level of @xmath17 , more than two orders of magnitude smaller than the accuracy of current tests  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> redshift anomalies can also be measured by ais , which use matter waves to measure the proper time difference for atoms moving along different paths in a gravitational potential  @xcite . in its simplest form , </S>",
    "<S> the ai is essentially a hafele - keating  @xcite separated clock comparison test , in which the clocks follow two different ballistic trajectories . as outlined in more detail elsewhere  @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> atoms are launched vertically with velocity @xmath18 at time @xmath19 , and undergo bragg scattering from the standing wave generated by a retroreflected laser , synchronizing their ` clocks . ' </S>",
    "<S> the state of each atom has equal amplitude to have @xmath20 or @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the atoms recoil velocity ; thus the atoms are coherently split to travel different paths . after a time @xmath23 , </S>",
    "<S> atoms on the two paths are given equal and opposite momentum kicks of @xmath24 , so that they overlap and can be interfered with one another at time @xmath25 with a second bragg pulse . </S>",
    "<S> we find the relative phase of the matter waves along the two arms of the interferometer by measuring the number of atoms in each of the two possible final momentum states . </S>",
    "<S> since matter waves oscillate at the compton frequency ( @xmath26 hz , for cs atoms ) , very small changes in the proper - time along one arm relative to the other can be resolved . for the test models described above </S>",
    "<S> , the total interferometer phase is the sum of the free evolution phase @xmath27 and the interaction phase @xmath28 : @xmath29  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as before , if the local @xmath9 is measured independently of the ai , only differences in the value of @xmath30 that also give rise to violations of uff can generate redshift anomalies .    </S>",
    "<S> more subtle effects can appear at higher order . </S>",
    "<S> consider a model where particles masses anomalously vary in their local gravitational potential @xmath31 this model includes terms resembling those appearing at higher order in the expansion of the schwarzschild metric . may be understood as several anomalous terms in the expansion . </S>",
    "<S> higher order gradients and gr must be considered when experiments are sensitive to @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> ] whether the resulting redshift anomalies are violations of the eep , or merely corrections to gr is beyond our present scope . </S>",

    "<S> the total ai phase is @xmath36 the second term in ( [ eq : typeiiiphase ] ) is similar to one derived by dimopoulos  @xcite using gr for a differently configured ai . </S>",
    "<S> the third term is absent from that analysis . </S>",
    "<S> the most sensitive tests of the gravitational redshift in ais are precise to 7 ppb  @xcite , which in light of the small launch velocity ( @xmath37 m / s ) , translates to a bound of @xmath38 . </S>",

    "<S> motion of the earth in the sun s gravitational potential would permit earth - stationary pound - rebka - snider experiments with @xmath41 accuracy to bound @xmath42 by repeated measurements made while the earth moves between orbital perihelions .    </S>",
    "<S> the effects of @xmath33 are suppressed by one or more factors of @xmath43 , the characteristic velocity of the apparatus along the gravitational potential gradient . </S>",
    "<S> limits on @xmath33 can improved by carrying out an ai redshift test on a sounding rocket  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the precision of the ai redshift test improves during the rocket s time in free fall , as the leading order ai signals vanish in free fall , while anomalies do not . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate that @xmath44 precision could be achieved by such an experiment  @xcite . at the same time , @xmath45 increases by a factor of up to @xmath46 relative to the stationary test  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such a test could have a sensitivity to @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> note that such a test would also be sensitive to higher order gr effects not accounted for here  @xcite .    </S>",
