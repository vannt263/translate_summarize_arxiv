    "our original goal was to describe finite , slim , semimodular lattices @xmath4 by the posets ( partially ordered sets ) @xmath5 of their meet - irreducible elements .",
    "this was motivated by three facts : there are many results on lattices with unique meet irreducible decompositions , slim semimodular lattices have intensively been studied recently , and it is well - known that finite distributive lattices can be described this way .",
    "dilworth @xcite was the first to deal with _",
    "unique meet irreducible decompositions _ in finite lattices . to give a brief overview ,",
    "let @xmath6 denote the join of all covers of @xmath7 in a finite lattice @xmath4 .",
    "if the interval @xmath8 $ ] is distributive for all @xmath9 , then @xmath4 is a _",
    "join - distributive _ lattice in nowaday s terminology .",
    "there are more than a dozen equivalent definitions of these lattices and two equivalent concepts , antimatroids and convex geometries .",
    "dilworth @xcite , who was the first to consider these lattices , used the ( equivalent ) definition that each element can uniquely be decomposed into a meet of meet irreducible elements .",
    "the early variants were surveyed in monjardet @xcite .",
    "since it would wander to far if we overviewed the rest , we only mention adaricheva @xcite , abels @xcite , caspard and monjardet @xcite , avann @xcite , jamison - waldner @xcite , and ward @xcite for additional sources , and stern  @xcite , adaricheva and czdli @xcite , and czdli @xcite for some recent overviews .",
    "however , the reader is not assumed to be familiar with these sources since the present paper is intended to be self - contained for those who know the rudiments of lattice theory up to , say , the jordan - hlder theorem for semimodular lattices .",
    "what is mainly important for us is that slim semimodular lattices , to be defined soon , are known to be join - distributive , see czdli , l.  ozsvrt , and udvari ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 2.2 ) .",
    "a finite lattice @xmath4 is _ slim _ , if @xmath10 , the set of nonzero join - irreducible elements of @xmath4 , is included in the join of two appropriate chains of @xmath4 ; see czdli and schmidt @xcite . in the semimodular case ,",
    "this concept was introduced by grtzer and knapp @xcite in a slightly different way .",
    "the theory of slim semimodular lattices has developed a lot recently , as witnessed by czdli @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , czdli , dkny , ozsvrt , szakcs , and udvari @xcite , czdli and grtzer @xcite , czdli , l.  ozsvrt , and udvari @xcite , czdli and schmidt @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , grtzer and knapp @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , and schmidt @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xcite gives an application of these lattices outside lattice theory while @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , partly of fully , are devoted to their structural descriptions .",
    "all lattices and posets in the paper are assumed to be _ finite _ , even if this convention is not repeated all the time .",
    "we have already mentioned that slim semimodular lattices are join - distributive .",
    "this fact , combined with dilworth s original definition of these lattices , and some recent propositions in czdli @xcite led to our original goal , mentioned at the beginning of the paper .",
    "since the poset @xmath11 does not determine a slim , semimodular lattice @xmath4 in general , the original target had to be modified .",
    "slim lattice are planar by czdli and schmidt ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 2.1 ) , that is , they allow planar ( hasse ) diagrams .",
    "although the corresponding posets @xmath11 are not planar in general , their appropriate diagrams still have an important property of planar ones ; we will coin the name _ quasiplanar _ to this property . for a first impression ,",
    "note that all diagrams but @xmath12 in figures  [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] are quasiplanar ; in particular , @xmath13 is quasiplanar but not planar .",
    "now , the modified target is to describe the _",
    "planar diagrams _ of slim semimodular lattices by quasiplanar diagrams .",
    "of course , diagrams are only considered up to similarity , to be defined soon .",
    "the main result of the paper , theorem  [ thmmain ] , gives a canonical bijection between the class of planar diagrams of slim semimodular lattices and that of quasiplanar diagrams .",
    "this way even the original goal is achieved in a weak sense , because @xmath4 is described by any of its planar diagram @xmath14 , and @xmath14 described by a quasiplanar diagram , which is much smaller than @xmath14 in general .",
    "note that the converse possibility offered by theorem  [ thmmain ] , that is the description of quasiplanar diagrams by planar diagrams of slim , semimodular lattices , could also be interesting , because slim semimodular lattices are well - studied .",
    "the strength of this converse option will be demonstrated by corollary  [ corollcount ] , which counts quasiplanar diagrams of a given size .",
    "after recalling or introducing the necessary concepts , section  [ conceptsection ] formulates the main result , theorem  [ thmmain ] , which asserts that finite , slim , semimodular lattice diagrams and finite quasiplanar diagrams mutually determine each other .",
    "also , this section gives the exact number of @xmath15-element quasiplanar diagrams , see corollary  [ corollcount ] .",
    "section  [ proofsection ] , which contains many auxiliary statements , is devoted to the proof of theorem  [ thmmain ] .",
    "finally , section  [ commentsection ] contains some comments that shed more light on the main result .",
    "as mentioned already , the reader is not assumed to have deep knowledge of semimodular lattices ; a little part of any book on lattices or particular lattices , including grtzer @xcite , nation @xcite , and stern @xcite , is sufficient .",
    "a ( hasse ) diagram @xmath14 of a poset @xmath16 consists of some _ points _ on the plane , representing the elements of @xmath0 , and _ edges _ , which are non - horizontal straight line segments connecting two points and represent the covering relation in @xmath0 in the usual way .",
    "concepts and properties originally defined for posets ( and lattices if @xmath0 happens to be lattice ) will also be used for their diagrams ; for example , we can speak of a maximal chain of a diagram , and we can say that a lattice diagram is slim and semimodular .",
    "a diagram is _ planar _ if its edges do not intersect , except possibly at their endpoints . for a more exact definition of planarity and the concepts defined in the next paragraph , the reader can ( but need not ) resort to kelly and rival @xcite .",
    "let @xmath17 be a maximal chain in a diagram @xmath14 .",
    "this chain cuts @xmath14 into a _ left side _ and a _ right side _",
    ", see kelly and rival ( * ? ? ?",

    ", we can speak of the leftmost maximal chain of @xmath4 , called the _ left boundary chain _ , and the rightmost maximal chain , called the _ right boundary chain_. the union of these two chains is the _ boundary _ of @xmath4 . also ,",

    "@xmath20 ( or extending @xmath20 ) and the rightmost one make sense . if @xmath21 , then the leftmost maximal chain of @xmath14 through @xmath20 is the union of the left boundary chains of the subdiagrams @xmath22 , @xmath23 $ ] ,  , @xmath24 $ ] , and @xmath25 .",
    "if @xmath26 is a singleton , then chains containing @xmath27 are said to be chains through @xmath27 rather than chains through @xmath28 .",
    "the most frequently used results of kelly and rival @xcite are the following two .",

    ".    we will only consider _ bounded diagrams _ , that is diagrams with 0 and 1 , because otherwise the meaning of the left or right side of a maximal chain , which is possibly a singleton , is less pictorial .",
    "note , however , that this paper could easily be translated to the `` not necessarily bounded setting '' by defining quasiplanar diagrams as @xmath36 subdiagrams of bounded quasiplanar diagrams @xmath0 .",
    "let us emphasize that a quasiplanar diagram always has 0 and 1 by definition . by the following definition ,",
    "lemma  [ leftrightlemma ] will hold but lemma  [ krchainlemma ] may fail for those poset diagrams that play a crucial role in the paper .",
    "a diagram @xmath14 is _ quasiplanar _ if it is bounded and , in addition , for any two incomparable @xmath37 , whenever @xmath7 is on the left of _ some _ maximal chain through @xmath30 , then @xmath7 is on the left of _ every _ maximal chain through @xmath30 .    for @xmath38 in a quasiplanar diagram @xmath14",
