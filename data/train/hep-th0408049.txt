    "in recent years , it has become clear that the separation between open and closed string descriptions of certain physical phenomena is very much an artifact of perturbation theory .",
    "this means more than just strong / weak coupling dualities linking different string theories , but also includes transitions within a given theory from an open string description ( _ e.g. _ , involving d  branes ) to a closed string one ( _ e.g. _ , involving only fluxes ) , as the strength of a coupling changes .",
    "gauge / string dualities are the best known examples of this type of phenomenon , and for that reason alone it is of interest to learn more about how to describe them . for this",
    ", it is of course necessary to go beyond perturbation theory , and furthermore , to develop a far richer picture than that which is accessible using only simple strong / weak coupling duality .",
    "we need to be able to define the theories in question at arbitrary values of the couplings in order to address the many subtle issues which can arise .",
    "matrix models in the double scaling limit@xcite defined for us the earliest examples of exactly solvable string theories with readily accessible non  perturbative information . these types of models have recently been interpreted as examples of open / closed dualities in a very direct sense@xcite , but also describe more subtle of interesting open and closed string phenomena , as we shall recall . in the direct sense , they represent certain decoupling limits of the world  volume theories of @xmath2 d  branes in non ",
    "critical string theories@xcite , and at large @xmath2 as in ads / cft they reconstruct their parent string theories in specific spacetime backgrounds .",
    "these models are particularly interesting in that they are not supersymmetric , the d  branes are generically unstable , and as such their open string modes are tachyonic .",
    "the matrix models in fact supply us with perfect models of tachyon condensation@xcite , allowing for the unified description of d  branes , closed strings , and the transitions between them@xcite .",
    "for example , the picture of d  brane decay as the process of rolling down a tachyon potential to find a new minimum representing closed strings always suffered somewhat from at least one conceptual discomfort : once one arrives at the bottom of the potential , one still has the open string variables : where are the closed strings ? without the description of the closed string theory to which one is supposed to have arrived , the picture drawn in figure  [ fig : metaphor]_(a ) _ is really only a metaphor .        in the double scaled matrix model approach , such diagrams are refined into more precise ones such as that depicted in figure  [ fig : metaphor]_(b)_. the matrix model potential ( after double scaling ) is the tachyon potential . in the eigenvalue description , at large @xmath2 the eigenvalues form a droplet ( or collection of droplets ) in one ( or more ) of the minima of this potential .",
    "the collective excitations of the eigenvalue constituents in these droplets are closed string physics , while the process of moving an eigenvalue out of the collective and up to a extremum of the potential represents the creation of a d  brane , whose tension is given by the energy difference between the sea of collective eigenvalues and the extremum .",
    "furthermore , it was shown some time ago how to describe , with matrix models , string vacua containing a specific number ( say , @xmath3 ) of background d ",
    "branes , both for non  perturbatively unstable models@xcite and non  perturbatively stable ones@xcite .",
    "we will be examining these definitions more in this paper . in each set of models ,",
    "the region of large positive cosmological constant , @xmath4 , in each model give identical perturbation theory , and can be identified as having @xmath3 background d  branes .",
    "the non  perturbatively stable models allow one to continue to a second perturbative region , that of large negative @xmath4 , whose interpretation was unclear at the time the models were first presented .",
    "recent work@xcite has shown that these non  perturbatively stable models are actually descriptions of the type 0a string theories , and that the large negative @xmath4 perturbative regime has an interpretation in terms of there being @xmath3 units of r  r flux .",
    "this is an example of an open / closed transition happening as a coupling ( @xmath4 ) in the theory changes .",
    "( see refs.@xcite for generalizations to the rest of the minimal models for type  0a . )    in this paper we wish to examine in detail some of the key components of these matrix model definitions , and sharpen the understanding of many of the features of the models . a key role",
    "is played by the diagonal of the resolvent @xmath5 of the schrdinger operator @xmath6 , ( @xmath7 is a spectral parameter ) which enters in three logically distinct ( but interconnected ) ways : _ ( a ) _ it acts as a source for placing d  branes and fluxes into the background , as can be seen from the way it enters the matrix model and the resulting string equations .",
    "_ ( b ) _ it acts as a probe of the background , since its first @xmath8integral ( after a laplace transform ) is the macroscopic loop expectation@xcite operator .",
    "its probe character also follows from the fact that its first @xmath8integral yields the effective force on a scaled eigenvalue@xcite . in order to understand better the physics in the various regimes",
    ", we switch on the background , corresponding to including the resolvent in the string equations with strength @xmath3 , and then we work in each perturbative regime , using the integrated resolvent as a probe to see the effects of the background .",
    "we study this probe at disc order in large positive @xmath4 perturbation theory , and to annulus and torus order in large negative @xmath4 perturbation theory , in order to characterize the effects of d  branes and fluxes on the matrix eigenvalues .    _",
    "( c ) _ the integrated resolvent forms a representation of a twisted boson @xmath9 in an associated conformal field theory .",
    "the entire content of the closed string theory can be expressed in terms of virasoro constraints@xcite the microscopic loop equations on the partition function which is realized as wavefunction in a coherent state of the boson .",
    "the creation modes of the boson are closed string operator insertions in the string theory .",
    "the virasoro constraints in the presence of @xmath3 were worked out in ref.@xcite and refined in ref.@xcite .",
    "it was observed in ref.@xcite that the insertion of the d  brane ( or flux ) background in this language corresponds to just acting with a vertex operator of the twisted boson , @xmath10 the parameter @xmath11 corresponds to the boundary cosmological constant .",
    "this latter observation is particularly interesting since it makes extremely explicit ( if it were not manifestly so already ) the fact that in a fully non  perturbative framework , such as this one , structures that we interpret as open strings in some perturbative regime can be introduced in entirely closed string terms , built out of a specific combination ( derived in refs.@xcite ) of closed string operators .",
    "here we see it succinctly in terms of the vertex operator .",
    "this is of course one of the biggest lessons to be taken away from all of this : open / closed transitions and strong / weak coupling dualities exist because the physics can be specified independently of the perturbation theory ( this is also the central lesson of m  theory ) .",
    "when we can get a handle on the right variables whose definition is not rooted in the world ",
    "sheet expansions , we can describe the physics in a number of ways , involving open or closed strings .",
    "this also leads one to wonder whether the twisted boson framework should be taken as an equivalent starting point for discussion of the non ",
    "critical string theory in various backgrounds .",
    "is there a sense in which it is another ( holographic ) dual of the theory , or does it rise above that , being the parent theory within which holography and duality become manifest ?",
    "this would go beyond the recent interesting statements in the literature@xcite that the complex curve described by the analytically continued effective potential is simply an alternative target space .",
    "instead , it would suggest that the twisted boson should be given dynamical meaning .",
    "interestingly , in that work , of which we do not understand much ( due to no fault of the authors ) an exponentiation of the boson also plays a natural role in the insertion of d  branes in the background , which reminds us of the observation of ref.@xcite , discussed above .",
    "clearly this connection deserves to be better understood . ] .",
    "specific solutions for the wavefunctions correspond to certain non ",
    "critical string backgrounds we already know , and so we should expect that the dynamics of @xmath12 can give us more insight into non  perturbative dynamics of string vacua , including perhaps time dependence , if we can find analogous structures in higher dimensional string theories .",
    "there is a fair amount of review material in this paper for which we make no apology .",
    "it sets up the language and conventions , and reminds the reader of older ( and often highly relevant ) literature .",
    "the following outline will help the well  informed reader avoid the parts they wish to : in section  [ sec : stringequations ] , we recall the string equations for the bosonic and type  0a systems , noting that the former are perturbatively equivalent to the latter in the large positive cosmological constant regime .",
    "section  [ sec : matrixbosonic ] is a detailed review of the double scaled matrix model origins of the bosonic string equations , while section  [ sec : potentials ] reviews the details of how to extract the effective ( tachyon ) potential for eigenvalues in the scaling limit .",
    "the non  perturbative effects of d  branes ( instantons ) are recalled .",
    "their tensions are computed from the effective potentials for scaled eigenvalues , and are known from explicit computations ( at least for the unitary members of the @xmath1 series@xcite ) to match the tensions of the d  brane of the continuum theory .",
    "the interpretation in terms of d  brane world ",
    "volume theory and tachyon potentials is discussed in detail there .",
    "sections  [ sec : matrixzeroay ] ,  [ sec : matrixopen ] , and  [ sec : potentialsagain ] review and complete the derivation of aspects of the doubled scaled matrix model origins of the type  0a string equations , explains the connection to the bosonic models , and discusses the differences in non  perturbative effects .",
    "this includes a reminder of the role of the two seas of eigenvalues in stabilizing the non  perturbative physics .",
    "section  [ sec : loopsbranes ] turns to backgrounds with non ",
    "trivial open string or r  r flux .",
    "the central object in this section is the resolvent , which plays two connected roles here .",
    "the first is as a probe of the matrix model in the language of macroscopic loops , or as the effective force on a scaled eigenvalue .",
    "we re  derive the effective ( tachyon ) potential of section  [ sec : potentials ] from this point of view , now including terms higher order in perturbation theory .",
    "the second role is as a source in the string equations which inserts a number of d  branes , or units of flux , into the background .",
    "this section has both of these roles working in tandem , since we study the loop operator ( eigenvalue dynamics ) in the presence of the non  trivial backgrounds .",
    "so after a brief review of the properties of the string equations for these situations , we remind the reader of the properties of the scaled loop operator in these theories , and explain the systematics of developing the results for the operator perturbatively , using the string equations together with the gelfand  dikii equation .",
    "we derive compact expressions for the loop operator and hence the eigenvalue distributions and effective potentials to disc order ( and to annulus and torus order ) , and analyze the results . in section  [ sec : loopsbranesagain ]",
    "we remark upon the fluidity of the formalism in its treatment of the closed string and open string sectors .",
    "we see that the open string ( or flux ) backgrounds can be implemented in terms of a specific preparation of closed string operators .",
    "this is made much more transparent and suggestive in an associated conformal field theory language , which organizes everything .",
    "we remind the reader of the formalism@xcite of the @xmath13 twisted boson , and of how the entire content of the string theory is expressed as virasoro constraints on the partition function .",
    "this partition function is realized in the twisted boson framework as a coherent state .",
    "we then discuss how@xcite the open string or flux background is simply realized by placing a vertex operator into the coherent state background .",
    "this shows the remarkable transparency of the formalism with regards working with open or closed string backgrounds .",
    "consider the following equations : @xmath14 and @xmath15 here @xmath16 is a real function of the real variable @xmath8 , a prime denotes @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is a constant , and @xmath11 and @xmath3 are parameters we shall discuss further shortly .",
    "we define the quantity : @xmath19 where the @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) are polynomials in @xmath16 and its @xmath8derivatives .",
    "they are related by a recursion relation : @xmath22 and are fixed by the constant @xmath23 , and the requirement that the rest vanish for vanishing @xmath24 .",

    "the @xmath31 are normalized such that the coefficient of @xmath32 is unity , _",

    "sheet cosmological constant in the case @xmath39 for the bosonic string ( in which case we take equation  ( [ eq : nonpertbos ] ) ) and @xmath40 for the type 0a string , in which case we take equation  ( [ eq : nonpert ] ) ) . for the case",
    "@xmath40 for the bosonic string , @xmath4 couples to a boundary operator measuring lengths .    the equations  ( [ eq : nonpertbos ] ) and  ( [ eq : nonpert ] ) have exactly the same physics for large @xmath8 ( equivalent to @xmath4",
    "; we will sometimes use the two interchangeably ) , which corresponds to a perturbative regime .",
    "let us set @xmath41 and @xmath42 for now .",
    "for example , for @xmath39 , we have for the free energy ( discarding non  universal terms ) : @xmath43 where the dimensionless parameter @xmath44 is the closed string coupling .",
    "we see the expansion in terms of closed string worldsheets of topology @xmath45 ( @xmath46 is the number of handles ) , each coming with factor @xmath47 .",
    "the dependence on the sphere displays bosonic kpz scaling @xmath48 for the critical exponent ( string susceptibility ) @xmath49 , and @xmath39 here . for @xmath40 , @xmath50 , which should be discarded with other non  universal physics , and so this theory has no contribution from any closed string world",
    "it is a topological theory , as we will recall below .",
    "the closed string coupling for this @xmath39 case is @xmath51 . for general @xmath26 ,",
    "it is : @xmath52 which fits with the fact that @xmath53 and hence : @xmath54 non  perturbatively , the situations for each equation , and hence the models they describe , are different . for the case of equation  ( [ eq : nonpertbos ] ) ,",
    "there is a well  known instability@xcite .",
    "the physics is non  perturbatively problematic for even @xmath26 , there being no sensible real solutions for @xmath16 which match onto the large @xmath8 perturbation theory just discussed .",
    "this fits with the fact that the model is rendered unstable through a decay channel mediated by instanton effects@xcite which we now think of as the nucleation of d  branes .",
    "let us turn to equation  ( [ eq : nonpert ] ) , starting again with @xmath11 and @xmath3 set to zero .",
    "this equation enjoys better non  perturbative properties than the original string equation  ( [ eq : nonpertbos ] ) , ( see refs.@xcite ) while sharing the same perturbative physics for large positive @xmath8 , as follows from the fact that @xmath55 is also a solution of this equation , and that for large @xmath56 , the leading order equation is @xmath57 .",
    "so the behaviour @xmath58 can be chosen for large positive @xmath8 , and the perturbative expansion is exactly the same as that given in equation  ( [ eq : partfunexpand ] ) .    for large negative @xmath8 , however , we can choose a completely different behaviour for solutions of equation  ( [ eq : nonpert ] ) from that available for equation  ( [ eq : nonpertbos ] ) .",

    "these solutions were proposed as non  perturbative completions of the sick bosonic string models a while ago@xcite .",
    "that statement has now been refined by recent work@xcite : the models have an interpretation as type 0a models .",
    "this is consistent with a number of facts , among which is the fact@xcite that the spectrum of operators of the liouville dressed @xmath1 conformal minimal models match exactly those of the super  liouville dressed @xmath0 superconformal minimal models .",
    "both sets of models can be derived from one  matrix models in the double scaling limit and we can choose hermitian matrices if we so wish .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : nonpertbos ] ) for @xmath41 arose for hermitian matrix models , which can be written in the form : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is an @xmath66 hermitian matrix , and the coefficients of the polynomial potential @xmath67 and the parameter @xmath68 are tuned to critical values as @xmath69 . recall that the feynmann diagrams of the matrix model are interpreted as dual to discretisations of the string worldsheets , organized in a genus expansion for large @xmath2 .",
    "the path integral is then to be thought of as a particular regularization which enumerates the sum over surfaces .",
    "the typical size of a cell in the discretization is set by a parameter we shall call @xmath70 .",
    "the critical potentials are those which pick out surfaces with diverging area , so that in the continuum limit @xmath71 these give finite area contributions to the path integral .    the typical method of study@xcite is to diagonalize @xmath65 using a unitary matrix @xmath72 into the form @xmath73 , where @xmath74 .",
    "there is a jacobian for this change of variables , which is the square of the van der monde determinant @xmath75 , and the resulting model is ( after dividing by a normalization factor @xmath76 ) : @xmath77    an efficient way of working@xcite is to use polynomials @xmath78 which are orthogonal with respect to the measure @xmath79 , @xmath80 the polynomial @xmath81 must be equal to @xmath82 plus a correction , which for even potentials ( on which we will focus here ) is simply : @xmath83 where we have defined the coefficient @xmath84 . using the orthogonality condition it is given in terms of the @xmath85s as @xmath86 .    after a little more work ,",
    "one can write the vacuum energy of the model as@xcite : @xmath87 where the ellipsis denote parts which are non ",
    "universal , and the entire problem is one of determining the @xmath84s .",
    "the content of the matrix model can be extracted from the relation : @xmath88 which amounts , after integrating by parts , to a compact master equation : @xmath89 where we have used a bra ",
    "ket representation of the orthogonal polynomials and the integration over product pairs of them with respect to the measure .",
    "functions integrated with respect to the measure become operator valued in this representation : @xmath90 the recursion relation  ( [ eq : relate ] ) define @xmath91 which allows a rewriting of the master equation in the equivalent form : @xmath92 which will be useful later on .",
    "it is convenient to write our master equation  ( [ eq : master ] ) a touch more compactly as : @xmath93 where @xmath94 the master equation is now actually a recursion relation for the @xmath84 , as can be seen by expanding for a given potential @xmath95 .",
    "the higher the order of @xmath95 , the more terms there are in the recursion relation .",
    "the continuum limit is then easily approached in these variables . at large @xmath2",
    "we pass to a continuum limit in eigenvalues space as well , and write @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 .",
    "the master equation is : @xmath99 and the free energy is : @xmath100 focusing on the sphere contribution means dropping terms subleading in @xmath2 and so the difference equations become polynomial relations in @xmath101 : @xmath102 the required divergent behaviour of the free energy @xmath103 occurs when the polynomial in @xmath101 acquires @xmath26 multiple roots : @xmath104 .",
    "this amounts to choosing particular values of the couplings in the potential@xcite and also tuning @xmath68 to a critical value @xmath105 .",
    "the critical value of @xmath101 at this point can be chosen to be equal to 2 , and in the neighbourhood @xmath106 , without loss of generality .",
    "we can choose a potential of degree @xmath107 to get the above behaviour , and a convenient basis is@xcite : @xmath108    finite physics is extracted by allowing @xmath101 and @xmath109 to approach their critical values at the right rate as @xmath110 .",
    "the quantity @xmath111 must also be scaled with @xmath70 so as to approach zero at the correct rate : @xmath112 ( numerical prefactors of the scaled quantities @xmath113 and @xmath18 are chosen for convenience . )",
    "to go beyond the sphere one simply keeps the @xmath114 contributions in the master difference equation , and in the large @xmath2 limit it becomes a differential equation . inserting the scalings into the master equation and expanding about @xmath71 gives for the first non  vanishing terms , a differential equation of order @xmath115 at order @xmath116 .",
    "so in taking the limit @xmath117 , this is the surviving physics and it is in fact equation  ( [ eq : nonpertbos ] ) , with @xmath41 , @xmath42 and all @xmath27s set to zero except @xmath118 and @xmath29 .    by introducing dimensionful coefficients @xmath29 for each potential , we can consider the general model . from the point of view of the @xmath26th theory ,",

    "the function @xmath24 itself can be thought of as the two point function of the puncture operator .",
    "it is also important to keep in mind the eigenvalue picture .",
    "the eigenvalues take values on the real line .",
    "the van der monde determinant acts as a repulsive potential , driving them apart , but they are confined by the potential @xmath95 to form a droplet of finite size at large @xmath2 . at large @xmath2 , at the spherical level , one can solve for a density @xmath124 of eigenvalues on the line .",
    "a relation between the orthogonal polynomial quantity @xmath101 and the eigenvalue density @xmath124 can be derived at sphere level@xcite : @xmath125 from this expression , it is clear that the ends of the eigenvalue density are located at @xmath126 .",
    "recalling that the neighbourhood of @xmath127 is where the interesting physics comes from , we must pick one of them to which to scale our physics : @xmath128 this , together with the scalings  ( [ eq : critical ] ) gives an expression for the scaled density : @xmath129 where we have used that @xmath130 on the sphere .",
    "explicit computation of the integral yields@xcite : @xmath131 where we remind the reader again that this is valid only at the sphere level .",
    "crucially , note that since there is a common factor @xmath132 , the eigenvalue density vanishes at @xmath133 as @xmath134 .",
    "there are @xmath135 more zeros which are located away from this endpoint . for @xmath26",
    "even there is another zero at @xmath136 and @xmath137 zeros off the real line in pairs . for @xmath26 odd , there are no other zeros on the real line , and only pairs of zeros off the real line . in general , @xmath124 is real on the part of the real line where the eigenvalue are located but its complex parts are meaningful also , as we shall see .    a most important quantity is the effective potential that an individual eigenvalue sees@xcite .",
    "it is minus the change in energy as the eigenvalue moves from @xmath138 to @xmath139 , and is given by the expression : @xmath140 where @xmath141 is the matrix model resolvent .",

    "the middle curve in each case is the case of @xmath42 .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    next , let us note that there is an important quantity which arises in the continuum limit of the matrix models which will play an important role here and later . in the bra ",
    "ket formalism introduced earlier , the operator @xmath191 in equation  ( [ eq : operatorchange ] ) can be directly formulated as a differential operator@xcite .",
    "this comes because the shift operators @xmath192 get represented as derivative operators @xmath193 acting on functions of @xmath96 .",
    "recall also that there is a specific scaling for the objects from which @xmath191 is made , given in equation  ( [ eq : critical ] ) , so we can expand it and see what its scaling is in the limit @xmath117 and we find that : @xmath194 the schrdinger operator @xmath35 plays a crucial and very natural role in what is to come .    the matrix model origin of the string equation  ( [ eq : nonpertbos ] ) with non  zero @xmath3 arises by adding a term@xcite @xmath195 to the matrix model potential . in the world ",
    "sheet dual to the feynmann diagrams , this corresponds to adding holes of all sizes , by expansion of the logarithm .",
    "this new term adds new pieces to the master equation  ( [ eq : masteralt ] ) : @xmath196 on the sphere , there is still the critical behaviour where large area surfaces dominate , near @xmath197 , but there is an additional critical point near a critical value of @xmath198 set by @xmath199 .",
    "this arises because , _",
    "e.g. , _ on the sphere , the last term in equation  ( [ eq : newterms ] ) reduces to @xmath200 .",
    "so the lengths of loops can chosen to diverge if we send @xmath201 , but give finite length loops as @xmath117 if we scale at the right rate .",
    "since near the critical point the new terms are : @xmath202^{\\frac{1}{2}}}\\ , \\ ] ] this rate turns out to be @xmath203 .",
    "the factor of @xmath114 scaling as @xmath204 produces the appropriate damping of the divergence and the string equation  ( [ eq : nonpertbos ] ) results ( as before ) at order @xmath116 , the resolvent arising from the appearance of @xmath35 in the scaling part of @xmath205 , appearing at the same order in @xmath70 as @xmath11 does .",
    "the same procedure can be applied to the master equations  ( [ eq : masterthree ] ) arising from placing walls in the system .",
    "as happens before , order @xmath189 is where the non  trivial physics appears , and the lefthand side of the string equation  ( [ eq : nonpert ] ) appears at this order , while the right hand side , @xmath206 appears multiplying @xmath207 times the left hand side of the gelfand  dikii equation  ( [ eq : resolventequation ] ) , with @xmath169 set to @xmath11",
    ". thus we arrive at equation  ( [ eq : nonpert ] ) .",
    "so this is how the position of the walls and the weight factor of the loops become related in the continuum model . in effect , the argument of the logarithm diverges ( so as to give finite length loops in the continuum limit ) at the same place in eigenvalue space at which the walls are located .",
    "another way to see that this must be true is to imagine that equation  ( [ eq : nonpert ] ) was true , but for another parameter @xmath208 , instead of @xmath11 .",
    "how can we fix @xmath208 ? taking sums and differences of the equations we see that we have a condition that either @xmath209 and the equation  ( [ eq : nonpert ] ) follows , or we have @xmath55 , in which case @xmath41 .",
    "this matches what we learned from the matrix model .",
    "if we do not scale the parameters so as to make the logarithm diverge precisely at the ends , then it produces no new physics .",
    "turning to the issue of instantons arising from analyzing perturbation expansions , we note@xcite that there is another instanton contribution to the large positive @xmath8 perturbation theory . searching as before for the perturbation @xmath210 , we get the same instanton as for the equation  ( [ eq : nonpertbos ] ) , and in addition , there is an equation : @xmath211 which , upon using @xmath212 , gives instanton : @xmath213 this instanton can be connected to the physics of the effective potentials we have already studied .",
    "see figures  [ fig : effpots ] and  [ fig : doubledpot]_(a)_. for large positive @xmath8 , the results from before will still apply ( after a shift of the origin of coordinates to place one of the walls there ) , modified only by the fact that the eigenvalues must be positive .",
    "looking at the effective potentials , we see that since there is a wall at @xmath214 , the instanton at negative @xmath7 previously encountered for @xmath26 even can not destabilize the system .",
    "there is an instanton for all @xmath26 at the wall , and its tension is given by @xmath215 , which a computation shows is : @xmath216 this is the same action as the new instanton perturbations of the solutions we saw above .",
    "so we see that although the same instanton which destabilised the bosonic theory is present in the analysis , it does not represent an instability@xcite .",
    "since the role of @xmath11 in the matrix model is to move the wall , as we saw in the previous section , it can be seen as an interpolating parameter in some sense , since the limit of large negative @xmath11 approaches ( but never reaches ) the physics of the unstable bosonic models@xcite .",
    "see figure  [ fig : sigmaplots]_(b)_. notice for example how as @xmath11 becomes more negative , for the case @xmath39 , the system begins to develop more fluctuations at negative @xmath8 , ultimately heralding the poles that exist on the negative @xmath8 axis for the painlev  i equation ( equation  ( [ eq : nonpertbos ] ) for @xmath39 . ) .",
    "studies of this sort were presented in ref.@xcite .",
    "the physical role of @xmath11 from the point of the continuum string theory is more subtle .",
    "it represents a non  perturbative contribution to the coupling of a boundary operator @xmath217 which measures the length of world  sheet boundaries or loops@xcite .",
    "it is a boundary cosmological constant and we will examine it in some more detail in the next section .",
    "note that for the models defined by equation  ( [ eq : nonpertbos ] ) with @xmath41 , the boundary length operator for the @xmath26th model is identified with @xmath218 .",
    "see ref.@xcite .",
    "in particular , for @xmath40 , the operator is @xmath121 which couples to @xmath118 . for this case , ( and for the @xmath40 solution of equation  ( [ eq : nonpert ] ) for large positive @xmath8 ) it is interesting to note that @xmath11 can be absorbed into @xmath8 without changing the universal physics .",
    "so we see that @xmath11 is indeed a natural realization of the boundary cosmological constant , by matching onto the perturbatively identified boundary operator .",
    "recall that the @xmath40 model has no expansion in terms of closed string world",
    "the theory s entire content comes alive when the other operators @xmath119 are inserted , and their correlation functions at genus @xmath46 are then seen to be isomorphic to intersection numbers on the moduli space of riemann surfaces of genus @xmath46 : it is a topological theory .",
    "the @xmath40 solution of equation  ( [ eq : nonpert ] ) ( for large @xmath8 ) shares this behavior , but develops new features in the non  perturbative regime .",
    "in fact , this is a precise example of a non  perturbative completion of a topological theory , and deserves further study from this perspective .",
    "it can be rewritten as the type  0b model in the same background , as identified in ref.@xcite using the change of variables of refs.@xcite .",
    "as we will recall below the partition function of the @xmath40 theory ( exactly for equation  ( [ eq : nonpertbos ] ) and at large positive @xmath8 for equation  ( [ eq : nonpert ] ) ) only has a topological expansion in the presence of d  branes , giving only world ",
    "sheets with boundaries in the expansion .",
    "now we turn to the physics of non  zero @xmath3 .",
    "a study of equation  ( [ eq : nonpert ] ) for non  zero @xmath3 shows that large positive @xmath8 ( or @xmath4 ) perturbation theory has an interpretation as including world ",
    "sheet boundaries , and in fact @xmath3 counts the number of d  branes in the background , as can be seen by the fact that a factor @xmath219 appears for a surface with the number of boundaries equal to @xmath220 .",
    "for example , for @xmath39 : @xmath221 the equation supplies fully non  perturbative completions of this physics , including the following behaviour at large negative @xmath8 ( or @xmath4 ) : @xmath222 where the first term is universal to all @xmath26 . at face value , the interpretation in terms of boundaries can be made in this regime as well , but explanation for the number of exactly vanishing orders in perturbation theory ( all surfaces with an odd number of boundaries , for example ) is needed . instead , ref.@xcite pointed out that in this regime , there are no branes , but instead r ",
    "r fluxes , using facts from the continuum type 0 theories and the matrix model . here",
    ", we ll study the matrix models further and uncover the effective potential beyond tree level in both regimes .",
    "its behaviour in the different regimes clearly give support to this interpretation .",
    "the large positive @xmath8 perturbation theory of the equation matches perturbation theory obtained from equation  ( [ eq : nonpertbos ] ) , which for non ",
    "zero @xmath3 and @xmath11 was formulated in refs.@xcite .",
    "@xmath3 appears multiplying the resolvent , which in turn satisfies equation  ( [ eq : resolventequation ] ) .",
    "in fact , the most efficient way to construct a perturbative expansion for @xmath16 is to treat equation  ( [ eq : nonpertbos ] ) as an equation for @xmath223 and then substitute it into the resolvent equation , yielding an equation for @xmath224 and hence for @xmath16 .",
    "this of course yields the equation  ( [ eq : nonpert ] ) .",
    "of course , this larger equation allows solutions for @xmath16 which are not solutions of equation  ( [ eq : nonpertbos ] ) .",
    "these are the solutions which have the well defined large negative @xmath8 asymptotics and accompanying pleasant non  perturbative behaviour which we now associate to type 0a .",
    "see the families of curves displayed in figure  [ fig : gammaplots ] .    that the resolvent appears explicitly in the description of d  branes in the backgrounds is interesting because the same object is known to control the behaviour of macroscopic loops in the continuum theory@xcite .",
    "this is worth recalling in some detail : in the matrix model , it is natural to consider the wilson loop : @xmath225 its laplace transform is @xmath226 and in the continuum limit it is : @xmath227 the saddle point equation of the matrix model is : @xmath228 where @xmath229 denotes the principal part and the integral is over the support @xmath230 of the density function , @xmath124 , of eigenvalues @xmath169 .",
    "the density is normalized according to @xmath231 .",
    "the real part of @xmath232 is equal to @xmath233 on the support of @xmath124 where its imaginary part is non  zero .",

    "@xmath124 is given by the discontinuity of @xmath239 on the cut @xmath230 .",
    "the connection with the continuum loop operator and the continuum resolvent operator comes from the definition : @xmath240 where , as before , @xmath7 is the scaling part of @xmath169 .",
    "now the marvellous thing@xcite is that @xmath241 and it is the laplace transform of the continuum loop @xmath242 the schrdinger operator @xmath35 arose earlier in equation  ( [ eq : criticallambda ] ) .",
    "loops correspond to expectation values of traces of powers of matrices @xmath243 where @xmath244 .",
    "this corresponds to cutting a @xmath245sided hole in the dual picture of discretized worldsheets .",
    "we hold  @xmath246 fixed by sending @xmath245 to infinity as we send @xmath117 . in the bra ",

    "in particular , the procedure is to solve either string equation for @xmath16 to desired order in perturbation theory , keeping some non  zero value of @xmath11 .",
    "this is now to be treated as a potential for the hamiltonian @xmath35 , and one can solve for its resolvent @xmath5 to that order in perturbation theory by using equation  ( [ eq : resolventequation ] ) .",
    "the next step is to integrate once with respect to @xmath8 to get the loop operator @xmath248 , and one can integrate once with respect to @xmath7 to get the effective potential @xmath251 : @xmath252 in fact , it is more interesting to examine the properties of @xmath248 , for its zeros tell us about the possible location of d  branes .",
    "we already know the structure of the zeros at the level of the sphere in perturbation theory , where @xmath3 is invisible .",
    "this procedure allows us to efficiently examine the effect of non ",
    "zero @xmath3 on the structure of the zeros .",
    "it also allows us to study the large negative @xmath8 behaviour of the effective potential rather clearly .",
    "the previous methods were limited to the sphere , and in particular the leading behaviour on the sphere vanishes for large negative @xmath8 .    to start with ,",

    "this is what we had before , recalling that @xmath11 marks the position of the wall , and @xmath4 is where the eigenvalue density @xmath261 ends .",

    "in which case @xmath248 becomes : @xmath265 with zeros at approximately : @xmath266    the zero to the right of @xmath4 lies on a cut which runs to infinity , marking support of the eigenvalue distribution .",
    "the other zero can be thought of as a cut which has collapsed to zero size , in the language of ref.@xcite .",
    "as explained in ref.@xcite , there is a collapsed riemann surface of the form @xmath267 where @xmath268 , extending to the complex @xmath7plane .",
    "the vanishing of @xmath248 controls the location of the cuts on the complex plane @xmath7 , and the surface is the double cover of the plane joined through the cuts , giving a surface of specific topology .",
    "we can perform the integral @xmath269 along a closed contour running between the cuts on one sheet and closing the loop by going along the other sheet .",
    "the normalization is chosen to compute the change in the effective potential @xmath251 , following equation  ( [ eq : effectivepotential ] ) . for our problem in hand , we see that the result comes from the pole at @xmath262 , and the result is precisely @xmath3 .",
    "this counts the number of branes in the problem .",
    "we ve computed a pleasant general structure for the higher @xmath26 cases . the leading contribution ( up to disc order ) to @xmath16",
    "is : @xmath270 and some algebra produces the resolvent : @xmath271 integrating this up gives @xmath272 and @xmath273 where we reproduce the previous effective potential expressions on the sphere , but have in addition a disc level contribution .",
    "the location of the zeros of @xmath274 give the extrema of the effective potential .",
    "the issue boils down to a @xmath275th order polynomial in @xmath7 , which on the sphere has zeros at @xmath11 and @xmath276 for positive @xmath7 , and for odd @xmath26 there are no other real ones ( only @xmath135 imaginary ones ) . for",
    "even @xmath26 there are @xmath135 imaginary ones and a single extra one at @xmath277 . at the level of the disc",
    "these zeros get deformed , as before , but notice that there is again a pole at @xmath278 , which will give a non  vanishing contribution of precisely @xmath3 to the b  cycle integral @xmath279 between the cut to the right of @xmath149 and the collapsed cut located just to the left of @xmath262 .",
    "there are presumably means of deforming the problem in order to have non  zero b ",
    "cycle integrals between the cut and the other @xmath280 zeros , and these would define other branes too .",
    "it is not clear whether this can be done in this matrix model description .",
    "we can just as easily study and construct the same quantities in the negative @xmath8 limit too .",
    "in fact , we can write everything succinctly for all @xmath26 to the first non  vanishing order .",
    "we have in the large negative @xmath8 direction : @xmath281 putting this into the resolvent equation  ( [ eq : resolventequation ] ) , we get @xmath282 from this we get : @xmath283 and @xmath284    the most interesting thing here is that the zeros are at : @xmath285 there is only one zero . on the sphere ,",
    "it is at @xmath11 .",
    "the effective potential vanishes there .",
    "so there is no sign of anything that we would interpret as a sector representing d  branes of finite tension .",
    "this is consistent with the interpretation that there are no d  branes in this limit .",
    "all we have is the eigenvalue sea . in a sense",
    "it has filled up beyond the top of the potential and so there are no branes .",
    "this is what is depicted ( somewhat schematically ) in figure  [ fig : doubledpot]_(b)_.    beyond the sphere does not change this conclusion .",
    "there is a single zero , and the value of the potential does not have a @xmath286 scaling normally associated to d  branes .",
    "it is important to note that this is because of how equation  ( [ eq : nonpert ] ) and the resolvent equation works perturbatively .",
    "first note that the resolvent equation  ( [ eq : resolventequation ] ) can not itself generate odd powers of @xmath287 or @xmath3 in any expansion for @xmath288 .",
    "it must get it from the potential @xmath16 which is governed by the string equation .",
    "it can do this from ( for example ) the disc term in the large positive @xmath8 expansion .",
    "equation  [ eq : nonpert ] , however , gives only even powers of @xmath287 and for @xmath3 in a large negative @xmath8 expansion for @xmath16 .",
    "this then ensures that the resolvent will never have odd @xmath3 or @xmath287 , and therefore the effective potential @xmath289 will never give rise to energies which have such dependence .",
    "therefore there can be no objects which have their mass  energy originating at disc order in perturbation theory , and hence no d ",
    "branes for large negative @xmath8 .",
    "this constitutes a proof of this directly in this language , and lends further credence to ref.@xcite s interpretation of @xmath3 as controlling closed string backgrounds , namely r ",
    "r fluxes .",
    "it is further interesting to note that if we include the next order in perturbation theory beyond the sphere , the value of the effective potential at the zero is : @xmath290 which scales as @xmath291 , which is the correct scaling for r  r flux in closed string perturbation theory , or for a torus contribution .    finally , it is interesting to study a family of exact solutions to equation  ( [ eq : nonpert ] ) for each @xmath26 .",
    "the solutions are : @xmath292 for these , the analysis above goes through as before , with similar conclusions .",
    "it is not known what the significance of such solutions might be in this context , but their existence is worth remarking upon , especially since ( as noted in ref.@xcite ) all the solutions asymptote to them at large negative @xmath8 , and so they may capture some universal aspects of the physics in this regime .",
    "we make a further observation about these solutions in the next section .",
    "as we ve seen , the basic organizing object in the theory for much of our considerations has been the loop operator @xmath248 , which is the first integral of the diagonal of the resolvent @xmath293 .",
    "we have studied it in the presence of d  branes ( and fluxes ) in the background , which enters the matrix model string equations in a natural way , again in terms of the resolvent @xmath294 , now in terms of the fixed background parameter @xmath11 and multiplied by @xmath3 .",
    "it is natural that the loop expectation value @xmath248 is controlled by the same object that we use to place d  branes ( and fluxes , for type 0a ) into the the background , and one might wonder if this relation can be made more precise .",
    "can one express the open string background as a specific combination of the existing closed string operators ?",
    "if so , this would be a clear example of the interchangeability of closed and open string descriptions of a given background , perhaps the sharpest demonstration of open  closed duality .",
    "in fact , it can be done@xcite , and it may be illustrative of the correct language to use for other examples .",
    "let us describe this using the equivalent microscopic loop operator language .",
    "the object @xmath295 can be expanded in terms of the microscopic scaling operators @xmath296 and hence the laplace transformed operator can be written : @xmath297 insertion of operator @xmath298 is equivalent to differentiation with respect to the coupling @xmath299 : @xmath300 it was shown long ago@xcite that the purely closed string theory ( @xmath301 ) is equivalent to the following constraints on @xmath302 : @xmath303 where @xmath304 which form a virasoro algebra : @xmath305=(n - m)l_{n+m}\\ .\\ ] ] note that the @xmath306 constraint , after taking a derivative , is equivalent to the string equation  ( [ eq : nonpert ] ) : @xmath307 leading to @xmath308 where we have used the first integral of the kdv flows  ( [ eq : kdvflows ] ) , in the form : @xmath309    the structure of these equations become even more natural when one expresses it in conformal field theory language . there is a @xmath13twisted boson with mode expansion : @xmath310 the virasoro generators are then modes of the stress tensor of this boson , acting on a state for which the creation and annihilation operators act by multiplication and derivation : @xmath311 such states are coherent states : @xmath312 and the partition function defines a special state @xmath313 in the fock space of @xmath314 : @xmath315 it is clear now from equation  ( [ eq : loopmicro ] ) and equation  ( [ eq : modeexpansion ] ) that our loop operator is the twisted boson@xcite : @xmath316 the square root branch cut we studied earlier realizing the @xmath13twist .",
    "the real bonus comes when we see how naturally the non  zero @xmath11 and",
    "@xmath3 case fits into this formalism@xcite .",
    "the microscopic loop equations are : @xmath317 where @xmath318 in particular , if we use that the resolvent @xmath319 has an expansion in terms of the gelfand ",
    "dikii polynomials as @xmath320 the first constraint is equivalent to equation  ( [ eq : nonpertbos ] ) , ( the rest following from the kdv flows ) if the following relation is true : @xmath321 which is equivalent to@xcite : @xmath322 this relation is a preparation of a specific combination of closed string operators , shifting the background . but from our studies in earlier sections , we know that this background corresponds to d  branes in an expansion in large positive @xmath4 , and fluxes for type 0a in the large negative @xmath4 limit .    in fact , the virasoro constraints  ( [ eq : openloops ] ) with shifted virasoro operators  ( [ eq : openvirasoro ] ) are precisely those of a vertex operator of weight @xmath323 , @xmath324 and the pleasingly simple relation can be derived@xcite : @xmath325    finally , note that the weight of the vertex operator is @xmath323 .",
    "the weight of the twisted boson itself is @xmath326 .",
    "this means that when @xmath327 , the combined wavefunction given in equation  ( [ eq : tauopen ] ) comprising the partition function will have vanishing weight , as can be seen by looking at the @xmath328 case of equation  ( [ eq : openvirasoro ] ) and  ( [ eq : constraints ] ) . we do not know the significance of this , but it is of note that for this case there is a special exact non  perturbative solution of the string equation  ( [ eq : nonpert ] ) for any value of @xmath26 , as displayed in equation  ( [ eq : exact ] )",
    ". it would be interesting to explore the role of this solution further .",
    "note that , for given @xmath26 , there are @xmath329 solutions of this type , with @xmath330 , @xmath331 , and the weight of the partition function then reduces to the interesting quantity , @xmath332 .",
