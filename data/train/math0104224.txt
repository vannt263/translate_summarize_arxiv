    "takahashi manifolds are closed orientable 3-manifolds introduced in @xcite by dehn surgery on @xmath0 , with rational coefficients , along the @xmath1-component link @xmath2 depicted in figure [ fig . 1 ] .",
    "these manifolds have been intensively studied in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . in the latter two papers , a nice topological characterization of all takahashi manifolds as two - fold coverings of @xmath0 , branched over the closure of certain rational 3-string braids ,",
    "is given .",
    "yielding @xmath3 . ]    a takahashi manifold is called _ periodic _ when the surgery coefficients have the same cyclic symmetry of order @xmath4 of the link @xmath2 , i.e. the coefficients are @xmath5 and @xmath6 alternately .",
    "several important classes of 3-manifolds , such as ( fractional ) fibonacci manifolds @xcite and sieradsky manifolds @xcite , represent notable examples of periodic takahashi manifolds .    in this paper",
    "we show that each periodic takahashi manifold is an @xmath4-fold cyclic covering of the connected sum of two lens spaces , branched over a knot .",
    "this knot arises from a component of the borromean rings , by performing a surgery with coefficients @xmath5 and @xmath6 along the other two components .    for particular values of the surgery coefficients ( including the classes of manifolds cited above ) ,",
    "the periodic takahashi manifolds turn out to be @xmath4-fold cyclic coverings of @xmath0 , branched over two - bridge knots of genus one , whose parameters are obtained using kirby - rolfsen calculus @xcite ( compare the analogous result of @xcite , obtained by a different approach ) .",
    "observe that in @xcite a characterization of all periodic takahashi manifolds as @xmath4-fold cyclic coverings of @xmath0 , branched over the closure of certain rational 3-string braids , is presented , but the result is incorrect , as we show in remark 1 .",
    "for many interesting periodic takahashi manifolds - including the ones corresponding to branched cyclic coverings of @xmath0 - a cyclic presentation for the fundamental group is provided and proved to be geometric , i.e. arising from a heegaard diagram , or , equivalently , from a canonical spine @xcite .",
    "we denote by @xmath7 the takahashi manifold obtained by dehn surgery on @xmath0 along the @xmath1-component link @xmath2 of figure [ fig . 1 ] , with surgery coefficients @xmath8 respectively , cyclically associated to the components of @xmath9 .",

    "a balanced presentation of the fundamental group of every takahashi manifold is given in @xcite , and in @xcite it is shown that this presentation is geometric , i.e. it arises from a heegaard diagram ( or , equivalently , from a canonical spine ) . as a consequence , @xmath35 admits the following geometric presentation with @xmath1 generators and @xmath1 relators : @xmath36 where the subscripts are mod @xmath1 .        if @xmath42 then @xmath43 is homeomorphic to the connected sum of @xmath4 copies of @xmath44 , and therefore the statement is straightforward . if @xmath45 , the presentation becomes @xmath46 figure [ fig .",
