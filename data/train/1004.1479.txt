    "new data of decay branches @xmath3 and @xmath4 were obtained a few years ago in the na48 experiment @xcite . in analysis of these data a number of theoretical models was used @xcite .",
    "one of them is chiral perturbation theory with weak static interactions @xcite which take into account fermion loops . in this paper",
    ", we upgrade this result in order to study the relation between the decay branches and form factors .    in transitions @xmath0 and @xmath1 the main role is played by one virtual photon exchange : @xmath5 . to describe it",
    ", we must use the theory of strong interactions ( qcd ) and the electroweak theory . instead of qcd",
    "we use chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) supposing a contribution of baryon loops in form factors @xcite . to apply electroweak interactions , we use chpt in bosonization form and take into account the meson electromagnetic form factors and their resonance nature .",
    "main difference of the present paper from other approaches ( for example @xcite ) is that we have only one coupling constant ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "nevertheless , if we take experimentally determined charge radii of mesons and resonances , our prediction becomes more accuracy .",
    "we can conclude that the chiral effective lagrangian approach help us to obtain the set of relations between experimental form factors and decay branches .    in this article",
    ", we ameliorate amplitudes from @xcite , calculate the corresponding decay rates and test them with available experiments .",
    "we start with lagrangian of weak interactions in bosonized form @xcite : @xmath7 @xmath8\\cos\\theta_{c}\\,+[j^4_{\\mu}{\\pm}ij^5_{\\mu}]\\,\\sin\\theta_{c},\\ ] ] where cabbibo angle @xmath9 . using the gell - mann matrices @xmath10",
    "one can define the meson current as @xcite : @xmath11 @xmath12 here @xmath13 . in the first orders in mesons one can write @xmath14 and @xmath15    this lagrangian allows us to use the instantaneous weak interaction model @xcite .",
    "in this section we briefly remind the results of the paper @xcite , which we will use in our work .",
    "further discussions can be find in paper @xcite .    according to @xcite , for the process @xmath0",
    "we have diagrams shown in fig.[diagrams ] , leading to the amplitude : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the effective parameter of enhancement @xcite , @xmath19 @xmath20 is leptonic current and @xmath21 here @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are phenomenological meson form factors denoted by fat dots in fig.[diagrams ] ( a , b , e , f ) and ( c , d , g , h ) , respectively .    on the mass shell the sum ( [ amplitudedepending ] ) takes the form : @xmath25    in case of @xmath1",
    "there are not diagrams fig.[diagrams ] ( a - d ) and in the amplitude ( [ amplitudebegin ] ) instead of @xmath6 should be @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "these amplitudes leads to the decay rate @xcite @xmath27 where @xcite @xmath28 \\lambda(a , b , c)=a^2+b^2+c^2 - 2(ab+bc+ca ) , \\\\ [ 0.3 cm ] \\bar{\\gamma}_{k^+ \\rightarrow \\pi^+ l^+ l^-}=1.37\\cdot10^{-19 } \\ ; mev , \\end{array}\\ ] ] and @xcite @xmath29 \\end{array}\\ ] ] @xmath30 = \\dfrac{(4 \\pi f^2_\\pi)^2}{q^2 } \\left(\\dfrac{f^{a}_{k}(q^{2})+f^{a}_{\\pi}(q^{2})}{2 } - f^{v}_{\\pi}(q^{2})+ \\left(f^{v}_{k}(q^{2})- f^{v}_{\\pi}(q^{2})\\right)\\dfrac{m_\\pi^2}{m_k^2-m_\\pi^2}\\right ) \\end{array } \\label{phi}\\ ] ] thus , chpt and instantaneous weak interaction model leads to formulas ( [ decayrate ] ) and ( [ phi ] ) as relationship between decay rates and formfactors .",
    "one can make an assumption that electromagnetic form factors of the kaon and pion are saturated with resonances as in the @xmath31-dominance model .",
    "one of possible models of such the suturation is chpt with both meson and baryon loops @xcite , so in @xcite at small @xmath32 they were chosen in the form @xmath33 we can calculate decay rates using the resonances @xcite : @xmath34 and pion loop contribution : @xmath35 @xmath36    let us make two remarks at this point .    first , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are nothing but electromagnetic form factors of the charged pion and kaon , but we know them much better from experiment@xcite .",
    "so we can prove @xmath39 using experimental data . at @xmath40 : @xmath41 @xmath42 of course , in @xmath43 the @xmath44 term",
    "is already included . to retrieve @xmath44 ( and nontrivial @xmath32-dependence ) , expand it in series near zero : @xmath45 subtract ( [ pionloopnearzero ] ) from ( [ formfactornearzero ] ) and add ( [ pionloop ] ) : @xmath46    at large @xmath32 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 have maximum at @xmath49 .",
    "second , beside @xmath50 there is : @xmath51 if @xmath52 is not taken into account , a huge discrepancy with experiment results will be got .    finally , using ( [ mrhoma ] ) , ( [ pionloop ] ) , ( [ radiusplus ] ) , ( [ formfactorplusnearzero ] ) , ( [ ma ] )",
