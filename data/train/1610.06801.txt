    "having seen how a simplicial set may be used to model an @xmath10-category , it is natural to ask how a simplicial set might model an @xmath12-category . a reasonable idea",
    "would be interpret the 2-simplices as inhabited by not necessarily invertible 2-cells pointing in a consistent direction .",
    "the problem with this is that the 2-simplices need to play a dual role : they must also witness composition of 1-simplices , in which case it does not make sense to think of them as inhabited by non - invertible cells .",
    "the idea is to mark as `` thin '' the witnesses for composition and then demand that these marked 2-simplices behave as 2-dimensional equivalences in a sense that can be intuited from the preceding three diagrams .",
    "then 3-simplices can be thought of as witnesses for composition of not - necessarily thin 2-simplices .",
    "for instance , given a pair of 2-simplices @xmath38 and @xmath33 with boundary as displayed below , the idea is to build a @xmath41$]-horn @xmath42 whose 0th face is a thin filler of the @xmath40$]-horn formed by @xmath43 and @xmath6",
    ". the 2nd face , defined by filling the horn @xmath41$]-horn , defines a composite 2-simplex , which is witnessed by the ( thin ) 3-simplex .",
    "note that because the 0th face is thin , its 1st edge is interpreted as a composite @xmath44 of @xmath43 and @xmath6 , which is needed so that the boundary of the new 2-cell agrees with the boundary of the pasted composite of @xmath33 and @xmath38 .",
    "since the 3-simplex should be thought of as a witness to a composition relation involving the 2-simplices that make up its boundary , the three simplex should also be regarded as `` thin . ''",
    "a similar @xmath31$]-horn can be used to define composites where the domain of @xmath38 is the last , rather than the first , edge of the codomain of @xmath33 .",
    "it is in this way that simplicial sets with certain marked simplices are used to model @xmath12-categories or indeed @xmath0-categories for any @xmath13 $ ] .",
    "we now formally introduce _ stratified simplicial sets _ before stating the axioms that define these _ complicial sets_.      we have seen that for a simplicial set to model an infinite - dimensional category with non - invertible morphisms in each dimension , it should have a distinguished set of `` thin '' @xmath4-simplices witnessing composition of @xmath45-simplices .",
    "degenerate simplices are always thin in this sense .",
    "furthermore , the intuition that the `` thin '' simplices are the equivalences , in a sense that is made precise in  [ part : saturation ] , suggests that certain 1-simplices might also be marked as thin .",
