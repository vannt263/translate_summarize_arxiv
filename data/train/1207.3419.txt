    "the numerical solutions of helmholtz problems have been an area of active research for almost half of a century . because of the well known pollution effect , the standard galerkin finite element methods can maintain a desired level of accuracy only if the mesh resolution is also appropriately increased . in order to remedy this problem and to obtain more stable and accurate approximation , numerous nonstandard methods have been proposed recently ( cf .",
    "one type of methods applies the stabilized discrete variational form to approximate the helmholtz equation , which includes galerkin - least - squares finite element methods @xcite , quasi - stabilized finite element methods @xcite , absolutely stable discontinuous galerkin ( dg ) methods @xcite and continuous interior penalty finite element methods ( cip - fem ) @xcite .",
    "other approaches include the partition of unity finite element methods @xcite , the ultra weak variational formulation @xcite , plane wave dg methods @xcite , spectral methods @xcite , generalized galerkin / finite element methods @xcite , meshless methods @xcite , and the geometrical optics approach @xcite .",
    "discontinuous galerkin methods have several attractive features compared with conforming finite element methods .",
    "for example , the polynomial degrees can be different from element to element , and they work well on arbitrary meshes . for the helmholtz equation , the interior penalty discontinuous galerkin methods ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) and the local discontinuous galerkin methods @xcite perform much better than the standard finite element methods , and they are well posed without any mesh constraint . despite all these advantages , the dimension of the approximation dg space is much larger than the dimension of the corresponding classical conforming space .",
    "the hybridizable discontinuous galerkin methods were recently introduced to try to address this issue .",
    "the hdg methods retain the advantages of the standard dg methods and result in a significant reduced degrees of freedom .",
    "new variables on the boundary of elements are introduced such that the solution inside each element can be computed in terms of them . in particular , element by element , volume degrees of freedom can be parameterized by the surface degrees , and the resulting algebraic system is only due to the unknowns on the skeleton of the mesh . for a comprehensive understanding of the hdg methods",
    ", we can refer to @xcite for a unified framework for second order elliptic problems and to @xcite for the implementations .    in @xcite ,",
    "the authors give error estimates of the hdg method for the interior dirichlet problem for the helmholtz equation , but it is under the condition that @xmath4 and @xmath5 are sufficiently small , where @xmath6 is a constant which is dependent on @xmath1 but is not characterized explicitly , and @xmath7 depend on the parameters defined in the numerical fluxes . motivated by this work , the primary objective of this paper is to analyze the explicit dependence of convergence of hdg method for the helmholtz equation on @xmath8 and @xmath3 . in this paper , we consider the helmholtz equation with robin boundary condition which is the first order approximation of the radiation condition : @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 is a polygonal / polyhedral domain , @xmath12 is known as the wave number , @xmath13 denotes the imaginary unit , and @xmath14 denotes the unit outward normal to @xmath15 .",
    "the main difficulty of analyzing the helmholtz equation lies in the strong indefiniteness of the problem which makes it hard to establish the stability for the numerical approximation . for the hdg method",
    ", we use a duality argument to obtain the stability estimates of the numerical solution . in the analysis ,",
    "a crucial step lies in the derivation of the dependence of convergence on @xmath3 .",
    "we utilize the explicit error estimates of @xmath16 projection operator ( see lemma [ lemma34 ] ) to overcome this problem . then we obtain that the hdg method for the helmholtz problem ( [ hem])-([robin ] ) attains a unique solution for any @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "furthermore , the stability results not only guarantee the well - posedness of the hdg method but also play a key role in the derivation of the error estimates .    the duality argument can not be directly applied to establish the error estimates .",
    "thus , we first construct an auxiliary problem and show its hdg error estimates by the duality technique .",
    "then , combining the stability estimates , the error estimates of hdg scheme for the original helmholtz problem ( [ hem])-([robin ] ) are deduced .",
    "let @xmath19 and @xmath20 be the hdg approximation to @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively .",
    "we obtain the following results :    \\(i ) the following stability and error estimates hold without any constraint : @xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "we use notations @xmath29 and @xmath30 for the inequalities @xmath31 and @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is a positive number independent of the mesh size , polynomial degree and wave number @xmath1 , but the value of which can take on different values in different occurrences .",
    "\\(ii ) suppose @xmath34 , there hold the following improved results : @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37 comparing to the estimates in @xmath38-ipdg method for helmholtz problem , we find that the condition for the above improved results weakens the mesh condition @xmath39 which is requested in @xcite .",
    "for the estimates under the mesh condition @xmath40 , the results in ( i ) can not be directly applied , but we may still get the following improved estimates .",
    "\\(iii ) suppose @xmath40 , there hold @xmath41 @xmath42    we remark that in this work the _ local stabilization parameter _ to determine the numerical flux in the hdg scheme is always selected as @xmath43 ( see ( [ numerical - flux ] ) ) .",
    "our numerical results show that the predicted convergence rates are observed .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : we precisely define the hdg method for the helmholtz equation and give some notations in the next section .",
