    "wormholes are handles or tunnels in spacetime connecting different regions of our universe or different universes altogether . that wormholes could be actual structures suitable for interstellar travel was first proposed by morris and thorne @xcite .",
    "such a wormhole could be described by the static spherically symmetric line element @xcite @xmath0 using units in which @xmath1 . here",
    "@xmath2 is called the _ redshift function _ , which must be everywhere finite to avoid an event horizon .",
    "the function @xmath3 helps determine the spatial shape of the wormhole and is therefore called the _ shape",
    "function_. the spherical surface @xmath4 is the _ throat _ of the wormhole and must satisfy the following conditions : @xmath5 , @xmath6 for @xmath7 , and @xmath8 , now usually called the _ flare - out condition_. this condition refers to the flaring out of the embedding diagram pictured in ref .",
    "the flare - out condition can only be satisfied by violating the null energy condition .",
    "the einstein field equations in the orthonormal frame , @xmath9 , yield the following simple interpretation for the components of the stress - energy tensor : @xmath10 , the energy density , @xmath11 , the radial pressure , and @xmath12 , the lateral pressure . for the theoretical construction of the wormhole , morris and thorne then proposed the following strategy : retain complete control over the geometry by specifying the functions @xmath13 and @xmath14 to obtain the desired properties of the wormhole .",
    "the problem with this strategy is that it relies on the engineering team to manufacture or search for those materials or fields that yield the required stress - energy tensor .",
    "this purely geometric approach can be supplemented by an appropriate equation of state , an example of which is @xmath15 , @xmath16 , representing phantom dark energy @xcite .",
    "the energy density may also be known for physical reasons , as in the case of the navarro - frenk - white density profile for dark matter @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the characteristic scale radius and @xmath19 is the corresponding density .    in this paper we consider another equation of state , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , representing chaplygin gas or , more generally , @xmath22 @xmath23 , called generalized chaplygin gas @xcite .",
    "cosmologists became interested in this model when it was shown that chaplygin gas is a candidate for unifying dark matter and dark energy . to see this , consider the energy conservation equation @xmath24 in a flat flrw spacetime and then substitute @xmath25 .",
    "the result is @xmath26 where @xmath27 is an integration constant .",
    "it is seen that @xmath28 at early times , implying that @xmath29 behaves like matter , while in later times it behaves like a cosmological constant ( @xmath30 .    in a cosmological setting one",
    "would normally assume a homogeneous distribution of matter .",
    "it was pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , however , that the generalized chaplygin equation of state is that of a polytropic gas with a negative polytropic index . thus inhomogeneous structures may arise from a density fluctuation in the cosmological background .",
    "also , a born - infeld phantom gravastar has been constructed by replacing the interior de sitter solution with the chaplygin gas equation of state @xcite .",
    "a similar problem arises with another type of dark energy , phantom dark energy . here",
    "sushkov and kim @xcite have shown that away from the throat the radial and transverse pressures converge fairly quickly .",
    "accordingly , we will follow refs . @xcite and assume that the equation of state is @xmath31 the tangential pressure can be determined from the einstein field equations .    to obtain a complete wormhole solution",
    ", we are going to make the additional assumption that our spacetime admits a one - parameter group of conformal motions , i.e. , conformal killing vectors , discussed next .",
    "as noted above , we assume that our spacetime admits a one - parameter group of conformal motions , which are motions along which the metric tensor of a spacetime remains invariant up to a scale factor .",
    "in other words , there exists a set of conformal killing vectors such that @xmath32 where the left - hand side is the lie derivative of the metric tensor and @xmath33 is the conformal factor .",
    "the vector @xmath34 characterizes the conformal symmetry since the metric tensor @xmath35 is conformally mapped into itself along @xmath34 .",
    "the assumption of conformal symmetry has led to numerous new solutions , as well as new geometric and kinematical insights @xcite .",
    "given a noncommutative - geometry background , exact solutions of traversable wormholes admitting conformal motions are discussed in ref .",
    "two earlier studies assumed a _",
    "non - static _ conformal symmetry @xcite .    as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we use the following form of the metric to discuss conformal symmetry : @xmath36 the einstein field equations are :    @xmath37+\\frac{1}{r^2}= 8\\pi \\rho,\\ ] ]    @xmath38-\\frac{1}{r^2}= 8\\pi p_r,\\ ] ]    and    @xmath39 = 8\\pi p_t.\\ ] ]    eq .",
    "( [ e : einstein3 ] ) can actually be obtained from the conservation of the stress - energy tensor , i.e. , @xmath40 .",
    "so we need to use only eqs .",
    "( [ e : einstein1 ] ) and ( [ e : einstein2 ] ) .    to discuss the assumption of conformal symmetry in eq .",
    "( [ e : lie ] ) , we follow herrera and ponce de len @xcite and restrict the vector field by requiring that @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the four - velocity of the perfect fluid distribution .",
    "the assumption of spherical symmetry then yields @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "( [ e : lie ] ) now produces the following results : @xmath44 @xmath45 and @xmath46 these equations , in turn , yield @xmath47 and @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are integration constants . in order to make use of these equations , it is convenient to write eqs .",
    "( [ e : einstein1 ] ) and ( [ e : einstein2 ] ) in the following forms : @xmath51 and @xmath52",
    "to obtain a wormhole solution , we start with the equation of state ( [ e : chaplygin ] ) , @xmath53 , and substitute eqs .",

    "we can thereby obtain @xmath60.\\ ] ]    before considering a possible solution , observe that by comparing eqs .",
    "( [ e : line1 ] ) and ( [ e : line2 ] ) , we have in view of eq .",
    "( [ e : grr ] ) , @xmath61 so to obtain @xmath13 , eq .",
    "( [ e : diff3 ] ) must be solved for @xmath62 . to satisfy the condition @xmath5 , we must have @xmath63 , which becomes the initial condition for eq .",
    "( [ e : diff3 ] ) . moreover , since @xmath64 by eq .",
    "( [ e : diff2 ] ) , we also have @xmath65 , so that @xmath66 .    to check the flare - out condition @xmath8",
    ", we obtain from eqs .",
    "( [ e : shape1 ] ) and ( [ e : diff3 ] ) , @xmath67 so to meet the flare - out condition , the constant @xmath57 from the chaplygin equation of state must satisfy the inequality @xmath68 which agrees with refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "now we turn our attention to eq .",
    "( [ e : diff3 ] ) , recalling the initial condition @xmath63 .",
    "since this equation does not have a closed - form solution , we will use a numerical approach . to do so , we choose an arbitrary value for @xmath4 and some values of @xmath57 and @xmath69 that satisfy the above conditions .",
    "it becomes apparent immediately that the solution for @xmath13 is independent of the integration constant @xmath50 .",
    "the reason for this can be seen by writing eqs .",
    "( [ e : diff3 ] ) and ( [ e : shape1 ] ) in the following respective forms : @xmath70 '     = \\frac{1}{r }     \\left[1-\\left(\\frac{\\psi}{a}\\right)^2     -\\left(\\frac{a(8\\pi)^{\\alpha + 1 }     r^{2(\\alpha + 1)}}{1 - 3(\\psi / a)^2 }     \\right)^{1/\\alpha}\\right]\\ ] ] and @xmath71.\\ ] ] so the solutions of eqs .",
    "( [ e : diff3 ] ) and ( [ e : diff4 ] ) have the same qualitative forms .",
    "( in other words , by rescaling @xmath72 , the constant @xmath50 could be eliminated . )    the plots for @xmath73 and @xmath13 , using some typical values of the parameters , are shown in fig .",
    "1 . for any particular choice of @xmath57 ,",
    "the     and @xmath74 are defined on the interval @xmath75$].,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    function @xmath73 becomes zero for some @xmath76 and hence negative for @xmath77 .",
    "since the corresponding function @xmath72 is now imaginary , @xmath3 is undefined for @xmath77 .",
    "( observe that @xmath78 , as shown in fig . 1 ; also , @xmath6 for @xmath79 .",
    ")    we conclude that the wormhole material is confined to some interval @xmath75 $ ] .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with refs .",
    "@xcite , which state that the dimensions of the wormhole can not be arbitrarily large .    as a final comment , while the length of the interval @xmath75 $ ] is independent of @xmath50 , it does depend on @xmath57 : the closer @xmath57 is to the upper limit @xmath80 , the closer @xmath81 is to unity and hence the smaller the interval @xmath75 $ ] ; this behavior can also be seen from fig . 1 .",
    "we see from eq . ( [ e : gtt ] ) , @xmath82 , that the wormhole spacetime can not be asymptotically flat",
    ". normally one would now introduce an extra requirement by stating that the wormhole material has to be cut off at some @xmath83 and joined to an exterior schwarzschild solution @xmath84 since the need for a cut - off is already known from the previous section , we are not dealing with a new requirement .",
    "unfortunately , the previous cut - off at @xmath76 can not be used here because @xmath78 .",
    "instead , we need to choose some @xmath85",
    ". we can therefore complete the wormhole solution by noting that @xmath86 so for @xmath87 , we have @xmath88 and the integration constant becomes @xmath89    the need for a cut - off at @xmath85 , due to the coordinate singularity at @xmath76 , is consistent with refs .",
    "@xcite , which consist of a detailed investigation of the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff equations for chaplygin and generalized chaplygin gas , respectively .",
    "the main conclusion in these studies is much more general in the sense that the scalar curvature was found to become singular at some finite distance ; moreover , the universe is not asymptotically flat . that our wormhole spacetime can not be arbitrarily large",
    "was also shown in ref .",
    "@xcite without relying on conformal symmetry .",
    "however , in the present study , conformal symmetry is needed to determine the redshift function ( to obtain a complete wormhole solution ) but not for the wormhole solutions in refs .",
    "for the theoretical construction of a traversable wormhole , morris and thorne proposed the following strategy : retain complete control over the geometry by choosing functions @xmath14 and @xmath13 that yield the desired properties , thereby leaving the components of the stress - energy tensor unspecified . in this paper",
    "we obtained a complete wormhole solution by ( 1 ) adopting the equation of state @xmath53 representing generalized chaplygin gas and ( 2 ) assuming that the wormhole admits a one - parameter group of conformal motions .",
    "these two assumptions complement each other via the requirement that the wormhole spacetime must be cut off at some @xmath90 and joined to an exterior vacuum solution .",
