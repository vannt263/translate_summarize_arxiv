    "a variety of active and high energy phenomena are seen in the direction towards the galactic center over a broad range of wavelengths .",
    "it is well established that the center of our galaxy , sagittarius ( sgr ) a@xmath2 , is a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) with a mass of @xmath5 ( genzel et al .",
    "1997 ; schdel et al .",
    "2003 ) , and a number of models have been proposed to explain the radiation and its spectral energy distribution ( sed ) from sgr a@xmath2 by accretion of matter onto it ( see baganoff et al .",
    "2003 for a review and comparison to x - ray observations ) .",
    "the concept of radiatively inefficient accretion flow ( riaf ) is theoretically well - motivated based on the physics of accretion flows , and models based on the riaf picture have successfully been applied to many low accretion rate systems with @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the eddington mass accretion rate ( narayan & quataert 2005 for a review ) .",
    "sgr a@xmath2 is one of the best studied examples , and the model of yuan , quataert , & narayan ( 2003 , 2004 , hereafter yqn03 and yqn04 , respectively ) can reproduce the observed sed of sgr a@xmath2 in a wide range of wavelengths from radio to x - ray bands .",
    "an important ingredient of this model is that the accretion rate decreases with decreasing radius from the smbh , indicating a significant mass loss by a magnetically driven outflow or wind .",
    "this is necessary to make the model consistent with observations , and such wind activities are also supported by recent numerical simulations ( yqn03 and references therein ) .",
    "though this model can explain the sed of sgr a@xmath2 at present , there are several lines of evidence for higher activities in the galactic center in the past , such as much higher x - ray luminosity and mass outflows ( see  [ section : past - activity ] for a brief review ) .",
    "hence , it is interesting to examine whether these lines of evidence can consistently be explained by changing the accretion rate within the framework of the riaf model .",
    "the first aim of this paper is to show that it is indeed possible , and i also discuss whether such a high accretion rate is reasonable in the environment of the galactic center , as well as the cause of the sudden decrease leading to the current low rate .    the 511 kev electron - positron annihilation line emission in the galaxy has been observed for a long time ( kndlseder et al .",
    "2005 and references therein ) , and the latest observation by the integral gamma - ray observatory revealed that the all sky distribution is dominated by the extended bulge component ( @xmath8 fwhm ) , with a weak evidence for the disk component ( kndlseder et al .",
    "although the disk component can be explained by positron emission from radioactive nuclei produced in supernovae , the origin of the bulge component is still a mystery",
    ". a positron production rate of @xmath9 is required to explain the bulge component .",
    "a number of candidates have been proposed for the origin of the bulge component , but the large bulge - to - disk ratio excludes many of them related to recent star formation activities , leaving type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) and low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) as the primary candidates ( kndlseder et al . 2005 ) . however , about one order of magnitude higher rate of bulge sne ia than the best estimate is required to explain the observed annihilation rate ( prantzos 2006 ) .",
    "the positron production rate from lmxbs or microquasars is highly uncertain and might be sufficient ( guessoum et al .",
    "2006 ) , but the bulge - to - disk ratio of lmxbs is considerably lower than that of the 511 kev data .",
    "most of the positrons produced in microquasars are probably lost by annihilation before injection into interstellar medium ( ism ) ( guessoum et al .",
    "2006 ) , and direct annihilation gamma - ray emission from the sources would be inconsistent with the diffuse gamma - ray background around mev band ( see  [ section : background - radiation ] ) .",
    "annihilation of dark matter particles with a mass of @xmath3 mev is another possible solution , but such a particle is not naturally predicted by the particle physics theory , in contrast to the well - motivated candidates such as the supersymmetric particles that are much more massive ( @xmath10 gev , bertone et al .",
    "furthermore , the upper limit on 511 kev line flux from the sagittarius dwarf galaxy excludes this scenario for almost all types of the halo density profile ( kndlseder et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "the second aim of this paper is to show that , if the past accretion rate onto sgr a@xmath2 was in fact higher than now with the rate and duration inferred from the observational evidence mentioned above , the riaf model of sgr a@xmath2 gives a natural explanation for the bulge 511 kev line emission .",
    "there are models of positron production by accretion activity of sgr a@xmath2 ( titarchuk & chardonnet 2006 ; cheng , chernyshov , & dogiel 2006 ) , but the model proposed here is vastly different from these and it gives a more natural explanation for the 511 kev line (  [ section : comparison ] ) .    a variety of phenomena on various scales around the galactic center will be discussed in this paper , and these are summarized in schematic diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : schem ] for the reader s convenience .",
    "the summary of various comparison between observations and the model is given in table [ table : summary ] .",
    "starting from a brief description about the riaf model of sgr a@xmath2 (  [ section : riaf ] ) , i review and summarize the lines of evidence for the past increased activity of sgr a@xmath2 , and present riaf interpretations for these , in  [ section : past - activity ] .",
    "we discuss the physical origin of the past high activity in the galactic center environment in  [ section : origin ] .",
    "then i calculate the positron production rate around the event horizon of sgr a@xmath2 in  [ section : production ] , and consider the ejection from sgr a@xmath2 (  [ section : ejection ] ) and propagation in ism (  [ section : propagation ] ) . in ",
    "[ section : discussion ] , i compare my model with the other models of the 511 kev emission , and discuss about future observational tests of this model .",
    "i apply 8 kpc as the distance to the galactic center ( eisenhauer et al .",
    "the yqn03 model is a one - dimensional , global riaf model that can reproduce the sed of sgr a@xmath2 .",
    "though detailed three - dimensional structure is not taken into account in this model , models or simulations incorporating more complicated structures have not yet succeeded in reproducing the sgr a@xmath2 sed ( e.g. , mineshige , kusnose , & matsumoto 1995 ; ohsuga , kato , & mineshige 2005 ) . in this paper",
    "i discuss the scaling of the radiation and outflow from sgr a@xmath2 when the accretion rate is changed , and the simple yqn03 model is sufficient and currently the best choice for this purpose .",
    "the accretion rate of the yqn03 model is normalized at the outer boundary corresponding to the bondi radius ( @xmath11 pc ) , which is inferred from the ambient density and temperature of x - ray emitting gas ( baganoff et al .",
    "2003 ) , where @xmath12 is the schwartzshild radius of the smbh .",
    "the size of the extended ( @xmath13 fwhm ) x - ray emission of sgr a@xmath2 ( baganoff et al . 2003 ) nicely corresponds to this radius .",
    "the accretion rate at this radius is @xmath14/yr , where @xmath15 is the dimensionless viscosity parameter and @xmath16 is the bondi accretion rate .",
    "the yqn03 model assumes a radially varying accretion rate , @xmath17 with @xmath18 , based on the adiabatic inflow - outflow solutions ( adios , blandford & begelman 1999 ) rather than the advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf , see kato et al .",
    "1998 ; narayan et al .",
    "1998 for reviews ) that is the simplest riaf solution with a radially constant mass accretion rate .",
    "this modification from adaf is necessary since the adaf model predicts too large density and magnetic field strength in the innermost region , in contradiction with the observational upper bounds on rotation measure .",
    "the accretion flow is quasi - spherical and the density @xmath19 is determined by @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the inflow velocity of the accretion flow . in the self - similar solution of riafs , @xmath21 is close to and proportional to the free fall velocity @xmath22 , and hence @xmath23 . in the yqn03 model ,",
    "the particle density is @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the proton mass , and hence @xmath26 .",
    "this also means @xmath27 .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the evaporated mass flow due to the non - conserving accretion rate is ejected as wind or outflow , whose velocity is comparable with the escape velocity @xmath28 at the region where the wind originates",
    ". then the mass ejection rate per logarithmic interval of radius is @xmath29 , and the largest kinetic energy is produced from the innermost region where @xmath28 is close to the speed of light , @xmath30 .",
    "we denote @xmath31 for the wind production region , and the outflow kinetic energy from this region becomes @xmath32 erg / s , where @xmath33 .",
    "the jet or outflow may also contribute to the sgr a@xmath2 sed , especially in the radio bands ( see discussion of yqn03 ) .",
    "the outflow kinetic energy derived here is in fact comparable with those assumed in the jet models of sgr a@xmath2 ( falcke & biermann 1999 ; yuan , markoff , & falcke 2002 ; le & becker 2004 ) , indicating that this estimate is a reasonable one .",
    "the outflow kinetic power is much larger than the x - ray luminosity of sgr a@xmath2 , which is @xmath34 erg / s in the quiescent state and @xmath35 erg / s in the flaring state .",
    "such a trend of jet - energy dominance is indeed established for black holes in stellar x - ray binaries in the low / hard state ( gallo et al .",
    "2003 , 2005 ) , which is believed to be a state corresponding to riaf ( esin et al . 1997 ) .",
    "in fact , the above kinetic and x - ray luminosities are consistent with the relation inferred for the stellar black hole binaries : @xmath36 with @xmath371 , where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are in units of the eddington luminosity ( gallo et al . 2005 ) . though the mass scale of black holes is quite different , this is expected if ( 1 ) the critical accretion rate in units of the eddington rate ( @xmath40 ) between the standard thin disk and riaf is independent of the black hole mass , ( 2 ) x - ray luminosity scales roughly as @xmath41 in the riaf regime , and ( 3 ) the mass outflow is proportional to @xmath42 .",
    "the first two are indeed the properties of the adaf ( narayan et al .",
    "1998 ) , and the third is in accordance with the radially varying accretion rate assumed in yqn03 .",
    "some active galactic nuclei ( agns ) show the jet activity with much higher speed ( the bulk lorentz factor @xmath43 ) than the above velocity estimate ( @xmath44 , only mildly relativistic with @xmath45 ) .",
    "however , @xmath45 is reasonable for sgr a@xmath2 , since the same trend has been known for the outflows from stellar x - ray binaries in the low / hard state , which are not strongly beamed and not extremely relativistic ( @xmath46 ) , in contrast to those of x - ray transients ( gallo et al .",
    "2003 ; narayan & mcclintock 2005 ) .",
    "there are a few independent lines of evidence that about 300 years ago sgr a@xmath2 was much more luminous than now in the x - ray band .",
    "koyama et al .",
    "( 1996 ) found fluorescent x - ray emission reflected from cold iron atoms in the giant molecular cloud sgr b2 by asca observation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : schem ] ) .",
    "since there is no irradiation source to explain the iron line emission , they suggested a possibility that @xmath3300 yrs ago sgr a@xmath2 was much brighter than now .",
    "more recent studies by murakami et al .",
    "( 2000 , 2001a , b ) found a new x - ray reflection nebula associated with sgr c , and estimated the increased past luminosity of sgr a@xmath2 as @xmath47 erg / s from sgr b2 and c data .",
    "this claim was independently confirmed by an integral observation covering higher energy band of 10100 kev ( revnivtsev et al .",
    "2004 ) ; the asca and integral data of sgr b2 can nicely be fit by a reflection of radiation from sgr a@xmath2 , whose luminosity is @xmath48 erg / s in 2200 kev and spectrum is a power - law with a photon index of @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "`` the ionized halo '' surrounding sgr a@xmath2 with a density @xmath51@xmath52 has been known from radio observations ( pedlar et al . 1989 ; anantharamaiah et al . 1999 ) , and it extends to a radius of @xmath53 pc ( fig .",
    "[ fig : schem ] ) .",
    "maeda et al . ( 2002 ) argued that currently no ionizing source is found for the ionized halo , and the past activity of the sgr a@xmath2 may be responsible for the ionization , requiring an x - ray luminosity of @xmath54 erg / s , a similar flux to those inferred from the x - ray reflection nebulae .",
    "we can then estimate the boost factor of the accretion rate to achieve the x - ray luminosity of @xmath55@xmath56 erg / s in the riaf model .",
    "it should be noted that this luminosity is @xmath57 in units of the eddington luminosity , and hence it is still well within the adaf / riaf regime .",
    "according to fig .",
    "5 of yqn04 , a boost factor @xmath58@xmath59 ( at a fixed radius @xmath60 ) is required to achieve the luminosity of @xmath61@xmath56 erg / s , assuming a constant value for @xmath62 .",
    "the sed in yqn04 with @xmath63 is roughly constant in @xmath64 ( luminosity per logarithmic frequency interval ) in the x - ray band , being consistent with the x - ray spectrum inferred from the x - ray reflection nebula .",
    "then the outflow kinetic luminosity in such a higher activity phase should be @xmath65 erg / s , where @xmath66 . in units of the eddington mass accretion rate , @xmath67 ( corresponding to a radiative efficiency of 0.1 ) ,",
    "the accretion rates at @xmath68 and @xmath69 are @xmath70 and @xmath71 , respectively .",
    "there is evidence for powerful mass outflow from the galactic center on scales from arcminutes to tens of degrees ( fig .",
    "[ fig : schem ] ) .",
    "bland - hawthorn & cohen ( 2003 ) reported the mid - infrared emission from dust expanding in the galactic center lobe ( gcl ) on a few degree scale , and estimated the total kinetic energy as @xmath72 erg with a velocity of @xmath3 100 km / s and a dynamical time of @xmath73 yr .",
    "the size , energy , and time scales are similar to those of the expanding molecular ring ( emr ) around the galactic center ( kaifu et al .",
    "1972 ; scoville 1972 ) .",
    "bland - hawthorn & cohen further argued that this result is consistent with the north polar spur ( nps ) on an even larger scale ( up to tens of degrees ) , which has been interpreted by sofue ( 2000 ) to be an outflow from the galactic center , with an energy scale of @xmath74 erg and a dynamical time scale of @xmath0 yr . the kinetic luminosity inferred from these various observations is in a nice agreement with the estimate for the riaf model with the boost factor of @xmath75 , and hence we can attribute these outflows to the past activity of sgr a@xmath2 that was responsible for the higher x - ray luminosity .",
    "this indicates the duration of @xmath0 yr for the higher activity , which is reasonable compared with various estimates for lifetimes of agns ( martini 2004 )",
    ".    the origin of the outflow from the galactic center may instead be starbursts in the nuclear region , as suggested by bland - hawthorn & cohen ( 2003 ) .",
    "however , observations of gamma - rays from radioactive @xmath76al seem to disfavor the starburst scenario .",
    "the energy of @xmath77 erg in @xmath78 yr is equivalent to @xmath79 supernova per century , almost comparable with the galaxy - wide core - collapse supernova rate of @xmath80 per century ( diehl et al .",
    "2006 ) estimated from the flux of @xmath76al gamma - rays , whose spatial distribution is clearly associated along with the galactic disk .",
    "since the half - life of @xmath76al is @xmath81 yr , @xmath76al can not travel beyond the gcl region with the outflow velocity of @xmath82 km / s .",
    "therefore , if the origin of the outflow is starbursts , we expect a strong @xmath76al gamma - ray emission concentrated within a few degree from the galactic center , with a flux comparable with the total gamma - ray flux along with the disk",
    ". however , such a strong concentration at the galactic center is not found ( prantzos & diehl 1996 ; kndlseder et al .",
    "1999 ) , indicating that the accretion activity of sgr a@xmath2 is more plausible as the origin of the mass outflow .",
    "muno et al .",
    "( 2004 ) studied in detail the chandra data of the diffuse x - ray emission within @xmath83 20 pc of the galactic center , and they concluded that the hard component plasma ( @xmath84 kev , koyama et al .",
    "1989 ; yamauchi et al .",
    "1990 ) can not be explained by unresolved point sources . the latest suzaku observation by koyama et al .",
    "( 2006 ) further strengthened the case for the truly diffuse plasma ( but see also revnivtsev et al .",
    "if it is truly diffuse , it can not be gravitationally bound and requires a large energy input of @xmath85 erg / s to keep this hot plasma , when the escape time is estimated simply by the sound velocity .",
    "this is too large to be explained by supernova explosions and the origin of this hot plasma is still a matter of debate . later in this paper (  [ section : wind - dynamics ] ) , i will discuss in more detail about the consequences of the energy injection into ism by the wind from sgr a@xmath2 , and show that this hot plasma can be explained as a result of shock heating by the wind .",
    "we have shown that all the lines of evidence for the past higher activities of sgr a@xmath2 can be explained if the mean accretion rate in the past @xmath0 yrs is higher than now by a factor of @xmath86 , and sgr a@xmath2 had such a high rate 300 yrs ago .",
    "then the next questions are : ( 1 ) what is the source of the accreting matter during the high activity phase , and ( 2 ) what caused the sudden drop of accretion rate by a factor of @xmath87 on a time scale of just @xmath88 yrs . here",
    "i give reasonable explanations for these .",
    "maeda et al . (",
    "2002 ) proposed that , based on their chandra observation of the supernova remnant sgr a east , the past higher activity was induced by accretion from the dense supernova shell expanding into the ionized halo .",
    "the location of sgr a@xmath2 is in fact inside sgr a east and close to its shell ( fig .",
    "[ fig : schem ] ) . in this scenario",
    "the duration of such high accretion rate is only @xmath89 yr , as inferred from the shell thickness ( @xmath31/10 of the observed shell radius @xmath90 2.9 pc ) and the shell expansion velocity ( @xmath91 200 km / s estimated by a simple theoretical model of supernova remnants ) . for comparison ,",
    "the age estimate of sgr a east is @xmath92 yr . a much higher accretion rate than now is possible by the bondi accretion with the shell density estimated from shock - compression of the gas of the ionized halo .",
    "( the supernova ejecta is negligible at this stage . )    however , according to this scenario , we expect a comparable or even higher accretion rate by accretion directly from the ionized halo before the passage of the sgr a east shell , since the density enhancement by shock - compression is at most by a factor of 4 and the sound velocity of unshocked gas is likely much lower than the shell velocity .",
    "suppose that the smbh is embedded directly in the ionized halo .",
    "the bondi radius in this case could be different from the current estimate ( 0.03 pc ) based on the x - ray observation ( baganoff et al .",
    "2003 ) , since the current gas properties around sgr a@xmath2 have been altered from those of the ionized gas by the passage of the sgr a east shell . the bondi radius in the halo , @xmath93 is larger than 1 pc if the temperature @xmath94 is lower than @xmath3 110 ev , where @xmath95 is the sound velocity in the ionized halo . a plausible temperature of the ionized halo is @xmath79 ev ( maeda et al .",
    "2002 ) , and hence the outer boundary of the accretion flow would not be determined by the bondi radius , but rather by the gravitational radius @xmath96 pc , within which the gravity of the smbh is dominant compared with stars around the smbh ( e.g. , schdel et al . 2003 ) .",
    "then we can extrapolate the yqn03 model from @xmath97 pc out to @xmath98 with the boost factor of @xmath75 and @xmath99 , and the density at @xmath98 becomes @xmath100 .",
    "this is consistent with the density of the ionized halo , @xmath101 , and hence the riaf at the increased accretion rate is naturally connected to the environment surrounding the smbh .",
    "since this is an extrapolation of the riaf solution , the surrounding gas can accrete even if it has a significant angular momentum , because of the angular momentum loss by viscosity .",
    "this is in contrast to the simple picture of the spherical bondi accretion .    in this new scenario ,",
    "the high accretion rate can last for a much longer time scale than @xmath89 yrs , and accretion from the dense supernova shell is no longer necessary .",
    "still , sgr a east must play an important role to explain the sudden drop of the accretion rate @xmath3300 yrs ago , by the destruction of accretion flow when the dense shell passed through the smbh .",
    "it should also be noted that there are the arm - like structures of sgr a west and the circumnuclear disk surrounding it on the scale of @xmath31 pc ( e.g. , yusef - zadeh , melia , & wardle 2000 ; see also fig .",
    "[ fig : schem ] ) , which could be the remnants of the former accretion flow .",
    "we examine the destruction process more quantitatively as follows . since the adaf and adios solutions have a positive bernoulli parameter ( narayan et al . 1998",
    "; blandford & begelman 1999 ) , the flow is not gravitationally bound and change of flow velocity by external force would result in a destruction of the flow",
    ". therefore we should compare the momentum of the flow and the supernova remnant to estimate the effect of the supernova shell passage .",
    "the momentum of the accretion flow is : @xmath102 where we estimated the flow velocity @xmath103 by @xmath104 , since the rotation velocity is negligible when the adiabatic index @xmath105 in adafs ( narayan et al .",
    "the momentum of the supernova remnant given to the flow is : @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the shell kinetic energy of the supernova remnant .",
    "therefore the accretion flow could have been destroyed at @xmath108 pc from the smbh .",
    "destruction should have occurred with a time scale of the shell crossing ( @xmath89 yrs ) , and the accretion time scale at this radius is also @xmath109 yrs .",
    "these time scales are consistent with the required time scale of the accretion rate drop , @xmath110 yrs .",
    "the current low rate may be determined by either the diffuse gas in the supernova remnant , winds from nearby stars ( e.g. , cuadra et al .",
    "2006 ) , or residual of the former accretion flow .",
    "we may ask how the suggested high activity of sgr a@xmath2 in the past compares with those found in nearby normal galaxies , because it would be statistically unlikely if our galaxy had a much higher activity compared with nearby normal galaxies . as reviewed by ho ( 2004 ) ,",
    "nuclear activity is quite commonly found in nearby galaxies .",
    "the yqn model with @xmath111 predicts a nuclear @xmath112-band luminosity of @xmath113 erg / s , and the number density of such galaxies expected from the nuclear luminosity function is @xmath114 , which is similar to that of typical galaxies like our own , where @xmath115 is the hubble constant .",
    "nuclear radio cores with flux of @xmath116@xmath117 at 5 ghz are also commonly found , which is again a similar radio luminosity to that predicted by the yqn04 model with @xmath75 .",
    "therefore , the increased activity of sgr a * is not particularly rare compared with nearby normal galaxies , indicating that the characteristic time scale of the increased activity can be @xmath0 yr or even longer , possibly as long as the cosmological time scale . the accretion rate at the event horizon , i.e.",
    ", the mass growth rate of the smbh is @xmath118 , and the mass growth in 10 gyr is @xmath119 , which is still less than @xmath120 .",
    "agn activity is generally sporadic and showing strong variability , and hence it is naturally expected that the accretion rate was changing significantly always in the past @xmath0 yrs . in fact , the characteristic structures such as gcl , emr , and nps indicate such variability or modulation of the accretion and wind activity .",
    "however , conclusions of this paper are not seriously affected if the mean or characteristic accretion rate is given by @xmath75",
    ".      one may feel uneasy if we are witnessing a large drop of the accretion rate just during @xmath3300 yrs compared with the normal accretion time scale of @xmath0 yrs , indicating an extremely low chance probability of observing sgr a@xmath2 in the present phase : @xmath121 . here",
    "i argue that the actual chance probability is likely to be much larger than this simple estimate .",
    "about 100 young massive stars are known within the central parsec of sgr a@xmath2 ( paumard et al .",
    "some of them are already in the post - main - sequence phase , and the age of this stellar population is estimated as @xmath122 myr .",
    "this indicates a supernova rate of @xmath123 , and the chance probability of observing sgr a@xmath2 within 300 yrs after the shell passage becomes @xmath124 .",
    "this is small , but not extraordinarily small for realization .",
    "the mean accretion rate can be kept at the level of @xmath75 if the accretion rate comes back to the mean level within the typical time interval of supernovae , @xmath125 yrs , after the shell passage .",
    "it is an observational _ fact _ that we are living in a somewhat special time , if the association of sgr a@xmath2 with the sgr a east shell is not just a superposition in the sky but physical .",
    "the age of @xmath126 yrs of sgr a east indicates that the supernova rate within the central parsec of sgr a@xmath2 should be less than @xmath127 .",
    "therefore , the chance probability must be less than @xmath128 , which is just 6 times larger than the above estimate .",
    "therefore i consider that the argument of the chance probability does not seriously weaken the case for the overall picture proposed by this work .",
    "now i consider the pair - production at the region where the wind originates , @xmath31 . during the increased phase ,",
    "the particle accretion rate is @xmath129 and the particle outflow rate per logarithmic radius is @xmath130 .",
    "the particle density in the accretion flow is @xmath131 .",
    "the accretion time spent around this radius is @xmath132 s.    the electron temperature of the yqn03 model is @xmath133 k , and hence relative motion of electrons is sufficiently relativistic at the pair - production region if @xmath134 , with the mean electron lorentz factor @xmath135 in the rest frame of the accretion flow .",
    "the temperature does not heavily depend on the enhancement factor @xmath136 , if the transfer efficiency of viscous heating energy from ions to electrons ( the parameter @xmath137 in yqn03 ) does not change with the accretion rate , as assumed by yqn04 .",
    "it may increase with increasing accretion rate because of higher density and hence more efficient interactions , but the value of @xmath137 assumed in yqn03 is already of order unity ( = 0.55 ) , not leaving much room for the increase of @xmath137 .",
    "the positron density produced in the accretion flow depends on whether the @xmath138 pair production process achieves the equilibrium with the @xmath138 pair annihilation .",
    "this can be evaluated by comparing the pair production rate density @xmath139 and pair annihilation rate density @xmath140 , where @xmath141 is the produced positron density .",

    "if this x - ray luminosity reflects the typical activity averaged over a time scale of @xmath0 yr , we expect that the 511 kev luminosity of the m31 bulge is much fainter than that of the galaxy .",

    "therefore , just a detection of 511 kev emission from a nearby sn ia does not confirm sne ia as the origin of the bulge component , but a close examination of the positron production efficiency would be required .",
    "in this paper , i have shown that the several independent lines of evidence for the past higher activity of the galactic center ( i.e. , higher x - ray luminosity and large scale outflows ) can quantitatively be explained by the riaf model of sgr a@xmath2 , in which energetic outflow plays an essential role .",

    "the chance probability of observing sgr a@xmath2 in such a low activity phase is estimated to be @xmath301% .",
    "i then estimated the production rate of positrons during the high activity phase , which are created in the region around the event horizon and then ejected by the outflow . the rate is found to be comparable with that required to explain the 511 kev line emission toward the galactic bulge .",
    "i considered three processes of @xmath138 pair - production via electron - electron scattering , photon - electron collision , and photon - photon annihilation , and interestingly all the three processes give a similar positron production rate .",
    "therefore the model presented here gives a new and natural explanation for the 511 kev line emission toward the galactic bulge .",
    "the favorable aspects of this model are : ( 1 ) the correct positron production rate , ( 2 ) the large bulge - to - disk ratio and correct spatial extent in the bulge , ( 3 ) ( i ) negligible annihilation near the positron production site before injection into ism , and ( ii ) the injection energy of @xmath3 mev , both of which are important to meet the constraint from the mev gamma - ray background , and ( 4 ) no exotic assumptions or parameters . to my knowledge , the other explanations for the 511 kev emission proposed so far do not satisfy all of these .",
    "anisotropy of the morphology of the 511 kev emission larger than that expected for other models would be a signature for the model proposed here , which might be revealed by future observations with better angular resolutions .",
    "detection of 511 kev lines from centers of nearby galaxies by the same mechanism will be difficult even in the foreseeable future .",
