    "detached eclipsing binaries are fundamental sources of data on the properties of stars ( andersen 1991 ) .",
    "the masses and radii of two stars in a detached eclipsing binary ( deb ) can be empirically determined to accuracies of better than 1% ( e.g. , torres et al .",
    "accurate effective temperatures and absolute magnitudes can be found using empirical photometric calibrations , and the distances to debs can likewise be found to accuracies of 5% without any use of theoretical calculations ( e.g. , clausen 2004 ) .",
    "as the component stars of a deb have the same age , chemical composition and distance , their physical properties provide an important test of the predictions of theoretical stellar evolutionary models .",
    "this test is aided if the stars are quite dissimilar in mass and radius , and if they have evolved away from the main sequence .",
    "unfortunately , as the age and interior chemical abundances of stars are not , in general , observable , stellar models of any chemical composition and age can be compared to the observed data in order to find a good fit .",
    "eclipsing binaries in open clusters provide a way of finding the chemical composition , age or distance of two stars with accurate masses and radii , allowing a much more discriminating test of the physical ingredients of theoretical models , for example the amount of convective core overshooting and mass loss , and the accuracy of the opacities used .",
    "alternatively , the study of a deb in an open cluster can be used to find the chemical composition of the cluster , its age , or its distance , avoiding the use of the technique of fitting theoretical isochrones to the morphology of stars in colour - magnitude diagrams .",
    "southworth , maxted & smalley ( 2004a , hereafter paperi ) studied the early - type well - detached eclipsing binaries v615per and v618per , members of the important young open cluster hpersei .",
    "as the two debs are members of the same stellar group , this allowed the masses and radii of four stars of the same age , chemical composition and distance to be compared to the predictions of theoretical models , a situation not previously achieved . from this procedure the metal abundance of hpersei was found to be @xmath7 , in conflict with previous assumptions that the cluster has an approximately solar chemical composition .",
    "southworth , maxted & smalley ( 2004b , hereafter paperii ) studied the high - mass deb v453cyg , a member of the sparse open cluster ngc6871 .",
    "the masses and radii of this somewhat evolved system ( @xmath8 ) were determined to accuracies of 1.5% .",
    "although the system consists of two quite dissimilar stars ( with radii of 8.55 and 5.49@xmath6 ) , current theoretical models of the granada ( claret 1995 ) , padova ( bressan et al .  1993 ) , geneva ( schaller et al .  1992 ) and cambridge ( pols et al .",
    "1998 ) groups showed an impressive agreement with the stellar properties of v453cyg .",
    "the granada models also agreed well with the central condensation of the primary star derived from analysis of the apsidal motion of the deb .",
    "this good agreement suggests that we must study debs which are more evolved , of higher mass , or more dissimilar in order to assess the success of the different physical ingredients of stellar models .",
    "v621per is a member of the young open cluster @xmath0persei and is more evolved , and composed of more dissimilar stars , than v453cyg .",
    "@xmath0persei is also regarded as a physical relation of hpersei ( paperi ) so a full analysis of this system would allow the simultaneous comparison of the observed masses and radii of six stars ( the components of v615per and v618per , paperi , and v621per , this work ) with theoretical predictions .",
    "v621per ( table  [ photpartable ] ) was discovered to be a deb by krzesiski & pigulski ( 1997 , hereafter kp97 ) from approximately 1200 images , through the broad - band @xmath9 and @xmath10 filters , of the nucleus of @xmath0persei .",
    "the eclipses are total , last for approximately 1.3 days , and are about 0.12mag deep in both @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the ascending and descending branches of one eclipse were observed in @xmath11 on two successive nights but the only other observations during eclipse were 102.1 days earlier , and during totality , so the period could not be determined .",
    "the b2 giant component of v621per is one of the brightest members of @xmath0persei and has been studied several times using high - resolution optical spectroscopy to determine accurate chemical abundances .",
    "lennon , brown & dufton ( 1988 ) derived a normal helium abundance but state that different lines gave different results , which they claim could be due to the high surface gravity used [ @xmath12 ( cms@xmath2 ) ] .",
    "dufton et al .",
    "( 1990 ) found a normal abundance of helium and various metals , but a deficiency of 0.4dex in nitrogen and aluminium .",

    "they also derived a high microturbulent velocity of 9kms@xmath2  ( or 13kms@xmath2  from the o lines ) consistent with evolution away from the main sequence .",
    "it is notable that abundance analyses generally find larger microturbulence velocities than those usually assumed ( see e.g. , dufton , durrant & durrant 1981 ) .",

    "these have been compared to the predictions of the granada stellar evolutionary models ( claret 1995 ; claret & gimnez 1995 , 1998 ) for ages close to the age of the @xmath0persei open cluster , @xmath25myr ( paperi ) .",

    "whilst all three possible metal abundances can fit the two stars for @xmath26 , the @xmath21 predictions provide the best fit to the predicted properties of the secondary component .",
    "this diagram suggests that @xmath22 is probably between 3.55 and 3.60 .",

    "the position of the primary component of v621per in these diagrams suggests that its mass is a little below 12.8@xmath5 , also consistent with the form of the mass  radius diagram ( fig .",
    "[ modelfit ] ) . however , its age derived by comparison with evolutionary models is somewhat greater than the 12.6myr expected due to its membership of @xmath0persei , and the discrepancy is larger compared to the @xmath21 model predictions than for the @xmath27 predictions .",
    "the age of @xmath25myr for @xmath0persei was derived , from comparison between photometric observations of the cluster and the predictions of theoretical models , by researchers who assumed that @xmath27 ( paperi ) . as the metal abundance of @xmath0persei",
    "has been found to be @xmath21 ( paperi ) , this age may have a systematic error .",
    "therefore the age discrepancy found here is of only minor significance , but deserves investigating when more accurate parameters are determined for v621per .",
    "also , the amount of overshooting present in stellar models is known to significantly change the predicted ages of giant stars ( e.g. , schrder & eggleton 1996 ) and the inclusion of rotation also affects the main sequence lifetime of high - mass stars ( maeder & meynet 2000 ) .    from comparison with the granada evolutionary models , the surface gravity of the primary component of v621per is approximately 3.55 .",
    "this conclusion is valid for metal abundances of @xmath21 and 0.02 . from table  [ mrtable ]",
    "the masses and radii of v621per corresponding to @xmath28 are about 12 and 6@xmath5 , and 10 and 3@xmath6 , for primary and secondary star respectively .",
    "this means that the primary star is near the age at which it passes through the ` blue loop ' evolutionary stage ( the point at which core hydrogen exhaustion causes the effective temperature and surface gravity to rise temporarily ) , so accurate masses and radii for it would provide extremely good tests of the predictions of theoretical models .",
    "the granada stellar models predict a luminosity ratio of about 0.05 for the inferred properties of v621per .",
    "the light ratio in the blue will be smaller than the overall luminosity ratio because the secondary star has a lower effective temperature than the primary star .",
    "this suggests that the quality of our spectroscopic observations was almost sufficient to detect the secondary star .",
    "accurate velocities for both stars should be measurable on spectra of a high signal to noise ratio , depending on the rotational velocity of the secondary star .",
    "v621per is situated , on the sky , in the centre of the @xmath0persei open cluster .",
    "it also appears in the correct place on the colour - magnitude diagram of the cluster ( see section  [ clusterinfo ] ) and has the correct proper - motion ( uribe et al .",
    "2002 ) for cluster membership .",
    "the systemic velocity of the deb , @xmath29kms@xmath2 , is consistent with the measured cluster systemic velocities of oosterhoff ( 1937 ) , bidelman ( 1943 ) , hron ( 1987 ) , liu et al .",
    "( 1989 , 1991 ) and chen , hou & wang ( 2003 ) .",
    "in paperi we measured the systemic velocity of the hpersei cluster to be @xmath30kms@xmath2 , indicating that h and @xmath0persei have the same systemic velocities , which is consistent with them having a common origin .",

    ", we have derived an orbital period of 25.5302days and a mass function of @xmath31@xmath5 .",
    "the discovery light curve of kp97 shows that the system exhibits a total primary eclipse lasting around 1.3days and about 0.12mag deep in @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "no data exist around phase 0.06 , where the secondary eclipse is expected to occur",
    ". the secondary eclipse may be up to about 0.06mag deep .",

    "the surface gravity of the secondary component has been found to be @xmath3 .    using the data above , possible values of the absolute masses and radii of the two stars",
    "were calculated by assuming different values of the primary surface gravity .",
    "a comparison in the mass  radius diagram of these possible values with theoretical predictions from the granada stellar evolutionary models suggests that @xmath4 .",

    "the luminosity of v621per has been derived from the known distance of the @xmath0persei cluster and the apparent magnitude of the deb .",
    "this has been used to place the primary star in the hertzsprung - russell diagram , and a comparison with the granada evolutionary models confirms that its mass is roughly 12@xmath5 , although a small discrepancy exists between the inferred age of v621per and the age of @xmath0persei .",
    "the value of @xmath22 leads to masses of approximately 12 and 6@xmath5  and radii of 10 and 3@xmath6  for the components of the deb .",
    "this conclusion is not strongly dependent on use of the granada stellar models ; predictions of the geneva , padova and cambridge models are close to those of the granada models ( paperii ) .",
    "v621persei is a potentially important object for the information it holds about the evolution of high - mass stars .",
    "the expected luminosity ratio of the system , about 0.05 , suggests that spectral lines of the secondary component should be detectable in high signal - to - noise spectra .",
    "better light curves will be needed for detailed studies of the properties of v621per , but the long period and lengthy eclipses mean that a large amount of telescope time will be required .",
    "in particular , the secondary eclipse is expected to occur around phase 0.06 and may be up to 0.06mag deep .",
    "observations of the light variation through secondary eclipse will be needed to provide a definitive study of the system .",
