    "transport in quantum pumps has been investigated in relation to various properties and from many perspectives @xcite .",
    "the goal of this article is to provide a rigorous setting for a single but important aspect of these devices , namely the charge transport or , more precisely , its expectation value .",
    "the idealized setting is as follows : a pump , whose internal configuration varies slowly in time in a prescribed manner , is connected to @xmath1 leads , or channels , along each of which independent electrons can enter or leave the pump .",
    "we assume that the electron in the lead has no transverse or spin degrees of freedom and may be thought of as a ( non - relativistic ) particle moving on a half line .",
    "the incoming electron distribution , at zero temperature , is a fermi sea with fermi energy @xmath2 common to all leads . as a rule",
    ", this does not apply to the distribution of the outgoing electrons , as their energies may have been shifted while scattering at the pump . because of this imbalance a net current is flowing in the leads .",
    "the expected charge transport is expressed by the formula @xcite @xmath3 here @xmath4 is the @xmath5 scattering matrix at energy @xmath2 computed as if the pump were _ frozen _ into its instantaneous configuration .",
    "a change of the configuration is accompanied by a change @xmath6 of the scattering matrix and by a net charge @xmath7 leaving the pump through lead @xmath8 .",
    "finally @xmath9 is the electron charge , which is henceforth set equal to @xmath10 .",
    "+ we shall next present a mathematical framework in which ( [ eq : bpt ] ) can be phrased as a theorem .",
    "@xmath11    the _ single - particle hilbert space _ is given as @xmath12 where states in @xmath13 , resp .",
    "in @xmath14 , describe an electron in one of the leads @xmath15 , resp .  in the pump proper .",
    "the latter hilbert space is not further specified , but the hypothesis a2 below confers on the pump the role of an abstract finite box @xcite .",
    "let @xmath16 denote the projection onto @xmath14 for @xmath17 and on @xmath8-th copy of @xmath18 for @xmath19 .",
    "since the pump configuration is supposed to change slowly in time @xmath20 , we will eventually consider the evolution of the electrons in an adiabatic limit , where @xmath21 is kept fixed as @xmath22 tends to @xmath23 . in terms of the rescaled time",

    "hamiltonians _ on @xmath26 enjoying the following properties : @xmath29 here @xmath30 denotes the trace class norm over @xmath26 , while the operator norm will be written as @xmath31 .",
    "assumption a3 states that a particle in the leads is free ; in particular , together with a1 , it implies that changes in the hamiltonian are confined to the pump proper : @xmath32 assumption a4 requires that there are no positive embedded eigenvalues ; a5 states that the pump is at rest for @xmath33 .",
    "the initial state of the electrons should be an equilibrium state .",
    "this is achieved thanks to assumption a5 by positing that the _ 1-particle density matrix _ at some ( and hence any ) epoch @xmath34 is of the form @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is a function of bounded variation with @xmath37 .",
    "a good example is the fermi sea , where @xmath38 .",

    "( [ eq : hs ] ) by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is smooth with @xmath42 , resp . @xmath43 for small , resp . large @xmath44 , and @xmath45 everywhere .",

    "one feature of this choice of current operator is that the `` ammeter '' is located not at a fixed distance from the pump , but rather at a fixed number of wavelengths , @xmath60 , from it : the longer the wavelength the more distant the `` ammeter '' .",
    "in the case that one focuses on a narrow energy interval , say near the fermi energy , the `` ammeter '' is also at essentially fixed distance from the pump .",
    "we remark that by the support property of @xmath61 and by a3 , the above commutator does not depend on @xmath24 . the expectation value of the current at epoch @xmath24 , i.e. , in the state ( [ eq : dm ] ) , is then given as @xmath62    in contrast to @xmath63 , which clearly has an infinite expectation value in that state , @xmath64 is inclined to have a finite one .",
    "moreover , it should behave as @xmath65 if , in accordance with ( [ eq : bpt ] ) , the charge @xmath7 transferred during @xmath66 is to have a non trivial limit as @xmath67 .",

    "finally we ought to state the reference dynamics @xmath71 to which @xmath28 is compared in the definition of the ( frozen ) _ scattering operator _",
    "@xcite @xmath72 whose fibers @xmath73 , called _ scattering matrices _ , appear in ( [ eq : bpt ] ) . while it turns out that the choice of @xmath71 is largely irrelevant , for the sake of simplicity let @xmath71 be the laplacian , acting on @xmath74 , with a neumann boundary condition at @xmath75 .",
    "@xmath76 , then agrees with the familiar definition based on generalized eigenfunctions incident through lead @xmath77 : @xmath78 .",
    "in particular , this reproduces the standard form of the scattering matrix of two channels : @xmath79 with @xmath80 the right and left reflection amplitudes and @xmath81 the corresponding transmission amplitudes .",
    "the fundamental equation ( [ eq : bpt ] ) may thus be given the following reformulation : @xmath82 in particular , for the fermi sea @xmath83 as initial state , we recover ( [ eq : bpt ] ) from @xmath84 .",
    "the limit @xmath85 is taken so as to have the current measurement made well outside of the scattering region , but after the adiabatic limit @xmath67 . by doing so , a current is still measured within the same epoch as the scattering process which generated it , though at a different time .",
    "+ the result can be proven essentially in this form , though some problems that arise both in the infrared and the ultraviolet have to be dealt with .",
    "in fact , the adiabatic limit is realized @xcite in the regime where the dimensionless quantity given by @xmath65 times the dwelling time of an electron in the pump is small .",
    "low energy particles have a large dwell time in the pumps and , in addition , may get trapped indefinitely as new bound states are born at the threshold @xmath86 .",
    "this means that no scattering description in terms of a single epoch is adequate at low energies .",
    "similarly , at high energies resonances may become increasingly sharp with correspondingly long dwelling times . on the other hand , low , resp .",
    "high energy states do not contribute to the net current , since they are filled , resp .",
    "empty in both the incoming and the outgoing flow .",
    "we shall therefore concentrate on the contribution to the current coming from states in any intermediate energy range , as selected by the function @xmath87 below .",

    "one could argue that for computing the expectation values of observables , which , like @xmath97 , pertain to the incoming part of phase space , scattering may be ignored , i.e. , one may pretend that the state of the system at epoch @xmath24 simply is @xmath98 . on the other hand , when discussing @xmath99 one should do as if the state were @xmath100+\\ldots\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath101 this comes from linearizing the hamiltonian @xmath102 around epoch @xmath24 , since @xmath103 is then the propagator from @xmath104 to @xmath105 in the interaction picture based on @xmath28 .",
    "now ( [ eq : rhoout ] ) is the state @xmath106 after scattering .",

    "( [ eq : s1 ] ) is twofold .",
    "first it reduces matters to `` frozen '' scattering data and their derivatives .",
    "second , it makes it clear why only the variation @xmath114 matters and , in particular , why for the fermi sea @xmath115 only states at the fermi energy @xmath2 contribute to the current .",
    "+ let us next discuss some of the conceptual issues involved in this result .",
    "\\1 ) theorem  [ bpt ] plays the role of the kubo formula and like it gives a handle on transport , including dissipative transport , using hamiltonian evolution .",
    "a well known weakness of linear response theory , stressed by van kampen @xcite , is that it takes the limit of linear response first and only then the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the correct order is , of course , the reverse .",
    "theorem  [ bpt ] is free of this criticism in that one starts with a system that has infinite extent , for which it is nevertheless possible to estimate the error made by linearizing the dynamics , see lemma  [ main_s4 ] .",
    "the reason for that is the finite extent of the pump or , more precisely , the finite dwell times .",
    "\\2 ) theorem  [ bpt ] is an example of an adiabatic theorem for open , gapless systems .",
    "in contrast to other results of that kind , such as @xcite which establish that an embedded eigenstate evolves adiabatically , ours is about the evolution associated with an infinite dimensional spectral subspace , e.g. the fermi sea .",
    "moreover , the goal is not to establish that a spectral subspace is preserved by the dynamics ; rather , it is to determine the amount by which it mingles with its complement , and the current is a measure thereof .",
    "\\3 ) on the l.h.s . of ( [ eq : bpt2 ] ) the scattering process and the measurement of the current",
    "are described as a single quantum history .",
    "this should be contrasted to usual textbook treatments of scattering rates , which have the following features : ( i ) the rates are computed classically as the product of a quantum mechanical scattering cross section and of an incident current ; ( ii ) the use of the scattering cross section tacitly replaces the actual state by its free asymptote . for a static potential and a steady beam",
    "both steps have been justified @xcite in the limit where the measurement is deferred all the way to @xmath116 .",
    "this is not quite so in the present fluctuating setting , where the ammeter is located at an intermediate scale , as specified by the order of the @xmath117 limits : far away from the pump on the scale of the scatterer , but close to it on the scale of the distance traveled by a particle on the adiabatic time scale .",
    "\\4 ) the formula of bttiker et al . , eq .  ( [ eq : bpt ] ) , is pointwise in time .",
    "suppose we represent the flow by means of coherent states of widths @xmath118 and @xmath119 . in line with the remark just made , one might suspect that @xmath119 needs to be picked small w.r.t . to the adiabatic time scale @xmath120 , and hence @xmath121 by the heisenberg uncertainty relation . at temperature",
    "@xmath122 the 1-particle distribution of the incoming flow is @xmath123 , which suggests that @xmath124 .",
    "this seemingly presents an obstacle to applying scattering arguments when @xmath125 .",
    "our result , which applies to @xmath115 , shows that this obstacle can be overcome , and that one _ can _ take the zero temperature limit @xmath126 before taking @xmath67 .",
    "+ results related to theorem  [ bpt ] have been obtained at the level of both physical and mathematical rigor . among the former we mention , besides of @xcite , the formula of lee , lesovik and levitov @xcite , which expresses the noise generated by quantum pumps ( as well as other moments ) in terms of the scattering data .",
    "however , the relations regarding noise are not local in time .",
    "rather these are integral relations that hold for a cycle of the pump .",
    "physically , what sets the current apart from the noise is its linear dependence on @xmath127 .",
    "rigorous mathematical description of the adiabatic scattering of wave packets is discussed in @xcite . like our result",

    "the state of independent quantum particles is described by a density matrix @xmath137 normalized so that @xmath138 is the number of particles . in the case of fermions ,",
    "thermodynamic systems have @xmath140 and observables that are otherwise innocent , and bounded operators in particular , may fail to have finite expectation values . for example , the charge associated with the `` box '' @xmath141 in phase space is infinite .",
    "nevertheless , the current flowing into the box should have a finite expectation .",
    "we begin by showing that the incoming and outgoing current operators of eq .",
    "( [ eq : cu ] ) are trace class and consequently , the expectation value @xmath142 in any fermionic state is well defined .",
    "a classical interpretation of the trace class condition is for the observable to be associated with a localized ( bounded ) function in phase space .",
    "the heuristic reason why the current is trace class is then as follows : the commutator @xmath143 $ ] is localized near the boundary of the box : a curve ( hyperbola ) in phase space .",
    "this is where the ammeter is .",
    "the ultraviolet and infrared cutoff @xmath144 then further delineate a compact region of phase space near the hyperbola .",
    "our first preliminary result confirms this picture .",
    "[ itraceclass ] the operator of incoming and outgoing current in the @xmath8-th channel , @xmath145 , is a trace class operator which is localized near @xmath146 in the sense that @xmath147 for all @xmath148 .",
    "this proposition is a direct consequence of lemma  [ secondl_pre ] below .",
