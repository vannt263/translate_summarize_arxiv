    "there are integrable model hamiltonians which allow for analytical solutions .",
    "examples related to the harmonic oscillator ( ho ) system are reviewed in @xcite . in classical mechanics integrability , for a time independent hamiltonian with @xmath0 degrees of freedom , means that in phase space there are @xmath0 independent constants of motion ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "of course , for the conservative one - dimensional case the hamiltonian system is always integrable . for td hamiltonians",
    "the situation is completely different because in this case the energy is not a conserved quantity and so even one - dimensional problems can be non - integrable @xcite .",
    "wave packets ( wps ) that propagate without dispersion were initially studied in quantum mechanics by schrdinger  @xcite ; these are packets of constant width that are usually discussed in contemporary textbooks on the matter and represent an early example of the coherent states introduced by glauber  @xcite , klauder  @xcite , and sudarshan  @xcite .",
    "that different initial conditions can lead to wps with totally different properties of the width will naturally emerge from our investigation .",
    "this last point is significant as the ho is still essential in the high - precision measurements of systems with weak dispersion  @xcite .",
    "a different form of studying td problems in quantum mechanics is via their propagators , transforming an ( initial ) state at time @xmath1 into a ( final ) state at a later time @xmath2 . early on in quantum mechanics ,",
    "kennard  @xcite derived the propagators for the free particle , the motion of a charged particle in a uniform electric field , and the ho .",
    "this subject gained renewed interest when feynman derived the propagators via his path integral formulation of quantum mechanics which has its origins in the classical principle of least action  @xcite . since then an intensive search for propagators of hamiltonian systems began ( see also  @xcite ) . for ( also multidimensional ) hamiltonians that are quadratic in position and momentum , together with those hamiltonians associated with group - theoretical structures ,",
    "there are established procedures to derive the propagators . as an example , the method of linear td invariants introduced in @xcite shall be mentioned because it is related to our approach for describing the time - dependence of quantum uncertainties , so that solving the problem is traced back to solutions of the classical equations of motion . in particular , the study of the parametric oscillator with td frequency is very useful because of its applicability to quantum optics , plasma physics and gravitational waves  @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we consider tdses with exact analytic gaussian wp solutions .",
    "this is the first of a series of three papers that integrate our research .",
    "it is known that gaussian wps exist for any hamiltonian that is at most bilinear in position and momentum operators . in this case",
    "also exact analytic expressions for the time - evolution of quantum uncertainties exist ; in particular for the ho , an oscillator with td frequency @xmath3 and the free motion . in the case of the parametric oscillator with @xmath4 ,",
    "the hamiltonian is no longer a constant of motion but the so - called ermakov invariant still exists @xcite  .",
    "moreover , it is closely related to the wigner function of the system @xcite , and also has been thoroughly used to study the parametric oscillator in classical and quantum physics @xcite . in addition , the ermakov invariant is relevant in studying the time - evolution of wps associated to an oscillator with td frequency .",
    "for example , this has been used in the determination of the oscillator s squeezing properties when the frequency is a step function of time  @xcite .",
    "more recently , the ermakov invariant has been used in a class of waveguide arrays where the refractive indices and second - neighbor couplings define the mass and the frequency of an analog parametric oscillator  @xcite .    in section [ section-2 ] , the tdses for conservative systems with at most quadratic potential . particularly the ho with time - independent frequency @xmath5",
    "are considered where the free motion can be obtained in the limit @xmath6 .",
    "the gaussian wps associated to these tdses are mainly defined by the coefficient of the quadratic term in the exponential , this coefficient is solution of a complex riccati equation and includes information on the quantum uncertainties of position , momentum , and position - momentum correlation . due to the quadratic term in the riccati equation ,",
    "one expects at least two different solutions ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 signs of the the square root ) .",
    "in addition , as the riccati equation is a nonlinear ( nl ) differential equation it is sensitive to the initial conditions and can provide qualitatively quite different behaviour of its solutions depending on the choice of the initial conditions .",
    "however , these are related to different physical situations of the initial wp ( e.g. , minimum uncertainty wp or others ) . because of these uncertainties also determine physical properties of the system , like tunnelling currents and ground states energies , these ( measurable ) properties are also affected by the choice of the initial conditions .    in section [ section-3 ]",
    "we show the form in which the initial uncertainties enter the solution of the complex riccati equation .",
    "the relations between the riccati equation , the ermakov equation , the ermakov invariant , and the aforementioned linear dynamical invariants are also established .",
    "there it is also shown how the potential ( via the hamiltonian ) , and thus the td frequency of the parametric oscillator , can enter the treatment and consequently how our formalism can be extended easily to cases where no analytic solutions may exist for the classical equations of motion .",
    "a more detailed discussion will be provided in part iii of our study concerning systems with explicitly td hamiltonians .",
    "the linearization of the riccati equation leads to a complex newtonian equation whose real and imaginary parts are not independent of each other and provide the td parameters that essentially determine the propagator of the system .",
    "they also allow the rewriting of the ermakov invariant in a form that the comparison with the wigner function of the system is feasible .",
    "this is shown in sections [ section-4 ] , [ section-5 ] and [ section-6 ] .    in the final section ,",
    "possible generalizations of our method are mentioned , especially the inclusion of dissipative effects which will be discussed in more detail in the part ii of our study .",
    "there , we shall consider dissipative systems with friction that depends linearly on velocity .",
