    "studying the epoch around @xmath10 is important for our understanding of the early stages of galaxy formation . it is around this time , when the age of the universe was less than a gyr , that the reionization of the hydrogen component of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) was substantially completed @xcite .",
    "hundreds of @xmath10 galaxies have now been photometrically selected ( e.g. @xcite ) , and at least tens of lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) and many more ly@xmath2  emitters ( laes ) are now spectroscopically confirmed ( @xcite ) . while there are hints of substantial star formation at even higher redshifts ( @xcite ) , @xmath10 remains the earliest epoch for which robust galaxy samples are available .    at @xmath10 , galaxies are selected via the lyman break method ( @xcite ) , or because of strong ly@xmath2  emission @xcite .",
    "both methods select star - forming galaxies , but the two populations differ .",
    "not all lbgs have ly@xmath2  emission @xcite and laes can be missed by lbg surveys because they are faint in the continuum or their ly@xmath2  emission contaminates broad - band photometry .",
    "studies of laes are an important complement to lbg surveys , because the faint continuum luminosities and high specific star formation rates of laes make them likely candidates for galaxy building blocks .    to date",
    ", narrow - band imaging surveys have been very successful in finding laes at @xmath11 .",
    "mulitwavelength observations have shown that these laes are typically ( but not always ) younger and less massive , and they have lower dust extinction than lbgs @xcite .",
    "in addition , ly@xmath2  luminosity functions measured at @xmath11 , show little or no evolution with redshift @xcite . at higher redshifts measurements of the ly@xmath2",
    "luminosity function may allow a determination of the neutral hydrogen fraction in the intergalactic medium and lae clustering could help constrain models of the patchiness of of the reionization process @xcite .",
    "in fact , @xcite now report a measured decline in the ly@xmath2  luminosity function at @xmath12 , although this is not seen in a compilation of different data sets presented by @xcite .",
    "spectroscopic searches for laes have the potential to detect objects with fainter line emission than purely narrow - band imaging , because they sample with a resolution closer to the intrinsic width of the emission line .",
    "this is especially important at @xmath13 , where observing the faint end of the galaxy luminosity function is challenging .",
    "however , the task is challenging and first efforts at blank sky surveys using multi - slit narrowband spectroscopy at keck observatory and the very large telescope ( vlt ) found only low and intermediate redshift interlopers @xcite .",
    "more recently , different spectroscopic strategies have met success . @xcite",
    "have found several faint serendipitous laes at @xmath14 in a search of 20% of the deep2 database . while the area subtended by deep2 slits",
    "is only 21.6 arcmin@xmath15 , a large line - of - sight volume is sampled within in the relatively oh - free portion of the sky spectrum at @xmath16  .",
    "in addition , @xcite found 27 @xmath17 laes in a single longslit spectrum ; their @xmath18 100 hour vlt observation reached a flux one to two orders of magnitude deeper than most other lae searches . at higher redshifts , slitless spectroscopy with",
    "_ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) has uncovered a few sources at @xmath19 @xcite , and longslit spectroscopy of the critical lines of strong gravitational lenses has discovered low - luminosity laes at @xmath10 @xcite , as well as a few candidates at @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "recently , wider areas have become accessible with multislit narrowband spectroscopy , and laes have been found at @xmath21 . using the inamori magellan areal camera and spectrograph ( imacs ; @xcite ) ,",
    "@xcite carried out a blind spectroscopic search in 200 arcmin@xmath15 in the cosmic evolution survey ( cosmos ; @xcite ) and the 15 hour field of the las campanas infrared survey ( lcirs ; @xcite ) .",
    "these observations reach a sensitivity fainter than @xmath22(ly@xmath2 ) at @xmath23 ( @xmath18 several @xmath24 erg s@xmath25 , as measured by @xcite and @xcite ) , and three lae candidates at @xmath23 were confirmed with further spectroscopy . following this success ,",
    "we have carried out a deeper survey in the same fields ( dressler et al .",
    ", in prep . ) ,",
    "uncovering at least several sources at luminosities that were previously only reached with strong lensing searches @xcite .    of the three sources found by @xcite , none",
    "are detected in the available continuum imaging , and only one has been previously detected in cosmos narrow - band imaging ( no narrow - band imaging is available in the 15h field ) . in this paper , we present new imaging of these laes from the near infrared camera and multi - object spectrometer ( nicmos ; @xcite ) .",
    "these images , obtained through the @xmath0  filter with the nic2 camera , confirm the presence of the two laes in the 15h field . in ",
    "2 we present our observations and data reduction , as well as the process by which we match our spectroscopically discovered sources with nicmos detections . in ",
    "3 we discuss the properties of these three laes , and  4 contains a summary of our results .",
    "we use @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and ab magnitudes throughout .",
    "each of the three laes were observed for 5 orbits ( 13.4 ks ) with the nicmos 2 camera .",
    "the images were then processed in several steps to make final mosaics .",
    "first , images were corrected for the quadrant - dependent variable bias ( the `` pedestal effect '' ) , and south atlantic anomaly ( saa ) darks were subtracted from impacted orbits .",
    "next , we used the iraf task _ rnlincor _ to correct for the count - rate dependent non - linearity documented by @xcite . with this approach ,",
    "the zero point remained unchanged at @xmath0  = 23.69 . for our configuration of @xmath0  with nicmos 2 , the non - linearity correction was substantial , and amounted to @xmath29 mag for the @xmath0  = 23 - 26 magnitude sources in our images . following this correction , the images were sky subtracted , using the nicred package @xcite . then , the remaining vertical and horizontal bands in the images were removed by subtracting a model sky frame constructed by taking the median of each column and smoothing it by a three pixel wide boxcar .",
    "( this step was repeated for rows to remove any top - to - bottom banding or gradients . ) after this , we identified bad pixels in the images following the procedures used by the multidrizzle software @xcite : a truth image was made by aligning the images and creating a median stack .",
    "this image was shifted back to the frame of the original input image , and pixels deviant by more than 3 @xmath30 were flagged as bad pixels .",
    "finally , images were combined with drizzle with bad pixels masked using parameters recommended in the dither handbook : pixfrac = 0.6 , and scale = 0.5 .",
    "the final output pixels are 0.038 .",
    "the resulting psf , measured from the two point sources in these images has a fwhm of 0.1 .",
    "sensitivity was measured by randomly placing 0.6  diameter apertures in the image , rejecting those that fell on sources , and fitting a gaussian to the `` counts - per - aperture '' distribution , as described in @xcite .",
    "we found a 5@xmath30 sensitivity of @xmath0  = 26.5 in this aperture .",
    "using the point sources in our images , we measured the aperture correction to be 0.08 magnitudes , so the 5@xmath30 total sensitivity is @xmath0  = 26.4 ( for a point source ) . finally , using a few common sources per image , the astrometric solutions to the nicmos images",
    "were aligned with the cosmos survey for the 10h field , and the sdss for the 15h field .      the spectroscopic search and confirmation data",
    "are presented in @xcite , where a difference was discovered between the world coordinate system ( wcs ) zero - points of cosmos and that of our data .",
    "namely , the position of msdm 80 + 3 in the cosmos / subaru narrow - band imaging is nearly 1  west of the position found by martin et al . in light of this offset",
    ", we improved our technique for deriving coordinates , by mapping a wcs solution to images taken through our slitmask .",
    "we tested these solutions for both the cosmos and 15h field , using dozens of objects ( per field ) that have continuum detections in our spectra .",
    "we found ( 1@xmath30 ) position uncertainties of 03 - 05 along the slits , and 10 perpendicular to the slits .",
    "the latter uncertainty naturally arises in all blind spectroscopic searches , because sources are not necessarily centered in the slits . for the cosmos field",
    ", the slits are oriented e - w , so these uncertainties correspond to ra and dec , respectively . for the 15h field",
    "the slit pa was -45 .    in figure [ stampfig ]",
    ", we show the nicmos @xmath0  images at the positions of the three laes .",
    "no obvious source is detected at the position of msdm 80 + 3 , but sources are detected within the 1@xmath30 position error ellipse for msdm 29.5 + 5 and just outside it for msdm 71 - 5 .",
    "photometry is presented in table [ phot_table ] .",
    "we used 0.6  diameter apertures , centered on the positions of the sources shown in figure [ stampfig ] for msdm 29.5 + 5 and msdm 71 - 5 , and at the position of the narrowband detection for msdm 80 + 3 ( see figure [ stamp80 + 3 ] ) .",
    "a point source model was adopted for the aperture correction , as explained in  [ obs ] .",
    "while more light will be missed from extended sources , this loss amounts to at most 0.1 to 0.3 magnitudes ( in addition to the point source aperture correction ) , as nearly all @xmath10 galaxies have half - light radii , @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "as we can not accurately determine the amount of missed flux , we adopt the point source aperture correction of 0.1 magnitudes , and note this systematic uncertainty .    in order to determine whether the sources are likely to be associated with the laes , we calculated the probability that the nicmos detections in the 15h field are from foreground galaxies . to do this",
    "we obtained the publicly available catalogs of the nicmos ultra - deep field@xcite .",
    "for consistency with our aperture photometry of the laes , we used 06 diameter apertures .",
    "to @xmath0  = 26.1 , which is the aperture magnitude of the fainter of the two detected sources , we found cumulative number counts of @xmath1860 arcmin@xmath32 .",
    "therefore , there is less than a one per - cent chance of a foreground interloper falling within our positional error ellipse . for the brighter source",
    ", this probability is about 50% lower .",
    "we conclude with greater than @xmath33% confidence that each of the nicmos detected sources is indeed an lae discovered by @xcite .",
    "strong ly@xmath2  emission can in some cases contribute appreciably to broadband flux density @xcite , and for our objects this could happen . at @xmath1 , ly@xmath2  is included in the wide @xmath0  bandpass , which covers approximately 0.8 to 1.4 .",
    "however , the contribution is negligible for our objects our measured ly@xmath2  fluxes account for only 5 - 10% of the @xmath0  flux densities for the two detected sources .",
    "this enhancement lies within our uncertainties , so no corrections are made to our photometry and equivalent width measurements .",
    "these nicmos observations provide the first direct images of two sources ( msdm 29.5 + 5 and msdm 71 - 5 ) which had previously only been detected in our spectroscopic data . on the other hand , the source which is undetected in @xmath0 , msdm 80 + 3 , shows a strong detection in subaru narrowband imaging with the nb816 filter ( object # 55 in @xcite ) . in figure",
    "[ stamp80 + 3 ] we show the narrowband image of msdm 80 + 3 , with our position error ellipse overlaid .",
    "our improved coordinates for msdm 80 + 3 are roughly consistent with the nb816 source in murayama et al .",
    "the newly derived position is 07 _ west _ of the nb816 detection , while the previous position given in martin et al .",
    "east_. this position offset along the slit is still large compared to other sources , including those discussed in  2.2 and for 52 lower redshift line emitters that are in common between martin et al . and",
    "the cosmos nb816 sample . given the slight offset perpendicular to the slit ( 04 ) shown in figure [ stamp80 + 3 ] , one possibility is that the ly@xmath2  emission from this object is extended , and our slit subtended an outlying region of the galaxy .",
    "some evidence for this hypothesis is present in the subaru narrowband image ( figure [ stamp80 + 3 ] ) , where msdm 80 + 3 is marginally resolved .",
    "the absence of continuum emission could indicate that the source is extended in the continuum , although extended ly@xmath2  emission need not imply a similarly extended stellar continuum .",
    "the upper bound of @xmath9 dropout lbg sizes is @xmath34 02 ( in the rest - frame uv ; @xcite ) , which corresponds to 5.3 pixels in our drizzled nic2 images . using the iraf artdata package",
    ", we verified that a galaxy of this size would be undetected in our nicmos data at @xmath0   @xmath35 .",
    "it is tempting to conclude from the low - surface brightness signal at the position of msdm 80 + 3 in our nicmos image that it may be more extended in the rest - frame uv .",
    "however , this lae fell on the bad central column in these observations , and similar artifacts appear at other locations along the column .",
    "the weight maps produced by drizzle indicate that noise is @xmath36% higher at these locations relative to the rest of the image , so the extended feature is not significant .",
    "nevertheless , the @xmath0  non - detection could imply that msdm 80 + 3 is more extended in the continuum than the other two laes ( msdm 29.5 + 5 and 71 - 5 ) , which have half - light - radii ( measured with sextractor ) of 015 and 014 .",
    "the hypothesis that the ly@xmath2  emission may be extended is also supported by our line flux measurement , which is a factor of two lower than the subaru nb816 imaged line flux .",
    "this difference is larger than is expected for a point source , unless the object fell on the edge of our 15-wide slit . as noted above , in the narrow - band image",
    "coordinates , msdm 80 + 3 is 04 north of the slit - center . using the point source slit loss models from martin et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , at this position we expect only about a 20% slit loss .",
    "the effect of the non - uniform response of the nb816 filter on suprimecam is negligible for msdm 80 + 3 , because our measured wavelength is near the central wavelength of the nb816 transmission .",
    "furthermore , lines at wavelengths away from the center of the nb816 bandpass would have decreased observed ly@xmath2  flux relative to our spectroscopic measurement the opposite of what we observe .",
    "generally , sources found through blind spectroscopy do not fall at the center of the slit ; for larger samples the impact of slit - losses on the luminosity function is modeled statistically .",
    "equivalent widths , uv luminosities , and uv continuum derived star formation rates are given in table [ phot_table ] .",
    "we assume a flat uv spectrum ( @xmath37 ) , consistent with observations of laes with ly@xmath2  luminosities and redshifts similar to those of our objects @xcite , and with @xmath10 lbgs in the nicmos ultra deep field @xcite . therefore , although the center of the @xmath0  filter corresponds to @xmath38   in the rest frame , our best estimate is that k - corrections are negligible .",
    "we note that @xmath39 at @xmath10 @xcite , so the uv - luminosities that we measure are consistent with typical sources observed at this redshift within a factor of two of @xmath22 for the two @xmath0detected sources .",
    "star formation rates ( sfrs ) are derived using the 1500   conversion from @xcite .",
    "uv - continuum based estimates of star - formation rates are thought to be more reliable than those from ly@xmath2 ; nevertheless , these continuum - based estimates come with several caveats .",
    "first , the conversion is valid only when the characteristic stellar age is older than the main sequence lifetime of o- and b - stars . at young ages ( @xmath40 myrs ) ,",
    "the true sfr may be a few times larger .",
    "second , we have not corrected the uv - luminosities for dust extinction , so again , the sfrs given in table [ phot_table ] may be underestimated . however , in general , @xmath10 galaxies are not thought to be very dusty @xcite , so dust corrections to our sfrs need not be very large .",
    "third , uncertainties in the imf slope and mass cutoffs may be just as important , as they can change the sfr by a factor of a few @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the two - photon nebular continuum is not expected to make a significant contribution to the uv - luminosity , since it is generally dwarfed by the stellar contribution .",
    "while some sources are purported to have spectra dominated by the two - photon continuum , such objects appear to be rare @xcite , and are predicted to have rest - frame ly@xmath2  equivalent widths @xmath41   ( @xcite , with coefficients from @xcite ) .",
    "the equivalent widths that we measure are consistent with those of laes at high redshift , as shown in figure [ ewplot ] .",
    "we do not make any correction for igm absorption on the ly@xmath2  emission , as has been done for some objects at @xmath10 ( e.g.  @xcite ) . while it is possible that the ly@xmath2  emission emergent from the galaxy is larger than observed , the amount of attenuation is uncertain because the resonant scattering of ly@xmath2  photons shifts the emission towards redder wavelengths @xcite .",
    "it is not surprising that we do not observe any sources that are both uv luminous and have high - equivalent widths . as @xcite point out",
    ", this may be a consequence of both classes of objects being rare , rather than a correlation of equivalent width with uv luminosity as has been suggested by @xcite .",
    "the three laes that we present are consistent with the range of equivalent widths that are easily explained by `` normal '' stellar populations , with ages older than 10 myrs and a salpeter imf . however , deeper continuum observations of msdm 80 + 3 could prove that its equivalent width is much larger .",
    "there are several different models that can explain very large equivalent widths .",
    "first , extremely young ages and/or top - heavy initial mass functions ( imfs ) can result in rest - frame equivalent width @xmath42   ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "second , a multi - phase interstellar medium has sometimes been invoked to preferentially absorb uv continuum photons ( @xcite ) ; and third , gravitational cooling radiation in the absence of star formation is predicted to result in @xmath43    ( @xcite )",
    ". however , such high equivalent width objects are probably rare , as only a few sources in figure [ ewplot ] lie at @xmath42  .",
    "it is important to note that the uncertainty on such high equivalent width sources typically exceeds 100  because of weak continuum detections , so these measurements should be viewed with caution .",
    "it is interesting to consider whether the laes in our survey would be selected as @xmath9 dropout lbgs at @xmath10 , because the connection between the two populations is currently unclear . while it is generally understood that laes can be missed by lbg searches when their continuum is too faint , the selection of brighter sources can also be influenced by strong line emission ( e.g.  @xcite ) . at @xmath44 ,",
    "ly@xmath2  falls in the @xmath45 -band , and galaxies can sometimes be too blue in @xmath46 to be included in @xmath9dropout samples , even when an identical galaxy without ly@xmath2  emission would be included in such a sample .",
    "( it is worth noting that such objects could be included in @xmath47 r - dropout samples , provided that the @xmath46 color is not too red . )",
    "strong ly@xmath2  emission may influence the color selection of all three galaxies presented here . assuming a flat uv slope ( @xmath37 ) , we estimate @xmath48 and 1.3 for msdm 29.5 and msdm 71 - 5 , near the @xmath49 cut used by most lbg studies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the inclusion of sources such as these would depend on photometric scatter and the true value of the uv slope .",
    "on the other hand , msdm 80 + 3 , which is undetected in the @xmath0  images , would be unlikely to be included in @xmath9dropout samples .",
    "the ly@xmath2  flux contributes substantially to the @xmath9band , so even in the absence of any continuum we would expect @xmath50 .",
    "assuming @xmath8@xmath51 as inferred from our @xmath0  limit implies that we would expect @xmath52 .",
    "therefore , even if msdm 80 + 3 could be detected in very deep imaging such as the udf , it would be much too blue to be included in the @xmath9 dropout samples .",
    "this exercise emphasizes the importance of including ly@xmath2  emission in the modeling of lbg selection functions , as is done by @xcite .",
    "spectroscopic searches for high - redshift emission - line galaxies have now been shown as a viable technique for improving sensitivity to faint emission line galaxies @xcite . in particular , @xcite have successfully identified three @xmath1 laes with multislit narrowband spectroscopy .",
    "we have presented nicmos observations of these three laes , obtained with the high spatial resolution nic2 camera .",
    "these images confirm the two sources which had only previously been seen in our imacs spectroscopic observations .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath0  data provide some constraints on the properties of these galaxies .",
    "we find that the uv luminosities , star formation rates , equivalent widths and sizes are all consistent with a redshift of @xmath1 .",
    "the two detected sources have @xmath53 within a factor of two of @xmath5 ( as measured by @xcite ) , and equivalent widths are well within the range of values seen at all redshifts .",
    "in addition , the non - detection of msdm 80 + 3 , in combination with a substantial slit - loss of ly@xmath2  flux suggests that the source may be somewhat extended .",
    "these new observations further prove the success of multislit narrowband spectroscopy as a means to uncover faint , high - redshift emission line galaxies .",
    "further efforts for extending this technique to much fainter laes are already underway ( dressler et al . , in prep ) .",
    "longer exposures with the recently upgraded imacs detectors can reach ly@xmath2  luminosities at @xmath10 that have previously only been realized in gravitational lensing surveys along the critical lines of galaxy clusters ( e.g.  @xcite ) . at the limit of our new survey ( at least @xmath54 ) ,",
    "rest - frame equivalent widths above 150    would imply a @xmath55band magnitude fainter than 29- a regime that is currently only accessible from the small area covered by the udf and udf parallels .",
    "these new blind spectroscopic observations will provide an ideal sample of low - luminosity @xmath1 laes that will be detectable with nircam , nirspec , and the tunable filter imager on the _ james webb space telescope _ in modest exposure times ( @xmath56 10,000 seconds ) .",
    "such future observations will provide critical insight into the building blocks of galaxies by measuring their stellar and nebular ( line+continuum ) emission .",
