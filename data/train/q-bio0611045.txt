    "the collective motion of organisms is a spectacular phenomenon sometimes involving huge schools of fish , thousands of birds exhibiting complex aerial displays @xcite , herds of quadrupeds and even bacteria producing fractal colonies @xcite or amoeba assembling into rotating aggregates@xcite .",
    "recently , sperm cells were also demonstrated to form self - organized vortices @xcite .",
    "in addition to being a common mechanism by which organisms self - organize , a deeper understanding of the simultaneous adjustment of the velocities of many moving objects has important potential applications ranging from the swarming of distributed robots exploring new territories @xcite to the healing of wounds related to the coherent migration of epithelial cells @xcite .    although widely observed in nature , collective motion is less accessible for experimental investigations under laboratory conditions .",
    "et al .  _",
    "@xcite have presented interesting but only qualitative results .",
    "a well controlled series of experiments aimed at characterizing the nature of the transition from a disordered to an ordered phase in velocity space is so far lacking , even though such experiments would be useful both in providing a quantitative reference for further experimental studies and in prompting more realistic models for group behavior .",
    "while laboratory observations have been scarce , a number of models based on self - propelled particles have been developed recently ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) to describe collective motion . in broad terms",
    "these models fall into two categories , those which describe the onset of collective motion as a transition to an ordered state in a large noisy system with simple interactions between the particles @xcite , and those which employ more complicated  consequently more realistic  interactions and focus on the emergent collective dynamics of groups of finite size @xcite .",
    "a model , however , that combines simple short - ranged interactions , detailed realistic dynamics and a well defined kinetic transition in a large noisy system has not been described so far .    in this paper we present experimental results concerning the collective migration of a large number of tissue cells ( keratocytes ) using long - term videomicroscopy .",
    "as the overall density of the migrating cells is increased , we observe a kinetic phase transition from a disordered ( low density ) state into an ordered ( high density ) state , in which most of the cells move in a direction approximately agreeing with their average direction of motion . just below the transition a complex picture emerges with interacting groups of cells moving in random directions .",
    "motivated by these experimental results we develop a flocking model , which , in contrast to previous models , considers a minimal realistic interaction that assumes no explicit averaging of the directions of motion , while also exhibiting a transition to the ordered phase .",
    "numerical studies indicate that this transition is continuous and belongs to the same universality class as the model of vicsek _ _ e__t al .",
    "these results compel us to imply that the experimental transition described is continuous as well .",
    "our experimental setup , consisting of a home developed fully computer - controlled time - lapse microscope @xcite and a custom made room temperature @xmath0 mini - incubator allowed us to carry out long - term videomicroscopy of keratocytes together with a quantitative analysis of their motion .",
    "we collected 24 fish scales from living goldfish ( _ carassius auratus _ ) with tweezers , and placed them external side up in a 35-mm circular petri dish similarly to ref .",
    "scales were kept in the incubator overnight to allow epidermal keratocyte cells to migrate out from the scales . before time - lapse microscopy scales were removed , and the cells remaining in the petri dish were treated with phosphate saline buffer and/or trypsin to obtain cultures of varying density ( both compounds reversibly weaken cell - cell and cell - substrate connections , allowing the removal of a controllable percentage of the cells ) . during the subsequent typically 24h long time - lapse microscopy experiments we monitored the motion of live keratocyte cells ( taking pictures in several fields of view at frequency of 1 shot per minute ) in cultures of varying density ranging from sparse ones with very low cell densities to confluent ones with nearly complete coverage .",
    "we observed a relatively sharp transition from random motility to an ordered collective migration of dense islands of cells as the density was increased .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the typical behavior of cells for three different densities .",
    "the technical details of the experiment are described in the online supplemental material @xcite .        in order to quantify the level of coherence of the migration pattern of cells the individual motion of which",
    "are usually described as a persistent random walk @xcite we calculated the velocity of 20 - 30 cells in each experiment from their displacement between frames .",
    "this process yielded the @xmath1 velocity vectors of cells , where @xmath2 is the index of the cell , @xmath3 is the time elapsed from the start of the cell s trajectory and @xmath4 denotes the time difference between frames .",
    "we define as the measure of coherence of motion an order parameter equal to the time average of the sum of the normalized velocities divided by the number of cells measured .",
    "thus , the order parameter is @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the number of evaluated cells . fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] displays the order parameter as a function of cell density .",
    "our measurements were carried out after the cells had had sufficient time to migrate out of the scales and achieve a quasi - stationary migration .",
    "@xmath7 was calculated by averaging over the observation time and its standard error was calculated by dividing the standard deviation by @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the number of analyzed snapshots .",
    "we attempted to survey the extent of finite size effects , by calculating the order parameter and its error , while considering only half the number of available cells .",
    "we found no significant deviation .",
    "cell density was measured locally , i.e.  in the field of view , every 30 minutes .",
    "both its mean value and the standard error of the mean is presented in fig .  2 .",
    "a sharp increase can be observed around 5 @xmath10 10@xmath11 cells/@xmath12m@xmath13 .",
    "we conclude that a kinetic phase transition takes place from a disordered into an ordered state as cell density exceeds a relatively well - defined critical value .",
    "our experiments suggest that short - range attractive  repulsive intercellular forces alone are sufficient to organize motile keratocyte cells into coherent groups .",
    "to interpret the above phase transition - like ordering phenomenon we constructed a model that takes into account the specific features of the experimental system and is able to reproduce experiential behavior . in our model individual model cells ( self - propelled particles )",
    "move forward in a well defined direction with constant speeds .",
    "the noisy nature of the processes which generate cell locomotion is taken into account by considering the direction of self - propulsion of model cells to be noisy .",
    "intercellular forces through which model cells interact are considered to be short - ranged , as between keratocytes they are the result of direct physical contact .",
    "further , regarding interactions between keratocyte cells , it is obvious that explicit averaging of the directions of motion employed in previous models is not realistic .",
    "tissue cells forming coherently migrating groups are unable to explicitly adjust their direction of motion to the average velocity of their neighbors , collective motion must emerge solely as a result of direct cell to cell interactions ( forces ) . to model the emergence of collective motion without such explicit averaging , we consider self - propelled particles ( model cells ) that attempt to adjust their direction of motion toward the direction of the net - force acting on them .",
    "the 2-dimensional motion of model cell @xmath14 with position @xmath15 is described by the overdamped dynamics : @xmath16 thus , each cell with mobility @xmath12 attempts to maintain a self - propelling velocity of magnitude @xmath17 in the direction of the unit vector @xmath18 and experiences intercellular forces @xmath19 .",
    "the direction of the self - propelling velocity @xmath20 , described by the angle @xmath21 , attempts to relax to @xmath22 with a relaxation time @xmath23 , while also experiencing angular noise @xmath24 : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a unit vector orthogonal to the plane of motion ( see fig .  [",
    "modelfig]b ) and @xmath24 is a delta correlated gaussian white noise term with zero mean , ie .",
    "@xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "we consider pairwise inter - cellular forces whose magnitude is a function of the distance @xmath29 between the two centers of mass only .",
    "aiming for simplicity we present results obtained by using a piecewise linear force function , the existence of the transition we describe , however , does not depend on the specific form of the function employed .",
    "the piecewise linear force function we considered was repulsive for distances smaller then @xmath30 , attractive for distances @xmath31 and zero for cells farther apart , i.e.   @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the value of the maximum repulsive force at @xmath34 and @xmath35 is the maximum attractive force ( resulting from adhesive interactions between cells ) at @xmath36 ( see fig .",
    "[ modelfig]b ) .",
    "the values @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 were used , the results obtained , however , were not sensitive to the particular choice for the parameter values .",
    "the parameters of the function ( [ forcefunction ] ) , the slope of the two linear segments ( @xmath44 and @xmath45 ) and the equilibrium distance @xmath46 , were adjusted while observing the simulations and comparing them with experimental videos ( cf .",
    "online supplemental material ) , in order to achevie best possible agreement with the experiments .",
    "the two main criteria were : i. ) the reproduction of the 2-dimensional sheet - like motion , wherein individual cells only interact with their nearest neighbors ",
    "i.e.  cells have a well defined volume and ii ) the ability of cells to `` break free '' from each other .",
    "the first was readily achievable by setting the slope of the repulsive force segment to be sufficiently larger than the that of the attractive segment and the value of @xmath46 sufficiently larger than @xmath47 , while the second necessitated that the maximal value of the attractive segment @xmath45 be set smaller then @xmath48 .",
    "we carried out simulations ( fig .",
    "[ modelfig]a ) by solving the system of @xmath49 differential equations ( [ eomv ] ) and ( [ eomn ] ) with periodic boundary conditions in systems of size @xmath50 using a fixed time step of @xmath51 .",
    "the angular noise term @xmath24 was modeled by choosing its magnitude uniformly from the interval @xmath52 $ ] . in good agreement with experiments , running our model resulted in a continuous transition to the ordered phase ( where all cells move in a common direction ) as the number density of cells @xmath53 was increased for a fixed value of the noise @xmath54 ( fig .",
    "[ modelfig2 ] ) . while varying the value of @xmath55 was not experimentally feasible ,",
    "simulations show that a continuous transition to the ordered phase also takes place as @xmath55 is decreased while @xmath56 is held fixed ( data not shown , see online supplemental material @xcite ) . in both cases",
    "we calculated the order parameter ( [ experimental_order_parameter ] ) using the velocities @xmath57 obtained from the numerical solution of ( [ eomv ] ) and ( [ eomn ] ) .",
    "@xmath7 and its standard error were calculated by averaging over at least @xmath58 independent simulation runs each at least an order of magnitude longer than the typical velocity autocorrelation time ( which was found to be in the range of @xmath59 ) .",
    "the values @xmath60 and @xmath61 were found for the critical density and noise from simulations of systems with @xmath62 and @xmath63 at fixed values of @xmath54 and @xmath64 respectively . based on the assumption that our model exhibits a kinetic phase transition in the thermodynamic limit analogous to the continuous phase transition in equilibrium systems",

    "@xcite , for which @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "when two cells approach each other close enough , equation ( [ eomn ] ) leads to a gradual alignment of their direction of motion .",
    "our model is in this sense similar to other models of systems of self - driven particles exhibiting emergent collective motion  i.e.  flocking  , with the very important difference that the particles  the cells  do not directly use information on the movement of others around them to determine their own movement . also , while several other models include self - propelling particles , which interact through various forces ( and the seminal work of shimoyama _ _ e__t al .",
    "@xcite has alignment dynamics similar to ours ) , they all rely on either long - range forces @xcite , explicit averaging @xcite or both @xcite .",
    "the model presented above , on the other hand , combines an experimentally motivated minimal dynamics with short - range adhesive and repulsive forces , while also displaying a continuous kinetic transition to the ordered state .",
    "to investigate the effects of boundary conditions on collective cell motility , we used square as well as more complex shaped microfabricated arenas , which kept cells in a well defined area .",
    "microstructures were fabricated by uv - curing norland optical adhesive ( noa63 ) on the surface of glass cover slips using uv lithography .",
    "the typical diameter of the structures was 2 mm with 0.8 mm high walls .",
    "in closed 2d square shaped arenas we observed the roundabout motion of large cell groups .",
    "[ fig5 ] shows an experimental snapshot of the circular motion with the instantaneous velocities of cells in the corner of a square shaped arena .",
    "a spectacular sustained whirling motion of the cells can be seen in the corresponding supplemental video @xcite .",
    "we were also able to reproduce the above effects of boundary conditions on cell motion in simulations similar to those described in the previous section . placing model cells in a square box with repulsive walls implemented through adding a repulsive force with an exponential falloff and",
    "finite a cutoff to the right side of equation ( [ eomn ] ) corresponding to each of the four walls @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the distance between cell @xmath14 and any of the @xmath76 four walls with unit normal vector @xmath77 and @xmath78 . in simulations cells circulated in an organized fashion under a wide range of noise and density values as well as for different system sizes .",
    "the online supplemental material @xcite contains a simulation videos showing the emergence of organized circular motion of model cells confined to a square box .",
    "in summary , we have presented evidence that purely short - range forces and simple experimentally motivated dynamics can be equivalent to an effective alignment term .",
    "drawing an analogy between our experimental and model results , we imply that the emergence of collective motion among keratocytes is an example of a continuous kinetic phase transition .",
