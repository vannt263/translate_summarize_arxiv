    "this viewpoint has seemingly been strengthened by    the lack of any signal for sparticles at lhc8@xcite which requires @xmath13 tev for models with @xmath14 and @xmath15 tev for models with @xmath16 and    the rather large value of @xmath0 gev@xcite which requires multi - tev top squarks with small mixing or tev - scale top squarks with large mixing@xcite .",

    "abandoning parsimony is not a step lightly taken since the further one strays from known physics the more likely one is to be wrong .",
    "but before jumping to such strong conclusions which may well guide support for and construction of future hep experimental facilities it is worthwhile to scrutinize the available measures of electroweak fine - tuning ( ewft ) in susy models .",

    "the parameters are frequently introduced to parametrize our ignorance of more fundamental physics , and their variation allows one to encompass a wide range of possibilities .",
    "we can think of each parameter as a dial , capable of being adjusted to specific , or alternatively a wide range of values . if some contribution to a measured quantity ( _ e.g. _ @xmath17 or @xmath18 in this paper ) in a theory blows up , and we have an adjustable parameter which may be dialed independently to compensate , then we may legitimately evaluate fine - tuning : is a huge , unnatural cancellation required ? alternatively ,",
    "if as a consequence of one contribution blowing up , a related dial / parameter is driven to large , opposite - sign compensating values , then any claimed fine - tuning would violate our rule ( the quantities would be _ dependent _ ) and some regrouping of terms into independent quantities should be found .",

    "<S> recent null results from lhc8 susy searches along with the discovery of a sm - like higgs boson with mass @xmath0 gev indicates sparticle masses in the tev range , causing tension with conventional measures of electroweak fine - tuning . we propose a simple _ fine - tuning rule _ which should be followed under any credible evaluation of fine - tuning . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that overestimates of electroweak fine - tuning by conventional measures all arise from violations of this rule . </S>",
    "<S> we show that to gain accord with the fine - tuning rule , then both higgs mass and the traditional @xmath1 fine - tuning measures reduce to the model - independent electroweak fine - tuning measure @xmath2 . </S>",

    "<S> then , using @xmath2 , we evaluate ew fine - tuning for a variety of susy models including msugra , nuhm1 , nuhm2 , mgmsb , mamsb , hyper - charged amsb and nine cases of mixed moduli - anomaly ( mirage ) mediated susy breaking models ( mmamsb ) whilst respecting lhc higgs mass and @xmath5-decay constraints ( we do not impose lhc8 sparticle mass constraints due to the possibility of compressed spectra within many of these models ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find msugra , mgmsb , mamsb and mmamsb models all to be highly fine - tuned . </S>",
    "<S> the nuhm1 model is moderately fine - tuned while nuhm2 which allows for radiatively - driven naturalness ( rns ) allows for fine - tuning at a meager 10% level in the case where @xmath6 gev and the tev - scale top squarks are well - mixed . </S>",
