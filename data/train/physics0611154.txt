    "although lg beams with non - zero @xmath10-indices ( i.e.  with @xmath11 intensity rings ) , will allow more freedom in the creation of exotic ring lattices , we confine our discussion in this paper to the @xmath12 case as it already allows the simple , but highly adaptable , formation of both bright and dark dynamic ring lattices .",

    "the two lg electric fields have similar maximum amplitudes and are separated by 1 fwhm .",

    "the experiment is configured in a double - pass arrangement , thus doubling the frequency shift to @xmath54 .",
    "we note that alternatively , a small frequency shift can be imposed onto a light beam by passing circularly polarized light through a rotating half wave plate @xcite , which due to an accumulated geometric or berry phase @xcite , shifts the frequency by twice the rotation speed of the waveplate .",

    "these beams are expanded to the size of the slm . for the bright lattice ,",
    "the slm is programmed with an @xmath1-forked diffraction grating and the two beams are aligned such that the positive and negative diffracted first - order , which have opposite signs of @xmath1 , subsequently interfere to give an intensity pattern rotating at angular frequency @xmath55 .    for the dark lattice we need to overlap two appropriate laguerre beams with order @xmath5 and @xmath35 .",
    "in our experiment we generated the required @xmath5 and @xmath35 forked holograms on different parts of the same slm , with each laser beam incident on one of the areas and aligned so that the reflected beams are recombined to form the @xmath56 petalled dark lattice .",
    "we note that alignment of the @xmath5 and @xmath35 beams is comparatively uncritical as the true zero intensity at the dark lattice sites results from optical vortices ( a @xmath57 electric field phase winding around the dark lattice site ) .",
    "visualization of a rotating lattice requires high speed photography . using shutter speeds down to @xmath58ns",

    "by subjecting cold atoms to the dark or bright ring lattice described above , they can be trapped in the resulting light potential . in order to limit losses due to photon scattering we assume a light beam far detuned from the atomic resonance .",
    "the ac stark potential @xmath65 , and photon scattering rate @xmath66 are related to the light intensity @xmath67 , and detuning @xmath68 by : @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 denote the linewidth and saturation intensity of the atomic transition , respectively . to illustrate the experimental feasibility of our scheme we use the two - level dipole potential approximation ,",
    "this could be extended to a higher - order multi - level atom model @xcite .",
    "we now consider the specific example of the d2 transition of @xmath72rb atoms with @xmath73 @xmath74 @xmath75w@xmath76m@xmath77 .",
    "we assume a ring lattice laser total power of @xmath78w , which is focussed to a beam waist of @xmath79 m at @xmath80 nm for trapping in the bright lattice and @xmath81 nm for trapping in the dark lattice . for a ring lattice with 10 potential wells this results in a peak intensity of @xmath82w@xmath76m@xmath60 corresponding to a potential well @xmath83k deep for the bright ( @xmath84 ) lattice and @xmath85w@xmath76m@xmath60 corresponding to @xmath86k for the dark @xmath87 lattices respectively .",

    "the optical lattice potential is sufficient to provide confinement in the transverse direction . to additionally localise atoms in the axial @xmath89 direction we suggest a hybrid trap , combining the optical lattice with a quadrupole magnetic trap @xcite . for the red lattice one could consider all - optical confinement in a tightly focused lattice with a short rayleigh range , but there is a trade - off between axial confinement and scattering rate",
    "instead , atoms could be optically pumped into magnetic weak - field - seeking states and loaded into a quadrupole magnetic potential @xmath90 .",
    "the centre of the quadrupole field could be positioned away from the beam focus to ensure a stable gouy phase . however , for a standard quadrupole gradient of @xmath91g / cm , the atoms will be confined axially to a region much smaller than the rayleigh range and the twist of the gouy phase becomes negligible . in this hybrid magnetic and optical trap",
    "one can use standard rf evaporation , allowing in - situ cooling to quantum degeneracy .",
    "circularly polarised lg lattice beams are required to maintain the symmetry between the quadrupole magnetic field and the light field and obtain a uniform ring lattice potential .",
    "alternatively , one can provide axial confinement in a ring lattice by using counterpropagating laser beams to create a standing wave , generating an axially separated stack of @xmath92 lattices similar to the method suggested in @xcite .",
    "however , by introducing a frequency shift between the forward and backwards lg beam , the individual ring lattices will not only rotate but also translate along the @xmath93-axis at a speed @xmath94 .",
    "additionally , having a single ring lattice rather than a stack of ring lattices simplifies the experiment and enables single - site addressability .",
    "our hybrid ring lattice enables the observation of the mott insulator transition in a geometry with periodic boundary conditions . to adjust the barrier depth , and hence the tunneling between sites , the relative power @xmath95 in the @xmath96 beams",
    "can be varied .",
    "experimentally , this can easily be achieved by varying the modulation amplitude of both aoms while keeping the overall light intensity constant . to make full use of all laser power ,",
    "an electro - optic modulator could be used to rotate the polarisation from the laser incident on a polarising beamsplitter leading to the two aoms .",
    "for the bright lattice",
    "@xmath95 variation directly converts a uniform ring into a ring lattice .",
    "images from our optical experiment are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4](a)-(c ) and the corresponding hybrid lattice theory in fig .",
    "[ fig:4](d)-(f ) . for the dark lattice ,",
    "the transition between uniform and multi - petalled ring is achieved by gradually dimming the outer lg beam , and outer transverse confinement is then provided by the magnetic potential ( fig .",
    "[ fig:4](g)-(i ) ) .",
    "@xmath97 respectively .",

    "this constraint is much higher than the critical rotation rate for vortex creation in 1d @xmath103rad / s for our parameters .",
