    "strongly correlated electrons are among the most interesting condensed matter systems . in particular , the doping of anti - ferromagnetic cuprate layers leads to high - temperature superconductivity .",
    "understanding the dynamics of strongly correlated electron systems is very challenging because perturbative analytic techniques fail for systems of many strongly coupled degrees of freedom . on the other hand ,",
    "numerical simulation methods are applicable in these cases .",
    "unfortunately , numerical simulations of models involving fermions are far from trivial .",
    "a standard technique is to linearize four - fermion interactions by the introduction of bosonic fields @xcite .",
    "then the fermions are integrated out , leaving behind a fermion determinant which acts as a non - local effective action for the bosonic fields . in some cases , for example , in undoped cuprate layers at",
    "half - filling , the fermion determinant is positive and can be interpreted as a probability for the bosonic field configurations .",
    "then standard importance sampling techniques can be applied to the bosonic theory . still , due to the non - locality of the effective action ,",
    "such simulations are very time consuming .",
    "in other cases of physical interest  in particular for doped cuprates away from half - filling  the fermion determinant may become negative and can hence not be interpreted as a probability for the bosonic configurations . when the sign of the fermion determinant is included in measured observables ,",
    "the fluctuations in the sign give rise to dramatic cancellations . as a consequence ,",
    "the relative statistical errors of observables grow exponentially with the volume and the inverse temperature of the system .",
    "this makes it impossible in practice to simulate large systems in the low - temperature limit .",
    "in particular , the fermion sign problem prevents numerical simulations of the hubbard model away from half - filling and is the major stumbling block against understanding high - temperature superconductivity with numerical methods .",
    "dealing with the fermion sign problem after the fermions have been integrated out is incredibly complicated since the resulting bosonic effective action is non - local . before integrating them out ,",
    "fermions are usually described by anti - commuting grassmann variables which are practically impossible to simulate directly . here",
    "we propose a different strategy .",
    "instead of working with grassmann coherent states , we formulate the fermionic path integral in the fock state basis of the hilbert space . then a fermion configuration is described in terms of bosonic occupation numbers which define fermion world - lines . in this case , the bosonic occupation numbers interact locally . however , besides the positive bosonic boltzmann weight , there is a fermion permutation sign that results from the pauli principle .",
    "two fermions that interchange their positions during the euclidean time - evolution give rise to a minus - sign . in general",
    ", the fermion world - lines which are periodic in euclidean time define a permutation of fermion positions .",
    "the sign of this permutation is the fermion sign .",
    "the resulting sign problem is often more severe than the one associated with the fermion determinant .",
    "for example , in the world - line formulation a sign problem arises for the hubbard model even at half - filling , while the fermion determinant is positive in that case .",
    "fortunately , in the fock state basis the sign problem can be completely eliminated , at least in a large ( but still restricted ) class of models .",
    "this was first demonstrated for a system of spinless lattice fermions in @xcite by re - writing the partition function in terms of the statistical mechanics of closed loops with non - negative boltzmann weights .",
    "loops with a certain topology , referred to as _ merons _ , do not contribute to the partition function .",
    "a local algorithm was constructed in the loop space which avoided meron - clusters and thus solved the sign problem .",
    "it is well known that spinless fermions can be converted to relativistic staggered fermions by introducing carefully chosen phase factors with every fermion hop @xcite . using this strategy ,",
    "the solution to the fermion sign problem with spinless fermions has been exploited to extensively study the critical behavior of a second order chiral phase transition in the universality class of the ising model @xcite .    here",
    "we extend these successful techniques to fermions with spin and , in particular , to systems in the hubbard model family . using a specific example ,",
    "we show how one can build models so that the sign problem is completely solved . for technical reasons related to the details of the cancellation of signs",
    ", the method does not apply to the standard hubbard model hamiltonian .",
    "additional terms must be included .",
    "still , the modifications do not affect the symmetries of the problem and we believe that the physics of some of the models discussed here is qualitatively similar to the standard hubbard model .",
    "it should be pointed out that there is no reason to concentrate on the standard hubbard model except for the simple form of its hamiltonian .",
    "the fact that for similar hamiltonians our method can completely eliminate the sign problem and yield a very efficient fermion algorithm  which is not the case for the standard hubbard model  is reason enough to replace the standard hubbard model by a modified hamiltonian .",
    "after all , we want to focus on understanding the general physical phenomena underlying high - temperature superconductivity  not necessarily on the details of one particular model hamiltonian .",
    "interestingly , in the modified model the sign problem can be eliminated even in the presence of an on - site repulsion at a finite chemical potential as long as a certain inequality is satisfied .",
    "let us first discuss the nature of the fermion sign problem .",
    "we consider a fermionic path integral @xmath0 } { \\mbox{sign}}[n ] \\exp(-s[n])\\ ] ] over configurations of occupation numbers @xmath1 with a boltzmann weight whose magnitude is @xmath2)$ ] and sign is @xmath3 = \\pm 1 $ ] . here",
    "$ ] is the action of a corresponding bosonic model with partition function @xmath5 } \\exp(-s[n]).\\ ] ] a fermionic observable @xmath6 $ ] is obtained in a simulation of the bosonic ensemble as @xmath7 } o[n ] { \\mbox{sign}}[n ] \\exp(-s[n ] ) = \\frac{\\langle o \\ {",
    "\\mbox{sign}}\\rangle}{\\langle { \\mbox{sign}}\\rangle}.\\ ] ] the average sign in the simulated bosonic ensemble is given by @xmath8 } { \\mbox{sign}}[n ] \\exp(-s[n ] ) } =   \\frac{z_f}{z_b } = \\exp(- \\beta v \\delta f).\\ ] ] the expectation value of the sign is exponentially small in both the volume @xmath9 and the inverse temperature @xmath10 because the difference between the free energy densities @xmath11 of the fermionic and bosonic systems is always positive .",
    "hence , the fermionic expectation value @xmath12  although of order one  is measured as the ratio of two exponentially small signals which are very hard to extract from the statistical noise .",
    "this is the origin of the sign problem .",
    "we can estimate the statistical error of the average sign in an ideal simulation of the bosonic ensemble which generates @xmath13 completely uncorrelated configurations as @xmath14 the last equality results from taking the large @xmath15 limit and using @xmath16 . in order to determine the average sign with sufficient accuracy one needs on the order of @xmath17 measurements . for large volumes and small temperatures",
    "this is impossible in practice .    in the meron - cluster approach one solves the sign problem in two steps . in the first step one",
    "analytically re - writes the partition function using new variables such that it is possible to exactly cancel all negative weight configurations with configurations of positive weights .",
    "this group of configurations then does not contribute to the partition function .",
    "the remaining configurations are guaranteed to be positive .",
    "thus , in the new variables , one effectively obtains boltzmann weights with @xmath18 . at this stage , despite the fact that all negative signs have been eliminated , only one half of the sign problem has been solved since an algorithm that naively generates configurations with @xmath19 or @xmath20 generates an exponentially large number of zero weight configurations .",
    "thus , it is important to introduce a second step in which one avoids configurations that have been canceled analytically . in practice",
    "it is often useful to allow these zero - weight configurations to occur in a controlled manner since these configurations may contribute to observables . in a numerical algorithm",
    "a local metropolis decision ensures that contributions of @xmath21 and @xmath20 occur with similar probabilities .",
    "this solves the sign problem completely .      the central idea behind",
    "the meron - cluster method is to express the partition function , which is originally written as a sum over weights of fermion occupation number configurations , as a sum over weights of configurations which contain both fermions and new bond variables .",
    "mathematically this means @xmath22 } { \\mbox{sign}}[n ] \\exp(-s[n ] ) = \\sum_{[n , b ] } { \\mbox{sign}}[n , b ]   \\exp(-s[n , b])\\ ] ] where the bond variables @xmath23 carry information about whether two lattice sites are connected or not .",
    "a cluster is defined as a set of connected lattice sites whose flip exchanges occupied and empty sites , i.e. , the occupied sites on that cluster are emptied and the originally empty sites now become occupied .",
    "this step of re - writing the partition function is well known and has been used in earlier attempts of constructing fermion cluster algorithms as discussed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the recent progress results from the observation that the sign problem contained in a partition function of the form ( [ pfnb ] ) is completely solvable if the magnitude @xmath24 $ ] and the sign @xmath25 $ ] of the boltzmann weight satisfy three requirements :    1 .   the magnitude of the boltzmann weight @xmath26)$ ] does not change when any cluster is flipped .",
    "the effect of a cluster - flip on the sign of the boltzmann weight @xmath25 $ ] is independent of the orientation of all other clusters .",
    "starting from any configuration @xmath27 $ ] , it must be possible to flip clusters and reach a _ reference _",
    "configuration @xmath28 $ ] , which is guaranteed to have a positive boltzmann weight .",
    "in addition , a formula for the change in the sign of a configuration due to a cluster - flip has been derived recently @xcite . using this formula and other tricks",
    "it is usually possible to satisfy the first two properties for any given model .",
    "restrictions in the class of solvable models arise due to the inability to satisfy the third property listed above , i.e. , the existence of a reference configuration .",
    "however , we have been able to construct useful reference configurations for a variety of models .",
    "the essential consequence of the three basic properties necessary for the meron - cluster approach to work is that clusters can be characterized by their effect on the sign .",
    "clusters whose flip changes the sign are referred to as merons .",
    "clearly a configuration with a meron - cluster contributes zero to the partition function after a partial re - summation over cluster - flips is performed .",
    "all configurations without any merons contribute positively to the partition function .",
    "thus the partition function can be re - written in terms of positive semi - definite boltzmann weights , i.e. , @xmath18 . in order to avoid the zero - weight configurations , a re - weighting method that eliminates configurations containing multiple meron - clusters",
    "is included . in order to perform this re - weighting , all observables",
    "must also be measured using improved estimators .",
    "fortunately , this is possible for most quantities of physical interest .",
    "usually , physically interesting observables receive non - zero contributions also from configurations containing merons . for example , vacuum condensates receive contributions from the one - meron sector whereas observables derived from certain two - point correlation functions receive contributions from zero- and two - meron configurations only .",
    "four - point correlation functions also receive non - zero contributions from four - meron configurations .",
    "fortunately , one is usually not interested in multi - point correlation functions and for most purposes one can completely eliminate the configurations with more than two merons .",
    "this is exactly what happens in the re - weighting step of the meron - cluster algorithm . in this paper",
    "we do not discuss the re - weighting step although this is an essential part of the complete solution of the sign problem .",
    "we assume that once all negative signs are eliminated , one can design a re - weighting step that does not generate exponentially long auto - correlation times .",
    "although the three requirements for solving the sign problem with the meron - cluster method are somewhat restrictive , a large class of hamiltonians for strongly interacting fermions is consistent with them .",
    "for example , in the case of spinless fermions it is necessary to include a certain amount of nearest - neighbor fermion repulsion @xcite or a large chemical potential @xcite depending on the hopping term .",
    "as we will see , similar restrictions arise for fermions with spin .",
    "in particular , the standard hubbard model hamiltonian can not be treated with our method , while slightly modified models in the hubbard model family can . in this paper",
    "we construct a large class of @xmath29 spin symmetric hamiltonians for spin one - half fermions with nearest - neighbor interactions to which the meron - cluster method can be applied .",
    "the numerical results for one such model related to s - wave superconductivity have been discussed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the meron - cluster idea was first developed for a bosonic model with a complex action  the 2-d @xmath30 model at non - zero vacuum - angle @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "the term meron was introduced first to denote half - instantons .",
    "indeed the meron - clusters in the 2-d @xmath30 model are half - instantons @xcite .",
    "the instanton number is the integer - valued topological charge @xmath32 , which gives rise to a complex phase @xmath33 that contributes to the boltzmann factor . at @xmath34",
    "the phase factor reduces to a sign @xmath35 , which distinguishes between sectors with even and odd topological charges . in the 2-d @xmath30 model",
    "the meron - clusters carry half - integer topological charges .",
    "when such a cluster is flipped , its topological charge changes sign and hence the total topological charge of the configuration changes by an odd integer .",
    "thus , the phase factor @xmath36 changes sign when a meron - cluster is flipped .",
    "similarly , a meron - flip in the fermion cluster algorithm changes the sign of a fermion world - line configuration . interestingly",
    "a @xmath37 topological number can be assigned to each fermionic configuration .",
    "any configuration with @xmath38 is topologically trivial because it represents an even permutation of fermions .",
    "a configuration with @xmath39 is topologically distinct , because an odd permutation can not be changed into an even one by a continuous deformation of fermion world - lines . in this sense ,",
    "configurations with @xmath39 are instantons . flipping any meron changes the fermion sign and",
    "hence unwinds the instanton .",
    "in two spatial dimensions one can extend the analogy to the 2-d @xmath30 model even further .",
    "then particles can exist with any statistics , characterized by a parameter @xmath31 that varies between @xmath40 for bosons and @xmath34 for fermions . for anyons",
    "the fermion sign is replaced by a complex phase factor @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the integer - valued hopf number . in that case",
    "the merons are half - hopf - instantons .",
    "the merons are not just of algorithmic interest .",
    "in fact , they are physical objects that allow us to understand the topology of the fermion world - lines and hence the origin of the fermion sign .",
    "the merons effectively bosonize a fermionic theory .",
    "when a fermionic model is formulated in terms of bosonic occupation numbers which interact locally , the fermion sign still induces non - local topological interactions .",
    "hence , the resulting theory is not really bosonized .",
    "the merons , however , decompose the global topology of the fermion world - lines into manageable contributions that are local on the scale of the correlation length .",
    "this allows us to simulate fermions almost as efficiently as bosons .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "the essential ideas behind the meron - cluster approach are illustrated for the simple case of spinless fermions .",
    "we discuss how the three properties necessary for the complete solution to the sign problem , discussed in section [ mcm ] , place restrictions on the class of models that are solvable with the meron - cluster algorithm . in section 3",
    "we build a class of models of fermions with spin which are solvable using meron - cluster methods .",
    "we also discuss improved estimators for some physical quantities useful for the study of superconductivity that receive contributions from zero- and two - meron configurations and present some data from a recent numerical simulation .",
    "we also show how one can extend these models by adding new terms to the hamiltonian that appear to violate the properties necessary for the meron - cluster method to work but do not introduce sign problems .",
    "in particular , we show how a repulsive hubbard model becomes solvable in the presence of a chemical potential .",
    "section 4 contains a discussion of the efficiency of meron - cluster algorithms .",
    "finally , in section 5 we end with some conclusions .",
    "let us illustrate the essential steps that yield solutions to sign problems in the meron - cluster approach using the example of spinless fermions .",
    "this is essentially a combination of results first discussed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this will serve as a preparation for the main subject of this paper  namely fermions with spin .",
    "we consider fermions hopping on a @xmath43-dimensional cubic lattice of volume @xmath44 sites with periodic or anti - periodic spatial boundary conditions .",
    "the fermions are described by creation and annihilation operators @xmath45 and @xmath46 with standard anti - commutation relations @xmath47 following jordan and wigner @xcite we represent these operators by pauli matrices @xmath48 where @xmath49 = i \\delta_{lm } \\epsilon_{ijk } \\sigma_l^k.\\ ] ] here @xmath50 labels the lattice point @xmath51 .",
    "the jordan - wigner representation requires an ordering of the lattice points .",
    "for example , one can label the point @xmath52 by @xmath53 .",
    "it can be shown that the physics is completely independent of the ordering .",
    "further , the jordan - wigner representation works in any dimension .    instead of considering the most general model that can be solved using the meron - concept , we restrict ourselves to a class of hamiltonians that conserve particle number .",
    "from the discussion below it will become clear how to extend the ideas presented here to other hamiltonians while maintaining the ability to solve the associated sign problem . with this in mind we focus on a hamilton operator of the form @xmath54 which is a sum of nearest - neighbor hamiltonians @xmath55 given by @xmath56 which couples the fermion operators at the lattice sites @xmath51 and @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is a unit - vector in the @xmath59-direction .",
    "next we decompose the hamilton operator into @xmath60 terms @xmath61 with @xmath62 note that the individual contributions to a given @xmath63 commute with each other , but two different @xmath63 do not commute . using the trotter - suzuki formula",

    "we discover that in the present model the effect of a cluster - flip on the sign of a configuration in general depends on the orientation of other clusters . in particular ,",
    "if two clusters cross each other in an odd number of @xmath137-type cross - bonds then the flip of one cluster has an effect on whether the other cluster - flip changes the configuration sign or not .",

    "we see that all sites in a given cluster have the same occupation number , i.e. , all are either empty or all are occupied .",

    "clearly , this is the case when @xmath219 for any @xmath66 . interestingly , since the size of the cluster @xmath220 is always greater than or equal to @xmath221 , it is possible to show that even when @xmath222 and @xmath223 the factor remains positive .",
    "this means that we have found a repulsive hubbard - type model in which it is possible to add a limited chemical potential before the sign problem kicks in .",
    "although it is likely that the interesting physics of high-@xmath166 superconductivity is beyond this region , it appears worthwhile to study this novel model in this region of parameter space where the sign problem remains solved .",
    "it is likely that something interesting can be learned there .",
    "finally , in the @xmath224 limit one recovers the heisenberg anti - ferromagnet .",
    "anti - ferromagnetism is known to be a part of the high-@xmath166 phase diagram .",
    "representing the partition function in terms of the statistical mechanics of clusters interacting locally has the obvious advantage that numerical simulations can become efficient . in this section we compare the efficiency of the meron - cluster algorithm with that of conventional fermion algorithms .",
    "the efficiency of a numerical simulation method can be characterized by the computational cost ( the computer time @xmath225 ) that one must invest in order to reach a given numerical accuracy .",
    "obviously , the cost depends on the @xmath43-dimensional spatial volume @xmath44 , where @xmath203 is the number of lattice points per direction . in addition",
    ", one usually discretizes the euclidean time - direction of extent @xmath226 into @xmath67 time - steps of size @xmath227 , such that the computational cost increases as one approaches the time continuum limit @xmath228 . besides these two obvious dependences",
    ", @xmath225 typically also depends on the spatial correlation length @xmath229 via a dynamical exponent @xmath230 that characterizes the severity of critical slowing down .",
    "further , even if @xmath229 is small , the correlation length @xmath231 in the time - direction becomes large in units of the temporal lattice spacing @xmath227 when one approaches the time continuum limit .",
    "hence , there is another dynamical critical exponent @xmath232 that characterizes the corresponding slowing down .",
    "altogether , the total computational cost is typically given by @xmath233.\\ ] ]    standard local algorithms for bosonic systems  for example , the metropolis algorithm  have @xmath234 .",
    "this makes it difficult to simulate systems close to a critical point , i.e.  for large @xmath229 , or close to the time continuum limit , i.e.  for small @xmath227 .",
    "local over - relaxation algorithms can be fine - tuned to reach @xmath235 .",
    "efficient non - local cluster algorithms , on the other hand , are far superior because they can reach @xmath236 .",
    "algorithms for bosonic systems typically require a computational effort that increases linearly with the space - time volume , i.e.  @xmath237 and @xmath238 . for simulations of fermionic systems",
    "this is typically not the case , even when there is no sign problem .",
    "usually , one integrates out the fermions and simulates a bosonic theory with the fermion determinant defining a non - local effective action . the standard fermion algorithm that is most popular in simulations of strongly correlated electron systems @xcite computes the determinant of a large matrix of a size proportional to the spatial volume .",
    "this requires a computational effort proportional to the spatial volume cubed , i.e.  @xmath239 , even when there is no sign problem , and hence @xmath240.\\ ] ] a modification of this algorithm proposed in @xcite has @xmath241 .",
    "it should be noted that fermion algorithms that have originally been developed for qcd simulations have also been applied to strongly correlated electron systems without a sign problem .",
    "the hybrid monte carlo algorithm @xcite that was used in @xcite has @xmath242,\\ ] ] and the multi - boson algorithm @xcite used in @xcite has @xmath243.\\ ] ] here we have taken the optimistic point of view that one can , at least in principle , reach @xmath235 by fine - tuning these algorithms .",
    "their computational cost has a much better large volume behavior than the standard algorithm , but they are not necessarily superior on the presently studied moderate size lattices .    when there is a sign problem , the computational cost of the above algorithms increases even exponentially  not just as a power  in the space - time volume . as discussed before , @xmath244 such that formally @xmath245 . in practice",
    ", this means that systems with a severe sign problem can simply not be simulated .",
    "the meron - cluster algorithm allows us to deal with the sign problem extremely efficiently .",
    "in particular , the computational cost increases only linearly with the space - time volume , such that @xmath237 and @xmath246 .",
    "still , this does not necessarily mean that we can reach @xmath247 as in cluster simulations of bosonic models .",
    "this is due to the re - weighting step in the meron - cluster algorithm . in this step",
    "the clusters are locally reconnected such that multi - meron configurations are never generated .",
    "for example , a non - meron - cluster may be decomposed into two meron - clusters only if this does not increase the total meron number beyond two . deciding if a newly generated cluster is a meron naively requires a computational effort proportional to @xmath229 , such that @xmath248 for the meron - cluster algorithm .",
    "however , with recent improvements in the implementation we have been able to reduce this effort to only grow with @xmath249 .",
    "a nice feature of the meron - cluster algorithm is that  like other cluster algorithms  it can be implemented directly in the euclidean time continuum @xcite .",
    "this completely eliminates all time discretization errors and all @xmath227-factors in the computational cost .",
    "the total computer time that is required to reach a given numerical accuracy with the meron - cluster algorithm is hence given by @xmath250,\\ ] ] and it is likely that @xmath236 . this is better than standard methods even when there is no sign problem , and exponentially better than any alternative method when there is a severe sign problem .",
    "in this article we have outlined the essential steps that lead to a novel formulation of fermionic lattice theories . the essential idea behind the new approach is to find a cluster representation of the partition function .",
    "we have shown that in this approach new models can be formulated for which the sign problem can be completely eliminated .",
    "further , although the clusters themselves are non - local they interact locally and carry information about two - point correlations .",
    "this makes them especially attractive for numerical simulations .",
    "given the difficulty in the numerical treatment of fermionic theories , this alternative approach turns out to be very useful .",
    "there are many interesting questions that remain unanswered in the case of strongly correlated electron systems . among these the physics of competing ground states that may exist in high-@xmath166 materials as the doping concentration is increased",
    "is one of the most challenging .",
    "the model we have constructed appears to have many interesting features that are relevant for this type of questions .",
    "this includes anti - ferromagnetism and s - wave superconductivity at the two extremes of the parameter ranges",
    ". it would be interesting if this model shows d - wave superconductivity or striped phases in some intermediate range of parameters .",
    "most importantly , the new hubbard - type hamilton operator is well suited for numerical work in a large region of parameter space",
    ". it would be interesting to study this model in this range .",
    "as a first step a mean field analysis may be useful .",
    "the superconductor - insulator transition is another interesting field of research that the present progress may shed some light on @xcite .",
    "the attractive hubbard model with disorder has recently been used to study this type of quantum phase transition @xcite .",
    "we believe that the hamilton operator of eq.([hubbh ] ) with disorder is an alternative model for this purpose .",
    "this is possible because the sign problem remains solved in the presence of disorder .",
    "further , since the algorithm for the new model is expected to be much more efficient , it may be possible to go to much smaller temperatures",
    ".    it would be interesting to find extensions of the present work to fields like nuclear physics and to nano - science applications like quantum dots .",
    "it is easy to construct models with four layers representing spin and isospin which naturally describe the physics of nucleons",
    ". it would be useful to construct these explicitly so that we can be sure that the relevant symmetries can be maintained .",
    "extensions of the cluster techniques to models in the continuum is another useful direction .",
    "preliminary work shows that the non - relativistic free fermion model of eq.([freef ] ) can be extended to the continuum",
    ". it would be interesting if this approach can be extended to other interacting non - relativistic free fermions .",
