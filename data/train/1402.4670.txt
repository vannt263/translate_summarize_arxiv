    "the use of concepts and techniques from statical mechanics to solve hard computational problems has been very fruitful , in particular the application of montecarlo methods to integrate in high dimensions has been defined a revolution@xcite with examples that range from the resolution of combinatorial optimization problems@xcite to the simulation of complex physical systems@xcite .",
    "one simple yet non - trivial computational issue concerns the uniform sampling of convex regions in high dimension .",
    "this is for instance the main step for the volume computation of convex bodies@xcite , a problem that can be mapped in general onto the calculation of a permanent@xcite and thus it is # p - hard . even if deterministically non - polynomial , this computation can be carried out with a stochastic algorithm in polynomial time provided a uniform sampling of the body in interest , and this is one of the cases in which the dramatic improvement accomplished by a stochastic method can be rigorously demonstrated@xcite . apart from that , an uniform sampling of convex regions is generally required in solving inference problems from uniform priors given by linear constraints : examples include recostrutions of mass distributions from gravitational lensing in astrophysics@xcite and the statistical analysis of stationary fluxes in metabolic networks@xcite . in principle",
    "the uniform sampling can be done by simple interpolation if all the vertices of a polyhedron are known , but since their number can increase exponentially with the dimension this makes their enumeration often infeasible .",
    "approximate algorithms based on linear programming that find a subset of rapresentative vertices are sometimes used@xcite , but they do not guarantee the uniformity of the sampling@xcite . on the other hand , several classes of random walks have been developed in order to achieve effective uniform sampling , such as the grid - walk and the ball - walk algorithms@xcite . the most efficient montecarlo method for sampling so far is the hit - and - run algorithm@xcite .",
    "the hit - and - run algorithm has been extensively studied , focusing in particular on the convergence time to the stationary uniform distribution , that is polynomial in the dimension space with a bound that is the best obtained so far for convex body sampling@xcite .",
    "two bottlenecks of this algorithm regard the heterogeneity of the scales and the difficulty to escape from narrow angles in high dimension .",
    "the first has been the focus of many research efforts@xcite , whereas the second problem instead is less investigated since it is much improved with respect to simpler random walks@xcite .",
    "however this issue can still affects the convergence properties and the focus of our work will be thus on this problem . on the other hand , one of the issues arising in the simulation of large scale disordered systems in condensed matter and statistical mechanics is the entrapment in metastable states , a problem that inspired the formulation of optimized montecarlo schemes@xcite like for instance overelaxing techniques . these methods , originally proposed in the context of quantum field theories@xcite , they were extended in the field statistical mechanics of spin systems@xcite , and recently applied to general problems of inference@xcite .",
    "the basic idea of these methods is to select , during the dynamics , a change for the current point in a region of phase space which is as far as possible from the old value .",
    "inspired by this strategy in this paper we introduce a new hit - and - run algorithm by overelaxing the dynamics and thus allowing the sample points to get out faster from corners . in the first section , after a brief description of the original method , we will outline in detail the structure of our algorithm ; in the second we will discuss its performance showing numerical results of extensive simulations on high dimensional simplices , pointing out the ability of the walk to avoid the entrapment in tight angles .",
    "then we will show an application in the field of constraint - based modeling of cell metabolism , and finally , we will draw out some conclusions summarizing the main results and pointing out several interesting future extensions for our work .",
    "given an @xmath0-dimensional convex set @xmath1 , from which one wants to sample from , and a point @xmath2 , the hit - and - run algorithm is defined as follows :    1 .   choose a uniformly distributed direction @xmath3 ; 2 .",
    "choose uniformly @xmath4 3 .",
    "move to the point @xmath5 , increment @xmath6 by one and start again from ( i ) .",
    "the first step can be carried out with the marsaglia method , i.e. by generating @xmath0 independent gaussian random variables with unit variance and then normalizing them . in the overelaxed version of the algorithm , after drawing the segment trough the current point , we do nt extract uniformly another point on this segment but rather we sample it in an anti - correlated fashion with the current point , paying attention to mantain the detailed balance with respect to the uniform distribution .",
    "if the subsesequent points of the markov chain are anticorrelated in such a way that their distances increase with respect to the normal algorithm they should explore the feasible space in reduced times . the simplest choice for the marginal conidtional distribution on the segment that we can think of is linear .",
    "let s put the origin on one extrem of the segment , the other being @xmath7 ( lenght of the segment ) , if the coordinate of the current point along the segment is @xmath8 , a correctly normalized conditional marginal distribution that verifies detailed balance is ( see the appendix for a straightforward derivation ) : @xmath9 this expression is symmetric with respect @xmath6 and @xmath8 and thus implement detailed balance with respect to the uniform distribution . here",
    "@xmath10 rules the correlation between @xmath6 and @xmath8 : a choice that maximizes the anticorrelation is @xmath11 , we have @xmath12 this can be integrated and inverted and it gives @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a random number uniformly distributed in @xmath15 $ ] . in fig [ fig0 ] we illustrate schematically the algorithm .    [ fig0 ]        the algorithm has no free parameters and its computational cost with respect to the normal algorithm requires only the evaluation of expression [ calct ] .",
    "lovasz showed in@xcite that the simple hit and run dynamics mixes in @xmath16 steps , when applied to a convex body whose circumscribed and inscribed sphere have respectively radii @xmath14 and @xmath17 .",
    "an high value of the factor @xmath18 stands for somehow ill - conditioned costraints that defines bodies with very heterogeneous scales and can be reduced in general to @xmath19 by appropriate preprocessing@xcite , the @xmath20 factor is instead partially related to the difficulty in escaping from tight angles , as we will show in the next paragraph .",
    "a natural class of homogeneous convex bodies over which explore the properties of our method are the simplices @xmath21 .",
    "we thus measure the center of mass monitoring its dependence from the elapsed machine time on bodies of exponentially increasing dimension .",
    "in fig.2 we show the error as a fuction of the machine time on the first coordinate of the center of mass for simpleces of dimensions @xmath22 respectively ( averages are taken over @xmath23 samples ) .",
    "the overelaxed algorithm shows a lower error with a decrease that is approximatively constant @xmath24 , that leads to an improvement of the samplig times of the order @xmath25 .",

    "we have thus measured the escaping times from angles in simpleces in both algorithms : starting from a point in the corner with coordinates @xmath28 , @xmath29 ( we consider @xmath30 ) we repeteadly measure the time it takes in order that the distance from this corner becomes lower than the distance from the center of mass . in fig .",

    "as a matter of illustration of the application of our algorithm in the field of the inference from uniform priors defined by linear constraints we performed a statistical analysis of the stationary fluxes of the catabolic core of the genome - scale reconstruction of a metabolic network of the bacterium e.coli@xcite .",
    "cell metabolism relies on a network of enzymes that is able to degrade nutrients in order to fullfil all the cell free energy requirements .",
    "the simplest model of metabolism is a chemical reaction network in the steady state and it is the only one computationally feasible if kinetic details are unknown as it is the case for large scale instances .",

    "if a clear objective function is lacking and in order to retrieve general statistical properties of the network , a recent interesting issue regards the unbiased sampling of feasible flux states from the constraints ( [ mb ] ) .",

    "this permits to hasten the inference from uniform priors given by linear constraints and an example in the field of constraint - based modeling of cell metabolism was given .",
