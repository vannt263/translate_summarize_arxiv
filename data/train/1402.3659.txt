    "it plays an important role in the discussion of the stability of solutions and numerical approximations of the equations of hydrodynamics .",
    "the exact value of the constant is known only for a small class of domains , first for balls and ellipsoids ( derived from the cosserat spectrum @xcite ) , then in three dimensions for spherical shells @xcite , and finally in two dimensions for annular domains @xcite and some domains defined by simple conformal images of a disk @xcite , @xcite .",
    "its precise value remains , however , unknown for such simple domains as a square .",
    "finding estimates , from below and from above , for @xmath0 has therefore been an important subject for many years .",
    "the question can be rephrased in terms of the cosserat eigenvalue problem , see relation below , and it is this problem that we will study in the present paper .",
    "in particular , any number known to belong to the nontrivial part of the spectrum of the cosserat operator will imply an upper bound for the lbb constant .",
    "other inequalities and eigenvalue problems are known to be related to the cosserat eigenvalue problem and the lbb condition , namely the korn and friedrichs inequalities . in two dimensions in particular ,",
    "such relations have been investigated since the paper @xcite by friedrichs , and the equivalence between these inequalities and equations between the corresponding constants have been studied in the classical paper @xcite by horgan and payne , see @xcite for improved versions of some of their results .    for the cosserat eigenvalue problem ,",
    "the values @xmath11 and @xmath12 are eigenvalues of infinite multiplicity , and @xmath13 is an accumulation point of eigenvalues . on smooth domains ,",
    "these are the only points in the essential spectrum , as shown by mikhlin @xcite , see @xcite for a complete proof for @xmath14 domains . on non - smooth domains ,",

    "* ( 6.39 ) ) a conjecture was offered that amounts to @xmath19 , which is obviously incompatible with the upper bound @xmath20 from .",
    "although already conjectured in @xcite , it is still unknown whether this latter inequality is an equality or whether it is strict , that is , whether for the square there exist cosserat eigenvalues below the minimum of the essential spectrum . in section  [ s : rectangles ]",
    "below , we present numerical evidence suggesting that there are no such eigenvalues .",
    "but this is not yet proven .    for three - dimensional domains with edges , the two - dimensional corner domain transversal to",
    "the edge implies an inclusion of the corresponding interval in the essential spectrum , which therefore always contains such an interval symmetric with respect to the point @xmath13 ( see section  [ ss : edges ] ) .",
    "this is very different from the case of smooth domains , where there exists the known example of the ball that has a cosserat spectrum consisting ( apart from the trivial point @xmath12 ) of a sequence of eigenvalues @xmath21 , @xmath22 , converging to @xmath13 from below and therefore has no spectrum in the interval @xmath23@xcite .    for three - dimensional bounded domains having conical boundary points with tangent cones of revolution , we present in section  [ ss : cones ] numerical results showing that there are also intervals contained in the essential spectrum of the cosserat operator .",
    "the cosserat eigenvalue problem as originally formulated by e. and f. cosserat @xcite can be written as follows : find nontrivial @xmath24 and @xmath25 such that @xmath26 this is the spectral problem of the bounded selfadjoint operator @xmath27 on @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the inverse of the laplace operator with dirichlet conditions @xmath30 .    on the orthogonal complement of the kernel of @xmath31 , which is the eigenspace for the trivial eigenvalue @xmath32 , this operator is equivalent to the operator @xmath33 the schur complement operator of the stokes system .",
