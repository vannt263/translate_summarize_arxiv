    "in recent years several observational surveys appear to show that the universe is currently undergoing an accelerated expansion phase ( for a review see @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "astrophysical observations on galactic scales gave us a clear indication that the amount of the luminous matter is not enough to account for the rotation curves of galaxies .",
    "these remarkable observations have radically changed our ideas about the evolution of the universe .",
    "in fact , the only way in which this behaviour can be explained within the standard friedmann general relativistic cosmology framework is to invoke two dark matter components , one with a conventional dust equation of state ( @xmath1 ) needed to fit astrophysical data on galactic scales ( dark matter ) and the other with a more exotic equation of state @xmath2 needed to explain the current accelerated expansion phase of the universe ( dark energy ) . there is little doubt that unraveling the nature of dark matter and dark energy is currently one of the most important problems in theoretical physics .",
    "one approach to the problem of dark energy that has received considerable attention in the last few years is the modification of general relativity on cosmological scales . in this approach",
    "one supposes that dark energy is a manifestation of a non - einsteinian behaviour of the gravitational interaction rather than a new form of energy density .",
    "the introduction of corrections to the hilbert einstein action and their effects have been studied for long time and are believed to be unavoidable when the quantum nature of the universe is introduced in general relativity ( gr ) .    in the last few years",
    "many different extended versions of the einstein theory of gravity have been proposed .",
    "one of the most studied approaches is higher order theories of gravity @xmath3 $ ] , in which the gravitational action is nonlinear in the ricci curvature and/or it s derivatives @xcite .",
    "these theories have a number of interesting features on cosmological and astrophysical scales .",
    "in fact they are known to admit natural inflation phases @xcite and to explain the flattening of the galactic rotation curves @xcite .",
    "another very interesting feature of these models is that the higher order corrections to hilbert - einstein action can be viewed as an effective fluid which can mimic the properties of dark energy @xcite .",
    "one of the the main problems that occurs in the study of higher order theories of gravity is that finding exact cosmological solutions is extremely difficult due to the high degree of non - linearity exhibited by these theories .",
    "this problem can be partially addressed using a suitable choice of generalized coordinates in which the field equations can be written as a system of first - order autonomous differential equations together with a constraint equation @xcite . in this way we can exploit the methods of dynamical systems theory @xcite in order to both understand the qualitative behavior of the cosmological dynamics and obtain special exact solutions of the cosmological equations .",
    "the general approach allowing one to analyze higher order gravity with dynamical systems techniques has been presented elsewhere @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will apply this approach to an important class of theories with lagrangian density @xmath4\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the cosmological constant .",

    "the evolution equations for the variables are given by @xmath34 where the prime represents the derivatives with respect to the time variable @xmath35 .",
    "this system is completed with the friedmann constraint , @xmath36 which defines a hyperplane in the total phase space of the system .",

    "it is clear from the above equations that @xmath38 ( corresponding to the @xmath39 plane ) is an invariant submanifold .",
    "specifically , if we choose @xmath40 as an initial condition for our cosmological evolution , any general orbit can only approach @xmath38 asymptotically .",
    "this implies that no orbit crosses the @xmath39 plane and consequently no global attractor can exist .",
    "setting @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , we obtain four fixed points .",
    "we can obtain exact cosmological solutions at these points using the equation , @xmath44 in fact , at any fixed point , equation reduces to @xmath45 where @xmath46 and the quantities @xmath47 are meant to be calculated at the fixed point .",

    "however , by direct substitution into the cosmological equations it can be shown that these fixed points can not be considered as physical points , which means that although we can choose initial conditions as close as we want to these points , the cosmology will never evolve according to these solutions .",

    "the contracting or expanding nature of this solution depends on the direction of approach of the orbits with respect to the hypersurface @xmath59 .",
    "this hypersurface divides the phase space in two hypervolumes characterized by a contracting or expanding evolution .",
    "in particular , for @xmath60 the orbits describe a contracting universe , while for @xmath61 they represent an expanding one .",
