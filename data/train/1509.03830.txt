    "in cosmology a discussion of a problem of the false vacuum and the possibility of its decay began from the papers by coleman and his colleagues @xcite .",
    "krauss in @xcite analyzing properties of the false vacuum as a quantum unstable ( quasi  stationary ) state @xmath0 drawn an attention to the problem that there may exist universes in which the lowest energy state is the false vacuum state and such that they can survive up to the times much later than times @xmath1 when the canonical exponential decay law holds ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the study of cosmological models with unstable vacua have become particularly important in the context of the discovery of the higgs boson and of finding its mass @xmath2 to be @xmath3 [ gev ] @xcite .",
    "it is because the standard model calculations performed for the higgs particle suggests that the electroweak vacuum is unstable if the mass of the higgs particle is around 125  126 gev @xcite , which means that our universe may be the universe with unstable vacuum . in this paper",
    "we analyze multiverse made up of ensembles of stable and unstable universes .",
    "the property of the universe `` to be unstable '' or `` to be stable '' is determined by properties of the vacuum state : if the vacuum state of the universe is a false vacuum then this vacuum state is unstable and it decay into the true vacuum state and thus this universe decays too .",
    "the decay of the false vacuum is a quantum decay process .",
    "so the quantum theory of unstable states seems to be an appropriate tool for the general analysis of the decay process of the false vacuum state and may help in understanding and explaining the various subtleties and properties of this process .",
    "the important question is under what conditions some universes can survive up to times much later than the canonical decay times and how long they are able to survive .",
    "an answer for these question can be found considering unstable universes as an ensemble of unstable quantum particles .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "2 one can find a quantum description of the decay process . in sec .",
    "3 a simplified toy model of the combined process of the expansion of a universe with unstable vacuum and of the quantum decay process of the unstable vacuum state is analyzed .",
    "sec . 4 contains analysis of the long time properties of the survival amplitude and connected with these properties a behavior of the decay rate as a function of time @xmath1 . in sec .",
    "5 a connection of properties of the energy of the metastable vacuum state as a function of time @xmath1 and the vacuum energy density is considered .",
    "6 contains a discussion and conclusions .",
    "from experiments it is known that for some unstable systems decay process is relatively fast or very fast while for others it is slow or very slow .",
    "the rate of this process is characterized by parameter called the `` lifetime '' or the `` decay rate '' . in decay experiments",
    "one has an ensemble of unstable physical systems in a certain area , which is surrounded by counters that detect decay products .",
    "the counting rate , i.e. the number of decay per second @xmath4 , is proportional to the number of unstable particles @xmath5 in a given volume at instant @xmath1 .",
    "the proportionality coefficient , @xmath6 is connected with the average lifetime ( or simply lifetime ) of the unstable objects considered . indeed , if @xmath5 is very large , then the ratio of @xmath5 by the initial number @xmath7 of such object at @xmath8 , @xmath9 , in this area is the probability , @xmath10 , of finding an unstable object in this area at a given instant of time @xmath1 undecayed ( i. e. of the survival probability @xmath10 ) : there is @xmath11 and @xmath12 so @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the number of decays @xmath15 per unit of time @xmath16 equals : @xmath17 and there is @xmath18 in the case of decay process considered .",
    "thus @xmath19 and the solution of eq . ( [ gamma-1 ] ) in the case",
    "@xmath20 takes the following form @xmath21 so , in this case @xmath22 $ ] and the density of the probability of decay at time @xmath1 during the time interval @xmath23 , @xmath24 , equals @xmath25 \\equiv \\lambda\\,{\\cal p}(t)$ ] .",
    "it is easy to verify that @xmath26 as it should be . using @xmath24",
    "one can find the average lifetime as @xmath27 thus , in general @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the decay rate .    within the quantum theory , similarly as in the classical physics case ,",
    "the number of particles @xmath5 , which at the time @xmath1 has been found as a living in the area considered , is equal to the product of the probability , @xmath10 , of finding an unstable object in this area at a given instant of time @xmath1 undecayed ( i. e. of the survival probability @xmath10 ) and the initial number @xmath7 of such objects : @xmath30 the survival probability @xmath10 ( or the decay law ) is defined as follows : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the survival amplitude and @xmath33 ( where @xmath34 is the hilbert space of states of the considered system ) is the unstable ( metastable ) state under considerations , @xmath35 is the solution of the schrdinger equation @xmath36 for the initial condition @xmath37 , @xmath38 is the total self ",
    "adjoint hamiltonian for the system under consideration .",
    "hence @xmath39\\,|m\\rangle$ ] .    from ( [ gamma-2 ] ) , ( [ p(t ) ] )",
    "we obtain that , @xmath40 if to define the following quantity @xcite : @xmath41 then the relation ( [ gamma-3 ] ) means that simply @xmath42 , \\label{gamma - h}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 $ ] denotes the imaginary parts of @xmath44 ( similarly , @xmath45 $ ] is the real part of @xmath44 ) .",
    "now let us focus an attention on the survival amplitude @xmath46 and on the survival probability @xmath10 given by ( [ a(t ) ] ) and ( [ p(t ) ] ) .",
    "@xmath10 is the probability to find the system at time @xmath1 in the metastable state @xmath47 prepared in the initial instant @xmath48 .",
    "if there was suitable large number @xmath7 of identical unstable objects at the initial instant @xmath49 then according to ( [ pn(0 ) ] ) one should detect @xmath50 of them at @xmath51 .",
    "there is no such a simple correspondence of @xmath10 with the results of measurements when one is able to prepare only one particle ( or a few particles ) at @xmath48 .",
    "when one is able to prepare at @xmath49 a system containing only one unstable objects and to make a large number @xmath7 of indistinguishable copies of this system at @xmath52 then the problem reduces to the previous one : @xmath53 copies of the system will contain this unstable object undecayed at @xmath54 . when there are no @xmath55 copies of the system at @xmath56 but one has to deal with only one particle system then one can never be sure whether one will detect this particle undecayed at @xmath57 or not .",
    "this same concerns a universe with the metastable ( false ) vacuum : one can expect that an ensemble of @xmath7 universes with unstable vacua will behave analogously as a system containing @xmath7 unstable objects .",
    "so , let @xmath58 be the metastable ( false ) vacuum state of a universe considered and @xmath59 , ( where @xmath60 is the true ground state describing the state in which the energy of the system under considerations has the absolute minimum ) .",
    "let this universe were created at the instant @xmath61 and volume occupied by this universe at @xmath62 were @xmath63 .",
    "thus in fact one should take into account that there is @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the vacuum state of the universe of volume @xmath66 .",
    "it is convenient to choose the normalization condition for @xmath65 in the following form , @xmath67 in this case an analysis of the survival probability @xmath10 can not give a conclusive answer whether the universe of volume @xmath66 will still exist in the state @xmath65 at instant @xmath57 or not .",
    "the problem becomes much more complicated if to take into account that in addition to the pure quantum tunneling process leading to decay of the false vacuum state @xcite , there is another completely different process forcing the universe of volume @xmath66 to expand .",
    "this effect was considered in @xcite , where krauss and dent analyzing a false vacuum decay pointed out that in eternal inflation , even though regions of false vacua by assumption should decay exponentially , gravitational effects force the space region volume @xmath66 that has not decayed yet to grow exponentially fast .",
    "this effect causes that many false vacuum regions or many universes forming a multiverse can survive up to the times much later than times when the exponential decay law holds .",
    "what is more , particle physics can provide us with hints suggesting what may happen in such or similar cases : a free neutron is unstable and decays but the neutron inside a nucleus is subjected exposed to other additional interactions and does not decay .",
    "these processes both can be described using the survival amplitude ( [ a(t ) ] ) , @xmath68 with suitable hamiltonians @xmath38 .",
    "there is @xmath69 in the case of the free neutron and there is @xmath70 for the neutron inside a nucleus . here",
    "@xmath71 describes weak interactions where as @xmath72 denotes strong and electromagnetic interactions . for the free neutron we have @xmath73 as @xmath74",
    "this property is not the case of the neutron inside the nucleus . in general , when an unstable particle is subjected to different interactions described by suitable commuting hamiltonians , then it may happen that the decay process can be slowed or even stopped .",
    "so when analyzing the stability of the false vacuum state by means of the survival amplitude @xmath46 the correct conclusion can not be drawn if to use only the hamiltonian @xmath38 describing the `` pure '' decay through quantum tunneling .",
    "one can expect that the correct result can be obtained if to replace this @xmath38 in ( [ a(t ) ] ) , ( [ a(t)-h ] ) by the summ @xmath75 , where @xmath76 describes more or less accurately the expansion process of the volume @xmath66 .",
    "astrophysical observations lead to the conclusions that our universe is expanding in time . in @xcite",
    "an observation was made that in inflationary processes , even some space regions of false ( unstable ) vacua decay exponentially , gravitational effects force space in a region that did not have time to decay to itself to grow exponentially fast ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "so in general the expansion process affect the process of decay of the universes ( domains ) with the false vacua .",
    "the problem is how to describe this expansion so that variations in time of the volume @xmath77 occupied by the universe had the form of schrdinger equation ( [ schrod ] ) or a similar form with a suitable effective hamiltonian @xmath76 .",
    "the volume @xmath77 is an increasing function of time @xmath1 in the present epoch , so its evolution is non  unitary and @xmath76 can not be hermitian .",
    "the non  unitary evolution operator solving the schrodinger  like equation with this @xmath76 and acting on the initial state @xmath65 should transform this state into the vector @xmath78^{1/2}\\,\\exp\\,[-\\,\\frac{i}{\\hbar}th]|0^{\\,false};v_{0}\\rangle$ ] , where @xmath79 is a complex or real number .",
    "the simplest @xmath76 , which seems to be sufficient for the simplified qualitative analysis of the problem , may be chosen as follows , @xmath80)\\,\\mathbb{i } \\label{hv } \\\\ & = & ( e_{v}\\ , + \\ , i\\,\\hbar\\,\\frac{3}{2}\\,h(t))\\,\\mathbb{i } , \\label{hv1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath81 is the scale factor , @xmath82 is the hubble parameter , @xmath83 ( in the general case @xmath84 ) , @xmath85 is the unit operator , @xmath76 is the non  hermitian effective hamiltonian , @xmath86 is a real parameter having dimension of the energy",
    ". we are looking for the solutions of the scrdinger equation with the hamiltonian @xmath87 and a matrix element of the form @xmath88 with @xmath89 .",
    "so we need solutions of the following equation @xmath90 with the initial condition @xmath91 . here",
    "@xmath38 is a hermitian operator ( hamiltonian ) responsible for the decay of the false vacuum state @xmath65 and @xmath92 = 0 $ ] .",
    "now , let @xmath93 be of the form @xmath94 and @xmath95 inserting ( [ psi ] ) into ( [ d - psi ] ) one obtains @xmath96 this means that our problem comes down to finding a solution of the following equation @xmath97)|m(t)\\rangle .",

    "it is possible only if @xmath104 where @xmath105 is a real or complex scalar function and @xmath106 .",

    "now inserting this solution into ( [ m(t)=f ] ) and then using ( [ psi ] ) we obtain the solution , @xmath93 , of eq .",

    "function @xmath114 describes the combined effect of the processes of a decay and an expansion of the initially created universes .",
    "there is @xmath115 but the normalization condition ( [ < |>=1 ] ) allows us to write volume @xmath77 as @xmath116 .",
    "so @xmath117 and @xmath118 where @xmath7 is the number of universes of volume @xmath66 created at the initial instant @xmath48 with the vacua described by @xmath65 and @xmath119 is volume occupied by all these universes at the instant @xmath120 and it corresponds with @xmath5 in ( [ pn(0 ) ] ) .",

    "one may expect that @xmath251 equals to the cosmological constant calculated within quantum field theory @xcite . from ( [ lambda1 ] ) it is seen that for @xmath219 , @xmath252 because @xmath253 . now if to assume that @xmath251 corresponds to the value of the cosmological constant @xmath254 calculated within the quantum field theory , than one should expect that @xcite @xmath255 ( see @xcite ) which allows one to write down eq .",
    "( [ lambda1 ] ) as follows @xmath256 note that for @xmath192 there should be ( see ( [ rho ] ) ) @xmath257 that is @xmath258 where @xmath259 and the sign of @xmath260 is determined by the sign of @xmath261 .",
    "the problem how the process of expansion of an universe and its decay process affect together on this universe is analyzed in sec .",
    "the possible result of these combined processes is characterized by the condition ( [ main ] ) . the obvious next step of considerations performed in sec . 3 and sec .",
    "4 is to apply results obtained therein to analyze the possible future behavior of the universe with unstable vacuum . in the case of very late times",
    "it can be done inserting into ( [ main ] ) , eg . the present value of the hubble expansion rate @xmath262 and the late time asymptotic form of the decay rate @xmath162 given by relations ( [ g(t ) ] ) and ( [ c - i ] ) , @xmath263 where the the coefficient @xmath264 in ( [ g(t ) ] ) is neglected , and assuming that @xmath265 , ( where @xmath266 is the age of the our universe ) .",
    "the only problem is to choose the appropriate value of @xmath267 in ( [ c - i ] ) . if to choose @xmath267 appearing in the case of the decays into two particles , that is , @xmath268 ( see , eg .",
    "@xcite ) , then inserting into ( [ main ] ) the present values of @xmath269 and @xmath266 @xcite one obtains that @xmath270 this result suggests that in such a case the universe can decay at suitable late times , but such a conclusion can not be considered to be decisive and final .",
    "first , taking into account the neglected term @xmath271 in ( [ g(t)-1 ] ) can result in changing the sing of @xmath272 .",
    "the second , there is no certainty that the choice @xmath268 is the correct choice .",
    "in fact , it is not known what value of @xmath267 is correct for decays of the unstable vacuum states and this problem requires further studies .",
    "it appears that for suitable values of @xmath267 the parameter @xmath272 is nonnegative .",
    "the solution of the equation @xmath273 which follows from ( [ main ] ) and ( [ g(t)-1 ] ) is @xmath274 this solution is obtained for the same values of @xmath275 and @xmath265 which were used to find the result ( [ d - hg-1 ] ) .",
    "the result ( [ lambda - s ] ) means that there should be @xmath276 and @xmath277 within the considered late time approximation ( [ g(t)-1 ] ) for @xmath278 .",
    "so if the energy distribution @xmath196 for the universe in the metastable vacuum state is given by the relation ( [ omega - eta ] ) with such @xmath267 that @xmath279 then , rather such a universe should not decay .",
    "this conclusion show how important is to find @xmath196 and thus @xmath267 for the metastable vacuum state of the universe . to complete this discussion",
    "let us note that the breit  wigner energy distribution function ( [ omega - bw ] ) corresponds to the case @xmath280 .",
    "the another reason to study properties of the metastable vacuum state and thus @xmath196 for such states is that the knowledge of the correct @xmath196 is necessary when one wants to find proper values and signs of the coefficients @xmath201 appearing in relations ( [ e(t ) ] ) and ( [ e_m - as ] ) and then @xmath261 in ( [ rho ] ) .",
    "parametrization following from quantum theoretical treatment of metastable vacuum states can explain why the cosmologies with the time ",
    "dependent cosmological constant @xmath246 are worth considering and may help to explain the cosmological constant problem @xcite .",
    "the time dependence of @xmath254 of the type @xmath281 was assumed eg . in @xcite but there was no any explanation what physics suggests such a choice of the form of @xmath254 .",
    "earlier analogous form of @xmath254 was obtained in @xcite , where the invariance under scale transformations of the generalized einstein equations was studied .",
    "such a time dependence of @xmath254 was postulated also in @xcite as the result of the analysis of the large numbers hypothesis .",
    "the cosmological model with time dependent @xmath254 of the above postulated form was studied also in @xcite and in much more recent papers .",
    "the nice feature and maybe even the advantage of the formalism presented in sections 4 and 5 is that in the case of the universe with metastable ( false ) vacuum if one realized that the decay of this unstable vacuum state is the quantum decay process then it emerges automatically that there have to exist the true ground state of the system that is the true ( or bare ) vacuum with the minimal energy , @xmath282 , of the system corresponding to this vacuum and equivalently , @xmath238 , or @xmath283 .",
    "what is more , in this case such @xmath284 emerges that at suitable late times it has the form described by relations ( [ lambda3 ] )  ( [ lambda5 ] ) .",
    "in such a case the function @xmath285 given by the relation ( [ kappa ] ) describes time dependence for all times @xmath1 of the energy density @xmath286 or the cosmological `` constant '' @xmath287 and it general form is presented in panels @xmath214 in figs ( [ f1 ] ) and ( [ f2 ] ) .",
    "note that results presented in sections 4 and 5 are rigorous .",
    "the formalism mentioned was applied in @xcite , where cosmological models with @xmath288 were studied : the most promising result is reported in @xcite where using the parametrization following from the mentioned quantum theoretical analysis of the decay process of the unstable vacuum state an attempt was made to explain the small today s value of the cosmological constant @xmath254 .",
    "this shows that formalism and the approach described in this paper and in @xcite is promising and can help to solve the cosmological constant and other cosmological problems and it needs further studies , especially it to take into account the lhc result concerning the mass of the higgs boson @xcite and cosmological consequences of this result",
