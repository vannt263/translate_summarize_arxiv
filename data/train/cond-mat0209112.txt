    "a graph g consists of @xmath0 vertices @xmath2 connected by edges @xmath3 .",
    "it is described by a connectivity matrix @xmath4 with : @xmath5 @xmath6 vertex relabelling @xmath7 leaves g invariant but changes c according to @xmath8 with @xmath9 an orthogonal matrix with only one non - zero element in each row @xmath10 and column @xmath11 , which represents the above permutation @xmath12 the graph equivalence problem is the following : `` given @xmath4 and @xmath13 , how can we decide , in time which is polynomial in @xmath0 , if both correspond to the same topological graph @xmath14 or to different graphs ? , or stated differently , does a permutation matrix @xmath9 for which eq.([eq : c ] ) holds exist , and what is this @xmath9 matrix ? ''",
    "exhaustive testing of all @xmath15 permutation is impractical even for moderate @xmath0 .",
    "a more systematic search of @xmath9 performs just those transpositions which enhance an `` overlap '' function say @xmath16 however the changes in @xmath4 ( and in @xmath17 ) due to any permutation is finite .",
    "there is no algorithm for systematically enhancing @xmath17 , as subsequent transpositions may undo the improvement due to previous permutations .",
    "our basic suggestion is : instead of using discrete , large changes of say just two elements in a transposition @xmath18 , we modify , in each step , all elements by small amounts .",
    "such `` continuous '' changes seem impossible : in the strict formal approach there are no `` continuous permutations '' .",
    "we use a symmetric @xmath0 simplex ( in @xmath1 dimensions ) to represent our graph .",
    "the `` abstract '' vertices @xmath19 of @xmath14 ( or @xmath4 ) are mapped into the geometrical vertices @xmath20 of the simplex .",
    "the symmetric configuration with all @xmath21 , equal , is the starting point of our algorithms .    the motion generated by the dynamics ,",
    "was designed to distort the simplex by shifting its vertices from the symmetric initial positions .",
    "the distorted simplex then reveals characteristic features of the graph @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the original aim of the distortion algorithm was to find groups of vertices in @xmath14 with higher than average mutual connectivity , and asses the distances between the various clusters in the graph .    to this end",
    "attractive ( repulsive ) interactions were introduced between fictious point objects at @xmath22 and @xmath23 when the corresponding vertices @xmath2 and @xmath24 are connected ( or disconnected ) in @xmath14 .",
    "we use first order `` aristotelian '' dynamics : @xmath25 with forces @xmath26 which derive from potentials : @xmath27 \\},\\ ] ] @xmath28 @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) are attractive ( repulsive ) pair - wise potentials .    by a proper tuning of the latter- which can even be modified as a function of `` time ''",
    "- we can physically cluster at separate locations groups of points representing strongly ( internally ) connected clusters in the graph @xmath14 .    to avoid collapse towards the origin ( or a `` run - away '' to infinity )",
    "if @xmath31 ( or @xmath32 ) dominates , we force @xmath33 to stay , at all times , on the unit sphere : @xmath34 the graph characterization ( g.c . ) and graph equivalence ( g.e.p . )",
    "problems are very closely connected . if we could find ( in polynomial number of steps ! ) a set of real numbers @xmath35 that would completely characterize a graph @xmath14 then the g.e.p is readily solved .",
    "all we need to do is to compute for @xmath4 ( @xmath13 ) these numbers @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) , order the @xmath38 and @xmath39 sets separately and compare them .",
    "the set of eigenvalues @xmath40 of the connectivity matrix are certainly invariant under relabelling .",
    "while this set encodes a rich body of information of graph theoretic interest , it fails to completely characterize graphs@xcite .",
    "an alternative and natural simple variable helping characterize connectivity matrices is the mutual entropy ( see , for example @xcite ) .",
    "suppose the connectivity matrix @xmath4 has been normalized so that @xmath41 @xmath42 could then be considered as the probability that @xmath2 and @xmath24 are connected .",
    "the corresponding entropy @xmath43 could be considered as a measure of the uncertainty of the rows connection for the given network .",
    "the amount of uncertainty for the connection of the column nodes given that the row nodes are connected is @xmath44 as a result the amount of _ mutual information _ gained via the given connectivity of the network is @xmath45 where @xmath46 due to the double summation and the symmetry of the connectivity matrix @xmath47 does not depend on the vertex relabelling and is a permutation invariant measure for the connectivity matrix .",
    "calculations of the mutual entropy for two connectivity matrices provides an easy way to distinguish between these corresponding different graphs . if , however , the entropies are the same , the more detailed approach below is used .",
    "amusingly we found that the entropy is already sufficient to distinguish between the lowest cospectral graphs ( see , for example @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the distances between the various vertices @xmath48 vary in our original algorithm as a function of time away from the original common value : @xmath49 also in identical simulations of the dynamical evolution , the sets of relative distances computed for @xmath4 and @xmath13 , should be the same if @xmath4 and @xmath13 are equivalent : + @xmath50 _ one _ permutation of @xmath0 elements ( namely that which brings via eqs.([eq : c ] ) and ( [ eq : p ] ) @xmath4 into @xmath13 ) should yield : @xmath51 ) and then using ( [ eq : dist ] ) recover the permutation @xmath7 .    in essence",
    "the idea of the present algorithm is to use the distortion of the simplex @xmath52 \\{i.e .",
    "@xmath53 } generated via the dynamics of ( repulsion ) attraction between ( dis)connected vertices in @xmath14 to bring out an `` intrinsic shape '' of the graph .",
    "initially all vertices were at equal distances@xcite .",
    "all the information pertaining to the graph was encoded in the interactions of eq.([eq : pot ] ) .    after enough evolution steps ,",
    "each vertex moves appreciably away , namely by + @xmath54 from its initial position .",
    "the information on the specific graph @xmath14 reflects in the geometrical shape of @xmath55 , i.e. the set of distances , latexmath:[\\[\\label{eq : setd }    vertices which are near in a graph theoretic sense , namely for which there are many , short , connecting paths in the graph move closer together .",
    "( a short path consists of a small # of consecutive edges which starts at @xmath2 say and terminates at @xmath24 ) . like wise vertices which are far in a graph theoretic sense",
    "i.e. have fewer and longer connecting paths will tend to move further away .",
    "in our earlier work@xcite we sought to identify `` clusters in the graphs '' namely have the points corresponding to a subset @xmath57 of vertices in the graph which have relatively strong mutual , internal , connectivity , collapse to a single point .",
    "for the present purpose we need ( and should ! ) not pursue the evolution that far , as by then the graph simplifies and some of the inter - cluster details are lost .",
    "rather we need to stop `` half - way '' : after eq.([eq : setd ] ) holds and yet no cluster has completely collapsed .",
    "note that in @xmath1 dimensions all the @xmath58 distances @xmath59 are independent , apart from triangular inequalities of the form @xmath60 jointly these distances specify the geometric shape of @xmath55 .",
    "the mapping of the @xmath58 bits of information : @xmath61 , via our dynamic evolution , into the set of @xmath58 distances , is highly non - linear .",
    "the fact that we have @xmath58 distances ( rather than just @xmath0 eigenvalues ) makes the former more likely to specify the graphs .",
    "further we note that the time @xmath62 when the comparisons are made and the attractive and repulsive interactions in eq.([eq : pot ] ) above are free parameters and functions .",
    "hence we can repeat the above graph comparisons for many values and/or many functions @xmath63 , @xmath64 , making the significance of a successful match extremely high .    if many of the @xmath65 @xmath66and @xmath67 are degenerate our ability to resolve graphs will be diminished .",
    "however such degeneracies must stem from some symmetries in the graphs and corresponding connectivity matrices .",
    "once these symmetries are identified , the number of independent @xmath68 ( or @xmath69 ) and the task of comparing them will be accordingly reduced .",
    "we apply the above approach below , demonstrating its power and versatility .",
    "we follow the dynamics of the vertex shifts in eq.([eq : for ] ) by discretizing the first order equations : @xmath70 with @xmath71 a small time increment .    since @xmath22 , @xmath26 , are @xmath1 dimensional vectors eq.([eq : discr ] ) represents o(@xmath72 ) equations for the relevant components .",
    "each force component @xmath73 is a sum of @xmath74 force components with @xmath74 the valency of the vertex @xmath2 i.e. the # of vertices connected to it .",
    "hence each step in ( 26 ) involves @xmath75 calculations with @xmath76 the average valency in the graph .",
    "let us assume that we need to repeat the process of iterating the dynamics namely ( 26 ) or ( 27 ) for @xmath77 steps in order to achieve the goal(s ) of the algorithm(s ) .",
    "these goals vary for the various problems of interest . for cluster identification",
    "we need the points representing clusters in the graph to physically converge into definable separate regions .    for graph characterizations and comparison",
    "we need a fewer number of steps , sufficient to make the distances @xmath78 vary considerably away from their original common value .",
    "the total number of computations involved is @xmath79 if @xmath80 is finite and @xmath0 independent or @xmath81 for the extreme case when @xmath82 . for @xmath83 not to be polynomial in @xmath0 we need that @xmath77 will grow faster than any power of @xmath0",
    ".    in principal one can envision many types of chaotic dynamical evolution where such large number of steps is indeed required .",
    "this is not the case for the first order equations considered here : + @xmath84 where the system consistently moves , along the steepest descent , to a minimum of @xmath85 , the potential energy .",
    "if we have a complicated `` energy landscape '' the system can be trapped in any one of the many local minima , a feature which accounts for the difficulty of protein folding@xcite , neural nets and spin glass problems@xcite . the need to keep the same deterministic evolution for @xmath55 and @xmath86 representing @xmath14 and @xmath87 in the first `` distortion '' algorithm ,",
    "excludes in our case- the possibility of introducing some stochastic noise to extricate the system from a local minimum .",
    "fortunately our problem does not allow for many minima .",
    "thus let us fix the locations of all @xmath22  @xmath88 except @xmath89 .",
    "the velocity @xmath90 , is dictated by @xmath91 assume we have some local equilibrium at @xmath92 .",
    "locally , in the neighborhood of @xmath92 , we can use the variables @xmath93  @xmath94 , instead of @xmath95 the @xmath1 cartesian coordinates of @xmath96 .",
    "the conditions for an extremum @xmath97 then require that + @xmath98 thus for generic",
    "monotonic @xmath99 , @xmath100 , we have no extrema inside the region .",
    "+ an absolute minimum obtained at the boundary .",
    "to demonstrate the power of our approach we considered a graph with 100 vertices each of which is randomly connected to seven others .",
    "the corresponding connectivity matrix @xmath4 is shown in fig.([fig : c7 ] ) ) .",
    "next we applied our algorithm using a combination of attractive and repulsive forces in @xmath102 dimensional space .",
    "the vertices of the 100-simplex were allowed to move under the influence of the forces on the 98-dimensional hyper - sphere in 99-dimensions . after a number of steps we analyzed the distances between pairs the vertices of the two simplexes .",
    "we found perfect correspondence between the distance matrices .",
    "we also readily show the permutation matrix which maps one distance matrix on to the another .",
    "applying the latter to the matrix @xmath101 reproduces exactly the original connectivity matrix @xmath4 ( fig.([fig : c7 ] ) ) .",
