    "a precise understanding of the nonperturbative structure of the nucleon remains an elusive goal half a century since the advent of the quark model @xcite . following the revelation of the `` proton spin crisis '' by the european muon collaboration @xcite ,",
    "the desire to map the internal landscape of the nucleon has driven many experimental efforts to discover the origin of its flavor and spin content .    in this respect , parity - violating ( pv )",
    "lepton - nucleon experiments have shed considerable light by merit of their sensitivity to the flavor structure of various quark currents within the struck nucleon , with elastic and deeply inelastic scattering ( dis ) measurements providing complementary information . for the former ,",
    "reactions of the type @xmath5 are capable of discriminating the quark - level contributions to the charge , magnetization , and axial structure of the nucleon , whereas the dis mechanism @xmath6 enables the extraction of the probabilistic quark or parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) .",
    "the properties of qcd suggest that matrix elements of the nucleon involving strange quarks should in general be non - zero , and as such must be associated with some nonperturbative `` strangeness '' content of the nucleon which would have observable consequences for elastic form factors @xcite .",
    "this recognition spurred multiple efforts ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review ) to detect the signatures for nucleon strangeness in pv elastic measurements at sample @xcite , happex i ",

    "a number of theoretical studies ,  @xcite , have proceeded in tandem with these experimental developments , including several global analyses of the elastic data @xcite .",
    "it is also true that continued improvements in the technology of qcd global analyses of high energy data have inspired efforts to constrain the implications of nucleon strangeness for dis pdfs such as the strange - antistrange momentum asymmetry @xcite @xmath7\\ , \\label{eq : s-_def}\\ ] ] in which @xmath8 and @xmath9 are pdfs for strange and antistrange quarks , respectively , carrying a fraction @xmath10 of the nucleon s momentum .",
    "nonperturbative contributions to the strange pdfs have also been considered by various theoretical models @xcite , which are comparatively well - constrained by global analyses .",
    "part of the interest in higher energy qcd processes extends to recent lhc measurements of neutral- and charged - current mechanisms @xcite that are potentially sensitive to the quark density of the nucleon , though these are typically restricted to small @xmath10 . at more intermediate kinematics , recent efforts to extract the strange pdfs from the semi - inclusive production of @xmath11 @xcite have also been made , though such undertakings present the added difficulty of model dependence associated with the required nonperturbative fragmentation functions .",
    "current data sensitive to nucleon strangeness therefore come from both elastic scattering and dis , and both channels must shed light on the presumed nonperturbative dynamics that underlie the generation of strangeness at the momentum scale of the nucleon .",
    "this being the case , the physics related to each process should constrain or serve as input to models that attempt a consistent description of the nucleon s strange content .",
    "fundamentally , quantization on the light - front has the favorable property that eigenstates of front - form hamiltonians correspond to the physical states of the hadronic spectrum  a fact which permits the formulation of universal , poincar - invariant wave functions whose dynamics are determined by interactions . in our case , we may leverage this feature in order to specify wave functions that provide the momentum - dependent coupling of the proton to higher fock states involving @xmath0 .",
    "with such a wave function in hand , one is then specially positioned to compute strange quark effects in both elastic and dis observables using a common framework , as we show below .",
    "moreover , as the light - cone wave functions we develop are specifically adapted to the strange sector , the results we obtain are consistent by construction with parity - conserving data which concern the results of similar models in the light sector .",
    "while there have been few attempts to unite the physics of elastic and dis strangeness , one prominent exception can be found in the analyses of refs .",
    "@xcite . these made use of generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) to construct a relation between the strangeness pdfs and form factors , but required additional input from lattice qcd and vector meson dominance assumptions . with the goal of using an approach with as few model assumptions as possible , we proceed using the fock expansion of the nucleon into states explicitly involving strange and antistrange quarks via light - front wave functions ( lfwfs ) as described above .",

    "[ sec : formalism ] we present the basic details of our light - front model and use it to find expressions for the strangeness contributions to the vector form factors of the nucleon . in sec .",

    "[ sec : gegm][sec : dens ] , we consider the implications of these dis constraints for elastic observables , the proton s strange spin content @xmath3 , and scalar density @xmath12 , respectively , and conclude in sec .  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "to evaluate the strangeness contributions to the nucleon sachs form factors , we base our formalism upon a two - body fock state expansion of the nucleon wave function .",
    "the light - front technology we employ in the following calculations has already seen extensive use in previous computations related to composite structure in few - body systems . in hadrons ,",
    "lfwfs provide a successful description for both the pionic @xcite and quark @xcite content as well as their contributions to electromagnetic and long - range structure . somewhat further afield from our present purposes ,",
    "the generality of the lfwf framework has also facilitated progress in disentangling the extended structure of the interacting electron @xcite and of nuclear bound states @xcite .",
    "recently , in ref .",
    "@xcite a two - body quark - diquark decomposition of the nucleon wave function was used to find the pion cloud - dressed valence quark contributions to the vector form factors measured in parity - conserving elastic scattering experiments .",
    "the resulting ansatz was capable of computing the bare quark components of the proton form factors as well as modifications due to the coupling of the nucleon to a cloud of virtual pions .",
    "once constrained by empirical data for @xmath13 , the model was also able to independently predict the quark spin content of the nucleon ( a quantity typically accessed via inclusive polarized dis ) , obtaining @xmath14 in the bare nucleon  of roughly similar scale as the results of dis global fits .",
    "once pion cloud effects were included , this became @xmath15 , which agreed closely with nlo analyses of helicity - dependent pdfs .",
    "our present computation of nucleon strangeness thus closely mirrors the bare quark calculation of @xcite , and we note that the strange quark contributions we obtain represent independent components of the proton s light cone wave function , and are in addition to the successful light - sector description just outlined above . in full generality , the @xmath16-particle light - front wave function for an initial - state proton of mass @xmath17 and @xmath18-momentum @xmath19 @xcite can be expanded as @xmath20 we compute the two - body mechanism physically associated with the process whereby the proton fluctuates into a state consisting of ,  a virtual strange quark and a tetraquark spectator ( made up of the usual @xmath21 $ ] valence content of the proton and virtual @xmath22 , though for generality we leave the formalism independent of the struck quark flavor at this stage ) .",

    "note that in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : fock ] ) and ( [ eq : fock-2 ] ) @xmath27 refer to the helicity of the initial proton and struck quark , respectively , and as usual the light - front momentum fraction is @xmath28 of the intermediate quark ( @xmath29 ) with respect to the parent nucleon ( @xmath30 ) . in particular , the object @xmath31 represents the lfwf describing the amplitude for the proton to dissociate into an intermediate state involving a spin-@xmath32 strange or antistrange quark and scalar tetraquark spectator . the requirements of the pauli principle are maintained through our use of the fock expansion of eq .",

    "we have formulated wave functions of sufficient generality as to enable the computation of both dis distribution functions as well as elastic scattering matrix elements , and we can therefore compute the strange sachs form factors of the nucleon @xmath73 in a fashion that incorporates constraints from qcd global analyses of the strange pdf combinations @xmath90 given by eqs .",

    "these parameter values are notably smaller than the results of global analyses based directly upon the available elastic data @xcite , with the suggestion being that if ground - state lfwfs are to be taken seriously , the current precision in elastic data is not yet adequate to be unambiguously sensitive to nucleon strangeness .",
    "it is interesting that the ranges we determine for @xmath74 and @xmath75 closely align with the findings of refs .",

    "this reality is something of a double - edged sword , and the potential smallness of the nucleon strangeness suggested by our results could possibly simplify extractions of @xmath167 ; thus , one might conclude bsm physics searches based upon parity - violating electron scattering are relatively free of the potential `` contamination '' that might originate in backgrounds associated with the nucleon s strange content .    in the end , the formalism presented here is meant to represent a simple approximation to the ground - state structure of the nucleon , and one might conceive of embellishments that perhaps capture the relevant dynamics more ably , including more elaborate wave functions with additional spin structures  though these could possibly require additional input parameters .",
    "all the same , we do not expect such additions to fundamentally alter the conclusions reached here for the simple reason that it is difficult to generate large effects in elastic cross sections relative to dis by incorporating such new terms into the wave function . for example , by orthogonality , wave functions associated with an axial - vector spectator can not interfere constructively in _ coherent _ elastic form factors with the scalar tetraquark wave functions used in the present analysis ; as such , the decisive role played by dis constraints ( which represent _ incoherent _ physics ) should remain unaltered in the face of such modifications .",
