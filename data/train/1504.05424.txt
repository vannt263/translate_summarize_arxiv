    "lipid membranes consist of a bilayer of molecules , which have a hydrophilic head and two hydrophobic chains .",
    "these bilayers typically spontaneously form closed bag - like structures , which are called vesicles .",
    "it is observed that vesicles can attain a huge variety of shapes and some of them are similar to the biconcave shape of red blood cells .",
    "since membranes play a fundamental role in many living systems , the study of vesicles is a very active research field in different scientific disciplines , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "it is the goal of this paper to present a numerical approach to study the evolution of lipid membranes .",
    "we present several computations showing quite different shapes , and the influence of fluid flow on the membrane evolution .",
    "since the classical papers of @xcite and @xcite , there has been a lot of work with the aim of describing equilibrium membrane shapes with the help of elastic membrane energies . @xcite and @xcite introduced a bending energy for a non - flat membrane , which is formulated with the help of the curvature of the membrane . in the class of fixed topologies the relevant energy density , in the simplest situation , is proportional to the square of the mean curvature @xmath0 .",
    "the resulting energy functional is called the willmore energy . when computing equilibrium membrane shapes one has to take constraints into account .",
    "lipid membranes have a very small compressibility , and hence can safely be modelled as locally incompressible .",
    "in addition , the presence of certain molecules in the surrounding fluid , for which the membrane is impermeable , leads to an osmotic pressure , which results in a constraint for the volume enclosed by the membrane .",
    "the minimal energetic model for lipid membranes consists of the willmore mean curvature functional together with enclosed volume and surface area constraints .",
    "already this simple model leads to quite different shapes including the biconcave red blood cell shapes , see @xcite .",
    "@xcite introduced a variant of the willmore energy , with the aim of modelling a possible asymmetry of the bilayer membrane .",
    "@xcite studied the functional @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is a fixed constant , the so - called spontaneous curvature .",
    "it is argued that the origin of the spontaneous curvature is e.g.  a different chemical environment on both sides of the membrane .",
    "we refer to @xcite and @xcite for a recent discussion , and for experiments in situations which lead to spontaneous curvature effects due to the chemical structure of the bilayer .",
    "typically there is yet another asymmetry in the bilayer leading to a signature in the membrane architecture .",
    "this results from the fact that the two membrane layers have a different number of molecules .",
    "since the exchange of molecules between the layers is difficult , an imbalance is conserved during a possible shape change .",
    "the total area difference between the two layers is proportional to @xmath3 .",
    "several models have been proposed , which describe the difference in the total number of molecules in the two layers with the help of the integrated mean curvature .",
    "the bilayer coupling model , introduced by svetina and coworkers @xcite , assumes that the area per lipid molecule is fixed and assumes that there is no exchange of molecules between the two layers .",
    "hence the total areas of the two layers are fixed , and on assuming that the two layers are separated by a fixed distance , one obtains , to the order of this distance , that the area difference can be approximated by the integrated mean curvature , see @xcite .",
    "we note that a spontaneous curvature contribution is irrelevant in the bilayer coupling model as this would only add a constant to the energy as the area and integrated mean curvature are fixed .",
    "@xcite noted that in the bilayer coupling model budding always occurs continuously which is inconsistent with experiments .",
    "they hence studied a model in which the area of the two layers are not fixed but can expand or compress under stress .",
    "given a relaxed initial area difference @xmath4 , the total area difference @xmath5 , which is proportional to the integrated mean curvature , can deviate from @xmath4 .",
    "however , the total energy now has a contribution that is proportional to @xmath6 .",
    "this term describes the elastic area difference stretching energy , see @xcite , and hence one has to pay a price energetically to deviate from the relaxed area difference .    it is also possible to combine the area difference elasticity model ( ade - model ) with a spontaneous curvature assumption , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , the resulting energetical model is equivalent to an area difference elasticity model with a modified @xmath4 , see @xcite for a more detailed discussion .",
    "it has been shown that the bilayer coupling model ( bc - model ) and the area difference elasticity model ( ade - model ) lead to a multitude of shapes , which also have been observed in experiments with vesicles . beside others , the familiar discocyte shapes ( including the `` shape '' of a red blood cell ) , stomatocyte shapes , prolate shapes and pear - like shapes have been observed .",
    "in addition , the budding of membranes can be described , as well as more exotic shapes , like starfish vesicles . moreover , higher genus shapes appear as global or local minima of the energies discussed above .",
    "we refer to @xcite for more details on the possible shapes appearing , when minimizing the energies in the ade- and bc - models .",
    "configurational changes of vesicles and membranes can not be described by energetical considerations alone , but have to be modelled with the help of appropriate evolution laws .",
    "several authors considered an @xmath7gradient flow dynamics of the curvature energies discussed above .",
    "pure willmore flow has been studied in @xcite , where the last two papers use a phase field formulation of the willmore problem .",
    "some authors also took other aspects , such as constraints on volume and area @xcite , as well as a constraint on the integrated mean curvature @xcite , into account .",
    "the effect of different lipid components in an @xmath7gradient flow approach of the curvature energy has been studied in @xcite .",
    "the above mentioned works considered a global constraint on the surface area .",
    "the membrane , however , is locally incompressible and hence a local constraint on the evolution of the membrane molecules should be taken into account .",
    "several authors included the local inextensibility constraint by introducing an inhomogeneous lagrange multiplier for this constraint on the membrane .",
    "this approach has been used within the context of different modelling and computational strategies such as the level set approach @xcite , the phase field approach @xcite , the immersed boundary method @xcite , the interfacial spectral boundary element method @xcite and the boundary integral method @xcite .    the physically most natural way to consider the local incompressibility constraint makes use of the fact that the membrane itself can be considered as an incompressible surface fluid .",
    "this implies that a surface navier  stokes system has to be solved on the membrane .",
    "the resulting set of equations has to take forces stemming from the surrounding fluid and from the membrane elasticity into account . in total ,",
    "bulk navier ",
    "stokes equations coupled to surface navier  stokes equations have to be solved .",
    "as the involved reynolds numbers for vesicles are typically small one can often replace the full navier  stokes equations by the stokes systems on the surface and in the bulk .",
    "the incompressibility condition in the bulk ( navier)stokes equations naturally leads to conservation of the volume enclosed by the membrane and the incompressibility condition on the surface leads a conservation of the membrane s surface area . a model involving coupled bulk - surface",
    "( navier)stokes equations has been proposed by @xcite , and it is this model that we want to study numerically in this paper .    introducing forces resulting from membrane energies in fluid flow models",
    "has been studied numerically before by different authors , @xcite .",
    "however , typically these authors studied simplified models , and either volume or surface constraints were enforced by lagrange multipliers . in addition , either just the bulk or just the surface ( navier)stokes equations have been solved .",
    "the only work considering simultaneously bulk and surface navier  stokes equations are @xcite and @xcite , where the former work is restricted to axisymmetric situations . in the present paper we are going to make use of the numerical method introduced in @xcite ,",
    "see also @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section we precisely state the mathematical model , consisting of the curvature elasticity model together with a coupled bulk - surface ( navier)stokes system . in section  [ sec3 ] we introduce our numerical method which consists of an unfitted parametric finite element method for the membrane evolution .",
    "the curvature forcing is discretized and coupled to the navier  stokes system in a stable way using the finite element method for the fluid unknowns . numerical computations in section  [ sec4 ]",
    "demonstrate that we can deal with a variety of different membrane shapes and flow scenarios .",
    "in particular , we will study what influence the membrane viscosity , the area difference elasticity ( ade ) and the spontaneous curvature have on the evolution of bilayer membranes in shear flow .",
    "we finish with some conclusions .",
    "we consider a continuum model for the evolution of biomembranes and vesicles , which consists of a curvature elasticity model for the membrane and the navier ",
    "stokes equations in the bulk and on the surface .",
    "the model is based on a paper by @xcite , where in addition we also allow the curvature energy model to be an area difference elasticity model .",
    "we first introduce the curvature elasticity model and then describe the coupling to the surface and bulk navier  stokes equations .",
    "the thickness of the lipid bilayer in a vesicle is typically three to four orders of magnitude smaller than the typical size of the vesicle .",
    "hence the membrane can be modelled as a two dimensional surface @xmath8 in @xmath9 .",
    "given the principal curvatures @xmath10 and @xmath11 of @xmath8 , one can define the mean curvature @xmath12 and the gau curvature @xmath13 ( as often in differential geometry we choose to take the sum of the principal curvatures as the mean curvature , instead of its mean value ) .",
    "the classical works of @xcite and @xcite derive a local bending energy , with the help of an expansion in the curvature , and they obtain @xmath14 as the total energy of a symmetric membrane .",
    "the parameters @xmath15 have the dimension of energy and are called the bending rigidity @xmath16 and the gaussian bending rigidity @xmath17 . if we consider closed membranes with a fixed topology , the term @xmath18 is constant and hence we will neglect the gaussian curvature term in what follows .    as discussed above ,",
    "the total area difference @xmath5 of the two lipid layers is , to first order , proportional to @xmath19 taking now into account that there is an optimal area difference @xmath4 , the authors in @xcite added a term proportional to @xmath20 to the curvature energy , where @xmath21 is a fixed constant which is proportional to the optimal area difference .    for non - symmetric membranes a certain mean curvature @xmath2 can be energetically favourable .",
    "then the elasticity energy ( [ elas1 ] ) is modified to @xmath22 the constant @xmath2 is called spontaneous curvature . taking into account that @xmath23 does not change for an evolution within a fixed topology class , the most general bending energy that we use in this paper",
    "is given by @xmath24 with the dimensionless energy @xmath25 where @xmath26 has the dimension @xmath27 .",
    "we now consider a continuum model for the fluid flow on the membrane and in the bulk , inside and outside of the membrane .",
    "we assume that the closed , time dependent membrane @xmath28 lies inside a spatial domain @xmath29 .",
    "for all times the membrane separates @xmath30 into an inner domain @xmath31 and an outer domain @xmath32 . denoting by @xmath33 the fluid velocity and by @xmath34 the pressure , the bulk stress tensor is given by @xmath35 , with @xmath36 being the bulk rate - of - strain tensor .",
    "we assume that the navier  stokes system @xmath37 holds in @xmath31 and @xmath32 . here",
    "@xmath38 and @xmath39 are the density and dynamic viscosity of the fluid , which can take different ( constant ) values @xmath40 , @xmath41 in @xmath42 .",
    "@xcite used the theory of interfacial fluid dynamics , which goes back to @xcite , to introduce a relaxation dynamics for fluidic membranes . in this model the fluid velocity is assumed to be continuous across the membrane , the membrane is moved in the normal direction with the normal velocity of the bulk fluid and , in addition , the surface navier  stokes equations @xmath43^+_-\\,\\vec\\nu + \\alpha\\,\\vec{f}_\\gamma\\,,\\quad { \\nabla_{\\!s}}\\,.\\,\\vec{u } = 0\\ ] ] have to hold on @xmath44 . here",
    "@xmath45 is the surface material density , @xmath46 is the material derivative and @xmath47 are the gradient and divergence operators on the surface .",
    "the surface stress tensor is given by @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the surface pressure , @xmath50 is the surface shear viscosity , @xmath51 is the projection onto the tangent space and @xmath52 is the surface rate - of - strain tensor .",

    "these forces are given by the first variation of the bending energy @xmath56 , see @xcite .",
    "it turns out that @xmath57 points in the normal direction , i.e.  @xmath58 , and we obtain , see @xcite , @xmath59 here @xmath60 is the surface laplace operator , @xmath61 is the weingarten map and @xmath62 . assuming e.g.  no - slip boundary conditions on @xmath63 , the boundary of @xmath30 , we obtain that the total energy can only decrease , i.e.@xmath64    we now non - dimensionalize the problem .",
    "we choose a time scale @xmath65 , a length scale @xmath66 and the resulting velocity scale @xmath67 .",

    "we remark that the reynolds numbers for the two regions in the bulk are given by @xmath82 and @xmath83 , respectively , and that they will in general differ in the case of a viscosity contrast between the inner and outer fluid .",
    "in addition to the above equations , we of course also require that @xmath84 has zero divergence in the bulk and that the surface divergence of @xmath84 vanishes on @xmath8 .",
    "typical values for the bulk dynamic viscosity @xmath39 are around @xmath85 , see @xcite , whereas the surface shear viscosity typically is about @xmath86 , see @xcite .",
    "the bending modulus @xmath16 is typically @xmath87 , see @xcite .",
    "the term @xmath88 in ( [ surfnd ] ) suggests to choose the length scale @xmath89 as @xmath90 appears in ( [ surfnd ] ) , we choose the time scale @xmath91 choosing @xmath92 see e.g.  @xcite , we obtain the length scale @xmath93 and the time scale @xmath94 , which are typical scales in experiments . with these scales for length and time together with values of @xmath95 for the bulk density and @xmath96 for the surface densities , we obtain for the bulk and surface reynolds numbers @xmath97 and hence we will set the reynolds numbers to zero in this paper .",
    "we note that it is straightforward to also consider positive reynolds numbers in our numerical algorithm , see @xcite for details . together with the other observations above ,",

    "however , studying the effect of the surface viscosity , e.g.  on the tank treading to tumbling transition in shearing experiments , is one of the main focuses of this paper .",
    "it is for this reason that we also consider the following alternative scaling , when suitable length and velocity scales are at hand .",
    "for example , we may choose the length scale @xmath66 based on the ( fixed ) size of the membrane and a velocity scale @xmath99 based on appropriate boundary velocity values .",

    "@xmath101 compares the surface shear viscosity to the bulk shear viscosity , @xmath102 is the bulk viscosity ratio and @xmath103 is an inverse capillary number , which describes the ratio of characteristic membrane stresses to viscous stresses .",
    "clearly , the system ( [ eq : scaling1 ] ) corresponds to ( [ eq : scaling2 ] ) with @xmath104 .",
    "hence from now on , we will only consider the scaling ( [ eq : scaling2 ] ) in detail .",
    "of course , the system ( [ eq : scaling2 ] ) needs to be supplemented with a boundary condition for @xmath84 or @xmath105 , and with an initial condition for @xmath106 . for the former we partition the boundary @xmath63 of @xmath30 into @xmath107 , where we prescribe a fixed velocity @xmath108 , and @xmath109 , where we prescribe the stress - free condition @xmath110 , with @xmath111 denoting the outer normal to @xmath30 .",
    "we note that our non - dimensionalization may be different to others presented in the literature",

    "our length scale @xmath66 may lead to simulations with @xmath114 , with @xmath115 , so that our non - dimensional parameters in ( [ eq : scaling2 ] ) correspond to the non - dimensional values for a fixed length scale @xmath116 as follows : @xmath117",
    "the numerical computations in this paper have been performed with a finite element approximation introduced by the authors in @xcite .",
    "the approach discretizes the bulk and surface degrees of freedom independently . in particular , the surface mesh is not a restriction of the bulk mesh .",
    "the bulk degrees of freedoms @xmath84 and @xmath34 are discretized with the lowest order taylor  hood element , p2p1 , in our numerical computations .",
    "the evolution of the membrane is tracked with the help of parametric meshes @xmath118 , which are updated by the fluid velocity .",
    "since the membrane surface is locally incompressible , it turns out that the surface mesh has good mesh properties during the evolution .",
    "this is in contrast to other fluid problems with interfaces in which the mesh often deteriorates during the evolution when updated with the fluid velocity , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the non - dimensionalized elastic forcing by the membrane curvature energy , @xmath119 in ( [ eq : scaling2 ] ) , is discretized with the help of a weak formulation by @xcite , which is generalized by @xcite to take spontaneous curvature and area difference elasticity effects into account . a main ingredient of the numerical approach is the fact that one can use a weak formulation of ( [ eq : fgamma ] ) that can be discretized in a stable way .",

    "the above identity shows that @xmath119 has a divergence structure .",
    "we remark here that similar divergence structures have been derived with the help of noether s theorem , see @xcite .",
    "the numerical method of @xcite has the feature that a semi - discrete , i.e.  continuous in time and discrete in space , version of the method obeys a discrete analog of the energy inequality ( [ eni ] ) .",
    "in addition , this semi - discrete version has the property that the volume enclosed by the vesicle and the membrane s surface area are conserved exactly .",
    "after discretization in time these properties are approximately fulfilled to a high accuracy , see section  [ sec4 ] .",
    "the fully discrete system is linear and fully coupled in the unknowns .",
    "the overall system is reduced by a schur complement approach to obtain a reduced system in just velocity and pressure unknowns . for this resulting linear system",
    "well - known solution techniques for finite element discretizations for the standard navier ",
    "stokes equations can be used , see @xcite .",
    "in shearing experiments the inclination angle of the vesicle in the shear flow direction is often of interest . here",
    "we will always consider shear flow in the @xmath127 direction with @xmath128 being the flow gradient direction .",
    "precisely , if @xmath129 ^ 2 \\times [ -w , w]$ ] , then we prescribe the inhomogeneous dirichlet boundary condition @xmath130 on the top and bottom boundaries @xmath131 ^ 2 \\times \\{\\pm w\\}$ ] . assuming the vesicle s centre of mass is at the origin ,",

    "the inclination angle @xmath145 is important for the classification of different types of dynamics in the shear flow experiments that we will present .",
    "the classical deformation dynamics for vesicles are the tank treading ( tt ) and the tumbling ( tu ) motions . in the tank treading motion the vesicle adopts a constant inclination angle in the flow , while the surface fluid rotates on the membrane surface . this motion is observed for small viscosity contrasts between the inner and the outer fluid and , as we will see later , at low surface membrane viscosity . at large viscosity contrasts or large membrane viscosity",
    "the tumbling motion occurs . in the tumbling regime",
    "the membrane rotates as a whole , and the inclination angle oscillates in the whole interval @xmath146 $ ] . in the last ten years a new dynamic regime for vesicles in shear flow has been identified . in this regime",

    "this motion was called vacillating - breathing and later the same motion was also called trembling , transition mode or swinging . following @xcite we will refer to this new regime as the transition ( tr ) mode .    in our numerical simulations",
