    "gromov - witten invariants , which are obtained from the intersection theory of the moduli spaces of pseudo - holomorphic curves without boundary , have provided exciting links to various branches of mathematics .",
    "open gromov - witten invariants from the intersection theory of pseudo - holomorphic curves with boundary , are still largely mysterious .",
    "most of the works in this direction has been carried out in the case that lagrangian submanifold is given as a fixed point set of anti - symplectic involution or in the calabi - yau case ( see for example , katz - liu @xcite , welschinger @xcite , cho @xcite , soloman @xcite , pandharipande - solomon - walsher @xcite , fukaya @xcite )    the fundamental difference between open and closed cases is that while the moduli spaces of closed pseudo - holomorphic curves carry fundamental cycles , but the moduli spaces of open pseudo - holomorphic curves do not carry fundamental cycles but only fundamental chains . as the chains do not have good interection property ,",
    "it is not clear in general how to define open gromomv - witten invariants .",
    "for example , even in the case of anti - symplectic involution , it is not yet known how to define them as an invariant for dimension @xmath0 . in this paper",
    ", we analyze two examples , three - point open gromov - witten numbers of lagrangian torus fibers in toric fano manifolds and a simple case of a open - closed invariants .    on the other hand the moduli space of pseudo - holomorphic discs is the main ingredient of the construction of @xmath1-algebra of lagrangian submanifolds by fukaya , oh , ohta and ono @xcite .",
    "the coefficients of @xmath2 operation are related to counts of pseudo - holomorphic discs which intersect @xmath3 in a cyclic order at the boundary of a disc ( without cyclic ordering , it corresponds to @xmath4 operation of induced @xmath5-algebra ) .",
    "a priori , these @xmath6 or @xmath4 are by nature , chain level operations , and in general do not provide homological invariants .    in this paper , we give a sufficient condition on chains to be intersected at the boundary so that totality of the bubbling off a disc becomes zero .",
    "we show that for a cyclic a - infinity algebras , such counting may be defined up to hochschild or cyclic boundary elements , which may provide an invariant counting in a generalized sense .",
    "in particular we obtain a well - defined function on hochschild or cyclic homology of a cyclic a - infinity algebra , which has invariance property under cyclic a - infinity homomorphism .",
    "the simple idea is that the condition to cancel out all discs bubbled off from the intersection problem with a given cycle @xmath7 , is related to hochschild or cyclic boundary operations .",
    "this is a revised version of the unpublished manuscript arxiv : math/0604502 using the language of cyclic @xmath1-algebras .",
    "let @xmath8 be a toric fano manifold .",
    "the floer theory of lagrangian torus fibers of @xmath8 has been developed in @xcite,@xcite and @xcite .",
    "the main characteristic of the theory is that its homology and the product structure is determined by the holomorphic discs of maslov index two . and",
    "the number of holomorphic discs intersecting generic three points has not been discussed there as it involves maslov index 4 discs . in this section ,",
    "we present elementary geometric argument to find such holomorphic discs .",
    "namely , we show that the count of holomorphic discs passing through generic 3 points depends on the choice of 3 points , by an explicit computation .",
    "we first consider the case of @xmath9 , and explain how to extend the result to the case of toric fano manifolds with lagrangian torus fibers later .",
    "for a lagrangian submanifold @xmath10 , we denote by @xmath11 the moduli space of simple @xmath12-holomorphic discs with three boundary marked points of homotopy class @xmath13 . recall that the moduli space @xmath11 has an expected dimension @xmath14 here @xmath15 is the maslov index .",
    "we have an evaluation map @xmath16 given by the evaluation at the marked points .",
    "we want to count the number of points in @xmath17 where @xmath18 s are disjoint generic points in @xmath19 .",
    "hence , to have a zero dimensional preimage , we require that @xmath20 .",
    "consider @xmath21 and a torus @xmath19 defined by @xmath22 we can also consider other tori by setting @xmath23 to be different positive real numbers than 1 , and the following computation will remain true by modifying constants appropriately .",
    "note that @xmath24 is generated by @xmath25 elements of whose maslov indices are two , which we denote by @xmath26 .",
    "they are homotopy classes of the maps @xmath27 defined by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is located at the @xmath30-st entry .",
    "let us fix a homotopy class of holomorphic disc to be @xmath31 , it is easy to see that for other homotopy classes with @xmath32 , there would nt be any intersection between holomorphic dics of such class and generic three points as one of the factor in @xmath21 above has to remain constant .    the holomorphic disc of class @xmath31 may be written as @xmath33    by using an automorphism of the domain @xmath34 and simplifying the first entry , the above map can be written as ( for @xmath35 ) @xmath36 now we consider three points on the torus @xmath19 . by applying the torus action , we may assume that the first point is given by @xmath37 now , denote two generic points of @xmath19 as @xmath38 we may assume that @xmath39 for all @xmath40 and that @xmath41 s are distinct by genericity .",
    "suppose the holomorphic disc given by the equation ( [ eq : disc ] ) passes through @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 at the boundary .",
    "then , the disc intersects @xmath42 when @xmath45 , intersects @xmath43 when @xmath46 and intersects @xmath44 at @xmath47 .    by plugging in @xmath48 to the equation ( [ eq : disc ] )",
    ", we obtain the following equations for each @xmath49 , @xmath50    now , we fix @xmath40 and solve the above equation ( find @xmath51 and @xmath52 ) to find the holomorphic disc ( [ eq : disc ] ) passing through @xmath53 .",
    "we first set @xmath54 since it has modulus one . here",
    "@xmath55 may be chosen as the complex argument ( between 0 and @xmath56 ) of @xmath57 .",
    "similarly , we set @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the complex argument of @xmath60 between @xmath61 and @xmath62 ( as @xmath51 is in the disc @xmath34 ) .",
    "the equation ( [ eq1.1 ] ) implies that @xmath63 modulo @xmath56 .",
    "now , the equation ( [ eq1.2 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath64 we rewrite this again using @xmath65 to obtain @xmath66    this implies that @xmath67 equals @xmath68 modulo @xmath56 .",
    "we let @xmath69,@xmath70,@xmath71 the points @xmath72 respectively . geometrically",
    "( usual counter clockwise ) angle from a vector @xmath73 to @xmath74 is given by @xmath75 from our choices of complex arguments .",
    "hence , we have @xmath76 if @xmath77 and otherwise @xmath75 equals @xmath78 or @xmath79 .    in any case , we observe from the elementary plane geometry that for any two points @xmath69,@xmath70 on a plane , the set of all points @xmath71 with a given fixed angle @xmath80 forms a circle , say @xmath81 , which passes through @xmath69 and @xmath70 ( drawn as a dotted circle in the figure [ sol ] ) .     figure for the equation [ eq1.2 ] , @xmath82 intersection of @xmath81 and @xmath83,height=211 ]",
    "hence @xmath51 lies on the circle @xmath81 , or more precisely lies on the arc @xmath84 .",
    "now consider the tangent line of the circle @xmath81 at @xmath85 and let @xmath86 be a point on this line different from @xmath69 .",
    "we also require that @xmath86 and @xmath71 to be located on the opposite side to each other with respect to the line @xmath87 .",
    "now we also consider the tangent line to @xmath88 at @xmath89 , and denote by @xmath90 the point @xmath91 which lies on this line .",
    "we have @xmath92    note that the points @xmath93 are already fixed .",
    "hence , simple computation shows the first claim .",
    "for the second claim , observe that the circle @xmath81 is the excircle of the triangle @xmath94 .",
    "hence we have @xmath95 actually , there can be two possibilities depending on whether @xmath71 lies above the line @xmath96 or below the line @xmath96 .",
    "if @xmath71 lies above the line @xmath96 we consider the @xmath80 to be the one between @xmath97 and @xmath56 so that it equals the angle from @xmath73 to @xmath74 which is @xmath98 .",
    "this also holds if @xmath71 lies below the line @xmath96 .",
    "hence we have @xmath99 which equals @xmath100 or @xmath101 .",
    "but the latter is always negative , hence we obtain the second claim .",
    "hence the circle @xmath81 on which @xmath51 sits , passes through @xmath89 and @xmath102 and intersects @xmath88 at @xmath89 with the angle @xmath103 .",
    "now the third equation ( [ eq1.3 ] ) can be solved in a similar way .",
    "the set of @xmath51 which solves the equation ( [ eq1.3 ] ) lies on a circle @xmath83 passing through @xmath89 and @xmath104 which intersect @xmath88 at @xmath89 with angle @xmath105 .",
    "to solve the ( [ eq1.1 ] ) - ( [ eq1.3 ] ) simultaneously for a fixed @xmath40 is equivalent to find an intersection of two circles @xmath81 and @xmath83 in the interior of @xmath34 , where the intersection point corresponds to @xmath51 .",
    "note that @xmath106 s are given by @xmath53 and whether there exist an intersection of two circles @xmath81 and @xmath83 in @xmath34 can be determined by the intersection angles @xmath107 of the two circles with @xmath88 .",
    "more precisely , one can check as in figure [ sol ] ( b ) that if @xmath108 , and @xmath109 , then the circles intersect at one interior point , or if @xmath110 , and @xmath111 , then the circles intersect at one interior point .",
    "in other cases , the circles do not intersect , which implies that there is no solution for the system of equations ( [ eq1.1 ] - [ eq1.3 ] ) .",
    "this can be summerized as the following proposition .",
    "[ pr:3pt ] let @xmath112 be generic three points on the torus @xmath113 .",
    "then if the cyclic ordering of three complex numbers @xmath114 on the unit circle @xmath115 agrees with the cyclic ordering of @xmath116 for all @xmath117 , then there is a holomorphic disc @xmath118 of the homotopy class @xmath119 , which passes through @xmath120 and @xmath44 . otherwise , there does not exist a holomorphic disc of the given homotopy class which passes through these three points .    in the case of toric fano manifolds ,",
    "we proceed in the following way .",
    "let @xmath121 be a complete @xmath25-dimensional fan of regular cones defining a toric manifold @xmath8 .",
    "let @xmath122 be the set of all generators of one dimensional cones in @xmath121 .",
    "recall that the toric manifold is obtained as @xmath123 where @xmath124 , where @xmath125 is a closed set related to the primitive collection .",
    "let @xmath126 be the subgroup in @xmath127 consisting of all lattice vectors @xmath128 such that @xmath129 @xmath130 where the map @xmath97 sends the basis vectors @xmath131 to @xmath132 for @xmath133 .",
    "define @xmath134 to be the connected commutative subgroup in @xmath135 generated by all one - parameter subgroups @xmath136 @xmath137 where @xmath138 .",
    "now , in @xcite yong - geun oh and the author , classified all holomorphic discs with boundary on lagrangian torus fibers .",
    "the classification theorem says that such a map can be lifted to a map @xmath139 such that each factor is given by blaschke products .",
    "more precisely , say @xmath40-th coordinate is given by @xmath140 where @xmath141 are non - negative integers for @xmath142 .",
    "hence , the homotopy classes of holomorphic discs is generated by @xmath143 for @xmath142 where @xmath143 the homotopy class of the map @xmath144 with @xmath29 in @xmath40-th entry .",
    "note that its maslov index is two .",
    "now , we fix a homotopy class @xmath145 with @xmath146 to consider three point open gromov - witten number .",
    "we write @xmath147 .",
    "we first assume the following condition on the indices @xmath148 .",
    "consider @xmath149 , where @xmath150 is a subgroup generated by standard vectors @xmath151 for @xmath152 . here",
    "@xmath153 since some @xmath154 can be repeated .",
    "now , we require that the image of @xmath150 under the map @xmath97 in ( [ kexact ] ) is equal to @xmath155 . otherwise , it is easy to show that the boundary images of the holomorphic discs which pass through a point on @xmath19 lies on a set of codimension one or higher due to the action of @xmath134 or the repitition of indices @xmath154 .",
    "hence without the assumption , the three point invariant would be always zero .",
    "the assumption also implies the following .",
    "we pick a generic point @xmath42 , and any lift @xmath156 .",
    "we write @xmath157 .",
    "then , there is a unique lift of @xmath19 to @xmath158 such that the @xmath30-th coordinate of any point in @xmath159 equals @xmath160 if @xmath161 for all @xmath162 .",
    "this follows from the assumption that @xmath97 is an isomorphism when restricted to @xmath163 .",
    "hence , we can lift the entire intersection problem to @xmath164 , and obtain the similar results as the proposition [ pr:3pt ] .",
    "note that we carried out the computation with the standard complex structure @xmath165 , but in @xcite it was also shown that @xmath165 is fredholm regular .",
    "this may be considered as a generic phenomenon .",
    "hence , the `` 3 -point open gromov - witten invariant with a fixed homotopy class '' is not well - defined for toric fano manifolds , namely , it depends on the choice of three points .",
    "we explain the above computation for the case of @xmath166 , where @xmath167|z_i \\in s^1\\}$ ] . in this case , there are three homotopy classes of maslov index 4 discs , @xmath168 . which contributes to the three point intersection .",
    ", height=124 ]    we identify @xmath19 with quotient of the rectangle as in the figure [ cp2 ] , and we may assume that @xmath42 corressponds to the vertex .",
    "we choose @xmath43 in the lower right corner of @xmath19 for simplicity .",
    "then , from the above proposition , the shaded area in each figure @xmath169 corresponds to the possible position of @xmath44 so that @xmath53 intersects the maslov index 4 disc of homotopy class @xmath170 with indices considered modulo 3 .",
    "surprisingly in this case , the total sum of such holomorphic discs with sign actually vanishes . in the rightmost figure , in each region , the homotopy classes of holomorphic discs which passes through are described and one can notice that either there exists no holomorphic discs of maslov index 4 at all or they occur in pairs .",
    "unfortuanately , this kind of phenomenon does not seem to occur for intersection problems with more than 3 points .",
    "although this section ( except this example ) is from the preprint arxiv : math/0604502 , we learned the vanishing of @xmath171 counting from the discussion with biran and cornea who considered somewhat different enumerative invariants for @xmath172 with a different methods in @xcite .",
    "in this section , we show an example of open - closed gromov - witten type invariant considering two different intersection problems together    let @xmath173 be the signed number of @xmath12-holomorphic discs of maslov index 2 in @xmath174 with boundary on @xmath175 which intersect a fixed generic hyperplane @xmath176 at the interior of the disc and a point @xmath177 at the boundary .",
    "let @xmath178 be the signed number of intersections of the hyperplane @xmath176 with 2 dimensional chain @xmath179 .",
    "then @xmath180 for any generic choice of hyperplane and for a generic point @xmath177 and for any generic complex structure @xmath181 .",
    "first of all , @xmath182 depends on the choice of @xmath183 and @xmath12 , hence this is not a usual enumerative problem . if we do not add the intersection number of the hyperplane with a certain 2-chain @xmath182 , the number of holomorphic disc with the given intersection condition actually changes .",
    "see figure [ cob ] : when the hyperplane intersects the interior of the triangle @xmath182 , it does not intersect any holomorphic disc .",
    "we first explain the two dimensional chain @xmath182 which depends on @xmath183 and @xmath12 . in @xcite",
    ", we explained that although bott - morse floer cohomology of the clifford torus is isomorphic to the singular cohomology of the torus , the actual cycles of each homology are different .",
    "for example @xmath184 in the singular cohomology for a point @xmath177 , but @xmath185 where @xmath186 is the boundary image of the holomorphic disc @xmath187 $ ] with @xmath35 in the @xmath188-th entry . note that @xmath189 is not zero on the chain level , but is homologous to zero .",
    "hence we can choose a 2-chain @xmath190 with @xmath191 , then the sum @xmath192 , turns out to be the correct cycle in floer homology(see @xcite for details ) . in the theorem",
    ", the higher order terms do not appear due to a dimensional reason .",
    "we also remind the reader that from the proposition 4.1 of @xcite , the cycle @xmath193 for another point @xmath194 is in the same floer cohomology class as that of @xmath183 .    in the case of a generic compatible almost complex structure @xmath12",
    ", we may assume that all the simple @xmath12-holomorphic discs are fredholm regular .",
    "in fact , in our case , the maslov index 2 discs are minimal ( can not bubble off a disc ) , hence is automatically simple .",
    "hence , we can define the chain @xmath182 for the generic @xmath12 as above .",
    "also , for a generic family of @xmath195 , @xmath196 } q_p^{j_t}$ ] can be chosen so that it defines a geometric chain in @xmath19 whose boundary is @xmath197 .",
    "the idea of the proof is that these holomorphic discs of maslov index two ( up to @xmath198 action ) can be put together , but they form a chain with a boundary , which is homologous to zero .",
    "and @xmath199 is the two dimensional chain whose boundary is exactly the same as that of discs but with an opposite sign .",
    "hence , when they are considered together , they behave like a cycle .",
    "the independence over the choice of the hyperplane @xmath176 or the point @xmath183 can be proved similarly and we only show that it is independent over the choice of generic almost complex structure @xmath12 . here , we choose @xmath200 , @xmath201 generic and choose a generic path @xmath195 connecting @xmath165 and @xmath200 .",
    "we consider the moduli space @xmath202 for some @xmath203 with @xmath204 .",
    "this is the moduli space of @xmath195-holomorphic discs of homotopy class @xmath145 with one interior and one boundary marked points .",
    "and we consider the moduli space @xmath205 .",
    "there is an obvious evaluation map @xmath206 .",
    "the preimage @xmath207 provide a cobordism of a counting between the case of @xmath165 and @xmath200 .",
    "but , there is additional codimension one boundary stratum , obtained as the interior point approaches to @xmath88 .",
    "this maybe considered as @xmath208 where @xmath209 is the bott - morse floer boundary operator .",
    "now , we consider the intersection of @xmath176 with @xmath196 } q_p^{j_t}$ ] .",
    "note that the latter is a 3-dimensional chain . by genericity ,",
    "the intersections are one dimensional manifolds with boundaries .",
    "the possible boundary terms are @xmath210 , @xmath211 or @xmath212 .",
    "the first two terms provide the cobordism between the counting for @xmath165 and @xmath200 , and the last term @xmath211 will cancel out @xmath213 which appeared previously . here , @xmath214 where @xmath215 is a part of the bott - morse floer boundary operator which takes a boundary of a chain .",
    "in fact the above statement can be verified that it holds with @xmath216-coefficients . or one observes that if one proceeds with a given orientation conventions , then one can always adjust the orientation of @xmath217 so that the above statement holds with sign .",
    "the figure [ cob ] shows an example of a cobordism between two different choices of hyperplanes in @xmath174 .",
    "note that the middle part of the cobordism is given by the intersection @xmath218 .",
    "an easy count is given when a hyperplane is given by @xmath219| u_0 = 0\\}$ ] and a disc given by@xmath220 $ ] with @xmath221 .",
    "we remark that chains such as @xmath182 are quite natural as they appear as a part of @xmath222-homology cycle of the floer homology of torus fibers in toric manifolds .",
    "namely , recall from proposition 4.1 @xcite that , if the floer cohomology is non - vanishing , for any chain @xmath223 with @xmath224 , there is a sum of chains @xmath225 , which defines a cycle in the bott - morse floer cohomology . in the case of the clifford torus @xmath226",
    ", this formula is written as @xmath227 where @xmath228 is the 2 dimensional chain defined in section 3 , with @xmath229 \\in { \\mathbb{c}p}^n$ ] , and @xmath162 is the largest integer smaller than @xmath230 .",
    "there is a slight error in the definition 4.4 of @xcite where we need to replace @xmath231 by @xmath232 . and",
    "the chains such as @xmath233 are defined as geometric chains using by multiplication in @xmath234 .",
    "hence , for example , one may consider product of point homology cycles and its @xmath235-product is well - defined homologically .",
    "this would in turn imply the invariance property of the sum of several intersection problems involving higher order terms of ( [ qqqp ] ) . here",
    "invariance is with a fixed @xmath165 as for @xmath236 , we do not know a precise form of higher order terms of ( [ qqqp ] ) .",

    "is defined as @xmath307 from the invariant - coinvariant relation , one can also define cyclic homology by @xmath308 considering invariant elements of cyclic action on @xmath309 with bar differential @xmath310 .",

    "here @xmath315 is not well - defined as a map to @xmath309 but is well - defined as a map to @xmath314 .",
    "in this section , we show that cyclic symmetry provides a function on homology theories of a - infinty algebras , namely , function on hochschild , cyclic homology of @xmath1-algebra or on ( cyclic ) chevalley - eilenberg homology of the induced @xmath5-algebra .",
    "( in the preprint of 2006 , we called it big cohomology cycles , but they were in fact well - known homology cycles . see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "now , we consider the filtered @xmath1-algebra of lagrangian submanifold defined in @xcite .",
    "consider an intersection problem of a holomorphic disc with @xmath319 marked points intersecting chains @xmath320 at the corresponding marked points .",
    "one observes that with the cyclic inner product @xmath250 defined from the usual intersection pairing , the number of such holomorphic discs with prescribed intersection may be given by @xmath321 .",
    "now , consider a moduli space of holomorphic discs with @xmath319 marked points intersecting chains @xmath320 and its boundary strata from the disc bubblings .",
    "in fact , when there exist a disc bubbling , we can not tell which component is the original or the bubble ( say @xmath322 or @xmath323 ) .",

    "@xmath322 and @xmath323 corresponds to the first and third term of ( [ eq22 ] ) .",
    "hence the heuristic idea suggests that with cyclicity , intersection with hochschild cycles do not have codimension one strata from disc bubbling ( as they cancel out ) , and should have an invariant intersection number .",
    "but in fact , the argument above is not entirely correct as it is not yet possible to construct cyclic @xmath1-algebra of singular chains on @xmath19 directly due to technical issues of transversality , but fukaya has constructed a cyclic @xmath1-algebra for the differential forms of @xmath19 . from now on ,",
    "we consider general cyclic @xmath1-algebras .",
    "[ generalfunction2 ] for a cyclic @xmath1-algebra @xmath69 , @xmath327 gives rise to a well - defined function on @xmath328 .",

    "note that for cyclic @xmath1-algebra , we have for any @xmath253 , @xmath340 from this , we note that @xmath316 vanishes on @xmath341 . and",
    "as cyclic homology is defined by the connes complex @xmath342 , the discussion for hochschild homology implies also that @xmath343 gives a well - defined function on cyclic homology also . by symmetrization ,",
    "one obtains similar statement for cyclic chevalley - eilenberg homology :    [ generalfunction ] for an @xmath1-algebra @xmath69 , @xmath327 gives rise to well - defined functions on the cyclic homology of @xmath69 and the cyclic chevalley - eilenberg homology of the underlying @xmath5-algebra @xmath329 @xmath344              we explain the invariance of the function @xmath316 with respect to the cyclic @xmath1-homomorphism .",

    "namely @xmath358 @xmath359 @xmath360 here , first equality follows from the definition of @xmath354 , and the second equality is @xmath1-equation on the lhs , and the third and the last equalities are from the definition of cyclic @xmath1-homomorphism .",
