    "the smooth accretion of gas onto galaxies allows for continuous galaxy evolution and star formation .",
    "the intergalactic gas which feeds galaxies is seen in absorption against a bright background source along filaments of galaxies ( e.g. penton , stocke & shull 2002 ) and is predicted by simulations of the `` cosmic web '' ( e.g. dav  1999 ) .",
    "when this gas reaches a certain radius from the galaxy , it may be able to condense and cool , and in the case of our own galaxy , the gas could become observable in 21-cm emission .",
    "together with the remnants of galactic satellites , these objects may be represented by the high - velocity clouds ( oort 1966 ) .",
    "high - velocity clouds are concentrations of neutral hydrogen which do not fit into a simple model of galactic rotation and cover 30 - 40% of the sky ( e.g.  wakker & van woerden 1991 ; lockman et al .",
    "there have been several models which propose that hvcs are the primordial building blocks of galaxies , the leftovers along the supergalactic filaments .",
    "blitz  ( 1999 ) and braun & burton ( 1999 ) proposed hvcs , in particular the compact hvcs ( chvcs ) , represent the missing satellites of the local group , at mean distances of @xmath01 mpc . these models have been called into question ( e.g. zwaan 2002 ; sternberg , mckee & wolfire 2002 ; maloney & putman 2003 ) .",
    "observations provide a direct test of whether hvcs are infalling members of the local group at large distances from the galaxy .",
    "models of the galactic ionizing radiation field indicate that ionizing photons are capable of reaching distances on the order of 100 kpc ; hvcs can act as an  screen and the  emission measure reflects the ionizing photon flux reaching the cloud ( bland - hawthorn & maloney 1999 , hereafter b99 ; bland - hawthorn & maloney 2002 , hereafter b02 ) .",
    "this is confirmed by recent  observations of large high velocity complexes which have direct distance bounds of @xmath3 10 kpc ( tufte  1998 ; hereafter t98 ) .",
    "if any of the hvcs are at distances on the order of 1 mpc they should not be detectable , as the cosmic ionizing background is too low ; therefore , any detection of  emission brings the hvcs within the extended galactic halo .",
    "observations of hvcs with known distances also provide insight into how the ionizing radiation escapes from the galactic disk , other ionization processes present in the galactic halo , and the nature of the halo / igm interface .",
    "in this paper we present hvc optical line emission observations to investigate the relationship between hvcs and the galaxy .",
    "the paper begins by summarizing the fabry - perot and long slit  observations in @xmath42 , and presents the results of the observations in @xmath43 . in @xmath44 - 5",
    ", we discuss our findings and interpret them in the context of the location and environment of the hvcs .",
    "the ionization of the magellanic stream is considered in @xmath46 and an overview of the results is presented in @xmath47 .",
    "the fabry - perot  observations were obtained in five anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) observing runs from december 1997 - june 1999 and one william herschel telescope ( wht ) run in january 1999 . at both sites ,",
    "the taurus-2 interferometer was used in conjunction with the university of maryland 44@xmath5 m etalon .",
    "single orders of interference were isolated using 4-cavity blocking filters with high throughput ( 80@xmath690% ) and bandpasses well matched to the etalon free spectral ranges .",
    "the focal plane was baffled to give either a 10  or , on the wht ( northern objects ) , a 5.0  field . the resulting ring pattern covered about 45 ( , @xmath76583 ) at the aat and 20 ( ) at the wht .",
    "the resolution is 1 ( or 46  at ) .",
    "the repeated exposures were generally 10@xmath620 minutes .",
    "a deep sky exposure was also made in a region 5@xmath620  away from the cloud , at a position that does not contain any high - velocity  based on hipass limits ( @xmath8 @xmath9 ) .",
    "the reduction and analysis is discussed in bland - hawthorn  ( 1998 ; hereafter b98 ) .",
    "hvcs and corresponding deep sky exposures were also observed with the double beam spectrograph ( dbs ) on the siding spring observatory 2.3 m telescope over 5 observing runs from august 1998 - april 2000 .",
    "the dbs was set up with a 7@xmath10 long slit and a slit width of 2@xmath11 , yielding a spectral resolution of 0.57 a ( 26  at ) .",
    "spectral reduction was done using the vista and iraf reduction packages .",
    "the two - dimensional spectra from the large sets of exposures obtained on target and sky were each reduced separately .",
    "the procedure involved bias subtraction using both bias frames and the overscan area on each exposure , flatfielding using qi lamp exposures , and cosmic ray removal with a 2.5-@xmath12 high / low filter .",
    "s - distortions and illumination effects along the slit were removed at this stage using the positions and intensity profiles of the sky lines .",
    "the central 240 rows of each 2d spectrum were extracted and then wavelength calibrated based on the positions of the sky lines in the object s spectrum ( only possible with the red spectra ) and the near lamp spectra obtained at the same airmass as , and immediately before or after , the object s exposure .",
    "the spectra were put on an absolute flux scale using the spectra of flux standards obtained throughout the night .",
    "each objects exposures were added together after aligning the spectra using the closest skyline to the expected emission from the hvc as a guide .",
    "an example of a dbs spectrum is shown in figure 1 .",
    "we examined the deep sky exposures closely for signs of  emission at a velocity similar to the closest detectable and found no indication of emission .",
    "this was especially important to check considering the ovi that has been detected in absorption at the velocities of nearby  hvcs , but off the  contours of these clouds ( sembach et al . 2003 ) , and the extended low  column density emission found around cataloged hvcs ( lockman et al .",
    "we assume foreground galactic extinction along a given sight line , measured from the cobe / dirbe maps ( schlegel  1998 ) , and therefore correct all  emission measures ( e@xmath13 ) for dust extinction .",
    "we also include the uncorrected e@xmath13 values in tables 1 and 2 , as the dust correction may not be realistic for the low latitude clouds . e@xmath13 upper limits quoted throughout this paper are 2-sigma for the taurus data and",
    "3-sigma for the dbs data .",
    "our characteristic detection errors are approximately 10 mr if the  detection is at least 2 from a skyline , but close to a skyline the errors can reach 15 - 30 mr . future use of the nod+shuffle technique ( glazebrook & bland - hawthorn 2001 ) with the fabry - perot staring method may be able to reach levels of @xmath05 mr .",
    "many of the observed hvcs were first identified by hipass ( see putman  2002a ; hereafter p02 ) .",
    "this is especially true of the chvcs .",
    "the clouds observed were chosen because they have :  velocities which isolate an equivalent velocity  line from the skylines , a proposed extragalactic nature ( e.g. the chvcs ) , and/or an estimate has been made of their distance and/or origin ( e.g. complex m , magellanic stream ) . in the latter case , the observations could be used to clarify the nature of the  emission .",
    "several positions observed by weiner & williams ( 1996 ; hereafter ww96 ) and t98 were repeated to compare observing and reduction methods .",
    "the results of the observations are described in table 1 and 2 .",
    "table 1 lists the positive detections and table 2 the non - detections .",
    "the objects are grouped in terms of their high - velocity classification and are named either by their traditional name or by their p02 classification , which is the type of cloud ( chvc = compact hvc , : hvc = slightly more extended than a chvc , hvc = extended hvc , or xhvc = a hvc which has  emission that merges with galactic velocities ) , followed by the intensity weighted galactic longitude and latitude and the central lsr velocity .",
    "the  properties are from p02 ( excluding the northern targets which are from the lds ( e.g. complexes h and m ) ) and are always taken along the sightline of the  observation .",
    "the results of b98 , t98 , and tufte et al .",
    "( 2002 ; hereafter t02 ) are also included in table 1 .",
    "the columns of table 1 are : @xmath14 and @xmath15 coordinates of the  observation , hvc name ,  column density ,  velocity ( lsr ) ,  velocity width , the extinction corrected  emission measure with w or d in parentheses if the result is from wham or the dbs respectively , the value of the  emission measure before the extinction correction , the [ nii]@xmath76583/  ratio , the velocity of the  detection ( lsr ) , and the predicted distance to the hvc based on its @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and extinction corrected emission measure ( see @xmath44 ) . some of the [ nii]/  ratios are not included due to the observation not including the wavelength of the [ nii]@xmath76583 line ( i.e. the wht and wham observations ) .",
    "table 2 does not include the [ nii]/  ratio or the predicted distance ( see @xmath45 ) , but does include two limits on [ oiii ] emission .    the close relationship between  velocity and  velocity is shown in figure 2 and the complete lack of correlation between the  emission measure and  column density",
    "is shown in figure 3 .",
    "this is what would be expected if the outer skin of the hvc is being ionized by an external ionizing radiation field .",
    "figure 2 also shows that non - detections ( open diamonds ) span the entire range of high velocities . though not shown , there is also no relationship between the strength of the emission and the velocity of the hvc ( in the lsr or gsr reference frame ) .",
    "figure 3 shows that undetected clouds span the entire range of  column densities , i.e. there does not currently seem to be a lower or upper column density cutoff .",
    "the distribution of the  detections and non - detections on the sky in galactic coordinates is shown in figure 4 , and a large number of the  observations are depicted on the  map of the magellanic system shown in figure 5 .",
    "we now discuss the specific detections listed in table 1 and the undetected clouds listed in table 2 .",
    "pictures and spectra of most of the high - velocity complexes are shown in putman ( 2000 ) .",
    "* complexes : * several of the hvcs detected in  are part of larger complexes which are defined by wakker & van woerden ( 1991 ) .",
    "the  brightest of these is complex l , a negative velocity hvc made up of several clumpy filaments , with several small clouds scattered amongst the filaments .",
    "the cloud mapped here is hvc341.6 + 31.4 - 142 in the p02 catalog and the brightest emission lies closest to the head of the cloud .",
    "complex l has a highly elevated [ nii]/  ratio ( 2.7 ) .",
    "along with the detections there was one non - detection in a very low column density ( @xmath16 @xmath9 ) part of complex l. all of the positions with bright detections have column densities between 1.6 - 3.6 @xmath17 @xmath9 .",
    "the other detected complexes are : complex m , which has an upper distance constraint of @xmath3 4 kpc ( ryans et al .",
    "1997 ) and was detected at a similar level by t98 , complex h , which lies along the galactic plane making this detection more tentative ( especially since the velocity is offset by 30  from the  velocity ) , and complex gcp ( smith cloud ) which was originally presented in b98 and now has a limit on the [ oiii ] emission at the position of smith1 ( @xmath3 70 mr ; table 2 ) .",
    "we include the t98 detections of complexes a and c with a model distance because they have direct distance limits of 4 - 10 kpc ( van woerden et al .",
    "1999 ) and @xmath18 6 kpc ( wakker 2001 ) , respectively .    * the magellanic stream : * the magellanic stream shown in figure 5 is the result of the interaction of the large and small magellanic cloud with each other and the galaxy .",
    "it trails the magellanic clouds for over 100@xmath19 through the south galactic pole and has a velocity gradient of 700  from head to tail ( relative to the local standard of rest ; 400  relative to the galaxy ) .",
    "the stream is a complicated network of filaments and clumps , but remains relatively continuous along its entire length ( see putman et al .",
    "2003 ; hereafter p03 ) .",
    "stars have not yet been found in the stream ( e.g. guhathakurta & reitzel 1998 ) , but emission has been previously detected by ww96 at the level of 200 - 400 mr .",
    "we observed several positions along the magellanic stream , including one repeat of a ww96 observation , with both taurus and the dbs .",
    "the repeat observation of msiia is approximately the same as ww96 with taurus , but is lower with the dbs .",
    "this could be due to the difference in the field of view of taurus and the dbs ( a 10  diameter fov versus a 7  @xmath20 2@xmath11 slit ) .",
    "[ nii ] was also detected and the ratio to  is low compared to the smith cloud and complex l ( 0.15 vs. 0.6 - 2.7 ) .",
    "msiia was subsequently observed in [ oiii]@xmath75007 and no detection was obtained ( @xmath3 52 mr ; table 2 ) .",
    "as tabulated in table 1 , a new relatively weak  detection was made at the head of the stream , ( @xmath21 ) = 304 , -67 , and at the position of the background qso fairall  9 where ovi absorption has also been detected ( @xmath22 @xmath9 ; sembach et al .",
    "there was also a non - detection at ( @xmath21 ) = 293.4 , -56.4  and at the tail of the stream ( msv ; ( @xmath21 ) = 96.5 , -53.9 ) as tabulated in table 2 .",
    "as shown in figure 5 , there are large variations in the strength of the  emission along the stream s length , and so far there does not seem to be a correlation with the  column density ( figure 3 ) .",
    "however , one should consider that the beam used in the  observations is larger than the fov of taurus ( 15.5  vs. 10 ) .",
    "though the number of observations remains limited , there also does not seem to be a gradient of  brightness along the stream .",
    "currently , the brightest detection is approximately at the south galactic pole in a region of complexity in terms of the high - velocity  gas distribution ( p03 ) .",
    "the velocities of the  and  lines generally closely agree ( within @xmath010 ; figure 2 ) .",
    "several positions along the magellanic bridge and leading arm were also observed .",
    "all of the pointings were non - detections ( see table 2 and figure 5 ) , except for an extremely bright observation at the position of a known ob association ( bridge m in table 1 ; see also marcelin  ( 1985 ) ) .",
    "* compact high - velocity clouds ( chvcs ) : * two compact high - velocity clouds ( chvcs ) were detected with the dbs .",
    "chvc197.0 - 81.8 - 184 is located @xmath23  from the stream where it passes through the south galactic pole ( see figure 5 ) .",
    "the  detection of this cloud ( fig .",
    "1 ) is at the level of many of the stream detections .",
    "the second chvc is a very small and isolated cloud located in the region leading the lmc ( figure 5 ) .",
    "chvc266.0 - 18.7 + 336 has a velocity which places the  line at the edge of a skyline , making the brightness of this detection somewhat less certain .",
    "the chvc detections of t02 with model distances are also included in table 1 .",
    "there are several clouds which were not detected in this survey and are summarized in table 2 .",
    "some of these clouds have detections reported in the conference proceedings of weiner et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , but the precise coordinates of their observations have not yet been reported . this is not unusual considering the range of detections and non - detections noted in the previous section within the same high - velocity complex .",
    "many of the hvcs which we have only non - detections for lie in approximately the same region of the sky ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "the undetected clouds mostly lie in the galactic longitude range of @xmath24@xmath6 320 , and include the length of the leading arm of the magellanic system ( figure 5 ) , several hvcs and chvcs , and part of the extreme positive velocity complex .",
    "we note that many of these clouds ( marked with a @xmath25 in table 2 ) have velocities that place the  line close to a skyline , making the non - detections somewhat less certain .",
    "additional non - detections include the high positive velocity cloud hipass j1712 - 64 ( kilborn  2000 ) which has an  upper limit of 44 mr , and the clouds associated with the sculptor dsph galaxy by carignan  ( 1998 ) ( cataloged as chvc286.3 - 83.5 + 091 and chvc290.6 - 82.8 + 095 in p02 ) .",
    "it is unclear if these clouds are actually associated with the sculptor dsph .",
    "the  maps of p03 and carignan ( 1999 ) show the complexity of this region in high - velocity gas , with a high concentration of clouds at similar and very different velocities to the sculptor dsph .",
    "there is an undetected negative velocity xhvc at approximately -145  along our observed sightline to the clouds associated with the sculptor dsph , as well as a nearby positive velocity xhvc , which was also undetected .",
    "the  distance constraint is based on photoionizing radiation escaping from the galactic disk and ionizing the surface of clouds within the galactic halo ( b98 ) .",
    "it relies on our knowing the strength and morphology of the halo ionizing field , and can be affected by a cloud s covering fraction , topology , and orientation to our line of sight ( b02 ) .",
    "variations in brightness across a single hvc may be due to these issues , and we stress that the  brightest point on the hvc ( i.e. the point on the cloud receiving the most ionizing photons from our galaxy ) is the measure that should be used when estimating the hvc distance .",
    "since we will not know if we have observed the brightest point on a particular hvc until we are able to do large scale  mapping of each cloud , our far field distance estimates in table 1 currently serve as upper limits .",
    "several hvcs with strong direct distance contraints ( see wakker ( 2000 ) for a summary ) have now been detected in  by wham ( t98 ) , weiner  ( 2001 ) , and this survey .",
    "there is also an ivc ( complex k ; haffner  2001 ) that has been completely mapped in  emission and has a distance constraint .",
    "the  emission measures from these clouds are consistent with the model predictions of b99 @xmath6 updated in b02 to include spiral arms @xmath6 which uses an escape fraction normal to the disk of  @xmath26 6% (  @xmath1 @xmath27% averaged over @xmath28 sr ) .",
    "the escape fraction used in the b02 spiral arm model has been adopted based on its agreement with the direct distance determinations and  emission measures for complex a , m , c , and the ivc , complex k. it has a factor of two uncertainty which could affect the predicted distances listed in table 1 by 50% .",
    "figure 6 shows the effect of using a model with spiral arms compared to exponential and uniform disk models .",
    "the halo ionization field is very different for a dusty spiral versus an exponential disk within 10 kpc of the galactic disk .",
    "all of the hvcs detected in  emission would be at distances within 40 kpc in the context of this model .",
    "the detection of two chvcs indicates that some fraction of this population falls within the extended galactic halo .",
    "this is supported by the chvc detections of t02 .",
    "these chvcs would be within @xmath013 kpc using this distance determination method . the model prediction for a radius vector towards complex l",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "note that the spiral arm model predicts that complex l lies directly over a spiral arm , but there is a near and far field solution , depending on its exact position .",
    "there is some indication that hvcs along sightlines over spiral arms are brighter , as expected for clouds within about 10 kpc ( b02 ) , but more sightlines are needed to confirm this .",
    "though the detection of  emission argues for hvcs being within the galactic halo , the brightness of the magellanic stream detections needs to be understood before the distance constraint can be considered fully reliable ( see @xmath46 and bland - hawthorn & putman 2001 , hereafter b01 ) .",
    "we also note that complex l and gcp ( the smith cloud ) not only have high  emission measures ( which makes sense , as they most likely lie inside the solar circle above the spiral arms ) , but also elevated  emission .",
    "the [ nii ] emission may be an indication of enhanced electron temperatures ( reynolds , haffner & tufte 1999 ) , rather than the presence of an alternative source of ionization ( shocks ) .",
    "there are a variety of ways to produce this effect ( photoelectric heating ( wolfire  1995 ) ) , and the enhanced low - ionization emission is also seen in the high latitude gas of spirals ( haffner  1999 ; veilleux  1995 ; miller & veilleux 2003a , 2003b ) .",
    "in essence , we can use the elevated  to argue that some hvcs are more than several kiloparsecs from the plane , and comprise part of the extended ionized atmosphere seen in external galaxies .",
    "further support comes from  structure of these clouds , each of which show possible extensions into galactic .",
    "if the  normalization to local hvcs is valid , this may indicate that some hvcs which are faint or undetected in , particularly those at high latitude , are dispersed throughout the extended halo on scales of 50  kpc or more . the cosmic ionizing background radiation ( @xmath29 phot / s ; maloney & bland - hawthorn 1999 ) would correspond to a 5 mr  detection and would only begin to dominate over the galactic ionizing radiation field approximately 100 kpc from our galaxy .",
    "considering the  upper limits in some cases and the variations in intensity across the hvcs , it remains to be seen whether most of the clouds which have non - detections are actually at large distances from the galactic plane .  mapping across an entire hvc to find the brightest  emission , higher resolution  observations to clarify the column density at the position of the  observation , and the development of models of the escape of ionizing radiation from the galactic plane will help resolve the non - detection issue .",
    "it may be that some clouds will remain undetected in certain directions if they lie at too low an angle from our viewpoint , or do not lie above spiral arms or hii regions .",
    "shadowing and the size of the taurus beam may also be important considerations",
    ". there may be an _ observed _ relationship between the strength of  and the position of the cloud above the galaxy , as clouds at @xmath30 330and @xmath31 60  have a slight tendency to be brighter and clouds between @xmath32 remain largely undetected ( figure 4 ) .",
    "this is expected from their line of sight over the galaxy ( see taylor & cordes 1993 ) and from the b02 model .",
    "the stream is brightest at the south galactic pole and fainter towards the head and tail .",
    "this would be expected for halo gas ionized by an opaque disk where ionizing photons escape preferentially along the galactic poles ( b99 ) .",
    "the match between the  velocity and the  velocity for all clouds supports photoionization .",
    "however , if ionizing photons from the galaxy are reaching hvcs at distances of @xmath010 kpc , why are stream positions near the south galactic pole , which most likely lie at distances between 20 @xmath6 100 kpc ( gardiner 1999 ; moore & davis 1994 ) , consistently brighter than the hvcs ?",
    "as shown in figure 8 , at a mean stream distance of 55  kpc , the expected emission measure of a flat  stream is 30@xmath650  mr ( b02 ) , an order of magnitude fainter than the brightest detections .",
    "figure 8 also shows that the contribution from the lmc will not play a dominant role in ionizing the majority of the stream .",
    "is it possible that sections of the stream are just that much closer to the galaxy disk than the magellanic clouds ? with the detection of the head of the stream ( fairall  9 sightline ) , this possibility seems unlikely , as the head of the stream is presumed to be close to the magellanic clouds ( 50 - 60 kpc ) .",
    "thus the distances predicted in table 1 for the stream sightlines are not relevant and we need to look for another source of ionization in the stream .",
    "the detection of o  vi absorption in and around the stream may provide some clues ( sembach  2003 ) .",
    "interaction with a halo medium could provide some pre - ionization which could elevate the stream s .",
    "the outer halo medium may well be clumpy , particularly at the poles , from the leftovers of other satellites or from self - interaction of the stream ( b01 ; p03 ) .",
    "chvc197.0 - 81.8 - 184 may represent some of this debris .",
    "this chvc is only 10  from the main filament of the stream and is as  bright as the stream , possibly indicating a large spread of debris associated with stream s  emission .",
    "two of the t02 detected chvcs ( shown in fig .",
    "5 ) may also represent the spread of ionized stream debris .",
    "another possibility is that there are stars associated with the stream which have yet to be detected .",
    "recent results have found small isolated hii regions in interacting systems that can be ionized by a few o stars ( e.g. , gerhard et al .",
    "2002 ; ryan - weber et al .",
    "this indicates that isolated star formation can be triggered in low density interactive debris , which could in turn play an important role in ionizing this material .",
    "a single massive o star 1 kpc from the stream could lead to an emission measure of 40 mr .",
    "if the star was actually embedded in the stream this contribution would obviously be much higher .",
    "white dwarfs would not significantly contribute to the ionization of the magellanic stream unless their density was much higher than that found in the solar neighborhood ( bland - hawthorn , freeman , & quinn 1997 ) .",
    "thus far , only limited areas of the stream have been surveyed for stars .",
    "ongoing and future stellar surveys will provide further insight into the possibility of the stream harboring young , ionizing stars .",
    "the  observations presented here are a combination of detections and non - detections on clouds with  column densities greater than a few times 10@xmath33 @xmath9 .",
    "this represents the complex nature of the ionized component of hvcs and the importance of mapping across an entire cloud before accepting a non - detection as meaningful for the entire high - velocity complex .",
    "the results thus far show a population of clouds which appear to extend out of galactic  emission , are  bright , and show an elevated  ratio , as well as an undetected population which tend to be in a specific region of galactic longitude and are relatively isolated from galactic emission .",
    "the detection of several chvcs in both this paper and the t02 paper indicates that many of these clouds are indeed within the galactic halo .",
    "the non - detections of some chvcs can not be used to argue for a greater distance until the origin of the non - detections in other complexes is understood .",
    "the  emission measures of the clouds with distance constraints are consistent with the surfaces of the clouds being ionized by @xmath34% of the galaxy s ionizing photons .",
    "all of the clouds detected here are within 40 kpc of our galaxy based on their level of  emission .",
    "the magellanic stream appears to fall into a different category than the currently detected hvcs , with bright  emission but little or no [ nii ] emission , possibly due to the lower metallicities of the magellanic clouds compared to the galaxy .",
    "the strength of the  emission can not be easily explained by photoionization from the galaxy alone , and it is possible that interaction with halo debris , or the presence of yet unassociated young stars , is partially responsible for the stream s elevated  emission . through future  observations which include mapping head - tail clouds , the length of the magellanic stream , ovi absorption sightlines , and complexes of known distance , and the development of models which trace the path of the escaping photons from the galactic plane , we may come to a consensus on the origin of the  emission in all high - velocity clouds .",

    "<S> it has bright  emission and little [ nii ] emission and appears to fall into a different category than the currently detected hvcs </S>",
    "<S> . this may reflect the lower metallicities of the magellanic clouds compared to the galaxy , but the strength of the  emission can not be explained solely by photoionization from the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> the interaction of the stream with halo gas or the presence of yet unassociated young stars may assist in ionizing the stream . </S>"
