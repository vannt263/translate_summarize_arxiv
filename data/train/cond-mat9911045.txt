    "the studies on the localization of electronic states in disordered solids can be traced back to the seminal paper of p. w. anderson  @xcite where the localization of quantum states was first discussed in connection with transport properties of a random lattice .",
    "this is a natural association , since the extended or localized nature of the one - particle wave - functions in a disordered system plays a key role in the determination of the metallic or insulating character of the system itself . as an outstanding example of the link between transport properties and wave - function localization in random media one could cite , for instance , the metal - insulator transition that occurs in disordered three - dimensional samples upon increasing the randomness of the material .",
    "the importance of the anderson localization , however , far exceeds the limited field of condensed matter physics .",
    "that is mainly due to the fact that quantum interference is the fundamental mechanism responsible for the electron localization in a random lattice ; as a consequence , analogous localization effects can take place in any phenomenon that involves propagation of waves in a disordered medium  @xcite .",
    "the same conceptual framework thus allows one to understand seemingly heterogeneous phenomena as the localization of water waves  @xcite , the coherent backscattering of photons  @xcite , and the universal conductance fluctuations typical of mesoscopic samples ( see , for instance , reference  @xcite ) .",
    "the basic one - dimensional ( 1d ) anderson model has proved to be a valuable tool to gain insight in the complex phenomenon of localization .",
    "the model is appealing because it is extremely simple and yet retains the capacity to provide a non - trivial description of the localization process .",
    "mathematically , the anderson model is defined by the tridiagonal hamiltonian @xmath0 \\label{andmod}\\ ] ] and disorder is introduced through the site energies @xmath1 which are supposed to be _ random _ and _ independent _ variables ( with an appropriate distribution ) .    in spite of its undiscussed usefulness ,",
    "the basic model  ( [ andmod ] ) can not account for many essential aspects of localization phenomena , such as the metal - insulator transition .",
    "the twofold reason of this shortcoming lies in the 1d nature of the system  ( [ andmod ] ) and in the statistical independence of the random site energies @xmath1 . as a consequence of these two key features , all eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian  ( [ andmod ] ) turn out to be _ localized _",
    ", even if the disorder is infinitesimally small .    the key role played by dimensionality in",
    "the localization processes led at first to the conclusion that only a 3d generalization of the anderson model  ( [ andmod ] ) could reproduce such basic characteristics of disordered solids as the existence of mobility edges or the metal - insulator transition .",
    "the progress in the investigation of 1d systems , however , eventually led to the realization that such models can exhibit a richer behaviour than it was previously thought .",
    "in fact , it was discovered that even in one - dimensional lattices there are classes of random potentials which allow for _ extended _ states ( see , e.  g. , reference  @xcite ) . in all these 1d systems",
    "the disorder exhibits spatial correlations , in contrast to the totally uncorrelated potential of the standard anderson model .",
    "a significant example of a system where the correlations of the site potential can produce delocalized states is given by the so - called ` random dimer ' , which is characterized by a peculiar form of short - range correlations of the potential  @xcite .",
    "the analysis of models with correlated disorder revived the interest in 1d chains and revealed the essential role of correlations .",
    "one must observe , however , that the short - range correlations of the random dimer and similar systems can give rise at best to a _",
    "discrete _ set of extended quantum states : in other words , the localization length diverges only for discrete values of the energy .",
    "the situation may change when long - range correlations come into play , as it was recently discovered in  @xcite , where the general case of diagonal disorder with arbitrary correlations was considered and a direct relation between the localization length and the potential pair correlators was established . using this relation it",
    "was shown how to reconstruct a site - potential giving rise to any given form of energy dependence of the localization length  @xcite .",
    "a particular conclusion is that even 1d random lattices can possess a _",
    "continuum _ of extended states ( and mobility edges ) , provided the disorder exhibits appropriate long - range correlations .    in the present work",
    "we follow an approach similar to that of reference  @xcite by extending the study to a general case of 1d anderson model with any kind of diagonal disorder and off - diagonal nearest - neighbour interaction .",
    "this work is organized as follows .",
    "the rest of the introduction is devoted to the definition of the model under study . in section  [ wcd ]",
    "we analyse the case in which the site - energies and the site - dependent part of the hopping amplitudes are small .",
    "although we focus our discussion on the case of random site- and hopping energies , the validity of our results extends to any non - random case as well . in section  [ sud ]",
    "we consider the case of strong and uncorrelated disorder , deriving an approximate expression for the localization length and comparing it with the numerical data . in section  [ dwsrc ]",
    "we investigate the case ( reminiscent of the random dimer model ) in which the disorder ( both diagonal and off - diagonal ) has arbitrary intensity and exhibits peculiar short - range correlations .",
    "the concluding remarks are exposed in section  [ cr ] .",
    "we study the localization properties of the following one - dimensional tight - binding hamiltonian @xmath2 \\label{ham}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the site energies @xmath1 and the off - diagonal elements @xmath3 are arbitrary real variables . from the physical point of view , the hamiltonian  ( [ ham ] )",
    "describes an ` electron ' moving in a discrete 1d lattice .",
    "the energies @xmath1 measure the strength of the bond of the electron to the ` atoms ' of the chain , while the hopping terms @xmath3 represent the probability amplitudes for an electron localized in a single site to jump to the nearest atoms to the right or to the left .",
    "notice that in our model the transition amplitudes @xmath4 depend only on the initial state of the electron and not on the final one .",
    "this physical feature is connected to the non - hermitian character of the operator  ( [ ham ] ) . with regard to this point",
    ", we stress that , although the operator  ( [ ham ] ) is not hermitian , its eigenvalues are real : this allows one to consider it as a physically sound hamiltonian .    in order to show that the eigenvalues of @xmath5 are real , let @xmath6 be an eigenvalue of the operator  ( [ ham ] ) and @xmath7 the corresponding eigenvector @xmath8",
    "let us now consider the operator @xmath9 , i.e. the transpose of @xmath5 and let us denote with @xmath10 the eigenvector of @xmath9 to the eigenvalue @xmath6 , so that one has @xmath11 notice that if @xmath6 belongs to the spectrum of @xmath5 , then the same value is also an eigenvalue of @xmath9 , since a matrix and its transpose share the same spectrum .",
    "multiplying equation  ( [ dim2 ] ) by @xmath12 one can obtain @xmath13 where we have used equation  ( [ dim1 ] ) and the fact that @xmath5 is a real matrix ( and therefore its transpose coincides with its adjoint ) .",
    "equation  ( [ dim3 ] ) implies that @xmath14 , unless one has @xmath15 .",
    "one can rule this last possibility out , however , due to the specific structure of the operator  ( [ ham ] ) .",
    "indeed , for the hamiltonian  ( [ ham ] ) one has that @xmath16 where @xmath17 .",
    "relation  ( [ dim4 ] ) between @xmath5 and @xmath9 implies that @xmath18 , and this allows one to exclude the possibility that @xmath7 and @xmath19 are orthogonal .",
    "this leads to the conclusion that @xmath14 , i.e. that the hamiltonian  ( [ ham ] ) has real eigenvalues .",
    "below , we consider the stationary schrdinger equation @xmath20 , with eigenvectors @xmath21 using the explicit form  ( [ ham ] ) of the hamiltonian , one can easily see that the schrdinger equation for the amplitudes @xmath22 takes the form @xmath23 it is convenient to introduce the new variables @xmath24 and @xmath25 so that equation  ( [ schr1 ] ) can be cast in the simpler form @xmath26 the introduction of the amplitudes  ( [ phi ] ) and of the site - energies  ( [ xi ] ) thus formally allows one to reduce the problem of determining the eigenstates of model  ( [ ham ] ) to the equivalent problem of studying the zero - energy eigenstate of the tridiagonal model  ( [ schr2 ] ) with diagonal - only disorder . according to this interpretation , for any energy value @xmath6 in the original schrdinger equation",
    "there is a corresponding realization @xmath27 in  ( [ schr2 ] ) .",
    "having thus defined our problem , we proceed to solve it for three distinct physical cases : the limiting case of weak disorder ( with arbitrary correlations ) , the opposite case of strong ( uncorrelated ) disorder and the case of disorder of arbitrary strength with short - range correlations ( ` @xmath28-mer model ' ) . in the following",
    ", we will consider off - diagonal terms of the form @xmath29 the reason for representing the energies @xmath3 in the form  ( [ gamma ] ) is that in this way we separate two physically distinct contributions to the off - diagonal matrix elements : the first one originates from the kinetic energy term of the hamiltonian , while the second one , @xmath30 , represents the fluctuating part of the interaction between nearest neighbours .",
    "the latter contribution is the source of randomness for the hopping energies @xmath3 of our model  ( [ ham ] ) .",
    "in this section we consider the general case of _ weak _ disorder : @xmath31 for _ any _ kind of site - energies @xmath1 and interaction @xmath30 .",
    "notice that , since the randomness of the hopping terms @xmath3 comes only from the interaction energies @xmath30 , the condition of weak disorder for the off - diagonal terms is given by the first of the relations  ( [ small ] ) ( and not by the condition @xmath32 ) . under the conditions  ( [ small ]",
    ") one has @xmath33 so that equation  ( [ schr2 ] ) can be approximated by @xmath34      an effective way  @xcite to study the quantum model  ( [ schr3 ] ) consists in representing it in terms of the classical two - dimensional hamiltonian map @xmath35 with @xmath36 and @xmath37 the map  ( [ map ] ) describes the behaviour of a harmonic oscillator subjected to periodic delta kicks of amplitude @xmath38 .",
    "the map can in fact be derived by integrating over a period @xmath39 the equations of motion of the kicked oscillator defined by the hamiltonian @xmath40    the complete equivalence of the quantum system  ( [ schr3 ] ) with the classical one defined by the map  ( [ map ] ) can be easily proved by eliminating the @xmath41 variable from equations  ( [ map ] ) . in this way , one obtains the relation @xmath42 which coincides with equation  ( [ schr3 ] ) if one identifies the variable @xmath43 with the site amplitude @xmath44 and if the parameters of the quantum model  ( [ schr3 ] ) and those of the classical map  ( [ map ] ) are related by the equations  ( [ energy ] ) and  ( [ hit ] ) .",
    "therefore it becomes possible to analyse the solutions of equation  ( [ schr3 ] ) in terms of ` trajectories ' in the phase - space of the map  ( [ map ] ) .",
    "in such an approach , localized quantum states correspond to unbounded trajectories in the classical phase - space , while extended quantum states are represented by bounded trajectories ( see details in  @xcite ) .",
    "it is convenient to express the map  ( [ map ] ) in polar coordinates @xmath45 introduced via standard relations @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the substitution in equation  ( [ map ] ) gives @xmath48   \\\\",

    "we define the noise - angle @xmath59 and the noise - noise @xmath60 correlators as follows , @xmath61 and @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the ` noise'-variance @xmath64 the terms  ( [ nacorr ] ) measure the ` temporal ' correlations of the noise @xmath38 with the angle variable @xmath65 , while equation  ( [ nncorr ] ) defines the normalized autocorrelation function for the noise variable  ( [ hit ] ) . notice that , since the noise strength  ( [ hit ] ) is a function both of random terms @xmath30 and @xmath1 and of the energy @xmath66 , the noise - noise correlator  ( [ nncorr ] ) depends on the energy @xmath6 as well as on the ( spatial ) correlators of the random variables @xmath1 and @xmath30 .    from the definitions  ( [ nacorr ] ) , ( [ nncorr ] ) it follows that",
    "@xmath67 as in reference  @xcite it can be shown that the correlators @xmath59 satisfy the relations @xmath68 which in turn imply that @xmath69 substituting  ( [ rel2 ] ) into  ( [ rel1 ] ) , one can write @xmath70 so that the lyapunov exponent  ( [ lyap3 ] ) takes the form @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 while the parameter @xmath74 is related to the energy @xmath6 through equation  ( [ energy ] ) .      expression  ( [ lyap4 ] ) , together with equations  ( [ notcorr ] ) and  ( [ normlyap ] ) , gives the localization length as a function of the energy and of the diagonal and off - diagonal potential correlators .",
    "notice that this is a very general result , because its validity rests exclusively on the weak disorder assumption  ( [ small ] ) and does _ not _ depend on the particular form of the variables @xmath1 and @xmath30 .",
    "equation  ( [ lyap4 ] ) can therefore be applied to a broad variety of specific problems .",
    "a simple examination of formula  ( [ lyap4 ] ) also reveals that the inverse localization length @xmath51 is the product of two factors , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , defined respectively by equation  ( [ notcorr ] ) and  ( [ normlyap ] ) .",
    "this factorization is physically meaningful , because @xmath75 represents the lyapunov exponent for the case of totally uncorrelated disorder ( i.e. when @xmath77 for @xmath78 ) , while the function @xmath76 describes the correction introduced by the spatial correlations both in diagonal and off - diagonal terms .",
    "let us now analyse separately the two factors  ( [ notcorr ] ) and  ( [ normlyap ] ) . as was indicated , the first one gives the inverse localization length when no correlations exist among the matrix elements of the hamiltonian  ( [ ham ] ) .",
    "this system corresponds to a simple generalization of the anderson model , in which not only the site energies but also nearest - neighbour hopping energies are independent random variables . from this point of view ,",
    "the expression  ( [ notcorr ] ) can be seen as an extension of the known formula for the standard anderson model , @xmath79 indeed the inverse localization length  ( [ notcorr ] ) reduces to this form if one assumes that there is no off - diagonal disorder ( i.e. @xmath80 and @xmath81 ) and that the variance of the site energies is the one fixed by the anderson distribution ( i.e. @xmath82 ) .",
    "expression  ( [ notcorr ] ) , however , also shows that the introduction of off - diagonal randomness modifies in a non - trivial way the energy dependence of the lyapunov exponent with respect to the standard diagonal case . in particular , extended states can arise for specific values of the energy : if , for instance , the diagonal and off - diagonal disorder are identical ( @xmath83 ) , the localization length diverges for @xmath84 .",
    "we discuss this feature in more detail in the next subsection .",
    "the factor  ( [ normlyap ] ) accounts for the modifications generated by the correlations both in the diagonal and off - diagonal terms .",
    "one should stress that this factor depends both on the correlations and energy .",
    "this is a key feature , because it implies that , as an effect of the correlations , the sample can become more or less transparent for specific values of the energy . as can be seen from equation  ( [ lyap4 ] ) ,",
    "if @xmath85 , the lyapunov exponent is increased with respect to the uncorrelated case , meaning that correlations make the sample more opaque . on the contrary , when @xmath86 , the chain becomes more transparent .",
    "thus , if the function  ( [ normlyap ] ) goes to zero in a certain energy range , the states of the system will be extended inside that region and localized outside of it : this shows how mobility edges can arise even in 1d systems , provided that the potential has the proper correlations .",
    "once the statistical properties of the potential are known , formulae  ( [ lyap4 ] ) , ( [ notcorr ] ) and  ( [ normlyap ] ) exactly determine the lyapunov exponent as a function of the energy .",
    "they can be used , however , also to solve the inverse problem , i.e. to specify what the correlations of the disorder must be for the lyapunov exponent to exhibit a given energy dependence .",
    "this is a problem of practical interest because of the relevance of its potential technological applications : knowing what particular disorder generates a specific energy dependence of the lyapunov exponent might lead to the construction of superlattices with the required transport properties .",
    "let us now write explicit relations between statistical properties of the disorder and the lyapunov exponent for the case when the diagonal disorder is independent from the off - diagonal one ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "for this we write the function @xmath76 in fourier series , @xmath88 where the expansion coefficients are defined by the relation @xmath89 inserting  ( [ fourser ] ) and  ( [ nncorr ] ) in equation  ( [ normlyap ] ) one obtains the relations @xmath90 which constitute the explicit link between the fourier components of @xmath76 and the disorder correlators @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "once the lyapunov exponent ( and hence the factor @xmath93 ) is known , the relations  ( [ invers ] ) set a constraint on the statistical properties of @xmath1 and @xmath30 .",
    "notice that , in contrast to the purely diagonal case discussed in  @xcite , here the interplay of diagonal and off - diagonal disorder does not allow a complete specification of the correlators from the knowledge of the localization length .",
    "the relations  ( [ invers ] ) admit a particularly simple solution for the case in which the diagonal and off - diagonal disorder are statistically independent ( i.e. @xmath94 ) , but share the same statistical properties ( so that their autocorrelation functions are equal : @xmath95 ) . in this peculiar case , the relations  ( [ invers ] ) _",
    "do _ determine the disorder correlators : indeed , one has @xmath96 this result can be understood from the observation that in this special case the noise - noise correlators  ( [ nncorr ] ) take the form @xmath97 and no longer depend on the energy , so that they can be interpreted as fourier coefficients of the series  ( [ normlyap ] ) .",
    "we checked numerically the validity of  ( [ lyap4 ] ) using the classical map approach for the computation of the lyapunov exponent .",
    "we consider the map @xmath98 with @xmath99 which is exactly equivalent to the original schrdinger equation  ( [ schr1 ] ) , provided the parameters @xmath6 and @xmath38 of the matrix  ( [ mapmatrix ] ) are defined by the relations  ( [ energy ] ) and  ( [ hit ] ) .",
    "this means that , if  ( [ energy ] ) and  ( [ hit ] ) are fulfilled , then the values of the @xmath100 coordinate at the time steps @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 obey the same relation expressed by  ( [ schr1 ] ) for the probability amplitudes @xmath22 .",
    "it should be pointed out that the determinant of the single time - step map  ( [ mapmatrix ] ) is not unitary , @xmath104 and , therefore , the determinant oscillates around the unit value as a function of @xmath102 .",
    "this does not mean , however , that the map  ( [ map2 ] ) does not conserve the total flux . indeed , the disordered sample represented by the hamiltonian  ( [ ham ] ) can not actually be infinite ; therefore some kind of boundary conditions have to be imposed .",
    "a typical boundary condition is the periodic one : in this case one assumes that the disordered sample is a closed chain made up of @xmath28 ` atoms ' so that the site- and hopping - energies obey the equations : @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "consequently , one has @xmath107 so that the total determinant across the sample is exactly equal to one .",
    "a more physical boundary condition arises if the disordered sample is embedded between two perfect leads .",
    "this physical condition translates in the mathematical requirements @xmath108 and @xmath109 for @xmath110 or @xmath111 , which , in turn , lead again to the condition  ( [ totdet ] ) for the total determinant of the map through the whole sample .",
    "let us now see how the map  ( [ map2 ] ) can be effectively used for the computation of the lyapunov exponent . as was shown above , it is convenient to introduce the polar coordinates @xmath112 and @xmath113 and cast the map  ( [ map2 ] ) in the form @xmath114 \\\\",

    "more precisely , we consider the model defined by assuming that the couples of random variables @xmath176 in the schrdinger equation  ( [ schr1 ] ) fulfill the following conditions :    1 .",
    "the energies @xmath177 can take only two values : @xmath178 or @xmath179 .",
    "2 .   in every succession",
    "@xmath180 the values @xmath181 and @xmath182 appear in @xmath28-uples made of @xmath28 consecutive identical terms .",
    "the @xmath28-uples @xmath183 and @xmath184 appear at random with equal frequency along the succession @xmath180 .    if @xmath185 , the pairs @xmath186 and @xmath187 are called dimers ; for @xmath188 the corresponding triplets are named trimers , while for generic @xmath28 one speaks of ` @xmath28-mers ' .    making use of the amplitudes  ( [ phi ] ) and the energies  ( [ xi ] ) as in the previous cases , one can write the schrdinger equation  ( [ schr1 ] ) in the form  ( [ schr2 ] ) where the diagonal energies  ( [ xi ] ) now take two values @xmath189 and appear in equiprobable @xmath28-uples randomly positioned along the succession @xmath190 . in other words , the model  ( [ ham ] ) , with both diagonal and off - diagonal disorder specified by the preceding 1 ) , 2 ) , and 3 )",
    "conditions , can be associated with the @xmath28-mer model already studied in the literature ( see  @xcite and references quoted therein ) .    as in reference  @xcite",
    ", we can use the equivalence of the model  ( [ schr2 ] ) with the map  ( [ map3 ] ) and study the solutions of the schrdinger equation  ( [ schr2 ] ) in terms of the trajectories of the map  ( [ map3 ] ) . with this interpretation in mind",
    ", we can address the problem of extended states for the model  ( [ schr2 ] ) by considering a single @xmath28-mer of type @xmath181 embedded in an infinite chain of @xmath182 @xmath28-mers .",
    "in this case the orbits of the map  ( [ map3 ] ) are not affected by the single @xmath181 @xmath28-mer provided that the total transfer matrix through the @xmath28-mer is equal to the identity matrix ( apart from a plus / minus factor ) . in other words",
    ", one must have @xmath191 where @xmath192 is the transfer matrix  ( [ transfer ] ) ( with @xmath193 ) and @xmath194 is the unit matrix .",
    "the ` transparency ' condition  ( [ transp ] ) can be satisfied provided that the stability condition @xmath195 for the map  ( [ map3 ] ) is fulfilled . in this case",
    "the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath196 have the form @xmath197 ( with @xmath198 ) and the equation  ( [ transp ] ) is equivalent to @xmath199 which in turn leads to @xmath200 with @xmath156 integer . on the other hand , the stability condition @xmath195 requires to discard the @xmath156 values @xmath201 with @xmath202 integer . using  ( [ xipm ] ) and the relation @xmath203 , we come to the conclusion that the @xmath28-mer is transparent for the following energy values @xmath204 with @xmath205 .",
    "the study of the single @xmath28-mer case allows one to understand that , in the general case of a chain where @xmath28-mers of type @xmath181 and @xmath182 randomly alternate , the model  ( [ ham ] ) with disorder correlated by @xmath28-uples has extended states when the energy takes the values @xmath206 where @xmath207 . in the particular case",
    "when the diagonal and off - diagonal disorder are related by the linear equation @xmath208 , one should add the special value @xmath120 to the list  ( [ enetra ] ) , because in this case the variables  ( [ xipm ] ) take the single value @xmath209 and disorder disappears from equation  ( [ schr2 ] ) .",
    "the theoretical prediction  ( [ enetra ] ) was checked by numerically computing the lyapunov exponent for the system  ( [ ham ] ) with dimer- and trimer - correlated disorder as a function of the energy .",
    "numerical experiments have confirmed the validity of formula  ( [ enetra ] ) , specifically , the lyapunov exponent vanishes whenever the energy takes one of the values  ( [ enetra ] ) , see figs .  [ dimer ] ,  [ trimer ] .",
    "in this paper we have studied the 1d tight - binding model described by the hamiltonian  ( [ ham ] ) which has both diagonal and off - diagonal variable matrix elements .",
    "the main object of this study is the analysis of the localization length and its dependence on underlying correlations in the diagonal and off - diagonal potential . by making use of the reduction of the quantum model to a proper classical hamiltonian map ,",
    "we have considered a few most interesting cases of the interplay between diagonal and off - diagonal correlated disorder .",
    "the first case which has been analysed in details is the model with a weak site - potential and a weak fluctuating part in the off - diagonal matrix elements . in this case",
    "we have derived a general analytical expression for the localization length valid for any kind of randomness in the potential .",
    "more specifically , the localization length is expressed in terms of pair correlators for the diagonal and off - diagonal matrix elements . using this expression",
    ", one can consider any kind of correlated disorder , as well as deterministic potential and hopping off - diagonal amplitudes .",
    "the expression obtained for the localization length allows to reveal how this latter quantity is influenced by pair correlations .",
    "a few specific cases of correlated disorder have been discussed to illustrate the role of the correlations .",
    "one of the most interesting results is that if the diagonal and off - diagonal disorder are proportional to each other , there is a specific value of the energy for which the eigenstates are extended . for finite sample , therefore , there is a region where all states are fully transparent as in the dimer models with short - range correlations .",
    "another case studied in this paper is that of strong disorder ( both diagonal and off - diagonal ) . in this case",
    "we have been able to obtain an approximate analytical expression for the localization length which shows that , when lattice randomness increases , localization effects weaken .",
    "this feature contrasts with the behaviour of the standard 1d anderson model ( with only diagonal disorder ) and is a non - trivial consequence of the interaction of the site - potential with the off - diagonal hopping energies .",
    "very recently @xcite an analytical expression for the invariant density @xmath210 in the strong disorder case has been obtained in a different context .",
    "finally we have examined the case of disorder with short - range correlation , focusing our attention on the specific @xmath28-mer model , where disorder correlations are introduced by assigning the same value of the site- and hopping - energies to @xmath28 consecutive chain sites . for this case",
    "we have showed how correlations give rise to a discrete set of extended states .",
