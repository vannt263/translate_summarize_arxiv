    "studies on the breakdown of symmetries and their restorations have been very useful in the analysis of phenomena related to phase transitions .",
    "such studies applied to _ quantum chromodynamics _ ( qcd ) are particularly fascinating since qcd owns a very complicated phase structure . among them ,",
    "the ( partial ) restoration of chiral symmetry at finite temperature ( @xmath4 ) and/or quark chemical density ( @xmath17 ) has been one of the most interesting and stimulating subjects for decades .",
    "a great number of theoretical and experimental endeavors have been devoted to this subject .",
    "in particular , the high-@xmath4 and low-@xmath17 region , which resembles the early universe , shows a very noble feature of the restoration pattern .",
    "namely there is a crossover phase transition for the nonzero current - quark mass ( @xmath18 ) and that of the second - order for @xmath19 .",
    "these distinctive patterns of the phase transition are consistent with the universal - class argument of the three - dimensional ising model  @xcite , and turns out to be highly nontrivial in qcd  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the critical endpoint ( cep )  @xcite , tri - critical point ( tcp )  @xcite , the critical chiral phase transition on the @xmath4-@xmath17 plane have been also attracting much interest .",
    "recently , together with the energetic progress for the heavy - ion - collision ( hic ) experiment facilities , such as the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) and large hadron collider ( lhc ) , one can now probe hot and dense qcd matters , i.e. _ quark - gluon plasma _ ( qgp ) , experimentally .",
    "it has been reported that very strong magnetic field in the order of the several times of @xmath20 $ ] can be produced in the noncentral ( peripheral ) heavy - ion collision ( hic ) experiment by star collaboration at rhic  @xcite . according to this strong magnetic field and @xmath21-violating domains created inside the qgp , signals for possible @xmath22 and @xmath21 violations",
    "were observed as the charge separation along the direction of the external magnetic field , which is perpendicular to the collision plane .",
    "theoretically , this phenomenon is nothing but the axial anomaly of electromagnetic currents  @xcite .",

    "@xcite , in which related works and references can be found . actually even before this sort of studies receiving much more interest recently due to the energetic progress of the hic physics , qcd under magnetic field had been an important subject  @xcite .",

    "@xcite , it is a useful nonperturbatve method to study qcd matter at finite @xmath4 . to include the external magnetic field ,",
    "we make use of the linear schwinger method  @xcite . besides we also take into account the meson - loop corrections ( mlc ) for the su(2 ) light - flavor sector as the large-@xmath24 corrections .",
    "mlc is essential to reproduce the correct current - quark mass dependence of relevant physical quantities  @xcite and universal - class chiral restoration pattern at finite @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "our numerical results show that the chiral order parameters , such as the constituent - quark mass and chiral condensate , are enhanced with respect to @xmath13 due to the magnetic catalysis effect .",
    "there is a region where the @xmath8- and @xmath9-quark constituent masses coincide at @xmath10 , even for the explicit isospin - symmetry breaking , i.e. @xmath25 . the critical @xmath4 for the chiral restoration , @xmath12 tends to be shifted higher pronouncedly in the presence of the @xmath13 in the chiral limit . on the contrary",
    "@xmath26 keeps almost stationary for the physical quark mass case .",
    "the strength of the isospin breaking between the @xmath8 and @xmath9 quark condensates is also explored in detail by defining the ratio @xmath14 as a function of @xmath4 and @xmath13 . finally , we compute the pion weak - decay constant @xmath15 and pion mass @xmath16 below @xmath12 as functions of @xmath4 and @xmath13 , showing correct partial chiral restoration behaviors .",
    "our result also shows the changes of the @xmath15 and @xmath16 due to the magnetic field , are relatively small in comparison to those caused by the finite @xmath4 effect .",
    "the present work is structured as follows : in section ii , we make a brief introduction of the basic instanton - liquid model at vacuum without mlc and explain typical procedures to compute relevant quantities for further discussions . in section iii , we consider the inclusion of the mlc and the external magnetic field .",
    "the @xmath4-dependent modification of the instanton parameters using the harrington - shepard caloron is given in section iv .",

    "breaking , there appears a point at which the constituent quark masses for the @xmath8 and @xmath9 quarks coincide each other for the strong magnetic field @xmath153 g. in the chiral limit , we observe the second - order chiral phase transition , as expected from the universal restoration pattern , effected much by the meson - loop corrections .",
    "naturally , the crossover phase transition takes place for the physical quark masses . *",
    "the effects from the magnetic catalysis becomes more pronounced in the higher @xmath4 region because as @xmath4 increases the sb@xmath6s effects generated from the instanton is weakened so that the magnetic catalysis effects becomes relatively more important .",
    "the critical @xmath4 , i.e. @xmath12 is shifted to higher @xmath4 due to the magnetic catalysis , whereas the change of the chiral condensate values is relatively small .",
    "@xmath26 becomes flavor - dependent because the magnetic catalysis effect depends on the electric charge of the quarks .",
    "* the isospin breaking between the quark condensates is explored by defining the ratio @xmath108 as a function of @xmath4 . as for @xmath154 case",
    "the ratio is zero at @xmath155 and monotonically increases with respect to @xmath4 for the finite magnetic field . for the physical quark mass case ,",
    "the ratio @xmath108 shows nontrivial structures with respect to @xmath4 and @xmath7 due to the complicated competition between the magnetic catalysis and the explicitly isospin breaking effect which becomes more important at higher t because of the decreasing nonperturbative effects .",
    "* according to our simple and qualitative analysis using the gor relation , we observe correct partial chiral - restoration and magnetic - catalysis behaviors for the pion - weak decay constant @xmath15 and pion mass @xmath16 .",
    "they decreases and increases about @xmath156 at @xmath157 mev in comparison to those at @xmath143 , respectively .",
    "however , the changes due to the magnetic field are relatively small , just a few percent .",
    "now we obtain an effective chiral action at finite @xmath4 as well as the magnetic field for the physical quark mass .",
    "if the strong magnetic field is created in the peripheral heavy - ion collisions as reported , it is worthy of studying the hadronization processes in the presence of the magnetic field , i.e. the dilepton production via the vector - meson dominance under the magnetic field for instance .",
    "moreover , the qcd phase diagram on the @xmath17-@xmath4 plane and critical values , such as the critical end point ( cep ) and tricritical point ( tcp ) , are also able to be explored in our model in principle .",
    "inclusion of finite @xmath17 to the effective action in the instanton framework is under progress and related works will appear elsewhere .",
