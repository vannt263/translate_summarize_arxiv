    "extensive observational and theoretical efforts have been made in order to explain intraday variability ( idv ) in some classes of active galactic nuclei ( agn )  @xcite .",
    "idv manifests as the fast change ( in less than one day ) in the luminosity output of an object , and for supermassive black holes idv occurs in the optical domain .",
    "the power spectral distribution ( psd ) of these light curves are found to be nontrivial  @xcite .",
    "a large percentage of agn evolve so as to produce idv in the optical with psd for which the spectral slope @xmath3 is neither @xmath4 nor @xmath5 , as shown by structure function analysis  @xcite , fractal dimension analysis @xcite and discrete fourier transform analysis  @xcite .",
    "these types of analyses lead to the conclusion that the disk is perturbed by a stochastic noise ; further discussion on this topic can be found in , e.g. , @xcite which find no convincing case of periodicity in lcs for a 9000 quasar sample and state that these type of oscillations are entirely expected from coloured noise processes ; @xcite conclude , in a discussion of optical idv in bl lacs that idv is essentially a stochastic process ; @xcite state that it is unlikely that the observed quasar variability is caused by a coherently varying accretion disk .    for bl lac s5 0716 + 714 the spectral slope was found to vary from @xmath6 to @xmath7 for the idv data set discussed in  @xcite and  @xcite , from @xmath8 to @xmath9 for the data set discussed in  @xcite , from @xmath10 to @xmath11 in the data set discussed in  @xcite and from @xmath8 to @xmath12 in the data set discussed in  @xcite .",
    "we start from the assumption that the source of idv is placed within a geometrically thin , optically thick disk .",
    "an equilibrium rotating accretion disk in the mhd framework is perturbed ( section  [ sect : perturbation ] ) by a fractional brownian motion ( fbm ) process in density .",
    "the mhd equations are solved to obtain the perturbed variables needed to compute the reynolds - maxwell stress tensor component responsible for the emitted luminosity .",
    "the luminosity is calculated by integrating this stress component over a radius between @xmath13 $ ] gravitational radii .",
    "although in a non - complicated approach , this work aims to advance the study in this area by using a fractional process as a perturbation , superimposed on a magnetized medium . as it is shown in the body of the paper ( section  [ sect : config2 ] ) , an equilibrium deterministic magnetic field acquires a stochastic component following such a perturbation .    in the conclusions ( section  [ sect : conclusions ] )",
    "we review the signature of the input fbm on the output luminosity and its connections to observed light curves .",
    "the initial configuration consists of a geometrically thin , optically thick rotating magnetized disk . by assumption",
    "the disk is non - viscous .",
    "the fundamental equations for accretion disk structure ( e.g. equation set 6 from  @xcite ) are the continuity equation    @xmath14    the equation of motion for a magnetized plasma element    @xmath15    the induction equation    @xmath16    and the zero - divergence condition imposed on the magnetic field    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the volume density , @xmath19 is the velocity of the plasma element , @xmath20 is the hydrostatic pressure in the disk , @xmath21 is the gravitational potential due to the central source and @xmath22 is the magnetic field permeating the disk .",
    "also , we use the assumption that the plasma in the disk is an ideal gas in the sense that the equation    @xmath23    is valid , where @xmath24 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath25 is the mean molecular weight , @xmath26 is the proton mass and @xmath27 is the temperature .",
    "the equilibrium disk is well described by a time steady cylindrical symmetry @xmath28 , such that @xmath29 .",
    "the disk structure may be characterized by a central temperature depending only on @xmath30 and the dependence on the @xmath31 coordinate may be neglected  @xcite . as a feature of the standard thin disk assumption ,",
    "all the quantities should be considered as averages over height .",
    "the gravitational potential outside the event horizon of the super massive black hole is described by the newtonian potential @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the gravitational constant and @xmath34 is the mass of the black hole . a test plasma volume in a keplerian disk experiences a velocity equal to the kepler velocity @xmath35 , and an angular velocity equal to the kepler angular velocity @xmath36 .",
    "the equilibrium magnetic field is set up to have a zero radial component .",
    "observations place the value of the magnetic field in the disk around the modest value of @xmath37 t  @xcite .",
    "the numerical values chosen for the boundary parameters do no necessarily satisfy the zero - torque boundary condition on the inner orbit .",
    "historically , the stress on the most inner orbit of the disk was considered to be zero but recent discussions on this topic have led to the conclusion that this assumption must be relaxed .",
    "for example , in recent work , @xcite numerically investigate a disk by taking into account general relativistic effects , non - zero torque at the boundary and find that the radiation returning from the inner area ( which was previously decoupled from the disk because of the no - torque boundary condition ) causes various annuli in the disk to `` communicate '' on the light crossing timescale .",
    "communication on this timescale is a feature needed by any model trying to explain idv , because observational data show that if the source of idv is in the disk , it needs to propagate on these timescales  @xcite .",
    "similar to the standard disk model  @xcite , the height averaged equilibrium density as @xmath38 with @xmath39 and the equilibrium temperature is taken as @xmath40 .",
    "this is justified based on the self similarity property of the disk solutions  @xcite and on a set of observations . for example , the optical / uv continuum of ngc 7469 corresponds with the prediction for a @xmath41  @xcite .",
    "@xcite reports on a set of observations where the observed optical - uv spectral energy distribution ( sed ) implies a temperature @xmath42 , independent of the thickness of the disk .",
    "simple black body disk models around super - massive black holes have @xmath43 less than @xmath44k and the uv and optical continuum emitting region is placed in the region between @xmath45  @xcite , where @xmath46 is the gravitational radius @xmath47 . for a central mass of @xmath48 , the accretion flow region responsible for the observed optical / uv spectrum",
    "is @xmath49  @xcite and @xmath50 is a characteristic temperature within about @xmath51  @xcite .",
    "based on these arguments , the numerical values of the parameters used throughout this analysis ( all expressed in si units ) are    * physical constants + @xmath52 * model assumptions + @xmath53    where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the outer and inner radii of the section of the disk considered to produce the optical radiation .",
    "the equilibrium state is perturbed by a prescribed temporal variation in the density . when the perturbation is applied , the new physical parameters that satisfy the mhd equations consist of a sum of two parts : the equilibrium part and the perturbed part .",
    "the perturbations are isothermal .",
    "this is not because we believe this is necessarily the case in an astrophysical disk .",
    "we make this assumption because in this toy model we want to study fluctuations in energy occurring at the same temperature , and not the distribution of energy in a large interval of temperatures .",
    "accretion is possible due to the outward angular momentum transport by a sum of reynolds and maxwell stresses  @xcite and we assume that the perturbations in this mechanism are responsible for the variability .",
    "the component of the stress tensor responsible for the luminosity is defined as    @xmath56    where @xmath57 are the perturbed components of the velocity and magnetic field .",
    "the luminosity emitted from a patch of the disk due to the perturbation , between radii @xmath58 and @xmath59 is  @xcite    @xmath60    and this equation is the starting point of producing the light curves shown in the results section of the paper .",
    "there is a general consensus that the underlying mechanism producing idv is stochastic  @xcite .",
    "the time dependency of the density perturbation is taken to be the realization of a stochastic process such that @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is a normalized fractional brownian motion ( fbm ) and @xmath63 is a constant amplitude , which will be prescribed by us .",
    "it is expected that locally fluctuating component of magnetic field create numerous current sheets inside the disk  @xcite , which can be used as random reconnection sites .",
    "the accretion disk can work as a dynamo amplifying the stochastic magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "this happens because even in a perfectly conducting plasma , turbulence develops through the magnetorotational instability ( mri )  @xcite .",
    "the already mentioned peculiar shape of the observational psd prompts us to consider that the perturbation is a signal with non - markovian properties .",
    "a sample light curve is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : idv ] .",
    "there is no constraint imposed to the value of @xmath64 in our framework mainly because there is a lack of observational data to correlate idv characteristics to characteristics of the central engine .",
    "for example , @xcite report , regarding the optical idv of s5 0716 + 714 , that there is no correlation between the source magnitude and the amplitude of the idv and that there is no clear correlation between the source magnitude and the rate of magnitude variation ; @xcite report that time scales of optical variability in bl lacs do not correlate with luminosity ; @xcite conclude that it can not be assumed that quasars with similar mass will necessarily have the same variability properties ; @xcite discuss optical data of a sample of bl lac and state that there are no dependencies of the time scales on intrinsic properties , redshift or absolute magnitude .",

    "observations show that optical light curves from bl lac s5 0716 + 714 although variable are not periodic , e.g. @xcite reports that optical observations never have constant duty - cycle ; also , @xcite found no periodicity during an observational campaign in march 2009 .",
    "the tables were populated by using the .r software  @xcite according to the assumption that the emission process behaves so as to produce a luminosity with psd @xmath128 .",
    "we impose this restriction because , as already discussed , many sets of observational data exhibit this behaviour .",
    "the second column in each table contains the value of the spectral slope @xmath3 and the first column contains the hurst parameter of the fbm perturbing the disk in that case .",
    "the errors associated to each @xmath3 stem from the fact that the slope is calculated with the .r software ; essentially , these errors come from mediating over many realizations of a process with the same characteristics .",
    "the third column contains the bayesian probability which assesses the correctness of the assumption , i.e. if @xmath129 is close to @xmath130 , than the assumption is correct . for details about the technical procedure ,",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "we would consider our model to be at least moderately successful if it would reproduce non - trivial values for @xmath3 with high values of bayesian probability . a careful analysis of tables  [ tab : c1b100 - 5 - 20]-[tab : c2b1000 - 5 - 100 ] shows that this is indeed the case ; a bold type letter was used to mark the most promising results .",
    "there is one subtle issue that still needs to be discussed , namely what happens to the radiation after the local emission .",
    "the mathematics used so far assumed , according to the standard model , that the produced radiation comes from a height averaged quantity ; lets call this the `` observed '' radiation .",
    "however , from its production spot in the disk and before leaving the body of the disk , the local radiation goes through diffusion in the thickness ( albeit small ) of the disk .",
    "so the local radiation , upon diffusion , becomes the observed radiation .",
    "there would appear to be an inconsistency in our treatment : we use tools to obtain the observed radiation ( height averaged equations ) but use local perturbation ( the fbm ) .",
    "this apparent inconsistency can be dealt with by providing an answer to the question : are statistical properties of the distribution of isothermal photons ( which are responsible for the local radiation ) changed if they are subjected to unbiased random walk ( diffusion through the body of the disk ) ?",
    "recall that our aim is to offer a possible explanation of the psd of the observed light curves . since unbiased random walk through a medium can not influence temporal correlation of otherwise identical ( same temperature ) photons , we will use the term `` observed '' radiation for our results .",
    "comparison with the statistical properties of observational data for a bl lac , e.g. analysed in @xcite , is good .    regarding the connection between @xmath3 and @xmath64 in the space parameter of the two different configurations , the plasma @xmath116 and different radial extents of the simulated disk , we produced plots @xmath131 with varying radial extent ( figs .",
    "[ fig : ha-1 ] - [ fig : ha-4 ] ) .",
    "it does not seem that extending the disk produces significant changes in the shape of the relationship . as expected , the dependency is not linear .",
    "in fact , it can be seen from the plots that @xmath131 reaches a plateau , with a different value for each of the configurations considered .",
    "however , these results should be taken with caution as the points in the plots do not all have equal bayesian probability ( the @xmath129 from the tables is different ) .",
    "the appearance of a perturbed magnetized accretion disk was investigated for the realistic case of a stochastic density perturbation , the output was investigated as a function of the hurst parameter of the input signal .",
    "two possible configurations of an initial magnetic field were considered .",
    "the most important result is the set of values obtained for the spectral slope and the corresponding bayesian probabilities ( @xmath3 and @xmath129 , shown in tables  [ tab : c1b100 - 5 - 20]-[tab : c2b1000 - 5 - 100 ] ) .",
    "the simulated curves are found to reproduce the psd characteristics of observed idv data .",
    "although left with important things to fine - tune , this toy model may turn out to be very useful in explaining idv .",
    "future research in this area would benefit from focusing on finding a physics - based analytical bijective relation between input perturbation and produced light curves .",
