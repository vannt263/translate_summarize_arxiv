    "the slow group velocity enhances scattering to create the scattering sites and also increases the effective cavity length between sites , narrowing the resonance line - width .",

    "this theory is computationally efficient , making the analysis of very long waveguides ( thousands of periods using the full three - dimensional structure ) feasible on a desktop computer .",
    "although the presented model may not be quantitatively exact ( e.g. , it neglects local field effects ) , the qualitative results such as the formation of sharp resonances near the band edge certainly can , and already have been , used to explain a rich range of experimental features without introducing any fitting parameters @xcite .",
