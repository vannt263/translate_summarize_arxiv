    "the quantum states of a particle in a periodic potential plus homogeneous field ( known nowadays as the wannier - stark states , ws - states in what follows ) are one of the long - standing problems of single - particle quantum mechanics .",
    "the beginning of the study of this problem dates back to the paper by bloch of 1929 , followed by contributions of zener , landau , wannier , zak and many others @xcite . in the late eighties",
    "the problem got a new impact by the invention of semiconductor superlattices .",
    "the unambiguous observation of the ws - spectrum in a semiconductor superlattice @xcite ended a long theoretical debate about the nature of ws - states , and now it is commonly accepted that they are the _ resonance states _ of the system .",
    "besides , ws - states were recently studied in a system of cold atoms in an optical lattice @xcite and some other ( quasi ) one - dimensional systems .",
    "although ws - states are resonances , i.e.  metastable states , in the theoretical analysis of related problems they were usually approximated by stationary states ( one - band , tight - binding , and similar approximations ) . beyond the one - band approximation ,",
    "ws - states in the semiconductor and optical lattices were studied in recent papers @xcite and @xcite by using the scattering matrix approach of ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "this approach actually solves the one - dimensional wannier - stark problem and supplies exhaustive information about 1d ws - states . in the present letter",
    "we extend the method of ref .",
    "@xcite to the case of _ two - dimensional _ lattices . for the first time we find the complex spectrum of 2d ws - states and",
    "analyze its general structure .    ) for @xmath0 ( a ) and @xmath1 ( b).,width=302 ]    to be concrete , we choose the following system : @xmath2 @xmath3 where @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "two limiting cases @xmath0 and @xmath1 correspond to an ` egg crate ' potential , for which the system is separable , and a ` quantum well ' potential , where the coupling between two degrees of freedom is maximal ( see fig .  [ lfig1 ] ) .",
    "let us also note that the choice @xmath1 corresponds to a 2d optical potential created by two standing laser waves crossing at right angle .",
    "thus the results presented below can be directly applied to the system of cold atoms in a 2d optical lattice .",
    "we briefly recall the key points of the 1d theory .",
    "the spectrum of the bloch particle in the presence of a static field consists of several sets of equidistant levels @xmath5 known as wannier - stark ladders of resonances . in eq .",
    "( [ 18 ] ) , @xmath6 stands for the lattice period , @xmath7 is the amplitude of the static force , @xmath8 is the site index and the index @xmath9 labels different ladders .",
    "the lifetime of ws - states @xmath10 is defined by the resonance width @xmath11 as @xmath12 .",
    "typically , the lifetime @xmath13 rapidly decreases with increasing index @xmath14 . because of this only the first few ws - ladders are of physical importance .    along with the ws - states @xmath10",
    ", one can also introduce wannier - bloch states ( wb - states ) by @xmath15 as follows from the definition ( [ 19 ] ) , the continuous evolution of wb - states obeys the equation @xmath16 , where @xmath17 .",
    "thus , wb - states can be alternatively defined as the eigenfunction of the evolution operator over the bloch period @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "( note that the eigenvalues of the evolution operator form degenerate bands @xmath19 ) . additionally , to ensure that @xmath20 are resonance states of the system , the eigenvalue equation for the evolution operator should be accomplished by the specific non - hermitian boundary condition .",
    "it was proven in ref .",
    "@xcite that the required boundary conditions are imposed by the truncation of the evolution operator matrix in the momentum representation .",
    "we proceed with the two - dimensional case .",
    "as mentioned above , wb - states in a 1d lattice can be defined as the non - hermitian eigenstates of the evolution operator over one bloch period . in the 2d problem",
    "there are two different bloch periods associated with the two components of the static field .",
    "therefore the notion of the wb - states can be introduced only in the case of commensurate periods , i.e. , in the case of ` rational ' direction of the field ( @xmath21 are coprime integers ) : @xmath22 provided condition ( [ 21 ] ) is satisfied , we define 2d wb - states as the non - hermitian eigenfunctions of the system evolution operator over the common bloch period @xmath23 . using the kramers - henneberger transformation , which is just the gauge which transforms the static term into the vector potential , the evolution operator can be presented in the form @xmath24 @xmath25 which reveals its translational invariance ( the hat over the exponent sign denotes time ordering )",
    "alternatively , we can rotate the coordinates so that the direction of the field coincides with the @xmath26-axis : @xmath27 transformation ( [ 24 ] ) introduces a new lattice period @xmath28 and reduces the size of the original brillouin zone @xmath29 times .",
    "associated with the new lattice period is a new bloch time @xmath30 , which is @xmath31 times shorter than the original bloch time @xmath32 . using @xmath33 and @xmath34 ,",
    "the time evolution operator over the new bloch time @xmath35 in the rotated coordinates has the form @xmath36 @xmath37 then , presenting the wave function as @xmath38 we get the matrix equation @xmath39 where @xmath40 denotes the @xmath41-dependent matrix elements of the operator ( [ 25 ] ) : @xmath42 similar to the 1d case , the truncation of the infinite unitary matrix ( [ 28 ] ) , @xmath43 which is presumed in the numerical calculations , automatically imposes the non - hermitian boundary condition along the @xmath26-direction .",
    "( truncation of the matrix over the index @xmath44 , @xmath45 does not change the hermitian boundary condition along the @xmath46-direction . )",
    "then the eigenvalues @xmath47 obtained by numerical diagonalization of the truncated matrix correspond to the quantum resonances .    in the transformed coordinates , the unit cell with area @xmath48 contains @xmath31 different sublattices , and",
    "each of them supports its own wb - states .",
    "the sublattices are related by primitive translations of the unrotated lattice , and correspondingly the energies of their wb - states differ by multiples of @xmath49 .",
    "furthermore , as function of the quasimomentum , the energies @xmath50 ( here @xmath51 is the ` bloch band ' index and @xmath52 is the sublattice index ) do not depend on @xmath53 .",
    "this follows from the fact that a change of @xmath53 in eq .",
    "( [ 28 ] ) can be compensated by shifting the time origin in eq .",
    "( [ 25 ] ) . for the @xmath46-degree of freedom the bloch theorem can be applied , and therefore @xmath54 is a periodic function of @xmath55 with generally nonzero amplitude @xmath56 .",
    "thus , assuming a rational direction of the field , in each fundamental energy interval @xmath57 , the static field induces @xmath29 identical sub - bands , separated by the energy interval @xmath58 .",
    "simultaneously , the size of the brillouin zone is reduced by a factor @xmath31 .",
    "this result resembles the one obtained for a 1d lattice affected by a time - periodic perturbation @xcite or that for a 2d lattice in a magnetic field @xcite . in these cases",
    " provided the condition of comensurability between the bloch period and the period of the driving force or the condition of ` rationality ' for the magnetic flux through a unit cell , respectively , is fulfilled  the ( quasi)energy spectrum of the system has a similar structure .",
    "we conclude this section with a remark concerning the numerical procedure .",
    "although the reduced brillouin zone approach described above is the most consistent , we found it more convenient to diagonalize the evolution operator without preliminary rotation of the coordinate .",
    "in other words , in order to find the wb - spectrum , we solve the eigenvalue equation ( [ 27 ] ) with the truncated matrix constructed on the basis of the operator ( [ 23 ] ) . as a result of the diagonalization , one obtains eigenvalues @xmath59 with quasimomentum @xmath60 defined in the original brillouin zone . because the wb - bands are uniform along the direction of the field , @xmath59 is a periodic function of both @xmath61 and @xmath62 with periods @xmath63 and @xmath64 respectively .",
    "the energies obtained in this way can then be used to construct the complete wb - spectrum @xmath54 , @xmath52 . in the next section we present results of a numerical calculation of the dispersion relation @xmath59 for the periodic potential ( [ 2 ] ) and moderate values of the static field @xmath65 , @xmath66 .",
    "it is instructive to begin with the separable case @xmath0 . in this case , 2d",
    "wb - states are given by the product of 1d states and 2d wb - energies are just the sum of 1d energies . in what follows we restrict ourselves to analyzing only the ground band .",
    "first we consider the real part of the spectrum @xmath67 .     as a function of the field direction @xmath68 ( parameters @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath0 , integers @xmath71).,width=302 ]    it was shown in the previous section that for rational directions of the field the ground wb - subbands repeat with energy splitting @xmath49 . as an example ,",
    "[ lfig3 ] shows the relative positions of these subbands as a function of the angle @xmath68 for @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "we recall that in the considered case of a separable potential the bands have zero width for any @xmath72 .     for the ground wb - states and different values of the potential parameter @xmath0 , @xmath73,@xmath74 , and @xmath75 ( from top to bottom ) .",
    "the system parameters are @xmath69 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77.,width=302 ]    the main difference between separable and non - separable potentials is that the subbands @xmath78 have a finite width in the latter case .",
    "this is illustrated by fig .",
    "[ lfig4](a ) which shows the dispersion relation @xmath79 for the potential ( [ 2 ] ) with ( from top to bottom ) @xmath0 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 .",
    "the direction of the field is @xmath80 , i.e.  @xmath81 .",
    "the amplitude of the static field and the value of the scaled planck constant are the same as in fig .",
    "[ lfig3 ] .",
    "it is seen in fig .",
    "[ lfig4](a ) that the wb - bands gain a finite width as @xmath82 is increased .",
    "we also calculated the dispersion relation @xmath79 for different angles @xmath68 , with @xmath83 .",
    "it was found that the band widths @xmath84 are typically much smaller than the mean energy separation between the subbands .",
    "thus , for practical purpose , one can neglect the band width for the real part of the spectrum .",
    "( an exception is the case @xmath85 where the width of the wb - bands approximately coincides with the width of the bloch band in the absence of the static field . ) neglecting the width of the bands they were found to form a structure similar to that shown in fig .",
    "[ lfig3 ] .",
    "we proceed with the analysis of the decay rate of the wb - states , which is determined by the imaginary part of the complex energy , @xmath86 . in the case of a separable potential",
    "the dependence @xmath87 is obviously given by the equation @xmath88 where @xmath89 stands for the width of 1d ws - resonances .",
    "for the parameters used ( @xmath69 and @xmath70 ) the dependence ( [ 31 ] ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ lfig5 ] by a solid line .",
    "the maximum around @xmath90 originates from a peak - like behavior of @xmath89 and is explained by the phenomenon of 1d resonant tunneling @xcite .    for a non - separable potential and rational direction of the field",
    "the decay rate depends on the quasimomentum . for the particular case @xmath80 this dependence",
    "is depicted in fig .",
    "[ lfig4](b ) .",
    "we would like to note the complicated behavior of @xmath91 .",
    "the oscillating character of the decay rate is an open problem for the present day . because the decay rate depends on the quasimomentum it might be convenient to introduce the notion of @xmath92 , where the average is taken over the reduced brillouin zone .",
    "the dots in fig .",
    "[ lfig5 ] show the values of @xmath92 for some rational direction of the field and two different values of @xmath82 .",
    "it is seen that for a small @xmath93 the ratio @xmath94 is small and the obtained dependence @xmath95 essentially reproduces that of the separable case .",
    "however , this is not valid for @xmath1 , where the decay rate varies wildly .",
    "thus , in the case of strong coupling between two degrees of freedom the description of ws - state by a mean decay rate is insufficient .",
    "we studied wannier resonances in a 2d system , mainly discussing the complex energy spectrum of the wannier - bloch states .",
    "however , because the latter are related to the wannier - stark states by a fourier transformation , the obtained results can be easily reformulated in terms of the wannier - stark resonances .",
    "then the following is valid .",
    "( i ) neglecting the asymptotic tail , ws - states are localized functions along the direction of the field .",
    "( this follows from the degeneracy of wb - bands along the field direction . )",
    "( ii ) for any rational direction of the field [ see eq .",
    "( [ 21 ] ) ] ws - states are bloch waves in the transverse direction .",
    "( iii ) for a non - separable potential the corresponding energy bands have a finite width .",
    "( iv ) for the _ real _ part of the spectrum , the band widths are small and can be well neglected for @xmath96 .",
    "we also found a nontrivial dependence of the resonance width ( inverse lifetime of ws - states ) on the direction of the field . because the value of the resonance width defines the decay of the probability , a complicated behavior of the survival probability",
    "is expected when the direction of the field is varied .",
    "the detailed study of the probability dynamics is reserved for future publication .     in the case of",
    "separable potential ( @xmath0 , solid curve ) .",
    "the dashed and dashed - dotted lines are an interpolation to arbitrary @xmath97 of the mean decay rate calculated for some rational directions of the field ( dots ) for @xmath93 and @xmath1 , respectively .",
