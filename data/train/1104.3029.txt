    "pushed on by the overwhelming flow of observational data in the last fifteen years , most cosmologists today agree on a well defined cosmological paradigm , based on general relativity plus a cosmological constant @xmath1 .",
    "this paradigm is known as the concordance cosmological model @xcite and accounts not only for the early formation of large  scale structures but also for the more recently discovered stage of acceleration of the universe . as to the building up of galaxies and galaxy clusters , it has been necessary to introduce an ingredient like dark matter , which was first employed to succeed in describing rotational curves in spiral galaxies @xcite ( for an alternative view , see for example the work in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "cosmic acceleration requires the consideration of the so  called dark energy as the major ingredient of the cosmic content @xcite , @xmath1 being just the simplest way to consider it . both of them sum up to more than @xmath2 of the matter  energy constituents around us .",
    "such dark energies , on the other hand , have simply hidden the fundamental issues , since so far no exhaustive physical explanation for them has been put on firm theoretical and experimental ground . this has led to many alternative ways to reproduce the astrophysical phenomena cited above , not only by introducing theoretically well motivated new particles and fields , but also by means , for instance , of possible geometrical changes of the spacetime structure ( @xmath3 theories are well known examples of this kind of proposals @xcite @xcite .    without entering any details of so many attempts to describe the cosmological behaviour , we shall here consider only some aspects of one of them , i.e. that stemming from the possibility that not only the cosmological term @xmath1 could vary with space and time , but also the gravitational coupling @xmath4 .",
    "in this context , one way to achieve the physical realization of such assumptions is to study cosmological dynamics by analyzing `` renormalization group ( rg ) induced '' quantum effects , which drive the dimensionless cosmological `` constant '' @xmath5 and newton `` constant '' @xmath6 from an ultraviolet attractive fixed point @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite . in the exact theory ,",
    "such a non - gaussian ultraviolet fixed point implies its nonperturbative renormalizability @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite . as a result , this renormalization group improved framework describes gravity at a typical distance scale @xmath7 , and introduces an effective average action @xmath8 $ ] for euclidean quantum gravity @xcite , finally implying an exact functional renormalization group equation for the @xmath9dependence of @xmath10 .",
    "this framework is usually known as _",
    "quantum einstein gravity_. within it , one can get an explicit @xmath9dependence of both the running newton and cosmological terms @xmath11 and @xmath12 , which can be relevant both for the initial planck era and the structure of black hole singularities @xcite @xcite @xcite .    taking into account its inherent infrared divergences , quantum einstein gravity can be subject to strong renormalization effects even at very large distances . in cosmology ,",
    "such effects lead to a dynamical relaxation of @xmath1 and can also be assumed to deal with the cosmological constant problem @xcite . viewing the late accelerated expansion of the universe as a renormalization group evolution near a non  gaussian infrared fixed point @xcite (",
    "although the actual existence of an infrared fixed point has not been proved as yet ) , one can assume that the transition between standard flrw cosmology and accelerated renormalization group driven expansion occurs at the time when the fixed point is almost reached .",
    "as to this , some agreement has been found between this kind of model and early sneia observations @xcite .    as a matter of fact , for a homogeneous and isotropic universe",
    ", it is possible to identify @xmath9 with the inverse of cosmological time , @xmath13 @xcite @xcite , hence deriving a dynamical evolution for @xmath11 and @xmath12 induced by their renormalization group running .",
    "the arnowitt  deser  misner ( adm ) formulation @xcite builds a modified action functional which reduces to the einstein ",
    "hilbert action when @xmath4 is constant .",
    "within such a framework , and always assuming homogeneity and isotropy , one can obtain a power  law growth of the scale factor for pure gravity and for a massless @xmath14 theory , in agreement with what is known on fixed ",
    "point cosmology . on the other hand , by means of the so - called noether symmetry approach @xcite @xcite , in ref .",
    "@xcite we have also proposed solutions for the pure gravity case , which mimic inflation without introducing a scalar field in the cosmic content . in ref",
    "@xcite , for gravity with a scalar field , this approach only succeeds in fixing the expressions of @xmath15 and @xmath16 as @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively , while the transformed cosmological equations derived by means of the method do not seem to be easily solvable @xcite , therefore giving no new insight into possible solutions .    in what follows ,",
    "we take again into account the exact solutions of the flat dust matter - dominated cosmological equations ( without any scalar field ) , already investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite by means of the noether symmetry approach , and by using an expression for @xmath19 determined by the method itself .",
    "after briefly reviewing the theoretical model , we show that our cosmological model is compatible with various recent observational data , in particular with the observations of type ia supernovae ( sneia ) ( we use the recently updated sneia sample , referred to as union2 @xcite , containing 557 sneia spanning the redshift range @xmath20 . ) , the gamma ray bursts hubble diagram ( grbs hd ) ( we use a sample _ calibrated _ in a model independent way with the sneia dataset @xcite ) , and the gas mass fraction in x - ray luminous galaxy clusters ( we use a sample of chandra measurements of the x - ray gas mass fraction in 42 hot ( @xmath21kev ) , x - ray luminous , dynamically relaxed galaxy clusters spanning the redshift range @xmath22 @xcite ) .",
    "we are aware that such observational tests can not definitively distinguish our model from the standard @xmath1cdm one , at least because of the presence of still large observational errors .",
    "however , it provides a crucial and necessary test of reliability .",
    "looking at future studies on this , we finally apply to our cosmological model a cosmographic approach , which can indeed contribute to select realistic models without imposing arbitrary choices _ a priori_. as a matter of fact , cosmography and its reliability are based on the assumptions that the universe is spatially homogeneous and isotropic on large scale , and luminosity distance can be `` tracked '' by the derivative series of the scale factor @xmath23 .",
    "we actually estimate the cosmographic parameters here derived by fitting both the sneia union2 dataset and the _ calibrated _ grbs hd .    we also begin to study how our model is affected by the inclusion of radiation into the cosmic content .",
    "it in fact turns out that , by performing the numerical integration of the equations so rewritten , the total density parameter is initially dominated by the radiation contribution and later on by the matter one , leaving then space to the now observed accelerated stage .",
    "the scheme of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we summarize the lagrangian formulation used to derive the renormalization ",
    "group improved einstein cosmological equations with the ordinary matter energy ",
    "momentum tensor , as well as the results deduced from the noether symmetry found in ref .",
    "@xcite . in sections 3 , 4 and 5",
    "we present the comparison of theoretical predictions with observational data .",
    "section 6 is then devoted to the cosmographic approach , and section 7 to inclusion of radiation into the model .",
    "finally , some conclusions are drawn in section 8 .",
    "let us consider the approach outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite and there applied to models of gravity with variable @xmath4 and @xmath1 in the context of quantum einstein gravity .",
    "it is known that , in a homogeneous and isotropic universe , an independent dynamical @xmath4 is equivalent to metric - scalar gravity already at classical level @xcite @xcite , while independent variations ( with position and time ) of @xmath4 and @xmath1 can lead to pathological situations . indeed , if @xmath1 were an independent variable , one should write that the momentum conjugate to it vanishes , and the preservation in time of this primary constraint would imply a vanishing lapse function and hence a `` collapse '' of spacetime geometry @xcite .",
    "all this in fact leads to assume a generic functional dependence @xmath24 @xcite .    in the matter  dominated case in a flat homogeneous and isotropic cosmology ( with a signature @xmath25 for the metric , lapse function @xmath26 and shift vector @xmath27 ) , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we start from the lagrangian @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 , while dots indicate time derivatives , and @xmath31 is a nonvanishing interaction parameter introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite and also used in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was shown that @xmath32 .",
    "the matter contribution is of course given by @xmath33 , with @xmath34 ; here , we have to take @xmath35 for dust , while @xmath36 is a suitable integration constant connected to the matter content . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , from eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) we get the euler ",
    "lagrange equations for @xmath37 and @xmath4 @xmath38 @xmath39 the hamiltonian constraint @xcite @xmath40 is equivalent to the constraint on the _ energy _ function associated with @xmath41 @xcite@xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xmath42    for matter , the dust case involves a zero pressure , @xmath43 , and an energy density @xmath44 , so that the matter term in the lagrangian is simply a constant .",
    "it therefore has no effect on the equations of motion with respect to the pure gravity case ; nevertheless , it has to be considered , since it occurs in the constraint equation ( [ 5bis ] ) .",
    "the system of equations of motion can then be solved @xcite by using the noether symmetry approach @xcite @xcite , in which we consider @xmath41 as a point lagrangian , a function of the variables @xmath37 and @xmath4 , and their first derivatives @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "we have already shown that a consistent choice of the function @xmath24 leads to the existence of a noether symmetry for the lagrangian @xcite . as a matter of fact , in the matter  dominated case we get the same noether symmetry as in the pure gravity situation , so that , by using the same transformations introduced in this latter case , one can write @xmath45 and @xmath29 as therein , now just updating the energy constraint .",
    "( for more details , see ref .",
    "@xcite . )",
    "the dynamics of @xmath1 is coupled with that of @xmath4 and is driven by the equation @xmath46 where the parameter @xmath47 is an arbitrary constant related to the interaction factor @xmath31 by the relation @xmath48 .",
    "this equation admits the solution @xmath49 @xmath50 being an integration constant and @xmath51 .",
    "it turns out that @xmath50 is related to the present value of @xmath4 @xcite , and we might determine @xmath50 in order to get @xmath52 .",
    "furthermore , we fix time scale and origin so as to get @xmath53 .",
    "thus , we find @xcite @xmath54 where we define the constants @xmath55\\label{eqb}\\,,\\\\ c & \\equiv & c(n , w ) \\equiv ( 6n-1)^{2(3n-1)}\\left [ 12n^2(12n-1 ) \\right]^{1 - 3n } { w}^{3n-1 } \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we point out that the asymptotic time behavior of the scale factor is characterized by the two exponents @xmath56 and we want that @xmath57 and @xmath58 ( in order to obtain early matter domination and a later accelerated evolution ) , which implies that we find a limited range of variability for the @xmath59 parameter of our model is not strictly necessary , but it has been used , already in ref .",
    "@xcite , as an instrument to fix somehow the reachable regions in the space of parameters ( at least for what it concerns @xmath59 ) .",
    "this means that one could perform our analysis leaving the @xmath60 parameters , and then @xmath59 , completely free ] , @xmath61 .",
    "we then see that , when @xmath62 , one has @xmath63 , and we recover the same results obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite for the pure gravity model .",
    "( [ eqa ] ) and ( [ eqb ] ) make it possible to obtain @xmath36 and @xmath50 as functions of @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath59 , i.e. @xmath66 to make things analytically simpler and obtain a better control of the space of parameters related to the integration constants , we set the present time @xmath67 .",
    "this fixes the scale of time according to the ( unknown ) age of the universe .",
    "in other words , this means that we are using the age of the universe , @xmath68 , as a unit of time , and the whole history of the universe has been _ squeezed _ to the range of time @xmath69 $ ] .",
    "we then set @xmath70 , which is standard , and finally @xmath71 .",
    "because of our choice of time unit , it turns out that _ our @xmath72 is not the same as the hubble constant _ which appears in the standard flrw model .",
    "such choices introduce a constraint between @xmath64 and @xmath65 : @xmath73 on choosing to normalize @xmath74 , the definition of the redshift @xmath75 yields @xmath76 depending only on the parameter @xmath59 .",
    "it turns out that we obtain the following expression for @xmath72 and @xmath77 :    @xmath78    @xmath79    we have constrained the parameters of our model in order to have @xmath80 .",
    "therefore , the density parameter of matter is @xmath81 and it turns out that the constraint @xmath82 is satisfied .",
    "moreover , as already pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , we do not expect that @xmath83 , even if we fixed the parameters in order to get it .",
    "anyway , we have to consider that small differences between @xmath84 and @xmath85 could imply @xmath84 varying a lot in time , with relevant effects on the evolution of the universe .",
    "it is worth noting that @xmath4 has a special role in the subject of time variation of the fundamental parameters .",
    "actually a dependence of @xmath4 on time may point out to violation of the strong equivalence principle , but not necessarily of the einstein equivalence principle , whereas the nonconstancy of the other  constants  , like the electroweak or strong coupling constants , necessarily represents a violation of the equivalence principle in both its forms . here",
    "we will only discuss some aspects of the response of primordial abundances to the time variations of @xmath4 , as expected in our model , on the basis of previous analysis on the subject performed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it turns out that the production of each element responds in its own way to a variation @xmath86 of the newton constant .",
    "a general study , that can account for a time dependence of @xmath4 during the bbn period , requires the introduction of suitable functions which describe the response of each element to an arbitrary time ",
    "dependent modification of the early universe expansion rate , and it is out of the aim of the present work .",
    "so , we simply discuss the observational bounds on the possible variations of the gravitational constant in the early universe , considering the best limit ( at @xmath87 ) , @xmath88 , obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , by combining @xmath89 observational results with the measurements of the baryon to photon ratio obtained from cmb and lss data when the temperature of the universe is @xmath90 mev ( i.e. during and immediately after the d - bottleneck epoch ) and is consistent with the standard assumption that @xmath4 has lightly varied during the evolution of the universe . ]",
    ". we will postpone to a forthcoming paper the detailed analysis of the dependence of the various elemental abundances on the time variation of @xmath4 for our model .",
    "it turns out that our model can satisfy such a best fit limit , provided that the @xmath59 parameter is appropriately selected ( the role of @xmath65 is only marginal with respect to this strong constraint ) , and compatible with the other basic cosmological observations , as shown in fig .",

    ", we first evaluate the fractional time rate of change of @xmath4 ~10 ^ -2 . here , it is important to remember that we are using the age of the universe as unit , so that the effective rate is of order @xmath93 yr@xmath94 , in agreement with the observations ( see for instance ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    we can thus say that , eventually , the running of both the gravitational coupling @xmath95 and the cosmological term @xmath96 induced by quantum effects appears to yield both a primordial inflation ( soon after the universe exits the region where the attraction basin of the non - gaussian ( ultraviolet ) fixed point works @xcite ) , and a later inflationary epoch in a _",
    "matter  dominated _ period of the expansion of the universe .",
    "this appears to be interesting since it is obtained always without having to introduce any scalar field in the cosmic content @xcite .",

    "<S> in the framework of renormalization - group improved cosmologies , we analyze both theoretically and observationally the exact and general solution of the matter  dominated cosmological equations , using the expression of @xmath0 already determined by the integration method employed in a previous paper </S>",
    "<S> . a rough comparison between such a model and the concordance @xmath1cdm model as to the magnitude  redshift relationship has been already done , without showing any appreciable differences . </S>",
    "<S> we here perform a more refined study of how astrophysical data ( union2 set ) on type - i supernovae , gamma ray bursts ( in a sample _ calibrated _ in a model independent way with the sneia dataset ) , and gas fraction in galaxy clusters ( using a sample of chandra measurements of the x - ray gas mass fraction ) affect the model and constrain its parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we also apply a cosmographic approach to our cosmological model and estimate the cosmographic parameters by fitting both the supernovae and the gamma ray bursts datasets . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this matter - dominated cosmological model with variable newton parameter and variable cosmological term is indeed compatible with the observations above ( on type ia supernovae , the gamma ray bursts hubble diagram , and the gas mass fraction in x - ray luminous galaxy clusters ) . </S>",
    "<S> the cosmographic approach adopted confirms such conclusions . </S>",
    "<S> finally , it seems possible to include radiation into the model , since numerical integration of the equations derived by the presence of both radiation and matter shows that , after inflation , the total density parameter is initially dominated by the radiation contribution and later by the matter one . </S>"
