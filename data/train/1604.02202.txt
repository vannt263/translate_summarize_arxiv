    "quantum entanglement is the combination of quantum superposition and the tensor product structure of quantum state space .",
    "it is one of the most fundamental features of quantum mechanics which distinguishes the quantum from classical world , while it serves as an important physical resource in quantum information processing tasks . in past decades ,",
    "quantification of entanglement , one of the key subjects in entanglement theory , has attracted much interest and a lot of remarkable entanglement measures have been proposed @xcite .",
    "however , quantum entanglement , in general , does not correspond to an observable due to the unphysical operations such as the complex conjugation for concurrence @xcite and the partial transpose for negativity @xcite .",
    "this means that entanglement can not be directly measured in experiment .",
    "so the usual method to measuring entanglement is reconstructing the density matrix to be considered by the state tomography @xcite which is fit for small systems .",
    "as an effective tool of detecting entanglement , the entanglement witness @xcite usually depends on the state , which implies some prior knowledge about the state . even though some methods have been developed in order to overcome the mentioned shortcomings @xcite , an important step is taken by the reformulation of pure - state concurrence of qubits in terms of a series of projectors on the two - fold copy of the state @xcite .",
    "this is also a direct motivation for both the latter experimental realization @xcite and the theoretic progress on the measurable concurrence for mixed states @xcite , measurable geometric discord of two qubits @xcite , and measurable three - tangle of pure states @xcite . of course , the two - fold ( or multiple - fold )",
    "copy should be understood as a source producing identical states to the one for which we want to quantify its entanglement , which should be distinguished from the quantum non - cloning theorem @xcite .",
    "although a not - less - than - fourfold copy of a state for this entanglement makes the direct measurements possible , it simultaneously challenges the practical realization in experiment .    in this paper",
    ", we present a scheme to directly measure the genuine tripartite pure - state entanglement not only for qubit systems but also for @xmath1-dimensional systems . the distinct advantage of this scheme is as follows .",
    "( 1 ) _ only two simultaneous copies _ : only a two - fold copy of the tripartite quantum state is required compared with the previous four - fold copy ; ( 2 ) _ a few projectors _ : @xmath2 single - party plus two two - party rank - one projectors are much less than @xmath3 for the state tomography of a @xmath4-dimensional state , which is the common advantage of all the related schemes , but only two two - party projectors are needed in contrast to six for three - qubit states in the previous scheme @xcite ; ( 3 ) _ local operations _ :",
    "the projective measurements are performed locally , which is the same as the previous schemes . as an example",
    ", we give a detailed demonstration and analysis on directly measuring the polarization entanglement of three photons in the frame of linear optics .",
    "this shows the feasibility of our scheme .",
    "in addition , the lower bounds of the genuine tripartite entanglement which is especially sufficient for detecting this type of entanglement are also provided for less adjustments of practical operations , but the cost , besides the lower bound , is that more projective measurement outcomes are needed . finally , the influence of the imperfect experiment on our scheme is also discussed .",
    "unlike bipartite entanglement , multipartite entanglement can be divided into many inequivalent entanglement classes . for example , three qubits can be entangled in two ways @xcite and four qubits can be entangled in nine ways @xcite .",
    "therefore , usually a single scalar can only effectively characterize the entanglement of a single class or for some particular purposes .",
    "even though multipartite entanglement of several quantum states has been well classified , three - tangle was first presented by coffman , _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and is the most remarkable and widely accepted entanglement monotone for a general state ( instead of the states of given class ) to quantify the greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) type entanglement of qubits .",
    "ghz type entanglement describes genuine tripartite inseparability .",
    "it is distinguished from its opposite tripartite entanglement class ( w type entanglement ) that lies in the different robustness of the residual two - qubit entanglement against losing the third qubit .",
    "in fact , ghz type entanglement can also be understood by the maximal extra average two - qubit entanglement induced by measurements on the third qubit with classical communication @xcite .",
    "furthermore , 3-tangle can be naturally generalized to a @xmath4-dimensional quantum state in terms of concurrence and localizable concurrence .",
    "this can be explicitly given as follows .",
    "a tripartite quantum pure state of qubits defined in the @xmath1-dimensional hilbert space @xmath5 can be written in a computational basis as @xmath6the reduced density matrix @xmath7 .",
    "considering the operations on qudit c , the maximal average concurrence of qubits a and b is characterized by the localizable concurrence @xcite which is given by @xmath8and the minimal average concurrence is given by the concurrence @xcite of @xmath9 , that is , @xmath10where @xmath11 denotes the square root of the eigenvalues of the matrix , @xmath12 in decreasing order with @xmath13 .",
    "thus the genuine tripartite entanglement monotone can be defined by @xcite@xmath14it is obvious that @xmath15 will become three - tangle for @xmath16 .",
    "our first result shows that @xmath17 can be directly measured in experiment provided that only two - fold copy of @xmath18 is available .",
    "our second result shows that the lower bound of @xmath19 can also be directly measured under the same condition with much simpler practical operations .     with the yellow shades representing the potential existence of quantum correlation .",
    "the dotted frame means a projective measurement @xmath20 performed on the two particles inside and the solid frame denotes a single - qubit projective measurement @xmath21.,width=151 ]",
    "it can be found that the matrix @xmath22 given in eq . ( [ m ] ) is the key to obtaining the genuine tripartite entanglement monotone @xmath23 .",
    "next we will construct another measurable matrix that can extract all of the useful information related to @xmath24 from the matrix @xmath22 .    considering a set of orthonormal basis @xmath25 in @xmath26 , @xmath27",
