    "for us , an operator algebra is a norm closed algebra of operators on a hilbert space . in ` noncommutative peak interpolation ' , one generalizes classical ` peak interpolation ' to the setting of operator algebras , using akemann s noncommutative topology @xcite . in classical peak interpolation",
    "the setting is a subalgebra @xmath0 of @xmath1 , the continuous scalar functions on a compact hausdorff space @xmath2 , and one tries to build functions @xmath3 as in figure 1 which have prescribed values or behaviour on a fixed closed subset @xmath4 , and @xmath5 .     with @xmath6 or @xmath7 .",
    "]    the sets @xmath8 that ` work ' for this are the @xmath9-sets , namely the closed sets whose characteristic functions are in @xmath10 .",
    "_ glicksberg s peak set theorem _ characterizes these sets as the intersections of _ peak sets _ , i.e.  sets of form @xmath11 for @xmath12 . in the separable case",
    "they are just the peak sets . a typical peak interpolation result , originating in results of e. bishop ( see e.g.  e.g.  ii.12.5 in @xcite ) , says that if @xmath13 is strictly positive , and if @xmath14 is a continuous function on such a set @xmath8 which is the restriction of a function in @xmath0 , and whose absolute value is dominated by the ` control function ' @xmath15 on @xmath8 ( see figure 2a ) , has an extension @xmath16 in @xmath0 satisfying @xmath17 on all of @xmath2 ( see figure 2b ) .     on @xmath8 .",
    "b : seek @xmath3 with @xmath6 and @xmath17 everywhere . ]    a special case of interest is when @xmath18 ; for example when this is applied to the disk algebra one obtains the well known rudin - carleson theorem ( see ii.12.6 in @xcite ) .",
    "it also yields ` urysohn type lemmas ' in which one finds a function in @xmath0 which is @xmath19 on @xmath8 and close to zero on a closed set @xmath20 disjoint from @xmath8 ( it can be zero on @xmath20 if @xmath20 is also a @xmath9-set ) .",
    "we discuss below generalizations of all of these results .",
    "noncommutative interpolation for @xmath21-algebras has been studied by many @xmath21-algebraists , and is a key application of akemann s noncommutative topology .",
    "see particularly l.g .",
    "brown s treatise @xcite .",
    "for example akemann s urysohn lemma for @xmath21-algebras ( see e.g.  @xcite ) is a noncommutative interpolation result of a selfadjoint flavor , and this result plays a role for example in recent approaches to the important cuntz semigroup @xcite .",
    "noncommutative peak interpolation for ( possibly nonselfadjoint ) operator algebras was introduced in the thesis of our student damon hay @xcite .",
    "it is the theory one gets if one combines the two theories discussed above : classical peak interpolation and the @xmath21-algebra variant .",
    "here we have a subalgebra @xmath0 of a possibly noncommutative @xmath21-algebra @xmath22 , and we wish to build operators in @xmath0 which have prescribed behaviours with respect to akemann s noncommutative generalizations of closed sets , which are certain projections @xmath23 in @xmath24 . in the case that @xmath25 , the characteristic function @xmath26 of an open or closed set @xmath8 in @xmath2 may be viewed as an element of @xmath27 in a natural way since @xmath28 is a certain space of measures on @xmath2 . via semicontinuity",
    ", it is natural to declare a projection @xmath29 to be _ open _ if it is a increasing ( weak * ) limit of positive elements in @xmath22 , and closed if its ` perp ' @xmath30 is _ open _ ( see @xcite ) . thus if @xmath25 the open or closed projections are precisely the characteristic functions of open or closed sets .",
    "thus one has a copy of the topology in the second dual ( one may work in a small subspace of the second dual if one prefers )",
    ". we will not discuss noncommutative topology in detail here , but with the definitions above one can now try to prove inside @xmath24 noncommutative versions of the basic results in topology , where unions of open sets are replaced by suprema @xmath31 of projections , etc .",
    "open projections arise naturally in functional analysis .",
    "for example , they come naturally out of the ` spectral theorem / functional calculus ' : the spectral projections of a selfadjoint operator @xmath32 corresponding to open sets in the spectrum of @xmath32 , are open projections . the range projection of any operator is an open projection . we state akemann s noncommutative urysohn lemma in the case that @xmath22 is a unital @xmath21-algebra : given @xmath33 closed projections in @xmath24 , with @xmath34 , there exists @xmath35 with @xmath36 and @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "indeed akemann s noncommutative topology has good ` separation ' properties , whereas other approaches to noncommutative topology are usually spectacularly far from even being ` hausdorff ' .",
    "note that the classical statement @xmath39 on @xmath8 ( see figure 1 ) , becomes @xmath40 where @xmath23 is the projection playing the role of ( the characteristic function of ) @xmath8 .",
    "on the other hand , an order relation like @xmath41 on @xmath8 , might become the operator theoretic statement @xmath42 , or something similar .",
    "over the years we with coauthors ( particularly hay , neal , and read ) have developed a number of noncommutative peak interpolation results , which when specialized to the case @xmath25 collapse to classical peak interpolation theorems .",
    "moreover , in the course of this investigation striking applications have emerged to the theory of one - sided ideals or hereditary subalgebras of operator algebras , the theory of approximate identities , noncommutative topology , noncommutative function theory , the generalization of hilbert c*-modules to nonselfadjoint algebras , and other topics ( see e.g.  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . in many of these applications",
    "one is mimicking @xmath21-algebra techniques , but using ideas from our theory .",
    "current with the most recent version of @xcite the peak interpolation program appears to be approaching its culmination .",
    "the basic theory seems now to be essentially complete , and we have a good idea of what works and what does not .",
    "what remains is further applications , and in particular those of the kind we have been doing in the cited papers , namely the generalization of more @xmath21-algebraic techniques and results to general operator algebras . also there will be applications inspired by the matching function theory ( see e.g.  @xcite )",
    "two of the most powerful results in the theory are read s theorem on approximate identities @xcite , and hay s main theorem in @xcite . these are foundational results in the subject , but the extreme depth of their proofs hindered their accessibility . in the present note",
    "we give short proofs of both of these results by using noncommutative peak interpolation .",
    "the proofs are still quite nontrivial , but we have written them so as to be readable in full detail in an hour or so by a functional analyst .",
    "the crux of the proof is a special case of a new noncommutative peak interpolation theorem , the latter also proven here , generalizing the classical one mentioned above in the first paragraph of our paper ( involving @xmath16 and @xmath15 ) . below we will give examples of applications of both results to peak interpolation .",
    "indeed our paper is in part a brief survey of the basic ideas of noncommutative peak interpolation .    turning to notation",
    ", we will delay many of the noncommutative definitions and features until they are needed .",
    "the reader is referred for example to @xcite for more details on some of the topics below if needed .",
    "we will use silently the fact from basic analysis that @xmath43 is the weak * closure in @xmath44 of a subspace @xmath45 , and is isometric to @xmath46 . recall that @xmath47 is an _",
    "@xmath48-ideal _ in @xmath49 if @xmath50 for a subspace @xmath51 of @xmath52 .",
    "this notion was introduced by alfsen and effros ; and in this case for any @xmath53 there exists @xmath54 with the distance @xmath55 ( see @xcite ) . for us",
    "a _ projection _ is always an orthogonal projection .",
    "an _ approximately unital _ operator algebra is one that has a contractive approximate identity ( cai ) .",
    "if @xmath0 is a nonunital operator algebra represented ( completely ) isometrically on a hilbert space @xmath56 then one may identify the unitization @xmath57 with @xmath58 . if @xmath0 is unital ( i.e.  has an identity of norm @xmath19 ) we set @xmath59 . if @xmath0 is an operator algebra",
    "then the second dual @xmath60 is an operator algebra too with its ( unique ) arens product , this is also the product inherited from the von neumann algebra @xmath24 if @xmath0 is a subalgebra of a @xmath21-algebra @xmath22 .",

    "both projections are in the center of @xmath24 , since @xmath67 for @xmath68 .",
    "we first prove a simple noncommutative peak interpolation result that has implications for the unitization of an operator algebra .",
    "[ peakthang222 ] suppose that @xmath0 is an approximately unital operator algebra , and let @xmath69 be as above .",
    "if @xmath70 for an invertible @xmath71 in the positive cone @xmath72 , then there exists an element @xmath73 with @xmath74 , and @xmath75 .",
    "thus if @xmath0 is nonunital and @xmath76 with @xmath77 then there exists an @xmath78 with @xmath79 .",

    "is @xmath85 ) , which may be viewed as a subspace of @xmath86 .",
    "so @xmath87 is an @xmath48-ideal in @xmath88 as defined in the introduction , and , as we said there , there exists @xmath89 such that @xmath90 . since @xmath91",
    "we have @xmath92 setting @xmath93 then @xmath94 , and @xmath95 so that @xmath96 and so @xmath75 . for the last assertion",
    "take @xmath97 .    remark .",
    "the last assertion of lemma [ peakthang222 ] is in fact equivalent to the other assertion .",
    "since this will not be needed we leave it as an exercise in spectral theory .",

    "then @xmath63 is an open projection in the @xmath21-algebra sense with respect to @xmath22 .",
