    "a one - dimensional topological superconductor thus has localized majorana fermions at its ends@xcite and one could envision implementing braiding operations in a network of such wires.@xcite concrete proposals how to create a one - dimensional topological superconducting state in a semiconductor - superconductor heterostructure@xcite were rapidly followed by pioneering experiments@xcite showing indeed signatures of localized majorana end states .",
    "all these proposals rely on inducing a spin polarization in the wire ( i.e.  breaking of time - reversal symmetry ) , enabling the wire to mimic a spinless @xmath1-wave superconductor .",
    "interestingly , a few years ago it was realized that , in analogy to the quantum hall and quantum spin hall effects , also topological superconductivity can arise not only in systems with broken time - reversal symmetry , but also in time - reversal invariant systems.@xcite a time - reversal symmetric topological superconductor has a gapped bulk and has majorana modes emerging in ( time - reversed ) _ pairs _ at the edges of the sample .",
    "despite the fact that a pair of majorana fermions constitutes one regular fermion , it was argued that these time - reversed majorana pairs might obey non - abelian braiding statistics.@xcite although their braiding statistics are not topologically protected,@xcite there are situations in which they could be useful in the context of topological quantum computation .",
    "proposals for how to create a solid - state time - reversal symmetric topological superconductor included coupling of a single - band semiconductor to a more exotic type of superconductor , such as @xmath2-wave@xcite or @xmath3-wave.@xcite other suggestions were to use a conventional @xmath0-wave superconductor but couple it to a multi - layer interacting semiconductor,@xcite to different topological insulators,@xcite , or couple it with a phase difference to different parts of a single multi - band semiconductor.@xcite in essence , most of these proposals rely on having two pairs of time - reversed fermi surfaces of which the effective pairing potentials have opposite sign .    very recently ,",
    "the proposed setup of a single two - channel nanowire ( or equivalently two single - channel nanowires ) coupled to a conventional @xmath0-wave superconductor was investigated in more theoretical detail.@xcite it was found in ref .   that the requirement of having opposite induced pairing potentials in the two channels ( as was assumed in ref .  )",
    "could be generalized to the condition @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the induced pairing potential in channel 1(2 ) and @xmath6 is an _ interchannel _ pairing potential , coupling electrons in one channel to holes in the other channel . for the case that the two channels live in different nanowires ,",
    "it was suggested that repulsive electron - electron interactions could play an important role : they are expected to suppress the induced _",
    "intra_wire pairing,@xcite whereas the _ inter_wire pairing is barely affected due to very effective screening by the superconductor .",
    "if this suppression is strong enough , the system could thus enter a topological superconducting phase , even for @xmath7 .",
    "this result was supported by numerical hartree - fock and dmrg calculations , which indeed showed the emergence of a topological non - trivial phase in a two - channel nanowire coupled to an @xmath0-wave superconductor if strong enough electron - electron interactions were included.@xcite    electron - electron interactions can thus be a crucial ingredient for devising a time - reversal invariant topological superconductor , and a thorough understanding of their effect on the properties of proximity - coupled nanowires is quintessential .",
    "bosonization,@xcite dmrg,@xcite and numerical hartree - fock@xcite approaches indicated that interactions can indeed suppress the proximity - induced pairing in a nanowire ( as well as enhance its spin - polarization , which is especially relevant for systems with broken time - reversal symmetry ) .    in this work",
    "we analyze in detail the effect of electron - electron interactions on the induced electron - hole pairing in a proximity coupled nanowire . assuming a finite superconducting order parameter inside the wire , imposed by its contact with a nearby bulk superconductor , we use a self - consistent mean - field approach  basically the same approach as used for the numerical calculations in ref .",
    "and show that we can arrive at analytic expressions for the interaction - induced reduction of the proximity - induced superconductivity in the wire . for the realistic case of weak tunnel coupling between the wire and the superconductor ( i.e.  the tunneling rate @xmath8 into the superconductor smaller than the pairing energy @xmath9 inside the superconductor ) we find the suppression to be @xmath10 , where @xmath11 characterizes the ratio of the strength of the electron - electron interactions and the nanowire density of states , and @xmath12 is the small parameter @xmath13 . for large @xmath14",
    "this suppression becomes strong , ultimately reducing the induced pairing to zero .    in the context of time - reversal symmetric topological superconductivity in a two - wire setup",
    ", one has to compare this suppressed pairing energy with the interwire pairing @xmath6 .",
    "this interwire pairing is assumed not to be affected by interactions , due to very effective screening by the superconductor .",

    "we used the kronecker delta function @xmath46 and we renormalized @xmath47 with @xmath48 the volume of the superconductor . the coefficient @xmath49 now has dimension energy , and for convenience it is assumed to be real .",
    "electron - electron interactions inside the nanowires are assumed to be very short - ranged due to strong screening by the nearby superconductor .",
    "we thus assume only intrawire interactions to be relevant and we model the interactions with a simple contact interaction potential , @xmath50 .",

    "we start by integrating out the superconductor degrees of freedom , resulting in a self - energy term for the electron green functions in the nanowire , @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a fermionic matsubara frequency at temperature @xmath56 ( setting @xmath57 ) .",

    "a low - energy effective pairing hamiltonian can be extracted in the same way as before .",
    "first , we convert the sum in ( [ eq : se3 ] ) into an integral over @xmath73 which yields in the same limit @xmath97 as we used before @xmath98 where we defined the dimensionless function @xmath99 with @xmath100 being the zeroth order modified bessel function of the second kind . in the limit of small energies , @xmath83",

    "it turns out that the approximation of the bessel function is already excellent for moderately large @xmath108 . from this hamiltonian",
    "we thus extract the magnitude of the induced interwire pairing potential , @xmath109 we see that the pairing energy oscillates as a function of @xmath15 on a length scale @xmath110 , and is suppressed algebraically by @xmath111 and exponentially by @xmath112 .    for two ( zero - dimensional ) quantum dots coupled to the same superconductor",
    ", the crossed andreev amplitude was found to be proportional to @xmath113 , where @xmath15 is now the distance between the dots.@xcite we see that for the two - wire setup the suppression is less severe , we find for distances shorter than @xmath114 a @xmath115-suppression instead of a @xmath116-suppression .",
    "this `` gain '' of a factor @xmath117 is due to the reduced effective dimensionality of our setup : the translational invariance along the @xmath24-axis removes effectively one direction in which the electron - hole correlation function inside the superconductor decays . as a side remark , we note here that the suppression might become even less strong if one uses a diffusive superconductor instead of a clean one , as we assumed here.@xcite    we also emphasize that the tunneling amplitudes used in our model ( [ eq : tun ] ) consist of @xmath118-functions of coordinate .",
    "this implies that we assume that all tunneling between wire @xmath22 and the substrate takes place along a straight line with @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "as soon as the wires have a finite contact area with the superconductor , and tunneling can take place within a band @xmath121 of @xmath38-coordinates around @xmath37 , then the induced electron - hole correlations will be averaged accordingly .",
    "we see that the averaged pairing will be suppressed as soon as @xmath122 and drop to zero for large @xmath123 . since @xmath124 is of the order of the lattice spacing in the superconductor , any realistic setup will be in the regime where @xmath122",
    ". however , as long as the suppression is not too severe , the order of magnitude of the interwire pairing term will still be @xmath125 .",
    "we now would like to include electron - electron interactions into our model , and see how their presence affects the superconducting correlations induced in the wires . to describe the interactions",
    ", we use the mean - field hamiltonian ( [ eq : heemf ] ) which includes only _ intra_wire contact interaction , only between electrons with opposite spin . in this section",
    "we will thus focus again on a single wire .",
    "the first ( hartree ) term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : heemf ] ) leads to an energy shift of the electrons and holes that can be accounted for by an appropriate shift of the chemical potential .",
    "we will disregard this term and take the chemical potential as a fixed parameter , leaving us with @xmath126 the effect of this mean - field hamiltonian is an extra term in the self - energy of the electrons and holes in the wire , @xmath127 with @xmath128 where @xmath129 are again fermionic matsubara frequencies .",

    "this would require adding a term @xmath210 to the wire hamiltonian ( [ eq : hwire ] ) , where we chose the spin quantization axis along the direction of the effective spin - orbit field .",
    "this extra term can equivalently be produced by introducing a spin - dependent momentum shift , @xmath211 , with @xmath212 and an appropriate shift of the chemical potential @xmath207 .",
    "however , due to the contact interaction assumed in our model , the interaction self - energy ( [ eq : seint ] ) contains a sum over all momenta and the momentum shift is thus irrelevant .",
    "if we furthermore take @xmath207 as measured from the band edge , then there is no difference in results at all .",
    "finally , one could question the accurateness of modeling the interaction energy as a contact interaction .",
    "a rough estimate for the actual screening length in the wires is given by their diameter .",
    "for wires with a diameter of @xmath213 50100 nm , the corresponding energy scale @xmath2140.6 mev is indeed not very large and might compete with other relevant energy scales in the system . as a very crude method to gain some insight in the effects of a finite screening length",
    ", one could investigate the self - energy @xmath133 to first order in @xmath215 , i.e.  evaluate eq .",
    "( [ eq : sc3 ] ) with @xmath216 on the r.h.s .",
    "assuming that @xmath217 is frequency - independent , we can perform the sum over matsubara frequencies as well as the integral over momenta ( using a constant density of states for the wire and assuming @xmath218 ) . with a cut - off energy @xmath9 and cut - off momentum @xmath219",
    ", we can evaluate the function @xmath220 explicitly for small @xmath221 .",
    "we find in the small-@xmath12 limit @xmath222 with @xmath223 .",
    "we have per definition @xmath224 ( otherwise all integrals would be cut off at @xmath9 ) .",
    "we thus see that as long as @xmath225 ( which corresponds to @xmath226 ) the effect is negligible and ( [ eq : zeta ] ) reduces to @xmath227 , which agrees with our previous results to first order in @xmath11 . for @xmath228 the suppression of the self - energy",
    "is given by the full expression given above , and for @xmath229 , we find @xmath230 .",
    "we see that @xmath228 , where a finite screening length becomes important , corresponds to @xmath231 we always assume that @xmath218 so the regime where finite - range interactions can be neglected corresponds to @xmath232 .",
    "our basic assumption that the wire can be considered quasi - one - dimensional thus automatically pushes us to the regime where the screening length can be safely set to zero .",
    "we have investigated in detail the effect of electron - electron interactions on the proximity - induced superconducting correlations in a one - dimensional nanowire .",
    "we treated the interactions in the wire on a self - consistent mean - field level , and found an analytic expression for the resulting effective pairing , valid for a weakly tunnel coupled wire ( @xmath148 ) .",
    "inspired by the theoretical proposal that a system of _ two _ nanowires coupled to the same @xmath0-wave superconductor can be driven into a time - reversal symmetric topologically non - trivial phase if the effective",
    "_ inter_wire pairing @xmath6 exceeds the _ intra_wire pairings @xmath173 , we also derived an expression for the proximity - induced interwire pairing , which was found to decay with increasing interwire distance @xmath16 . combining these results , we translated the requirement @xmath233 for creating a topologically non - trivial phase into a maximal distance between two parallel wires @xmath234 , which sets a clear boundary for experiments .",
    "the requirement @xmath235 is of course more severe than just @xmath148 , but this is the only regime in which analytic results could be produced .",
    "results for @xmath236 should thus be interpreted in a more qualitative sense ."
