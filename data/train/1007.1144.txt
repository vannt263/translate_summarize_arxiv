    "the dynamical and collisional evolution of planetesimals is a fundamental issue which needs to be understood if progress is to be made in developing a theory of planetary system formation . according to the core accretion theory , a process which begins with the collision and sticking of small dust grains within a protoplanetary disc leads eventually to the formation of kilometre sized planetesimals @xcite . although alternative scenarios have been put forward for planetesimal formation @xcite , which avoid the requirement for such large bodies to grow _ via _ simple two - body agglomeration processes , the further growth of planetesimals into planetary embryos and cores generally requires planetesimals themselves to accrete _ via _ mutual collisions through a process of runaway growth , followed by oligarchic growth @xcite .",
    "rapid runaway growth requires that the velocity dispersion of the planetesimal swarm remains significantly smaller than the escape velocity from the surfaces of the largest accreting planetesimals , ensuring that gravitational focusing is important . for bodies of radius @xmath1 , and with internal densities",
    "@xmath18 , the escape velocity is @xmath19 , and scales linearly with radius .",
    "clearly this is a stringent requirement , which is easily met within a self  stirring planetesimal swarm whose size distribution is reasonably shallow , but which may be difficult to satisfy in the presence of an external source of stirring .",
    "one such source may be turbulence within the protoplanetary disc .",
    "planetary growth times which rely on mutual collisions between planetesimals occurring at rates which are determined by the geometric cross section are prohibitively long , leading to estimated planetary growth times which are much in excess of typical protostellar disc life times @xcite .",
    "a further constraint during the runaway growth phase is that collisional velocities should be small enough to avoid catastrophic disruption of planetesimals . for bodies in the 1 - @xmath1 size range ,",
    "for which self  gravity starts to become more important than material strength in holding planetesimals together , collisions between similar sized bodies with impact speeds which are modestly in excess of the escape velocity will lead to break up of the planetesimals rather that accretion and growth . indeed @xcite suggest that mutual collisions between @xmath11 sized bodies will result in catastrophic disruption if the impact speeds exceed @xmath20 , depending on the material composition of the impactors . in a more recent study , @xcite suggest reduced impact speeds of @xmath21 will be destructive . once again , we see that an external source of planetesimal stirring may prevent the rapid growth of planetary mass bodies by the accretion of planetesimals .    the canonical mass accretion rate for t tauri stars is @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "such accretion rates require a source of anomalous disc viscosity and angular momentum transport to operate , generally thought to be turbulence .",
    "the most likely source of disc turbulence is the magneto - rotational instability ( mri , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which has been shown to develop into full non linear mhd turbulence in numerous studies , using both local shearing box simulations @xcite , and global simulations @xcite .",
    "the nature and saturation state of mhd turbulence generated by the mri is the subject of on - going study . in this work ,",
    "we use the dependence of the turbulent stresses and density fluctuation amplitude on the strength of the net component of the magnetic field to examine the evolution of planetesimals in discs with different levels of turbulence .",

    "@xcite performed global simulations of low mass planets embedded in turbulent discs .",
    "they showed that such bodies are subject to fluctuating torques which should induce stochastic migration , and suggested that this might provide a means of mitigating against the rapid type i migration expected to occur for low mass planets @xcite .",
    "@xcite published a similar study using analytical fits to mhd simulations , and reached similar conclusions .",
    "@xcite presented results from both global and local shearing box simulations containing both high and low mass planets , and showed good agreement between the simulation set - ups for predicting the transition between linear and non linear disc response to the presence of an embedded planet . in a follow - up paper , examined the orbital evolution of low mass embedded planets , showing that over simulations run times of @xmath23 orbits , turbulence induces stochastic migration for planets in the range 1  10 m@xmath24 , and induces the growth of orbital eccentricity . in more recent work ,",
    "@xcite examined the stochastic forces experienced by planets in stratified disc models with and without dead zones using shearing box simulations , and @xcite examined the orbital evolution of swarms of test particles embedded in non stratified turbulent discs .",
    "a significant volume of related work has examined the influence of disc turbulence on embedded planets and planetesimals using prescriptions or simple models for the effects of turbulence .",

    "a key issue that we explore is the set of conditions and numerical parameters that provide good agreement between local shearing box simulations and global simulations .",
    "we find that it is possible to obtain good agreement between these two numerical set - ups , provided that the shearing box dimensions are chosen appropriately .",
    "other important issues that we examine include the growth of the velocity dispersion of embedded swarm of planetesimals , and the saturation value of this velocity dispersion as a function of planetesimal size due to a balance being achieved between gas drag and turbulent forcing .",
    "we explore the implications of our results for the efficiency of runaway growth of planetary embryos , and the possibility that planetesimals may enter a phase of catastrophic disruption through mutual collisions .",
    "we also examine the rate at which planetesimals migrate due to both gas drag induced radial drift @xcite , and due to diffusion caused by the fluctuating gravitational field of the turbulent disc .",
    "we examine under which conditions each of these processes are dominant , and we explore the implications of our results for the radial drift of planetesimals in the solar nebula and limits that might be placed on the magnitude of turbulent fluctuations which were present during the early phases of solar system formation .",

    "a major goal of this work is to compare the results of these two different approaches .",
    "a key question that needs to be addressed is for what dimensions of the the shearing box , in units of the local scale height @xmath3 , do density fluctuations created by the turbulence reach a converged amplitude and spectrum , and do these match the results of global models . to make the comparison as straightforward as possible , we neglect vertical stratification and assume an isothermal equation of state .    in both configurations ,",
    "the hydromagnetic turbulence is driven via the non - linear development of the magneto - rotational instability . at present , the issue of the saturated amplitude of mri turbulence remains unresolved and is a topic of active research . in the absence of a better alternative",
    ", we therefore adopt a practical perspective and impose a net vertical or azimuthal flux , for which numerical convergence can be obtained @xcite . neglecting the dependence on the magnetic prandtl number @xcite , we furthermore restrict ourselves to the case of ideal mhd .",
    "this approach is justified by the observed correlation between the strength of the turbulence and the amplitude of the resulting density fluctuations @xcite .",
    "this means that we regard the strength of the imposed field as a control parameter which can be tuned to vary the turbulence amplitude in the local and global context .",
    "the global cylindrical disc models are computed with a modified version of the original finite difference code nirvana@xcite . for the local shearing box models ,",

    "because the gas drag forces acting on massive particles depend on the actual physical value of the gas density , we have to prescribe a set of conversion factors to link our model to a representative protoplanetary disc .",

    "the adequate modelling of the mri with finite volume codes depends on the reconstruction strategy used and , in particular , on the ability of the riemann solver to capture the alfvn mode . to improve the treatment of discontinuities in the godunov scheme ,",

    "3.2 of @xcite , this approach however lacks the required directional biasing to guarantee the stability of the numerical scheme .",
    "it has further been demonstrated by @xcite that this can lead to artificial growth of instabilities in the context of net - flux mri , and we have reproduced this result . to resolve this issue ,",
    "we have successfully implemented and tested the upwind reconstruction procedure of @xcite .    following the long - term evolution of a shearing flow in boxes of substantial radial extent",
    "puts high demands on computational resources . for a keplerian rotation profile ,",
    "the background flow becomes super - sonic for @xmath46 .",
    "this implies that for increasingly larger boxes the numerical time - step , defined by the courant condition , becomes dominated by the unperturbed shear profile . to circumvent this undesirable constraint ,",
    "it becomes mandatory to split - off the transport term due to the background profile .",
    "the shear transport is usually implemented in terms of an interpolation step .",
    "this was first introduced in cylindrical geometry and termed fargo by .",
    "later , the method was adopted to the local shearing box model by @xcite .",
    "a rather intricate extension for the induction equation that requires mapping of the magnetic field components has been proposed by @xcite .",
    "we here follow the ( much simpler ) constrained transport approach proposed by @xcite , which by construction preserves the solenoidal constraint .    for our implementation of the orbital advection scheme , we operator - split the advection step from the runge - kutta time integration of the remaining terms .",
    "for the interpolation of the fluid variables , we make use of the high - order fourier scheme ( safi ) described in appendix  b of @xcite .",
    "we similarly apply safi to obtain the non - integer part of the line - integrals which contribute the circulation of the electric fields entering the induction equation ( cf .",

    "the treatment of the magnetic source term in the total energy equation can be successfully avoided if the magnetic energy is removed from the total energy during the interpolation .",
    "the implementation has been tested with the advection of a field loop @xcite , and the exact wave solution given in @xcite .    using safi rather than slope - limited linear interpolation ,",
    "efficiently reduces the dissipation due to the transport step , and moreover its dependence on position ( see * ? ? ?",
    "in fact the scheme adds so little dissipation that the tvd requirement might be violated . to formally make the interpolation total variation diminishing",
    ", we therefore discard the fourier mode corresponding to the nyquist frequency .      in this paper , we restrict ourselves to the study of how disc turbulence affects embedded particle populations . neglecting their back reaction on the flow , particles",

    "we ignore the possibility of increasing the velocity dispersion of particles via mutual gravitational scattering .",
    "while this effect might become important for @xmath47-sized objects , it simply adds to the external stirring .",
    "physical collisions between planetesimals , however , can provide a source of damping .",
    "this effect was considered by @xcite , and was found to be important in determining the equilibrium velocity dispersion only for bodies with size @xmath48 , and so we do not consider this effect in this paper . moreover , because the particles can not exert drag forces on the gas , our approach excludes collective effects such as the streaming instability @xcite , which is a focus of current numerical studies @xcite .",
    "we include different species of particles to quantify various aspects of the flow .",
    "firstly , massless tracer particles ( which instantaneously follow the gas velocity ) measure the lagrangian diffusion of the flow .",
    "this is relevant for small dust grains which are tightly coupled to the gas .",
    "secondly , we include particles representing planetesimals .",
    "these particles interact with the flow _ via _ the gravitational potential produced by the gas density , and through the aerodynamic drag force .",
    "the relative importance of these effects is expected to change for planetesimals in the size range @xmath0 to @xmath1 , which are the subject of this study . finally , for the purpose of comparison , and as a proxy for larger objects ( e.g. small protoplanets )",
    ", we include swarms of particles which experience gas gravity but are not subject to an aerodynamic drag force . with the exception of the tracers , all particles are subject to the local dynamics ,",
    "i.e. , they experience the coriolis force in the rotating frame and the tidal force stemming from the local expansion of the keplerian rotation profile . as a consequence ,",
    "planetesimals generally perform epicyclic oscillations of fluctuating amplitude , around a stochastically migrating guiding centre .",
    "in the global simulations we solve essentially the same set of equations for ideal mhd as described in sect .  [",
    "sec : local - model ] for the shearing box runs , except that we adopt cylindrical coordinates ( @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath28 ) ( see for a full description ) .",
    "the simulations are performed in a rotating frame with angular frequency equal to the keplerian frequency at the midpoint of the radial computational domain .",

    "* ) , in which the gravitational potential is taken to depend on @xmath49 alone .",
    "thus the cylindrical disc models do not include a full treatment of the disc vertical structure .",
    "models of this type are employed due to the high computational overhead that would be required to resolve fully the disc vertical structure of a stratified model .",
    "the global simulations presented in this paper were performed using an older version of nirvana , which uses an algorithm very similar to the zeus code to solve the equations of ideal mhd @xcite .",

    "advection is performed using the second - order monotonic transport scheme @xcite , and the magnetic field is evolved using the method of characteristics constrained transport @xcite .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to examine the orbital evolution of planetesimals and smaller bodies ( boulders ) in turbulent discs , where the disc turbulence has achieved a well - defined steady state .",
    "another aim is to compare local shearing box runs with global simulations . to achieve these aims ,",
    "most of the global disc models were chosen to have a relatively narrow radial extent , and azimuthal domains running between @xmath54 .",
    "the turbulent stresses generated within a global disc lead to significant changes in the radial density distribution , such that the properties of the disc deviate substantially from a statistical steady state over runs times of 100s of orbits @xcite . in order to overcome this ,",
    "we have introduced an additional equation to be solved alongside eqs .",

    "clearly if @xmath59 is shorter then any relevant local dynamical time in the disc , then perturbations will be damped very quickly and the disc will not be able to achieve a turbulent state . similarly ,",
    "if @xmath59 is much longer than the longest ( viscous ) evolution time in the disc , the global density profile will be able to evolve to be very different from the initial one . by choosing @xmath59 to be intermediate between these two extremes",

    "we have found that @xmath61 orbits measured at the radial midpoint of the disc model provides a model with the desired properties .",
    "a possible alternative to solving eq .  ( [ massadd ] ) would be to feed in mass at the outer radial boundary at the requisite rate .",
    "such an approach works well as a means of generating a steady disc when the disc is laminar and employs the @xmath32-model for viscosity . in a turbulent disc , where there is substantial temporal and spatial variation in the viscous stress ,",
    "however , such an approach may not be effective at maintaining a well - defined surface density profile .",

    "one important conclusion of their work is that a minimum azimuthal extent @xmath131 is required to properly capture the dynamics of spiral waves .",
    "this is exactly what we see when looking at the autocorrelation function ( acf ) of the vertically integrated density , as plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : rho_acf ] . here",
    "the thick black line indicates the contour where the correlation falls off to @xmath130 , and we see that density structures are predominantly trailing waves with an azimuthal extent of about six pressure scale heights .",
    "the aspect ratio of the approximate ellipse is about one sixth , indicating that convergence in the radial direction should be obtained much earlier ( cf .",
    "right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : boxsz_trq ] ) .    returning to fig .",
    "[ fig : boxsz_mhd ] , we see that this requirement is reflected in the relative rms density fluctuations @xmath132 measured in the saturated turbulent state ( uppermost curve in fig .  [",
    "fig : boxsz_mhd ] ) . increasing the box size from @xmath133 to @xmath134 , results in an increase of @xmath135 in the relative rms fluctuations .",
    "this is considerably larger than the @xmath136 increase found by @xcite , who performed a similar study .",
    "as the authors themselves mention , even this not particularly dramatic effect seems to strongly affect particle stirring .",
    "this can be understood when taking into account the central finding of the simulations undertaken in @xcite , namely that spiral density waves quickly grow into the non - linear regime where they develop steep shock - like features .",
    "it seems natural that the resulting intermittent density structure creates highly fluctuating torques , gravitationally enhancing the turbulent velocity dispersion of embedded planetesimals .",
    "we examine this issue in more detail in sect .",
    "[ sec : torques ] below .",
    "prior to inserting the planetesimals in the global disc models , we allow the mri to develop into quasi - steady non linear mhd turbulence , with well defined volume averaged stresses operating .",
    "an example of the time history of the maxwell , reynolds and total volume averaged stress ( taken from model g0/g1 ) is presented in fig .",
    "[ alphaplot1 ] , and the total stress generated in each of the models as a function of time is shown in fig .",
    "[ alphaplot2 ] .",
    "it is clear that the models have evolved to a quasi - steady state .",
    "the turbulence generates a distribution of density and surface density fluctuations which are well fitted by gaussian distributions .",
    "the computed standard deviations for these gaussian fits ( which we denote as @xmath137 and @xmath138 ) , are tabulated in table  [ table1 ] for each disc model , along with the time averaged stress parameter @xmath32 . as can be seen from table  [ table1 ] , our models generate @xmath32 values in the range @xmath139 , with corresponding rms values for @xmath140 in the range @xmath141 .    in terms of physical parameters , the global model which is most similar to the shearing box simulation is run g5 .",
    "we see that @xmath142 in fig .  [",
    "fig : boxsz_mhd ] for the shearing box simulation , whereas @xmath143 for model g5 because of the differing magnetic field topologies and strengths .",

    "[ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      for the diffusion of the guiding centres .",
    "the diffusion coefficient is estimated via @xmath146 , where @xmath147 is obtained by smoothing over the epicycles ( _ solid lines _ ) .",
    "an alternative estimate ( _ open squares _ ) is derived independently via the coefficients @xmath148 in tab .",
    "[ tab : rwalk ]  note that these do not depend on any form of smoothing . ]    given we can obtain a good estimate for the rms velocity of the guiding centres , we can then compute @xmath149 . looking at fig .",
    "[ fig : xdisp ] , it seems less than straightforward to deconvolve the random motion of the guiding centre from the overall motion , especially since the amplitude of the epicycles changes on comparable time scales . as a first attempt , we simply smooth - out the oscillations applying a box - car filter in time . the thus derived schmidt number @xmath150 as a function of particle size is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : sc_epi ] for various values of the filter size .",
    "if we omit the smoothing , the results ( although not strictly correct ) reflect the kinetic energy in the epicyclic mode itself . in this case , the gradual decoupling of the particles implies that @xmath151 decreases while @xmath152 increases accordingly .",
    "interestingly , this leaves the overall particle diffusion rate unchanged .",
    "if we increase the filter size , the epicyclic motion is attenuated and the size dependence gradually becomes steeper .",
    "reasonable convergence is obtained when the filter size approaches the critical value , equal to the epicyclic period . in tab .",
    "[ tab : schmidt ] we list the corresponding numbers .",
    "note that already for metre - sized objects the particle diffusivity is reduced relative to lagrangian tracers .",
    "we attribute this to the effect that part of the kinetic energy is absorbed in ordered epicyclic motion and is thus not available for particle diffusion ( cf .",
    "sect .  3.2 in * ? ? ?",
    "the partial slippage of the particles through the gas as a result of weaker drag acceleration also causes the particle guiding centre velocities to be reduced relative to the fluid turbulent velocities .",
    "it might be seen as a deficiency of the approach that it depends on the proper choice of a box - car filter function . to reinforce the validity of the derived schmidt numbers , we therefore provide an independent estimate from the squares of the coefficients @xmath153 from fig .",
    "[ fig : rwalk ] . defining the growing spread in the particles position with time , these can similarly be interpreted as a diffusion constant . for consistency",
    ", we have also checked that the fit constants @xmath153 do not change significantly , when the epicyclic part of the motion is smoothed . considering that this second estimate solely relies on positions while the original one is derived from velocity correlations , the agreement seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : sc_epi ] ( where we plot the different estimates for the schmidt number ) is quite striking .",
    "we have presented results from both local and global mhd simulations which examine the evolution of planetesimals and boulders of different size embedded in turbulent protoplanetary disc models .",
    "the main aims of this work are to : determine the magnitude of the velocity dispersion which is excited in a planetesimal swarm ; determine the rate of radial diffusion of the planetesimals ; determine under which conditions broad agreement is obtained in the results from local shearing box simulations and global disc simulations .",
    "we find that the magnitude of density fluctuations , and the associated stochastic forces experienced by embedded planetesimals is sensitive to the dimensions of shearing box models .",
    "this appears to be related to the fact that accurate modelling of the excitation and non - linear steepening of spiral density waves requires boxes which are elongated in the azimuthal direction @xcite .",
    "the two - point correlation function for the perturbed surface density also shows that coherent structures stretched by a distance @xmath154 are a common feature of mhd turbulence in discs , indicating that shearing boxes in excess of this length scale are required to prevent the premature truncation of the gravitational field which results from these structures .",
    "in addition to the magnitude of the stochastic torques being dependent on the box size , we also found that the correlation time of the fluctuating torques also depends on the box size and aspect ratio , with smaller boxes generating shorter correlation times .",
    "this is apparently due to the ability of waves to propagate across the box on multiple occasions due to the periodic boundary conditions employed , combined with the rate at which they shear past the planet due to the background flow .",
    "shearing boxes with dimensions @xmath155 were found to provide converged results which agree well with the results from global simulations .",
    "we find that both global simulations and local shearing box simulations predict that rapid excitation of planetesimal random velocities is expected in fully turbulent disc models whose local surface densities are similar to the minimum mass solar nebula .",
    "a model whose turbulent stresses generate @xmath156 leads to rapid growth of the radial velocity dispersion , @xmath4 , _ via _ a random walk , such that after 1200 orbits at @xmath13 @xmath157 .",
    "a model with weaker turbulence ( @xmath158 ) gave rise to @xmath159 over the same evolution time .",
    "these random velocities are much larger than either the escape velocities from planetesimals with sizes @xmath11 or @xmath1 , or the catastrophic disruption thresholds for collisions between bodies of similar size @xcite , suggesting that planetesimal collisions occurring in fully turbulent discs similar to those considered in this paper will result in destruction of the planetesimals .",
    "we find that the expected equilibrium velocity dispersion for @xmath1 sized planetesimals scales weakly with the turbulent stress parameter such that @xmath160 .",
    "extrapolation of the simulation results presented in this paper to low values of @xmath32 suggest that even with @xmath161 , bodies with size @xmath1 are likely to have random velocities which will cause catastrophic disruption during mutual collisions .",
    "values of @xmath4 small enough to allow runaway growth of planetesimals to occur will be even more difficult to achieve . for smaller bodies , which are more tightly coupled to the gas _ via _ gas drag , we find that the equilibrium velocity dispersion decreases , and reaches a minimum of @xmath162 for bodies of size @xmath163 in a disc with @xmath143 . for smaller bodies than these",
    "the increasing influence of gas drag causes the velocity dispersion to increase with decreasing size , and boulders with @xmath8 develop random velocities which closely match the turbulent gas motions .",
    "in addition to driving the growth of the velocity dispersion , or equivalently the eccentricity , the stochastic forces experienced by the planetesimals cause them to diffuse radially through the disc . for large planetesimals with @xmath164 , radial drift through the disc due to gas drag",
    "occurs very slowly , and their radial motion is expected to be dominated by diffusion caused by the stochastic gravitational field of the turbulent disc . indeed , after a putative disc life time of @xmath17 , the rms relative change in semimajor axis , @xmath165 for a planetesimal swarm located at @xmath13 in a disc with @xmath143 will be 50% , which would have been sufficient to cause large scale migration of the small body populations of the solar system during its formation .",
    "the fact that such large scale migration of large planetesimals does not appear to have happened allows us to put constraints on the strength of @xmath32 in the solar nebula .",
    "a value of @xmath166 would lead to a more reasonable @xmath167 , consistent with the notion that the solar nebula had a dead zone in the region where planet formation took place .",
    "smaller planetesimals with @xmath168 - @xmath10 are expected to undergo large - scale radial drift due to gas drag , and this is observed in our simulations .",
    "the migration rate of @xmath85 size bodies in the turbulent discs , relative to that expected for an equivalent laminar disc model , is found to be very similar .",
    "migration in turbulent discs is found to be slower by a factor of approximately 2 - 3 , and this is due to radial structuring of the disc s density profile , creating regions where the pressure gradient ( and hence rotational velocity profile ) is modified .",
    "there have been a number of previous studies of the dynamical evolution of planetary bodies embedded in turbulent discs .",
    "@xcite examined the torques experienced by low mass planets and suggested that random walk behaviour for such bodies should be expected , as has been observed in this paper . examined the orbital evolution of planets embedded in turbulent discs , with particular emphasis on the semimajor axis and eccentricity changes",
    "the strength of the turbulence in that model was somewhat weaker than considered in this paper ( @xmath169 ) , although the disc model was somewhat more massive , and in general it was found that the response of embedded bodies to the stochastic forcing was stronger in that study , with larger changes in semimajor axis and eccentricity being observed .",
    "the primary reason for this discrepancy appears to be the fact that a persistent vortex formed in the disc model considered by .",
    "such vortices were also reported in the work of @xcite , and interaction between embedded bodies and such structures can lead to significant modification of the semimajor axes and excitation of eccentricity .",
    "the models presented in this paper do not have such vortex features , but during the early stages of this project disc models with lower values of @xmath32 were found to generate such flow features quite readily .",
    "one possibility is that global disc models which are close to the limits of resolving the mri generate substantial variations in @xmath32 as a function of radius , which in turn generate localised pressure maxima which are particularly prone to the formation of vortices @xcite .",
    "models with smaller values of the plasma @xmath33 parameter have stronger field strengths and thus resolve the mri more easily , and in addition the stronger fields may act to inhibit vortex formation through the action of local magnetic stresses . it is these models that we have considered in this paper .",
    "@xcite recently considered the evolution of planetesimal swarms using non stratified shearing box simulations .",
    "the planetesimals in that study experienced the fluctuating gravitational field of the disc , but did not experience gas drag forces .",
    "although random walk behaviour of the particles in that study was observed , in general it was found to be significantly weaker than we report here , and",
    "one conclusion reached by these authors is that turbulence is unlikely to cause the catastrophic disruption of planetesimals .",
    "the primary reason for this appears to be the fact that most simulations performed by @xcite used shearing boxes with @xmath170 .",
    "test calculations with larger boxes presented in that paper indicated a strong increase in the response of the particles to the turbulence forcing as a function of increasing box size , suggesting that the main reason for the discrepancy in our results is due to this effect .",
    "@xcite recently considered the evolution of planetesimals embedded in turbulent protoplanetary discs by means of n - body simulations combined with a prescription for planetesimal stirring based on the work of @xcite . in basic agreement with the results we have presented in this paper , they show that turbulence leads to the excitation of a large velocity dispersion , which is likely to cause catastrophic disruption of planetesimals rather than growth following mutual collisions , for a wide range of turbulent strengths .",
    "the simulations we have presented here use the simplest possible numerical set - up : ideal mhd in non stratified disc models . in a future paper",
    "we will present the results of a similar study using vertically stratified models with and without dead zones . this future study will tell us whether we need to examine new paradigms for the rapid growth of planetesimals , or whether instead runaway growth can indeed occur within a dead zone of an otherwise turbulent protoplanetary disc .",
