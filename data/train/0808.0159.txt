    "the simplex algorithm @xcite is the fastest general algorithm for solving linear problems . while efficient in the typical case , the deterministic simplex algorithm requires an exponential time in the worst cases @xcite .",
    "randomized versions of the simplex algorithm have an improved running time that is quadratic in the number of inequalities .",
    "the performance of the random edge simplex algorithm on klee - minty cubes @xcite ultimately reduces to a simple asymmetric flipping process in one dimension @xcite . in this process , an infinite sequence of 0 and 1 bits evolves by flipping randomly chosen 1 bits and simultaneously flipping all bits to the right .",
    "figure [ fig - flip ] illustrates how the underlined bit flips all bits to the right .",
    "when flips occur at a constant and spatially uniform rate , the position of the left - most 1 bit moves to the right at a constant average velocity .",
    "previous formal studies were primarily concerned with establishing the ballistic front motion rigorously @xcite , yet most of the questions concerning the flipping process , including the propagation velocity , remain largely unanswered .",
    "we approach this random process as a nonequilibrium dynamics problem and by utilizing a host of theoretical and computational methods , we find that this directed flipping process exhibits interesting phenomenology beyond the ballistic front propagation .",
    "we also propose a modified process where front propagation is forbidden and show that this process , for which further theoretical analysis is possible , provides an excellent quantitative description .",
    "our starting point is a quasi - static approximation . in this description",
    ", the shape of the propagating front is assumed to be fixed and additionally , spatial correlations are ignored .",
    "this approximation yields a qualitative description for the overall shape of the front and an exact description for the shape far away from the front .",
    "the propagating front consists of a depletion zone as the number of 0 bits exceeds the number of 1 bits , and the cumulative depletion grows logarithmically with distance from the front .",
    "direct numerical simulations of the flipping process reveal that spatial and temporal correlations are substantial . in general , neighboring bits are correlated as manifested by the increased likelihood of finding consecutive strings of identical bits .",
    "there are also aging and rejuvenation .",
    "the state of the system strongly depends on age , defined as the time elapsed since the most recent front advancement event . in particular , young fronts are more rapid than old front .",
    "we also develop a formal solution method that describes the evolution of a finite segment that includes the front . in this approach ,",
    "the time evolution of all microscopic configurations of a finite segment is described under the assumption that the system is completely random outside the segment .",
    "the predictions improve systematically as the segment size increases but there is a limitation since the number of configurations grows exponentially with segment size .",
    "nevertheless , we are able to obtain accurate estimates for quantities of interest including the propagation velocity by using shanks extrapolation .    in the directed flipping process",
    ", the system does not reach a steady state because of the perpetual motion of the front , yet when the front is pinned , the system does settle into a steady state .",
    "we therefore also examined a modified process in which the flipping of the leftmost bit is forbidden .",
    "remarkably , this pinned front process provides an excellent quantitative approximation of the original propagating front process . in this case , we are able to obtain several exact results . for example , we can show that a pair of neighboring sites is correlated .",
    "moreover , the small system solution is now exact and combined with the shanks transformation , yields excellent results for the velocity .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , titled `` propagating fronts '' , we investigate the original flipping process .",
    "we begin with a quasi - static approximation for the shape of the front , continue with numerical simulations that elucidate spatial and temporal correlations , and finish with analysis of small segments . in section iii , titled `` pinned fronts '' , we examine the corresponding behaviors in a modified flipping process where the front is pinned and hence further theoretical analysis is possible .",
    "conclusions are presented in section iv .",
    "the flipping process takes place on an infinite one - dimensional lattice whose sites may be in one of two states .",
    "if @xmath3 denotes the state of @xmath4th site then @xmath5 corresponds to an occupied site , a 1-bit , and @xmath6 corresponds to a vacant site , a 0-bit .",
    "in the flipping process , each occupied site may `` flip '' from the occupied state to the vacant state and consequently cause all sites to the right to simultaneously change their state .",
    "for example , when the @xmath7th site flips , @xmath8 the flipping process is uniform : all occupied sites flip at a uniform rate , set to one without loss of generality .",
    "note that the interaction range is infinite : every flip event affects an infinite number of sites !",
    "this is in contrast , for example , with constrained spin dynamics such as the east model @xcite where the flipping is caused only by the neighboring spin on the left .",
    "vacant sites with no occupied sites to their left remain vacant forever .",
    "moreover , the left - most occupied site defines a front that advances to the right , as shown in figure 1 .",
    "we consider the natural initial condition where all sites left of the origin are vacant , @xmath9 for all @xmath10 , the origin is occupied @xmath11 , and all sites right of the origin are randomly occupied : with equal probabilities @xmath12 or @xmath9 for all @xmath13 .",
    "we index the system using a reference frame that is moving with the front . specifically , we characterize lattice sites by their distance @xmath2 from the front , and by definition , @xmath14 .",
    "the profile of the advancing front is best described by the density @xmath15 , the average occupation at distance @xmath2 from the front at time @xmath16 , @xmath17 , where the brackets indicate an average over all realizations of the random process .",
    "our theoretical description involves two simplifying assumptions . if we overlook the motion of the front , the densities satisfy @xmath18 for @xmath19 .",
    "the gain term on the right - hand size accounts for vacant sites changing into occupied sites and conversely , the loss term represents occupied sites changing into vacant sites .",
    "since every occupied site to the left can cause a vacant site to change , the gain rate at the @xmath2th site equals the total number of occupied sites to the left . the loss rate , however , is larger by one because a flip at the site itself can also cause an occupied site to change .",
    "the evolution equations are hierarchical : the equation for one - site averages involves two - sites averages , the equation for two - site averages involves three - site averages , etc .",
    "if we ignore possible correlations between different sites and approximate two - site averages by the product of the respective single site averages @xmath20 , the densities satisfy the closed equation @xmath21 the flipping rates in equations - reflect the fact that occupied sites change at a higher rate than vacant sites .",
    ", obtained from the quasi - static approximation.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    our final assumption is that in the reference frame moving with the front , the system is quasi - static . indeed , by definition @xmath22 , and we further assume for all @xmath2 .",
    "the stationary density profile is @xmath23 this recursive equation is solved subject to the boundary condition @xmath24 . for small @xmath2 we have @xmath25     versus distance @xmath2 .",
    "the simulations are in a system of size @xmath26.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    despite the crude simplifying assumptions , this quasi - static approximation provides the following valuable insights ( see figure [ fig - ck ] ) :    1 .   _ depletion . _ with the exception of the occupied front , all sites are more likely to be vacant , @xmath27 for all @xmath19 . in other words ,",
    "the propagating front includes a depletion zone .",
    "this depletion is a direct consequence of the fact that occupied sites change at a higher rate than vacant sites .",
    "in other words , vacant sites have a larger lifetime .",
    "2 .   _ monotonicity_. the density profile is monotonic , @xmath28 for @xmath29 .",
    "the tail of the density profile can be obtained by noting that @xmath30 as follows from .",
    "consequently , the average total `` mass '' to the left of a given site , , grows linearly with distance , @xmath31 . at large distances ,",
    "the recursion equation for the density @xmath32 can be re - written as @xmath33 and therefore , @xmath34 far away from the front , sites are occupied at random as @xmath35 for @xmath36 .",
    "indeed , sites at the tail change their state extremely rapidly at rates that grow linearly with distance .",
    "these rapid changes effectively destroy spatial correlations .",
    "moreover , the advancement of the front becomes irrelevant at large distances .",
    "hence , the two assumptions underlying our theory are inconsequential in the tail region and is in fact exact .",
    "we comment that the algebraic tail is unusual because traveling waves are typically characterized by exponential tails @xcite .",
    "the cumulative expected excess of vacant sites over occupied sites , @xmath37 , measures the extent of the depletion zone .",
    "this quantity follows from the tail behavior , @xmath38 , and since , the excess of vacant sites grows logarithmically with distance , @xmath39 thus , the total excess of vacant sites is divergent !",
    "we confirmed the theoretical predictions for the algebraic tail and the logarithmic growth of the excess using massive monte carlo simulations ( figure 2 ) .",
    "the numerical simulations are straightforward . in each simulation step",
    "one site is chosen at random . if this site is occupied , the state of the site and all sites to the right change according to , but otherwise , nothing happens . after each step ,",
    "time is augmented by the inverse of the system size @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the number of sites in the lattice . in our implementation , the front is always located at the zeroth site , @xmath14 . whenever the front advances by @xmath42 sites , all lattice sites are appropriately shifted to the left , @xmath43 ( the @xmath42 rightmost sites are reoccupied at random ) .",
    "subsequently , the front position is augmented by @xmath42 .",
    "this efficient implementation allows us to simulate the evolution of the system up to extremely large times .",
    "we can evolve a system of size @xmath44 up to time @xmath45 , and we obtain statistical averages from snapshots of the system taken at unit time intervals .     versus time @xmath16 .",
    "the results are from a monte carlo simulation in a system of size @xmath44 , evolved up to time @xmath45 .",
    "the inset shows the velocity @xmath46 versus time.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]      whenever the leftmost site flips , the front position @xmath47 advances by @xmath42 lattice sites , @xmath48 hence , the leftmost string of occupied sites governs the front propagation .",
    "like all other sites , the front flips at a unit rate , and consequently , the average front position grows ballistically , @xmath49 and the propagation velocity @xmath50 equals the average size of the leftmost occupied string @xmath51 .",
    "let @xmath52 be the probability that the leftmost @xmath42 lattice sites including the front are all occupied , @xmath53 the probability of finding a string of exact length @xmath42 as in is equal @xmath54 , and therefore the velocity is given by .",
    "consequently , the velocity equals the sum of string probabilities @xmath55    in the quasi - static approximation ( qsa ) , correlations between different sites are neglected , and hence , the string probability is a product over the corresponding densities , @xmath56 for @xmath57 while @xmath58 . with this approximate expression ,",
    "the propagation velocity is @xmath59 .",
    "we obtain the approximate velocity @xmath60 by substituting the densities from into and then summing numerically .",
    "the velocity obeys the obvious bounds @xmath61 .",
    "the lower bound reflects that the front must advance by at least one lattice site , and the upper bound corresponds to the completely random configuration , @xmath62 and @xmath63 .     versus the string length @xmath42 .",
    "the results are from a monte carlo simulation in a system of size @xmath64 , evolved up to time @xmath45.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the numerical simulations confirm that the front advances ballistically ( figure [ fig - xt ] ) but the propagation velocity is larger than the value predicted by the quasi - static approximation @xmath65 strong spatial correlations are primarily responsible for the discrepancy between and . indeed ,",
    "if we substitute the densities @xmath66 obtained from the monte carlo simulations into the product expression and perform the summation in , we obtain the value @xmath67 that is surprisingly close to the quasi - static approximation .",
    "we therefore conclude that spatial correlations between neighboring sites have a significant effect on the velocity .",
    "spatial structures and spatial correlations can be quantified in multiple ways and we focus on the likelihood of occupied strings @xmath52 .",
    "numerically , we find that this quantity decays exponentially ( figure [ fig - sn ] ) , @xmath68 as @xmath69 with @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "the quasi - static approximation yields much more rapid decay , @xmath72 and @xmath73 as follows from the algebraic tail and the product expression .",
    "of course , when sites are completely uncorrelated , one also has @xmath72 .",
    "the fact that @xmath74 is larger than @xmath75 reflects that the system is strongly correlated .",
    "there is a significant enhancement of strings of consecutively occupied sites and this enhancement is largely responsible for the larger velocity .",
    "even though spatial correlations are significant and affect quantities of interest such as the velocity , they are limited in extent as indicated by the exponential decay of the string likelihood .",
    "for this reason , numerical simulations may be performed in relatively small systems . given the spatial extent of strings shown in figure [ fig - sn ]",
    ", we performed the simulations using a relatively small system , @xmath64 .",
    "this system size is used throughout this investigation , unless noted otherwise .     versus age @xmath76.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "we also probed the correlation between two successive front `` jumps '' as a measure of temporal correlations .",
    "let @xmath42 and @xmath77 be the sizes of two consecutive jumps , respectively",
    ". if the front advances via a renewal process then @xmath78 . however , the numerical simulations yield @xmath79 while @xmath80 .",
    "thus , front advancement events are correlated , so the state of the system just after a jump is correlated with the state of the system just before a jump .    this temporal correlation affects , in particular , the diffusion coefficient @xmath81 that quantifies the uncertainty in the front position , @xmath82 numerically , we find @xmath83 .",
    "in contrast with the velocity that follows from average quantities such as the average segment density , the diffusion coefficient requires more detailed information about temporal correlations @xcite .    to further characterize the dynamics ,",
    "we define the age @xmath76 as the time elapsed since the most recent front jump . moreover , we define the age - dependent velocity @xmath84 as the average size of the leftmost string @xmath42 as in at age @xmath76 because this quantity governs the front propagation .",
    "the simulations show that the velocity rapidly decays with age ( figure [ fig - age ] ) . of course ,",
    "since long - living fronts outlive any of their occupied neighbors , @xmath85 as @xmath86 .",
    "aging fronts are therefore sluggish . in contrast , newly - born fronts are much more vigorous because @xmath87 .",
    "since the flipping process is completely random , the survival probability of a configuration decays exponentially with age .",
    "the average velocity in is the weighted integral of the age - dependent velocity @xmath88 and the weight equals the exponential survival probability .     versus distance @xmath2 at different ages.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "the age - dependence of the velocity implies that the shape of the front must also be age - dependent .",
    "we therefore measured the density profile @xmath89 , defined as the average occupation at distance @xmath2 from the front at age @xmath76 .",
    "we find interesting evolution with age .",
    "the profile of long - living fronts has a depletion zone and is qualitatively similar to the average profile discussed above , but the profile of newly born fronts has an enhancement of occupied sites over vacant sites ( figure [ fig - ckt ] ) .",
    "this rejuvenation is intuitive : the state of the system just after a jump is a mirror image of the state of the system just before the jump .",
    "long living fronts are followed by a large string of vacant sites , and these fronts are necessarily slow . yet , upon flipping , such sluggish fronts rejuvenate as the string of vacant sites become a string of occupied sites .",
    "interestingly , the density profile may even be non - monotonic at intermediate ages .",
    "in conclusion , the flipping process involves all the hallmarks of nonequilibrium dynamics including spatial correlations , temporal correlations , aging , and rejuvenation @xcite .",
    "we complete the analysis with a direct solution for the state of small segments containing the front .",
    "the @xmath2 leftmost sites can be in any one of @xmath90 possible configurations .",
    "the equations describing the configuration probabilities are hierarchical : due to the front motion , the state of small segments containing the front is coupled with the state of larger segments . to overcome this closure issue",
    ", we propose an approximation where the state of the system outside the segment of interest is completely random , as in our simulation method .",
    "clearly , this approximation becomes exact as @xmath36 .",
    "a segment of length two can be in one of two configurations : @xmath91 or @xmath92 .",
    "the respective probabilities @xmath93 and @xmath94 evolve according to    @xmath95    we explain the latter equation in detail .",
    "the loss rate in equals two because any of the two occupied sites may flip .",
    "if the front flips , there is advancement , and since the second site is occupied with probability @xmath75 , the gain terms are @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "the steady state solution is @xmath98 ; therefore @xmath99 .",
    "we denote by @xmath100 the velocity obtained from a segment of length @xmath2 .",
    "for @xmath101 we have @xmath102 since the front advances by one site when the front flips in the state @xmath91 , but it advances three sites in the state @xmath92 ( two sites plus an average of one , given the random occupation outside the segment ) .",
    "[ v - prop ]    .the velocity @xmath50 , obtained by successive iterations of the shanks transformation ( propagating fronts ) . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     in general , there are @xmath90 microscopic configurations in a system of size @xmath2 .",
    "we can compute the stationary probabilities for systems of size @xmath103 as detailed in appendix b. knowledge of these steady state probabilities yields the density @xmath66 , the string probability @xmath104 , and hence , an estimate for the velocity @xmath105 .",
    "the velocity , as well as other quantities of interest , can be obtained very accurately using the shanks transformation .",
    "we find @xmath106 , in perfect agreement with the monte carlo simulations as shown in table [ v - pin ] .",
    "we also examined the evolution with age and found that pinned and propagating fronts display very similar behaviors , as evident from the age - dependent density @xmath107 ( figure [ fig - ckt - compare ] ) .    for pinned fronts ,",
    "the zero age configuration is the exact mirror image of the configuration just before the flip and since the front flips at random , @xmath108 for all sites except the origin , @xmath19 .",
    "this expression demonstrates the enhancement of occupied sites for newly born configurations .",
    "aging can be conveniently studied using small systems . for the first site , we have @xmath109 and therefore , @xmath110 .",
    "the initial condition , follows from .",
    "therefore , @xmath111    for the first two sites , there are four configurations : @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 , and the respective probabilities evolve according to    [ p-2-eq - a ] @xmath116    these equations differ from in that flipping events caused by the front are excluded .",
    "the initial condition again mirrors the stationary state @xmath117 . by solving the evolution equations",
    ", the age - dependent density of the second site , @xmath118 , is @xmath119 already , we can justify the non - monotonic behavior seen in figures and : @xmath120 for @xmath121 with @xmath122 while @xmath123 for otherwise .",
    "in general , all densities exhibit a simple exponential decay with age , @xmath124 as @xmath86 .",
    "we conclude that pinned fronts faithfully capture aging and rejuvenation .     at different ages for pinned fronts ( broken lines ) and propagating fronts ( solid lines).,scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "in conclusion , we reformulated the bit flipping process underlying the simplex algorithm as a nonequilibrium dynamics problem and studied spatial and temporal properties using theoretical and computational methods .",
    "overall , we find that the infinite interaction range leads to rich phenomenology .",
    "there is a front that propagates ballistically with a nontrivial velocity that is governed by the length of the occupied strings containing the front .",
    "the propagating front includes a deep depletion zone : vacant sites outnumber occupied sites with the total excess of unoccupied sites growing logarithmically with depth .",
    "the flipping process is characterized by significant spatial correlations .",
    "for example , the likelihood of finding strings of consecutively occupied sites is strongly enhanced .",
    "the flipping process also exhibits nontrivial dynamics .",
    "successive front jumps are correlated and additionally , there are aging and rejuvenation as young fronts are fast but old fronts are slow . underlying this behavior is the fact that the state of the system just after a jump mirrors the state of the system just before a jump .",
    "we slightly modified the original flipping process by pinning the front .",
    "qualitatively and quantitatively , pinned fronts and propagating fronts are very close .",
    "we demonstrated analytically much of the interesting phenomenology including spatial correlations , aging , and rejuvenation for pinned fronts .",
    "aging is usually characterized by using two different times @xcite . here , in contrast , the time elapsed since the latest front yields a natural definition of age and a characterization of the dynamics that complements time itself .",
    "we comment that there is an alternative way of studying the density profile through an average _ at a given lattice site _ over all realizations @xcite . the corresponding average density @xmath125 reaches a stationary form once the average and the variance are taken into account , @xmath126 with @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "this approach has a disadvantage : the scaling function @xmath129 is dominated by fluctuations in the position of the front . in other words , the density profile @xmath66 is smeared because of diffusion .",
    "these less interesting diffusive fluctuations are suppressed when the front profile is probed in a reference frame moving with the front .",
    "we also presented a systematic solution method of small systems and successfully demonstrated how to extrapolate relevant parameters for infinite systems . yet , since the complexity grows exponentially with system size , such computations quickly become prohibitive .",
    "we have also seen how most quantities of interest require an infinite hierarchy of equations .",
    "finding an appropriate theoretical framework with closed evolution equations remains a formidable challenge .",
    "nevertheless , the pinned front process provides a powerful theoretical framework .",
