    "the equation of state of a one - component plasma ( ocp ) , i.e. of a system consisting of point - like charged particles , is of central importance for plasma theory@xcite .",

    "much interest in the plasma community has been focused on the limit of high plasma density ( or large plasma parameter ) , which defines the limit when the electrostatic interaction at average separation between two particles is much larger than thermal energy@xcite .",
    "this situation is , for example , realized in white dwarfs and the interior of large planets ( such as jupiter ) .",
    "our interest in plasmas comes mainly from the close analogy with colloidal and electrolyte solutions , which also consist of charged particles . very often in colloidal systems ,",
    "the concentration of charged species is rather low , such that a low - density expansion becomes meaningful .",
    "also , in addition to coulombic interactions , the excluded - volume interaction becomes important in colloidal and electrolyte systems , and therefore has to be included@xcite .",
    "the ocp without hard core interactions has been studied by a variety of methods@xcite .",
    "the first few terms in a low - density expansion of the free energy have been obtained by an explicit resummation of the mayer expansion@xcite .",
    "the ocp with hard cores has in the past been studied extensively with numerical and integral - equation methods@xcite . for the tcp ,",
    "the leading term in the free energy has been calculated by debye and hckel in their classical paper@xcite .",
    "the formal foundation for the rigorous thermodynamic treatment of a tcp including a hard - core interaction has been given by mayer@xcite and edwards@xcite , but to our knowledge , no systematic calculation of the low density expansion of the free energy has been performed .    in this article",
    ", we present a novel field - theoretic method which can be used to systematically calculate free energies and other quantities of interest for systems of charged hard - core particles in powers of particle densities .",
    "we apply this method both to the ocp and tcp in the presence of finite hard - core radii . in the limit of vanishing particle charges",

    "we recover the classical abe result for the ocp@xcite .",
    "the expansion coefficients of the tcp diverges in the limit of vanishing hard - core radius , due to the proliferation of bound particle pairs .",
    "much interest has been focused on the critical behavior of the tcp with hard core interactions(the so - called restricted primitive model , rpm)@xcite .",
    "our results demonstrate that the critical point of the rpm is not accessible by a low - density expansion .    in the next two sections we present our methods and calculations for the tcp and ocp with hard cores , respectively .",
