    "molecular line emission from galaxies at high redshift ( @xmath0@xmath122 ) has proven to be a unique tool to investigate the stellar mass buildup in the often heavily dust - enshrouded star - forming environments of massive galaxies at early cosmic times .",
    "molecular gas ( co ) was detected in 26 @xmath0@xmath122 quasar host galaxies to date ( see , e.g. , review by solomon & vanden bout @xcite ) , all of which are luminous in the rest - frame far infrared ( fir ; typically @xmath13@xmath1410@xmath15 ; e.g. , wang et al.@xcite ) .",
    "these studies typically reveal molecular gas masses of few times 10@xmath16 , indicating gas - rich host galaxies for the luminous active galactic nuclei ( agn ) that are observed at optical wavelengths .",
    "the high fir luminosities are thought to be dominated by dust heating from young stars formed in intense starburst events comparable to those found in submillimeter galaxies ( smgs ) , with star formation rates ( sfrs ) exceeding 1000yr@xmath17 .",
    "these starburst are fueled by the massive molecular gas reservoirs , which can maintain them for @xmath1210@xmath18yr ( e.g. , riechers et al.@xcite ) .",
    "the connection between gas mass and star formation is reflected in the relation between co and fir luminosities ( e.g. , sanders et al .",
    "@xcite ; gao & solomon @xcite ) , which in turn can be used to constrain the contribution of the agn to @xmath10 in quasars ( e.g. , riechers et al .",
    "the presence of both luminous agn and massive starbursts make these objects the ideal candidates to better understand the agn - starburst connection back to early cosmic times .    the currently most efficient way to investigate the molecular gas properties of quasar host galaxies with somewhat less extreme star formation events is by facilitating the flux magnification provided by gravitational lensing . besides the flux boost ,",
    "the spatial magnification of lensed quasars also aids in resolving these systems , allowing us to probe the gas reservoirs at smaller physical scales .",
    "about one third of the co - detected @xmath0@xmath122 quasar host galaxies are gravitationally lensed ( 9 sources ) , with typical magnification factors between a few and @xmath1930 ( solomon & vanden bout @xcite ) . to study the gas properties of high redshift agn host galaxies in more detail , we here enhance this sample by four galaxies with magnification factors of 10.8173 , including double , quadruple , sextuple , and einstein ring lens configurations .    in this paper , we report the detection of , , and emission in the far - infrared - luminous , strongly lensed quasar host galaxies of b1938 + 666 ( @xmath0=2.059 ) , he02302130 ( @xmath0=2.166 ) , he11041805 ( @xmath0=2.322 ) , and b1359 + 154 ( @xmath0=3.240 ) , using the combined array for research in millimeter - wave astronomy ( carma ) .",

    "even though the orientation of the accretion disk and host galaxy need not be aligned , referencing the redshifts of broad agn lines to the systemic redshifts provided by co observations of the host galaxies may help to better disentangle orientation effects and dynamics of high redshift galaxies .",

    "<S> we report the detection of luminous , , and  emission in the strongly lensed high - redshift quasars b1938 + 666 ( @xmath0=2.059 ) , he02302130 ( @xmath0=2.166 ) , he11041805 ( @xmath0=2.322 ) , and b1359 + 154 ( @xmath0=3.240 ) , using the combined array for research in millimeter - wave astronomy . </S>",
    "<S> b1938 + 666 was identified in a ` blind ' co redshift search , demonstrating the feasibility of such investigations with millimeter interferometers . </S>",
    "<S> these galaxies are lensing - amplified by factors of @xmath1@xmath211170 , and thus allow us to probe molecular gas in intrinsically fainter galaxies than currently possible without the aid of gravitational lensing . </S>",
    "<S> we report lensing - corrected intrinsic co line luminosities of @xmath3=0.6521@xmath410@xmath5kpc@xmath6 , translating to h@xmath7 masses of @xmath8=0.5217@xmath410@xmath5(@xmath9/0.8 ) . to investigate whether or not the agn in luminous quasars substantially contribute to @xmath10 , we study the @xmath11@xmath10 relation for quasars relative to galaxies without a luminous agn as a function of redshift . </S>",
    "<S> we find no substantial differences between submillimeter galaxies and high-@xmath0 quasars , but marginal evidence for an excess in @xmath10 in nearby low-@xmath10 agn galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> this may suggest that an agn contribution to @xmath10 is significant in systems with relatively low gas and dust content , but only minor in the most far - infrared - luminous galaxies ( in which @xmath10 is dominated by star formation ) . </S>"
