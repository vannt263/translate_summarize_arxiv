    "the formation of clusters by aggregation of particles is a characteristic feature of many seemingly different processes in physics , chemistry , biology and engineering .",
    "examples include aggregation of colloidal or aerosol particles suspended in liquid or gas @xcite , polymerization @xcite , antigen - antibody aggregation @xcite , and cluster formation in galaxy @xcite .",
    "this wide variety of applications has resulted in numerous studies which reveal that , when chemically identical particles aggregate , almost always scale invariant clusters emerge .",
    "note that due to the non - equilibrium nature of the aggregation process the standard theoretical framework developed for equilibrium statistical physics is found redundant .",
    "however , the application of stochastic theory is found to be increasingly useful in capturing a wide class of non - equilibrium phenomena .",
    "typically , the non - equilibrium systems are described by the rate equation approach , having the form of a master equation which is often governed by some conservation principle .",
    "the smoluchowski equation for the kinetics of irreversible aggregation is one such example , where the distribution function @xmath7 of particle of size @xmath8 at time @xmath9 evolves according to the following integro - differential equation @xcite : @xmath10 here , the kernel @xmath11 is symmetric with respect to its argument and it determines the collision time in which a particle of size @xmath8 collides with another particle of any size @xmath12 and they merge into a particle ( aggregate ) of size @xmath13 .",
    "the first term on the right hand side of eq . ( [ eq : cs ] ) describes the loss of a particle of size @xmath8 due to merging of particles of size @xmath8 with another particle of any size , while the second term describes gain of @xmath8 due to merging of particles of size @xmath14 with @xmath12 .",
    "the smoluchowski equation has been studied extensively for a large class of kernels satisfying @xmath15 .",
    "the homogeneity exponent @xmath16 is shown to play a crucial role in classifying gelling and non - gelling models .",
    "for instance , @xmath17 describes the non - gelling model whose dynamics is governed by the conservation of mass principle , and @xmath18 is the gelling model that describes the gelation transition accompanied by the violation of mass conservation law @xcite .",
    "note , however , that , despite the seemingly simple structure of eq .",
    "( [ eq : cs ] ) , it is solved exactly for non - gelling model , only for a constant kernel @xmath19 , and that solution was given more than one hundred years ago by smoluchowski himself . finding another exact analytical solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : cs ] ) for the non - gelling model ( @xmath17 ) therefore still remains an open challenge .",
    "one of the reason why the smoluchowski equation was so successful is that it has provided much of our theoretical understanding about dynamic scaling and associated exponents which are in aggreement , at least qualitatively , with those extracted from real experiments and numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "for instance , for @xmath17 it was shown that the distribution function @xmath7 exhibits dynamic scaling , @xmath20 in the long time ( @xmath21 ) , large size ( @xmath22 ) limit where @xmath23 is a scaling function whose argument @xmath24 is a dimensionless quantity . the exponents @xmath1 and @xmath2 satisfy a scaling relation @xmath25 with @xmath26 which follows from the conservation of mass principle . a scaling form like eq .",
    "( [ eq:0 ] ) is shared by an extraordinarily diverse range of other phenomena , not just in aggregation , e.g. , systems exhibiting self - organized criticality , cluster growth in driven diffusive systems , fragmentation processes , etc . @xcite .",
    "the ubiquity of this scaling form suggests the existence of a common underlying mechanism which makes such seemingly disparate systems behave in a remarkably similar fashion .",
    "in addition to growth by aggregation , there exists a host of other mechanisms ( e.g. , condensation , deposition , and accretion ) whereby particles can grow continuously between aggregations @xcite .",
    "for instance , aerosol or colloidal particles are often not stable but evolve via aggregation and condensation , leading to gas - to - particle conversion",
    ". however , when the concentration of particles present is high and the super - saturation is low , the condensation is heterogeneous in nature since , in this case , condensation takes place only on the existing particles without forming new nuclei @xcite .",
    "otherwise , the system may have sufficient number of impurities , such as dirt or mist particles , which usually serves as potential nucleation sites on which condensation takes place , and the resulting process is known as homogeneous condensation . in the latter case , the gas starts condensing on such nuclei and thereafter it is counted as a new particle , which then may take part on aggregation processes with other particle in the system .",
    "however , in the present work we will consider only the former case - heterogeneous condensation .",
    "such condensation - driven aggregation does play an important role in the formation of the size spectra that ultimately determine the various physical properties of the aggregates .",
    "motivated by this , we here propose a simple model which is defined in the next section .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we present the definition of our model including its algorithm .",

    ", we propose a generalized version of the smoluchowski equation and its appropriate parameters to describe the evolution of the distribution function @xmath7 following the rules of the model . in sec .",
    "v we give an explicit time dependent solution for @xmath7 and in sec .",
    "vi we give its scaling description to obtain various scaling exponents . finally , in sec .",
    "vii , we discuss and summarize the work .    .",

    ", are continuously growing by heterogeneous condensation , leading to gas - to - particle conversion , and merge irreversibly with other similarly growing particles upon encounter . to further specify our model , we assume that the amount of net growth by condensation of a given particle between collisions , in the most generic case , is directly proportional to its own size . the algorithm for one time unit of the model",
    "can then be defined as follows :    * two particles are picked randomly from the system which mimics random collision _ vis - a - vis _ brownian motion in one dimension . *",
    "the sizes of the two particles are increased by a fraction @xmath27 of their respective sizes . *",
    "their sizes are combined to form one particle . * the steps @xmath28",
    "are repeated _ ad infinitum_.    while the model is rather simple to define , the results it offers are far from simple . in order to illustrate how the rules of the model work for mono - disperse initial conditions , we give a simple example in fig .",

    "the state of the system at a given time is fully described by the numbers in the corresponding box .",
    "the evolution of these numbers is then described by a set of such boxes in successive times along the possible trajectory , e.g. , @xmath30 and so on .",
    "the first salient feature of this model is that the sum of all the numbers @xmath31 in the successive boxes keep increasing continuously with @xmath9 revealing that the conservation of mass law is clearly violated .",

    "in order to extract a couple of basic features of the model , we have performed extensive numerical simulations based on the algorithm @xmath35-@xmath36 .",

    "( [ eq : s ] ) @xcite .",
    "the most crucial aspect of the stochastic simulation is to find a way to define the time @xmath9 .",
    "note that the time necessary for a particle to come into contact with another particle should depend on the number of particles present in the system .",
    "indeed , ultimately it is the number density of particles present in the system which should determine how fast or how slowly the process should proceed , provided the collisions for aggregation of particles are independent of their size , and hence we define time @xmath33 . in fig [ fig2 ]",

    "the form of the scaling function is universal in nature .",
    "we have shown that the transition to such scaling is accompanied by the emergence of a non - trivial conservation law , that is , @xmath136 constant .",
