    "the study of systems of hard non - spherical particles is one of the central problems in statistical mechanics and has been attracting a great deal of interest since long ago . in a seminal contribution to this subject , onsager @xcite predicted that rod - like particles interacting with only excluded - volume interaction can lead to long - range orientational ( nematic ) order .",
    "this nematic phase , characterized by a big domain of parallel molecules , is separated from an isotropic state by a phase transition occurring at a finite critical density .",
    "numerous model systems of anisotropic objects , ranging from inorganic to organic and also biological particles , were analyzed by using the onsager s theory .",
    "an extensive overview of this field can be found in the excellent reviews of refs .",

    "the long - range orientational order disappears in the case of irreversible adsorption ( no desorption ) , where the distribution of adsorbed objects is different from that obtained at equilibrium .",
    "thus , at high coverage , the equilibrium state corresponds to a nematic phase with long - range correlations , whereas the final state generated by irreversible adsorption is a disordered state ( known as jamming state ) , in which no more objects can be deposited due to the absence of free space of appropriate size and shape .",
    "the jamming state has infinite memory of the process and the orientational order is purely local @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon of jamming plays an important role in numerous systems where the deposition of objects is irreversible over time scales of physical interest @xcite .",
    "the random sequential adsorption ( rsa ) , introduced by feder @xcite , has served as a paradigm for modeling irreversible deposition processes .",
    "the main features of the rsa model are : ( 1 ) the objects are put on randomly chosen sites , ( 2 ) the adsorption is irreversible and ( 3 ) at any time only one object is being adsorbed , so that the process takes place sequentially . in this theoretical frame ,",
    "anisotropic particles of different shapes and sizes have been studied : linear @xmath0-mers ( particles occupying @xmath0 adjacent lattice sites ) @xcite , flexible polymers @xcite , t - shaped objects and crosses @xcite , squares @xcite , disks @xcite , regular and star polygons @xcite , etc . in all cases ,",
    "the limiting or jamming coverage , @xmath3 , strongly depends on the shape and size of the depositing particles .    in the case of lattice models straight rigid rods ( or linear @xmath0-mers ) , which is the topic of this paper ,",

    "the inherent complexity of the system still represents a major difficulty to the development of accurate analytical solutions , and computer simulations appear as a very important tool for studying this subject . in this direction ,",
    "bonnier et al . investigated the deposition of linear @xmath0-mers ( with @xmath0 ranging between 2 and 512 on a two - dimensional ( 2d ) square lattice @xcite .",
    "the authors found that the jamming concentration monotonically decreases and tends to @xmath10 as the length of the rods increases .",
    "vandewalle et al . studied the percolation and jamming phenomena for straight rigid rods of size @xmath0 on 2d square lattices @xcite and found that , for values of @xmath0 between 2 and 10 , the ratio @xmath11 ( being @xmath12 the percolation threshold ) remains constant @xmath13 , regardless of the length of the particle .",
    "based on this finding , the authors suggested that both critical phenomena ( percolation and jamming ) are intimately related .",

    "@xcite , the jamming coverage decreases monotonically approaching the asymptotic value of @xmath17 for large values of @xmath0 ; ( 2 ) the percolation threshold is a nonmonotonic function of the size @xmath0 , showing a minimum around @xmath18 ; and ( 3 ) the ratio of the two thresholds @xmath11 is nonmonotonic too : after initial growth , it stabilizes between @xmath19 and @xmath20 , and then it grows logarithmically .",
    "recently , lebovka et al . studied an anisotropic rsa of straight rigid rods on 2d square lattices @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the vertical and horizontal orientations occur with different probabilities , and the degree of anisotropy of the system can be characterized by an order parameter measuring the difference ( normalized ) between the number of line segments oriented in the vertical direction and the number of line segments oriented in the horizontal direction .",
    "the authors investigated the effect of @xmath0-mer alignment on the jamming properties . in the case of isotropic systems ( order parameter equal to zero ) , the results obtained by lebovka et al .",

    "gives an accurate estimation of the jamming threshold in the infinite system .",
    "the main objectives of the paper are ( 1 ) to evaluate the accuracy and applicability of the new technique to estimate jamming properties , ( 2 ) to determine the dependence of the jamming coverage on the size of the deposited @xmath0-mers , and ( 3 ) to compare our results with the corresponding ones in ref .",
