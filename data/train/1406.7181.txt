    "quasars , powered by accretion of material onto the central supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) of active galaxies , are among the most luminous objects in the universe . in the current paradigm of galaxy formation and evolution",
    ", quasars represent a key phase in the evolutionary history of massive galaxies .",
    "essentially all spheroidal systems are believed to harbour massive black holes .",
    "the masses of the central smbhs are shown to correlate with many properties of their host galaxies , e.g. , the stellar velocity dispersion of the bulge , the bulge mass and the bulge luminosity ( e.g. , kormendy & richstone 1995 ; magorrian et al . 1998 ; ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ; tremaine et al .",
    "2002 ; kormendy et al .",
    "present - day smbhs are thought to have gained most of their mass via accretion during an active nuclear phase , e.g. the quasar phase .",
    "the implication is that black hole growth and star - formation activity are inextricably linked , at least for galaxies which experience ` wet ' major mergers and a quasar - like period of rapid black hole growth ( see kormendy & ho 2013 for a review ) .",
    "a probable scenario is that the galaxy initially forms in a gas - rich rotationally supported system . as the host dark matter halo grows , some mechanisms , such as major merger or disk / bar instability trigger a period of rapid , dust obscured star - formation activity ( starburst ) which produces a stellar bulge .",
    "at the same time , the infalling gas fuelling the starburst is also feeding the central black hole . after some time the quasar becomes optically visible ( unobscured ) , and soon after that the on - going star formation is quenched on a short time - scale , perhaps via radiative or mechanical feedback from the central engine ( see fabian 2012 for a review ) .",
    "the cosmic star - formation history is shown to be similar to the evolving luminosity density of quasars ( which is related to the bh accretion history ) at most redshifts ( e.g. , boyle & terlevich 1998 ; franceschini et al .",
    "1999 ; merloni et al .",
    "2004 ; shankar et al . 2007 ; silverman et al . 2008 ; wall , pope & scott 2008 ) , which adds further support to this picture of the galaxy - black hole connection .    in this paper",
    ", we probe the co - evolution of black hole growth and star - formation activity using a cross - correlation analysis between optically selected type 1 quasars over the redshift range @xmath17 and the cosmic infrared background ( cib ) in the far - infrared ( fir)/sub - millimetre ( sub - mm ) . the former represents some of the most luminous and massive black holes found to date .",
    "the latter is dominated by emission from dusty star - forming galaxies ( dsfgs ) over a similar redshift range to the quasars ( valiante et al .",

    "the large - scale cross - correlation signal of quasars and star - forming galaxies is determined by the effective linear bias ( or equivalently , the effective host halo mass ) of both sets of tracers of the underlying large - scale structure .",
    "the small - scale cross - correlation signal constrains the halo occupation distributions ( hods ) of star - forming galaxies in quasar - hosting dark matter halos and the hods of quasars in halos hosting star - forming galaxies .",
    "in contrast , the auto - correlation function constrains the hods of each population independently , not the hods of one population in the presence of the other .",
    "therefore , the cross - correlation function is arguably more suited to studying the co - evolution of the quasars and the star - forming galaxies .",
    "quasars are very luminous active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and hence can be seen out to great distances .",
    "they are great tracers of the large - scale structure . to measure their clustering properties reliably , large - volume surveys are required , due to the low spatial density of quasars .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "2000 ) has produced some of the largest quasar samples to date and that is what we use in this paper .",
    "fir and sub - mm observations are critical for studying star - forming galaxies , as dust absorbs the optical / ultraviolet light and reradiates in the fir / sub - mm .",
    "dust emission makes up the cib , which contains about half of the extragalactic background radiation ( excluding the cosmic microwave background ) , i.e. the total power originated from stars and agn throughout the cosmic history ( puget et al .",
    "1996 ; fixsen et al . 1998 ; lagache et al .",
    "the _ herschel space observatory _",
    "( pilbratt et al . 2010 ) has carried out imaging surveys with unprecedented size and depth at fir / sub - mm wavelengths .",
    "thanks to its sensitivity and mapping speed , it allows us for the first time to probe the bolometric power of dsfgs at high redshifts in large volumes .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section 2",
    ", we give an overview of the _ herschel_-spire maps and sdss dr7 and dr9 qso catalogues used in our analysis . in section 3 ,",
    "we first describe the estimator used to calculate the cross - correlation signal between the qsos and the cib .",
    "we then investigate the potential contamination of galactic dust emission by explicitly calculating the cross - correlation signal between our quasar samples and the iras 100  @xmath5 data in our fields . finally , we present the cross - correlation results between various quasar samples and the spire maps at 250 , 350 and 500  @xmath5 . in section 4 ,",

    "one exception is the emission from galactic dust ( cirrus ) which can not be ignored at fir / sub - mm wavelengths .",
    "therefore , the spire map signal can be modelled , to first order , as the sum of the following three terms : the emission from dsfgs ; galactic cirrus emission ; and instrument noise .",
    "thus we can write @xmath31 we expect that only the emission from dsfgs have intrinsic correlation with the quasars .",
    "this is because some quasars could be strong ir / sub - mm emitters from dust heated by the accreting black hole , as well as star formation in the host galaxy ( e.g. lutz et al .",

    "2009 ; serjeant et al . 2010 ; bonfield et al . 2011 ; dai et al .",
    "but additionally dsfgs are expected to occur as satellite galaxies in the dark matter halos where quasars are found .",
    "a last effect is that dark matter halos correlated with the quasar - hosting halo are also expected to host dsfgs .",
    "the spire instrumental noise should not correlate with quasars and therefore only contributes to the noise in the measured cross - correlation signal between quasars and the cib . similarly , galactic dust emission should not have any intrinsic correlation with the quasars .",
    "however , due to the selection of the quasars , there might be ( anti-)correlation between the observed quasar number density field and the intensity of the cirrus emission .",
    "there are two effects of galactic dust on the selection of qsos .",
    "the first effect is reddening which means qsos with extreme reddening will not be selected as targets for spectroscopy .",
    "the second effect is extinction , which can cause the qsos to drop out of the target list even before they reach the colour selection stage .",
    "qso populations with steeper number counts will be more sensitive to extinction .",
    "to explicitly check the potential correlation between the quasar samples and galactic cirrus emission , we make use of the 100  @xmath5 maps from the improved reprocessing of the _ iras _ ( neugebauer et al . 1984 )",

    "these 100  @xmath5 maps are used as a galactic cirrus tracer in our fields data may not be used as a reliable galactic cirrus tracer as a result of significant contamination from the cib ( pnin et al .",

    "the amplitude of the one - halo term of the correlated emission is about 10 times smaller than the sub - mm emission of the quasars themselves , implying that the satellite dusty star - forming galaxies are much fainter and have a lower sfr than the central quasars .",
