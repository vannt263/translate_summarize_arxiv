    "the formulation and practical solution for scattering problems in few- and many - body systems entails on many difficulties caused by several reasons : ( i ) complicated boundary conditions , especially above the breakup thresholds ; ( ii ) separation of the proper physical solution from unphysical ( e.g. forbidden by symmetry requirements etc . )",
    "ones ; ( iii ) high dimension of resulting integral or integro - differential scattering equations ;  ( iv ) presence of complicated moving singularities in the kernels of few - body scattering equations .",
    "all these difficulties have resulted in the current situation in the field when we are able to treat rather accurately many - body bound states in very complicated systems consisting of tens or hundred particles while we are still unable to treat accurately even three- or four - body systems with coulomb interactions , the scattering of particles with inner degrees of freedom , e.g. the collision of a few molecules in quantum theory of chemical reactions , or a triple collisions of three- or four nuclei etc .",
    "moreover , even a solution of conventional three - nucleon scattering problem with realistic interactions requires an extensive usage of supercomputers @xcite .",
    "it hampers strongly the further progress in this important area .",
    "thus , one can formulate an important goal : not only to simplify greatly the solution of some few- and many - body scattering problems , but also to develop a new method in scattering theory which would be quite in a spirit of the bound - state problem solving . so that the whole treatment of few- and many - body scattering would be close to the routine bound - state calculations in quantum chemistry or in nuclear physics .    on this way , many @xmath1-type methods have been suggested and widely developed in the past and even now they are actively progressing . among these the following methods",
    "can be mentioned : the r - matrix type approaches @xcite , the equivalent quadrature technique @xcite and the stieltjes ",
    "tchebyshev moment - theory approach @xcite , the lorentz integral transform @xcite , the harmonic oscillator representation @xcite and the j - matrix approach @xcite , the continuum - discretized coupled - channel method ( cdcc ) @xcite , the convergent close coupling approach @xcite , different realizations of the complex scaling method @xcite and others ( see also the recent review @xcite ) . all these approaches are utilized rather actively in atomic , chemical and nuclear physics .    in this paper",
    "we suggest another general approach for solving a few - body scattering problem based on the usage of special normalized states , the so - called stationary wave packets ( wps ) or eigendifferentials . the concept of eigendifferentials was introduced long ago by pioneers of quantum physics : h. weyl @xcite , e. wigner @xcite , h. bethe @xcite and others to treat non - normalizable continuum states ( which do not belong to a hilbert space ) in a framework of the standard theory of hermitian operators in a hilbert space .",
    "the idea of stationary wave packets turned out to be very fruitful at early stages of the quantum theory development ( see e.g. the detailed discussion in the classical textbooks @xcite ) .    in our previous papers",
    "@xcite we proposed to use such normalized wp states as a very convenient discrete basis , onto which one can project out all the scattering operators and wave functions . because wps are related explicitly to exact scattering wave functions ,",
    "many complicated operators such as free or channel resolvents have analytical finite - dimensional approximations in the wp representation .",
    "this leads immediately to a replacement of the scattering operators by finite matrices , so that a solution of a few - body scattering problem is reduced to solving simple matrix equations with regular matrix elements instead of multi - dimensional integral equations with singular kernels in a conventional formulation .",
    "in addition , our approach results in a very effective numerical scheme for a practical solution .",
    "thus , in the present paper we report the main results of the general wp approach and describe how to reformulate complicated singular few - body scattering equations into a form which allows to solve them straightforwardly on a serial personal computer in a rather short time .",
    "the work has the following structure .",
    "section 2 is dedicated to the description of the eigendifferentials ( stationary wave packets ) and their interrelation to conventional non - normalized scattering wave functions , on the one hand , and discrete pseudostates resulting from a standard diagonalization procedure for the hamiltonian matrix , on the other .",
    "section 3 includes a detailed description of different properties and features of the stationary wave packets . in section 4",
    "we present a discrete version of the scattering theory based on the wp representation for the scattering operators and wave functions .",
    "section 5 is devoted to the multichannel scattering while the next section 6 contains a general description of the three - body wave - packet formalism . in section 7 a solution of the composite particle scattering off a target - nucleus",
    "is discussed .",
    "a formulation of the faddeev equations in a discrete form and their practical solution are given in section 8 .",
    "we summarize our main results in the last section 9 . for the reader",
    "s convenience we added the appendix which contains explicit formulas for the channel resolvent eigenvalues in the wp representation .",
    "let us introduce some notations .",
    "we start here with two - body scattering problem in a stationary formulation .",
    "assume that the potential @xmath2 is local and spherically symmetrical , so that the angular momentum is conserved and the total schroedinger equation is reduced to radial equations for a fixed value of the angular momentum @xmath3 . below we will deal mainly with the radial parts of the wave functions which justify the partial schroedinger equation : @xmath4+v(r)\\right ) \\psi^l(r , e)=e\\psi^l(r , e ) , \\label{se}\\ ] ] where we use units with @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the reduced mass .",
    "we will omit the index @xmath3 wherever possible until section 6 and also other indices related to spin , isospin etc . until the cases they are to be detailed .",
    "the operator in the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ se ] ) is the total hamiltonian @xmath7 , which can be written in the form : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a free motion hamiltonian .",
    "further we will write all the relationships in an operator form using the dirac notations , without specifying the representation .",
    "it is essential that hamiltonians @xmath9 and @xmath7 are hermitian operators ( in an appropriate hilbert space ) and have a simple continuous spectrum @xmath10 .",
    "the total hamiltonian @xmath7 may also have a discrete spectrum describing bound states of the system .",
    "the corresponding bound - state wave functions of @xmath7 are denoted as @xmath11 while the continuum functions are denoted as @xmath12 .",
    "they satisfy the schroedinger equation ( an operator form of the eq .",
    "( [ se ] ) ) @xmath13 and the usual orthogonality condition @xmath14 in our study , we also need the scattering wave functions @xmath15 normalized to the delta - function of momentum @xmath16 : @xmath17      a description of continuum meets some difficulty in a stationary formulation of a quantum mechanical problem .",
    "as is well known , continuum wave functions for the total and free hamiltonians , @xmath7 and @xmath9 , do not have a finite normalization unlike to bound - state wave functions and thus they do not belong to a hilbert space . strictly speaking ,",
    "such non - normalizable states are not eigenfunctions of @xmath7 and @xmath9 and some basic properties of hamiltonians ( the hermiticity property ) or even an orthogonality of continuum wave functions could not be proven in a normal manner with such non - normalizable set @xcite .    nowadays",
    "this formal problem is avoided by using the dirac delta - function ( [ norm_delta ] ) and by generalization of a hilbert space to a rigged hilbert space . however",
    ", in the past , physicists often employed another formal trick ( see e.g. @xcite ) based on the weyl s eigendifferential concept developed when studying the spectral theory for singular differential operators  @xcite .",
    "the idea is to introduce an interval with a small width @xmath18 for each value @xmath19 from the continuum and then to construct the so - called eigendifferential , i.e. integral of the continuum wave function @xmath12 over the interval : @xmath20 it is easy to see that such state is normalizable ( due to an integration ) and belongs to a hilbert space . in this way",
    ", one can generalize the conventional definition of a state normalization : the state @xmath12 is treated as normalizable if its eigendifferential has a finite norm @xcite .    to treat a whole continuum , it should be divided into non - overlapping intervals ( i.e. it should be discretized ) .",
    "the system of eigendifferentials forms the orthonormal set @xcite : @xmath21 it is important to stress that the set of such eigendifferentials give a diagonal representation for the hamiltonian : @xmath22 besides this , they have a finite overlap with initial ( non - normalized ) states @xmath23 a complete system of eigenfunctions for the hermitian hamiltonian @xmath7 in the eigendifferential formalism is built from bound - state wave functions @xmath24 and eigendifferentials @xcite .",
    "in other words , for an arbitrary wave function @xmath25 one can write down the following expansion : @xmath26 where the sum over an infinite but accountable set of eigendifferentials has rather a symbolic meaning .",
    "however further one can pass to a limit @xmath27 which leads immediately to a conventional expansion of the arbitrary function @xmath25 over the bound - states and functions of the continuum : @xmath28 the discrete sum in eq .",
    "( [ spectr_sum ] ) goes to the integral expansion in eq .",
    "( [ spectr_sum1 ] ) over continuum wave functions @xmath12 in the sense of a riemann ",
    "stieltjes integral @xcite .",
    "also it can be shown @xcite that the finite normalization condition for eigendifferentials ( [ deltanorm ] ) leads just to a delta - function normalization of continuum states ( [ norm_delta ] ) .",
    "today such a way of definition of the hamiltonian eigenfunctions for a continuous spectrum practically is not used , as was noted above .",
    "but in our approach we use such eigendifferentials as basis states to solve a scattering problem in a discrete representation .",
    "below we demonstrate that this `` classical '' way is turned out to be extremely fruitful for practical calculations in few - body scattering problems .",
    "there is also the another very popular concept for a treatment of a discretized continuum : the pseudostates",
    ". it will be demonstrated below that these two ways of discretization : via eigendifferentials and via pseudostates are closely interrelated .",
    "as is known , pseudostates arise in an approximate treatment of a continuous spectrum of a quantum system based on a projection of scattering wave functions into an orthogonal @xmath1 basis set @xmath29 of a finite dimension @xmath30 .",
    "if one substitutes the expansion of a hamiltonian eigenfunction in the basis functions @xmath31 into the schroedinger equation ( [ se2 ] ) one gets the following system of algebraic linear equations for the expansion coefficients @xmath32 @xmath33 c_k=0,\\quad n=1,\\ldots , n,\\ ] ] which corresponds to the eigenstate problem for the hamiltonian matrix with the elements @xmath34 . after a diagonalization of the hamiltonian matrix one",
    "gets a set of eigenvalues @xmath35 and eigenfunctions @xmath36 @xmath37 .",
    "this discrete set can be divided on two groups : the eigenfunctions with lower eigenvalues describe the system bound states if they exist ( in the case of a short - range potential their number is finite ) while the remained eigenstates correspond to the continuum wave functions at discrete energies @xmath38 . unlike to the exact continuum functions these discrete eigenstates have a finite norm and their eigenvalues define the discretized continuum .",
    "that is why they are usually referred to as _ pseudo_states of the hamiltonian @xmath7 .    for the above pseudostates , the conditions similar to those given in eqs .",
    "( [ deltanorm]-[eig_delta ] ) for eigendifferentials are valid : @xmath39 an employment of pseudostates instead of exact scattering functions in practical scattering calculations meets the well known difficulty related to the difference in their normalization .",
    "the functions of pseudostates behave in some inner region like the scattering wave functions but , in sharp contrast with the latter , they vanish in the asymptotic region .",
    "nevertheless , the functions of pseudostates together with bound - state wave functions form a complete set of basis functions , and this set can be used to approximate the spectral expansions of the scattering operators or scattering wave functions .",
    "very often it is necessary to find not operator itself , but only its matrix elements with normalized functions @xmath25 .",
    "the example for such an employment is the calculation of transition probabilities between the bound states of subsystem via the intermediate continuum states , in particular , the calculation of response functions in the lorentz integral transform ( lit ) method @xcite or the calculation of @xmath0-matrix elements on the basis of spectral expansion of the total resolvent of the system  @xcite .",
    "let us consider a matrix element of some operator @xmath40 which is a function of the hamiltonian @xmath7 using the spectral expansion of the operator @xmath41 in a complete set of the hamiltonian eigenfunctions : @xmath42 as is evident , the spectral expansion ( [ phi_a ] ) includes not wave functions themselves but their positive quadratic forms @xmath43 .",
    "so that , for such quantities there are no problems related to the normalization of scattering wave functions and they are finite functions of energy .",
    "further , the integral over continuous spectrum can be approximated by a discrete sum over respective pseudostates : @xmath44 ) .",
    "this approach has been suggested earlier for solution of different particular problems in atomic physics @xcite related to finding matrix elements of green functions .",
    "e.g. , a conception of an equivalent quadrature ( eq ) was introduced within the framework of the moment - theory approach for calculation of non - negative spectral densities @xcite .",
    "the mesh points of the eq coincide with pseudostate energies and corresponding weights are determined formally from relations between discrete and continuous quantities : @xmath45 which are valid at discrete pseudostate energies @xmath38 .",
    "one important result of the equivalent quadrature technique is the fact the quadrature weights do not depend upon the function @xmath25 and are determined actually by pseudostate wave functions and by the spectral density of the particular system . so that , the values @xmath46 are just the coefficients for transitions from normalizable states @xmath47 to non - normalizable functions @xmath48 .    in general , finding the weights of the equivalent quadrature is highly non - trivial problem because the exact scattering wave functions @xmath12 are still unknown .",
    "however , for many problems when one needs only complete spectral sum , knowledge of these weights is not required .",
    "for example , the pseudostate functions are used for inclusion of intermediate continuum states for excitations of projectile or target in description of composite particle scattering in atomic @xcite and nuclear @xcite physics . in these cases , as a rule , the pseudostates are employed in expansion of a total wave function of the system to perform a coupled channel reduction of the initial many - body problem .    however , it is still possible to find scattering observables just from individual pseudostate wave functions if the eq is known .",
    "in fact , if to write down an expression for the elastic scattering amplitude : @xmath49 it is easy to see that the function @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is a free motion function , is square - integrable in case of a short - range potential @xmath2 .",
    "so that , one can employ the properly normalized pseudostate instead of the exact scattering wave function : @xmath52 to find direct relation between `` continuous '' @xmath53 and `` discrete '' @xmath54 amplitudes , one can use the eq definition ( [ eq_def ] ) which results in : @xmath55 actually , the problem of evaluation of @xmath46 is related to finding a spectral density in the continuous spectrum of @xmath7 .",
    "one of the methods is to evaluate moments of the energy distribution using spectral expansion in pseudostates .",
    "then , the equivalent quadrature weights can be found from a solution of complicated set of nonlinear algebraic equations @xcite",
    ". however , to find the eq , the eigendifferential formalism can be used .      in our previous works @xcite the following way for finding the coefficients of transformation from normalizable functions to non - normalizable ones has been suggested .",
    "this method is based on the observation that pseudostate wave functions are very similar to eigendifferentials . in particular , both types of functions behave in the inner region like an exact scattering wave function , whereas in the asymptotics they vanish differently in accordance with their own properties .",
    "moreover , functions from both sets are normalized and the hamiltonian matrices in both sets are diagonal .",
    "it means one can treat pseudostates as approximations just for eigendifferentials rather than for exact non - normalizable scattering wave functions . of course , this approximation is valid only when eigenenergies of both states ( [ eig_delta ] ) and ( [ eig_pseu ] ) are coincided .    in fig.[eigen ] we compare pseudostates of the free hamiltonian found in the gaussian basis ( see details in ref .",
    "@xcite ) with exact eigendifferentials ( normalized to unity ) constructed for the same distribution of eigenenergies @xmath56 .",
    "it is clear that both type functions are nearly coincide in some inner domain .",
    "further , it is easy to see that the coefficients of transformation to non - normalizable states ( see the definition  ( [ edf ] ) ) are given simply by the widths @xmath18 in the discretization procedure for eigendifferentials : @xmath57 using the direct correspondence between eigendifferentials ( with the normalization factor ) and pseudostates @xmath58 and comparing the eqs .",
    "( [ aom ] ) and ( [ ade ] ) , one gets an approximate relation : @xmath59 so that , we find an amazing result : the coefficients of transformation from pseudostates to exact continuum wave functions are determined , first of all , by the distribution of discrete pseudostates energies @xmath38 rather than by the form of basis functions @xmath60 themselves . actually the form of basis functions determines implicitly the pseudostate energy distribution : it will be different for various basis sets",
    ".    it would be very appropriate to give here some clear example .",
    "let us consider a free particle motion in a spherical box with radius @xmath61 .",
    "the solution of a radial schroedinger equation for @xmath62-wave in this case is an infinite set of wave functions ( normalized to unity ) @xmath63 instead of exact free motion states : @xmath64 for this case the weights of the eq do not depend on the index @xmath65 and can be found explicitly : @xmath66 it is clear that this quantities coincide _ exactly _ to the discrete momentum differences @xmath67 ( momentum analog of the energy widths in ( [ edf ] ) ) . in other words",
    ", one can determine the weights of the eq directly via the discretization width @xmath68 rather that via the size of the box @xmath61 ( although they are interrelated ) .",
    "when we are dealing with an @xmath1-discretization using an arbitrary basis , this can be treated as a solution of the scattering problem in a box with blurred boundaries but these boundaries are difficult to determine explicitly .",
    "however they do impact on a discrete energy distribution which is used for finding approximate weights or widths of discretization intervals . so that , eventually in order to derive the values of scattering observables from the discrete energy distribution one should determine the spectral partition parameters using eigenvalues @xmath38 of pseudostates obtained from the hamiltonian matrix diagonalization .",
    "in general case , the energy interval widths @xmath69 would be different for different @xmath65 .",
    "thus , our main idea here is that pseudostates are approximations for exact eigendifferentials . surely , the above argumentation is not strict but plausible .",
    "it is also necessary to have similarity between pseudostates and eigendifferentials at least within the interaction range .",
    "it means that the size of the pseudostate basis should be rather large and the interval widths to be rather small .",
    "unfortunately , it is difficult to give more strict conditions for such a replacement here .",
    "some estimates can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    below we",
    "formulate a fully discrete version of a stationary scattering theory using the eigendifferential ( wave - packet ) formalism , while in practical realizations we replace often exact eigendifferentials with pseudostates found from the hamiltonian matrix diagonalization on an appropriate basis .",
    "both these points make it possible to simplify greatly the practical solving of few - body scattering problems .",
    "in the approach which will be used everywhere in this work , the eigendifferentials will be employed as primary basis functions upon which all wave functions and operators will be expanded . in other words , we will treat scattering problems in a discrete representation .",
    "we rename eigendifferentials as stationary wave packets because the name seems to us more physical and clear for understanding .",
    "the approach developed  we refer to it as the wave - packet continuum discretization method ( wpcd )  takes the advantages of the above @xmath1 techniques and simultaneously gives an accurate solution of few - body equations .",
    "it is important to stress that the stationary wave packets are constructed from exact wave functions of continuous spectrum as their eigendifferentials ( normalized to unity ) .",
    "but wps are considered here as ordinary functions and thus the details of a partition procedure for a continuous spectrum have to be defined .",
    "let us restrict the continuous spectrum of the free hamiltonian @xmath9 @xmath10 with some maximal value of energy @xmath70 and then divide the whole interval @xmath71 $ ] into finite number of non - overlapping intervals @xmath72_{i=1}^{n}$ ] ( where @xmath73 and @xmath74 ) which we recall , according to ref .",
    "@xcite , as discretization bins .",
    "we assume here that the value @xmath70 is finite although sufficiently large in order to provide convergence to the exact solution of the problem to be treated .",
    "every such an energy bin corresponds to the interval @xmath75 $ ] on the momentum axis @xmath76 where @xmath16 and @xmath6 is the reduced mass . for the sake of convenience we will denote both the momentum and the energy bins by a symbol @xmath77 ( @xmath78 is an interval number ) .",
    "also we denote widths of momentum and energy intervals as follows : @xmath79 further we consider the complete set of continuous spectrum states @xmath80 for the free hamiltonian @xmath9 ( for each partial wave @xmath3 ) normalized as in eq .",
    "( [ dek ] ) .",
    "now we define the free stationary wave packets as integrals of free motion wave functions over the discretization bins as in eq .",
    "( [ edf ] ) : @xmath81 where @xmath82 is some weight function and @xmath83 is a normalization coefficient related to each other by the formula : @xmath84 by modifying the weight function @xmath82 one can get different types of wps . in particular",
    ", the case @xmath85 corresponds to the energy wave - packets which coincide with eigendifferentials ( [ edf ] ) up to normalization factors .",
    "the case @xmath86 leads to momentum wps etc .",
    "however it is important to note that when the partition used is sufficiently dense ( i.e. for small bin widths ) the particular form of the weight function does not matter .",
    "moreover in practical calculations one can replace energy wps with momentum ones ( for the same partition ) and errors related to this replacement are very small .    according to the definition ( [ ip ] ) it is easy to show that the states @xmath87 form an orthonormalized set @xcite : @xmath88 then it is straightforward to get a formula for the overlap integral between wp states and initial plane waves : @xmath89 the free hamiltonian matrix ( and also the matrix of any operator depending upon @xmath9 or just commuting with it ) is _ diagonal _ in such a basis while the respective eigenvalues depend on the weight function : @xmath90 in the case of energy wps , the eigenvalues of @xmath9 are just the bin midpoints : @xmath91 and in the case of momentum wps , the eigenvalues are : @xmath92    such wp states will be used to carry out all our calculations . from practical point of view",
    "the wave - packet set can be used in any scattering calculations on the same footing as usual discrete @xmath1 bases like the harmonic oscillator basis or a basis of gaussians . however ,",
    "in contrast to those , such wp basis states have a direct relation ( [ projk ] ) to exact continuum wave functions .",
    "the wp functions have an interesting behavior both in coordinate and momentum spaces .",
    "consider for simplicity the case of @xmath86 .",
    "it is easy to show @xcite that in coordinate space wp functions behave as follows ( here we use the reduced radial part of a wave function for @xmath93-wave ) : @xmath94 where @xmath95 is a midpoint of the interval @xmath77 . so that , free wps are nearly coincide with non - normalized continuum wave functions in the area @xmath96 . as is seen from eq .",
    "( [ exact ] ) , the `` packetting '' procedure defined in eq .",
    "( [ ip ] ) results in an additional decreasing factor which just provides the wave function with finite normalization .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2_1 ] the coordinate behavior of three wp states ( [ exact ] ) are compared for different ratios of bin width @xmath97 and its midpoint value @xmath98 .",
    "it follows from the figure that the radial behavior of the wps resemble the characteristic picture of beats ( i.e. dual - frequency oscillations ) and the smaller ratio @xmath99 corresponds the slower decay of the wp function .",
    "therefore such a basis functions can be employed to approximate the non - normalized continuum wave functions on longer distances .",
    "this property is crucially important for few - body scattering calculations because the faddeev components of the total wave function have a specific long - range asymptotic behavior which must be reproduced correctly .    in the momentum representation ,",
    "the free wp functions are simple step - like functions : they do not vanish only for the momentum interval coinciding with their bin , i.e. only for the on - shell region . in this area",
    "they are fully determined by the weight function @xmath82 : @xmath100 where the @xmath101 is the heaviside step - like function - functions is defined as follows : @xmath102 ] .",
    "when @xmath86 all the wave functions in the momentum wp representation take a histogram form .",
    "being generalized onto a few - body case , the free few - body wp basis functions are built as a direct products of step - like functions along every independent momentum variable . in this way , the whole momentum space is replaced by a finite momentum lattice . in this sense",
    "we will refer to this basis as _ a lattice basis_.      for further investigations , the important questions are : does the wp set form a basis and how one can prove a convergence of the results with increasing a basis dimension .",
    "it should be noted here that for the set of pseudostates the problem of completeness does not exist because the pseudostates jointly with the bound states form the same linear span as the initial @xmath1 basis set .",
    "so that , the set of pseudostates and bound states form a basis which becomes to be complete in the limit @xmath103 .",
    "it is clear that , unlike to the eigendifferential case when @xmath104 , the wp set does not form a complete basis in a full hilbert space if bin widths are kept to be finite .",
    "but one can introduce the wp subspace @xmath105 in which the orthonormal set @xmath106 , of course , forms a basis .",
    "the projector onto the wp subspace is defined as usual : @xmath107 thus below we will refer to the wp set as a wp basis keeping in mind it is the basis in @xmath105 .",
    "one has to make some estimates concerning the convergence of the results obtained in @xmath105 to exact scattering - problem solutions with increasing the basis dimension .",
    "the exact unit operator @xmath108 , which can be written in the following form : @xmath109 is replaced in the wp approach with the wave - packet projection operator @xmath110 .",
    "this replacement implies two following approximations :    * the infinite continuous spectrum is truncated with the maximal momentum value @xmath111 and the residual integral @xmath112 is neglected ; * exact partial spectral projectors @xmath113 are replaced with the wp partial projectors @xmath114 .    surely , these points are not valid in a full hilbert space . but keeping in mind numerical applications of the method one can compare the mean values of operators @xmath108 and @xmath110 in some @xmath1 normalized state @xmath25 having an effective range @xmath115 . to satisfy to the following conditions ( corresponding to the above points ( i ) and ( ii ) ) @xmath116 one has to have sufficiently small widths @xmath97 and sufficiently high maximal momentum value @xmath111 @xcite : @xmath117 with these restrictions one can choose for the practical realization the proper conditions for the momentum bin partition @xmath118 .",
    "then one can check the convergence of the results with increasing a wave - packet basis dimension , when the bin widths become smaller and smaller , and the maximum value @xmath111 becomes higher and higher .",
    "this procedure simulates changes in eigenvalue @xmath119 distributions for pseudostates with increasing a basis dimension @xmath30 .",
    "one can employ , for example , distributions ( grids ) transforming a finite interval to whole numerical axis , e.g. the tchebyshev grid @xcite ) : @xmath120,\\quad i=1,\\ldots , n,\\ ] ] where @xmath121 is a scale parameter .",
    "such grid points @xmath122 are convenient because one can study the convergence of the results with increasing the basis dimension as in the usual @xmath1-basis case .",
    "one can expect that the result obtained in the wp representation approaches the exact solution with increasing the basis dimension @xmath30 .",
    "similarly to the free hamiltonian ( @xmath9 ) case , one can introduce a wp set for the total hamiltonian @xmath123 .",
    "we define a partition of the continuum for the total hamiltonian into non - overlapping bins @xmath124\\}_{k=1}^m$ ] with @xmath125 and @xmath126 ( or @xmath127 $ ] ) .",
    "let s note that this partition might be different from the free wp partition @xmath128 .",
    "the _ scattering wave - packets _ are defined as integrals of exact scattering wave functions @xmath129 over the intervals chosen : @xmath130 where @xmath131 and @xmath132 are the normalization coefficients and weight functions respectively .",
    "they have the same properties as free wps .",
    "however , the total hamiltonian may have a discrete spectrum . in this case one",
    "has to add bound - state wave functions of @xmath7 to the scattering wp set to obtain complete wp set corresponding to the total hamiltonian @xmath7 .    in practical solution",
    "we have the basic problem how to construct these scattering wps without solving the initial scattering problem . here",
    "one can exploit an idea of similarity of eigendifferentials ( wps ) and pseudostates .",
    "so that , one can use free wps as a basis to construct scattering wps for the total hamiltonian @xmath7 as its pseudostates . for this purpose",
    "we apply a diagonalization procedure for the total hamiltonian matrix in a free wp basis . as a result",
    "we get a discrete sets of eigenvalues @xmath133 and respective eigenvectors @xmath134 .    since the free wp basis functions ( in the momentum space ) are step - like functions , the momentum dependence of all functions expressed via such a basis have a histogram - like form .",
    "an example of the momentum dependence for the bound state ( deuteron ) function in such step - like basis in comparison with the exact function for the yamaguchi @xmath93-wave triplet @xmath135 potential is displayed in fig .",

    "however , the smooth energy dependence of the input optical potential is of no significance for our present purpose and , thereby we omit it here .",
    "also we assume that there are bound states in @xmath308 sub - hamiltonian @xmath309 with energies @xmath310 .",
    "the channel hamiltonian is a direct sum of two sub - hamiltonians : @xmath311 in the case to be discussed , when rearrangement channels are neglected , the transition operator @xmath312 which describes the elastic scattering of the projectile by the target nucleus as well as the projectile breakup is found from a single lippmann ",
    "schwinger equation ( lse ) @xcite : @xmath313 where @xmath314^{-1}$ ] is the channel resolvent which determines the asymptotic states in the elastic channel .",
    "then , wave - packet basis states corresponding to a discretization of the channel hamiltonian continuum are built as products of @xmath315 and @xmath316 sub - hamiltonian wp basis states as defined in eq .",
    "( [ si ] ) . the only difference in that we have to replace free wps over the center of mass variable with coulomb wps for the sub - hamiltonian @xmath316 .",
    "thus our wp basis in this case takes the form : latexmath:[\\[\\label{zi1 }    where @xmath3 and @xmath318 are subsystem orbital momenta while @xmath319 is a total orbital momenta of the system which assumed to be conserved .",
    "thus , after a wp - projection of wave functions and scattering operators one gets respective vectors and matrices in the channel wp space .",
    "such a wave - packet representation is eigen for the projected channel hamiltonian and the basis states from eq .",

    "eventually , after the wave - packet projecting of the scattering operators , all terms in the lse ( [ ls ] ) are reduced to a matrix form and thus the @xmath312-matrix can be found from a single matrix equation : @xmath324 where @xmath325 is the external interaction matrix in the three - body wave - packet basis and @xmath326 is a diagonal matrix of the channel resolvent ( [ dg1 ] ) taken at the total energy @xmath19 .",
    "it should be stressed that to find on - shell and half - shell @xmath312-matrix elements , it is sufficient to solve the matrix equation ( [ bold_t ] ) only for one column @xmath327 ( we use here the multi - index @xmath328 , so that the label @xmath329 corresponds to the initial state ) .",
    "the respective solution can be found from the equation @xmath330 here the notation is : @xmath331 , and @xmath332 is the unit matrix .",
    "finally , the @xmath62-matrix elements are interrelated to the vector of @xmath0-matrix elements by the relationship @xcite : @xmath333    as a particular example for such a scattering problem we consider the well known test case : the deuteron elastic scattering off @xmath334ni target  see the respective results in fig .",
    "the details of a calculation and potential parameters used can be found in ref .",
    "also we have shown @xcite that our discrete wp - solution for such a coupled - channel problem is in a very good agreement with that derived from the traditional cdcc approach in which one has to solve a large system of coupled differential equations in every partial wave .",
    "the comparison of the deuteron off @xmath335-target elastic cross sections ( in ratio to the rutherford cross section @xmath336 ) obtained in the wpcd approach with an inclusion of intermediate deuteron breakup channels ( full curve ) , with the folding model , i.e. without taking into account intermediate breakup channels , ( dashed curve ) and the experimental data ( circles ) @xcite.,width=321 ]      in many problems of quantum physics it is necessary to know an operator of effective interaction between a composite projectile and stable target or vice versa , which takes into account the virtual excitation of the incident particle ( or target ) , i.e. its dynamic polarization in the scattering process .",
    "such an operator of the effective interaction is replaced usually by some phenomenological optical potential between composite projectile and stable target ( or vise versa ) because its microscopic evaluation is often a very cumbersome problem .",
    "so the convenient approach for a theoretical calculation of the effective operator is a very good object for the theory .",
    "the wave - packet discretization method allows us to construct such operators explicitly , using the finite - dimensional representation of the channel resolvent obtained above . in this solution",
    "it is convenient to apply the feshbach projection operator formalism @xcite .    for the reader s convenience",
    ", we briefly recall a derivation of the effective operator of interaction within such projection approach for the case of composite particle scattering off a nucleus discussed in the previous subsection .",
    "consider the schroedinger equation @xmath337 for the wave function of the system defined by the hamiltonian ( [ ham_proj ] ) .",
    "let , @xmath338 be the projectile ground state with energy @xmath339 . using the above projection operator technique , one defines two projection operators : @xmath340 here @xmath341 is the projector onto the elastic channel",
    ", @xmath342 is the orthogonal projector onto all the inelastic channels . as a result",
    "the schroedinger equation for the total wave function is splitted into two coupled equations for components @xmath343 and @xmath344 : @xmath345 further , we introduce the resolvent of the hamiltonian projected onto @xmath342-subspace : @xmath346^{-1}$ ] .",
    "then , substituting the second equation in ( [ pqpsi ] ) to the first one we obtain the well known equation for the elastic scattering function @xmath343 : @xmath347 where @xmath348 is an effective nonlocal and energy - dependent operator of interaction between a composite particle and the target with taking into account all the inelastic channels .",
    "since the operators @xmath341 and @xmath349 commute , and the orthogonality condition @xmath350 is valid , the equation ( [ maineq ] ) takes the form of a conventional two - particle schroedinger equation for projection @xmath351 of the total wave function onto the elastic channel : @xmath352|\\chi_1\\rangle=0.\\ ] ] here we have introduced a folding potential @xmath353 describing the interaction of the projectile center of mass with the target nucleus when the inelastic channels corresponding to the excitation or breakup of the incident composite particle are fully neglected : @xmath354 here the integration in the the matrix element is carried out only over the internal variables .",
    "all inelastic ( and breakup ) effects are included into the non - local feshbach potential : @xmath355 despite the compact notation , the computation of this operator is in principle even more difficult problem than the solution of the original scattering problem .",
    "however , when using the wave - packet basis ( [ zi1 ] ) consisted from eigenfunctions of the channel hamiltonian the practical construction of operator @xmath356 becomes clear and straightforward .",
    "indeed , using the wave - packet states for the channel hamiltonian , one finds the finite - dimensional diagonal representation for the channel resolvent @xmath357 obtained via formulas from eq .",
    "( [ dg1 ] ) .    in the wp - approach",
    "the @xmath342-subspace is just orthogonal part of the wp subspace , so that the finite - dimensional representation for the projector @xmath342 can be written as ( we omitted possible spin - angular indices ) : @xmath358 where upper prime symbol means that the sum does not include the ground state of @xmath308 .",
    "thus the matrix representation for the projected @xmath359 operator is straightforward : @xmath360^{-1}-{\\mathfrak { v}}^q_{\\rm ext}\\}^{-1},\\ ] ] where all operators are meant as being projected onto the @xmath342-subspace .",
    "after direct evaluation of the matrix for @xmath359-operator from eq .",

    "thus , the wp approach gives a direct and convenient way to calculate an effective optical potential for an interaction of a composite particle with a stable target , also this formalism can be generalized for constructing an effective interaction between two colliding composite particles which may be excited or disintegrate in the scattering process .    in fig .",
    "[ fig_pot ] the real and imaginary parts of the effective nonlocal optical potential for the deuteron and the @xmath334ni nucleus interaction at incident deuteron energy @xmath363 mev calculated via the wp - approach are displayed for the total orbital angular momentum @xmath364 .    besides the direct calculation of the complicated nonlocal interaction operator ,",
    "the approach described above is very convenient in those cases where inelastic channels play a role of a correction to the elastic scattering when the main contribution comes from the folding potential .",
    "in such a case , one can employ the `` inner '' few - body wp basis of a rather small dimension for the calculation of the effective potential and the `` external '' two - body wp basis of a large dimension for the subsequent solution for the resulting two - body scattering problem with the total interaction including the folding potential and the above effective potential @xcite .",
    "just such a situation arises very often when the energy of collision of a composite particle with a stable target increases .",
    "the relative weight of the breakup channels decreases ( after some characteristic energy ) and thus the contribution of the effective potential taking into account the projectile breakup is reduced as in our above example .    as an illustration for such an approach we present in fig.[fig80 ] the differential cross section for elastic deuteron scattering off the nucleus @xmath334ni at energy @xmath36580 mev calculated using the above feshbach potential .",
    "the result of such optical model calculation nearly coincide with the solution of a direct three - body problem found with the cdcc approach in ref .",
    "the dimensions of the coulomb wp - basis @xmath366 used in @xmath342 projector is in five times less than the dimension of the same coulomb wp - basis used in `` external '' projector @xmath341 .",
    "let us summarize , with the described technique we are able rather easily to calculate the theoretical non - local optical potentials for a scattering of composite projectiles off stable targets ( or vice versa ) , or even for a collision of two composite particles .",
    "the most rigorous and correct formulation for the few - body scattering problem can be attained using the faddeev or faddeev  yakubovsky equations",
    ". we will demonstrate below that the wave - packet approach being applied to solving such equations gives the great advantages .",
    "here we consider a solution of the faddeev equations for a scattering of three identical particles 1 , 2 and 3 with mass @xmath367 ( nucleons ) . in this case",
    "the elastic scattering observables can be found from a single faddeev equation ( fe ) for the transition operator @xmath368 ( the so - called ags equation ) , e.g. in the following form @xcite : @xmath369 where @xmath0 is two - body off - shell @xmath0-matrix in three - body space , @xmath370 is the free three - body resolvent and @xmath371 is the permutation operator which changes the momentum variables from one jacobi set to another one .",
    "for the case of three identical particles the operator @xmath371 is defined as sum of two cyclic permutations of particles : @xmath372 it should be emphasized that a similar permutation operator is included in kernels of the faddeev equations in the case of various particles .",
    "after the spin - angular expansion , the operator equation ( [ feg ] ) for each value of the total angular momentum and parity is reduced to a system of two - dimensional integral equations in momentum space ( or to coupled two - dimensional integro - differential equations in the configuration space ) .",
    "although faddeev @xcite proved that the kernels of these equations belong to the fredholm type ( i.e. the inhomogeneous equation has a unique solution ) , a practical solution of coupled two - dimensional integral equations is a very complicated and time - consuming task due to complicated singular structure of integral kernels and also the large number of coupled spin - orbital channels .",
    "one of problems is that kernels contain two - body off - shell @xmath0-matrices @xmath373 for different values of the total orbital angular momentum and spin of the pair interacting particles , which should be calculated many times at different energies .",
    "the second problem here is that the faddeev - type kernel at real energy contains singularities of two types : two - particle cuts , corresponding to the presence of bound states in the subsystems , and the three - body logarithmic singularity ( at the breakup threshold ) .",
    "the two - body singularities are easily eliminated by the technique of residues , while for a regularization of the three - body cut a number of special techniques have been suggested in the previous years . as a result , the whole solution procedure becomes rather complicated . among such specific techniques the following",
    "are employed most often : +  choice of a special quadrature grid points for a momenta @xmath374 defined in one jacobi set depending on a momentum @xmath76 defined in another jacobi set together with the spline interpolation of an unknown function at iteration method of solving ; +  solution of the equations at the complex energy plane followed by an analytic continuation to the real axis ; +  shift for an integration contour from the real axis to the complex momentum plane .    however , the main characteristic feature of the faddeev kernels is the presence of the particle permutation operator @xmath371 .",
    "the kernel of this operator @xmath375 as a function of the momenta contains @xmath376-function and two @xmath101-functions and this results in variable integration limits for integrals in the faddeev kernels @xcite .",
    "therefore , when replacing the integrals with respective quadrature sums in numerical procedure it is necessary to apply an interpolation of the unknown solution depending on several variables at each step of an iterative procedure . as a result of",
    "such elaborated multi - dimensional interpolation on each iteration step , the interpolation procedure takes most of the computational time of the whole computation and requires usage of powerful supercomputers @xcite ) .",
    "on contrast to this , the wp method described here allows to circumvent completely the above difficulties in solving the faddeev ( and faddeev  yakubovsky ) equations .",
    "first of all , instead of eq .",
    "( [ feg ] ) , one uses the equivalent form of the faddeev equation for the transition operator @xmath377 @xcite : @xmath378 in eq .",
    "( [ pvg ] ) @xmath287 is the three - body channel resolvent introduced in section 6 . due to",
    "the identity @xmath379 the kernels of the equations ( [ feg ] ) and ( [ pvg ] ) are the same and their solutions @xmath368 and @xmath377 coincide on - shell and half - shell .",
    "this form of the equation is especially useful in the wp representation with basis functions corresponding to the channel hamiltonian @xmath249 , because in this representation the resolvent @xmath287 has a simple analytical form and explicitly depends only on the partitions of the continuous spectrum of the subsystem .",
    "thereby the need for multiple calculations and interpolation of the off - shell @xmath0-matrix is eliminated .",
    "further , all the singularities of the faddeev kernel in the form ( [ pvg ] ) are concentrated in the channel resolvent @xmath287 and they are smoothed when projecting on the wp basis ( averaged by the integration over the energy bins ) . therefore the resulting matrix equation can be solved directly for real energies .",
    "finally , the use of matrix of permutation in the wp basis ( as well as in any other fixed basis ) completely eliminates the need for very numerous interpolations of the required solution at each iteration .",
    "so , all these innovations taken together lead to great simplification in practical solving the faddeev - type few - body scattering equations .      to illustrate this novel technique we consider the realistic nd scattering problem , where one needs to particularize the three - body wave - packet basis for the case of three - nucleon system with tensor @xmath135 interactions .",
    "we use the following quantum numbers for the subsystems defined in section [ three ] and in the whole three - body system according to the @xmath381-coupling scheme : @xmath382 where @xmath383 and @xmath384 are the @xmath135 subsystem quantum numbers : @xmath3 is an orbital momentum , @xmath93 is a spin and @xmath385 is a total angular momentum of the subsystem ( the interaction potential depends , in general , on the value of @xmath384 ) .",
    "the other quantum numbers are the following : @xmath386 is an orbital momentum and @xmath387 is a total momentum of the third nucleon , where @xmath388 is its spin .",
    "finally , @xmath389 is a total angular momentum of the three - body system , @xmath312 is a total isospin and @xmath390 is parity , all of them are being conserved .",
    "let s also note that the pair isospin @xmath0 can be defined by values of @xmath3 and @xmath93 , because the sum @xmath391 must be odd .",
    "the two - body free wp states ( [ pq ] ) should be defined for each partial wave @xmath3 and @xmath318 and further they are multiplied by appropriate spin - angular states according to ( [ qnum ] ) .",
    "thus the free three - body basis function ( [ xij ] ) can be written in the detailed form : latexmath:[\\[\\label{xij1 }     the three - body wp states corresponding to the channel hamiltonian @xmath249 are defined here as has been detailed in section  [ three ] . however now one has to take into account all possible spin - angular couplings in @xmath254 subsystem induced by tensor couplings in @xmath253 interaction , so the two - body scattering wps of @xmath273 sub - hamiltonian must be defined in the eigenchannel representation as in eq .",
    "( [ mult_zi ] ) .",
    "then , three - body channel wp states have the following form : @xmath393 where the spin - angular quantum numbers @xmath394 in @xmath254 subsystem corresponds to the eigenchannel representation and differs from those , i.e. @xmath178 , for the free wp basis . in particular , instead of an angular momentum value @xmath3 this index contains eigenchannel value @xmath209 , so @xmath395 while @xmath396 .",
    "these states are the wp analogs for the three - body scattering states @xmath397 of the channel hamiltonian @xmath249 , where @xmath398 is a scattering wave function of @xmath273 sub - hamiltonian defined in the er .    in section 5 , it was shown that the pseudostates obtained via the diagonalization sub - hamiltonian @xmath273 in a free wp basis are good approximations for the exact wps @xmath399 constructed from the scattering wave functions for @xmath273 .",

    "the use of a finite - dimensional approximation for the permutation operator , i.e. replacing it with a fixed matrix ( in any basis ) , avoids the need for numerous and time - consuming multi - dimensional interpolations of a current solution during the iteration process . in the standard approaches , these interpolations",
    "take the most of the computing time .",
    "although in the calculation of matrix elements of permutation operator in our approach also meets some difficulties  multiple integrals with variable limits , however these matrix elements are computed with simple functions .",
    "nevertheless , the calculation of the permutation matrix @xmath418 takes the major part of computing time in our algorithm in sequential execution on the cpu .",
    "but it should be stressed that the matrix @xmath418 is independent of energy and therefore being calculated at once , it can be used to solve scattering problem at so many energies as we wish .",
    "note also that due to energy conservation ( @xmath457 , where subscripts 1 and 2 indicate the different jacobi sets , the permutations matrix @xmath418 is very sparse  only about 1  % its matrix elements are nonzero .",
    "point 3 is based on the main feature of the wp representation .",
    "it is just the advantage of the wp basis that the resolvent matrix @xmath458 for the channel hamiltonian @xmath249 is diagonal , does not depend explicitly on interaction potentials and its elements are determined only by the partitions of two - dimensional bins and the total energy @xmath19 using explicit formulas .",
    "the only difficulty in the practical solution of the matrix equation ( [ m_pvg ] ) is its high dimensionality  that is the price for the elimination of the basic difficulties of a standard approach to solving the faddeev equation .",
    "solution of an algebraic system of such high dimensionality is an untrivial problem even for a supercomputer .",
    "but in our approach we do not need in solution for the whole system . indeed , to find the elastic and breakup amplitudes one needs only on - shell matrix elements of the transition operator .",
    "each of these elements can be found by means of a simple iteration procedure ( without complete solving the matrix equation ( [ m_pvg ] ) ) with subsequent summation of the iterations via the pade - approximant technique .",
    "note that the same pade - technique is used in the standard approach to the solution of the faddeev equations @xcite .",
    "as was mentioned earlier , the main computational effort in our case is spent on the calculation of the free wps overlap matrix @xmath459 . because these elements are computed independently from each other",
    ", the algorithm is very appropriate for parallelization and implementation on multiprocessor systems , in particular on a graphics processing unit ( gpu ) .",
    "we have adopted the multi - thread gpu algorithm for a fully realistic calculations for @xmath429 scattering above the breakup threshold and have attained the great ( more than tenfold ) acceleration in a comparison with the calculation on the same pc without using gpu  @xcite . the fig .",
    "[ accel_gpu ] illustrates dependence of the gpu - acceleration in the solution of the faddeev equation with a realistic @xmath135 interaction on the dimension of the wp basis .",
    "the distinctive feature of the gpu - calculations is that the acceleration grows with increasing the basis dimension which is clearly seen in figure .",
    "it has been suggested @xcite , that the @xmath429 scattering problem can be solved by constructing an effective @xmath429 interaction potential .",
    "indeed , let us consider again the equation for the transition operator ( [ pvg ] ) and divide the channel resolvent @xmath287 into two parts ( according to the projectors @xmath341 and @xmath342 introduced in the section 7 ) @xmath460 it is evident that this division corresponds just to bound - continuum and continuum - continuum parts of the channel resolvent , i.e. @xmath461 and @xmath462 , where the first operator contains channel states including deuteron bound state @xmath338 .",
    "then , instead of a single equation ( [ pvg ] ) , one can derive two equations : @xmath463 it is easy to see that the first equation essentially determines the elastic amplitude and is an equation for two - particle scattering , while the second equation defines just the effective interaction potential of deuteron as whole with an incident neutron and takes into account inelastic processes .    in the traditional approach ,",
    "the solution of equation ( [ calv ] ) is practically very hard , because it requires knowledge of the channel resolvent in the subspace orthogonal to the bound state ( i.e. its continuum - continuum part ) . in the wp approach",
    ", the solution of this equation presents no difficulty , since the channel resolvent @xmath464 is well known here . then the method for solving the problem of @xmath429 scattering by means of effective potentials",
    "can be represented schematically as follows :    * introduction of the 3wp basis for the channel hamiltonian and construction of an analytical finite - dimensional representation for @xmath465 operator ; * solution of eq .",
    "( [ calv ] ) in the above wp representation ; * solution of eq .",
    "( [ cal_u ] ) in a two - body free wp basis using a matrix form of @xmath466 operator obtained at the previous stage .",
    "we described in the present paper a general technique for the continuum discretization in few - body scattering problem based on projection of scattering operators and respective wave functions onto the discrete basis of stationary wave packets .",
    "the basic idea behind the approach is a similarity ( within some restricted space ) of exact non - normalized scattering states of the hamiltonian and the respective discrete and normalized wave - packet basis states . so that , such a wp projection allows us to transform the complicated singular multi - dimensional integral equations describing scattering ( like general lippmann  schwinger or faddeev  yakubovsky equations ) to regular matrix equations which can be solved directly within computational procedures similar to those used in bound - state calculations .",
    "this novel approach has a few characteristic features which allow to simplify drastically the whole solution of few- and many - body scattering equations .",
    "first , owing to some averaging the integral kernels over the momentum cells , all their complicated moving singularities are smoothed out and as a result one gets the simple matrix equations with finite matrix elements .",
    "this allows one to solve the resulting matrix equations directly on real energy axis without any contour deformation , continuation to complex energy plane or special interpolation procedures .",
    "second , instead of fully off - shell @xmath0-matrix at many energies entering the integral kernel in a conventional approach , one uses the initial potential ( the matrix of which is calculated easily ) and the matrix of the channel resolvent which is found by means of explicit formulas .",
    "third , the exact scattering wave packets in pair subsystems are treated as usual normalized excited states .",
    "this makes possible to consider a three - body breakup process as an inelastic scattering to normalized pseudostates .",
    "such a replacement simplifies greatly the description of three- and few - body breakup processes .",
    "fourth , due to a specific matrix structure of resulting matrix equations one can organize the massively - parallel computing with use of the graphics processing unit .",
    "this makes it possible to carry out all the computations via many thousands of threads on the gpu inside a desktop pc and leads to real ultra - fast calculations for the scattering problems in few - body systems .",
    "the developed wave - packet approach to solving few - body scattering problems is universal and may be used in different branches of nuclear , atomic and chemical physics , in quantum statistics and nuclear matter theory .",
    "also it can be directly generalized to a relativistic case .",
