    "thermal fluctuations of the order parameter are known to change effective anisotropy of a cubic ferromagnet approaching the curie point . as was first discovered by wilson and fisher",
    "a system with cubic symmetry may become isotropic under @xmath9 provided its initial anisotropy is small enough @xcite . on the contrary , if the `` bare '' anisotropy is big it increases further until the fluctuation - driven discontinuous phase transition occurs @xcite .",
    "if a ferromagnet undergoes the second - order phase transition , i. e. its initial anisotropy is not too strong , and the low - temperature phase is orthorhombic , under @xmath9 the anisotropy of magnetic subsystem acquires the universal value which does not depend on its magnitude far from the curie point .",
    "as was revealed in the course of the study of critical behavior of @xmath6-vector cubic model , the order parameter dimensionality @xmath6 plays a key role here : for @xmath10 the system undergoing continuous phase transition demonstrates isotropic critical behavior while for @xmath11 it remains anisotropic at @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the numerical value of the marginal spin dimensionality @xmath12 separating these two regimes is of prime physical importance since it determines the true mode of the critical behavior of real cubic ferromagnets .",
    "early estimates of @xmath12 deduced from the lower - order renormalization - group ( rg ) calculations @xcite turned out to be in favor of the inequality @xmath13 implying that cubic ferromagnets should belong to the class of universality of the three - dimensional ( 3d ) heisenberg model . the results obtained within the high - temperature expansion approach seemed to support this conclusion @xcite . however , the resummation of the three - loop rg expansions @xcite and subsequent higher - order rg analysis both in three @xcite and @xmath14 @xcite dimensions as well as advanced lattice calculations shifted the value of @xmath12 downwards fixing it below 3 @xcite .",
    "impressive consensus between different field - theoretical approaches and resummation techniques was achieved in the course of this study : 3d rg calculations @xcite , resummed @xmath4 expansions @xcite , biased @xmath4 expansion technique @xcite , and pseudo-@xmath4 expansion analysis @xcite yielded @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , respectively . thus , cubic ferromagnets undergoing second - order phase transitions should demonstrate the anisotropic critical behavior with a specific set of critical exponents .    on the other hand ,",
    "since @xmath12 is very close to the physical value @xmath7 , the cubic fixed point lies very near the heisenberg fixed point at the rg flow diagram .",
    "it implies that the critical exponents for both fixed points should almost coincide .",
    "indeed , the susceptibility exponent @xmath19 , for instance , is equal to 1.3895(50 ) for the heisenberg fixed point @xcite and to 1.390(6 ) for the cubic one @xcite . as a result ,",
    "measuring critical exponents in physical or computer experiments one can not distinguish between the cubic and heisenberg critical behaviors .",
    "to clear up how the system with cubic symmetry behaves near @xmath0 one should explore some alternative physical quantities .",
    "it was suggested @xcite that nonlinear susceptibilities of different orders can play a role of indicators of anisotropic critical behavior .",
    "the rg analysis of the lowest - order nonlinear susceptibility @xmath20 , in particular , has shown that its reduced cubic anisotropy may be as large as 5@xmath21 at criticality @xcite , i. e. is certainly detectable experimentally .",
    "at the same time , although this estimate was extracted from the longest  six - loop ",
    "rg expansions available it is hardly believed to be quite reliable .",
    "the point is that the anisotropy of @xmath20 is evaluated via the cubic fixed point coordinates @xmath22 and @xmath23 and one of them ( @xmath23 ) being numerically small can not be found with high accuracy on the base of the diverging series for @xmath24 functions .",
    "in such a situation it looks natural to analyze the nonlinear susceptibility of cubic ferromagnets and its anisotropy near @xmath0 using alternative approaches . in this paper",
    ", the anisotropy of @xmath20 of the 3d cubic model will be studied in the framework of the pseudo-@xmath4 expansion technique .",
    "this approach invented by b. nickel ( see ref .",
    "19 in the paper of le guillou and zinn - justin @xcite ) exploits the idea that the fixed point location in three dimensions may be found iteratively by means of introducing fictitious small parameter @xmath25 into linear terms of the perturbative series for @xmath24 functions .",
    "the method of pseudo-@xmath4 expansion proved to be very efficient when used to estimate critical exponents and other universal quantities of various three - dimensional systems @xcite .",
    "moreover , even in two dimensions where rg series are shorter and more strongly divergent it enables one to get fair numerical results @xcite .",
    "the numerical power of the pseudo-@xmath4 expansion machinery , i. e. its ability to accelerate rg iterations and to smooth oscillations of numerical estimates as functions of the order of approximation , is so high that in many cases pseudo-@xmath4 expansions ( @xmath25-series ) employed do not require advanced resummation procedures . as a rule ,",
    "use of pad approximants or even direct summation turns out to be sufficient to lead to proper numerical results .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "the nonlinear susceptibility @xmath20 of the cubic model is discussed , the parameter @xmath26 characterizing its anisotropy is introduced , and the relation between @xmath26 and effective quartic coupling constants @xmath27 , @xmath28 is presented . in section 3 pseudo-@xmath4 expansions for the cubic fixed point coordinates @xmath22 and @xmath23 and for the critical value of the reduced anisotropy @xmath26 are derived for arbitrary @xmath6 .",
    "the @xmath25-series for @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath5 at @xmath7 which are of particular physical interest are presented in section 4 . here",
    "the resummation of the pseudo-@xmath4 expansions obtained is carried out and the numerical estimate for the reduced anisotropy at criticality is presented . in section 5",
    "this estimate is compared with those given by the 3d rg analysis , their deviation from each other is discussed , and the robustness of the pseudo-@xmath4 expansion estimate is demonstrated .",
    "conclusion contains the summary of the main results obtained .",
    "near curie point the free energy of a cubic ferromagnet may be written down as a series in powers of magnetization components @xmath29 : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a fisher exponent , @xmath32 being an inverse correlation length while @xmath33 and @xmath34 are dimensionless effective coupling constants that acquire under @xmath9 the universal values .",
    "these coupling constants are related to the fourth - order nonlinear susceptibility defined in a conventional way : @xmath35    of particular importance are the values of nonlinear susceptibility in two cases , namely when i ) an external field is parallel to a cubic axis ( @xmath36 ) and ii ) it is oriented along a unit cell space diagonal ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "for these two directions the difference between corresponding values of nonlinear susceptibility turns out to be maximal , i. e. the anisotropy is most pronounced . as may be readily shown @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a linear susceptibility . to characterize the anisotropy strength , we define a reduced parameter @xmath40 that is to be estimated at criticality .    before starting our pseudo-@xmath4 expansion calculations",
    "let us remind the estimate for the critical value of @xmath26 originating from the 3d rg analysis .",
    "coordinates of the cubic fixed point @xmath41 and @xmath42 in three dimensions are known today from the higher - order rg calculations , with resummed four- , five- , and six - loop rg expansions yielding close numerical results @xcite .",
    "considering the six - loop rg estimates as the most reliable ones , we accept @xmath43 , @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "substitution of these numbers into eqs .",
    "( 3 ) , ( 4 ) gives @xmath45 this value will be compared with those resulting from the pseudo-@xmath4 expansions for universal values of the quartic couplings as well as from the @xmath25-series for @xmath5 itself .",
    "these series are derived in the next section .",
    "let us take as a starting point well - known landau  wilson hamiltonian of the 3d @xmath6-vector cubic model : @xmath46 , \\label{eq:6}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is proportional to the deviation from the mean - field transition temperature .",
    "our analysis is based on the @xmath24 functions ( gell - mann  low functions ) of this model calculated within a massive theory under zero - momenta normalizing conditions for the renormalized green function @xmath48 and the four - point vertices @xmath49 , @xmath50 : @xmath51 the value of the one - loop graph including the factor @xmath52 is absorbed in @xmath53 and @xmath54 in order to make the coefficient for @xmath55 term in the @xmath56 function equal to unity .",
    "quartic effective couplings @xmath53 and @xmath54 thus defined are related to @xmath33 and @xmath34 entering eqs .",
    "( 1 ) , ( 3 ) in a following manner : @xmath57    the perturbative expansions for @xmath24 functions of the model ( 6 ) are known today up to the six - loop terms @xcite .",
    "although the cubic fixed point of the rg equations is stable only for @xmath11 we derive the pseudo-@xmath4 expansions for coordinates of this point @xmath2 , @xmath3 under arbitrary @xmath6 . to find them the linear terms in @xmath24 functions",
    "are replaced with @xmath58 and @xmath59 , respectively , where @xmath25 is a fictitious small parameter , and then the equations @xmath60 are solved iteratively in @xmath25 .",
    "this procedure results in the pseudo-@xmath4 expansions ( @xmath25-series ) for @xmath2 and @xmath3 : @xmath61 , \\label{eq:10}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath62 . \\label{eq:11}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    these pseudo-@xmath4 expansions should obey some exact relations appropriate to the systems with cubic anisotropy . for @xmath63 the cubic model is known to possess a specific symmetry : if the field @xmath64 undergoes the transformation @xmath65 quartic coupling constants are also transformed : @xmath66 but the structure of the hamiltonian itself remains unchanged @xcite . since the rg functions of the problem are completely determined by the structure of the hamiltonian , the rg equations should be invariant with respect to any transformation conserving this structure @xcite",
    ". this should be also true for all the expressions relating various physical quantities to each other .",
    "if , for example , one applies under @xmath63 the transformation ( 12 ) to the magnetization components in eq .",
    "( 1 ) , the free - energy expansion remains the same , provided @xmath33 , @xmath34 are replaced according to eq .",
    "( 13 ) .",
    "since the transformation ( 12 ) , ( 13 ) does not influence the structure of the rg equations it should map corresponding flow diagram into itself .",
    "this implies , in particular , that the locations of different fixed points at the ( @xmath53 , @xmath54 ) plane should be related to each other .",
    "indeed , if we apply the transformation ( 13 ) to the ising fixed point ( 0 , @xmath67 ) lying on the @xmath54 axis it will turn into the fixed point with coordinates ( @xmath68 , @xmath69 ) , i. e. into the cubic fixed point , and vice versa .",
    "both fixed points have similar character of stability  they are unstable ( saddle ) fixed point .",
    "this similarity is quite natural since because of the specific symmetry mentioned these points are equivalent being , in fact , the same fixed point .",
    "for @xmath63 the pseudo-@xmath4 expansions for the coordinates of the cubic fixed point resulting from ( 10 ) , ( 11 ) are as follows @xmath70 @xmath71 under the transformation ( 13 ) the cubic fixed point turns into the ising one .",
    "hence , the sum @xmath72 should be equal to zero .",
    "as is seen , @xmath25-series ( 14 ) and ( 15 ) do really obey the relation @xmath73 .",
    "moreover , due to the same symmetry the series ( 15 ) should coincide with the pseudo-@xmath4 expansion for the wilson fixed point coordinate @xmath67 of the 3d ising model .",
    "one can easily check , making obvious rescaling , that the expansion ( 15 ) is identical to the six - loop @xmath25-series for @xmath67 reported in ref .",
    "26 .    at the end of this section we present the pseudo-@xmath4 expansion for",
    "the reduced anisotropy @xmath5 : @xmath74 note that all the terms of the series ( 16 ) apart from the first one vanish when @xmath75 .",
    "this reflects the specific symmetry discussed above which enables , in particular , to find the exact value of the reduced anisotropy under @xmath63 .",
    "indeed , substituting the coordinates of the cubic fixed point ( @xmath68 , @xmath69 ) into the relation @xmath76 resulting from ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) we obtain @xmath77 for @xmath63 .",
    "the pseudo-@xmath4 expansion ( 16 ) is seen to be in accord with this result .",
    "let us use the pseudo-@xmath4 expansions just obtained to estimate the critical values of effective coupling constants and reduced anisotropy for cubic ferromagnets , i. e. in the physical case @xmath7 .",
    "relevant @xmath25-series are as follows : @xmath78 @xmath79 @xmath80 these expansions originating from the diverging rg series for @xmath24 functions are divergent as well . hence , to obtain from ( 18)(20 ) the numbers of interest proper resummation procedures should be applied . on the other hand , since these series have small higher - order coefficients a direct summation may result in fair numerical estimates . when applied to the series ( 20 ) it yields , under @xmath81 , @xmath82 .",
    "this number differs considerably from the estimate @xmath83 given by the 3d rg analysis @xcite .",
    "the estimate just found may be corrected if we accept that the pseudo-@xmath4 expansions in hand are asymptotic and one can get the best numerical results cutting off the series by smallest terms .",
    "such an optimally truncated direct summation of @xmath25-series ( 20 ) leads to @xmath84 .",
    "an alternative way to estimate @xmath5 with a help of direct summation is to find the universal values of quartic coupling constants and to use the relation ( 17 ) .",
    "direct summation of the series ( 18 ) , ( 19 ) under @xmath81 gives @xmath85 , @xmath86 resulting in @xmath87 .",
    "the estimates of @xmath5 thus obtained are appreciably scattered and obviously need to be refined .",
    "since the coefficients of all the @xmath25-series employed rapidly diminish simple resummation procedures not addressing the borel transformation may be applied .",
    "use of pad approximants [ l / m ] looks quite reasonable in our case .",
    "first we perform the pad resummation of the series for @xmath5 itself .",
    "pad triangle for the pseudo-@xmath4 expansion ( 20 ) is presented in table i. as one can see , pad estimates converge to the value @xmath88    an alternative estimate of the reduced anisotropy is obtained via pad resummation of the @xmath25-series for @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "corresponding pad triangles are shown in tables ii and iii .",
    "the values of coupling constants this resummation technique results in are seen to be : @xmath89 the first number almost coincides with its counterpart @xmath90 found by means of the conform - borel analysis of the original six - loop expansions for @xmath24 functions @xcite while the second one differs substantially from its 3d rg analog @xmath91 .",
    "a substitution of the numbers ( 22 ) into ( 20 ) gives @xmath92 the value which is close to the pad estimate ( 21 ) .",
    "averaging over these two numbers we obtain @xmath93 this value may be referred to as a final estimate the pseudo-@xmath4 expansion machinery yields for the reduced anisotropy of cubic ferromagnet at criticality . in order to make this estimate realistic ( certainly conservative ) we accepted its inaccuracy to be three times bigger than the difference between pad - approximant - based values ( 23 ) and ( 21 ) .",
    "so , the pseudo-@xmath4 expansion technique leads to the value of the reduced anisotropy which almost 1.5 times greater than its rg analogue @xmath83 .",
    "how can one explain such a significant difference of the two field - theoretical estimates obtained within the highest - order available  six - loop ",
    "the roots of such a discrepancy may lie in some peculiarity of the @xmath25-series for @xmath5 : the numerical value of the anisotropy is much smaller than the coefficients of the first terms of the series ( 19 ) , and it is calculated as a small difference of big numbers .",
    "the same is true , as seen from ( 18 ) , for the coupling constant @xmath3 .",
    "this smallness , in its turn , reflects the fact that the boundary dimensionality of the order parameter @xmath12 is close to 3 .",
    "if @xmath12 coincided with the physical value of @xmath6 , then the anisotropy parameter would be equal to zero at the critical point .",
    "since the difference @xmath94 is numerically small ( @xmath95 ) , the values of @xmath5 and @xmath3 turn out to be small as well .",
    "however , precisely for this difference various field - theoretical schemes provide significantly different estimates .",
    "for example , the processing of the six - loop 3d rg expansions for @xmath24 functions of the cubic model by means of the conform - borel technique leads to @xmath96 @xcite , while the values of this difference obtained by the resummation of the pseudo-@xmath4 and @xmath4 expansions for @xmath12 equal 0.138 @xcite and 0.145 @xcite , respectively .",
    "since the first of the above mentioned numbers differs from the others by tenths of percents , it is not surprising that a difference of values of @xmath5 , obtained within the same iteration schemes , turns out to be significant .",
    "to make the situation more transparent we calculate the cubic fixed point coordinate @xmath3 , closely related to @xmath5 , as a function of @xmath6 .",
    "the curves @xmath97 obtained by means of pad resummation of the pseudo-@xmath4 expansion ( 11 ) under @xmath6 varying between 2.80 and 3.00 are shown in fig .",
    "since diagonal pad approximants are known to possess the best approximating properties , this figure contains curves given by the highest - order near - diagonal approximants [ 3/2 ] , [ 2/3 ] , and by the diagonal one [ 2/2 ] .",
    "the value of @xmath3 the six - loop 3d rg analysis yields is also shown along with the values of marginal spin dimensionality @xmath12 extracted from the 6-loop 3d rg series @xcite , from the @xmath4 expansion @xcite , and from the pseudo-@xmath4 expansion @xcite for @xmath12 .",
    "comparing 3d rg and pseudo-@xmath4 expansions estimates one can clearly see that the closer @xmath12 is to 3 , the smaller @xmath3 and reduced anisotropy are at criticality .    keeping in mind this point it is worthy to determine a real accuracy the pseudo-@xmath4 expansion technique provides when used to estimate the marginal spin dimensionality . obviously , the accuracy of such an estimate is limited by the accuracy achieved in the course of evaluating the cubic fixed point coordinate and reduced anisotropy for @xmath6 under which @xmath97 and @xmath98 vanish .",
    "this accuracy , in its turn , may be characterized by the sensitivity of the numerical results with respect to iteration procedures employed .",
    "to get an idea about this sensitivity we calculate @xmath12 by means of solving equations @xmath99 with left - hand sides given by the series ( 11 ) and ( 16 ) respectively resummed using various pad approximants .",
    "the results of these calculations are presented in tables 4 and 5 .",
    "alternative estimates of @xmath12 thus obtained  2.860 and 2.853  are remarkably close to each other and to the value @xmath100 given by the pad resummation of the pseudo-@xmath4 series for @xmath12 itself @xcite .",
    "hence , the pseudo-@xmath4 expansion machinery may be thought of as a self - consistent iteration scheme .",
    "moreover , the pseudo-@xmath4 expansion estimates agree well with the values 2.87 and 2.855 the resummation of the @xmath4 expansion for @xmath12 yields @xcite .",
    "all this enables us to accept @xmath101 as a most reliable numerical value of the marginal spin dimensionality .",
    "this number differs appreciably from the six - loop 3d rg estimate @xmath102 @xcite although both estimates are not in conflict since their uncertainty bars overlap .",
    "3d rg estimates , however , look less accurate because of their sensitivity to the order of approximation . indeed ,",
    "5-loop 3d rg estimate @xmath103 @xcite and its 6-loop analog differ from each other much stronger than their pseudo-@xmath4 expansion counterparts do . to demonstrate this we address the pseudo-@xmath4 series for @xmath12 @xmath104 obtained from ( 11 ) by means of solving equation @xmath105 iteratively .",
    "numerical values of @xmath12 the pad resummation of the series ( 27 ) yields are shown in table 6 .",
    "as is seen , the pseudo-@xmath4 expansion estimates rapidly converge to the asymptotic value and the deviation of the six - loop result from the five - loop one is really tiny ( smaller than 0.0001 ) @xcite .    with the value of @xmath12 in hand",
    ", we can get an alternative estimate of @xmath3 .",
    "since @xmath3 at @xmath106 is known to be zero and the difference @xmath107 is numerically small the value of @xmath3 for @xmath7 may be found from the power series @xmath108 the derivatives entering ( 28 ) may be evaluated by means of the processing of their pseudo-@xmath4 expansions that are easily extracted from the series ( 11 ) .",
    "under @xmath109 they are as follows : @xmath110 @xmath111 good approximating properties of the @xmath25-series ( 29 ) are well pronounced , the expansion ( 30 ) also looks suitable for resummation .",
    "use of pad approximants to process these series results in @xmath112 taking into account that the higher - order contributions in ( 28 ) are negligibly small and substituting numbers ( 31 ) into this power series we get @xmath113 the first number obtained differs from its counterpart ( 22 ) by 10% only while the second one is in agreement with the estimate ( 24 ) .",
    "this allows us to adopt that the true values of universal quantities @xmath12 and @xmath5 lye within the uncertainty bars of our final estimates ( 24 ) and ( 26 ) .",
    "this confirms also the conclusion that the pseudo-@xmath4 expansion machinery is the self - consistent procedure powerful enough to yield accurate numerical results .",
    "so , use of the pseudo-@xmath4 expansion technique enabled us to refine the value of reduced anisotropy @xmath5 which turned out to be 1.5 times higher than that given by the conventional 3d rg analysis .",
    "this makes the arguments in favor of the possibility of experimental detection of the anisotropic critical behavior in cubic ferromagnets @xcite more convincing .",
    "to summarize , we have analyzed the behavior of nonlinear susceptibility of a cubic ferromagnet near curie point within the pseudo-@xmath4 expansion approach . for the @xmath6-vector cubic model the six - loop pseudo-@xmath4 expansions for the cubic fixed point coordinates and reduced anisotropy have been derived for general @xmath6 . under the physical value",
    "@xmath7 these expansions have been found to possess a structure favorable for getting numerical estimates .",
    "having processed the @xmath25-series for @xmath114 and @xmath115 and the pseudo-@xmath4 expansion for @xmath5 by means of the pad approximants we ve found the estimate @xmath8 which turned out to be considerably greater than its 3d rg counterpart .",
    "this discrepancy has been argued to reflect the fact that the value of the marginal spin dimensionality @xmath12 given by the six - loop 3d rg analysis differs appreciably from that obtained within the pseudo-@xmath4 expansion and @xmath4 expansion approaches .",
    "the evaluation of @xmath3 and @xmath5 via @xmath12 has been performed and has shown that alternative pseudo-@xmath4 expansion estimates are mutually consistent what allows to consider them as certainly reliable .",
