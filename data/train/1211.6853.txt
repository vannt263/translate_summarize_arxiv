    "tio@xmath0 in the rutile structure has been classified as an incipient ferroelectric material , based on the experimental observation that the dielectric permittivity is exceptionally large and increases with decreasing temperature , although no ferroelectric transition occurs even for @xmath1  k.@xcite the realization of ferroelectric tio@xmath0 , or even the possibility to efficiently tune its dielectric constant , would be of great technological importance , since tio@xmath0 is a cheap material with well optimized processing methods , which is used for a variety of applications such as optical coating,@xcite solar cells,@xcite or sensors.@xcite many of these applications are based on properties involving the rutile ( 110)-surface , which is the technologically most relevant and therefore best - studied rutile surface.@xcite    previous theoretical _ ab initio _ studies have shown that in the corresponding bulk material the anomalous behavior of the dielectric constant is a consequence of a low - frequency polar ( a@xmath2 ) phonon mode,@xcite which softens under negative pressure or uniaxial tensile strain along the ( 001)-axis.@xcite liu _ et al . _ classified the phase transition between the paraelectric and ferroelectric phases to be of second order .",
    "since the resulting magnitude of the ionic off - centering as well as the electric polarization are in the same range as for prototypical ferroelectrics such as pbtio@xmath3 or batio@xmath3 , an enforced ferroelectric transition would lead to a technologically relevant ferroelectric material .",
    "furthermore , mitev _ et al .",
    "_ found a large region within the brillouin zone with a low lying phonon branch which may be linked to the structural relaxation of the rutile ( 110 ) surface.@xcite these authors also pointed out a softening of this mode under uniaxial strain in both [ 001 ] and [ 110 ] directions , and found that the ferroelectric a@xmath2-mode is quite insensitive towards [ 110]-oriented strain .",
    "in contrast , we have shown more recently that the a@xmath2-mode indeed also softens under [ 110 ] strain , but that a different polar mode , an e@xmath4 mode polarized along [ 110 ] , becomes even more unstable than the a@xmath2 mode under this strain orientation.@xcite under uniaxial tensile [ 110 ] strain , we have thus found a second order phase transition to a ferroelectric phase with polarization along [ 110].@xcite in agreement with these results , a softening both of the a@xmath2 mode and of the lowest e@xmath4 mode has also been found in ref .   for tensile uniaxial [ 001 ] strain and for an isotropic lattice expansion within the ( 100)/(010 ) plane .",
    "since the strain dependence of the two polar modes is different , this opens up the interesting possibility to `` strain engineer '' the polarization direction .",
    "it is well known that ferroelectric or dielectric properties can be significantly modified at surfaces in comparison with the corresponding bulk material .",
    "first of all , a polarization along the surface normal induces a depolarizing field , and is therefore often suppressed in thin films ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) .",
    "second , the reduced coordination of the surface atoms may prevent or enhance ferroelectric trends,@xcite as the dipolar interaction and the short - range repulsion are both modified .",
    "finally , the surface - induced atomic relaxations can also modify the bonding and thus the ferroelectric properties .",
    "for example , it has been discussed whether the surface relaxation and the unsaturated bonds at the surface are able to destabilize the paraelectric state , leading to a finite electric polarization in the related incipient ferroelectric material srtio@xmath3.@xcite we also note that a ferroelectric transition has been observed experimentally in strained srtio@xmath3 films.@xcite therefore , an obvious approach to achieve a ferroelectric transition in rutile is the growth of strained thin tio@xmath0 films .    in view of this , it is essential to test the modifications of the ferroelectric properties of the strained tio@xmath0 ( 110 ) surface , as considerable differences may appear compared to the bulk case . nevertheless , to the best of our knowledge no such investigation of the ferroelectric trends of this tio@xmath0 surface has been undertaken until now .    in the present paper",
    "we first present a systematic comparison of the effects of different lattice modifications on the ferroelectric properties of bulk rutile tio@xmath0 .",
    "we show that each lattice modification which affects the nearest neighbor ti - o distances within the crystal , can stabilize a ferroelectric phase polarized along ( 001 ) .",
    "additionally , we discuss the fundamental mechanisms for the incipient ferroelectric behavior of rutile tio@xmath0 in the framework of born effective charges .",
    "we then present the _ ab initio _ investigation of the ferroelectric trends of the tio@xmath0 rutile surface .",
    "although we find strong surface - induced relaxations and modifications of the electronic structure , which have a considerable influence on the ferroelectric properties , the strong ferroelectric tendencies of the bulk material are essentially retained at the surface .",
    "in addition , two different ferroelectric states with polarization within the surface plane can be stabilized for strained tio@xmath0 films . here ,",
    "local dipoles both along ( 001 ) and along ( @xmath5 can be stabilized within the surface at 2  % uniaxial strain .",
    "furthermore the magnitude of the polarization increases as the strain is enlarged to 5  % .",

    "the electronic structure of tio@xmath0 is calculated using first - principles density functional theory.@xcite most calculations are performed by employing the vienna ab initio simulation package ( vasp 5.2.2)@xcite based on projector augmented wave pseudo - potentials.@xcite born effective charges and the dielectric permittivity are calculated within vasp using density functional perturbation theory.@xcite the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) in the formulation of perdew , burke and ernzerhof ( pbe)@xcite is used for the exchange correlation energy , with @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) electrons treated as valence for ti ( o ) .",
    "although small inaccuracies may result from the use of such a soft ti pseudopotential,@xcite we could not find qualitative differences in the description of the electronic and dielectric properties compared to an enlarged valence basis set and thus stick to the minimal valence electron basis .",
    "a planewave cutoff of 500  ev , an energy convergence better than @xmath8ev , and at least @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) k - points constructed with the monkhorst - pack@xcite scheme for bulk ( films ) guarantee sufficient accuracy of our calculations . a gaussian smearing of 0.1  ev is used for most calculations in order to improve the convergence with respect to the number of k - points .",
    "this smearing is reduced to 0.05  ev for the determination of the bulk born effective charges , and the linear tetrahedron method is used for the determination of the harmonic frequencies .",

    "for this purpose , a @xmath11-centered equidistant @xmath12 @xmath13-point grid , a plane - wave cutoff of 35  ry ( @xmath14 476  ev ) for the wave - functions ( 420  ry for the charge density ) , and an energy convergence of @xmath15  ry ensure sufficient accuracy .",

    "the @xmath13-point grid is reduced to @xmath18 .",

    "we have investigated the ferroelectric trends of the incipient ferroelectric material tio@xmath0 rutile by means of first - principles calculations .",
    "similar to the well - known ferroelectric perovskites , rutile possesses anomalously large dynamic charges , which is one key factor for the stabilization of a ferroelectric phase .",
    "we could show that this strong dynamic charge transfer is mainly mediated by @xmath25-type o - ti hybrid orbitals .",
    "furthermore , this dynamic charge transfer is considerably modified by changing the ratio of the equatorial and apical ti - o bond lengths .",
    "nevertheless , a large dynamic charge transfer along the [ 001 ] direction and along the apical ti - o bonds is preserved under small variations of the lattice as they may appear at strained surfaces . indeed , the born charges in both directions are quite stable at the ( 110 ) surface of rutile , even if one imposes an uniaxial tensile strain in the surface planes",
    ". only small oscillations of the dipolar interaction appear with the surface distance . here",
    ", the dipolar interaction along [ 001 ] is slightly enhanced within every second ti - o layer starting from the topmost layer , while the dipolar interaction along @xmath23 $ ] is slightly larger in the odd layers .",
    "although , the material possesses such a large dynamic charge transfer , no ferroelectric transition appears , as the short - range repulsion , which builds up during a polar displacement is too large for the undistorted material . in agreement with previous theoretical studies",
    ", we have shown that a ferroelectric transition of the bulk material can be enforced by lattice expansion or by uniaxial tensile strain . in both cases ,",
    "the enlarged ti - o distances reduce the short - range repulsion during a polar displacement .",
    "additionally , we could show that a ferroelectric state polarized along [ 001 ] can be stabilized by all modifications of the lattice which enlarge the nearest ti - o distance , even if the apical ti - o distance shrinks during the lattice modification . for uniaxial strain along [ 001 ] and [ @xmath26 $ ] stable ferroelectric states can be found and for both kinds of strain , the polar displacement along the strain direction is most favorable .",
    "most notably , the stabilization of two ferroelectric states , one polarized along [ 001 ] and one along [ @xmath26 $ ] can be transferred from the bulk material to the rutile ( 110 ) surface .",
    "we thus find large local dipole moments already for 2  % tensile strain in both [ 001 ] and [ @xmath27 direction .",
    "although the ferroelectric trends and the obtained local dipole moments may be slightly overestimated within our theoretical approach , we find a successive increase of the local dipole moments for increasing strain .",
    "therefore , we predict that a ferroelectric state can be stabilized for experimentally accessible tensile strains , and that the resulting electric dipoles persist even in the atomic layers at or immediately below the surface . on the other hand , for compressive strain",
    "no stabilization of a ferroelectric phase is possible at the rutile surface , in agreement with the corresponding bulk material .",
