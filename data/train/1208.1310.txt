    "pioneering papers by shur and eastman  @xcite have stimulated extensive studies ( which continue already for the fourth decade ) of ballistic electron and hole transport ( bet and bht , respectively ) , i.e. , collision free transport in short semiconductor structures .",
    "the main incentive is the realization of fastest velocities of electrons / holes and , hence , achievement of the operation of diodes and transistors in terahertz range ( thz ) of frequencies and low power consumption . even at the initial stage of the ballistic transport research",
    ", several concepts of ballistic thz sources have been put forward ( see , for instance , an early review  @xcite ) .",
    "however , the realization thz generation in different semiconductor devices associated with bet / bht , in particular , analogous to vacuum devices , meets the problems associated with electron scattering in real semiconductor structures .",
    "creation of heterostructures with selective doping with a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) spatially separated from the donors , has resulted in achievement of very long mean free path of electrons , at least at low temperatures .",
    "recent discoveries of unique properties of graphene  @xcite , in particular , the demonstration of possibility of very long electron and hole mean free path in graphene layers ( gls ) and what is even more interesting in multiple graphene layers ( mgls )  @xcite add optimism in building graphene based thz devices using bet .",
    "the concept of graphene tunneling transit - time ( gtunnett ) p - i - n diode , which exhibits a negative dynamic conductivity in the thz range , was proposed and substantiated in refs .",
    "this concept based not only on bet or quasi - bet ( as well as bht or quasi - bht ) in gls and mgls , but also on a strong interband tunneling under the electric field with a pronounced anisotropy  @xcite due to the gapless energy spectrum , and constant absolute value of electrons and holes velocities  @xcite . due to this , the electrons in the conduction band and the holes in the valence band generated owing to the interband tunneling in the electric field propogate primarily in the electric field direction with the velocity ( in this direction ) virtually equal to the characteristic velocity @xmath0  cm / s .",
    "a large value of the directed velocity in gls and mgls promotes the device operation at elevated frequencies .",
    "as shown  @xcite , for the self - excitation of thz oscillations in a circuit with gtunnett diode , this circuit should serve as a resonator .",
    "however , at elevated tunneling currents in gtunnetts considered previously  @xcite the self - consistent charge associated with propagating electron and hole streams can affect the spatial distribution of the self - consistent electric field and the electric potential in the i - section . as a result",
    ", the self - consistent electric field near the p - i- and i - n - juctions can be substantially reinforced .",
    "this , in turn , influences the tunneling generation of electrons and holes and the their transit conditions and , hence , the gtunnett dc and ac characteristics .    in this paper , in contrast to the previous treatment  @xcite , we account for the self - consistent electric field associated with the variations of the electron and hole lateral charges in the i - section and their effect on the injection and the dc and ac characteristics .",
    "the effects of the space charge in planar tunnetts with the propagation of carriers perpendicular to the structure plane were considered by gribnikov et al .",
    "the problems of calculation of the dc and ac characteristics of devices based on lateral structures accounting for the self - consistent electric field are substantially complicated by the features of the structure geometry ( 2d electron and hole channels and blade - like contact regions ) .",
    "in particular , as shown in the following , the related mathematical problems are reduced to a system of rather complex nonlinear integral - differential equations . using the gtunnett device model , we derive these equations ,",
    "solve them numerically , and find the characteristics .",
    "the device under consideration is based on a gl or mgl structures with p- and n- side sections with the contacts and an undoped transit i - section . for definiteness",
    ", we assume that p - and n - sections in a gl or in an mgl are created by chemical doping  @xcite , although in similar devices but with extra gates these sections can be formed electrically  @xcite . under the reverse bias voltage @xmath1 ,",
    "the potential drops primarily across the i - section a schematic view of the structures in question and their band - diagram under sufficiently strong reverse bias ( @xmath2 ) corresponding to the potential distribution in the i - section with a markedly nonuniform electric field are shown in fig .  1 .    the electrons and holes injected into the i - section of one gl are characterized by the electron and hole sheet concentrations , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively and the potential @xmath5 . here",
    "the axis @xmath6 is directed along the gl ( or mgl ) plane , i.e. , in the direction of the current , the axis @xmath7 is directed perpendicular to this plane , and @xmath8 is the time . in the general case when the i - section is based on mgl , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the electron and hole densities in each gls . in the case of bet and bht , on which we focus mainly ,",
    "the electron and hole sheet densities in each gl obey the continuity equations    @xmath9    and the poisson equation    @xmath10    respectively . here",
    "@xmath11 is the electron charge , @xmath12 is the dielectric constant of the media surrounding gl ( or mgl structure ) , @xmath13 is the number of gls in the gtunnett structure , and @xmath14 is the delta function reflecting a narrowiness of gl and mgl structures even with rather large number of gls in the @xmath15 direction . equation ( 1 ) corresponds to the situation when the electrons and holes generated due to the interband tunneling in the i - section obtain the directed velocities @xmath16 and @xmath17 and preserve them during the propagation .",
    "the boundary conditions correspond to the assumption that the electrons and holes appear in the i - section only due to the interband tunneling ( the injection of electrons from the p - section and holes from the n - section is negligible ) and that the highly conducting side contacts to the p- and n - sections are of blade type ( the thicknesses of gl and mgl and the contacts to them are much smaller than the spacing between the contacts ) :    @xmath18    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the length of the i - section and @xmath21 is the net voltage , which comprises the bias voltage @xmath1 and the signal component with the amplitude @xmath22 and the frequency @xmath23 .",

    "this is because at larger @xmath13 , the net tunneling generation rate becomes stronger .",

    "figure 3 demonstrates a difference in the dc current - voltage characteristics in gtunnetts with different numbers of gls @xmath13 .",
    "an increase in @xmath13 leads to an increase in the dc current not only because of the increase in the number of current channels but because of the reinforcement of the self - consistent electric field near the edges of the i - section(as mentioned above ) . as can be seen in fig .",

    "the minima of the admittance real part ( where the latter is negative ) become deeper and the minima shift toward smaller frequencies with increasing dielectric constant @xmath12 .",

    "the dashed line corresponds to the case when the role of these charges is diminished ( very large @xmath12 ) considered previously  @xcite .",
    "figure 8 shows the admittance real part vs signal frequency calculated for gtunnetts with different number of gls @xmath13 .",
    "one can see that gtunnetts with larger number of gls @xmath13 exhibit much more deep minima ( compare the curves which correspond to @xmath54 and @xmath74 in fig .  7 and that for @xmath88 and @xmath74 in fig .  8 . ) . as follows from this comparison ,",

    "calculating the dc current , we disregarded the contributions of the thermogeneration of electron - hole pairs in the i - section and the injection of minority carriers from the n- and p - sections .",

    "this implies that the ac resistance , @xmath104 of optimized gtunnetts with re  @xmath105  ms / mm ( @xmath88 , @xmath106 , and @xmath86  mv ) and the width @xmath107  mm , is @xmath108 . assuming that in this case @xmath109  a / mm at @xmath86  mv , the dc power , @xmath110 , generated by the propagating electrons and holes in the contact n- and p - regions of the device can be estimated as @xmath111  mw . when re  @xmath112  ms / mm ( @xmath54 and @xmath106 ) , the same resistance is provided if @xmath113  mm with the dc power @xmath114  mw .    the depth of the minimum of the real part of the gtunnett admittance can be increased by applying higher bias voltage .",
    "this is because the admittance is proportional to the dc differential conductivity which , in turn , is approximately proportional to @xmath115 .",
    "however , an increase in @xmath1 results in the pertinent rise of @xmath110 . if @xmath116 exceeds the the energy of optical phonons in gls @xmath117  mev , their fast emission disrupts bet and bht in the i - section .",
    "the emission of optical phonon leads to some isotropization of the angular distribution of the electron and hole velocities of electrons and holes .",
    "this results in some decrease in their mean directed velocities ( they become somewhat smaller than @xmath118 ) and , hence , in some increase in the electron and hole charges and the transit time .",
    "such factors promote more steep dc current - voltage characteristics and modify the frequency dependence of the admittance .",
    "although they should not change the gtunnett performance qualitatively .",
    "the depth of the first resonance minimum of the real part of the gtunnett admittance with the parameters used in the above estimate is of the same order of magnitude as that of the small area ( about @xmath119m@xmath120 ) thz resonant - tunneling diodes considered by asada et al .",
    "it is worth noting that the frequency at which i m  @xmath72 turns zero can fall into the frequency range , where re  @xmath73 .",
    "in such a case , gtunnetts can exhibit the self - excitation of thz oscillations even without the external resonant circuit .",
    "the contact n- and p - sections ( both ungated as in the case of their chemical doping or gated in the case of the electrical `` doping '' ) can serve as plasma resonant cavities  @xcite . the combination of the transi - time and the plasma resonances , can substantially liberalize the self - excitation conditions and enhance the thz emission efficiency .",
    "the matching of the transit - time and plasma resonant frequencies requires a proper choice of the length of the n- and p - sections ( from several micrometers in the ungated structures to about one micrometer in the gated ones .",
    "the plasmons and related resonances in the gated gls were predicted and analyzed several years ago  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "recently , the plasmons in gated gls were detected experimentally  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting , that as a gate for the gl plasmon cavity another gate can be used  @xcite when the contact regions constitute double - gl structures  @xcite .",
    "we have developed a self - consistent device model for p - i - n gtunnetts with different number of gls which enables the calculation of their realistic dc and ac characteristics .",
    "our calculations have shown that : + ( i ) the charges of electrons and holes propagating in the i - section and their effect on the spatial distribution of the self - consistent electric field increase the steepness of the dc current - voltage characteristics .",
    "this effect is stronger in gtunnetts with larger number of gls and can be weakened by using the media surrounding gl or mgl structure ( substrates and top dielectric layers ) with elevated values of the dielectric constant ; + ( ii ) the imaginary and real parts of the gtunnett admittance are oscillatory functions of the signal frequency due to the transit - time resonances . in the certain frequency ranges , which correspond to the thz frequencies , the admittance real part can be negative that enables the use of gtunnetts in the sources of thz radiation ; + ( iii ) the charges of electrons and holes influence on the spatial distribution of the self - consistent electric field and the interband tunneling and can substantially affect the gtunnett admittance , particularly , its frequency dependence near the transit - time resonances .",
