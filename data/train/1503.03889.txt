    "individual based models are of great relevance in many disciplines , ranging from condensed matter @xcite to biology @xcite , economics and social dynamics @xcite . they allow to simulate some simple dynamical rules and study its consequences at a global population scale . in an ecological context",
    "individual based models have gained in importance @xcite , and are commonly used to investigate collective behavior and the emergence of patterns , which are central issues in theoretical ecology @xcite .    in this paper , we propose a model to study the formation of spatial patterns in a population of organisms in which interactions affect their mobility .",
    "we assume that , during the time scales of interest here , no other dynamical processes such as birth , reproduction and death occur . the movement of any individual depends on the distribution of its conspecifics at two length scales .",
    "we thus focus on the problem of group formation and spatial aggregation @xcite , although this approach may be used in the more general context of collective movement @xcite ( including birds flocks @xcite , fish swarms @xcite , and mammals herds @xcite ) , and also to address the effect of spatial degrees of freedom in evolutionary problems @xcite .",
    "spatial aggregation is a widespread phenomenon in living systems , resulting from the combination of individual movement with interspecific and intraspecific interactions @xcite .",
    "therefore , a mathematical description of group formation should include all these mechanisms , and several ways of integrating collective interactions with individual movement have been proposed @xcite .",
    "a very important type of models considers that interactions influence only the movement of the individuals disregarding any other intra- and inter - specific interactions .",
    "they are relevant to study animal or organism dispersal wherever there is an increase of the diffusivity with the local density because of population pressure @xcite .",
    "extensions of these works also account for the effect of conspecifics located at separated positions @xcite , including nonlocal spatial interactions .",
    "this family of models results in nonlocal nonlinear diffusion equations @xcite for the population density . from a biological point of view",
    ", they usually account for a single class of interactions , and diffusivity depends on the population density over one neighborhood of the focal individual .",
    "however , in a more general framework , many different interactions of diverse nature are relevant within a population , so these single - scale approaches might not describe the complete set of processes taking place .",
    "for instance , high long - range densities ( i.e. densities of others within a long distance around a focal one ) may encourage animal mobility due to intraspecific competition for resources , while on a shorter spatial scale individuals may arrange in cooperative aggregations so that the predation risk decreases .",
    "also in the decision - making process that underlies collective movement , animals choose how to move depending on their neighbors at different distances , so they guarantee the cohesion of the group @xcite . in a rather different context",
    ", the formation of patterns of vegetation has been also traditionally thought to be a consequence of the interplay between plant interactions at two different scales : short - range facilitation and long - range competition @xcite , although this has been a contentious claim @xcite ) .",
    "mussel beds are one of the paradigmatic examples of spatial aggregation in nature .",
    "experimental works have shown that the origin of the aggregates lies in the interaction among individuals @xcite , although modified by the interplay between the whole population and the environment @xcite .",
    "many theoretical attempts have proposed mathematical models to unveil the mechanisms that , acting at different spatial scales , stabilize the patterns .",
    "two families of models have arisen , both of them containing competition for resources on a large scale and facilitation ( aggregation promotion to diminish wave stress and predation risk ) on a short scale : a ) studies considering the dynamics of two populations ( the algae and the mussels ) @xcite ; and b ) , an study that focuses only on the dynamics of the population of mussels ( unique species model ) , including the interaction with the environment ( i.e , algae ) in nonlocal spatial terms @xcite .    within this framework , but mainly motivated by @xcite , we present a model of interacting particles where the mobility of the individuals , i.e. its diffusivity , depends on two spatial scales .",
    "movement is encouraged when the density is high in a long - range ( competition ) , and inhibited if it is so in a short - range ( i.e. , cooperative aggregations are favored at shorter scales ) .",
    "the principal novelty of our work with respect to @xcite is the brownian nature of the motion of the particles in the discrete description of the system and its generality , that allows the exploration of different relationships between the diffusivity and the density of individuals .",
    "we will perform a numerical study of this stochastic picture and compare the results with the equivalent deterministic population level approach .    in the following sections pattern formation",
    "will be studied combining numerical and analytical techniques both in the discrete - particle dynamics and its continuous - field density equation .",
    "let us consider a population of @xmath0 individuals undergoing brownian movement with a diffusion coefficient that depends on the densities of conspecifics at two separated length - scales : a mean density @xmath1 at short range , @xmath2 , and a mean density @xmath3 over a long one , @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "we will denote the position of each particle by @xmath6 at any time @xmath7 in a two - dimensional square system of lateral extent @xmath8 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the dynamics of each particle @xmath9 is then given by @xmath10 where the diffusivity @xmath11 is , in general , a positive continuous function of @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath14 is a white gaussian vector noise with zero mean and with time - correlation matrix given by @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath16 is the identity matrix .",
    "( [ langevin ] ) should be interpreted within the it calculus , since the stop / movement behavior is assumed to occur at the beginning of each time step @xcite .",

    "the main focus of this approach is on species that switch between the tendency to aggregation and to dispersion as the number of surrounding individuals increases at different length scales . in particular , we address the case of competitive long range interactions and facilitation at a shorter scale .",
    "this is the observed framework in mussel beds , where patterns appear due to the interaction between two opposing mechanisms : competition for resources at a large scale and defense against predators and waves stress at shorter distance @xcite    to model this behavior we consider that the diffusivity , @xmath11 , is enhanced with increasing the long - range density , and reduced with increasing short - range density .",

    "we have studied how the combination of a short - range inhibition and a long - range activation in individual dispersal may influence the long - time spatial distribution of a population , which ranges from homogeneous to labyrinth and spot patterns depending on the relative weights of each mechanism .",
    "this type of behavior has been observed in mussel beds @xcite where individuals tend to clump at short distance as a defensive strategy while competition for resources acts at a larger scale .",
    "pattern formation arises as a consequence of the interplay between inhibition and activation acting at different spatial scales that makes the spatially homogeneous state to lose its stability .",
    "resulting patterns show not only an inhomogeneous distribution of the population at a system level but also a non - uniform distribution of the individuals within each cluster . for the time",
    "scales discussed here ring - like structures are formed , with most of the particles at the borders of the groups .",
    "this point has been studied from a simplified 1d situation starting from an initial density given by a step function . beyond the limits of the profile",
    "the nonlocal long - range densty is higher than the nonlocal short - range density .",
    "however , due to their different slopes , this situation is reversed and the short - range density becomes higher than the long - range one .",
    "this leads to the formation of annular structures .",
    "this mechanism will act for any kind of initial condition wherever there is a region where eventually the density is higher than in the rest of the system .",
    "whether the rings will homogenize at very long times or rather they will remain stable depends on the details of the small - diffusion part of the density - dependent diffusivity .    the particular shape of the structures depends on the relative importance of the short and long - range mean densities , weighted by the values of the parameters @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the first is the responsible of the formation of aggregates , so the model gives homogeneous distributions when this scale tends to zero ( @xmath113 or equivalently @xmath83 ) .",
    "the larger one enhances the formation of groups .",
    "individuals that do not belong to any group are surrounded by low densities in their close neighborhoods , but still can be in very far - populated regions . in these cases",
    "their movement has a larger diffusivity , so longer displacements are possible , increasing the probability of finding a group in a shorter time . a combination of both",
    ", a short- and a long - range dependence mobility , is an optimal mechanism to promote the formation of groups .",
    "in addition , the long - range competition stabilizes the ring - like structures since it avoids the formation of highly packed groups in a small area .",
    "the generality of the model , a nonlinear diffusion equation with two nonlocal interaction scales that enhance and inhibit animal mobility , allows its application to a wide variety of ecological situations with these two ingredients .",
    "moreover , our mathematical scheme shows a sequence of patterns that has been previously reported in natural systems such as mussel beds @xcite ( isolated spots spatially arranged at random can also be observed for slightly different setups of the model , for example , changing the hyperbolic tangent function in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gfunction ] ) ) . in the case of mussels ,",
    "long - range activation of dispersal arises from resources competition .",
    "individuals would tend to escape from regions already colonized by other groups .",
    "nevertheless they will remain inside a small group if at this smaller scales clustering provides some advantage such as protection against wave stress .",
    "protection against predators is also a widespread benefit of clustering in groups . within our approach ,",
    "we recover spatial structures both in a stochastic and a deterministic description of the problem , suggesting that they are a result of the interplay between the two types of interactions with fluctuations playing a secondary role . remarkably , our results bear similarities with results on vegetation patterns and fairy circles in arid regions @xcite which arise from very different mechanisms , but have in common with our case the presence of competitive and facilitative interactions .",
