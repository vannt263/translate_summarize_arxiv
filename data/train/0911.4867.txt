    ", the authors considered the holographic superconductors in the abelian - higgs model within the probe limit , which means the backreaction of the dynamical matter field on the spacetime metric is negligible .",
    "the probe limit is justified when the charge of the complex scalar field is large . for the einstein - abelian - higgs system ,",
    "one has a consistent solution : a schwarzschild - ads black hole solution with a constant scalar field .",
    "when the black hole temperature @xmath2 decreases and is below a critical temperature @xmath3 , it is found that the schwarzschild - ads black hole becomes unstable , and a new black hole solution with charged scalar hair is favored .",
    "it implies that a second order phase transition happens from the schwarzschild - ads black hole to the hairy black hole . in the field theory side",

    "according to the ads / cft correspondence , the maxwell field in the bulk is dual to a @xmath4 conserved current in the boundary field theory .",
    "therefore , considering the fluctuation of the maxwell field , one is able to calculate the conductivity .",
    "the authors of @xcite found that the behaviors of the condensation and the conductivity are qualitatively consistent with the bcs theory  @xcite .",
    "the backreaction effect of matter field has been studied in  @xcite , the phase diagram and conductivity are also still consistent with the bcs theory , as expected .",

    "more recently , the investigation of the ground state ( zero - temperature limit ) of holographic superconductors has revealed that there may exist some lifshitz scaling symmetry for the bulk solutions and bulk solutions have vanishing entropy  @xcite .",

    "more recently a lot of attention has been focused on theory  @xcite , which is a power accounting renormalizable gravity theory . in particular , the theory is a non - relativistic theory .",

    "it is therefore of interest to study the holographic superconductivity in the theory , partially in order to see how the phenomenon of the charged condensation is robust , and partially to see what difference will appear , compared to the case of the relativistic general relativity .",

    "[ sect : rud ] we briefly introduce the gravity including its action , planar black hole solution and associated thermodynamics .",
