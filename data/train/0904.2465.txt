    "the detrended fluctuation analysis@xcite ( dfa ) is a novel method that has been developed to address the problem of accurately quantifying long range correlations in non - stationary fluctuating signals .",
    "it has been already applied to a multitude of cases including dna@xcite , human motor activity@xcite and gait@xcite , cardiac dynamics@xcite , meteorology@xcite , climate temperature fluctuations@xcite .",
    "traditional methods such as power spectrum and autocorrelation analysis@xcite are not suitable for non - stationary signals@xcite .",
    "dfa is , in short , a modified root - mean - square ( rms ) analysis of a random walk and consists of the following steps : starting with a signal @xmath2 , where @xmath3 , and @xmath4 is the length of the signal , the first step is to integrate @xmath2 and obtain @xmath5\\ ] ] where @xmath6 stands for the mean @xmath7 we then divide the profile @xmath8 into boxes of equal length @xmath9 . in each box , we fit @xmath8 using a polynomial function @xmath10 which represents the local trend in that box . ( if a different order @xmath11 of polynomial fit is used , we have a different order dfa-@xmath11 , for example dfa-1 if @xmath11=1 , dfa-2 if @xmath11=2 , etc . )",
    "next , the profile @xmath8 is detrended by substracting the local trend @xmath10 in each box of length @xmath9 : @xmath12 finally , the rms fluctuation for the integrated and detrended signal is calculated @xmath13 ^ 2}.\\ ] ] the behavior of @xmath14 over a broad number of scales is obtained by repeating the aforementioned calculation of @xmath14 for varied box length @xmath9 . for scale",
    "invariant signals , we find : @xmath15 where @xmath0 is the scaling exponent .",
    "if @xmath16 , the signal is uncorrelated ( white noise ) , while if @xmath17 the signal is correlated .    by employing the dfa method it was found@xcite that long - range correlations exist in the original time - series of the so called seismic electric signals ( ses ) activities .",
    "these are low frequency ( @xmath18hz ) electric signals preceding earthquakes@xcite , the generation of which could be understood in the following context .",
    "a change of pressure affects the thermodynamic parameters for the formation , migration or activation , in general , of defects in solids@xcite . in an ionic solid doped with aliovalent impurities",
    "a number of extrinsic defects is produced,@xcite due to charge compensation , a portion of which is attracted by nearby aliovalent impurities , thus forming electric dipoles that can change their orientation in space through a defect motion@xcite .",
    "hence , pressure variations may affect the thermodynamic parameters of this motion , thus resulting in a decrease or increase@xcite of the relaxation time of these dipoles , i.e. , their ( re)orientation is taking place faster or slower when an external electric field is applied . when the pressure , or the stress in general , reaches a",
    "_ critical _",
    "value@xcite a _ cooperative _ orientation of these electric dipoles occurs , which results in the emission of a transient electric signal .",
    "this may happen in the focal region of a ( future ) earthquake since it is generally accepted that the stress gradually changes there _ before _ rupture .",
    "it has been shown@xcite that ses activities are better distinguished from electric signals emitted from man - made sources , if dfa is applied to a signal after it has been analyzed in a newly introduced time domain , termed natural time @xmath19 . in a time series comprising @xmath4 events",
    ", the natural time @xmath20 serves as an index@xcite for the occurrence of the @xmath21-th event .",
    "the evolution of the pair ( @xmath22 ) is studied@xcite , where @xmath23 denotes a quantity proportional to the _ energy _ released in the @xmath21-th event . for dichotomous signals , which is frequently the case of ses activities , the quantity @xmath23 stands for the duration of the @xmath21-th pulse .",
    "the normalized power spectrum @xmath24 was introduced , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 , @xmath27 ; @xmath28 stands for the _",
    "natural frequency_. in natural time analysis , the properties of @xmath29 or @xmath30 are studied for natural frequencies @xmath28 less than 0.5 , since in this range of @xmath28 , @xmath29 or @xmath30 reduces to a _",
    "characteristic function _ for the probability distribution @xmath31 in the context of probability theory .",
    "when the system enters the _ critical _ stage , the following relation holds@xcite : @xmath32 for @xmath33 , eq.([fasma ] ) leads to@xcite @xmath34 which reflects@xcite that the variance of @xmath19 is given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 .",
    "the entropy @xmath37 in the natural time - domain is defined as@xcite @xmath38 which depends on the sequential order of events@xcite .",
    "it exhibits@xcite concavity , positivity , lesche@xcite stability , and for ses activities ( critical dynamics ) its value is smaller@xcite than the value @xmath39 ) of a `` uniform '' ( u ) distribution ( as defined in refs .",
    "@xcite , e.g. when all @xmath31 are equal or @xmath23 are positive independent and identically distributed random variables of finite variance . in this case ,",
    "@xmath40 and @xmath37 are designated @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively . ) .",
    "thus , @xmath43 . the same holds for the value of the entropy obtained@xcite upon considering the time reversal @xmath44 , i.e. , @xmath45 , which is labelled by @xmath46 . in summary , the ses activities , in contrast to the signals produced by man - made electrical sources , when analyzed in natural time exhibit _ infinitely _ ranged temporal correlations@xcite and obey the conditions@xcite : @xmath47 and @xmath48    for major earthquakes , i.e. , with magnitude mw6.5 or larger , ses activities are accompanied@xcite by detectable variations of the magnetic field * b*@xcite .",
    "these variations , which are usually measured by coil magnetometers ( see below ) , have the form of ` spikes ' of alternating sign .",
    "it is therefore of interest to investigate whether these ` spikes ' exhibit long range temporal correlations .",
    "this investigation , which is of major importance since only magnetic field data are usually available in most countries@xcite ( since it is easier to conduct magnetic field measurements than electric field ones ) , is made here in section ii .    in the up to date applications of dfa",
    ", long - range correlations have been revealed in ses activities of duration up to a few hours@xcite . during the last few years",
    ", however , experimental results related to some ses activities of appreciably longer duration , i.e. , from several hours to a couple of days , have been collected .",
    "these data now enable the investigation of scaling in a wider range of scales than hitherto known .",
    "this provides an additional scope of the present paper and is carried out in section iii .",
    "a discussion of the results concerning the magnetic and electric data follows in section iv .",
    "finally , our conclusions are presented in section v.",
    "the measurements have been carried out by three dansk coil magnetometers ( dmm ) oriented along the three axes : ew , ns and vertical .",
    "details on the calibration of these magnetometers can be found in the supplementary information of ref.@xcite . in particular , this calibration showed that for periods larger than around half a second , the magnetometers measure@xcite the time derivative @xmath49 of the magnetic field and their output is ` neutralized ' approximately 200ms after the ` arrival ' of a heaviside unit step magnetic variation .",
    "it alternatively means that a signal recorded by these magnetometers should correspond to a magnetic variation that has ` arrived ' at the sensor less than 200ms before the recording .",
    "the data were collected by a campbell 21x datalogger with sampling frequency @xmath50sample / s .",
    "figure [ fig1m](a ) provides an example of simultaneous recordings on april 18 , 1995 at a station located close to ioannina ( ioa ) city in northwestern greece .",
    "variations of both the electric ( e ) and magnetic field are shown .",
    "they were followed by a magnitude mw6.6 earthquake ( according to the centroid moment tensor solutions reported by the united states geological survey ) with an epicenter at 40.2@xmath51n21.7@xmath51e that occurred almost three weeks later , i.e. , on may 13 , 1995 .",
    "the recordings of the two horizontal magnetometers oriented along the ew- and ns - directions labelled @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively , are shown in the lower two channels .",
    "they consist of a series of ` spikes ' of alternating sign as it becomes evident in a 10min excerpt of these recordings depicted in fig.[fig1m](b ) .",
    "these ` spikes ' are superimposed on a background which exhibits almost pseudo - sinusoidal variations of duration much larger than 1s that are induced by frequent small variations of the earth s magnetic field termed magnetotelluric variations ( mt ) .",
    "in addition , the horizontal @xmath54variations were monitored at the same station by measuring the variation @xmath55 of the potential difference between ( pairs of ) electrodes -measuring dipoles- that are grounded at depths of @xmath56 m .",
    "several such dipoles were deployed along the ew- and ns - directions with lengths ( l ) a few to several tens of meters ( short - dipoles ) or a couple of km ( long - dipoles ) ( thus the electric field is given by @xmath57 and is usually measured in mv / km ) .",
    "for example , the following measuring dipoles are shown in the upper three channels of fig.[fig1m](a ) : two short electric dipoles at site ` c ' of ioa station ( see the supplementary information of ref.@xcite as well as ref.@xcite where the selection of site ` c ' has been discussed ) of length 50 m ( labelled e@xmath58-w@xmath58 and n@xmath58-s@xmath58 , respectively ) while the uppermost channel corresponds to a long dipole ( labelled l@xmath59-i ) with length @xmath60 km at an almost ns - direction . as it becomes obvious in fig.[fig1m](b ) , the @xmath61 variations consist of a series of almost rectangular pulses ( cf . the initiation and cessation of each rectangular pulse correspond to two ` spikes ' with opposite sign in the @xmath62 recordings ) .",
    "we now apply dfa to the original time - series of the magnetic field variations and focus our attention on the @xmath52 component where the intensity of ` spikes ' is higher . dividing the time series of length @xmath4 into @xmath63 non - overlapping fragments ,",
    "each of @xmath9 observations , and determining the local trend of the sub - series we find the corresponding @xmath64 versus @xmath65 plot where @xmath66 shown in fig.[fig1mdfa ] .",
    "if we fit the data with two straight lines ( which are also depicted in fig.[fig1mdfa ] ) , the corresponding scaling exponents are @xmath67 and @xmath68 for the short- and long- time lags ( i.e. , smaller than around 12s and larger than @xmath69s ) , respectively .",
    "the crossover occurs at a value ( @xmath70s ) which is roughly equal to the average duration @xmath71s of each electric pulse , corresponding to the interval between two consecutive alternating ` spikes ' .",
    "thus , fig.[fig1mdfa ] shows that at time - lags @xmath72 larger than @xmath73 long - range power law correlations prevail ( since @xmath17 ) , while at shorter time - lags the @xmath0 value is very close to that ( @xmath16 ) of an uncorrelated signal ( white noise ) .",
    "the above findings are strikingly reminiscent of the case of signals with superposed _",
    "random _ spikes studied by chen et al.@xcite .",
    "they reported that for a correlated signal with spikes , they found a crossover from uncorrelated behavior at small scales to correlated behavior at large scales with an exponent close to the exponent of the original stationary signal .",
    "they also investigated the characteristics of the scaling of the spikes only and found that the scaling behavior of the signal with _",
    "random _ spikes is a superposition of the scaling of the signal and the scaling of the spikes .",
    "the case studied by chen et al.@xcite , however , is different from the present case , because the ` spikes ' studied here correspond to the pre - seismic magnetic field variations and hence are _ not _ random ( cf . recall that when applying dfa to the ` durations ' of the electric field rectangular pulses shown in fig.[fig1m](b ) , we found@xcite an exponent around unity ) .",
    "in fig.[fig1 ] the following four long duration ses activities are depicted _ all _ of which have been recorded with sampling frequency @xmath50sample / s at a station close to pirgos ( pir ) city located in western greece ( in this station only electric field variations are continuously monitored with a multitude of measuring dipoles the deployment of which has been described in detail in the supplementary information of ref.@xcite ) .",
    "first , the ses activity on september 17 , 2005 with duration of several hours that preceded the mw6.7 earthquake with an epicenter at 36.3@xmath51n23.3@xmath51e on january 8 , 2006 .",
    "second , the ses activity that lasted from january 21 until january 26 , 2008 and preceded the mw6.9 earthquake at 36.5@xmath51n21.8@xmath51e on february 14 , 2008 .",
    "third , the ses activity during the period from february 29 to march 2 , 2008 that was followed@xcite by a mw6.4 earthquake at 38.0@xmath51n21.5@xmath51e on june 8 , 2008 ( ses activity information is issued _ only _ when the expected magnitude is around 6 units or larger@xcite ) . finally , fig.[fig1](d ) depicts the most recent ses activity of duration of several hours that was recorded on december 12 , 2008 .",
    "the latter ses activity was followed by a mw5.4 earthquake at 37.1@xmath51n20.8@xmath51e on february 16 , 2009 ( according to athens observatory the magnitude is ms(ath)=ml+0.5=6.0 ; we clarify that predictions are issued _ only _ when the expected magnitude is comparable to 6.0 units or larger ) . note that this earthquake occurred after the initial submission of the present paper ( and its time of occurrence was approached@xcite by means of the procedure developed in ref.@xcite ) .    here ,",
    "we analyze , as an example , the long duration ses activity that lasted from february 29 until march 2 , 2008(fig.[fig1](c ) ) .",
    "the time - series of this electrical disturbance , which is not of obvious dichotomous nature , is depicted in the upper channel ( labelled `` a '' ) of fig.[figfeb ] .",
    "the signal , comprising a number of pulses , is superimposed on a background which exhibits frequent small mt variations .",
    "the latter are simultaneously recorded at _ all _ measuring sites , in contrast to the ses activities that solely appear at a restricted number of sites depending on the epicentral region of the future earthquake@xcite .",
    "this difference provides a key for their distinction . in order to separate the background",
    ", we proceed into the following steps : first , we make use of another measuring dipole of the same station , i.e. , the channel labelled `` b '' in fig.[figfeb ] , which has not recorded the signal but does show the mt pseudo - sinusoidal variations .",
    "second , since the sampling rate of the measurements is 1sample / s , we now compute the increments every 1s of the two time - series of channels `` a '' and `` b '' . assuming the `` 1s increments '' of channel `` a '' lying along the x - axis and those of `` b '' along the y - axis , we plot in the middle panel of fig.[figfeb ] ( labeled `` c '' ) the angle of the resulting vector with dots .",
    "when a non - mt variation ( e.g. , a dichotomous pulse ) appears ( disappears ) in channel `` a '' , this angle in `` c '' abruptly changes to 0@xmath51 ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "thus , the dots in panel `` c '' mark such changes . in other words , an increased density of dots ( dark regions ) around 0@xmath51 or @xmath75 marks the occurrence of these pulses , on which we should focus . to this end , we plot in channel `` d '' of fig.[figfeb ] the residual of a linear least squares fit of channel `` a '' with respect to channel `` b '' . comparing channel `` d '' with channel `` a '' , we notice a significant reduction of the mt background but not of the signal .",
    "the small variations of the mt background that still remain in `` d '' , are now marked by the light blue line , which when removed result in channel `` e '' of fig.[figfeb ] .",
    "hence , channel `` e '' solely contains the electric field variations that precede rupture .",
    "this channel provides the time - series which should now be analyzed .",
    "the dfa analysis ( in conventional time ) of the time - series of channel `` e '' of fig.[figfeb ] is shown in fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "it reveals an almost linear @xmath76 vs @xmath77 plot ( where @xmath78 ) with an exponent @xmath1 practically _ over all scales available _ ( approximately five orders of magnitude ) .",
    "note , that this value of the exponent remains the same irrespective if we apply dfa-1 , dfa-2 or dfa-3 .",
    "this result is in agreement with the results obtained@xcite for ses activities of _ shorter _ duration .    for the classification of this signal ,",
    "i.e. , to distinguish whether it is a true ses activity or a man - made electric signal , we now proceed to its analysis in natural time . in order to define ( @xmath22 )",
    "the individual pulses of the signal depicted in channel `` e '' of fig.[figfeb ] have to be identified .",
    "a pulse starts , of course , when the amplitude exceeds a given threshold and ends when the amplitude falls below it .",
    "moreover , since the signal is not obviously dichotomous , instead of finding the duration of each pulse , one should sum the `` instantaneous power '' during the pulse duration in order to find @xmath23 , as already mentioned . to this end , we plot in fig.[febhis ] the histogram of the instantaneous power p of channel `` e '' of fig.[figfeb ] , computed by squaring its amplitude .",
    "an inspection of this figure reveals a bimodal feature which signifies the periods of inactivity ( p@xmath79v@xmath80hz ) and activity ( p@xmath81v@xmath80hz ) in channel `` e '' of fig.[figfeb ] . in order to find @xmath23 , we focus on the periods of activity and select the power threshold p@xmath82 around the second peak of the histogram in fig.[febhis ] .",
    "let us consider , for example , the case of p@xmath82=1400 @xmath83v@xmath80hz . in fig.[febexa](a ) , we depict the instantaneous power p of the signal in channel `` e '' of fig.[figfeb ] .",
    "starting from the beginning of the signal , we compare p with p@xmath82 and when p exceeds p@xmath82 we start summing up the p values until p falls below p@xmath82 for the first time , @xmath84 .",
    "the resulting sum corresponds to @xmath85 .",
    "this procedure is repeated until p falls below p@xmath82 for the second time , @xmath86 , and the new sum represents @xmath87 , etc .",
    "this leads to the natural time representation depicted in fig.[febexa](b ) .",
    "the result depends , of course , on the proper selection of p@xmath82 .",
    "the latter can be verified by checking whether a small change of p@xmath82 around the second peak of the histogram , leads to a natural time representation resulting in approximately the same values of the parameters @xmath88 and @xmath46 . by randomly selecting p@xmath82 in the range 500 to 2000",
    "@xmath83v@xmath80hz , we obtain that the number of pulses in channel `` e '' of fig.[figfeb ] is @xmath89 with @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "when p@xmath82 ranges between 1000 to 1500 @xmath83v@xmath80hz , the corresponding values are @xmath93 with @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "thus , we observe that irrespective of the p@xmath82 value chosen , the parameters @xmath88 and @xmath46 obey the conditions ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) for the classification of this signal as ses activity .",
    "the same holds for a non - dichotomous signal recorded on march 28 , 2009 at keratea station located close to athens ( fig.[fig8 ] ) .",
    "to approach the occurrence time of the impending event , the procedure developed in ref.@xcite has been employed for the seismicity within the area n@xmath97e@xmath98 .",
    "the results , when considering the seismicity until early in the morning on june 19 , 2009 , are shown in fig.[fig9 ] .",
    "they show that a local maximum of the probability@xcite prob(@xmath40 ) of the seismicity is observed at @xmath99 upon the occurrence of the following events : ( a ) an m@xmath100=3.2 event at 12:42 ut on june 18 with epicenter at 38.7n 23.0e and an m@xmath100=3.2 event at 03:44 ut on june 19 at 37.9n 23.0e if we take a magnitude threshold m@xmath82=3.0 ( b ) when taking m@xmath82=3.1 , the maximum occurs again upon the occurrence of the aforementioned event at 12:42 on june 18 ( c ) when increasing the threshold at m@xmath82=3.2 , the maximum occurs somewhat earlier , i.e. , upon the occurrence of the m@xmath100=3.5 event at 08:26 ut on june 18 at 38.7n 23.0e .",
    "let us now consider a larger area , i.e. , n@xmath101e@xmath102 , and repeat the same calculation .",
    "the results are shown in fig.[fig10 ] .",
    "they reveal again the occurrence of a local maximum of prob(@xmath40 ) at @xmath99 upon the occurrence of the above mentioned m@xmath100=3.2 event at 12:42 ut on june 18 when considering either m@xmath82=3.2 ( fig.[fig10](c ) ) or m@xmath82=3.1 ( fig.[fig10](b ) ) ( for the latter case a maximum also occurs at the last event shown in the figure with m@xmath100=3.2 at 03:44 ut on june 19 ) .",
    "the maximum appears upon the occurrence of a m@xmath100=3.0 at 23:48 ut on june 18 when decreasing the threshold at m@xmath82=3.0 .    in summary ,",
    "the results exhibit both magnitude- and spatial- invariance , which is characteristic when approaching the critical point .",
    "_ note added on july 21 , 2009 . _ repeating the aforementioned calculation for the area n@xmath101e@xmath102 , we find the results depicted in fig.[fig11](a ) for m@xmath82=2.8 .",

    "_ note added on november 27 , 2009 . _ actually , after the previous note the following two earthquakes occurred at 18:30 ut on november 16 , 2009 and at 04:29 ut on november 19 , 2009 with magnitudes ( m@xmath59(ath ) ) 4.3 and 4.4 and epicenters at @xmath108n @xmath109e and @xmath110n @xmath111e , respectively , that both lie within the pat selectivity map , i.e , n@xmath104e@xmath112 .",
    "the continuation of the two studies mentioned in the previous note , i.e. , in the pat selectivity map as well as in the area n@xmath101e@xmath113 , both show that the _ most prominent _ maximum of prob(@xmath40 ) at @xmath99 was observed upon the occurrence of the m@xmath100=3.2 event at 19:31 ut on november 25 , 2009 , thus indicating that the system is near the critical point .    _ note added on february 9 , 2010 . _ two earthquakes with magnitudes m@xmath59(ath)(@xmath114)=5.7 and 5.6 occurred at @xmath108n @xmath109e ( and hence inside the expected area ) at 15:56 ut on january 18 and at 00:46 ut on january 22 , 2010 ( after observing a maximum of prob(@xmath40 ) versus @xmath40 at @xmath40=0.070 for @xmath103=3.1 upon the occurrence of the @xmath115=3.2 event at 15:56 ut on january 15 , 2010 ) .",
    "these two magnitudes are consistent with the condition m@xmath59(ath)@xmath1166.0 ( under which ses information are publicized ) if a reasonable@xcite experimental error 3@xmath117=0.7 is accepted",
    ".    however , since the amplitudes of all the ses activities recorded could warrant an impending mainshock with magnitude exceeding m@xmath59(ath)=6.0 , and in order to determine the occurrence time of such a mainshock , if any , the natural time analysis of seismicity still continues .",
    "this analysis starting at 04:00 ut on december 27 , 2009 , revealed that in the area n@xmath118e@xmath119 ( almost 200 km @xmath120 100 km ) the criticality condition ( i.e. , prob(@xmath40 ) versus @xmath40 maximizes at @xmath40=0.070 ) for @xmath103=3.5 is obeyed during the last three events of fig.[fig17 ] , the latest of which ( that exhibits the strongest maximum ) occurred at 10:18 ut on february 7 , 2010 at @xmath121n @xmath122e with @xmath115=4.3 .",
    "this has been checked to be valid for broader areas as well ( spatial invariance ) , but has not yet been found to be confirmed ( until early in the morning on february 8 , 2010 ) for lower magnitude thresholds .",
    "the investigation of the latter is still in progress , because the following might happen : due to coarse - graining the criticality condition might have been obeyed at a larger time - window for large magnitude thresholds , while for smaller thresholds the time - window may become smaller thus achieving a better accuracy in the determination of the occurrence time of the impending earthquake .",
    "in general , electric field variations are interconnected with the magnetic field ones through maxwell equations .",
    "thus , it is intuitively expected that when the former exhibit long range correlations the same should hold for the latter .",
    "this expectation is consistent with the present findings which show that , at long time - lags , the original time - series of both electric- and magnetic field variations preceding rupture exhibit dfa - exponents close to unity .",
    "the above can be verified when data of both electric- and magnetic - field variations are simultaneously available .",
    "this was the case of the data presented in fig.[fig1 m ] .",
    "in several occasions , however , as mentioned in section i , only magnetic field data exist , in view of the fact that it is easier to conduct magnetic field measurements compared to the electric field ones . when using coil magnetometers , the magnetic field variations have the form of series of ` spikes ' . whenever the amplitude of these ` spikes ' significantly exceed the pseudo - sinusoidal variations of the mt background , as in the case of b@xmath123 in fig.[fig1 m ] , a direct application of dfa ( see fig.[fig1mdfa ] )",
    "elucidates the long range correlations in the magnetic field variations preceding rupture . on the other hand , when considerable pseudo - sinusoidal mt variations are superimposed ,",
    "a direct application of dfa is not advisable .",
    "one must first subtract the mt variations ( following a procedure similar to that used in the electric field data in fig.[figfeb ] ) and then apply dfa .",
    "the preceding paragraph refers to the analysis of the signal in conventional time . as already shown in ref.@xcite , natural time analysis ,",
    "has the privilege that allows the distinction between true ses activities and man made signals .",
    "this type of analysis , however , demands the knowledge of the energy released during each consecutive event .",
    "the determination of this energy is easier to conduct in the case of electric field variations ( this is so , because coil magnetometers , as mentioned in section ii , act as db / dt detectors ) .",
    "when these variations are of clear dichotomous nature , the energy release is proportional to the duration of each pulse@xcite . on the other hand , in absence of an obvious dichotomous nature an analysis of the ` instantaneous power ' similar to that presented in the last paragraph of section iii should be carried out to determine the parameters @xmath40 , s and s@xmath124 in natural time .",
    "first , dfa was used as a scaling analysis method to investigate long - range correlations in the original time series of the magnetic field variations that precede rupture and have the form of ` spikes ' of alternating sign .",
    "we find a scaling exponent @xmath0 close to 0.9 for time - lags larger than the average time interval @xmath73 between consecutive ` spikes ' , while at shorter time - lags the exponent is close to 0.5 thus corresponding to uncorrelated behavior .",
    "second , using electric field data of long duration ses activities ( i.e. , from several hours to a couple of days ) recorded during the last few years , dfa reveals a scale invariant feature with an exponent @xmath1 , over _ all _ scales available ( approximately five orders of magnitude ) .",
