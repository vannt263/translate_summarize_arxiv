    "simulations of major gas - rich disk galaxy mergers have provided quantitative insights to gas inflows and central starbursts under idealized conditions ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "these simulations have laid the foundation of the theoretical framework for almost all contemporary mainstream interpretations of observed extreme starbursting galaxies , namely , the ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) , as well as of the formation of supermassive black holes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this framework is appealing , because almost all observed ulirgs in the local universe either are directly seen merging or apparently show signs of mergers ( at least some significant interactions ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "what is known but not sufficiently stressed in the relevant context is that the local universe is very different from the younger one at @xmath2 when star formation was much more intensive . as an example , a typical lyman break galaxy ( lbg ) several times less massive than our own galaxy has a star - formation rate ( sfr )",
    "that is about ten times that of the galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , minor mergers and close interactions between galaxies are expected to be much more frequent at high redshift that , cumulatively , may have important effects . furthermore , there are significant structural differences between local galaxies and those at high redshift in that high redshift galaxies are more compact in size and the majority of massive quiescent galaxies that have been measured appear to have dense bulges ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . therefore , our current physical interpretation of extreme galaxy events that is obtained based on linking local observations with substantially idealized major galaxy merger simulations may not pertain to the high redshift universe in general .    in this work",
    "we examine theoretically , in a cosmological setting , the role of major mergers in driving star formation in the redshift range @xmath2 , utilizing a large - scale high - resolution galaxy formation simulation . at each redshift from @xmath8 to @xmath9 the simulation contains @xmath10 galaxies with stellar mass greater than @xmath1 resolved at better than @xmath0pc .",
    "detailed merger histories of galaxies are tracked and ( binary ) major mergers , defined to be those of stellar mass ratios greater than @xmath11 , are examined in comparison to those that do not experience major mergers .",
    "we find that for galaxies with sfr in the range @xmath12/yr and the stellar mass range @xmath13 examined , major mergers , on average , yield a modest , fractional boost of @xmath14 in specific sfr ; we do not find two orders of magnitude increase in sfr found in previous merger simulations of disk galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we show that the properties of simulated galaxies are in reasonable agreement with observations and give a physical explanation of the results .",
    "additional predictions are provided to further test the model .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in ",
    "2 we detail our simulation (  2.1 ) and galaxy catalogs (  2.2 ) .",
    "results are presented in  3 , followed by  4 that gives a physical explanation of the results .",
    "conclusions are given in  5 .",
    "we perform cosmological simulations with the adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) eulerian hydro code , enzo @xcite .",
    "first we ran a low resolution simulation with a periodic box of @xmath15mpc on a side .",
    "we identified a region centered on a cluster of mass of @xmath16 at @xmath17 .",
    "we then resimulate with high resolution of the chosen region embedded in the outer @xmath18mpc box to properly take into account large - scale tidal field and appropriate boundary conditions at the surface of the refined region .",
    "this simulation box is the same region as the  c \" run in @xcite .",
    "the refined region for  c \" run has a size of @xmath19mpc@xmath20 .",
    "the initial condition in the refined region has a mean interparticle - separation of @xmath21kpc comoving , dark matter particle mass of @xmath22 .",
    "the refined region is surrounded by three layers ( each of @xmath23mpc ) of buffer zones with particle masses successively larger by a factor of @xmath24 for each layer , which then connects with the outer root grid that has a dark matter particle mass @xmath25 times that in the refined region .",
    "we choose the mesh refinement criterion such that the resolution is always better than @xmath0pc physical , corresponding to a maximum mesh refinement level of @xmath26 at @xmath17 .",
    "the simulation includes a metagalactic uv background @xcite , and a model for shielding of uv radiation by neutral hydrogen @xcite .",
    "they also include metallicity - dependent radiative cooling @xcite .",
    "our simulation also solves relevant gas chemistry chains for molecular hydrogen formation @xcite , molecular formation on dust grains @xcite and metal cooling extended down to @xmath27k @xcite .",
    "star particles are created in cells that satisfy a set of criteria for star formation proposed by @xcite .",
    "each star particle is tagged with its initial mass , creation time , and metallicity ; star particles typically have masses of @xmath28@xmath29 .",
    "supernova feedback from star formation is modeled following @xcite .",
    "feedback energy and ejected metal - enriched mass are distributed into 27 local gas cells centered at the star particle in question , weighted by the specific volume of each cell , which is to mimic the physical process of supernova blastwave propagation that tends to channel energy , momentum and mass into the least dense regions ( with the least resistance and cooling ) .",
    "we allow the entire feedback processes to be hydrodynamically coupled to surroundings and subject to relevant physical processes , such as cooling and heating .",
    "the total amount of explosion kinetic energy from type ii supernovae for an amount of star formed @xmath30 with a chabrier imf is @xmath31 ( where @xmath32 is the speed of light ) with @xmath33 .",
    "taking into account the contribution of prompt type i supernovae ,",
    "we use @xmath34 in our simulation . observations of local starburst galaxies indicate that nearly all of the star formation produced kinetic energy is used to power galactic superwinds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "supernova feedback is important primarily for regulating star formation and for transporting energy and metals into the intergalactic medium .",
    "the extremely inhomogeneous metal enrichment process demands that both metals and energy ( and momentum ) are correctly modeled so that they are transported in a physically sound ( albeit still approximate at the current resolution ) way .",
    "the kinematic properties traced by unsaturated metal lines in dlas are extremely tough tests of the model , which is shown to agree well with observations @xcite .",
    "as we will show below , the properties of galaxies produced in the simulation resemble well observed galaxies , within the limitations of finite resolution .",
    "we use the following cosmological parameters that are consistent with the wmap7-normalized @xcite lcdm model : @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",

    "collecting luminosity and other quantities of member stellar particles , gas cells and dark matter particles yields the following physical parameters for each galaxy : position , velocity , total mass , stellar mass , gas mass , mean formation time , mean stellar metallicity , mean gas metallicity , star formation rate , luminosities in five sdss bands ( and various colors ) and others .",

    "there are two different ways to define major mergers .",
    "first , a theoretical one where we identify the merger time as that when two galaxies with a stellar mass ratio greater than @xmath11 are fully integrated into one with no identifiable separate stellar peaks .",
    "second , an observational one where a major merger is defined to be that where a galaxy has a neighbor galaxy with a stellar mass greater than @xmath11 its mass at a lateral distance smaller than @xmath42kpc proper . both will be used in subsequent analysis .",
    "it is useful to state that the observationally - oriented definition does not always lead to a true merger of the usual sense , because either the two galaxies are a projected pair , or their merging time scale is much longer than the relevant dynamic time or the time before something else will have happened to the two concerned galaxies .",
    "some informative comparisons or distinctions between the two will be made , when useful .",
    "we find that there are about 2000 - 3000 galaxies with stellar mass greater than @xmath1 maximally resolved at better than @xmath0pc at each redshift snapshot in the range @xmath43 , providing us with unprecedented statistical power .    in @xcite",
    "we show that galaxy luminosity functions for both uv and fir selected galaxies can be self - consistently produced by the simulation .",
    "this , in combination with other , independent tests of the simulation , including the properties of the damped lyman alpha systems @xcite , strongly indicates a range of applicability of our simulation to complex systems , including galaxies at sub - kpc ism scales .",

    "the fraction of major mergers at the high stellar mass end does not significantly suffer from this  projection \" effect .",

    "it is useful to distinguish that from the theoretical one , where the latter is based on the actual merger events rather than pairs within some projected distance .",

    "we see that the actual merger rate is roughly constant at @xmath48 per unit redshift for the stellar mass range @xmath49 . at @xmath50",
    "there is hint for a significant upturn in merger rate , albeit with less statistical certainty due to a small number of such massive galaxies in the simulation .",
    "nevertheless , such an upturn would be consistent with the expectation that the central cd galaxies may experience more major mergers due to dynamical inspiral of satellites .",
    "this is also consistent with the apparent difference seen in figure  [ fig : rate ] between galaxies at @xmath7 ( red ) and galaxies at @xmath3 ( green ) in that the upturn is absent in the higher redshift range , because of the absence of large galaxies at that redshift range in the given simulation box .",
    "if the simulation box were large enough to contain cd - like galaxies at that higher - redshift range , we expect to see the same upturn .",
    "the downturn at @xmath51 of the merger rate is still more dramatic .",
    "we see a decrease of merger rate by a factor of @xmath52 from @xmath53 to @xmath54 .",
    "this should be compared to about a factor of @xmath55 drop seen in figure  [ fig : majorfrac ] across the mass range .",
    "this shows that the vast majority of galaxies of mass @xmath56 that are seen in close proximity ( @xmath57  kpc ) with other galaxies of comparable masses are in fact do not end up in binary major mergers . in @xcite",
    "we show that the simulation reproduces observed luminosity functions in the concerned redshift range , indicating that the simulation is  complete \" down to about a galaxy stellar mass of @xmath58 .",
    "thus , the results for the range of galaxy stellar mass shown here is reliable . a plausible physical explanation for the sharp downturn at the low mass end may be that most satellite galaxies just zoom around and never merge with their fellow satellite galaxies rather they dynamically spiral in to merge with the primary galaxy or",
    "remain as satellites .",
    "a more detailed study focused on the demographics of mass accretion , including mergers , will be presented elsewhere .",
    "here we present a third - order polynomial fit to the major merger rate , @xmath59 , defined to be the number of major mergers per unit redshift : @xmath60 shown as the solid black curve in figure  [ fig : rate ] , where @xmath61 is in solar masses .",

    "similar to figure  [ fig : majorfrac ] , the actual major merger fraction at the low sfr end shown is overestimated , given the observational definition used .",
    "the major merger rate at the high sfr end , at sfr@xmath62  yr@xmath63 , is less affected and the simulation shows that one should expect to see @xmath64 of these high sfr galaxies to be in apparent major mergers .",
    "this fraction is consistent with the observed upper bound of 57% ( 8/14 ) for the submillimeter galaxy ( smgs ) sample of @xcite at @xmath65 that show a double - peaked profile in the co 3 - 2/4 - 3 emission . of this observed fraction of smgs in major mergers ,",
    "a fraction of it may be due to orbital motion of emitting gas in a disk configuration or some other configurations instead of major mergers .",
    "we predict that , when high spatial resolution become available with the upcoming alma mission , _ the fraction due to major mergers should be in the range @xmath64 _ , if our model is correct . for star - forming galaxies of sfr@xmath66  yr@xmath63 at @xmath43",

    "this suggests that , irrespective of being in major mergers or not , gas inflows to the central regions appear to be ubiquitous ; in other words , galaxies that are not in major mergers appear to be able to channel a sufficient amount of gas to fuel the star formation on time scales that are much longer than the gas depletion times in the central regions .",
    "the disparity in the gas depletion time scales of the central regions and between those and the overall star formation durations strongly imply that gas inflows , in general , are not smooth but in the form of clumps falling in intermittently .    to further demonstrate that gas inflows towards the central regions are generally not caused by central non - spherical gravitational perturbations ,",

    "this is consistent with the implied intermittency of fueling seen in figure  [ fig : tgasdepletion ] . in any event , the results indicate that major mergers do not appear to form a distinct set of galaxies with respective to gas metallicity in the central regions .",

    "we attribute the difference primarily to the difference in the physical properties of galaxies between merger simulations and those in present cosmological simulation at @xmath2 .",
    "specifically , as we will show shortly , most of galaxies in our simulation appear to have massive stellar bulges , whereas merger simulations with dramatic inflows seen during mergers start with pre - merger disk galaxies without massive stellar bulges .",
    "in fact , a subset of simulations by @xcite where the per - merger galaxies have massive stellar bulges has already provided insight for the above apparent discrepancy : they note that dense bulges act to stabilize galaxies against bar modes and have much diminished inflow enhancement .    in the left panel of figure  [ fig : remstarz2 ]",

    "no dust obscuration is applied in the calculation so the computed radii are likely lower limits ; if we had taken dust obscuration into account , we expect the agreement would still be better .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ fig : remstarz2 ] shows the 1-d velocity dispersion at the effective stellar radius as a a function of stellar mass and we find that within the uncertainties the simulation results are in agreement with the observations , indicative of a self - consistency of the simulation results .",
    "the observed high value of central velocity dispersion @xcite was somewhat surprising initially based on an extrapolation of local elliptical galaxy properties , but now that additional observations have confirmed the earlier discovery and our simulations indicate that this is in fact in line with the theoretical expectation based on the cold dark matter model .",
    "there is one exception @xcite that shows a lower central velocity dispersion ; our current statistics are insufficient to gauge this against our model one way or another . although the simulation results and observations are statistically consistent with one another , enlarging both the simulation size and observed galaxy sample size may provide very useful constraints on physical processes that govern the formation of the bulges .",
    "if pressed , one might incline to conclude that there is a slight hint that the simulated galaxies are slightly smaller than the handful of observed galaxies , although the observed ones overlap and are statistically consistent with the simulated range in terms of velocity dispersion at a fixed stellar mass .",
    "nonetheless , three effects may have caused slight overestimation of the velocity dispersions of simulated galaxies .",
    "first , no dust obscuration effect is taken into account .",
    "second , no observational beam smearing effect is taken into account .",
    "third , the simulated galaxies at a fixed stellar mass have a range in sfr , whereas the observed galaxies shown are thought to be quiescent ; one might think that gas loss from aging or dying stars acts in the direction of enlarging stellar cores with aging stellar population due to adiabatic expansion related to mass loss that is known to be substantial .    to be prudent and conservative ,",
    "we have purposely plotted the symbol size in the right panel of figure  [ fig : remstarz2 ] to be linearly proportional to the sfr to see if there is noticeable trend in sfr with core size / velocity dispersion .",
    "we see one case , the green solid dot at ( @xmath118,150km / s ) , that has a sfr that may be a factor of a few higher than typical galaxies at around that mass .",
    "however , we also see galaxies to have higher sfr even though having much higher velocity dispersions , with or without major mergers . in any case",
    ", it appears that some of the noticeably high sfr galaxies are consistent with being randomly distributed with respect to @xmath119 .",
    "thus , we conclude that there is no dramatic trend of sfr with respect to @xmath119 at a fixed stellar mass in the range of @xmath119 that overlaps with observed values , save the one noted exceptions that is presently difficult to gauge statistically .",
    "this check suggests that our results are not hinged on our modeling of the size of the central stellar bulges being perfectly correct and are thus robust to possible small variations .",
    "taking the evidence presented in the preceding four figures together a consistent physical picture emerges :    @xmath120 gravitational or hydrodynamic torques stemming from scales larger than the central regions containing most of the stars in the primary galaxy may play a fundamental role in transporting the necessary amount of gas to fuel the star formation in the central regions .",
    "@xmath120 a large portion of often metal - poor gas from large scales is directly transported into the central regions , possibly in the form of dynamical friction inspiraling gas clumps , infalling satellites on nearly radial orbits , or clumpy cold streams from large scales in an intermittent fashion .",
    "@xmath120 significant gas inflows , not necessarily requiring major mergers , allow for formation of dense , compact , not - so - flat stellar bulges that are stable to bar formation .",
    "@xmath120 major mergers of galaxies , most of which have dense bulges , do not dramatically enhance gas inflows and sfr or cause significant differences in gas properties in the central regions for galaxies at @xmath92 , in accord with earlier major mergers simulations of disk galaxies with massive bulges .",
    "with high resolution and a physically sound treatment of relevant physical processes , our state - of - the - art , adaptive mesh - refinement eulerian cosmological hydrodynamic simulations have reproduced well some key observables of the galaxy population as a whole @xcite , including galaxy luminosity functions at @xmath121 , galaxy color distribution at @xmath17 , the entire star formation history , and properties of damped lyman alpha systems that we have so far examined . here",
    "we study how major mergers affect star formation .",
    "the simulation contains about @xmath10 galaxies with stellar masses in the range @xmath5 and resolved at better than @xmath0pc at @xmath43 , providing a good statistical sample to examine major mergers for a wide of range of galaxies in mass and sfr .",
    "the most significant finding is that major mergers , on average , do not result in two orders of magnitude boost in sfr , as found in simulations of major mergers of gas - rich disk galaxies with idealized initial conditions .",
    "rather , for the redshift range examined , @xmath43 , major mergers give rise to an average boost @xmath14 in specific sfr for sfr in range of @xmath12/yr examined .",
    "two physical factors of cosmological origin that are not taken into account in isolated merger simulations may be responsible for the difference .",
    "first , the central regions ( @xmath122kpc ) of galaxies at @xmath2 , in the absence of major mergers , are being fed , in an intermittent fashion , with significant gas inflows . as a result ,",
    "galaxies without major mergers at @xmath2 have much higher sfr than their lower redshift counterparts , a fact that is known observationally .",
    "we demonstrate that , at least for a significant fraction of galaxies , gas inflows to the central regions , often quite metal poor , originate from large scales ( not smooth gas from the regions immediately surrounding the central region ) possibly in the form of dynamical friction inspiraling gas clumps , infalling satellites on nearly radial orbits , or clumpy cold streams from large scales .",
    "we suggest that gravitational or hydrodynamic torques stemming from scales larger than the central regions play a fundamental role in transporting the necessary amount of gas to fuel the star formation in the central regions .",
    "how this is achieved physically and which processes are most important are some of the very important issues that will be investigated in a future study .",
    "second , the large inflows of gas in galaxies with or without major mergers produce compact , dense stellar cores / bulges with high velocity dispersions that are in agreement with observations and stable to bar formation .",
    "the dense massive stellar bulges significantly diminish the importance of the major mergers induced , additional gas inflows for galaxies at @xmath92 , in good agreement with earlier major mergers simulations of disk galaxies with massive bulges .",
    "this result implies that a substantial revision of the current theoretical framework for galaxy formation is necessary , since some of the major foundational elements in our interpretation of galaxy properties hinge on the requirements / beliefs that major mergers are responsible for some of the extreme galaxy formation events , including high luminosity galaxies , such as starbursting galaxies , ulirgs and smgs , and formation of supermassive black holes .",
    "@xmath120 the merger rate per unit redshift is roughly constant at @xmath125 for galaxies in the stellar mass range of @xmath126 with an upturn and a dramatic downturn above and below that mass range , respectively , for the redshift range @xmath127 . a fitting formula is provided in eq  [ eq : r ] .    @xmath120 for galaxies with sfr greater than @xmath128/yr we predict that about @xmath64 should be seen in major mergers at @xmath124 .",
    "this predicted fraction is somewhat lower than what current spectral observations suggest ( e.g. , 57% ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but can be directly tested with high resolution imaging with alma .    @xmath120 it is predicted that the cumulative probability distribution function of major merging galaxies within a projected separation @xmath129 goes approximately as @xmath130 for galaxies with sfr@xmath131/yr ( for @xmath129 greater than a few kpc ) .",
    "we expect that alma may be able to provide a direct measurement to test this .",
