    "from observational data and different types of cosmological evidences we know that our universe is in acceleration expansion era due to an unknown reason @xcite . different kinds of theories have been introduced to emplain and clarify this accelerated behavior of the universe . in the frame of classical theory of gravity based on einstein equations , we label this acceleration to the dark energy with an unknown essence with a simple candidate as cosmological constant or vacuum energy of quantum fields spread in the whole space time @xcite , with two siginificant features as fine - tuning of different orders of vacuum energy and cosmic coincidence ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "inspired from string theory , holographic dark energy ( hde ) scenario has been constructed to explain problems of cosmological constant and others @xcite . in this scenario",
    "we supposed that the total energy of all matter fields in a system with physical size @xmath5 must be less than the total energy of a black hole with the same schwarzschild radius , namely @xmath6 here @xmath7 denotes the holographic dark energy density as a function of the @xmath8 cut - off , @xmath5 as prefered ir cut - off and @xmath9 planck mass . by saturating the above inequality ( 1.1 ) by choosing the largest length @xmath5 one identifies the holographic dark energy : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is some constant . is not speed of light ]    since the model of holographic dark energy model emerges from one of the fundamental principles of physics , it has been extremely successful in explaining numerous cosmological puzzles and has been a leading candidate of cosmic acceleration problem .",
    "specifically it can resolve the coincidence problem @xcite and phantom crossing @xcite .",
    "besides the model has reasonable agreement with the astrophysical data of cmb , sne ia and galaxy redshift surveys @xcite . on these accounts ,",
    "the hde paradigm has been extended via different cut - offs @xcite and entropy corrections @xcite .",
    "a recent extension of this idea is ( @xmath0)-type holographic dark energy @xcite , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the parameters associated with the chosen ir cut - off at a phenomenological level ( explicitly written in later sections ) .",
    "it is a generalization of the old models of hde and agegraphic dark energy .",
    "reconstruction of modified gravity theories according to hde has been discussed in literature before .",
    "independently setare and wu & zu @xcite studied correspondence of hde and @xmath1 gravity .",
    "recently it has been investigated the relations between hde and @xmath2 gravity @xcite . in this article",
    ", we investigate the correspondence of @xmath14)-type hde in first modification of eintein gravity in @xmath1 and secondly in a recently proposed weitzenbock model based on scalar torsion @xmath2 gravity .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows : in sec - ii , we study correspondence of @xmath14)-type hde in @xmath2 gravity . in sec - iii , we obtain the reconstructed form of @xmath2 under the assumption of power - law acceleration . in sec - iv , we discuss the cosmography for the @xmath2 model . in sec - v ,",
    "we study correspondence of @xmath14)-type hde in @xmath1 gravity and discuss its viability in sec - vi .",
    "we briefly discuss conclusions in sec - vii .",
    "we adopt the natural gravitational units @xmath15",
    "in this section we summarrize basics of generalized teleparallel gravity ( gtegr ) of namely @xmath2 in which we extend the tegr lagrangian @xmath4 ( which is dynamically equivalent to gr ) to a generic function @xmath16 as we did for the generalization of gr to the modified @xmath1 gravity .",
    "one form of the action of @xmath2 gravity coupled minimally to matter @xmath17 is given by @xcite @xmath18,\\ ] ] where @xmath19 and @xmath17 is the matter fields lagrangian density .",
    "the tegr lagrangian @xmath20,is just the torsion scalar and can be wriiten explicitly as the following : @xmath21 where @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the contorsion tensor @xmath24 here dynamical variable is vierbein tetrads @xmath25 , consequently the field equations are derived by @xmath26 : @xmath27",
    "where @xmath28 , @xmath29 is the stress tensor .",
    "different aspects of this torsion theory have been investigate @xcite .",
    "we consider cosmology of a spatially - flat @xmath30 universe obeys the modified friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) equations from the metric as : @xmath31 where @xmath32 stands for the scale factor and @xmath33 is the cosmic time . because of isotropicity and homogenious assumptions , we assume that the spacetime contains perfect fluid matter fields , so the field equations ( 2.5 ) , we can write @xmath34 here @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the energy density and pressure of extra fields , @xmath37 is the hubble parameter .",
    "we now propose the correspondence between the @xmath38 type holographic dark energy scenario and gtegr @xmath2 dark energy model .",
    "for @xmath39 holographic dark energy density @xmath7 we write : @xmath40 with @xmath41 and @xmath42 is defined by @xcite @xmath43 which , on using an appropriate transformation can be written as @xmath44 this model proposed in the level of a phenomenological model for dark enegy . it is straighforward to show that the model mimics a kind of generalized agegraphic dark energy models .",
    "but it is an essential difference between the agegraphic model of dark energy and this new proposed alternative .",
    "the naive difference backs to the choice of the appropriate cut - off of the model .",
    "the cut - off is a physically meaningfull and reachable scale of length . here in this new proposed model as @xmath39 type , we select`` the conformal - like age as the holographic characteristic size''. another adventages of this model is that although the pair of the @xmath39 are real arbitary constants , but for some reasonable values of @xmath45 this extended model of holographic dark energy suddently passes the phantom cross line @xmath46 .",
    "the main motivation of this phantom cross line is that , in spite of the usual scalar models of phantom dark energy , here there is no need to introducing an interaction function phenomenologically between a two component mix fluids of the dark energy and matter .",
    "this model also is applicable to introduce a new generalized future event horizon as the characteristic size of the model and consequently a new cut - off .",
    "we indicate here that in this model the pair of @xmath39 are arbitarary and at level of phenomenologicalthey high energy models , need not be integers . in general about these parameters we can say , for age - like holographic models , in the case of @xmath47 it seems that dark energy has the same time evolution as the dominant ingredient in the early epoches of the universe , implying that dark energy might be unied with dark matter , analogous to what happened in cosmological models with generalized chaplygin gas .",
    "also we mention here that particle horizon as the holographic characteristic scale in thios model corresponds to @xmath48 .",
    "further we want to specify the values of @xmath12 as a special case .",
    "it is easy to show that for @xmath49 , then the hde is equivalent to a phantom eld .",
    "when @xmath50 , then the holographic dark energy is just the cosmological constant . also .",
    "the new agegraphic dark energy model corresponds to @xmath51 .",
    "finally if @xmath52 , the hde can drive the universe into an accelerating phase .",
    "clearly we must fix this choice in favor of observational data . the pairs @xmath53 and @xmath54 , are compatiable with observation data .    using the definition of critical energy density @xmath55",
    ", we can write the dimensionless dark energy parameter as @xmath56 apply the definition of @xmath57 and @xmath58 , we can write @xmath59 @xmath60 in dark energy dominanted era it evolves according to the conservation equation @xmath61 differentiating ( 2.8 ) and using ( 2.13 ) , we can write @xmath62\\rho_{v}.\\ ] ] so with this , eq .",

    "we assume that the accelerated expansion of the whole universe is governed by a power law scale factor , like @xmath72 using this simple but physically reasonable assumption , we have the following quantities from ( [ l]),([omegav]),([t]),([rhov ] ) @xmath73 ^ 2 t^{2p(m - n)},\\\\ t&=&-\\frac{6p^2}{t^2},\\\\ \\rho_v&=&3\\big[b(pn+1)\\big]^2\\big[-\\frac{6p^2}{t}\\big]^{-1+p(m - n)}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] substituting these expressions in ( [ eq ] ) and by a change of the variable to the @xmath74 , we obtain @xmath75 which gives us the following elementary solution @xmath76 where @xmath77(6p^2)^{-\\frac{3}{2}+p(m - n)}.\\ ] ] this gtegr model is a natural extension of our former model of generalized teleparallel gravity @xcite . if @xmath78 , then this model coincides with @xcite . from the cosmography @xcite and using data of bao , supernovae ia and wmap , we notice that in this case with @xmath78 which is equivalence to the extended particle horizon as cut - off , if we choose @xmath79",
    "but for general model , proposed in ( [ model ] ) it is needed to check that the cosmography parameters .",
    "we need that @xmath80 it s better we write the ( [ model ] ) in the following form @xmath81 where @xmath82 by substituting ( [ model2 ] ) in ( [ test ] ) we obtain @xmath83    @xmath84    @xmath85    where @xmath86",
    "to reconstruction of frw cosmology in @xmath87 ( for general review , see @xcite and @xcite ) we start by the following action : @xmath88 the first frw equation is : @xmath89 again by assumning the power law expansion @xmath90 as the previous f(t ) reconstruction , using @xmath91 ^ 2t^{2(-1+p(m - n))}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so @xmath92 ^",

    "based on cosmological viable @xmath1 models tests in ref .",
    "@xcite the essential constraints and limitations @xcite for action : @xmath97 to be consistent with gravitational ( solar system tests ) and cosmological ( large scale behaviors ) are :    1 .",

    "we observe that validity conditions ( 1 - 4 ) depends on the parameters @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "for generality , we consider the only case @xmath103 .",
    "1 .   @xmath104 for @xmath105 .",
    "thus this model is stable for ultra voiolent ( uv ) completion of gr with an effective gravitational constant @xmath106 .",
    "obviously in the very early universe the curvature was very high when @xmath107 .",
    "2 .   to avoiding the guest problem in uv regime",
    "we must check @xmath105,@xmath100 .",
    "it means @xmath108 so theory is ghost free due to effects of modified gravity .",
    "3 .   @xmath109 .",
    "further @xmath110 . so the model recovers gr in the begining uv regime .",
    "4 .   for our model in uv regime @xmath111 .",
    "so this model confirms the local solar system tests .",
    "also we estimate it numerically to find : @xmath112 .",
    "so our f(r ) model reconstructed from hde is a ghost free and observationally viable according to viability conditions .     for @xmath113 .",
    "note that @xmath114 .",
    "so at late time , i.e. at @xmath115 , the power @xmath116 is dominant . ]",
    "in this paper , we studied a correspondence between a newly proposed model of @xmath38 type hde model with two modified theories of gravity namely @xmath1 and @xmath2 gravity .",
    "this study generalizes some previous studies such as the papers cited in the abstracts . for our obtained @xmath2 model",
    ", we calculated the cosmographic parameters while for the calculated @xmath1 model , we investigated the stability and viability conditions .",
    "it is shown that our model of @xmath1 recovers to general relativistic limit at early times , free from ghosts , and consistent with the solar system tests .",
    "so , we reconstructed a newly motivated model of holographic dark energy in the frame work of models of modified gravity , one in usual riemannian form f(r ) and another with weitzenbock connections in the frame work of modified einstein - cartan theory .",
