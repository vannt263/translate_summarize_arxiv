    "main advantage of the radio - guided surgery ( rgs ) technique exploiting @xmath0 radiation  @xcite , compared to the traditional rgs using @xmath1 radiation  @xcite , is a more favourable ratio between the signal coming from the tumor and the rest of the body .",
    "conversely to the tracers with @xmath1 emitters , pure @xmath0 radionuclides emit electrons which penetrate only a few millimeters of tissue and produce almost no gamma radiation ( the _ bremsstrahlung _ contribution above 100  kev being less than 0.1% ) resulting in a very low background on the lesion signal .",
    "operating in a low background environment allows the development of a handy and compact probe which , detecting particles emitted locally , provides a clearer delineation of margins of the lesioned tissue .",
    "the rgs technique applicability can therefore be extended also to cases with large uptake of the tracer from healthy organs next to the lesion , minimizing the radiotracer activity to be administered .",
    "low exposure of the medical team is also expected  @xcite .    for this technique to enter in the clinical practice , relevant clinical cases need to be identified , suitable",
    "radio - tracers need to be developed for them and a detector needs to be designed and tested for this specific application .",
    "the most relevant clinical cases are those where the rgs with @xmath1 radiation is not applicable because of the presence of uptaking organs nearby , for instance cerebral , abdominal and pediatric tumors .",
    "probe.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    among the existing radio - tracers those that are linked to pure @xmath0 emitters are those used in radio - methabolic treatments with @xmath2y , such as peptide receptor radionuclide therapy  @xcite .",
    "such tracers are somatostatin analogues ( e.g. dotatoc  @xcite ) and very selective for meningioma  @xcite and neuroendocrine tumors ( net )  @xcite .",
    "our first choice has been indeed to use meningioma as proof of principle and abdominal nets as a first application with clinical relevance . in the case of administration of @xmath2y - dotatoc for meningioma , glioma and net",
    "we have performed feasibility studies  @xcite of which the present paper describes critical ingredients .",
    "we are finalizing the authorizations for the clinical tests . nonetheless , to extend this technique beyond nets ,",
    "other radio - tracers need to be considered and we can not restrict only to pure @xmath0 decays .",
    "there is indeed a significant number of nuclides which have a half - life ( @xmath3 ) compatible with clinical applications and a limited @xmath1 radiation .",
    "for instance @xmath4re has @xmath5  h and 137  kev photons in only 9% of the cases . to this aim",
    ", the design of the detector needs to take into account the existence of a @xmath1 radiation , albeit limited , and the softer @xmath0 spectrum ( endpoint at 1.1  mev as opposed to 2.3  mev ) .",
    "finally , the requirements on the detecting probe are driven by the surgical conditions and by the characteristics of the radio - tracers : the probe needs to be sensitive to residuals as small as 0.1  ml , benchmark chosen by the sensitivity of the pre - operative diagnostics ; it needs to be directional , i.e. insensitive to radiation from the sides ; it needs to have the largest possible detection efficiency on electrons with the smallest sensitivity to photons ; the smallest is the minimum electron energy that can be detected , the wider is the applicability of the technique because it allows for more radio - isotopes to be used and because it retains the sensitivity to tumor even if a thin layer of other tissues or liquids covers it ; finally , it needs to match the security standards for intra - operative use .    in this context",
    ", this paper describes the design details of our first prototype and the test in laboratory of its performances .",
    "such tests had to be designed to reproduce by means of phantoms and automated procedures conditions as close as possible to the surgical environment .",
    "the outcome of these tests were input to the simulations that were used to estimate the sensitivity of the rgs technique proposed in several clinical cases  @xcite , studies that are preliminary to the clinical tests .",
    "in the first prototype of the intraoperative probe ( fig .  [",
    "fig : probes4 ] ) the radiation sensitive element is a scintillator tip made of commercial poly - crystalline para - terphenyl doped to 0.1% in mass with diphenylbutadiene  @xcite manufactured by detec - europe .",
    "this material was adopted , after a detailed study  @xcite , due to its high light yield ( @xmath63 times larger than typical organic scintillators ) , negligible hygroscopy , and low density , characteristics that minimize the sensitivity to photons .",
    "different detector sizes were tested : the best configuration resulted in a cylinder of 5  mm in diameter and 3  mm in height .",
    "the scintillator tip is shielded from radiation coming from the sides by a black pvc ring with external diameter of 11  mm .",
    "a 10  @xmath7m - thick aluminium front - end sheet covers the detector window to ensure light tightness .",
    "this assembly is mounted on top of an easy - to - handle aluminum cylindrical body ( diameter 8  mm and length 14  cm ) .    in order to avoid the risk of patients coming into contact with electrical devices ,",
    "the scintillation light is guided by four 50  cm long optical fibres outside the probe to a hamamatsu h10721 - 210 photo - multiplier tube ( pmt ) .",
    "this photo - sensor module has an integrated high voltage power supply circuit requiring an input voltage as low as 5  v , making this device compatible with the surgical environment .",
    "finally , the read - out electronics and the logic board are housed in a compact box that wirelessly connects to a remote monitor to display the counting rate  @xcite .",
    "the characterization of the probe response to @xmath0 decays is performed with two @xmath2sr sources a point - like one with nominal activity of @xmath6370  bq ( _ point - source _ ) and a 1.6  cm diameter source with a @xmath8  kbq activity ( _ extended - source _ ) .",
    "the @xmath2sr spectrum is made of two components in secular equilibrium : the sr @xmath0 decay to @xmath2y and the subsequent @xmath0 decay of the daughter .",
    "the latter component is exactly the one relevant for the proposed for rgs if @xmath2y is used .      to reduce",
    "the required injected activity it is important to maximize the efficiency .",
    "furthermore , given the fact that even if we are currently considering @xmath2y as radionuclide different emitters will have to be considered in the future , it is important to know how low in energy the sensitivity of the probe extends .",
    "therefore , we had to setup an ad - hoc measurement to evaluate the efficiency as a function of the emitted electron .    to this aim a vertical scan over the _ extended - source _ was performed measuring the rate with both the source and the probe in water for several distances ( @xmath9 ) between the two .",
    "the presence of increasing amounts of water dumps the @xmath0 energy spectrum in a way that depends on the energy dependence of the efficiency . on the other hand ,",

    "it also simulates the light emission and collection with the parameters measured in ref .",
    "@xcite , returning the number of photoelectrons reaching the pmt ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the fraction of the electrons that are emitted by the source and reach the detector is estimated by the fraction of the simulated electrons that satisfy the condition @xmath11 .",
    "it has to be stressed that this is not an estimate of the minimum number of photo electrons that are required to have a signal since the quantum - efficiency needs to be taken into account .    the comparison of this estimate with data allowed to extract a value of @xmath12 , in two independent ways . on one side ,",
    "@xmath12 was tuned to match the measured rate in the configuration where the probe is in contact with the source .",
    "the best compatible threshold value was found to be @xmath13 . on the other side",

    "a @xmath14 of agreement in between the data and mc rate variations between @xmath15 and @xmath16  mm was calculated for each value of @xmath12 .",
    "such @xmath14 showed a clear minimum in @xmath17 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : waterzoom ] on the right ) .",
    "the two estimates of @xmath12 are compatible and therefore we considered the average @xmath18 . to translate this estimate in terms of efficiency as a function of energy , we performed another simulation with the _ point - source _ and computed the ratio of the electron energy spectrum with and without the requirement @xmath11 . the result is shown in fig .",

    ". the efficiency raises at energies above 540 kev ( energy at which the curve reaches half of its maximum ) and reaches the high energy plateaux at 70% .      to study the capability of the probe to reconstruct active spots , the detector was mounted on a motorized linear actuator ensuring position accuracy of 1.5  @xmath7 m and horizontal scans",
    "were performed over the _ point - source _ in air .",
    "an horizontal scan over the point - like _ sr - source _ ( fig .",
    "[ fig : srprofile ] ) allowed to estimate the dependence of the spatial resolution on the distance between the probe tip and the surface .",
    "the reconstructed profiles measured at distances ranging from 350  @xmath7 m to 1.8  mm are fitted using a gaussian distribution obtaining @xmath19 between 2.8 and 4.4  mm .      the usage of pure @xmath0 emitting tracers allows to operate with low radiation background , the residual being mainly due to photons coming from the _ bremsstrahlung _ radiation of the electrons penetrating the tissue .",
    "the abundance of the expected _ bremsstrahlung _ radiation in the tissue as a function of the photon energy is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bremm90y ] as computed with a simulation of a @xmath2y source in water  @xcite .",

    "y _ bremsstrahlung _ photons in water.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    conversely , in the case non pure @xmath0 emitters are used , it is important to minimize the sensitivity to @xmath1s .",
    "to this aim , the sensitivity of the probe to photons was measured using three point - like sources : @xmath20ba emitting photons with energy ranging from 80 to 350  kev , @xmath21cs with gamma emission at e@xmath22=662  kev and @xmath23co with e@xmath24=1170  kev and e@xmath25=1330  kev .",
    "to avoid signal from electrons in the case of cs decays , three copper layers with 350  @xmath7 m thickness were inserted in sequence between the source and the probe tip , and the measurements were repeated at each step .",

    "these measurements allow us to conclude that the intraoperative @xmath0 probe is not sensitive to the _ bremsstrahlung _ photons and therefore the effectiveness of the rgs technique would not be affected by this background .",
    "a critical aspect in the test of the prototypes for the development of the new rgs technique , is the difficulty to perform realistic studies before the preclinical test .",
    "this aspect is particularly important for this technique because the outcome of the laboratory test is used to evaluate which clinical cases to consider . to this aim ,",
    "specific phantoms were designed to reproduce finite size meningioma remnants embedded in healthy brain tissue with a tnr as expected in a real clinical case , namely meningioma that is considered the test bench of this technique .",
    "the same set - up allows going through different kinds of interfaces and visual / acoustic feedback to identify which one could best assist the surgeon in the search for infected residuals .",
    "the surgical environment is simulated saturating conveniently shaped cuttings of a commercially available sponge ( wettex classic by vileda@xmath26 ) with @xmath2y - dotatoc in saline solution .",
    "the sponge is made of 65@xmath27 cellulose and 35@xmath27 cotton fibres packed as 20@xmath2820  cm wide and 2  mm thick dry sheets .",
    "the choice of the sponge was driven by its high water absorbency ( as measured by us on small samples ) , the ease of obtaining a sharp and precise cut even with few millimetre wide complex shapes , and the capability of a sample to regain its original dimensions after a wetting - drying cycle .    with this technique , both wet or dry surfaces can be produced depending on the scope of the test : dry phantoms are used to test the neat physics detector performances ( e.g. sensitivity to active spots , capability of profile reconstruction ) ; on the contrary , wet surfaces are suitable for studying and optimizing the probe usage in a more realistic environment where , for example , tip contamination might occur adding a random background to the signal coming from the tissues .    the simplest assembly made with this technique is shown in fig .  [ fig : bestaringphantom ] : a 5  mm diameter circular cutting simulating a 0.05  ml tumour residual is inserted inside a larger ( 20  mm diameter ) ring reproducing the nearby healthy tissue . a third round shape ( disk )",
    "was eventually used to reproduce the presence of further healthy tissues above or under the hot spot .",
    "different tnr between the tumour and the surrounding healthy tissue were realized drenching the cuttings , up to saturation , with the properly diluted @xmath2y solution .",
    "the elements were then dried and combined to shape the topology of interest ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bestaringcomb ] ) .",
    "the nominal activity of any phantom was inferred from the activity of the @xmath2y - dotatoc vial at the time of delivery and the dilution factor of the bath prepared to drench the samples .",
    "the relative activity of the final dried phantoms was individually measured before forming the assembly .",
    "a scan over the described assembly was performed by fixing the probe to a xz motorized system .",
    "the x linear actuator run the probe over the phantom in 1  mm steps , with a measurement time of 10  s per position , while the z actuator was used to set the tip to surface distance with a precision of 1.5  @xmath7 m .",
    "the different configurations were analyzed in terms of false - positive probability ( fp ) , i.e. the probability that the rate emitted by an healthy tissue is incorrectly flagged by the probe as tumour residual . in the actual case",
    ", this flag will be set in real time by the system comparing the signal measured over the tissue under investigation and the patient reference background previously measured over their healthy tissue .",
    "the probability of false - positive then depends on the probe efficiency , the time to response and the actual tnr .",
    "an example of a scan is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scan1 ] , where the horizontal lines indicate the minimum rate needed to ensure fp@xmath29 with a measurement . below the figure a scheme of the source indicates if the individual regions have the activity associated to background ( blue area ) or 10 times more ( red area ) .",
    "the unfilled area corresponds to non - active regions .",
    "the device clearly selects the correct region .",
    "[ fig : scan2 ] and  [ fig : scan3 ] show the same measurement performed on different tumour - health tissue patterns ( fixed the specific activity and the tnr ) that might affect the discovery potential of the probe .",
    "these evaluations were performed in a neat and well known configuration , whereas the surgical environment might introduce some perturbations as , for example , a contamination of the probe tip coming into contact with the wet active tissue .",
    "such effect can be evaluated directly from the scan shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scan1 ] adding , via software , an extra background to the measure up to the minimum tnr that makes still detectable the hot spot .",
    "the study lead to the conclusion that the probe is able to correctly identify the active spot also in case of tnr as low as 2 with @xmath30 c.l . and",
    "a time of measure of 10  s. that means that an eventual contamination would not be a problem if monitored with frequent background calibration during the operation .",
    "moreover , these results imply that the rgs technique with @xmath0 decays would be effective also in case of patients with a lower tnr compared to those affected by meningioma , and therefore they are a confirmation that the rgs could be extended to clinical case of interest with an eventual uptake of the radiotracer in the nearby healthy organs  @xcite .      a different phantom pattern was used to simulate and study the evolution of the probe response while removing an extended tumour area aiming at the identification of the minimum detectable residual . for this purpose the assembly shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : strip1 ] was used .",
    "a scan over the whole strip was repeated reducing the tumoural area by removing a tile at a time starting from the wider one ( 5  mm ) . at each iteration",
    "the assembly was packed again to always keep the tumour area enclosed between healthy tissues .",
    "the scan over the full 15  mm long tumour phantom is shown in fig .",

    "is read as follow : the cps counts start from zero ( the probe is outside the scanning area ) and increase as the probe goes over the healthy tissue .",
    "the small plateau at 30  cps defines the background level of this measure . approaching the tumour phantom , the counts increase up to plateau at about 250  cps lasting as much as the probe sensitive area is fully illuminated by the tumour area .",
