    "thermal equilibrium is quite special , not the least because the same quantity  the free energy  determines the probabilities of fluctuations and the work for reversible changes  @xcite .",
    "as one consequence , in thermal equilibrium , the _ mechanical _ pressure exerted by a fluid on its confining walls is equal to a derivative of the free energy .",
    "moreover , pressure is an intensive quantity and is constant throughout a large system .",
    "these properties are often taken for granted and have profoundly shaped our physical intuition .",
    "this intuition is challenged in non - equilibrium systems , where a mechanical pressure may still be measured from the forces exerted on confining walls , but is no longer calculable from a free energy .",
    "a fundamental question is whether the pressure in such a system can be related to its bulk properties , through an equation of state .",
    "this question has received considerable attention recently for active brownian particles ( abps )  @xcite .",
    "abps are driven out of equilibrium due to directed motion at a constant effective force , the direction of which undergoes rotational diffusion .",
    "this model is conceptually simple , but still captures essential properties of active matter . in particular , interacting abps show a motility - induced phase transition strongly resembling passive liquid - gas separation but caused dynamically  @xcite . due to their persistence of motion ,",

    "_ , a pressure , the properties of which have been studied for several geometries  @xcite . the sedimentation profile of abps  @xcite also enables the discussion of pressure in experiments  @xcite .",

    "the main purpose of this article is to highlight the distinction between the mechanical pressure @xmath0 and the _ local _ pressure @xmath1 , which is calculated in an open subsystem , due to forces exerted by its surroundings .",
    "both the mechanical pressure and the local pressure can also be expressed in terms of a _ virial _ pressure .",
    "our central result is that for ideal abps , the local pressure is still given by the equilibrium formula @xmath2 ( with local density @xmath3 and boltzmann s constant set to unity ) , independent of the driving .",
    "this might seem surprising because the mechanical pressure clearly depends on the active forces .",
    "we give several arguments why the local pressure is nevertheless a useful concept giving deeper insights into the nature of active matter .",
    "in particular , it relates to the existence of an equation of state for abps , for which we consider two formulations .",
    "the weak formulation states that the mechanical pressure can be predicted from the measurement of some properties ( to be specified ) far away from any confining walls onto which the pressure is exerted .",
    "this interpretation is followed , _",
    "e.g. _ , by solon  _ et al . _ in ref .  .",
    "in a stronger formulation we further demand that the mechanical pressure is a local observable , and thus is related to the local pressure . only in this case",
    "does one recover the properties commonly associated with the thermodynamic pressure , as becomes evident from the fact that the equation of state does not predict the observed phase boundaries  @xcite , and the existence of a negative interfacial tension  @xcite .",
    "this distinction between mechanical pressure and local pressure is also of practical importance , since the equivalence of local and mechanical pressure underpins the use of equilibrium statistical mechanics and numerical simulations to predict the mechanical pressure from atomistic simulations employing periodic boundary conditions , which is indeed one of the first applications of modern computing machines  @xcite .",

    "this is true even if the system is inhomogeneous , for example , if it contains liquid and vapor in coexistence .",
    "in contrast , the mechanical pressure of active particles is intrinsically wound up with the layers of particles which form at the boundary of the system .",
    "this observation prevents estimation of the mechanical pressure in terms of state variables within periodic systems , even for the simplest case of non - interacting active brownian particles ( see sec .",
    "[ subsec : per ] ) . to the extent that a local pressure can be defined ( either in periodic systems or in finite subsystems far from walls ) ,",
    "it is equal to @xmath74 , as shown here , and therefore differs from the mechanical pressure . in that strict sense ,",
    "an equation of state does not exist for active brownian particles . a weaker formulation [ cf .",
    "( [ equ : pwall - q ] ) ] still holds for torque - free spherical particles  @xcite , which relates the mechanical pressure to the second moment @xmath94 of orientations .",
    "it explicitly involves walls and only in the limit @xmath109 of a large separation of these walls does @xmath94 become a true bulk quantity .",
    "the physical picture is that in this limit the single adsorption events onto walls become uncorrelated and the active forces thus contribute uncorrelated noise that can be described by an elevated effective temperature .    since estimators involving winding numbers",
    "can reproduce the mechanical pressure for large systems , it might be argued that the requirement to track such history - dependent quantities is an essential price to pay for estimating pressure out of equilibrium .",
    "we note however that such an approach does not capture the properties of finite systems ( fig .",
    "[ fig : finite ] ) .",
    "moreover , if systems are inhomogeneous ( for example due to motility - induced phase separation ) , the properties of numerical estimators involving winding numbers can be extremely poor , since convergence of averaged values requires that typical particles spend significant time in both dense and sparse phases , during the simulated trajectories  @xcite .",
    "this fact again emphasises that the winding number is not a local observable , and that approaches based on such observables can not be used to characterise the local pressure or stresses in the fluid .",
    "this last observation is important since a practical motivation for defining the pressure is the derivation of hydrodynamic equations ( in the spirit of navier - stokes ) , in which fluid flow on macroscopic scales depends on pressure gradients , as well as other macroscopic properties such as viscosity .",
    "a local definition of pressure is essential for such an approach  this motivates our interpretation of equations such as ( [ eq : p ] ) in terms of hydrostatic equilibrium ( local force balance ) .",
    "in this article , we have argued that the local pressure of ideal active brownian particles should be identified as @xmath179 .",
    "this differs from the mechanical pressure exerted on walls of the system , because the walls induce changes in local density via the formation of an adsorbed layer of particles . for hard walls ,",
    "the mechanical pressure is given by @xmath106 , which lends extra support to our interpretation .",
    "the extension of these results to abps that interact by a two - body potential is straightforward and will be discussed in a future publication .",
    "our results are an important step towards a better theoretical understand of pressure and forces on immersed bodies  @xcite , which will be crucial for future application of active particles in , _",
    "e.g. _ , self - assembly",
    ". it would also be useful to connect this work with recently proposed mappings between abps and effective equilibrium systems  @xcite , in which the pressure necessarily is local .",
    "two questions that remain outstanding are ( i )  whether ( and how ) these results can be related to non - equilbrium analogs of the `` thermodynamic '' pressure defined in terms of large deviations of the density ( on the hydrodynamic scale ) ; and ( ii )  can the arguments presented here be extended to systems where the orientational evolution of the particles is no longer independent of the particle positions ?",
    "examples of this latter situation include the presence of external torques ( _ e.g. _ favoring alignment at walls ) , or torques arising from interactions between particles . finally , it is not clear to what extent we can expect a general hydrodynamic description of active fluids in terms of local pressure , density , and velocity , but we feel that identifying cases in which such a description is possible is a key goal in this area  @xcite .",
    "an appropriate definition of the local pressure is obviously vital if this is to be achieved .",

    "we derive the boundary condition of the active fluid at a hard wall by taking the limit of a `` soft '' wall , for which @xmath180 is a finite @xmath71-dependent force .",

    "[ fig : winding ] .",
    "there are no walls inside the subsystem and particles can move into and out of the subsystem .",
    "the total momentum inside @xmath155 can change either due to `` direct '' forces from outside the subsystem , or due to particles carried into ( or out of ) the subsystem by particles crossing the boundary ( _ i.e. _ , momentum flux ) .",
    "the direct contribution to the pressure is @xmath200 where @xmath201 is the force exerted on particle @xmath8 by particles that are external to subsystem @xmath155 , @xmath202 is normal to the boundary of @xmath155 , and @xmath203 is the length ( area ) of the boundary being considered .",
    "the other contribution to the pressure is the rate of momentum transfer into the system from the outside , minus the rate of momentum transfer out of the system from the inside .",
    "these two terms are equal in magnitude and together they sum to @xmath204 where @xmath205 is the velocity perpendicular to the boundary and the average is taken in a small region located at the boundary .",
    "this motivates the definition of a ( local ) momentum flux tensor @xmath206 , which can be evaluated locally .",
    "if the system is isotropic then one has @xmath207 with @xmath208 .",

    "hence the local pressure is @xmath213 .    on the other hand ,",
    "taking the limit of small @xmath36 ( at fixed @xmath60 ) , we show in the following that all non - equilibrium aspects of the problem disappear : the active swim force behaves in the same way as an extra thermal noise the particle , and one recovers equilibrium behaviour at a higher temperature @xmath62 .      to derive ( [ equ : equipart ] ) , and investigate the behaviour of correlations between particles velocities and their orientations , we consider the equations of motion for a single active particle far from any walls .",
