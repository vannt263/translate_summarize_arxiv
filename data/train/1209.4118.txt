    "the higgs boson was hypothesised as a remnant of the higgs field that was responsible for the electroweak symmetry breaking about a half century ago  @xcite . understanding the mechanism for electroweak symmetry breaking , especially by testing for the presence or absence of the standard model ( sm ) higgs boson , has been a major goal of particle physics and a central part of the fermilab tevatron physics program .",
    "both cdf and d0 collaborations have performed new combinations of multiple direct searches for the standard model higgs boson  @xcite .",
    "the new searches include more data , additional channels , and improved analyses techniques compared to previous analysis .",
    "results are derived from the complete tevatron run ii dataset , with a measured integrated luminosity of 10 fb@xmath0 of proton - antiproton data .",
    "the searches are performed for assumed higgs masses between 90 and 200 gev / c@xmath1 .",
    "the global fit of the electroweak precision data , including recent top - quark and @xmath4 boson mass measurements from the tevatron  @xcite , constrains the higgs mass @xmath5 to be less than 152 gev / c@xmath1 at the 95% conference level ( cl )  @xcite . the direct searches from lep  @xcite , tevatron  @xcite , and lhc results  @xcite set the higgs mass between 116.6 and 119.4 gev / c@xmath1 or between 122.1 and 127 gev / c@xmath1 at the 95% cl . recently both lhc experiments  @xcite observed local excesses above the background expectations for a higgs boson mass of approximately 125 gev / c@xmath1 .",
    "much of the power of the lhc searches comes from @xmath6 production and higgs boson decays to @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , which probe the couplings of the higgs boson to other bosons . in the allowed mass range ,",
    "the tevatron experiments are particularly sensitive to the association production of the higgs boson with a weak vector boson in the @xmath10 channel , which probes the higgs boson s couplings to @xmath11 quarks .",
    "the tevatron collider produces proton and anti - proton collision at the center mass of 1.96 tev with a record luminosity of 4.3  @xmath12  @xmath13s@xmath0 .",
    "the tevatron has delivered close to 12 fb@xmath0 to each experiment before the shutdown on 30 september 2011 after 28 successful years running .",
    "both cdf and d0 detectors are the general - purpose detectors , which provide excellent tracking , lepton identification , jets finding , and missing transverse energy ( @xmath14 ) detections .",
    "the details can be found elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the dominant higgs production processes at the tevatron are the gluon - gluon fusion ( @xmath6 ) and the associated production with a @xmath4 or @xmath15 boson  @xcite .",
    "the cross section for the production of sm higgs and its decays are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : xbr - decay ] as a function of the higgs mass between 100 - 200 gev / c@xmath16 .",
    "the cross section for @xmath17 production is twice that of @xmath18 and is about a factor of 10 smaller than @xmath6 .",
    "the higgs boson decay branching fraction is dominated by @xmath2 for the low - mass higgs ( @xmath19 gev / c@xmath1 ) and by @xmath3 or @xmath20 for the high - mass higgs ( @xmath21 gev / c@xmath1 ) . a search for a low - mass higgs boson in the @xmath22 channel is extremely challenging because the @xmath10 qcd production rate is many orders of magnitude larger than the higgs boson production rate . requiring the leptonic decay of the associated @xmath4 or @xmath15 boson",
    "greatly improves the expected signal over background ratio in these channels . as a result ,",
    "the higgs associated production with @xmath2 is the most promising channel for the low - mass higgs boson searches . for the high - mass higgs ,",
    "@xmath23 modes with leptonic decay provide the greatest sensitivity .",
    "the secondary channels of @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 are also considered at the tevatron .",
    "finally , all the channels have to be combined to achieve the best sm higgs sensitivity .",
    "the challenge for the standard model higgs search at the tevatron is that the higgs signal is so tiny compared to that of other sm processes with the same final states .",
    "the search strategies employed by the cdf and d0 collaborations are quite similar and have been evolving constantly over time .",
    "we first maximize the signal acceptances by using efficient triggers , excellent lepton identifications , and powerful @xmath11-tagging , which can improve the signal to the background ratio up to the 1% level .",
    "then we use multivariate analysis ( mva ) to exploit the kinematic differences between the signal and background , which can further enhance the signal to the background ratio up to the 10% level in the high score regions .",
    "the same strategies have been used to help discover the single - top and diboson processes at the tevatron , which provide a solid ground for how to isolate a small signal out of the huge background .    for the low - mass @xmath2 signatures we look for a @xmath10 mass resonance produced in association with a @xmath4 or @xmath15 boson where @xmath4 decays into @xmath27 or @xmath15 decays into @xmath28 or @xmath29 .",
    "the @xmath30 is the most sensitive channel that gives one high @xmath31 lepton , large @xmath14 , and two @xmath11-jets . before @xmath11-tagging ,",
    "the sample is predominated by the @xmath4 + light - flavor jets , which provides ideal control data to test the background modeling .    for the high - mass @xmath3 signatures ,",
    "we look for the higgs boson decaying into a @xmath8 pair in the inclusive higgs events that lead to many interesting final states .",
    "the most sensitive channel is both w bosons decaying leptonically that gives an opposite - signed dilepton , large @xmath14 , and some jets from the initial state radiation or other production processes .",
    "because of the missed neutrinos in the final state , the higgs mass can not be reconstructed .",
    "we have to rely on the event kinematic that distinguishes signal from background .",
    "for example , the @xmath32 of two leptons from the higgs decay prefers a smaller @xmath32 than the background due to the fact that the higgs is a scalar particle .",
    "we can further improve the separation between signal and background by combining the @xmath32 with other kinematic variables in the event using a multivariate discriminant .",
    "since there are two @xmath11-quark jets from the low - mass higgs decay , improving @xmath11-tagging is crucial . both cdf and d0 use mva @xmath11-tagging to exploit the decay of long - lived @xmath33 hadron as displaced tracks / vertices .",
    "the typical efficiency is about 40 - 70% with a mistag rate of 1 - 5% per jet .",
    "recently cdf combined their existing @xmath11-taggers into a higgs optimized @xmath11-tagger ( hobit )  @xcite using a neural network tagging algorithm , based on sets of kinematic variables sensitive to displaced decay vertices and tracks within jets with large transverse impact parameters relative to the hard - scatter vertices . using an operating point which gives an equivalent rate of false tags , the new algorithm improves upon previous @xmath11-tagging efficiencies by @xmath34 20% .",
    "[ fig : beff - mistag ] shows the comparison of @xmath11-tag efficiency vs mistag rejection for the existing taggers and hobit @xmath11-tagger as shown in the black curve .",
    "the @xmath11-tag efficiency is calibrated using the @xmath35 events selected in the @xmath4 + three or more jets sample and the @xmath11-enriched inclusive electron data , while the mistag rate is determined using the @xmath4 + one jet sample .",
    "the ratio of @xmath11-tag efficiency per @xmath11-jet measured from the data and the monte carlo is used as a scale factor to correct for the differences in the monte carlo modeling ,    to discriminate higgs signal events against background , using mva would improve the background rejection with a sensitivity gain of 25% , compared to using a single variable alone , such as the dijet mass .",
    "we can further improve mva by training different backgrounds , splitting events into sub - channels based on s / b , e.g. lepton type , number of jets .",
    "cdf trains @xmath36 separately against @xmath35 , @xmath37 or @xmath38 , and diboson to build the final discriminat .",
    "we describe the searches for the low - mass higgs boson at the tevatron in some detail .",
    "one of the golden channels for the low - mass higgs boson search is the higgs produced in association with a @xmath4 boson with @xmath39  @xcite .",
    "we select events with one isolated high @xmath31 lepton ( electron , muon , or isolated track ) , a large missing transverse energy , and two or three jets , of which at least one is required to be @xmath11-tagged as containing a weakly - decaying b hadron .",
    "events with more than one isolated lepton are rejected . for the multivariate discriminant , cdf trained a bayesian neural network discriminant(bnn ) in the @xmath4 + two and three jets for each higgs mass , separately for each lepton , jet multiplicity , @xmath11-tagging category .",
    "for the d0 @xmath39 analyses , the data are split by lepton type , jet multiplicity , and the number of @xmath11-tagged jets , similar to cdf .",
    "the outputs of boosted decision trees ( bdt ) , trained separately for each sample and for each higgs boson mass , are used as the final discriminating variables .",
    "we perform a direct search for an excess of events in the signal region of the final discriminant from each event category .",
    "[ fig : wh - output ] shows the output of the final discriminants optimized for a 115 gev / c@xmath1 higgs signal in the double @xmath11-tagged @xmath4 + two jets data from cdf and d0 , respectively .",
    "the data and background predictions are in good agreement .",
    "the expected higgs signals are also shown , but rescaled by a large factor .    since there is no significant excess of signal observed in the data , we set an upper limit at 95% cl on the higgs production cross section times branching ratio with respect to the sm predictions as a function of higgs mass , as shown in fig .  [",

    "gev / c@xmath1 , cdf set an observed ( expected ) upper limit at 4.9(2.8 ) while d0 set a limit at 6.2(4.8 ) .",
    "they are not yet competitive for a single channel and we need to combine all other channels including both cdf and d0 results together .",
    "another interesting channel to search for the low - mass higgs boson is @xmath42  @xcite .",
    "it provides a clean signature , but has a low event yield due to a small branching fraction of @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "we select events with two high @xmath31 leptons from @xmath15 decay and two or three jets .",
    "events are further divided based on lepton type , jet multiplicity , and the number of @xmath11-tagged jets , similar to @xmath39 . to increase",
    "signal accepance d0 loosens the selection criteria for one of the leptons to include an isolated track not reconstructed in the muon detector or an electron from the inter - cryostat region of the d0 calorimeter .",
    "cdf uses neural networks to select loose dielectron and dimuon candidates .",
    "d0 applies a kinematic fit to optimize reconstruction while cdf corrects jet energies for the missing @xmath45 using a neural network approach .",
    "d0 uses random forests of decision trees to provide the final discriminant for sitting limits .",
    "cdf utilizes a multi - layer discriminant based on neural networks where separate discriminant functions are used to define four separate regions of the final discriminant function .",
    "[ fig : llbb - output ] shows the final discriminant optimized for a higgs signal ( @xmath46 gev / c@xmath1 ) in the @xmath11-tagged events from cdf and the double @xmath11-tagged events from d0 , respectively .",
    "there seem to be some excess of events in the high score signal region , but not statistically significant yet .",
    "cdf set an observed ( expected ) upper limit at 95% cl on the higgs cross section times branching ratio over the standard model prediction at 7.2(3.6 ) while d0 set a limit at 6.9(5.9 ) for the higgs mass at 125 gev / c@xmath1 .",
    "we also looked for the higgs boson in the @xmath18 and @xmath17 channels where the @xmath15 decays into two neutrinos or the lepton from @xmath4 decay is undetected  @xcite .",
    "it has a large signal rate as well as a large qcd - multijet background .",
    "however , the final state is relatively clean , containing two high @xmath45 jets and a large missing transverse energy .",
    "we require @xmath14@xmath48 gev and two @xmath11-tagged jets .",
    "both cdf and d0 use a track - based missing transverse momentum calculation as a discriminant against false @xmath14 .",
    "in addition both cdf and d0 utilize multivariate technique , a neural network for cdf and a boosted decision tree for d0 , to further discriminate against the multi - jet background .",
    "the final discriminant is obtained for a higgs signal ( @xmath49 gev / c@xmath1 ) by combining dijet mass , track @xmath14 , and other kinematic variables , which are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : metbb - output ] for cdf and d0 , respectively .",
    "there seems a good agreement between data and background predictions , as cdf set an observed ( expected ) upper limit at 95% cl on the higgs cross section times branching ratio over the standard model prediction at 6.8(3.6 ) while d0 set a limit at 3.8(4.3 ) for the higgs mass at 125 gev / c@xmath1 .",
    "for the high - mass signatures , we look for higgs decay into ww pair in the inclusive higgs events that lead to many interesting final states  @xcite .",
    "the most sensitive channel is both w decaying leptonic that gives an opposite - signed dilepton pair , large missing et , and some jets from the initial state radiation .",
    "the presence of neutrinos in the final state prevents the precise reconstruction of the higgs boson mass .",
    "we have to rely on the event kinematic that distinguishes signal from background based on the scalar nature of the higgs boson .",
    "we also include the processes @xmath50 and @xmath51 that give rise to like - sign dilepton and trilepton in the final states .",
    "[ fig : dphicdf ] shows the @xmath32 distribution of two opposite - signed leptons in the zero jet bin .",
    "the red line is for the signal , which prefers a smaller @xmath32 than most backgrounds . by combining the @xmath32 with other kinematics",
    "we obtain a multivariate discriminant shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dphicdf ] that improves the analysis significantly .",
    "we set a 95% upper limit on the production cross section times branching ratio over the standard model prediction as a function of the tested higgs mass after combing all @xmath3 channels including the low mass dileptons , the same sign , and trileptons from @xmath17 and @xmath18 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wwlimit ] .",
    "cdf observes some deficit near 165 gev / c@xmath1 while d0 observes a broad excess , but they are consistent with each other .",
    "other searches are also considered for the @xmath25 decay  @xcite , the @xmath24 decay  @xcite , and the @xmath26 production  @xcite .",
    "[ fig : secondsearch ] shows their 95% cl upper limits on the production cross section times branching ratio with respect to the sm prediction , which is about a factor of ten larger than the sm higgs sensitivity .",
    "but they do help to achieve the best higgs sensitivity at the tevatron .",
    "we have searched for all possible sm higgs production and decays . and set limits with respect to nominal sm predictions .",
    "cdf and d0 are in good agreement and we combine them to improve the tevatron final higgs sensitivity .",
    "to check the tevatron higgs sensitivity , we use the log - likelihood ratios ( llr ) with different signal hypotheses to test the expected sensitivity as a function of higgs mass , as shown in fig  [ fig : llr ] .",
    "the black dot is for the background - only hypothesis , the red dot is for signal - plus - background hypothesis , and the solid curve is for the observed data .",
    "the colored bands indicate 1 or 2 sigma width of llr for the background only distribution .",
    "the separation between the background only and the signal + background provides a measure of the search sensitivity , which is about 2 sigma for the higgs boson mass at 125 gev / c@xmath1 .",
    "the data seem consistent with the signal + background hypothesis between 115 and 135 gev / c@xmath1 .",
    "all of the searches for the sm higgs boson at the tevatron are combined together for the best sensitivity  @xcite .",
    "we are able to exclude the higgs mass between @xmath52 and @xmath53 gev / c@xmath1 with comparable expected exclusion @xmath54 and @xmath55 gev / c@xmath1 , as shown in fig  [ fig : tevlimit ] .",
    "there are some excess of events observed in the mass range between 115 and 135 gev / c@xmath1 with a maximum local p - value of 2.7 standard deviations ( sigma ) at @xmath5 = 120 gev / c@xmath1 , where the expected local p - value for a sm higgs signal is 2.0 sigma .",
    "when corrected for the look - elsewhere effect ( lee ) , which accounts for the possibility of selecting the strongest of several random excesses in the range @xmath56 gev / c@xmath1 , the global significance of the excess is 2.2 sigma .",
    "we also combined results for different decay modes to see where the excess comes from .",
    "[ fig : bbwwlimit ] shows the combined limit for @xmath2 and @xmath3 separately .",
    "the observed limit in the @xmath2 channel is more than 2 sigma higher than expected in the mass range between 115 - 135 gev / c@xmath1 , which counts the majority of the excess in the same mass region .    given the excess , we fitted the signal production cross section times branching ratio , normalized to the sm expectation , as a function of higgs mass , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : signalstrength ] .",
    "the obtained signal strength seems consistent with the sm higgs signal in the mass range between 115 and 135 gev / c@xmath1 .    to further check the compatibility with sm higgs signal at @xmath40 gev / c@xmath1",
    ", we compared the llr by injecting the higgs signal of @xmath40 gev / c@xmath1 into the background - only pesudo - experiment ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : injecting ] ) which seems consistent with the llr observed in the data as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : llr ] .",
    "the distribution is quite broad due to the fact that the final discriminant is not optimized for mass , but for the signal and background separation .    finally , it s worth noting that the tevatron has made significant progresses to achieve the sm higgs sensitivity .",
    "the gain obtained over time seems go proportional to the inverse of the extra luminosity used , instead of the square root of the luminosity .",
    "in clusion , with a full dataset and many years of hard work , the tevatron has finally achieved the sm higgs sensitivity over most of the mass range up to 185 gev / c@xmath1 .",
    "we observe an excess of events in the data compared with the background predictions , which is most significant in the mass range between 115 and 135 gev / c@xmath1 , consistent with the higgs - like particle recently observed by atlas and cms .",
    "the largest local significance is 2.7 standard deviations , corresponding to a global significance of 2.2 standard deviations .",
    "we also combine separate searches for @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and find that the excess is concentrated in the @xmath2 channel , although the results in the @xmath3 channel are still consistent with the possible presence of a low - mass higgs boson .",
