    "each is a convex function of the channel .",
    "we further remark that the quantity @xmath79 can be considered as a conditional , or expected , coherent information , as @xmath80 a particular departure of this quantity from its classical analog , the conditional mutual information @xmath81 , is that the latter is only equal to @xmath82 when @xmath49 and @xmath83 are independent , while the former always allows either interpretation , provided the conditioning variable is classical .",

    "the third , strong subspace transmission , is described in section  [ section : sstequiv : sst ] . while not essential for the understanding of our main results , we include it in this paper because the composability properties implied by its more stringent constraints on successful communication make it particularly attractive as a building block for creating more intricate protocols from simpler ones . that each of these aforementioned scenarios can justifiably be considered as  sending quantum information \" to charlie",

    "thus , for any distribution @xmath50 , there is another distribution @xmath798 which puts positive probability on at most @xmath799 states , while satisfying @xmath800 if it is instead the case that @xmath801 this bound can be reduced to @xmath802 by replacing the first components of the map @xmath796 with a parameterization of @xmath803 , as specification of a density matrix on @xmath92 is enough to completely describe the resulting state on @xmath29 .",
