    "mixing angle of bosonic and fermionic multipole operators was introduced so that the mixing characters of the low- lying collective modes were studied as functions of the boson- fermion interaction strength . for an attractive boson- fermion interaction",
    "it was shown that the low - lying monopole mode becomes a coherent oscillation of bosons and fermions and shows a rapid decrease in the excitation energy towards the instability point of the ground state .",
    "in contrast , the quadrupole mode give indications of frequency increasing and it contradicts the behavior of modes in ref . @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite instead it was found that , as the mixture is driven towards collapse instability , the frequencies of the modes of bosonic origin show a softening , which becomes most pronounced in the very proximity of collapse . explicit illustrations of these trends were given for the monopolar spectra .",
    "a comparison of the hydrodynamic spectra @xcite with the spectra calculated on the basis of the effective hamiltonian suggests that eigenvalue equations with the dynamical coupling between the two components yield the similar bosonic mode behavior both as functions of @xmath10 and @xmath42 as the hydrodynamic- type equations with the fermion degree of freedom being integrated out .",
    "softening of the bosonic mode spectrum is a general signature of the dynamics of the bose- fermi mixture with attraction between components arising from peculiar properties of the ground state and instability point near the collapse transition .",
    "we have studied the collective mode frequencies in the boson- fermion mixture . to this purpose",
    "we have used the effective hamiltonian for the bose system , where the fermion degrees of freedom are integrated out @xcite .",
    "the effective hamiltonian incorporates the three- particle elastic collisions induced by the boson- fermion interaction . in terms of coupled eigenvalue density fluctuation equations for the bosonic and fermionic components it means that we exclude fermion fluctuations from the bosonic density fluctuation component resulting in more involved structure of bosonic fluctuations .",
    "this approach enables to account for interparticle interaction strength in collective excitation frequencies and can be considered as an extension of stringari s solution @xcite for bose - fermi mixtures .",
    "the analysis of the mode frequencies as function of the number of boson atoms and the boson- fermion coupling strength yields a dynamical condition for a collapse of the system .",
    "the behavior of mode frequencies is consistent with numerical analysis on the basis of generalized hydrodynamics equations @xcite .",
    "the effective hamiltonian approach proves to be efficient tool for the analysis of both the ground state and dynamical properties of boson- fermion mixtures and can be considered as alternatives to capuzzi s et al .",
    "@xcite approach for analysis boson eigenfrequencies .",
    "we also note that the present study can be extended to take into account finite temperature effect @xcite on the excitations .",
