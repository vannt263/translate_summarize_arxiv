    "similarly , when combined with disk fractions , age measurements place strict constraints on the time available for giant planets to form .",
    "ages are also important in quantifying how the stellar contraction leads to rotational spin - up and changes in interior structure for solar and intermediate mass stars , factors which combine to determine the initial conditions for the evolution of magnetic activity for the duration of the stellar lifetime",
    ". members of young stellar associations are usually dated by comparing their temperatures and luminosities to pre - main sequence tracks .",
    "however , errors and biases in placing stars on hertzsprung - russell ( hr ) diagrams lead to uncertainty in ages of different clusters , while large luminosity spreads among members of individual clusters enhance uncertainty regarding age dating of any individual star ( see review by * ? ? ?",
    "further uncertainties in pre - main sequence age estimates from hr diagrams are traced directly to the varied stellar loci predicted from different stellar evolution models and to the lack of consistency between predicted and observed stellar loci .",
    "these differences have been noted between low and intermediate mass stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "age estimates depend on the considered range in spectral type or stellar mass . @xcite",
    "found that in many regions g stars appears @xmath4 times older than k stars , depending on which pre - main sequence tracks were used .",
    "@xcite quantified these differences by measuring an age for the upper sco ob association of @xmath5 myr , larger than the 5 myr age measured previously from pre - main sequence low mass stars @xcite .",
    "similarly , in both younger and older clusters , analyses of main sequence turnoff and intermediate mass stars in color - magnitude diagrams yield ages that are twice as large as those obtained from low mass pre - main sequence stars @xcite .    nearby stellar associations with ages of 540 myr",
    "provide us with a laboratory to establish empirical isochrones , which can be used as a model - independent clock and as a benchmark for testing pre - main sequence models . within a single association",
    "older than 10 myr , the age spread expected from star formation processes is small compared to the absolute age .",
    "member stars have traveled far from any remnant molecular material associated with their birth cloud and are unaffected by interstellar extinction .",
    "most disks have already dispersed by these ages , so observational uncertainties related to accretion and circumstellar extinction are negligible for the vast majority of stars in this age range . in recent years , the growing number of proper motions and parallax distances have led to a substantial improvement in the accounting of membership within young associations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the hr diagrams of these nearby moving groups should consequently have only a small age spread .    at younger ages , placing stars on hr diagrams is more problematic because accretion and extinction affects temperature and luminosity measurements , and because the affect of any genuine age spread on luminosities decreases ( in dex ) with age .",
    "nevertheless , wide spreads in luminosities of members of young clusters have been interpreted as true age spreads .",
    "for example , in the onc a 1.5 dex luminosity spread ( da rio et al .",
    "2010 ) led reggiani et al .",
    "( 2011 ) to claim an age spread of 1.53.5 myr , although some of this spread may alternately be interpreted as a spread in radius from different accretion histories @xcite",
    ". improved spectral types and extinction measurements of two outliers in the onc sample indicate that the luminosity spread may be overestimated @xcite .",
    "if we consider @xmath6 myr as an approximate age spread , then that would lead to 0.16 dex and 0.08 dex spreads in luminosities of 5 myr old and 20 myr old clusters of single stars ( as assessed for 3500 k stars from the baraffe tracks , see  2.5 ) .",
    "these luminosity spreads are consistent with the 0.05 to 0.15 dex errors in placing young stars in the hr diagram ( see table 1 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this paper , we use literature spectral types and photometry to construct empirical isochrones of luminosity versus temperature of diskless low mass stars in nearby associations and compare them to pre - main sequence isochrones .",
    "this approach is similar to the empirical isochrones derived by @xcite and by @xcite , but is focused exclusively on low mass stars in nearby young associations and moving groups and is motivated by a desire for deriving simple formulations that approximate empirical isochrones in hr diagrams . in  2 , we describe the literature data that is used to place stars on hr diagrams and the pre - main sequence evolutionary tracks used for age estimates . in ",
    "3 we develop empirical isochrones for a set of benchmark young associations . in  4 ,",
    "the empirical isochrones are compared to isochrones predicted from models of pre - main sequence evolution to test evolutionary tracks and to obtain age estimates for the young clusters for each model . in  5 ,",
    "we discuss how the ages from different tracks compare with independent age measurements .",
    "the @xmath2 pic and tuc - hor moving groups and the @xmath1 cha , @xmath0 cha , and tw hya associations are used in this paper as benchmark clusters to measure empirical isochrones of young regions .",
    "the results obtained from these benchmark clusters are then applied to the upper sco ob association .",
    "searches for membership in existing all sky surveys , along with analyses of proper motions and radial velocities , have substantially improved the confidence in membership for these associations . meanwhile , the proliferation of accurate parallax measurements for the nearest groups has significantly reduced the uncertainty in luminosities arising from errors in distance measurements . when combined , these advances allow for a robust analysis of the stellar loci of these clusters .    in some analysis below , the two older associations ( the @xmath2 pic and tuc - hor moving groups ) and the three younger associations ( tw hya , @xmath0 cha , and @xmath1 cha ) are grouped together .",

    "assuming @xmath153 mag , which disagrees with the colors of upper sco stars , would lead to only a 0.07 dex increase in the luminosities .",
    "in this paper , we calculate empirical isochrones in hr diagrams for low mass stars and brown dwarfs in young ( @xmath154 myr ) nearby associations .",
    "the sample consists of stars that have accurate distances , low extinction , and are not affected by the presence of disks or accretion .",
    "the simple formulation of the empirical isochrone assumes that two slopes , one applied to stars with temperatures 3200/34005000 k and one for stars between 28003200/3400 k , applies to the stellar locus of all young associations .",
    "this choice leads to reasonable fits to the five young benchmark clusters and to the stellar and brown dwarf locus of the upper sco ob association .",
    "a successful theory of pre - main sequence evolution should match these empirical fits .",
    "the dartmouth , pisa , and bcah98 - 1.9 pre - main sequence isochrones between 32005500 are consistent with the measured slopes .",
    "the slopes from dm97 , bcah98 , and siess isochrones are steeper than observed , so that very low mass stars will be assessed as younger than solar mass stars .",
    "the parsec isochrones have the opposite behavior , so that solar mass stars are assessed as younger than very low - mass stars . the parsec and bcah98 models typically lead to the oldest ages , while the ages obtained from the dm97 models are anomalously young .",
    "advances in prescriptions for convection and the thermal structure of the atmosphere in the bhac-2015 and feiden models , respectively , have improved the match to empirical stellar loci at @xmath155 k and match the decrease in luminosity at @xmath143 k , though with a temperature offset relative to established spectral type - temperature conversions .    applying the empirical isochrone to associations",
    "provides a statistically robust age ordering , which is independent of spectral type .",
    "our age ordering is based on the 32005000 k region .",
    "the assumption that the 28003200 k isochrones have the same slope for both the young and old associations is likely overly simplistic .",
    "steeper slopes at younger ages , especially for the upper sco ob association , instead indicates some evolution in the brown dwarf locus . because the relationship between luminosity and temperature for brown dwarfs is steep , any use of brown dwarfs in age estimates requires accurate temperatures and should be used with caution .",
    "fitting these isochrones to the six associations discussed in this paper leads to a luminosity / age ordering mostly as expected from previous results , with the upper sco ( @xmath156 , @xmath0 cha ( @xmath157 ) , and @xmath1 cha ( @xmath158 ) , associations roughly co - eval , followed by the tw hya association ( @xmath159 ) and the @xmath2 pic ( @xmath160 and tuc - hor ( @xmath161 ) moving groups .",
    "for any given association , age estimates of different models evaluated at different temperatures span 0.8 dex . as a consequence",
    ", comparisons of ages between different associations should consistently apply a single luminosity - age scaling .",
    "the bhac-2015 and feiden pre - main sequence models yield very similar ages for low - mass stars .",
    "ages can be adopted to be consistent with the li depletion boundary age of the @xmath2 pic moving group , but these models imply a @xmath151 myr age for the upper sco ob assocation for low mass stars , younger than the 11 myr age obtained from intermediate mass and high mass stars stars .",

    "gjh thanks adam kraus for discussions on preparing the paper and jessy jose for valuable comments on the paper .",

    "filter curves and zero points are obtained from the virtual observatory filter profile service@xmath162 .",

    ", the model fluxes at the corresponding wavelength are corrected to reproduce the observed colors .",
    "the j - band flux is always kept constant , so all corrections are relative to the j - band .",
    "the bolometric corrections are then calculated from the synthetic j - band photometry and the integrated emission in the full model spectrum .",

    "the zero point for @xmath163 ( @xmath166 erg @xmath167 s@xmath168 ) and the assumed @xmath169 erg @xmath167 s@xmath168 are obtained from the 1999 iau zero point scale , as discussed at the webpage of eric mamajek listing basic astronomical data for the sun@xmath170 ."
