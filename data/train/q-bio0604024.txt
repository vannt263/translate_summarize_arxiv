    "the need for comparing phylogenetic trees arises when alternative phylogenies are obtained using different phylogenetic methods or different gene sequences for a given set of species .",
    "the comparison of phylogenetic trees is also essential to performing phylogenetic queries on databases of phylogenetic trees  @xcite .",
    "further , the need for comparing phylogenetic trees also arises in the comparative analysis of clustering results obtained using different clustering methods or even different distance matrices , and there is a growing interest in the assessment of clustering results in bioinformatics  @xcite .",
    "a number of metrics for phylogenetic tree comparison are known , including the partition ( or symmetric difference ) metric  @xcite , the nearest - neighbor interchange metric  @xcite , the subtree transfer distance  @xcite , the metric from the crossover method  @xcite , the quartet metric  @xcite , the metric from the nodal distance algorithm  @xcite .",
    "one of the simplest and easiest to compute metrics proposed so far , the transposition distance  @xcite , is only defined for fully resolved trees . but phylogenetic analyses often produce phylogenies with polytomies , that is , phylogenetic trees that are not fully resolved . as a matter of fact , at the time of this writing , more than a 66.5% of the phylogenies contained in treebase have polytomies .    in this paper , we generalize to arbitrary phylogenetic trees this transposition distance , through a new definition of it .",
    "this new distance is directly inspired on the one hand by the matching representation of phylogenetic trees  @xcite and on the other hand by the _ involution metric _ for rna contact structures  @xcite .",
    "the matching representation @xmath0 of a phylogenetic tree @xmath1 with @xmath2 leaves labeled @xmath3 describes @xmath4 injectively as a partition of @xmath5 .",
    "if @xmath4 is fully resolved , which is the particular case considered in  @xcite , then all members of this partition are 2-elements sets , and then , since @xmath6 , it defines an undirected 1-regular graph @xmath7 .",
    "reidys and stadler defined the _ involution metric _ on 1-regular graphs , by associating to each such a graph the permutation given by the product of the transpositions corresponding to its edges , and then using the _ canonical metric _ in the symmetric group @xmath8 ( the least number of transpositions necessary to transform one permutation into another ) to compare these permutations .",
    "the translation of this metric to matching representations yields twice the matching distance defined in  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , no meaningful generalization to arbitrary graphs of reidys and stadler s metric is known , the main drawback being the difficulty of associating injectively a well - defined permutation to an arbitrary graph .",
    "now , if @xmath4 is not fully resolved , the members of @xmath0 are no longer pairs of numbers , and therefore they do not define a graph , at least not directly . actually , the approach that we take in this paper can be understood as if we represented each member @xmath9 of @xmath0 , with @xmath10 , as a cyclic directed graph with arcs @xmath11 , and @xmath0 as the sum of these cyclic graphs .",
    "now , generalizing reidys - stadler s approach , we associate to every such a cyclic directed graph the cyclic permutation @xmath12 ( if @xmath13 , it is a transposition ) , and we describe @xmath0 by means of the product of the cyclic permutations associated to its members : since these members are disjoint to each other , this product is well - defined .",
    "this defines an embedding of the set of phylogenetic trees with @xmath2 leaves labeled @xmath3 into the symmetric group @xmath8 .",
    "the transposition distance is obtained by translating the canonical metric on @xmath8 into a distance for phylogenetic trees through this embedding .",
    "this transposition distance measures the least number of certain simple operations ( splitting sets of children , joining sets of children , interchanging children ) that are necessary to transform one tree into another , and it can be easily computed in linear time .",
    "therefore it satisfies the requirements of `` computational simplicity '' and `` good theoretical basis '' that are required to any distance notion on phylogenetic trees @xcite .",
    "throughout this paper , by a _",
    "phylogenetic tree _ we mean a _ rooted tree with injectively labeled leaves and without outdegree 1 nodes_. thus , a phylogenetic tree is a directed finite graph @xmath1 containing a distinguished node @xmath14 , called the _ root _",
    ", such that for every other node @xmath15 there exists one , and only one , path from the root @xmath16 to @xmath17 .",
    "the _ children _ of a node @xmath17 in a tree @xmath1 are those nodes @xmath18 such that @xmath19 .",
    "the _ outdegree _ of a node is the number of its children .",
    "the nodes without children are the _ leaves _ of the tree , and the remaining nodes are called _ internal _ : since we assume that no node has outdegree 1 , every internal node has at least 2 children .",
    "the set of leaves of @xmath4 is denoted by @xmath20 .",
    "height _ of a node @xmath17 in a tree @xmath4 is the length of a longest directed path from @xmath17 to a leaf .",
    "thus , the nodes with height 0 are the leaves , the nodes with height 1 are the nodes all whose children are leaves , and so on .    the leaves of a phylogenetic tree are injectively labeled in a fixed , but arbitrary , ordered set : these labels are called _",
    "taxa_. in practice , if the tree has @xmath2 leaves , we shall identify their labels with @xmath3 , ordered in the usual increasing way .",
    "the label associated to a leaf @xmath15 will be denoted by @xmath21 .",
    "we shall denote by @xmath22 the set of all phylogenetic trees with @xmath2 leaves labeled @xmath3 ( up to label - preserving isomorphisms of rooted trees ) .",
    "the _ bottom - up ordering _ ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) of a phylogenetic tree @xmath23 is the injective mapping @xmath24 defined by the following properties :    1 .   if @xmath25 , then @xmath21 is its label .",
    "2 .   if @xmath26 , then @xmath27 .",
    "3 .   if @xmath28 and @xmath29 then @xmath27 .",
    "it is straightforward to notice that this bottom - up ordering is unique , and it can be computed in time linear in the size of the tree by bottom - up tree traversal techniques  @xcite .",
    "first , the leaves of @xmath4 are labeled by their label in @xmath30 .",
    "then , the height 1 nodes are labeled from @xmath31 on in the order given by the smallest label of their children : i.e. , the height 1 node with the smallest child label is assigned label @xmath31 , the height 1 node with the next - smallest child label is assigned label @xmath32 , etc . and",

    "<S> the search for similarity and dissimilarity measures on phylogenetic trees has been motivated by the computation of consensus trees , the search by similarity in phylogenetic databases , and the assessment of clustering results in bioinformatics . </S>",
    "<S> the transposition distance for fully resolved phylogenetic trees is a recent addition to the extensive collection of available metrics for comparing phylogenetic trees . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we generalize the transposition distance from fully resolved to arbitrary phylogenetic trees , through a construction that involves an embedding of the set of phylogenetic trees with a fixed number of labeled leaves into a symmetric group and a generalization of reidys - stadler s involution metric for rna contact structures . </S>",
    "<S> we also present simple linear - time algorithms for computing it . </S>"
