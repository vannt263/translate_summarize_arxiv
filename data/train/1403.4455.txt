    "hadrons are the bound states of the strong interaction which is described by the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) in the framework of yang - mills gauge theory",
    ". one of the main goals of the hadron physics is to understand the composition of hadrons in terms of quarks and gluons .",
    "the quark model is proved successful in classifying the mesons and baryons as @xmath5 and @xmath6 composite systems .",
    "almost all the well established mesons can be described as a quark - antiquark state except some mesons with exotic quantum numbers which are impossible for a @xmath5 system , but no experimental evidence is reported for exotic baryons which are inconsistent with the @xmath6 configuration until the beginning of this century .",
    "theoretically , the qcd does not forbid the existence of the hadrons with the other configurations , such as the glueballs , the hybrids and the multiquarks . in this review ,",
    "we focus on the pentaquarks .",
    "if the pentaquark really exists , it will provide a new stage to test the qcd in the nonperturbative region and to investigate the properties of the strong interaction .    in the quark model language ,",
    "the pentaquark is a hadron state with four valence quarks and one valence antiquark as @xmath7  @xcite . because the pentaquark can decay to a three - quark baryon and a quark - antiquark meson , its width was suggested to be wide  @xcite , but it was predicted to have a narrow width due to its particular quark structure  @xcite . in principle , any baryon may have the five - quark contents , and experiments have revealed the important role of the intrinsic sea quarks in understanding the structure of the proton . on the other hand",
    ", the pentaquark state may also mix with the corresponding three - quark state or hybrid state , so the situation is much more complicated .",
    "the pentaquark is easier to be identified if it has no admixture with any three - quark state , i.e. , if the flavor of the anti - quark @xmath8 in the @xmath7 state is different from any of the other four quarks  @xcite .",
    "early experiments in 1960 s and 1970 s were performed to search for a baryon with positive strangeness as the pentaquark candidate referred to as the @xmath9  @xcite , but no enhancements were found .",
    "this field developed rapidly on both the experimental and the theoretical aspects in the last decade since the first report for a positive strangeness pentaquark - like baryon , referred to as the @xmath0 , by the leps collaboration  @xcite .",
    "its mass and width are closed to the prediction of the chiral soliton model  @xcite .",
    "this particle was quickly reported in subsequent experiments by some groups , and many theoretical models were applied to understanding this particle and to predicting other pentaquarks , such as the diquark cluster model  @xcite , the diquark - triquark model  @xcite , the constituent quark model  @xcite , the chiral quark model  @xcite , the bag model  @xcite , the meson - baryon binding  @xcite , the qcd sum rules  @xcite , the lattice qcd  @xcite and the chiral soliton model in new versions  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , many experiments found no signals for this particle .",
    "what is worse , the signals observed in the early experiments by some groups disappeared when including the new data with high statistics . however , some groups reconfirmed their observations for this particle with very high statistical significance in their updated experiments .",
    "so even the existence of the pentaquark is a mystery .",
    "the production mechanism and the analysis method should be investigated in details .",
    "recently , a charged charmonium - like meson @xmath10 was observed by bes  @xcite and belle  @xcite .",
    "it is a suggestive evidence for the existence of the multiquark meson .",
    "this arouses much interest on the study of the multiquark states . in this paper , we review the experimental search for the pentaquark states . in sect .",
    "ii and iii , we concentrate on the searches for the @xmath0 with positive or negative results . in sect .",
    "iv , we focus on a non - strange pentaquark candidate . in sect .",
    "v , the other observed pentaquark candidates are presented .",
    "then we discuss the results in sect .",
    "vi and a brief summary is contained in the last section .",
    "the pentaquark candidate @xmath0 was widely discussed and searched for since the first report on the experimental observation by the leps collaboration  @xcite .",
    "the skyrme s idea that baryons are solitons  @xcite arouses interesting , and the soliton picture consists with the qcd in the large @xmath11 limit  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 , if exists , is the lightest member in the predicted antidecuplet  @xcite . its mass and width were predicted in the chiral soliton model  @xcite .    in quark model language ,",
    "the @xmath0 is described as a pentaquark state @xmath12 . unlike the other pentaquark @xmath7 states that the antiquark may have the same flavor with at least one quark , the lowest fock state of the @xmath0 composes of five quarks with the anti - quark being @xmath13 , which is of different flavor from the other four @xmath14 quarks .",
    "therefore it is easy to be identified from other ordinary baryons with minimal @xmath15 configurations  @xcite . for the pentaquark",
    "states that the antiquark has the same flavor of some quark , the mixing of the pentaquark state and the corresponding three - quark state and hybrid state makes the situation complicated , because any three - quark baryon may have five - quark components from both perturbative and nonperturbative aspects , such as the baryon - meson fluctuation picture  @xcite and the light - cone fock state expansion  @xcite .",
    "since the @xmath0 has the same quark constituents as the combination of @xmath16 and @xmath17 , these two modes are expected as the primary decay channel , and thus are usually used in reconstructions in the experiments .    after the first report for the @xmath0 , the signals were observed by many groups  @xcite , and some groups confirmed their results with new data  @xcite .",
    "all these results are briefly listed in table [ thetay ] .",
    "negative results were also reported by many groups , and some early positive results in the photoproduction experiment by clas  @xcite and in the proton - proton collision by cosy - tof  @xcite were rejected by their high - statistics experiments later  @xcite . those are discussed in the next section .",
    ".experiments with positive signals for the @xmath0 . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,>\",options=\"header \" , ]      the @xmath3 baryon , if exists , is the lightest charmed pentaquark state like the @xmath0 but the @xmath13 quark replaced with the @xmath18 quark .",
    "its lowest fock state is @xmath19 which has the same constituent quarks with the combination of @xmath20 or @xmath21 .",
    "thus these are estimated as the dominant decay channels .",
    "the signal for the @xmath3 was only observed in the dis experiment by the h1 collaboration  @xcite .",
    "the analysis was based on the data at hera in 1996 - 2000 .",
    "the @xmath22 was reconstructed via the decay channal @xmath23 . in the distribution of @xmath24 with opposite - charge combinations ,",
    "a peak was observed at @xmath25 mev/@xmath26 with a gaussian width of @xmath27 mev/@xmath26 .",
    "the background was estimated from the monte carlo simulation .",
    "the number of the signal events is @xmath28 , corresponding to a statistical significance of 5.4@xmath29 .",
    "however this resonance was not observed in any other experiment as listed in the table [ thetac ] .",
    "the @xmath30 baryon , if exists , is a double strangeness @xmath31 pentaquark candidate , having the lowest fock state @xmath32 .",
    "it is recognized as an isospin quartet together with its partners @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the primary decay channel of @xmath2 is estimated to be @xmath36 .",
    "the signal for the @xmath2 was only reported by the na49 collaboration at cern  @xcite .",
    "the analysis was base on the data of 158 gev/@xmath37 proton beam colliding with the lh@xmath38 target .",
    "the @xmath39 was reconstructed via the decay channel @xmath40 . then 1640 @xmath39 and 551 @xmath41 were selected .",
    "a peak was observed in the @xmath36 mass spectrum .",
    "combined with the @xmath42 data as the antiparticle , the fitted peak is at @xmath43 mev/@xmath26 with 69 signals over the background of 75 events corresponding to a statistical significance of 5.8@xmath29 estimated as @xmath44 .",
    "one of its isospin partners @xmath45 was also observed , and the fitted mass is @xmath46 mev/@xmath26 . unfortunately this resonance was not observed in any other experiment as listed in the table [ xi1860 ] .",
    "among all the experiments in which the @xmath0 was observed , the width was claimed to be narrow . however , the mass position of the signals in different experiments spreads in a large region from 1520 to 1560 mev/@xmath26 as shown in fig . [ mass ] .",
    "this does not consist with a narrow resonance .",
    "the mass values in leps early experiment  @xcite , diana experiments  @xcite , saphir experiment  @xcite and jinr experiments  @xcite are around 1540 mev/@xmath26 , while the values in hermes experiment  @xcite , svd early experiment  @xcite , itep s analysis on the old neutrino experiments  @xcite and e522 experiment  @xcite are near 1530 mev/@xmath26 . besides , the leps recent experiment  @xcite , the svd updated experiment  @xcite and the zeus experiment  @xcite provide even lower mass values close to 1520 mev/@xmath26 , and the obelix experiment gives a much higher value .",
    "therefore , it is possible that even the observed signals do not correspond to the same particle .",
    "the width of the @xmath0 are not measured as accurate as the mass , and thus the values in almost all the experiments are consistent as shown in fig .",
    "[ width ] .",
    "mass values for the @xmath0 observed in various experiments .",
    "the error bars represent the statistical uncertainties.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    width values for the @xmath0 measured in various experiments .",
    "the error bars represent the statistical uncertainties .",
    "the experiments with only the upper limit on the width are listed in the table [ thetay ] .",
    "the dashed line is the upper limit of the intrinsic width of @xmath0 at 90% c.l . by belle  @xcite.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    the statistical significance of the signals was usually estimated as @xmath47 in the early experiments .",
    "this estimator neglects the uncertainty of the background , and thus the significance may be overestimated .",
    "the estimator @xmath44 which assumes a smooth background with a well defined shape and @xmath48 which assumes a statistical independent background with uncertainties are more proper since the production mechanism is still unknown .",
    "if so , the significance of the signals in the svd updated analysis  @xcite reduces to 5.6@xmath29 and @xmath49 estimated as @xmath48 for the two samples respectively , but is still large enough as an evidence . in this case",
    ", however , the hermes result decreases to 2.7 - 3.9@xmath29 , the jinr @xmath50 result decreases to 4.1@xmath29 and the jinr @xmath51 result decreases to 3.5@xmath29 .",
    "these are not enough to be claimed as an evidence .",
    "besides , the log - likelihood difference is also a suitable alternative and was used by the leps  @xcite and the diana  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath52 produced in the inclusive experiments may affect the result of the @xmath0 reconstructed via the @xmath53 mode .",
    "as pointed out by m. zavertyaev  @xcite , the decay @xmath54 could lead to a spurious sharp peak at 1540 mev/@xmath26 when the momentum of the @xmath52 is greater than 2 gev/@xmath37 . on the other hand",
    ", the @xmath55 decays of the @xmath52s could enhance the background when the @xmath56 or the proton was paired with a @xmath57 or a @xmath58 .    up to now",
    ", no positive result is reported for the @xmath0 production in the @xmath59 experiments .",
    "a possible way to understand these null results with no contradict with the positive ones is to assume that the @xmath0 production cross section is highly suppressed in @xmath59 annihilations . using the quark constituent counting rules , a.i .",
    "titov et al .",
    "estimated the ratio of @xmath0 to @xmath60 production in the fragmentation region and showed the ratio decreases very fast with energy  @xcite .",
    "this ratio is often applied to estimate the yield of the @xmath0 , because @xmath60 is a narrow resonance with similar mass to the @xmath0 and is easily reconstructed .",
    "the low value of this ratio implies a very different production mechanism for @xmath0 if it really exists .    for the dis experiments performed at hera  @xcite , the zeus and the h1 provided opposite conclusions .",
    "these two experiments were almost in the same conditions and with the data collected during the same period , but even using the same cuts the h1 could not produce the @xmath0 signal observed by the zeus .",
    "it is very confused , and probably the signal observed by the zeus is a statistical fluctuation .    for the photoproduction experiments ,",
    "there is a contradiction in the @xmath61 experiments between the upper limit on the cross section given by the clas  @xcite and the result reported by the saphir  @xcite and a contradiction in the @xmath62 experiments between the upper limit on the cross section given by the clas  @xcite and the result reported by the leps  @xcite . as claimed by the leps ,",
    "the contradiction between the leps and clas results is due to the different measurements .",
    "if the @xmath0 is preferably produced at the forward angles , the clas would possibly not detect the @xmath63 meson associated with the @xmath0 , because the most forward angle for the @xmath63 detection is about @xmath64 for the clas while most acceptance is of forward @xmath64 for the leps  @xcite .",
    "it may be a similar case for the contradiction between the clas and the saphir .",
    "if this is true , it will be a suggestion on the angular distribution for the @xmath0 production .",
    "in the experiments at higher energy the @xmath0 productions will be boosted to a much more forward direction and thus escape the coverage of the detectors in most high energy experiments .",
    "this may be a possible explanation for the null results in most high energy experiments .",
    "in the improved analysis by the diana  @xcite , a very narrow intrinsic width for the @xmath0 was estimated as @xmath65 mev/@xmath26 .",
    "this result passed the upper limits given by the belle  @xcite , the e559  @xcite and the j - parc  @xcite .",
    "therefore there is no contradiction between these experiments , although opposite conclusions were reported for the existence of the @xmath0 .    among all the experimental search for the @xmath0 pentaquark candidate ,",
    "those with negative results have higher statistics and are consequently more reliable in usual , but it is hard to prove that all the observed peaks are fakes or fluctuations .",
    "especially , the updated results by the leps  @xcite , the diana  @xcite and the svd  @xcite can be claimed as strong evidence for the @xmath0 .",
    "so the existence of the @xmath0 is still debatable .",
    "for the other pentaquark candidates such as @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , the signals are much less reliable since none of them is confirmed in any other experiment .",
    "we reviewed the experimental search for the pentaquark states during the last decade .",
    "both the most widely studied candidate @xmath0 and the other candidates like @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 as well as the non - strange pentaquark candidates are included .",
    "since the first observation of the pentaquark - like baryon state @xmath0 , this field has aroused much interest , but even the existence of the pentaquark is debatable up to now .    if the pentaquark really exists , it will open a new world of the qcd and hadron physics .",
    "in particular , if the @xmath0 exists , its production mechanism is almost unknown and needs to be investigate , whether it is a pentaquark or not . besides it will imply the existence of a flavor multiplet .",
    "if the pentaquark does not exist , the peaks observed in the experiments with positive results need a reasonable explanation . in addition",
    ", the contradictions between the experiments should be examined in details .",
    "this will improve the analysis method and raise the reliability of the result in future experiments .",
    "in order to confirm or rule out the existence of the pentaquark , particularly the @xmath0 , comparisons between experiments in similar conditions are required . among the experiments , the updated results by the leps  @xcite , the diana  @xcite and the svd  @xcite provide the best positive evidence for the @xmath0 .",
    "therefore more experiments at medium energy may lead to a clear conclusion .",
