    "<S> this value agrees with the coupled channels analysis prediction of @xmath39 g ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : scatteringlength](a ) ) within less than 1@xmath40 of the experimental error and suits , even better , the position derived in the most recent coupled channels analysis of collisions in both isotopes of lithium atoms in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the minimum in the elastic collisional cross section is shifted from the scattering length s zero - crossing position due to the energy dependence of @xmath29 . for comparison , </S>",

    "<S> , weak dependence of @xmath1 on @xmath24 in this region allows for a significant tolerance in the uncertainty of the zero - crossing position . from the point of view of the present study , this is also indicated by a very weak magnetic field dependence of the three - body effective length @xmath41 ( explained later ) around @xmath26 g ( see  fig.[fig : scatteringlength](b ) ) .    </S>",
    "<S> next , we consider the three - body inelastic processes ; however , first it is worth noting that the @xmath42 state is not the absolute ground state of the system , and thus , two - body inelastic dipole - dipole relaxation is allowed . however , as shown in ref .  </S>",

    "<S> the three - body recombination loss rate coefficient @xmath50 is extracted from the fit of atom number decay measurements with the solution to the three - body loss rate differential equation : @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the single - body loss rate coefficient due to residual collisions with thermal atoms in vacuum  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> three - body recombination is known to be accompanied by heating and @xmath50 should be extracted from a set of two coupled rate equations : atom number and temperature time evolutions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the regime of @xmath53 , even with this precaution @xmath50 usually deviates from the overall @xmath54 scaling by a constant factor . excluding log - periodic oscillations of @xmath50 due to efimov physics  </S>",
    "<S> , the deviation can be attributed mainly to the systematic uncertainties in the atom number calibration  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an elegant method to calibrate atom number is based on the equation of state measurements recently used to characterize the unitary regime where @xmath55  @xcite . here , to calibrate our data we use the amplitude factor for @xmath50 previously determined in our system in the universal regime  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> a good agreement between these factors hints at their correct interpretation as being dominated by the experimental uncertainties in the atom number calibration . </S>",

    "<S> for @xmath56 the three - body recombination loss rate coefficient is commonly represented as @xmath57 . </S>",
