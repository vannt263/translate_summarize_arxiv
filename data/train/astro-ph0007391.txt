    "oh masers were the first to be discovered as a new class of astronomical phenomenona exhibiting intense , narrow band , polarized , variable emission in interstellar molecular transitions  @xcite .",
    "the source of this emission was shown to be small , compact clumps of neutral gas , at the periphery of compact regions created by newly born massive o - stars .",
    "another class of oh masers is related to evoled low- and medium - mass stars , and is not considered here .",
    "high angular resolution study of oh masers showed that they consist of a number of bright compact maser spots separated by several arcseconds .",
    "the spots themselves are from 2 to 70 milliarcseconds in extent , and in some masers are barely resolved , even with the highest angular resolution available from ground based vlbi arrays  @xcite .",
    "the goal of the high angular resolution study of oh masers is to determine relative position of the spots , to measure the intensity , and to map the spots .",
    "determination of the size and the shape of the maser spots would be very helpful for understanding the maser emission mechanism and its limiting brightness temperature .",
    "the shape of the maser spots may be indicative of the type of physical phenomena responsible for the origin of the maser emission .",
    "several possible sites for the origin of maser emission ; such as the shocks at the border of regions , or the interaction region between a molecular outflow and ambient molecular clouds , as well as protoplanetary accretion disks around young star , have been suggested .",
    "the maser spot shape and size are important properties of the maser emission , provided they are intrinsic to the source , and not caused by a propagation effect such as interstellar scattering .",
    "there is a widespread opinion that oh masers are heavily scattered by interstellar turbulence , and that observed images of maser spots are scattering broadened images of essentially point - like sources .",
    "this view is based on data obtained from the study of scattering of pulsars and continuum sources .",
    "the importance of scattering for oh masers is due to their location within the thin galactic disk where the scattering is most severe .",
    "the first observational evidence for the scattering of oh masers obtained by direct vlbi measurements came from kemball , diamond and mantovani  .",
    "they measured the size of the strongest spectral features in 16 galactic masers using a single - baseline interferometer with a fringe spacing of 5 milliarcsec .",
    "only three masers out of 16 observed have shown compact details , less than 2.5 milliarcsec in size . the rest of the masers were completely resolved implying angular size larger than 5 milliarcsec .",
    "kemball et al .   concluded that their results were consistent with the interstellar scattering angle of about 20 milliarcsec derived from pulsar scattering data , and with the clumpy distribution of electron density fluctuations which are responsible for the large spread of measured angular sizes .",
    "hansen et al .   made a vlbi survey of interstellar broadening of 20 galactic oh masers , using a 7-station vlbi array .",
    "they found a large range of angular sizes from 0.8@xmath20.5  milliarcsec to 74@xmath27  milliarcsec in their sample of oh masers .",
    "they fitted the angular size @xmath3 versus distance @xmath4 dependence by a relation @xmath5 which is close to the expected scaling with distance for homogeneous turbulence with a kolmogorov power law spectrum .",
    "they concluded that the measured sizes result from interstellar scattering which is strongly non - uniform .    among the oh masers measured in these vlbi experiments , several are unresolved to the limit of angular resolution .",
    "slysh et al .",
    "used a 3-station vlbi network to measure the angular size of three such compact oh masers . with a fringe separation of 4.2  milliarcsec and high signal to noise ratio data the angular size of several spectral features in the two main line",
    "oh transitions were measured simultaneously .",
    "the measured angular size was in the range from 1.4@xmath20.4  milliarcsec to 4.3@xmath20.1  milliarcsec .",
    "it was found that the angular size of the spectral features with the same radial velocity , presumably originating in the same region , was larger in the 1667  mhz line than in the 1665  mhz line .",
    "this can not be the result of scattering , since the scattering size should be virtually the same at these two close frequencies ( the scaling between 1665  mhz and 1667  mhz is negligible ! ) .",
    "it was concluded that the measured angular size at 1667  mhz 4.3@xmath20.1  milliarcsec for oh34.26@xmath00.15 and 3.5@xmath20.2  milliarcsec for w48 is intrinsic to the sources .",
    "these two masers together with oh45.47 + 0.13 exhibit an angular size for spectral features which is much less than the average broadening estimated from pulsar measurements .",
    "the conclusion of that study was that the distribution of the scattering material in the galaxy is patchy , and that these three masers are located in a direction of low interstellar scattering .",
    "for this reason these masers were selected for space - vlbi measurements using the japanese satellite _ halca _ and a ground telescope array . in this paper",
    "we report the first results of the space - vlbi observations of oh maser oh34.26@xmath00.15 .",
    "the maser source oh34.26@xmath00.15 was observed as a part of the key science program of the japanese satellite _ halca _ on march 24 - 25 , 1998 , by the space - ground very long baseline interferometer .",
    "the satellite radio telescope has an 8-m diameter deployable parabolic mirror and uncooled l - band receiver , orbiting the earth with a 6 hour period , apogee 21000  km and perigee 560  km  @xcite .",
    "the ground radio telescope array in this particular session included the 70-m dsn telescope tidbinbilla in australia ( tid ) , the phased 6@xmath622 m australia telescope ( at ) , the 22-m mopra telescope in australia ( mop ) , the shanghai 25-m telescope in china ( sh ) , the 64-m telescope in usuda japan ( usu ) , and the 64-m telescope in bear lakes ( bl ) near moscow ( russia ) .",

    "the data were correlated using the canadian s2 space - vlbi correlator @xcite .",
    "the 16 mhz data were filtered using a fir bandpass filter and then re - sampled before correlation in order to attain a spectral resolution of 488 hz  channel@xmath8 ( 0.088  km  s@xmath8 ) over a bandpass of 500 khz .",
    "amplitude calibration was achieved using the `` gain '' and t@xmath7 data ( table  [ antennas ] ) obtained from ground observatories and from the vsop operations group .",

    "[ cols=\"<,^ , > , > \" , ]     phase jitter was discovered at the bear lakes telescope which caused splitting of the fringe spectrum into several components .",
    "it was found that the phase of the bear lakes telescope receiver experienced quasi - periodical excursions with a period of about 200 seconds .",
    "the phase jitter was removed by means of phase self - calibration of the ground array with a short solution interval of 30 seconds , which is less than the instrumental , tropospheric and ionospheric phase variation period .",
    "the multiple spectral components disappeared , and the central peak increased by a factor of two .",
    "the strongest and most compact spectral feature at the radial velocity 56  km  s@xmath8 in the 1665  mhz spectrum was taken as a reference in the self - calibration process .",
    "its position relative to the correlating position was determined by the fringe rate method , using the ground array .",
    "the measured offset is 023 in right ascension and 14 in declination , with an accuracy of 01 , and our best position for this feature is @xmath9 , @xmath10 ( j2000.0 ) .",
    "the position of the reference feature a determined here differs from the measured with the vla by gaume & mutel   by about 015 in both coordinates , which is within the combined error limits of the two measurements . after applying this correction the residual fringe rate an all base lines including those to _",
    "halca _ was found to be close to zero , and the phase variations became slow enough to allow integration time up to 5 minutes .",
    "the delay errors for the ground array telescopes were measured to be less than 300 nanoseconds from observation of the continuum calibration source 1730@xmath11130 , which was observed during the time interval when _ halca _ was not observing . the maximum residual delay associated with the baselines to _ halca _ obtained during correlation of the experiment using the penticton correlator , which assumed an accurate _ halca _ orbit and other known apriori information , was less than 300 nanoseconds at both 1665  mhz and 1667  mhz .",
    "thus , any additional delay errors after correlation are unlikely to be larger than 300 nanoseconds which will produce a negligable phase difference over the 5.3  km  s@xmath8 spread across maser lines .",
    "the relative positions of the 1665  mhz line maser spots with respect to feature a were determined in two steps .",
    "first , an approximate position relative to the reference feature was measured by the fringe rate method with the ground array .",
    "these measurements provided positions with an accuracy of about 50 milliarcseconds , with relative displacements of the features reaching 2000 milliarcseconds",
    ". then maps of the separate features were constructed centered on these approximate positions , with the ground only or space - ground array when the signal to noise ratio was large enough .",
    "the features mapped by the space - ground array are marked by stars in table  [ features ] .",
    "the imaging and cleaning were done with the aips task `` imagr '' , and the features were analyzed with the aips task `` sad '' from which the flux density , position and deconvolved size ( or size limit ) were obtained for each feature .",
    "the relative positional accuracy is about 1 milliarcsecond .",
    "result of this analysis is given in table  [ features ] , where for each gaussian component are given : radial velocity , relative position , flux density , angular size of the major and minor axis of deconvolved gaussian components as well as position angle of the major axis .",
    "the 1667  mhz oh line data were reduced in the following manner .",
    "the 58.70  km  s@xmath8 feature in f is the strongest feature and that was used as the phase reference .",
    "images of the other features in f and feature e ( after using fringe - rate mapping to determine its approximate position ) , were then made by imaging and cleaning as for the 1665  mhz line . in order to tie the 1665  mhz and 1667  mhz images to one coordinate system , we assumed that feature e at 1667  mhz was at the position ( @xmath111350,@xmath113530 ) milliarcseconds displaced from feature a at 1665  mhz , following gaume & mutel  .",
    "this registration should be accurate to about 50 milliarcseconds .",

    "it is evident from fig .",

    "if the signal to noise ratio were increased by a factor of 3 it would be possible to implement full angular resolution imaging .",
    "the main cause of the low signal to noise ratio is the small size of the space radio telescope .",
    "an increase in the signal to noise ratio by a factor of three would require an increase in the space telescope diameter by the same factor , or a combination of larger diameter and lower system noise temperature .",
    "the upper limit of the angular size of feature a cited above corresponds to the lower limit of its brightness temperature of 6@xmath20  k. other features have somewhat larger sizes and lower brightness temperature limits , although it can not be excluded that they consist of several unresolved subcomponents .",

    "for example a model by pavlakis & kylafis   predicts brightness temperatures about @xmath21  k , or at least an order of magnitude lower than observed . on the other hand",
    "there is an absolute upper bound to the brightness temperature imposed by the stimulated transition line broadening ( or resonant stark effect  @xcite ) . the stimulated emission rate @xmath22 is @xmath23 where @xmath24 is maser emission solid angle",
    ", @xmath25 is the spontaneous emission rate ( @xmath26  s@xmath8 for 1665  mhz oh transition ) , and @xmath27 is the brightness temperature in units of 10@xmath28  k. for feature a the stimulated emission rate @xmath29  s@xmath8 , and is comparable to the observed line width which is 0.33  km  s@xmath8 , or 1.6@xmath30  hz . for an isotropic maser @xmath31 , and the contribution of the stimulated emission to the line width is @xmath32  hz , or about a half of the linewidth .",
    "this means that the brightness temperature can not be much higher than the observed upper limit @xmath1  k , unless the maser emission is highly directed .",
    "for example , if @xmath33 , the brightness temperature can be as high as @xmath34  k. since the maser lines do not show any measurable broadening the maser is probably anisotropic .",
    "elongated shapes of oh masers features are also seen in other sources .",
    "baudry & diamond   found a filamentary and arc - like structure in the oh maser w3(oh ) at 13.44  ghz .",
    "they relate this structure to a shocked environment of the ultra - compact region .",
    "one can also speculate that the elongated filaments were formed as a result of an anisotropic compression of the molecular gas into dense condensations in the presence of the magnetic field which is observed in oh masers through zeeman splitting and polarization of emission lines .",
    "oh masers connected with regions of formation of massive stars are located in the plane of the galaxy , and are subject to strong interstellar scattering . as a result of scattering",
    ", the image of small sources is broadened to an extent that depends on the level of turbulence that produces scattering electron density inhomogeneities .",
    "the observed small angular size of maser spots in oh34.26@xmath00.15 puts a strong upper limit on the turbulence level which is usually characterized by a constant @xmath35 in the turbulent electron density power spectrum .",
    "the scatter - broadened angular size is related to the so - called scattering measure @xmath36 where the integral is over distance @xmath37 up to the source at distance @xmath38 . for galactic sources the scattered angular diameter @xmath39 and @xmath40",
    "are related by the expression  @xcite @xmath41 if the measured upper limit of the size of the minor axis of component a of 0.5  milliarcsec is due to scattering , and @xmath42  ghz , then from equation  ( [ thetas ] ) one has @xmath43 at a distance of 3.8  kpc this gives @xmath44 .",
    "this is almost an order of magnitude less than the average found from pulsar scattering measurements , where @xmath45 ( fig .  13 in cordes , weisberg & boriakoff 1985 ) .",
    "this means that scattering towards oh34.26@xmath00.15 is much less than the average in the galaxy .",
    "there exist measurements for interstellar scattering from a nearby extragalactic source 1849 + 005 , which is only 076 from oh34.26@xmath00.15  @xcite .",
    "for this source the angular size measured at the frequency 1465  mhz is 560  milliarcsec .",
    "scattering was found to scale with frequency as @xmath46 in the range from 333  mhz to 4860  mhz . from pulse broadening , frail & clifton   estimated the angular size of a highly scattered pulsar psr  1849@xmath000 ( which is within 10@xmath18 of 1849@xmath0005 ) as 500  milliarcsec at 1  ghz .",
    "if both values are scaled to the oh - line frequency of 1665  mhz , one has 450  milliarcsec from 1849 + 005 and 216  milliarcsec from the pulsar .",
    "these are two to three orders of magnitude larger than the size of the maser spots in oh34.26@xmath00.15 .",
    "we note that 1849@xmath0005 is an extragalactic source , and psr 1849@xmath000 is a very distant pulsar at a distance of 14.5  kpc  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the ray path from the sources to the sun traverses large distances in the galaxy , with the closest approach to the galactic centre of about 4 kpc .",
    "the maser oh34.26@xmath00.15 is on the same path , but is much closer to the sun , at 3.8  kpc . if most of the scattering material lies beyond that distance , presumably near the point where the path is closest to the galactic centre ( at 6.6  kpc from the sun , assuming the distance to the galactic centre from the sun 8 kpc ) , then the oh maser emission will not be scattered so much .",
    "one could argue that the large discrepancy of scattering parameters between oh maser and continuum sources ( like pulsars ) is due to small scale variations in the distribution of the scattering material .",
    "the angular separation between the oh maser and 1849@xmath0005 is 076 and corresponds to 50  pc .",
    "this small scale is inconsistent with an almost equally small scattering of two other oh masers in this region oh35.20@xmath111.76 and oh45.47@xmath00.13  @xcite which are separated by about 10 , or 650  pc .",
    "based on observations of three low scattered oh masers in the same region , we suggest that there is a large scale deviation in the distribution of the scattering material in the galaxy .",
    "we report on the first space - vlbi observations of oh masers .",
    "it was also the first time that the 64-m telescope at bear lakes near moscow participated in a space - vlbi experiment .",
    "we constructed a map of the maser oh34.26@xmath00.15 with angular resolution better than 1  milliarcsec .",
