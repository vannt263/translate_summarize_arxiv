    "v473  lyrae ( hr 7308 , 19@xmath015@xmath15949 + 2755346 , j2000.0 ) is one of the most peculiar stars among cepheids .",
    "its light variations were first noted by @xcite .",
    "independently , @xcite identified the star as a short - period cepheid with a tentative period of 3.04 days .",
    "shortly after , an extensive radial velocity ( rv ) measurement series confirmed that the true pulsation period is half of the above value , 1.49 days @xcite , the shortest value among galactic cepheids .",
    "burki & mayor discovered strong variations in the pulsation amplitude over the one and half years of observations .",
    "they concluded that the star either produced a sporadic or even unique event and it is perhaps arriving to the edge the instability strip or , were the variations periodic , it shows something similar to the blazhko effect observed in rr  lyrae stars .    in the latter case",
    "v473  lyrae would become the first cepheid to undergo periodic amplitude modulations , with a period longer than two years .",
    "extensive observations finally revealed that the star indeed shows periodic amplitude variations on a time scale of approximately three years @xcite .",
    "the modulation period was determined to be somewhere around 1210 and 1258 days @xcite .",
    "the origin of the modulation , however , remained a mystery .",
    "several mechanisms were proposed during the years , but none of them was found to be satisfactory . @xcite proposed the beating of two closely spaced pulsation frequencies , the cycle length would , however , require a non - radial mode very close to the main mode .",
    "@xcite showed that v473  lyrae has no companions that could cause the amplitude variations .",
    "beating and mode interactions were revisited by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite calculated one - zone models with variable external flux to explain the modulation but found that the modulation period should increase over time .",
    "finally , based on the apparent similarities to the modulation seen in rr  lyrae stars , the blazhko effect was considered by several authors . based on the _ hipparcos _ light curve , @xcite found that the pulsation amplitude is strongly modulated with a period of about 1200 days but did not detect phase variations .",
    "@xcite did find changes in the pulsation phase , but he argued that the star exhibits discrete phase jumps instead of the more gradual phase modulation .",
    "@xcite argued that the blazhko effect in rr  lyrae stars and cepheids might be driven in a very similar manner by turbulent convective cycles .",
    "a detailed , direct comparison with the rr  lyrae stars , however , has not been carried out so far .",
    "admittedly , since there is no accepted explanation for the blazhko effect yet , the comparison can only be phenomenological .",
    "but any similarities or differences could provide additional clues and constraints for a common mechanism that may operate in both types of variables .",
    "new observational and theoretical developments fundamentally changed the way we look at the blazhko effect in rr  lyrae stars @xcite .",
    "space - based photometry revealed additional modes and resonances in the modulated stars , features that all their stable siblings , so far , lack @xcite .",
    "the modulation itself was found to be non - repetitive or even extremely variable in several stars @xcite .",
    "moreover , observational findings contradict most proposed mechanisms for the blazhko effect .",
    "the most likely explanation is currently the mode resonance hypothesis @xcite . unlike in the non - radial resonant rotator model ,",
    "the modulation arises from the non - linear interaction of the modes instead of the rotation of the star .",
    "the mode resonance model can be applied to cepheids too .",
    "these stars show the same dynamic features that were observed in rr  lyrae stars : multi - mode pulsation , period doubling and strange modes , modes trapped close to the surface @xcite .",
    "therefore we expect that mode resonances may occur in these stars as well . however , modulated cepheids are much rarer than modulated rr  lyrae stars .",
    "the notable exceptions are the double - mode cepheids in the large magellanic cloud but in those stars both modes show periodic amplitude and phase variations @xcite . among the galactic cepheids",
    ", v473  lyrae was the only definitive case , until the recent announcement of a few additional stars with indications of blazhko - like amplitude variability by @xcite .",
    "we started investigating v473  lyrae to find out if the modulation properties are truly similar to the blazhko effect in rr  lyrae stars .",
    "our first results were promising : we showed that the star exhibits simultaneous amplitude and phase modulations @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present the results of an in - depth analysis of the multicolour photometric data and some limited rv measurements .",
    "in addition we carried out hydrodynamic simulations to search for mode resonances that might be at work in the star .",
    "in order to follow the modulation of v473  lyrae , we collected all the available observations in johnson colours of the star ) ; aavso . ] .",
    "we examined the observations collected by amateur astronomers in the aavso database : a handful of photometric measurements were included but scatter of the visual estimates were too large compared to the pulsation amplitude so they were omitted .",
    "most observations were made in the _ ubv _ bands , but we collected a small amount of _",
    "r- _ and _ _ i-__band photometry as well .",

    "these methods are based on various phenomenological properties ( amplitude , shape , phase relations ) of the phase curves of the brightness and rv variations .",

    "<S> v473  lyrae is the only galactic cepheid with confirmed periodic amplitude and phase variations similar to the blazhko effect observed in rr  lyrae stars . </S>",
    "<S> we collected all available photometric data and some radial velocity measurements to investigate the nature of the modulation . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison of the photometric and radial velocity amplitudes confirmed that the star pulsates in the second overtone . </S>",
    "<S> the extensive data set , spanning more than 40 years , allowed us to detect a secondary modulation cycle with a period of approximately 5300 days or 14.5 years . </S>",
    "<S> the secondary variations can be detected in the period of the primary modulation , as well .    </S>",
    "<S> phenomenologically , the light variations are analogous to the blazhko effect . to find a physical link , we calculated linear hydrodynamic models to search for potential mode resonances that could drive the modulation and found two viable half - integer ( n:2 ) and three n:4 resonances between the second overtone and other modes . </S>",
    "<S> if any of these resonances will be confirmed by non - linear models , it may confirm the mode resonance model , a common mechanism that can drive modulations both in rr  lyrae and cepheid stars .    </S>",
