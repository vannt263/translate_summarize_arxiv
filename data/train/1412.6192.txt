    "hydrogen is a promising energy carrier in future energy systems , but storage of hydrogen is still a major challenge.@xcite lithium amide ( linh@xmath0 ) is a promising material due to its high hydrogen density .",

    "@xcite these two compounds have attracted a lot of attention ever since chen _",
    "et al._@xcite demonstrated that li@xmath3n can absorb / desorb hydrogen at reasonable pressures following the reversible reaction : @xmath7 the theoretical amount of reversible hydrogen storage in this reaction is @xmath811.5 wt% ( expressed per mole of li@xmath3n ) . at temperatures below 300@xmath6c ,",

    "yet , the fundamental mechanisms behind the decomposition and ( de)hydrogenation processes are not fully understood , and we expect that once such understanding has been established , one can provide solutions for speeding up the reaction kinetics and lowering the dehydrogenation temperature and hydrogenation pressure .    regarding the dehydrogenation reaction in eq .",
    "( [ eq : reaction2 ] ) , it has been suggested that linh@xmath0 may react directly with lih at the linh@xmath0/lih interface according to a polar mechanism to produce h@xmath0 .",
    "@xcite the mechanism is explained in terms of the strong affinity between protonic hydrogen ( h@xmath10 ) in linh@xmath0 and hydridic hydrogen ( h@xmath11 ) in lih where the redox reaction of h@xmath10 and h@xmath11 produces molecular hydrogen ( h@xmath0 ) .",
    "@xcite thermal desorption measurements carried out on a linh@xmath0 + 2lid mixture , however , showed that it produces mainly h@xmath0 in addition to hd and d@xmath0 ( instead of mainly hd as one would have expected ) .",
    "@xcite this seems to be contrary to the redox hypothesis .",
    "others have proposed that nh@xmath3 necessarily evolves as a transient gas and the dehydrogenation of linh@xmath0+lih mixtures involves an intermediate step :  @xcite @xmath12 @xmath13 the first reaction releases 37 wt% nh@xmath3 and was suggested to be diffusion - controlled , whereas the second reaction releases 5.8 wt% h@xmath0 and is supposedly ultrafast .",
    "the decomposition of linh@xmath0 into li@xmath0nh and nh@xmath3 is well known ,  @xcite and it was hu and ruckenstein who pointed out that nh@xmath3 reacts quickly with lih .",
    "@xcite the activation energy for the decomposition of linh@xmath0 was estimated to be 2.53 ev ( before ball milling ) , and it was found to decrease with increasing ball - milling time .",

    "et al._,@xcite there are very close structural similarities between the tetragonal linh@xmath0 and the antifluorite li@xmath0nh . through structural refinement from synchrotron x - ray diffraction data",
    ", they suggested that the transformation between linh@xmath0 and li@xmath0nh is a bulk reaction that occurs through non - stoichiometric processes within the cubic li - n - h structure .",

    "further proposed a mechanism for the li amide / imide decomposition and hydrogenation processes ( within the abovementioned ammonia - mediated two - step reaction ) that involves the migration of both li@xmath1 and h@xmath1 ions ; they also suggested that the non - stoichiometry observed in the li - n - h system is a direct result of the ionic mobility .",
    "the most important step in this mechanism would be the movement of a lithium ion to an interstitial site , forming a lithium frenkel defect pair .",
    "@xcite    in addition to the polar mechanism and the ammonia - mediated mechanism , aguey - zinsou _",
    "et al._@xcite have recently suggested that the reaction between linh@xmath0 and lih below 300@xmath6c is a heterogeneous solid - state reaction , controlled by the diffusion of li@xmath1 from lih to linh@xmath0 across the interface . in this mechanism , the reaction is direct rather than ammonia - mediated .",
    "@xcite    theoretical studies of linh@xmath0 and li@xmath0nh to date have focused mainly on structural , electronic , and thermodynamic properties of the bulk compounds .",
    "@xcite experimental data ,  @xcite on the other hand , suggest that the rate - limiting process in the li amide / imide reaction involves mass transport mediated by point defects .",
    "this scenario motivated us to perform first - principles calculations for point defects and defect complexes in linh@xmath0 and li@xmath0nh in order to explore possible defect - related mechanisms that can explain the decomposition of linh@xmath0 [ reaction ( [ eq : reaction3 ] ) ] and the hydrogenation of li@xmath0nh . some preliminary results and partial conclusions of our work",
    "have been reported elsewhere .",
    "@xcite other research groups have also recently started investigating native defects ,  @xcite but our study goes much further in identifying specific mechanisms that can explain the experimental observations .",
    "a detailed comparison with the previous papers will be addressed in sections [ ssec : n ] and [ ssec : decomp ] .    indeed , we show that linh@xmath0 decomposes into li@xmath0nh and nh@xmath3 via two competing mechanisms with different activation energies : one mechanism involves the formation of native defects in the interior of the material , the other at the surface . as a result , the prevailing mechanism and hence the effective activation energy for decomposition depend on the surface - to - volume ratio or the specific surface area , which changes with particle size during ball milling .",
    "the dehydrogenation of linh@xmath0+lih mixtures can be explained in terms of the two - step reaction [ eqs .",
    "( [ eq : reaction3 ] ) and ( [ eq : reaction4 ] ) ] and the mechanisms we propose for linh@xmath0 decomposition .",
    "however , nh@xmath3 is not necessarily formed and released from a linh@xmath0+lih mixture if linh@xmath0 and lih are in intimate contact .",
    "we also show that lithium interstitials and vacancies in linh@xmath0 and li@xmath0nh can be formed in the interior of the materials via a frenkel - pair mechanism and are highly mobile , and that li amide ( imide ) units can be locally formed inside the bulk li imide ( amide ) .",
    "our results support david _ et al .",
    "_ s proposal that the li amide / imide is a bulk reaction , and that there is a continuous transformation between linh@xmath0 and li@xmath0nh via non - stoichiometric intermediates .",
    "@xcite it is , however , not the formation and migration of lithium - related defects that is the rate - limiting step in the kinetics of the li amide / imide reaction , but the formation and migration of hydrogen interstitials and vacancies which are responsible for forming and breaking n@xmath2h bonds in linh@xmath0 ( and li@xmath0nh ) .",

    "next , @xmath54 and h@xmath55 become separated as h@xmath55 jumps from one ( nh@xmath39)@xmath46 unit to another .",

    "h@xmath55 then migrates to the surface and is released as nh@xmath3 .",
    "note that here we assume that as h@xmath55 migrates from one ( nh@xmath0)@xmath77 unit to the next , a corresponding li@xmath45 moves in the opposite direction in the form of li@xmath87 ( see more below ) .",
    "the overall activation energy ( @xmath96 ) for this mechanism then consists of the formation energy of the ( h@xmath55,@xmath54 ) frenkel pair ( 1.54 ev ) , the cost for separating the species in this frenkel pair ( 0.38 ev ) , plus the migration barrier of h@xmath55 ( 0.61 ev ) , i.e. , @xmath96=1.54 + 0.38 + 0.61=2.53 ev .",
    "this activation energy is in very good agreement with the experimental value of 2.53 ev for the activation energy related to the decomposition of linh@xmath0 before ball milling .",

    "this h@xmath1 ion can combine with a surface ( nh@xmath39)@xmath46 unit to form nh@xmath95 that is subsequently released .",
    "given the ionic nature of the bonding between li@xmath45 and ( nh@xmath39)@xmath46 , we believe that such a process will be possible , irrespective of the details of the surface structure .",
    "note that the rate - limiting step in this mechanism is not the formation of @xmath81 at the surface , but the hydrogen mass transport to the surface ; i.e. , in order to maintain this reaction , hydrogen atoms have to be transported to the surface . here",
    "our only assumption is that the formation energy of @xmath81 on the surface is lower than ( or equal to ) the formation energy in the bulk , which is a safe assumption given that the bonding environment at the surface is less constrained than in the bulk . in this mechanism",

    "the li@xmath45 unit that was left with after the surface ( nh@xmath39)@xmath46 unit was released with the h@xmath1 ( in form of nh@xmath95 ) assists the hydrogen self - diffusion in the form of li@xmath97 , as required by the charge neutrality condition .",
    "note also that the complex formed by @xmath81 and li@xmath87 corresponds to a formula unit of li@xmath39nh inside linh@xmath39 .",
    "the calculated activation energy of 1.34 ev is also in good agreement with experimentally determined activation energies for the decomposition of ball - milled linh@xmath0 , ranging from 1.33 to 1.43 ev .",

    "these experimental activation energy values are within the range ( 1.34@xmath22.52 ev ) established by the calculated activation energies for mechanisms 1 and 2 .",
    "it should be noted that the increase in ssa upon ball milling not only increases the likelihood of point defect formation at the surface , it also increases the chance that the point defects can reach all parts of the `` bulk '' within a given amount of time .",

    "this is somewhat similar to the two mechanisms we described above .",

    "et al . _ , on the other hand , reported a different set of activation energies : 2.46 ev ( before milling , ssa : 16.5 m@xmath98/g ) , 0.98 ev ( after 1h , ssa : 26.4 m@xmath98/g ) , 0.88 ev ( after 25h , ssa : 59.6 m@xmath98/g ) , and 0.91 ev ( after 100h , ssa : 45.6 m@xmath98/g ) .",
    "@xcite both sets of experimental values show the same trend : the activation energy is reduced significantly with ball milling and there is a correlation with the measured ssa .",
    "we suggest that the activation energy for the dehydrogenation of linh@xmath39+lih mixtures with relatively short milling times is predominantly determined by that for the decomposition of linh@xmath0 .",
    "the above mentioned experimental data can therefore be explained in terms of our discussion in sec .",
    "[ ssec : decomp ] about linh@xmath0 decomposition , meaning the dehydrogenation of the mixtures is expected to proceed via mechanisms 1 and/or 2 , and the extent to which one mechanism dominates over the other depends on the surface - to - volume ratio ( or the ssa ) .",
    "this provides an explanation for the observed activation energies in the range from 1.34 to 2.52 ev .",
    "for those samples that exhibit activation energies lower than that of mechanism 2 ( 1.34 ev ) , produced after long milling times , we suggest that the milling process may have created a high degree of damage in the linh@xmath39+lih mixtures , even to the point of local amorphization .",
    "formation energies for defects in these damaged regions would be lower than in the pristine bulk , resulting in defect concentrations well above the equilibrium concentrations ; this lowering of the cost of forming the rate - limiting defects results in a lowering of the activation energy for dehydrogenation .",
    "shaw _ et al .",
    "_  suggested that nh@xmath3 diffusion through a li@xmath0nh product layer outside a linh@xmath0 shrinking core is the rate - limiting step in the kinetics of the dehydrogenation of linh@xmath39+lih mixtures .",
    "@xcite we find that this is very unlikely if the li@xmath0nh layer is thick enough . as presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : defects ] , our results clearly indicate that nh@xmath3 is not likely to form ( and diffuse ) as interstitial molecules in either linh@xmath0 or li@xmath0nh because the formation energy is too high . in li@xmath0nh ,",
    "interstitial nh@xmath3 molecules are even unstable toward forming ( nh@xmath0)@xmath46 units , by combining with host ( nh)@xmath47 units .",
    "note that the calculated activation energy of mechanism 2 reported in sec .",
    "[ ssec : decomp ] depends on the formation energy of @xmath54 at the fermi - level value @xmath32 determined by the charge neutrality condition , which in turn depends on the chemical potentials of li , n , and h. however , we have checked several possible scenarios and found that the calculated activation energy is not sensitive to the choice of chemical potentials . in the case of linh@xmath39+lih mixtures , for example , if the two reactants are carefully mixed , one can assume equilibrium between linh@xmath0 , li@xmath0nh , and lih , which gives rise to a different set of chemical potentials where @xmath102=@xmath20.40 ev . the fermi level of linh@xmath39 is then at @xmath32=2.58 ev where li@xmath55 and @xmath66 have equal formation energies .",
    "we find that in this case the activation energy of mechanism 2 is still 1.34 ev .      before discussing the hydrogenation mechanism of li@xmath0nh ,",
    "let us summarize what is known about the hydrogenation process in metals .",
    "the absorption of hydrogen to form a metal hydride includes several steps :  @xcite ( i ) the applied h@xmath0 is physisorbed on the surface of the metal ; ( ii ) the physisorbed h@xmath0 is dissociated at the surface and becomes chemisorbed ; ( iii ) h atoms move to subsurface sites and diffuse through the metal ; ( iv ) as the hydrogen concentration increases , a metal hydride phase nucleates . in this process , the rate - limiting step changes from the dissociation and penetration of hydrogen at the metal / h@xmath0 interface to the nucleation of the hydride phase , and possibly the diffusion of hydrogen through the metal hydride layer that forms around the metal particle .  @xcite we expect to see similar processes in li@xmath0nh .    for the hydrogenation reaction in eq .",
    "( [ eq : reaction2 ] ) , the highly mobile li@xmath55 and @xmath66 in li@xmath0nh are expected to play an important role .",
    "these two defects can be created at the surface or simultaneously in the interior of the material via a frenkel pair mechanism .",
    "li@xmath55 is likely to interact with the applied h@xmath0 gas at the surface , or with the chemisorbed h that diffuses into the material , and form lih and h@xmath55 , i.e. , li@xmath55 + h@xmath0 @xmath103 lih + h@xmath55 .",
    "this h@xmath55 will then be attracted toward the @xmath66 defect to form h@xmath65 ( a complex of h@xmath55 and @xmath66 ) , which provides ( nh@xmath0)@xmath1 units for the formation of linh@xmath0 .",
    "this is similar to the mechanism proposed by david _",
    "et al._@xcite for li amide / imide hydrogenation .",
    "the rate - limiting step in this process could be the diffusion of h@xmath55 in the bulk of li@xmath0nh .",
    "however this can not be claimed with certainty without explicit investigations of all other possible steps involved in the hydrogenation process .",
    "we have carried out comprehensive first - principles studies of native defects in linh@xmath0 and li@xmath0nh .",
    "both compounds are found to be prone to frenkel disorder on the li sublattice , which is consistent with experimental observations .",
    "lithium interstitials and vacancies have low formation energies and are highly mobile ; they can therefore participate in ionic conduction and mass transport , and act as accompanying defects for hydrogen - related defects in mass transport .",
    "hydrogen interstitials and vacancies , on the other hand , are responsible for forming and breaking n@xmath2h bonds , which are essential in the li amide / imide reaction . based on the structure , energetics , and migration of hydrogen- , lithium- , and nitrogen - related point defects and defect complexes ,",
    "we have proposed that linh@xmath0 decomposes into li@xmath0nh and nh@xmath3 according to two competing mechanisms , one involving the formation of native defects in the interior of the material , and the other at the surface . as a result ,",
    "the prevalent mechanism and hence the effective activation energy for decomposition depend on the surface - to - volume ratio or the specific surface area , which changes with particle size during ball milling .",
    "these mechanisms also provide an explanation for the particle - size dependence of the activation energy of the decomposition of linh@xmath0 and that of the dehydrogenation of linh@xmath0+lih mixtures .",
