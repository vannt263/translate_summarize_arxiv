    "the study of kaon and antikaon properties in a strongly interacting environment was a very active research field over the last two decades ( see , for example , [ 13 ] ) , especially in connection with the questions of the partial restoration of chiral symmetry in hot / dense nuclear matter and of the existence of the @xmath2 condensate in neutron stars . from the analysis of kaos [ 4 ] , fopi [ 5 ] and anke [ 6 ] data on @xmath3 production in heavy ",
    "ion and proton  nucleus reactions in the framework of transport approaches [ 7 ] and [ 8 ] was established that the @xmath3 meson ( @xmath4 ) feels a moderately repulsive nuclear potential of about 2030 mev at normal nuclear matter density @xmath5 , in agreement with theoretical calculations [ 3 , 9 ] .",
    "a very recent results on the azimuthal emission pattern of @xmath3 mesons in ni@xmath6ni collisions at a beam kinetic energy of 1.91 a gev , obtained by the fopi collaboration , also support the existence of a repulsive kaon  nucleus potential of the same order of magnitude as that mentioned above [ 10 ] .",
    "similar to @xmath3 , the @xmath7 meson in - medium nuclear potential is expected to be repulsive as well due to its quark content ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "indeed , the comparison of the ratio of the @xmath7 momentum distributions from @xmath9pb and @xmath9c reactions at a pion incident momentum of 1.15 gev / c , measured by the fopi collaboration , with the hsd transport model calculations suggests a repulsive @xmath7nucleus optical potential of about 20 mev at normal nuclear matter density [ 11 ] . whereas the data on @xmath7 transverse momentum spectra in ar@xmath6kcl and @xmath10nb reactions at bombarding kinetic energies of 1.756 a gev and 3.5 gev , collected recently by the hades collaboration , point to the existence of a stronger repulsive in - medium @xmath7 potential of about 3540 mev strength at saturation density @xmath5 for kaons at rest [ 12 ] .",
    "contrary to the @xmath3 , @xmath7 mesons , the @xmath2 meson ( @xmath11 ) properties in nuclear matter are much less known nowadays and are still very intense debated .",
    "this is due to the fact that antikaon can easily form baryonic resonances in the nuclear medium , which leads to the modification of its in - medium properties and requires a complicated self - consistent coupled - channel calculations of this modification with including the complete set of the pseudoscalar meson and baryon octets .",
    "such calculations , based on a chiral lagrangians [ 1319 ] or on meson - exchange potentials [ 20 , 21 ] , predict a relatively shallow low - energy @xmath2nucleus potential with a central depth of the order of -50 to -80 mev . on the other hand ,",
    "fits of the @xmath2 atomic data [ 22 ] by the phenomenological density - dependent optical potentials as well as by these potentials and the relativistic mean - field calculations [ 23 ] lead to a deep potential of depth of about -200 mev at density @xmath5 for antikaon in matter , which is in conflict with the results of the self - consistent approaches mentioned above .",
    "recent a chirally motivated meson - baryon coupled - channel model [ 24 ] , which accounts for the subthreshold in - medium @xmath12 @xmath13-wave scattering amplitudes , produces @xmath2 potential depths in the range of -(8090 ) mev in kaonic atoms at nuclear matter density .",
    "but by adding a @xmath14-dependent phenomenological term , which could represent @xmath15 absorption and dispersion , to improve the agreement with data , the antikaon potential becomes twice as deep [ 24 , 25 ] .",
    "however , it should be noted that the antikaonic - atom data probe medium at the surface of the nucleus and , therefore , do not provide the strong constraints on the @xmath2nucleus potential at the normal nuclear matter density .",
    "present status of the study of low - energy in - medium @xmath2 nuclear interactions is given in [ 25 ] .",
    "motivated by the fact that a very strong antikaon  nucleon potential could form a deeply bound kaonic states [ 26 ] , the experiments of kek [ 27 ] and finuda [ 28 ] have been performed to search for such states and , as a result , they claim evidence for their existence . in disto experiment [ 29 ] , the indication of a deeply bound compact @xmath16 cluster formed in the @xmath17 reaction at 2.85 gev has been obtained .",
    "an analysis of the final state of this reaction at a beam kinetic energy of 3.5 gev with the aim of studying of the possible formation of an intermediate @xmath16 bound - state in it has been carried out by the hades collaboration as well [ 30 ] .",
    "it was found that the data , which were collected with the hades spectrometer , are compatible with the background - only hypothesis that includes no production of intermediate kaonic cluster .",
    "also , more precise kek experiment [ 31 ] did not observe a narrow structure in proton spectrum following @xmath2 absorption at rest in @xmath18he , which has been identified in [ 27 ] with deeply bound @xmath19 cluster .",
    "in a recent j - parc experiment [ 32 ] , devoted to searching for the @xmath16 bound state in the in - flight @xmath20he(@xmath21 ) reaction at 1 gev / c , no significant peak was also observed in the neutron missing - mass spectrum in the region corresponding to @xmath16 binding energy larger than 80 mev , where a bump structure was reported in the @xmath22 final state by the finuda and disto collaborations . on the other hand , an another very recent j - parc experiment [ 33 ] claims evidence for the observation of a `` @xmath16''-like structure in the @xmath23 reaction at 1.69 gev / c with binding energy of @xmath24(stat.)@xmath25(syst . )",
    "theoretically , it has been argued [ 34 ] that at present there are no experimental evidences both for the existence of deeply bound kaonic states and for a strong antikaon  nucleus potential with a central depth of the order of -200 mev , claimed in the experiment [ 35 ] .",
    "the information about in - medium properties of antikaons can be deduced also from the study of their production both in heavy ",
    "ion and proton - nucleus collisions at incident energies near or below the free nucleon  nucleon threshold ( 2.5 gev ) because the dropping @xmath2 mass scenario will lead to an enhancement of the @xmath2 yield in these collisions due to in - medium shifts of the elementary production thresholds to lower energies .",
    "thus , in particular , in [ 1 , 3 , 10 ] was shown that the existence of a @xmath2 condensate is not compatible with the available heavy  ion data .",
    "analysis of the kaos data on the ratio of @xmath2 and @xmath3 inclusive momentum spectra from reactions @xmath26 with @xmath27c and au at laboratory angles from 36@xmath28 to 60@xmath28 and beam energy of 2.5 gev within the buu transport model has shown that these data are consistent with the in - medium @xmath29 potential of the order of -80 mev at normal nuclear density [ 36 ] .",
    "reasonable description of the measured at itep accelerator both inclusive antikaon momentum distributions in the momentum range from 0.6 to 1.3 gev / c at a lab angle of 10.5@xmath28 in @xmath30be , @xmath30cu interactions at 2.25 , 2.4 gev beam energies and @xmath2 excitation functions in these interactions for @xmath2 momentum of 1.28 gev / c at bombarding energies @xmath31 3 gev was , respectively , reached in [ 37 ] and in [ 38 ] in the frame of folding model , based on the target nucleon momentum distribution and on free elementary cross sections , assuming vacuum @xmath3 , @xmath2 masses .",
    "the @xmath2 potential of @xmath32 -28 mev at density @xmath5 and an antikaon momentum of 800 mev / c has been extracted in [ 39 ] from the data on elastic @xmath29 scattering within glauber theory .",
    "so , one can conclude that the situation with the antikaon  nucleus optical potential is still very unclear .    to make progress in understanding the strength of the @xmath2 interaction with nuclear medium , it is necessary to carry out the exclusive measurements with the tagging the low - momentum @xmath2 mesons not stemming from the vacuum @xmath0 decays and , therefore , bringing the `` genuine '' information about this strength .",
    "such measurements have been recently performed by the anke collaboration at cosy that studied the production of @xmath1 pairs in proton collisions with c , cu , ag , and au targets at an incident beam energy of 2.83 gev for the @xmath1 invariant masses belonging to the @xmath0 and non-@xmath0 regions [ 40 , 41 ] .",
    "for the first time , in the @xmath0 region , the momentum dependence of the @xmath0 nuclear transparency ratio , the in - medium @xmath0 meson width , and the differential cross section for its production at forward angles have been determined for these targets over the @xmath0 momentum range of 0.61.6 gev / c [ 40 , 41 ] . for the purpose of obtaining of the exclusive differential cross section for @xmath1 pair production on the considered target nuclei as a function of the laboratory @xmath2 momentum , a further analysis of the data coming from the non-@xmath0 region of the @xmath1 invariant mass is currently being carried out .    in this respect ,",
    "the main purpose of the present work is to get the estimates of the absolute and relative yields of non - resonant ( not through the vacuum @xmath33 decayssince the @xmath0 mesons produced in @xmath34 reactions at incident energy of 2.83 gev have large momenta [ 41 ] , most of them will decay outside the nucleus .",
    "moreover , the total cross section of the reaction @xmath35 , as is seen from figure 1 given below , is more than one order of magnitude less than that of the non - resonant @xmath1 pair production in @xmath36 collisions at excess energies @xmath37 above the @xmath38 threshold @xmath39 , @xmath40 ( @xmath41 is the total center - of - mass energy ) , falling in the range of 0.10.5 gev , which mainly contribute , as our estimates showed , to the @xmath1 creation in the considered in the next section primary processes at this incident energy .",

    "nucleon @xmath1 creation processes in different scenarios for the @xmath2 nuclear potential . in view of the expected data from this experiment ,",
    "the estimates can be used as an important tool for determining the antikaon - nucleus optical potential .",
    "the direct non - resonant ( non-@xmath0 ) production of @xmath1 pairs in @xmath34 reactions at initial energy of 2.83 gev of our interest can occur due to the nucleon s fermi motion in the following elementary processes with zero , one and two pions in the final statesit should be pointed out that the @xmath1 pairs can be produced also in the elementary reaction channel non-@xmath0 @xmath43 studied recently in the threshold energy region by the anke collaboration [ 42 ] .",
    "however , its contribution to the kaon pair creation in @xmath34 collisions at beam energy of 2.83 gev is expected [ 37 ] to be insignificant at antikaon momenta @xmath31 0.9 gev / c of our interest.]@xmath42 : @xmath44 @xmath45 @xmath46 @xmath47 where @xmath48 . in the following calculations",
    "we will include the medium modification of the final nucleons , kaon and antikaon , participating in the production processes ( 1)(4 ) , by using in the in - medium cross sections of these processes , for reasons of numerical simplicity , instead of their local effective masses @xmath49 their average in - medium masses @xmath50 defined in line with [ 43 , 44 , 45 ] as : @xmath51 here , @xmath52 is the hadron free space massthe bare kaon and antikaon masses are denoted by @xmath53.]@xmath42 , @xmath54 is its nuclear potential depth at saturation density @xmath55 , @xmath56 is the average nucleon densitywhich is assumed to be equal to @xmath57 [ 46 ] for all considered target nuclei.]@xmath42 and @xmath58 is the charged hadron coulomb potentialit is worth mentioning that this potential for kaons and protons amounts approximately to 3.5 , 9.7 , 12.3 , and 16.6 mev for c , cu , ag , and au nuclei , respectively [ 44 ] , i.e. for heavy nuclei like au it is of the same order of magnitude as the repulsive @xmath3 nuclear mean - field potential.]@xmath42 taken at the point @xmath59 at which the local nucleon density @xmath60 satisfies the relation @xmath61 . in the subsequent study for the @xmath3 and @xmath2 mass shifts @xmath62 and",

    "one can see that the second option corresponds to the shallow antikaon - nucleus potential , whereas the third and fourth ones represent , respectively , the relatively deep and deep @xmath29 optical potentials .",
    "accounting for that the relation between the effective scalar nucleon potential @xmath69 , entering into the equation ( 5 ) , and the corresponding schr@xmath70dinger equivalent potential @xmath71 at the normal nuclear matter density is given by @xmath72 as well as the fact that the momenta @xmath73 of the outgoing in reactions ( 1)(4 ) nucleons are , as showed our calculations , around of momentum of 1 gev / c and using that @xmath74 mev at this momentum [ 47 ] , we can readily obtain that @xmath75 mev .",
    "we will employ this potential throughout our present work .",

    "let us discuss now the results of our calculations in the framework of the approach outlined above .",
    "at first , we consider the non - resonant differential @xmath1 production cross sections in the anke acceptance window from the one - step and two - step creation mechanisms in @xmath30c and @xmath30au collisions calculated on the basis of equations ( 23 ) and ( 34 ) for the proton kinetic energy of 2.83 gev in two scenarios for the @xmath2 potential depth @xmath225 , namely : i ) @xmath226 mev and ii ) @xmath227 mev . in our calculations of these cross sections , presented in figure 2 ,",

    "@xmath226 mev and @xmath227 mev as indicated by the curves.,width=453 ]    one can see that the two - step @xmath1 production mechanism is of importance compared to the one - step in the chosen kinematics at laboratory antikaon momenta @xmath230 0.4 gev / c and @xmath230 0.6 gev / c for target nuclei c and au , respectively , for both considered options for the @xmath2 potential depth @xmath225 , whereas at higher @xmath2 momenta the direct @xmath1 production processes ( 1)(4 ) are dominant and their dominance here is more pronounced , as is expected , for the carbon target nucleus .",
    "this indicates that the secondary pion ",
    "nucleon @xmath1 production channels have to be taken into account in the analysis of the data on non - resonant kaon pair creation in @xmath34 interactions obtained recently by the anke - at - cosy collaboration .",
    "it is also clearly seen that the considered coincident antikaon spectrum from the one - step production mechanism reacts sensitively to the @xmath2 potential practically at all antikaon momenta involved . the dependence of the @xmath2 yield from the two - step production mechanism on this potential exists as well , but , contrary to the preceding case , it is more moderate . therefore , as a result , the above offers the possibility to determine the antikaon potential experimentally ( cf . figures 4 , 5 given below ) .",

    "such relative observables are more favorable compared to those based on the absolute cross sections for the aim of getting the information on particle nuclear potential both from the experimental and theoretical sides , since , on the one hand , they allow for a reduction of systematic errors due to the cancellation of the efficiency corrections and , on the other hand , the theoretical uncertainties associated with the particle production and absorption mechanisms substantially cancel out in them.]@xmath42 .",
    "it can be seen that there are essential differences between the results obtained by using different suppositions about the @xmath1 creation mechanism and the same potential depths @xmath225 ( between solid and dashed lines ) .",
    "we may see , for example , that for low antikaon momenta , where the @xmath1 production via the secondary pion - induced reaction channels is enhanced , the calculated ratio can be of the order of 2.4 and 3.1 for the direct @xmath1 creation mechanism as well as 3.7 and 7.5 for the direct plus two - step @xmath1 production mechanisms when the antikaon potential depths of -126 mev and 0 mev were applied , respectively .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that in the analysis of data on this relative observable , taken in the anke experiment , it is important to account for the secondary pion - induced @xmath1 production processes .",
    "looking at this figure , one can see also that the calculated ratio for the direct @xmath1 production mechanism , contrary to the absolute cross sections depicted in figure 2 , is not very sensitive to the effective potential @xmath225 , which is seen inside the nucleus by an antikaon , practically at all @xmath2 momenta of interest . whereas , this potential influences substantially the ratio of the differential cross sections under consideration obtained with accounting for the one- and two - step creation mechanisms , namely : the inclusion of the attractive @xmath2 potential leads to the visible suppression of this ratio at low antikaon momenta ( cf .",
    "figure 6 given below ) .",
    "this leaves a room for distinguishing between different @xmath2 potentials from the measurements of the relative observable like that just considered .",
    "pairs off cu , ag and au target nuclei presented in figures 4 , 5 to that off c target nucleus given in figure 4 as a function of antikaon momentum for @xmath2 potential depths @xmath226 mev ( solid lines ) , @xmath231 mev ( dashed lines ) , @xmath227 mev ( dot - dashed lines ) and @xmath232 mev ( dotted lines).,width=604 ]    figures 4 and 5 show the results of our overall model calculations following the equations ( 23 ) and ( 34 ) for the exclusive differential cross sections for the non - resonant production of @xmath1 pairs on c , cu and ag , au target nuclei in the anke acceptance window for the primary and secondary @xmath1 creation processes obtained for bombarding energy of 2.83 gev by employing in them four adopted options for the @xmath2 potential depth @xmath225 to see more clearly the sensitivity of the calculated cross sections to the choice of the antikaon optical potential .",
    "it is nicely seen that for all nuclei there are measurable changes in the absolute cross sections for the @xmath1 production on these nuclei due to this potential , especially when it varies between -60 mev and 0 mev ( cf . figure 2 ) .",
    "we , therefore , can conclude that the @xmath2 nuclear potential can be in principle extracted from the direct comparison of the results of our calculations , presented in figures 4 and 5 , with the data from the anke experiment .    in figure 6",
    "we show also the overall predictions of our model for the antikaon momentum dependence of the ratios of the exclusive differential cross sections for the non - resonant production of @xmath1 pairs off cu , ag , and au target nuclei , given , respectively , in figures 4 and 5 , to that off c target nucleus , presented in figure 4 , for four adopted options for the @xmath2 potential depth @xmath225 .",
    "one can see that the relative @xmath1 yield , along with the absolute one considered before , is appreciably sensitive to the antikaon potential at momenta less than 0.6 gev / c for all considered @xmath104/c combinations , which is consistent with our previous findings of figure 3 .",
    "thus , our results demonstrate that the measurements of the @xmath2 momentum dependence of the relative cross section for non - resonant @xmath1 production in @xmath34 collisions in the chosen kinematics and at beam energy of interest will also allow one to discriminate between four employed scenarios for the in - medium antikaon modification .",
    "pairs from primary plus secondary channels in the laboratory polar angular acceptance window @xmath233 as a function of antikaon momentum in the interaction of protons of energy of 2.83 gev with c target nucleus for @xmath2 potential depth @xmath231 mev and for @xmath234 ( dotted line ) , @xmath235 ( dot - dashed line ) , @xmath236 ( solid line ) , and @xmath237 ( dashed line).,width=453 ]    to extend the potential range of applicability of our model we performed the calculations of the exclusive differential cross section for the non - resonant production of @xmath1 pairs from primary plus secondary channels for a carbon target nucleus in the scenario with @xmath2 potential depth of -60 mev at saturation density and for different polar angular acceptance windows for @xmath3 and @xmath2 mesons .",
    "they are shown in figure 7 . here",
    "one can see a reduction of the cross section with respect to the case of @xmath234 with increasing the maximal angle of acceptance window @xmath238 at antikaon momenta larger than 0.4 gev / cfor example , the cross section is decreased by a factors of about 2 and 2.5 at momenta @xmath239 0.70.8 gev / c when going from @xmath234 to @xmath236 and to @xmath237 , respectively.]@xmath42 , whereas it is practically not changed at lower @xmath2 momenta .",
    "such behavior of the overall cross section of interest with increasing the @xmath240 creation polar angular bin is expected to be observed both for other adopted options for antikaon potential depth @xmath225 and for other target nuclei considered in the present paper .",
    "it can be explained by the following . at low @xmath2 momenta ,",
    "the double differential cross sections , appearing in the equations ( 23 ) and ( 34 ) , after averaging over the studied range of kaon momenta with accounting for the kinematical constraint @xmath241 depend weakly on the @xmath240 production angles @xmath242 when they vary close to zero angle .",
    "therefore , the integrals in formulas ( 23 ) and ( 34 ) are practically proportional to the solid angle , covered by the acceptance window , squared . due to the employed definition of cross sections ( 23 ) and ( 34 ) ,",
    "this leads to weak dependence of the overall exclusive cross section defined by these cross sections on the size of the acceptance window . at high @xmath2 momenta ,",
    "the reduction of the cross section with increasing this size is caused by the strong decrease of the above double differential cross sections with enlarging the @xmath240 production angles @xmath242 . in view of the expected data from anke experiment ,",
    "the results presented in figure 7 can be also used as an additional tool to those given before for determining the @xmath2 mean - field nuclear potential at studied range of antikaon momenta .",
    "taking into account the above considerations , we come to the conclusion that the absolute and relative observables such as the exclusive @xmath2 momentum distribution and the ratio of this distribution on heavy nucleus to that on light one ( c ) , considered in the present work , can be useful to help determine the anikaon - nucleus optical potential .",
    "in this paper we calculated the antikaon momentum dependences of the exclusive absolute and relative non - resonant @xmath1 pair yields from @xmath34 ( @xmath104=c , cu , ag , and au ) collisions at 2.83 gev beam energy in the acceptance window of the anke spectrometer , used in a recent experiment performed at cosy , by considering incoherent primary proton  nucleon and secondary pion  nucleon kaon pair production processes in the framework of a nuclear spectral function approach , which accounts for , in particular , nuclear mean - field potential effects on these processes .",
    "it was found that these observables are strongly sensitive to the antikaon - nucleus optical potential in the studied region of the antikaon momenta .",
    "this gives a nice opportunity to determine it from the direct comparison of the results of our calculations with the upcoming data from the respective anke - at - cosy experiment .",
    "it was also shown that the pion - nucleon production channels dominate in the low - momentum @xmath2 , @xmath3 production in the considered kinematics and , therefore , they should be accounted for in the analysis of these data with the aim to obtain information on the antikaon mean - field nuclear potential .",

    "<S> we study the non - resonant ( non-@xmath0 ) production of @xmath1 pairs by protons of 2.83 gev kinetic energy on c , cu , ag , and au targets within the collision model , based on the nuclear spectral function , for incoherent primary proton  nucleon and secondary pion  </S>",

    "<S> the model takes into account the initial proton and final kaon absorption , target nucleon binding and fermi motion as well as nuclear mean - field potential effects on these processes . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the antikaon momentum dependences of the exclusive absolute and relative @xmath1 pair yields in the acceptance window of the anke magnetic spectrometer , used in a recent experiment performed at cosy , within the different scenarios for the antikaon - nucleus optical potential . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the above observables are strongly sensitive to this potential . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , they can be useful to help determine the @xmath2 optical potential from the direct comparison of the results of our calculations with the data from the respective anke - at - cosy experiment . </S>",
