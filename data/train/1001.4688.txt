    "more than ten years ago one of us , together with another scholar , published some papers aiming to show that a noncontextual ( hence local ) interpretation of the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics ( qm ) was , in principle , possible , contrary to the orthodox view @xcite .",
    "this conclusion was based on the remark that the proofs of the theorems which state that qm necessarily is a contextual and nonlocal theory ( mainly the bell  kochen  specker @xcite and the bell @xcite theorems ) rest on an implicit epistemological assumption about the unrestricted validity of the empirical physical laws of qm ( _ metatheoretical classical principle _ , or _",
    "mcp _ ) that can be questioned from an epistemological point of view and is not consistent with the operational attitude of qm . if one accepts only a weaker assumption ( _ metatheoretical generalized principle _ , or",
    "_ mgp _ ) the proofs of the foregoing theorems can not be completed @xcite .",
    "the general lines of such a _ semantic realism _ , or _ sr _ , _ interpretation _ were also discussed in the papers quoted above . of course , the aim of the sr interpretation was to get rid of known quantum paradoxes and avoid the objectification problem @xcite of the quantum theory of measurement , which find their roots in the contextuality of the orthodox interpretation of qm .",
    "the sr interpretation was , however , rather abstract . to show its consistency",
    "some models were propounded @xcite , among which an _ extended semantic realism _ ( _ esr _ ) _ model _ that provides a set  theoretical picture of the physical world which preserves the basic feature of the sr interpretation , that is , the substitution of mcp with the weaker principle mgp , but modifies and in some sense extends it . the esr model is closer to physical intuition and consists of a microscopic and a macroscopic part .",
    "the former is a new kind of noncontextual hidden variables theory for qm which introduces , besides hidden variables , a nonstandard interpretation of quantum probabilities , providing a justification of the assumptions introduced in the macroscopic part .",
    "the latter can be considered as a new theory that embodies the formalism of qm into a broader noncontextual framework .    as most hidden variables theories",
    ", the esr model presupposes that `` something is happening '' at a microscopic level which underlies the standard quantum picture of the physical world and does not reduce to it ( which implies that improvements of the measurements precision and/or technological developments within the established framework of qm can hardly help in solving the conceptual problems of this theory ) .",
    "one therefore needs a broader theory , and the esr model aims to be a first step in this direction . according to this model , the macroscopic properties of a given physical system @xmath0 that can be measured according to qm by macroscopic devices on a _ physical object _",
    "@xmath1 ( individual example of @xmath0 ) bijectively correspond to microscopic properties , each of which either is possessed or is not possessed by @xmath1 , which are the hidden variables of the esr model ( together with further parameters that we do not take into account here for the sake of simplicity and that , however , do not appear in the _ deterministic _ esr model @xcite ) .",
    "the set of all microscopic properties possessed by @xmath1 is called the _ microstate _ of @xmath1 .",
    "if a macroscopic property @xmath2 is measured on @xmath1 and @xmath1 displays @xmath2 , then @xmath1 possesses the microscopic property @xmath3 corresponding to @xmath2 .",
    "but the converse implication does not hold , for it can occur that the set of microscopic properties possessed by @xmath1 is such that @xmath1 is not detected when @xmath2 is measured , even if @xmath1 possesses the property @xmath3 , independently of the specific features of the apparatus measuring @xmath2 .",
    "hence a detection probability is associated with the measurement of @xmath2 which depends on the microstate of @xmath1 , not only on @xmath3 , and must not be mistook for the detection probability that occurs because of the reduced efficiencies of the real measuring apparatuses .",
    "the introduction of a detection probability depending on the set of all microscopic properties possessed by a physical object is crucial and distinguishes the esr model from other hidden variables theories in the literature ( though some assumptions of the esr model have been anticipated by several authors when studying particular cases , see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "it implies that one must add a _ no  registration outcome _",
    "@xmath4 to the set of possible values of any observable @xmath5 of qm , constructing a _ generalized observable _",
    "@xmath6 in which @xmath4 is considered as a possible outcome , providing physical information , whenever a measurement of @xmath6 is performed on a physical object @xmath1 ( we stress that @xmath4 occurs also in the case of _ idealized _ measurements , which correspond to the _ ideal first kind _ measurements of qm in the esr model ) . but",
    "the esr model does not say anything about the deep causes of the detection probability associated with the microstate of the physical object : rather , introduces it as an overall effect of such causes . at a statistical level",
    "the introduction implies that detection probabilities occur , to be considered as unknown parameters , whose value is not predicted by any existing theory .",
    "the occurrence of such parameters implies some relevant consequences @xcite , that can be resumed as follows .",
    "\\(i ) quantum probabilities can be reinterpreted in such a way that one can recover the mathematical formalism of standard ( hilbert space ) qm within the noncontextual ( hence local ) framework of the esr model . to be precise ,",
    "the probability of a property @xmath2 in a given quantum state @xmath7 is interpreted as referring to the subset of all physical objects for which the values of the hidden variables ( microscopic properties only in the case of a deterministic esr model ) are such that the objects are detected when @xmath2 is measured , and not to the set of all physical objects that are actually prepared in the state @xmath7 ( in this sense we say that quantum probabilities must be interpreted as _ conditional _ , not _ absolute _ ) .",
    "\\(ii ) because of noncontextuality , the standard distinction between _ actual _ and _ potential _ properties of a physical system in a given state does not occur in the esr model .",
    "the objectification problem of the quantum theory of measurement disappears , together with such paradoxes as `` schrdinger s cat '' and `` wigner s friend '' , because all properties are _ objective _ : the measurement ( or the observer ) does not actualize them , and the values of the generalized observables of the physical system can be thought of as assigned for each physical object , independently of any measurement ( but , of course , it is impossible to predict all of them even if the quantum state of the object is specified ) .",
    "\\(iii ) the detection probabilities introduced by the esr model can be hardly distinguished from the inefficiencies of real measuring apparatuses , which explains why the former are ignored in qm . but",
    "the introduction of these detection probabilities implies also predictions that substantially differ from those of qm and make the esr model _ falsifiable_. in particular , it implies upper limits to the detection inefficiencies in the experiments on bell s inequalities that can be experimentally checked , at least in principle .",
    "\\(iv ) more generally , if one reconsiders the physical situation considered by clauser , horne , shimony and holt to obtain their version of bell s inequality @xcite ( briefly , _ bchsh inequality _ ) from the point of view of the esr model , one gets a _ modified bchsh inequality_. by introducing some additional assumptions one can then prove that this new inequality may hold together with ( suitably reinterpreted ) standard quantum results , for it refers to the set of all physical objects that are prepared , while the quantum results refer to the set of all physical objects that can be detected .",
    "thus the known opposition between bchsh inequality and quantum predictions is overcome , yet in a framework in which physical properties are objective , hence `` local realism '' holds .",
    "the above conclusions have been achieved without providing an explicit mathematical representation of the new physical entities introduced by the esr model at a macroscopic level .",
    "we have recently supplied such a representation , deducing from it several relevant theoretical consequences .",
    "some of the obtained results have been already published @xcite , some are still in print @xcite or unpublished .",
    "we propose in this paper a short review on the present status of this part of our research , stressing the contribution that the esr model can give to solve or avoid some known problems of qm . in detail , the outline of the paper is the following .",
    "we resume in sect .",
    "[ modello ] the essentials of the esr model to make the paper self  consistent",
    ". then we supply in sect .",
    "[ generalizedformalism ] a new proof that each generalized observable must be represented by a family of ( commutative ) positive operator valued measures , parametrized by the set of all pure states of the physical system @xmath0 , and repropose in sect .",
    "[ genprojpost_measproc ] a _ generalized projection postulate _ ( gpp ) , which rules the transformations of pure states induced by idealized nondestructive measurements . these results allow us to prove in sect .",
    "[ disgeneralizzate ] that the modified bchsh inequality can coexist with quantum predictions , avoiding the additional assumptions mentioned in ( iv )",
    ". moreover we show in sect .",
    "[ gen_obse_mixed_case ] that a new representation of mixtures must be introduced in the esr model that does not coincide with the standard representation in qm , because each mixture has to be represented by a family of density operators parametrized by the set of all physical properties of @xmath0 .",
    "hence we prove in sect . [",
    "ignorance ] that the esr model establishes a one  to ",
    "one correspondence between the operational definition of a mixture and its mathematical representation , which implies that an _ ignorance interpretation _ of mixtures is possible that avoids some deep problems arising from the representation of mixtures provided by qm .",
    "thus we can propose in sect .",
    "[ gpp_mixed_case ] a _ generalized lders postulate _ ( glp ) which generalizes gpp in the case of mixtures .",
    "finally we provide in sect .",
    "[ justification ] a partial dynamical justification of gpp , which introduces nonlinear evolution and avoids the problematic distinction between _ proper _ and _ improper _ mixtures .",
    "let us close this section with a remark .",
    "the esr model recovers noncontextuality ( hence locality ) by considering only _ idealized _ measurements .",
    "it has been proven by various authors that , whenever actual measurements are considered , contextuality may follow from a statistical description of the experiments on spatially separated systems that adopts a multi ",
    "kolmogorovian rather than a simple kolmogorovian model as the most natural choice for this class of experiments .",
    "this form of contextuality has not a quantum basis and may appear also in classical theories .",
    "it occurs , in particular , in the vxj interpretation of qm @xcite , which , as the esr model , is `` local '' and `` realistic '' , and yet predicts experimental violations of bell s inequalities ( a wave model that explains how this breakdown may happen if the measurement apparatuses have thresholds has been recently provided @xcite ) . in the esr model",
    "a nonproblematic form of contextuality could occur if actual , not only idealized , measurements were considered by introducing additional hidden variables associated with the measuring apparatuses , in agreement with the vxj view .",
    "as we have anticipated in sect .",
    "[ intro ] , we resume in this section the essentials of the esr model , focusing on the features that are needed in the rest of the paper .",
    "more detailed presentations of the model can be found in @xcite .    according to the esr model , every _ physical system _",
    "@xmath0 is characterized at a microscopic level by a set @xmath8 of _ microscopic properties _ which are in one  to ",
    "one correspondence with the macroscopic properties introduced by standard qm , play the role of theoretical entities ( _ i.e. _ , they have no direct physical interpretation ) and are such that , for every individual example of @xmath0 ( or _ physical object _ ) @xmath1 , every @xmath9 either is possessed or it is not possessed by @xmath1 , independently of any measurement procedure .",
    "therefore each microscopic property @xmath3 can be associated with a noncontextual dichotomic _",
    "hidden variable _ , which takes value @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) if @xmath3 is possessed ( not possessed ) by the physical object @xmath1 that is considered .",
    "the set of microscopic properties possessed by @xmath1 then defines its _ microscopic state _ , which also plays the role of a theoretical entity .",
    "hence , each microscopic state can be seen as the value of a hidden variable @xmath12 specifying all microscopic properties of @xmath1 . whenever a measurement of a macroscopic property is performed on a physical object @xmath1 ,",
    "the microscopic state of @xmath1 determines a probability ( which is either 0 or 1 if the esr model is _ deterministic _ ) that the macroscopic apparatus does not react , or , equivalently , that the apparatus remains in its _ ready state _ and its pointer does not move from its initial position @xmath4 .",
    "but , then , @xmath4 can be considered as a further possible outcome which provides a peculiar information about @xmath1 , because it informs us that the set of the values of the hidden variables ( microscopic properties only if the esr model is deterministic ) is such that @xmath1 can not be detected .",
    "this interpretation of @xmath4 suggests that a _ no  registration outcome _ must be added to the set of all possible outcomes of any macroscopic observable .",
    "hence we characterize the physical system @xmath0 at a macroscopic level by means of a conventional set @xmath13 of _ macroscopic states _ and a new set @xmath14 of _ generalized observables_. each state @xmath15 is operationally defined as a class of physically equivalent _ preparing devices _",
    "@xcite which are such that every preparing device @xmath16 , when constructed and activated , performs a preparation of a physical object @xmath1 ( we briefly say that `` @xmath1 is in the state @xmath7 '' in this case ) .",
    "each generalized observable @xmath17 is operationally defined as a class of physically equivalent _ measuring apparatuses _ , and it is obtained in the esr model by considering an observable @xmath5 of qm with set of possible outcomes @xmath18 on the real line @xmath19 and adding a further outcome @xmath20 ( _ no  registration outcome _ of @xmath6 ) , so that the set of all possible values of @xmath6 is @xmath21 . is non  void .",
    "this assumption is not restrictive . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath22 , one can choose a bijective borel function @xmath23 such that @xmath24 ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath25 ) and replace @xmath5 by @xmath26 .",
    "[ borel_sets ] ]    let now @xmath27 be the @xmath28algebra of all borel subsets of @xmath19 .",
    "the set @xmath29 is the set of all _ macroscopic properties _ of @xmath0 , for any pair @xmath30 is interpreted as the property that the value of @xmath6 belongs to @xmath31 .",
    "hence the subset of all macroscopic properties associated with observables of qm ( which bijectively corresponds to the set @xmath8 of all microscopic properties , as we have assumed above ) is @xmath32    a measurement of a macroscopic property @xmath33 on a physical object @xmath1 in the state @xmath7 is then described as a _ registration _ performed by means of a _ dichotomic registering device _ ( which may be constructed by using one of the apparatuses associated with @xmath6 ) whose outcomes are denoted by _ yes _ and",

    "the interested reader can refer to @xcite.[intrinsic_feat ] ] the symbol @xmath40 in eq .",
    "( [ formuladipartenza ] ) denotes instead the probability that @xmath1 display @xmath2 when it is detected .",
    "the following assumption is then basic in the esr model .",
    "if @xmath7 is a pure state the probability @xmath40 can be evaluated by using the same rules that yield the probability of @xmath2 in the state @xmath7 according to qm . _",
    "assumption ax allows one to recover the formalism of qm in the framework of the esr model , but modifies the standard interpretation of quantum probabilities . indeed , according to qm ,",
    "whenever an ideal measurement of a property @xmath2 is performed , all physical objects that are prepared in a state @xmath7 are detected .",
    "the quantum rules for calculating probabilities are thus intuitively interpreted as yielding the probability that a physical object @xmath1 display the property @xmath2 whenever it is selected in the set of all objects in the state @xmath7 , and in this sense we say that they provide _ absolute _ probabilities in qm .",
    "according to assumption ax , instead , if @xmath7 is pure , the same rules yield the probability that a physical object @xmath1 display the property @xmath2 whenever it is selected in the subset of all objects in the state @xmath7 that can be detected , and in this sense we say that they provide _ conditional _ probabilities in the esr model .",
    "this reinterpretation implies that the predictions of the esr model may be different from those of qm , even if the formalism of qm is embodied in the model .    to complete our discussion ,",
    "let us now consider a macroscopic property @xmath41 , hence @xmath42 , and put @xmath43 , @xmath33 , @xmath44 .",
