    "recently , a lot of attention has been devoted to understanding the nature of dynamical heterogeneities in supercooled liquids @xcite .",
    "many numerical experiments have found long lived dynamical structures which are characterized by a typical length and a typical relaxation time which depend on the values of the external parameters ( temperature and density ) .",
    "a way to quantify this dynamical heterogeneities is in terms of the 4-point density function , and its associated non - linear susceptibility , which show power law behavior as one approaches the mode coupling temperature @xmath0 from above . in this paper",
    "we review the details of the theoretical calculations of this function put forward in @xcite and discuss some new results .    at the glass transition one",
    "observes freezing of density fluctuations .",
    "the function @xmath1 is often regarded as the edwards - anderson order parameter signaling the onset of glassiness .",
    "it is therefore quite natural to try to interpret the dynamical heterogehinities and the correlation length in terms of fluctuations of the order parameter , and study the 4-point function @xmath2 ^ 2\\rangle-\\langle ( \\rho(x+y)-\\overline{\\rho})(\\rho(y)-\\overline{\\rho})\\rangle^2,\\ ] ] and its related non - linear susceptibility @xmath3 . to our knowledge the first proposal to study the 4-point function to identify a growing correlation length in structural glasses was in @xcite in the context of a numerical study of a lennard - jones liquid .",
    "there no sign of growing correlation was found , probably because of the insufficient thermalization .",
    "however , more accurate measurements @xcite show that there is a dynamical correlation length which grows as @xmath0 is approached .    here",
    "we would like to investigate theoretically the behavior this function in the context of the picture of the glass transition that comes out from the study of disordered mean - field models @xcite , and from some approximation scheme of molecular liquids @xcite .",
    "in mean field disordered systems one finds that decreasing the temperature from the liquid phase , two different transitions appear : a dynamical transition at a temperature @xmath0 , and a static ( kauzmann - like ) transition at a lower temperature @xmath4 . at the dynamical transition @xmath0 , identified with the mode coupling theory @xcite transition temperature ,",
    "equilibrium density fluctuations freeze and ergodicity breaks down .",
    "below that temperature , the boltzmann distribution is decomposed in an exponentially large number of ergodic components @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath6 , the logarithm of the number of these components is the configurational entropy , which decreases for decreasing temperatures , and the `` static '' transition signals the point where @xmath7 .",
    "dynamically , a non zero edwards - anderson order parameter signals freezing .    as it has been",
    "many times remarked , this theory misses the existence of local activated processes which restore ergodicity below @xmath0 .",
    "these can be included phenomenologically to complete the picture .",
    "we will suppose that the ergodic components which the ideal theory predicts below @xmath0 become in real systems metastable states ( or quasistates ) , capable to confine the system for some large , but finite times on given portions of the configuration space .",
    "the inclusion of activated processes , although done by hand , has far reaching consequences .",
    "the foundation of the notion of quasistates is based on the time scale separation ( as it can be seen in the shape of the structure function ) , which allows to consider `` fast '' degrees of freedom quasi - equilibrated , before the `` slow '' degrees of freedom can move .",
    "so , this notion applies below as well as above @xmath0 , where the two step relaxation is predicted even by the ideal theory .",
    "this point has been recently stressed in @xcite in a different context . both above and below @xmath0",
    "we can talk of quasistates in which the system equilibrates almost completely before relaxing further .",
    "the typical life time of the quasistate will be of the order of the alpha relaxation time @xmath8 .",
    "our basic observation is that within the described theoretical framework , the quasistates correspond to highly correlated regions of the configuration space , typical configurations belonging to the same quasistate would appear to be highly correlated . on the other hand , configurations belonging to distant quasistates as the ones which correspond to large time separation @xmath9 , show typically low correlations .",
    "we argue then , that the dynamical correlation length and susceptibility observed in the simulations referred to above , can be estimated by the corresponding quantities within a quasistate . on the other hand , the long time limit of the same quantities ,",
    "i.e. the value reached for times much larger then the lifetime of the quasistates , correspond to maximally distant quasistates .",
    "this predicts maximal fluctuations and heterogeneity on a time scale of the order of @xmath10 .",
    "in this section , we address the question on how to compute correlation functions within singles quasistates , reviewing some `` recipes '' that were put forward in @xcite .",
    "let us consider the case of mean - field spin glass models below @xmath0 , where there is true ergodicity breaking and the quasistates are true ergodic components .",
    "suppose to be above @xmath4 so that the configurational entropy @xmath11 . given any local observable @xmath12 , its boltzmann average can be decomposed as @xmath13 where the index @xmath14 runs over all the @xmath15 states , the weights of the different states @xmath16 would all be of the same order @xmath17 . in the following we will be interested to compute space averages ( correlation functions ) among local observables , @xmath18 .",
    "if by @xmath19 we mean boltzmann average , we can expand each of the two averages according to ( [ deco ] ) and find that @xmath20 which , due to the fact that the number of ergodic components is exponentially large , is dominated by the terms in the double sum with @xmath21 .",
    "our major interest will be to compute instead averages of the kind @xmath22 i.e. correlation function in the same ergodic component . to this purpose",
    "we can use a _ conditional _ boltzmann prescription @xcite , where one fixes a reference configuration @xmath23 , and only the configurations @xmath24 similar enough to the reference configuration are given a non vanishing weight .",
    "let us consider as a notion of similarity among two configurations @xmath25 and @xmath26 the function , that we call overlap , @xmath27 where :    * @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) is the microscopic density corresponding to the configuration @xmath30 : @xmath31 * the function @xmath32 is a short range sigmoid ( or step ) function such that if @xmath33 denotes the typical radius of the particles , @xmath32 is close to 1 for @xmath34 and close to zero otherwise .",
    "the value of @xmath35 gives a notion of overlap not too sensitive to small atomic displacements .",
    "notice that with this definition @xmath36 is maximal if @xmath37 , while it is equal to zero if @xmath25 and @xmath26 are uncorrelated .",
    "notice also that one can write @xmath38 , a form which is manifestly invariant under permutations of the particles .",
    "suppose now to fix a reference configuration @xmath26 , chosen with boltzmann probability at temperature @xmath39 , and consider the conditional probability @xmath40 where the constrained partition function is @xmath41 as @xmath26 by hypothesis is an equilibrium configuration , it will belong to some quasistate @xmath14 , so , if we choose @xmath42 as the typical overlap among configurations in this quasistate ( with probability one almost all configurations have the same overlap ) , i.e. the edwards - anderson parameter of the state @xmath43 , we will be able to compute the quasistate averages : given two observables @xmath44 and @xmath45 we can write : @xmath46 notice that , if on the other hand in ( [ cond ] ) we would choose @xmath42 as the typical overlap among different quasistates , the constraint would be completely irrelevant and we could get the boltzmann average ( [ bb ] ) .    notice that the overlap we consider , is a masked integral of the density - density correlation function among the two configurations @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "we are interested to study the fluctuation of this quantity , which is the following integral of the 4-point function : @xmath47 where we have denoted with the angular brackets the conditional average with the distribution ( [ cond ] ) , and with the bar the average over the canonical distribution of the reference configuration @xmath26 .    within this formalism , the generating functional of the correlation functions is the constrained free - energy @xmath48    this function has been computed in various models having a glass transition , including mean field disordered models and simple liquids in the hnc approximation , all giving consistent results @xcite .",
    "the shape of @xmath49 as a function of @xmath42 allows to distinguish among liquid and glass phase .",
    "we show the potential in figure [ hnc ] for hard spheres in the hnc approximation .    in the liquid phase at high temperature , the potential is convex with a unique minimum for @xmath50 which corresponds to the typical overlap among random liquid configurations .",
    "lowering the temperature , the potential looses the convexity , until , when @xmath0 is reached , it develops a secondary minimum , at a high value of @xmath42 .",
    "the height of the secondary minimum with respect to the first one is related to the configurational entropy by : @xmath51 , which vanishes at @xmath4 .",
    "to    a remarkable fact that has been often discussed @xcite , is that while the properties of the low @xmath42 minimum reflect the properties of the full boltzmann average , the properties of the high @xmath42 minimum reflect the properties of averages in a single ergodic component .    in the shape of the potential",
    "the mc transition appears as a spinodal point and as such it has a divergent susceptibility .",
    "in fact , general relations in the effective potential theory , imply that the susceptibility is given just by the inverse curvature of the potential in the minimum , i.e. @xmath52 .",
    "this quantity , diverges for @xmath53 , which , in turn , implies the divergence of the spatial range of the correlations .",
    "generically , in all the model studied , the slope of the flex vanishes linearly for @xmath53 , implying @xmath54 with a mean field exponent @xmath55 .",
    "we notice that @xmath56 computed in the primary minimum represents the boltzmann average of the order parameter fluctuations and is completely regular at @xmath0 .    in figure [ figure2 ]",
    "we see the susceptibility computed with this procedure ( circles ) , which shows a divergence at @xmath0 .    to",
    "the idea of considering a system coupled with a reference configuration can also be used in dynamics to compute the time dependent susceptibility . in this context",
    "it is convenient to couple with the initial configuration @xmath57 .",
    "consider a system at equilibrium at time zero with respect to the hamiltonian @xmath58 which evolves for positive times with the modified hamiltonian @xmath59    for small @xmath60 , linear response theory at equilibrium implies that @xmath61    the problem of studying the evolution of a system with hamiltonian ( [ htot ] ) can in principle be issued within any dynamical approximation scheme ( e.g. mct ) .",
    "however for the time being we have only addressed the problem in the context of the p - spin model , which , for all the present purposes should capture the essential features of the function @xmath62 . clearly , lacking completely in the model any spatial structure , in order to infer from the behavior of @xmath56 something about a correlation length we need to resort to eq . @xmath63 .",
    "the p - spin model @xcite describes @xmath64 interacting variables @xmath65 ( spins ) on the sphere @xmath66 , with hamiltonian @xmath67 where the couplings are random independent gaussian variables with zero mean and variance @xmath68 .",
    "the appropriate notion of overlap for this system is @xmath69 . for this model",
    "it is customary to consider langevin dynamics , which in our case will be performed with hamiltonian @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is an equilibrium initial condition .",
    "@xmath72 where @xmath73 is a white noise with amplitude @xmath74 and @xmath75 is a lagrange multiplier which ensures the spherical constraint at all times .    using standard manipulations based on the martin - siggia - rose functional integral ,",
    "one can write a self consistent equation for a single spin which , using the notation @xmath76 , reads :    @xmath77    where @xmath78 is a colored gaussian noise with variance @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 are the correlation and response functions of the system , to be determined self - consistently by @xmath82 , @xmath83 .",
    "the detailed derivation of ( [ leff ] ) is rather standard ( see e.g. @xcite ) and we do not reproduce it here .    from ( [ leff ] )",
    ", taking the correlations with @xmath84 and @xmath85 one can derive equations for @xmath80 and @xmath81 , which read , for @xmath86 @xmath87 together with the equation specifying the time dependence of @xmath75 @xmath88 equations ( [ cr],[mu ] ) form a complete set , that can be solved numerically , to derive the value of @xmath62 as @xmath89 with a simpl step - by - step integration @xcite we could reach times of the order of 1000 .",
    "this allowed us , in the case @xmath90 , to compute the function @xmath62 down to temperature @xmath91 , compared with a critical temperature @xmath92 .",
    "more sophisticated algorithms ( see the contribution of latz to these proceedings ) will allow in the next future to approach the critical temperature much more .",
    "our results for the function @xmath62 are displayed in figure [ figure3 ] for various temperatures .",
    "we see that @xmath93 has a maximum which becomes higher and higher as the temperature is lowered , and is pushed towards larger and larger times .",
    "this is the behavior that qualitatively is seen in the numerical simulations @xcite .    to    as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite we define @xmath94 as the time at which @xmath95 is maximum , we find that @xmath96 exhibit a divergence at @xmath0 , as it is presented in figure [ figure2 ] . both quantities behave as powers of @xmath97 @xmath98 , @xmath99 .",
    "a best fit gives the values @xmath100 , @xmath101 .",
    "in this paper we have reviewed the analysis of the non linear susceptibility in supercooled liquids and glasses that comes from the mean field theory of disordered systems , and liquid models in the hnc approximation .",
    "the theory predicts that while the long time , equilibrium susceptibility remains finite and is regular at all temperatures , the finite time susceptibility displays a maximum as a function of time which becomes higher and higher and displaced to larger and larger times for temperatures close to @xmath0 .",
    "this behavior is a consequence of the critical character of the mode coupling like dynamical transition predicted by the ideal theory described in this paper .",
    "i real systems one can expect a similar behavion but with a round off of the divergence .",
