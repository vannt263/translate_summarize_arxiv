    "a major goal of measurements at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) is to quantify the properties of the qcd matter created in heavy - ion collisions at high energy  @xcite . unlike quarks and gluons",
    ", photons do not fragment into hadrons and can be directly observed as a final state particle .",
    "furthermore , due to their negligible coupling to the qcd matter in contrast to hadrons , direct photons are considered as a calibrated probe for the qcd medium .",
    "the previous measurements at rhic indicate unexpected finite values of azimuthal elliptic anisotropy parameter @xmath12 of charged hadrons at high-@xmath1  @xcite .",
    "the measured @xmath12 at high-@xmath1 is beyond the applicability of hydrodynamic models , and the path - length dependence of jet quenching is the only proposed explanation of @xmath12 at high-@xmath1  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath13 measurement would provide a gauge for the energy loss at high-@xmath1 .",
    "the high-@xmath1 @xmath0 sample unbiased spatial distribution of the hard scattering vertices in the qcd medium  @xcite , in contrast to hadrons which suffer from the geometric biases .",
    "therefore , a comparison between the spectra of the away - side charged hadrons associated with @xmath0 vs. @xmath4 can provide a benchmark for the energy loss and its dependence on the path - length .",
    "although the previous measurements have indicated similar level and pattern of suppression for the away - side of @xmath0 and @xmath4  @xcite , the current work explores a softer region in the fragmentation functions where a more significant difference is expected  @xcite .",
    "the star detector is well suited for measuring azimuthal angular correlations due to the large coverage in pseudorapidity and full coverage in azimuth ( @xmath14 ) . while the barrel electromagnetic calorimeter ( bemc )  @xcite measures the electromagnetic energy with high resolution , the barrel shower maximum detector ( bsmd ) provides fine spatial resolution and enhances the rejection power for the hadrons . the time projection chamber ( tpc : @xmath15 )",
    "@xcite identifies charged particles , measures their momenta , and allows for a charged - particle veto cut with the bemc matching . the forward time projection chamber ( ftpc : @xmath8 )  @xcite is used to measure the charged particles momenta and to reconstruct the event plane angle . using the bemc to select events ( _ i.e. _  trigger \" ) with high-@xmath1 @xmath16 , the star experiment collected an integrated luminosity of 23  @xmath17b@xmath18 of p+p collisions in 2009 and 973  @xmath19b@xmath18 of au+au collisions in 2011 . in this analysis , events having a primary vertex within @xmath20 cm of the center of the tpc along the beamline in au+au and @xmath21 cm in p+p are selected .",
    "in addition , each event must have at least one electromagnetic cluster with @xmath22  gev for the event plane correlation analysis and @xmath23  gev for the charged hadron correlation analysis .",
    "more than 97@xmath24 of these clusters have deposited energy greater than 0.5 gev in each layer of the bsmd .",
    "a trigger tower is rejected if it has a track with @xmath25  gev/@xmath7 pointing to it , which reduces the number of the electromagnetic clusters by only @xmath26% .",
    "the @xmath27 is determined using the standard method  @xcite : @xmath28 where the brackets denote statistical averaging over particles and events , @xmath29 is the azimuthal angle of the neutral particle with certain value of @xmath1 , and @xmath30 is the azimuthal angle of the event plane .",
    "the event plane is reconstructed from charged particles , within the detector acceptance , with @xmath31  gev/@xmath7 , and determined by @xmath32 where @xmath33 are the azimuthal angles of all the particles used to define the event plane . in this analysis ,",
    "the charged - track quality criteria are similar to those used in previous star analyses  @xcite .",
    "the event plane is measured using two different detectors in their pseudorapidity coverage : 1 ) using all the selected tracks inside the tpc , and 2 ) using all tracks inside the ftpc in order to reduce the ",
    "non - flow \" contributions ( azimuthal correlations not related to the event plane ) .",
    "since the event plane is only an approximation to the true reaction plane , the observed correlation is divided by the event plane resolution .",
    "the event plane resolution is estimated using the sub - event method in which the full event is divided up randomly into two sub - events as described in  @xcite .",
    "biases due to the non - uniform acceptance of the detector are removed according to the method in  @xcite .",
    "the azimuthal correlations of a neutral trigger particle with charged hadrons , measured as the number of associated particles per neutral cluster per @xmath34 ( `` correlation functions '' ) , are used in both p+p and au+au collisions to determine the ( jet ) associated particle yields in the near- ( @xmath35 0 ) and away - sides ( @xmath35 @xmath36 ) . the near- and away - side yields , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , of associated particles per trigger are extracted by integrating the @xmath39 distributions over @xmath40 @xmath41  0.63 and @xmath42 @xmath41  0.63 , respectively . the yield is corrected for the tracking efficiency of charged particles as a function of event multiplicity .      a crucial part of the analysis is to discriminate between showers from @xmath0 and two close @xmath16 s from high-@xmath1 @xmath4 symmetric decays . at @xmath43  gev/@xmath7 , the angular separation between the two @xmath16 s resulting from a @xmath4 decay is small , but a @xmath4 shower is generally broader than a single @xmath16 shower .",
    "the bsmd is capable of @xmath44/@xmath45 separation up to @xmath46  gev/@xmath7 due to its high granularity ( @xmath47 , @xmath48 ) .",
    "the shower shape is quantified as the cluster energy , measured by the bemc , normalized by the position - weighted energy moment , measured by the bsmd strips  @xcite .",
    "the shower profile cuts were tuned to obtain a nearly @xmath0-free ( @xmath49 ) sample and a sample rich in @xmath0 ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "since the shower - shape analysis is only effective for rejecting two close @xmath16 showers , the @xmath50 sample contains a mixture of direct photons and contamination from fragmentation photons ( @xmath51 ) and photons from asymmetric hadron ( @xmath52 and @xmath53 ) decays .",
    "the @xmath54 and @xmath55 are measured as discussed in section 2.2 and the away ( near)-side yields of associated particles per @xmath50 and @xmath49 triggers ( @xmath56 and @xmath57 ) are measured as discussed in section 2.3 .",
    "assuming zero near - side yield for @xmath0 triggers and a sample of @xmath49 free of @xmath0 , the @xmath13 is given by : @xmath59 where @xmath60=@xmath61 , and the numbers of @xmath62 and @xmath50 triggers are represented by @xmath63 and @xmath64 respectively .",
    "although the @xmath60 quantity approximates all background triggers in the @xmath50 sample to the measured @xmath49 triggers , all background to @xmath0 is subtracted assuming that all background triggers have the same correlation function as the @xmath49 sample  @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath60 is measured in  @xcite and found to be @xmath65 in central au+au . in eq .",
    "3 all background sources for @xmath0 are assumed to have the same @xmath12 as the measured @xmath4 .",
    "+   +    figures 1 and 2 show the @xmath66 and @xmath67 for ( @xmath6  gev/@xmath7 ) from au+au data set of run 2011 using the tpc ( @xmath15 ) and ftpc ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the results of fig .",
    "1 are consistent with those from different star data set of run 2007  @xcite , and the results of fig .",
    "2 agree with other measurements  @xcite . while using the ftpc in determining the event plane ( fig .",
    "2 ) the @xmath13 is consistent with zero .",
    "assuming the dominant source of direct photons is prompt hard production , the zero value implies no remaining bias in the event - plane determination .",
    "accordingly , the measured value of @xmath66 would be the effect of path - length dependent energy loss .",
    "assuming zero near - side yield for @xmath0 triggers and a sample of @xmath49 free of @xmath0 , the away - side yield of hadrons correlated with the @xmath0 is extracted as @xmath68 here , @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the away ( near)-side yields of associated particles per @xmath50 and @xmath49 triggers , respectively .",
    "the ratio @xmath69 is equivalent to the fraction of `` background '' triggers in the @xmath50 trigger sample , and @xmath70 and @xmath64 are the numbers of @xmath0 and @xmath50 triggers , respectively .",
    "the value of @xmath69 is found to be @xmath71 in p+p and decreases to @xmath65 in central au+au with little dependence on @xmath72 .",
    "all background to @xmath0 is subtracted with the assumption that the background triggers have the same correlation function as the @xmath49 sample .    in order to quantify the away - side suppression ,",
    "we calculate the quantity @xmath73 , which is defined as the ratio of the integrated yield of the away - side associated particles per trigger particle in au+au to that in p+p collisions .",
    "the values of @xmath74 and @xmath75 , as shown in fig . 3 ,",
    "are @xmath76 ( @xmath77 independent in agreement with results of  @xcite where the recoiled parton from @xmath0 and @xmath4 experience constant fractional energy loss in the qcd medium .",
    "it is also observed that the charged hadron spectra recoiled from @xmath0 show unexpectedly more suppression than those recoiled from @xmath4 @xmath9 within the covered kinematics range @xmath10  gev/@xmath7 and @xmath11  gev/@xmath7 .",
    "the star experiment has reported the first @xmath13 at high-@xmath1 ( @xmath6  gev/@xmath7 ) , and explored new kinematic range ( @xmath10  gev/@xmath7 ) and ( @xmath11  gev/@xmath7 ) for @xmath73 measurements of @xmath78 correlations at @xmath3  gev . using the mid - rapidity detectors in determining the event plane ,",
    "the measured value of @xmath13 is non - zero , and is probably due to biases in the event - plane determination .",
    "using the forward detectors in determining the event plane could eliminate remaining biases , and the measured @xmath13 is consistent with zero .",
    "the zero value of @xmath13 suggests a negligible contribution of jet - medium photons  @xcite , and negligible effects of @xmath79  @xcite on the @xmath67 over the covered kinematics range .",
    "the measured finite value of @xmath55 , using the forward detectors in determining the event plane , is apparently due to the path - length dependence of energy loss .",
    "the @xmath78 correlation results indicate that the associated charged hadron spectra recoiled from @xmath0 show more suppression than those recoiled from @xmath4 @xmath9 within the covered kinematic range , in contrast to the theoretical predictions  @xcite .",
    "the disagreement with the theoretical expectations may indicate that the lost energy is distributed to lower @xmath1 of the associated particles in the case of a @xmath0 trigger than a @xmath4 trigger . to further test this",
    ", one must explore the region of low @xmath80 and @xmath76 .",
