    "one possible way to understand the left - right asymmetry of elementary particles is to enlarge the standard model into a left - right symmetric structure and then , by some spontaneously broken mechanism , to recover the low energy asymmetric world .",
    "there are three main points in this proposal : the choice of the gauge group , the higgs sector and the fundamental fermionic representation .",
    "left - right models starting from the gauge group @xmath5 were developed by many authors @xcite and are well known to be consistent with the standard @xmath6 model .",
    "this group can be part of more general models , like some grand unified groups @xcite , superstring inspired models @xcite , a connection between parity and the strong @xmath7 problem @xcite , left - right extended standard models @xcite .",
    "all these approaches imply the existence of some new intermediate physical mass scale , well bellow the unification or the planck mass scale .",
    "for the higgs sector there are some options .",
    "two higgs doublets that transform as fields in the left and right sectors can be supposed to be spontaneously broken at scales @xmath8 and at a larger scale @xmath9 respectively .",
    "the earlier left - right symmetric models added a new higgs in the mixed representation @xmath10 , for @xmath11 .",
    "the symmetry breaking of this field gives a mixing in the charged vector boson sector ( not yet experimentally verified ) and could also be responsible for neutrino masses .",
    "the increasing experimental evidence on neutrino oscillations and nonzero masses has motivated a renewed interest in the mechanisms for parity breaking .",
    "more recently it was shown that all fermion masses could be obtained with only two higgs doublets @xcite .",
    "the basic mechanism for this model is the dimension-5 operator built by weinberg years ago @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to build mirror models with two higgs doublets and new higgs singlets @xcite . in this case",
    "charged fermion masses can be understood as a result of a see - saw mechanism .    throughout this paper",
    "we call models with two higgs doublets `` minimal models '' in the sense that they have the minimal set of new scale parameters that are shown to be consistent with the standard @xmath12 theory .    for the fermion spectrum",
    "there is no unique choice of the fundamental fermionic representation .",
    "earlier left - right models restored parity by choosing the right - handed sector as doublets under @xmath13 with @xmath14 and @xmath15 as the upper components of the right doublet .",
    "other models have doubled the number of fundamental fermions choosing the new sector with opposite chirality relative to the standard model sector .    in this paper",
    "we present models that start by the simple gauge structure of @xmath5 and investigate the consequences of the minimal higgs sector that breaks the left - right symmetry .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we review the main assumptions for the higgs and gauge sector in the minimal left - right model ; in section 3 we review the properties of new fermion representation ; in section 4 we show some phenomenological consequences for testing the models here proposed and in section 5 we give our conclusions .",
    "left - right models with only two higgs doublets have been previously considered @xcite .",
    "we review in this section the main points that are relevant for the new neutral current interactions .",
    "the minimal left - right symmetric model contains the following higgs scalars :    @xmath16    with transformation properties under @xmath17    @xmath18    the first stage of symmetry breaking occurs when @xmath19 acquires its vacuum expectation value @xmath20 , leaving a remnant @xmath21 symmetry coming from the @xmath22 sector , whose generator is given by the relation @xmath23 , with @xmath24 . the breakdown to @xmath25 is realized , at the scale @xmath26 , through the following vacuum expectation value :    @xmath27    in order to analyze the couplings of the additional neutral gauge boson we rewrite here the free lagrangian for the gauge fields and the piece containing the covariant derivatives of the scalar fields    @xmath28-\\frac{1}{2}tr[g_{r\\mu\\nu}^ag_r^{a,\\mu\\nu}]\\\\   \\mathcal{l}_d & = & ( d_{\\mu}\\chi_l)^{\\dagger}d^{\\mu}\\chi_l+(d_{\\mu}\\chi_r)^{\\dagger}d^{\\mu}\\chi_r,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath29,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath30 the gauge coupling constants related to the gauge group @xmath31 , are respectively @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 . when substituting the vacuum expectation values for the scalar fields in @xmath35 , one obtains the gauge bosons mass terms .",
    "explicitly , the mass matrix for the neutral sector in the basis @xmath36 is @xmath37 the mass matrix @xmath38 is diagonalized by an orthogonal transformation @xmath39 which connects the weak fields ( @xmath40 ) to the physical ones ( @xmath41 ) . by direct calculation from the neutral mass matrix",

    "this simplification reduces the number of the arbitrary gauge coupling to two .",

    "the expected resonance peaks associated with these @xmath149 values are clearly shown in the picture , as well as the @xmath152 sm peak .",
    "it is interesting to note that the peaks of the mlrm cross sections are greater than those of the slrm cross sections , because the @xmath153 total width is smaller in the mlrm .",
    "this property can be used to distinguish the two models .",
    "the presence of the new neutral boson @xmath153 is essential to preserve tree - level unitarity in both extended models , leading to cross sections that fall to zero for asymptotically high energies .",
    "next we look at the dependence of the forward - backward asymmetry @xmath154 on @xmath149 .",
    "figures 2 , 3 and 4 show the corresponding curves for the collider energies @xmath140 gev , @xmath2 tev and @xmath3 tev respectively , and the points indicate how the isr affects the asymmetry .",
    "in each case the error bars represent the statistical errors for an integrated luminosity of @xmath140 fb@xmath155 .",
    "the forward - backward asymmetry is quite sensitive to @xmath149 , and can also be used to distinguish mlrm from slrm .",
    "beam polarization is expected to play a very important role at the future linear collider facilities .",
    "with longitudinally polarized electron and positron beams one can effectively enhance the signals of interest , and suppress inconvenient backgrounds , and thus increase the sensitivity of spin - dependent observables to deviations from the sm predictions .",
    "experts usually believe that it should not be too difficult to produce electron beams whose degrees of polarization exceed @xmath156 . as a matter of fact , electron beam polarization routinely reaches values around @xmath157 at slac .",
    "several schemes have been devised to produce polarized positron beams in a linear collider .",
    "although these techniques remain untested , simulations suggest that it is feasible to reach a degree of positron polarization of @xmath158 . in all the calculations considered in the following ,",
    "the degrees of polarization of the electron and positron beams were taken to be @xmath159 and @xmath160 respectively . to illustrate the importance of beam polarization",
    ", it suffices to say that for @xmath161 gev , the polarized cross section @xmath162 is essentially double the unpolarized cross section @xmath163 .",
    "here we define an asymmetry @xmath164 , in terms of the degrees of polarization @xmath165 of the electron and positron beams , and the helicity cross sections :    @xmath166 where the first ( second ) subscript in @xmath167 refers to the electron ( positron ) helicity .",
    "the parity violating left - right asymmetry @xmath168 can be easily obtained from @xmath169 through the relation      figures 5 , 6 and 7 display the behavior of @xmath172 as a function of @xmath149 , for the three energies under study .",
    "the differences between mlrm and slrm asymmetries are considerable , the more so in the resonance region , the deviations from the sm value being larger for the mlrm over the whole @xmath149 range .",
    "as expected , the asymmetries in both models tend to the standard model value for @xmath173 .",
    "if we take into account the lower bound in equation ( 3.14 ) , @xmath174 gev , it seems unlikely that @xmath169 can be used as a measure of the deviations of these models from the sm at the first stage of tesla , in which @xmath175 gev . for a possible tesla extension , where the c.m .",
    "energy could reach @xmath176 gev , detection of these deviations in @xmath164 can not be excluded if @xmath149 is close to the lower bound . for higher values of @xmath139 , as those of nlc ( stage 2 ) and clic , @xmath164 is sensitive to larger values of the @xmath153 boson mass , as long as we exclude the asymptotic region @xmath173 .    in order to determine the discovery limits for a @xmath153 boson via muon pair production ,",
    "we compared the angular distribution @xmath177 predicted by each of the left - right models with the corresponding sm expectation . plots of the angular distribution are shown in figure 8 for the extended models and sm , considering @xmath178 gev , @xmath179 and @xmath160 for @xmath161 gev .",
    "assuming that the experimental data in muon pair production will be well described by the standard model predictions , we defined a one - parameter @xmath180 estimator @xmath181 where @xmath182 is the number of sm events collected in the @xmath183 bin , @xmath184 is the number of events in the @xmath183 bin as predicted by the extended model , and @xmath185 the corresponding total error , which combines in quadrature the poisson - distributed statistical error with the systematic error .",
    "we took @xmath186 to correct for those sources of systematic error not explicitly accounted for in our calculation , such as the luminosity uncertainty , beam energy spread and the uncertainty in the muon detection efficiency .",
    "the angular range @xmath187 was divided into @xmath188 equal - width bins , and the free parameter @xmath189 was varied to determine the @xmath190 distribution .",
    "the @xmath122 confidence level bound corresponds to an increase of the @xmath180 by @xmath191 with respect to the minimum @xmath192 of the distribution .",
    "figure 9 represents the @xmath122 confidence limits on the @xmath193 plane for tesla , nlc and clic .",
    "we have presented an analysis of the effects of a new neutral gauge boson @xmath153 in muon pair production , at the next generation of linear colliders , in the context of two extended electroweak models , the mirror left - right model ( mlrm ) and the symmetric left - right model ( slrm ) .",
    "a number of observables that are sensitive to the presence of such a gauge boson were studied in detail .",
    "these observables were found to be useful to distinguish the two models , should new physics associated with the @xmath153 turn up at high mass scales .",
    "our simulations indicate that longitudinally polarized electron and positron beams can significantly increase event rates and the sensitivity of these observables to the presence of a new neutral gauge boson . starting from the angular distributions of the final @xmath194 , @xmath122 c. l. discovery limits on the @xmath153 mass were derived for the new linear colliders , in terms of the available c.m .",
