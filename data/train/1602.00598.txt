    "the universality principle of the critical exponents is sustained here by the redundant @xcite fixed - point mechanism : although these two fixed points are globally separated in the renormalization - group flow diagram , they have identical critical exponents ( which is furthermore shared by the fixed point of @xmath64 ) , as seen in table i.    at lower values of @xmath52 , the two critical endpoints @xmath46 merge and annihilate .",

    "much higher reentrances have been calculated in the high-@xmath86 superconductivity tj model.@xcite .",
    "it should be noted that our current calculation , showing these complicated reentrances , is exact for the hierarchical lattice with spatial dimension @xmath0 .",
    "as @xmath44 is further increased , the tetracritical point @xmath41 splits into two bicritical points b connected by a first - order transition line between the antiferromagnetic phase @xmath32 and the ferromagnetic phase @xmath26 , as seen in fig . 4 for @xmath87 .",
    "at a ( non - zero - temperature ) bicritical point , normally , two high - temperature second - order boundaries and one low - temperature first - order boundary meet tangentially.@xcite in our present phase diagram , the opposite temperature ordering occurs at the lower - temperature bicritical point .",

    "this first - order behavior is revealed by the accounting of local disorder as effective vacancies @xcite .",
    "for the spin-3/2 ising model , the resulting renormalization - group flows would be in the space of the spin-2 ising model . in fig . 5 , for @xmath103 and @xmath94 , shown in the left and right insets respectively",
