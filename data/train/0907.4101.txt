    "r7.cm     lattice qcd calculations locate the critical point ( cp ) of strongly interacting matter in the sps energy range @xcite .",
    "among the experimental observables proposed to look for the cp are : fluctuations of mean transverse momentum and multiplicity @xcite , transverse mass spectra of baryons and anti - baryons @xcite , pion pair ( sigma mode ) intermittency @xcite , and elliptic flow of baryons and mesons  @xcite  .",
    "a maximum effect of the cp is expected when the freeze - out happens near the critical point .",
    "the @xmath0 phase diagram can be scanned by changing the energy ( @xmath1 ) and the size ( @xmath2 ) of the colliding system ( see fig .",
    "[ cp1cp2 ] ) . the following strategy",
    "was followed by na49 @xcite to look for the cp : an energy scan ( beam energies 20@xmath3 - 158@xmath3 gev ) with central pb+pb collisions , and a study of system size dependence ( different ions ) at 158@xmath3 gev .",
    "at the cp enlarged fluctuations of multiplicity and mean transverse momentum were suggested @xcite . in na49",
    "we used the @xmath4 correlation measure @xcite and the scaled variance of the multiplicity distribution @xmath5 @xcite to study @xmath6 and @xmath7 fluctuations , respectively .",
    "while @xmath4 is independent of @xmath8 fluctuations , @xmath5 is strongly affected by @xmath8 fluctuations . in order to suppress this effect @xcite the scaled variance",
    "@xmath5 was studied for very central ( 1% ) collisions .",
    "figures [ fiptmb ] , [ omegamb ] , [ fiptt ] , and [ omegat ] present the energy ( @xmath1 ) and system size ( @xmath9 ) dependence of @xmath4 and @xmath5 . the chemical freeze - out parameters , @xmath10 and @xmath11 were taken from fits of the hadron gas model @xcite to particle yields .",
    "the lines correspond to critical point predictions with the magnitude of fluctuations at the cp taken from ref.@xcite assuming correlation lengths @xmath12 decreasing monotonically with decreasing system size : a ) @xmath12(pb+pb ) = 6 fm and @xmath12(p+p ) = 2 fm ( dashed lines ) or b ) @xmath12(pb+pb ) = 3 fm and @xmath12(p+p ) = 1 fm ( solid lines ) .",
    "the predictions include corrections by na49 due to the limited rapidity range ( forward - rapidity ) and azimuthal angle acceptance of the detector .",
    "the width of the enhancement due to the cp in the ( @xmath13 ) plane is based on ref .",

    "figures [ fiptmb ] and [ omegamb ] show no significant peak in the energy dependence of @xmath4 and @xmath5 at sps energies .",
    "these data therefore show no indication for critical point fluctuations , however a narrower @xmath1 scan would be desirable",
    ". figures [ fiptt ] and [ omegat ] display a maximum of @xmath4 and @xmath5 for c+c and si+si interactions at the top sps energy .",
    "this peak is two times higher for all charged than for negatively charged particles , as expected for the effect of the cp @xcite .",

    "the presence of a cp can deform the evolution trajectories of the expanding fireball in the @xmath0 phase diagram ( focusing effect ) @xcite .",
    "this is expected to result in a decrease of the @xmath25 ratio ( generally anti - baryon to baryon ratio @xmath26 ) with increasing transverse momentum instead of a rise or flat behavior in a scenario without the critical point .",

    "the lines show linear fits to @xmath25 versus @xmath27 with @xmath29 being the slope parameter . the dashed line for 40@xmath3 gev ( with slightly higher slope )",
    "was originally @xcite considered the best indication for the predicted critical effect .",

    "a maximum of mean @xmath6 and multiplicity fluctuations as a function of the system size is observed at 158@xmath3 gev for smaller systems ( si+si , c+c ) . if one takes the results as an indication of the cp it would be located at @xmath36 mev and @xmath37 mev .",
    "however , a detailed energy and system - size scan is necessary to establish the existence of the critical point ."
