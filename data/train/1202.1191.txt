    "the high energy emission from neutron stars and black holes in x - ray binaries is generally powered by accretion onto the compact object .",
    "the variability of x - ray light curve with different time scales from milliseconds to days is usually attributed to various characteristic time scales associated with accretion flow around the black hole or neutron star . in low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) , where the central object is fed by an accretion disk , a few variability frequencies observed as quasi - periodic oscillation ( qpo ) peaks in addition to other broad - band features in the power spectra are common to both black hole and neutron star sources . although there are some phenomenological differences between qpos in black hole candidates and those observed in neutron star lmxbs , the similarities such as tight correlations of high and low frequency power spectral features in black hole and neutron star sources are remarkable ( van der klis 1994 ; psaltis , belloni , & van der klis 1999 ; wijnands & van der klis 1999 ) .",
    "any interpretation or model solely based on the existence of a magnetic field , a hard surface , which are neutron star like properties , or an innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) as a black hole like property to produce qpos can not account for the correlations of timing properties among different sources .",
    "qpos were discovered in the x - ray power density spectrum of black hole transients with frequencies in the @xmath7 hz range during the very high spectral state of these sources ( motch et al .",
    "1983 ; miyamoto & kitamoto 1989 ; miyamoto et al . 1991 ; morgan , remillard , & greiner 1997 ; wijnands , homan , & van der klis 1999 ; sobczak et al .",
    "2000 ; strohmayer 2001 ; muno et al .",
    "2001 ) . for several black hole sources ,",
    "high - frequency qpos were observed as single peaks roughly around @xmath8 hz ( see remillard & mcclintock 2006 and references therein ) .",
    "the discovery of twin khz qpos in neutron star lmxbs with their peak frequencies within around the @xmath9 hz range and a peak separation in the @xmath10 hz range together with their tight correlations with the low frequency power spectral components which are also observed in black hole candidates strengthens the idea that qpos are produced in the inner regions of accretion disks around compact objects ( see van der klis 2000 and references therein ; mndez & belloni 2007 ) . the discoveries of twin hectohz qpos from black hole candidates such as gro j1655@xmath1140 , xte j1550@xmath11564 , and grs 1915@xmath12105 ( remillard et al . 2002 , 2003 ; remillard & mcclintock 2006 ) have almost certified the idea of unifying the interpretation of high - frequency qpos observed in black hole and neutron star sources within a single qpo model .",
    "one of the most striking differences between the high - frequency qpos of black holes and the khz qpos in neutron star lmxbs is the fact that the former do not show any significant correlation with the x - ray luminosity whereas the latter do . from one observation to another in a given source ,",
    "the frequency shifts in the high - frequency qpos of black holes are negligible as compared to the variations in the frequencies of khz qpo peaks of accreting neutron stars .",
    "as compared to khz qpos detected in the power spectra of neutron stars , high - frequency qpos from black holes are weak features having relatively low - quality factors .",
    "the commonly observed property of both low and high - frequency qpos in black holes is the fact that these oscillations are strongest at photon energies above 6 kev when the power law component in the energy spectra dominates over the disk component ( remillard & mcclintock 2006 ) . though it is not conclusive regarding the number of black hole sources exhibiting twin qpos , the frequency ratio of the upper high - frequency qpo to the lower one is close to 3:2 in black hole candidates .",
    "there is no specific value for the ratio of two simultaneous khz qpos observed in neutron star sources ; the ratio of the upper qpo frequency to the lower one rather takes different values changing between one and three from one source to another ( belloni , mndez , & homan 2005 ) . beside similarities and tight correlations ,",
    "the phenomenological differences between the high - frequency qpos observed from black hole candidates and those from neutron star lmxbs likely arise from the dominant effect of different boundary conditions imposed by a hard surface or a magnetic field and the isco as they might be more appropriate for a neutron star and a black hole , respectively .",
    "high - frequency qpos were detected in seven black hole sources among which three black hole candidates exhibited qpo pairs in their power spectra .",
    "in all the sources with qpo pairs of commensurate frequencies , the ratio of two qpo frequencies is very close to 1.5 in two black hole binaries and to 1.6 in the third one ( remillard et al .",
    "2002 ; remillard et al .",
    "the common property of high - frequency qpos observed in black hole systems is based on the spectral state of a given source .",
    "all high - frequency black - hole qpos are usually observed in very high and high spectral states which are characterized by the most luminous states of the source ( see remillard & mcclintock 2006 and references therein ) . for such high luminosities , the accretion disk around the black hole",
    "is expected to be truncated at the radius of the isco according to the standard model ( novikov & thorne 1973 ; shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) .",
    "for radii less than the radius of the isco , the accreting gas is thought to plunge radially towards the black hole . in the recent mhd simulations by beckwith , hawley , & krolik ( 2008 ) ,",
    "however , the innermost ring of the disk which emits significant radiation has been shown to lie inside where the standard model predicts .",
    "these simulations have modified the stress - free boundary condition of the standard model at the isco , but they have employed the classical relationship between magnetic stresses and energy dissipation and the assumption that the radial inflow time - scale of the accreting matter inside the isco is longer than the time - scales for thermalization and radiation of the dissipated heat , both of which may not be valid at all within the plunging region .",
    "we therefore anticipate the innermost part of the disk beyond the isco to be the most probable region near the black hole for the production of high - frequency qpos .",
    "it is very likely within this region that the frequencies of the unstable growing disk modes correspond to the frequency bands of qpos .",
    "the early attempts to interpret qpo frequencies in terms of disk modes were made by alpar et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and alpar & yilmaz ( 1997 ) .",
    "the initial contributions to the theory of disk oscillations explored the role of trapped disk oscillations in the variability of the x - ray power spectra of black hole sources ( kato & fukue 1980 ; nowak & wagoner 1991 ; kato 2001 and references therein ) .",
    "the general relativistic test - particle frequencies were recognized and employed to construct models of qpos for both neutron stars and black holes ( stella , vietri , & morsink 1999 ; abramowicz et al .",
    "the model of psaltis & norman ( 2000 ) revealed the importance of hydrodynamic corrections to relativistic test - particle frequencies and the effect of hydrodynamic disk parameters on the correlations of qpos and broad - band noise component .",
    "alpar & psaltis ( 2008 ) noted that the radial epicyclic frequency would be the highest dynamical frequency in the inner region of an accretion disk .",
    "this conclusion is based upon the existence of a magnetohydrodynamic boundary region around the neutron star where orbital frequencies deviate from keplerian test - particle frequencies due to viscous and magnetic stresses ( see erkut & alpar 2004 ) .",
    "the recent analysis by erkut , psaltis , & alpar ( 2008 ) of global hydrodynamic modes in the boundary regions of neutron stars showed how important the hydrodynamic effects are in estimating the observational characteristics of high - frequency qpos .",
    "in this paper we apply the mode analysis , which has been developed by erkut , psaltis , & alpar ( 2008 ) for the boundary region model of khz qpos from neutron stars , to the inner region of an accretion disk around a kerr black hole . in order to account for the general relativistic effects of a kerr metric on the ratio of dynamical frequencies , we work with a new pseudo - newtonian potential that is appropriate for the analysis of temporal behavior of relativistic disks .",
    "this approach allows us to extend our recent study of global hydrodynamic modes of free oscillations to black holes as well .",
    "our aim is to identify the modes whose frequency bands correspond to the high - frequency qpo pairs usually detected with a frequency ratio close to 1.5 in black hole sources .",
    "most importantly , we provide a way to use the frequency ratio of these modes as a diagnostics of the spin parameter of a rotating black hole that exhibit high - frequency qpos .    in section 2",
    "we introduce our pseudo - newtonian approach .",
    "the basic equations and parameters related to the analysis of disk modes for a kerr black hole are presented in section 3 . in section 4",
    "we come up with the mode analysis and identify the modes relevant to the commensurate high - frequency qpo pairs with a frequency ratio around 1.5 .",
    "we discuss the results and present our conclusions in section 5 .",
    "using pseudo - newtonian potentials in hydrodynamic simulations is an effective and easy method to incorporate relativistic effects into accretion flows ( e.g. , chan , psaltis , & zel 2009 ) .",
    "the pseudo - newtonian potential proposed by paczyski & wiita ( 1980 ) is successful in estimating the isco for schwarzschild geometry .",
    "it is therefore appropriate for a non - rotating black hole .",
    "recently , two modified newtonian force models have been introduced by mukhopadhyay & misra ( 2003 ) to approximate the dynamical frequencies of an accretion disk around a rotating black hole .    in our current analysis ,",
    "the ratio of two successive frequency bands of disk modes is of interest in identifying the high - frequency qpos from black holes . unlike the early studies we mentioned above our pseudo - newtonian treatment of dynamical disk frequencies keeps the ratio of the radial epicyclic frequency @xmath0 to the orbital frequency @xmath3 exactly the same as the corresponding ratio observed by a distant observer of a kerr black hole .",
    "the kerr expression for the ratio of the test - particle frequencies @xmath0 and @xmath3 is @xmath13where @xmath14 is the spin parameter of the black hole and @xmath15 with @xmath16 and @xmath17 being the mass of the black hole and the speed of light , respectively .",
    "the newtonian expression for the same ratio is@xmath18the ratio given by equation ( [ knew ] ) is valid for both the test - particles and the hydrodynamical fluids rotating in orbits . in the steady state of a geometrically thin disk ,",
    "the hydrodynamical effects of pressure gradients on the test - particle frequencies are negligible .",
    "as we mention in section 3 , the radial momentum balance in a geometrically thin disk can be approximated by the test - particle orbits where the centripetal acceleration of each gas particle rotating with the frequency @xmath3 is due to the gravitational force . setting equations ( [ kker ] ) and ( [ knew ] ) equal to each other ,",
    "we obtain within our pseudo - newtonian approach a differential equation for the orbital frequency @xmath19 . given a suitable pseudo - newtonian potential , the orbital frequency @xmath3 satisfies the radial momentum equation and mimics the effect of strong gravity on the gas - particle orbits by keeping the value of @xmath20 the same as the corresponding kerr value in the test - particle regime . in this sense ,",
    "our approach is similar to the early pseudo - newtonian treatments of the dynamical frequencies in a geometrically thin accretion disk around a black hole . to find a solution for @xmath19",
    ", we require that our pseudo - newtonian orbital frequency match the kerr orbital frequency in the outer disk . according to a distant observer ,",
    "the kerr expression for the orbital frequency is@xmath21where @xmath22 is the keplerian frequency . for sufficiently large radii ,",
    "that is for @xmath23 , the kerr orbital frequency assumes its keplerian value .",

    "we find that the modes grow in amplitude only within a narrow zone in the innermost disk region . for a non - rotating black hole @xmath170",
    "the characteristic radii of the zone lie in the @xmath171 range .",
    "the modes grow within the @xmath172 range for a rotating black hole with spin @xmath173 . among the growing modes",
    "the growth rates of the frequency branches around @xmath3 and @xmath103 are higher as compared to those of the modes with frequency bands around @xmath104 and @xmath0 ( see figs .",
    "@xmath88@xmath89 ) . due to the effect of enhanced hydrodynamic corrections on the growth rates ,",
    "the modes grow faster in an accretion regime with relatively high rate and viscosity ( see epa08 ) .",
    "the radiation flux due to viscous energy dissipation in the inner disk takes the highest values within the narrow region where the modes grow ( see fig .",
    "@xmath174 ) .",
    "we deduce from the radial profiles of the mode frequencies that the frequency ratio of the modes around @xmath2 and @xmath3 bands is very close to @xmath4 at the radius where the disk radiation is maximum .",
    "this value was observed for the frequency ratio of the high - frequency qpo pairs in black hole sources ( see remillard & mcclintock 2006 ) . instead of being excited at a particular radius in the disk ,",
    "the hydrodynamic modes grow in a region of finite radial extension . to make an estimation for the expectation value of a frequency band and therefore for the frequency ratios of the relevant modes , we calculate the flux weighted averages of the frequency bands over the innermost disk region where the modes grow . scanning the ratios of the expected mode frequencies for all possible values of the spin parameter @xmath14 ( see fig .",
    "@xmath137 ) , we find that only the modes around @xmath2 and @xmath3 branches have a frequency ratio around @xmath4 .",
    "this ratio is slightly higher than @xmath4 if the black hole is a slow rotator @xmath175 .",
    "the same ratio falls below @xmath4 for fast rotating black holes @xmath176 .",
    "the frequency ratios of other modes significantly deviate from @xmath4 over a wide range of values for the spin parameter . relying on the observed values for the frequency ratio of the upper high - frequency qpo to the lower one ,",
    "we conclude that the modes with frequency branches @xmath2 and @xmath177 are the most plausible candidates for the high - frequency qpos from black holes .",
    "the observations of high - frequency qpos can be used to determine the underlying mechanism that produces these oscillations and to measure the spin parameter of the black hole ( remillard & mcclintock 2006 ) .",
    "our analysis may provide a way to employ the observed frequency ratio of a high - frequency qpo pair in a given source to estimate the spin parameter @xmath14 . in this sense ,",
    "figure  @xmath137 comes out as an efficient tool for reading the spin parameter @xmath14 that corresponds to the value of @xmath138/@xmath6 to be interpreted as the frequency ratio of a high - frequency qpo pair observed in the x - ray power spectra of the black hole source .",
    "there are several reasons for expecting to see the fingerprint of global long wavelength modes in the form of high - frequency qpos observed in the x - ray power spectra of black hole sources in lmxbs .",
    "as compared to the neutron stars , there is little chance for accretion flows around the black holes in lmxbs to be affected by the dynamical action of a magnetic field of stellar origin . in the case of a black hole , instead of a direct feedback from the compact object , except gravity , the fluctuations in the mass transfer rate from the binary companion introduce perturbations with a broad band of frequencies including those of the inner disk .",
    "the disk modes which depend on global disk parameters become unstable in the innermost disk region and thus the disk oscillation frequencies are selectively amplified without any need for an external mechanism to force them to attain high amplitudes . furthermore , the observable luminosity variation in the x - ray light curve of a source due to global free oscillation modes of long wavelength , that is , of sufficiently large lengthscale is expected to be least affected by the mhd turbulent eddies of short wavelength . according to our present analysis , the higher the mass accretion rate @xmath178 and the greater the viscosity parameter @xmath54 ,",
    "the higher are the growth rates of the modes .",
    "we therefore expect to observe these modes particularly in the state of high mass accretion rate and high viscosity .",
    "in such a state , the turbulent disk may also interact with its corona ( see tagger & varnire 2006 ) .",
    "this would lead to the formation of high - frequency qpos in a spectral state where the contribution from the power law component is important . in our present analysis",
    "we identify the relevant disk modes without deliberating the disk - corona interaction which we plan to consider in a future work .",

    "<S> we find that the radiation flux emerging from the inner disk has the highest values within the same region . using the flux weighted averages of the frequency bands over this region we identify the growing modes with highest frequency branches @xmath2 and @xmath3 to be the plausible candidates for the high - frequency qpo pairs observed in black hole systems . </S>",
    "<S> the observed frequency ratio around @xmath4 can therefore be understood naturally in terms of the global free oscillations in the innermost region of a viscous accretion disk around a black hole without invoking a particular resonance to produce black hole qpos . although the frequency ratio @xmath5/@xmath6 is found to be not sensitive to the black hole s spin which is good for explaining the high - frequency qpos it may work as a limited diagnostic of the spin parameter to distinguish black holes with very large spin from the slowly rotating ones . within our model </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the frequency ratio of a high - frequency qpo pair to be greater than @xmath4 if the black hole is a slow rotator . </S>",
