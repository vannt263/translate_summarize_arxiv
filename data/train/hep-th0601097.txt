    "this procedure is essentially the one described in @xcite and has been re - explored , in a related context , by the authors of refs . @xcite mainly in connection with conventional inflationary models where the universe is always expanding    in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) a complementary perspective was invoked and it was observed that , by perturbing the einstein - hilbert action to second order in the amplitude of the tensor modes of the geometry in a friedmann - robertson - walker background , each single polarization of the graviton obeys , up to total derivatives , the action of a minimally coupled scalar degree of freedom @xmath40 where the dimensionless amplitude @xmath41 has been defined as @xmath42 consequently , following @xcite , a natural ansatz for describing the back - reaction of the created gravitons on the background space - time would be to use , for each single polarization , the energy - momentum tensor of a minimally coupled scalar field .",
    "this approach has been exploited , for instance , in @xcite and in @xcite for estimating the energy and pressure densities of the relic gravitons in a multi - stage universe .",
    "a possible weakness of this second approach is that eq .",
    "( [ fpdef ] ) holds , strictly speaking , in a friedmann - roberston - walker background . in spite of this , it is clearly useful to bear in mind this possibility .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to scrutinize the dynamical back - reaction effects of the relic gravitons in the extreme situation where the background geometry undergoes a contraction that smoothly evolves , through a bounce , into an expanding phase .",
    "this sequence of events takes place , for instance , in pre big - bang models .",
    "the bouncing beahaviour is related to strong deviations from a radiative universe .",
    "consequently , short wave fluctuations are expected to modify or even restrict the dynamical range of bouncing models since , in this regime , the effective equation of state of relic gravitons is the one of radiation . for long wavelength fluctuations ,",
    "the qualitative expectation is more difficult to formulate since , as already mentioned , the effective equation of state is sensitive to the specific features of the background evolution before and after the bounce .",
    "consider then , as an example , one of the simplest realizations of bouncing dynamics , i.e. the one provided by minimal pre - big bang models where , in the einstein frame , the universe first contracts as @xmath43 and then expands , in the post - big bang phase , as @xmath44 . an accurate description of the bouncing regime in the region @xmath45 may be achieved , for instance , by means of a non - local potentials @xcite that depend on the so - called shifted dilaton which is usually introduced in the context of the scale - factor - duality symmetry @xcite ( or more generally , in the treatment of @xmath46 transformations @xcite acting on the background fields of the low - energy string effective action ) .",
    "the features of the regular bouncing solutions discussed in @xcite are such that the rle of the dilaton potential is only crucial in the bouncing region while , away from the bounce ( i.e. @xmath47 ) the the geometry is driven by the kinetic energy of the dilaton field .",
    "as soon as the tensor modes reach into the super - adiabatic regime , i.e. @xmath48 the effective pressure density of the relic gravitons becomes @xmath49 .",
    "consequently , at least up to the bounce , the energy density of the relic gravitons is not likely dominate on the energy density of the dilatonic sources since the two components evolve exactly in the same way with the scale factor .",
    "while it is plausible that only around the bounce the short wavelength modes become dynamically relevant , it is also clear that the whole qualitative picture should be corroborated by a detailed numerical and analytical treatment .",
    "it will be instructive to conduct the calculation of the dynamical back - reaction within different ansatz for the energy - momentum pseudo - tensor .",
    "then the results will be compared .",
    "a byproduct of the present analysis will indeed be that different forms of the energy - momentum pseudo - tensor lead , quantitatively , to the same back - reaction effects .",
    "the present paper is then organized as follows . in section 2",
    "a class of string inspired bouncing cosmologies will be introduced .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the analysis of the production of relic gravitons and to the different definitions of their energy - momentum pseudo - tensor in the framework of bouncing solutions .",

    "section 5 describes the implementation of a self - consistent ( iterative ) scheme that allows to compute the back - reaction effects of relic gravitons .",
    "section 6 summarizes the main lessons to be drawn from the present analysis and contains also the concluding remarks .",
