    "it is well known that quantum field theories with four - fermion interactions ( 4fqft ) play an essential role in several branches of modern physics . in the case of ( 3 + 1)-dimensional qcd ,",
    "effective theories of this type are used in order to describe the low energy physics of light mesons @xcite as well as phase transitions in compact stars and in hadronic matter under the influence of various external conditions such as temperature , magnetic fields etc .",
    "( see , e.g. , the review papers @xcite ) . low dimensional 4fqfts also find important applications in condensed matter physics .",
    "for example , ( 1 + 1)-dimensional 4fqfts , known as gross - neveu models @xcite , are suitable for the description of polyacetylene - like systems @xcite .",
    "in addition , due to their renormalizability , asymptotic freedom and spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry , gross - neveu type models can be used as a laboratory for the qualitative simulation of specific properties of qcd . in particular , such effects of dense baryonic matter as color superconductivity @xcite ,",
    "charged pion condensation @xcite and dynamical chiral symmetry breaking @xcite were investigated in the simplified case of ( 1 + 1)-dimensional gross - neveu models .    nowadays of special interest are ( 2 + 1)-dimensional 4fqfts .",
    "these models mimic main properties of corresponding ( 3 + 1)-dimensional models .",
    "thus , in the framework of ( 2 + 1)-dimensional models , one has investigated corresponding phenomena as dynamical symmetry breaking @xcite , color superconductivity @xcite , and qcd - motivated phase diagrams @xcite . other examples of this kind are spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking induced by external magnetic / chromomagnetic fields ( this effect was for the first time studied also in terms of ( 2 + 1)-dimensional 4fqft @xcite ) as well as gravitational catalysis of chiral symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that these theories are also useful in developing new qft techniques like e.g. the optimized perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "however , there is yet another and more physical motivation for studying ( 2 + 1)-dimensional 4fqfts .",
    "it is based on the fact that many condensed matter systems have a ( quasi-)planar structure . among these systems",
    "are the high - t@xmath6 cuprate and iron superconductors @xcite , and the one - atom thick layer of carbon atoms , or graphene , @xcite .",
    "thus , many properties of these planar physical systems can be explained on the basis of various ( 2 + 1)-dimensional models , including the 4fqfts ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . in particular , the influence of such external factors as temperature , chemical potential and magnetic field on the metal - to - insulator phase transition and quantum hall effect in planar fermionic systems is investigated in the framework of 4fqfts ( see , e.g. , in @xcite ) .",
    "another example is superconductivity of planar condensed matter systems which can also be treated qualitatively in terms of ( 2 + 1)-dimensional 4fqfts @xcite .    the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional 4fqft model of the papers @xcite describes a competition between two processes : chiral symmetry breaking ( excitonic pairing ) and superconductivity ( cooper pairing ) .",
    "its structure is a direct generalization of the known ( 1 + 1)-dimensional 4fqft model of chodos et al .",
    "@xcite , which remarkably mimics the temperature @xmath7 and chemical potential @xmath2 phase diagram of real qcd , to the case of ( 2 + 1)-dimensional spacetime .",
    "recall that in @xcite , in order to avoid the prohibition on cooper pairing as well as spontaneous breaking of a continuous @xmath8 symmetry in ( 1 + 1)-dimensional models ( known as the mermin - wagner - coleman no - go theorem @xcite ) , the consideration was performed in the leading order of the @xmath9-technique , i.e. in the large-@xmath3 limit assumption , where @xmath3 is the number of fermion fields . in this case ,",
    "quantum fluctuations , which would otherwise destroy a long - range order corresponding to spontaneous symmetry breaking , are suppressed by @xmath9 factors . by the same reason in the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional 4fqft model of the papers @xcite and in the case of finite values of @xmath3 , spontaneous breaking of continuous @xmath8 symmetry",
    "is allowed only at zero temperature , i.e. it is forbidden at @xmath10 .",
    "one possible way to enable the investigation of superconducting phase transitions in the framework of this ( 2 + 1)-dimensional model at @xmath10 is to use the constraint @xmath11 , as it was done in @xcite .",
    "the present paper is devoted to the investigation of the competition between excitonic and cooper pairing of fermionic quasiparticles in the framework of the above mentioned ( 2 + 1)-dimensional 4fqft model under influence of a chemical potential @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "in contrast to these papers , where a flat two - dimensional space with trivial topology @xmath12 was used , we now suppose that the space topology is nontrivial and has the form @xmath0 , where the length of the circumference @xmath5 is denoted by @xmath4 .",
    "thus , in our consideration one spatial coordinate is compactified .",
    "( note that ( 1 + 1)- and ( 3 + 1)-dimensional 4fqft models of superconductivity with compactified spatial coordinates were already studied in @xcite . )",
    "we hope that the investigation of a rather special four - fermionic system on a cylindrical surface will be useful for the understanding of physical processes taking place , e.g. , in carbon nanotubes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional 4fqft model , which describes interactions in the fermion - antifermion ( or chiral ) and fermion - fermion ( or superconducting ) channels is presented . here",

    "moreover , it is shown that , depending on the relation between coupling constants , a periodical reentrance of chiral symmetry breaking or superconducting phases ( as well as periodic symmetry restoration ) occurs with growing values of the magnetic flux @xmath1 . at @xmath21 and @xmath22 the phase structure of the model",
    "is investigated in sec . v.",
    "it is established here that if there is an arbitrary small attractive interaction in the fermion - fermion channel , then it turns out possible to generate the superconductivity phenomenon in the system by increasing the chemical potential .",
    "some related technical problems of our consideration are relegated to three appendices .",
    "our investigation is based on a ( 2 + 1)-dimensional 4fqft model with massless fermions belonging to a fundamental multiplet of the auxiliary @xmath24 flavor group .",

    "let us first point out that without loss of generality the quantities @xmath69 might be considered as real ones .",
    "might be eliminated by an appropriate transformation of fermion fields in the path integral ( [ 9 ] ) .",
    "] so , in the following we will suppose that @xmath70 , where @xmath63 is already a real quantity .",
    "then , in order to find a convenient expression for the tdp it is necessary to invoke appendix b of @xcite , where a path integral similar to ( [ 9 ] ) is evaluated",
    ". taking into account this technique , we obtain the following expression for the zero temperature , @xmath71 , tdp of the 4fqft model ( 1 ) : @xmath72 , \\label{12}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the notation @xmath73 is now used for the tdp @xmath65 at @xmath70 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 . obviously , the function @xmath76 is invariant under each of the transformations @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "hence , without loss of generality , it is sufficient to restrict ourselves by the constraints @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 and to investigate the properties of the tdp ( [ 12 ] ) just in this region . using a rather general formula @xmath83 ( see e.g. , appendix b of @xcite ; the relation(9 ) is true up to an infinite term independent of the real quantity @xmath84 ) , it is possible to reduce the expression ( [ 12 ] ) to the following one : @xmath85 note that the following asymptotic expansion is valid : @xmath86 where @xmath87 .",
    "hence the integral term in ( [ 13 ] ) is ultraviolet divergent , and @xmath73 is an unrenormalized quantity .",
    "hence , in ( [ 13 ] ) and below we use the equivalent notation @xmath88 for it .      to renormalize the tdp ( [ 13 ] ) it is useful to rewrite this quantity in the following way",
    "@xmath89 since the leading terms of the asymptotic expansion ( [ 16 ] ) do not depend on @xmath2 , it is clear that the last integral in ( [ 013 ] ) is a convergent one .",
    "other terms in ( [ 013 ] ) form the unrenormalized tdp @xmath90 ( effective potential ) at @xmath14 , @xmath91 i.e. the expression ( [ 013 ] ) has the following equivalent form @xmath92 thus , to renormalize the tdp ( [ 13])([15 ] ) it is sufficient to remove the ultraviolet divergency from the effective potential @xmath90 ( [ 14 ] ) .",
    "this procedure is performed , as e.g. , in @xcite and based on the special @xmath93 dependence of the bare coupling constants @xmath94 and @xmath95 ( here @xmath93 is the cutoff parameter of the integration region in ( [ 14 ] ) , @xmath96 and @xmath97 ) , @xmath98 where @xmath99 are finite and @xmath93-independent model parameters with dimensionality of the inverse mass .",
    "moreover , since bare couplings @xmath94 and @xmath95 do not depend on a normalization point , the same property is also valid for @xmath99 . as a result , upon cutting the integration region in ( [ 14 ] ) and using there the substitution ( [ 018 ] ) , it becomes possible to obtain in the limit",

    "indeed , let us first introduce a critical value of the couplings , @xmath112 .",
    "then , as it follows from fig . 1 and ( [ 018 ] ) , at @xmath113 and @xmath114 the symmetric phase i of the model occurs . if @xmath115 , @xmath114 ( @xmath113 , @xmath116 ) , the csb phase ii ( the sc phase iii ) is realized . finally , let us suppose that both @xmath115 and @xmath116 . in this case at @xmath117 ( @xmath118 )",
    "we have again the csb phase ii ( the sc phase iii ) .    the fact that it is possible to renormalize the effective potential of the initial model ( 1 ) in the leading order of the large @xmath3 expansion is the reflection of a more general property of ( 2 + 1)-dimensional theories with four - fermion interactions .",
    "indeed , it is well known that in the framework of naive perturbation theory in coupling constants these models are not renormalizable . however , as it was proved in @xcite in the framework of the nonperturbative large-@xmath3 technique , these models are renormalizable in each order of the @xmath9 expansion .",
    "now , it is evident that a renormalized expression @xmath119 for the tdp of the model looks like @xmath120 just this quantity should be used in order to establish the phase structure of the model at @xmath13 and @xmath22 .",
    "in the present section we start the investigation of the difermion and fermion - antifermion condensations in the framework of ( 2 + 1)-dimensional 4fqft model ( 1 ) , when one of two spatial coordinates is compactified . , was investigated in spaces with different nontrivial topologies .",
    "the impact of finite size effects , curvature of space etc . on the chiral symmetry breaking",
    "was considered also in @xcite in spaces of different dimensions on the basis of the zeta - function regularization method . ] in this case , the two - dimensional space has a nontrivial topology of the form @xmath0 . without loss of generality",
    ", it is supposed here that just the @xmath121-axis is compactified and fermion fields satisfy boundary conditions of the form ( the @xmath122 coordinate is not restricted ) @xmath123 where @xmath4 is the length of the circumference @xmath5 and @xmath27 .",
    "the physical situation in our consideration can be treated in the following way .",
    "we suppose that in real three - dimensional space there is a two - dimensional surface on which the physical system , described by lagrangian ( 1 ) , is located . the surface is then rolled into an infinite cylinder @xmath0 and , in addition , a homogeneous external magnetic field @xmath124 parallel to the cylinder axis is switched on .",
    "so the magnetic flux @xmath125 pervades through the transverse section of the cylinder ( here @xmath126 is the radius of the circumference @xmath5 , @xmath127 ) . in this case",
    "one can imagine that the magnetic phase @xmath128 in ( [ 016 ] ) is the quantity @xmath19 , where @xmath129 is the elementary magnetic field flux .",
    "just this interpretation of the quantity @xmath128 is taken e.g. , in @xcite and in the present paper .",
    "in real physical systems the boundary conditions ( [ 016 ] ) might slightly change .",
    "for example , for carbon nanotubes the phase in the boundary conditions ( [ 016 ] ) is changed , @xmath130 , where @xmath131 for metallic nanotubes and @xmath132 for semiconducting ones @xcite ( here @xmath128 is still the quantity @xmath19 ) . ]",
    "do not be confused , but for shortness we use in the following the same name  magnetic flux  both for the genuine magnetic flux @xmath1 and for the ratio @xmath133 . in this case , to obtain the ( unrenormalized ) thermodynamic potential @xmath134 of the initial system , one must simply replace the integration over the @xmath135-momentum in ( [ 013])-([15 ] ) by an infinite series , using the rule @xmath136 so we have from ( [ 15 ] ) @xmath137 where @xmath138 and @xmath139 is analogously obtained from expression ( [ 14 ] ) by using the transformation rule ( [ 17 ] ) , @xmath140 it is clear from ( [ 18])-([20 ] ) that the tdp is a periodic function with unit period with respect to the magnetic flux @xmath128 .",
    "so in many respects it is enough to study the tdp ( [ 18 ] ) only at @xmath141 .",
    "we have proved in appendix [ apb ] that the expression ( [ 20 ] ) is equal to the following one , @xmath142 where @xmath90 is the unrenormalized effective potential of the model in vacuum , i.e. at @xmath14 and @xmath13 ( see the expression ( [ 14 ] ) or , alternatively , ( [ c3 ] ) ) .",
    "since the remaining integral and series terms both in ( [ 18 ] ) and ( [ b8 ] ) are convergent , it is clear that in order to obtain finite renormalized expression @xmath143 for the tdp at @xmath16 , one should simply remove the ultraviolet divergency from the vacuum effective potential @xmath90 , using the way of sec .",

    "moreover , one can see from ( [ 21 ] ) that in addition to the constraints @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 ( see the comments just after ( [ 12 ] ) ) it is enough to accept , without loss of generality , the restriction @xmath145 as well . ) with respect to the transformation @xmath146 . ]",

    ", one can establish the phase structure of the model . by this way",
    ", we have obtained the @xmath168-phase diagrams of the model at arbitrary fixed values of @xmath21 and magnetic flux @xmath128 ( see figs 2 and 3 ) . in the phases",

    "if the point @xmath168 belongs to the strips @xmath193<g_1<0 $ ] and/or @xmath194 , then , as it is clear from figs . 2 and 3 , we have csb or sc phases for all values of @xmath128 .",
    "moreover , in each point of these strips the phase structure of the model is not changed vs @xmath128 .",
    "it means that in this case order parameters ( [ 020 ] ) or ( [ 0200 ] ) are positively defined and periodic functions vs @xmath128 ( see fig .",
    "4 , where the graphic of the order parameter @xmath172 vs @xmath128 is presented for @xmath195 , i.e. at @xmath196 ) .",
    "however , the situation is different for points from another regions of the @xmath168 plane , i.e. when a point @xmath168 belongs to one of the following regions , ( i ) @xmath197 , ( ii ) @xmath198 , ( iii ) @xmath199 , and ( iv ) @xmath200 .",
    "indeed , in this case at @xmath201 the initial symmetry is spontaneously broken down at any finite values of l ( see the phase portrait of fig .",
    "2 with @xmath202 ) . then , with growing value of @xmath128 the gap of the csb or sc phase decreases and at some critical value @xmath203 , where @xmath204 , becomes zero . at this moment",
    "there is a restoration by a 2nd order phase transition of the initial symmetry of the model .",
    "note that for all values of the magnetic flux @xmath128 such that @xmath205 the system is in its symmetric phase i. after that at @xmath206 there again appears a phase with broken symmetry , and a gap increases in the interval @xmath207 . in the following the process is periodically repeated . in fig .",
    "5 the behavior of the gap @xmath173 vs @xmath128 is shown , when @xmath168 belongs to the above mentioned region ( i ) , where in addition we suppose that @xmath208 and @xmath209 ( in this case at @xmath201 the sc phase is realized in the model ) . for such choice of the coupling constants we have @xmath210 .",

    "however , in this case there is an oscillation of the gap vs @xmath128 ( see fig . 4 for an illustration ) .",
    "for the rest points of the @xmath168 plane , the increasing of the external magnetic flux @xmath128 along the axis of a cylinder is accompanied by periodical reentering of csb or sc phase ( which one depends on the point @xmath168 ) as well as with periodical reentering of a symmetry restoration .",
    "such effects , if exist , can be observed experimentally .",
    "+      +    finally , we would like to point out another aspect of the phase structure of the model ( 1 ) .",
    "it is clear from ( [ 25 ] ) and ( [ 021 ] ) that at @xmath14 the tdp of the system is invariant with respect to the following simultaneous permutation of coupling constants and dynamical variables , which is usually called duality transformation @xmath213 @xcite , @xmath214 suppose now that at some fixed particular values of the model parameters , i.e. at @xmath215 , the gmp of the tdp ( [ 021 ] ) lies at the point @xmath216 .",
    "since the tdp is invariant with respect to duality transformation @xmath213 ( [ 28 ] ) , it is clear that the permutation of the coupling constant values , i.e. at @xmath217 , moves the global minimum point of the tdp to the point @xmath218 .",
    "in particular , if at the point @xmath215 the superconducting ( the chiral symmetry breaking ) phase is realized , then at the point @xmath217 the chiral symmetry breaking ( the superconducting ) phase of the model must be arranged . as is easily seen from figs 1 - 3 , just this property of the phase structure",
    "is fulfilled for each figure .",
    "hence , a knowledge of the phase structure of the model ( 1 ) at @xmath209 is sufficient for constructing the phase structure at @xmath219 by taking into account the invariance of the tdp under the duality transformation @xmath213 ( [ 28 ] .",
    "thus , there is a duality correspondence between chiral symmetry breaking and superconductivity in the framework of the model ( 1 ) at @xmath14 .",
    "it is also necessary to remark that in @xcite the csb - sc duality was established in the framework of ( 1 + 1)-dimensional models with a continuous chiral symmetry group .",
    "in contrast , in the present consideration the duality correspondence is a property of the model ( 1 ) with a discrete @xmath30 chiral symmetry .",
    "numerical investigations show again that a global minimum point ( gmp ) of the tdp ( [ 21 ] ) can not be located at the point of the form @xmath148 , i.e. at least one of the quantities @xmath62 and @xmath63 is equal to zero in the gmp of the thermodynamic potential ( [ 21 ] ) .",
    "so , in order to establish the gmp @xmath149 of this tdp , it is sufficient to compare the least values of the simpler functions , @xmath220 and @xmath221 , which are the reductions of the tdp @xmath143 ( see the relation ( [ 21 ] ) ) on the @xmath62 and @xmath63 axis , correspondingly .",

    "in reality we have studied numerically the functions ( [ 24 ] ) and ( [ 26 ] ) .",
    "the results of our analysis for typical values of the magnetic flux @xmath128 and chemical potential @xmath2 ( and for arbitrary fixed values of the quantity @xmath4 ) are presented in figs .",
    "for example , in figs . 6 and 7",
    "the @xmath168-phase structure of the model is presented , respectively , at @xmath201 and @xmath225 . for both figures",

    ", on the basis of these phase portraits it is easy to see that with growth of the chemical potential @xmath2 ( at fixed @xmath128 and @xmath4 values ) the phase iii gradually fills the whole @xmath168 plane ( with the exception of the line @xmath233 ) .",

    "<S> in this paper a ( 2 + 1)-dimensional model with four - fermion interactions is investigated in the case when one spatial coordinate is compactified and the space topology takes the form of an infinite cylinder , @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> it is supposed that the system is embedded into real three - dimensional space and that a magnetic flux @xmath1 crosses the transverse section of the cylinder . </S>",
    "<S> the model includes four - fermion interactions both in the fermion - antifermion ( or chiral ) and fermion - fermion ( or superconducting ) channels . </S>",
    "<S> we then study phase transitions in dependence on the chemical potential @xmath2 and the flux @xmath1 in the leading order of the large-@xmath3 expansion technique , where @xmath3 is the number of fermion fields . </S>",
    "<S> it is demonstrated that for arbitrary relations between coupling constants in the chiral and superconducting channels , superconductivity appears in the system at rather high values of @xmath2 ( the length @xmath4 of the circumference @xmath5 is fixed ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it is shown that at sufficiently small values of @xmath2 the growth of the magnetic flux @xmath1 leads to a periodical reentrance of the chiral symmetry breaking or superconducting phase , depending on the values of @xmath2 and coupling constants . </S>"
