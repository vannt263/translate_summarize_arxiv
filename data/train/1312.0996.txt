    "there have been two main theoretical proposals to understand the long - lived spin echoes under cpmg pulse trains .",
    "one explanation , propounded by the barrett group@xcite , which we refer to in throughout the paper as the barrett proposal , is that these long - lived echoes are a consequence of resonance offset and dipolar evolution during the @xmath0pulse , i.e. , the @xmath0pulses can not be treated as pure @xmath36-pulses . using average hamiltonian theory@xcite ( aht ) , these authors demonstrated that the cpmg(@xmath1 ) generates an effective field that , depending on the @xmath37 pulse phases , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , can spin - lock the magnetization after an initial @xmath38 pulse ; it was argued@xcite that this effect was not equivalent to pulsed spin - locking . in their studies ,",
    "the time @xmath39 in the cpmg pulse train was often on the same order as the @xmath0pulse time , @xmath40 .",
    "however , it was also observed that long - lived echoes could also be observed even when @xmath41 , where many of the aht arguments used in the barrett proposal@xcite would break down since the contribution of @xmath11 during the pulse to the average hamiltonian would appear to be negligible under these conditions .",
    "an alternative theory proposed by the levstein group@xcite , which will be referred to as the levstein proposal in this paper , was advanced which argued that the long - lived echoes were not due to violations of the @xmath36-pulse limit but were instead the consequence of imperfect @xmath0rotations from field inhomogeneities within the sample along with the absence of spin diffusion during the cpmg sequence . in their proposal , the imperfect @xmath0pulses could store some of the single - quantum coherence along the the direction of the large , static zeeman field ( taken to be along the @xmath42-direction ) in the form of @xmath42-magnetization and/or zero - quantum coherences .",
    "@xmath42-magnetization or population tends to relax at a slower rate that is inversely proportional to the longitudinal relaxation time , t@xmath43 , relative to the relaxation decay of single - quantum coherences , which is inversely proportional to the transverse relaxation time , t@xmath44 . in the absence of significant spin diffusion",
    ", subsequent imperfect @xmath0pulses could restore the zero - quantum coherences / populations back into observable single - quantum coherence to form stimulated echoes@xcite .",
    "since it is often the case in solids that t@xmath45 t@xmath44 , the stimulated echo would be less attenuated by relaxation than the regular spin echo generated from signal that remained single - quantum coherence throughout the @xmath0pulse train .",
    "levstein argued that the contributions from the stimulated echoes therefore make the echo amplitudes appear to be `` artificially '' long - lived . because it was demonstrated that stimulated echoes in c@xmath5 were present after the application of a few @xmath0pulses@xcite , it was argued that stimulated echoes generated by magnetization coherence transfer pathways contributed at all echo times due to the periodicity of the cpmg pulse train@xcite .    in this work",
    ", we present an alternative theory for the long - lived echoes in dipolar solids observed under cpmg(@xmath1 ) pulse trains under the conditions @xmath41 .",
    "we demonstrate that the form of the propagator for a cpmg(@xmath1 ) pulse block with imperfect @xmath0pulses ( due to resonance offsets and rf flip - angle errors and neglecting @xmath11 during the @xmath37-pulses ) is similar to the propagator for pulsed spin - locking in dipolar solids@xcite with the phase of the effective `` spin - locking pulses '' given by @xmath46 when @xmath47 for integer @xmath48 ( it should also be noted that previous work@xcite has also suggested that spin - locking can be generated by a cpmg pulse train ) . under this",
    "effective `` pulsed '' spin - locking generated by the cpmg pulse train , a periodic quasiequilibrium@xcite that corresponds to the observed long - lived echoes under the cpmg(@xmath49 ) pulse train can be generated only if the initial phase of the magnetization , @xmath50 , is not orthogonal to the phase of the effective spin - locking field , i.e. , @xmath51 .",
    "unlike the levstein and barrett proposals , a reduction in the signal from the long - lived echoes along with a narrowing of the spectrum from the last echo generated by the cpmg(@xmath52 pulse train are predicted to occur as the interpulse spacing ( @xmath17 ) increases . in our calculations and simulations ,",
