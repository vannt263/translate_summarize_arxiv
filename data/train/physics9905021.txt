    "the null hypothesis of a linear stochastic process undergoing a nonlinear static transform is considered as the most appropriate because it is the closest to nonlinearity one can get with linear dynamics .",
    "surrogate data representing this null hypothesis ought to be random data , but possess the same power spectrum ( or autocorrelation ) and amplitude distribution as the original time series . to test the null hypothesis , a method sensitive to nonlinearity is applied to the original time series and to a set of surrogate time series . the null hypothesis is rejected if a statistic derived from the method statistically discriminates the original from the surrogate data .    for the generation of surrogate data the algorithm of the so - called amplitude adjusted fourier",
    "transform ( aaft ) , by theiler and co - workers @xcite , has been followed in a number of applications so far @xcite .",
    "recently , another algorithm similar to that of theiler , but making use of an iterative scheme in order to achieve arbitrarily close approximation to the autocorrelation and the amplitude distribution was proposed by schreiber and schmitz @xcite .",
    "we refer to it as the iterative aaft ( iaaft ) algorithm . a more advanced algorithm designed to generate surrogates for any given constraints",
    "is supposed to be very accurate for moderate and large data sets , but in the deterrent cost of long computation time @xcite .",
    "therefore it is not considered in our comparative study .",
    "other schemes circumvent the problem of non - gaussian distribution by making first a so - called  gaussianization  of the original data and proceed with this data set generating fourier transform ( ft ) surrogates instead @xcite . in this way the results of the ft surrogate test concern the  gaussianized  data and it is not clear why the same results should be valid for the original non - gaussian data",
    ".    shortcomings of the aaft algorithm due to the use of ft on short periodic signals and signals with long coherent times have been reported elsewhere @xcite . here",
    ", we pinpoint more general caveats of the method , often expected to occur in applications , and give comparative results with the iaaft method .    in section  [ algorithms ] , the aaft and iaaft algorithms are presented and discussed . in section  [ bias ] , the dependence of the hypothesis test on the generating scheme for the surrogate data is examined and in section  [ applications ] the performance of the algorithms on real data is presented .",
    "let @xmath0 , be the observed time series . according to the null hypothesis , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 , is a realization of a gaussian stochastic process ( and thus linear ) and @xmath3 is a static measurement function , possibly nonlinear .",
    "in order for a surrogate data set @xmath4 ( of the same length @xmath5 ) to represent the null hypothesis it must fulfill the following two conditions : 1 ) @xmath6 for @xmath7 , 2 ) @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the autocorrelation , @xmath10 the empirical amplitude distribution and @xmath11 a sufficiently large lag time .",
    "the aaft algorithm starts with the important assumption that @xmath3 is a monotonic function , i.e. , @xmath12 exists .",
    "the idea is to simulate first @xmath12 ( by reordering white noise data to have the same rank structure as @xmath13 , call it @xmath14 , step  1 ) , then make a randomized copy of the obtained version of @xmath15 ( by making a ft surrogate of @xmath14 , call it @xmath16 , step  2 ) and transform it back simulating @xmath3 ( by reordering @xmath13 to have the same rank structure as @xmath17 , call it @xmath4 , step  3 ) .    in step  1 , it is attempted to bring @xmath13 back to @xmath15 , in a loose statistic manner , by constructing a time series with similar structure to @xmath18 , but with gaussian amplitude distribution .",
    "however , it is not clear what is the impact of this process on the autocorrelation @xmath9 . from the probabilistic theory for transformations of stochastic variables",
    "it is known that @xmath19 in general @xcite , and moreover @xmath20 , for a smooth function @xmath21 ( under some assumptions on @xmath3 ) .",
    "assuming that @xmath12 exists and is successfully simulated in step  1 , we get @xmath22 and thus @xmath23 . analytic verification of this is not possible because reordering constitutes an  empirical transformation  .",
    "when @xmath3 is not monotonic or not successfully simulated by the reordering in step  1 the relation @xmath24 can not be established and @xmath25 will be somehow close to @xmath26 .",
    "the phase randomization process in step  2 does not affect @xmath9 apart from statistical fluctuations ( @xmath27 ) , neither alter the gaussian distribution , but it just destroys any possible nonlinear structure in @xmath14 .",
    "the reordering in step  3 gives @xmath8 .",
    "this process changes also @xmath9 according to the function @xmath21 , i.e. , @xmath28 , assuming again that @xmath3 is successfully simulated by the reordering . for the latter to be true",
    ", a necessary condition is @xmath29 .",
    "so , the preservation of the autocorrelation @xmath30 is established only if in step  1 @xmath22 is achieved after the reordering , which is not the case when @xmath3 is not monotonic .",
    "otherwise , the aaft algorithm gives biased autocorrelation with a bias determined by the reordering in step  1 and the form of @xmath21 , and subsequently the form of @xmath3 .",
    "to elucidate , we consider the simplest case of an ar(@xmath31 ) process [ @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , and static power transforms , @xmath35 , for positive @xmath36 .",
    "for @xmath37 , @xmath12 exists only for odd values of @xmath36 . for even values of @xmath36 , a deviation of @xmath25 from @xmath38",

    "note that for @xmath44 the standard deviation ( sd ) is almost zero indicating that all @xmath45 reordered noise data @xmath14 obtain about the same @xmath44 for each realization of @xmath15 , which depends on @xmath46 at each realization .",

    "@xmath44 is always on the same level , well below @xmath46 , and @xmath49 , with the difference to decrease with larger powers .",
    "the iaaft algorithm makes no assumption for the form of the @xmath3 transform @xcite .",
    "starting with a random permutation @xmath50 of the data @xmath13 , the idea is to repeat a two - step process : approach @xmath26 in the first step ( by bringing the power spectrum of @xmath51 to be identical to that of @xmath52 , call the resulting time series @xmath53 ) , and regain the identical @xmath54 in the second step ( by reordering @xmath13 to have the same rank structure as @xmath53 , call it @xmath55 ) .    the desired power spectrum gained in step  1 is changed in step  2 and therefore several iterations are required to achieve convergence of the power spectrum .",
    "the algorithm terminates when the exact reordering is repeated in two consecutive iterations indicating that the power spectrum of the surrogate can not be brought closer to the original .",
    "the original algorithm gives as outcome the data set derived from step  2 at the last iteration ( @xmath55 , where @xmath56 the last iteration ) , denoted here iaaft-1 .",
    "the iaaft-1 surrogate has exactly the same amplitude distribution as the original , but discrepancies in autocorrelation are likely to occur . if one seeks the best matching in autocorrelation leaving the discrepancies for the amplitude distribution , the data set from step  1 after the last iteration ( @xmath53 ) , denoted iaaft-2 , must be chosen instead .",
    "the bias of the autocorrelation with iaaft-1 can be significant , as shown in fig .",
    "[ ar1autoc](b ) . for reasons we can not explain , the bias in @xmath57 gets larger for odd values of @xmath36 ( monotonic @xmath3 ) , for which aaft gives no bias (",
    "the same bias was observed using 16384 samples ruling out that it can be due to limited data size ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the matching in autocorrelation with iaaft-2 was perfect ( not shown ) .",
    "the surrogate data derived from the iaaft algorithm exhibit little ( iaaft-1 ) or essentially zero ( iaaft-2 ) variation in autocorrelation compared to aaft .",
    "this is an important property of the iaaft algorithm in general because it increases the significance of the discriminating statistic as it will be shown below .",
    "by construction , the iaaft algorithm can represent the null hypothesis regardless of the form of @xmath3 while the aaft algorithm can not represent it when @xmath3 is not monotonic .",
    "one can argue that the deviation in the autocorrelation due to possible non - monotonicity of @xmath3 is small and does not affect the results of the test .",
    "this is correct only for discriminating statistics which are not sensitive to linear data correlations , but most of the nonlinear methods , including all nonlinear prediction models , are sensitive to data correlations and therefore they are supposed to have the power to distinguish nonlinear correlations from linear .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ ar1rej ] the results of the test with aaft and iaaft surrogate data from the example with the ar(1 ) process .",
    "two discriminating statistics are drawn from the correlation coefficient of the one step ahead fit @xmath58 using an ar(1 ) model and from the @xmath58 using a local average mapping ( lam ) ( embedding dimension @xmath59 , delay time @xmath60 , neighbors @xmath61 ) .",
    "the significance of each statistic @xmath62 [ here @xmath63 is computed as @xmath64 where @xmath65 is for the original data , @xmath66 and @xmath67 is the mean and sd of @xmath68 , @xmath69 , for the @xmath70 surrogate data ( here @xmath42 ) .",
    "the significance @xmath71 is a dimensionless quantity , but it is customarily given in units of  sigmas  @xmath72 .",

    "the number of rejections with both ar(1 ) and lam is at the level of the  size  of the test ( @xmath75 , denoted with a horizontal line in fig",
    ".  [ ar1rej ] ) when @xmath3 is monotonic , but at much higher levels when @xmath3 is not monotonic , depending actually on the magnitude of @xmath36 . for the iaaft algorithm",
    "the results are very different .",
    "using iaaft-1 surrogates the number of rejections is almost always much larger than the  size  of the test and the opposite feature from that for aaft is somehow observed for the even and odd values of @xmath36 .",
    "the extremely large number of rejections with iaaft-1 is actually due to the small variance of the statistics for the iaaft surrogates [ see also fig.[ar1autoc](b ) ] . on the other hand , the @xmath58 of the ar(1 ) for the iaaft-2 surrogates",
    "seems to coincide with the original because , besides the small sd in eq.([sigma ] ) , the significance is almost always below @xmath73 .",
    "note that the @xmath58 of ar(1 ) behaves similar to @xmath57 for this particular example .",
    "the values of @xmath58 of lam for each surrogate data group are more spread giving thus less rejections for aaft and iaaft-1 . for iaaft-2 and for @xmath76 and @xmath77 , there are too many rejections and",
    "this can not be easily explained since this behavior is not observed for the linear measure .",
    "we suspect that the rejections are due to the difference in the amplitude distribution of the iaaft-2 surrogate data from the original , which may effect measures based on the local distribution of the data such as lam .",
    "simulations with ar - processes of higher order and with stronger correlations showed qualitatively the same results .",
    "in order to verify the effect of the bias in autocorrelation in a more comprehensive manner , we consider in the following examples with real data the discriminating statistics @xmath78 , @xmath79 , from the @xmath80 time step ahead fit with polynomials @xmath81 of the volterra series of degree @xmath82 and memory ( or embedding dimension ) @xmath83 @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the total number of terms .",
    "to distinguish nonlinearity , @xmath86 is sufficient .",
    "starting from @xmath87 , we construct @xmath88 polynomials adding one term at a time .",
    "note that @xmath89 are actually the linear ar models of order @xmath90 , respectively , and the first nonlinear term enters in the polynomial @xmath91 .",
    "so , if the data contains dynamic nonlinearity , this can be diagnosed by an increase of @xmath92 when nonlinear terms are added in the polynomial form .",
    "this constitutes a direct test for nonlinearity , independent of the surrogate test , and its significance is determined by the increase of @xmath92 for @xmath93 .",
    "note that a smooth increase of @xmath92 with the polynomial terms is always expected because the fitting becomes better even if only noise is  modeled  in this way . in ref .",
    "@xcite , where this technique was applied first , this is avoided by punishing the addition of terms and the aic criterion is used instead of @xmath94 . here",
    ", we retain the @xmath94 measure bearing this remark in mind when we interpret the results from the fit .",
    "we choose this approach because on the one hand , it gives a clear indication for the existence or not of nonlinearity , and on the other hand , it preserves or even amplifies the discrepancies in the autocorrelation , so that we can easily verify the performance of the aaft and iaaft methods .",
    "we start with the celebrated annual sunspot numbers ( e.g. see @xcite ) .",
    "many suggest that this time series involves nonlinear dynamics ( e.g. see @xcite for a comparison of classical statistical models on sunspot data , and @xcite for a comparison of empirical nonlinear prediction models ) .",
    "the sunspot data follows rather a squared gaussian than a gaussian distribution and therefore the aaft does not reach a high level of accuracy in autocorrelation [ see fig .",
    "[ sunspotsautoc](a ) ] . note that the @xmath95 of the reordered noise data @xmath14 follows well with the @xmath96 of the aaft , and is even closer to the original @xmath97 .",
    "this behavior is reminiscent to that of squared transformed ar - data [ see fig .  [ ar1autoc](a ) for @xmath98 , which is in agreement with the comment in @xcite that the sunspot numbers are in first approximation proportional to the squared magnetic field strength .",
    "the condition @xmath99 holds supporting that the simulation of @xmath3 transform ( step  3 of aaft algorithm ) is successful . due to the short size of the sunspot data",
    "also iaaft-1 surrogates can not mimic perfectly the autocorrelation , as shown in fig .",
    "[ sunspotsautoc](b ) .",
    "on the other hand , the iaaft-2 surrogates match perfectly the autocorrelation and follow closely the original amplitude distribution .",
    "the discrepancies in autocorrelation are well reflected in the correlation coefficient @xmath94 from the polynomial modeling as shown in fig.[sunspotscc ] . to avoid bias in favor of rejecting the null hypothesis",
    ", we use arbitrarily @xmath100 in all our examples in this section .",
    "the fit of the original sunspot data is improved as linear terms increase from @xmath31 to @xmath101 , and no improvement is observed adding the tenth linear term which is in agreement with the choice of ar(9 ) as the best linear model @xcite . as expected ,",
    "this feature is observed for the aaft and iaaft surrogates as well [ see fig .",
    "[ sunspotscc](a ) ] .",
    "further , the inclusion of the first nonlinear term ( @xmath102 ) , improves the fitting of the original sunspot numbers , but not of the surrogates .",
    "actually , the volterra polynomial fitting shows that the interaction of @xmath103 and @xmath104 with theirselves and with each other is prevalent for the sunspot data [ note the increase of @xmath105 for @xmath106 , @xmath107 , and @xmath108 .",
    "when compared with aaft surrogates this feature is not so obvious mainly due to the large variance of @xmath105 of the aaft surrogates and the large discrepancy from the @xmath105 of the original data , which persists also for the linear terms ( for @xmath109 ) . for the iaaft-1 surrogate data , there is also a small discrepancy due to imperfect matching of the autocorrelation , which disappears when the iaaft-2 surrogate data are used instead .    the significance @xmath71 of the discriminating statistics @xmath105 , @xmath110 , shown in fig .",
    "[ sunspotscc](b ) , reveals the inappropriateness of the use of aaft .",
    "the null hypothesis is rejected even for @xmath109 , i.e. , when a linear statistic is used . on the other hand ,",
    "using iaaft-1 or iaaft-2 surrogate data only the @xmath105 for @xmath111 , i.e. , involving nonlinear terms , give @xmath71 over the @xmath73 level .",
    "for only linear terms , @xmath71 is at the @xmath73 level using iaaft-1 surrogate data and falls to zero when iaaft-2 surrogate data are used instead . employing as discriminating statistic the difference of @xmath58 after , for example ,",
    "the inclusion of the @xmath102 term , i.e. , @xmath112 , gives for aaft @xmath113 , for iaaft-1 @xmath114 , and for iaaft-2 @xmath115 .",
    "so , even for short time series , for which iaaft-1 can not match perfectly the autocorrelation , it turns out that the iaaft algorithm distinguishes correctly nonlinear dynamics while following the aaft algorithm one can be fooled or at least left in doubt as to the rejection of the null hypothesis . here",
    ", we had already strong evidence from previous works that nonlinear dynamics is present , and used this example to demonstrate the confusion aaft method can cause . however , if one checks first the autocorrelation of aaft [ fig .",
    "[ sunspotsautoc](a ) ] , then these results should be anticipated [ fig .",
    "[ sunspotscc](a ) and ( b ) ] .",
    "we examine here a geophysical time series , the auroral electrojet index ( ae ) data from magnetosphere @xcite .",
    "surrogate data tests for the hypothesis of nonlinear dynamics have been applied to records of ae index of different time scales and sizes with contradictory results @xcite . here , we use a long record of six months , but smoothly resampled to a final data set of @xmath116 samples [ see fig .  [ realseries](a ) ] .",
    "the amplitude distribution of the ae index data is non - gaussian and has a bulk at very small magnitudes and a long tail along large magnitudes .",
    "this is so , because the ae index is characterized by resting periods interrupted by periods of high activity probably coupled to the storms of solar wind .    for the autocorrelation",

    "the @xmath95 of the ordered noise data @xmath14 are slightly larger than @xmath97 , which , according to section  [ algorithms ] , is a sign that under the null hypothesis the @xmath3 transform is not monotonic .",
    "also @xmath99 holds so that @xmath3 seems to have been simulated successfully . on the other hand ,",
    "the iaaft-1 surrogates match almost perfectly the autocorrelation and represent exactly the null hypothesis ( therefore iaaft-2 surrogate data are not used here ) .",
    "the @xmath105 from the volterra polynomial fit on the original ae index shows a characteristic improvement of fitting with the addition of the first nonlinear term ( see fig .",
    "[ ae8cc ] ) .",
    "this result alone gives evidence for nonlinear dynamics in the ae index .",
    "however , the surrogate data test using the aaft does not support this finding due to the bias and variance in the autocorrelation . to the contrary , as shown in fig .",
    "[ ae8cc](b ) , it gives the confusing pattern that the null hypothesis is marginally rejected at the @xmath74 confidence level with linear discriminating statistics [ @xmath105 for @xmath109 ] , but not rejected with nonlinear statistics [ @xmath105 for @xmath118 .",
    "the iaaft algorithm is obviously proper here .",

    "the discrimination of the original ae data from aaft surrogates can be still achieved by employing the discriminating statistic @xmath122 giving @xmath123 ( and @xmath124 for iaaft-1 ) .",
    "actually , the nonlinearity indicated from the volterra polynomial fit is very weak and can be marginally detected with other discriminating statistics @xcite .",
    "for example , a local fit would give the erroneous result that the null hypothesis is marginally rejected using aaft , but not using iaaft , because the local fit is mainly determined by the linear correlations .",
    "in particular , a fit with lam ( @xmath100 , @xmath60 , @xmath125 ) gave for @xmath58 significance @xmath126 for aaft and only @xmath127 for iaaft .",

    "these data are also believed to be nonlinear , but it is not clear whether the nonlinearity is autonomous or merely due to nonlinear coupling with the heart rate @xcite .",
    "the breath rate time series does not have strong linear correlations .",

    "matching in @xmath105 for the linear terms in combination with the abrupt rise of the @xmath105 of the breath rate data after the inclusion of the second ( not first ! ) nonlinear term , constitutes a very confident rejection of the null hypothesis at the level of at least @xmath129 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ b11cc](b ) .",
    "it seems that for the modeling of the breath rate data , the interaction of @xmath103 and @xmath104 ( term @xmath130 ) is very important .",

    "particularly , the condition @xmath99 does not hold here for small @xmath9 values implying that the bias in autocorrelation may also be due to unsuccessful simulation of @xmath3 ( in the step  3 of the aaft algorithm ) .",

    "[ eegcc](b ) , because again iaaft-1 tends to give dense statistics .",
    "remarkably , the significance degrades to less than @xmath73 when nonlinear terms are added .",
    "we employ iaaft-2 surrogate data as well [ see fig .",
    "[ eegcc](a ) ] .",
    "these do not match perfectly the original amplitude distribution ( especially at the bulk of the distribution ) , but possess exactly the same linear correlations as the original , as approved also from the linear fit in fig.[eegcc](a ) .",
    "for the iaaft-2 surrogates , the significance from the @xmath105 is correctly less than @xmath73 for both the linear and nonlinear terms of the polynomial fit , as shown in fig .",
    "[ eegcc](b ) .    we want to stress here that the results on the eeg data are by no means conclusive , as they are derived from a simulation with a single tool ( polynomial fit ) on a single eeg time series .",
    "however , they do insinuate that the use of aaft surrogate data in the numerous applications with eeg data should be treated with caution at least when a striking difference between the original data and the aaft surrogate data can not be established , which otherwise would rule out that the difference is solely due to biased autocorrelation .",
    "the study on the two methods for the generation of surrogate data that represent the null hypothesis of gaussian correlated noise undergoing nonlinear static distortion revealed interesting characteristics and drawbacks of their performance .",
    "the most prominent of the two methods , the amplitude adjusted fourier transform ( aaft ) surrogates , can represent successfully the null hypothesis only if the static transform @xmath3 is monotonic .",
    "this is an important generic characteristic of the aaft algorithm and not just a technical detail of minor importance as treated in all applications with aaft so far @xcite .",
    "the bias in autocorrelation induced by the non - monotonicity of @xmath3 can lead to false rejections of the null hypothesis .",
    "our simulations revealed a drawback for the other method , the iterated aaft ( called iaaft here ) , which was not initially expected .",
    "depending on the data type , the iterative algorithm may naturally terminate while the matching in autocorrelation is not yet exact ( we call the derived surrogate data iaaft-1 ) . in this case , all iaaft-1 surrogate data achieve approximately the same level of accuracy in autocorrelation .",
    "thus , the variance of autocorrelation is very small and therefore the mismatching becomes significant .",
    "consequently , applying a nonlinear statistic sensitive to data correlations gives also significant discrimination .",
    "so , when using iaaft surrogate data , the exact matching in autocorrelation must be first guaranteed and then differences due to nonlinearity become more distinct due to the small variance of the statistics on iaaft . in cases the iaaft-1 data set",
    "does not match exactly the original autocorrelation , we suggest to use a second data set derived from the same algorithm , iaaft-2 , which possesses exactly the same linear correlations as the original and may slightly differ in the amplitude distribution .",
    "our simulations suggest the use of iaaft-2 in general , but there may be cases where a detailed feature of the amplitude distribution should be preserved ( e.g. data outliers of special importance ) and then iaaft-1 should be used instead .    the application of the aaft and iaaft algorithms to real world data demonstrated the inappropriateness of aaft and the  too good  significance obtained with iaaft surrogates if nonlinearity is actually present .",
    "the results generally suggest that one has first to assure a good matching in autocorrelation of the surrogate data to the original before using them further to compute nonlinear discriminating statistics and test the null hypothesis .",
    "if a bias in autocorrelation is detected , statistical difference in the nonlinear statistics may also occur and then the rejection of the null hypothesis is not justified by a high significance level because it can be just an artifact of the bias in autocorrelation .",
    "one can argue that when @xmath3 is not invertible then the assumption that the examined time series stems from a gaussian process can not be assessed by this test because there is not one to one correspondence between the measured time series @xmath13 and the gaussian time series @xmath15 , where @xmath136 .",
    "we would like to stress that the hypothesis does not yield a single gaussian process , but any gaussian process that under @xmath3 ( even not monotonic ) _ can give _",
    "@xmath13 , i.e. , the existence of multiple solutions is not excluded .",
    "more precisely , the null hypothesis states that the examined time series belongs to the family of statically transformed gaussian data with linear properties and deviation from the gaussian distribution determined by the corresponding sample quantities of the original time series .",
    "thus the surrogate data generated under the two conditions ( matching in autocorrelation and amplitude distribution ) may as well be considered as realizations of different gaussian processes statically transformed under @xmath3 .",
    "differences within the different underlying linear processes are irrelevant when the presence of nonlinearity is investigated .",
    "concerning the discriminating statistics , our findings with synthetic and real data suggest that local models , such as the local average map , are not always suitable to test the null hypothesis and can give confusing results . on the other hand , the volterra polynomial fit turned out to be a useful diagnostic tool for detecting dynamic nonlinearity directly on the original data as well as verifying the performance of the surrogate data because it offers direct detection of changes in the discriminating statistic from the linear to nonlinear case .",

    "<S> the schemes for the generation of surrogate data in order to test the null hypothesis of linear stochastic process undergoing nonlinear static transform are investigated as to their consistency in representing the null hypothesis . </S>",

    "<S> it turns out that in many applications with real data the inferences of nonlinearity after marginal rejection of the null hypothesis were premature and have to be re - investigated taken into account the inaccuracies in the aaft algorithm , mainly concerning the mismatching of the linear correlations . in order to deal with such inaccuracies </S>",

    "<S> the application of this setup to some well - known real data sets cautions against the use of the aaft algorithm . </S>"
