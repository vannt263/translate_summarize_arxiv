    "<S> results are given for the ground state energy and excitation spectrum of a simple @xmath0-state @xmath1 spin chain described by free parafermions . </S>",
    "<S> the model is non - hermitian for @xmath2 with a real ground state energy and a complex excitation spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> although having a simpler hamiltonian than the superintegrable chiral potts model , the model is seen to share some properties with it , e.g. , the specific heat exponent @xmath3 and the anisotropic correlation length exponents @xmath4 and @xmath5 .    in 1989 </S>",
    "<S> baxter introduced a simple @xmath1 hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are arbitrary parameters . in matrix form , </S>",
    "<S> the operators @xmath9 and @xmath10 are @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are @xmath15 matrices , with @xmath13 and @xmath14 in position @xmath16 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath12 is the identity , with @xmath13 and @xmath14 defined by @xmath17 they satisfy @xmath18    for @xmath19 with @xmath20 and @xmath21 this hamiltonian is the well known one - dimensional quantum ising model in a transverse field with open boundary conditions . based on numerical observations baxter found that the hamiltonian ( [ ham0 ] ) has the remarkably simple energy spectrum  @xcite @xmath22 for any choice of the integers @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> this covers all @xmath24 eigenvalues in the spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the energy levels @xmath25 @xmath26 are functions of @xmath27 @xmath28 . for simplicity </S>",
    "<S> we focus our attention here on the choice @xmath20 and @xmath21 , with thus @xmath29 the parameter @xmath30 is a natural generalisation of the ising transverse field .    </S>",
    "<S> fendley  @xcite has recently shown that ( [ spec ] ) is the energy spectrum of free parafermions . </S>",
    "<S> a key ingredient is the fradkin - kadanoff transformation to parafermionic operators introduced earlier for the @xmath0-state clock models  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is a generalisation of the jordan - wigner transformation . </S>",
    "<S> the explicit parafermionic jordan - wigner transformation dates back to morris  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> parafermions have long been considered in both mathematics and physics ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> they have been seen to underpin a range of novel phenomena , particularly with regard to topological phases in condensed matter physics  @xcite .    the free parafermionic structure ( [ spec ] ) </S>",
    "<S> was subsequently confirmed in the related @xmath31 model with open boundaries  @xcite , from which ( [ ham0 ] ) and thus ( [ ham ] ) follow in the hamiltonian limit . </S>",
    "<S> the version of the @xmath31 model , known as the bazhanov - stroganov model  @xcite , is a two - dimensional classical chiral spin model connecting the six - vertex model and the chiral potts model in a such a way that the chiral potts model can be viewed as a descendent of the six - vertex model  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the non - hermitian hamiltonian ( [ ham0 ] ) and the related @xmath31 model are the only known models with an entire spectrum described precisely by free parafermions .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we take fendley s calculations one step further and derive the properties of the energy spectrum for hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) . to do this , consider the @xmath32 determinant satisfied by the quasi - particle energies @xmath33  @xcite , @xmath34 this is a multinomial in integer powers of @xmath35 and @xmath36 , of degree @xmath37 in @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> this is however , the _ same _ multinomial for all values of @xmath0 and @xmath30 if one makes the correspondence @xmath39 the free parafermionic quasi - energies @xmath40 for the @xmath0-state model can thus be determined from the corresponding solution for the ising case . </S>",
    "<S> this latter problem was considered with the necessary open boundary conditions long ago by pfeuty  @xcite , building on earlier results obtained for the xy model  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the solution for arbitrary @xmath0 and general @xmath30 is thus given in terms of the quasi - energies @xmath41 where the roots @xmath42 , @xmath43 , satisfy the equation @xmath44 this equation has @xmath37 roots in the interval @xmath45 for @xmath46 , while for @xmath47 there are @xmath48 roots in @xmath45 , the remaining root being complex .    to obtain the properties of the energy spectrum , </S>",
    "<S> first consider the case @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> the roots of ( [ eqn ] ) can then be explicitly written as @xmath50 the ground state energy @xmath51 can be evaluated using the euler - maclaurin formula @xmath52 \\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{b_{2k}}{(2k ) ! } \\left [ f^{(2k-1)}(l ) - f^{(2k-1)}(0 ) \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 are the bernoulli numbers . in this way </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the result @xmath54 with non - integer exponent @xmath55 the bulk and surface energy are @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the standard gamma function . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitudes @xmath58 in ( [ e0 ] ) are given by @xmath59 \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)^{\\nu}\\ ] ] with @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> the infinite series only terminates for the case @xmath19 , where @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> note that for @xmath2 the finite - size corrections are no longer governed by integer powers of @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> this is also the case for the chiral potts model  @xcite , which although not conformally invariant , does exhibit anisotropic scaling  @xcite .     </S>",
    "<S> free parafermion quasi - energy levels for @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 . in each case </S>",
    "<S> a single particle excitation above the groundstate is shown on branch @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> excitations can be on any branch , but restricted by the parafermion exclusion rule , effectively defining a fermi  exclusion circle \" for each level . ]    it is straightforward to derive the excitation spectrum at @xmath49 given @xmath40 and the free parafermion structure of the excitations . for @xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) is non - hermitian , with a complex eigenspectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the energy spectrum has @xmath1 symmetry , by which any eigenvalue @xmath69 has related eigenvalues @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> this is the parafermion generalisation of the @xmath71 ising symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> following fendley  @xcite , the excitation spectrum is best illustrated by diagrams as in figure 1 . </S>",
    "<S> as for the ising @xmath19 case the excitation spectra can be classified according to the number of @xmath72-particle excitations above the fermi surface . for 1-particle excitations </S>",
    "<S> we find @xmath73 for @xmath74 and @xmath75 , with @xmath76 similarly for 2-particle excitations , @xmath77 \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2l } \\right)^{\\nu } \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\ , + o\\left(\\frac{1}{l^{1+\\nu}}\\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath78 and @xmath79 with @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> the generalisation to arbitrary @xmath81-particle excitations , where @xmath82 is readily apparent .    for @xmath19 </S>",
    "<S> we recover the forms expected from conformal invariance  @xcite , namely @xmath83 with @xmath84 the 1-particle excitations are associated with scaling dimension @xmath85 , the 2-particle excitations with @xmath86 etc . in this way </S>",
    "<S> the conformal data of the ising model , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , is recovered for open / free boundary conditions  @xcite . unlike for the ising case </S>",
    "<S> , the amplitudes of the finite - size corrections for @xmath2 appear to have no physical meaning .    </S>",
    "<S> the groundstate energy per site for general @xmath30 in the @xmath90 limit is @xmath91 where @xmath92 is defined in ( [ theta ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this result is readily seen to satisfy the duality relation @xmath93 . </S>",
    "<S> the ising elliptic integral result  @xcite @xmath94 is recovered for @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> the result ( [ einf ] ) can be derived directly using the euler - maclaurin formula . </S>",
    "<S> use can be made of the leading order solutions to equation ( [ eqn ] ) , which can be adapted from the treatment of the xy model with open boundaries  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> consider the case @xmath95 . </S>",
    "<S> writing @xmath96 gives @xmath97 with solution @xmath98.\\ ] ] to leading order , the roots are thus approximated for large @xmath37 by @xmath99    on the other hand , for @xmath100 , there is one complex root @xmath101 where @xmath102 satisfies the equation @xmath103 solving for large @xmath37 , this excitation carries energy @xmath104 the gap to excitations thus closes exponentially as  @xmath105 for large @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> it follows that the groundstate is @xmath0-fold degenerate for @xmath100 , reflecting the ordered state of the system in this regime .    </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to express @xmath106 in terms of hypergeometric functions . with the change of variable @xmath107 in ( [ einf ] ) </S>",
    "<S> we obtain  @xcite @xmath108 moreover , using a quadratic relation for the hypergeometric functions  @xcite gives the simple form @xmath109 the series representation of @xmath110 then gives an expansion in @xmath30 , with result @xmath111 ^ 2   \\sum_{\\ell=1}^{\\infty } \\frac{\\left[\\gamma\\left(\\ell + \\frac{1}{n}\\right ) \\right]^2}{\\gamma(1 + \\ell ) } \\ , \\frac{\\lambda^{n \\ell}}{\\ell \\,!}\\ ] ] for @xmath95 . </S>",
    "<S> the expansion for the case @xmath100 is obtained from this result using the duality relation @xmath93 .    </S>",
    "<S> we now turn to critical exponents in the vicinity of the critical point @xmath112 . for @xmath95 , the mass gap corresponding to 1-particle excitations </S>",
    "<S> is @xmath113 for @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath19 this is the well known ising result @xmath114  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although in general complex , the mass gap ( [ gap ] ) is real when @xmath115 for @xmath0 even . </S>",
    "<S> analogous results are obtained for the @xmath72-particle excitations . </S>",
    "<S> the gaps in the excitation spectrum close with a well defined exponent as @xmath116 . writing the mass gaps as @xmath117 , the dynamical critical exponent @xmath118 is defined by the scaling behaviour @xmath119 as @xmath120 and @xmath121 as @xmath116 . for anisotropic scaling @xmath122 , where @xmath123 and @xmath124 are the correlation length exponents in the time and space directions , respectively . from the above results , @xmath125 for this model .    </S>",
    "<S> another quantity of interest is the specific heat , defined by @xmath126 which at the critical point @xmath49 scales as @xmath127 as @xmath90 . </S>",
    "<S> a lengthy but straightforward calculation gives @xmath128 implying the result @xmath129 . </S>",
    "<S> numerical investigation of the specific heat @xmath130 as a function of @xmath30 and @xmath37 shows a broad maximum at a value @xmath131 . </S>",
    "<S> this peak approaches the critical value @xmath132 , with @xmath133 as @xmath90 . </S>",
    "<S> we have confirmed this scaling relation numerically , with exponent value @xmath4 independent of @xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> collecting the results , the free parafermion @xmath1 spin chain has critical exponents @xmath134 these are the same values derived for the superintegrable chiral potts model  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the specific heat exponent is also that of the @xmath1 fateev - zamolodchikov model  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we conclude with some remarks . in general non - hermitian hamiltonians </S>",
    "<S> describe the dynamics of physical systems that are not conservative . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum hamiltonian of the chiral potts model is hermitian , with a real eigenspectrum . </S>",
    "<S> hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) is an example from the class of models which are non - hermitian , with a complex eigenspectrum for @xmath135 . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the model has a real ground state and a remarkably simple excitation spectrum governed by the structure of free parafermions . </S>",
    "<S> we have seen here that the eigenspectrum shares some properties with the chiral potts model . as remarked by cardy  @xcite in discussion of the chiral potts model from the perspective of conformal field theory , several of the usual properties of hermitian systems , such as insensitivity of bulk thermodynamic quantities to boundary conditions , can fail in the non - hermitian case . </S>",
    "<S> this note of caution should apply even more so for the model under consideration here . </S>",
    "<S> given this point , along with the burgeoning relevance and interest in the physics of parafermions , this is clearly a model deserving of further attention .    </S>",
