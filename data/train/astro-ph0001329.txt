    "one important aspect of the problem of galaxy formation is to understand the connection between the history of star formation and the metal enrichment history of the extended hot gaseous component ( e.g. , cavaliere , giacconi , & menci 2000 ) .",
    "recent studies have argued that most of the metals produced by star - forming galaxies at high redshifts exist in the hot gaseous halos of galaxies and proto - clusters ( e.g. , pettini 1999 , 2000 ) . by assuming that the hot gaseous components of nearby rich clusters are a fair representation of the local universe as a whole , renzini ( 1997 , 2000 )",
    "has argued that the cluster fe abundances indicate a prompt initial enrichment of the early universe .",
    "hence , x - ray observations may be vital for obtaining a complete picture of the history of star formation of the universe in massive elliptical galaxies the metals injected by previous generations of stars do not escape the gravitational field , and thus the hot gas in these systems records the star formation history via the heating and enrichment of the hot gas by supernovae ( e.g. , ciotti et al 1991 ; david , forman , & jones 1991 ; loewenstein & mathews 1991 ) .",
    "these systems typically fall into the class of cooling flows ( e.g. , fabian 1994 ) .",
    "unfortunately , reliable constraints on the metal enrichment in such systems are lacking because the metal abundances in the hot gas in cooling flow galaxies and groups determined from previous x - ray studies have yielded conflicting results with most authors finding very sub - solar fe abundances ( see buote 2000a and references therein ) .",
    "these low fe abundances are generally less than the stellar values which implies little or no enrichment from type ia supernovae and thus an imf much flatter than that of the milky way ( e.g. , arimoto et al 1997 ; renzini 1997 ; wyse 1997 ) .",
    "in contrast , in our recent analyses of the _ asca _ data accumulated within @xmath5-@xmath6 of the brightest ellipticals and groups we find that the fe abundances are approximately solar and that the previous inferences of very sub - solar fe abundances using _ asca _ data are the result of a bias arising from assuming the gas to be isothermal in the presence of significant temperature gradients ( buote & fabian 1998 ; buote 1999 , 2000a ) .    to investigate the possible role of fe abundance gradients on these measurements",
    "we have re - examined the _ rosat _",
    "pspc data of the brightest galaxies and groups .",
    "the pspc allows for spatially resolved spectral analysis on a half - arcminute scale , and interesting constraints on both the temperatures and fe abundances are possible because the @xmath7 kev temperatures of these systems are well matched to the bandpass of the pspc .",
    "moreover , analysis of the pspc data is much less subject to the `` fe bias '' @xcite which plagues analysis of the _ asca _ data ( see  [ bias ] ) .",
    "we selected for re - analysis all of the galaxies and groups possessing published temperature profiles from _ rosat _ ( forman et al 1993 ; ponman & bertram 1993 ; david et al 1994 ; trinchieri et al 1994 ; rangarajan et al 1995 ; kim & fabbiano 1995 ; irwin & sarazin 1996 ; jones et al 1997 ; trinchieri , fabbiano , & kim 1997 ; mulchaey & zabludoff 1998 ) with the exception of the pegasus i group @xcite because of the low s / n .",
    "all of these systems have rising temperature profiles and multitemperature _ asca _ spectra usually attributed to cooling flows .",
    "all but one of these _ rosat _ studies determined the temperatures and fe abundances by fitting a single temperature component to the spectrum in an annulus on the sky .",
    "however , each annulus on the sky contains the projection of emission from larger radii which can confuse interpretation because of the substantial temperature gradients .",
    "consequently , we have developed our own deprojection code to obtain three - dimensional spectral parameters .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in  [ obs ]",
    "we present the observations and discuss the data reduction .",
    "the deprojection procedure is described in  [ deproj ] and the results for the temperature and fe abundance profiles are given in ",

    "the properties of the observations are listed in table [ tab.obs ] . except where noted below",
    ", these data were reduced using the standard ftools ( v4.2 ) software according to the procedures described in the ogip memo ogip/94 - 010 ( `` rosat data analysis using xselect and ftools '' ) , the www pages of the _ rosat _ guest observer facility ( gof ) ( see http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/rosat ) , and @xcite .",
    "the events files of each observation were cleaned of after - pulse signals by removing all events following within 0.35 ms of a precursor . to minimize the particle background contribution only events with master veto rate less than 170 ct s@xmath11were selected @xcite .",
    "we corrected the pulse invariant ( pi ) bins of each data set for spatial and long - term temporal gain variations using the most up - to - date calibration files .",
    "for the ftool pcecor , which corrects for the variation in the linearity of the pspc response , we used the in - flight calibration data for the correction .    from visual inspection of the light curve of an observation we identified and removed time intervals of significant enhancements in the count rate in order to obtain a flat distribution of count rate versus time .",
    "such short - term enhancements are typically the result of scattered light from the sun , auroral x - rays , and enhanced charged particle precipitation @xcite .",
    "the raw and filtered exposure times are listed in table [ tab.obs ] .",
    "the particle background spectrum for an observation was obtained by following the instructions in @xcite .",
    "we developed our own software to perform this task because we identified serious errors in the ftools implementation of the plucinsky et al procedure ( i.e. , program pcparpha ) .",
    "for our data sets the particle background rate is alway much less than that of the diffuse background .    for each observation we obtained a background spectrum from source - free regions far away from the center of the field ( typically distances of @xmath13-@xmath14 ) . by using a local background",
    "estimate residual contamination from solar x - rays and any other long - term background enhancements @xcite are fully accounted for in the ensuing spectral analysis .",
    "however , the extended emission of the galaxies and groups do contribute at some level to the flux even at these large radii .    to assess the contribution of galaxy and group emission within the background regions we fit the background spectrum with a model after subtracting the particle background .",
    "we represent the cosmic x - ray background by a power law and the galactic emission by two thermal components following @xcite . to account for emission from the galaxy or group",
    "we include another thermal component with variable temperature .",
    "each component is modified by the galactic hydrogen column listed in table [ tab.obs ] .",
    "this composite model provides a good fit to the background spectrum for each system . in every case",
    "the additional thermal component is required with temperatures ranging from 0.3 - 1.6 kev . in 8 out of 10 cases",
    "this additional component contributes significantly only to energies above @xmath15 kev which is consistent with emission from the galaxy or group in question . for these systems",
    "we subtract this temperature component from the background when performing spectral analysis ( see  [ bkg ] ) , and the background rates listed in table [ tab.obs ] reflect this subtraction .",
    "the effect of excluding this extra component in the background on the source spectral parameters is only significant for a few systems , and is noticeable only in the outermost one or two radial bins ( see  [ caveats ] ) .    for ngc 5044 and 5846 we obtained @xmath16 kev for the extra thermal component and found that it contributed very significantly to the emission in both the soft and hard energy channels .",
    "in these cases the extra component probably represents a combination of emission from long - term enhancements in the background @xcite with any residual emission from the groups . as a result",
    ", we did not subtract out the extra thermal component from the background of these systems .    for ngc 4472",
    "we confirm the finding by @xcite that a background spectrum taken from regions @xmath17-@xmath14 from the field center tends to over - subtract energies below @xmath18 kev probably because of contamination from unresolved point sources . to compensate for this we took the background from regions just inside the inner ring of the pspc where the psf is much smaller which allows us to avoid point sources more effectively .",
    "we confine the region to the north of the center of ngc 4472 where the galaxy emission is lower @xcite .",
    "the method we use to deproject the x - ray data is the well - established technique pioneered by @xcite .",
    "this method is non - parametric in that no functional form is assumed for the spatial distribution of the x - ray emission or for any of the associated spectral quantities ( temperature , abundances etc . ) .",
    "after first assuming a specific geometry one begins by determining the emission in the bounding annulus and then works inwards by subtracting off the contributions from the outer annuli . for the case of spherical symmetry the volume emission density",
    "is related to the surface brightness according to the simple geometric formula given by kriss , cioffi , & canizares ( 1983 ) .",
    "the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium is usually incorporated into this deprojection procedure in order to obtain the mass and mass deposition rate as well as the spectral parameters ( fabian et al 1981 ; sarazin 1986 ; arnaud 1988 ) . in the interest of generality",
    "we do not make this additional assumption .",
    "hence , the principal assumption in our version of the deprojection procedure is that of spherical symmetry which means that our derived spectral parameters should be considered spherically averaged quantities for systems that have significant ellipticity .",
    "a thorough , up - to - date discussion of this deprojection method is given by @xcite , and we refer the reader to that paper for the relevant equations . since mclaughlin is interested in the globular cluster distribution in m87 he formulates the deprojection algorithm in terms of the number of globular clusters , @xmath19 , located between radii @xmath20 and @xmath21 on the sky . to express his equations in terms of quantities relevant for x - ray analysis",
    "we simply associate @xmath19 with the x - ray flux , @xmath22 , in erg @xmath10 s@xmath11 .",
    "we have developed our own code to implement the deprojection algorithm and have verified it using synthetic _",
    "data obtained by using the quicksim software @xcite .",
    "some aspects of the deprojection analysis require special mention which we now address .",
    "the deprojection algorithm assumes there is no source emission outside of the bounding annulus , @xmath23 .",
    "this is generally not the case , and if the exterior emission is not accounted for then the volume emission density of the outermost annuli will be overestimated .",
    "@xcite provide an analytic correction factor for the flux of the bounding annulus in the limit of annuli with zero width . since , however , the width of the bounding annulus tends to be large because of decreasing s / n with increasing radius , and since any exterior emission also projects into interior annuli , we follow @xcite and compute a separate correction factor , @xmath24 , for each annulus arising from emission exterior to @xmath23 .",
    "the emissivity of this exterior emission projected into an annulus @xmath25 is taken to be proportional to @xmath26 ; i.e. the spectral shape of the emission exterior to @xmath23 is assumed to be the same as that for the outermost annulus .",
    "moreover , to compute @xmath24 a model for the spatial profile for the exterior emission is required .",
    "we assume that the volume x - ray emission density is a power law outside of @xmath23 which is a good approximation for galaxies and groups since the x - ray emission at large radii is generally well described by a @xmath27 model @xmath28 with @xmath29-@xmath30 ( e.g. , mulchaey & zabludoff 1998 )",
    ". our results are not very sensitive to these assumptions because our chosen bounding annuli are quite wide so that @xmath31 for @xmath27 over this range .    the formulae for @xmath24 for the cases @xmath32 and @xmath33 are given by equations a7 and a8 in @xcite .",
    "all results presented in  [ spec ] are for the case @xmath33 since , as mentioned above , the results are quite insensitive to this choice .",
    "both the numerator and denominator of mclaughlin s equation a8 evaluate to zero for @xmath34 which is problematical for numerical computations .",
    "fortunately , the limit is well - behaved , and in appendix [ appendix ] we give the limiting equation .",
    "the deprojected x - ray emission in any annulus interior to the bounding annulus depends on the previous results obtained for adjacent exterior annuli .",
    "since the deprojection procedure introduces correlations between annuli it is natural to employ monte carlo simulations to estimate the statistical uncertainties on the spectral parameters .",
    "hence , after we have obtained best - fitting models for all desired annuli on the sky , we simulate a new data set for each annulus by using these models as templates .",
    "then we deproject these simulated data and obtain parameters in the same manner as done for the actual data .    for each observation",
    "we determine the errors on each parameter from 100 monte carlo simulations . in most cases we found",
    "that the simulated parameters are reasonably symmetrically distributed about a central peak .",
    "consequently , we define confidence limits for a parameter with respect to the median value from the 100 simulations . for example , after sorting the 100 values for a given parameter into ascending order we define the 68% confidence limits to be given by the 16th and 84th values ; the 90% limits are given by the 5th and 95th values , etc .",
    "this scheme for defining confidence limits has its limitations . in some cases",
    "when the parameter has a large error the simulated distribution is very flat so that the median is not obviously the best reference point from which to define confidence limits . in such instances the 68% confidence limits defined as above",
    "do not always enclose the best - fitting value .",
    "however , we do find that in all cases the best - fitting values are enclosed with the @xmath35 confidence limits indicating that our definitions are not very unreasonable , and thus we apply the above definitions of confidence levels in every case for consistency and convenience .",
    "it is well known from optical studies that the deprojection of the luminosity distribution of an elliptical galaxy yields a jagged profile where the departures from a smooth profile are of the same magnitude or larger than the statistical errors on the photometry ( e.g. , binney , davies , & illingworth 1990 ) .",
    "a variety of factors contribute to the high - frequency noise responsible for the jagged profile such as the incomplete removal of point sources .",
    "an analogous situation occurs for the deprojection of x - ray data .",
    "in actuality the situation is worse for the x - ray case because one desires the profiles of several spectral parameters in addition to the luminosity , but the statistical noise is much greater while the ability to remove contaminating sources is usually much worse than in the optical . as a result , the radial fluctuations in parameter values can sometimes be sufficiently large so that the values get sent off to obscure regions of parameter space never to return",
    ". such fluctuations do not agree with the parameters obtained from fitting the x - ray spectra without deprojection .",
    "our preferred means to eliminate such fluctuations is to increase the s / n by increasing the widths of the annuli .",
    "this method is very effective and has the great advantage that no theoretical prejudice is forced onto the data ( other than the desire for the 2d and 3d profiles to be qualitatively similar ) .",
    "although doing this removes most of the serious parameter fluctuations in our _ rosat _ observations , in many cases there is still one annulus with divergent parameter values .",
    "hence , to keep any remaining fluctuations in check we smooth the derived parameter distributions in a manner related to linear regularization ( e.g. , press et al 1992 ) .",
    "the problem with linear regularization is that one restricts the point - to - point variation in the parameters with a pre - conceived model .",
    "for example , @xcite assume the smooth profiles of the temperature and abundances to be linear functions of logarithmic radius .",
    "( the amount of smoothing applied also depends on an additional weighting factor  see finoguenov & ponman ) .",
    "however , as we show in  [ fp ] these choices usually lead to very biased parameter profiles .",
    "our method of regularizing the parameters is not standard since we do not add an extra term to the @xmath36 equation because it can not be done in the current version of xspec @xcite .",
    "instead we perform an _ ex post facto _ regularization by simply restricting the available range for the temperatures and fe abundances at a given radius according to the desired amount of smoothing .",
    "this method is simpler to implement and , we believe , allows more transparent control over the smoothing process .    to insure that we do not over - smooth our parameter profiles",
    "we do the following : ( 1 ) we always compare the results obtained from analysis with and without deprojection and require that the two cases do not differ qualitatively .",
    "( 2 ) we only regularize the temperatures and fe abundances and always vary the amount of smoothing for each observation until we are satisfied that significant bias is not introduced . in most cases we found that restricting the absolute values of the radial logarithmic derivatives in the temperature and fe abundance to be less than 1 and 1.5 respectively worked well .",
    "all spectral fitting was performed with the software package xspec @xcite using the @xmath37 method implemented in its standard form .",
    "the weights for the @xmath37 method are computed in each pi bin assuming gaussian statistics . to insure that the weights are valid in this assumption we regrouped the pi bins for each source spectrum so that each group has at least 30 counts .",
    "the extraction of spectra is discussed in the following section .",
    "a possible concern with the interpretation of @xmath36 for goodness - of - fit is that the deprojection procedure causes the emission at inner radii to depend on that from larger radii .",
    "however , the model representing the projected emission within a given annulus is taken to be exact ; i.e. statistical errors from the projected emission model are not included in the deprojection method , and therefore the statistical errors in each pi bin remain those of the 2d annulus which are gaussian .",
    "we have verified the validity of using @xmath36 for measuring goodness - of - fit under the standard assumption of gaussian statistics by comparing to results obtained from 2d analysis without deprojection : in all cases investigated we find that when a large improvement in @xmath36 is obtained from the deprojection analysis a qualitatively consistent large improvement is also obtained with the 2d analysis .",
    "for each system we extracted spectra in concentric circular annuli located at the x - ray centroid ( computed within a @xmath38 radius ) such that for each annulus the width was @xmath39 and the background - subtracted counts was larger than some value chosen to minimize uncertainties on the spectral parameters for each system while maintaining as many annuli as possible .",
    "data with energies @xmath40 kev were excluded to insure that the psf was @xmath41 fwhm . for our on - axis sources",
    "@xmath42 of the psf at 0.2 kev is contained within @xmath43 @xcite .    for systems possessing more than one observation ( see table [ tab.obs ] ) we extracted the source and background spectra separately from each observation and then added them together .",
    "in all such cases the observations occurred after the october 1991 gain change so the redistribution matrix file ( rmf ) , which specifies the channel probability distribution for a photon , is the same for all of them . since , however , the detector location of the annuli are in general slightly different for the different observations because of slight aspect differences , we averaged their respective auxiliary response files ( arfs ) which contain the information on the effective area as a function of energy and detector location .",
    "any background sources that were identified by visual examination of the image were masked out before the extraction .",
    "since the x - ray emission of the galaxies and groups in our sample is dominated by hot gas , we use coronal plasma models as the basic component of our spectral models .",
    "we use the mekal plasma code which is a modification of the original meka code ( mewe , gronenschild , & van den oord 1985 ; kaastra & mewe 1993 ) where the fe l shell transitions crucial to the x - ray emission of ellipticals and groups have been re - calculated @xcite ; the superior performance of the mekal model over the raymond - smith code for spectral analysis of elliptical galaxies we have previously discussed in detail in @xcite . because of the limited energy resolution of the pspc",
    ", we focus on a `` single - phase '' description of the x - ray emission in which a single temperature component exists at each ( three - dimensional ) radius . as we discuss below in  [ bias ] we do not expect a significant `` fe bias '' resulting from the single - phase analysis .",
    "we did investigate multiphase models of the hot gas such as a two - temperature plasma and a constant - pressure cooling flow @xcite , but interesting constraints were not obtained as explained below in  [ caveats ] ; see  3.1.1 of @xcite for further description of such models .",
    "we account for absorption by our galaxy using the photo - electric absorption cross sections according to @xcite .",
    "although @xcite point out that the he cross section at 0.15 kev is in error by 13% , since we analyze @xmath44 kev we find that our fits do not change when using the @xcite cross sections which have the correct he value .",
    "the absorber is modeled as a uniform screen at zero redshift with solar abundances .",
    "the hydrogen column density of the absorber is generally allowed to be a free parameter to indicate any additional absorption due to , e.g. , intrinsic absorbing material , calibration errors , etc .",
    "we refer to this as the standard absorber model .",
    "( in paper3 we discuss more complex absorption models . )",
    "as discussed in paper1 and paper3 we also find it useful to consider absorption due to an oxygen edge which we represent by the simple parameterization , @xmath45 $ ] for @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the energy of the edge in the rest frame of the galaxy or group and @xmath48 is the optical depth ; i.e. @xmath48 represents an absorbing screen located at the source redshift but placed in front of the source .",
    "partial covering models are discussed in paper3 .",
    "finally , data with energies between 0.2 and 2.2 kev were included in the analysis .",
    "@xcite have pointed out that the accepted value for the solar fe abundance relative to h is approximately @xmath49 by number .",
    "this value is often called the meteoritic value since it was originally obtained for meteorites , but it also agrees with recent measurements from the solar photosphere .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the old photospheric value of fe / h of @xmath50 @xcite that is widely used .",
    "we have decided to use the correct `` meteoritic '' fe abundance for this and subsequent papers ; in xspec we use the abundance table of @xcite . however , when comparing to previous results we shall always take care to consider the factor of 1.44 between the different fe / h values .",
    "iron is the only abundance that we allow to be a free parameter .",
    "all other elemental abundances are tied to iron in their solar ratios ; i.e. the values of the other abundances vary with fe in their fixed solar ratios . in a sense",
    "we are actually fitting a metallicity , but since the fe l - shell lines dominate all other lines in the pspc spectrum for the @xmath0 kev plasmas of bright galaxies and groups , the fitted metallicity is almost entirely determined by fe .",
    "hence , we shall always quote our results as fe abundances .",
    "the observed background spectrum obtained from regions far away from the source in general covers a different amount of detector area , requires a different detector response , and if taken from a different observation can have a different exposure time . within xspec the effect of different areas and exposure times for source and background are taken into account but not different detector responses .",
    "background spectra taken near the edge of the pspc field suffer from vignetting which significantly reduces the count rate with respect to the source spectra near the field center .",
    "this effect is also energy dependent , and thus the spectral shape of the background is altered as well .    to properly scale the background spectrum to the source position we perform the following simple procedure .",
    "first , as explained in  [ obs ] we fit a model to the background spectrum .",
    "let us denote the flux of this model for an energy , @xmath51 , by , @xmath52 , where @xmath53 represents the detector position , @xmath54 the background area on the detector , and @xmath55 , the exposure time .",
    "the corresponding flux in a given pi channel , @xmath56 , predicted by this model is then , @xmath57 the model , @xmath58 , is independent of the response , and thus the expected background flux in channel , @xmath56 , at the source position is simply , @xmath59 where @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 are respectively the position , area , and exposure time for the source .    in the general case",
    "one would prefer to use the actual background data rather than a best - guess model . to do this simply scale the real background spectrum by the factors",
    "@xmath63 for each pi channel .",
    "these ratios are typically very insensitive to the detailed shape of the input model spectrum .",
    "this scaling procedure was followed for ngc 5044 and 5846 . for the other systems we needed to subtract a thermal component due to the extended source emission as discussed in  [ tab.obs ] . since for these systems the background estimate is necessarily defined by a model we used equation ( [ eqn.bkg ] ) for the scaling .",

    "since the column densities at large radii are consistent with the galactic values this decrease at small radii can not be due to errors in the background subtraction .",

    "the size of the effect depends on many factors ( e.g. , s / n ) though again we found that for reasonable background choices only the outermost annuli are affected as would be expected .",

    "see below . )",
    "deprojection analysis of the _ rosat _ pspc data of 10 cooling flow galaxies and groups reveals clear evidence for fe abundances that decrease with radius in all but one system ( ngc 2563 ) .",
    "typically @xmath85 at the largest radii examined ( @xmath4 - 100 kpc ) which increases to @xmath1 within the central radial bin ( @xmath2 kpc ) . in most cases the estimated uncertainties on @xmath103 are large within the central bin and",
    "allow for @xmath104 ( but never @xmath105 ) . throughout this paper",

    "these 3d fe abundance profiles are generally consistent with the original 2d _ rosat _ studies ( forman et al . 1993 ; david et al 1994 ; kim & fabbiano 1995 ; irwin & sarazin 1996 ; jones et al 1997 ) after accounting for projection effects and for the different plasma codes and solar abundances used ( though see below in  [ bias ] ) . for all 10 systems the fe abundances ( and temperatures ) that we have obtained from the deprojected",
    "_ rosat _ data agree with those we have obtained previously from analysis of the _ asca _ data accumulated within @xmath107-@xmath6 ( buote & fabian 1998 ; buote 1999 , 2000a ) ; qualitatively similar results for some of these systems also have been recently obtained with _ asca _ data by allen , di matteo , & fabian ( 2000 ) .",
    "therefore , within @xmath4 kpc of these bright galaxies and groups the _ rosat _ and _ asca _ data clearly demonstrate that the gas is non - isothermal with approximately solar fe abundances .",
    "we now examine whether it is the assumption of isothermality or the presence of fe abundance gradients which accounts for the very sub - solar fe abundances inferred by most previous _ asca _",
    "( and some _ rosat _ ) studies ( see buote 2000a for a detailed review ) .",
    "previously we have discussed how fitting a single - temperature plasma model to the soft x - ray spectrum of a bright elliptical galaxy or galaxy group that actually consists of multiple temperature components can lead to a serious underestimate of the fe abundance ( buote & canizares 1994 ; buote & fabian 1998 ; buote 1999 , 2000a ) . in our most comprehensive treatment to date",
    "@xcite we provided a physical explanation of this `` fe bias '' from examination of _ asca _ data which we now summarize in figure [ fig.bias ] .",
    "the accumulated _ asca _ spectra within @xmath5-@xmath6 of the brightest elliptical galaxies and groups ( including those in our present investigation ) are well represented by two - temperature ( 2 t ) models .",
    "these 2 t models are also consistent with the radial temperature gradients inferred from the _ rosat _ data within the same spatial regions ( buote 1999 , 2000a ) .",
    "moreover , we have verified that such 2 t models continue to provide a good representation of the accumulated spectra generated by the _",
    "temperature profiles out to the largest radii ( @xmath108 ) investigated in our present paper whether or not the temperature rises and then falls ( e.g. , ngc 2563  figure [ fig.6ann ] ) or continues to rise out to the largest radii ( e.g. , ngc 4472  figure [ fig.6ann ] ) .",
    "this agreement is expected because a 2 t model can mimic very accurately the soft x - ray spectra of cooling flows @xcite .    in figure [ fig.bias ]",
    "we show a simulated _ asca _ sis spectrum of a 2 t model with @xmath109 with temperatures and relative emission measures typical of the bright galaxies and groups . for this discussion",
    "we consider only the energies 0.55 - 1.5 kev to emphasize the fe l lines and the lower bandpass limit of the sis .",
    "also shown in figure [ fig.bias ] is the result of fitting a single - temperature ( 1 t ) model with fixed at @xmath110 to the simulated 2 t spectral data .",
    "it is readily apparent that the 1 t model is a poor fit to the 2 t spectrum as it is too peaked near 1 kev while being deficient in emission at other energies .",
    "this behavior simply reflects the ability of the 2 t model to excite fe l lines over a wider range of energies than the 1 t model . in order to force the 1 t model to better fit the 2 t spectrum one has to reduce the size of the peak at 1 kev which means reducing the fe abundance . allowing to be a free parameter results in a better ( but still not good ) fit and with a best - fitting value of @xmath111 ( see figure [ bias ] ) .",
    "it is this effect that we have termed the `` fe bias '' .",
    "this fe bias is dependent on the energy resolution of the detector and is more pronounced at higher resolution which is why we have focused on the _ asca _ sis data .",
    "but if the models in figure [ bias ] are folded with the relatively low resolution of the _ rosat _ pspc we obtain a best - fitting value of @xmath112 for the 1 t model , very similar to that obtained above at higher resolution with the sis . however , it must be emphasized that this underestimate with the pspc is achieved only if the lower limit on the bandpass is restricted to energies @xmath113 kev as appropriate for the sis . if instead the lower energy limit is reduced to 0.2 kev",
    "as is appropriate for the pspc then we obtain @xmath114 for the 1 t model .",
    "this smaller underestimate occurs because while reducing the fe abundance diminishes the line emission of the 1 t model to better fit the spectral maximum near 1 kev , the continuum of the 1 t model must increase to compensate for the decrease in the fe l emission at energies near @xmath115 kev .",
    "it also compensates for the corresponding decrease in the strong o k@xmath116 emission near 0.6 kev since o ( like the other elements ) varies with fe in its solar ratio ( see  [ solar ] ) .",
    "this raising of the continuum by the 1 t model generally goes unnoticed when analyzing _ asca _ data for the following reason .",
    "the _ asca _ sis and gis bandpasses do not extend below the energy regions shown in figure [ fig.bias ] , but they do include energies up to @xmath117 kev .",
    "however , the emission at higher energies is usually accounted for by introducing an additional high - temperature bremsstrahlung component ( brem ) to represent emission from discrete sources ( e.g. , matsumoto et al . 1997 ) , and thus any increase or decrease in the emission of the 1 t model at energies much larger than 1 kev can be compensated by changing the normalization of the brem component .",
    "the required amount of compensation is generally unimportant because the emission from the 1 t model decreases as @xmath118 , and thus a plasma with @xmath119 kev contributes little to the emission of a 1t+brem model at higher energies .",
    "however , spectral analysis with pspc data includes lower energies ( i.e. @xmath120 kev ) that are dominated by continuum emission .",
    "the data at these energies restrict the attempt by the data near 1 kev to simultaneously reduce the fe abundance and increase the continuum in order to force a better fit of a 1 t model to the 2 t spectrum .",
    "hence , the fe bias affecting analysis of pspc data is much less pronounced than for _ asca _ data because of the lower energy resolution of the pspc , and especially because the pspc data include energies below @xmath15 kev .",
    "our deprojection analysis of the pspc data removes the temperature components projected from larger radii from the spectrum of a given annulus .",
    "consequently , if the gas is single - phase ( i.e. , a single density and temperature at each radius ) the range of temperatures within a given annular spectrum must be small after deprojection ( i.e. , essentially the temperature difference between the annuli that surround the annulus in question ) . since each deprojected spectrum is nearly isothermal , and",
    "since the fe bias is already greatly reduced when analyzing pspc data , we expect that the fe bias does not significantly affect our measurements of the fe abundances from the pspc data in this paper .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that the fe abundances we have obtained from our deprojection analysis of the pspc data agree only with those obtained from the _ asca _ studies that have removed the fe bias by fitting multitemperature models of the _ asca _ spectra accumulated within substantial spatial regions ( @xmath121 ; buote & fabian 1998 ; buote 1999 , 2000a ; allen et al 2000 ) .",
    "if a warm gas phase ( @xmath122 k ) also contributes to the x - ray emission of the galaxies and groups as indicated by the intrinsic absorption reported in paper1 and paper3 , then the single - phase assumption needs to be reconsidered .",
    "however , the low temperature of the warm gas implies a negligible contribution to the fe l emission and thus will not contribute to an fe bias .",
    "another possibility is that the hot gas emits over a continuous range of temperatures as might be expected from an inhomogeneous cooling flow that cools at constant pressure ( e.g. , johnstone et al 1992 ) .",
    "as mentioned in  [ caveats ] we do not find any significant change in the inferred fe abundances if we use such a cooling flow model .",
    "if the fe bias is not very important for analysis of _ rosat _ pspc data , then why do some _ rosat _ studies find very low fe abundances ? as stated above the fe abundances we have determined from the deprojection analysis of the pspc data of the 10 galaxies and groups in our sample agree very well with those obtained from previous spatial - spectral analyses of these systems with the pspc after accounting for ( 1 ) the factor of 1.44 arising from our use of the meteoritic solar abundances , ( 2 ) different plasma codes used , and ( 3 ) small differences associated with our use of a deprojection analysis ( forman et al .",
    "1993 ; david et al 1994 ; kim & fabbiano 1995 ; irwin & sarazin 1996 ; jones et al 1997 ) .",
    "our results also agree with those of @xcite who fitted 1 t models within large apertures ( typically @xmath123 radius ) for several groups including ngc 533 , 2563 , 4636 , and 5846 .",
    "to make a more realistic comparison we summed up the emission models we obtained for all annuli for these systems , simulated a pspc observation using the same exposure time , and then fitted the simulated spectrum with a 1 t model like helsdon & ponman .",
    "the fe abundances we obtained from this exercise are fully consistent within the @xmath124 errors for each system .",
    "we emphasize that helsdon & ponman find @xmath125 ( scaled to meteoritic solar ) for these systems even when using very large apertures .",
    "in contrast @xcite obtain @xmath126 from 1 t ( raymond - smith ) fits to the pspc spectra of ngc 2563 , hcg 62 , and ngc 5846 within radii of @xmath127 ( though @xmath128 is obtained for ngc 533 ) .",
    "the values for ngc 2563 and 5846 obtained by mulchaey & zabludoff are inconsistent with those obtained from the very similar analysis by @xcite and from our deprojection analysis .",
    "a possible explanation could be associated with the background subtraction . as we noted in  [ caveats ] the fe abundances will be underestimated if the background is also underestimated .",
    "this effect is only noticeable when the background is underestimated by factors or @xmath129 or more .",
    "such a large factor will result if the background spectrum is taken from the edge of the field and not corrected for vignetting before subtracting from a source region near the center of the field . as explained in ",
    "[ bkg ] we always account for the different detector responses for the source and background in our analysis .",
    "however , when ignoring the response differences we are able to reproduce the very small fe abundances obtained by mulchaey & zabludoff for ngc 2563 , 5846 , and hcg 62 .",
    "( we perform the 1 t fits in the same manner as described above for our comparison to the results of helsdon & ponman ; i.e. we include all of the annuli investigated . )",
    "our value for ngc 533 is consistent within the large statistical error with that obtained by mulchaey & zabludoff whether or not we properly scale the background to the source positions . since the fe abundances that we have determined from the pspc data",
    "agree with all other previous _ rosat _ studies except mulchaey & zabludoff , we are lead to conclude that they must not have corrected their background spectra for vignetting before subtracting from the source spectra .",
    "hence , there is no evidence from the _ rosat _ pspc data that the brightest elliptical galaxies and galaxy groups have average fe abundances that are very sub - solar  regardless of whether they have steep fe abundance gradients .",
    "the only clear evidence for very sub - solar fe abundances is thus derived from fits to the _ asca _ data assuming an isothermal gas which we have shown to give misleading results because of the fe bias .",
    "thus , it is the assumption of isothermality , rather than the presence of fe abundance gradients , which accounts for the very sub - solar fe abundances inferred by most previous _ asca _",
    "studies ( see buote 2000a for a detailed review ) .      the consistent picture that we have described is not supported by the work of finoguenov and co - workers who find very sub - solar fe abundances from deprojection analysis of the _ asca _ data of hcg 62 , ngc 4472 , 4636 , 4649 , 5044 , and 5846 ( finoguenov et al 1999 ; finoguenov & ponman 1999 ; finoguenov & jones 1999 ) .",
    "for hcg 62 and ngc 5044 @xcite also perform a deprojection of the _ rosat _ data and obtain results not too dissimilar from their _ asca _ analysis . as noted before in  [ results ]",
    "we emphasize that our temperature profiles for these systems agree well with those obtained in the finoguenov papers .",
    "we have previously speculated on possible reasons for the different fe abundances obtained by finoguenov ( see  4.1 of buote 2000a ) .",
    "now equipped with our own deprojection code we can test one of those speculations : the regularization assumptions . as discussed in ",
    "[ fluc ] @xcite require that the temperatures and abundances vary approximately logarithmically with radius .",
    "however , we have shown that most of these systems , especially hgc 62 , have steep fe abundance gradients and thus these regularization criteria must be carefully checked .    in figure [ fig.fp ]",
    "we plot the radial profiles of temperature and fe abundance of hcg 62 obtained from the _ rosat _ deprojection analysis where we have used the old photospheric solar fe abundances for consistent comparison with finoguenov & ponman . because of the steep fe abundance gradient we chose a slope of 2 to bound the radial logarithmic fe abundance derivative .",
    "( we arrived at this choice after trying several different values and from comparison to results obtained without deprojection  see  [ fluc ] . )",
    "we also show the results when the maximum fe abundance derivative is set to 1 .",
    "these latter results agree well with the _ asca _ and _ rosat _ deprojection results of finoguenov & ponman ; e.g. , for @xmath130 kpc we obtain @xmath128 which is within the 90% limits of their _ asca _ result and in excellent agreement with their _ rosat _ value .",
    "this value is to be contrasted with @xmath131 obtained at that radius when we set the maximum fe abundance derivative to 2 .",
    "therefore , we attribute the smaller fe abundances obtained by finoguenov & ponman for hgc 62 to their overly restrictive regularization criteria .",
    "interestingly , unlike their _ asca _ analysis of hcg 62 , their _ rosat _ deprojection does not perform actual regularization but rather adopts simple smooth analytical models which apparently achieve the same effect .",
    "finoguenov & ponman do apply their regularization method to the deprojection of the _ rosat _ data of ngc 5044 , and we can only reproduce their temperatures and small fe abundances if we require the radial logarithmic derivatives of both the temperature and fe abundance to be @xmath132 !",
    "in fact , given the steep fe abundance gradients we obtain for most of the systems analyzed in the finoguenov papers over - smoothing probably accounts for most of the fe abundance differences between our papers .",
    "the fe abundance gradients of these bright , nearby cooling flow galaxies and groups reflect the history of star formation and the dynamical evolution of the hot gas in these systems . in figure [ fig.n4472 ]",
    "we compare the fe abundances we have measured for ngc 4472 with those predicted from a gas - dynamical metal enrichment model which assumes ( 1 ) a galactic imf , ( 2 ) accretion of primordial gas arising from secondary infall , and ( 3 ) a type ia supernova ( snia ) rate normalized to the observed value in nearby e / s0 galaxies reported by @xcite .",
    "the qualitative agreement is clear , though the deviations at larger radii indicate that the ram pressure distortions discussed by @xcite compromise to some extent the assumptions of spherical symmetry and hydrostatic equilibrium in the gas - dynamical model .",
    "the relative contributions of the supernovae to the fe abundance within @xmath133 kpc are consistent with the `` solar supernova proportion '' defined by @xcite : i.e. , enrichment models of the milky way indicate that 1/4 of the fe in the sun arises from type ii supernovae ( snii ) and the remaining 3/4 arises from snia .",
    "consequently , the approximately solar fe abundances we have found for the brightest galaxies and groups within @xmath4 kpc are consistent with models of the chemical enrichment of the milky way and allow for the possibility of a universal imf ( e.g. , renzini et al . 1993 ; renzini 1997 , 2000 ; wyse 1997 ) .",
    "the problems associated with the theoretical interpretation of the very sub - solar fe abundances inferred from previous studies of these systems ( e.g. , renzini et al . 1993 ; arimoto et al .",
    "1997 ; renzini 1997 ) are eliminated by the approximately solar fe abundances we have inferred from both _",
    "asca _ and _ rosat _ data of bright galaxies and groups .",
    "the sub - solar fe abundances at large radii require additional explanation , such as the dilution arising from the accretion of primordial material included in the model in figure [ fig.n4472 ] .",
    "an alternative explanation for negative fe abundance gradients as the consequence of the sedimentation of heavier elements ( fabian & pringle 1977 ; see qin & wu 2000 for a recent discussion ) seems less plausible since the drift velocities are generally similar to or less than the flow velocities in a cooling flow .",
    "we mention that the fe abundance at large radius ( @xmath134 kpc ) predicted by the model for ngc 4472 ( figure [ fig.n4472 ] ) arises entirely from snii ejecta .",
    "these snii explosions accompanied the initial burst of star formation which ended at a redshift before @xmath135 . hence , the fe abundance measured at such large radii is a direct fossil record of the ism abundance at high redshift . for those systems",
    "where we have measured fe abundances at @xmath136 kpc we find @xmath85 .",
    "if they are indeed the result of the initial snii enrichment these large fe abundances are consistent with the arguments that large quantities of the metals at high redshift reside in hot gaseous halos ( pettini 1999 , 2000 ) and that there was a prompt initial enrichment of the early universe ( renzini 1997 , 2000 ) .    finally , _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm _ will substantially clarify our understanding of the metal enrichment and gas dynamics in cooling flows .",
    "their superior spatial and spectral resolution will enable abundances to be measured on scales @xmath137 kpc which is critical since the _ rosat _ data suggest that the gradients may be largest at small radii (  [ results ] ) .",
    "these new missions will also allow accurate mapping of the abundances of several @xmath116 elements ( e.g. , si ) which is of special importance because the @xmath116/fe ratios provide the strongest constraints on the relative numbers of type ii and type ia supernovae .",
    "the detailed constraints on the supernovae feedback in these nearby cooling flows will be invaluable for interpreting the star formation process in galaxies at high redshift @xcite .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank the referee , j. irwin , for helpful comments , f. kelly for programming advice , and w. mathews for permission to include figure [ fig.n4472 ] in this paper .",
    "this research has made use of ( 1 ) data obtained through the high energy astrophysics science archive research center online service , provided by the nasa / goddard space flight center , and ( 2 ) the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under contract with nasa .",
    "support for this work was provided by nasa through chandra fellowship grant pf8 - 10001 awarded by the chandra science center , which is operated by the smithsonian astrophysical observatory for nasa under contract nas8 - 39073 .",
    "the edge correction factor , @xmath24 , given by equation a8 of @xcite evaluates to zero in both the numerator and denominator when @xmath34 .",

    "<S> previous studies of the fe abundances in the hot gas of galaxies and groups have reported conflicting results with most studies finding very sub - solar fe abundances that disagree with standard theory . to investigate the possible role of fe abundance gradients on these measurements we present deprojection analysis of the _ rosat _ pspc data of 10 of the brightest cooling flow galaxies and groups . </S>",
    "<S> the pspc allows for spatially resolved spectral analysis on a half - arcminute scale , and interesting constraints on both the temperatures and fe abundances are possible because the @xmath0 kev temperatures of these systems are well matched to the bandpass of the pspc . in 9 out of 10 systems </S>",
    "<S> we find clear evidence that the fe abundance decreases with increasing radius : @xmath1 within the central radial bin ( @xmath2 kpc ) which decreases to @xmath3 at the largest radii examined ( @xmath4 - 100 kpc ) . </S>",
    "<S> the fe abundances ( and temperatures ) are consistent with the average values for these systems that we obtained in our previous analyses of the _ asca _ data using multitemperature models which confirms that previous inferences of very sub - solar fe abundances from _ asca _ arise from the incorrect assumption of isothermal gas and not the presence of fe abundance gradients . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss why this `` fe bias '' affects much more seriously the measurements of from _ asca _ data than from _ rosat _ data . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the fe abundance profiles for these galaxies and groups are consistent with a gas - dynamical model where the gas is enriched by stellar ejecta and supernovae in the `` solar supernova proportion '' , the stars formed with a galactic imf , and the gas is diluted by mixing with primordial gas at large radii . </S>"
