    "liquid crystals are extraordinary systems in that they continue to have a revolutionary technological impact and to consistently pose new theoretical challenges of fundamental interest .",
    "they exhibit a rich variety of phases with symmetries intermediate between those of a the highest symmetry homogeneous isotropic liquid and the lowest - symmetry three - dimensional periodic crystal .",
    "in contrast to their magnetic and ferroelectric _ solid state _ analogs , whose ordering is driven by energy - entropy competition , liquid - crystal phase transitions are of predominantly entropic origin . not unrelated to this is the fact that , with one exception of the chiral smectic-@xmath6 phase@xcite , commonly observed liquid crystal phases are non - polar .",
    "it is , therefore , not surprising that a recent experimental discovery by the tokyo tech group@xcite of ferroelectricity in the liquid crystal phase of _ achiral _ bend - core ( banana ) molecules has captured the attention of the liquid crystal community .",
    "subsequent light microscopy studies by the boulder group@xcite elucidated the molecular organization of the newly discovered phase .",
    "they convincingly demonstrated that ( what came to be known as ) the @xmath7 phase@xcite is an antiferroelectric smectic-@xmath8 phase in which layers _ spontaneously _ break chiral symmetry ( with chirality alternating from layer to layer ) and exhibit polar order in achiral molecules .",
    "eight distinct phases of bent - core molecules , tentatively labeled @xmath9 to @xmath10 have been identified@xcite , though most have not been fully characterized .",
    "two of the most well studied the @xmath7 and @xmath11 , are smectic phases consisting of stacks of fluid layers with some internal tilt order , and are special because they can be switched with an electric field . a material composed of _ achiral _ nematogens having a ground state that is ferroelectric and _ homogeneously _ chiral has also recently been discovered.@xcite this experimental discovery opens up a vast new class of achiral molecules that nevertheless exhibit ferroelectricity and are therefore of interest to the liquid crystal display technology .",
    "while the study of banana liquid crystals has seen substantial experimental strides@xcite , there has been relatively little basic theoretical work on this fascinating new class of materials . brand _",
    "et al._@xcite presented an exhaustive , model - independent classification of the symmetry - allowed smectic phases , and roy _",
    "et al._@xcite introduced a phenomenological landau model that produces many of the banana smectic phases .",
    "there are also a number of numerical simulations@xcite on systems of model bent - core molecules that produce nematic phases as well as some of the possible smectic phases . because so far , experimental examples of orientationally - ordered but spatially homogeneous phases _ liquid _ phases@xcite are rare , most of the efforts have focussed on the _ smectic _ phases of bent - core molecules . here , we will instead focus on spatially homogeneous phases , which we will refer to as _ liquid _ phases , the understanding and classifying of whose phase behavior is in many ways a prerequisite to the study of more ordered ( e.g. , smectic ) phases , which in addition break translational symmetry .",
    "we will take advantage of the formal developments and analysis presented in this paper for the liquid phases in our studies of smectic phases , which we defer to a future publication.@xcite    the first primary conclusion of our work , which forms the starting point of all further analysis presented here , is that a _",
    "third_-rank traceless symmetric tensor order parameter @xmath0 , in addition to the usual nematic @xmath12 and vector @xmath13 order parameters , is necessary in order to capture the orientational order observed in experiments on banana molecules . without introducing such an angular momentum",

    "[ flowchart ] ) of possible liquid phases emerges and , associated with them , a very rich phase behavior .",
    "many of these phases exhibit exotic symmetries summarized in table 1 , including d@xmath16 , d@xmath17 , and c@xmath17 symmetries@xcite , which have not to our knowledge been previously identified in spatially uniform ( i.e. , liquid ) states .",
    "these new anisotropic liquid phases are distinguished by the nature of their @xmath0 ordering .",
    "the diversity in phase diagram topologies originates from a large number of symmetry - allowed transition sequences between many of the phases that exhibit some nontrivial combination of the @xmath13 , @xmath12 and/or @xmath0 order parameters . some of the novel orientationally - ordered liquid states that we predict",
    "are the spontaneously chiral nematic @xmath1 and chiral polar @xmath18 phases , an optically isotropic tetrahedratic @xmath3 phase , and a novel nematic @xmath4 phase , with @xmath5 symmetry , that is neither uniaxial nor biaxial , but rather exhibits a 4-fold improper ( @xmath19 ) rotational symmetry about its nematic axis .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ model ] , we present a model of a banana - shaped liquid - crystal molecule . by considering mass moments of molecules with this shape , we are naturally led to introduce the three important order parameters , @xmath13 , @xmath12 and @xmath0 , that are necessary to fully describe anisotropic liquid states into which such molecules can macroscopically order . in sec .",

    "[ conclusions ] by summarizing our results and discussing their relevance to future studies of smectic phases and to experiments .",
    "as is clear from a chemically and geometrically accurate schematic of a bent - core molecule , shown in fig.[molecule ] , the most notable characteristic of banana molecules is their `` v '' shape with bent , ( on average ) planar and therefore achiral cores .",
    "this shape earned such molecules a name `` bow''-shaped .",
    "the molecule is characterized by c@xmath20 symmetry , defined by a non - polar direction @xmath21 ( the `` string '' of the bow ) , pointing from one endpoint of the `` v '' to the other and an orthogonal polar axis @xmath22 ( the bow s `` arrow '' ) , pointing to the vertex of the `` v '' , as illustrated in fig .",

    "as is the case for standard nematogens where transitions are driven by entropic interactions , we expect that the dominant ordering mechanisms of banana liquid crystals will be associated with the shape of the molecule and not with electric dipoles .",
    "we , therefore , focus on the mass - moment tensors as the important order parameters for this problem .",
    "that is , throughout the paper we will assume that the liquid crystal ordering is driven by steric interactions and , therefore , that it is the _",

    "similarly , a given molecule will in general be characterized by @xmath55 independent third - rank mass - moment tensors . by utilizing @xmath56 rotational degrees of freedom ( e.g. , euler s angles )",
    "it is always possible to choose the axes @xmath53 so that there are only four independent such tensors .",
    "our model of a bent - core molecule is sufficiently simple , that , with our convenient choice of basis vectors @xmath53 , each molecule is characterized by only @xmath57 non - vanishing third - rank tensors .",

    "one primary conclusion of our work is that in addition to the vector ( @xmath13 ) and second - rank nematic ( @xmath12 ) order parameters , a third - rank tensor order parameter @xmath0 , representing third - mass moment , is necessary to characterize novel liquid - crystal phases of banana molecules , such as for example the @xmath4 phase with @xmath5 symmetry , the tetrahedratic @xmath3 phase , and the spontaneously chiral nematic @xmath1 and its chiral polar analog @xmath217 . in these phases the chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken by `` condensation '' of the biaxial @xmath133 and tetrahedratic @xmath168 order parameters with a nonvanishing angle @xmath573 between their respective principle axes @xmath574 ( see fig.[n_tphases](b ) ) .",
    "the @xmath4 phase is neither uniaxial nor biaxial but instead exhibits an invariance with respect to a four - fold improper rotation consisting of a rotation through @xmath565 about the @xmath456-axis followed by an reflection @xmath575 .",

    ", it has a nonvanishing second order nonlinear susceptibility @xmath576 such that there is a second order contribution to the polarization @xmath577 where @xmath578 is the electric field .    the chiral nematic @xmath176 phase , like the traditional chiral cholesteric and blue phases , will exhibit periodic spatial modulations of the direction of molecular alignment . unlike the transition from the isotropic to the cholesteric phase , the transitions to the @xmath392 phase ( from the biaxial @xmath131 phase , the tetrahedratic @xmath3 phase and the @xmath4 phase with @xmath5 symmetry ) are second - order , at least in mean - field theory .",
    "the pitch of the cholesteric structure of the @xmath392 phase diverges as these second - order transitions are approached and thus changes rapidly with temperature .",
    "since the @xmath392 phase spontaneously breaks chiral symmetry , the state initially formed upon cooling from the higher - symmetry phase will consist of domains of opposite chirality separated by domain wall that will coarsen over time .",
    "chiral dopants ( or distortions of bent - core mesogens to make them chiral ) render all phases chiral and , in particular , induce a cholesteric pitch of a particular sign on the chiral extensions @xmath416 ,",
    "@xmath579 , and @xmath580 , of the @xmath581 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 phases .",
    "thus chiral dopants act like an external field in an ising ferromagnet , favoring a particular sign of chirality ( rather than a particular sign of spin ) , and the transitions from the @xmath416 , @xmath579 , and @xmath580 phases to the @xmath392 phase will be analogous to the ising transition in an external magnetic field . in principle , for sufficiently large chirality , blue phases , with two orthogonal twist axes can also appear in @xmath1 .",
    "in addition to these properties of the nonpolar @xmath1 phase , the chiral _ polar _ @xmath217 phase will exhibit spontaneous ferroelectricity , a liquid state that has been a holy - grail in liquid - crystal research dating back to louis pasteur",
    ". light - scattering , circular dichroism and switching with a weak electric field would be natural experimental probes for these spontaneously chiral states .",
    "these chiral phases are particularly interesting because their smectic analogs , the chiral sm@xmath561 , sm@xmath562 , sm@xmath563 , and sm@xmath559 ( the four b@xmath17 phases)@xcite have been realized in banana liquid crystal molecules , generating significant excitement in the ferroelectric liquid - crystal community .",
    "our work suggests that smectic positional order is not necessary and that spatially homogeneous spontaneously chiral liquid - crystal phases are generically possible .",
    "although , most@xcite experimental systems of banana molecules studied so far , appear to undergo direct first - order transitions into smectic phases , our work suggests that this situation does not have to be the case , and a rich phase structure and hierarchy of continuous transitions studied here is possible .",
