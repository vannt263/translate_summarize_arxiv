    "it is a common notion that the laughlin state is incompressible .",
    "this statement however relates to a thermodynamical property and does not contradict the fact that even an arbitrarily small impurity potential locally changes the electron density , fig .",
    "[ fig-14 ] .    as a function of the impurity strength @xmath9 , the local density at the position of the impurity @xmath10 shows three distinct types of behaviour marked by i ,",
    "ii and iii in fig .",
    "[ fig-21 ] .",
    "the boundary between i and ii can roughly be identified with the incompressibility gap @xmath11 . while the density change @xmath12 is roughly proportional to @xmath9 for @xmath13 ( region ii ) , reminiscent of a standard compressible behaviour as of a fermi gas or liquid ,",
    "the density change is proportional to @xmath14 for weak impurities ( region i ) .",
    "the latter non - linear region does not appear in earlier data@xcite on a sphere and we attribute it to the center - of - mass part of the wavefunction as we explain below .",
    "finally , the response diverts again from the linear regime for very strong impurities ( region iii ) .",
    "we will not investigate this regime here and focus only on the regions of @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "we find that the polarized @xmath1 , @xmath5 and @xmath3 states all respond similarly to isolated impurities , represented in this paper by a weak @xmath4-line impurity . since @xmath3 gives slightly different results than the other two systems we conclude that the particle - hole conjugation ( @xmath7 and @xmath5 ) is a stronger link than the reversal of the effective field in the composite fermion picture ( @xmath5 and @xmath3 ) .",
    "the singlet states react differently : both @xmath5 and @xmath3 respond quite unequally and more weakly to an electric potential impurity than @xmath7 .",
    "in particular , @xmath5 gives a much weaker response than @xmath7 .",
    "this was unexpected because the laughlin state has the largest incompressibility gap .",
    "the spin - resolved _ and _ spin - unresolved density - density correlation functions of the @xmath5 singlet state suggest that electrons in it appear in zero - spin pairs with characteristic size of @xmath17 magnetic lengths and these form a full - landau - level - like state .",
    "high polarizability by magnetic impurities and a relatively small effect of impurities affecting only one spin species are compatible with this interpretation .",

    "<S> using exact diagonalization we examine the response of several most prominent fractional quantum hall states to a single local impurity . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 singlet state is found to be more inert than the polarized one in spite of its smaller incompressibility gap . based on its spin - spin correlation functions </S>",
    "<S> we interpret it as a liquid of electron pairs with opposite spin . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison of different types of impurities , non  magnetic and magnetic , is presented .    </S>",
    "<S> the effect of impurities on the incompressible ground states was in the focus of many theoretical studies since the early days of the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) . </S>",
    "<S> the principal interest is based on the knowledge that the fqhe occurs only in high mobility samples implying that random electric potential ubiquitous in experiments leads to a decrease of the incompressibility gap eventually destroying the incompressibility completely . </S>",
    "<S> a large part of the theoretical work therefore deals with random ensembles of impurities@xcite and this , due to the complexity of such calculations , in context of the most robust incompressible fqh state , bearing the name of r.  laughlin , which occurs at filling factor@xcite @xmath1 .    </S>",
    "<S> a single impurity can , however , be also viewed as a probe into the correlated state revealing additional information on its properties and nature@xcite . beyond this , as we believe fundamental interest , this information may help to understand new correlated states for which only numerical many - body wavefunctions are available . </S>",
    "<S> the particular example we bear in mind are the half - polarized states at @xmath2 and @xmath3 discovered first in optical experiments@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> numerically , the wavefunctions of suitable candidates can be obtained by exact diagonalization but it was not possible to link them conclusively with any of the physical states proposed subsequently@xcite@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the current study of the parent polarized and unpolarized states may provide a guideline to achieve this .    first , the laughlin wavefunction is investigated and different regimes regarding tis response to a point impurity are identified . here </S>",
    "<S> , we build on the seminal articles of zhang@xcite and rezayi@xcite . a comparison between point and @xmath4-line impurities , </S>",
    "<S> is presented . </S>",
    "<S> proceeding to filling factors @xmath5 and @xmath3 , it proves advantageous to apply different types of impurities , magnetic and non - magnetic . </S>",
    "<S> this investigation reveals basic structural properties of the various fqh states like local density and polarization responses to impurities . </S>",
    "<S> based on these , we propose that the @xmath2 singlet state is a @xmath6 liquid of electron pairs with opposite spin .    </S>",
    "<S> we recall that the three filling factors studied here , @xmath7 , @xmath5 and @xmath3 are all closely related . in the composite fermion ( cf ) </S>",
    "<S> picture@xcite , they correspond to filling factors @xmath8 equal to 1 , 2 and 2 respectively and the last two differ only in the direction of the effective field . </S>",
    "<S> systems at @xmath2 and @xmath3 can therefore be expected to behave very similarly , at least within the mean field of the cf . on the other hand , with the spin degree of freedom frozen out ( e.g. by large zeeman energy ) , </S>",
    "<S> the ground states at @xmath1 and @xmath5 are identical up to a particle - hole conjugation@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> here we show how far these statements of close relationship apply when the excitations become involved in addition to the ground states as it is the case with inhomogeneous systems . </S>"
