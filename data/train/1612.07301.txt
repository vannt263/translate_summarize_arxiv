    "manganites have been the subject of renewed interest in the last years , due to the coupling of various order parameters , resulting in effects such as colossal magnetoresistance and multiferroicity .",
    "the divalent alkaline - earth based manganites , of the form amno@xmath2 ( where a is ca , sr or ba ) have a simpler electronic structure than the rare - earth based manganites , since the mn ions can be considered formally as mn@xmath5 , and there is no jahn - teller distortion resulting from partially filled @xmath6 orbitals . in these compounds ,",
    "the observed structure is related to the ion sizes .",
    "the relation between interatomic distances and structure can be understood by the tolerance factor @xmath7  @xcite , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the interatomic distances : @xmath10 corresponds to the ideal perovskite structure ; values greater than one are found in hexagonal manganites , where the number of mno@xmath11 octahedra which share faces instead of vertices ( as in the ideal perovskite ) is increased ; values of @xmath12 smaller than one are concomitant with an orthorhombic structure . in its ground state at low temperature , camno@xmath2 is orthorhombic , due to the smaller radius of ca@xmath13 ( and tolerance factor ) , while srmno@xmath2 and bamno@xmath2 are hexagonal . in spite of this apparent simplicity ,",
    "the synthesis of the sr or ba systems is quite complex .",
    "an accurate control of the thermodynamic conditions , temperature and oxygen partial pressure , in the preparation and in the cooling steps ( slow cool or quenching ) is very important to obtain a given phase .",
    "the ba manganite , for example , can be synthesized in the non - stoichiometric form bamno@xmath14 with different values of @xmath15 ( e.g.  adkin and hayward  @xcite ) .",
    "various polymorphs of hexagonal structures can be synthesized , corresponding to different sizes for one - dimensional strings of face - sharing octahedra , for example : hexagonal two - layer 2h ( ab ) , where strings of face - sharing mn - o octahedra have infinite length , or hexagonal 6h ( abcacb ) , hexagonal 4h ( abac ) , and rhombohedral 15r , where these strings are periodically broken ( see figure  [ structs ] ) .    there are some experimental measurements of structural and magnetic properties carried on different forms of bamno@xmath2  @xcite and srmno@xmath2 .",
    "@xcite the computational methods that enable first - principles calculations have also given a good understanding of these compounds .",
    "density functional theory ( dft ) calculations have been performed for the study of these systems , with detailed analysis of the density of states , band gaps , band structures and chemical bonding in the ca / ba / sr manganites  @xcite , of the magnetic and structural properties  @xcite , and heat capacity and lattice dynamics  @xcite of cubic and hexagonal srmno@xmath2 .",
    "hartree - fock calculations have also been used for the study of magnetic and electronic properties in camno@xmath2  @xcite .",
    "these works showed good reliability of the calculations .",
    "there have been interesting developments in the perovskite type structure form of these compounds : recently , dft studies have predicted ferroelectric instabilities in specific strain conditions for camno@xmath2  @xcite , srmno@xmath2  @xcite , and bamno@xmath2  @xcite , giving these materials the possibility of being multiferroics .",
    "more recently , this promise was realized with the perovskite mixed manganite sr@xmath16ba@xmath16mno@xmath2 , which is ferroelectric , with large polarization due to displacement - type mn off - centering , and possesses large magnetoelectric effects  @xcite .",
    "a dft and model analysis  @xcite traced the ferroelectricity to the mn - o in - plane hopping which is distortion dependent , and has shown that ferroelectricity appears in the magnetic ordered phase despite a large negative magnetoelectric coupling .    in this work",
    ", we will use a combined theoretical ( dft calculations ) and experimental hyperfine [ perturbed angular correlation spectroscopy ( pac ) ] approach . in a previous work",
    "@xcite , some of us have presented first - principles calculations on the camno@xmath2 system , with the goal of understanding pac results with a @xmath0cd@xmath17cd probe .",
    "this probe has the particular advantage of keeping the element unchanged during the measurement .",
    "we considered the incorporation of a cd impurity in the manganite matrix , to calculate the properties at the probe location .",
    "here we use the same approach for the first - principles calculations , and expand the pac study to the other alkaline - earth manganites , of ba and sr , with the same @xmath0cd@xmath18cd probe , and also with the @xmath1in@xmath18cd probe in one case .",
    "monophasic samples were synthesized : bamno@xmath2 in the 6h phase and 15r phases , and srmno@xmath2 in the 4h phase .",
    "we will direct our first - principles calculations to the electric field gradient ( efg ) , which is compared directly to the experimental pac data .",
    "we selected these three single phase samples in order to have examples of different polymorphs , to see to what extent the different kinds of local environments affect the efg , allowing us to simplify the fits and analysis of the spectra in each case .",
    "the diagonalized efg tensor , with components conventionally named according to their magnitudes @xmath19 , is usually characterized by @xmath20 and the asymmetry parameter @xmath21 .",
    "a local hyperfine property has several advantages , e.g. , it can be related to chemical bonding and structure and can distinguish between different local environments , such as different lattice sites , and local defects in the probe s neighborhood . since the efg depends sensitively on the electron density its calculation will also be a good test of the theory in these systems .    finally , due to the interest in the magnetoelectric coupling in this family of materials , the above mentioned multiferroic will be studied by _",
    "ab initio _ calculations , in order to predict the measured efgs in this compound , and its variation with the structural degrees of freedom .    in the next sections we present results of calculations for srmno@xmath2 ( section  [ fpcalcsmo ] ) and for different polymorphs of bamno@xmath2 ( section  [ fpcalcbmo ] ) , and discuss the results .",
    "direct comparison with the experiments is done by performing the calculations with diluted cd supercells , for the cases of 4h - srmno@xmath2 and 6h - bamno@xmath2 .",
    "the experimental results are presented in section  [ experiments ] in the same order , with its interpretation in relation to calculations . in section  [ sbmo ]",
    "we show our analysis of efg calculations in the multiferroic perovskite manganite sr@xmath3ba@xmath3mno@xmath2  @xcite , and its possible variation with the polarization and structural changes .",
    "we conclude with a summary .",
    "for the study of hexagonal manganites , we use the mixed lapw / apw+lo full potential method , as implemented in the wien2k package  @xcite , which is known to provide accurate results , including the hyperfine parameters . in this method",
    "the space is divided in atom - centered spheres and the interstitial space .",
    "the wave functions inside the spheres are expanded in atomic like functions , linear combinations of spherical harmonics times radial functions . in the interstitial region",
    "the wave functions are expanded in plane waves .",
    "several k - points grids and maximum wave numbers for the plane waves were tested in the simple cases to obtain a good convergence of total energy and efgs . when calculating larger supercells the number of k - points is diminished in conformity with the increasing size of the supercell .",
    "the gga functional from wu and cohen  @xcite is used for all the calculations except if noted otherwise .",
    "core states are treated fully - relativistically while valence states are treated in the scalar - relativistic approximation .",
    "the vasp code  @xcite also allows calculation of efg tensors , and it will be used later ( section  [ sbmo ] ) on in the multiferroic compound . it has been shown that both codes produce similar efg values variations with polarization in ferroelectric perovskites  @xcite .",
    "srmno@xmath2 with the 4h structure has the space group number 194 , @xmath22 .",
    "the wyckoff positions and fractional coordinates of the atoms in this structure are the following : sr1 : 2a ; sr2 : 2c ; mn : 4f ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) ; o1 : 6 g ; o2 : 6h ( -@xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) . with the experimental data of battle",
    "@xcite @xmath29 and @xmath30 , and the lattice parameters are @xmath31  , @xmath32  .",
    "we used this structure as a starting point for our calculations . after relaxing the free atomic coordinates to calculated atomic forces less than @xmath33 ev /  ,",
    "the atomic coordinates are @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "this corresponds to small variations of @xmath36 and @xmath37 for @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the small variation of @xmath38 is within the experimental error .",
    "the lattice parameters were not optimized , since usually the experimental ones are more dependable . in this case",
    "we found that a mesh of @xmath39 k - points and @xmath40 ( where @xmath41 is the smallest muffin - tin sphere radius , and @xmath42 is the largest wave number used in the plane wave expansion ) is enough for reasonably converged results , but more stringent criteria are used in the actual results .",
    "table  [ smo4hefgfaaf ] shows that the efg values are similar for both experimental and theoretically relaxed structures , when assuming ferromagnetic ( f ) arrangement of mn atoms , as should be expected if the calculations are accurate .",
    "( units of @xmath43 vm@xmath44 will be used throughout this paper . )",
    "we also considered the magnetic state where neighbor mn planes in the @xmath45 direction have opposite spin polarization .",
    "this antiferromagnetism , called a - af  @xcite , is the stable magnetic order at low temperatures . for this case",
    "the deviation of the theoretically optimized structure in relation to the initial experimental structure is even smaller , as expected . with the experimental structure",
    ", this order is stable in relation to the ferromagnetic state by @xmath46 ev / f.u .",
    "according to our calculations .",
    "the structural coordinates are not moved more than 0.09% relative to the experimental value in the case of @xmath25 .",
    "both parameters are equal to the experimental ones within the experimental error .",
    "this translates into almost exactly equal hyperfine parameters for the theoretical and experimental structures , even more so than in the f case .",
    "nevertheless , the agreement is already good for the f state , therefore , in the following calculations , when we introduce cd impurities , ferromagnetism is considered for simplicity , and furthermore , because in the temperature range where we will measure and compare with theory srmno@xmath2 should be paramagnetic  @xcite .",
    "we show that the influence of the different magnetic states in the efg is small , for all atoms , in table  [ smo4hefgfaaf ] .    .calculated @xmath20(@xmath43 vm@xmath44 ) of 4h - srmno@xmath2 , with the f and a - af magnetic configurations , experimental and relaxed structures .",

    "we present a hyperfine local probing of bamno@xmath2 - 6h , -15r , and srmno@xmath2 - 4h manganites .",
    "the values of the efg were measured with the @xmath0cd and @xmath1 in probes using the pac method .",
    "it is found that @xmath20 is roughly constant in a range of temperatures 20 - 700c , for both bamno@xmath2 - 6h and srmno@xmath2 .",
    "first - principles calculations of the efg with the accurate ( l)apw+lo method are reported .",
    "the calculated efg at all atoms is shown , with srmno@xmath2 in the low temperature structure , and various polytype structures of bamno@xmath2 .",
    "the values are largely insensitive to the magnetic order or approximation used , and the relaxed structures give consistent results the experimental structures . for direct comparison with the experiments , we performed calculations with supercells and introducing a cd impurity substitutional at the alkaline - earth sites . in the case of srmno@xmath2",
    "there is a good qualitative agreement , which shows that the cd probe occupies the sr sites . for the case of bamno@xmath2 - 6h , although the calculated values are of the order of one of the measured @xmath20 values , other high values remain incompatible with the divalent alkaline - earth substitution . for bamno@xmath2 - 15r , the efg has values of the order expected if cd occupies the ba sites .",
    "finally , we analyze the efgs in the multiferroic perovskite manganite sr@xmath16ba@xmath16mno@xmath4 , and find that they should be approximately constant for a wide range of structures .",
