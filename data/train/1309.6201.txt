    "multiple parton interactions ( mpi ) have been introduced in the dynamical description of hadronic collisions as a natural solution of the unitarity problem , originated at high energies by the rapid growth of the hard cross sections at small @xmath4@xcite .",
    "the inclusive cross section is in fact proportional to the multiplicity of elementary partonic interactions and the increasingly large values of the cross section are in this way understood as the result of an increasingly large average number of elementary interactions in an inelastic event .",
    "each elementary partonic interaction is localized in transverse space , inside the much larger overlap region of the matter distribution of the colliding hadrons .",
    "a given final state can of course be produced by different mpi processes , which contribute to the cross section with different weights . at small @xmath4 , the leading contribution is provided by the term that maximizes the number of interacting partons , which corresponds to the processes where the hard component of the interaction is maximally disconnected . in the simplest case , namely in double parton scattering ( dps ) , the dominant contribution to the cross section at small @xmath4 is thus given by the term where two different pairs of partons interact independently in two different points in transverse space .",
    "as recently pointed out@xcite , the typical back to back configuration of four large @xmath5 partons , produced in a dps by the leading contribution at small @xmath4 and utilized as a distinctive signature for the experimental search of dps events , can be generated also by a hard interaction involving three partons in the initial state , all localized in the same point in transverse space .",
    "the initial partonic flux in @xmath6 processes is very different as compared to the initial partonic flux of @xmath7 processes and , as discussed in @xcite , the typical unbalance of the final state parton pairs is rather different in the two cases .",
    "the initial state partonic flux is a measurable quantity and a careful study of the dependence of the cross section on the initial state fractional momenta and on the momentum unbalance should be able to separate experimentally the contributions , to the observed dps cross section , due to @xmath6 processes from the leading ones at small @xmath4 . in the present paper we will focus on the disconnected component of dps in @xmath0-@xmath0 and in @xmath0-@xmath1 collisions , while the problem of the experimental identification and subtraction of a possible @xmath6 background to the observed dps cross section lies outside our scopes and will not be discussed in the present paper . with dps",
    "we will thus refer specifically to the contribution to the inclusive cross section due to disconnected hard interactions .",
    "when dealing with disconnected hard interactions , the simplest assumption , which leads to very compact results , is that the different partons with small @xmath4 in the proton are uncorrelated with each other . on the other hand several different types of correlations can be expected and the topic of correlations has addressed a lot of attention@xcite .",
    "in addition to the dependence on the kinematical variables , dps amplitudes are in fact expected to depend on spin and color , which induce interference terms in the cross section .",
    "color - correlations are sudakov suppressed , and thus small for double parton scattering at high energies@xcite .",
    "more important are probably spin correlations , which are expected to affect the rate of double parton scattering and the angular distribution of the final state in particular reaction channels , even if partons are not polarized@xcite .",
    "the study of correlations in dps is therefore a rather rich topic and a proper approach to the problem requires the introduction of flavor and spin dependent double parton distribution functions .",
    "the issue is still under theoretical investigation , while present experimental results can not yet provide indications on the relative importance of different spin and flavor contributions to the double parton distributions .",
    "a complete description of dps in @xmath0-@xmath1 collisions , even without considering possible @xmath6 contributions , including however all terms required to account for the dependence on flavor and spin , is therefore still premature . on the other hand there are reasons to expects that , in @xmath0-@xmath1 collisions , the basic features of dps will change substantially as compared with the case of dps in @xmath0-@xmath0@xcite",
    ". it may be therefore instructive to work out explicitly the expectations of dps in @xmath0-@xmath1 collisions , when assuming the simplest possible scenario , still not in contradiction with present experimental evidence of dps in @xmath0-@xmath0 collisions .",
    "the simplest possibility is to neglect the effects of spin and color in the disconnected component of the dps cross section .",
    "the dps cross section is thus factorized into functions , which depend on the fractional momenta of the interacting partons , on the resolution of the hard processes and on the relative transverse distance @xmath8 between the two interaction points .",
    "the expression of the cross section , for two parton processes @xmath1 and @xmath9 in a @xmath0-@xmath0 collision , is thus given by    @xmath10    where @xmath11 are the double parton distribution functions and the dependence on the fractional momenta of the interacting partons , @xmath12 , and on their relative transverse distance @xmath8 is explicitly indicated , while the dependence on the scales of the two hard processes @xmath1 and @xmath9 is understood .",
    "the indices @xmath13 and @xmath14 label partons flavors . for identical interactions @xmath15 and @xmath16 otherwise .",
    "@xmath17 , @xmath18 are the two elementary cross sections .",
    "eq.([eq : sdouble ] ) may lead to a very simple expression , were the cross section is given by the product of the two single scattering inclusive cross sections of the hard processes @xmath1 and @xmath9 :    @xmath19    which is the `` pocket formula '' utilized in all experimental analyses of dps@xcite .",
    "all unknowns in the process converge in this way in the value of a single quantity with the dimensions of a cross section , @xmath20 , which is therefore expected to depend on fractional momenta , resolution , parton flavors and on the two - body correlation parameters , which characterize the double parton distributions .",
    "eq.([eq : double ] ) has a transparent physical meaning .",
    "when hard interactions are rare , the probability of having also the process @xmath9 in an inelastic interaction is given by the ratio @xmath21 .",
    "once the process @xmath1 takes place , the probability of having the process @xmath9 in the same inelastic interaction is different .",
    "it can anyway be always written as @xmath22 , where @xmath20 plays _ effectively _ the role , which was of the inelastic cross section in the unbiased case .",
    "notice that , although @xmath20 is related to the transverse distance between the two hard interactions , it can not be understood as the effective transverse interaction area , since @xmath20 depends also on the multi - parton distributions in multiplicity . while initial fractional momenta and resolution are measured in the final state and the dependence of @xmath20 on parton flavors can be obtained , at least to a certain extent , by selecting different reaction channels , the effects of the dependence on the partonic distributions in multiplicity and on the correlation in the relative transverse distance , can not be disentangled by looking only at @xmath0-@xmath0 collisions .",
    "even in the simplest scenario , @xmath20 is thus expected to depend on flavor and on all kinematical variables . in spite of that ,",
    "eq.([eq : double ] ) has shown to be able to describe the experimental results of the direct search of double parton collisions in rather different reaction channels and kinematical regimes@xcite with a value of @xmath20 not incompatible with a universal constant , while the study of cdf@xcite , of the dependence of @xmath20 on the fractional momenta of the incoming partons , is again not inconsistent with a value of @xmath20 independent on @xmath4 .",
    "when the dps cross section is generalized by introducing parton distributions depending on transverse momenta and off shell t - matrix elements , the same value of @xmath20 allows describing dps also in the regime of very small @xmath4 , where the back to back kinematical configuration , typical of the large @xmath5 partons originated by dps , is lost .",
    "the observed production rates of @xmath23 are thus understood@xcite , while the production of different combinations of charmed mesons , the differential distributions in the @xmath24 invariant mass and the azimuthal correlation between two @xmath25 mesons , as worked out in@xcite , are not incompatible with the recent measurements of the lhcb collaboration@xcite .",
    "one should underline that the experimental indication , of a value of @xmath20 consistent with a universal constant , represents a non trivial test of the simple interaction mechanism leading to eq .. the expression of @xmath26 in eq .",
    "depends in fact rather strongly on the kinematical conditions of the observed process .",
    "in particular the dependence on the incoming parton flux is much stronger as compared with the case of a single hard scattering process .",
    "as already noticed , although @xmath20 is directly related to parton correlations , even in the simplest scenario , by measuring dps only in @xmath0-@xmath0 collisions one does not have enough information to decide how much the observed value of @xmath20 is originated by the typical separation in transverse space between the two pairs of interacting partons and how much it is rather due to the actual distribution in multiplicity of parton pairs in the hadronic structure .",
    "additional information to discriminate between the two cases can be nevertheless obtained by studying dps in @xmath0-@xmath1 collisions .",
    "mpi in @xmath0-@xmath1 collisions introduce in fact novel features in the process .",
    "a relevant novel feature is that one may have mpi , where two or more target nucleons are active participants in the hard process@xcite .",
    "a relevant consequence of having two or more active target nucleons is that while in the simplest picture of the interaction considered here , in @xmath0-@xmath0 collisions mpi are described by the incoherent superposition of sets of elementary partonic interactions@xcite@xcite , in @xmath0-@xmath1 collisions interference terms may , on the contrary , play an important role@xcite .",
    "to have some quantitative indication on the impact of the different features of dps in @xmath0-@xmath1 collisions , we will study the simplest option , where in @xmath0-@xmath0 collisions @xmath20 is a universal constant and it is completely determined by the typical transverse distance , between the two pairs of interacting partons , and by the multiplicity of parton pairs in the hadronic structure .",
    "we will further simplify the problem by selecting a suitable reaction channel , where there are no contributions of interference terms in @xmath0-@xmath1 collisions .",
    "one can then show that the multiplicity of pairs of partons and their typical transverse separation have rather different effects on the dps cross section in @xmath0-@xmath0 and in @xmath0-@xmath1 collisions .",
    "the amount of increase of the cross section when going to @xmath0-@xmath1 can be in fact linked in a rather direct way to the multiplicity of parton pairs in the projectile , while the effects of the typical separation of the parton pairs in transverse space are only of minor importance .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we recall some of the main features of dps in @xmath0-@xmath0 and in @xmath0-@xmath1 collisions . in the following section we discuss the case of @xmath2 production .",
    "a section is devoted to illustrate , with some numerical estimates , the different effects on the @xmath0-@xmath1 cross section of varying either the multiplicity of pairs of partons or their relative transverse distance .",
    "the last section is dedicated to the summarizing remarks .",
    "it has been pointed out that , for sufficiently small values of @xmath8 , the distributions @xmath27 can be expressed in terms of known quantities@xcite . for small @xmath8 , @xmath27 may be obtained from a single - parton distribution times a perturbative dynamics , which yields the splitting function for the longitudinal variables and a @xmath28 singularity in the transverse relative distance .",
    "the divergent behavior of the dps cross section at small @xmath8 needs therefore to be properly subtracted and the subtraction terms included in the single scattering contribution .",
    "the issue of subtraction of the divergent contribution and of the correlation in fractional momenta , induced by perturbative splitting , has been discussed by several authors and is still a matter of debate , in particular for what concerns the qcd evolution of the double parton distribution functions@xcite .",
    "the common origin of the initial state partons , in the small @xmath8 region , leaves anyway track in the dps cross section .",
    "a main qualitative feature is the presence of additional contributions , which however can not be considered any more as disconnected in transverse space and can not be expressed by eq.([eq : sdouble ] ) .",
    "the importance of these contributions grows with the fractional momenta of the incoming partons and would thus induce a measurable dependence of @xmath20 on the initial state fractional momenta .",
    "although there was no systematic study of the @xmath4 dependence , the available experimental evidence does not seem to imply a sizable dependence of @xmath20 on the initial state fractional momenta . as stated in the introduction",
    ", we will therefore take the simplified attitude of assuming that possible additional contributions to the measured dps cross section can be identified and subtracted experimentally and we will focus on the disconnected dps interaction mechanism .",
    "disregarding for simplicity the dependence on flavor and on the resolution , one may introduce    @xmath29    where @xmath30 are the usual one - body distribution functions . without any loss of generality , one may thus write    @xmath31    with @xmath32 .",
    "one has    @xmath33    where    @xmath34    the effective cross section is therefore given by    @xmath35    and @xmath36 measures the typical transverse distance between the pairs of interacting partons , for given values of fractional momenta , while @xmath37 gives the second moment of the multiparton exclusive multiplicity distribution .",
    "more precisely @xmath38@xcite in such a way that , in the simplest case of a poissonian distribution in multiplicity , one would have @xmath39 .",
    "present experimental indication is that the effective cross section depends only weakly on fractional momenta .    as apparent in eq.([eq : seff ] ) , in nucleon - nucleon collisions all effects due to parton correlations are summarized in the value of a single quantity ( the effective cross section ) and nucleon - nucleon collisions alone do not allow to measure @xmath40 and @xmath41 separately . to obtain additional information on multi - parton correlations one needs to study dps @xmath0-@xmath1 collisions .    obviously double ( and more in general multiple ) parton scatterings are more abundant in reactions with nuclei .",
    "dps are thus more interesting in @xmath0-@xmath1 collisions . when non additive corrections to the nuclear parton distributions are only a minor effect , in @xmath0-@xmath1 collisions dps originate either from interactions with a single active target nucleon or from interactions with two different active target nucleons .",
    "while the first contribution does not add much to the information already available from dps on a isolated nucleon , the second contribution has the peculiar property of _ enhancing the effects of longitudinal correlations in the proton_. in the latter case the relative transverse distance between the interacting pairs does not play in fact any relevant role , when compared to the much larger nuclear radius@xcite . by selecting the contribution to dps , with two active target nucleons , one will hence have direct access to the longitudinal correlations of the hadron structure .",
    "the cross section thus splits into two terms :    @xmath42    which correspond to the two different contributions , where the double hard interaction takes place with one or with two different target nucleons . in a simplest probabilistic picture of the interaction",
    "one would write    @xmath43    where the case of two identical partonic interactions has been considered . here",
    "@xmath44 is the inclusive single scattering cross section and @xmath45 is the nuclear thickness , as a function of the impact parameter of the collisions @xmath9 .",
    "the two terms have a transparent geometrical meaning and are distinguished by their different dependence on the atomic mass number @xmath1 .",
    "-@xmath1 interaction amplitude : a ) diagonal term , b ) interference term , width=529 ]    a closer look at the kinematics of the process@xcite , shows however that one needs to take into account an additional contribution to the cross section . the diagonal term @xmath46 in eq.([eq : glauber ] ) , does not exhaust in fact all possibilities of interaction and , in the case of two different active target nucleons , one needs to add an interference term .",
    "the two terms are conveniently expressed as contributions to the discontinuity of the forward elastic amplitude .",
    "the two corresponding unitarity diagrams are shown in fig.[fig : diagram_a ] , which represents the diagonal , fig.[fig : diagram_a ] a ) , and the off - diagonal contribution , fig.[fig : diagram_a ] b ) .",
    "following the lines described in full detail in @xcite , the contribution of the diagonal term to the cross section , with two active target nucleons , is given by :    @xmath47    where @xmath48 are the partonic cross sections and the nuclear wave function @xmath49 is in a mixed representation , with @xmath50 the nucleon s fractional momenta and @xmath51 the nucleon s transverse coordinates .",
    "the nuclear wave function is peaked at @xmath52 , while mpi are most important at @xmath53 .",
    "keeping into account that the scale of the nucleon s fermi momentum is small as compared to the nucleon mass , a meaningful approximation is to integrate on @xmath50 while keeping @xmath54 in the partonic distributions @xmath55 . the nuclear dependence is thus expressed through the two - body nuclear density @xmath56 , where the quantities @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the longitudinal coordinates of the two interacting nucleons :",
    "@xmath59    with the help of eq.([eq : gamma2 ] ) , in the case of two identical interactions , one thus obtains    @xmath60    where @xmath44 is the usual single scattering inclusive cross section on a nucleon and we made the positions @xmath61 .",
    "the configuration in transverse space corresponding to the dps cross section in eq.([eq : correlation ] ) is illustrated in fig.[fig : correlation ] .    ) , width=491 ]    the contribution of the interference term to the cross section is obtained in a similar way@xcite .",
    "the expression is    @xmath62    where the off diagonal parton amplitudes in the process are all included in the function @xmath63 .",
    "some detail on the construction of the function @xmath63 are presented in appendix a.    the main features of the off diagonal contribution originate from kinematics and are summarized in fig.[fig : overlap ] .    as far as the longitudinal variables are concerned , the interference term requires the nuclear wave function to be taken at different values of @xmath64 . as apparent in the lower part of fig.[fig : overlap ] , one must have in fact @xmath65 .",
    "when the differences @xmath66 are not too small , the interference term is therefore depressed with respect to the diagonal term by the nuclear form factor .",
    "one should however keep in mind that at large energies the values of @xmath67 can be rather small , still maintaining the process within the limits of perturbative dynamics , so the depression factor may not be strong .    ) .",
    "lower part of the figure : nucleon s fractional momentum flow in the off diagonal contribution to the cross section in eq.([eq : offdiag]).,width=491 ]    when looking at transverse momenta , there are two different scales in the initial state : the typical transverse momentum of the order of a few gev of the initial state partons , originated by qcd evolution , and the typical transverse momentum of the order of a hundred of mev of the bound nucleons , due to fermi motion .",
    "one might therefore expect the interference term to be further depressed by the presence of the two different scales . as discussed in appendix",
    "a , closer look at kinematics shows however that this is not the case .",
    "the difference between the overall transverse momenta of the large @xmath5 partons , generated in the two hard collisions , actually @xmath68 in fig.[fig : appinterf ] in appendix a , is in fact originated in the upper vertex @xmath69 in the figure and does not propagate to the target nucleon s momenta in lower part of the diagram , in such a way that there are not transverse momenta of the gev scale in the nucleon s lines in the interference diagram .",
    "going to the coordinates space , one obtains a rather transparent picture of the interaction , as shown in the upper part of fig.[fig : overlap ] , where the configuration in transverse space , of the amplitude in the left hand side of the cut of fig.[fig : diagram_a ] b ) , is labelled with a and the configuration of the amplitude , in the right hand side of the cut , is labelled with a*. by exchanging @xmath70 with @xmath71 , when moving form the left to the right hand side of the cut in fig.[fig : diagram_a ] b ) , one produces a change in the sign of the difference between the transverse coordinates of the two projectile partons , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , in the non perturbative vertex @xmath69 .",
    "the argument of @xmath69 is therefore @xmath74 in the amplitude a and @xmath75 in the amplitude a * , while one does not expect any dependence of @xmath76 on the sign of its argument . for what concerns the remaining transverse variables , as illustrated in the upper part of fig.[fig : overlap ] , the nuclear configurations in a and in a * are the same , the two hard interactions remain localized in the same points and the two interacting partons exchange their parent hadrons .    when the two active partons are identical , the initial partonic configuration of the dps process can be therefore produced in two independent ways , since each of the two active nucleons can generate each of the two interacting partons .",
    "the two nuclear configurations have therefore to be added coherently in the cross section .",
    "the two active target nucleons have different longitudinal fractional momenta in the two configurations and the difference is equal to the difference of the fractional momenta of the two interacting partons @xmath77 .",
    "the interference term is thus characterized by the peculiar dependence of the nuclear form factor as a function of @xmath77 .",
    "notice that the interference term is directly proportional to the off diagonal parton distributions , while the value of @xmath77 can be controlled in the process by selecting the kinematical configuration of the final state produced by the hard interaction .",
    "there is thus the interesting possibility of obtaining additional information on off diagonal parton distribution functions by using an inclusive process , actually dps in @xmath0-@xmath1 collisions , which , comparing with exclusive processes , would be able to provide larger rates of events and to access different kinematical regimes .",
    "the presence of an interference term in dps in @xmath0-@xmath1 collisions may have an interesting potential to study the generalized parton distributions . on the other hand",
    "our present purpose is to identify and work out a simple case , where the measured cross section has a straightforward relation with partonic correlations .",
    "we will thus consider a reaction channel where the interference term is strongly suppressed . to our aim",
    "a particularly interesting channel is the inclusive production of @xmath2 . in @xmath2 production ,",
    "the two initial state partons , both from the side of the projectile and from the side of the target nucleus , are a quark and a gluon since , in the kinematical regime of interest for dps , @xmath78 production is dominated by the gluonic channel .",
    "the two active target partons can not therefore be identical and the interference term is absent .",
    "a further reason of interest in @xmath2 is that dps production is presently studied experimentally in @xmath0-@xmath0 both by atlas and by cms @xcite while , after the recent experimental results and in view of the next runs planned at the lhc , there is an increasing activity in @xmath0-@xmath1 collision both experimental and theoretical@xcite .",
    "the experimental study of dps in @xmath2 production in @xmath0-@xmath3 collisions might therefore represent a feasible option for the experimental groups in a not too distant future .    in the inclusive cross section for @xmath2 production , @xmath79 ,",
    "one identifies three different contributions :    @xmath80    the first term , @xmath81 , represents the processes where @xmath2 is produced by a single parton collision while the contribution due to dps , @xmath82 , is expressed , according with eq.([eq : dpa ] ) , by the sum of two terms , which distinguish whether the dps takes place against a single , @xmath83 , or against two different target nucleons , @xmath84 .",
    "the contribution due to a single parton collisions , @xmath81 , can be evaluated according to the standard rules , keeping into account the different contributions due to the interaction with a target proton or neutron and making use of the parton distributions of the bound nucleons@xcite .",
    "this term does not provide much additional information on hadron structure and it can be considered as a known quantity .    the explicit expression of the contribution due to a double parton scattering in a collision with a single target nucleon , @xmath83 , is    @xmath85}(w)\\sigma_s^{p[p]}(jj)+(a - z)\\sigma_s^{p[n]}(w)\\sigma_s^{p[n]}(jj)\\bigr]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath86,p[n]}(w)$ ] are the single scattering cross sections for inclusive production of a @xmath63 in a collision of a proton with a bound proton or with a bound neutron , while @xmath86,p[n]}(jj)$ ] is , analogously , the single scattering cross section to produce a pair of jets .",
    "the effective cross section , @xmath20 , has been assumed to be a universal constant .",
    "@xmath1 is the atomic mass number and @xmath64 the nuclear charge .",
    "analogously to the term due to a single parton collisions , @xmath81 , also @xmath83 is therefore expressed fully explicitly in terms of known quantities and is evaluated with the standard rules of of the qcd - parton model , with the help of the parton distributions of the bound nucleons .",
    "the contribution due to a double parton scattering , in hard collisions with a single target nucleon , does not have much to add to the information on the hadron structure already available from double parton interactions in proton - proton collisions and also this term can thus be regarded as a known contributions to the cross section .",
    "all novel information on hadron structure , provided by dps in @xmath0-@xmath1 collisions , is to be found in the last term , @xmath84 , where two different nucleons participate to the double parton interaction . according with the discussion in the previous section ,",
    "the corresponding contribution to the cross section is    @xmath87    the expression in eq.([eq : wjj ] ) has been obtained by disregarding the dependence of @xmath88 on @xmath50 in eq.([eq : corr1 ] ) .",
    "the lower limit of the integration on @xmath50 in eq.([eq : corr1 ] ) is @xmath89 and one has therefore implicitly assumed that @xmath90 , which limits the validity of eq.([eq : wjj ] ) to the region of small @xmath89 .",
    "the produced spectrum is directly proportional to the overlap integral in the transverse coordinates .",
