    "resonating valence bond ( rvb ) spin liquid in two dimensions is a remarkable theoretical concept which predicts very unusual low - temperature properties of spin-1/2 systems@xcite . unlike conventional magnetically - ordered ground states with spin-1 excitations ,",
    "the rvb ground state has no long - range order of any local order parameter and possesses elementary excitations with spin 1/2@xcite .",
    "if such a system is doped with mobile holes , the fractionalization of spin excitations translates into the effect of spin - charge separation : this scenario has been widely explored in the context of high - temperature superconductivity . while a rigorous verification of the rvb liquid phase in a realistic spin system is usually very difficult due to the strongly - correlated nature of the state , many specially designed systems have confirmed rvb liquid properties .",
    "in understanding generic properties of the rvb liquid state , one may benefit from studying dimer models which are closely related to the rvb spin liquids@xcite . in the rvb construction , the wave function is represented as a sum over singlet configurations , while in the dimer models the singlets are replaced by dimers .",
    "the difference between the spin and the dimer systems is that dimer configurations are mutually orthogonal by definition , while different singlet configurations have a finite overlap@xcite .",
    "the rvb spin liquid is known to have two types of elementary excitations : spinons ( spin-1/2 excitations ) and visons ( @xmath0 vortices )  @xcite . in a dimer liquid , the spinons are prohibited by the dimer constraint ( or , equivalently , are pushed infinitely high in energy ) , while the visons are expected to be indeed the lowest excitations above the ground state .",
    "the rvb spin liquid must have topological degeneracy on domains of nontrivial topology .",
    "such a decoupling into topological sectors is straightforward in dimer liquids where it is defined in purely geometric terms@xcite .",
    "thus dimer models provide a convenient test ground for studying properties of rvb liquids related to vison excitations .",
    "the advantage of studying dimer models is that they are simpler than spin models , and are hence better understood and more accessible to analytical methods .",
    "the simplest dimer model contains the pair - wise hopping term and the pair - wise potential term @xmath1\\ , , \\label{dimer - hamiltonian}\\ ] ] where the sum is taken over the four - vertex plaquets of the lattice@xcite . on the square lattice such a model",
    "has a crystal ground state ( with the crystal of dimers breaking the translational symmetry of the lattice ) for any ratio @xmath2 , except for the phase - transition point(s ) between different crystal structures@xcite .",
    "the situation is different on the triangular lattice ( with the sum in ( [ dimer - hamiltonian ] ) taken over all rhombi consisting of two neighboring triangles ) : there the dimers are believed to form a liquid in a finite range of the parameter @xmath2@xcite .",
    "out of all possible values of @xmath2 , one is special : @xmath3 . at this ratio of parameters  further called rokhsar  kivelson ( rk ) point  the ground state of the hamiltonian ( [ dimer - hamiltonian ] ) is known exactly : it is a superposition of all possible dimer configurations with equal amplitudes [ unfortunately , the excited states are not known exactly even at the rk point ] . at @xmath4 , this state immediately yields to the staggered crystal state via a first - order phase transition .",
    "however at @xmath5 , from the available numerical evidence it follows that the rk state on the triangular lattice smoothly evolves without crystallization in a finite range of @xmath2 ( approximately until @xmath6)@xcite .",
    "it is this region of the parameter space which contains the dimer liquid .",
    "the rk point is one of the representatives of the liquid phase and is most accessible for analytic treatment , because averaging over the ground state is equivalent to the statistical averaging over all possible dimer configurations .",
    "such an averaging may be performed with the usual pfaffian technique@xcite which allows to establish the exponential decay of dimer correlations@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we employ the pfaffian technique to explicitly compute the correlation length involved in the ground - state correlation functions and in the splitting between the topological sectors on the cylinder and on the torus .",
    "we further demonstrate that the same correlation length also appears in the vison correlation function .",
    "thus our calculations prove that the rk ground state on the triangular lattice possesses topological order : on a topologically nontrivial domain , the ground states in different topological sectors are degenerate and locally indistinguishable ( in the limit of infinite system size ) .",
    "note that the exponential decay of ground - state correlation functions is consistent with the numerical finding of the gap in the excitation spectrum at the rk point ( the magnitude of the gap is numerically estimated as @xmath7)@xcite .",
    "in the pfaffian technique , the statistical averaging over the dimer configurations is performed via introducing an auxiliary real fermionic variable ( a majorana fermion ) on each lattice site@xcite .",
    "the total number of dimer configurations may then be written as the partition function of these fermions @xmath8 = { \\rm pfaff}(a_{ij } ) , \\label{pfaffian}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 and @xmath10 label the lattice sites , and the fermionic variables @xmath11 obey the conventional rules : @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 .",
    "the `` hopping amplitudes '' @xmath15 take values @xmath16 on nearest - neighbor sites and @xmath17 otherwise , and form an antisymmetric matrix : @xmath18 .",
    "the signs of @xmath15 must be adjusted so that all terms in the expansion of the exponent in ( [ pfaffian ] ) give positive weight .",
    "such terms in the expansion of the exponent are in one - to - one correspondence to the dimer coverings of the lattice .",
    "each of them has magnitude one , and should they all have equal signs , the partition function ( [ pfaffian ] ) simply counts the total number of dimer coverings .    as shown in ref .  , a necessary requirement for the proper relative sign of different dimer coverings is that the circular product @xmath19 equals @xmath20 around any elementary rhombus ( around any elementary even - length cycle , in the general case of a planar lattice ) .",
    "then it follows that @xmath21 over any _",
    "contractible _ contour of even length and , as a consequence , any two dimer configurations differing by a _ local _ rearrangement of dimers contribute to the partition function ( [ pfaffian ] ) with equal signs .",
    "different dimer configurations which can not be related by local dimer rearrangements ( i.e.  by rearrangements in a contractible domain , see fig .",
    "[ fig - cyltorus ] ) may contribute with either equal or opposite signs : this effect will be of crucial importance for our calculation .",
    "one possible choice of the amplitudes @xmath15 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - lattice ] .",
    "note that in order to obey the sign rule for @xmath15 we have to double the unit cell of the lattice .",
    "however , any physical quantity computed with those @xmath15 has the periodicity of the lattice , as the set of amplitudes @xmath15 translated by one lattice spacing may be returned to the original form by an appropriate @xmath0 gauge transformation @xmath22 with @xmath23 .",
    "now the partition function ( [ pfaffian ] ) as well as correlation functions may be conveniently computed in the fourier components .",
    "the fourier transformation of @xmath15 is a @xmath24 matrix @xmath25 . from antisymmetricity of the matrix @xmath15 it follows that its eigenvalues always come in pairs @xmath26 , with complex conjugate eigenvectors corresponding to opposite eigenvalues .",
    "a straightforward calculation shows that , for the triangular lattice , the spectrum of @xmath25 in the bulk is always gapped ( never crosses zero as a function of @xmath27 ) .",
    "explicitly , it is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 are the projections of the vector @xmath27 onto the three lattice directions ( obeying the constraint @xmath32 ) .",
    "we have also shifted the origin of the brillouin zone to bring ( [ spectrum ] ) to a symmetric form .",
    "the gap in the spectrum of @xmath15 is crucial for the exponential decay of correlation functions : as we shall see below , the correlation length is determined by the complex wave vectors @xmath27 solving the equation @xmath33@xcite . at this stage of calculation",
    ", we see the difference between the triangular and square lattices : on the square lattice , the corresponding matrix @xmath15 leads to a gapless spectrum ( and , consequently , to the power - law decay of correlations@xcite .",
    "note that although the presence or absence of the gap in the matrix @xmath15 ( governing the decay of correlation functions in the ground state ) agrees with the presence or absence of the gap for excitations , there is no direct relation between the two gaps .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath15 is not the energy spectrum of quantum dimers , but only the spectrum of auxiliary majorana fermions introduced for calculating the classical partition function of all dimer configurations .",
    "correlation functions of dimers may be expressed in terms of green s functions of majorana fermions .",
    "indeed , the probability of dimers occupying a given set of positions ( connecting pairwise points 1 and 2 , 3 and 4 ,  , @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) may be computed by excluding those points from the lattice , which is equivalent to placing majorana fermions at those points : @xmath36 \\label{multi - point}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] ( up to a sign ) . here",
    "the first average denotes the statistical averaging of dimer occupation numbers @xmath37 over all dimer configurations , while the second average is the quantum - mechanical correlation function in the theory of majorana fermions .",
    "this correlation function may further be decoupled using the wick theorem .",
    "the green s functions are obtained as @xmath38 with the integral over @xmath27 defined as averaging over the brillouin zone .",
    "the decay at large distances is found from deforming the integration domain into complex values until it reaches the singularities in @xmath39 .",
    "the singularities are the square - root branching points , which translates into the asymptotics @xmath40 .",

    "equivalently , the conditions ( [ condition-1 ] ) , ( [ condition-2 ] ) for @xmath45 may be expressed as @xmath47 where @xmath48 denotes minimizing the real part ( among its positive values ) over the components of @xmath27 parallel to @xmath42 and maximizing it over the perpendicular components .",

    "the imaginary part in @xmath53 implies the damped oscillating asymptotic behavior ( with an incommensurate wave vector ) of the green s function and of other relevant correlations ( e.g. , vison correlation function , see section  [ section - vison ] ) .    for other directions ,",

    "[ fig - xi ] , we plot the direction dependence of the inverse coherence length @xmath49 .",
    "the exponential decay of the green s functions implies an exponential decay of all dimer - dimer correlations .",
    "for example , the pair - wise dimer correlation @xmath54 decays with the correlation length @xmath55 , since it involves a product of two green s functions@xcite .",
    "if one considers dimer coverings on a domain of nontrivial topology ( e.g. , torus , cylinder , domains with holes , etc . ) , such coverings may be classified into topological classes@xcite .",
    "dimer coverings from different topological classes can not be transformed into each other by local rearrangements of dimers .",
    "the topological classes are defined by the parity of the number of dimers intersecting a given non - contractible closed contour .",

    "the hilbert spaces spanned by different topological classes are not mixed by the hamiltonian , and each topological class possesses its own ground state . at the rk point , each of these ground states has zero energy . in the general case of a topological liquid , the splitting of energies between different topological sectors must be exponentially suppressed in system size .",
    "we verify this property later near the rk point to the lowest - order perturbation theory in @xmath56 .    at the rk point , we compare correlation functions in different topological sectors .",
    "we shall see that the correlators in different sectors nearly coincide , with the splitting exponentially small in system size .",
    "we start our analysis with comparing partition functions for different topological sectors .",

    "note that a vison tunneling in the @xmath63-direction relates the topological sectors with different parity of intersections with a contour running in the @xmath63-direction .",
    "similar expressions apply for splitting in other pairs of topological sectors .",
    "the splitting of the two topological sectors on a cylinder ( or on a disc with one hole , which is topologically equivalent to a cylinder ) is derived in a way slightly different from our analysis of the torus .",
    "consider a semi - infinite cylinder ( or a plane with one hole of arbitrary size and shape ) .",
    "on such a system , we consider two different boundary conditions for majorana fermions : periodic and antiperiodic as we go around the cylinder ( around the hole , respectively ) . to those boundary conditions",
    ", there correspond the two matrices @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "below we prove that one of those matrices has a zero eigenvalue ( with the eigenvector localized near the boundary ) , and the other does not ( in the general case ) .",
    "the proof consists of four steps .",
    "first , we consider a semi - infinite cylinder of a particular geometry , with the straight boundary parallel to one of the lattice lines ( fig .",
    "[ fig - cylinders]a ) .",
    "for such a cylinder , the spectrum can be exactly computed , and the existence of the zero mode in one of the two topological sectors is easily verified ( for this particular geometry , the zero mode is strictly localized at the boundary row of sites ) .",
    "second , we note that the bulk spectrum of @xmath15 is gapped , and therefore there are only a finite number of states at small energies , and they are all localized near the boundaries . since all eigenvalues of the antisymmetric matrix come in pairs @xmath99 , the property of having a zero mode depends on whether there are even or odd number of subgap states .",
    "this parity can not be changed by any _",
    "local _ deformation of the antisymmetric matrix @xmath15 and thus the zero mode ( or its absence ) is topologically stable ( note that this argument resembles the proof of the topological stability of the zero mode in vortices in @xmath100-wave superconductors@xcite ) .",
    "third , once the theorem proven for a particular geometry of the cylinder , we make a hole in this cylinder sufficiently far from the boundary ( fig .  [ fig - cylinders]b )",
    ". then we can impose either periodic or antiperiodic boundary conditions across a line connecting the hole to the edge of the cylinder ( dashed line in the figure ) .",
    "switching the boundary conditions toggles on and off the zero mode at the cylinder edge .",
    "however , since the total parity of the subgap states ( including both states at the cylinder edge and at the hole ) is conserved , switching the boundary conditions across the dashed line also toggles the zero mode at the hole boundary .",
    "thus we extend our theorem to the case of a hole in a plane ( a sufficiently large cylinder may be regarded as a plane , from the point of view of states localized near the hole ) .",
    "fourth , we repeat the previous argument for a cylinder of arbitrary geometry with a hole in it ( fig .",
    "[ fig - cylinders]c ) , and thus establish the presence of the zero mode at the cylinder edge for one of the two boundary conditions .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "it is the zero modes which determine the splitting between the topological sectors on a cylinder .",
    "the partition functions of the majorana fermions on the cylinder with periodic and antiperiodic boundary conditions are @xmath101 ( or vise versa , depending on the choice of the gauge for @xmath15 ) , where @xmath102 and @xmath103 are the numbers of dimer coverings in the even and odd sectors .",
    "the splitting between @xmath102 and @xmath103 is given by @xmath104 and is determined by the splitting of the two zero modes ( contributing to @xmath105 ) .",
    "this splitting is in turn determined by the exponential tails of the zero modes away from the boundary : the exponential dependence of the splitting on the cylinder length has the same correlation length as the decay of the zero modes .",
    "similarly to the case of the torus , this exponential decay may be estimated in two ways . in the first approach ,",
    "the zero mode is constructed as a linear combination of green s functions localized near the boundary .",
    "explicitly , we consider the zero mode @xmath106 on the `` unfolded '' cylinder ( fig .",
    "[ fig - split]b ) and act on it with the matrix @xmath15 defined _ on the whole plane_. the resulting wavefunciton contains positions and amplitudes of the sources for the green s functions to reproduce the original zero mode @xmath106 .",
    "this representation proves that the decay of zero modes ( and hence the splitting @xmath75 ) obeys the estimate ( [ torus - splitting - one ] ) with the minimization performed over all possible vectors @xmath80 connecting the opposite edges of the cylinder ( fig .",
    "[ fig - split]b ) [ see also the analogous discussion below of the zero modes in the plane geometry ] .",
    "alternatively , we may represent the zero mode as a linear combination of plane waves quantized in the @xmath65-direction and decaying in the @xmath63 direction , which leads to eq .",
    "( [ torus - splitting - two ] ) .",
    "the relation between those two estimates is the same as for the case of the torus , with the same expression ( [ torus - splitting - three ] ) valid in the regime @xmath107 .",
    "we need to remark , however , that in the case of the cylinder , the formulas ( [ torus - splitting - one])([torus - splitting - three ] ) do not properly take into account interference of tunneling trajectories starting or ending at _ neighboring _ points of the boundary . as a consequence",
    ", the expressions ( [ torus - splitting - one])([torus - splitting - three ] ) give good ( most likely exact ) asymptotic estimates in the case of ragged boundaries , but may strongly overestimate splitting in the case of a regular edge .",
    "for example , at the straight edge shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - split]b , the zero mode is exactly localized at the boundary layer of sites , and therefore the splitting of the topological sectors on a cylinder with such an edge is _ exactly zero _ , in contrast with ( [ torus - splitting - one])([torus - splitting - three ] ) .",
    "our discussion of the cylinder may be directly extended to the plane geometry ( holes in the disc ) , with the only difference that there are no counterparts of eqs .",
    "( [ torus - splitting - two ] ) and ( [ torus - splitting - three ] ) in this case .",
    "consider specifically the simplest possible geometry : a disc with a hole in it ( fig .",
    "[ fig - plane]a ) . a reference line defining the two topological sectors",
    "is drawn to connect the two boundaries ( the external boundary and the hole boundary ) . similarly to the cylindrical geometry , the splitting of the partition functions @xmath108 and @xmath109 is given by the splitting of the zero modes at the two boundaries .",
    "our proof of the existence of zero modes may be easily extended to show that in the plane geometry , the hole encircling an _ odd _ number of sites hosts a zero mode for the _ periodic _ boundary conditions around the hole , while a hole with an _ even _ number of internal sites has a zero mode for the _ anti - periodic _ ( vison - like , see the last section of the paper ) boundary conditions . for a hole with an _ odd _ number of internal sites , the zero mode may be constructed as a linear combination of green s functions with sources located near the boundary ( the proof of this statement is similar to that in the cylindrical geometry",
    ": it follows from acting on the zero mode with the operator @xmath15 defined on the whole plane including the hole interior ) .",
    "therefore the zero mode decays with the same correlation lengths @xmath43 as the majorana green s function .",
    "the same result may also be proven for a hole with an _ even _ number of internal sites : the proof is a straightforward generalization of the theorem about the correlation length of the vison operator proven in the last section of the paper .",
    "thus , for any type of hole , the splitting between @xmath108 and @xmath109 is given by eq .",

[ fig - diagrams]b ) .    furthermore , the same type of diagrammatic rules may be derived for the case of torus , with the only difference that the the `` external line '' must in this case be closed and associated with the green s function @xmath135 , where the vector @xmath80 winds around the torus with the appropriate winding number ( as in fig .  [ fig - split]a ) .",
    "an example of such a diagram is shown in fig.[fig - diagrams]c .    in the case of cylindrical and plane geometry",
    ", the smallness of the correlation - function splitting follows from the exponential behavior of the boundary zero modes .",
    "since the zero modes rapidly decay away from the boundaries , the splitting ( [ correlation - splitting ] ) is exponentially small in the system size ( at least as small as the estimates ( [ torus - splitting - one])([torus - splitting - three ] ) or even smaller ) .",
    "the expression for the splitting may be written as @xmath136 , \\label{correlation - splitting - two}\\ ] ] where @xmath137 and @xmath138 are the optimal tunneling trajectories from the link @xmath139 to the inner and outer boundaries , and @xmath140 and @xmath141 are the corresponding correlation lengths ( fig .  [ fig - plane]a ) .",
    "if the system has a `` weak spot ''  a preferred vison tunneling trajectory , the correlations in the immediate vicinity of that trajectory are most sensitive to the choice of the topological sector .",
    "correlations away from the optimal trajectory have a weaker splitting between the sectors . on the torus",
    ", there is no `` optimal tunneling trajectory '' because of the translational symmetry , and the correlation - function splitting is given by ( [ torus - splitting - one])([torus - splitting - three ] ) , independently of the position of the involved operator .",
    "the above results allow us to estimate the energy splitting in the perturbed rokhsar  kivelson model to the first order of the perturbation theory .",
    "physically , two types of perturbations may be of interest .",
    "first , we consider the case @xmath5 in the hamiltonian ( [ dimer - hamiltonian ] ) , in which case the ground - state energy is no longer zero .",
    "the ground - state energy may be estimated to the linear order in @xmath142 as @xmath143 , where @xmath144 is the potential ( proportional to @xmath145 ) term in the hamiltonian ( [ dimer - hamiltonian ] ) , and the average is taken in the unperturbed system .",
    "@xmath144 is a four - point ( dimer - dimer ) correlation function , and from our previous discussion it follows that the splitting of @xmath146 in different topological sectors is exponentially small in the system size with the exponent estimated by ( [ torus - splitting - one])([torus - splitting - three ] ) .",
    "second , similar exponential smallness may also be derived for the energy splitting under the influence of disorder ( again , to the linear order in the disorder potential ) .",
    "note that the energy splitting is more sensitive to disorder in the vicinity of the optimal vison tunneling trajectory .    within our method , the exponentially small response of the energy splitting to the perturbation can be derived only to the lowest order of the perturbation theory .",
    "extending those results to higher orders requires information on the excited states at the rk point .",
    "this goes beyond the scope of this paper , since the excited states are not accessible by the pfaffian technique .",
    "the concept of a vison can be made more transparent by introducing a `` vison operator '' . given two elementary plaquets ( triangles ) of the lattice and a contour @xmath147 connecting them , we can define the product of two vison operators @xmath148 as @xmath149 where @xmath150 is the number of dimers intersecting the contour @xmath147 , and the last product is taken over all links @xmath139 intersecting @xmath147 ( fig .",
    "[ fig - visons ] )  @xcite .",
    "it can be easily seen that deforming the contour @xmath147 while keeping the end points fixed may only change the sign of this operator ( depending on whether between the old and the new contour lies odd or even number of sites ) .",
    "this allows us to define a single vison operator ( up to a sign ; more precisely , the vison operator is defined on the frustrated dual lattice , with reversing its sign when moved around one site of the original lattice ) . for a single vison operator ,",
    "the contour @xmath147 is drawn either to infinity ( for an infinite system ) or to the boundary . in a finite system without boundaries ( e.g.  torus )",
    ", vison operators may appear only in pairs .    in the majorana fermion technique ( [ pfaffian ] ) , the vison operator is equivalent to changing the boundary conditions ( from periodic to anti - periodic and vice versa , i.e. , placing a @xmath0 twist ) across the contour @xmath147 . thus switching topological sectors on a cylinder as described above is equivalent to placing a pair of visons in the cylinder openings . on a torus , switching topological sectors is achieved by creating a vison - vison pair , subsequently moving one of the two visons around the torus and annihilating it back with the other vison .    applying a vison operator",
    "as defined above to the ground state does not produce an eigenstate of the hamiltonian ( [ dimer - hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "however , preliminary studies show that the state thus obtained is close to the actual low - lying excitations@xcite . a localized excitation ( a wavepacket )",
    "may be classified as either vison - like or non - vison - like depending on whether it originates a cut @xmath147 across which the boundary conditions are changed . based on the available numerical studies",
    "@xcite , we believe that the lowest excitations belong to the vison - like sector ; this also conforms to the existing field - theoretical description of the rvb liquid @xcite ( studies of related models with an exact construction of the vison excitations appeared recently in refs .  ) .",
    "we expect that the leading exponential asymptotics of long - distance correlators of vison - like operators is dominated by the topological effect of changing the boundary conditions across the cut @xmath147 , and only finite prefactors depend on the details of the involved operators .",
    "in other words , the correlation length of vison - like operators is universal and may be determined , for example , from the pairwise correlation function @xmath151 as defined in ( [ vison - vison ] ) .",
    "we can prove that the vison correlation length equals that for majorana fermions .",
    "for the same reason as for a hole in the plane ( see discussion above ) , a vison on an infinite plane produces a zero mode of the matrix @xmath15 .",
    "thus the vison correlation length is determined by the decay of this zero mode at large distances .",
    "the matrix @xmath15 in the presence of the vison may be written as @xmath152 , where @xmath153 is the matrix of hopping amplitudes without the vison and @xmath154 is localized at the cut drawn from the vison .",
    "note that the zero mode does not depend on the trajectory of the cut ( up to a gauge transformation ) .",
    "the equation on the zero mode @xmath155 may be rewritten as @xmath156^{-1 } \\delta a \\psi_0 $ ] . from this expression",
    ", it follows that the exponential decay of @xmath106 away from the vison has the asymptotics of @xmath157^{-1}$ ] which is exactly the green s functions of majorana fermions ( [ majorana - green ] ) .",
    "this finishes the proof .",
    "note that this result is consistent with our findings for the splitting between topological sectors and with their interpretation in terms of vison tunneling amplitudes .",
    "furthermore , our result about the decay of the zero mode at the point - like vison is a particular case of a more general statement about the zero modes at even - size holes ( see our discussion in section  [ section - degeneracy ] ) : the point - like vison may be considered as a hole of size zero ; the proof may be extended in a straightforward way to cover the general case of an even - size hole .    to illustrate our result on the equality between the correlation lengths for visons and for majorana fermions ,",
    "we have calculated numerically the vison - vison correlation function in the @xmath50 direction .",
    "the calculation was performed by the variational monte carlo method : the vison correlation function was computed as the average over a suitable random walk in the space of all dimer configurations@xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig - numerics ] shows the numerical results of the calculation ( for distances up to 9 lattice spacings , on the lattice of 50@xmath15850 torus ) , together with the analytic expression @xmath159 .",
    "we have no analytic expression for the phase of the oscillating part of the correlation function ( arising from the imaginary part of @xmath53 ) and therefore compare only the overall magnitude of the correlation function .",
    "the agreement in the magnitude and the change of sign in the vison correlator ( a signature of the oscillatory behavior ) are consistent with our analytical prediction of the correlation length ( [ xi - a ] ) .    to summarize",
    ", we have shown that in the dimer model ( [ dimer - hamiltonian ] ) on the triangular lattice , at the rk point @xmath160 , both dimer and vison correlations decay exponentially with the distance .",
    "dimer correlations may be expressed as finite products of the green s functions of auxiliary majorana fermions for which the correlation length is computed explicitly .",
    "we have further shown that the vison correlation length coincides with that of majorana fermions .",
    "the same correlation length also governs the splitting between correlation functions in different topological sectors ( [ torus - splitting - one])([torus - splitting - three ] ) .",
    "thus the rokhsar ",
    "kivelson dimer model provides an example of the system where the topological ground - state properties of the rvb liquid may be explicitly verified .",
