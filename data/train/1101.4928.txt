    "around 20% of optically selected quasars exhibit blueshifted , broad absorption lines ( bals ) ( e.g. knigge et al .",
    "2008 ) , which indicate massive outflows from the quasar central engine that may have important consequences ( vernaleo & reynolds 2006 , hopkins et al . 2006 , scannapieco & oh 2004 ) .",
    "outflows can enrich the quasar host galaxy ism , contribute to a variety of feedback effects such as regulating host galaxy star formation rates ( hopkins & elvis 2010 ) , and limit quasar lifetimes by removing fuel from the nuclear regions ( silk & rees 1998 , king 2003 ) . despite their important implications , the nature of balqsos is still not fully understood .",
    "balqsos are a highly polarized subclass of quasars , with 8 of 40 showing optical broadband polarization of 2% or greater compared to 2 of 115 non - balqsos ( hines & schmidt 1997 ) .",
    "there have been a few spectropolarimetry surveys done in the last several years , for example ogle et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and schmidt , hines , and smith ( 1997 ) , and dipompeo et al .",
    "spectropolarimetry of small samples and individual objects has been published as well , covering a wide range of balqso types ( goodrich & miller 1995 , cohen et al .",
    "1995 , glenn et al .",
    "1994 ) . in general ,",
    "these results show common trends among polarized balqso properties .",
    "continuum polarization can exceed 10% and the polarization generally increases at shorter wavelengths .",
    "polarization levels in absorption lines tend to be equal to or greater than that of the continuum and emission lines are generally similarly or less polarized than the continuum , though these are general trends and certainly not true of all balqsos .",
    "a popular explanation for balqsos has involved a simple orientation scheme . in this model",
    "all quasars have outflows , but only a fraction ( about 20% ) are seen along a line of sight that intersects the outflow ; these sources show bals .",
    "different balqso subtypes , here described as hibals ( those showing absorption from high - ionization species such as @xmath11549 ) , lobals ( those with additional absorption from low - ionization species such as @xmath12799 ) , and felobals ( lobals showing absorption from @xmath12380 , @xmath12600 , @xmath12750 ) are fit into this orientation paradigm as well .",
    "lobals and felobals would be those balqsos seen at the largest inclinations .",
    "this description of balqsos has relied heavily on analogies with the unification of seyfert galaxies via orientation ( antonucci 1993 ) .",
    "the spectropolarimetric results have also often been taken to support the simple orientation model ( e.g. goodrich & miller 1995 , hines & wills 1995 , cohen et al . 1995 ) . in recent years",
    "there has been growing evidence that the orientation explanation is at least incomplete , especially in its simplest forms .",
    "balqsos with polar outflows ( zhou et al .",
    "2006 , ghosh & punsly 2007 ) and the compactness of balqsos in radio maps ( montenegro - montes et al .",
    "2008 , becker et al .",
    "2000 ) suggest that balqsos are not simply normal quasars seen edge - on .",
    "a model based on evolution is another possibility , for example gregg et al .",
    "( 2002 , 2006 ) suggest that the bal phase is an early phase in the lifetime of all quasars , which would last for approximately 20% of their lifetime .",
    "determining which of these models is correct , or if some combination of both is needed , is an important problem concerning our understanding of quasars . to this end",
    "we have begun work on a project with a large sample of balqsos to investigate with spectropolarimetry , radio data , and optical data .",
    "this paper is the second of several from the project ( the first being dipompeo et al .",
    "2010 ) , and our aim here is to present the spectropolarimetry from the european southern observatory very large telescope ( eso vlt ) sample , and report the most basic results .",
    "we adopt the cosmology of spergel et al .",
    "( 2007 ) for all calculated properties , with @xmath2 km / s / mpc , @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "this set of objects was not selected to build a uniform sample across any particular range of properties . instead , many of these sources were chosen due to their extreme or unusual nature .",
    "studying the most unusual / extreme objects in a class is often exceptionally useful for shedding light on the physics that drives the extreme properties , and in turn those that are less extreme .",
    "many sources were simply chosen because they were bright enough to allow quick on - site reductions to identify polarized sources that would be worth giving a deeper look .",
    "it should be kept in mind that this is a heterogenous sample , especially when looking at correlations .",
    "the sample is made up of 19 balqsos and 4 sources that are uncertainly classified as balqsos , mostly found in the catalog of sowinski et al .",
    "seven are from the list of unusual sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) balqsos in hall et al .",

    "the first of these two , fbqs j0105 - 0033 and fbqs j2204 + 0031 , show no obvious absorption ( the redshifts are too low for to be seen in the spectrum ) , but may show emission which correlates with the presence of bals ( boroson & meyers 1992 ) .",
    "both sources are highly reddened as well .",
    "becker et al . ( 2001 ) has classified these objects as bl lacartae ( bl lac ) sources , though they do note that the classification is uncertain .",
    "fbqs j0127 + 0114 is similar to the previous two objects ( and speculated to be a bal for the same reasons ) , but it does also show small absorption from @xmath13889 .",
    "sdss j0338 + 0056 is also highly reddened , which makes determining the continuum difficult to do .",

    "we measure @xmath27 in sdss j0338 + 0056 , while the maximum isp along its line of sight is 0.96% .",
    "the two fbqs sources do not show any significant rise in polarization throughout the spectrum , though the position angle is quite variable .",
    "the sdss source does have a few points where the polarization rises , in fact to over 2% in the emission line , though it is not extremely convincing .",
    "the fact that these sources seem intrinsically unpolarized ( or only very weakly polarized ) may also be further evidence that they are not actual balqsos . interestingly ,",
    "if they are in fact balqsos , they are all highly reddened yet do not show significant polarization ; generally the most reddened sources in this class tend to be the most polarized .",
    "in the following analysis , in order to ensure that we are truly only seeing the properties of balqsos , we do not include the four sources discussed in  2 for which the classification as balqsos is uncertain .",
    "we also remind the reader that this is not a homogeneous sample of balqsos .",

    "we see for certain that the absorption lines do tend to be more polarized in the line , with a mean @xmath30 of 1.60 , and less certainly in the absorption with a mean @xmath30 of 1.00 .",
    "we do note that given the width of these distributions and the number of sources , that many of these averages are not inconsistent with 1 .",
    "we have done a simple correlation test on the polarization properties using the spearman @xmath31 rank correlation coefficient between property pairs that have at least 9 data points .",
    "the results are shown in table  [ corrtbl ] .",
    "given the small number of objects in the sample , we use a loose criterion of @xmath32 to indicate at least marginally significant correlations .",
    "values of @xmath33 satisfying this cutoff are shown in bold type in the table ; while all property pairs are shown in the table for completeness , only those involving at least 9 sources were analyzed and will be considered further .",
    "any others require more data to verify .",
    "two correlations did satisfy our criteria : an anti - correlation between the continuum polarization and balqso luminosity ( or a positive correlation with absolute @xmath6 magnitude , figure  [ pmagcorr ] ) and an anti - correlation between continuum polarization and emission polarization ( figure  [ ppecivcorr ] ) .",
    "the spectropolarimetric properties of this sample are consistent with previous findings .",
    "if we define high broadband polarization as larger than 2% , we find that 6 out of 19 ( @xmath34 ) balqsos in this sample are highly polarized ( errors are 1@xmath18 values from a binomial distribution ) .",
    "this is higher than ( but consistent with ) the percentage in the radio - selected sample of dipompeo et al .",
    "( 2010 ) of @xmath35 , and the 8 of 40 ( @xmath36 ) reported by hines & schmidt ( 1997 ) .",
    "we also note that hines & schmidt ( 1997 ) do not include objects for which @xmath37 , and all of our sources satisfy that inequality .",
    "our data support the conclusion that between a quarter and one third of balqsos are highly polarized . the general increase in polarization in absorption troughs and decrease in polarization in emission lines",
    "has also been consistently noted in balqso samples .",
    "there is one object however , qso 2046 - 3433 that has high polarization in emission lines compared to the continuum .",
    "this is most likely interpreted as a geometry in which the scattering region is blocked ( possibly by lumps on the inner edge of a dusty torus ) from the continuum source , while the broad - line region has a more clean line of sight to the scattering region .",
    "while this does not necessarily lend support to any one balqso model , it seems unlikely that this would be seen in face - on balqsos .",
    "this however only appears to occur in a very small number of sources .",
    "we have also compared the continuum polarizations for the different balqso types , shown in figure  [ polbytypefig ] .",
    "it is not as clear as it has been in other samples that the lobals and felobals tend to be the most highly polarized balqsos .",
    "this could be an indication that orientation is not the only factor in determining whether a quasar shows bals or not , but we again note that the numbers are small and we will be able to analyze this more clearly when more objects are considered .    of the correlations found ,",
    "one has been previously identified- that between continuum polarization and absolute @xmath6 magnitude was also seen in dipompeo et al .",
    "there are two extreme points in this analysis , a hibal with very high polarization ( almost 8% ) and an felobal with low luminosity ( @xmath38 ) , and we have checked the correlation not including these points to examine its robustness to outliers . without the high polarization hibal , @xmath39 , and without the low luminosity felobal @xmath40 , so the correlation remains significant . if we exclude both extreme points , however , the value of @xmath33 becomes 0.07 and is no longer considered significant by our criteria . filling in the parameter space between the main group and the extreme points is necessary to determine if the correlation is truly significant .",
    "we do not see the correlation between the and ] emission - line polarizations , which was seen in both lamy & hutsemekers ( 2004 ) and dipompeo et al .",
    "we defer analysis of these correlations and their implications to a later paper when we will be combining these data with that from dipompeo et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , as well as new vlt observations of radio - selected balqsos",
    ".    radio information in conjunction with polarization measurements can be useful in testing theories of balqsos ( e.g. dipompeo et al . 2010 ) .",
    "this works especially well for extended radio sources , which allows a comparison between the position angle of the radio jets ( and thus the orientation of the balqso ) and the polarization position angle . in the one",
    "extended source in this sample , sdss j0043 - 0015 , the radio position angle is 51@xmath16 , while the polarization position angle is about 128@xmath16 ( both in white - light and in the continuum ) the radio and polarization position angles are roughly perpendicular , which we would expect if the source is seen from an edge - on perspective .",
    "however , the fact that only 1 of the 8 radio sources show extended structure could be support for evolutionary balqso models .    with only 6 radio sources in this data set , 3",
    "of which are not certainly balqsos , statistical tests looking for correlations between radio and polarization properties would not be useful . in the future we will however be combining these with the sample of dipompeo et al .",
