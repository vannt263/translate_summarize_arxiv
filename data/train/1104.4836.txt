    "the tev @xmath0ray image shows that it consists of three spatial components ( i.e. regions a , b and c in fig .  1 of aharonian et al .",
    "2008 ) . owing to the lack of spectral variability and the insignificant dip among these regions in the existing data ,",
    "it was argued that they are originated from a single object ( aharonian et al .",
    "this inference suggests that hess  j1745 - 303  as one of the largest unidentified tev sources which has an angular size of @xmath8 .",

    "2008 ) , the line emission is suggested to be the reflected x - rays originated from the previous activity in the galactic center ( bamba et al .",

    "2008 ) , including the  mouse \" pulsar ( i.e. psr  j1747 - 2958 ) , one can not rule out these objects as the source of energetic particles simply based on the tev results ( aharonian et al . 2008 ) . furthermore",
    ", with the current information , it is not possible to discriminate hadronic model and leptonic model ( see fig .  5 & 6 in bamba et al . 2009 ) .",
    "in order to do so , investigations in lower energy regime are required .",
    "it is interesting to note that hess  j1745 - 303  is positionally coincident with an unidentified egret source 3eg  j1744 - 3011  ( hartman et al .",
    "different from hess  j1745 - 303 , 3eg  j1744 - 3011  was suggested to demonstrate long - term variability ( torres et al . 2001 ) .",

    "however , among 1451 objects detected by lat during the first 11 months , we do not identify any source corresponding to hess  j1745 - 303  / 3eg  j1744 - 3011",
    "( abdo et al .",
    "2010 ) . very recently , in an analysis of the @xmath0rays from the galactic center with first 25 months lat data , a new serendipitous source was found to coincide spatially with hess  j1745 - 303  / 3eg  j1744 - 3011  ( chernyakova et al . 2011 ) . in this paper",
    ", we report a detailed analysis of this source with lat observation in the first @xmath1  months .",
    "in this analysis , we used the data obtained by lat between 2008 august 4 and 2010 december 23 .",
    "the _ fermi _ science tools v9r18p6 package is used to reduce and analyze the data in the vicinity of hess  j1745 - 303 . only the events that are classified as class  3 or class  4 are adopted .",
    "the post - launch instrument response functions  p6_v3_diffuse \" were used throughout this investigation .    with the aid of the task _ gtlike _",
    ", we performed unbinned maximum - likelihood analysis for a circular region - of - interest ( roi ) with a @xmath11 diameter centered on the nominal position of hess  j1745 - 303   ( i.e. ra=@xmath12@xmath13@xmath14 dec=@xmath15@xmath16@xmath17 ( j2000 ) ) .",
    "the size of roi have been chosen to avoid the surrounding bright sources so as to reduce the systematic uncertainties due to the inaccurate background subtraction in this complex region .",
    "for subtracting the background contribution , we included the galactic diffuse model ( gll_iem_v02.fit ) and the isotropic background ( isotropic_iem_v02.txt ) , as well as 41 sources in the first _ fermi_/lat catalog ( 1fgl ; abdo et al .",
    "2010 ) within @xmath11 from the aforementioned center .    to begin with",
    ", we compared the spectral properties inferred by lat and egret . for a consistent comparison with hartman et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , we used events with energies @xmath18  mev for our initial analysis .",
    "we assumed a power - law ( pl ) spectrum for hess  j1745 - 303  as well as all 1fgl sources in our consideration .",
    "all the sources are assumed to be point sources throughout this investigation .",
    "the best - fit model yields a photon index of @xmath19 . ] and a test - statistic ( ts ) value of 499 which corresponds to a significance of @xmath20 .",
    "this is consistent with the significance reported in the preliminary analysis by chernyakova et al .",
    "the photon index is found to be consistent with 3eg  j1744 - 3011   ( i.e. @xmath21 ) . to further compare with the egret results , we compute the integrated photon flux in @xmath22  gev which is found to be @xmath23  @xmath24  s@xmath25 .",
    "this is @xmath26 times smaller than that of 3eg  j1744 - 3011  ( i.e. @xmath27  @xmath24  s@xmath25 ) .",
    "the discrepancy can be due to the improved spatial resolution of lat , and hence the estimation of background contribution from the nearby sources is more accurate than egret .",
    "considering the background , as hess  j1745 - 303  is located close to the galactic center where the diffuse @xmath0ray emission is very intense , the contamination can possibly be large at lower energies .",
    "also , the point spread function ( psf ) of lat is narrower at higher energies . while the @xmath28 containment radius at 100  mev is @xmath29 , it is only @xmath30 at 1  gev .",
    "therefore , the contamination due to the psf wings of the nearby sources can also be minimized by limiting the analysis at higher energies . in order to minimize the systematic uncertainty in the background modeling so as to obtain robust results ,",
    "we restricted the subsequent analysis in @xmath4  gev . in this adopted band , the best - fit pl model results in a ts value of 332 which corresponds to a detection significance to be @xmath2 . to examine the robustness of the detection , we have also considered the systematic uncertainty of the galactic diffuse emission background . following abdo et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , we repeat the analysis by varying the slope and the normalization of the galactic diffuse model in @xmath31 and @xmath32 respectively . within the uncertainty of the background model ,",
    "the detection significance remains over @xmath33 .",
    "this best - fit pl model yields a photon index of @xmath34 and an energy flux of @xmath35  ergs  @xmath24  s@xmath25 in @xmath4  gev . the best - fit pl model and the @xmath0ray spectrum as seen by _",
    "fermi _ lat is shown in figure  [ spec ] .",
    "besides a simple pl model , we have also examined if a broken power - law ( bkpl ) or an exponential cutoff power - law ( ple ) can describe the spectrum better .",
    "the fittings with bkpl and ple results in the ts values of 335 and 333 respectively . based on the likelihood ratio test ,",
    "the additional spectral parameters in bkpl / ple are not strongly required which suggests that a single pl is statistically sufficient to describe the data .",
    "for the ple model , the best - fit photon index and cut - off energy are @xmath36 and @xmath37  gev respectively . on the other hand , for the bkpl , the initial fitting resulted in a break energy and the photon indicies of @xmath38  gev , @xmath39 and @xmath40 respectively . however , different from the best - fit solutions inferred from pl and ple models , we found that the solution inferred from the bkpl fit is unstable subjecting to the perturbations in the parameter space .",
    "in view of the problem of the convergence , we will not further consider bkpl model in all subsequent analysis .",
    "although the extra parameter , @xmath41 , in the ple model is not statistically required , one is not able to completely rule out it in view of its capability in depicting the observed data . as a ple model typically describes the @xmath0ray spectrum of a pulsar ( abdo et al . 2010b , 2011 ) , we speculate if there is any hidden pulsar in hess  j1745 - 303 . to test this hypothesis ,",
    "we have performed a blind search for coherent pulsation .",
    "the arrival times of each photon were barycentric corrected with the nominal position of hess  j1745 - 303  adopted . to minimize the impact due to the ignorance of the spin - down rate",
    ", we have divided the full time span of the adopted data into 5 segments and run the fourier analysis in each segment independently with the aid of the tool _",
    "gtpspec_. from each computed power spectrum , we picked out 10 peaks and investigated if there is any correlation among different segments .",
    "however , we did not identify any promising periodicity candidate in this data .",
    "hence , we conclude that there is no evidence for a hidden pulsar in hess  j1745 - 303 .    as 3eg  j1744 - 3011  was reported to be a variable ( torres et al .",
    "2001 ) , we also examine the variability with lat data .",
    "first , we extracted the light curve obtained from the data within @xmath42 from the nominal position of hess  j1745 - 303  with a binning factor of 10 days in the energy range of @xmath4  gev . by fitting a horizontal line to the light curve",
    ", we obtain a reduced chi - square of @xmath43 for 87 degrees of freedom .",
    "hence , there is no strong evidence for any variability or flaring .    for a further investigation of the possible spectral and flux variability",
    ", we divided the whole data into five segments of equal time span and performed an unbinned likelihood analysis on each segment .",
    "the results are summarized in table  [ spec_var ] .",

    "( 2008 ) argued that the gev counterpart is unlikely to be associated with hess  j1745 - 303 .",
    "however , we do not find any evidence for the spectral / flux variability from the lat data .",
    "the discrepancy of the lat result and that inferred from egret is most likely due to the differences between their instrumental performance . with the improved angular resolution and sensitivity of lat ,",
    "many previously unknown sources in the proximity of hess  j1745 - 303  are now detected .",
    "as several sources within @xmath70 are found to be variable , including 1fgl  j1747.2 - 2958 which is the @xmath0ray counterpart of psr  j1747 - 2958  ( abdo et al .",
    "2010 ) , the source confusion in the egret data can possibly lead to the apparent variability .",
    "it is interesting to compare the spectral properties inferred in the gev regime with those obtained by h.e.s.s ..",
    "first , the photon index inferred from the lat data ( i.e. @xmath34 ) is similar to that inferred in tev ( cf . tab .  2 of aharonian et al .",
    "furthermore , the extrapolated photon flux in @xmath7  tev with the best - fit pl model is found to be @xmath71  @xmath24  s@xmath25 which is consistent with any individual spatial component observed by h.e.s.s . within @xmath62 uncertainties ( cf . tab .  2 of aharonian et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "since the tev spectral data of region a is avaliable ( cf . fig .  2 of aharonian et al .",
    "2008 ) , we further compare this particular region with the gev spectrum by constructing a spectral energy distribution ( sed ) which is display in figure  [ sed ] .",
    "both data can be simultaneously fitted with a single pl of @xmath72 .",
    "this clearly demonstrates that the tev spectrum of this spatial component can be smoothly connected to the gev spectrum .    for regions",
    "b and c , despite that no tev spectral data is currently available , we note that their spectral shapes reported by aharonian et al .",
    "( 2008 ) are similar to that of region a. within the statistical uncertainties of the spectral properties inferred in both gev and tev regimes , the tev spectra of these regions can also be possibly connected to that of gev .",
    "further investigation by h.e.s.s .",
    "is strongly encouraged , particularly for region c as most of the @xmath0ray emission in @xmath5  gev apparently coincides with this spatial component .    as both pl and ple model can describe the gev spectrum equally well",
    ", we can not discriminate these competing models based on the current data .",
    "in view of the exponential cut - off , the spectral connection between the gev and tev regimes can not be established with the ple model .",
    "however , we would like to point out that the best - fit cut - off energy , @xmath37  gev , falls in the highest energy bin of the lat spectrum ( cf .",
    "[ spec ] and fig .",
    "[ sed ] ) .",
    "owing to the small photon statistics in the hard band , the statistical uncertainty of the highest energy bin is rather large . in view of this , it remains unclear whether the inferred cut - off is genuine as this particular data point is sensitive to the systematic uncertainty of the background .",
    "analysis of the lat data in higher energies ( e.g. @xmath73  gev ) with sufficient photon statistic in the future can help to discriminate these two models .",
    "the detection of @xmath0rays provides a strong evidence for the particle acceleration .",
    "it should be noted that there are two snrs and two pulsars around hess  j1745 - 303  which can be the potential high energy particle injector ( cf .",
    "fig .  1 of aharonian et al .",
    "based on the small distances of g359.0 - 0.9  and psr  b1742 - 30 , bamba et al .",
    "( 2009 ) argued that these two sources are foreground objects which are unrelated to hess  j1745 - 303 . with the gev counterpart revealed by lat",
    ", we can now safely rule out the possibility that psr  b1742 - 30  is the major contributor as its spin - down flux , @xmath74  erg  @xmath24  s@xmath25 , is lower than the energy flux observed in the gev regime ( cf .",
    "manchester et al .",
    "on the other hand , for psr  j1747 - 2958 , the sum of @xmath0ray flux of 1fgl  j1747.2 - 2958 and hess  j1745 - 303  observed by lat only consumes @xmath75 of its spin - down flux ( @xmath76  erg  @xmath24  s@xmath25 ) .",
    "therefore , it is energetically possible to be the source for the high energy particles .",
    "nevertheless , with its eastward proper - motion ( hales et al . 2009 ) , its backward extrapolated position by its spin - down age is found to have an offset of @xmath77 and @xmath30 from the best - fit positions inferred in @xmath4  gev and @xmath5  gev respectively .",
    "if the feature found by h.e.s.s . and lat is indeed a pwn , then it is one of the most peculiar system because of its large positional offset with respect to the pulsar position .",
    "while the contribution of psr  j1747 - 2958  is uncertain , the interaction between the shock from g359.1 - 0.5  and a molecular cloud in its neighbourhood is considered to be a more viable means to produce the observed @xmath0rays . for both hadronic and leptonic scenarios , bamba et al .",
    "( 2009 ) have modeled the broadband spectrum of the region a of hess  j1745 - 303 .",
    "however , comparing fig .",
    "[ spec ] in this paper and fig .  5 & 6 in bamba et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , the gev flux predicted in all the scenarios considered in their work are at least an order of magnitude lower than that observed by lat . revised theoretical investigation with constraints provided by lat is therefore required .",
    "moreover , while the other known systems of snrs interacting with molecular clouds have their remnant shells found in other wavelengths coincided with the @xmath0ray emission ( e.g. castro & slane 2010 ; abdo et al .",
    "2010c ) , there is no such evidence for hess  j1745 - 303 .",
    "we should point out that all the previous multiwavelength campaign were targeted only at the bright component of hess  j1745 - 303 , namely the region a. since the lat observation suggested that the gev emission can possibly be originated from the regions c / b , observational investigations aim at these regions are encouraged for a further understanding of this mysterious object .",
    "based on the above discussion , we have to admit that the energy injection source of hess  j1745 - 303  remains unclear .",
    "it is instructive to compare it with other nearby high energy sources .",
    "aharonian et al . (",
    "2006b ) have reported observations of an extended region of very high energy ( vhe , @xmath18  gev ) @xmath78-ray emission correlated spatially with a complex of giant molecular clouds in the central 200  pc of the milky way .",
    "it appears that tev emissions from the molecular clouds in the vicinity of the galactic center are quite common phenomena .",
    "in addition , similar to the case of hess  j1745 - 303 , 6.4 kev lines have been commonly detected from many molecular clouds near the galactic center , e.g. sgr  b2 ( koyama et al . 1996 ; murakami et al . 2000 ) , sgr  c ( murakami et al . 2001 ) and others ( bamba et al .",
    "2002 ; predehl et al .",
    "2003 ; nobukawa et al . 2008 ; nakajima et al .",
    "2009 ; koyama et al .",
    "it has been speculated that these neutral iron lines arise from the reflection by the dense molecular clouds which are irradiated by the nearby x - ray sources ( e.g. koyama et al .",
    "2007 ; inui et al .",
    "on the other hand , dogiel et al . (",
    "2009 ) argued that these 6.4  kev lines from the molecular clouds are excited by a background intensity of subrelativistic protons coming from the escaped part of a past captured star by the galactic supermassive black hole sgr  a*. the periodic stellar capture events may explain the recent observed _ fermi _ bubble ( cheng et al .",
    "this subrelativistic proton wind can also form shock by hitting the clouds and produce relativistic protons .",
    "it is shown that the decay of neutral pions produced by hadronic collisions between the accelerated relativistic protons in the clouds can emit a power - law @xmath0ray spectrum from 30 mev to 10 tev without any spectral break ( cheng et al .",
    "2011b in preparation ) .",
    "if this is true , then the high energy emission from various molecular clouds in the vicinity of the galactic center are correlated to the past activities of the galactic center and their intensity might be correlated with the propagation history of the injection of these subrelativistic protons escaped from the capture past events .",
