    "the determination of the astrophysical @xmath6-factor of the reaction @xmath0b(p,@xmath1)@xmath13be at thermonuclear energies is important in several respects . in the search for advanced fusion reaction fuels the reaction @xmath3b + p @xmath14 @xmath15be + @xmath1 @xmath14 3@xmath1 is discussed as a promising candidate for a relatively clean fusion fuel  @xcite .",
    "however , natural boron contains 19.7% @xmath0b which produces @xmath13be contaminations via the @xmath0b(p,@xmath1)@xmath13be reaction .",
    "therefore , for a full understanding of the feasibility of boron as a fusion fuel one has to consider the rate for the latter reaction as well  @xcite .    the importance of the @xmath0b(p,@xmath1)@xmath13be reaction in astrophysical scenarios results from the fact that it is the dominant process for the destruction of @xmath0b .",
    "it was also claimed that it could be usefully incorporated in explaining the abundances of boron isotopes including the present theory of spallative generation of @xmath16 elements  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in theoretical investigations of primordial abundances of elements , its rate has to be incorporated in the reaction networks employed in nucleosynthesis calculations for inhomogeneous big bang scenarios  @xcite .",
    "experimental results for the @xmath0b(p,@xmath1)@xmath13be reaction at energies below 1 mev are scarce .",
    "there have been measurements of the @xmath0b(p,@xmath17)@xmath13be cross sections with sometimes inconsistent results in the energy ranges 220 kev @xmath18 480 kev  @xcite , 60 kev @xmath18 180 kev  @xcite , 70 kev @xmath18 205 kev  @xcite , and , more recently , 120 kev @xmath18 480 kev  @xcite",
    ". however , these measurements do not extend very far into the region dominated by the @xmath19=5/2@xmath20 resonance ( @xmath21 mev in @xmath3c  @xcite ) which is of great importance for astrophysics . in our calculations we therefore focused on the description of the resonance and the reproduction of most recent data  @xcite at very low energies .",
    "the only available data measuring the @xmath22 contribution to the @xmath6-factor are given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the reaction @xmath3b(p,@xmath1)@xmath15be has been measured below 1 mev @xcite , @xcite , and most recently @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the effect of electron screening  @xcite increases the very low energy cross sections considerably and thus has a major impact on a reaction s significance as a terrestrial fusion fuel .",
    "it is commonly accepted that nuclear reactions for energies above about 20 mev mainly proceed via a direct mechanism . for intermediate energies ,",
    "however , distinct levels of the compound system are populated , resulting in many cases in pronounced resonances in the excitation functions . for astrophysically relevant energies , typically sub - coulomb energies of a few kev or tens of kev ,",
    "compound mechanisms are often very important",
    ". however , direct transitions can also be important at stellar energies .",
    "for example , the reactions of the pp - chains in the sun are known to be mainly dominated by such direct mechanisms  @xcite .",
    "recent theoretical investigations of a number of sub - coulomb transfer reactions  @xcite have also shown that they can be described by a direct reaction potential model like the distorted wave born approximation ( dwba ) .",
    "although `` direct reaction '' is often used synonymously with `` non - resonant '' , the same potentials that describe the direct mechanism can give rise to resonances corresponding to energy levels in the projectile - target system .",
    "such potential resonances are very broad at energies above the coulomb barrier and do not alter cross sections significantly within several kev ( or even a few mev ) . however ,",
    "due to the coulomb barrier they become small at low energies , with typical widths of a few kev .",
    "a dwba description of a resonance structure at thermonuclear energies of a three - nucleon transfer reaction is given in  @xcite .",
    "in the sub - coulomb energy range of ( p,@xmath1 ) reactions the dwba method has previously only been used to analyze non - resonant parts of the excitation functions  @xcite .",
    "we want to emphasize , though , that it is possible to reproduce resonance features in a dwba calculation .    for the results in this paper we utilized the zero - range dwba code tetra  @xcite .",
    "the differential cross section for the transfer reaction @xmath23 with @xmath24 , @xmath25 ( stripping ) using light projectiles and ejectiles ( for @xmath26 and @xmath27 or @xmath28 ) is given in zero - range dwba by  @xcite @xmath29 with the usual zero - range normalization constant @xmath30  @xcite .",
    "the spectroscopic factors @xmath31 relevant for our calculations were taken from  @xcite .",
    "important for the success of our potential model is the fact that the input data for the optical potentials can be taken from realistic models , i.e. from semimicroscopic or microscopic formalisms such as the folding - potential model , the resonating group method ( rgm ) , or the generator coordinate method ( gcm ) . in this respect",
    "the potential model combines the first - principle approach of a microscopic theory with the flexibility of a phenomenological method .    in this work we used the method of the folding potential  @xcite to obtain the optical potentials in the entrance and exit channel as well as the potential for the bound state .",
    "the folding potential is given by  @xcite @xmath32 in this expression * r * is the separation of the centers of mass of the two nuclei in the channel , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the respective nucleon densities and @xmath35 is the adjustable strength factor .",
    "the factor @xmath35 differs slightly from the value of 1 because it accounts for the effects of antisymmetrization and the pauli principle .",
    "the effective nn interaction @xmath36 for the folding procedure was of the ddm3y type  @xcite and the density distributions were taken from ref .",
    "@xcite unless noted otherwise . for the bound state potentials @xmath35 is fixed , since the known binding energy of the transferred particle @xmath37 , a triton , in @xmath0b or @xmath3b , respectively , has to be reproduced .    while the resonant cross section ( or @xmath6-factor ) of @xmath0b(p,@xmath17)@xmath13be can be reproduced well by the dwba alone , an interfering resonance in @xmath0b(p,@xmath8)@xmath13be@xmath9 and  due to their unnatural parity  the resonances in @xmath3b(p,@xmath1)@xmath15be have to be treated explicitly assuming , e.g. , single - level breit - wigner expressions ( see sect .",
    "at high energies the transition to the ground state of @xmath13be ( @xmath38 mev  @xcite , binding energy @xmath39 mev  @xcite of the triton in the @xmath0b nucleus ) was previously analyzed by means of the dwba method  @xcite .",
    "for the transition to the first excited state at sub - coulomb energies , there has only been a simplified dwba calculation of the direct reaction contribution to the cross section which considered only the coulomb potential  @xcite . to our knowledge",
    ", no calculation of the contribution of the transition to the ground state at sub - coulomb energies has been performed so far .",
    "the spectroscopic factors @xmath40 are listed in table  [ tab1 ] . for the calculation of the folding potential in the @xmath1-@xmath13be channel as well as for the bound state ( t-@xmath13be )",
    "the density distribution of @xmath13li  @xcite was used instead of the unknown distribution of @xmath13be .    in our calculation ,",
    "the strength factor @xmath35 for the optical potential in the proton channel was adjusted in such a way that the phase shift of the optical s - wave at the resonance energy @xmath41 mev was @xmath42 , thereby producing the s - wave resonance previously suggested  @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath35 in the alpha channel remained an open parameter since there are no elastic scattering data available for the unstable nucleus @xmath13be .",
    "the imaginary part of the potential in the proton channel is very small because there are no other channels open at these low energies besides the ( p,@xmath43 ) and ( p,@xmath1 ) channels .",
    "the complete set of optical parameters is given in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "for the transition to the first excited state of @xmath13be@xmath9 ( @xmath44 mev ) the optical potential in the proton channel stays the same as for the ground state transition .",
    "we also assume that the potential for @xmath13be@xmath45 can , to first order , be approximated by the potential for @xmath13be@xmath46 .    for @xmath0b(p,@xmath17)@xmath13be",
    "the resulting @xmath6-factors in the energy range @xmath47 kev are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig1a ] and [ fig1b ] .",
    "the experimental results  @xcite are well reproduced with the resonance width being about 15 kev , in agreement with other measurements  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the calculated energy dependence of the @xmath6-factor is only valid for bare nuclei . due to electron screening ,",
    "measurements to even lower energies would not show the same breit - wigner like shape .",
    "the deviation of the experimental data at the two lowest measured energies in fig .",
    "[ fig1a ] is already due to screening effects  @xcite .",
    "the calculated differential cross sections show the same isotropic behaviour as can be seen in the data of ref .",
    "@xcite .      using the same approach",
    "as described above we also calculated the cross sections for the transition to the first excited state at energies @xmath47 kev .",
    "interference effects with other resonances ( especially a broad 5/2@xmath20 level at about 550 kev ) were reported in  @xcite at slightly higher projectile energies . in order to successfully reproduce the experimental data  @xcite",
    "while keeping unchanged all of the parameters entering the dwba computation , we had to include that 5/2@xmath20 level in our calculation .",
    "this was achieved by a single - level breit - wigner fit to the level at 550 kev and by finally calculating a total cross section ( or @xmath6-factor , respectively ) from the interference of the breit - wigner and the dwba contributions .",
    "the single level breit - wigner formula is given by  @xcite @xmath48 the quantities @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 denote the total angular momentum of the resonance , of the incoming proton and of the @xmath0b target nucleus , respectively , @xmath52 is the energy dependent proton partial width of the resonance with orbital angular momentum @xmath16 , @xmath53 is the energy independent alpha partial width , and @xmath54 is the total width of the resonance as given by @xmath55 @xmath56 would be small and is neglected here . due to the positive @xmath57-value it is sufficient to consider the energy dependence of only the proton partial width @xmath58 .",
    "this energy dependence can be described by  @xcite : @xmath59 with the penetrability @xmath60 given in terms of the regular and irregular coulomb wave functions @xmath61 and @xmath62 and the nuclear radius @xmath63 . for simplicity",
    ", @xmath63 will be derived here from the coulomb charge radius ( light ion convention ) : @xmath64 the dimensionless quantity @xmath65 is the reduced proton width .    the available experimental data  @xcite were not sufficient to yield an unambiguous fit within our calculation .",
    "a small alpha width leads to a larger proton width and vice versa .",
    "for example , with a resonance energy of @xmath66 kev we obtain the following pairs of alpha partial width and proton reduced width : @xmath67=0.1 kev , @xmath65=0.49 and @xmath67=500.0 kev , @xmath65=0.01 .",
    "we were not able to distinguish between the different sets in our chi square fit .",
    "( however , the resonant ( p,@xmath43 ) cross section  @xcite seems to favor a large reduced width for the proton channel if the gamma width is assumed to be small ) .",
    "finally , we can write the energy - dependent @xmath6-factor as @xmath68^{1/2 }             \\cos \\delta \\quad .\\ ] ] the phase shift @xmath69 is given by  @xcite @xmath70    the total @xmath6-factors and the dwba and breit - wigner contributions are shown in fig .  [ fig2 ] .",
    "although the experimental data  @xcite are quite well reproduced at higher energies , the agreement slightly worsens toward lower energies .",
    "the experiment seems to give a larger value for the width of the 10 kev resonance .",
    "this is caused by the assumption that the imaginary part of the optical potential in the proton channel is the same as for the transition to the ground state of @xmath13be .",
    "actually , the imaginary part for the @xmath22 transition should be slightly larger because more flux is going into the @xmath71 channel than into the relatively small @xmath22 channel which is included in the imaginary part used for the ground state transition . with a larger imaginary part the resonance width is increased .",
    "this result is very sensitive to the depth of the imaginary optical potential ; with an increase by only 50 kev the resonance structure is already flattened out completely .",
    "however , in order to get an upper limit on the contribution of this transition to the total @xmath6-factor we used the same optical potential as for the ground state transition .",
    "the thermonuclear reaction rate @xmath72 is given in table  [ tab6 ] , where @xmath73 is the avogadro constant and the bracketed quantity is the velocity averaged product of the cross section and the relative velocity of the interacting particles  @xcite . in fig .",

    "@xcite is shown .",
    "this rate remained unchanged in a more recent compilation  @xcite of reaction rates .",
    "since the @xmath41 mev resonance was not taken into account in @xcite , its rates differ considerably from our new values in the corresponding temperature region .",
    "our calculation shows that the contribution of the reaction @xmath0b(p,@xmath8)@xmath13be@xmath9 is less than 10@xmath74 of the rate for the ground state transition , and that the compiled rates have to be revised .",
    "cross sections for this reaction were measured in ref .",

    "the reaction can proceed either via a direct 3@xmath1-breakup , or via a sequential decay involving the states of @xmath15be .",
    "it was demonstrated in  @xcite that the direct 3@xmath1-breakup makes no significant contribution ( less than 5 % ) to the total cross section at all the energies investigated ( @xmath75 to 1100 kev ) .",
