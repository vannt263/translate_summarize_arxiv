    "a lot of interest in recent years has been raised for field theories where the standard model of high - energy physics is assumed to live on a 3-brane embedded in a larger space - time , while only the gravitational fields are in contrast usually considered to live in the whole spacetime @xcite .",
    "arkani - hamed _",
    "et al _ @xcite , proposed a new framework for solving the hierarchy problem which does not rely on supersymmetry or techi - color .",
    "the novelty in this idea was that the traditional picture of planck - length - sized additional spacelike dimensions ( @xmath0 cm ) was abandoned , and the extra dimensions could have a size as large as 1 mm .",
    "the fact that we do not see experimental signs of the extra dimensions despite that the compactification scale of the extra dimensions @xmath1 would have to be much smaller than the weak scale , implies that only gravity can propagate in the extra - dimensional spacetime and all ordinary matter : electromagnetic , weak and strong forces , is restricted to live on a ( 3 + 1 ) dimensional hypersurfaces , a 3-brane .",
    "+ the presence of extra dimensions in brane world gravity models will inevitably change the properties and physics of black holes . in brane - world scenario ,",
    "the production cross - section for black holes is greatly enhanced .",
    "detectable signals of black holes might be found via hawking evaporation to brane - localized modes . if the scale of quantum gravity is near a tev , the large hadron collider ( lhc ) will become a `` black hole factory '' @xcite .",
    "the correlations between the black hole mass and its temperature , deduced from the energy spectrum of the decay products , can test hawking s evaporation law .",
    "the absorption cross - section ( and also grey body factors ) of black holes in different physical scenario have been investigated by several authors@xcite .",
    "the emission rate of 4-dimensional acoustic black holes for @xmath2 wave has been studied in ref.@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we would like to investigate the absorption cross - section of higher dimensional acoustic black holes .",
    "+ the remarkable work of unruh , in 1981 , developed a way of mapping certain aspects of black holes in supersonic flows and pointed out that propagation of sound in a fluid or gas turning supersonic  @xcite , is similar to the propagation of a scalar field close to a black hole , and thus experimental investigation of the hawking radiation is possible . from then on ,",
    "several candidates have been considered for the experimental test of the analogue of black holes  @xcite .",
    "+ in the present study , we extend 4-dimensional acoustic black hole metric into arbitrary dimensional space - time in section 2 . then following the methods of ref.@xcite , we calculate the corresponding absorption probabilities and energy emission rates of such black hole analogues . in section 3 ,",
    "we present the calculation of bulk emission in @xmath3-dimensions for @xmath4 case by using the low energy perturbation method .",
    "section 4 performs the calculation of brane - localized scalar emission , where the brane is embedded in a @xmath3-dimensional bulk .",
    "we give the conclusions in section 5 .",
    "since the dynamics of effective black hole analogues metric are not described by the laws of gravity ( i.e. einstein equations ) in general , to extend the four dimensional effective metric we should start with the equations of fluid dynamics .",
    "we consider one kind of fluids which is permitted to propagate in @xmath3-dimensional space - time .",
    "the fluid might be condensate states of gravitons or some higher - dimensional scalar particles . in the following of our discussions ,",
    "we simply neglect quantum effects of such special quantum fluids and assume they obey the classical fluids equation ( euler equation ) in the low energy approximation .",
    "the fundamental equations of fluid dynamics in @xmath3-dimensional flat spacetime are the equation of continuity @xmath5 and euler s equations @xmath6=\\vec{f},\\ ] ] where @xmath7 , and @xmath8 . here",
    "@xmath9 denotes the newtonian gravitational potential .",
    "it is also assumed that the fluid to be irrotational and inviscid , which imply @xmath10 .",
    "these equations can be linearized in the vicinity of some mean flow solution with @xmath11 , @xmath12,@xmath13 , redefining the fields as @xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",
    "one can finally obtain the wave equation @xcite , @xmath16 + \\nabla\\cdot\\left[\\rho_{0}\\nabla\\varphi_{1}-\\frac{\\partial \\rho } { \\partial p}\\rho_{0}\\vec{v}_{0}(\\partial _ { t}\\varphi_{1}+\\vec{v}_{0}\\cdot\\nabla\\varphi_{1})\\right]=0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the above equation is identified with a massless scalar field equation describing the sound wave in the curved spacetime background @xmath17 with the background metric , @xmath18 , which is a @xmath19 matrix , where the local speed of sound is defined by @xmath20 , and @xmath21 . in spherical coordinates , assuming @xmath22 , @xmath23 , we then have @xmath24 ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is similar to the @xmath25-dimensional schwarzschild black hole metric  @xcite , @xmath26,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the light velocity and @xmath28 is the event horizon radius .",
    "the properties of higher dimensional schwarzschild black holes in brane - world scenario have been discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "however , the properties of acoustic black holes do not necessarily relate to the outside geometry of space - time since the dynamics of acoustic black holes do not obey einstein equation . in ref.@xcite , we have discussed black hole analogues in brane - world scenario under some assumptions and found the properties of acoustic black holes in brane - world scenario are similar to real black holes . if @xmath29 is time and position independent , the continuity equation @xmath30 then implies that @xmath31 . because of the barotropic assumption , @xmath29 is position independent implying the pressure @xmath32 and the speed of sound @xmath33 are also position independent .",
    "we can define a normalization constant @xmath34 and set @xmath35 with @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath34 is a parameter which can be determined by experiments .",
    "the metric can be rewritten as @xmath37,\\]]where @xmath38 .",
    "the temperature of an acoustic(sonic ) black hole is given by @xmath39 , where @xmath40 marks the exact position of the event horizon .",
    "for 4-dimensional cases , @xmath41 , we have the numerical expression , @xmath42[1\\textrm { mm}/r'_{0}].\\ ] ] for ( 4+n)-dimensional cases , @xmath43 , the temperature can then be written as @xmath44[1 \\textrm{mm}/r_{0}].\\ ] ] it is clear from the above equations that unless @xmath33 is very large ( i.e. to be the velocity of light @xmath45 m / sec ) , the experimental verification of above acoustic hawking temperature will be rather difficult",
    ". however , the higher dimensional black hole analogue metric presents us an alternative way to detect extra dimensions other than in lhc . by detecting signals via the acoustic black hole",
    "s evaporation to brane - localized modes , one can in principle determine the exact dimensions of space - time .",
    "however , since the standard model particles must to be located to an ordinary 4-dimensional spacetime , extra dimensions can only be probed through the gravitational force .",
    "the continuity equation @xmath30 in higher dimensions should only apply to gravitational waves or some unknown scalar particles .",
    "in this section and the next section , we shall calculate the decay rate of higher dimensional acoustic black holes from the near - horizon low energy dynamics , which is expected to give an experimental suggestion of detecting the thermal radiation .",
    "+ the radiation of higher dimensional acoustic black holes is usually described as thermal spectrum in character with a temperature @xmath46 . the energy emitted per unit time ( power spectrum ) by gravity - wave black hole analogues for a higher number of dimensions can be given by @xmath47where @xmath48 is the angular momentum quantum number and @xmath49 for massless particles .",
    "however , considering the nontrivial metric in the region exterior to the horizon , there exists an effective potential barrier in this exterior region .",
    "this potential barrier backscatters a part of the outgoing radiation back into the black hole . thus the original blackbody radiation is modified by a frequency dependent filtering function @xmath50 , caused by the gravitational potential of the black hole , which is called the  greybody factor \" .",
    "greybody factors are important theoretically and experimentally in that they depend on the number of extra dimensions and encode information on the near - horizon structure of black holes and can be used to identify a black hole event .",
    "+ for s wave bulk scalar emission of the @xmath3-dimensional gravity - wave black hole analogues , the calculation is similar to that of higher dimensional schwarzschild cases .",
    "the calculations do not depend on the concrete form of the metric .",
    "in fact , it has been proved that all spherically symmetric black holes , regardless of the theory in which they arise , the low energy cross section for massless minimally coupled scalars is always the area of the horizon  @xcite . following the method of ref .",
    "@xcite , we can obtain the spherical wave absorption probability , @xmath51}{2^{n}(n+1)}\\frac{\\gamma(\\frac{1-n}{2})}{\\gamma(\\frac{3+n}{2})}\\ ] ] the greybody factor can be computed by first evaluating the absorption probability , @xmath52 , from the ratio of the in - going flux at the future horizon to the incoming flux from past infinity with boundary condition that there is no outgoing flux at the horizon , and then using the generalized ( @xmath53)-dimensional optical theorem relation  @xcite @xmath54 between the absorption cross section @xmath50 and the absorption probability @xmath52 for the _ _ l-__th partial waves .",
    "+ we will then derive the scalar decay modes which are not spherically symmetric , @xmath55 .",
    "we start with the @xmath53-dimensional black hole analogue by rewriting eq.([acoustic ] ) in the following form , @xmath56 where @xmath57 and we have assumed @xmath58 . the scalar wave equation in this background is separable if we make the ansatz @xmath59 , where @xmath60 are now the @xmath61-spatial dimensional spherical harmonic functions .",
    "we can then obtain the radial part equation by substituting the above ansatz into the eq.([klein ] ) , which reads , @xmath62+\\left[\\omega^{2}-\\frac{h(r)l(l+n+1)}{r^{2}}\\right]r=0.\\ ] ] the idea of  @xcite is to solve this equation approximately in three regions : near - horizon regions , far field regions and intermediate regions , and match the solution across the boundaries of the regions .",
    "we will use the same method here , but simply solve the radial equation in near - horizon and far field regions , and assume that keep only the lowest order terms in @xmath63 in each region is enough . from the change of variables",
    "@xmath64 , we can write the scalar field equation eq.([radial ] ) in the form , @xmath65r=0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we set @xmath66 to be @xmath67 near the horizon . by redefining @xmath68 and removing singularities at @xmath69 and @xmath70 , the above equation can be reduced to a hypergeometric equation with @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , where , @xmath74 thus , we have , @xmath75\\frac{df}{dh}-abf=0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which has a solution the hypergeometric function @xmath76  @xcite .",
    "the criterion for the convergence of the hypergeometric function demands that @xmath77 , which force us to choose @xmath78 .",
    "then , the general solution of eq.([ref ] ) is , @xmath79expanding the above solution in the near - horizon region in the limit @xmath80 , or @xmath81 , and choosing @xmath82 , we obtain the result , @xmath83,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath84 is defined by @xmath85 . to calculate the greybody factor",
    ", we must impose the boundary condition that near the horizon the solution is purely ingoing and then we set @xmath86  @xcite . + by using the @xmath87 transformation of hypergeometric functions , @xmath88 the near - horizon solution ( [ rh ] ) expanded in terms of @xmath89 is given by , @xmath90,\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath91 has been set to vanish . expanding the above expression in the limit @xmath92 , we get , @xmath93 the derivation of the far - field zone which is defined by @xmath94 . in this limit , @xmath95 and , by setting @xmath96 , eq.([radial ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath97f=0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is a @xmath98-th order bessel equation .",
    "the solution of the above equation are the bessel functions @xmath99where @xmath100 and @xmath101 are the bessel functions of the first and second kind , respectively . for small @xmath102",
    ", we can expand the above formula into , @xmath103 in order to match the solutions across the boundaries of near - horizon field and far - field zone , we need to rewrite the near - horizon solution in terms of ( @xmath89 ) , before expanding the solution in the limit @xmath94 .",
    "matching the two solutions eqs.([h1 ] ) and ( [ far ] ) , we obtain the ratio , @xmath104    the ingoing and outgoing waves of eq.([far ] ) can be decomposed by introducing the redefinition of amplitudes .",
    "we expand eq.([far ] ) in the limit @xmath105 , and then we obtain , @xmath106 where @xmath107 and @xmath108 is defined by , @xmath109 the reflection coefficient @xmath110 is defined as the ratio of the outgoing amplitude over the incoming amplitude at infinity , @xmath111 the absorption probability can be written , in terms of @xmath112 , as @xmath113 in the limit of @xmath114 and @xmath115 , the absorption probability can approximately be written as @xmath116 from figure 1 , we can see that if we fix the angular momentum number and vary only the number of extra dimensions , the absorption probability decreases as @xmath25 increases , since the expansions of @xmath117 is in powers of @xmath118 . thus , @xmath117 should become more and more suppressed as @xmath25 increases . the same behavior is observed if we fix instead @xmath25 and vary @xmath48 . + according to figure 2 , the emission rate of scalar fields in the bulk is enhanced as the number of extra dimensions increases .",
    "this is caused by the increase of the temperature of gravity - wave black hole analogues , which finally overcome the decreases in the value of the greybody factor and causes the enhancement of the emission rate with @xmath25 at high energies .",
    "figure 5 depicts the behavior of the energy emission rates for particles with the angular number @xmath152 in the low and intermediate energy regime .",
    "the figure shows that the energy and the number of particles , emitted per unit time and energy interval is strongly enhanced , as @xmath25 increases since the temperature of the black hole is given by the relation @xmath153 , which indicates that for fixed @xmath34 , the temperature of the gravity - wave black hole analogues increases as @xmath25 increases .",
    "this means the energy of the emission particles also increases .",
    "in summary , we have extended the 4-dimensional acoustic black hole metric to higher dimensions that is similar to higher dimensional schwarzschild metric in form but is not exactly any of the standard geometries typically considered in general relativity .",
    "the fluids here have been assumed to fill all the spacial dimensions including extra dimensions .",
    "we emphasize that the higher dimensional acoustic black holes discussed above is just a model , which may help us understand the physics beyond the standard model and are falsifiable by the future experiments .",
    "although it might be difficult to detect the hawking effects of these analogues in experiments since the hawking temperature in fact is very low , they provide us an otherwise way to probe extra dimensions .",
    "+ the scalar emission of hawking particles in both @xmath3-dimensional bulk scalar field and 4-dimensional brane - localized scalar field were studied respectively in a higher dimensional gravity - wave black hole analogues background . the amplitude probability in a bulk scalar field",
    "was obtained that allows one to find its dependence on the number of extra dimensions @xmath25 and the angular momentum number @xmath48 .",
    "we found that if we fix the angular momentum number and vary only the number of extra dimensions , the absorption probability decreases as @xmath25 increases , and @xmath117 should become more and more suppressed as @xmath25 increases . the same behavior is observed if we fix instead @xmath25 and vary @xmath48 .",
    "the case in which the scalar field is confined on a 3-brane in a higher dimensional spacetime background is also discussed .",
    "the resulting absorption probability depends only on the angular momentum number through @xmath154 .",
    "if we keep @xmath25 fixed and varying @xmath48 , the absorption probability decreases as @xmath48 increases .",
    "but , in both bulk and brane - localized cases , the energy emission rates are enhanced as @xmath25 increases since the temperature of the gravity - wave black hole analogues increases as @xmath25 increases .",
