    "however , subsequent investigations demonstrated that naively expected quantum radiations from thermal random motions induced by the unruh effect almost cancel out due to the interference effect @xcite .",
    "these works also showed the cancellation is not complete and some quantum radiation remains , though its physical origin is not well understood .    in order to clarify the possible signature of the unruh effect in the quantum radiation",

    "we point out that this quantum radiation is related to the nonlocal correlation nature of the minkowski vacuum state , which has its origin in the entanglement of the state between the left and the right rindler wedges .",

    "thus the law of the equipartition of energy with the unruh temperature is satisfied as a consequence of the unruh effect .",

    "in summary the influence of the detector in the quantum vacuum is generated in the r - region , which is described by @xmath17 , and propagates into the f - region .",
    "however , the system can not be closed within the r - region . as we showed , the remaining energy flux in the f - region , which can be calculated from the two point functions there , depends on the interference between @xmath17 and @xmath121 in the f - region . due to the causality ,",
    "properties of the quantum field @xmath16 in the f - region are influenced by the properties of the quantum states not only in the r - region but also in the l - region .",
    "since the minkowski vacuum is entangled between these two regions , the correlation function of @xmath17 and @xmath121 contains the information of the entanglement of the minkowski vacuum .",
    "if there was no entanglement , the energy flux would be completely cancelled out and vanish .",
    "thus , we can conclude that the remaining radiation is a consequence of the nonlocal correlation ( or the entanglement ) of the minkowski vacuum between the r and l regions , and it may be called the quantum radiation .",
    "detectability of the quantum radiation is an interesting issue , and in order to discuss it , we first need to extend the present calculation to more realistic systems .",
    "it is also necessary to satisfy the condition that thermalization time ( or the relaxation time ) @xmath122 @xcite , with which the system becomes in an equilibrium phase , must be shorter than the time during which a uniform acceleration is maintained .",
