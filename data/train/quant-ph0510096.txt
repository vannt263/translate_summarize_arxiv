    "stabilizer states and codes are an important concept in quantum information theory .",
    "stabilizer codes @xcite play a central role in the theory of quantum error correcting codes , which protect quantum information against decoherence and without which effective quantum computation has no chance of existing .",
    "recently , a promising alternative setup for quantum computation has been found that is based on the preparation of a stabilizer state ( more specifically a cluster state ) and one - qubit measurements @xcite .",
    "also in the area of quantum cryptography and quantum communication , both bipartite as multipartite , the number of applications of stabilizer states is abundant .",
    "we cite refs .",
    "@xcite , but this is far from an exhaustive list .",
    "closely related to quantum error correction , entanglement distillation is a means of extracting entanglement from quantum states that have been disrupted by the environment .",
    "many applications require pure multipartite entangled states that are shared by remote parties . in practice ,",
    "these pure states are prepared by one party and communicated to the others by an imperfect quantum channel . as a result ,",
    "the states are no longer pure . a distillation protocol then consists of local operations combined with classical communication in order to end up with states that approach purity and are suited for the application in mind .",
    "an interesting distillation protocol for bell states is the well - known hashing protocol , introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , that has its roots in classical information theory .    in this paper",
    ", we describe a generalization of this hashing protocol from bipartite to multipartite .",
    "it distills an important particular kind of stabilizer states , called css states , short for calderbank - shor - steane states .",
    "bell states , cat states and cluster states ( more generally two - colorable graph states ) are examples of or locally equivalent to css states . in brief",
    ", the protocol goes as follows : @xmath0 copies of an @xmath1-qubit mixed state are shared by @xmath1 remote parties .",
    "they perform local unitary operations and measurements that , if @xmath0 is large , result in a state that approaches @xmath2 copies of a pure @xmath1-qubit css state , where @xmath3 is the yield of the protocol .",
    "the basic idea of describing the protocol in a classical information theoretical setting is the same as in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "very similar multipartite hashing protocols have been discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , ref .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite for two - colorable graph states , cat states and css states respectively .",
    "our protocol improves these protocols in two ways .",
    "first , we note that in refs .",
    "@xcite , by not exploiting information theory to a full extent , their protocols result in overkill . in short , demanding that the number of measurements exceed the marginal entropies @xcite of each separate party results in too many measurements . in ref .",
    "@xcite , this is partially meeted by relaxing to conditional entropies .",
    "we will show that our protocol is optimal in the given setting and is therefore a complete generalization of the hashing protocol for bell states to css states .",
    "the yield is calculated as the solution of a linear programming problem , and requires a somewhat more involved information - theoretical treatment .",
    "a second major difference is that the local unitary operations applied in refs .",
    "@xcite only consist of cnots , whereas in some cases a higher yield can be achieved by using more general local clifford operations . to this end",
    ", we need to know which local clifford operations result in a permutation of all possible @xmath4 @xmath0-fold tensor products of an @xmath1-qubit css state .",
    "this is done efficiently using the binary matrix description of stabilizer states and clifford operations of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sectionbinary ]",
    ", we introduce the binary framework in which stabilizer states and clifford operations are efficiently described . in section  [ sectioninfo ] , we define the strongly typical set , an information - theoretical concept that is needed to calculate the yield . in section  [ sectionperm ] , we derive necessary and sufficient conditions that local clifford operations have to satisfy to result in a permutation of the @xmath4 @xmath0-fold tensor products of an @xmath1-qubit css state . this result is a generalization of ref .",
    "@xcite , and is also interesting for more recurrence - like protocols as also introduced in ref .",
    "but we will not go deeper into this issue in this paper . in section  [ sectionprotocol ] ,",
    "we explain how our hashing protocol works and calculate the yield in section  [ sectionyield ] .",
    "finally , the protocol is illustrated and compared to others by an example in section  [ sectionex ] .",
    "readers that are merely interested in the results can skip almost entirely sections  [ sectioninfo ] , [ sectionperm ] , [ sectionyield ] and the appendices .",
    "in this section , we present the binary matrix description of stabilizer states and clifford operations .",
    "we show how clifford operations act on stabilizer states in the binary picture .",
    "we also formulate a simple criterion for separability of a stabilizer state .",
    "css states are then defined as a special kind of stabilizer states , and we show the particular properties of their binary matrix description",
    ". we will restrict ourselves to definitions and properties that are necessary to the distillation protocols presented in the next sections . in the following ,",
