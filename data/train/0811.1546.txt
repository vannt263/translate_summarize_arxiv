    "discovery of superconductivity in the la(o , f)feas system @xcite and the subsequent development of the superconducting re(o , f)feas ( re= rare earth la , nd , ce , sm , ... ; `` 1111 '' ) @xcite and ( a , k)fe@xmath7as@xmath7 ( a = ba , sr , ca ; `` 122 '' ) systems @xcite have generated renewed excitement and interest in studies of superconductivity in correlated electron systems . in this paper , we first review recent muon spin relaxation ( @xmath0sr ) measurements of static magnetic order and superfluid density in the 1111 and 122 feas systems , and compare the results with those for high-@xmath5 cuprates , organic bedt , a@xmath1c@xmath2 and other exotic superconductors .",
    "we then look into energy scales of the magnetic resonance mode ( observed by inelastic neutron scattering ) and of the superconducting coherence peak ( by arpes ) , and suggest that both of these are manifestations of soft - mode excitations analogous to rotons in superfluid @xmath6he . after discussing the roles of the superfluid density and the soft - mode energy scales in determining @xmath5",
    ", we will propose a pairing mechanism in correlated - electron superconductors based on a resonant spin - charge motion / coupling , which we term as `` traffic - light resonance . ''",
    "the original ideas of this picture were presented in refs .",
    "static magnetic order in the undoped and lightly - doped compounds of the 1111 and 122 feas families has been studied by neutron scattering @xcite , @xmath0sr @xcite and moessbauer - effect measurements @xcite .",
    "all the undoped systems exhibit long - range collinear antiferromagnetic ( af ) order of fe moments @xcite .",
    "the size of the ordered moment can be estimated from the hyperfine field in moessbauer experiments and @xmath0sr precession frequencies @xmath12 in zero field .",
    "since the hyperfine coupling constants between fe moments and muon spins are nearly equal ( difference @xmath13 10 % ) for the 1111 and 122 compounds @xcite , the @xmath0sr frequency @xmath12 represents the temperature and system variation of the ordered fe moment .",
    "figure 1(a ) shows our @xmath0sr results on several non - superconducting undoped and lightly - doped 1111 @xcite and 122 compounds @xcite .",
    "this figure demonstrates that the size of the ordered fe moments varies continuously from @xmath14 0.1 to 1.0 bohr magnetons , nearly scaling with @xmath15 .",
    "this feature contrasts clearly with cuprate systems with static af or stripe spin order , which almost always appears with ordered moment size @xmath14 0.5 bohr magnetons per cu at @xmath4 .",
    "the variable moment size in feas systems suggests an itinerant character of 3-d electrons forming multiple bands .",
    "figure 1(b ) shows the magnetic and superconducting phase diagrams of the 1111 feas systems reported for re = la by luetkens",
    "_ et al . _",
    "@xcite ( blue lines ) and re = sm by drew _",
    "@xcite ( red ) both based on @xmath0sr , and for re = ce by zhao _",
    "_ @xcite ( green ) on neutron measurements .",
    "the evolution from af to superconducting ( sc ) states occurs with abrupt first - order - like change in the la systems , second - order - like change in the ce systems , and associated with a region of coexisting magnetism and superconductivity in the sm systems . in zf-@xmath0sr studies on ceo@xmath16f@xmath17feas @xcite using the same sample studied by zhao et al .",
    "@xcite , we found a short - range static magnetic order developing below t = 40 k as shown in fig .",
    "this makes the re = ce phase diagram closer to those of re = la and sm .",
    "superconductivity in the 122 ( a , k)fe@xmath7as@xmath7 ( a = ca , ba , sr ) systems can be obtained by hole doping @xcite as well as by application of hydrostatic pressure to the undoped parent compounds @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "our @xmath0sr studies @xcite have revealed that superconducting specimens exhibit static magnetic order in a partial volume fraction , typically @xmath1450 %  of the total volume .",
    "figure 1(c ) shows the phase diagram for cafe@xmath7as@xmath7 in hydrostatic pressure , based on our @xmath0sr results for static magnetic order @xcite and resistivity / susceptibility results @xcite for superconductivity .",
    "magnetic order survives in a partial volume fraction over the superconducting dome , indicating that magnetism is stronger in the 122 systems than in the 1111 family , probably due to the more 3-dimensional nature of the 122 systems .    at this moment",
    ", there is no information on the length scale of the segregation .",
    "it is also unclear whether superconductivity occurs exclusively in volumes without static magnetic order or if it prevails over the entire volume .",
    "evolution from the af to sc state is also accosiated with phase separation in the cuprates near the static stripe order , where @xmath0sr studies found microscopic segregation with a length scale comparable to the in - plane coherence length and superconductivity surviving exclusively in volumes without static magnetism @xcite .",
    "we consider that this is a likely scenario for the 122 feas systems as well .",
    "with increasing pressure and decreasing unit - cell volume , superconductivity in organic ( bedt - ttf)@xmath7-x @xcite and alkali - doped a@xmath1c@xmath2 @xcite appears adjacent to static magnetic order .",
    "phase diagrams of bedt , a@xmath1c@xmath2 , cuprates , heavy - fermion , and feas systems suggest that superconductivity and antiferromagnetism compete for the ground state .",
    "the evolution is often associated with a first - order transition , as spatial phase separation was found in the cuprates @xcite , cecu@xmath7si@xmath7 @xcite , bedt @xcite and 122 feas @xcite while abrupt change was found in cerhin@xmath8 @xcite , a@xmath1c@xmath2 @xcite and re = la 1111 feas @xcite .",
    "note that superfluid @xmath6he exhibits similar first - order quantum transition from the hcp solid to superfluid state with decreasing pressure .",
    "the relevance of this phenomenon shall be discussed in the following sections .",
    "phase separation between volumes with and without static magnetic order has also been detected by @xmath0sr in the insulating frustrated square lattice j@xmath18-j@xmath7 system cu(cl , br)la(nb , ta)@xmath7o@xmath19 at the boundary between collinear af and spin - gapped states @xcite .",
    "this similarity suggests an important role played by spin frustration in determining the magnetic states of the feas systems @xcite .",
    "the itinerant electron aspect and the j@xmath18-j@xmath7 frustration should be viewed not necessarily as contradictory concepts , but rather as interplaying elements of the physics in feas superconductors .",
    "in type - ii superconductors , the london penetration depth @xmath20 can be determined from the muon spin relaxation rate @xmath21 defined for the gaussian relaxation envelope @xmath22 observed in a high transverse external field ( tf ) , as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the superconducting carrier density , @xmath25 is the effective mass , and the clean limit is assumed here for simplicity @xcite .",
    "tf-@xmath0sr measurements have been performed on several 1111 and 122 feas superconductors @xcite .",
    "figure 2(a ) shows a plot of @xmath26 versus @xmath5 .",
    "the results from feas systems follow the nearly linear trend found for cuprates , a@xmath1c@xmath2 and organic bedt systems @xcite . in theories based on bcs condensation , the transition temperature @xmath5",
    "is related to the energy scale of attractive interaction represented by the gap energy , while one expects only weak and indirect dependence of @xmath5 on @xmath24 .",
    "in contrast , if @xmath5 is governed by the acquisition of phase coherence as in bose - einstein ( be ) condensation of pre - formed pairs , one expects a direct correlation between @xmath5 and @xmath24 . the remarkable universality in fig .",
    "2(a ) suggests strong relevance of the latter case to condensation in all these exotic superconductors , including feas systems .",
    "this point can be further appreciated if we convert the horizontal axis to `` effectve fermi energy '' @xmath10 @xcite , which is proportional to @xmath3 in 2-dimensional ( 2-d ) systems . for 3-d systems ,",
    "@xmath10 can be derived by combining @xmath3 with another parameter , such as the sommerfeld constant .",
    "the resulting plot of @xmath5 versus @xmath10 is shown in fig .",
    "2(b ) , where the be condensation temperature @xmath27 of an ideal non - interacting bose gas is shown by the broken line .",
    "although their actual @xmath5 s are lower than @xmath27 by about a factor of 4 - 5 , cuprates , feas , a@xmath1c@xmath2 , organic bedt , and some heavy - fermion systems exhibit the highest ratios @xmath28 of @xmath5 with respect to the kinetic energy @xmath10 of superconducting carriers .    in fig .",
    "we also include a point for laofep @xcite , which does not follow the linear trend .",
    "it has been known for many years that the 214 cuprate systems `` branch off '' from the linear trend @xcite , leading the optimally doped 214 lsco superconductor to have @xmath5 about a factor 2 lower than the 123 ybco system with the same superfluid density .",
    "these features suggest that @xmath3 is not the sole factor for determination of @xmath5 .",
    "closeness to the competing state with static magnetic order is likely the reason why lsco and laofep systems have relatively low @xmath5 s with respect to their superfluid densities . in fig .",
    "2(b ) , we include a point corresponding to superfluid @xmath6he .",
    "the superfluid transition of @xmath6he occurs at t = 2.2 k in ambient pressure , which is reduced by about 30 %  from @xmath27 = 3.2 k for a non - interacting bose gas with corresponding boson density and mass . understanding the mechanisms for `` reduction '' of @xmath5 in these cases would help identifying the additional factor(s ) which determine @xmath5 in correlated electron systems .    before discussing about competing states ,",
    "let us also look into a spin energy scale .",
    "moriya and ueda @xcite derived a `` spin fluctuation temperature '' @xmath29 from transport , susceptibility and specific - heat measurements as the energy scale expected for spin fluctuations at the zone boundary .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "2(c ) , they found a nearly linear correlation between @xmath5 and @xmath29 . although @xmath29 was derived through a theoretical model , this parameter is close to the actual energy scale observed in inelastic neutron scattering , as demonstrated by the point for cecu@xmath7si@xmath7 ( blue solid circle ) representing available neutron results @xcite . in this figure , we also include a point for ( sr , k)fe@xmath7as@xmath7 ( red solid circle ) based on its @xmath5 and spin wave dispersions measured in srfe@xmath7as@xmath7 @xcite . comparison of figs .",
    "2(b ) and 2(c ) reveals a remarkable correspondence of charge ( @xmath30 ) and spin ( @xmath29 ) energy scales in many exotic superconductors .",
    "this feature shall be discussed in sections 6 and 7 .",
    "in the case of superfluid @xmath6he , collective excitations of rotons provide a channel for thermal depletion of condensed bosons .",
    "thanks to the large phase - space factor for substantial momentum transfer , the roton - minimum energy @xmath31 plays a dominant role in determining superfluid @xmath5 , as was noticed by laudau and ruvalds @xcite . the experimental confirmation of this concept can be obtained by plotting early neutron results @xcite of @xmath31 versus the superfluid lambda temperature @xmath5 in ambient and applied pressure . the nearly linear relationship shown in fig .",
    "3 verifies that the roton energy determines @xmath5 of the superfluid state .",
    "rotons are soft - mode phonons related to solid hcp he , whose energy reflects the `` closeness '' of the superfluid state to the adjacent and competing solid he state .",
    "here we find a good example of how the competing state influences superconducting or superfluid transitions , by providing thermodynamically excitable soft collective modes .",
    "this process does not involve `` pair - breaking , '' but rather puts a condensed boson into a state with different phase .",
    "soft - mode excitation is thus a process of phase fluctuation , distinct from the kosterlitz - thouless process due to low dimensionality @xcite .",
    "versus collective mode energy @xmath32 for rotons in superfluid @xmath6he in ambient and applied pressure ( orange stars ) @xcite , magnetic resonance mode ( mrm ) in various cuprates ( solid circles ) @xcite , spin - gap energies in lsco and ybco ( solid squares ) @xcite , mrm in ( ba , k)fe@xmath7as@xmath7 ( red flat solid circle ) @xcite , cecoin@xmath8 ( brown tall open circle ) @xcite , cecu@xmath7si@xmath7 ( brown tall open circle ) @xcite , raman a@xmath33 mode energy in cuprates ( open circles ) @xcite , arpes scp peak energies in cuprates ( solid reverse triangles ) @xcite .",
    "the horizontal and vertical axes set for he and heavy fermions ( brown axis label ) has the same aspect ratio as that for other systems ( black label ) , to facilitate comparisons of the slope @xmath34.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the magnetic resonance mode ( mrm ) , observed by inelastic neutron scattering , is a likely candidate for an analoguous soft mode in correlated - electron superconductors .",
    "figure 3 demonstrates that the mode energy @xmath35 of the mrm of various cuprates @xcite scales with their @xmath5 , and the ratios @xmath36 ( slope in fig .",
    "3 ) are comparable to that of rotons .",
    "the mrm is a spin soft mode related to the stripe spin - charge ordered state in the cuprates .",
    "recent neutron studies revealed an `` hour - glass - shape '' dispersion relation of this mode @xcite .",
    "for consideration of thermodynamic effects , one should use the low energy peak of populated states on the hour - glass dispersion , which is often denoted as the `` spin gap energy . '' the spin gap energy , shown by solid square symbols in fig .",
    "3 , exhibits even better agreement with the slope @xmath37 of rotons in @xmath6he .",
    "very recently , the mrm was also observed in ( ba , k)fe@xmath7as@xmath7 @xcite , cecoin@xmath8 @xcite , and cecu@xmath7si@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "amazingly , the points for these systems closely follow the roton relationship in fig .",
    "3 . in general , the excitation energy of @xmath144 - 5@xmath38 in fig .",
    "3 can be expected for the roton - like pair - non - breaking excitations as well as for pair - breaking single - particle excitations across the d - wave energy gap . for the former",
    ", we shall expect responses sharply localized in momentum space corresponding to the bragg peak position of the competing magnetic state . in contrast , pair - breaking single - particle excitations must have a broad intensity profile in momentum space .",
    "the mrm s observed in all these exotic superconductors exhibit very sharp profiles in momentum space , supporting our interpretation of collective soft modes associated with competing states .",
    "note that rotons and mrm s are fluctuations characteristic to first - order quantum phase transitions .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "3 , the energy scale of the mrm spin response is also followed by energies of charge excitations in cuprates , i.e. , the a1@xmath39 response of raman measurements @xcite at the zone center and the superconducting coherence peak ( scp ) energy of angle resolved photo emission ( arpes ) measurements observed near ( @xmath9,0 ) @xcite . additionally , fig .",
    "4e of ref .",
    "@xcite clearly demonstrates that the arpes scp `` peak '' energy of various cuprate systems corresponds to the neutron mrm energy .",
    "furthermore , the energy - momentum dispersion of the spin and charge soft mode responses are nearly identical to each other , as shown by fig .",
    "4(a ) which compares the mrm hour - glass dispersion @xcite with that of the low - momentum `` @xmath40 '' charge mode response in scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) measurements @xcite , and by fig .",
    "4(b ) which shows the energy input for the scp response of arpes measurements in the tl2201 system near ( @xmath9,0 ) @xcite .",
    "figure 4(c ) shows the spin - charge modulation pattern of stripe correlations in the cuprates .",
    "when the magnetic state wins against the competing superconducting state , this pattern becomes static , accompanied by spin and charge bragg peaks @xcite shown by the solid circles in fig .",
    "when the superconducting state wins , this pattern becomes dynamic and short - ranged soft - mode correlations .",
    "even in such a dynamic / inelastic situation , one would expect strong spin and charge coupling .",
    "in other words , by paying the energy cost of mode energies , inelastic spin and charge probes detect responses from temporary and short - range stripe patterns .",
    "in this situation , it is natural to expect an identical energy cost for the corresponding spin and charge excitations .",
    "the mrm represents collective spin - wave excitations from this short - ranged spin - charge pattern .",
    "the excitation energy @xmath1410 - 50 mev of the mrm , much lower than the exchange energy @xmath41100 - 200 mev in the cuprates , indicates that this process does not involve `` pair - breaking '' which costs energy @xmath42 .",
    "similarly , the arpes scp peak is produced when a charge is knocked out from the temporary stripe pattern , where no pair - breaking energy @xmath42 is required thanks to local spin frustration adjacent to charges .",
    "thus , we expect the existence of twin spin and charge excitations , the former near ( @xmath43 ) and the latter near the zone center , as illustrated in fig .",
    "4(e ) and compared with the dispersion of rotons in superfluid he @xcite and bragg peaks of hcp solid he @xcite in fig .",
    "this feature explains why the raman energy corresponds one - to - one with the neutron mrm energy , instead of the commonly - observed `` two - magnon raman '' response appearing with twice the spin excitation energy .",
    "these inelastic collective soft - mode excitations in cuprates are characterized by an unusually strong spin - charge coupling and sharply selective momentum transfers .",
    "the strong spin - charge coupling also explains why the excitation of the spin branch in mrm contributes to the depletion of condensed bosons , thus influencing the superconducting @xmath5 analogously to the case of rotons .",
    "the closer the superconducting state is to the competing magnetic state , the lower is the energy of the soft - resonance mode , consequently resulting in the lower @xmath5 .",
    "although it is yet to be verified experimentally , one may well expect a similar situation in other strongly - correlated superconductors existing adjacent to competing magnetic states .",
    "now we shall consider microscopic processes which lead to strong spin - charge coupling , absence of superconductivity in regions with static magnetic order , and strong directional dependence of the charge coherence as found in the difference between nodal and antinodal carriers in the cuprates .",
    "figure 5(a ) illustrates charge motion in cuprates in the environment of antiferromagnetic spin correlations . when the spin pattern is static , the hopping motion of a hole in the antinodal direction ( horizontal or vertical direction in fig .",
    "5(a ) ) immediately results in an energy cost due to spin frustration .",
    "this frustration , however , can be avoided when the hopping occurs sequentially with spin fluctuations .",
    "specifically , when the time scale of the charge motion is comparable to half the period of spin fluctuation ( figs . 5(b ) and ( c ) ) , a hole can move without the energy cost of spin frustration .",
    "this motion can occur successively and coherently , as a resonant charge motion , if , and only if , the charge energy @xmath10 is comparable to that of spin fluctuations @xmath44 . for nodal charges propagating in the diagonal direction ,",
    "this mechanism is irrelevant , since such holes are moving on the same spin sublattice ( see fig .",
    "5(d ) ) .",
    "the propagation of antinodal charges in this process , assisted by and resonating with spin fluctuations , reminds the author of a car or taxi going through synchronized traffic lights . on several avenues in manhattan alternation of traffic lights",
    "are matched with the velocity of cars .",
    "for example , on fifth avenue ( fig .",
    "5(e ) purple line ) or amsterdam avenue , a car can travel the entire route without being stopped more than a few times . here",
    "the `` red '' traffic light corresponds to the energy cost due to spin frustration or spin selction rules .",
    "thus , we shall term this spin - assisted charge motion as `` traffic light resonance . ''",
    "analogous to the charge motion in a usual metal which causes lattice deformation via electron - phonon coupling , motion of antinodal charges has to be accompanied by the cooperating spin fluctuations .",
    "this spin fluctuation can assist motion of another charge with opposite momentum , resulting in an attractive interaction via scattering process as illustrated in fig .",
    "since the charge energy scale @xmath10 is comparable to the energy of mediating bosons ( spin fluctuations ) @xmath44 , this spin - mediated pairing is not retarded , and one can expect a large attractive interaction .",
    "this mechanism , occuring selectively for antinodal carriers , is a good candidate for the origin of pseudo - gap formation .",
    "static magnetic order , as frozen traffic lights , inhibits charge motion and pairing .",
    "this picture for cuprates , with charges dynamically avoiding spin obstacles in cooperation with spin fluctuations , may be generalized to most other correlated electron systems , such as heavy - fermion systems , where the `` correlation '' originates from spin frustration and/or spin selection rules . in this picture",
    ", the `` glue '' includes all the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations , with energies extending from the spin gap energy to @xmath42 .",
    "carriers near the fermi surface couple with high - energy antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations as @xmath45 .",
    "all the `` paramagnon''-like fluctuations , supported by the short - ranged temporal spin - charge correlations , help superconducting coupling as their glues .",
    "thus , the `` competing magnetic states '' cooperate with superconducting states , supplying the system with useful inelastic fluctuations .",
    "overdoping with @xmath46 , however , no longer helps superconductivity , since excessively high - energy charges can not find their spin partners .",
    "for many years , theories for cuprates have been discussed in two different approaches . starting from the parent mott insulator and underdoped region , which we might call the `` left wing '' of the phase diagram , one finds relevance to mott insulator , strong coupling , pre - formed pairs , pseudo - gap , and",
    "be condensation . in these concepts",
    ", @xmath5 is related to the particle density , @xmath3 , @xmath27 and @xmath10 , since pairs are already formed well above the condensation temperature .",
    "most of the arguments in the present paper belong to this `` left - wing '' approach .",
    "the other ( `` traditional '' or `` right wing '' ) approach starts from the overdoped region , involving the concepts of fermi liquid , bcs condensation , weak coupling , etc . , and treating spin fluctuations as perturbations . in the `` right - wing '' approach , @xmath5 is related to the energy scales of `` glues '' and attractive interactions , since @xmath5 implies the pair - formation temperature .",
    "perhaps a representative work of this latter approach is the spin - fluctuation theory and flex approximation by moriya and ueda @xcite . identifying spin fluctuations as the mediating bosons in the `` right - wing '' approach , they generated the plot shown in fig .",
    "this figure should be compared and contrasted with the @xmath5 versus @xmath10 plot of fig .",
    "2(b ) which represents the `` left - wing '' phenomenology .",
    "we notice that the energy scale @xmath47 is very close to @xmath10 estimated from the superfluid density in cuprates and several other correlated - electron superconductors which have relatively high ratios of @xmath28",
    ". for pairing mechanisms based on the `` traffic light resonance , '' one requires @xmath10 to be comparable to @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , this mechanism naturally leads to `` reconciliation '' of the left- and right - wing approaches and provides reasoning for why figs .",
    "2(b ) and 2(c ) look alike for some cuprate and heavy fermion systems . on the other hand",
    ", it should also be noted that models developed from the `` right wing '' approach do not explain correlations between @xmath5 and @xmath3 in the underdoped region shown in fig .",
    "another apparent duality can be found in the role of competing magnetic states on superconductivity .",
    "the soft - mode argument identifies closeness to the magnetic state as a destructive factor which reduces the superconducting @xmath5 .",
    "the `` traffic light resonance , '' however , requires an inelastic excitation associated with dynamical correlations originating from the competing magnetic state .",
    "charge doping will help increase @xmath5 as shown in figs .",
    "2(a ) and ( b ) , while excessive charge doping would destroy / weaken the magnetic correlations required for pairing .",
    "this duality should be the origin of formation of the superconducting dome in phase diagrams of cuprates and several other systems .",
    "one remaining challenge for our phenomenology is to understand the origin of an apparent upper limit @xmath49 suggested by fig .",
    "better understanding of the interplays between spins and charges , the left- and right - wing approaches , superconducting and magnetic states , and be - bcs crossover would hopefully explain this trend .",
