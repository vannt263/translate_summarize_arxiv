    "every collision at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) will involve radiation of quarks and gluons .",
    "in fact , the vast majority of lhc collisions will involve nothing else ( except a few photons ) , until the quarks and gluons hadronize and decay .",
    "these pure qcd events provide a critical way both to test the standard and to search for new physics . at @xmath0 colliders ,",
    "an excellent way to characterize qcd events is with event shapes .",
    "event shapes are observables which are both infrared safe and simple enough that a trustworthy perturbation expansion can be performed .",
    "they usually involve a single scale , which guarantees that only one type of large logarithm can appear .",
    "resumming these large logarithms can then be used to get very accurate predictions .",
    "for example , thrust was calculated at nnlo  @xcite then resummed to n@xmath2ll accuracy  @xcite ( based on  @xcite ) and fit for power corrections  @xcite using soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) .",
    "together , these results provided some of the best tests of qcd , and important new physics constraints  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore natural to attempt the calculation of similar observables at hadron colliders .    at hadron colliders ,",
    "pure qcd events are significantly messier than at @xmath3 colliders . as with @xmath3",
    ", it is natural to look at event shapes which are dominated by kinematic configurations with two outgoing jets .",
    "even then , there are at least five new ingredients which must be understood : 1 ) the energy distributions in the incoming hadrons are non - perturbative , so one must integrate over different initial states weighted by parton - distribution functions .",
    "2 ) the process involves four directions of large energy flow ( the two protons and the two jets ) as opposed to two in @xmath0 ; thus , non - trivial angles are involved .",
    "3 ) the 4-parton configurations involve multiple channels ( @xmath4 @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) .",
    "4 ) there are multiple color structures for each channel which mix . and 5 )",
    "one can not get by with simple global observables ; at a hadron collider one must either cut out or suppress the contribution from the region near the beam which can not be measured .",
    "such restrictions can generate non - global logarithms which complicate the resummation  @xcite .",
    "dealing with the complication 1 ) , the pdfs , is now well - understood .",
    "following the example of drell - yan , we can integrate over the pdfs in an effective theory . an important lesson learned from the drell - yan example",
    "is that the matching scales in the effective theory should be chosen after the convolution with the pdfs rather than before .",
    "this avoids issues involving the landau pole singularity of qcd and allows for dynamical enhancement of the partonic threshold contribution to the drell - yan mass  @xcite .",
    "similar enhancements have also been seen in more complicated signals , such as direct photon  @xcite and threshold @xmath7 production  @xcite .",
    "complication 2 ) , multiple collinear directions , has been addressed using traditional threshold resummation in  @xcite and for the hard matching coefficients in scet  @xcite . in order to understand how angular dependence cancels in a physical cross section in scet , a process one step simpler than dijets",
    "was studied in  @xcite , direct photon production .",
    "direct photon involves three collinear directions .",
    "the scet factorization theorem for this case was derived in  @xcite , which required a non - trivial cancellation of various angular factors .",
    "@xmath7 production  @xcite also has multiple directions which must cancel , but the directions are associated with the top quark velocities in the heavy quark limit rather than with massless partons . in both cases ,",
    "the cancellation was demonstrated with explicit 1-loop calculations .",
    "direct photon and @xmath7 also involve pdfs and dynamical threshold enhancement as well as elements of complication 3 ) , multiple channels .",
    "complication 4 ) , multiple color structures which mix , was studied at next - to - leading order using traditional threshold resummation in  @xcite .",
    "it was also studied in scet for off - shell green s functions in  @xcite and for threshold @xmath7 production in  @xcite .",
    "the dijet case is more complicated than threshold @xmath7 because of the jet functions , the myriad channels including some with identical particles , and the necessary phase space restrictions for the soft function . in scet language , the color mixing occurs only in the evolution the hard and soft functions , with the jet function and pdf evolution being diagonal in color space .",
    "the hard function evolution is universal , and observable independent .",
    "the 1-loop wilson coefficients for all the @xmath8 partonic channels and their renormalization group evolution equations to 2-loops were recently calculated in scet in  @xcite , based on results of  @xcite .",
    "the soft function is a cross section for emission from eikonal wilson lines .",
    "these emission graphs depend critically on the observable of interest .",
    "therefore , there is a non - trivial check on the consistency of the factorization theorem that color evolution of the soft function cancels that of the hard function and its renormalization scale dependence is compensated exactly when the hard , jet and pdf evolution equations are combined .",
    "a general formulation of these constraints was presented in  @xcite , although no explicit soft function was given .",
    "a main result of this paper is to confirm that the general results of  @xcite actually hold through explicit calculation of a specific case .",
    "complication 5 ) , the observable , is a difficult one . the types of observables that will be most interesting to compute first are probably analogs of thrust .",
    "for event kinematics in which the final state looks like a pair of almost massless jets , thrust @xmath9 can be calculated from the sum of the jet masses up to higher order terms @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the masses of the two jets .",
    "jet masses are important because the jet mass distribution is singular at tree - level @xmath13 , and therefore very sensitive to qcd radiation . getting the theoretical prediction for the shape of jet mass distributions to agree with data without monte carlo tuning",
    "probably requires at least the nlo distributions and resummation beyond nll , as was demonstrated with thrust  @xcite and heavy jet mass  @xcite in the simpler @xmath3 case .",
    "to calculate jet masses , or a generalization of thrust , at hadron colliders one must deal with the complication that most of the energy in a typical event disappears down the beam pipe and is unmeasurable .",
    "simply cutting out the beam is unlikely to work , as it will generate non - global logarithms which can not be resummed .",
    "there are many ways to proceed . in a comprehensive study of",
    "hadronic event shapes  @xcite with the program caesar  @xcite , a number of suggestions were put forward .",
    "for example , global transverse thrust  @xcite uses only transverse momentum , so that particles in the beam direction do not contribute .",
    "some authors have suggested using beam functions  @xcite . ref .",
    "@xcite summarizes some of the relevant issues about observables , non - global logs and the experimental measurements .    in this paper",
    ", we will take a somewhat different approach , inspired by the practicality of dynamical threshold enhancement for the cases of drell - yan and direct photon . in these cases ,",
    "one calculates an observable in the _ machine threshold _ limit : the protons collide into the final states of interest ( a lepton pair for drell - yan , or a photon and a jet for direct photon ) plus only soft radiation .",
    "that is , there is no outgoing collinear field in the direction of the beam .",
    "although the physical regime of interest looks nothing like this  there is a beam with a lot of energy ",
    "resummation still seems to be quantitatively extremely useful in the physical regime when extrapolated away from the machine threshold .",
    "this phenomenological observation is partially understood : the logarithms of the partonic threshold variable which should be small well away from the machine threshold are enhanced by a factor related to the die - off of the pdfs near @xmath14  @xcite . to be clear ,",
    "we will not attempt to demonstrate threshold enhancement for hadronic event shapes here . instead , we simply observe that the threshold region is physically motivated , and use it to clarify some of the relevant issues in scet .    with these motivations",
    ", we will begin in this paper by studying an observable we call threshold thrust , which is simply the hadronic generalization of thrust in @xmath0 events .",
    "it can be defined exactly as regular thrust , but the factorization theorem will only apply near the machine threshold , where the protons annihilate into two jets and soft radiation only . the threshold thrust distribution we define and calculate in this paper is observable , and should agree with experiment near threshold .",
    "unfortunately , there will not be any data anywhere close to the machine threshold , due to the die off of the pdfs near @xmath15 .",
    "thus , the observable will need to be modified so that the large logarithms we resum will still dominate in the physical regime .",
    "nevertheless , threshold thrust demonstrates a number of new features relevant for any hadronic event shape and lets us check the general expression for the color mixing rge presented in  @xcite .",
    "since threshold thrust has no parameters , such as a jet size @xmath16 , it can be thought of as an immaculate toy model , perfect for studying factorization in a purely hadronic environment .    after establishing and checking that threshold thrust",
    "has the expected properties , we propose a related observable , asymmetric thrust , which is more likely to be important phenomenologically . near threshold ,",
    "threshold thrust can be computed , up to power corrections , by separating the event into two hemispheres and adding the hemisphere masses .",
    "asymmetric thrust is defined by , instead of taking two equally - sized hemisphere jets , we take one jet to have size @xmath16 , and the other jet to be everything else in the event . threshold thrust is not expected to be useful away from threshold because when the beam remnants have large energy , their contribution will significantly affect hemisphere masses . for asymmetric thrust ,",
    "the beam remnants both contribute to the same jet , and so their contributions largely cancel .",
    "asymmetric thrust also satisfies a number of properties which we expect observables undergoing dynamical threshold enhancement to have , as described in section  [ sec : dynamic ] .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : general ]",
    ", we set up the calculation of hadronic events shapes in scet .",
    "a number of features are universal and apply to any hadronic dijet event shape .",
    "these universal features include the 1-loop wilson coefficients for the hard function their renormalization - group evolution equations .",
    "we also summarize known results on inclusive jet functions and pdfs in scet language , since they apply to many observables . finally , the parts of the soft function rge which are off - diagonal in color space are universal , since they must cancel the hard evolution , so we include a discussion of these as well .",
    "next , we introduce threshold thrust , in section  [ sec : tt ] .",
    "section  [ sec : soft ] calculates explicitly the 1-loop soft function for this observable . while soft function integrals are observable dependent , the color factors for emission from an eikonal line are universal .",
    "the way the color factors combine with the momentum - integrals to reproduce the color structures in the hard function is non - trivial .",
    "so , this calculation demonstrates the kinds of calculations we expect to occur in other hadronic event shapes . in section  [ ttfinal ] ,",
    "we combine the ingredients into a closed - form expression for threshold thrust which can be evaluated numerically . in section  [ sec : dynamic ] we discuss how to go away from the machine threshold .",
    "we review previous examples and catalog some lessons learned , extracting some general principles for threshold enhancement .",
    "this leads to the proposal of asymmetric thrust , which is only briefly mentioned , and will be the subject of future work .",
    "conclusions are in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "in this section , we describe elements of hadronic event shape calculations which are universal , postponing until section  [ sec : tt ] an actual event shape definition and event - shape specific results .",
    "this section is essentially a summary of results derived in  @xcite and can be skipped if the reader is already familiar with the contents of that paper .    in soft - collinear effective theory ,",
    "a cross section is calculated by expanding around a threshold limit .",
    "we define _ hadronic dijet event shapes _ as observables which force that , at the exact threshold , the incoming and outgoing partons have massless 4-momenta and that there is no phase space left for soft radiation . at threshold ,",
    "only massless @xmath17 scattering in qcd contributes , which includes the @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 channels and their various crossings .",
    "going slightly away from threshold allows the partons to become jets and for soft radiation to be produced .",
    "when the jets have masses much smaller than their energies @xmath21 and the soft radiation has energy of order @xmath22 , the cross section factorizes into a convolution of different components which are calculable separately in the effective theory . for these event shapes",
    ", the cross section will factorize into a form which generically looks like @xmath23 here , @xmath24 is the hard function , @xmath25 is a soft function , and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are , respectively , jet functions and parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) .",
    "@xmath28 is the differential phase space and @xmath29 reminds us to average over initial states . @xmath30 and @xmath31 are color indices which only affect the hard and soft functions , since the jet functions and pdfs are color diagonal .",
    "all the functions in this equation have an implicit channel index , which we suppress for clarity . in the threshold limit",
    ", one can show using scet that the channels do not interfere and the cross section for each channel can simply be added together  @xcite .",
    "the first step in an scet calculation is to match qcd to scet .",
    "this means calculating wilson coefficients for scet operators so that amplitudes in qcd are reproduced at the scale @xmath32 order - by - order in perturbation theory .",
    "for example , one of the scet operators relevant for @xmath33 is @xmath34 here , @xmath35 projects out the left - handed quarks while the gluon helicities are chosen explicitly to be @xmath36 and @xmath37 and so this operator describes the helicity subprocess @xmath38 .",
    "the part of the operator in the left brackets comprises quark jets @xmath39 and gluon jets @xmath40 , which are collinear quarks and gluons plus associated collinear wilson lines .",
    "the right part of this operator comprises soft wilson lines @xmath41 and @xmath42 , in the fundamental and adjoint representations , respectively .",
    "the soft part is independent of spin .",
    "@xmath43 are color indices for the fundamental representation of @xmath44 and @xmath45 are adjoint color indices . for this @xmath46 channel ,",
    "there are 3 color structures and 8 spin choices , although many of the wilson coefficients for these 24 operators are the same .",
    "there are additional operators for the crossed channels , such as @xmath47 , whose wilson coefficients can be computed from those of @xmath46 via crossing relations . for @xmath48 and its crossings",
    "there are 2 color structures , and for @xmath49 there are 8 color structures .",
    "special care is required in computing the wilson coefficients for @xmath50 when @xmath51 and @xmath52 are identical particles .",

    "in addition , while the results of  @xcite are derived by computing the virtual contributions to the renormalization of soft wilson lines with a collinear subtraction , the @xmath66 matrices in  @xcite are calculated simply from virtual graphs in full qcd .",

    "these pdfs are non - perturbative , but their renormalization group evolution equations , the dglap equations , are perturbative and known to 3-loops . in general , the evolution mixes all the different parton species .",

    "the soft function in a hadronic event shape calculation depends on the definition of the event shape and must be calculated for each observable separately .",
    "however , a number of features of these soft functions are universal , and will apply for any observable . because the renormalization group evolution is color diagonal for the jet functions and pdfs , the color - mixing terms in the soft function evolution must exactly compensate the color - mixing terms in the hard function evolution .",

    "here , we review those general results for completeness",

    "an explicit example for @xmath112 will be given when we define the observable .",
    "no matter what the observable is , the soft function can only depend on directions @xmath113 of the various wilson lines , and on arbitrary soft scales relevant to the projections .",

    "in contrast , the energy of the final state jet cancels out at an intermediate stage of the calculation , and only reappears through the matching scales .    for dijet events , we can write the final state as @xmath324 .",

    "the hemisphere axis is sensitive to the boost of the event , while the direction of the jet in direct photon is not . if the direction label on the jet changes , the matching coefficients should change too",
    "so , there is no reason to expect the threshold thrust calculation to be relevant in the physical regime .",
    "suppose we try to modify the definition of the observable so that its direction is stable away from threshold .",

    "for example , there could be other hard jets in the event .",
    "thus , while the observable is good away from threshold , it is not useful _ at _ threshold .    in summary , there appear to be two general principles which an observable should satisfy for dynamical threshold enhancement to work .",
    "we would like to have a single definition of the observable which can be applied both at threshold and away from threshold so that    1 .",
    "the direction of the final state jets is the same at the parton and hadron levels .",
    "[ itemone ] 2 .",
    "the vanishing of the observable implies the kinematics associated with the factorization theorem .",
    "[ itemtwo ]    in the case of hadronic dijet event shapes , the second point means that only @xmath8 processes should contribute when the observable is exactly at threshold . for drell - yan ,",
    "both of these criteria hold : there are no final state jets , and when @xmath326 , the remaining radiation must be soft . for direct photon ,",
    "these criteria hold : the jet defined as the everything - but - the - photon is always back - to - back with the photon , and @xmath327 forces the jet to be massless and the remaining radiation to be soft .",
    "threshold thrust satisfies the second condition but fails the first because the beam remnants change the jet direction .",
    "in addition , to avoid complications involving non - global logs    1 .   the observable should be global.[itemthree ]    this means all hadrons in the event should contribute to the observable  @xcite . for direct photon and drell - yan ,",
    "the observables are the photon 4-momentum or lepton pair 4-momentum respectively , which seem clearly not to be global since they do not involve the hadrons at all . however , in direct photon , what is actually calculated in scet is the mass of everything - but - the - photon , @xmath152 , which is global . in drell - yan , one can also rephrase the calculation as being of the mass of everything but the lepton pair , @xmath328 , which is global as well . for threshold thrust , @xmath329 , which is also global .",
    "this is not to say that observables which are non - global must have non - global logarithms , or that non - global logarithms can not be resummed .",
    "moreover , there are additional subtleties within the class of global observables , such as whether they are directly or continuously global  @xcite .",
    "so it makes sense to start in scet by studying event shapes which are as global as possible , so that all the large logarithms will be threshold logs .",
    "now let us consider some modifications of threshold thrust .",
    "first , take the example mentioned above , the sum of the squares of the masses of the two hardest jets of size @xmath16 , @xmath330 .",
    "it will satisfy condition  [ itemone ] but not condition  [ itemtwo ] .",
    "even though the jets are forced to be massless when @xmath331 , the radiation outside the jets is not forced to vanish by @xmath332 alone .",
    "the variable @xmath333 , discussed in  @xcite and  @xcite has the the opposite problem . in this case",
    ", @xmath334 does force the radiation outside the jets to vanish , however , the jets are not forced to be massless .",
    "they can have masses as large as @xmath335 .",
    "although this observable may be interesting , resumming logs of the jet masses can not be done without also resumming logs of @xmath16 . if @xmath16 is as large as a hemisphere , then @xmath336 exactly , so there is nothing to calculate . a related observable , suggested by  @xcite and studied in  @xcite",
    "is @xmath337 .",
    "when this observable is at threshold , @xmath338 , the final state is forced to have two massless jets and no out of jet radiation .",
    "it satisfies both criteria  [ itemone ] and  [ itemtwo ] , and therefore we expect it to undergo dynamical threshold enhancement .",
    "however , it is not global : because the jets have size @xmath16 , only the radiation within the jets contributes to the value of @xmath339 . unlike direct photon or drell - yan ,",
    "the mass of everything not in the jets is also non - global beacuse it excludes the hadrons in the jets .",
    "thus , when attempting nnll resummation , there may be non - global logs in @xmath340 of the same order as the logs which are resummed .    finally , consider the following modification of threshold thrust . instead of taking two hemispheres ,",
    "one finds the hardest jet of size @xmath16 ( using whatever algorithm one wants ) .",
    "then the radiation in the event is divided into radiation in the jet , which is summed into a momentum 4-vector @xmath341 and out of the jet , which is summed into @xmath342 .",
    "then one computes the asymmetric thrust @xmath343 \\,.\\ ] ] this will allow us to resum logarithms of the @xmath1 of the jet , which can be compared to data and should undergo threshold enhancement .",
    "the exact @xmath16-dependence can be included through careful matching to a fixed order calculation .    for @xmath16 the size of a hemisphere ,",
    "this observable is just threshold thrust .",
    "for @xmath16 small enough so that neither beam is included in the jet , this observable will satisfy condition  [ itemone ] .",
    "in fact , if @xmath16 is calculated as a distance in @xmath344 space , the beams will never be included in a jet since they are at @xmath345 .",
    "condition  [ itemtwo ] is satisfied as well .",
    "when @xmath327 , both the jet mass @xmath346 and the mass - of - everything - else @xmath347 are forced to vanish .",
    "the initial state radiation must also be soft , for the same reason as for threshold thrust .",
    "thus , at threshold , only @xmath8 scattering contributes , as desired .",
    "finally , the observable is global , so there are no dangerous non - global logs to worry about .",
    "in this paper , we have presented the first computation of a hadronic event shape in pure qcd events to next - to - next - to - leading logarithmic accuracy .",
    "this calculation of this observable , which we call threshold thrust , involves understanding a number of issues which were not present in previous work .",
    "the hadronic event shapes we have been concerned with here are dominated by dijet configurations . in the singular limit , at threshold ,",
    "only @xmath17 scattering contributes , but there are many channels and many color structures in each channel .",
    "the evolution in color space is complicated , but has a number of simplifying features . in particular",
    ", there is a color basis in which the evolution is diagonal .",
    "the evolution of the hard functions was studied previously in  @xcite , and constraints on the rg evolution for the soft function were derived . here ,",
    "we have computed the soft function for threshold thrust explicitly to 1-loop .",
    "this both confirms the general expectations from  @xcite , and provides the nlo finite parts of the soft function necessary for nnll resummation .    although threshold thrust is infrared safe and observable in principle , the large logarithmic contributions to it which the scet calculation provides are unlikely to have a significant effect in the physically relevant kinematic region .",
    "the threshold where the calculation is valid has @xmath348 for both hadrons , so that the hadron momenta and the hard scattering parton momenta approach each other .",
    "it is not unusual for the threshold logarithms to be important away from threshold .",
    "in fact , for related processes , such as drell - yan and direct photon production , this is known to happen due to dynamical threshold enhancement .",
    "we isolate two features of observables which are likely to be important for dynamical threshold enhancement to occur : 1 ) the jets in the observable should have the same directions at the hadron and parton levels and 2 ) the observable should force the kinematics of the factorization theorem .",
    "in addition , to avoid non - global logs , 3 ) the observable should be sensitive to radiation everywhere .",
    "we defined an alternative to threshold thrust , asymmetric thrust , which satisfies these criteria .",
    "while threshold thrust is the sum the masses - squared of hemisphere jets , asymmetric thrust sums the masses - squared of a jet and everything - but - the - jet .",
    "the critical feature of this modification is that both beams end up in one side , so their contributions to the threshold observable largely cancel",
    ". it will be interesting to study the phenomenology of asymmetric thrust , which , after matching to the exact nlo distribution , should allow us to compute the jet @xmath1 spectrum at nnll+nlo accuracy .",
    "many of the results and lessons from this paper will help us understand more general hadronic event shapes . while the @xmath1 of a jet in dijet events is an important observable",
    ", there are many other observables which one could compute using the same @xmath17 hard kinematics which would provide complimentary tests of qcd .",
    "some of the global observables discussed in  @xcite , or 2-jettiness which has been proposed using scet  @xcite , may be calculable at nnll using the results of this paper and of  @xcite without too much more work .",
    "there are also many interesting non - global observables which can be studied and measured using the same dijet sample .",
    "for example , it would be nice to calculate the mass of a jet in dijet events .",
    "studies in @xmath3 collisions of thrust  @xcite , which is the sum of jet masses , and the related heavy jet mass  @xcite , have shown clearly that resummation at nnll and beyond is critical to getting some shapes correct . because of the beam remnants , a jet mass distribution at hadron colliders requires a less inclusive jet definition than at @xmath3 colliders .",
    "much progress has already been made studying exclusive jet definitions in scet  @xcite , and phenomenological applications at hadron colliders are surely just around the corner .",
    "however , to go to nnll requires an understanding of not only non - global logs in scet , but also of super - leading logs  @xcite , which arise as violations of color coherence in processes with at least four hard colored particles , such as the dijet configurations we have been studying . it will be interesting to see if scet can provide a consistent framework for resummation and precision calculations of general non - global observables at hadron colliders .",
    "we would like to thank thomas becher and gavin salam for helpful discussions .",
    "our research is supported in part by the department of energy under grant de - sc003916 .",
    "the calculation of the soft function involves taking matrix elements of wilson lines . to order @xmath61 in dimensional regularization",
    "only the real emission diagrams contribute .",
    "these can be drawn as cut graphs , as in figure  [ fig : soft ] .",
    "there are contributions where the gluon comes out of the @xmath238 leg and is absorbed into the @xmath239 leg , where @xmath238 and @xmath239 are any of @xmath349 or @xmath350 . since the graphs with @xmath351 vanish , there are 6 possibilities .",
    "the calculation can be split into two parts : calculation of the integrals , which we call @xmath222 , and calculation of the color factors , which we call @xmath223 .",
    "the result can then be written as @xmath352 the notation @xmath249 and @xmath353 indicates to permute the @xmath226 and @xmath227 indices in the color factor , @xmath354 , with respect to the integral , @xmath222 , for the appropriate crossing .",
    "the crossings and permutations are listed in tables  [ tab : perm1 ] and [ tab : perm2 ] .",
    "we work in @xmath231 dimensions with @xmath355 subtraction throughout .",
    "the master integral for the soft function is @xmath356 where @xmath238 and @xmath239 are the directions of the two wilson lines where the gluon attaches , which can be any of @xmath357 , @xmath358 , @xmath359 or @xmath350 , as in figure  [ fig : soft ] .",
    "thus , there are six different integrals to be done . as discussed in the text",
    ", the integrals can only depend on one lorentz invariant ratio @xmath360 which greatly simplifies the calculations .    at order @xmath61",
    "the soft gluon can either go into the hemisphere containing wilson line @xmath191 , or wilson line @xmath192 .",

    "we now proceed to calculate the 6 dimensionless integrals @xmath365 .",
    "the integrals are easiest to do in a basis where the @xmath366 and @xmath367 functions are easy to integrate , which means choosing lightlike coordinates along the @xmath191 and @xmath192 axis .",
    "so we write @xmath368 in this basis the measure , including the @xmath366 and @xmath367 functions , becomes @xmath369 where @xmath370 and @xmath371 and @xmath372 is the angle between @xmath373 and @xmath374 .",
    "then , @xmath375 the inner products that appear in the denominator are , in this basis , @xmath376 since @xmath377 , the angle between @xmath373 and @xmath378 is @xmath379 thus changing the sign of the @xmath380 term in the expression for @xmath381 .",
    "the terms @xmath382 arise in the center of mass frame where @xmath383 since @xmath384 there are 6 ways to choose two of the four directions for @xmath238 and @xmath239 , with @xmath385 .",

    "<S> hadronic event shapes , that is , event shapes at hadron colliders , could provide a great way to test both standard and non - standard theoretical models . however , they are significantly more complicated than event shapes at @xmath0 colliders , involving multiple hard directions , multiple channels and multiple color structures . in this paper , </S>",
    "<S> hadronic event shapes are examined with soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) by expanding around the dijet limit . </S>",
    "<S> a simple event shape , threshold thrust , is defined . </S>",
    "<S> this observable is global and has no free parameters , making it ideal for clarifying how resummation of hadronic event shapes can be done in scet . </S>",
    "<S> threshold thrust is calculated at next - to - leading fixed order ( nlo ) in scet and resummed to next - to - next - to - leading logarithmic accuracy ( nnll ) . </S>",
    "<S> the scale - dependent parts of the soft function are shown to agree with what is expected from general observations , and the factorization formula is explicitly shown to be renormalization group invariant to 1-loop . although threshold thrust is not itself expected to be phenomenologically interesting , it can be modified into a related observable which allows the jet @xmath1 distribution to be calculated and resummed to nnll+nlo accuracy . as in other processes , one expects resummation to be important even for moderate jet momenta due to dynamical threshold enhancement . a general discussion of threshold enhancement and non - global logs in hadronic event shapes </S>",
