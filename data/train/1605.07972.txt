    "light does not interact with light in everyday life .",
    "this interaction can only be induced by means of nonlinear physical systems and is only observable with strong enough electromagnetic fields .",
    "it is hardly possible to achieve such strong fields using incoherent light sources , so the research in nonlinear optics commenced with the advent of high power light sources , namely the invention of lasers .",
    "powerful pulsed lasers are often needed to observe nonlinear optical phenomena in bulk materials .",
    "methods involving optical fibers @xcite , plasmons @xcite , hollow - core photonic crystal fibers @xcite , as well as metameterials @xcite allow reducing the light power requirement .",
    "this reduction is still insufficient for many applications where it is desirable to achieve a strong nonlinear response with faint light , ultimately at a few- or single - photon level .",
    "large nonlinear optical susceptibility is needed to observe nonlinear interactions at low light levels .",
    "there are two major ways of producing such a susceptibility : i ) usage of a resonant , either natural or artificial , nonlinear media , and ii ) usage of nonresonant but highly transparent nonlinear media embedded into optical cavities .",
    "each of these approaches has its own advantages and disadvantages , and each should be evaluated in the context of the particular problem to be solved . in this contribution",
    "we focus on the second approach and discuss applications of monolithic optical microresonators in quantum and nonlinear optics .    since their inception , monolithic microresonators became tools of nonlinear optics .",
    "their major use is in the enhancement of the efficiency of nonlinear interactions occurring in transparent optical media . unlike other types of optical cavities",
    ", monolithic ones can be integrated on a chip and multiplexed , which makes them indispensable in creation of chip - scale nonlinear optical devices able to generate optical harmonics , produce nonclassical states of light , process quantum information and so on .",
    "these resonators allow not only reducing the footprint of nonlinear optics experiments and moving them from the lab to industrial applications , but also facilitate nonlinear interaction at the single - photon level , representing one of the major goals of optical science nowadays .",
    "the merit of a nonlinear optical system is often judged with respect to its optical attenuation introducing unwanted optical loss and decoherence .",
    "resonant nonlinear media , such as atoms or plasmons , may have huge optical nonlinearity in a relatively narrow frequency band enabling interaction among single photons .",
    "however , the attenuation is also resonantly enhanced .",
    "nonresonant nonlinear media , on the contrary , typically have relatively small optical nonlinearity , but also very small attenuation . as the result , photons confined in such a media for a long time have a better chance to interact without being absorbed . to support such a long interaction time optical cavities are utilized .",
    "cavity enhancement of the nonlinear interaction depends on the quality factor @xmath0 and mode volume @xmath1 of the cavity .",
    "the quality factor defines the interaction time , while the mode volume characterizes the magnitude of the electric field of the confined photons .",
    "the smaller the cavity and the larger the quality factor , the stronger is the interaction .",
    "it is hard to reach the desirable values of both parameters at the same time .",
    "usually , reduction of mode volume results in a decrease of the quality factor . for instance , the mode volume as small as @xmath2 ( where @xmath3 is wavelength and @xmath4 is the refractive index of the cavity host material ) was achieved in photonic bandgap nanocavities @xcite , but quality factor does not exceed @xmath5 .",
    "numerical optimization of the cavity shape show that q - factor of a photonic bandgap cavity can reach @xmath6 @xcite if the fabricated cavity has ideal quality , but further increase is unlikely .",
    "this limitation arises from fundamental as well as from technical reasons .",
    "the confinement of light within a dielectric structure is reduced as the structure becomes smaller , while the tolerances of fabrication of such a structure become more stringent .",
    "it is possible to imagine a 3d photonic crystal nanocavity with a subwavelength mode volume , but fabrication of the cavity is out of reach of the existing technology .    whispering gallery mode resonators ( wgmrs ) @xcite , on the other hand , allow achieving three to four orders of magnitude higher quality factors at the expense of increased mode volumes . since enhancement of the nonlinear conversion efficiency is usually proportional to @xmath7 or @xmath8 , it may be reasonable to trade the small mode volume for larger @xmath0-factor .",
    "on the other hand , higher @xmath0 results in narrower linewidth and consequently in slower devices , so an optimization is usually needed .",
    "another salient advantage of wgmrs is related to efficient coupling techniques developed for the resonators , which are extremely important in all the applications .    here",
    "we review recent progress in both nonlinear and quantum optics applications of wgmrs characterized with relatively small ( @xmath9 ) mode volumes and ultra - high @xmath0-factors ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "these resonators have been widely utilized for efficiency enhancement of nonlinear optical processes such as three- and four - wave mixing , and also for observation of quantum effects associated with these processes .",
    "long interaction time together with strong spatial confinement of light in nonlinear resonators result in a significant decrease of the thresholds of both lasing and stimulated scattering processes .",
    "resonators made from optical crystals are excellent candidates for observation of broadband nonlinear optical phenomena , since these materials are highly transparent in the wavelength range of 150  nm to 10  @xmath11 m",
    ". finesse of these resonators can be very large .",
    "the highest demonstrated finesse in optics ( @xmath12 ) has been achieved with a fluorite ( caf@xmath13 ) resonator @xcite .",
    "the spectral properties of wgm resonators are well understood nowadays , and many means of design and control of wgm spectra are known ( see sections [ sec : spectrum ] and [ sec : tuning ] ) .",
    "there are also many efficient techniques for coupling light in and out of these structures ( see section [ sec : spectrum ] ) .",
    "as all spatially extended systems , wgm resonators require phase matching for nonlinear interactions to be efficient .",
    "phase matching in rotation - symmetric geometry , however , is very different from that in cartesian geometry , and allows for greater flexibility .",
    "this topic is discussed in sections [ sec : chi2 ] and [ sec : third - order ] for the second- and third - order nonlinear - optical processes , respectively .",
    "interaction of optical photons with solid - state excitations such as phonons is discussed in section [ sec : other ] .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : quant ] we review quantum - optical phenomena accessible with monolithic microresonators . in the rest of this section , we briefly review the history and distinctive properties of wgm resonators .",
    "the first observation of a whispering gallery has faded from memory . in the realm of acoustics",
    "a smooth and circular wall features the characteristic that a soft spoken whisper can propagate along the wall to be heard by a listener far away from the source but close to the wall .",
    "examples include the gol gumbaz in india , the temple of heaven in beijing , and the st .",
    "paul cathedral in london .",
    "it was in london that lord rayleigh first described the phenomenon scientifically @xcite , noting that the spherical wall reflects and continuously refocuses the sound wave and thus a whispering gallery is formed .",
    "an experimental observation of this effect was reported by raman @xcite .",
    "this concept of confining waves in the vicinity of a curved boundary was soon demonstrated in the scattering of electromagnetic radiation from gold spheres , which led to the establishment of mie scattering theory @xcite .",
    "it was furthermore found to be applicable to dielectric interfaces , which was important for understanding radar scattering from rain and hail .",
    "debye simplified the underlying mathematical description @xcite and applied it to the waves propagating along dielectric wires .",
    "for the next decades whispering gallery modes were only occasionally studied , such as by richtmyer who considered dielectric wires bent into loops , i.e. ring resonators @xcite .",
    "one of the first solid state optical lasers was implemented in in a samarium doped fluorite sphere @xcite . on a much different length scale , the earth troposphere and ionosphere can act as a closed waveguide supporting modes similar to wgms @xcite .",
    "the wgm concept was picked up again in the 1980s and developed in two different directions comprising the study of properties of liquid droplets @xcite in the optical domain , and properties of properly shaped pieces of high permittivity dielectrics @xcite in the microwave domain .",
    "let us discuss these directions in some more detail .",
    "microwave wgm resonators were studied in parallel with the optical ones .",
    "spherical @xcite , cylindrical @xcite , and more complex resonator morphologies @xcite were considered . while there is no fundamental difference between the optical and microwave structures ,",
    "they are practically dissimilar because of i ) the nature of attenuation in the resonator host material , and ii ) the wgm excitation techniques .    the maximum achievable @xmath0 factor of a microwave structure is determined by the dielectric loss tangent defined as @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the complex permittivity of the material .",
    "typically the loss tangent increases with microwave frequency @xcite . as a result",
    ", the product @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the frequency of the microwaves , is considered as a constant .",
    "it means that available @xmath0-factors are not very large at high microwave frequencies .",
    "for instance , the highest @xmath0-factor attainable at @xmath18 ghz in a sapphire resonator at room temperature is @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "this number can be improved to @xmath20 and possibly further at cryogenic temperatures @xcite .    since the wgm quality factors are rather large compared to the quality factors of other types of dielectric structures , the microwave wgm resonators found use as filters @xcite .",
    "they also are utilized as energy storage elements in ultra - stable microwave oscillators producing spectrally pure signals @xcite . as a benchmark , a 9  ghz oscillator with phase noise of @xmath21 dbc@xmath22hz at 1  khz offset frequency",
    "was demonstrated using microwave wgms @xcite .",
    "these oscillators are widely used .",
    "for instance , they were proposed for the tests of local lorentz invariance by searching the difference in the speed of light in the directions parallel and perpendicular to the direction of the earth motion around the sun @xcite .",
    "another application of the high-@xmath0 structures is related to the study of weak attenuation of microwaves in nominally transparent materials @xcite and the material permitivity @xcite .",
    "a variety of nonlinear microwave phenomena can also be observed in wgm resonators @xcite .",
    "the evanescent field of a microwave dielectric resonator may extend by as much as a millimeter .",
    "it means that a metallic antenna can be used to excite the wgms @xcite . for high radio frequency ( rf ) and thz radiation @xcite , the excitation can be realized using dielectric @xcite or metal waveguides .",
    "low order modes in the dielectric cavities are coupled to the free space and have significant radiative losses which allows applications of the structure as dielectric rf antennas @xcite .",
    "the requirement for a smooth resonator surface is much more stringent in optical than in the microwave domain .",
    "one approach to form a nearly perfect interface and reduce the scattering from the boundary roughness is offered by surface tension .",
    "that is why wgms have been initially studied in liquid droplets either caught in optical or ion - traps @xcite or planted onto hydrophobic surfaces @xcite .",
    "their @xmath0-factors were of the order of @xmath23 , thus stimulated phenomena such as raman lasing was readily observed @xcite .",
    "conventional lasing was achieved as well by including dyes such as rhodamine 6 g @xcite or quantum dots @xcite into the solution .",
    "surface tension also defines shape and surface quality of microsphere resonators created by thermal reflow of glass . in 1989 , braginsky and co - workers @xcite",
    "were the first to realize that nearly perfect spheres can be formed by melting high - grade silica glass fibers .",
    "the potential of wgm resonators in quantum optics was emphasized already in this pioneering research : _  with possible reduction of controlling energy of optical switching down to a single quantum and employment of the monophotonic states of light , the whispering - gallery microresonators can open the way to realize feynman s quantum - mechanical computer . \" _",
    "these microspheres are by now quarter - century old , and although they could not so far reach the parameters required to operate as quantum computer nodes , they allow observing essentially quantum effects .",
    "for instance , cavity qed experiments were performed with microspheres doped with nanoparticles @xcite .",
    "the resonators also find such applications as single virus detection @xcite and , by including rare earth dopants into the glass , lasing @xcite .",
    "vahala and co - workers managed to combine the benefits of surface tension induced smoothness and lithographic production by creating micro - toroids out of silica on silicon @xcite .",
    "these resonators showed an interaction of their optical wgms and mechanical resonances via the radiation pressure @xcite .",
    "such opto - mechanical coupling allowed for cooling of a single _ mechanical _ mode of an optical wgm resonator close to the quantum - mechanical ground state @xcite .",
    "toroidal fused silica cavities were used to achieve frequency comb generation @xcite , and very recently , to demonstrate the octave - wide comb operation @xcite .",
    "along the same line is the fabrication of a different kind of resonator , the bottle resonator @xcite .",
    "these resonators are shaped by compressing a locally molten silica fiber in the axial direction , similarly to the first microtoroids @xcite .",
    "the large tunability and potentially very large mode volume of bottle resonators make them interesting for coupling to atomic transitions @xcite .",
    "efficient nonlinear switching , envisioned for microspheres @xcite , was successfully demonstrated in bottle - shaped fused silica microresonators @xcite .    if a capillary is used instead of a fiber , hollow bottles or microbubble resonators @xcite can be created .",
    "they show promise for chemical sensing applications .",
    "note that the whispering gallery _ waveguides _ realized as straight ( unstructured ) capillaries also have been used for this purpose @xcite .",
    "heating fibers by a co@xmath13 laser can be utilized for fabrication of surface nanoscale axial photonics ( snap ) resonators @xcite featuring sub - atomic precision of the surface profile control .",
    "the snap technology makes use of the frozen stress in the fiber , which , when locally heated , results into nanoscale deformation .",
    "laser fabrication can be also applied to larger silica rods , yielding the resonators used for high quality frequency combs generation @xcite .",
    "precise shaping of optical rods can furthermore allow for experimental verification of interesting and counter - intuitive behaviors of wgm light which can form quasi - modes even in open systems @xcite .",
    "crystalline materials with very low absorption can only be formed into high quality wgm resonators by mechnical polishing .",
    "one of the first solid state lasers reported in 1961 was a doped caf@xmath13:sm@xmath24 crystal sphere @xcite .",
    "record quality factors of over @xmath25 have been achieved in undoped fluorite resonators @xcite .",
    "these resonators also feature frequency combs @xcite and opto - mechanical interaction @xcite .",
    "another important aspect of crystalline materials is that they can be anisotropic and therefore support second order nonlinearities , paving the way for applications in quantum optics @xcite should be read as @xmath26 . ] and photonics @xcite .",
    "generation of optical squeezing @xcite and entanglement , coherent frequency conversion @xcite , and realization of quantum memories @xcite are all within reach to be implemented in the cavities .",
    "wgm resonators also can be useful for creation of efficient narrowband single photon sources @xcite for quantum information protocols .",
    "lithographic fabrication of crystalline resonators of nearly any geometry and any material @xcite has the benefit of mass - production , but still fails at achieving the surface qualities achieved with mechanical polishing .",
    "however with isotropic materials such as silica it was possible to achieve surface qualities en par with polishing and melting by chemical etching of wedge resonators @xcite .",
    "the flexibility in the geometry opened the whole field of asymmetric resonant cavities , demonstrating a variety of interesting dynamic behaviors such as chaos and scar - type instabilities @xcite .",
    "asymmetric resonators have been used in high power quantum cascade lasers @xcite and sub - wavelength lasers @xcite .",
    "theoretical descriptions of modal structures in deformed cavities can not be done in the framework of mie analysis , due to the non - integrability of the geometric system , leading to wave - chaotic formulations @xcite .",
    "the full interaction of such non - trivial resonance structures with non - uniform gain regions was only recently solved in the framework of a self - consistent lasing theory @xcite .",
    "besides the conventional wgm resonators that are typically small , there exist larger monolithic crystalline resonators that are also based on total internal reflection ( tir ) @xcite .",
    "they have been used for second harmonic generation @xcite and parametric down conversion @xcite . finally , low - order wgms can be observed around an irregularity in photonic bandgap crystals @xcite .      in summary ,",
    "the wgm resonators are attractive because of their    * * high @xmath0-factor .",
    "* wgm resonators that are large with respect to the wavelength of light and have high enough surface quality suffer extremely low radiative losses .",
    "depending on the resonator material they can also have low intrinsic losses . *",
    "* wide spectral range .",
    "* wgm resonators provide high-@xmath0 resonances throughout the entire transparency range of the dielectric they are made of . *",
    "* low mode volume .",
    "* wgms are localized close to the rim of the resonator and therefore have small volumes .",
    "a mode volume is conventionally introduced as the spatial integral over the field intensity normalized to the intensity maximum @xcite . *",
    "* mechanical stability .",
    "* wgm resonators are monolithic and small , and therefore suffer only minimal mechanical instabilities . *",
    "* tunable wavelength .",
    "* wgm spectrum can be engineered as well as dynamically tuned by a variety of techniques . *",
    "* variable coupling . * coupling to wgm resonators is usually achieved via frustrated tir whereby the coupling rate depends on the distance between the resonator and the evanescent coupler .",
    "this allows for a simple control over the coupling rate . * * strong nonlinear interaction * wgm resonators made out of nonlinear material allow for achieving strong nonlinear interaction at low light levels .    in the next section",
    "we formulate the mathematical description of the wgm spectrum and provide a strong footing of the special properties described above .",
    "monolithic dielectric resonators have a refractive index larger than that of their surrounding @xmath27 ( or , equivalently , the _ relative _ index of refraction @xmath28 ) and confine the light by total internal reflection ( tir ) , see fig .",
    "[ fig : wgmschematic ] . here",
    "the complex angle of incidence and , therefore , the complex wave vector corresponds to the evanescent field in the less optically dense medium .",
    "as tir only depends on the angle of incidence and the refractive indices , it is a very broad - band process .",
    "can be either partially refracted out ( if @xmath29 ) or totally internally reflected ( if @xmath30 ) . ,",
    "height=173 ]    in a resonator with geometric path length @xmath31 and constant index of refraction @xmath32 the resonant frequency follows from the argument that an integer number of wavelengths @xmath33 needs to fit into the optical path length @xmath34 : @xmath35 , or in terms of the wave number , @xmath36 .",
    "the optical path of large enough wgm resonators ( @xmath37 ) can be approximated by expression @xmath38 , were @xmath39 is the resonator radius .",
    "this expression does not take the geometric dispersion of the wgm spectrum into account .    in order to understand the nature of this dispersion and to find a more accurate approximation for wgm spectrum the helmholtz equation needs to be solved for the boundary conditions set by the resonator geometry .",
    "the physical solutions are selected by requiring the continuity and the smoothness of the tangential derivatives of the electric field at the boundary .",
    "furthermore , the so - called sommerfeld boundary conditions should be selected at infinity , limiting the solutions to outgoing fields only . under these conditions",
    "the solutions become complex , calling for some probing / external energy flow in order to excite and probe the resonances .",
    "a wgm resonator belongs to a class of the so - called open resonators .",
    "exact mathematical solution shows that modes of such a resonator include unbound spherical waves running away from the resonator .",
    "the modes are fundamentally unconfined , and defining volume of the mode is not straightforward .",
    "the problem is usually circumvented by neglecting the radiated wave part and considering the associated complex eigenvalue of the mode as radiative loss .",
    "the value of the loss is usually much smaller than the other types of attenuation .",
    "a calculation of the radiative q - factor for a @xmath40 m water droplet results in @xmath41 at @xmath42  nm @xcite . as a rule",
    ", the radiation loss can be safely neglected in any resonator with the circumference exceeding a couple dozens of wavelength and a high enough refractive index contrast with the environment .",
    "the most straightforward assumption is to consider a spherical resonator and thus introduce a spherical coordinate system .",
    "the transformation of the laplacian into spherical coordinates introduces a centrifugal potential which provides a condition for bound states @xcite .",
    "the interaction of plane waves with such bound states was studied by mie @xcite .",
    "the analysis of six independent field components arising in this study can be simplified by realizing that only two orthogonal potentials are independent @xcite .",
    "this yields two sets of solutions commonly known as the transverse ( to the equatorial plane ) electric field ( te ) and transverse magnetic filed ( tm ) polarization mode families .",
    "the main field component for each family is given by expression @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the spherical bessel function of order @xmath33 , @xmath45 are the associated legendre polynomials , or respectively , @xmath46 are the spherical harmonics @xcite .    .",
    "in the bottom row , @xmath47 . the right - hand panel shows the field cross section along the lines shown on the left - hand panel .",
    "note again that the analytical solution does not take the evanescent field into account .",
    "the numerical however does . reprinted from @xcite . ]    here a nomenclature for the different integer separation constants is at order .",
    "the spherical bessel function is an oscillating function of the radius @xmath48 , whose zeros can be numbered by the integer @xmath49 , where @xmath50 designates the fundamental wgm .",
    "the angular momentum @xmath33 describes the number of wavelengths that fit around the equator .",
    "it can also be negative , pointing to a counter clockwise rotating mode .",
    "a positive integer @xmath51 corresponds to the number of nodes in the polar direction ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : transversalmoden ] ) , indicating a transverse mode structure similar to that of a fabry - perot resonator . finding the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for modes in large resonators , where the @xmath52 is not trivial but can be made feasible by suitable approximations to the high - index bessel functions @xcite and legendre polynomials @xcite .",
    "these approximations are useful for describing spherical resonators .",
    "however many wgm resonators are better described as spheroids with the major and minor semi - axes @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively .",
    "eigenfrequencies of such resonators can be found in the so - called semi - classical limit by the eikonal method @xcite . in @xcite",
    "we find the following dispersion equation : @xmath55 where @xmath56 are the negative zeros of the airy function , and @xmath57 equals @xmath58 for te and @xmath59 for tm modes .",
    "the leading term @xmath60 of this equation s",
    "right hand side clearly corresponds to the fabry - perot type resonance condition derived from the simple ray model .",
    "the second term @xmath61 is a correction taking into account change of the wgm diameter depending on its wavelength as well as @xmath62 number .",
    "it may be said that higher-@xmath62 modes effectively see a smaller resonator , hence the positive frequency shift . in the third term @xmath63 a correction for different curvatures in polar and azimuthal direction is taken into account .",
    "the fourth term @xmath63 arises in the eikonal method from the polarization - dependent fresnel phases and implicitly accounts for the evanescent field of the resonator ( hence the factor @xmath57 distinguishing te and tm modes ) .",
    "note that this term explodes as the resonator material index of refraction @xmath32 approaches that of the surrounding media ( @xmath64 is assumed in eq .",
    "( [ disp ] ) ) and wgms become poorly confined .    in large resonators",
    "the evanescent field can be neglected for the sake of simplicity .",
    "this is done by setting the _ metallic _ boundary conditions at the rim of the resonator : @xmath65 . then introducing a local coordinate system such as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : coord ] it is rather straightforward to find approximate expressions for the eigenfunctions @xcite : @xmath66 here @xmath67 is the hermitian polynomial of the order @xmath68 , e.g. @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and so on .",

    "[ fig : coord ] and the minor semi - axis of the approximating ellipsoid : @xmath73 .",
    "the results ( [ eigenfunktion ] ) agree well with numerical simulations that take the evanescent tail of the mode properly into account , see fig .",
    "[ fig : transversalmoden ] .    surface shape of realistic wgm resonators may significantly differ from a sphere .",
    "in such cases introducing a local coordinate system such as shown here is more suitable . reprinted from @xcite.,width=321 ]    there are other ways to approximatly solve laplase equation for large wgm resonators of an arbitrary shape .",
    "wgms whose wavelengths are much smaller than the resonator size are localized in the vicinity of the equator of the resonator . here",
    "cylindrical coordinates can be used for resonators of any shape , including spherical .",
    "the shape of the resonator can be presented in form @xmath74 , where @xmath75 .",
    "the corresponding wave equation can be solved using separation of variables @xcite .",
    "dispersion relation ( [ disp ] ) has a nontrivial dependence on the mode numbers @xmath76 and resonator parameters .",
    "this leads to complicated spectra that are difficult to interpret for larger resonators .",
    "however , identifying a wgm numbers , especially @xmath62 , is critical for finding the phase matching conditions of various nonlinear - optical processes , as shown in section [ sec : natural ] .",
    "various techniques of optical wgm identification have been developed , including the free spectral range ( fsr ) measurement by sideband spectroscopy @xcite , far - field emission pattern analysis @xcite , or a combination of these techniques @xcite .",
    "the detailed spectrum of a wgm resonator can be measured using a reference optical frequency comb @xcite .    up to now",
    "we only considered wgm resonators that had isotropic material properties .",
    "these properties are inherent to amorphous wgm resonators such as droplets @xcite , molten silica spheres @xcite , toroids @xcite , or wedge shaped resonators @xcite .",
    "moreover , all crystals with cubic symmetry like  caf@xmath13 are isotropic .",
    "most of the crystals fall , however , in one of the four other symmetry classes , where the refractive index varies depending on polarization and propagation direction of the light . among crystals of these four symmetry classes ,",
    "the group of uniaxial crystals shows only one direction of light propagation , i.e.  one _ optic axis _",
    ", where the refractive index is independent of the polarization .",
    "the propagation of light in the plane perpendicular to the optic axis is then governed by the ordinary index of refraction @xmath77 for perpendicular polarization , while the extraordinary index of refraction @xmath78 is valid for the polarization parallel to the optic axis .",
    "wgm resonators made out of uniaxial materials are very important in our following discussion .",
    "usually they are made such that the optic axis is parallel to the rotational symmetry axis , i.e.  in the so - called @xmath79-cut geometry . in this special case the tm ( te )",
    "polarized mode is mainly influenced by the ordinary ( extraordinary ) refractive index .",
    "therefore the two mode families can be tuned independently , as the thermo - refractive , electro - optical , etc .",
    "effects all scale with the respective refractive indices , see sections [ sec : thermaltuning ] and [ sec : electricaltuning ] .",
    "a less common is the @xmath80-cut geometry , when the optic axis lies within the equatorial plane of the wgm resonator , i.e. is perpendicular to the axis of rotation . in this case",
    "the te polarized mode is governed by the constant ordinary refractive index , however the tm polarized mode experiences the refractive index oscillating _",
    "approximately _ harmonically between the ordinary and extraordinary values .",
    "we discuss applications of such resonators in section  [ sec : cycpm ] .",
    "the general case when the optic axis makes an arbitrary angle with the symmetry axis is highly non - trivial .",
    "it is not clear if there still exist two mode families in such resonators .",
    "the refractive index experienced by the light varies along the path of the wgm , and thus its polarization becomes position dependent .",
    "position - dependent walk - off further complicates the analysis . in spite of several theoretical and experimental investigations of wgm properties in the resonators with arbitrary orientation of the optical axis @xcite ,",
    "their behavior is not yet fully modeled and understood .      comparing the wgm dispersion equation ( [ disp ] ) to the dispersion equation describing an ideal one - dimensional resonator of the optical length @xmath81 : @xmath82",
    "we see that eq .",
    "( [ disp ] ) includes higher - order terms that can be attributed to the geometrical , or waveguide , dispersion .",
    "this dispersion arises from the boundary conditions and the resonator curvature .",
    "it is often convenient to treat large wgm resonators as one - dimensional resonators described by dispersion equation ( [ neff ] ) with the _ effective _ index of refraction @xmath83 which incorporates all the geometrical and material dispersion effects @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath84 depends on a variety of parameters , including the wavelength , the resonator semi - axes @xmath53 and @xmath54 , and the wgm family specified by the polarization and mode numbers @xmath62 and @xmath68 . to find @xmath84 , we first numerically solve ( [ disp ] ) for @xmath85 , then substitute @xmath86 into the right - hand side of ( [ neff ] ) , and solve it for @xmath84 .",
    "in doing so we may give up the requirement for @xmath85 and @xmath33 to be integer , which means that we treat the resonator spectrum as continuous .",

    "very high-@xmath0 resonators , the spectral response to the injected optical power via the mode volume heating may lead to thermal noise and instability which we will discuss in more detail in section [ sec : thermalnonlin ] .      because of high temperature sensitivity of the wgm spectra , the temperature tuning range can be very large , reaching a few to several tens of nanometers . however , this method is not very convenient because it is slow .",

    "permanent or quasi - permanent spectral changes can be induced in wgm resonators by various photochemical processes in the host material that affect the index of refraction .",
    "for example , spectra of germanium - doped silica micropheres have been tailored by a uv - exposure for an optical filtering application @xcite .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that the spectral changes can be monitored in real time , and the process can be stopped when the desired frequencies are reached .",

    "occasionally , modes from different families become nearly degenerate @xcite .",
    "ideally , these modes would not interact .",
    "however even a minute scattering can facilitate their energy exchange comparable with the intrinsic loss rate . in such a case the two modes can interact , which leads to the so - called avoided - crossings . as we have seen earlier in this section , modes from different families respond differently to external parameters such as temperature , pressure , electric field , or presence of scatterers .",
    "this opens one path to reaching a degeneracy , which is observed in e.g. photorefraction experiments @xcite .    usually in such experiments one of the crossing modes",
    "is coupled to a probing light source more efficiently than the other , which may be due to the different polarizations or @xmath62 s .",

    "it also was observed @xcite and studied in magnesium fluoride @xcite .",
    "regardless of how the mode coupling is physically realized , a straightforward approach to describing it is given by the following hamiltonian : @xmath145 where the modes interaction strength is given by @xmath98 .",
    "this hamiltonian has two eigenfrequencies : @xmath146     detunes the resonance frequencies , and a characteristic _ avoided - crossing _ pattern is seen .",

    "wgm spectrum tuning by avoided mode crossing does not usually offer the versatile control or large tuning range available from other techniques we discussed earlier",

    "in addition to the light modulation leading to generation of optical harmonics , resonant wgm eoms can be used as quadratic receivers of the microwave field @xcite .",
    "the operation principle of such devices is based on a nonlinear absorption of the input light , which increases proportionally to the microwave signal power .",
    "the increase of the optical loss changes the coupling conditions towards under - coupled and reduces the coupling contrast .",
    "such a behavior resembles operation of an opto - electronic transistor - like device , where a low - power ( a few tens of microwatts ) microwave signal changes transmission of a higher - power ( a few milliwatts ) optical signal .",

    "high sensitivity of these devices has inspired the application proposals in areas such as e.g. biomedical studies @xcite .",
    "concluding the section on electro - optical phenomena in wgm resonators , we should also mention the possibility of _ magneto_-optical phenomena .",
    "such a possibility has been discussed theoretically @xcite , and experimentally explored in ferromagnetic microspheres made from yttrium iron garnet @xcite .",
    "the conventional faraday effect as well as non - reciprocal sidebands generation at the magnon frequency is observed in these experiments .",
    "although most typical materials with significant faraday effect are lossy , and their @xmath0-factor is limited to approximately @xmath208 @xcite , the emerging field of wgm magneto - optics holds a great promise for building ultra - sensitive , room - temperature compact magnetometers as well as for efficient microwave - to - optics conversion .",
    "now let us turn to discussing second - order nonlinear interaction of optical fields .",
    "the overlap integral ( [ ovlp ] ) is responsible for all resonator - specific features of the three - wave mixing , including the mode selection rules .",
    "these rules reflect the symmetries inherent to the resonator and its eigenfunctions .",
    "the fundamental wgm symmetry is associated with rotation , which is expressed in the @xmath209 term in the eigenfunction ( [ fieldsphere ] ) .",
    "therefore the fundamental selection rule arising from ( [ ovlp ] ) corresponds to the angular momenta conservation : @xmath210 .",
    "further selection rules are discussed in @xcite . in particular , it is shown @xcite that in large resonators the overlap integral @xmath211 factors into the radial and angular parts as a very good approximation . the angular part yields clebsch - gordan coefficients @xmath212 that describe the photon s angular momenta conversion and invoke well - known selection rules : @xmath213 where @xmath214 is a natural number . for equatorial modes ( @xmath215 ) in large resonators",
    ", one can use the following asymptotic relation @xcite : @xmath216 which indicates a slow increase of the angular overlap , scaling as approximately the fourth - power root of the radius - to - wavelength ratio .",
    "the radial part of the overlap integral given by the airy functions overlap does not lead to any strict selection rules .",
    "however for large radial mode numbers @xmath217 and respective wavelengths @xmath218 it favors such conversion channels that @xmath219 @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ fig : ovlp ] .",
    "this occurs because for large @xmath62 the radial part @xmath220 of a wgm eigenfunction ( [ eigenfunktion ] ) takes on oscillatory form , and the selection rules begin to resemble those for coupled harmonic waves .",

    "reprinted from @xcite.,width=340 ]    analyzing the overlap integrals ( [ ovlp ] ) one can also learn how the nonlinear conversion efficiency depends on the resonator size .",
    "for example in @xcite , this dependence was theoretically studied for the frequency doubling of several pump wavelengths via various equatorial channels in a lithium niobate wgm resonator . curiously , in all studied cases the same scaling law was found : @xmath226 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : rscale ] .",
    "the same power scaling law was established , although not reported , for the @xmath222 frequency - sum generation @xcite .",
    "moreover , this is consistent with the @xmath227 wgm volume scaling in micro spheres @xcite .",
    "similarly to bulk crystals and straight waveguides , phase matching in wgm resonators can be modified by periodical poling . here",
    "periodic \" means a radial pattern such as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : poling ] rather than a series of parallel lines .",
    "periodical poling in crystals such as lithium niobate changes the local direction of the crystallographic @xmath79-axis and the sign of those @xmath228 tensor components that have only one or all three indices @xmath229 , @xmath175 and @xmath230 matching @xmath79 . as a result ,",
    "the @xmath169 factor in ( [ hint ] ) becomes coordinate - dependent and enters the overlap integral ( [ ovlp ] ) .",
    "radial poling pattern on a lithium niobate wafer , visualized by etching . reprinted from @xcite.,width=302 ]",
    "although various radial poling patterns have been discussed @xcite , it is easy to see that what really matters is the fourier - transform of this pattern with respect to the azimuthal angle @xmath231 . the most efficient quasi - phase matching ( qpm )",
    "is therefore achieved with a radially - poled structure consisting of @xmath232 equidistant ( in @xmath233 ) lines , see fig  [ fig : poling ] . in this case",
    "the first phase matching condition ( [ orb_sel_rules ] ) is modified as follows : @xmath234 where in close analogy with periodically poled straight waveguides and bulk crystals @xmath235 is the the phase matching order .",
    "it should be mentioned that a fabrication error leading to eccentricity between the resonator and poling pattern may have a considerable phase matching broadening effect that may be desirable or undesirable depending on the specific application @xcite .",
    "let us also point out that the early and some of the later demonstrations of qpm in wgm resonators were proposed @xcite and carried out @xcite with the poling patterns consisting of parallel , rather than radial , lines .",
    "phase matching in such resonators allows interesting interpretation in terms of the effective index approach discussed in section [ sec : neff ] . in this approach a large wgm resonator",
    "can be  unfolded \" into a straight waveguide with a modified index of refraction .",
    "a linear equidistant poling pattern then becomes variable , with the period ranging from its nominal value ( where the poling lines are radial ) to practically infinity ( where the poling lines are tangential ) .",
    "if the nominal period is sufficiently small , there will be four ( in degenerate case , two ) locations where the poling period is just right and the qpm is _ locally _ achieved for the desired process at the desired wavelengths .",
    "only these narrow segments of the resonator will contribute to the nonlinear conversion .",
    "importantly , their contributions will add coherently and may lead to either constructive , or destructive interference .",
    "a wide range of wavelengths can be nonlinearly converted in such a resonator , each at its own four locations .",
    "the cost of the wavelength versatility is the reduced conversion efficiency due to a limited interaction length at each location .    using the linearly - poled resonators",
    "was enabled by the commercial availability of periodically poled lithium niobate ( ppln)wafers . since then , several lithography - based radial poling techniques have been developed @xcite specifically for wgm resonators , including the already mentioned calligraphic poling technique @xcite .",
    "qpm in wgm resonators may arise even without artificial domain inversion . as an optic field propagates around the resonator ,",
    "its polarization orientation generally changes with respect to the crystallographic axes .",
    "this may lead to @xmath231-dependent modulation of the effective nonlinearity @xmath169 and/or of the index of refraction .",
    "the former effect can be observed e.g. in the shg experiments when @xmath169 couples the @xmath80 and @xmath236 projections of the optic field .",
    "this process has been predicted @xcite and observed @xcite in the @xmath237 symmetry crystals , such as gaas , gap , znse and others . in this case harmonic variation of the field projections",
    "leads to the following modification of the azimuthal phase matching condition : @xmath238 this modification may have an appreciable effect on the phase matching wavelength in small resonators where the fsr is large .    in a birefringent resonator",
    "whose optical axis does not match the axis of symmetry , the index of refraction for tm - polarized wgms also becomes a periodic function of @xmath231 , as we discussed in section [ sec : dielectricresonators ] .",
    "this leads to a more complicated situation than just the @xmath231-dependent @xmath169 . because this situation is not analytically tractable as yet ,",
    "only a special case of a uniaxial crystal with the optical axis lying in the resonator equatorial plane has been utilized in nonlinear optics .",
    "this type of resonators , usually called the x - cut or xy - cut resonators , manufactured from crystal quartz @xcite , lithium niobate and tantalate @xcite , and bbo @xcite have been shown to support high-@xmath0 modes that can be identified as te and tm at least at the coupling location .",
    "an shg _ cyclic _ phase matching in an x - cut bbo resonator has been demonstrated in @xcite . in such resonators , the refraction index for tm modes @xmath239 oscillates between the ordinary and extraordinary values @xmath77 and",
    "@xmath78 according to @xmath240 where we chose to measure the azimuthal angle @xmath231 from the optical axis . since this resonator has no ( infinite - order ) rotation symmetry , the quantum numbers @xmath241 can not be introduced in the strict sense , and selection rules ( [ orb_sel_rules ] ) no longer apply .",
    "phase matching in this resonator can be formulated following the effective index of refraction approach as @xmath242 where @xmath243 is the effective wave number for each mode . the local phase detuning for up - conversion of a te polarized pump into a tm polarized second harmonic @xmath244 depends on the azimuthal angle @xmath231 or on local coordinate @xmath245 measured along the  unfolded \" waveguide .",
    "this detuning governs the propagation equation for the second harmonic field @xcite : @xmath246    as in the previously discussed example of linearly poled wgm resonators , only four short waveguide regions may contribute to the second harmonic field build - up .",
    "however now these regions are determined not by the local qpm , but by a stationary - phase condition @xmath247 .",
    "other @xmath79-dependent parameters of equation ( [ shgcyclic ] ) can be evaluated at @xmath248 as a very good approximation .",
    "again , contributions from different regions @xmath249 may interfere constructively or destructively , and a wide - range cyclic phase matching comes at the price of reduced conversion efficiency .      the phase matching conditions , or mode selection rules ( [ orb_sel_rules ] ) in wgm resonators are significantly more relaxed compared to free space .",
    "indeed , the usual phase matching requirement @xmath250 is represented by a set of _ three _ equations imposing constraints , whereas ( [ orb_sel_rules ] ) has only _ one _ such equation .",
    "this flexibility allows for achieving in wgm resonators such types of phase matching that can not be achieved in bulk crystals .",
    "in particular , type 0 and type ii spdc was predicted in lithium niobate , lithium tantalate and bbo z - cut crystals in a wide range of pump wavelengths @xcite , although the overlap penalty for using high - order modes with large @xmath62 may be significant .",
    "it is even possible to find a double phase matching , e.g. for nondegenerate spdc with simultaneous frequency - doubling of the signal , idler or both @xcite .",
    "double phase matching in strongly nonlinear systems is interesting in the context of quantum - optics applications .",
    "it can lead to multipartite entanglement @xcite and to control of the photon pair statistics in spdc via quantum zeno blockade . a search for exotic phase matching in wgm resonators",
    "can be conveniently accomplished using the effective index of refraction approach introduced in section [ sec : neff ] .",
    "this approach leads to a simple but approximate analytical expressions for the phase matching conditions in the wavequide form ( [ betapm ] ) .",
    "they are approximate because the wgm frequencies are treated as continuous , whereas in an actual resonator they are discrete .",
    "therefore the accuracy of this method is limited by the resonator s free spectral range .",
    "the simplicity of this approach comes from the same approximation , which allows us to solve a continuous - value set of equations ( [ betapm ] ) rather than to look for the discrete - value solutions to the wgm dispersion equations set ( [ disp ] ) constrained by selection rules ( [ orb_sel_rules ] ) .",
    "an important observation regarding the effective index phase matching is that it strongly depends on the radial mode numbers @xmath62 , especially when the resonator is small . in section [ sec : neff ] we already mentioned that the geometric correction to the refractive index is negative : @xmath251 .",
    "moreover , @xmath252 becomes progressively larger for larger @xmath62 , because the optical field of a higher - order mode effectively has a shorter path to travel , see fig .",
    "[ fig : transversalmoden ] . in small resonators",
    "this effect can be quite strong even in comparison with natural birefrigence , which explains the unusual phase matching .",
    "we should point out that while the double phase matching can be relatively easily found by the effective index of refraction method , its realization in a fully - resonant system such as a wgm resonator is difficult to achieve in practice .",
    "it depends on such control parameters that can not be easily tuned , e.g. the resonator radius and rim shape .",
    "analysis of nonlinear optical processes dynamics in phase - matched wgm resonators has been reported for the shg @xcite and opo @xcite , as well as for the sum - frequency generation ( sfg ) @xcite and difference - frequency generation ( dfg ) @xcite .",

    "( [ setz ] ) .",
    "it shows the dynamics similar to other triply - resonant systems with second - order nonlinearity , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "its details strongly depend on the in / out coupling regime for the nonlinearly coupled modes , as well as on the relation between the resonator linear loss and nonlinear conversion rates .",
    "there are however some universal features .",
    "for example , the shg conversion efficiency reaches a maximum at a saturation pump power @xmath253 , and then drops .",

    "are closely related : @xmath255 @xcite , where @xmath256 where @xmath257 is the pump wavelength and @xmath258 is the phase - matched refractive index .",
    "degenerate type i spdc in wgm resonators can not be described with just a pair of coupled - mode equations([setz ] ) . indeed , because the wgm spectral lines are locally equidistant , degenerate down conversion of the pump mode with an orbital momentum @xmath259 into the signal ( and idler ) mode with @xmath260 also implies the possibility of the same pump conversion into non - degenerate modes @xmath261 @xmath262 .",
    "here @xmath263 , and up to some maximum number determined by the wgm linewidths and the group velocity dispersion of the resonator .",
    "conversion channels with small @xmath264 will be nearly on - resonance and hence almost equally efficient .",
    "a spdc optical comb is therefore expected @xcite to form around the degenerate wavelength .    as a higher - order effect in a multi - mode near - degenerate spdc",
    ", the tresholdless sum - frequency generation process among the parametric comb lines may lead to building up another comb around the pump mode . for this secondary conversion to be efficient",
    ", the fsrs at the pump and degenerate spdc wavelengths must be nearly equal , which is granted by the phase matching .",
    "this kind of a double - comb structure has been observed @xcite and studied theoretically @xcite in straight waveguide cavities .",
    "the presence of multiple near - equidistant modes also makes the conventional wgm shg description based on two coupled - modes equations insufficient beyond the low - power linear regime .",
    "once the circulating shg power exceeds the opo threshold , the non - degenerate multiple - line down conversion commences .",
