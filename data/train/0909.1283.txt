    "the theoretical understanding of complex materials with strongly interacting electrons is one of the most challenging areas of current research in condensed matter physics",
    ". experimental studies of such materials have often revealed rich phase diagrams originating from the interplay between electronic and lattice degrees of freedom .",
    "@xcite this makes these compounds particularly interesting in view of possible technological applications .",
    "namely , the great sensitivity of many correlated electron materials with respect to changes of external parameters such as temperature , pressure , magnetic and/or electric field , doping , etc .",
    ", can be employed to construct materials with useful functionalities .",
    "@xcite    the electronic properties of materials can be computed from first principles by density functional theory in the local density approximation ( lda ) , @xcite the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) , @xcite or using the so - called lda+u method .",
    "@xcite applications of these approaches accurately describe the phase diagrams of many simple elements and semiconductors , and of some insulators .",
    "moreover , they often allow to make correct qualitative predictions of the magnetic , orbital , and crystal structures of solids , where the equilibrium ( thermodynamic ) structures are determined by simultaneous optimization of the electron and lattice systems .",
    "@xcite however , these methods usually fail to describe the correct electronic and structural properties of electronically correlated _ paramagnetic _ materials .",
    "hence the computation of electronic , magnetic , and structural properties of strongly correlated paramagnetic materials remains a great challenge .",
    "here the recently developed combination of conventional band structure theory and dynamical mean - field theory , @xcite the so - called lda+dmft computational scheme , @xcite has become a powerful tool for the investigation of strongly correlated compounds in both their paramagnetic and magnetically ordered states . in particular",
    ", it provides important insights into the spectral and magnetic properties of correlated electron materials , @xcite especially in the vicinity of a mott metal - insulator transition as encountered in transition metal oxides .",
    "@xcite up to now implementations of the lda+dmft approach utilized linearized and higher - order muffin - tin orbital [ l(n)mto ] techniques @xcite and focused on the investigation of electronic correlation effects for a given lattice structure .",
    "however , the mutual interaction between electrons and ions , i.e. , the influence of the electrons on the lattice structure , is then completely neglected .",
    "lda+dmft computations of the volume collapse in paramagnetic ce @xcite and pu @xcite and of the collapse of the magnetic moment in mno @xcite did include the lattice , but only calculated the total energy of the correlated material as a function of the unit cell volume .",
    "@xcite in the case of more subtle structural transformations , e.g. , involving the cooperative jahn - teller ( jt ) effect , @xcite the l(n)mto technique is not suitable since it can not reliably determine atomic positions .",
    "this is due to the atomic - sphere approximation within the l(n)mto scheme , where a spherical potential inside the atomic sphere is employed .",
    "thereby multipole contributions to the electrostatic energy due to the distorted charge density distribution around the atom are ignored .",
    "instead , the recently proposed implementation of the lda+dmft approach , which employs plane - wave pseudopotentials @xcite and thus avoids the atomic sphere approximation , does not neglect such contributions .",
    "thereby it becomes possible to describe the effect of the distortion on the electrostatic energy .",
    "@xcite    in this paper , we present a detailed formulation of the lda+dmft scheme implemented with plane - wave pseudopotentials reported earlier .",
    "@xcite this scheme allows us to compute structural transformations ( e.g. , structural phase stability and structure optimization ) caused by electronic correlations .",
    "most importantly , it is able to determine correlation - induced structural transformations in both paramagnetic solids and long - range ordered solids .",
    "therefore , the present computational scheme overcomes the limitations of standard band - structure approaches and opens the way for fully microscopic investigations of the structural properties of strongly correlated electron materials .",
    "we apply this method to study orbital order and the cooperative jt distortion in two prototypical jt materials , kcuf@xmath0 and lamno@xmath0 , and compute the electronic , structural , and orbital properties in their room - temperature paramagnetic phase . at room temperature ,",
    "both compounds have a distorted perovskite structure with a strong cooperative jt distortion . considering this structural complexity",
    ", kcuf@xmath0 has a relatively high ( tetragonal ) symmetry , @xcite where only the cooperative jt distortion of the cuf@xmath1 octahedra is responsible for the deviation from the cubic perovskite symmetry .",
    "lamno@xmath0 instead crystallizes in a more complex ( orthorhombic ) structure in which mno@xmath1 octahedra are simultaneously jt distorted and tilted with respect to the ideal cubic perovskite structure .",
    "@xcite the jt distortion persists up to the melting temperature @xmath2 k in kcuf@xmath0 .",
    "by contrast , in lamno@xmath0 it persists only up to @xmath3 k , the temperature at which the jt distortion vanishes and where lamno@xmath0 undergoes a structural phase transition with a volume collapse to a nearly cubic structure without jt distortion and orbital order .",
    "@xcite concerning the electronic configuration , kcuf@xmath0 nominally has a cu@xmath4 @xmath5 structure , i.e. , a single hole in the @xmath6 shell .",
    "by contrast , due to hund s rule coupling lamno@xmath0 has a single @xmath7 electron bound to the fully spin - polarized three @xmath8 electrons in a high spin @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) electronic configuration . to properly describe this correlated state , a different treatment compared to kcuf@xmath0",
    "is required , which takes into account the effective on - site spin interaction between @xmath11 and @xmath12 electrons .",
    "@xcite at low temperatures , both systems display @xmath13-type long - range antiferromagnetic order , consistent with the goodenough - kanamori - anderson rules for a superexchange interaction with antiferro - orbital order . in both compounds the n ' eel temperature ( @xmath14 k in kcuf@xmath0 and @xmath15 k in lamno@xmath0 ) is remarkably lower than @xmath16 .    in this paper",
    "we will show that our approach can explain the orbital order , cooperative jt distortion , and related structural properties in both materials , in spite of their chemical , structural , and electronic differences .",
    "the scheme is robust and makes it possible to address , on the same footing , electronic , magnetic , and structural properties of strongly correlated materials .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we present computational details needed to reproduce the results of our calculations .",
    "the crystal structures , magnetic properties , and results of electronic structure calculations of paramagnetic kcuf@xmath0 and lamno@xmath0 are presented in sections iii and iv , respectively .",
    "finally , the results are summarized in section v.",
    "in order to compute the electronic structure of correlated electron materials , we have implemented dmft within a realistic electronic structure approach , which is formulated in terms of plane - wave pseudopotentials .",
    "@xcite following the paper of anisimov _ et al",
    ". _ @xcite and trimarchi _ et al .",
    "_ , @xcite this can be achieved by applying a projection onto atomic - centered symmetry - constrained wannier orbitals , @xcite which gives an effective low - energy hamiltonian @xmath17 for the partially filled correlated orbitals ( e.g. , @xmath6 orbitals of transition metal ion ) .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath17 provides a realistic description of the material s single - electron band structure .",
    "it is supplemented by on - site coulomb interactions for the correlated orbitals , resulting in a many - body hamiltonian of the form : @xmath18 here the second and third terms on the right - hand side describe the local coulomb interaction between electrons in the same and in different correlated orbitals , respectively , with @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is a double counting correction which accounts for the electronic interactions already described by dft ( see below ) .",
    "the coulomb repulsion @xmath21 and hund s rule exchange @xmath22 can be evaluated using a constrained dft scheme within a wannier - functions formalism , making the hamiltonian ( 1 ) free of adjustable parameters .",
    "@xcite    the many - body hamiltonian ( 1 ) is then solved by dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) @xcite with the effective impurity model treated , e.g. , by the numerically exact hirsch - fye quantum monte - carlo method .",
    "@xcite finally , applying a maximum entropy treatment of monte - carlo data , one obtains the real - frequency spectral functions , which can be further compared to physically observable spectra .",
    "the total energy is another important quantity which can be evaluated from dft+dmft calculation using the following expression @xcite @xmath23 + \\langle \\hat h_{dft } \\rangle - \\sum_{m , k } \\epsilon^{dft}_{m , k } + \\langle \\hat h_{u } \\rangle - e_{dc}. \\label{eqn : energy}\\ ] ] here @xmath24 $ ] is the total energy obtained by dft . the third term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( 2 ) is the sum of the dft valence - state eigenvalues which is evaluated as the thermal average of the dft hamiltonian with the non - interacting dft green s function @xmath25 : @xmath26 e^{i\\omega_n0^{+}}.\\ ] ] in this expression , we have assumed that the dft total energy has only a weak temperature dependence via the fermi distribution function , i.e. , one neglects the temperature dependence of the exchange - correlation potential .",
    "@xmath27 is evaluated similarly but with the full green s function including the self - energy . to calculate these two contributions ,",
    "the summation is performed over the matsubara frequencies @xmath28 ( typically with @xmath29 ) , taking into account an analytically evaluated asymptotic correction ( see below ) .",
    "thus , for @xmath27 one has @xmath30 e^{i\\omega_n0^{+ } }   \\notag \\\\ & = & t\\sum^{\\pm i\\omega_{n_{max}}}_{i\\omega_n,\\mathbf{k } } tr \\",

    "the interaction energy @xmath35 is computed from the double occupancy matrix .",
    "the double - counting correction @xmath36 is evaluated as the average coulomb repulsion between the @xmath37 correlated electrons in the wannier orbitals . in the case of a paramagnet it corresponds to @xmath38 .",
    "since the hamiltonian involves only correlated orbitals the number of wannier electrons @xmath37 is conserved .",
    "therefore , the double - counting correction amounts to an irrelevant shift of the total energy .    within this approach , we can determine correlation - induced structural transformations , as well as the corresponding change of the atomic coordinates and of the unit cell shape .",
    "the result can be further used to explain the experimentally observed structural data and to predict structural properties of real correlated materials . in sections iii and",
    "iv we will apply this method to determine the orbital order and the cooperative jt distortion in the paramagnetic phase of two prototypical jt systems kcuf@xmath0 and lamno@xmath0 .",
    "kcuf@xmath0 is the prototype of a material with a cooperative jahn - teller ( jt ) distortion , orbital order , and low - dimensional magnetism .",
    "@xcite at room temperature it crystallizes in a pseudocubic perovskite crystal structure @xcite which is related to the crystal structure of high-@xmath39 superconductors and colossal magnetoresistance manganites and , particularly , to their parent compound , lamno@xmath0 . due to the particular orbital order in kcuf@xmath0",
    "it is one of the rare examples of an ideal one - dimensional antiferromagnetic heisenberg system .",
    "@xcite thus , the copper ions have an octahedral fluorine surrounding and are nominally in a cu@xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) electronic configuration with a single hole in the @xmath12 states .",
    "this gives rise to a strong jt instability that lifts the cubic degeneracy at cu @xmath12 states due to a cooperative jt distortion .",
    "@xcite the latter is characterized by cuf@xmath1 octahedra elongated along the @xmath40 and @xmath41 axis and arranged in an antiferro - distortive pattern in the @xmath42 plane .",
    "@xcite at room temperature , there are two different structural polytypes with antiferro ( @xmath40-type ) and ferrolike ( @xmath43-type ) stacking of the @xmath42 planes along the @xmath44 axis .",
    "@xcite the jt distortion is associated with the particular orbital order in kcuf@xmath0 , in which a single hole alternatingly occupies @xmath45 and @xmath46 orbital states , resulting in a tetragonal compression ( @xmath47 ) of the unit cell .",
    "the mechanism responsible for the orbital order in kcuf@xmath0 is still being debated in the literature .",
    "@xcite in particular , purely electronic effects such as in the kugel - khomskii theory @xcite and the electron - lattice interaction @xcite have been discussed as possible driving forces behind the orbital order .",
    "the relatively high ( tetragonal ) symmetry makes kcuf@xmath0 one of the simplest system to study . in particular , in order to describe the jt distortion , only a single internal structure parameter , the shift of the in - plane fluorine atom from the cu - cu bond center , is needed .",
    "moreover , kcuf@xmath0 has a single hole in the @xmath6 shell resulting in absence of multiplet effects .",
    "altogether , the electronic and structural properties of kcuf@xmath0 have been intensively studied by density functional theory in the local density approximation ( lda ) , @xcite the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) , @xcite or using the so - called lda+u approach .",
    "@xcite while the lda+u calculations account rather well for the value of equilibrium jt distortion in kcuf@xmath0 , @xcite the calculations simultaneously predict long - range antiferromagnetic order which indeed occurs in kcuf@xmath0 below @xmath48 ( @xmath49 k and 22 k for the @xmath40 polytype and for the @xmath43 polytype , respectively ) .",
    "@xcite note , however , that the n ' eel temperature is much lower than the critical temperature for orbital order which is generally assumed to be as large as the melting temperature ( @xmath2 k ) .",
    "the lda+u calculations give the correct insulating ground state with the long - range @xmath13-type antiferromagnetic and @xmath50 antiferro - orbital order , @xcite consistent with the goodenough - kanamori - anderson rules for a superexchange interaction .",
    "non - magnetic lda calculations instead predict a _",
    "metallic _ behavior .",
    "moreover , the electronic and structural properties of kcuf@xmath0 have been recently reexamined by means of lda+u molecular - dynamic simulations , indicating a possible symmetry change and challenging the original assignment of tetragonal symmetry .",
    "@xcite this symmetry change seems to allow for a better understanding of raman , @xcite electronic paramagnetic resonance , @xcite and x - ray resonant scattering @xcite properties at @xmath51 .",
    "however , the details of this distortion have not been fully resolved yet .",
    "the lda+u approach is able to determine electronic properties and the jt distortion in kcuf@xmath0 rather well , @xcite but the application of this approach is limited to temperatures below @xmath48 .",
    "lda+u can not explain the properties at @xmath52 and , in particular , at room temperature , where kcuf@xmath0 is a correlated paramagnetic insulator with a robust jt distortion which persists up to the melting temperature .    here",

    "<S> the computed equilibrium jahn - teller distortion and antiferro - orbital order agree well with experiment , and the structural optimization performed for paramagnetic kcuf@xmath0 yields the correct lattice constant , equilibrium jahn - teller distortion and tetragonal compression of the unit cell . </S>",
    "<S> most importantly , the present approach is able to determine correlation - induced structural transformations , equilibrium atomic positions and lattice structure in both strongly and weakly correlated solids in their _ paramagnetic _ phases as well as in phases with long - range magnetic order . </S>"
