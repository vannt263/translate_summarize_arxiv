    "precise determination of the light hadron spectrum with dynamical up , down and strange quarks is a key step for validating qcd at low energies . as a step toward this goal ,",
    "we have pursued a systematic calculation in two - flavor qcd using the non - perturbatively @xmath0-improved wilson quark action @xcite . in this article , we present the final results of the hadron spectrum and quark masses from this calculation . a test of the one - loop chiral perturbation theory formula in our lattice data is discussed in a separate talk @xcite .",
    "our simulations were performed at @xmath2 , where the scale is @xmath3  fm , on @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 lattices .",
    "we simulated five sea quark masses @xmath7 , 0.1343 , 0.1346 , 0.1350 and 0.1355 , which cover the range of @xmath80.60 .",
    "for further details of the simulations , we refer the reader to the previous reports @xcite and a forthcoming paper @xcite .",
    "the main progress after the last conference is that we accumulated doubled statistics ( 12000 hmc trajectories ) on the largest lattice .",
    "finite size effects ( fse ) are more pronounced in full qcd than in quenched qcd . since our largest volume size @xmath9 is not so large , it is important to check fse in our data .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fse ] , we plot the relative mass shift between the two larger lattices @xmath10 for pseudo - scalar mesons and the octet baryons as a function of valence @xmath11 for each sea quark mass . we see that @xmath12 is consistent with zero for the whole range of valence quark mass down to the second lightest sea quark at @xmath13 .",
    "the size effect becomes visible and increases with reduced @xmath11 for the lightest sea quark at @xmath14 .",
    "the wrapping of valence quarks in the spatial directions leading to fse due to the size of hadrons is suppressed by the center @xmath15 symmetry in quenched qcd @xcite . in full qcd",
    ", @xmath15 symmetry is broken by the wrapping of sea quarks in the spatial directions , whose magnitude increases toward lighter sea quark .",
    "a qualitative understanding of the behavior in fig .  [ fig : fse ] would be that the @xmath15 breaking turns on rather quickly around our lightest sea quark .",
    "the volume dependence of our data is well described by the power law ansatz @xmath16 @xcite . for pseudo - scalar and vector mesons ,",
    "the magnitude of fse indicated by this fit is about 3  % at @xmath17 , which roughly corresponds to the strange quark mass , and increases to 5% toward the chiral limit .",
    "however , since the volume dependence is expected to turn into a milder behavior @xmath18 $ ] for sufficiently large volumes , the actual size of fse should be smaller .",
    "in particular , at strange quark mass , fse should not exceed a few % level .     and @xmath19 .",
    ", width=245 ]    finite size effects are more pronounced for baryon masses . for our lightest sea quark , the magnitude of fse is about 5% at @xmath17 and increases to 10% for @xmath20 .",
    "this is comparable with the typical size of the quenching error .",
    "therefore , masses of light baryons such as @xmath21 and @xmath22 may be affected by fse .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : mv_vs_mps2 ] , we compare the valence quark mass dependence of the vector meson mass at each sea quark mass and in quenched qcd .",
    "the full qcd data have a steeper slope than the quenched qcd , and show a better agreement with the experimental points .",
    "the increase of the slope can be explicitly seen in the @xmath23 parameter @xcite shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : j ] .",
    "the value of @xmath23 , which is consistent with the quenched value for heavier sea quark masses , increases as the sea quark mass decreases .",
    "the chiral limit is still significantly lower than the phenomenological value , which may be attributed to quenching of strange quarks .",
    "finite size effects , possibly present at a few percent level , do not alter these results since masses at larger volumes would show a steeper slope in fig .",

    "our results for the spectrum are plotted in fig .",

    "the deviation of the meson spectrum from experiment is reduced significantly by the inclusion of dynamical up and down quarks .",
    "the strange baryon masses , such as @xmath30 and @xmath31 , also show a closer agreement with experiment in full qcd . however , sea quark effects are less clear in lighter baryons like @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "this is probably due to fse , which is enhanced for the lighter baryons .",

    "calculation of @xmath26 and @xmath27 is performed with the bare quark mass defined through either the vector ( vwi ) or axial vector ward identity ( awi ) . for the latter , we use the improved axial current with @xmath33 at one - loop @xcite .",
    "the continuum @xmath34 quark mass is obtained by the one - loop matching @xcite at scale @xmath35 and evolved to @xmath36  gev using four - loop beta function .",
    "it is expected that various systematic uncertainties , such as scaling violation , partially cancel in the ratio defining the awi mass @xmath37 .",
