    "central diffractive production of heavy objects in its @xmath0 mode ( no other particle produced in the central rapidity region ) appears as a promising complementary tool for the study of new particles at the lhc , such as the higgs boson .",
    "indeed , for instance , the mass determination can be made quite precise , if both incident protons are detected and measured in forward detectors located at 220 and 420 m from the interaction point at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "one expects to take advantage of the absence of other particles than the decay products in the central rapidity region and some other interesting aspects such as the depletion of b - quark production due to the helicity rule specific of this production mode  @xcite .",
    "the key problem of central diffractive production in the exclusive mode is to determine its rate as a function of @xmath1 the higgs boson mass or the minimum @xmath2 of the jets .",
    "experimental results on massive dijet production at the tevatron has shown indirect evidence for exclusive production , by comparison with models of @xmath3 diffractive production .",
    "inclusive models @xcite agree to point out an excess of events over the inclusive spectrum in the kinematical region where exclusive production is expected to contribute .",
    "the experimental interest of central exclusive production , in the first place for the higgs boson and @xmath4 induced processes , and the preparation of concrete proposals at the lhc is a major incentive for theorists to work out reliable predictions for the production cross section , which could serve as a basis for the necessary data simulations .",
    "this task is not easy since central diffractive processes imply both hard subprocesses , related to the high mass of the centrally produced states , and soft ones which are typical of diffractive events which leave intact the initial particles -@xmath1 protons at the lhc . in some sense one could say that central diffractive production is expected to combine the `` hardest '' events such as the production of massive higgs bosons or of any high mass object ( dijet , diphoton ... ) , with the `` softest '' ones , since the initial particles remain totally intact ( up to a loss of energy not bigger than 10 % ) .",
    "this reveals the potentially @xmath5 character of central diffractive production .    on the theoretical ground , different mechanisms of exclusive central diffraction",
    "have been proposed since years  @xcite , but we will restrict to two classes of models which are based on the exchange of colorless objects , in order to take into account the diffractive property . indeed , any colored object would generate particle production in the whole rapidity interval .",
    "one class is based on the exchange of two pomerons , where the pomeron is the colorless exchange which appear in @xmath1 elastic reactions ; it can be called the non perturbative model ( npm ) and was based on a typical soft interaction hypothesis , which comes from the bialas - landshoff mechanism  @xcite originally proposed for central diffusive production .",
    "it has an @xmath3 version which describes the inclusive diffractive dijet production @xcite , while its @xmath0 version has been studied in ref.@xcite .",
    "one another class of models is based on the exchange of two gluons at each vertex for the exclusive production  @xcite called kmr ( from the author names ) in the following .",
    "for both models there exists a detailed phenomenological discussion ( see @xmath6@xcite ) based on dedicated simulations .",
    "let us recall the present status of this physically meaning discussion .",
    "the inclusive production mechanism based on the npm  @xcite gives satisfactory results when compared to tevatron data .",
    "using this agreement , the extraction of the exclusive component in the dpe framework becomes possible , since it appears to be necessary to include it in a well - defined region of phase - space .",
    "when comparing  @xcite the extracted dijet cross section and spectra with the models , it appears that the kmr model  @xcite gives a better description of the results than npm  @xcite .",
    "the main reason is that it takes into account the sudakov suppression factors preventing cross section s to include the gluon radiation normally associated with the production of a massive object .",
    "the soft pomeron exchanges of npm  @xcite do not contain these perturbative qcd factors and give a too flat distribution as a function of the minimum transverse momentum @xmath7 of the jet @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the prediction for the higgs boson cross section , which was similar for both models for a light higgs boson @xcite , has a different form as a function of the higgs boson mass , being steeper for the kmr model  @xcite than for npm  @xcite .",
    "it is expected that the npm model in ref .",
    "@xcite works at low masses ( for instance for @xmath8 production  @xcite ) whereas a model including a hard contribution may be valid at higher masses .",
    "our motivation is to keep the double pomeron exchange ( dpe ) hypothesis , while taking into account the fact that the diffractive production process is expected to be a mixture of soft and hard color exchanges .",
    "indeed , the notion of a hard pomeron ( associated in qcd with the summation of ladder diagrams in the leading or next - to - leading logarithmic approximation ( lla ) of the perturbative expansion ) is a theoretical result of qcd @xcite .",
    "moreover it has been successfully compared with data in ( hard ) inclusive diffraction ( see , @xmath1 @xcite ) and exclusive vector - meson production @xcite .",
    "the example of heavy vector meson production , in particular , is well suited for our approach since it corresponds to the ( quasi- ) elastic production of a heavy state , which can be formulated in the framework of a hard pomeron exchange .    in the theoretical calculations",
    ", the hard pomeron appears to correspond to ladder diagrams connecting two exchanged reggeized colored gluons @xcite .",
    "however , in central diffractive production , one could expect to have two different colored exchanges , one hard and one soft .",
    "it would correspond physically to two time scales , one short corresponding to the heavy state production , and one long corresponding to the necessary color neutralization .",
    "hence , the qualitative picture of central diffractive production which we formulate is a dpe process in which each pomeron exchange at the vertex would correspond to @xmath5 pomerons with two different types of color exchanges one soft and one hard .",
    "it would correspond to an @xmath9 way of summing ladder diagrams between hard and soft colored reggeized gluons , which precise calculation remains beyond our scope ( and beyond the present knowledge of non perturbative qcd physics ) .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in the next section",
    ", we shall formulate the hybrid pomeron model ( hpm ) and determine its parameters obtained from known soft and hard pomeron processes . in section iii",
    ", we will show its good description of exclusive dijet production extracted from data at the tevatron and the prediction for higgs boson and dijet production at the lhc .",
    "the last section is for discussions , conclusions and an outlook .",
    "the model , adopting as a starting point the idea of the original bialas - landshoff formulation , consists in defining effective propagators and couplings for the colored exchanges associated with central dpe processes , see fig.[1 ] .",
    "however , by contrast with the original npm model of ref.@xcite , we introduce two types of propagators and couplings , depending of its soft or hard character .",
    "the soft propagator @xmath10 and coupling @xmath11 are exactly those which appear in the original description of the bialas - landshoff model @xcite , themselves connected to the soft pomeron landshoff - nachtmann formulation @xcite of the elastic cross section , see fig.[2 ] .",
    "they are constrained to describe the elastic hadronic cross section , which fixes its parameters .",
    "[ htb ]    1    the new aspect , w.r.t .",
    "the original formulation @xcite , is to introduce similarly effective propagators and couplings @xmath12 and coupling @xmath13 for hard pomeron processes . since we are formulating a _ hybrid pomeron model _",
    "( hpm ) , we would optimally need the resummation of qcd ladder diagrams corresponding to both soft and hard colored exchanges . as we see in fig .",
    "[ 1 ] , the hard exchange produces the heavy state object ( @xmath14 ) while the colorless aspect of the exchange is ensured via the emission of a soft additional gluon ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "this means that most of the available momentum is carried away by one of the gluon , the hard one , while the soft one carries only a very small fraction of the proton momentum .",
    "the hard part of the hpm model will be based on hard physics measured at hera ( for instance the proton structure function @xmath16 ) while the soft part will be based on usual soft cross section measurements . in the case of simple elementary gluon exchanges , as developed in the model @xcite , the problem is perturbatively tractable , since the loop kinematics enforces a ( semi- ) perturbative calculation . however , when considering pomeron ladders , the gluon loop constraint , characteristic of the mechanism of @xcite does not hold and thus one relies on the bialas - landshoff modified picture in order to include both soft and hard effective color exchanges , see fig.[1 ] .",
    "hence our proposal is to start with the description of hard pomeron scattering in terms of effective hard colored propagators @xmath12 and couplings @xmath13 , in the same way as for the soft color exchanges in @xcite .    for this sake we consider the well - known dipole - proton amplitudes which appears in the qcd description of many hard processes .",
    "they will be used to determine the effective propagators and couplings . in that sense , it is possible to fix the parameters of the model using hard physics measurements at hera , especially from the measurements of the proton structure function and the vector meson production cross sections . in this basic process , a dipole of size @xmath17 experiences an elastic scattering with the proton . since this dipole - proton amplitude",
    ", corresponding to an hard pomeron exchange , appears in the formulation of different observables , its parameters are well determined , and thus gives the possibility to define the appropriate hard propagators @xmath12 and couplings @xmath13 , in the same way as was done for the soft ones , but with the advantage that we have a theoretical control on its precise qcd formulation .",
    "a comment has to be made at this stage .",
    "the main new aspect of hpm is to introduce a formulation for hard color exchanges .",
    "since it is a phenomenological effective description of diagrams going beyond elementary gluon exchanges , it aims at keeping the physical image of two different time scales and thus of two different types of effective propagators .",
    "hence the virtuality associated with the hard color exchanges can not be transferred to the other color exchange through the loop kinematics , as is the case in the model @xcite .",
    "on the other hand the inclusion of hard color exchanges in the dpe formulation is expected to ( and indeed will , as we shall see ) correct the drawbacks of the initial soft model .",
    "we evaluate the non - perturbative gluon propagator from the elastic proton - proton data , see fig .",
    "[ 2 ] . following landshoff - nachtmann proposal  @xcite ,",
    "the elastic hadron - hadron scattering is represented by the contributions of elastic valence quark scattering mediated by a non - perturbative model for gluon exchange .",
    "the elastic quark - quark amplitude in terms of soft propagator and coupling writes @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the total c.o.m .",
    "@xmath20 the transfer quadrimoment squared whose dependence is approximated by an exponential slope given by @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the soft pomeron regge trajectory @xcite , with @xmath23 being the pomeron `` anomalous intercept '' .",
    "note that we have incorporated the factors due to reggeization @xcite in the definition of the propagators .",
    "this is required in order to take into account the different regge parameters ( and in particular the known different energy dependence ) between the soft and hard pomeron ingredients . in other terms",
    "the _ hybrid pomeron _ will have an intermediate energy dependence compared to the soft and the hard pomeron s ones .",

    "it is convenient to open the possibility of saturation effects , even if they are not expected to be important in the kinematical domain we are interested in .",
    "indeed , this form of the dipole proton amplitude ( eventually modified by saturation contributions ) has been proven to be phenomenologically successful in the description of proton total and diffractive structure functions @xcite and , more importantly for our analysis , for structure function @xmath16 measured at hera including the charm contribution  @xcite for vector meson elastic differential cross section  @xcite and for inelastic diffraction @xcite , which will be used for parameter fixing .",
    "hence the model we will adopt for dipole - proton elastic scattering contains saturation effects and @xmath29dependence  @xcite .",
    "[ hbt ]    3    we start with the following amplitude in terms of the bfkl kernel .",
    "one writes @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the mellin transform of the bfkl kernel @xcite .",
    "@xmath32 contains information on the coupling to the proton and other normalization contributions .",
    "the effect of saturation , through nonlinear damping factors , is known @xcite to select a @xmath33 value @xmath34 this corresponds to a `` anomalous dimension '' @xmath35 which is characteristic of a ( saturation - corrected ) hard pomeron . in a more concrete way ,",
    "the authors of @xcite make use of a model for the dipole - proton amplitude @xcite which successfully describes the precise proton structure function data .",
    "@xmath36 where @xmath37 is the well - known saturation scale , the term @xmath38 has been added in order to take into account the momentum transfer dependence in vector meson production @xcite . the exponential term in takes into account the contribution from the kernel variation around the saddle - point .",
    "note that this amplitude works @xcite in the region @xmath39 , which is safely true in our case .",
    "the saturation corrections are expected to be negligible in that region .",
    "it is important to notice at this stage that we need to consider _ amputated _ amplitudes , that is multiplying the expressions ( [ equa1],[equa2 ] ) of the dipole - proton amplitude by a factor @xmath40 indeed , we have to remove from the usual dipole proton amplitude the factor corresponding to the geometrical dimension of the dipole cross section proportional to @xmath41 , or on other words the gluon dipole coupling .",
    "this factor has to be removed in order to define properly the couplings and propagators of the hard effective color exchanges , which would be valid for any massive state .",
    "we are interested in applying our formalism to the exclusive production of massive dijets or the higgs boson and thus have to switch from a dipole state to the wave function coresponding to the heavy state under study .    in the kinematical configuration of central diffractive production",
    ", we have at each hard color exchange vertex ( see fig .  [ 1 ] ) @xmath42 where we used a very simple relation ( with @xmath43 phenomenologically ) between the mass @xmath44 of the heavy state and the corresponding dipole size @xmath17 to be considered .",
    "the normalization factors @xmath45 for the amplitude and the scale @xmath46 are also determined phenomenologically from hera data . for dipole - proton scattering ,",
    "we assume also a dominance of `` valence '' quark - quark scattering and 6 quark - quark combinations are allowed .",
    "the main characteristic feature of the hard pomeron by contrast with the soft one is that it has a non trivial dependence on @xmath47 and @xmath17 ( translating into a non trivial @xmath48 and @xmath44 dependence in the central diffraction kinematics ) through the anomalous dimension @xmath49 .",
    "indeed , this perturbative qcd dependence plays the role of the sudakov form factors in a bfkl - like model .",
    "it acquires also a different , faster , energy dependence through the dependence on @xmath50 in .    using concretely the parameters from the fit to the hera data  @xcite , one finds the following expression for the couplings and propagators of the hard gluon exchanges : @xmath51^{2 }   & = &   \\frac{8\\pi}{6\\mu_h^2 } \\ \\times \\",
