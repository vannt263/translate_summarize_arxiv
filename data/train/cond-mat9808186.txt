    "the physics of a two - dimensional electron system ( 2des ) in a magnetic field is in many respects unique .",
    "since the degeneracy of the discrete landau levels increases in proportion to the magnetic field strength , all electrons can be accommodated in the lowest landau level ( lll ) for sufficiently strong fields .",
    "a landau level then behaves , in many respects , like a band of zero width and the system can be regarded as the extreme limit of a strongly correlated narrow - band electronic system . in this paper",
    "we focus on the spin magnetism of the electron system at landau level filling factor @xmath1 corresponding , when the spin degree of freedom is accounted for , to the case of a half - filled ` landau band ' . at this filling factor",
    ", it is known@xcite that , when disorder can be neglected , the ground state of the 2des is ferromagnetic .",
    "we are motivated to study this system because it shares many of the difficulties@xcite , which have confounded attempts to build a complete theory of metallic ferromagnetic systems , yet is free of the troubling but incidental consequences of a complex band structure .",
    "the finite temperature properties of metallic ferromagnets are more involved than those of insulating ferromagnets because of the importance of both spin and charge degrees of freedom , so much so that much early theory was based on misguided attempts to assign magnetic and conducting properties to separate classes of electrons . despite an immense effort and many advances@xcite , no completely satisfactory theory of metallic ferromagnets",
    "progress in understanding metallic ferromagnets has been hampered in part by the quantitative importance of details of the electronic band - structure , which may not be accurately known or may be difficult to render faithfully in going beyond mean - field theories of many - body effects .",
    "the present system has no such difficulties .",
    "our work is also motivated by recent experimental progress .",
    "_ @xcite were able to measure the temperature - dependence of the spin - polarization and nuclear - spin relaxation rates at fixed filling factors around @xmath1 using nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) techniques .",
    "later , manfra _",
    "@xcite extracted the spin magnetization from magneto - optical absorption measurements .",
    "it is our hope that critical comparison between experiment and theory will yield insights with wider relevance to the finite temperature properties of itinerant electron ferromagnets .",
    "it is , however , important to recognize that the 2des at @xmath0 is different from conventional itinerant electron ferromagnets in several important ways .",
    "most importantly , two - dimensionality implies that its spontaneous spin magnetic moment will not survive at finite temperatures ( @xmath2 . ) in addition , the strong magnetic field , which through its coupling to the electron s orbital degrees of freedom produces landau levels , also produces a zeeman coupling to electron s spin degree of freedom . for the most studied 2des",
    "s , those formed at gaas / algaas heterojunctions , the zeeman coupling is quite small compared to both landau level separations and the characteristic interaction energy scale . as we discuss below",
    ", the main effect of zeeman coupling at low temperatures is to cut - off the decrease of the magnetization due to the thermal excitation of very long wavelength spin - waves and mitigate consequences of the system s reduced dimensionality .    the recent experimental work has stimulated two different theoretical approaches , which focus on different aspects of the spin - magnetization physics . read and sachdev@xcite have compared experimental data with large @xmath3 limits of a quantum continuum field theory model , which provides an accurate description of the long - wavelength collective behavior of the electronic spins . in this theory , physical properties are dependent only on the two independent ratios between the thermal energy , @xmath4 , the zeeman coupling strength , @xmath5 , and the spin - stiffness energy , @xmath6 .",
    "recently this work has been extended by timm _",
    "et al._.@xcite the field - theory description is expected@xcite to be accurate at low temperature when the zeeman coupling strength is weak .",
    "this approach achieves reasonable overall agreement between theory and experiment , at least at low temperatures .",
    "our work has somewhat different motivation and follows a different line .",
    "we are interested in addressing the temperature dependence of the underlying electronic structure , as it changes in concert with the change in the spin - magnetization .",
    "hence we focus on the one - particle green s function .",
    "a brief account of some parts of this work has been published previously.@xcite from the green s function we can calculate the electronic spectral function and hence the magnetization , the tunneling density of states , and ( if vertex corrections are neglected ) the nuclear - spin relaxation time .",
    "the approximation we use is one , which accounts for the interaction of quasiparticles with thermally excited spin - waves .",
    "this approximation has deficiencies . at low - temperatures and at low zeeman energies the magnetizations we calculate do not appear to be in quite as good agreement with experiment as magnetizations from large @xmath3 approximations in the field - theory calculations . at medium and high temperatures ,",
    "we do not account systematically for temperature - dependent screening effects which are likely to be important .",
    "some progress in the latter direction has recently been reported by haussmann@xcite , whose bosonized self - consistent random - phase approximation yields satisfying results at high temperatures , but fails at low temperatures .",
    "progress on these fronts , which can be checked by comparison with experiment , may suggest routes toward more generically satisfactory theories of itinerant electron ferromagnets .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we briefly review established results for the ground state and elementary excitations of the 2des at @xmath0 , which will be important for subsequent discussion .",
    "the ground state has all spins aligned by an arbitrarily weak zeeman coupling .",
    "if we neglect landau level mixing , and we do throughout this paper , this state has no pure charge excitations .",
    "its elementary excitations all have a single reversed spin .",
    "it turns out that , in the quantum hall regime , the hartree - fock approximation ( hfa ) is exact for the ground state and the time - dependent hartree - fock approximation is exact for its elementary excitations .",
    "the situation is therefore similar to that for many typical metallic ferromagnets , where there is substantial evidence that the ground state is well described by the hartree - fock - like kohn - sham equations@xcite of the spin - density - functional formalism and that its elementary excitations are well - described by the time - dependent generalization of density - functional theory . in section iii",
    "we discuss the application of the self - consistent hartree - fock approximation ( shf ) at finite temperature .",
    "the failure of this approximation at finite temperatures is analogous to the well known failure of the band theory of magnetism to provide even a rough account of the ordering temperature .",
    "the approximation , on which the present work is based , is discussed in section iv .",
    "we obtain an expression for the electronic self - energy by analytically evaluating a particle - hole ladder summation involving green s functions of opposite spin .",
    "we emphasize that in our microscopic theory , it is essential to account for screening even in the low - temperature limit .",
    "section v discusses results for the spin magnetization , the spin - lattice relaxation rate , and the temperature dependent 2d-2d tunneling @xmath7 relation , all based on this self - energy approximation . in this section",
    "we also compare our results with available experiments , with other approximate theories , and with data from finite size numerical calculations of the magnetization and the magnetic susceptibility .",
    "we conclude that it is necessary to account for the finite thickness of the quantum well in comparing with experiment and that the magnetization will be overestimated at high temperatures by models , which do not account for electronic itinerancy .",
    "we predict the occurrence of a sharp peak , with strength approximately proportional to temperature , in the tunneling @xmath7 relation at when @xmath8 is close to the zero - temperature spin - splitting . in section",
    "vi we discuss some aspects of our calculation which point to difficulties in developing a completely satisfactory microscopic theory .",
    "finally , we conclude in section vii with a brief summary .",
    "in this paper we deal with a two - dimensional electron system where the electrons are subject to a constant perpendicular magnetic field of strength @xmath9 .",
    "we are particularly interested in the situation at filling factor @xmath10 so that the number of electrons in the system ( @xmath3 ) equals the number of single - particle orbitals available in each landau level ; @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath12 is the area of the two - dimensional system and @xmath13 is the magnetic flux quantum .",
    "one of the underlying assumptions in our model is that the landau level separation is large enough that we can ignore fluctuations in which electrons occupy higher orbital landau levels .",
    "this requires that the zeeman gap and the interaction strength be sufficiently small in comparison to @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the cyclotron frequency .",
    "the microscopic hamiltonian in the landau gauge ( @xmath16 ) is then@xcite    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the interaction coupling constant , @xmath19 is the zeeman energy , and @xmath20 , ( @xmath21 ) are the momenta in @xmath22-direction .",
    "the magnetic length @xmath23 is used as the unit of length below . when landau - level mixing is neglected",
    "the kinetic energy term in the hamiltonian is constant ( @xmath24 ) and is therefore neglected . in eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) , @xmath25 is the number operator for an electron with spin @xmath26 .",
    "we choose @xmath27 as the direction parallel to the external magnetic field .    in the landau",
    " gauge the two  particle matrix element is given by@xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the fourier transform of the effective 2d coulomb interaction , which may include modifications to account for the finite thickness of the quantum well containing the electrons or , as we discuss below , the _ ad hoc _ incorporation of screening effects .",
    "the interaction vertex , shown graphically in fig .",
    "[ vert ] , is a function only of @xmath30 , the momentum transfer due to the interaction , and @xmath31 , the momentum difference of the interacting particles . in the physically realistic case of long - range coulomb interactions between the electrons",
    "it is necessary to incorporate a neutralizing positive background by setting @xmath32 .",
    "note that the interaction term is similar to that of a one - dimensional interacting fermion model with spin - split bands of zero width .",
    "however , in the present case @xmath33 depends not only on the transferred momentum @xmath34 , but also on the momentum difference of the incoming or outgoing particles . this would be true even if we choose a hard core interaction in real space @xmath35 .",
    "for this model , the matrix element @xmath36 becomes @xmath37 .    unlike most interacting electron systems , screening of mutual interactions does not play a major role in the correlation physics of a quantum hall ferromagnet , at least at low temperatures .",
    "in fact , static screening in this limit is weak because of the gap for charged excitations of the ground state .",
    "nevertheless , we obtain below the somewhat surprising result that the electron self - energy has a weak divergence if screening is completely neglected .",
    "for that reason we allow for the _ ad hoc _ inclusion of screening effects in our calculations by substituting for the fourier transform of the coulomb interaction , @xmath38 , the local static screening form @xmath39 .",
    "the constant value assigned to the screening wave vector @xmath40 is discussed below .",
    "the green s functions we calculate at a particular temperature depend , up to an overall energy scale , only on the ratio @xmath41 . at typical field strengths",
    "this ratio is small , even though @xmath42 varies approximately as @xmath43 while @xmath5 is proportional to @xmath44 . for example@xcite at a magnetic field of @xmath45 , @xmath46 .",
    "thus we will be interested primarily in the case where the interaction term dominates over the one  particle spin - dependent term .",
    "we now briefly recount some known results for the ground state and low  lying excitations of the strong field hamiltonian .",
    "we start by considering the case of vanishing zeeman coupling .",
    "if the interaction is of the hard - core type , the ground state at filling factor @xmath10 can be determined@xcite by identifying zero energy eigenstates of the positive definite hamiltonian .",
    "it turns out that these must be the product of the the slater determinant ( @xmath47 ) constructed from all @xmath48 one - particle orbitals in the lowest landau level and a many - particle spinor .",
    "the antisymmetry property of the many - fermion wavefunction then requires that the spinor be completely symmetric . from this",
    "it follows that it has total spin quantum number @xmath49 . by this argument",
    "we are able to establish with some rigor that the ground state at @xmath1 is a strong ferromagnet , in agreement@xcite with the hartree - fock approximation discussed in the following section and , if we regard the degenerate landau level as analogous to an open atomic shell , with hund s rule arguments .",
    "an infinitesimal zeeman coupling selects from this spin multiplet a ground state , in which all spins are aligned ; for a zeeman field in the @xmath50 direction the ground state has @xmath51 and the non - degenerate ground state wavefunction is given exactly by the only state in the @xmath1 many - fermion hilbert space , which has these quantum numbers : @xmath52 finite size exact diagonalization calculations@xcite can be used to establish that these conclusions remain valid for the realistic case of coulomb interactions .",
    "the simplest neutral excitations of the ferromagnetic ground state are those with a single reversed spin .",
    "it turns out that it is possible to analytically solve for the wavefunctions and eigenenergies of these excited states@xcite .",
    "the normalized eigenstates may be labeled by a wavevector @xmath53 and in second quantized notation are given by @xmath54 the operator relating this state to the ground state is proportional to the fourier transform of the projection of the spin - lowering operator onto the lowest landau level : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is @xmath57 projected onto the lll .",
    "these states appear to be similar to the single magnon states of a localized - spin ferromagnet , but there is an important distinction , which is most easily explained by considering a finite size system .",
    "the dimension of the @xmath58 subspace is @xmath59 , since there are @xmath3 possible states for the minority spin electron and @xmath3 possible states for the majority spin hole .",
    "it is possible to show@xcite that for a finite size quantum hall system , the number of inequivalent values of the wavevector @xmath60 is also @xmath61 .",
    "since there is one wavevector for each state and translational invariance decouples states with different wavevectors , the eigenstates can be constructed by symmetry arguments alone .",
    "this should be contrasted with the case of localized spin heisenberg ferromagnets for which single spin - flip states can also be constructed by symmetry arguments alone , but the number of such states is only @xmath3 . the much larger number of states in the present problem occurs because of the possibility in itinerant electron systems of changing the orbital occupied by an electron whose spin has been reversed .",
    "the nature of the single spin - flip excitations of quantum hall ferromagnets gradually changes from having collective spin wave character at long wavelengths to having single - particle character at larger wavevectors.@xcite .",
    "this property is reflected by the dispersion relation@xcite for single spin - flip states : @xmath62 where the quantity@xcite @xmath63 eq .",
    "( [ aofk ] ) is easy to understand.@xcite it represents the attractive interaction between a minority spin electron and a majority spin hole , quantum mechanically smeared over their respective cyclotron orbits , and separated in real space by @xmath64 .",
    "the attractive interaction contributes negatively to the excitation energy .",
    "this magnetoexcitonic picture of spin - flip excitations is especially appropriate when the electron - hole separation exceeds the cyclotron orbit size , _",
    "i.e. _ when @xmath65 .",
    "we use this picture in section iv to interpret our result for the interaction between electrons and spin - waves .",
    "the gap for creating infinitely separated electron - hole pairs , @xmath66 , is associated with the incompressible@xcite property of quantum hall states .",
    "the property @xmath67 is required by spin - rotation invariance of the interaction hamiltonian . for small @xmath68",
    "the excitations are collective in character and @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the spin - stiffness parameter , which appears in field theory phenomenologies . in fig .",
    "[ disp ] we plot @xmath71 and the above long - wavelength approximation for the case of a weakly screened coulomb interaction .",
    "the elementary charged excitations of the @xmath72 are also known exactly : @xmath73 these single slater determinant states are the maximally spin - polarized states with @xmath74 and have energies @xmath75 and @xmath76 , respectively .",
    "explicit expressions for the hartree - fock energies are given in the following section .",
    "recently it has become clear that for systems with weak zeeman energies , charged skyrmion@xcite excitations can have lower energies than these states .",
    "however , as we discuss below , skymion states will have little spectral weight in the one - particle green s function .",
    "in anticipation of subsequent sections we discuss the hartree - fock approximation using the lexicon of the imaginary time thermodynamic green s function technique.@xcite when only the one  particle zeeman term is retained in eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) the thermal green s function ( gf ) @xmath77 is given by @xmath78 where @xmath79 is a fermion matsubara frequency , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 ( @xmath82 for @xmath83 , @xmath84 for @xmath85 ) is the single - particle energy measured from the chemical potential . in the strong magnetic field limit , translational invariance implies@xcite not only that the green s function is diagonal in the momentum labels of the landau gauge states , but also that the diagonal elements are independent of momentum .",
    "this general property leads to thermodynamic green s functions , which depend only on matsubara frequency and spin .",

    "it is sufficient to specify the difference of majority and minority spin filling factors , @xmath319 .",
    "following this procedure requires that we solve an equation of the form @xmath320 , where @xmath321 incorporates the entire functional dependence on the r.  h.  s.  of eq.([m3 ] ) ) . at the same time , we modify the hf quasiparticle energy accordingly : @xmath322 together with eq .",

    "the smaller magnetization values are in better accord with experiment .",
    "the improvement probably does reflect a partial accounting of omissions of the elementary electron spin - wave scattering theory",
    ". however , the abrupt decrease of the magnetization toward non - interacting electron values at temperature values @xmath324 is certainly unphysical . not surprisingly , this _ ad hoc _ procedure does not provide satisfying results . a more elaborate attempt at a self - consistent scheme , in which the full set of equations  ( [ system ] ) , was solved self - consistently has been explored by haussmann@xcite and proved to be equally unsatisfying",
    ".    some hints at possible routes toward a more accurate theory can be found in examinations of the transverse susceptibility of a quantum hall ferromagnet .",
    "it is remarkable@xcite that in the lll , this quantity can be expressed exactly as a geometric series of of irreducible particle - hole bubbles ( @xmath325 ) @xmath326 where @xmath327 is independent of frequency . in the generalized random - phase approximation",
    ", @xmath325 is approximated by a bubble with hartree - fock propagators .",

    "@xmath329 in the rpa - expression for @xmath330 we have set @xmath331 and the gf s are approximated by the shf - gf s . therefore it is not surprising that any improvement of @xmath332 beyond the shf - gf makes a change of @xmath333 necessary in order to satisfy the goldstone theorem condition @xmath334 .      in any electronic system ,",
    "screening of electron - electron interactions plays an important role in the many - particle physics .",
    "the simplest approximation for the dynamically screened interaction is the rpa , which , for the present problem , takes the form : @xmath335 with the polarization function approximated by @xmath336 in this approximation , landau level degeneracy is responsible for polarization functions , which vanish at non - zero matsubara frequencies . at @xmath337 , we find that @xmath338 in the long wavelength limit this leads to the following expression for the temperature dependent screening wavevector at @xmath1 : @xmath339 the inclusion of interaction effects in the hf - energies plays an important role in the temperature dependence of @xmath40 implied by this equation . at low temperatures",
    "the screening wavevector , @xmath340 , is extremely small .",
    "the limited utility of this screening approximation is evidenced by the discontinuous dependence of @xmath40 on temperature found when eq .",
    "( [ scr3 ] ) is solved numerically .",
    "additional insight into screening in the static long - wavelength limit can be obtained by using thomas - fermi theory in which @xmath341 where @xmath342 is the compressibility , @xmath142 is the particle density and @xmath343 .",
    "if we neglect the dependence of the spectral function on the chemical potential @xmath344 and exploit particle - hole symmetry at @xmath10 , we obtain @xmath345 this is an implicit equation for @xmath40 since @xmath172 itself depends on @xmath92 , which again depends on @xmath346 and thus on @xmath40 ( see ( [ aofk ] ) ) . with this equation",
    "we can use the improved spectral density of the spin wave - theory to estimate the approximate magnitude of wavevector @xmath40 at a given temperature . rather than solving self - consistently for @xmath40 at each temperature ,",
    "we have fixed @xmath40 at two values and used eq .",
    "( [ scr5 ] ) to find those temperatures at which these values are self - consistent . as discussed in the previous section ,",
    "this procedure is adequate given the relatively weak sensitivity of our results at low and moderate temperatures to the value used for @xmath40 . at higher temperatures ,",
    "screening is likely to be important since stronger screening causes a flattening of the spin wave dispersion , which leads in turn to more magnetization suppression , smaller exchange splittings , more mobile charges , and hence still stronger screening .",
    "the high temperature expansion of the magnetization gives us some insight into the validity of our approximations and stresses the importance of screening at higher temperatures .",
    "however , these results are of rather theoretical interest because at large temperatures excitations to higher orbital landau levels become more and more probable and our restriction to the lll becomes questionable .    in principle , the many - body perturbation theory expansion for the thermodynamic potential provides a systematic order by order expansion in powers of the interaction strength over the bare zeeman gap , or the temperature or combinations thereof .",
    "however , the long range of the coulomb interaction gives rise to divergent diagrams and complicates issues again ; for example a logarithmically divergent contribution to the magnetization appears at third order in interaction strength , which can be traced back to the divergent second order bubble diagram for the self - energy .",
    "a systematic way to circumvent this problem is to expand in terms of interactions , which are screened by infinite order bubble diagram partial summations . rather than",
    "pursue this line , we have attempted to gain some insight from perturbative expansions by performing the expansion up to third order in @xmath347 for the case of hard - core interaction model with @xmath348 @xcite .",
    "the leading term of the high temperature expansion for the spin magnetization is identical to the same term for free particles , _",
    "i.  e.  _ the lowest order term in the expansion of @xmath349 .",
    "as mentioned previously , this limit shows that the heisenberg model , which yields a magnetization that is twice of this value , fails once itinerancy becomes important .",
    "our calculations are based on the linked - cluster coupling - constant - integration expansion of the thermodynamic potential@xcite .",
    "the leading correction , which is quadratic in @xmath347 , is determined solely by the exchange integral @xmath350 and leads to an increase of the spin magnetization .",
    "we have carried this expansion out to third order and find that @xmath351 note that the @xmath352 term also contributes positively to the magnetization . fig .",
    "[ hight3 ] shows @xmath353 vs.  @xmath354 at high temperatures .",
    "we can see from this figure that beyond leading order interaction contributions become important for @xmath256 smaller than @xmath355 . for comparison the results from exact diagonalizations for fixed particle numbers",
    "are given , which show the right slope but exhibit finite size corrections of the expected order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "obviously the importance of correlations in this system persists to high temperatures .",
    "this property is a key in validating the use of models , which correctly describe only collective fluctuations in magnetization , even when @xmath356 is not small compared to underlying interaction energy scales .",
    "in this paper we report on a study of the one - particle green s function of a quantum hall system at filling factor @xmath10 .",
    "the ground state of the two - dimensional electron system in this case is a strong ferromagnet .",
    "many analogies exist between the properties and the theoretical description of this system and conventional metallic ferromagnets . at @xmath10 the ground state and the elementary excitations of quantum hall ferromagnets",
    "are given exactly by time - dependent hartree - fock theory .",
    "this success is analogous to the success of band theory in describing the ground state and both collective and particle - hole elementary excitations of band ferromagnets . at finite temperatures , however ,",
    "we show that hartree - fock theory fails qualitatively for quantum hall ferromagnets , just as band theory fails for metallic ferromagnets .",
    "our work is based on an improved approximation for the electron self - energy , which describes the scattering of fermionic quasiparticles off the spin - wave collective excitations composed of coherent combinations of spin - flip particle - hole excitations .",
    "this perturbative approximation is equivalent to ones , which have been used@xcite for models of itinerant electron ferromagnets at finite temperatures .",
    "here we have the advantage that complicated band - structures do not confuse the comparison of theory and experiment .",
    "we find that at intermediate temperatures where the density of spin - wave excitations is high , although our approximation gives a huge improvement over hartree - fock theory , it still overestimates the magnetization by nearly a factor of two .",
    "we attribute this failure to the neglect of interactions between spin - waves in our approximation .",
    "nevertheless , we expect that the qualitative physics predicted by our approximation is correct . on the basis of our calculations",
    "we predict that a sharp peak will occur in 2d-2d tunneling current when the bias energy @xmath8 is approximately equal to the spin - splitting and that the strength of this peak will be approximately proportional to temperature at low @xmath108 .",
    "this peak is due to fluctuations in the direction of the exchange field , which separates the energy of majority and minority spin quasiparticles .",
    "we have recently argued@xcite that in metallic ferromagnets , this mechanism is responsible for the temperature dependence of magnetoresistance in ferromagnetic tunnel junctions . in that case",
    ", however , the mechanism can not be directly verified by tunneling experiments because the width of the quasiparticle bands is comparable to their exchange - spin - splitting .",
