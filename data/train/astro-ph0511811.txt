    "the startrack population synthesis code was initially developed for the study of double compact object mergers in the context of gamma - ray burst ( grb ) progenitors ( belczynski , bulik & rudak 2002b ) and gravitational radiation inspiral sources ( belczynski , kalogera & bulik 2002c , hereafter bkb02 ) .",
    "startrack has undergone major updates and revisions in the last few years . with this code",
    "we are able to evolve isolated ( not dynamically interacting ) single stars and binaries for a wide range of initial conditions .",
    "the input physics incorporates our latest knowledge of processes governing stellar evolution , while the most uncertain aspects are parameterized to allow for systematic error analysis . during the code development ,",
    "special emphasis was placed on the compact object populations : white dwarfs ( wds ) , neutron stars ( nss ) , and black holes ( bhs ) .",
    "the input physics currently includes all major processes important for the formation and evolution of compact objects . among other things",
    "we have developed fast procedures to treat and diagnose various types of mass transfer episodes ( including phases of thermal timescale and dynamically unstable mass transfer leading to common envelopes ) .",
    "we also compute tidal effects on orbital evolution , angular momentum losses due to magnetic braking and gravitational radiation , as well as mass loss from stellar winds and during mass transfer phases .",
    "rejuvenation of binary components is taken into account .",
    "the full orbital evolution of binaries is also computed , including angular momentum and mass loss .",
    "supernovae ( sne ) and compact object formation are also treated in detail .",
    "the new version of startrack presented here has already been tested and used in many applications .",
    "belczynski & taam ( 2004a ) studied the formation of ultrashort period x - ray binaries and they also demonstrated that the faint x - ray galactic center population can neither be explained by quiescent ns / bh transients nor by hard / faint wind - fed sources ( belczynski & taam 2004b ) .",

    "belczynski , bulik & ruiter ( 2005b ) tested different models of type  ia sn progenitors , arriving at the conclusion that the double degenerate scenario most easily reproduces the observed delay times between star formation and type  ia sne .",

    "startrack was also incorporated into a simple stellar dynamics code , allowing the study of the effects of dynamical interactions on binary populations in dense star clusters . in that form",
    "it has been used for the study of binary fractions in globular clusters ( ivanova et al .",
    "2005 ) and an investigation of intermediate - mass bhs in clusters and their connection to ultra - luminous x - ray sources ( blecha et al .",
    ".    among other things startrack has been adapted for the study of accretion powered x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) . in forthcoming papers we will present the synthetic populations of xrbs formed in different stellar environments",
    ". we will start with young starburst galaxies , and move on to spiral and , eventually , old elliptical galaxies . in the next stage it will be possible to compare the models with rapidly improving observations of various x - ray point source populations .",
    "this will offer a new perspective to the study of several uncertain aspects of binary evolution leading to the formation of xrbs .",
    "it may also result in an independent diagnostic of star formation rates for nearby galaxies , since both the numbers and properties of xrbs are directly connected to the star formation history ( see e.g. , grimm , gilfanov & sunyaev 2003 ; gilfanov 2004 ; kim & fabbiano 2004 ; belczynski et al .",

    "we describe the implementations of single star evolution in  2 , binary orbit evolution in  3 , stellar wind mass loss / accretion in  4 , roche lobe overflow calculations in  5 , spatial velocities in  6 , and the assumed distributions of initial parameters in  7 . in  8",

    "the initially more massive ( at zero age main sequence ) binary component is referred to as primary , while its companion as secondary .      the evolution of single stars and non - interacting binary components have remained mostly unchanged since the last published description of the code ( bkb02 ) and therefore we only give a brief outline here .",
    "however , we do point out the new additions and reiterate the modifications to the original formulas which were used as the base for the implementation of single star evolution in startrack .    to evolve single stars from the zero age main sequence ( zams ) until remnant formation ( wd , ns , bh , or a remnant - less supernova ) we employ the analytic formulas of hurley , pols & tout ( 2000 ) .",
    "each star is followed along an evolutionary track specific for its initial mass and metallicity . various wind mass loss rates that vary with the stellar evolutionary stage",
    "are incorporated into the code and their effect on stellar evolution is taken into account .",
    "once the remnant is formed , we terminate the calculations but keep track of the numbers , properties and formation times of a given type of remnant .",

    "( 2000 ) formulas , while we use the models of timmes , woosley & weaver ( 1996 ) to estimate final feni core mass .",
    "the results of timmes et al .",
    "( 1996 , see their fig.2 ) show two distinctive feni core masses ( we use models with the addition of si shell mass ) , below and above initial masses of @xmath19 .",
    "the dichotomy arises from different carbon burning ( convective versus radiative ) the in pre - supernova stellar core . for higher mass progenitors ( @xmath20 )",
    "there is a slow rise in a feni core mass that we approximate with a linear relation .",
    "the final feni core mass for a given co core mass ( @xmath21 ) is obtained from : + @xmath22 + @xmath23 where all masses are expressed in @xmath24 .",
    "the above dependence was obtained for solar metallicity models , but we use it for all compositions considered here ( @xmath25 ; the metallicity range covered by hurley et al .",
    "2000 in fits to the stellar evolution models ) . timmes et al . ( 1996 ) results for metallicity are very similar for zero metallicity .",
    "for example , in the mass range most important for ns formation the core mass changes from @xmath26 ( solar metallicity ) to @xmath27 ( zero metallicity ) .",
    "the differences can be larger for bh progenitors , but then the exact core mass does not play such an important role on the final bh mass , as most bhs form through fall back or direct collapse ( see below ) .",
    "the effects of material fallback ( ejected initially in the sn explosion ) during the star s final collapse are included . for the most massive stars we also allow for the possibility of a silent collapse ( no supernova explosion ) and direct bh formation . for solar metallicity and standard wind mass loss",
    "the compact object masses are obtained from @xmath28 where m is the pre - supernova mass of the star , and @xmath29 is the _ fall - back _ factor , i.e. the fraction ( from 0 to 1 ) of the stellar envelope that falls back .",
    "the value of @xmath29 is interpolated linearly between @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) and @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "the regimes of no fall - back ( @xmath34 ) , partial fall - back ( @xmath35 ) and direct collapse ( @xmath36 ) are estimated from core collapse models of fryer , woosley & hartmann ( 1999 ) and the analysis of fryer & kalogera ( 2001 ) .",
    "we also allow for ns formation through ecs ( e.g. , podsiadlowski et al . 2004 ) . following hurley et al .",
    "( 2000 ) we use the he core mass at the agb base to set the limits for the formation of various co cores . if the he core mass is smaller than @xmath37 the star forms a degenerate co core , and ends up forming a co wd .",
    "if the core is more massive than @xmath38 the star forms a non - degenerate co core with subsequent burning of elements until the formation of a feni core which ultimately collapses to a ns or a bh . stars with cores between @xmath37 and @xmath39 may form partially degenerate co cores . if such a core reaches a critical mass ( @xmath40 , hurley et al .",
    "2000 ) , it ignites co off - center and non - explosively burns co into one , forming a degenerate one core .",
    "if in subsequent evolution the one core increases its mass to @xmath41 the core collapses due to electron capture on mg , and forms ns ( we will refer to a ns formed in this way as ecs ns , as opposed to a regular feni core collapse compact object formation ) . the ecs nss are assumed to have unique masses of @xmath42 . if the one core mass remains below @xmath43 the star forms a one wd .",
    "hurley et al . ( 2000 ) suggested @xmath44 corresponding to @xmath45 for @xmath46 .",
    "later calculations with the same , but updated evolutionary code ( eldridge & tout 2004a , b ) indicated that ecs may occur for higher initial masses ( @xmath47 ) . for our standard model",
    ", we adopt @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) , and this results in ecs ns formation above @xmath50 ( for masses @xmath51 the one core does not reach @xmath43 and a one wd is formed ) .",
    "it is noted that binary evolution through rlof , may either decrease the initial the mass of the zams star required to form the core of mass @xmath37 ( due to rejuvenation ) or increase it ( due to mass loss ) .",
    "therefore , binary evolution effectively leads to wider initial progenitor mass for ecs ns formation .",
    "also metallicity , and wind mass loss influences the ecs ns formation range .",
    "the remnant masses calculated above express the mass of baryons , and for ns / bh remnants we convert them to gravitational masses ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "we use the quadratic relation @xmath53 for neutron stars ( lattimer & yahil 1989 ; see also timmes et al .",
    "1996 ) , while for black holes we simply approximate the gravitational mass with @xmath54 the resulting remnant mass spectrum covers a wide range of masses and is presented in figure  [ mfin ] .    in summary ,",
    "helium wds form from progenitors of initial masses in range @xmath55 , co wds from @xmath56 , and one wd are formed in range @xmath57 .",
    "neutron stars formed through ecs ( @xmath58 )",
    "have mass of @xmath59 . regular core - collapse ( of feni cores ) ns are formed with mass @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) ; @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) and for higher initial progenitor masses nss form up to adopted maximum ns mass : @xmath64 . in our standard model",
    "we adopt @xmath65 , and above @xmath66 bhs are are formed .",
    "it is found that single stars may form bhs up to @xmath67 for solar metallicity ( @xmath46 ) and @xmath68 for lower metallicities ( @xmath69 ) , which is consistent with the current observations of the most massive bhs in galactic x - ray transients .",
    "the initial - final mass relation described above and presented in figure  [ mfin ] holds only for single stellar evolution and for a specific metallicity ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "effects of binary evolution , in particular mass loss / gain in rlof , may alter the initial - final mass relation in two ways .",
    "first , a compact object may have a different mass ; higher if a progenitor ( or a compact object itself ) accreted mass or smaller if a progenitor lost mass in rlof .",
    "second , the initial mass limits for formation of a given type of compact object are not sharp , since with binary mass loss / gain stars of various initial masses may form compact objects of a given mass and type .",
    "these limits are blurred by binary evolution .",
    "the mass estimates of neutron stars in relativistic double neutron star binaries point to a ns formation mass of @xmath70 ( thorsett & chakrabarty 1999 ) .",
    "it is also suggestive that the ns mass in vela x-1 is high @xmath71 .",
    "since vela x-1 is a high - mass x - ray binary , system with wind - fed accretion ( small mass capture efficiency ) and a massive star donor ( short lifetime ) , the ns probably has not accumulated much mass , and the measured mass is close to its formation mass . our adopted model for ns formation masses ( timmes et al .",
    "1996 ) falls in qualitative agreement with these observations .",
    "finally we allow compact object masses to increase through accretion in binary systems .",
    "accretion and mass accumulation onto wds is described in detail in  5.7 . for ns",
    "we need to adopt a maximum ns mass , over which ns collapses to bh .",
    "such a collapse may lead to a short - hard gamma - ray burst event .",
    "depending on the preferred equation of state the maximum ns mass may vary in a wide range ( @xmath72 ) , and in particular may reach @xmath73 if rotation is included ( morrison , baumgarte & shapiro 2004 ) . at the moment the highest measured ns mass is @xmath74 for a millisecond pulsar in psr j0751 + 1807 ; a relativistic binary with helium white dwarf secondary ( nice et .",
    "al . 2005 ) .",
    "as stated above we adopt @xmath65 for our standard model , but we relax this assumption in parameter studies .      the compilation of stellar wind mass loss rates presented in hurley et al.(2000 ) has been expanded to include mass loss from low- and intermediate - mass main sequence stars .",
    "we have adopted the formulas of nieuwenhuijzen & de jager ( 1990 ) to calculate the mass loss rates for main sequence stars below @xmath75 .",
    "although the mass loss from these stars is not large enough to significantly alter the evolution of a mass  losing star , it may play an important role in the formation and evolution of wind - accreting close binaries .",
    "even with small mass transfer rates characteristic for the low- and intermediate - mass main sequence stars , the x - ray luminosities for accreting bhs and nss are high enough to be detected in deep chandra exposures .",
    "a number of faint point x - ray sources were discovered in the galactic center with deep exposures ( wang , gotthelf & lang 2002 ; muno et al .",
    "2003 ) , some of which may be explained in terms of wind - fed close binaries ( pfahl , rappaport & podsiadlowski 2002a ; bleach 2002 ; willems & kolb 2003 ; belczynski & taam 2004b ) .      a compilation of updated observational data on rotational velocities is used to initiate the stellar spins on the zams .",
    "the spin evolution is followed as detailed here for single stars and in  3 for binary components . in order to obtain a functional form of the relation of the equatorial rotational velocity and stellar mass",
    ", we used the compilation of rotational velocities of stauffer & hartmann ( 1986 ) for stars in open clusters .",
    "the difference between cluster and field stars is quite small for massive stars ( with a maximum difference of @xmath76 for intermediate b - type stars ) , but can be as high as 40% for stars later than f - type , with field stars having systematically lower rotational velocities .",
    "the mean rotational velocity @xmath77 was determined from the projected velocity ( @xmath78 ) assuming a random distribution of angles with @xmath79 .",
    "we fitted @xmath77 as a function of stellar mass , and we obtained the following empirical functional form    @xmath80    where , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 ( errors are at the @xmath85 level ) .",
    "we stress that this is only an empirical functional form of the equatorial rotational velocity as a function of stellar mass . in fig  [ fig03 ]",
    "we present the observational data from stauffer & hartmann ( 1986 ) , together with the best fit function . in the bottom panel of this figure",
    "we also show the ratio of the stauffer & hartmann ( 1986 ) data and the model .",
    "the spin angular momentum of a star may be expressed as @xmath86 where , @xmath87 is the angular rotational velocity and the coefficient @xmath88 varies as the star evolves and its internal structure changes ( e.g. , it is 2/5 for a solid sphere and 2/3 for a spherical shell ) . following hurley et al .",
    "( 2000 ) we consider two structural components for each star : a core and an envelope .",
    "the spins of these two components may decouple in the course of evolution , although we keep them coupled in our standard model calculations .",
    "the spin angular momentum of a star is then @xmath89 \\omega_{\\rm i } \\label{sin02}\\ ] ]    we use different values than hurley at al .",
    "( 2000 ) for the internal structure coefficient @xmath88 . for stars with no clear core - envelope structure ( @xmath90 ) we use simple polytropic models ( e.g. , lai , rasio & shapiro 1993 ) with @xmath91 and @xmath92 for low - mass and high - mass objects , respectively , giving @xmath93 for giants with a clear separation between core and envelope ( @xmath94 ) and additionally for stars in the hertzsprung gap ( @xmath95 ) we use detailed models of giant envelopes ( hurley et al .",
    "2000 ) and for the core we apply a polytropic model with @xmath91 to obtain @xmath96    conservation of the spin angular momentum of a star is used then to determine its rotational velocity .",
    "additional angular momentum losses from magnetic braking ( see  3.2 ) are also taken into account .",
    "stars with convective and radiative envelopes respond differently to various physical processes ( e.g. , magnetic braking , tidal interactions or mass loss ) .",
    "stars that have a significant convective envelope are : low - mass h - rich ms stars ( @xmath97 ) within the mass range of @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the maximum mass for a ms star to develop a convective envelope ; giant - like stars ( @xmath100 ) independent of their mass and evolved low - mass helium stars ( @xmath101 ) below @xmath102 . for stars crossing h - rich hertzsprung gap ( @xmath103 ) and core helium burning stars ( @xmath104 we obtained detailed models using the code described in ivanova & taam ( 2004 ) to check how far from hayashi line stars cross the border between radiative and convective envelopes ; stars cooler than @xmath105 have convective envelopes , while hotter stars have radiative envelopes .",
    "we have also examined the models presented by schaller et al . ( 1992 ) for both solar metallicity and @xmath106 and have found that the above temperature cut works rather well for these two classes of stars for both metallicities .",
    "ms stars with masses below @xmath107 are fully convective .",
    "the value of @xmath99 ) depends strongly on metallicity @xmath108 values of @xmath99 in metallicity range @xmath109 are obtained from a fit to detailed evolutionary calculations ( ivanova 2006 ) .",
    "all other stars ( e.g. , @xmath110  helium stars in the hertzsprung gap ) are assumed to have radiative envelopes .",
    "we use the original hurley et al .",
    "( 2002 ) formulas to calculate the mass and depth of convective envelopes .",
    "we assume that low - mass evolved helium stars ( @xmath101 ) below @xmath102 ( as opposed to @xmath111 in hurley et al .",
    "2000 ) expand and form deep convective envelopes in their late stages of evolution ( e.g. , ivanova et al . 2003 ; dewi & pols 2003 ) .",
    "helium stars with convective envelopes are subject to strong tidal interactions ( convective tides as opposed to radiative damping , see  3.3 ) , and if found in an interacting binary , they may alter significantly the fate of a given system .",
    "all helium stars ( @xmath112 ) may be subject to stable rlof .",
    "however , in dynamically unstable cases we assume a binary component merger in the case of a hems donor ( @xmath17 ) and a helium hertzsprung gap donor ( @xmath113 ; e.g. , ivanova et al . 2003 ) or we follow a given system through a ce phase for evolved he star donors ( @xmath101 and test whether the system survives or merges .",
    "the examination of rlof stability and development of dynamical instability are described in detail in  5 ) .",
    "the treatment of helium stars is important , for example , in later stages of evolution leading to double neutron star formation .",
    "the immediate consequences , leading to the formation of a new class of close double neutron stars , were discussed in belczynski & kalogera ( 2001 ) and belczynski , bulik & kalogera ( 2002a ) .",
    "the formation of the new class of ( ultracompact ) double neutron stars involves helium hertzsprung gap stars initiating ce phase .",
    "now , guided by the better understanding of ce phase survival ( ivanova et al .",
    "2003 ) , we do not allow survival in such cases , and in our reference model both double neutron star merger rates and double neutron star properties have changed ( belczynski et al . 2007 ) .",
    "however , we note that it is still predicted that a significant fraction ( @xmath114 ) of close double neutron star binaries form in very close orbits ( merger times smaller than 100 myr ) . due to significant updates of the code and new observational results on short grbs with double neutron stars suggested as their progenitors ( e.g. , fox et al .",
    "2005 ) new startrack calculations relevant to the double neutron star formation have been performed ( belczynski et al .",
    "2007 ; belczynski et al .",
    ", in prep . )",
    "throughout the course of binary evolution we track the changes in orbital properties . a number of physical processes may be responsible for these changes . in the general case of eccentric orbits",
    "we numerically integrate a set of four differential equations describing the evolution of orbital separation , eccentricity and component spins , which depend on tidal interactions as well as angular momentum losses associated with magnetic braking , gravitational radiation and stellar wind mass losses .",
    "for circular orbits with synchronized components , we can obtain an exact solution for the change of orbital separation using conservation of angular momentum .",
    "losses of angular momentum and/or mass associated with rlof events , magnetic braking and gravitational radiation are taken into account .",
    "we assume that any system entering rlof becomes circularized and synchronized ( if it had not already reached this equilibrium state before rlof ) .",
    "in such a case we circularize to the periastron distance @xmath115 where and @xmath116 mark initial and final values ) , and both components are synchronized to the new mean angular orbital velocity .",
    "non circular orbits and non synchronous rlof cases are important for massive binaries , in which massive stars may remain eccentric / unsynchronized as tidal interactions are not as effective as for low mass stars ( see  3.3 ) . in particular , the vast majority of close ( coalescing ) ns - ns binary progenitors may evolve through such configuration more than once . it should be noted that our prescription ( eq .  [ eccrlof ] ) does not conserve total angular momentum ( i.e. , sum of orbital and spin angular momenta of the components ) .",
    "for most of the cases in double compact object progenitor evolution , our prescription leads to a moderate ( @xmath117 ) loss of angular momentum . for systems which have not been circularized and synchronized before entering rlof there might be substantial mass loss ( e.g. , hut & paczynski 1984 ) , and although this is not taken into account in our calculations , it may also lead to some angular momentum loss .    for some systems , consisting of low mass object ( e.g. ,",
    "a neutron star ) and a massive star ( e.g. , a massive cheb star ) eccentricity is induced by the supernova explosion and once the massive star overfills its roche lobe we circularize / synchronize the system , and this may lead to a slight increase of total angular momentum ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "however , it needs to be stressed that there is no solution that conserves total angular momentum in such cases , as systems evolve toward a darwinian unstable state ( see  3.3 ) and eventually evolve towards a common envelope phase . since the orbital shrinkage of a system with a massive star donor during the common envelope phase is usually dramatic ( @xmath118 orders of magnitude ) , the moderate change of orbital separation prior ce phase ( eq .  [ eccrlof ] ) and its specific magnitude ( in the prescription used ) does not play an important role .",
    "violent processes like sn explosions or common envelope phases are taken into account in binary orbital evolution .",
    "also nuclear evolution of components ( expansion / contraction affecting stellar spins ) is considered . in what follows",
    "we describe the elements used to calculate the orbital evolution .",
    "the orbital angular momentum of the binary and its mean angular velocity are expressed as    @xmath119    @xmath120    where @xmath121 is the gravitational constant .",
    "binary angular momentum loss due to gravitational radiation is estimated for any type of binary following peters ( 1964 )    @xmath122    where , @xmath123 is the speed of light .",

    "three different prescriptions for magnetic braking are incorporated within the startrack code and may be used interchangeably for parameter studies . in what follows",

    "magnetic braking is applied to stars with a significant convective envelope , i.e. , for low - mass h - rich ms stars , h - rich giant - like stars and cool hg and cheb stars ( see  2.3.4 for details ) with the exception of low - mass evolved helium stars for which there is not much known about magnetic fields . for fully convective ms stars ( @xmath124 , @xmath125 ) magnetic braking may also operate , although it has been hypothesized that the braking is suppressed ( rappaport , verbunt & joss 1983 ; zangrilli , tout & bianchini 1997 ) in order to provide an explanation of the observed period gap for cataclysmic variables .",
    "therefore we assume that magnetic braking is not operative for fully convective stars , independent of the prescription used . since massive core helium burning stars , more massive h - rich ms stars , and he - rich ms stars have radiative envelopes , we assume that magnetic braking does not operate in these stars .",

    "studies based on the observations of rapidly rotating stars show that the skumanich relation ( @xmath129 ) is inadequate in this regime and point to a weakening of magnetic braking due to saturation of the dynamo ( andronov , pinsonneault & sills 2003 ) . in this case",
    ", the angular momentum loss rate takes the form @xmath130 where , @xmath131 denotes the component for which magnetic braking is operating , @xmath132  [ @xmath133 is angular velocity , and @xmath134 stands for a critical value of angular velocity above which the angular momentum loss rate enters the saturated regime . if the latter law is used , the saturation is applied only for ms stars and @xmath134 is interpolated from table  1 of andronov et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .",
    "in addition , we also include the form of magnetic braking from the results of a study by ivanova & taam ( 2003 ) . in this latter study , an intermediate form of the angular momentum loss rate",
    "was derived ( @xmath135 ) based on a two component coronal model as applied to the observational data relating stellar activity to stellar rotation .",
    "specifically , we adopt    @xmath136    with @xmath137 .",
    "this law is used for the startrack standard model calculations .",
    "the evolution of the orbital parameters ( @xmath138 ) as well as component spins ( @xmath132 , @xmath139 ) driven by tidal interactions of binary components is computed in the standard equilibrium - tide , weak- friction approximation ( zahn 1977 , 1989 ) , following the formalism of hut ( 1981 ) .",

    "following hurley , tout & pols ( 2002 ) , we calculate that constant for either the equilibrium tide with convective damping ( @xmath155 ) or the dynamical tide with radiative damping ( @xmath156 ) .",

    "convective damping is applied ( see  2.3.4 for details on convective / radiative envelopes ) .",
    "we do not calculate tides on stellar remnants , e.g. , on wds ( @xmath158 ) .",
    "the constant for convective damping is obtained from @xmath159 where @xmath160 is the mass contained in the convective envelope of component @xmath131 .",

    "_ one important consequence of tidal interactions in massive binaries is the possible occurrence of the darwin instability ( e.g. , lai et al.1993 ) .",
    "when the more massive component is spinning slowly compared to the orbital rate of its companion , tidal forces will tend to spin it up , leading to loss of orbital angular momentum ( orbital decay ) .",
    "usually this orbital decay will stop when synchronization is established .",
    "however , if , in the synchronized state , more than a third of the total binary angular momentum would be in the component spins , then synchronization can never be reached and the components will continue to spiral in .",
    "we follow this process until one of the binary components overflows its roche lobe . in all cases rlof is found to be dynamically unstable (  5.1 and  5.2 ) and the system goes through a ce phase leading either to a merger , or further orbital decay with envelope ejection (  5.4 ) .",

    "we also note that above some critical ( very high ) accretion rate , nuclear burning will start on the wd surface",
    ". this can be much more radiatively efficient than the gravitational energy release and the above relations break down .",
    "if the mass transfer rate is higher than @xmath187 we expect the excess material to leave the system from the vicinity of the accreting object and thus to carry away the specific angular momentum of the accretor .",
    "the angular momentum loss associated with a given systemic mass loss in a rlof phase is obtained from @xmath188 where @xmath189 is the distance between the accretor and binary center of mass , and @xmath190 is the mass transfer rate ( donor rlof rate , see eq .",

    "whenever coeval binary populations in nearby clusters are observed to constrain the circularization rate , it is found that standard tidal dissipation theories do not match the data ( see meibom & mathieu 2005 for a recent review ) . in all cases",
    "an increase in the tidal dissipation rate appears necessary ( claret & cunha 1997 ; terquem et al .",

    "the results , presented in two following subsections , confirm that tidal dissipation , at least in case of convective stars , is more effective than predicted by our simple theory .",
    "therefore , in all our standard model calculations , we will use an increased rate of tidal dissipation for convective stars , corresponding to @xmath523 , while using standard dissipation for radiative stars @xmath524 , but we will also allow for even more effective tidal dissipation rates in our parameter studies ( all the way to @xmath525 and @xmath526 ) .",

    "it was expected and then confirmed that the cutoff period ( @xmath527 , the longest period of a circular binary ) should increase with the age of the cluster .",
    "the tidal dissipation depends strongly on the orbital separation and therefore the wider , longer - period binaries will take a greater time to circularize . in principle , with knowledge of the initial conditions in a given cluster , the observed value of the cutoff period may be used to calibrate the efficiency of tidal interactions . in practice , binaries within a given cluster form with eccentricities , separations and angular momenta which are not precisely known .",
    "in addition , the observed samples may suffer from small number statistics ( the observed cutoff periods are only lower limits ) , rendering such a calibration quite uncertain .",
    "however , we can use the cutoff - period observations to provide at least an order of magnitude estimate for the factor by which any standard theoretical estimate must be increased .",
    "m67 is an old open cluster with an age of @xmath528gyr and observed cutoff period of @xmath529d ( mathieu , latham & griffin 1990 ; mathieu et al .",
    "1992 ) and a solar metallicity stellar population ( janes & phels 1994 ) .",
    "the period was estimated for a sample of ms binaries with components close to the cluster turnoff mass .",
    "recently meibom & mathieu ( 2005 ) proposed a new way to estimate the point of transition from circular to eccentric systems . instead of a simple cutoff period , they use a new estimator called the `` tidal circularization period . ''",
    "this period is found from fitting a special function which mimics the tidal circularization isochrone of the most frequently occurring eccentric binary orbits for a given cluster .",
    "they find that the tidal circularization period for m67 is @xmath530d .",
    "several calculations , with different efficiencies of tidal dissipation , were performed to try to reproduce the binary population of the open cluster m67 . in each calculation",
    "we have evolved @xmath531 binaries at solar metallicity with component masses in the @xmath359 range , requiring that the mass ratio be greater than 0.5 .",
    "the limits are somewhat arbitrary , but chosen to include the population of bright ms stars observed in m67 .",

    ", the orbital decay may be directly connected to the tidal interaction of the hmxb components .",
    "the secondary is a massive star , and the source of tidal dissipation is radiative damping .",
    "therefore , we use lmc x-4 to check the efficiency of tidal interactions for radiative envelopes ( @xmath540 ) . the rotation of the massive component decreases with time as it expands during its evolution . on the other hand , the tidal forces act to synchronize the massive component , resulting in loss of orbital energy and angular momentum , i.e. , decay of the orbit .",
    "if , in fact , lmc x-4 is a wind - fed system and not in rlof , then the massive star must be smaller than its roche lobe @xmath541 .",
    "a @xmath539 star exceeds that size , while still on ms , after about @xmath542myr of evolution ( from the zams ) .",

    "the radius of the @xmath539 star ( @xmath543 ) increases from @xmath545 on zams to @xmath546 at the end of ms phase , which takes @xmath547 myr .",
    "based on the roche lobe radius of secondary for 1.4 day orbit the secondary fills its roche lobe at @xmath548 myr , which is close to the end of ms phase . since the primary has already evolved and has formed a ns , a significant amount of time must have elapsed since the binary formation .",

    "we adopt the above empirical description for transient sources since the relation between the quiescent , outburst , bolometric luminosities , and duty cycle are uncertain due to the mass loss from the system during the outburst state .",
    "evidence for such mass loss in the form of jets and/or wind have been observed in , for example , a galactic bh transient grs 1915 - 105 ( dhawan , muno & remillard 2005 ; truss & done 2006 ) .",

    "the compact object either accretes from the wind of the supergiant , or in brighter systems through rlof ( possibly atmospheric but not always ) via an accretion disk .",
    "if indeed some hmxbs are confirmed to be evolving through stable rlof , it should pose a useful constraint on the development of a delayed dynamical instability .",

    "the code has been calibrated and tested against different sets of observations and detailed evolutionary calculations and the results are presented here . the updated version of startrack was already used in several studies of compact object binaries and xrbs .",
    "startrack allows for evolution of stellar systems with a wide variety of different initial conditions ( imf , metallicity , star formation history ) and for a number of different evolutionary models , subject to the parametrization of the input physics .",
    "the startrack code can be compared to the bse population synthesis code ( hurley et al .",
    "startrack incorporates the same single star evolutionary formulas ( hurley et al . 2000 ) as the bse code , however we extend the original formulas to _ ( i ) _ include wind mass loss rates from low- and intermediate - mass main sequence stars ( formation of pre - lmxbs , belczynski & taam 2004b ) ; _ ( ii ) _",

    "we also adopt convective tides that are more efficient ( by a factor of 10 - 100 ) based on the observational calibration discussed in section 8.2 .",
    "this will have a significant effect on the evolution of close binaries with low mass ( convective ) stars .",
    "the calculation of x - ray luminosities for transient systems with ns and bh accretors is much more comprehensive in startrack .",
    "we use both the recent theoretical work and observations of low- and high - luminosity x - ray sources , to calibrate and test our approach ( belczynski & taam 2004b ; belczynski et al .",
    "the compact object masses formed in core collapse are calculated differently , and in particular we account for possibility of direct bh formation ( no natal kick , no mass loss ) , with maximum bh masses formed reaching @xmath614 depending on metallicity and adopted wind mass loss rates ( e.g. , belczynski et al .",
    "2002 ; belczynski et al .",

    "2000 ) , a result that can not be reconciled with the current estimates of bh masses .",
    "also more recent ( arzoumanian et al . 2002 ; hobbs et al . 2005 ) natal kick distributions are used here as compared to lyne & lorimer ( 1994 ) in bse .",
    "the above will affect the post - sna binary orbit , and subsequent evolution of massive binaries .",
    "for example , the effect of natal kicks on population of double compact objects is rather dramatic and was quantified in belczynski et al .",
    "( 2002c ) .",
    "the treatment of nuclear mass transfer rate is different in the two codes . in bse",
    "it is calculated using a formula that keeps the donor star within its roche lobe .",
    "the formula is calibrated to keep the mass transfer steady . in startrack , we use the radius - mass exponents for the donor and its roche lobe along with an estimate of the evolutionary donor radius change with time to calculate the mass transfer rate ( see sec .",
    "the calibration of the bse prescription is not discussed in detail by hurley et al .",
    "ruiter et al .  ( 2006 ) find that for intermediate polars ( low mass main sequence donors with wd accretors ) the bse code results in mass transfer rates of about 2 orders magnitude lower ( as calculated by liu & li 2006 ) than the rates predicted by startrack and the observations of intermediate polars may indicate ( muno et al .",
    "2006 ) . for low mass binaries ,",
    "we use a different ( less efficient ) magnetic braking law in our standard model . as a result , binary orbits in our model will tend to take longer time to decay and initiate mass transfer , as compared to bse models .",
    "the startrack prescription of mass accumulation onto white dwarfs is quite unique ( see  5.7 ) .",
    "related results of calculations for accretion induced collapse and ns formation were presented by belczynski & taam ( 2004a ) and progenitor models of sn ia by belczynski et al .",
    "( 2005b ) .",
    "on the other hand , the bse code is more fitted to work with dynamical codes , following in detail merger products ( and their evolution ) of various types of binary components . also , the bse code is much faster than the startrack code , and therefore may be used for simulations of larger stellar populations .    in a series of papers that will follow we will address the issues of modeling of xrbs , and will focus on the comparison of synthetic xrb populations with the observed x - ray point source populations in nearby galaxies .",
    "the code is also being used to study populations of binaries with nss and bhs as potential source candidates for ground based interferometric gravitational radiation observatories ( e.g. , geo , ligo , virgo ) as well as populations of less - massive wd binaries for space - based projects ( e.g. , lisa ) .",
    "although a number of physical processes governing single and binary evolution remain highly uncertain , the advances in observational techniques and new results of massive surveys allow now various aspects of stellar evolution to be explored .",
    "we have incorporated several different evolutionary models within startrack ( e.g. , different magnetic braking laws or ce prescriptions ) making possible tests of their validity .",
    "for example , one such test may be based on a comparison of synthetic and observed x - ray luminosity functions for nearby starburst galaxies .",
    "the startrack code described in this paper may be used only for the evolution of isolated stars and binaries , i.e. , in stellar systems in which dynamical interactions are not important ( e.g. , field populations , open clusters ) . however",
    ", a number of interesting studies may be carried out for dense stellar environments , in which both stellar evolution and dynamical interactions play an important role in the formation of compact object binaries . in particular ,",
