    "the recent observations from cosmic microwave background ( cmb hereafter ) satellite , balloon - borne and ground based experiments ( @xcite ) , galaxy redshift surveys @xcite and luminosity distance measurements , have fully confirmed the theoretical predictions of the standard @xmath5cdm cosmological model .",
    "this not only allows stringent constraints on the parameters of the model but can be fruitfully used to constrain non standard physics at the fundamental level , such as classes of elementary particle models predicting a different radiation content in the universe .    in this respect ,",
    "an interesting discrepancy with the expectations of the standard model has recently been uncovered in the small cmb scale measurements of the act @xcite and spt @xcite experiments .",
    "namely , the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom @xmath4 ( see e.g. @xcite for a definition ) has been reported as higher ( at more than two standard deviations ) than the expected standard value of @xmath6 .",
    "relativistic neutrinos species .",
    "the little deviation from @xmath7 takes into account effects from the non - instantaneous neutrino decoupling from the primordial photon - baryon plasma ( see e.g. @xcite ) ] this result has been confirmed by several recent analyses of the act and spt datasets ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "while a confirmation from future measurements is clearly needed , the current preference for @xmath8 is stimulating a growing interest since it could be explained in different ways , including an extra relativistic particle at decoupling ( as light axions or sterile neutrinos ) , extra dimensions , or early dark energy .",
    "( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however it is important to stress that the current bounds on @xmath4 rely on the assumption of a theoretical model .",
    "more recently the dependence of the constraints on @xmath4 on the assumption of a flat universe or a different dark energy component have been investigated by several authors ( @xcite ) . here",
    "we revisit the issue , by obtaining analogous constraints in the framework of a non - standard recombination process .    as expected",
    "( see e.g. @xcite ) a variation of @xmath4 affects the value of the hubble parameter @xmath9 at recombination .",
    "this changes two very important scales in cmb anisotropy physics : the size of the sound horizon and the damping scale at recombination . an approximate expression for the damping scale is given by    @xmath10\\ ] ]    where @xmath11 is the number density of free electrons , @xmath12 is the thompson cross - section , @xmath13 is the scale factor at recombination and @xmath14 is proportional to the ratio between the baryon and photon densities .",
    "it is clear that a change in @xmath9 could be compensated by a change in @xmath11 and @xmath13 in order to keep the same damping scale .",
    "consequently , a change in the recombination process , motivated by some non - standard and unaccounted mechanism , could alter the current conclusions on @xmath4 .",
    "possible changes in the recombination process have been investigated by several authors .",
    "dark matter annihilation , for example , could significantly alter the evolution of the free electron density @xmath11 by the injection of extra - ionizing photons around recombination ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "another possible mechanism , which we consider in this paper , is based on the hypothesis of a change in the fundamental constants of nature , specifically the fine structure constant , @xmath1 .",
    "changing @xmath1 modifies the strength of the electromagnetic interaction and therefore modifies the formation of cmb anisotropies by changing the differential optical depth ( i.e. the scattering rate ) due to thomson scattering between electrons and photons :    @xmath15    where @xmath12 is the thomson cross section , @xmath16 is the free electron fraction dependent on the temperature of the electrons and therefore on the scale factor of the universe @xmath17 . the optical depth @xmath18 is then defined as the integral of the scattering rate over time .",
    "these two combined processes change the temperature at last scattering , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 , the free electron fraction that remains after recombination , both of which influence the cmb anisotropies ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the main imprint on cmb power spectrum is a shift in the modulation of the peak heights by baryon drag determined by the relative density of baryons to photons at @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "a variation in @xmath1 changes the photon diffusion damping length as well and the two effects combined lead to subtle degeneracies between @xmath23 and @xmath4 .",
    "cmb anisotropies are therefore one of the canonical ways of constraining variations in the fine structure constant in the early universe .",
    "they provide a measurement of @xmath1 at the epoch of recombination ( see e.g. @xcite ) , with a current sensitivity the level of @xmath24 . in the most recent analysis , parametrizing a variation in the fine structure constant as @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the standard ( local ) value and @xmath1 is the value during the recombination process , the authors of @xcite used the five year wmap data , finding the constraint @xmath27 at @xmath28 c.l .. meanwhile , a recent analysis of a large dataset of spectroscopic data from the vlt and keck telescopes @xcite is consistent with earlier claims of variations in the value of @xmath1 at parts - per - million level at redshifts @xmath29 .    in view of this and the recent results from act and spt is therefore extremely timely to place new bounds on variations of @xmath1 discussing also the possible degeneracies with @xmath4 .",
    "in this paper we indeed perform this kind of analysis , including also possible variations in the abundance of primordial helium @xmath30 that could similarly change the recombination process . in the next section",
    "we describe the analysis method , in section iii we present our results while in section iv we derive our conclusions .",
    "we perform a cosmomc @xcite analysis combining the following cmb datasets : wmap7 @xcite , acbar @xcite , act @xcite , and spt @xcite , and we analyze datasets out to @xmath31 .",
    "we also include information on dark matter clustering from the galaxy power spectrum extracted from the sdss - dr7 luminous red galaxy sample @xcite .",
    "finally , we impose a prior on the hubble parameter based on the last hubble space telescope observations @xcite .",
    "the analysis method we adopt is based on the publicly available monte carlo markov chain package ` cosmomc ` @xcite with a convergence diagnostic done through the gelman and rubin statistic .",
    "we sample the following six - dimensional standard set of cosmological parameters , adopting flat priors on them : the baryon and cold dark matter densities @xmath32 and @xmath33 , the hubble constant @xmath34 , the optical depth to reionization @xmath18 , the scalar spectral index @xmath35 , and the overall normalization of the spectrum @xmath36 at @xmath37 .",
    "we consider purely adiabatic initial conditions and we impose spatial flatness . as discussed in the introduction we allow for variations in the fine structure constant @xmath25 where @xmath3 is the current , local , value by modifying the recfast recombination subroutine following the procedure described in @xcite .",
    "we also allow for variations in the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom @xmath4 and the primordial helium abundance @xmath30 , otherwise fixed at the values @xmath6 and @xmath38 , respectively . since we are varying also the helium abundance , we considered variations in the fine structure constant also in the process of helium recombination .",
    "a @xmath39 change of @xmath1 for helium recombination changes the cmb angular spectra by less than @xmath40 up to @xmath41 . during reionization the fine structure constant",
    "is fixed to the local standard value @xmath42 .",
    "we account for foregrounds contributions including three extra amplitudes : the sz amplitude @xmath43 , the amplitude of clustered point sources @xmath44 , and the amplitude of poisson distributed point sources @xmath45 .",
    "we marginalize the contribution from point sources only for the act and spt data , based on the templates provided by @xcite .",
    "we quote only one joint amplitude parameter for each component ( clustered and poisson distributed ) .",
    "the sz amplitude is obtained fitting the wmap data with the wmap own template , while for spt and act it is calculated using the @xcite sz template at 148 ghz ; this differs from the analysis performed in @xcite where no sz contribution was considered for the wmap data .",
    "as stated in the previous section , we perform three different analyses always considering the same set of data but different number of parameters . to the @xmath46 standard @xmath5-cdm parameters we cumulatively add as additional free parameters the fine structure constant ( first case ) , the number of relativistic degrees of freedom @xmath4 ( second case ) and the primordial helium abundance @xmath30 ( third case ) . in table",
    "[ standard ] we report the constraints on the cosmological parameters for these three scenarios .    .mcmc estimation of the cosmological parameters from the dataset described in the text .",
    "results for the three analyses described in the text are reported .",
    "upper bounds at @xmath47 c.l . are reported for foregrounds parameters . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      vs @xmath4 at @xmath48 c.l . and @xmath49 c.l .",
    "in the case of @xmath38 ( red smaller contours ) and @xmath30 allowed to vary ( blue larger contours ) . ]    as we can see the dataset considered prefers a value of @xmath25 smaller than unity at more than two standard deviations when both the @xmath4 and @xmath30 are kept fixed at their standard values .",
    "this result , while interesting , is to be expected since is clearly driven by data preference for larger values of @xmath4 . allowing for variations in @xmath4",
    "significantly shifts the best fit value for @xmath50 , which is now consistent with the standard value .",
    "however , even in this case the best fit value for @xmath4 is still @xmath51 , i.e. allowing for variation in the fine structure constant enlarges the error bars on @xmath4 of about @xmath52 but does not shift the best fit value towards the standard result . the largest effect on @xmath1 comes however when also the helium abundance @xmath30 is let to vary . in this case , indeed , the errors on @xmath1 are almost doubled .",
    "we can better understand the impact of @xmath30 on the determination of @xmath25 by looking at figure 1 , where we plot the @xmath53-d likelihood contours in the @xmath25-@xmath4 plane in the cases of @xmath38 and free @xmath30 . as we can see when the helium abundance is fixed",
    "there is a clear but moderate degeneracy between @xmath25 and @xmath4 .",
    "when @xmath4 is increased the hubble parameter at recombination increases . in order to keep the damping scale at the same value fixed by observations ( see eq.[damp ] ) we need to decrease the free electron density at recombination .",
    "this can be achieved by simply accelerating the recombination process .",
    "this effect is clearly obtained by an increase in the fine structure constant .",
    "this explains the direction of the degeneracy in contour plot .",
    "when also a variation in the helium abundance is considered , the degeneracy changes direction .",
    "a larger value for @xmath30 produces a large free electron fraction at recombination and a smaller value for @xmath4 is needed to keep the damping scale small .",
    "on the other hand a large value for @xmath30 needs large values for @xmath1 .",
    "so now small values of @xmath4 are more compatible with observations when @xmath1 is larger .",
    "in this paper we have presented new constraints on variation of the fine structure constant from the latest cmb anisotropy measurements of the act and spt experiments , combined with other cosmological datasets .",
    "we have found that assuming the standard value for @xmath4 and a primordial helium abundance of @xmath38 the current data favours a lower value for the fine structure constant at more than two standard deviations with @xmath2 .",
    "we have shown that this result relies on the assumption of the number of relativistic degrees of freedom .",
    "when we let this parameter vary freely , the standard value is again consistent with the data considered .",
    "varying also the primordial helium content further enlarges the error bars . despite the existing degeneracies",
    ", the current data offers the tantalizing suggestion of the presence of new physics at the epoch of recombination .",
    "clearly , further experimental confirmation of the result is needed .",
    "fortunately , the results from the planck satellite mission , expected to be released early next year , will most probably clarify the issue .",
    "the planck experiment is indeed expected to have a sensitivity of @xmath54 and @xmath55 at @xmath28 c.l .",
