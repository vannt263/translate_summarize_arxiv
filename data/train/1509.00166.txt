    "underlay cognitive transmission represents one of the most promising spectrum sharing techniques , where secondary ( unlicensed ) users utilize the spectrum resources of another primary ( licensed ) service @xcite . to this end",
    ", the transmission power of the cognitive system is limited , such that its interference onto the primary users remains below prescribed tolerable levels . however , this dictated constraint dramatically affects the coverage and/or capacity of the secondary communication .",
    "such a condition can be effectively counteracted with the aid of relayed transmission @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "using multiple antennas at each node ( and , thus , benefiting from the emerged spatial diversity of each transmitted stream ) is another effective approach to enhance the performance of a cognitive system @xcite-@xcite . due to the complementary benefits of relayed transmission and spatial diversity gain , the performance analysis of these schemes , under the cognitive transmission regime , is of prime interest lately ( e.g. ,",
    "see @xcite and references therein ) .    all the previous research works assumed ideal hardware at the transmitter and/or receiver end , where the scenario of impaired transceivers ( namely , non - ideal hardware ) was neglected",
    "nevertheless , this condition represents a rather overoptimistic scenario for practical applications .",
    "more specifically , the hardware gear of wireless transceivers may be subject to impairments , such as i / q imbalance , phase noise , and high power amplifier nonlinearities @xcite . yet",
    ", very few research works have analytically investigated the impact of hardware impairments .",
    "specifically , the outage probability of one - way @xcite and two - way @xcite dual - hop relayed transmission systems is analytically expressed , in the case of single - antenna transceivers and non - cognitive environments .",
    "nevertheless , a corresponding analysis when multiple antennas are employed at each node and/or under a cognitive transmission regime lacks from the open technical literature so far . capitalizing on these observations , in this paper ,",
    "the performance of a dual - hop cognitive system with multiple - antennas and hardware impairments at the transceiver of each hop is analytically investigated .",
    "particularly , two popular spatial diversity techniques are adopted , namely , transmit antenna selection with maximum ratio combining ( tas / mrc ) , or tas with selection combining ( tas / sc ) are established in each hop .",
    "it is noteworthy that with tas , the number of rf chains required is equal to the number of antennas selected for communication , a rather cost - efficient solution for various applications .",
    "most importantly , even with lower complexity , tas gives full diversity .",
    "hence , it is recently of great importance due to its low feedback demand @xcite-@xcite , whereas it plays a key role to the uplink of 4 g networks @xcite .",
    "also , the decode - and - forward ( df ) protocol is used for the relayed transmission .",
    "new closed - form expressions are derived with respect to the outage probability of the system , which generalize some previously reported results .",
    "in addition , simplified asymptotic expressions of the outage probability , in the high signal transmission regime are also obtained , revealing the diversity and array order of the system , the effectiveness of the balance on the number of transmit / receive antennas , and the impact of hardware impairments to the end - to - end ( e2e ) communication . specifically , it is demonstrated that the diversity order and the performance difference between tas / mrc and tas / sc remain unaffected from hardware impairments .",
    "consider an underlay secondary system , where a source node ( s ) communicates with a destination node ( d ) via an intermediate relay node ( r ) , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . the direct link between s and d is assumed to be absent due to strong propagation attenuation and keeping in mind that the transmission power of the underlay system is , in principle , maintained quite low .",
    "let @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 denote the number of antennas at the primary receivers , s , r and d , respectively .",
    "the antennas of each node are sufficiently separated from one another ( with respect to the transmission wavelength ) to prevent any channel fading correlation .",
    "also , assume identical rayleigh faded channels for the antennas of each node and not necessarily identical channels from one node to another .",
    "furthermore , the df transmission protocol is adopted for the dual - hop relayed transmission , which has shown very good results in terms of error rates and outage performance @xcite . for mathematical tractability ,",
    "let @xmath4 for the 1st hop , while @xmath5 for the 2nd hop .        in the case",
    "when signal distortion due to hardware impairments is present and tas is established at the transmitter side , the input - output relation of the received signal at the @xmath6th transmission hop is given by @xmath7 .",
    "let @xmath8 denote vectors for the received signal , the channel fading , the distortion noise to the received signal , and the additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) of the @xmath6th hop , respectively .",
    "moreover , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( scalar values ) correspond to the transmission power , the transmitted signal and the distortion noise to the transmitted signal of the @xmath6th hop , respectively .",
    "notice that @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 @xcite , @xcite . also , @xmath15 and @xmath16 represent certain parameters describing the underlying distortion noise at the transmitter and receiver , respectively , @xmath17 is the power spectral density of awgn , while @xmath18 stands for the @xmath19-sized identity matrix .",
    "further , assume that the hardware quality of each antenna is identical for the same device , i.e. , there is an equal distortion noise variance per antenna for each node , while this variance is perfectly known at the receiver side ( e.g. , through pilot or feedback signaling ) . in principle ,",
    "channel state information ( csi ) of the links between the primary and secondary nodes can be obtained through a feedback channel from the primary service or through a band manager that mediates the exchange of information between the primary and secondary networks @xcite .",
    "hence , the received signal - to - noise - and - distortion ratio ( sndr ) at the @xmath6th hop reads as ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq . ( 6 ) )",
    "@xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the channel fading gain of the desired signal , which differs according to the adopted reception strategy ( which is analyzed in the next section ) .",

    "hence , ( [ sndr ] ) becomes @xmath28",
    "we start by defining the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) of sndr at the @xmath6th hop , namely @xmath29 . based on ( [ sndrr ] )",

    "thus , in the rest of this paper , ( [ cdfxi ] ) will be used to denote both the tas / mrc and tas / sc scenarios , correspondingly .      using ( [ cdfxi ] ) in ( [ 4b ] ) , invoking ( * ? ? ?",

    "( 31 ) ) .",
    "the previously derived expressions are exact ; albeit they admit a more amenable formulation in the high sndr regime .      in the asymptotically high sndr regime ,",
    "while utilizing ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq . ( 3.381.4 ) ) , ( [ 4b ] ) becomes ( for both tas / mrc and tas / sc ) @xmath71 yielding @xmath72      in this case , both the maximum available transmission power and the fading gain of the desired channel are asymptotically high ( e.g. , very low propagation attenuation ) .",

    "it is straightforward to show that the diversity order of the system remains @xmath80 , it is maximized when equal number of antennas are used for transmission and reception , and it is not affected by the impact of hardware impairments .    the performance difference between the two diversity techniques is highlighted in the underlying array order ( or coding gain ) . for identical channel fading statistics of each hop , we have that @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 ( thus , @xmath84 and @xmath85 ) , @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",

    "notably , one may observe from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] that it is preferable to enable multiple antennas with non - ideal ( e.g. , low cost ) transceivers rather than single - antenna transceivers with ideal hardware . hence",
    ", spatial diversity seems to overcome hardware impairments at the transceiver , even if the rather suboptimal sc ( as compared to the performance of tas / sc or tas / mrc ) scenario is used .",
    "also , the value of interference threshold plays an important role to the outage probability , since it dramatically affects the floor on outage occurrence .",
    "the performance of a typical zero forcing ( zf ) detection scheme is also presented for cross - comparison reasons .",
    "it can be seen that zf is inferior to tas / sc and sc schemes due to the reduced spatial diversity gain .",
    "moreover , the tightness of the asymptotic curves in moderately medium - to - high channel power gain regions is depicted in fig .",
    "it can be readily seen that the diversity orders of the considered schemes remain unaffected from the impact of hardware impairments .",
    "the same argument holds for the performance difference between these schemes .",
    "finally , the superiority of tas / mrc against tas / sc , in both cases of ideal and non - ideal hardware , is verified in fig .",

    "current study provides some new results satisfying performance requirements of practical cognitive multiple - antenna df relaying systems with non - ideal hardware : a ) new straightforward and exact closed - form outage performance expressions are derived ; b ) the selection of equal number of antennas at the transceiver of each link is the most optimal solution regardless of the amount of hardware impairments ; and c ) tas / mrc always outperforms tas / sc , while such a performance difference is irrespective of hardware quality .",
