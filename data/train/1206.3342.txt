    "<S> phase contrast techniques , such as differential interference contrast ( dic ) microscopy , are widely used to provide morphological images of unstained biological samples . the trans - illumination geometry required for these techniques </S>",
    "<S> has restricted their application to thin samples . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce oblique back - illumination microscopy ( obm ) , a method of collecting _ en face _ phase gradient images of thick scattering samples , enabling near video - rate _ in vivo _ phase imaging with a miniaturized probe suitable for endoscopy .    </S>",
    "<S> phase contrast microscopy techniques are widely used in biological research because they can provide high resolution images of unlabeled samples even when these are nearly transparent . </S>",
    "<S> for example , differential interference contrast ( dic ) , which reveals lateral phase gradients , is one of the more popular techniques because it provides apparent 3d sample relief using a standard microscope equipped with a lamp and a camera @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> even simpler techniques based on oblique illumination can also be used with standard microscopes and provide similar imaging as dic @xcite . however , in order to reveal lateral phase gradients , all these techniques must be operated in trans - illumination configurations , limiting their use to thin samples . because one is often constrained to working instead with thick samples ( e.g. endoscopy or _ in vivo _ applications ) , there is a clear need for a method that can provide dic - like imaging in thick samples . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce such a method here .    our technique is called oblique back - illumination microscopy ( obm ) . as its name suggests , </S>",
    "<S> this technique is based on a similar principle as oblique illumination microscopy , with the notable difference that illumination and detection both occur from the same side of the sample ( i.e. in a reflection geometry ) , allowing its application to samples of arbitrary thickness . </S>",
    "<S> unlabeled samples can , of course , be imaged with microscopes based on direct light reflection . </S>",
    "<S> the most successful of these for tissue imaging is optical coherence tomography ( oct ) , which , like obm , can also be operated in a widefield _ en face _ </S>",
    "<S> configuration @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , microscopes based on light reflection intrinsically reveal only sample structure that varies rapidly in the axial direction , such as sharp interfaces or particles much smaller than the illumination wavelength @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , microscopes based on light transmission are not subject to this constraint , and can reveal even slowly varying sample structure in the lateral direction , thus providing images of subtle sample features impossible to see in reflection mode . </S>",
    "<S> an important characteristic of obm is that , even though it is configured in a reflection geometry , it is , in fact , a transmission microscope in disguise . in effect , obm uses multiple scattering in tissue to convert epi - illumination into trans - illumination . because the illumination source is offset from the detection optical axis , the trans - illumination is oblique ( * fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : setup ] * ) . </S>",
    "<S> while illumination obliquity directly leads to phase gradient contrast , image intensity is also influenced by sample absorption . </S>",
    "<S> the use of two off - axis sources diametrically opposed to one another permits the acquisition of two raw images with similar absorption contrast but with phase gradient contrast of opposing sign ( * supplementary fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : rawaddsub ] * ) . </S>",
    "<S> the subtraction of these raw images enhances phase gradient contrast while canceling absorption contrast ; addition of the raw images has the opposite effect , revealing only absorption contrast while canceling phase gradient contrast . by this method , </S>",
    "<S> the sequential acquisition of two raw images using alternating illumination sources decouples absorption and phase gradient contrast .    </S>",
    "<S> we present results obtained from a miniaturized obm built using a flexible endomicroscope probe comprising a distal micro - objective and an imaging fiber bundle comprising 30,000 fiber cores ( online methods ) . </S>",
    "<S> illumination from two independently controlled light emitting diodes ( leds ) was delivered to the sample via two optical fibers attached opposite one another to the micro - objective housing . </S>",
    "<S> the endomicroscope probe was designed to operate in contact mode , meaning that light reflected directly from the sample surface is not collected by the micro - objective . </S>",
    "<S> instead , the micro - objective only collects light that has been multiply scattered in the sample and redirected upwards through the focal plane , located here at a depth of @xmath0 ( the working distance of the micro - objective ) . unless stated otherwise , all images presented here are individual frames from movies acquired and displayed at a net rate of @xmath1 using a double - shutter camera that reads images pairwise . </S>",
    "<S> the exposure time per raw image was typically 1 to @xmath2 .    </S>",
    "<S> * figure  [ fig : chick ] * shows a phase gradient image of a @xmath3 polystyrene bead embedded in a scattering tissue phantom consisting of @xmath4 beads mixed in agarose . </S>",
    "<S> the phase gradient induced by the bead was observed to be approximately linear </S>",
    "<S> . note that since the phase gradient image is derived from a difference of raw images , it contains both positive and negative values ( zero is represented by an intermediate gray level ) . because phase gradients must , by definition , arise from apparent sample structure , they must also arise from the vicinity of the focal plane ( objects out of focus are blurred and exhibit little structure ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , phase gradient imaging exhibits apparent out - of - focus background rejection . </S>",
    "<S> this is manifest in * supplementary video  [ fig : beadvid ] * , in which only the in - focus @xmath4 beads are visible .    </S>",
    "<S> * figure  [ fig : chick ] * also shows simultaneously acquired absorption and phase gradient images of the chorioallantoic membrane ( cam ) in a day 11 chick embryo _ in vivo _ and _ in ovo_. note the low contrast of the absorption images compared to the phase gradient images . because the absorption images are derived from the sum of raw images , their values are positive definite ( zero is black ) , and they do not exhibit out - of - focus background rejection ( such imaging is similar to orthogonal polarization spectral imaging @xcite ) . compared to images obtained from oct , obm images are speckle - free . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , owing to the large photon fluxes involved , they are also relatively shot - noise free . </S>",
    "<S> intensity noise arises , in our case , mostly from inhomogeneous image sampling due to an uneven distribution of fiber cores in the imaging fiber bundle ( online methods ) .    finally , * figure  [ fig : mouse ] * shows simultaneously acquired absorption and phase gradient images of excised , unstained mouse intestinal epithelium . </S>",
    "<S> the absorption images are essentially featureless in this case , whereas the phase gradient images are information rich . for example , crypts of lieberkhn and ileal villi are readily visible in * figures  [ fig : mouse]g * ( * supplementary video  [ fig : colonvid ] * ) and * [ fig : mouse]h * ( * supplementary video  [ fig : ileumvid ] * ) , respectively , illustrating the potential of obm for _ in situ _ histopathology and `` optical biopsies '' .    in summary , we have presented an apparatus that , to our knowledge , is the first to provide sub - surface , dic - like ( i.e. transmission - like ) phase gradient imaging from thick scattering tissue in a reflection geometry . </S>",
    "<S> the apparatus is simple , fast , robust , and inexpensive , making it broadly appealing to biological and clinical researchers alike . </S>"
