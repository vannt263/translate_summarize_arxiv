    "the ` bright nova ' s  andromedae ( s  and ) was discovered in the central bulge of m31 ( ngc  224 ) during late august of 1885 .",
    "it is believed to have been a type ia supernova ( sn  ia ) on the basis of an apparent absence of hydrogen balmer lines @xcite and a close match of nearly all reported spectral features to those of sne  ia @xcite .",
    "however relative to normal sn  ia events , sn  1885 was subluminous with an unusually rapid initial decline and a somewhat redder @xmath14 color @xcite . a recent analysis of sn  1885 observations by @xcite suggests a decline rate of @xmath15 mag and a maximum brightness of @xmath16 and @xmath17 , assuming a m31 distance modulus of ( @xmath18)@xmath19 = 24.4 corresponding to a distance of 760 kpc .",
    "the remnant of sn  1885 remained undetected for over a century despite numerous searches in the optical and radio @xcite .",
    "the remnant was finally detected in 1989 , not through its emission , but as a small dark spot of absorption in the m31 bulge on an image taken using a near - uv filter ( 3900 @xmath20 100   ) sensitive to h & k resonance line absorption @xcite .",
    "although @xcite report a possible weak radio detection at 8.4  ghz , sn  1885 continues to be essentially unobservable via emission , with recent deep _ chandra _ x - ray imaging of the m31 bulge showing no associated x - ray source at its position @xcite .",
    "following its ground - based detection , optical and uv imaging and spectra of the sn  1885 remnant ( hereafter referred to as `` snr 1885 '' ) with instruments aboard the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) revealed a @xmath21 @xmath22 diameter absorption patch produced principally by ca expanding at velocities up to 13,000  km  s@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the observed low flux at the h & k blended line center indicated a foreground starlight fraction of around 0.20 , placing snr  1885 some 65  pc to the near side of the m31 bulge midpoint , comparable to its projected 55  pc (= @xmath23 ) distance from the m31 nucleus .",
    "other absorption lines detected in snr  1885 included @xmath244227 , @xmath243441 , and @xmath243720 . a weak imaging detection of the remnant with the _ hst _ wide - field planetary camera-2 ( wfpc2 ) in the wavelength range 2200    to 3000   , which is rich in strong lines , suggested a depth of absorption consistent with being fully saturated and an iron mass of @xmath25 @xmath26 @xcite .    the fortuitous positioning of a relatively young and nearly freely expanding sn  ia remnant silhouetted against m31 s bright central bulge offers an unique opportunity to map the distributions of ca and fe rich debris in a sn  ia .",
    "in this paper , we present images of snr  1885 taken with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) on _ hst _ at a significantly higher angular resolution and signal - to - noise - ratio than previous images .",
    "the acs images show a sufficiently well - resolved remnant to distinguish between various proposed sn  ia explosion scenarios .",
    "the observations , image results , our modeling results , future observations , and conclusions are given in @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "high - resolution optical and ultraviolet images of snr  1885 , detected via resonance line absorptions of m31 bulge starlight , were obtained between 2004 august and november using the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ; @xcite ) aboard _",
    "acs has two main imaging configurations and both were used .",
    "the acs wide field channel ( wfc ) consists of two @xmath28 ccds providing a field of view @xmath29 with an average pixel size of @xmath8 , while the acs high resolution channel ( hrc ) consists of a single @xmath30 ccd providing a spatial resolution of @xmath31 per pixel and a nominal @xmath32 field of view .",
    "the acs / wfc was used in combination with narrow passband ` ramp ' filters to image snr  1885 in three separate wavelength ranges .",
    "these were the resonance absorption line of ca  i 4226.73   , the ca  ii h & k doublet at 3933.66  and 3968.47   , and a continuum band free of strong remnant absorption lines centered at 4600   .",
    "default acs / wfc and acs / hrc dither ` box ' patterns were used which are 4-point parallelogram patterns with relative pixel coordinates ( 0 , 0 ) , ( 5.0 , 1.5 ) , ( 2.5 , 4.5 ) , ( -2.5 , 3.0 ) , thus having both integer and sub - pixel shifts .    a image of snr  1885 was taken with the 2% ramp filter fr423n centered at 4227   , resulting in an effective bandpass of 75    fwhm and a peak filter transmission of about 60% .",
    "eight 1120  s exposures were taken during four _ hst _ orbits on 2004 november 2 in a four - point dither pattern for a total exposure time of 8960  s.    a h & k absorption image of snr  1885 was obtained with the acs / wfc 2% ramp filter fr388n centered at a wavelength 3950   , chosen to match the center of the remnant s broad ca  ii absorption line profile as observed in the _ hst _ faint object spectrograph ( fos ) spectrum @xcite . at this wavelength ,",
    "the filter s bandpass is 100    fwhm with a peak transmission of about 50% .",
    "images were taken on 2004 november 8 with a dithering pattern and exposure times identical to those of the ca  i images .",
    "a continuum acs / wfc image was also taken to allow for correcting small - scale variations in the distribution of background and foreground starlight from the m31 bulge at the position of snr  1885 .",
    "the continuum image was taken with the 9% ramp filter fr459 m centered at a wavelength 4600   , giving a bandpass of about 350    fwhm and a peak transmission of nearly 80% .",
    "the spectral region is adjacent to the and lines but free of any strong line absorption . due to to the filter s",
    "wide bandpass and the increasing luminosity of m31 bulge stars to longer wavelengths , a relatively short exposure was adequate and dithered images were taken during just two orbits on 2004 august 25 for a total exposure time of 4666  s.    for obtaining uv and images , we used the available broadband filters on the higher resolution acs / hrc . for the image , we selected the f330w filter , which peaks at 3300    and extends over 29753700   .",
    "the filter catches the resonances lines at 3021   , 3441   , and 3720    @xcite , but most of its coverage is line - free continuum .",
    "consequently , the filter provided only a weak detection of .",
    "indeed , we used the image in part as a background continuum image to help correct the and images (   [ cai ] , [ caii ] ) . dithered f330w images were taken over three orbits on 2004 october 13 for a total exposure time of 7800  s.    for the image , we selected the f250w filter , which peaks in transmission at 2500    but has a broad transmission passband extending over @xmath33  .",
    "the filter encompasses the resonance lines at 2343   , 2373   , 2382   , 2586    and 2599   , but it also includes lines at 2524    and 3021   , the line at 2852   , and the doublet at 2796    and 2803   , all of which are predicted to have significant optical depths @xcite . dithered f250w images were taken over 6 orbits on 2004 november 20 for a total exposure of 15,600  s.    standard acs pipeline iraf / stsdas data reduction was done , including debiasing , flat - fielding , geometric distortion corrections , photometric calibrations , and cosmic ray and hot pixel removal .",
    "the stsdas _ drizzle _ task was used to combine exposures in each filter .",
    "figure  [ fig : ca2_vs_offband ] shows a @xmath34 log scaled intensity view of snr  1885 and its local environs within the bulge of m31 .",
    "the h & k image ( _ upper panel _ ) reveals the remnant of sn  1885 as a dark and circular spot at the historically reported location of sn  1885 .",
    "the coordinates for the center of the remnant are : @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "in contrast to the image , the offband 4600    fr459 m continuum image ( fig .  1 , _ lower panel _ ) shows no appreciable absorption at the position of snr  1885 .",
    "because sn  1885 s projected location is uncontaminated by the dust lanes that thread the m31 bulge , the lack of appreciable absorption seen in the 4600     image at the position of snr  1885 suggests little internal dust formed in this sn  ia s metal - rich ejecta .",
    "figure  [ fig : all_four_species ] shows all four of the individual absorption images of snr  1885 : @xmath244227 ( _ upper left _ ) , h & k @xmath373934,3968 ( _ upper right _ ) , @xmath373441,3720 ( _ lower left _ ) , and @xmath372358,2599 plus @xmath242800 ( _ lower right _ ) .",
    "the images shown here are in their native spatial pixel scales ( acs / wfc : @xmath8 ; acs / hrc : @xmath31 ) and are raw in the sense that they have not been corrected for any background variations in the surface brightness of the m31 bulge .",
    "the surface brightness of starlight from the bulge of m31 has both a large scale gradient and smaller scale fluctuations . to correct the and absorption images of snr  1885 for these non - uniformities , we used combinations of the offband 4600    continuum image and the ` ' f330w filter image , in the ratio 4:1 and 3:1 , respectively for the and images .",
    "as noted above in @xmath382 , the f330w filter is broad and , although it encompasses a number of resonance lines , it mostly covers unabsorbed continuum .",
    "we judged it better to use a background constructed from continuum both longward ( 4600   ) and shortward ( f330w ) of the and lines , and to accept the mild contamination from absorption in the f330w continuum , than to use the 4600  image alone . because the acs / hrc f330w image has a native image scale of @xmath31 per pixel",
    ", we first resampled the acs / wfc , , and 4600    images to @xmath39 per pixel using the iraf image interpolation task _ magnify _ , before applying the background correction .",
    "figures  [ fig : cai_orig_vs_new ] and [ fig : orig_vs_new ] show in close - up the resampled , background - corrected images of snr  1885 in and absorption , along with the original , uncorrected images .",
    "we discuss these images in more detail below in   [ cai ] and [ caii ] .",
    "the distance to m31 is estimated to be between 760 and 790 kpc based on studies of m31 cepheid and rr lyrae variables , globular clusters , and stars at the tip of the red giant branch ( @xcite and references therein ) . in the discussions below ,",
    "we have adopted a distance of @xmath3 kpc to m31 and the snr  1885 .",
    "[ [ cai ] ]    figure  [ fig : cai_orig_vs_new ] shows the and 4600    continuum images of snr  1885 resampled to @xmath39 per pixel .",
    "it also shows two slightly different background - corrected versions of the image . like that seen in the raw image presented in figure 2 , the uncorrected but resampled ca  i absorption image has a markedly lopsided ` c ' shaped appearance with the strongest absorption oriented approximately in the direction of the nucleus of m31 toward the northeast .",
    "the remnant s overall diameter in this image is roughly @xmath40 corresponding to a linear diameter of 2.5 pc at a distance of 785 kpc .",
    "the two background - corrected images shown in figure  [ fig : cai_orig_vs_new ] are still noticeably lopsided , though much less so , and both appear more complete in the sense of showing a greater degree of absorption near the center and along the western limb . in the first background - corrected version ( fig .  3 , _ lower left _ ) , we used only the 4600    continuum image to remove bulge starlight variations , while for the second version ( fig .  3 , _ lower right _ ) which we regard as being better",
    ", we used a combination of 4600    and f330w images for the background in the ratio 4:1 , respectively .",
    "one can see that the bulge non - uniformities are significantly decreased in both corrected images .",
    "moreover , the good agreement between the two background - corrected ca  i images indicates that the mild contamination from absorption in the f330w image does not have a substantial effect .",
    "while our use of adjacent continuum images should largely remove small scale structures attributable to variations in the background starlight , we can not entirely remove m31 bulge light variations because some 25% of the bulge starlight lies foreground to snr  1885 ( see  [ caii ] below ) .",
    "nonetheless , the deepest levels of absorptions appear along the remnant s eastern and northern limbs .",
    "[ [ caii ] ]    in the _ hst _ acs images , snr  1885 is most prominently visible through h & k line absorption .",
    "figure  [ fig : orig_vs_new ] shows the acs / wfc image both in its original @xmath8 pixel scale format and then after resampling to @xmath39 per pixel plus background corrected using the 4600    and f330w images combined in the ratio 3:1 .",
    "the intensity toward the center of the uncorrected image falls to about 30% of the background intensity of starlight , making snr  1885 the darkest feature in the inner m31 bulge at 3950   .",
    "both original and background corrected images indicate the likely presence for a few absorption ` clumps ' having an angular size around that of the acs / wfc image resolution ( @xmath8 ) , @xmath41 pc at a distance of 785 kpc .",
    "this scale suggests a span in velocity for such clumps of around @xmath42 km s@xmath7 .",
    "the most prominent absorption clump is about 25% darker than its surroundings and lies some @xmath9 due north of the remnant s absorption center .",
    "while some of the small - scale absorption structures seen in the image are likely due to variations in both the corrected bulge starlight background and in the starlight lying in front of the remnant , the strength and non - randomness of the darkest features suggests the existence of a broken ring of -rich clumps at a radius of @xmath5 ( @xmath43 ) located along the inner edge of a limb - brighten shell .    aside from these apparent clumps ,",
    "the degree of absorption in the image appears approximately constant from the center of the remnant out to a radius of @xmath5 , corresponding to a free expansion velocity of @xmath44 .",
    "this suggests that the absorption is at least partially saturated in the central region , as previously concluded from the fos spectrum of snr  1885 discussed by @xcite .",
    "the raw and background - corrected images of snr  1885 also indicate a fairly spherical remnant structure .",
    "the spherical shape and outer extent of the remnant s absorption is illustrated by the @xmath45 diameter circle shown in figure 4 .",
    "this circle encompasses virtually all of the observed absorption .",
    "the maximum detected dimensions of the sn  1885 remnant as seen in both the and images are shown in figure  [ fig : ca1_vs_ca2 ] .",
    "the image shows that absorption extends out to a diameter of @xmath46 , which is larger than that seen via absorption ( diameter = @xmath47 ) .",
    "comparison of these and images which are shown here greatly stretched to bring out absorption in the outermost parts of the remnant , shows that the image as a whole appears offset relative to the center of the image , by approximately @xmath8 in the direction of the nucleus of m31 .",
    "the offset is consistent with the asymmetric appearance of the image , and probably reflects a real intrinsic asymmetry in the distribution of versus .",
    "the stretched image shown in figure 5 indicates an outer radius for absorption of @xmath48 at m31 s estimated distance of @xmath49 .",
    "this is equivalent to an expansion velocity of @xmath50 at the @xmath51 age of the remnant .",
    "this velocity estimate is in agreement with the maximum velocity of @xmath52 directly measured from a fos spectrum obtained by @xcite .",
    "this agreement supports the notion that the absorbing -rich ejecta are in free expansion .",
    "moreover , since the image probes the size in the transverse direction while the spectrum probes the size in the line - of - sight direction , the similarity of the two expansion velocities indicates that the ejecta structure is approximately spherical .    finally , as noted above the average central intensity in the image",
    "is about @xmath53 that of the local bulge intensity of starlight .",
    "this is somewhat higher than the average central intensity of @xmath54 seen in the fos spectrum of snr  1885 @xcite .",
    "the slightly brighter average central intensity measured from the acs / wfc image compared to the fos spectrum suggests that the foreground starlight fraction may be about @xmath54 , higher than the @xmath55 fraction found by @xcite from a best - fit model of the fos spectrum .",
    "a possible reason for this slight discrepancy in central intensities is that center of the @xmath56 circular aperture of the fos just happened to fall on one of the darker patches of absorption ( see fig .  4 )",
    ".    [ [ fei ] ]    the remnant s absorption distribution was imaged using the broad , near - uv acs / hrc filter f330w . while this filter s bandpass is sensitive to three lines ( 3021   , 3441   , and 3720   ) , the two strongest lines , at 3021    and 3720   ,",
    "are detected only partially and at low filter transmission levels ; that is , only the redshifted absorption of the 3021   line and just the blueshifted side of the 3720    line .",
    "in addition , the f330w filter covered a considerable continuum region between @xmath57   outside of the lines and , in fact , was used to help compose background bulge starlight images for the and acs / wfc images .",
    "nonetheless , faint absorption was detected on the f330w image .",
    "the image ( fig .",
    "2 ) resembles most the uncorrected image , showing a lopsided and broken absorption patch some @xmath58 in diameter , a break along the southwest limb , and the strongest absorption concentrated toward the northeast .",
    "the image also shows a peak of absorption roughly @xmath59 pixels across ( @xmath60 ) , i.e. , about the same size as that for the clumps , displaced toward the northeast by about @xmath9 from the center of the absorption patch .",
    "[ [ feii ] ]    m31 bulge starlight is relatively faint between @xmath61   and faintest between 2300  2600   where several strong resonance lines are found .",
    "this fact , together with the rising continuum flux of bulge starlight toward the redward portion of the @xmath62   passband of the f250w filter on acs / hrs resulted in a low signal - to - noise 3000 continuum dominated image .",
    "this , in turn , produced a very weak detection of snr  1885 presumably due to line absorption ( fig .  2 , _ lower right panel _ ) based upon ionization models which predict that the remnant should be almost black over the @xmath63   range @xcite .",
    "notwithstanding its comparatively poor detection of snr  1885 , the f250w image bears a clear resemblance to the image of the remnant .",
    "this can be seen in figure 6 were we show a side - by - side comparison of snr  1885 in and the f250w images .",
    "it is important to note that the f250w filter covers not only lines but also the mg  ii doublet at @xmath64   and several lines ( see @xmath383.3 ) .",
    "however , the similarity of the f250w image to the ca  ii image but not to the or images ( see fig .  2 ) suggests that does not make a major contribution to the f250w image . while @xmath64   could also contribute to the detection of snr  1885 on the f250w image , mg  ii",
    "is expected to lie outside of the ca - rich ejecta region and should thus lead to a larger diameter appearing remnant .",
    "since this is not what is seen in the f250w image , we conclude that the f250w image largely shows the distribution of -rich ejecta in snr  1885 .",
    "in this section , we compare our acs imaging data of snr  1885 to off - center delayed - detonation models of type ia sne ( sne  ia ) .",
    "there is general agreement that sne  ia result from processes involving the combustion of a degenerate c - o white dwarf ( wd ) that somehow reaches the chandrasekhar mass limit , @xmath65 . at present ,",
    "two mechanisms are considered most likely to bring a wd to this point . currently , the leading idea is that a single wd accretes matter by roche - lobe overflow from a main sequence or red giant companion @xcite .",
    "an alternative possibility is the merger of two low - mass wds in a binary @xcite .",
    "either way , the explosion is triggered near the center by compression .",
    "one of the main uncertainties in sn  ia physics is how the nuclear burning flame propagates through the white dwarf .",
    "specifically , does it propagate as a weak supersonic detonation front , or as a subsonic deflagration wave ?",
    "whereas detonation fronts are fairly well understood , modeling the propagation of a deflagration wave is difficult because the effective speed of deflagration burning depends on details of the development of multi - dimensional instabilities which , in turn , depend sensitively on the initial conditions that lead to the thermonuclear runaway .",
    "despite significant recent progress , direct deflagration modeling represents a major computational challenge .",
    "this is because of the multi - dimensional physics involved , the wide range of scales spanning 5 to 6 orders of magnitude , and the sensitivity to initial conditions . as a result ,",
    "fully self - consistent computer models are beyond reach at the present time , and additional observational constraints are needed to make progress on the subject .",
    "for example , observational knowledge of the distribution of the products of nuclear burning , as in snr  1885 , can constrain the conditions under which burning must have taken place .",
    "pure detonation explosions of @xmath65-mass models have long been ruled out for normal or subluminous sne  ia .",
    "such models predict that the wd is incinerated almost entirely to @xmath66 , contrary to observed sn  ia spectra which show a range of intermediate mass elements .",
    "pure deflagration explosions also appear to be ruled out for normal sne  ia .",
    "three - dimensional numerical computations show that deflagrations produce deep rayleigh - taylor unstable plumes , which lead to extensive radial , macroscopic mixing of burning products @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "pure deflagration models predict a chemically mixed region of burning products , surrounded by a thick layer of unburned c - o of several tenths of a solar mass .",
    "by contrast , spectra of normal sne  ia reveal a chemically stratified structure .",
    "moreover , there is no evidence for rising deflagration plumes whose signatures should be visible in infrared spectra of normal sn  ia at late times or in subluminous sne  ia such as sn  1999by at early times @xcite .",
    "better agreement with observations is obtained with so - called ` delayed - detonation ' ( dd ) models in which the explosion is assumed to begin as a deflagration which then ( somehow ) develops into a detonation .",
    "the mechanism by which a deflagration might turn into a detonation is not well understood .",
    "thus simulations typically make the _ ad hoc _ assumption that at some point a deflagration wave simply turns into a detonation , and the density at which this transition takes place is treated as a free parameter .",
    "increasing the transition density causes the transition from deflagration to detonation to occur earlier , increasing the amount of @xmath66 synthesized .",
    "variation in this one parameter can account for the observed gross variation in the properties of sne  ia : how much @xmath66 is produced , the overall distribution of elements , and the brightness of the sn  ia event @xcite .",
    "arguments about sne  ia in general do not necessarily apply to an individual object such as sn  1885 .",
    "however , delayed - detonation models can reproduce both early to late time light curves and the spectra of both normal and subluminous sne  ia light spectra in the optical to the ir @xcite .",
    "we therefore base our comparison to observations of snr  1885 on a suite of spherical delayed - detonation models @xcite .",
    "the models start from the progenitor , 5p01z22 , a c - o white dwarf taken from the core of an evolved 5  m@xmath67 main sequence star with solar metallicity . through accretion",
    ", this core approaches the chandrasekhar limit .",
    "a deflagration begins spontaneously when the core reaches a central density of @xmath68 and the wd mass is close to @xmath69 @xcite .",
    "as mentioned above concerning dd models , the density at which the deflagration is assumed to transition into a detonation is the key parameter that produces variation in sne  ia . for extragalactic sne  ia , the transition densitycan",
    "be adjusted so as to match the observed light curve , in particular its rate of decline @xcite .",
    "the chemical profile of the model then predicts a spectrum that can be compared to observation . in the case of snr  1885",
    ", we will instead choose the transition density so as to reproduce the chemical profiles observed with acs .",
    "the maximum brightness and light curve then become a prediction of the model .",
    "the _ hst _ acs images of snr  1885 presented in  [ imageresults ] show at velocities up to @xmath70 . by comparison",
    ", dd models can produce ca - rich ejecta with maximum velocities that range from @xmath71 for a very subluminous sn  ia resembling sn  1991bg , up to @xmath72 for normal sn  ia . the specific model that best matches snr  1885 is 5p01z22.16 , in which the ` .16 ' refers to a dd transition density of @xmath73 for the progenitor 5p01z22 .",
    "in this model , the deflagrated region encloses @xmath74 , and the explosion produces a net total of @xmath75 of @xmath66 .    model 5p01z22.16 , which also provides a good fit to the subluminous sn  ia object sn  1986 g @xcite , is subluminous by about @xmath76 magnitudes , predicts a peak brightness of @xmath77 and @xmath16 , and a 15-day decline rate of @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "this peak brightness in @xmath80 agrees well with that observed for sn  1885 , but the decline rate is slower than the @xmath81 reported for sn  1885 @xcite .",
    "a possible explanation of the discrepancy in the decline rate may be related to uncertainties in the time @xmath82 of maximum light of sn  1885 .",
    "all sne  ia show a flat maximum , followed by a phase of increasing rate of decline @xcite .",
    "a shift of @xmath83 days in @xmath82 would bring the model into closer agreement .",
    "in constructing off - center dd models , we have followed the prescription of @xcite . in this prescription ,",
    "the initial deflagration phase is modeled assuming spherical symmetry .",
    "the deflagration begins at the center , and propagates outward in a subsonic deflagration wave .",
    "the energy deposited by deflagration causes the entire white dwarf to expand .",
    "when the density at the leading edge of the deflagration wave has fallen to a certain transition density , a detonation is ignited by hand at a single point ( the north pole ) of the deflagration front .",
    "the simulation is then continued in 2 dimensions assuming cylindrical symmetry .",
    "we choose to impose spherical symmetry on the initial deflagration phase for two reasons .",
    "the first reason is simply computational tractability : 3-dimensional simulations are computationally expensive , requiring many @xmath84 cpu hours @xcite , and indeed no fully consistent dd models have ever been calculated .",
    "the second reason is that multi - dimensional simulations tend to predict mixed chemical profiles , which are at odds with observations both of typical sn  ia ( see  [ scenarios ] above ) and of snr  1885 , where the observed image indicates some radial stratification .",
    "no mixing seemed to us to offer a more promising approach than full mixing .",
    "however , in  [ modelimages ] below we will show that the ca image of snr  1885 is more filled - in at its center than predicted by the model , suggesting that the assumption of spherical symmetry over - corrects the problem , producing more stratification than needed .",
    "we remedy this _ a posteriori _ in  [ modelimages ] , by taking the final , fully - exploded wd , and partially remixing its central regions .",
    "the 3d calculations of @xcite show that detonation proceeds mainly along radial fingers , leaving behind connected regions of unburned matter . to allow for this",
    ", we assumed that the deflagration burns only about @xmath85 of the matter , leaving the remaining matter unburned .",
    "the unburned material plays an important role in that it allows the subsequent detonation to move back into and through the center of the partially deflagrated core , which offers a better approximation to the 3d calculations of @xcite than models in which there is no unburned material , and the detonation front is forced to circulate around the core @xcite .",
    "deflagration burning causes the entire wd to expand .",
    "several seconds into the deflagration , when the density has decreased by about two orders of magnitude , we initiate the detonation at a point on the boundary of the deflagration wave .",
    "we treat the density of the transition as a free parameter , and we characterize its location by the mass @xmath86 interior to the detonation point . at the same time that we initiate the detonation , we switch from spherical to cylindrical symmetry , following the explosion on a grid of @xmath87 cells in the radial and angular directions .",
    "the detonation begins at the pole of the cylindrically symmetric configuration , and propagates away from the pole in all directions .",
    "the detonation front moves not only outward and sideways through the unburned wd , but also inward through deflagrated core , consuming the @xmath88 fraction of unburned material there .    in the model , the detonation front reaches the surface of the wd at the pole about @xmath89 seconds after the detonation , and it reaches the surface at the opposite pole about @xmath90 seconds after that , consistent with the times obtained in the 3d calculations of @xcite ( who did not , however , continue their calculation to homologous expansion ) . over the next 5 to 10 seconds , the hot wd accelerates into free expansion , and the stored thermal energy is converted into kinetic energy .",
    "the density structure of the expanding ejecta freezes out as the sound speed plummets .",
    "about one second after entering the 2d phase , we switch back to 1d hydrodynamics , evolving each of the @xmath91 angular segments as if it were spherically symmetric . at this time , angular gradients in the ca - rich layers are less than 2% .",
    "all numerical calculations were done using the hydra code ( see @xcite ) .",
    "hydra consists of a number of modules that solve simultaneously the hydrodynamical equations , nuclear and atomic networks , and radiation transport equations .    for spherical geometry ,",
    "the hydro equations are solved in the lagrangian frame , and include a front tracking scheme to resolve shock fronts @xcite . for cylindrical geometry ,",
    "the coupled hydro and gravitational ( poisson ) equations are solved in an eulerian frame using a code based on prometheus @xcite without adaptive mesh refinement .",
    "the hydro modules use the explicit piecewise parabolic method ( ppm ) of @xcite to solve the compressible reactive flow equations .",
    "hydra does not include a detailed model of the nuclear flame and of the associated development of instabilities .",
    "instead , the code parameterizes the deflagration speed semi - analytically , the parameters being adjusted so as to reproduce deflagration speeds obtained in 3d calculations . @xcite",
    "have shown that , in models with a parameterized deflagration speed , the abundance of chemical elements synthesized is relatively insensitive to the deflagration speed , but rather depends mainly on the amount of electron capture that takes place during deflagration , which in turn depends on the total amount of material burned during the deflagration phase .",
    "for the nuclear equation of state and the reactions , hydra uses the nuclear reaction - network library of ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "we take into account 218 isotopes for all models .    for spherical geometry",
    ", we use 912 radial layers , while for cylindrical geometry we adopt a relatively modest resolution of @xmath87 cells .",
    "computationally , there is a trade - off between a large nuclear network and high spatial resolution .",
    "we opt for a large nuclear network ( rather than the 4 or 5 isotopes typically considered in 3d calculations ) because numerical tests indicate that the final chemical composition is more sensitive to a reduction in the nuclear network than to a factor 2 reduction in the spatial resolution @xcite . in any case",
    ", the detonation phase is relatively brief and occurs on an already expanding wd so the effects of moderate spatial resolution during detonation are not expected to be dramatic .",
    "still , there is certainly room for improvement in this aspect of the modeling .",
    "figure  [ chem ] shows the late - time chemical distribution in model 5p01z22.16 , with transition mass @xmath92 .",
    "this figure shows the distribution in velocity of o ,",
    "si , ca , fe , and @xmath66 several minutes after the explosion , which is well into the phase of free , homologous expansion .",
    "the detonation axis points upward .",
    "since the @xmath66 in snr  1885 today has long since decayed radioactively to @xmath93 , the figure also shows the distribution of combined @xmath94 . the chemical structure seen is similar for models with transition mass @xmath92 to @xmath95 .    during the early stage of the deflagration ,",
    "densities are high enough , @xmath96 , that electron capture can take place .",
    "this produces a central region containing stable isotopes of fe , co , and ni with a mass fraction for fe of @xmath97 .",
    "as the density drops in the expanding wd , electron capture ceases and the later stages of deflagration yield about @xmath98 of radioactive ni and ca .",
    "the detonation phase produces off - center layers of explosively synthesized isotopes , from @xmath66 and ca on the inside to oxygen on the outside .",
    "the element abundances are characteristic of those obtained in various stages of burning .",
    "the outermost oxygen is partially burned , its mass fraction having increased from the 50% of the original c - o wd to about 70% .",
    "the distribution of ca in model 5p01z22.16 is qualitatively similar to that seen in the hst / acs images of snr  1885 .",
    "the model shows ca in a lopsided shell with a mass fraction around 3% from about 3500 to @xmath99 , peaking at a mass fraction of about 6% at @xmath100 .",
    "the velocity of the peak increases slightly to @xmath101 if the transition mass is increased to @xmath102 .",
    "the final fe distribution has an inner region of about 50% , produced during the early deflagration .",
    "this region is surrounded by a lopsided shell , produced by detonation to @xmath66 , where the mass fraction rises to almost 90% .",
    "the mass fraction decreases slowly outward , declining to about 1% at @xmath103 .",
    "the _ hst _ imaging observations of snr  1885 reveal not the density itself , but rather the column density , i.e. , the density projected along the line - of - sight . thus figure  [ rho ] shows the column densities of ca and fe for model 5p01z22.16 , with the detonation axis taken at various inclinations to the line - of - sight .",
    "the projected distributions appear round when seen face - on ( @xmath104 ) but they become asymmetric at higher inclinations . the asymmetry remains modest even at high inclinations , in part because the intrinsic asymmetry is not large and in part because projection tends to smear out the asymmetry .",
    "comparison between model and observed images of snr  1885 does not tightly constrain the inclination .",
    "however , the observed image is clearly asymmetric , and we adopt an inclination angle of @xmath105 because this angle is consistent with the projected asymmetry observed .",
    "@xcite and @xcite argued that the main source of ionization in snr  1885 is photoionizing uv from the bulge of m31 , and that the main source of uv opacity in sn  1885 is from resonance lines of neutral and singly - ionized species .",
    "recombination and charge exchange are negligible in snr  1885 120 years after the explosion .",
    "@xcite also pointed out that if the ejecta were optically thin , then the lifetimes of and exposed to uv light from the bulge would be quite short ; @xmath106 and @xmath107 , respectively .",
    "the errors quoted come from uncertainty in the line - of - sight location of sn  1885 within the bulge , but there could be a further factor of two uncertainty from photoionization cross - sections and from the extinction correction to the photoionizing uv flux .",
    "predicted photoionization lifetimes as short as these pose a problem .",
    "although resonance lines can block about half the photoionizing uv light at the present time , that still leaves half the uv to get through and reduce the and below the currently observed levels .",
    "@xcite suggested that and might be present , in spite of their short optically thin photoionizing times , if the remnant were optically thick in neutral continua , notably , earlier in its history .",
    "they did not , however , carry out the detailed model computations necessary to demonstrate this possibility .    in the present paper ,",
    "we have carried out the needed time - dependent , photoionization computations , and these show that the observed level of ionization in snr  1885 is entirely consistent with model expectations .",
    "we computed the photoionization of snr  1885 as follows .",
    "we assumed an incident uv spectrum following the _ fos _ data of @xcite down to 2221 , from the _ iue _ data of @xcite down to 1225 , and from the _ hut _ data of @xcite down to 912 , dereddened using the @xcite extinction curve with color excess @xmath108 @xcite and @xmath109 .",
    "we treated the photoionizing uv spectrum incident on snr  1885 as being isotropic .",
    "@xcite had noted that snr  1885 should be receiving more radiation on the side facing the nucleus of m31 and suggested that for this reason snr  1885 should be more ionized on that side .",
    "however , the acs images show precisely the opposite . not only do the images show concentrated toward the bulge , but an _ fos _ spectrum of the remnant showed redshifted by @xmath110 , corresponding to the side closer to the bulge @xcite .",
    "thus an anisotropic photoionization model can not account for the observed asymmetry in the distribution .",
    "rather , the observed asymmetry must reflect an intrinsic asymmetry in the explosion , such as that produced by an off - center delayed - detonation . for simplicity , therefore , we neglected any anisotropy of the incident photoionization .",
    "the evolution of the ionization structure of c , o , mg , si , s , ca , mn , cr , fe , and ni was computed starting from about 10 years after the explosion .",
    "we took the initial ionization state to be mainly neutral , with an ionization fraction of 1% in the central deflagrated region where there is no radioactive heating , and 10% in the detonated region where there is radioactive heating , dominated initially by @xmath66 @xmath111 @xmath112 @xmath111 @xmath93 and later by @xmath113 @xmath111 @xmath114 @xmath111 @xmath115 .",
    "although this initial degree of ionization is plausible , it is not well - determined _ a priori _ by the physics because of complications associated with non - local energy transport by fast electrons in the presence of magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "tests indicated that the degree of ionization at the present time is most sensitive to the initial ionization fraction in the @xmath66 detonation layer .",
    "reducing the ionization in this layer to 1% can delay ionization of and by about 30  years .",
    "the initial ionization state adopted here was chosen because it is reasonable and because it reproduces the observed degree of ionization at the present time .",
    "we computed the temperature structure by taking into account adiabatic expansion , radioactive heating , and the uv radiation field .",
    "the electron temperature affects recombination rates and hence the ionization balance at early times when the density is high .",
    "line opacities were computed in the sobolev approximation for homologously expanding atmospheres , omitting stimulated emission . in homologously expanding ejecta , the radius equals velocity times age , @xmath116 , and the column density per unit velocity @xmath117 of any species is equal to its density @xmath118 times the age @xmath119 . in the nomenclature of @xcite , the sobolev optical depth @xmath120 at wavelength @xmath24 for a bound transition with absorption oscillator strength @xmath121",
    "is @xmath122 where @xmath123 and @xmath124 are the electron charge and mass , @xmath125 the speed of light , and @xmath119 is the 120yr age of the remnant .",
    "besides resonance lines , we also took into account excited lines with lower levels originating from the ground level .",
    "we computed the level populations in a 2-level approximation in which the lower levels are excited by ( optically thin ) ir and optical radiation from the bulge and which then decay by spontaneous emission .",
    "altogether , we included 6,748 bound - bound transitions with wavelengths , energy levels , and oscillator strengths taken from @xcite .    both to follow photoionization and to take into account shielding by neutral atoms , we included bound - free opacities from the ground state for all neutral isotopes of the elements above .",
    "photoionization cross sections were taken from @xcite to which we added some resonances treated in the narrow line approximation based on data from the opacity project @xcite .",
    "finally , we also took into account the doppler shift of the continuum .",
    "the final result of all these calculations is that shielding of uv radiation by bound - free transitions of , , and proved to be the key in delaying photoionization so that and can survive in snr  1885 up to the present time .",
    "all the models showed that ca and fe is mostly neutral at early times , but that and will rapidly disappear as soon as photoionizing uv radiation can penetrate the ejecta . without bound - free shielding ,",
    "is depleted to 10% after about 50 years , whereas with shielding , photoionizing radiation remains blocked for almost a century .",
    "whereas the uv opacity from bound - free transitions evolves substantially , most of the bound - bound transitions remain optically thick over the life of snr  1885 up to the present time , so that the uv line - blocking remains almost constant .    figure  [ ion ] shows the evolution of the /ca fraction .",
    "the high - velocity , outermost layers having a solar - like abundance of ca are quickly photoionized , whereas the inner , ca - rich layers remain opaque for about a century .",
    "as previously argued by @xcite , ca - rich ejecta are currently undergoing a phase of rapid photoionization to .",
    "indeed , our models predict that absorption will become unobservably small in just another 30 years or so , when the remnant is roughly 150 years old .",
    "figure  [ image ] shows model , , and images that can be compared directly to the acs images .",
    "these images take into account not only the chemical and ionization structure of the remnant , as described above , but also the transmission curves of the _ hst _ filters , the contribution of different lines to absorption , and the finite angular resolution of _ hst_. as discussed in  [ chemical ] , the detonation axis in the model is taken to be inclined at @xmath105 to the line - of - sight .    the model predicts the image to be insensitive to the precise ionization structure , since ca is mostly singly - ionized .",
    "the model also predicts that the ca image should have a sharp edge , where the mass fraction of ca drops rapidly from 3% to the pre - explosion , solar - like abundance .",
    "the images shown in figure  [ image ] are for model 5p01z22.16 , which as described in  [ ddchoice ] was chosen so as to reproduce the maximum velocity of observed in snr  1885 .",
    "the model image in figure  [ image ] is as seen through the _ hst _ ramp - filter fr388n centered at @xmath126 and @xmath127 wide , and takes into account the doublet character of the h & k absorption .",
    "the model predicts that the optical depth should exceed unity in a ring from @xmath128 to @xmath129 , which are close to the values measured for snr  1885",
    ".    the model and images in figure  [ image ] appear off - center by about @xmath10 and @xmath130 , respectively , again in good qualitative agreement with the observed images .",
    "the offset is caused primarily by the asymmetric chemical distribution produced by the assumed off - center delayed - detonation .",
    "the asymmetry is enhanced by the self - shielding of denser regions against photoionization .",
    "a defect of the model is that the predicted and images are emptier at their centers than observed in snr  1885 .",
    "it is natural to attribute this defect to our assumption that the early deflagration phase of the explosion was spherically symmetric , which artificially suppresses radial mixing by rayleigh - taylor instabilities in the deflagration wave .",
    "indeed , the observed images show structure down to scales @xmath131 comparable to the angular resolution of the observations , such as might perhaps be produced by instabilities .    to remedy this defect of the model , we tried radially re - mixing the final chemical profile in various ways",
    ". figure  [ mix ] shows the effect on the model and images of radially remixing of : ( a ) layers within the central deflagrated region ; ( b ) layers within the outer boundary of the ca layer ; or ( c ) the entire remnant .",
    "all three cases fill in the central ca hole in the model to a greater or lesser degree .",
    "the observed ca images of snr  1885 are intermediate between cases ( a ) and ( b ) , suggesting that there may have been a moderate amount of radial mixing between the inner deflagrated region and the surrounding detonated layers .",
    "this level of mixing is less than that predicted by current 3d calculations of rt - dominated deflagration fronts @xcite .",
    "smaller amounts of mixing could result if the initial conditions at the onset of runaway burning produce a less violent deflagration @xcite , or if the wd undergoes one or more pulsations with mixing prior to the transition to detonation @xcite .",
    "mixing may also be produced or enhanced by heating of @xmath66 rich regions , well after the thermonuclear explosion , on time scales of hours to days . both mechanism",
    "are compatible with fluctuations on scales observed .",
    "because of the known diversity of sne  ia , below we speculate on some alternative scenarios for modeling the specific case of snr  1885 .    a variation of ` classical ' dd models ( which assume _ ad hoc _ that deflagration converts into a detonation ) , are the so - called ` confined - detonation ' models recently suggested by @xcite and @xcite",
    ". their proposal is motivated in part by the extreme sensitivity to initial conditions of the early phase of burning . in this model , a buoyancy driven individual plume rises from the central deflagrating region to the surface , where it triggers a he - detonation .",
    "a detonation wave then propagates inward , exploding the wd .",
    "the confined - detonation model may offer a natural mechanism to burn a wd partly via deflagration and partly by detonation .",
    "current models of confined - detonation use only a limited nucleosynthetic network , so there is more work to be done , but the results to date suggest that burning in the central layers occurs at densities well below the value of @xmath132 @xcite needed to produce a central region with electron capture , such as is inferred from snr  1885 .",
    "moreover , the confined detonation models predict a significant amount of fe at high velocities , which is not seen in normal sne  ia .",
    "mergers may contribute to the sne  ia population and are obvious candidates for off - center explosions .",
    "for s - andromeda , merger scenarios will suffer from the same problem as confined detonations namely , a low central density with negligable electron capture , unless the primary star is close to @xmath65 when the detonation is triggered .",
    "however , a detonation in a @xmath133 mass wd would produce a large amount of ni and consequently an over - luminous sne  ia which is incompatible with observations of the sn  1885 event .",
    "finally , one might even consider sn  1885 as a possible core - collapse supernova .",
    "the fact that the remnant is freely expanding out to @xmath134 indicates that the remnant has so far swept up less than about @xmath135 of material , implying an ambient circumstellar or interstellar density less than about @xmath136 .",
    "this relatively low density , the historical record , and the absence of evidence of recent star formation in the bulge of m31 , all point to a snia event , as opposed to a snib or snic event in which a massive star undergoes core collapse after having lost its hydrogen envelope in a wind .",
    "our acs observations add further evidence in this direction , the abundance and distribution of fe and ca being more consistent with a deflagration / detonation event than with he - rich freeze - out .",
    "the near spherical symmetry of the image can also be construed as supporting the sn  ia interpretation , since there is growing evidence that the explosion mechanism of these objects is intrinsically asymmetric with axis ratios of 2:1 or more ( @xcite ) .",
    "the remnant of sn  1885 offers an unique and remarkable opportunity to investigate the explosion dynamics and chemistry of a sn  ia explosion in some detail .",
    "the _ hst _",
    "acs data on snr  1885 presented in this paper provide only a glimpse of the potential to probe sn  ia physics . in this light , we thought it useful to consider future observations that might provide further insights .",
    "figure  [ uvtime ] shows a model uv absorption spectrum at three different times , respectively 90 , 120 , and 140 years after the explosion .",
    "the predicted spectrum is rich with strong , broad absorption features from dozens of resonance lines many of which evolve in strength fairly rapidly .    of course",
    ", the relative faintness of the bulge of m31 in the uv will limit the observability of the snr  1885 spectrum .",
    "however , useful observations can be made even with limited signal - to - noise .",
    "for example , as discussed in ",
    "[ ionization ] , the remnant is undergoing a period of rapid ionization of and to the singly - ionized state , so that uv continuum absorption by neutral ca and fe is currently decreasing rapidly .",
    "this reduction in continuum opacity could be detected by broad - band uv imaging over a period as short as 5  years .",
    "future spatially resolved uv spectral imaging , similar perhaps to that available with the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( _ stis _ ) , could provide a significant step forward in our understanding of sn  ia events .",
    "for example , figure  [ uvtiling ] shows uv spectra taken with slits at various offsets from the remnant s center .",
    "spectra such as these would provide a goldmine of information about the 3-dimensional structure and composition of the supernova ejecta , and hence about uncertain aspects of explosion physics in sne  ia .",
    "while narrow slits would of course provide the most precise mapping of ejecta , even broad slit spectra would provide useful information .",
    "figure  [ uvslit ] shows predicted uv spectra taken with various different slit widths available using the stis on _",
    "sn  1885 , exploding as it did so close to , and to the near side of , the nuclear bulge of m31 , presents a remarkable opportunity to map the chemical and density structure of freely - expanding ejecta in a type  ia supernova . in this paper",
    ", we present high angular resolution _ hubble space telescope _ images of the remnant of sn  1885 sensitive to , , , and resonance line absorption .",
    "the highest quality image is that of , which shows a spherical remnant @xmath137 in diameter , corresponding to a free - expansion radius of @xmath138 . although the image is partially saturated ( optical depth @xmath12 a few ) , it shows indications of a ring - like interior structure peaking at a radius of about @xmath43 , with a few apparent absorption ` clumps ' with an angular size near @xmath8 ( @xmath139 ) .",
    "the sn  1885 remnant appears somewhat lopsided and smaller ( dia .",
    "= @xmath140 ) in than , indicating that the inner parts of the remnant are more neutral than the outer parts , as expected if the ejecta are being photoionized by uv light from the bulge of m31 .",
    "the remnant s and absorption structures appear similar in size and morphology , except that the image shows a small absorption peak of diameter @xmath8 displaced to the northeast @xmath9 ( projected velocity of @xmath141 ) from the center of the structure . finally , a weak detection of snr  1885 across the wavelength range of @xmath142 is probably caused by near saturated absorption from several resonance lines .",
    "the image appears similar in size to that seen in .",
    "we argue that the off - center and ring - like characteristics of the ca and images favor off - center delayed - detonation models of the explosion .",
    "we considered alternative scenarios including pure deflagration models , confined - detonations , and wd mergers , but find all of these to be less likely .",
    "using the hydra code @xcite , we have made detailed computations that follow delayed - detonation models of sn  1885 from the beginning of nuclear runaway up to the present 120  year age of the remnant .",
    "the models follow in detail the nucleosynthesis in , radiative transfer through , and ionization structure of , the ejecta , including the effects of late - time photoionization by uv light from the bulge of m31 .",
    "we selected a best - match model so as to reproduce the observed maximum velocity of ca .",
    "the best - match model undergoes a transition from deflagration to detonation at a mass fraction of @xmath92 .",
    "the model is subluminous by about @xmath76 magnitudes , consistent with indications from the historical record of sn  1885 .",
    "the model synthesizes @xmath75 of @xmath66 , and has a light curve similar to that of the subluminous type ia event , sn  1986 g .",
    "we find that our model is able to reproduce many of the general observational features of snr  1885 .",
    "ca and fe in snr  1885 are mostly singly - ionized at the present time , so the and images trace essentially all the ca and fe in the remnant . by contrast , and trace only the regions with the highest density and abundance of ca and fe , because only in these regions are and sufficiently self - shielding against photoionizing uv from the bulge of m31 to survive up to the present time .",
    "our analysis presents the first direct comparison between the properties of a supernova remnant and multi - dimensional explosion models to probe the underlying physics of burning fronts . within the framework of delayed - detonation ( dd ) models ,",
    "the deflagration - detonation transition occurs at densities of the order of @xmath143 , consistent with the zeldovich mechanism @xcite .",
    "potential candidate processes for mixing of burned and unburned matter may be instabilities internal to the deflagration front @xcite , during a pulsational phase of the wd @xcite , or externally induces by shear instabilities present in rapidly , differentially rotating wds when rising plumes enter this region of strong differential rotation @xcite .",
    "the apparent presence of small scale -rich clumps is the first direct evidence for some instabilities and thus the existence of a deflagration phase in sne  ia or , alternatively , mixing induced by radioactive decay of @xmath11ni over time scales of seconds or days .",
    "however , the degree of mixing allowed by the observed images is much smaller than current 3d calculations for rayleigh - taylor dominated deflagration fronts .",
    "this could indicate a serious problem in the current generation of multi - dimensional models for deflagration fronts , which may be related to the initial conditions at the time of the runaway .",
    "in addition , the images require a central region of no or little ca but iron group elements indicative for burning under sufficiently high densities for electron capture taking place , i.e. , burning prior to a significant pre - expansion of the wd .",
    "off - center , delayed - detonation models have the virtue of being able to reproduce light curves and spectra of normal and subluminous sne  ia @xcite .",
    "it is remarkable that these same models are able to reproduce the distribution and morphology of ca and fe in the remnant of sn  1885 .",
    "however , it should be emphasized that the models described in this paper are parametrized , and thus not fully self - consistent .",
    "our efforts should be regarded only as a first step toward tightening the link between explosion physics and observations of young supernova remnants .",
    "the details of sne  ia remain poorly understood @xcite . how the deflagration begins and develops is extremely sensitive to initial conditions @xcite .",
    "equally unclear is how the deflagration subsequently turns into a detonation .",

    "<S> sn  1885 was a probable subluminous type ia supernova which occurred in the bulge of the andromeda galaxy , m31 , at a projected location 16@xmath0 from the nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> here we present and analyze _ hubble space telescope _ images of the sn  1885 remnant seen in absorption against the m31 bulge via the resonance lines of , , , and . </S>",
    "<S> viewed in h & k line absorption , the remnant appears as a nearly black circular spot with an outermost angular radius of @xmath1 , implying a maximum linear radius of @xmath2 pc at m31 s estimated distance of @xmath3  kpc and hence a 120  yr average expansion velocity of @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the strongest absorption is organized in a broken ring structure with a radius of @xmath5 (= @xmath6 km s@xmath7 ) with several apparent absorption ` clumps ' of an angular size around that of the image pixel scale of @xmath8 (= 1500 km s@xmath7 ) . and absorption structures appear similar except for a small absorption peak displaced @xmath9 off - center of the structure by a projected velocity of about @xmath10 km s@xmath7 .    </S>",
    "<S> analyses of these images using off - center , delayed - detonation models suggest a low @xmath11ni production similar to the subluminous sn  ia explosion of sn  1986 g . </S>",
    "<S> the strongly lopsided images of of and can be understood as resulting from an aspherical chemical distribution , with the best agreement found using an off - center model viewed from an inclination of @xmath12 60@xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the detection of small scale ca  ii clumps is the first direct evidence for some instabilities and the existence of a deflagration phase in sne  ia or , alternatively , mixing induced by radioactive decay of @xmath11ni over time scales of seconds or days </S>",
    "<S> . however , the degree of mixing allowed by the observed images is much smaller than current 3d calculations for rayleigh - taylor dominated deflagration fronts . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the images require a central region of no or little ca but iron group elements indicative for burning under sufficiently high densities for electron capture taking place , i.e. , burning prior to a significant pre - expansion of the wd . using time - dependent ionization calculations , we show that the presence today of neutral ions in this 120 yr old remnant can be understood as ejecta self - shielding from the uv radiation in the m31 bulge . </S>"
