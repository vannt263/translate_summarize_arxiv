    "electroweak sm calculations of one - loop corrections to processes with five and more external legs are quite demanding .",
    "the number of diagrams to be evaluated typically is in the several thousands , integrands of the individual diagrams are in general very lengthy and in spite of large cancellations which take place the final result usually comes out to be not as compact as required for an efficient and reliable numerical evaluation . at the present time there is no computer algebra system which allows one to perform in an efficient way complete calculations of multi - leg one - loop corrections .",
    "for example , form is very efficient in doing lorentz algebra but it can not handle ratios of gram determinants depending on several momenta and masses . to overcome this kind of problems we use a combination of several systems and exploit their most advantageous features .",
    "we are testing the effectiveness of our strategy in the evaluation of the one - loop correction to the process @xmath2 . in the last part of this note",
    "we also will discuss improvements possible by utilizing non - standard sets of master - integrals .",
    "to achieve a better performance we use a combination of several tools like diana  @xcite based on c and program libraries based on form and maple which also act as interfaces between them .",
    "since the main tool of evaluation is based on recurrence relations we called this collection of packages fircla which stands for _ * f*eynman * i*ntegral * r*ecursive * c*alcu*la*tor_.    fircla works as follows .",
    "after the process is specified to diana it invokes qgraf  @xcite , to generate all diagrams , then constructs input expressions suitable for use by form and provides additional information like types and masses of particles as well as the relations between kinematical variables .",
    "the output from diana is stored in a file which is used as an input by our form package .",
    "additionally , diana may be utilized to produce pictures of all or particular diagrams as a postscript file .",
    "the form package performs the lorentz algebra , takes traces of the dirac @xmath3-matrices , transforms products of spinors times @xmath3 matrices to a chosen basis of amplitudes , and utilizing the algorithm  @xcite , reduces tensor integrals to a combination of scalar integrals , some of them with shifted space - time dimension . for each diagram",
    "the form package creates a file with expression for further processing by our maple package .",
    "the expressions are written in maple format .",
    "each of these files also provides information about scalar products of external momenta and the masses of the particles .",
    "the values of all scalar invariants are calculated in the form package .",
    "relations between the momenta carried by the lines of the diagrams ( @xmath4 ) and the external momenta ( @xmath5 ) are evaluated by diana after generating a diagram and then transfered via form to the maple package . in this way all useful information from diana can be transfered to the maple package .",
    "the relations between momenta are needed , for example , to find which integrals are independent or equivalent . in the form output files ,",
    "after the kinematic information an expression in maple format follows .",
    "it has the form of a sum of integrals multiplied by polynomials of scalar products , masses and spinor amplitudes .",
    "integrals are just the names of maple procedures like : + @xmath6 where @xmath7 is an inverse scalar propagator , @xmath8 its power , @xmath9 the number of different propagators , the parameter @xmath10 specifies the shift of the space - time dimension @xmath11 and @xmath12 is a set of substitutions for the momenta and scalar invariants .    in the maple package integrals",
    "are evaluated separately by using the recurrence relations algorithm for the evaluation of one - loop integrals described in  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "if the gram determinants of an integral are different from zero then a set of three relations can be used : the relation for removing dots ( a dot represents one power of momentum attached to the line ) from lines reads + @xmath13 i_n^{(d)}. \\label{recursej}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] another relation reduces the shift of the space - time dimension and the index of the @xmath14-th line simultaneously @xmath15 i^{(d)}_n\\;. \\label{reducejanddtod}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] integrals with shifted space - time dimension can be expressed in terms of integrals in generic dimension by applying the formula : @xmath16i^{(d)}_n\\;. \\label{reducedtod}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the above formulae the shift operators @xmath17 etc .",
    "shift the indices @xmath18 , @xmath19 @xmath20 are combinations of external momenta and @xmath21 is the mass of the @xmath14-th line , @xmath22 and @xmath23 when one of the determinants @xmath24 and @xmath25 is equal to zero it is possible to express integrals with @xmath26 lines as a combination of integrals with @xmath27 lines . if @xmath28 then the relation @xmath29 should be applied until one of the lines of the integral will be removed . for the integral with @xmath27 lines",
    "the gram determinant may be different from zero and therefore the relations ( [ recursej ] ) , ( [ reducejanddtod ] ) and ( [ reducedtod ] ) can be used if needed .",
    "if @xmath30 one should apply the relation @xmath31 until a line of the integral will be removed . as in the previous case",
    "if the gram determinants for integrals with @xmath27 lines are different from zero one can use relations ( [ recursej ] ) , ( [ reducejanddtod ] ) and ( [ reducedtod ] ) . since the space - time dimension of @xmath27-point integrals",
    "will be decreased by this reduction one should subsequently apply the relation @xmath32 in order to increase the dimension back to @xmath33 .",
    "our maple package reads the form output diagram by diagram , evaluates each integral from the input expression , adds results for the integrals and simplifies the sum .",
    "for each diagram the result is written in a separate file .",
    "the expression stored for each diagram is a combination of master - integrals and spinor - amplitudes multiplied by ratios of polynomials in scalar products of external momenta , masses and the dimension @xmath34 .",
    "summing up the results from all diagrams is performed by a separate program .",
    "in order to check the effectiveness of our method of evaluating feynman diagrams we calculated the one - loop correction to higgs production via + @xmath37 this process will be important at future @xmath38 colliders . in the tree approximation",
    "it was considered in  @xcite . at one - loop order recently in  @xcite .    at @xmath38 linear colliders operating in the 300800 gev energy range , the main production mechanisms for sm - like higgs particles are @xmath39 i.e. , `` higgs - strahlung '' , @xmath40-fusion ( see figure ) , @xmath41-fusion , and `` radiation  off - top '' , respectively .",
    "the first two processes +    ( 40,20 ) ( -0.3,-7 )    are the dominant ones , in particular at energies above 500 gev . + the higgs - strahlung cross section for large @xmath42 goes like @xmath43 and dominates at low energies .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath40-fusion mechanism exhibits a cross section growing like @xmath44 and therefore dominates at high energies . at @xmath45 gev ,",
    "the two processes have approximately the same cross sections .",
    "the relevance of one - loop corrections was considered in  @xcite .    in order to generate all required diagrams a technical sm model with two leptons doublets ( in order to distinguish external leptons from leptons in loops ) and one quarks doublet was considered .",
    "the contributions of the missing fermions have been obtained by adding up the corresponding results with the appropriate masses .",
    "we put @xmath46 but keep all other masses @xmath47 different from zero .",
    "the results for the pentagon diagrams depend on 5 scalar invariants .",
    "all calculations were done for arbitrary values of the gauge parameters @xmath48 . in the specified model",
    "326 diagrams contribute to the one - loop correction . out of these",
    "15 are pentagon type diagrams .",
    "the results have been stored for each diagram separately in a file .",
    "its size is @xmath49 ( @xmath50 in maple format ) .",
    "the expression for each diagram has the form @xmath51 where @xmath52 are master integrals and @xmath53 are 24 spinor amplitudes .    after summing all diagrams",
    "we find that the result is gauge invariant as it must be .",
    "each pentagon diagram separately gives a gauge invariant scalar 5-point integral - 15 in total .",
    "we observed a huge reduction in the number of scalar n - point ( n=4,3,2 ) integrals @xmath54 , @xmath55,@xmath56 .",
    "for example , from 240 integrals @xmath55 only 79 remain in the final answer .",
    "it should be mentioned that at the initial stage before taking into account the symmetries of the integrals the total amount of master integrals @xmath55 with different values of momenta and masses was more than 500 .",
    "a special routine has been added to the maple package which recognizes the symmetries of integrals . by permuting masses and momenta into lexicographical order , taking into account momentum conservation ,",
    "one obtains a set of independent standard integrals and hence a much more compact representation .",
    "the final gauge invariant result is stored in a file of about 1.2 mb in maple format .",
    "thus , it is still rather large for further numerical evaluations . working out a more compact representation of the result , mainly by optimizing ratios of huge polynomials depending on several variables",
    "is one of the problems .    to obtain the complete radiative correction to the observable differential cross section we still have to add the bremstrahlung correction to our result",
    "this work is in progress .",
    "one observation we made is that in the final result the pentagon diagrams yield terms of the form @xmath57 in fact , second rank @xmath26-point tensor integrals produce terms of the form @xmath58 with a coefficient which is singular at @xmath59 for @xmath60 . in our case , these terms originate from 2nd rank tensor integrals like @xmath61 the tensor integral here can be written in terms of scalar integrals with shifted dimension : @xmath62 where @xmath63 .",
    "different tensor structures give contributions to different of the abovementioned spinor amplitudes . by using the recurrence relations",
    "one gets @xmath64 the integral at the left hand side is uv and ir finite , however , in front of the integrals at the right hand side the spurious pole @xmath65 appears .",
    "so it looks like we have to evaluate the @xmath66 term in the expansion of the pentagon integrals .",
    "there are no such problems for the 3- and 4-point functions .    in fact multiplying ( [ spinors ] ) by the born term , summing over polarizations and",
    "taking the traces removes the problematic @xmath67 terms .",
    "however , if we would attempt to calculate the amplitude numerically before squaring it , we would have to work out first it s @xmath66-expansion .",
    "a possibility to avoid this problem is to use a different basis of master - integrals in higher dimensions .",
    "the idea to express one - loop tensor integrals in terms of integrals with shifted dimension was proposed in  @xcite and later in  @xcite .",
    "recurrence relations which allow us to reduce any one - loop integral with shifted dimension to a combination of integrals in generic dimension were given in  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "these were extended to massless integrals with both gram determinants zero in  @xcite .      a simple formula expressing any @xmath26-point integral in terms of integrals in higher dimensions was given in  @xcite .",
    "it reads @xmath68 the improved stability of numerical integrations of integrals in higher dimensions can be seen from their integral representation @xmath69 where @xmath70 if we transform integrals to the dimension @xmath71 ( assuming that @xmath33 ) then the expansion of @xmath72 for small @xmath73 reads @xmath74,\\ ] ] where +",
    "@xmath75 @xmath76    if we transform the integrals to dimension @xmath77 then the expansion of @xmath78 at small @xmath66 reads @xmath79,\\ ] ] where + @xmath80 we see that in the integrals @xmath81 there are no polynomials in the denominator and this is why these integrals in higher dimensions are more suitable for a direct numerical evaluation .    as an example we give the relations for some integrals in the logarithmic basis . in the latter for @xmath82",
    "we express the integrals @xmath83 in terms of integrals @xmath84 : @xmath85 @xmath86 where @xmath87    where the following notation is used : @xmath88 in these expression we see multiple occurrence of gram determinants and their derivatives .",
    "this fact may lead for some problems for kinematical regions where gram determinants are close to zero .",
    "however outside these regions we expect good numerical stability of these integrals .",
    "in fact there is a correspondence between the integrals in higher dimensions and the method advocated in  @xcite for a direct numerical calculation of loop integrals .",
    "for the one - loop case , ( [ reducejanddtod ] ) and ( [ reducedtod ] ) are the explicite solutions of the relations which are derived in  @xcite by exploiting the bernstein - tkachov theorem .",
