    "future studies of this source should focus on searching for definitive molecular outflow signatures , resolving dense gas tracers that are commonly associated with envelopes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , observing co transitions at higher spectral resolution to provide a better tracer of the velocity field , and reconciling the optical / near - infrared scattered light observations with the submillimeter results in an effort to converge on a consistent model of the local gas and dust structure .    considering the low stellar mass range implied for iras 04158 + 2805",
    ", it is difficult to reconcile the large mass reservoir and size of this environment with any formation scenario that relies on it being dynamically ejected from a more massive system ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . rather , the observed gas and dust structure is more consistent with the standard scenario , where an accretion disk and perhaps a remnant envelope developed around a single ( or binary ) source during the gravitational collapse of a molecular cloud core fragment .",
    "regardless of the precise value of @xmath15 , iras 04158 + 2805 is a remarkable example of the fact that the standard picture for star formation worked out for higher - mass stars is also applicable at the low end of the stellar mass function .",
    "we have presented new submillimeter observations of the molecular gas and dust around iras 04158 + 2805 , a young low - mass object in the taurus star - forming region .",
    "the data reveal a complex and surprising environment , from which we infer the following :    \\1 .",
    "a high aspect ratio ( @xmath64 ) dust structure with a projected diameter of @xmath01120au and estimated ( gas+dust ) mass of @xmath00.03m@xmath5 is noted in optical absorption and submillimeter continuum emission images .",
    "the resolved 883@xmath1 m data clearly demonstrate a central depression in the emission , suggesting a ring - like geometry with an inner radius of @xmath0250 - 300au . a variety of structures that may explain the observations are investigated , with a flattened envelope or circumbinary ring perhaps the most likely .",
    "spatially resolved co @xmath2=3@xmath32 line emission shows a velocity gradient along the major axis of the dust structure . assuming the gas traced by this transition is in keplerian orbital motion around a central source , the spatio - kinematic properties of the emission are used to estimate a central mass , @xmath65m@xmath5 ( with @xmath050% uncertainty ) .",
    "this estimate is roughly a factor of 2 higher than the mass range inferred from a reasonable effective temperature range and pre - main - sequence models , @xmath00.09 - 0.16m@xmath5 , but the significant uncertainties on both measurements do not formally rule out their mutual consistency .",
    "however , a roughly equal - mass binary system represents an intriguing possibility in this case , as it would naturally account for this possible @xmath15 discrepancy , a very high luminosity , and the ring - like geometry of the dust structure .",
    "the large spatial extent and mass of the complex gas and dust environment surrounding iras 04158 + 2805 would be difficult to retain in the dynamical ejection models used to explain the formation of such low - mass objects . instead , this case appears to illustrate that the standard gravitational collapse models applied to stars with masses up to @xmath02 - 3m@xmath5 can be extrapolated down to objects with @xmath66 - 0.3m@xmath5 .",
    "more detailed models of the iras 04158 + 2805 gas and dust structure and specialized observations are recommended .",
    "we thank f.  mnard and g.  duchne for encouraging our interest in this source , and elise furlan for kindly providing the mid - infrared spectrum .",

    "<S> we present high spatial resolution submillimeter array observations and supplementary single - dish photometry of the molecular gas and dust around iras 04158 + 2805 , a young source with spectral type m5-m6 in the taurus star - forming region . a bright , highly elongated dust structure that extends 8   ( @xmath01120au ) in diameter </S>",
