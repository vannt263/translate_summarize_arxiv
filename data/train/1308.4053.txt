    "building low dimensional electronic systems has been a focus of intense interest since the discovery of low dimensional materials such as carbon nanotubes and graphene .",
    "recent theoretical and experimental works on topological order of materials @xcite have led to the discovery of a different route to construct low dimensional electronic systems through a new class of materials , called topological insulators ( tis ) . in these materials , surface states or edge states arise in the boundaries of bulk insulating materials and can host electrons in low dimensions . depending on the dimension of the materials , a two - dimensional ti hosts one - dimensional gapless edge states while a three - dimensional ti hosts two - dimensional gapless dirac fermions .",
    "these low dimensional surface states or edges arise from z@xmath0 topological order of bulk states kane and are protected by symmetries of bulk states .",
    "theoretically , the fundamental reason for the emergence of surface states or edge states in ti is due to underlying z@xmath0 topological structure in the bulk state .",
    "since topological order is protected by associated symmetries @xcite , surface states and edge states in tis are considered to be robust against bulk disorders that do not break the time - reversal symmetry that is associated with z@xmath0 topological order .",
    "the robustness against disorders is the key to potential technological applications and hence a great effort has been dedicated to understanding the behavior of the topological materials in the presence of disorders @xcite .",
    "indeed , surface states or edge states are shown to persist in the presence of weak disorders @xcite .",
    "however , it is also found that in the presence of disorders , anomalous transmutation between ti and insulators with trivial topology may happen @xcite . in particular , in computer simulations of a hgte quantum well , it is discovered that an ordinary insulating state can be transformed into a topological insulator , called topological anderson insulator @xcite .",
    "the mechanism behind the transformation is shown to be related to the renormalization of z@xmath1 topological index by disorders near the dirac points @xcite and the transformation may also depend on type of disorders @xcite . hence while ti is robust against perturbations , the exact phase boundary for ti may subject to change in the presence of disorders .",
    "experimentally , it is found that strong perturbations such as lattice defects often occur in topological insulators @xcite . from the experience in other similar materials characterized by dirac hamiltonian ,",
    "the presence of lattice defects often induces peculiar properties . in the case of graphene",
    ", it was found that vacancies can give rise to magnetic moments and turn graphene into a ferromagnet @xcite . for topological insulators",
    ", it is shown that lattice defects with non - trivial topology also induce bound states @xcite . however , in the tetradymite semiconductor bi@xmath0se@xmath2 that has been most extensively investigated , the most common observed lattice defects are selenium vacancies , which are not topological defects . these vacancies are believed to give rise to electron doping and increase the conductivity of bulk states dramatically @xcite .",
    "furthermore , there are also evidences that vacancies may induce an impurity band that affects current transportation @xcite . since vacancies do not break time - reversal symmetry , their presence is consistent with symmetries that are associated with z@xmath0 topological order .",
    "however , instead of being weak , vacancies are considered as strong perturbations and may change the topological structure of ti .",
    "it is therefore interesting and crucial to examine robustness of ti in the presence of vacancies .    in this paper",
    ", we will examine the stability of z@xmath0 topological order in the presence of vacancies using the kane - mele model .",
    "it is shown that even though vacancies are not classified as topological defects in the kane - mele model @xcite , the original z@xmath0 topological order insures that midgap bound states are induced only in topologically nontrivial phase .",
    "based on green s function analysis of edge states @xcite , we show that these midgap bound states are remanent edge states and form an impurity band in the presence of many vacancies .",
    "we shall show that the impurity band coexists with edge states when the z@xmath0 topological order persists until the spectral weights of dirac cones near dirac points are depleted .",
    "finally , we briefly extend our analyses to three dimensions and show that there must be midgap bound states associated with point vacancies or line of vacancies in 3d tis as well .",
    "we start with the kane - mele model on a honeycomb lattice .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xcite @xmath3where @xmath4 creates an electron at lattice site @xmath5 .",
    "the first term accounts for nearest - neighbor hoppings .",
    "the second term is a spin - orbit interaction between next nearest neighbors , in which @xmath6 with @xmath7 and @xmath8 being two nearest - neighbor bonds that connect site @xmath9 to site @xmath5 , and @xmath10 are the pauli matrices .",
    "the third term is the rashba coupling .",
    "the fourth term characterizes the sublattice site energies with @xmath11 @xmath12 for @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) sites .",
    "this term will be considered only in this section .",
    "the last term is the random disorder potential that models the impurities , where @xmath15 takes a nonvanishing value of @xmath16 only at impurity sites . in the usual treatment of disorder potential",
    ", it often assumes that @xmath15 is smooth and is characterized by its correlation function @xmath17 . here",
    ", however , by taking @xmath18 , @xmath5 site is excluded for electrons to visit and hence the limit @xmath18 simulates a vacancy at @xmath19 site . as we shall see , the new ingredient of the lattice vacancy is the possibility of inducing bound states near a vacancy site , which can not be obtained perturbatively by using @xmath17 . note that vacancies can be also modeled by cutting all relevant couplings to sites of vacancies and it can be shown that this approach yields the same results in low energy sectors where energy bands occupy . in the following ,",
    "all energies and lengths will be in units of @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( lattice constant ) respectively .    , which belongs to @xmath22 sublattice .",

    "@xcite , far from a vacancy in 2d , there is no non - trivial winding number associated with the hole introduced by a vacancy and hence a vacancy is not a topological defect .",
    "however , this does not imply that there is no midgap bound state associated with a vacancy .",
    "in fact , in the continuum limit for hgte where the dirac point is at @xmath24 point , by approximating a vacancy as a circular hole with radius @xmath25 , it is found that midgap bound states survive with energies being half of the gap magnitude in the limit @xmath26 @xcite . in the continuum limit ,",
    "electrons that occupy the midgap bound states can be viewed as dirac fermions in a particular curved space @xcite .",
    "hence a midgap bound state in a single vacancy results from a superposition of edge states that are curved into the circular surrounding of the vacancy .",

    "[ fig1](a ) , a vacancy has a finite size and its surrounding is not in a circular shape . in addition , dirac points are located at finite wave vectors for honeycomb lattices .",
    "it is necessary to examine whether there are midgap bound states associated with vacancies .    to clarify the issue of whether midgap bound states will be induced by a single vacancy ,",

    "hence there are helical edges states for any edges .",
    "furthermore , the energy spectrum of edge states is a dirac - like spectrum @xcite . for a given edge along @xmath51-direction ,",

    "the analyses shown here show that direct depletion of the dirac cones is the main mechanism for transition from the tis to trivial insulators for low concentrations of vacancies . for higher concentration of vacancies , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , the impurity band starts to overlap with energy bands and destructs of z2 topological order eventually .",
    "in summary , we have shown that vacancies in the ti phase of the kane - mele model always induce midgap bound states .",
    "these midgap bound states result from curving edge states into the surroundings of vacancies .",
    "the same reasoning can be generalized to investigate point vacancies or line vacancies in 3d tis . in this case",
    ", the t - matrix still obeys eq .",
    "( tmatrix ) . by introducing a plane of vacancies passing through @xmath180 that cuts infinite 3d lattice into two semi - infinite 3d lattices and following similar considerations that lead to eq .",
    "( [ integration ] ) , one arrives at @xmath181where @xmath182 and @xmath183 are wave vectors in two orthogonal directions of the plane with vacancies and @xmath184 is the coordinate of the axis in perpendicular to the plane . for 3d tis , since there are midgap surface states characterized by spectrum @xmath185 with @xmath186 , the same reasoning leads to the conclusion that in the low energy sector , @xmath74 must take the following form @xmath187 ,   \\label{2dg}\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath188 is the speed of electrons in surface states , @xmath189 is the energy of the dirac point , and @xmath190 is the weight associated with @xmath191 and is a smooth function of @xmath28 .",
    "hence we arrive at a conclusion similar to eq .",
    "( vacancystate ) with @xmath89 being replaced by the gap @xmath192 of @xmath168 that lies in directions perpendicular to @xmath193 . as a result",
    ", one also concludes that there must be a pair of degenerated states inside the energy gap for a single vacancy in 3d topological insulators .",
    "this conclusion is in agreement with direct numerical simulations investigated in ref .",
    "similarly , for a singe line of vacancies along @xmath194 direction , performing a partial fourier transform on the hamiltonian along @xmath194 reduces the problem to a 2d problem with a point vacancy .",
    "hence there must be a pair of degenerated states inside the energy gap for every @xmath195 mode along each line of vacancies in 3d tis .",
    "in addition to showing that midgap bound states must arise in the presence of a single vacancy , we also show that an impurity band emerges when the number of vacancies increases .",
    "the impurity band mixes directly with edge states . however , the impurity band always has trivial topological structure and the z @xmath0 topological order persists in both the conduction band and the valence band .",
    "hence edge states exist between the impurity band and perturbed conduction or valence band . the mechanism behind the transition from ti to a trivial insulator due to vacancies is shown to be resulted from the depletion of dirac cones .",
    "furthermore , due to different speeds of depleting dirac cones , the transition can be either first order when vacancies are randomly chosen at _ a _ sites or continuous when vacancies are randomly chosen equally at _ a _ sites or _",
    "b _ sites .",
    "while so far in this work we only consider effects of vacancies , our results are not restricted to the limit @xmath46 . for finite and large @xmath16 ,",
    "( [ ebound ] ) is modified with a correction of @xmath196 .",
    "hence midgap bound states induced by vacancies are shifted by the order of @xmath196 , in agreement with results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . the phase boundary for midgap bound states shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] then remains the same . as a result ,",
    "the impurity band is also shifted by a similar amount .",
    "the majority of our results remains valid and provides useful characterization of electronic states induced by point defects in tis ."
