    "in the physics of high-@xmath0 cuprates , optimizing their @xmath0 remains a fundamental yet still open problem .",
    "empirically , important parameters that control @xmath0 have been identified for the cuprates , i.e. , chemical composition , structural parameters , the number of layers , etc , besides the doping concentration . for the structural parameters",
    "specifically , several key quantities have been suggested : the bond length between copper and in - plane oxygen(@xmath7 , defined in fig.[fig1])@xcite , and the cu - apical oxygen distance ( @xmath8 ) @xcite .",
    "now , the pressure effect is exceptionally valuable as an _ in situ _ way to probe the structure - dependence of @xmath0 . regarding this ,",
    "two general observations have been made for the cuprates : ( i ) @xmath0 tends to be enhanced under hydrostatic pressure , while ( ii ) uniaxial pressures produce anisotropic responses of @xmath0 .",
    "more precisely , ( i ) @xmath0 has been shown to monotonically increase for pressure @xmath9 gpa @xcite .",
    "as for ( ii ) , an @xmath10-axis compression generally raises @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) , while @xmath11-axis compression has an opposite effect ( @xmath2)@xcite . moreover , the magnitude of the pressure coefficient becomes smaller for materials having higher @xmath0 s , as summarized in fig.3 of ref.@xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present study is to theoretically reveal the origin of these general trends , focusing on the single - layered cuprates for clarity , and to shed light on a possibility of further optimizing @xmath0 .    conventionally , the theoretical model primarily used for the cuprates is a one - band hubbard model based on the @xmath4 orbital ( or sometimes cu-@xmath12o-@xmath13 orbital ) .",
    "recently , we have shown@xcite that the @xmath5 orbital component strongly mixes into the states on the fermi surface in the relatively low-@xmath0 cuprates such as la@xmath14cuo@xmath15 ( la214)@xcite , where the hybridization works destructively against @xmath16-wave superconductivity .",
    "while there have been some theoretical studies in the literature focusing on the role of the @xmath5 orbital@xcite , refs.@xcite conclude that larger the level offset @xmath17 between the @xmath4 and @xmath5 wannier orbitals , higher the @xmath0 , where @xmath17 is governed by the apical - oxygen height and the inter - layer distance .",
    "one might then presume that the effects of uniaxial pressures can simply be captured in terms of the pressure - dependence of @xmath17 affected by the crystal field .",
    "however , we reveal in the present work that the physics is not so simple .",
    "we find that , while the variation of @xmath0 under pressure is indeed affected by @xmath17 , especially in the relatively low-@xmath0 cuprates , the large @xmath17 values in higher-@xmath0 cuprates such as hgba@xmath14cuo@xmath15 ( hg1201 ) make their relevance to the @xmath0 variation smaller .",
    "we shall show that we have to turn our attention rather to the cu@xmath6 level , which is raised with pressure , resulting in a less rounded ( i.e. , better nested ) fermi surface .",
    "this , along with the increase in the band width , is shown to cause a higher @xmath0 under pressure .",
    "these results can be unified into a picture in which higher @xmath0 can be achieved by the `` distillation '' of the main ( i.e. , @xmath4 ) band , namely , the smaller the hybridization of other orbital components the better .",
    "our theoretical procedure is as follows .",
    "we first determine the lattice structure under uniaxial and hydrostatic pressures from a first - principles band calculation with the wien2k package@xcite . from the band structure ,",
    "we construct the maximally - localized wannier orbitals@xcite to obtain the hopping integrals for a two - orbital tight - binding model that takes into account both the @xmath4 and the @xmath5 wannier orbitals explicitly@xcite .      in this two - orbital model , we consider the onsite intra- and inter - orbital electron - electron repulsive interactions , which are given , in the standard notation , as @xmath18    where @xmath19 denote the sites while @xmath20 the two orbitals , the electron - electron interactions comprise the intraorbital repulsion @xmath21 , interorbital repulsion @xmath22 , and the hund s coupling @xmath23(= pair - hopping interaction @xmath24 ) . here",
    "we take @xmath25 ev , @xmath26 ev , and @xmath23=0.3 ev@xcite .",
    "these values conform to widely accepted , first - principles estimations for the cuprates that @xmath21 is 7 - 10@xmath27 ( with @xmath28 0.45 ev ) , while @xmath29 . here",
    "we also observe the orbital su(2 ) requirement , @xmath30 .",
    "to study the superconductivity in this multi - orbital hubbard model , we apply the fluctuation exchange approximation(flex)@xcite . in flex , we start with dyson equation to obtain the renormalized green s function , which is , in the multi - orbital case , a matrix in the orbital representation as @xmath31 , where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are orbital indices .",
    "the bubble and ladder diagrams constructed from the renormalized green s function are then summed to obtain the spin and charge susceptibilities , @xmath34 @xmath35 where @xmath36 with wave vector @xmath37 and with matsubara frequency @xmath38 , and the irreducible susceptibility is @xmath39 with the interaction matrices @xmath40    @xmath41    with these susceptibilities , the fluctuation - mediated effective interactions are obtained , which are used to calculate the self - energy . then the renormalized green s functions are determined self - consistently from dyson equation .",
    "the green s functions and the susceptibilities are used to obtain the spin - singlet pairing interaction in the form @xmath42 and this is used in the linearized eliashberg equation , @xmath43 the superconducting transition temperature , @xmath0 , corresponds to the temperature at which the maximum eigenvalue @xmath44 of the eliashberg equation reaches unity , so that @xmath44 at a fixed temperature can be used as a measure for @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath0 of the hg cuprate is experimentally about three times higher than in la cuprate@xcite , so we calculate @xmath44 by putting @xmath45 ev for la and @xmath46 ev for hg for a clearer comparison .",
    "as we shall see , the eigenvalues discussed in the present study are away from unity ( i.e. , the temperature is higher than @xmath0 ) due to the limitation in the number of matsubara frequencies and the @xmath47-point meshes .",
    "therefore , for the la cuprate in particular , we restrict ourselves to qualitative argument for the @xmath0 variation under pressure .",
    "for the hg cuprate , on the other hand , we can go down to lower temperatures @xmath48 where the eigenvalue approaches unity , and we have checked that the conclusions drawn from the @xmath46 calculation hold also for @xmath49 .",
    "moreover , we estimate @xmath50 for hg with the @xmath49 results , as will be discussed in the final part of the paper .",
    "we fix the total band filling ( number of electrons/ site ) at @xmath51 , for which the filling of the main band amounts to 0.85 ( 15 % hole doping ) .",
    "we take a @xmath52 @xmath47-point meshes for the three - dimensional lattice with @xmath53 matsubara frequencies .",

    "let us begin with the case of uniaxial pressure .",

    "this is fit by the standard burch - marnaghan equation@xcite to determine the most stable structure with a unit cell volume @xmath55 , the @xmath10-axis lattice constant @xmath56 , and the @xmath11-axis @xmath57 . for simplicity",

    "the results are in good agreement with experimental values for the optimally doped compounds@xcite .",

    "lines are guide for the eye , with the dashed horizontal ones indicating the original values .",
    ", width=226 ]    figure [ fig2 ] plots the eigenvalue of the eliashberg equation @xmath44 against the lattice compression @xmath64 and @xmath65 for each compound .",
    "the result shows that ( i ) in both compounds @xmath44 increases as @xmath64 is reduced , while decreases as @xmath65 is reduced , and ( ii ) the absolute value of the variations of @xmath44 is larger in la than in hg .",
    "these features are in qualitative agreement with the experimental observations summarized in fig.3 of ref.@xcite , which shows @xmath1 and @xmath2 for both materials , with larger @xmath69 in la than in hg@xcite . to be more precise ,",
    "while the compressibility in the @xmath10 direction is nearly the same between the two materials , that in the @xmath11 direction is about three times larger in hg than in la@xcite @xmath70 , but even if we take this into account , we find that @xmath71 is still larger for la than for hg in our calculation .",
    "now we want to pinpoint the origin of this @xmath0 variation against uniaxial pressures . in both materials , @xmath72 increases as @xmath64",
    "is reduced , while it decreases when @xmath65 is reduced .",
    "this is natural , since the @xmath10 @xmath73 reduction pushes the in - plane ( out - of - plane ) ligands toward cu , resulting in a larger ( smaller ) crystal - field splitting and hence larger ( smaller ) @xmath17@xcite , as schematically depicted in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "one might then expect that this alone is the origin of the @xmath0 variation , since @xmath17 and @xmath0 are positively correlated@xcite . to see if this is indeed the case ,",
    "we have considered a case where we increase @xmath17 alone to its value at @xmath74 or @xmath75 , and obtain @xmath44 with flex .",
    "the results are indicated in fig.[fig2 ] with arrows labeled as `` @xmath17 '' . in la ,",
    "the resulting @xmath44 is very close to those obtained for the actual compression , which implies that the main origin for @xmath44 variation under uniaxial pressure comes from @xmath17 .",
    "by contrast , for hg , the @xmath17 contribution is too small to account for the actual @xmath44 variance ( see the blowups in fig.[fig2 ] ) .",
    "the reason for this is that in hg , @xmath17 is @xmath76 times larger than in la ( table [ table1 ] ) , so that the effect of the @xmath5 orbital is tiny , while the contribution to the @xmath0 variation coming from other changes in the electronic structure become comparable with that from @xmath17 .",
    "in particular , we focus on the change in the energy difference @xmath77 between cu@xmath6 and cu@xmath4 orbitals .",
    "in fact , it has been shown that the cu@xmath6 orbital , which is implicitly included in the @xmath4 wannier orbital in the present scheme , affects the second @xmath78 and third @xmath79 neighbor hoppings@xcite .",
    "note that the @xmath6 orbital can be integrated out ( implicitly included in the wannier orbitals ) prior to the many - body analysis , since the @xmath6 orbital sits in energy well away from the fermi level in contrast to the @xmath5 orbital ( fig.[fig1])@xcite .",
    "smaller @xmath77 results in larger @xmath80 within the @xmath4 orbital sector , resulting in a more rounded fermi surface , which degrades @xmath16-wave superconductivity@xcite .    to show how the roundness varies with @xmath77 , we consider a three - orbital model which explicitly includes the cu 4s wannier orbitals for the hg cuprate@xcite , and show in fig.[fig3 ] the fermi surface for various values of @xmath81 .",
    "we stress here that , while larger @xmath17 and larger @xmath67 ( or smaller @xmath77 ) both give more rounded fermi surface , their effects on @xmath0 are opposite . under pressure , @xmath77 is enhanced , which in turn reduces @xmath67 . in fig.[fig2 ] , we show the effect of hypothetically reducing @xmath67 down to its values at @xmath74 or @xmath75 . while the effect of @xmath67 is much smaller than that of @xmath17 in la , the two effects are found to be comparable in hg .",
    "hypothetical varied from 6ev ( nearly original value ) to 12ev .",
    ", width=302 ]      in addition to @xmath17 and @xmath67 , the band width @xmath66 ( the energy difference between @xmath82 and @xmath83 ) of the main band is also altered by pressure . in la",
    "the change in @xmath44 due to the modification of @xmath66 is small compared to that arising from @xmath17 , but in hg the @xmath66 contribution is comparable with those from @xmath17 and @xmath67 , which in fact provides a full understanding of the net @xmath44 variation under uniaxial pressure .",
    "namely , the @xmath10 @xmath73 reduction results in an increase ( decrease ) of the band width as expected , which enhances ( suppresses ) @xmath0 .",
    "the increase of the band width results in a suppression of @xmath84 , hence the electron correlation effect .",
    "this reduces the pairing interaction , while the self - energy correction due to the spin fluctuations is reduced at the same time .",
    "the former has an effect of enhancing @xmath0 , while the latter suppresses superconductivity . in the case of hg compound",
    ", the latter effect supersedes the former , resulting in an enhanced @xmath0 .",
    "it should be noted that the contribution from @xmath67 , while relatively small for uniaxial compression , enhances @xmath0 for _ both _ of the @xmath10- and @xmath11- axis compressions in marked contrast with the contributions from @xmath17 and @xmath66 . this will become important in our analysis for hydrostatic pressures below .",
    "having identified the ingredients that determine the @xmath0 variation against uniaxial pressures , let us now move on to _ hydrostatic _ compression . here",
    "we optimize the lattice structure at a fixed unit cell volume @xmath85 by varying poisson s ratio , which we fit to the burch - marnaghan equation to obtain the most stable @xmath54 .",
    "notably enough , for hydrostatic pressures @xmath44 in fig.[fig4 ] increases with the volume compression in _ both _ materials .",
    "this result qualitatively agrees with experimental results@xcite . to understand its mechanism , we can ,",
    "as done above for uniaxial pressures , decompose the pressure effect on @xmath44 into the contributions from @xmath17 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 ( arrows in fig .",
    "[ fig4](a)(b ) ) .",
    "we can then realize that the variation of @xmath17 against hydrostatic pressure is not as straightforward as in uniaxial pressures .",
    "namely , we can look at @xmath17 along with the  aspect ratio \" @xmath86 against the volume reduction in fig.[fig4](c)(d ) , where @xmath8 is the apical oxygen height and @xmath7 the in - plane cu - o distance . under hydrostatic pressure",
    ", @xmath86 decreases in both materials because of the larger compressibility along the @xmath11 direction . one",
    "might then expect that this would reduce the crystal field splitting and hence @xmath17 , but actually this is by no means always the case . in fact , @xmath17 increases with pressure for la , which is because the cu - o distance decreases , resulting in a larger crystal - field effect .",
    "thus the @xmath0 enhancement in la mainly comes from the increase of @xmath17 .",
    "the above argument for la does not directly apply to hg , since the original apical - oxygen height is larger , so that there is more room for the cuo octahedron to shrink along the @xmath11-axis than in la .",
    "therefore , the @xmath86 reduction is larger , resulting in a nearly constant @xmath17 against the decrease of @xmath87 .",
    "this further makes @xmath17 irrelevant to the @xmath0 variation in hg under hydrostatic pressures . as seen in fig.[fig4 ] with arrows , main contributions to the @xmath0 enhancement",
    "come from @xmath66 and @xmath67 , with similar magnitudes . as shown in fig.[fig4](e)(f ) , the decrease of @xmath67 originally comes from an increase of the level offset @xmath77 introduced above .",
    "the relatively large enhancement of the cu@xmath6 level under hydrostatic pressure can be understood from fig.[fig1 ] ( right ) , where all the ligands approaching cu push up the energy level of the extended and isotropic cu@xmath6 orbital to a larger extent than for the localized and anisotropic cu@xmath88 orbitals .",
    "thus a message here is the _ hydrostatic and uniaxial pressures exert significantly different effects_. specifically , the importance of @xmath67 becomes prominent in hg in hydrostatic pressure because the @xmath67-contribution is positive for both of @xmath10- and @xmath11-axis compressions , while @xmath66-contribution has opposite effects as shown in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "as for the band - width effect , we have found here that hg exhibits an effect opposite to la for the present electron - electron interaction strength . to elaborate this ,",
    "we have performed a flex calculation for various interaction strengths over @xmath89 , and found that increasing the band width always results in an enhanced @xmath44 in hg within the considered compression range , while in la a similar effect is obtained only for @xmath90 , with the effect reversing for smaller @xmath21 .",
    "we have further noticed that this `` sign change '' in the band - width effect against @xmath21 is peculiar to the systems having smaller @xmath17 . at any rate ,",
    "the band - width effect is much smaller than the effect of @xmath17 in la , so that the effect of pressure - dependence of @xmath21 does not affect the present conclusion .",
    "let us finally comment on the relation between the @xmath44 variation for hydrostatic pressures and the @xmath0 enhancement in the actual pressure experiments . to see this ,",
    "we have extended our calculation to lower temperatures for hg , where @xmath44 becomes closer to unity ( i.e. , @xmath91 approaches @xmath0 ) .",
    "we find @xmath92 at @xmath45 ev for @xmath93 , and the same value of @xmath44 attained at @xmath94 ev for @xmath55 , so the temperature difference ( a rough estimate of @xmath95 ) amounts to @xmath96 k. since the compressibility is @xmath97 gpa@xmath98@xcite , this implies @xmath99 k / gpa , which has the same order of magnitude found experimentally@xcite .",
    "to summarize , we have identified the parameters that govern the @xmath0 variation of the single - layered cuprates under pressure . for lower-@xmath0 materials with small @xmath17 as exemplified by la@xmath14cuo@xmath15 , @xmath0 is sensitive to @xmath17 , which is identified to be the main contribution . for higher-@xmath0 materials with large @xmath17",
    "as exemplified by hgba@xmath14cuo@xmath15 , @xmath0 is rather insensitive to @xmath17 , and important contributions are revealed to come instead from the fermi surface roundness governed by the cu@xmath6 orbital as well as the variation of the band width @xmath66 .",
    "these effects coming from the electronic structure in the multi - orbital systems can be unified into a single picture in which the orbital distillation of the main band results in a higher @xmath0 .",
    "the present study can also shed light on a materials - science avenue for optimizing @xmath0 .",
    "the strategy for enhancing @xmath0 , as conceived here , is : ( 1 ) keep the level offset between the @xmath4 and @xmath5 orbitals large ( ideally , larger than @xmath21 as shown in fig.[fig1 ] left ) , ( 2 ) expand the level offset between the cu@xmath6 and the cu@xmath100 as much as possible  this makes the fermi surface more nested ( fig.[fig1 ] right ) , and ( 3 ) tune the band width @xmath66 to a moderate value . in this sense , it is important to keep the distance @xmath8 between apical oxygen and cu atom , and it is also important to decrease the in - plane cu - o bond length @xmath7 . in other words ,",
    "the desired situation for optimizing @xmath0 should have an @xmath101 biaxial chemical pressure which reduces the length @xmath7 from those in existing compounds , with the value of @xmath8 kept high .",
    "this may be coupled to the possibility of the level offset @xmath77 controlled independently of @xmath17 by tuning length @xmath7@xcite .",
