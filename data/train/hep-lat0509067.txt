    "magnetic moments are an important fundamental property of particles .",
    "they determine dynamical response of a bound system to a soft external stimulus , and provide valuable insight into internal strong interaction structure .",
    "efforts to compute the magnetic moment on the lattice can be divided into two categories .",
    "one is from form factors which involves three - point functions  @xcite .",
    "the other is the background field method using only two - point functions  @xcite .",
    "the form factor method requires an extrapolation to @xmath1 that is potentially fallible due to the discrete momentum on the lattice  @xcite .",
    "the background field method , on the other hand , is free from this problem since a static magnetic field is applied to the gauge background . here",
    "we report a calculation in this method .",
    "it is an extension of our work on electric and magnetic polarizabilities  @xcite .",
    "in order to place a magnetic field on the lattice , we construct an analogy to the continuum case .",
    "the fermion action is modified by the minimal coupling prescription @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the charge of the fermion field and @xmath4 is the vector potential describing the background field . on the lattice ,",
    "the prescription amounts to a modified link variable @xmath5 choosing @xmath6 , a constant magnetic field b can be introduced in the @xmath7-direction .",
    "then the phase factor is in the y - links @xmath8 on a finite lattice with periodic boundary conditions , to get a constant magnetic field , b has to be quantized by the condition @xmath9 to ensure that the magnetic phase factor is periodic in the x - direction",
    ". however , for @xmath10 and @xmath11 , the lowest field would give the proton a mass shift of about 390 mev , which is too large ( the proton is severely distorted ) .",
    "in this work , we abandon the quantization condition and choose to work with smaller fields . to minimize the boundary effects , we work with fixed ( or dirichlet ) b.c . in the x - direction and large @xmath12 , so that quarks originating in the middle of the lattice have little chance of propagating to the edge .",
    "we use @xmath0 lattice at @xmath13 , and six kappa values @xmath14=0.1515 , 0.1525 , 0.1535 , 0.1540 , 0.1545 , 0.1555 , corresponding to pion mass of 1015 , 908 , 794 , 732 , 667 , 522 mev . the critical value of kappa is @xmath15=0.1571 . the strange quark mass is set at @xmath14=0.1535 .",
    "the source location for the quark propagators is ( x , y , z , t)=(12,1,1,2 ) .",
    "we analyzed 87 configurations .",
    "the following five dimensionless numbers @xmath16=+0.00036 , -0.00072 , + 0.00144 , -0.00288 , + 0.00576 give four small b fields ( two positive , two negative ) at @xmath17=-0.00108 , + 0.00216 , -0.00432 , + 0.00864 for both u and d ( or s ) quarks .",
    "note that `` small '' here is in the sense that the mass shift is only a fraction of the proton mass : @xmath18 1 to 5% at the smallest pion mass .",
    "in absolute terms , the field is enormous : @xmath19 tesla .",
    "the mass shift in the presence of small fields can be expanded as a polynomial in b , @xmath20 to eliminate the contamination from the even - power terms , we calculate mass shifts both in the field @xmath21 and its reverse @xmath22 for each value of @xmath21 , then take the difference and divide by 2 .",
    "so in terms of cost , our calculation is equivalent to 11 separate spectrum calculations : 5 original @xmath23 values , 5 reversed , plus the one at zero field to set the baseline . in light of future dynamical simulations ,",
    "the factor can be reduced to 3 if only one nonzero field is desired .",
    "another benefit of repeating the calculation with the field reversed is that by taking the average of @xmath24 and @xmath25 in the same dataset , one can eliminate the odd - powered terms in the mass shift .",
    "the coefficient of the leading quadratic term is directly related to the so - called magnetic dipole polarizability ( @xmath26 ) .    for a dirac particle of spin @xmath27 in uniform fields , @xmath28 where the upper sign means spin up and the lower sign means spin - down , and @xmath29 . in our data , @xmath30 and @xmath31",
    "correspond to the ` 11 ' and ` 22 ' diagonal components of the baryon correlation function in the absence of the background field .",
    "they are the same within statistical fluctuations . the average of the two components is usually used to extract the proton mass .",
    "we tried the following three methods to extract the g factors , and found they are equivalent within statistical errors .",
    "@xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 the results quoted are from eq .",
    "( [ g1 ] ) .",
    "fig .  [ emass - octp - shift - m4 ] displays a typical effective mass plot at the six kappa values for the strongest magnetic field for the proton .",
    "good plateaus exist for all six quark masses .",
    "our results are extracted from the time window 12 to 15 .",
    "[ octp_linear_shift ] displays a typical mass shift , defined as @xmath35 from eq .",
    "( [ g1 ] ) , as a function of the field for the proton .",
    "there is good linear behavior going through the origin for all the fields when the quark mass is heavy , an indication that contamination from the higher terms has been effectively eliminated .",
    "this is also confirmed numerically by the smallness of the coefficient in the @xmath36 term as shown in the same figure . at the lightest quark mass ( lower right corner ) , there is a slight deviation from linear behavior .",
    "for this reason , we only use the two smallest field values to do the linear fit at all the quark masses .",

    ", we have scaled the results by the factor @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the mass of the particle measured in the same calculation at each quark mass .",
    "the line is a simple chiral fit using the ansatz @xmath40 there is a lot of effort in the literature on magnetic moments and their chiral extrapolations based on effective field theories  @xcite .",
    "although different approaches produce the same chiral behavior near the chiral limit , there are issues surrounding the range of validity and model - independence away from the chiral limit .",
    "the lowest pion mass in our results ( around 500 mev ) is probably too large for a meaningful application of the results from these studies .",
    "our goal here is to present the lattice data .",
    "the simple ansatz in eq .",
    "( [ chiral1 ] ) serves only to show that there is onset of non - analytic behavior as pion mass is lowered , so a linear extrapolation is probably not a good idea .",
    "to get some idea about the systematic uncertainty in the chiral fit , we tried two other different forms , one is @xmath41 and the other the pade form  @xcite @xmath42 the extrapolated value to the physical point is 3.04(6 ) for the proton and -1.84(3 ) for the neutron from eq .",

    "so the only difference is the spatial box size ( @xmath48 vs. @xmath49 ) .",
    "assuming the lattice spacing is the same ( a=0.1 fm ) on the two lattices , the dimentionless combination @xmath50 for the lightest pion is about 6.2 on the @xmath47 , and 4.2 on the @xmath46 .",

    ", we should repeat the calculation on a larger lattice , say @xmath51 .",
    "but it is currently beyond our computing resources .",
    "in conclusion , we have computed the magnetic moments of the baryon octet and decuplet on the lattice using the background field method and standard lattice technology .",
    "overall , our results are consistent with experimental observations .",
    "detailed comparison with experiment must await a full account of systematic errors present in the results , such as finite - volume effects .",

    "only mass shifts are required .",
    "this may facilitate the push to smaller pion masses , perhaps with the help of chiral fermions ( overlap , domain - wall , twisted mass , ... ) .",
