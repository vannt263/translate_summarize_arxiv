    "the obtained system of @xmath222 equations in @xmath6 variables is overdetermined when  @xmath119 .",

    "this program was realized in  @xcite .",

    "then the motion of the vertices @xmath230 during the flexion is parametrized by @xmath231    notice that , once this formula is written , the constancy of the edge lengths of the cross - polytope can be checked by an easy immediate computation .",
    "it follows directly from the construction that the tangents of the halves of dihedral angles of this cross - polytope are proportional to each other during the flexion .",
    "hence the correct statement is as follows : the tangents of the halves of dihedral angles of the cross - polytope are either directly or inversely proportional to each other during the flexion . ] . if @xmath112 , then the obtained family of flexible cross - polytopes turns into bricard s flexible octahedra of the third type . for them ,",
    "the fact that the tangents of the halves of dihedral angles are either directly or inversely proportional to each other during the flexion was known to bricard  @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , the simplest from the algebraic viewpoint family of flexible cross - polytope turns into the most complicated from the geometric viewpoint type of flexible octahedra .",
    "more complicated one - parametric families of solutions of the systems of equations   can be written in jacobi s elliptic functions .",
    "the first who noticed that flexions of spherical quadrilaterals , which are equivalent to flexions of tetrahedral angles , can be parametrized in elliptic functions was darboux  @xcite .",

    "characteristic function of  @xmath9 with respect to  @xmath313 _ , by computing the algebraic intersection number of a generic curve  @xmath256 from  @xmath257 to  @xmath313 with the @xmath4-dimensional cycle  @xmath251 .",
    "then @xmath314 where @xmath315 is the standard volume element in  @xmath129 .",
    "the characteristic functions of  @xmath9 with respect to two points  @xmath316 and  @xmath317 differ by an integral constant .",
    "hence the corresponding integrals in the right - hand side of   differ by an element of  @xmath318 .",
    "thus the generalised oriented volume of  @xmath9 is well defined as an element of  @xmath309 .",
    "the bellows conjecture is obviously not true for polyhedra in  @xmath129 if we allow them to contain two antipodal points .",
    "indeed , consider a flexible polygon with non - constant area in the equatorial great sphere  @xmath319 , and take the bipyramid ( the suspension ) over it with vertices at the poles of  @xmath161 .",
    "we obtain a flexible polyhedron in  @xmath161 with non - constant volume . iterating this construction ,",
    "we obtain flexible polyhedra with non - constant volumes in the spheres  @xmath129 for all @xmath16 . hence the bellows conjecture for non - euclidean spaces",
    "was usually formulated as follows .      in 1997",
    "alexandrov constructed an example of a flexible polyhedron in  @xmath320 with non - constant generalised oriented volume , which disproved the bellows conjecture in  @xmath320 .",
    "so the general expectation was that the bellows conjecture is not true for any non - euclidean space .",
    "this expectation was supported by the following result obtained by the author  @xcite using the classification of flexible cross - polytopes .",
    "theorem  [ theorem_bc_lob ] makes plausible that certain weaker form of the bellows conjecture for spheres is still true despite of existing counterexamples to the initial version of the conjecture .",
    "the following result by the author  @xcite shows that the bellows conjecture holds true for all sufficiently small polyhedra in all non - euclidean spaces .",
    "[ theorem_small ] let @xmath143 be either  @xmath129 or  @xmath323 @xmath16 .",
    "let @xmath324 be a simplicial flexible polyhedron with @xmath99 vertices such that all edges of  @xmath65 have lengths smaller than @xmath325 .",
    "then the generalized oriented volume of  @xmath65 is constant during the flexion .",
    "suppose that @xmath16 . does there exist a constant @xmath326 depending only on the space  @xmath143 such that the generalized oriented volumes of all flexible polyhedra in  @xmath143 of diameters less than  @xmath327 are constant during the flexion ?",
    "notice that the author s classification of flexible cross - polytopes  @xcite implies that in each space  @xmath143 there exist flexible cross - polytopes with arbitrarily small edge lengths , hence , the assertion of theorem  [ theorem_small ] is not empty .    in non - euclidean spaces there is no hope to obtain any reasonable analog of theorem  [ theorem_relation ] providing a way to compute the volume of a simplicial polyhedron from its edge lengths , since even in the simplest case of a tetrahedron in  @xmath162 or  @xmath161 all known formulae for the volume from the edge lengths are very complicated .",
    "the proofs of theorems  [ theorem_bc_lob ] and  [ theorem_small ] are based on the study of the analytic continuation of the volume function  @xmath328 defined on the configuration space  @xmath149 to the complexification of  @xmath98 .",
    "we focus on the proof of theorem  [ theorem_bc_lob ] .",
    "more precisely , we take the canonical stratification of  @xmath98 built by whitney  @xcite for any real affine variety , and then continue  @xmath328 separately to the complexifications  @xmath329 of all strata  @xmath5 .    the differential of the volume of a non - degenerate polyhedron @xmath306 that is deformed preserving its combinatorial type is given by schlfli s formula @xmath330 where the sum is taken over all @xmath81-dimensional simplices @xmath268 of  @xmath7 , @xmath331 is the @xmath81-dimensional volume of the face  @xmath332 , and  @xmath333 is the dihedral angle of  @xmath9 at the face  @xmath332 .",
    "since every  @xmath334 restricted to  @xmath5 is a constant , we can integrate equation   and obtain that the following equality holds on  @xmath5 : @xmath335 it can be checked that the restrictinons to  @xmath5 of the functions  @xmath336 are polynomials , hence , the same polynomials can be considered as functions on  @xmath329",
    ". then the formula @xmath337 yields the analytic continuation of  @xmath328 to a multi - valued analytic function on a zariski open subset of  @xmath329 such that any two branches of this multi - valued function differ by a real constant , and the ( single - valued ) imaginary part of this function has a not more than logarithmic growth .",
    "the hardest part of our proof of theorem  [ theorem_bc_lob ] is the proof of the fact that the real part of the obtained analytic function is also single - valued , which is based on the following theorem .",
    "suppose that @xmath6 is odd .",
    "let @xmath338 be the function expressing the volume of a bounded simplex in  @xmath128 from the gram matrix  @xmath339 of its vertices .",
    "let  @xmath340 be the gram matrix of vertices of a non - degenerate simplex in  @xmath128 , and let  @xmath256 be a closed path in the space of symmetric complex @xmath341 matrices with units on the diagonal such that both endpoints of  @xmath256 coincide with  @xmath340 .",
    "assume that the function @xmath338 admits the analytic continuation along  @xmath256 , and let @xmath342 be the holomorphic function in a neighborhood of  @xmath343 obtained after this analytic continuation .",
    "then @xmath344 .",
    "a non - constant single - valued holomorphic function on a complex affine algebraic variety can not have a not more than logarithmic growth of the imaginary part .",
    "therefore the analytic continuation of  @xmath328 to  @xmath329 is constant , hence , @xmath328 is constant on  @xmath5 .",
    "thus it is constant on every connected component of  @xmath98 .",
