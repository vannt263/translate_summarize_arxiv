    "a most intensively studied question in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is the space - time structure of high energy exclusive reactions . in perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) approaches the hypothesis is made that elastic processes are dominated by the fock space components of the hadronic wave function with the minimum number of quarks ( anti - quarks ) . in the hard scattering picture",
    "these are assumed to be located within a small relative transverse distance @xmath2 , @xmath3 being the ( high ) four - momentum transfer squared in the reaction @xcite .",
    "after the hard scattering takes place , a normal hadron is recovered .",
    "the validation through experiments of this picture  the dominance of the short separation components  is however not straightforward , as witnessed for instance by the recent controversial interpretations of experiments sensitive to helicity selection rules @xcite .",
    "it has been long surmised @xcite that performing ( quasi)-elastic reactions off nuclear targets might ease this impasse .",
    "nuclei can in fact function as both `` passive '' or `` active '' probes for the small partonic separation components .",
    "small distances can be filtered at finite @xmath3 , by impeding the passage of large separations because of the strong interactions occurring in a nucleus with @xmath4 . in this case nuclei play an active role @xcite .",
    "one can also simply study the passage through the nuclear medium of the small separation component selected at asymptotically high @xmath3 , namely the phenomenon of color transparency ( ct ) .",
    "ct is attained in principle when the ratio , @xmath5 , of the nuclear cross section to the one for scattering in free space , reaches the value of @xmath6 at some given high value of @xmath3 . from a practical point of view , current searches for ct might appear to be in a stall as all experiments performed so far seem not to show either any systematics or any marked trend for the onset of this phenomenon @xcite . however , at the same time , none of the experiments does contradict current predictions for ct .",
    "a large body of theoretical work exists , that generated an active field in the last decade ( see @xcite for extensive reviews ) .",
    "new observables have been proposed since the original measurements , such as the attenuation cross section @xcite , the systematics of oscillations in pion production reactions @xcite , or the sensitivity to the correlation length in exclusive vector meson production @xcite .",
    "based on these new hypotheses , more specific searches have been conducted , which in some cases seem to better identify the phenomenon @xcite .",
    "critical observations about the key assumptions underlying the onset of ct have also recently emerged , a most disquieting one being the suggestion that the transverse size of the exclusive process might not even be small due to a `` suppression of the sudakov suppression '' @xcite .",
    "whether or not a pqcd description of the hadrons holds at the @xmath3 values presently available , it has now become imperative to investigate the basic question of the existence and observability of small size hadronic configurations . in this paper",
    "we use as a theoretical tool generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) that , as pointed out recently @xcite , can give us direct access to the transverse spatial extension of the hadronic components .",
    "gpds can , in fact , be shown to be diagonal in the impact parameter representation , and they can therefore be interpreted as ",
    "fourier transformed in the transverse plane  joint probability distributions of finding a parton with longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath1 , and transverse separation from the proton s center , @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the original result , obtained for @xmath8 , @xmath9 being the longitudinal momentum transfer fraction , was shown to hold also in the @xmath10 case in @xcite ( see also @xcite for a laboratory frame based description ) .",
    "the new insight provided by the impact parameter space interpretation allows one to make a connection between gpds and the phenomena of ct and nuclear filtering . within this new framework",
    ", one can in fact address directly the question of what transverse distances dominate the hard exclusive scattering cross section .",
    "so far , a quantitative knowledge of the size of the hadronic configurations involved in a reaction has been in fact very elusive , or at the best , loosely inferred from experiments .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ def_sec ] we define gpds and show their connection , at leading order in @xmath3 , to both the impact parameter dependent parton distributions , and to the intrinsic transverse momentum distributions . in section [ mod_sec ]",
    "we evaluate the role of large transverse momentum components and , conversely , of small interparton separations .",
    "a few quantities are calculated , namely the gpds at @xmath8 , the dirac form factor , and the the deep inelastic structure function .",
    "for each of these quantities the impact of different behaviors in the partons wave functions in both transverse momentum , and transverse distance , is evaluated . in section [ ct_sec ]",
    "we calculate the ratio @xmath11 for electron nucleus scattering experiments in terms of gpds , and we suggest a method for extracting the transverse interparton distance distribution .",
    "finally , we draw our conclusions in section [ con_sec ] .",
    "gpds were initially introduced @xcite in order to better describe in a partonic language the concept of orbital angular momentum carried by the nucleon s constituents .",
    "they can be accessed experimentally in exclusive hard scattering experiments . the most straightforward way has been to date deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) , that has become the prototype for illustrating different aspects of gpds .",
    "there exist a few reviews to date on this subject @xcite . in this section",
    "we summarize the properties of gpds that are relevant for our discussion of exclusive scattering from nuclear targets , as _ e.g. _ probed in the reaction : @xmath12 .",
    "in particular , we define :    * the impact parameter dependent parton distribution function ( ippdf ) and its relation to the observables , @xmath13 , the dirac form factor , @xmath14 , the dis structure function , and @xmath15 , the `` non - spin flip '' gpd . * the rms impact parameter , interparton separation , and radius for the proton , in terms of both ippdfs and gpds . * the intrinsic transverse momentum distribution , and its relation to both the ippdfs , and to @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",
    "the latter issue opens a new perspective on gpds as `` tools '' to study transversity .",
    "we consider the leading order in @xmath3 ( twist-2 ) , where one can define four universal gpds , namely @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the latter two are related to the quarks helicity distributions . in this paper",
    "we focus on the unpolarized case described by @xmath18 .",
    "the relevant kinematical variables are : @xmath19 and @xmath20 , the initial and final nucleon s momenta in the exclusive process , @xmath21 , the average nucleon momentum , @xmath22 the active quark momentum , and @xmath23 the virtual photon momentum ( fig.1 ) . while the ( upper ) hard scattering part of the diagram varies in principle for different reactions , the information necessary to describe gpds is contained in the ( lower ) soft part (",
    "the different types of matrix elements related to gpds are described _",
    "e.g. _ in @xcite ) .",
    "one can define four independent invariants using these variables : , and @xmath24 @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 , where @xmath29 , is the four - momentum transfer in the process .",
    "differently from inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) , the four - momentum transfer , @xmath30 , does not generally coincide with the virtual photon four - momentum , @xmath23 . by properly devising experimental measurements that reproduce this situation , namely @xmath31",
    ", one has therefore the unique possibility of `` zooming '' in on partonic components , due to the high resolution provided by large @xmath3 ( in the multi - gev region ) , at the same time scanning the hadronic target s spatial distribution , through the dependence on the variable @xmath30 .",
    "we denote by @xmath32 and @xmath33 the gpds for a quark of type @xmath34 . @xmath32 and",
    "@xmath33 satisfy the following relations :    @xmath35    independently from @xmath9 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath36 are the dirac and pauli form factors for the quarks of type @xmath34 in the nucleon .",
    "they are readily obtained from the measured proton and neutron form factors by using isospin symmetry @xcite . for @xmath37 , @xmath38 _",
    "i.e. _ one recovers the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) , @xmath39 , in the in the forward limit .",
    "@xmath40 does not have an equivalent connection to parton distributions .",
    "gpds can be related @xcite to the impact parameter space dependent pdfs ( ippdfs ) ( see _ e.g. _ ref.@xcite ) .",
    "an ippdf is defined as the joint distribution : @xmath41  the number of partons of type @xmath23 with momentum fraction @xmath42 , located at a transverse distance @xmath43 ( @xmath43 is the impact parameter ) from the center of @xmath44 of the system .",
    "the latter is defined as @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the space - time variable for the @xmath47 parton , and @xmath48 .",
    "the usage of light cone ( lc ) variables is motivated by the fact that by viewing @xmath49 as the time variable , @xmath50 as the total and partonic masses , respectively , and @xmath51 as the center of mass of the system , @xmath52 is the generator of longitudinal boosts that leave the physics on the @xmath53 surface invariant .",
    "an intuitive connection with non - relativistic logics is naturally provided .",
    "the interpretation of observables , _",
    "e.g. _ structure functions , in terms of parton density distributions relies on the validity of the impulse approximation ( ia ) whereby the hard scattering happens instantaneously in @xmath49 .",
    "we work in this hypothesis by assuming that it is satisfied in the kinematical limit for the coherence length of the virtual photon given by : @xmath54 .",
    "this amounts to considering only large values of @xmath55 . at low @xmath55",
    ", one has to consider both ia - type scattering and of processes including photon splitting into quark - antiquark pairs before the nucleon where it has been recently shown that fsi might hamper the interpretation of the deep inelastic measurements in terms of probability distributions @xcite .",
    "this is part of a wider set of problems that transcend the goals of this paper . in particular",
    ", it will be important to study in the future whether parton interactions ( or off - shellness ) affect the transverse distributions that we address in this paper , as this might complicate the procedure of extracting holographic images of the proton as proposed in @xcite .    by definition @xcite",
    ", the dis structure function , @xmath56 , and the form factor , @xmath57 , can be written in terms of the ippdfs respectively , as :    @xmath58    where @xmath59 is the quark s charge , and we have disregarded the @xmath3 dependence of @xmath14 . notice that @xmath60 is the conjugate variable of @xmath43 .      in @xcite",
    ", the observation was made that for a purely transverse four momentum transfer , namely for @xmath61 and @xmath8 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 can be related as follows :    @xmath64    since @xmath63 satisfies positivity constraints and it can be interpreted as a probability distribution , @xmath62 is also interpreted as a probability distribution , namely the fourier transformed joint probability distribution of finding a parton @xmath34 in the proton with longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath1 , at the transverse position @xmath43 , with respect to the center of momentum of the nucleon . since in what follows we will consider only the case @xmath8 , we define : @xmath65 .",
    "the root - mean - square ( rms ) distance of the configuration with momentum fraction @xmath1 , from the center of the proton is defined as the square root of : @xmath66 @xmath67 being a normalization factor , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath68 . similar relations to the ones in eqs.([bdis1],[bdis2 ] ) , were obtained for @xmath10 in @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach in terms of wigner distributions , formulated in a covariant model that allows one in principle to perform calculations in the laboratory frame was given in @xcite .",
    "the role of the variable @xmath9 in the context of a covariant approach , is an important subject _ per se _ , especially in reference to initial state interactions ( isi ) in nuclei",
    ", since it impacts the particles off - shellness .",
    "we address this subject in detail in @xcite .",
    "one can also define the fourier transform with respect to the variable @xmath69 , the transverse position of parton @xmath34 with respect to the center of momentum of the system of spectator partons @xcite : @xmath70 @xmath71 can be obtained from @xmath15 by rescaling the functions arguments as follows : @xmath72 since @xmath73 measures the interparton separation , it is useful to define also the inverse fourier transform : @xmath74 the variables @xmath75 and @xmath73 are fourier conjugates , as well as @xmath60 and @xmath76 .",
    "@xmath77 is the probability of finding a parton with momentum fraction @xmath1 , at a transverse distance @xmath73 from the center of momentum of the spectator partons .",
    "the rms transverse distance between partonic configurations with momentum fractions @xmath1 is obtained as the square root of : @xmath78 _ i.e. _ from the same observable @xmath15 used to obtain @xmath79 .",
    "@xmath67 is defined analogously to eq.([b ] ) .",
    "the _ radius _ of the system of partons , which is the useful quantity for our ct study , is : @xmath80 this definition coincides with the one given in @xcite for @xmath81 . in fig.[fig2 ] we sketch a cartoon of the different transverse distances discussed so far .",
    "the figure shows three different scenarios for the behavior of such distances with increasing @xmath1 , corresponding to the models discussed in the following sections .",
    "the function @xmath82 defined in the previous subsection , although being related through a fourier transform to the interparton separation , @xmath73 , is conceptually different from the `` intrinsic transverse momentum '' distribution .",
    "although we started from writing the structure function and the form factor in terms of ippdfs ( eqs.([sf ] ) and ( [ ff ] ) , respectively ) , their definition is usually given in terms of a lc wave function , @xmath83 as @xcite :    @xmath84    where : @xmath85 with @xmath86 , is a non - diagonal intrinsic momentum distribution .",
    "the diagonal term can be written as : @xmath87    by comparing eqs.([sf_kperp ] , [ ff_kperp ] ) , with eqs.([sf ] , [ ff ] ) , we find that the relation between the transverse momentum and the transverse separation of quarks inside a hadron is obtained through a non - diagonal distribution in transverse coordinate space , @xmath88 : @xmath89 where we define :    @xmath90    @xmath91 being a wave function in the mixed @xmath1 and @xmath43 representation , related to the lc wave function by a transverse fourier transform .",
    "this result can be also implemented in studies of processes directly sensitive to @xmath92 .",
    "it is useful for this purpose to consider the average transverse momentum squared , defined as : @xmath93 with @xmath94 . in section [ mod_sec ]",
    "we present an initial exploratory study of the relative roles of the intrinsic transverse momentum and the transverse separation using different types of wave functions .",
    "finally , it should be mentioned that eq.([sf_kperp ] ) corresponds to a projection obtained from the partons covariant spectral function , @xmath95 @xcite : @xmath96 where the integration over @xmath97 in the last line is replaced by an integration over the invariant mass of the spectator system , @xmath98 ( @xmath97 and @xmath99 are related by ) .",
    "the main reason for introducing the spectral function along with the intrinsic momentum distributions is that it encodes information about the energy and momentum of the spectator system .",
    "the spectral function can be defined in fact as the joint probability distribution of finding a parton with lc components @xmath100 and @xmath92 , leaving the spectator system with a mass @xmath101 . the usage of the spectral function is most important in problems where the particles off - shellness / transversity plays a role , a typical example being deep inelastic scattering from nuclei @xcite . in the following sections we show a model of gpds that implements a function @xmath95 within relativistic ia .",
    "we evaluate the functions defined in the previous section at leading order in @xmath3 , using a two component , or spectator , model ( fig.1b ) .",
    "the main assumptions of the model are : _",
    "i ) _ the validity of the hand - bag diagram ; _ ii ) _ a description of dynamics in terms of a nucleon - quark - spectator system vertex .",
    "the minimal fock component is described by a quark - diquark vertex function .",
    "we describe the active quark as off - shell and the diquark as on - shell , with mass @xmath102 .",
    "the spectator model is both widely used and well tested in hadronic physics .",
    "in particular , in @xcite it was used to describe dis in nuclei ; in @xcite parametrizations for both the polarized and unpolarized proton and neutron structure functions were given ; more recently it was applied to dvcs @xcite .",
    "our usage of the model other than for practical reasons , is motivated by the clear handling of the interplay between the particles off - shellness and their energy and transverse momentum .",
    "this turns out to be an important property when describing the deep inelastic structure of nuclei @xcite . by considering the components in fig.1b",
    ", one has    @xmath103   - { \\bf k}^2   \\\\ \\label{vir } k^{\\prime 2 } & = &   k^{\\prime + } k^{\\prime - } - ( { \\bf k}+ { \\bf \\delta})^2 =   \\nonumber \\\\    & = & ( xp^+ ) \\ ,   \\left[\\frac{m^2+{\\bf \\delta}^2}{p^+ } - \\frac{m^2_x + { \\bf k}^2}{(1-x)p^+ }   \\right ]   - ( { \\bf k}+ { \\bf \\delta})^2   \\label{vir_prime}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath104 ; @xmath105 and @xmath106 are the proton and the diquark masses , respectively .",
    "hence , for the denominators in fig.1b : @xmath107 where we defined @xmath108 , @xmath109 being the struck quark mass .",
    "we consider the remnant diquark system to be a scalar .",
    "the form of the vertex function depends on the assumptions made in treating the quark s spin . since we are ultimately interested in determining the radius of the proton as extracted by using the spin averaged quantity @xmath15 , we assume that the vertex function is a scalar in dirac space described by a function @xmath110 .",
    "the two - component wave function becomes : @xmath111 notice that , because of the relation between the struck parton s virtuality and transverse momentum ( eq.([vir ] ) ) , one can write @xmath112 as a function of the invariants : @xmath113 , @xmath1 , @xmath114 .",
    "one can therefore identify the relativistic spectral function in eq.([spefunc ] ) with : @xmath115      the gpd , the structure function , and the form factor can be evaluated in terms of the function @xmath112 in eq.([wfunction_k ] ) , according to the definitions in section [ intkperp_sec ] .",
    "one has :    @xmath116    notice that we incorporated in the function @xmath112 , a factor @xmath117 , that accounts for both the initial flux , and the phase space for the process in fig.1 .",
    "moreover , we drop the index @xmath34 in @xmath15 , since we fit our functions directly to the proton valence structure function and form factor , without distinguishing between @xmath118 and @xmath119 quarks contributions . for the vertex function we used the form : @xmath120 where @xmath121 is fixed by the normalization , and @xmath122 is a cut - off parameter .",
    "the values of @xmath122 , @xmath109 , and @xmath106 are determined by fitting both the large four - momentum behavior of the form factor , and the shape of the dis structure function at large @xmath3 .",
    "the latter is determined in our model calculation at very low @xmath3 ( @xmath123 gev@xmath124 ) , where the structure function is given only by its valence component , the sea quarks and gluons being generated through perturbative evolution ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "the values of the parameters are : @xmath125 gev , @xmath126 gev , @xmath127 gev .",
    "in figures 3 , 4 , 5 , and 6 we present our results obtained using eqs.([wfunction_k],[gpd3],[sf3],[ff3],[mon ] ) .",
    "fig.3 shows the quantity : @xmath128 , where @xmath129 also shown for comparison are results obtained using the parametrizations from refs.@xcite .",
    "the wavefunction in eq.([wfunction_k ] ) , has a similar behavior to the parametrization used in @xcite , in that it displays high momentum components with a @xmath130 behavior , although in a slightly larger amount . in order to quantify the `` hardness '' of the distributions , in table [ table_k2 ]",
    "we show the average transverse momentum values obtained in each model . in the table",
    "we also display the contributions to @xmath131 , from the large momentum components calculated by setting the lower limit of integration in @xmath132 equal to @xmath6 gev and to @xmath133 gev , respectively .",
    "these values reflect the behavior of the curves in fig.[fig3 ] , in that the distribution in ref.@xcite is truly of the `` soft '' type ; the ones in ref.@xcite and in this paper are characterized by a long high momentum `` tail '' ; finally , we show results obtained with parametrizations of the type proposed in ref.@xcite , where by accounting for gluonic interactions through the introduction of an effective gluonic mass in the initial two component model of @xcite , a further suppression in the large @xmath1 behavior is found , of the type @xmath134 $ ] , with @xmath135 . we find that for @xmath136 the distributions obtained following the idea of ref.@xcite , are neither entirely `` soft '' nor `` hard '' , but they display larger `` intermediate '' momentum values , hence they give rise to a large @xmath137 .",

    "an intermediate ( @xmath143 ) and a large ( @xmath144 ) value of @xmath1 are indicated in the figure , from which one can also deduce that the value of @xmath145 traces the expected behavior for the valence structure function ( namely the curve at @xmath142 has a much lower value for @xmath146 than the curve at @xmath143 ) .",
    "values of @xmath147 decrease one more order of magnitude and they are not shown in the figure .    in fig.5",
    "we show the form factor @xmath148 .",
    "this is compared to calculations using the models of ref.@xcite , ref.@xcite , and to the dipole model : @xmath149 , with @xmath150 .",
    "we find , in agreement also with ref.@xcite , that the large momentum components of the wave function are responsible for the large @xmath151 behavior of the form factor .",
    "such components are effectively comparable to the hard contribution from pqcd calculations @xcite .",
    "although they constitute a small fraction of the average transverse momentum as shown in table i , the contribution of large @xmath92 is much larger in the nucleon form factor .",
    "this is shown in fig.6 , where we plotted the ratio : @xmath152 .",
    "only @xmath153 of the form factor is reproduced by stopping the integration at @xmath154 gev , by using a wave function with hard components , whereas the ratio shown in the figure is already saturated in models based on a gaussian behavior .",
    "similar conclusions can be drawn by investigating the large @xmath1 behavior of the deep inelastic structure function , eq.([sf3 ] ) .",
    "next , we study how the behavior of the wave function with transverse momentum , @xmath92 , reflects on the transverse space distribution , @xmath155 .",
    "this is obtained as a fourier transform of the function @xmath141 in the transverse plane : this is a hankel transform ] @xmath156 where @xmath157 and @xmath158 , and @xmath159 is a zero - th order bessel function of the first kind . in order to evaluate @xmath160 with adequate accuracy ,",
    "we parametrized @xmath161 as : @xmath162 the coefficients @xmath163 , @xmath164 are given in the appendix .",
    "the hankel transform of @xmath15 has the following analytic form : @xmath165 where @xmath166 is a modified bessel function of the second kind , and we set @xmath167 ( a more complicated , though similar , analytical form is obtained for @xmath168 , which we do not display for ease of presentation ) .",
    "@xmath160 is shown in fig.7 , plotted as a function of @xmath7 for varying @xmath1 . using eq.([num_qxb ] ) one can calculate the radius , the interquark separation , and the rms distance from the center of the hadron , eqs.([b],[y],[r ] ) .",
    "these quantities are shown in fig.8 . in fig.8(a ) results for @xmath169 from several models for the gpds are compared .",
    "the difference in slope as @xmath0 is clearly visible . in fig.8(b ) we show our results for @xmath169 , @xmath170 , @xmath171 .",
    "one can see that the both rms radius , and the interparton separation do not vanish in the @xmath81 limit ; rather , they tend to a finite ( small ) value of @xmath172 gev@xmath173 ( @xmath174 fm ) .",
    "in fig.9 we plot the average transverse momentum squared of a quark in the proton , eq.([k ] ) .",
    "there is a marked difference in the behavior of this quantity for the `` soft '' and `` hard '' type wave functions .",
    "the wave function proposed in @xcite gives manifestly divergent results for large @xmath1 , although , as one can see from table i , the integrated value of @xmath131 is finite",
    ". our results are consistent with previous findings using the diquark / spectator model @xcite .    what components of the wave function are responsible for this behavior ?",
    "in fig.10 we give a partial answer to this question by plotting the contribution to both @xmath7 ( upper panel ) and @xmath175 ( lower panel ) of the short distance components .",
    "this is obtained by stopping the integration over @xmath7 in the definition of the rms quantities at decreasing values of the upper limit : @xmath133 , @xmath6 , and @xmath176 gev@xmath173 , respectively .",
    "it is clear that the short distance part of the wave function ( or the large @xmath22 components ) largely determine the size of the radius at large @xmath1 .",
    "this is particularly evident from the lower panel of fig.10 , where results are presented using the ratio : @xmath177 . while models including a hard component saturate this ratio for @xmath178 gev@xmath173 already at @xmath179 , models using a `` soft '' wave function of the type of ref.@xcite do not show a tendency to saturation until very large @xmath1 .",
    "these results open up a somewhat puzzling situation : in order to describe the form factor at large @xmath3 , one needs high @xmath22 components in the wave function .",
    "this is both a prediction of pqcd based calculations @xcite , and it can be also shown phenomenologically ( fig.5 ) ( see also ref.@xcite ) .",
    "high @xmath22 components are also responsible for a decrease in the hadronic transverse size as @xmath1 increases ( figs.8 , 9 and 10 ) .",
    "however , one can envisage a model such as the one utilized in this paper that has the amount of high momentum components necessary to reproduce the dirac form factor , and that at the same time , predicts a small but not vanishing transverse size for hadronic configurations at large @xmath1 . in concluding this section",
    ", we reiterate that the usage of gpds for determining the spatial structure of hadrons through @xmath160 , has been so far largely theoretical , since these quantities are only indirectly deduced from a variety of delicate measurements ( @xcite ) . in the following",
    "we suggest that an additional source of information could be given by studies of color transparency and related phenomena such as nuclear filtering .",
    "these are in fact directly sensitive to the size of hadronic components .",
    "in the previous sections we discussed the relative importance of the soft and hard components of the light cone wave functions up to four momentum transfer @xmath180 gev@xmath124 .",
    "plausible scenarios confirm the idea that @xmath181 of the form factor is given by the hard component of the wave function at four momentum transfer @xmath180 gev@xmath124 ( for consistency with the general notation we switch from @xmath151 to @xmath3 in this section ) .",
    "this result is indeed correlated with the dominance of small transverse sizes of hadronic configurations through a fourier transform , however not straightforwardly as demonstrated by the different behaviors of the gpds with @xmath1 and @xmath30 . as shown in fig.11 where the average value of @xmath1 , given by : @xmath182 is plotted vs. @xmath183 , the model in ref.@xcite is governed at large @xmath3 by small @xmath7 _ as well as _ by large @xmath1 components ( although its prediction for the form factor is substantially lower than the data , as shown in fig.[fig5 ] , and the radius predicted for hadronic configurations diverges at large @xmath1 ) .",
    "the approach based on the diquark model yields a form factor that is dominated by small @xmath7 components but not exclusively by @xmath0 configurations .",
    "this behavior which is further clarified by the comparison of @xmath161 for the two cases in fig.12 , is at the origin of the rather flat dependence with @xmath1 of the transverse radius shown in fig.8 .",
    "also , it appears that the model of ref.@xcite , approximately including the effect of a gluonic interaction , fixes the problem of an unphysically large radius while keeping a large @xmath1 behavior as the one in ref.@xcite , at the expense of introducing a large @xmath22 in the wavefunction ( fig.[fig9 ] ) .    in summary , while it can be challenging to unambiguously disentangle the amount and nature of hard components responsible for the large @xmath3 behavior of the hadronic form factors , one might gain a better insight by requiring models to simultaneously describe the hadrons transverse spatial distribution , and in particular the possible onset of small transverse configurations . the diquark model presented in this paper seems to provide a better description than other models similarly based on the handbag diagram .",
    "if configurations with small radii indeed exist , they can be isolated in principle by performing ct and/or nuclear filtering type experiments .",
    "ct has been so far investigated in a variety of reactions including proton - hadron , @xmath184-hadron , and electron - proton scattering @xcite . here we consider exclusive electron - proton scattering , where oscillations due to the interference of perturbative and non - perturbative contributions possibly present in the proton - proton and @xmath184-proton exclusive cross sections , do not occur .",
    "our result is however quite general and can be easily extended to other type of reactions .    using the new perspective of gpds in impact parameter space",
    ", we can now take a radical turn and devise a `` minimal '' approach that reduces the ( nuclear ) model dependence of the problem ( an approach complementary to ours was recently suggested in @xcite , where the connection between ct and gpds was explored in relation to diffractive dissociation of pions ) .",
    "as widely underlined in the literature , the prerequisites for the onset of ct , assuming that the scattering takes place off a small size configuration , are that : _ i ) _ the interaction of the hadron in the nuclear medium is reduced due to the decreased gluon radiation from a small transverse size color dipole @xcite ; _ ii ) _ the small size configuration , not being stationary , will in principle evolve with time into a larger configuration .",
    "it however remains sufficiently small during the time it crosses the nucleus .",
    "ii ) _ has probably been the most controversial one , although recent criticism to _",
    "i ) _ has also emerged @xcite .",
    "another point , not extensively addressed in the literature ( see however @xcite ) , is that the hadron suffers initial state interactions ( isi ) , or that in other words , the form factor for an off - shell nucleon is in principle different from the on - shell one .",
    "we can now break down the problem in several steps : we first assume that the scattering happens with an `` unmodified '' proton in the nuclear medium .",
    "we introduce a nuclear filter for the large transverse size components , by multiplying the ippdf , @xmath160 , by a square function : @xmath185 where @xmath186 defines the size of the filter .",
    "this affects the gpd as : @xmath187 with @xmath188 .",
    "the transparency ratio for @xmath189 type reactions becomes @xmath190 ^2}{\\left [ \\int_0 ^ 1 dx h(x,\\delta ) \\right]^2},\\ ] ] where @xmath15 defined as in eq.([bdis2 ] ) represents scattering in free space , _ i.e. _ it is calculated with @xmath191 .",
    "based on this result , one can fit the available data , using different distributions @xmath160 , and varying the parameter @xmath192 . in fig.[fig13 ] we show a few possible scenarios based on a simplified analytical model for @xmath160 .",
    "we take @xmath193 , where @xmath194 is taken with two different dependencies : * ( a ) * @xmath195 , as in ref.@xcite ; * ( b ) * @xmath196 , as in ref.@xcite .",
    "the effect of the filter is to produce both damping and oscillations in @xmath197 . in fig.[fig13 ] we show for illustration , the ratio @xmath198 plotted vs. @xmath30 for two different values of @xmath1 , in case * ( a ) * and * ( b ) * , and for different values of the filter size .",
    "our analytical calculation displays explicitly the damping and oscillations as : @xmath199 although this result does not correspond to a completely realistic situation , it allows us to understand for varying @xmath1 , the different effects due to variations in the size of @xmath200 , which in turn is a feature of gpds from different models .",
    "oscillations are clearly more pronounced at low @xmath1 .",
    "when @xmath192 is large , of the order of @xmath201 gev@xmath173 ( @xmath202 fm ) , transparency is attained .",
    "when @xmath192 is small ( @xmath6 gev@xmath173 , @xmath203 fm ) , the medium is no longer transparent to the type of distributions considered , although distribution * ( a ) * giving a larger radius , is more suppressed than * ( b ) * at low @xmath30 .",
    "the results of the first step of the analysis would give joint information on possible sizes of the filter , defined as @xmath204 , and on the behavior of the ippdfs , _",
    "i.e. _ on the radius of hadronic configurations , @xmath205 .",
    "this procedure , systematically applied to a sufficiently large body of data including both existing and planned measurements @xcite , gives a much more direct test of the transverse sizes involved .",
    "once this basic information is known from measurements  and not inferred from theoretical scenarios  one would be able to introduce more sophisticated modeling of _",
    "e.g. _ rescattering and isi .",
    "a somewhat similar point of view was taken in a pre - gpd context in ref.@xcite and applied to the data in @xcite , where fits were performed based on a parameter , @xmath206 , with @xmath207 the nuclear density , @xmath208 the nuclear radius , and @xmath209 the effective hadron - hadron interaction cross section .",
    "we presented a study using the new theoretical insight provided by gpds , of the interplay between the transverse variables in both momentum and coordinate space , @xmath92 and @xmath43 respectively , and of the longitudinal momentum fraction , @xmath1 , in the proton form factor , @xmath13 .",
    "our study was aimed at establishing what type of components ",
    "hard vs. soft , small transverse distance vs. large  dominate the form factor based on different hypotheses for the gpds used to describe @xmath13 .",
    "we confirm the result initially obtained in ref.@xcite ( fig.[fig5 ] ) that @xmath13 at @xmath213 gev can be reproduced only by allowing for a sufficiently large amount of large @xmath92 ( hard ) components .",
    "cases _ ii ) _ , and _",
    "iii ) _ satisfy this condition .",
    "furthermore , we find that , for values of @xmath214 gev@xmath124 , the behavior predicted for the form factor ( figs.[fig6 ] , [ fig9 ] , [ fig11 ] ) is governed by :          the rms value of the proton radius , given by @xmath220 in eq.([r ] ) , was calculated by a two - dimensional fourier transform of the gpd , _",
    "i.e. _ using the function @xmath155 ( fig.[fig7 ] ) .",
    "we pointed out that @xmath221 for @xmath0 , where @xmath73 is the variable defining the radius in ref.@xcite , and @xmath222 for @xmath223 .",
    "we unraveled the following behavior ( fig.[fig8 ] ) :          from the behavior of the rms radius with @xmath1 , one can surmise what components in @xmath7 space the form factor is dominated by . while @xmath230 at @xmath231 is entirely given by @xmath232 gev@xmath173 ( @xmath176 fm ) for models characterized by a hard component ( _ ii ) _ and _ iii ) _ ) , in case _",
    "i ) _ saturation is not reached ( fig.10 ) , that is the rms radius is large even at large @xmath1 . on the other side , by studying the average value of @xmath1 , @xmath233 , calculated using the distribution @xmath15 vs. @xmath30 ( figs.[fig11 ] and [ fig12 ] ) , one finds that the hard type functions are not dominated by large @xmath1 at large @xmath30 , rather all @xmath1 components seem to contribute ( fig.[fig12 ] ) .    in summary , although it is becoming clear that the physics governing the hadronic form factors , and more generally exclusive processes at large momentum transfer , is given by a non - trivial blend of soft and hard components , current descriptions using gpds are not completely satisfactory .",
    "the next question is how one would be able to test the transverse spatial structure of hadrons , given the fact that gpds are quite elusive objects from the experimental point of view .",
    "a potentially powerful means to single out the size of hadronic configurations could be given by combining ct / nuclear filtering studies with gpds as suggested in this paper .",
    "based on the so far little explored concepts of ippdfs and gpds , we can now test the effect of nuclear filtering in an exclusive reaction by building a `` filter '' in the definition of the transparency , @xmath234 .",
    "this procedure eliminates some of the model dependence implicit in many predictions in a somewhat similar way to what proposed _",
    "e.g. _ in ref.@xcite .",
    "it however also provides a way of explicitly extracting the transverse radial dependence of the hadron - hadron cross section in the nuclear medium .",
    "while an analysis extended to all available data will be carried out in a upcoming paper @xcite , we have presented here a few hypothetical scenarios obtained with our procedure .",
    "in addition to the main results of this paper , interesting new developments will concern the extension of our calculations to the neutron and the polarized case , as well as the exploration of the skewedness , @xmath9 , dependence .",
    "most importantly , the use of nuclei and ct experiments might unravel an alternative method to measure gpds by evaluating nuclear dependent contributions beyond the standard assumption of factorization into a nucleon times a nuclear part for the nuclear scattering amplitude .",
    "such terms can be shown to be directly proportional to gpds and a study examining their relative importance as @xmath235-dependent contributions is on its way @xcite . both the studies initiated in this paper and the suggested future studies could be tested ideally both at jefferson lab @xcite including its 12 gev upgrade , and at newly planned electron ion colliders with high luminosity and energy @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , studies like the one presented here using the new concept of gpds , will both improve our knowledge of nuclear filtering phenomena and allow for a more detailed understanding of the transverse components involved at large momentum transfer .",
    "in particular , we hope to have provided a connection between @xmath236 and @xmath237 space that will help to systematically address both the role of sudakov effects in the endpoints of the hadronic wave function @xcite , and the role of power corrections in the large longitudinal momentum regions hinted in @xcite .",
