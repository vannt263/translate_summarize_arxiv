    "since last 25 years , there has been an explosion of interest in the magnetic behavior of pyrochlore oxides .",
    "they exhibit metallic , insulating or semi - conducting behavior often coupled with magnetic phase transitions .",
    "pyrochlores are a good system for studying the effects of spin - orbital interplay .",
    "a main goal is to understand how various phase transition such as magnetic ordering and metal insulator transitions emerges from this interplay .",
    "most importantly , pyrochlores provide an opportunity to study the role of geometrical frustration in phase transitions.@xcite .",
    "the metal - insulator transition ( mit ) in mo pyrochlore oxides @xmath0 ( where r is rare earth metal ) and role of its frustrated lattice structure has been extensively studied@xcite .",
    "the evolution of charge dynamics at metal - insulator transition has been spectroscopically investigated for @xmath1 where the spin - orbit interaction as well as the electron correlation is effectively tuned by the doping level ( x)@xcite . the transition from ferromagnetic metal to spin glass insulator and paramagnetic metal has been observed with increase of the radius of rare earth metal ion @xmath2 and external pressure due to the competing double exchange and super exchange interactions on the frustrated lattice@xcite .    compounds with b = mn , mo , ir and os are interesting as they undergo metal - insulator transition ( mit ) by changing temperature , pressure and r - site cations .",
    "for example , coulomb interactions has been found important for mit and giant magnetoresistance for systems with 3d electrons like b = mn@xcite . on the other hand , for 5d systems with b = ir and os",
    ", recent first - principles studies revealed that spin - orbit interaction plays a major role in their electronic and magnetic properties@xcite . in these systems the natural tendency to form long - range ordered ground states is frustrated , resulting in some novel short - range ordered phases like spin glasses@xcite , spin ices , and spin liquids .",
    "the role of orbital degrees of freedom has been proposed in metal insulator transitions in various pyrochlore oxides@xcite . in this work ,",
    "we focus on phase transition in orbital degrees of freedom in pyrochlore .",
    "the lattice structure of @xmath3 is composed of two intervening pyrochlore lattices formed by mo cations and r cations . in this work ,",
    "we neglect the coupling between mo 4d electrons and r site rare earth metal moments and focus on mo pyrochlore network alone.@xcite . in mo pyrochlore lattice ,",
    "the mo cation is surrounded by octahedra of oxygens @xmath4 .",
    "the octahedral crystal fields of oxygen splits five fold degenerate d orbitals of mo cation into lower three fold degenerate @xmath5 and higher two fold degenerate @xmath6 levels .",
    "further , the @xmath7 octahedron is distorted along the direction toward the center of each mo tetrahedron , also known as the local ( 111 ) axis or trigonal axis .",
    "the distortion in the @xmath7 octahedron along trigonal axis splits three fold @xmath5 level into lower singlet @xmath8 level ( below the fermi level ) and higher two fold degenerate @xmath9 levels ( above fermi level)@xcite .",
    "mo electronic configuration is kr @xmath10 .",
    "as there are only two electrons in outermost d shell of @xmath11 cation , the singlet @xmath8 up spin band ( formation of up spin channel and down spin channel happens because of strong hund s coupling . )",
    "is fully occupied and the two fold degenerate upper @xmath9 up spin band is half occupied . since these @xmath9 electrons reside in a half filled band above fermi level , they hop from site to site with two fold degeneracy at each site and contribute in conductance . on the other hand , @xmath8 electrons are sitting in a fully occupied band below the fermi level .",
    "they act like spin half localized spins interacting with each other via anti - ferromagnetic super exchange mechanism and play a role in shaping the overall phase competition .",
    "on pyrochlore lattice , these @xmath8 and @xmath12 electrons compete to produce a resultant order .",
    "in addition , the itinerant electrons and localized spin half electrons interact via ferromagnetic hund s rule coupling or double exchange mechanism .",
    "the model we study in this paper takes all these into account including on - site coulomb interaction between degenerate @xmath9 electrons .",
    "we start with the two band orbital double exchange ( de ) model hamiltonian previously proposed for various pyrochlore systems@xcite that includes kinetic energy , coulomb interaction , hund s coupling and anti - ferromagnetic super - exchange , @xmath13 the first term denotes kinetic energy of itinerant @xmath9 electrons with spin @xmath14 and with orbital index @xmath15 running over degenerate orbitals @xmath16 and @xmath17 of the @xmath12 band .",
    "second term , @xmath18 , denotes the hund s coupling between itinerant @xmath9 electrons with localized spin half @xmath8 electron .",
    "third term , @xmath19 , denotes the anti ferromagnetic super - exchange ( se ) among localized @xmath8 electrons .",
    "@xmath20 is approximately set by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the transfer integral between the @xmath8 orbitals and @xmath23 the intra - orbital coulomb repulsion in the @xmath8 orbital .",
    "the last term denotes on - site coulomb interactions between @xmath9 including intra and inter - orbital repulsions .",
    "the pressure - induced lattice contraction leads to the increase of the electron transfer interactions .",
    "in contrast to the `` chemical pressure '' with the r - ion size variation in which the @xmath24 transfer ( t ) is most effectively modified , the isotropic lattice contraction by the `` physical '' pressure act on the @xmath8 electrons , enhancing the antiferromagnetic se interaction @xmath25 between the localized @xmath8 electron spin@xcite .",
    "we study two band de model ( [ demodel ] ) on the two dimensional checkerboard lattice in the limit @xmath26 .",
    "we take this lattice because checkerboard lattice has frustrated lattice structure like pyrochlore lattice but has simpler two band hamiltonian . the checkerboard lattice is shown in fig.[check - latt ] .        for large @xmath27 , we can simplify the model .",
    "we first rotate the axis of quantization of every fermionic operator @xmath28 from universal z - axis to the direction of the core spin @xmath29 at every site by transformation , @xmath30=u(\\theta_i , \\phi_i)\\left[\\begin{array}{c}p_i\\\\a_i\\end{array}\\right ] \\mbox{,\\quad where~~}\\\\ u(\\theta_i,\\phi_i)=exp\\big(-i\\frac{\\phi_i}{2}\\sigma^z\\big)exp\\big(-i\\frac{\\theta_i}{2}\\sigma^y\\big).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this renders the hund s term diagonal in spin , and in @xmath31 limit , the anti - parallel state gets projected out from the hamiltonian , the on site energy gets shifted by @xmath27 and we get the spins of itinerant electrons aligned parallel to the localized spin at each site @xcite .",
    "@xmath32 where @xmath33 is spinless fermion operator and @xmath34 . in above eq.([mainmodel ] ) , @xmath35 is considered as an inter - orbital interaction and the electronic hopping element @xmath36 is given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 denotes the angle of spin @xmath39 , making the hopping element site and spin dependent .",
    "because of anisotropy of the @xmath12 orbitals and relative angle of mo - o - mo bond @xcite , the relative strength of @xmath40 and @xmath41 can be expressed as @xmath42 in mo pyrochlore oxides @xmath43 , which means that inter orbital hopping @xmath44 is significantly larger than the intra orbital hopping @xmath45 @xcite . for simplicity",
    ", we neglect the intra orbital hopping @xmath46 , and set @xmath47 and get , @xmath48 where we replaced orbital degeneracy @xmath49 by spin degeneracy @xmath50 and mapped the problem from orbital space to spin space .",
    "using eq.([furukawa ] ) , we can find the ground state of the model simply because spin variables @xmath51 in hopping amplitude @xmath52 are decoupled and the energy of electrons in the model can be minimized by simply maximizing @xmath52 .",
    "for @xmath52 to be maximum , nearest neighboring spins have to be parallel to each other . in parallel spin configuration ,",
    "the hopping amplitude @xmath52 becomes site and spin independent .",
    "we now study the nature of ground state phases of the model eqn.([furukawa ] ) in extreme limits @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
