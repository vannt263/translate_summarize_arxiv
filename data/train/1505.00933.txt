    "the general behavior is similar to both the hydrodynamic and axial magnetic - field cases .",
    "namely , the over - pressured toroidally magnetized jet produces an initially weak conical shock that propagates into the ambient medium and , at the same time , a conical rarefaction wave that propagates into the jet .",
    "the latter expands radially , but the rarefaction waves produced are also responsible for the conversion of the thermal energy of the plasma into kinetic energy of the jet following the basic mechanism of the ar booster . at @xmath73 , this process leads to an increase in the lorentz factor of flow that is accelerated from @xmath88 to @xmath89 ( see the solid lines in fig .

    "again , the different lines refer respectively to @xmath85 , and to @xmath102 , @xmath79 , @xmath106 , and @xmath95 ( dotted , dashed , dash - dotted and dash - double - dotted lines , respectively ) .",
    "also in this case , it is possible to observe how the phenomenology of the helical field is a combination of the one seen for purely axial and purely toroidal magnetic fields . in particular , as in the toroidal - field case , the gas pressure shows only modest changes along the @xmath5 direction when the magnetic field is increased . on the other hand , as in the axial - field case , the lorentz factor shows peaks that increase and move downstream with increasing magnetic - field strengths .",
    "in the previous sections we have illustrated in detail how a robust feature of the recollimation shocks considered here is the acceleration of the flow downstream of the inlet as a result of the ar booster . we have also remarked that the occurrence of this acceleration is the result of the conversion of the plasma thermal energy into kinetic energy of the jet , or , more precisely , of the conservation of the quantity @xmath1 across a rarefaction wave @xcite .",
    "in addition , we have discussed how different magnetic field topologies lead to systematically different values of the maximum increase in the lorentz factor measured downstream of the inlet , _",
    "i.e. , _  @xmath107 .",
    "what we have not yet discussed , however is how this accelerating mechanism depends on our choice of the initial magnetic - field strength , @xmath40 .",
    "4.0 cm    this point is addressed in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ dep1 ] , which reports the relative increase of the lorentz factor with respect to the purely hydrodynamical evolution , namely , @xmath108 , as a function of the initial magnetic field .",
    "obviously , this quantity can either be positive or negative and provides a direct measure of the fractional boost .",
    "shown with different symbols are the different magnetic - field topologies , with crosses referring to the axial magnetic field ( case ` mhd - a ` ) , diamonds to the helical magnetic - field ( case ` mhd - c ` ) , and star crosses to the toroidal magnetic - field ( case ` mhd - b ` ) .    when presented in this manner , it is then straightforward to realize that axial and helical initial magnetic fields lead to lorentz boosts that are larger than in the hydrodynamical case , while the opposite is true for purely toroidal magnetic fields , for which an acceleration is still present but this is smaller than in the hydrodynamical case .",
    "we have already discussed in the previous sections that the origin of this different behaviour has to be found in the fact that an axial magnetic field adds an effective gas pressure and results in larger rest - mass density and pressure gradients across the rarefaction waves induced downstream of the inlet . in turn",
    ", the ar booster translates these stronger waves into larger accelerations of the flow .",
    "it is also instructive that , in the case of a purely axial magnetic field , the behaviour of the relative boost has a simple quadratic dependence on the initial magnetic field .",
    "this is simply because the relative boost scales as @xmath109 this is confirmed by the very good match between the numerical data and a quadratic fit , which is indicated with a red dashed line .",
    "also shown in fig .",
    "[ dep1 ] , but in the middle panel , are the fractional differences in the specific enthalpy at the position of the maximum lorentz factor , _",
    "i.e. , _  @xmath110 . here too , different symbols refer to the various magnetic - field topologies ( _ cf . ,",
    "_  left panel ) and different initial strengths .",
    "clearly , this panel offers a complementary view to the one in the left panel and summarizes much of what already discussed in the previous sections .",
    "namely , that axial and helical magnetic fields leads to smaller values of the specific enthalpy in the downstream solution , in contrast to the case of toroidal magnetic fields where instead the values of the specific enthalpy at lorentz - factor maximum increases with the initial magnetic field . finally , shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ dep1 ] is the behaviour of the minimum plasma beta @xmath47 as a function of the initial magnetic field .",
    "interestingly , all magnetic - field topologies show the same ( and expected ) quadratic dependence as @xmath111 .      as discussed in section [ sec : ns ] , in the case of a helical magnetic field , we have an additional degree of freedom represented by the initial magnetic pitch as defined in eq . .",
    "by suitably choosing the initial pitch , _",
    "i.e. , _  the ratio @xmath112 , it is possible to scan the range of possible magnetic - field configurations , which range from an essentially toroidal magnetic field because there is always a nonzero poloidal component at the jet center @xmath55 . ] for @xmath113 to an axial axial magnetic field for @xmath114",
    ".    given this freedom in the parameterization , and given that different magnetic - field topologies lead to different amplifications to the ar booster , it is interesting to ask whether a correlation exists between the initial pitch and the increase in the maximum lorentz factor downstream of the inlet .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ dep2 ] , which shows @xmath115 as a function of the initial pitch @xmath41 for a number of simulations carried out with @xmath72 .",
    "interestingly , we found that the relative increase in the maximum lorentz factor has a very clear dependence with the pitch , smoothly joining the two extreme cases of a toroidal and axial magnetic fields , respectively .",
    "furthermore , the transition between the two regimes takes place at @xmath116 , that is , when @xmath117 , saturating to the axial field case when @xmath118 .",
    "finally , the dependence can be accurately approximated with a simple expression of the type @xmath119\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath120 , and @xmath121 , and is indicated with the red dashed line in fig .",
    "[ dep2 ] .",
    "the relevance of expression is that it provides , at least in principle , yet another useful tool to deduce the properties of the magnetic - field topology from the observations of the jet dynamics . indeed , if radio - astronomical observations could provide a reliable measure of the lorentz factor in the bulk of the jet and at its base , _",
    "@xmath122 and @xmath123 , then expression would provide a simple way to deduce the degree of helicity of the magnetic field in the jet .",
    "this is because while the relation between @xmath122 and the pitch @xmath41 changes with the initial lorentz factor in the jet @xmath123 , the fact that @xmath122 and @xmath123 scale linearly [ _ cf . , _",
    "left panel of fig .",
    "[ hydro_dep ] ] implies that the functional dependence of @xmath124 with @xmath41 will not change .",
    "this is shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "hence , once and if @xmath125 is measured , a direct estimate on @xmath41 is possible , which is only weakly dependent on the jet overpressure .",
    "conversely , if the magnetic field pitch angle could be determined , _",
    "e.g. , _  from polarimetric observations , then it could be possible to estimate @xmath122 .",
    "such a measurement would obviously be of great importance for the interpretation of the very rapid tev variability in agn jets .",
    "we have performed 2d srmhd simulations of the propagation of an over - pressured relativistic jet leading to the generation of a series of recollimation shocks and rarefaction waves .",
    "the overall dynamics of this process is rather well known .",
    "downstream of the inlet , the jet produces a weak conical shock that propagates into the ambient medium and a quasi - stationary conical rarefaction wave that propagates inwards .",
    "the significant drops in rest - mass density and pressure produced by the rarefaction waves are also responsible for the conversion of the thermal energy into kinetic energy of the jet ( see , _",
    "e.g. , _   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is a purely relativistic effect that develops in the presence of strong tangential discontinuities in the flow @xcite , and that leads to a consistent and robust boost of the fluid .",
    "in addition , the nonlinear interaction of the shocks and rarefaction waves lead to a stationary and multiple recollimation - shock structure along the jet , which has been reproduced by a number of the hydrodynamic simulations under different physical conditions ( see , _ e.g. , _   * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we have here extended previous hydrodynamic work to determine the effect that magnetic fields with axial , toroidal , and helical topologies have on the jet dynamics .",
    "in particular , we have found that an axial magnetic field behaves as an additional gas pressure , leading to a sharper recollimation - shock structure and thus larger flow accelerations . on the other hand",
    ", a toroidal magnetic field tends to reduce the inward motion of the rarefaction waves , thus leading to a weaker recollimation - shock structure and accelerations that are even smaller than in the case of a purely hydrodynamical evolution .",
    "finally , a helical magnetic field tends to yield a behaviour which is a combination of those observed for purely axial / toroidal magnetic fields , with larger lorentz factors , but also with a rather complex recollimation - shock substructure .",
    "as predicted by the basic properties of the ar booster , we have found that the boost in the jet flow , as measured in terms of the maximum lorentz factor , is anti - correlated with the values of the specific enthalpy .",
    "furthermore , the boost grows quadratically with the initial magnetic field in the case of a purely axial flow , at smaller rates in the case of a helical magnetic field , and it decreases systematically when a purely toroidal magnetic field is present . finally , we have shown that the maximum lorentz factor exhibits a smooth behaviour in terms of the initial pitch in the case of an axial magnetic field .",
    "stationary components are commonly seen in parsec - scale vlbi observations of agn jets ( see , _ e.g. , _   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , being normally associated with recollimation shocks .",
    "studying in detail the structure in these stationary components for a direct comparison with our simulations requires however resolving the jet structure across the jet width .",
    "this can be achieved through `` regular '' cm - vlbi observations of nearby sources , like m87 , but for the majority of the agn jets it would require a significant increase in angular resolution .",
    "this can be obtained through vlbi observations at even shorter wavelengths , in which the 3 mm gmva ( global millimeter vlbi array ) and 1.3 mm vlbi observations with the event horizon telescope and black - hole cam projects can achieve angular resolutions between 50 and 20 microarcseconds ( see , _ e.g. , _   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and through space vlbi observations .",
    "the space vlbi mission `` radioastron '' has recently successfully achieved ground - space fringe detections for observations at 1.3 cm on baselines longer than eight earth diameters , allowing imaging the innermost regions in agn jets with an unprecedented angular resolution of @xmath126 20 microarcseconds @xcite .    whilst the range of simulations carried out here have tried to explore a rather large portion of the space of parameters",
    ", a number of improvements on the approach followed here can be made .",
    "first , even though we have assumed an over - pressured jet to produce the recollimation - shock structure , a pressure mismatch between jet and ambient medium arises naturally if the pressure in the ambient medium decreases with distance from the central object . in this case",
    ", the recollimation - shock structure depends on the ambient - medium pressure scale ( see , _ e.g. , _   * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although we do not expect that significant qualitative differences will emerge from a more realistic modelling of the ambient medium , we will extend the current investigation to include larger overpressure ratios , as well as declining pressure profiles outside the jet .",
    "second , in this work we assume the relativistic jet is kinematically dominated initially for all values of the initial magnetic field .",
    "however , magnetically dominated relativistic jets ( poynting - flux dominated jets ) might be plausible from the results of previous analytical ( _ e.g. , _   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and numerical studies ( _ e.g. , _   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". we will investigate this type of relativistic jets in future work .",
    "third , it is clear that the magnetic modifications of the recollimation - shock structure found here may affect in a significant way the signatures of stationary components seen in several agn jets , especially in polarized flux .",
    "an even clearer signature difference may be obtained when a shock like disturbance propagates through the stationary recollimation - shock structure . in view of this",
    ", we will investigate the propagation of such a shock - like disturbance through a magnetized recollimation shock and calculate the corresponding emission following the approach presented in , _",
    "e.g. , _  @xcite .    finally ,",
    "although our simulations show that the recollimation - shock strength depends on the jet magnetization and magnetic field structure , it is clear that its observed appearance as imaged by vlbi would also depend on the jet - viewing angle , and is obviously influenced by doppler - boosting effects .",
    "hence , depending on the jet bulk flow lorentz factor and viewing angle , the doppler boosting may cancel , or even reverse , the increased emissivity obtained in the recollimation shock and due to the enhanced particle and magnetic - field energy rest - mass density ( see , _",
