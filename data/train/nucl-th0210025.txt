    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , the only legitimate candidate for a theory of strong interactions , is a non - abelian gauge theory with gauge group @xmath2 ( in color space ) coupled to quarks in the fundamental ( triplet ) representation .",
    "it contains the remarkable postulate of exact @xmath2 color symmetry .",
    "quarks and gluons carry color and are the fundamental particles that interact via the color force .",
    "an important feature of this theory is that the @xmath3 and @xmath4 quarks , for the purpose of the strong interaction , are regarded as massless . in this limit",
    ", chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken in the ground state of qcd .",
    "nuclei should provide an excellent testing ground for this theory because nuclei are stable systems , made up of quarks and gluons bound together by the strong force .",
    "however , the quarks and gluons are hidden and nuclei seem to be composed on hadrons bound together by the exchange of evanescent mesons .",
    "the hadrons that are the constituents of nuclei are identified with color singlet states and have strong interactions very different in nature than that of gluon exchange by colored quarks and gluons .",
    "there seems at first glance to be a contradiction between the fundamental theory , qcd , and the very nature of nuclei .",
    "this contradiction can be resolved by accounting for the fact that effective theories of the strong interaction , in which the degrees of freedom are hadrons , can yield results that are equivalent , over some range of kinematic resolution , to those of qcd .",
    "indeed , it is widely realized that the phenomenon of the spontaneously broken chiral symmetry in qcd is equivalent to the pseudovector pion - nucleon interaction , which accounts for the long - range , low momentum transfer , aspects of nuclear physics .",
    "the same chiral structure also accounts for the relatively weak soft pionic fields in nuclei .",
    "furthermore , at low momentum transfer the relevant degrees of freedom are quasi - particle excitations of the system described by landau - fermi liquid theory .",
    "thus , while qcd is the fundamental theory of strong interactions , it is not required to explain the structure of nuclei observed in low - energy processes .",
    "the availability of high energy beams provides the opportunity to observe features of nuclear structure at small distance scales , which may reveal the presence of qcd as the ultimate source of the strong interaction .",
    "the central features of qcd , quarks and color , lead to two separate , but related , avenues of experimental investigation which we examine in this review .",
    "the first avenue is that of high density nuclear matter .",
    "what happens during the brief intervals when two or more nucleons overlap in space ?",
    "can we account for the interactions using meson exchanges , or do we instead need to consider explicitly quark aspects such as quark exchanges between nucleons and the kneading of the nucleon s constituents into six- or nine - quark bags ? at high densities , can we detect the presence of superfast quarks , i.e. quarks carrying a light cone momentum fraction greater than that of a nucleon at rest ?",
    "the second avenue is concerned with the role of color in high momentum transfer processes which are exclusive ( or sufficiently exclusive ) so that the interference effects of quantum mechanics must be taken into account .",
    "then , the use of high momentum kinematics offers a remarkable opportunity to observe the color - singlet fluctuations of a hadron in configurations of very small spatial extent , _ viz .",
    "_ , point - like configurations .",
    "if such configurations exist , they do not interact strongly because the effects of the emitted gluons cancel , just as the interaction of an electric dipole decreases with size of dipole due to the cancellation of the electromagnetic interactions .",
    "such effects are called color - coherent phenomena and include the subject known as color transparency .",
    "thus , we are concerned with studying the diverse subjects of high - density cold nuclear matter and color coherence .    while these subjects are connected by their importance in establishing qcd as the underlying theory of the strong interaction , they may also come together in the understanding of exotic phenomena in nature . studies of the local high - density fluctuations are important to understanding the equation of state of cold , dense matter which is crucial in understanding the possibility of the transition of neutron stars to more dense states like `` quark stars '' ,",
    "whose experimental existence was suggested recently  @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon of color transparency means that for a short period of time a nucleon can be in a spatially small configuration . in this configuration",
    ", the nucleon can tunnel through the potential barrier given by the repulsive core of the nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath5 ) interaction .",
    "this provides a possible mechanism for a phase transition to a new form of matter for a sufficiently dense nuclear system , such as in the core of neutron star .",
    "the following is a brief outline of this review .",
    "the quark - gluon physics of high density fluctuations in nuclei is examined in sec .  2 , which begins with a brief discussion of the relevant history .",
    "the discovery of the nuclear emc effect almost twenty years ago brought the subjects of quarks into nuclear physics with great impact .",
    "however , the specific causes of the modifications observed in nuclear structure functions have not yet been identified with certainty .",
    "thus , the questions regarding quark dynamics of nuclei raised by that momentous discovery have not yet been answered .",
    "the various ideas invoked to explain this effect are reviewed .",
    "we then argue that an experimental program focused on discovering scaling in deep inelastic scattering at high values of bjorken-@xmath6 ( @xmath71.2 ) will reveal the nature of high - density fluctuations of cold nuclear matter .",
    "further deep inelastic scattering measurements of backward going nucleons in coincidence with the outgoing electron offer the promise of finally determining the cause of the emc effect .",
    "section  3 is concerned with the role of color in nuclear physics .",
    "electron scattering experiments at high momentum transfer in which one or two nucleons are knocked out , performed with sufficient precision to verify that no other particles are produced , could reveal the fundamental nature of color dynamics : that , for coherent processes , the effects of gluons emitted by a small color singlet object are canceled . in that case , the dynamical nature of the nucleon form factor at high momentum transfer will be revealed .",
    "similarly motivated experiments in which a vector meson is produced in a coherent reaction with a deuteron target at large momentum transfers are also discussed .",
    "section  4 presents a summary of the plan proposed to investigate the questions arising from the study of hadrons in the nuclear medium .",
    "we begin this section with a brief discussion of the history of experimental lepton - nuclear physics .",
    "prior to the completion of thomas jefferson national accelerator facility ( jefferson lab ) , experimental studies of nuclei using lepton probes could be discussed in terms of two clearly different classes :    \\(a ) experiments performed at electron machines with low incident electron energies , @xmath8  gev , in which the typical energy and momentum transfers , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , were comparable to the nuclear scale @xmath11 where @xmath12  mev / c is the characteristic fermi momentum of nuclei .",
    "these reactions were inclusive @xmath13 and semi - inclusive @xmath14 and covered mainly the quasi - elastic and the low lying resonance regions ( the @xmath15 isobars ) , corresponding to relatively large values of bjorken-@xmath6 ( @xmath16 , where @xmath17 ) .",
    "\\(b ) deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) experiments which probed nuclei at @xmath18 and large @xmath19 scales , greater than about @xmath20  gev@xmath21 , which resolved the parton constituents of the nucleus .",
    "the first class of experiments are unable to resolve the short range structure of nuclei , and the second , while having good resolution , typically involved inclusive measurements which averaged out the fine details and were limited by low luminosities and other factors .",
    "it is interesting to notice that there is a clear gap between the kinematic regions of these two classes of experiments .",
    "this corresponds exactly to the optimal range for the study of the nucleonic degrees of freedom in nuclei , @xmath22  gev@xmath21 , for which short - range correlations ( srcs ) between nucleons can be resolved , and the quark degrees of freedom are only a small correction .",
    "work at jefferson lab has started to fill this gap in a series of quasi - elastic @xmath23 , and @xmath24 experiments .",
    "previously , this range was just touched by inclusive experiments at slac@xcite which also provided the first measurement of @xmath25 form factors at large @xmath19 . a number of these high - energy experiments probe the light - cone projection of the nuclear wave function and in particular the light - cone nuclear density matrix , @xmath26 , in the kinematics where the light - cone momentum fraction @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) so that short range correlations between nucleons play an important role .",
    "it is already known that the existence of srcs gives a natural explanation of the practically @xmath29-independent spectrum of the emission of fast backward nucleons and mesons , as well as the practically @xmath19- and @xmath6-independent value of the ratio of @xmath30 for @xmath31  gev@xmath21 and @xmath32  @xcite .",
    "overall , these and other high - energy data indicate a significant probability of these correlations ( @xmath3325% of nucleons in heavy nuclei ) which involve momenta larger than the fermi momentum .",
    "these probabilities are in qualitative agreement with calculations of nuclear wave functions using realistic @xmath5 potentials  @xcite .",
    "most of this probability ( @xmath3380% ) is related to two - nucleon srcs with the rest involving @xmath34 correlations ( see e.g. , ref .",
    "the current experiments at jefferson lab will allow a detailed study of two - nucleon srcs  @xcite , and take a first look at three - nucleon correlations  @xcite .",
    "we expect that experiments at an electron energy of up to @xmath35  gev  @xcite will allow further explorations of srcs in the three - nucleon correlation region , substantially extending the region of initial nucleon momenta and the recoil nucleus excitation energies that can be probed in quasi - elastic @xmath23 , and @xmath24 reactions .",
    "the 12  gev upgrade at jefferson lab will also be of a great benefit for studies of deep inelastic scattering off nuclei ( experiments in class ( b ) ) .",
    "it will enable us to extend the high @xmath19 inclusive @xmath36 measurement at @xmath37 to the deep inelastic region where the process is dominated by the scattering from individual quarks in the nucleus with momenta exceeding the average momentum of a nucleon in the nucleus ( superfast quarks ) .",
    "such quarks are likely to originate from configurations in which two or more nucleons come close together .",
    "thus , these measurements will complement the studies of srcs by exploring their sub - nucleonic structure .",
    "the second extension of class ( b ) reactions concerns the measurement of nuclear dis reactions in the @xmath14 semi - inclusive regime , in which the detection of the additional nucleon in spectator kinematics will allow us to tag electron scattering from a bound nucleon .",
    "these studies may provide a number of unexpected results similar to those in the inclusive studies of parton densities in nuclei , which yielded the observation of the emc effect  @xcite : a depletion of the nuclear quark parton density as compared to that in a free nucleon at @xmath38 , which demonstrated unambiguously that nuclei can not be described merely as a collection of nucleons without any extra constituents .    among several suggested interpretations of the emc effect ,",
    "the idea of mesonic degrees of freedom ( nuclear binding models ) was the only one which produced a natural link to the meson theory of nuclear forces .",
    "this explanation naturally led to a prediction of a large enhancement of the anti - quark distribution in nuclei  @xcite .",
    "a dedicated experiment was performed at fermi lab using the drell - yan process to measure the ratio @xmath39 .",
    "the result of this experiment  @xcite was another major surprise : instead of a @xmath40% enhancement of @xmath41 , a few percent suppression was observed .",
    "further indications of the unexpected partonic structure of nuclei come from the studies of the gluon densities in nuclei using exact qcd sum rules@xcite as well as the analysis  @xcite of the data on the scaling violation of @xmath42 indicate that the gluon densities should be significantly enhanced in nuclei at @xmath43",
    ". however the inclusive nature of these measurements does not provide insight into the qcd mechanism for the depletion of the dis structure functions .",
    "the semi - inclusive dis @xmath14 reactions with the detection of backward - going nucleons will test many models of the emc effect , which was previously impossible due to the inclusive nature of @xmath13 reactions .",
    "semi - inclusive dis reactions are ultimately related to the understanding of the qcd dynamics of multi - nucleon systems at small distances .",
    "thus , it is crucial that these studies be done in parallel with the above mentioned studies of srcs .",
    "the proton electromagnetic radius is @xmath44 fm , and in the ground state of infinite nuclear matter the average ( center - to - center ) distance between nearby nucleons is @xmath331.7 fm .",
    "thus , under normal conditions nucleons are closely packed and nearly overlap . despite this , quark aspects of nuclear structure are not evident for most of nuclear physics .",
    "a possible dynamical explanation for this , in terms of the strong - coupling limit of qcd , was presented in ref .",
    "this can also be seen from the fact that typical nuclear excitations are at much lower energies than nucleon excitations ( @xmath45  500  mev ) .",
    "besides , in low energy qcd , the pion , being a pseudogoldstone , interacts with the amplitude @xmath46 , leading to a suppression of the near  threshold pion ( multi - pion ) production .",
    "however , quantum fluctuations must occur in any quantum system , and well - designed experiments may expose the physics occurring when nucleons occasionally encounter each other at smaller than average distances . if such a fluctuation reduces the center - to - center separation to @xmath47  fm , then there is a significant region of overlap .",
    "assuming a uniform nucleon charge distribution , the density in the region of overlap is twice that of the nucleon , or about four to five times that of normal nuclear matter , @xmath48 nucleon/@xmath49 . at these densities ,",
    "the physics of confinement , which typifies the strong - coupling limit of qcd , may no longer be applicable and the chiral symmetry may be ( partially ) restored , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "one can also think of these high - density fluctuations as nuclear states with excitation energies large enough to modify the structure of underlying nucleonic constituents .",
    "hence , dense nuclear matter may look very different from a system of closely packed nucleons . from this viewpoint ,",
    "it is encouraging that experimental data on the emc effect indicate that deviations from the expectations of the nucleonic model of nuclei grow approximately linearly with the nuclear density , suggesting that the properties of the quark - gluon droplets could indeed deviate very strongly from those of a collection of nucleons .",
    "it is important to recall that the properties of dense nuclear matter are closely related to outstanding issues of qcd such as the existence of chiral symmetry restoration and deconfinement , as well as determining the nature of the onset of quark - gluon degrees of freedom and the structure of the phase transition from hadronic to quark - gluon states of matter . in qcd ,",
    "transitions to new phases of matter are possible in different regimes of density and temperature . in particular , it has been suggested  @xcite that nuclear matter could exist in a color superconductivity phase caused by the condensation of diquarks .",
    "recent estimates suggest that the average nuclear density could lie in between that of the dilute nucleon phase and the superconducting phase  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore natural to ask whether one can observe precursors of such a phase transition by studying the quark - gluon properties of superdense droplets of nuclear matter , i.e. , configurations when two or more nucleons come close together .",
    "it should also be remembered that the emc effect has been interpreted as a delocalization of quarks in nuclei , which is qualitatively consistent with a proximity to the phase transition .",
    "more recently , measurements of in - medium proton form factors also hint at such a modification of nucleon structure  @xcite .",
    "so far , the major thrust of studies looking for the phase transitions in hadronic matter has been focused in the high temperature region ( fig .  [ fig.phase ] ) , which may be realized in high - energy heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the low temperature region of high densities , critical for building the complete picture of phase transitions and for determining if the transition from neutron to quark stars is possible , is practically unexplored .",
    "we wish to argue that this unexplored low temperature region , crucial for the understanding of the equation of state of neutron stars , is amenable to studies using high energy lepton probes . jefferson lab , upgraded to higher energies  @xcite , would be able to explore this region and provide studies of nuclear fluctuations as dense as 45 @xmath50 .",
    "the intellectual problems associated with establishing the existence of high density fluctuations of nuclear matter are formidable .",
    "we can not conceive of a single experiment which would be able to answer all of the interesting questions about the role of non - nucleonic degrees of freedom , but a series of correlated measurements may succeed . as mentioned above , we anticipate that studies to be done at jefferson lab at @xmath51  gev will provide additional information about nucleonic degrees of freedom in the @xmath52 sector of srcs .",
    "this will certainly help us in refining the envisioned experimental program .",
    "our view is that three key experimental programs , for which the use of @xmath53  gev electrons is essential , are needed .    *",
    "quasi - elastic electro - disintegration of light nuclei at @xmath54  gev@xmath21 , covering a wide range of angles and missing momenta ( in excess of @xmath47  gev / c ) , with the goal of probing the structure of srcs .",
    "* deep inelastic scattering at @xmath0 , with the goal of observing superfast quarks in nuclei . * tagged structure functions ( measurement of a nucleon from the target fragmentation region in coincidence with the outgoing electron ) with the goal of directly observing the presence of non - nucleonic degrees of freedom in droplets of superdense matter .    the first goal of studying srcs using quasi - elastic electro - disintegration of light nuclei is based on the capabilities of jefferson lab to perform fully exclusive measurements .",
    "the exclusive reactions using a deuteron target in a wide range of recoil nucleon momenta and angles will allow us to obtain insight into many fundamental questions , e.g. the probability of pre - existing non - nucleon components in the deuteron wave function , the transition of meson currents to the quark - interchange mechanism in the @xmath5 interaction , and the dynamical structure of the nuclear core . for heavier ( @xmath55 ) nuclei",
    ", the capability to measure a recoil nucleon with light cone momentum fraction @xmath56 will provide direct access to the three - nucleon correlation structure of the nuclear wave function providing the unprecedented opportunity to study the dynamics of the three - nucleon force .",
    "the second goal of learning about superfast quarks will be accomplished by studying inclusive electron nucleus scattering in the scaling region at @xmath57 , where this process measures , _ in a model independent way _ , the probability of finding a quark that carries a larger light - cone momentum than one would expect from a quark in a low - momentum nucleon ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "obviously , very few such superfast quarks can originate from the effects of the nuclear mean field , but the uncertainty principle indicates that such quarks in nuclei could arise from fluctuations of superdense configurations consisting either of a few overlapping nucleons with large momenta , or of more complicated multi - quark configurations .",
    "the study of the structure of these superdense fluctuations would be the major goal of deep inelastic scattering measurements at high @xmath6 .",
    "for instance , high precision measurements of the @xmath29-dependence of the cross section would permit the investigation of the density dependence of the superfast quark probability in the nuclear medium .",
    "the functional dependence of this probability on bjorken-@xmath6 would allow us to disentangle the contributions of two- or multi - nucleon droplets from more exotic components ( e.g. , 6- , or 9-quark bags ) .",
    "the third goal of determining the modification of the quark - gluon structure of nucleons in a dense nuclear environment could be realized by measuring tagged structure functions in semi - inclusive dis reactions .",
    "for example , the observation of a backward - moving nucleon or nucleons will be used as a tag to select hard scattering from a short - range correlation of nucleons while the dis characteristics of the event will be used to study modifications of the parton density .",
    "these studies primarily require the isolation of a backward - moving nucleon for which a tagging procedure , rather than reconstruction of a missing nucleon , will provide the cleanest signature .",
    "successful completion of these programs will allow significant progress in understanding such unresolved topics of strong interaction physics as , _ interaction of quarks at high densities and low temperatures _ , and _ the quark - gluon structure of nuclei_.      the first step of the program will be to study the structure of srcs in terms of nucleonic degrees of freedom , and map out the strength of two - nucleon and multi - nucleon correlations in nuclei .",
    "this can be accomplished by combining moderate energy ( @xmath59  gev ) inclusive scattering experiments from light and heavy nuclei with moderate and higher energy coincidence reactions on few - body nuclei , as described in the previous section . here",
    "we present an experimental overview of these reactions .",
    "the observation of srcs in nuclei has long been considered one of the most significant aims of nuclear physics .",
    "these correlations , though elusive , are not small : calculations of nuclear wave functions with realistic @xmath5 potentials consistently indicate that in heavy nuclei about @xmath60 of the nucleons have momenta above the fermi surface  @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to about @xmath61 of the kinetic energy coming from srcs .",
    "the problem has been a lack of experimental data at high - momentum transfer kinematics which could decisively discriminate between the effects of the srcs in the initial state and the long - range multi - step effects such as final state interactions ( fsis ) and meson exchange currents ( mecs ) . before we can proceed to study srcs in nuclei",
    ", we must consider these processes . in the following sections",
    ", we will show that some of these effects are suppressed at high @xmath19 , while the remaining effects do not mask the dynamics of the srcs .",
    "_ final state interactions : _",
    "+ although final state interactions in nucleon knockout reactions do not disappear at large @xmath62 two important simplifications occur which make the extraction of information about the short - range nuclear structure possible :    * in high energy kinematics a new ( approximate ) conservation law exists - the light - cone momentum fractions of slow nucleons do not change if they scatter elastically with the ejected nucleon which maintains its high momentum during the rescattering  @xcite .",
    "+ to demonstrate this feature let us consider the propagation of a fast nucleon with four - momentum @xmath63 through the nuclear medium .",
    "we chose the @xmath64-axis in the direction of @xmath65 such that @xmath66 .",
    "after this nucleon makes a small angle rescattering in its interaction with a bound nucleon of four - momentum @xmath67 , it maintains its high momentum and leading @xmath64-direction with the four - momentum @xmath68 , where @xmath69 .",
    "the bound nucleon four - momentum becomes @xmath70 .",
    "the energy momentum conservation for this scattering allows us to write for the `` @xmath71 '' component ( @xmath72 ) : @xmath73 from eq.([claw ] ) for the change of the `` @xmath71 '' component of the bound nucleon momentum one obtains @xmath74 where we define @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) and use the fact that @xmath77 .",
    "therefore @xmath78 .",
    "the latter indicates that , with an increase of energy , a new conservation law emerges in which the light - cone momentum fractions of slow nucleons , @xmath79 , are conserved .",
    "the unique simplification of the high energy rescattering is that although both the energy and momentum of the bound nucleon are distorted due to rescattering , the combination @xmath80 is not .",
    "+ figure  [ fig.alpha_conservation ] demonstrates the accuracy of this conservation law for a propagating nucleon over a range of four - momenta relevant to our discussion .",
    "it is important to note that the average transferred momentum in the @xmath5 rescattering amplitude for @xmath81  gev / c is @xmath82  ( gev / c)@xmath21 .",
    "thus , starting from @xmath83  gev / c momenta of the propagating nucleon , the conservation of @xmath79 ( @xmath84 ) is accurate to better than @xmath85 and improves with increasing momentum .",
    "note that the conservation of @xmath79 to this level is sufficient for studying srcs for which the @xmath79 distribution of the nucleons has a rather slow , ( @xmath86 ) variation .",
    "indeed , this variation is expected to be much flatter than the corresponding distribution generated by a mean - field interaction . *",
    "the small angle rescatterings of high - energy ( @xmath87  gev / c ) nucleons can be described by the generalized eikonal approximation  ( gea ) which takes into account the difference between the space - time picture of the proton - nucleus scattering ( a proton coming from @xmath88 ) and @xmath89 process ( a proton is produced inside the nucleus ) , and also accounts for the non - zero fermi momenta of rescattered nucleons  @xcite .",
    "additionally , the description of small angle rescattering is simplified due to approximate energy independence of the @xmath90 and @xmath91 total cross sections in the high @xmath19 limit ( starting at @xmath92  gev@xmath21 , which corresponds to @xmath93  gev / c ) .",
    "the above two features of small angle rescattering in the high @xmath19 domain make it possible to evaluate fsis reliably , identifying kinematic requirements which will allow us to separate src effects from long range fsi contributions .",
    "note that the minimal value of @xmath19 for which one expects the eikonal approximation to be valid can be estimated from the application of glauber theory to @xmath94 reactions .",
    "extensive studies have demonstrated long ago that the glauber theory of @xmath94 processes can describe the data within a few percent starting at energies as low as @xmath95  gev , which corresponds to @xmath96  gev@xmath21 in @xmath14 and ( @xmath97 ) reactions .",
    "_ contribution of meson exchange currents : _ + the major problem we face in the estimation of mecs in @xmath98 processes is that with an increase of energies the virtuality of the exchanged mesons grows proportional to @xmath19 ( @xmath99 ) . even though the idea of deeply virtual exchanged mesons is highly complicated or may even be meaningless ( see discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , one can still estimate its @xmath19-dependence as compared to the src contribution .    in a kinematic",
    "setting typical for studies of srcs , in which the knocked - out nucleon carries almost the entire momentum of the virtual photon ( while the missing four - momentum of the recoil system does not change with @xmath19 ) , the @xmath19-dependence of the mec amplitude can be estimated as follows : @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the meson electromagnetic current proportional to the elastic form factor of the meson @xmath102 , and @xmath103  gev@xmath21 .",
    "for the meson - nucleon vertices , @xmath104 , we assume a dipole dependence with @xmath105  gev@xmath21 .    since the leading @xmath19-dependence in the src contribution comes from the nucleon elastic form factors , eqn .",
    "( [ mec ] ) will result in an additional @xmath106 suppression of the mec amplitude as compared to the src contribution .",
    "note that this gives an upper limit to the mec contribution , since for large @xmath19 the quark counting rule predicts stronger @xmath19 suppression for @xmath107@xcite .",
    "thus , one expects that mec contributions will be strongly suppressed as soon as @xmath19 is greater than @xmath108 and @xmath109 , both @xmath110  gev@xmath21 .",
    "this conclusion is relevant only for small angle nucleon knock - out kinematics ( optimal for studies of srcs ) . in the large angle kinematics quark - exchange mechanism",
    "may become important similar to the large angle @xmath111 reactions@xcite .",
    "_ isobar current ( ic ) contribution : _ + for the case of ic contributions , the virtual photon produces the @xmath15 isobar in the intermediate state which subsequently rescatters off the spectator nucleon through the @xmath112 channel .",
    "there are several factors which contribute to the suppression of ic contributions at high @xmath19 as compared to the src contributions .",
    "the main factors which should be emphasized are the energy dependence of the @xmath113 amplitude and the @xmath19-dependence of the electromagnetic @xmath114 transition form factors , as compared with the elastic @xmath115 amplitude and the @xmath116 form factor respectively .    the @xmath117 amplitude is known to be dominated by the pion reggeon exchange with the @xmath118-reggeon which dominates at very high energies being a small correction up to the energies @xmath119  gev  @xcite .",
    "based on the rule that the energy dependence of the feynman amplitude of the scattering process is defined by the spin , @xmath120 of the exchanged particle as : @xmath121 one observes that the @xmath117 transition amplitude is suppressed at least by a factor @xmath122 ( at @xmath123 gev@xmath21 ) as compared to the elastic @xmath115 amplitude leading to a similar suppression for ic contribution .",
    "in addition there is the experimental indication that the electromagnetic @xmath114 transition is decreasing faster with @xmath19 as compared to the elastic @xmath124 transition amplitude  @xcite .",
    "it follows from the above discussions that the smallest value of @xmath19 required for effective studies of srcs in the discussed class of experiments is @xmath96  gev@xmath21 .",
    "the upper limit for @xmath19 for studies of srcs comes from the onset of color coherence phenomena at @xmath125  gev@xmath21 , when fsis will not maintain their energy independent characteristic for small angle hadronic rescattering ( a discussion on color coherence is given in sec.3 ) .",
    "hence the optimal range for probing srcs is @xmath126 this range is large enough to check the validity of the @xmath19-independence of the extracted parameters of the srcs .",
    "jefferson lab experiments at @xmath51  gev and very large missing momenta can reach the lower limit of this range and they would have only a very limited access to the upper limit of eqn .",
    "( [ range ] ) . with the upgrade of the beam energy the whole range of eqn .",
    "( [ range ] ) will be be easily accessible for jefferson lab .",
    "this also permits a wider coverage of missing momenta and excitation energies of the recoil nuclear system .",
    "the study of the @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath127 reactions in the ( @xmath128  gev@xmath21 ) range will allow a direct measurements of the nucleon momentum distributions and spectral functions out to large momenta , between @xmath129 and @xmath130  mev / c .",
    "here one expects that the nucleon degrees of freedom are dominant and one can explore short - range correlations .",
    "although two nucleon correlations are expected to be the dominant part of the srcs , triple and higher order srcs ( where more than two nucleons come close together ) are significant as well - they are estimated to constitute @xmath3320% of all srcs  @xcite . at initial momenta @xmath131  mev / c the non - nucleonic degrees of freedom should play an increasingly dominant role and for the first time one will be able to investigate them in detail .",

    "the basic idea is that the effects of gluons emitted by a color - singlet which is small - sized ( or in a point - like configuration ) are canceled if the process is coherent .",
    "this is because , if the process is coherent , one computes the scattering amplitude by summing the terms caused by gluon emissions from different quarks .",

    "to observe color coherence effects it is necessary to find processes which are dominated by the scattering of hadrons in a plc and hence have amplitudes that can be calculated using pqcd .",
    "a number of such processes have been suggested in the literature , and the corresponding qcd factorization theorems have been proven for them .",
    "these processes include diffractive pion dissociation into two high transverse momentum jets  @xcite and exclusive production of vector mesons  @xcite .",
    "experiments at hera which studied exclusive production of vector mesons in deep inelastic scattering ( recently reviewed in  @xcite ) , have convincingly confirmed the basic pqcd predictions  a fast increase of the cross section with energy at large @xmath19 , dominance of the longitudinal photon cross section and a weaker @xmath334-dependence of the @xmath118-meson production at large @xmath19 relative to @xmath335 photoproduction .",
    "a distinctive feature of processes such as di  jet and vector meson production is that , in the case of nuclear targets , the incoming @xmath336 pair does not experience attenuation for the range of @xmath6 for which gluon shadowing is small ( @xmath337 ) .",

    "the study of this reaction also allowed measuring the pion @xmath336 wave function  @xcite , which turned out to be close to the asymptotic one at @xmath341  gev / c .",
    "evidence for color transparency effects was reported also in incoherent vector meson production in dis scattering of muons  @xcite .",
    "hence we conclude that the general concepts of ct in pqcd domain are now firmly established for high energy processes : the presence of plcs in vector mesons and pions and the form of the small size @xmath336 dipole - nucleon interaction at high energies are well established experimentally which can be achieved at rhic , hera , and lhc , the quantum field theory treatment of the ct predicts a gradual disappearance of the ct and the onset of the color opacity phenomenon . ]",
    "it is natural to apply the ct ideas to address the question of interplay of small and large distances in various high - momentum transfer processes at intermediate energies .",
    "this involves three key elements : ( i ) the presence of configurations of small transverse size in hadrons , ( ii ) the small size configurations not expanding as they exit the nucleus ( i.e. a large coherence length ) at high energies , which leads to the possibility of considering the small - sized configurations as frozen during the collision , and ( iii ) the weakness of the interaction of small color singlet objects at high energies ( for example , for a small color @xmath336 dipole of transverse size @xmath342 , the effective cross section is @xmath343 ) .",
    "it also is vital that the experiment be performed with sufficient precision to be certain that no additional pions be created .",
    "this is necessary to maintain the exclusive or nearly exclusive nature of the experiment , which is required for the necessary quantum interference effects to dominate the physics .",
    "the considered effect in general is analogous to the reduction of the electromagnetic interaction strength of the electrically neutral @xmath344 dipole at small separations .",
    "however the uniqueness of qcd is in the prediction of the similar phenomena for color - neutral @xmath345 configurations . establishing the existence of color coherence effects for three - quark systems would verify the color su(3 ) nature of qcd , and remains an important unmet challenge .",
    "the major directions for study of ct related phenomena at jefferson lab are determined by the fact that one probes the transition from soft to hard qcd regime .",
    "these studies include :    * determining the interplay between the contribution of large and small distances for specific processes . * studying the interaction cross section of small objects in kinematic regions for which quark exchanges may play the dominant role as compared to gluon exchanges ( at high energies the two - gluon exchange in @xmath346-channel dominates ) . *",

    "all of these aspects can be addressed if one considers the fundamental physics involved with the nucleon form factor at large @xmath19 and the scattering amplitude for large angle hadron - nucleon elastic scattering . in qcd",
    "it is expected that at very large @xmath19 the form factor and scattering amplitude are each dominated by contributions arising from the minimal fock space components in the nucleon ( hadron ) wave function .",
    "such components , involving the smallest possible number of constituents , are believed to be of a very small size , or to contain a plc . to determine the values of @xmath19 for which plcs start to dominate , brodsky  @xcite and mueller  @xcite suggested the study of quasi - elastic hard reactions @xmath347 .",
    "if the energies and momentum transfers are large enough , one expects that the projectile and ejected nucleon travel through the nucleus as point - like ( small size ) configurations , resulting in a cross section proportional to @xmath29 .      to interpret the physics of quasi - elastic reactions one has to address two questions :    * can the plcs be treated as a frozen during the time that the projectile is passing through the nucleus ?",
    "* at what momentum transfer do the effects of plcs dominate in the elementary amplitude ?",
    "* do they have small interaction cross sections ?",
    "these questions must be addressed if color transparency is to be studied at jefferson lab .",
    "if the momentum transfer is not large enough for the plc to dominate or if the plc is not frozen and expands , then there will be strong final state interactions as the plc moves through the nucleus .    to appreciate the problems we shall discuss the effects of expansion in a bit more detail .",
    "current color transparency experiments are performed in kinematic regions where the expansion of the produced small system is very important . in other words",

    "hence a decrease of the quenching effect with an increase of @xmath19 may mask the ct effects at intermediate @xmath387 . ]",

    "[ fig.trans12lim](a ) and @xmath390  gev@xmath21 in fig.[fig.trans12lim](b ) ) consistent with the eva data . in the case of the slower expansion rate ,",
    "[ fig.trans12lim](a ) , the transparency is rather sensitive to @xmath385 and the analysis yields a lower limit of @xmath391 gev@xmath21 . for a faster expansion rate ,",
    "[ fig.trans12lim](b ) , the nuclear transparency is less sensitive to @xmath385 , since for intermediate range of @xmath19 the plc expands well before it escapes the nucleus .",
    "the analysis in fig .",
    "[ fig.trans12lim](b ) yields @xmath392  gev@xmath21 .",
    "combining these two analyses one can set the lower limit for the formation of plcs at @xmath393  gev@xmath21 ( see eqn .",
    "( [ range ] ) for implication of this limit in src studies ) .",
    "the upgrade of jefferson lab would improve the situation , by pushing the measurement of @xmath370 to a high enough @xmath19 where the color transparency predictions appreciably diverge from the predictions of conventional calculations ( see figs .  [ fig.transparent ] and  [ fig.trans12lim ] ) .",
    "indeed , the eva data have established in a model independent way that at least for nucleon momenta @xmath394  gev / c , expansion effects are not large enough to mask the increase of the transparency .",
    "hence measurements at @xmath395  gev@xmath21 , corresponding to comparable momenta of the ejectile nucleon , would unambiguously answer the question whether nucleon form factors at these @xmath19 are dominated by small or large size configurations .",
    "although @xmath14 measurements will allow an unambiguous check of the existence of color transparency , it will require a challengingly high accuracy from experiments to investigate the details of the expansion effects ( fig .",
    "[ fig.transparent ] ) .",
    "thus , although this is the simplest reaction to measure , a much wider range of reactions would be necessary to build a sufficiently complete picture of phenomenon and to scan the expansion of the small size wave packets .    to obtain a more detailed knowledge of the interaction of plcs with nuclei we can also select a processes in which the ejectile could interact a second time during its propagation through the nucleus  @xcite ( double scattering reactions )",
    "this can be done by studying recoil nucleons with perpendicular ( vs @xmath10 ) momenta @xmath396  mev / c . at low @xmath19 , the majority of such high momentum nucleons come from rescattering with the spectator nucleon in the nucleus .",
    "therefore , the number of such nucleons should decrease substantially with the onset of ct which reduces the probability of rescattering .",
    "an important advantage of a double scattering reaction is that the disappearance of the final state interactions can be studied using the lightest nuclei ( d,@xmath397he,@xmath398he ) , for which wave functions are known much better and where one can use a generalized eikonal approximation , which accounts for the nonzero values of the momenta of recoil nucleons  @xcite .",
    "another advantage of double scattering reactions is that inter - nucleon distances probed are not large , @xmath399  fm .",
    "these distances are comparable to the coherence length for values of @xmath19 as low as about @xmath59  gev@xmath21 , and may provide evidence for a number of color coherent phenomena in the transitional @xmath19 region .",
    "ultimately , double scattering measurements will allow us to determine whether the lack of the ct in @xmath89 reactions at @xmath400  gev@xmath21 region is related to the large expansion rate of plcs , or if it is because plcs are not produced at all for these values of @xmath19 .",
    "an appropriate measure for color transparency in double scattering reactions is a ratio of cross sections , measured at kinematics for which double scattering is dominant , to the cross section measured at kinematics where the effect of glauber screening is more important .",
    "theoretical investigations of these reactions  @xcite demonstrated that it is possible to separate these two kinematic regions by choosing two momentum intervals for the recoil nucleon : ( @xmath401  mev / c ) for double scattering , and ( @xmath402  mev / c ) for glauber screening . to enhance the effect of the final state interaction in both regions , the parameter @xmath79 ,",
    "characterizing the light cone momentum fraction of the nucleus carried by the recoiling nucleon should be close to one ( @xmath403 , where @xmath404 and @xmath405 are the energy and momentum of recoil nucleon in the final state ) .",
    "thus , the suggested experiment will measure the @xmath19-dependence of the following typical ratio at @xmath406 : @xmath407    figure  [ fig.ct_ratio ] shows this ratio , calculated within the generalized eikonal approximation  ( solid line ) , and using the quantum diffusion model of ct with upper and lower values of the expansion parameter @xmath388 .",
    "it is worth noting that in addition to the @xmath141 process , one can consider excitation of baryon resonances produced in the spectator kinematics , like @xmath408 and @xmath409 .",
    "the latter process is of special interest for looking for the effects of so - called chiral transparency  the disappearance of the pion field of the ejectile  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath410 and @xmath411 experiments described in the previous section are rather straightforward : they require a high - luminosity electron beam to access the very small cross sections at high-@xmath19 and a set of two medium - resolution magnetic spectrometers to determine , with reasonable precision , the recoil nucleon s momentum and the nucleon s binding energy .    in the case of the @xmath410 transparency measurements ,",
    "the nuclear recoil momentum is typically restricted to a momentum smaller than the fermi momentum @xmath412 ( @xmath413 250300 mev / c ) .",
    "the missing energy ( identical to the binding energy plus nuclear excitation energy ) is restricted to be well below pion production threshold ( @xmath413 100 mev ) .",
    "srcs within a nuclear system push a sizable amount of the individual nucleons to large momenta and binding energies . as",
    "precise , quantitative evidence of this effect remains elusive , it is preferable to restrict oneself to the region of single particle strength described by above cuts in recoil nucleon momentum and missing energy .    using two medium - resolution magnetic spectrometers , with momentum and angular resolutions of order 0.1% and 1 mr , one can easily make well - defined cuts in recoil nucleon momentum and missing energy . in the case of the @xmath411 cross section ratio measurement , a good determination of the recoil nucleon s momentum is a fundamental concern : the recoil nucleon momentum distribution drops steeply with missing momentum , even though the double rescattering mechanism partly counteracts this effect .",
    "this is illustrated by the absolute value of the cross section ratio in fig .",
    "[ fig.ct_ratio ] , @xmath413 0.1 , for recoil nucleon momenta of 400 mev / c with respect to 200 mev / c .",
    "moreover , at 200 mev / c the cross section varies with recoil nucleon momentum by about 30% per 10 mev / c .",
    "hence , an absolute comparison of the measured @xmath411 cross section ratio with calculations requires determination of the recoil nucleon momentum value with precision much smaller than 10 mev / c .",
    "the use of large non - magnetic devices , such as electromagnetic calorimeters , may be possible in limited cases , but will seriously affect the required missing momentum determination .",
    "thus , for the @xmath410 and @xmath411 examples shown in figs .",
    "[ fig.transparent ] and  [ fig.ct_ratio ] , two magnetic spectrometers operating at a luminosity of 1@xmath41410@xmath415 electron - atoms / cm@xmath21/s , with 3 and 6 msr solid angle , respectively , were assumed .",
    "the larger solid angle magnetic spectrometer would detect the quasi - elastically scattered electrons , the smaller solid - angle would map the ( relativistically boosted ) fermi cone . the latter magnetic spectrometer would need a momentum range between @xmath20  gev / c ( @xmath416 ( gev / c)@xmath21 ) and 10 gev / c ( @xmath19 @xmath413 17 ( gev / c)@xmath21 ) . missing energy and recoil nucleon momentum resolutions would still be better than 10 mev and 10 mev / c , respectively .",
    "lastly , the estimated beam time for the projected uncertainties in figs .  [ fig.transparent ] and  [ fig.ct_ratio ] would be less than one month of beam time for the @xmath164c@xmath417 transparency measurements , and one month of beam time for the d@xmath417 cross section ratio measurements up to @xmath19 = 12 ( gev / c)@xmath21 , with one additional month required to push these ratio measurements to @xmath19 = 14 ( gev / c)@xmath21 . for the cross section ratio measurements , one would need to determine the cross section yields at recoil nucleon s momenta of 200 and 400 mev / s with two separate angle settings of the magnetic spectrometer ( included in the estimated beam times ) . note that the @xmath411 measurements will build on the existing jefferson lab experiments@xcite at @xmath51  gev which plan to study the ratio @xmath310  ( eq.([rdouble ] ) ) up to @xmath19 of @xmath51  gev@xmath21 .",
    "although the main emphasis in color transparency studies is given to the experiments with nucleon electroproduction , it is widely expected that one should observe the onset of color coherence in meson electroproduction at lower values of @xmath19 than for the case of nucleon knockout .",
    "it should be easier to find the quark and anti - quark of a meson close together to form a point like configuration , than to find the three quarks of a nucleon together .",
    "the qcd factorization theorem@xcite for the exclusive meson production by the longitudinally polarized virtual photons demonstrates that the @xmath336 plcs dominate in the bjorken limit and that ct should occur both for the coherent and incoherent channels . in the leading twist",
    "the exclusive meson production can proceed through the quark - antiquark and , in case of vector mesons , also through the two gluon ladder exchange in t - channel@xcite . at small @xmath6 ( probed for example at hera@xcite )",
    "the two gluon ladder exchange dominates in the production of @xmath118 and @xmath418-mesons .",
    "however at jefferson lab kinematics , production of @xmath118 and @xmath418-mesons is dominated by the quark exchange @xcite .",
    "the latter is confirmed by the analysis of hermes data on @xmath419 reaction@xcite .",
    "additionally , the analyses of ref .  @xcite indicate that the leading twist approximation overestimates strongly ( by a factor @xmath420 for @xmath421 4 gev@xmath21 ) the @xmath118-meson production cross section . the suppression factor in leading approximation contribution",
    "is explained in refs.@xcite as a higher twist effect due to the finite transverse size of the photon wave function in the convolution integral involving the interaction block , virtual photon , and meson wave functions .",
    "however , the model analysis of @xcite indicates that the higher twist effects may not interfere with the transverse localization of the vector meson wave function leading to a possibility of the sizable ct effects already at @xmath4224 gev@xmath21 .",
    "the suppression of the leading twist contribution was observed by @xcite for the quark exchange channel for both vector meson and pion production .",
    "however the corresponding analysis of the transverse interquark distances is not yet available .",
    "studies of the ct for meson production with the jefferson lab upgrade will be very important for understanding of the onset of the leading twist contribution and determining what transverse separations are important in the higher twist contributions .",
    "an observation of ct for meson production would allow us to use these processes at pre  asymptotic @xmath19 for measuring the ratios of different nucleon generalized parton distributions . in the case of the vector meson production",
    "it is feasible to look for ct both in coherent and incoherent scattering off nuclei@xcite .",
    "studies of incoherent reactions require a very good energy resolution in the mass of the residual system to suppress processes where a meson is produced in the elementary reaction , processes like @xmath423 , as well as in a multi - step processes like @xmath424 .",
    "the first experiments looking for ct effects in the incoherent production of pions and @xmath118-mesons were recently approved at jefferson lab @xcite .    here",
    "we will focus on the reactions of the coherent meson production in which the background processes mentioned above are suppressed .",

    "the proposed upgrade of jefferson lab , which will provide high energy , high intensity , and high duty factor beams makes systematic studies of these reactions a very promising area of study .",
    "the most promising channel for studying color coherent effects with meson electroproduction is the coherent production of vector mesons off deuteron targets : @xmath425 where `` @xmath426 '' is the @xmath118 , @xmath418 or @xmath427 meson .",
    "this reaction is a unique channel for studying ct for the following reasons :    * due to the large _ photon - vector  meson _ coupling the cross section of the process is large , and at high energies and small @xmath19(@xmath428  gev@xmath21 ) is well understood in the framework of the vector meson dominance ( vmd ) model ; * the deuteron is the theoretically best understood nucleus .",

    "production processes , the longitudinal interaction length plays an important role and has a characteristic @xmath19-dependence(see e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath432    an important aspect of the measurements is the ability to separate the effects of a changing longitudinal interaction length from those of color coherence with an increase of @xmath19 .",
    "this can be achieved by keeping @xmath348 fixed in a @xmath19 scan of the coherent cross section at a wide range of momentum transfers @xmath346 .",
    "based on the above discussions one can identify a ct observable as the ratio of two differential cross sections at fixed @xmath348 but at different @xmath346 : one in the double scattering ( @xmath433 ) , and another in the screening ( @xmath434 ) regions , @xmath435    figure  [ tratio ] presents model calculation of the @xmath19-dependence of ratio @xmath310 for @xmath118 production for @xmath436 ( gev / c)@xmath21 and @xmath437 ( gev / c)@xmath21 . the upper curve is calculated without ct effect , within vmd with a finite longitudinal interaction length taken into account  @xcite .",
