    "our understanding of galaxy evolution has undergone a revolution in the past decade .",
    "of particular interest is the correlation that links the nuclear supermassive black holes ( smbh ) mass to the bulge stellar velocity dispersion , the @xmath6 relation @xcite . in this scenario , post - starburst quasars ( psqs )",
    "may acquire a great importance , since they seem to represent a critical phase in the secular evolution of galaxies that links the growth of the stellar bulge and that of the smbh .",
    "psqs are broad - lined agn that show balmer jumps and high - order balmer absorption lines from a stars characteristic of massive post - starburst populations with age of a few hundred myrs .",
    "psqs are hypothesized to represent a stage in the evolution of massive galaxies in which both star formation and nuclear activity have been triggered and are visible simultaneously before one or the other fades .",
    "@xcite reported the discovery of a spectacular psq that they propose to represent a stage in hierarchical galaxy evolution following a merger and enshrouded ultra luminous infrared galaxy ( ulirg ) phase .",
    "hst images have shown that the host galaxy is in fact a post - merger remnant , and its spectrum shows evidence for multiple stages of star - formation as might be expected through such a process @xcite .",
    "there are at least two possibilities to connect the presence of a post - starburst population and nuclear activity : ( 1 ) the flow of gas towards the nucleus first triggers star formation in the circumnuclear region and the nuclear activity is triggered after hundreds of myrs ; in the meantime , the star formation may cease due to exhaustion of the gas @xcite ; ( 2 ) the flow of gas towards the nucleus triggers star formation in the circumnuclear region and the nuclear activity , when triggered , quenches the star formation @xcite . in the first scenario ,",
    "the fueling of the black hole usually occurs with a delay of a few 100myrs after the beginning of the star formation  in order to explain the systematic excess of intermediate age stellar population contribution in agn hosts , although there are a few cases in which simultaneous on - going star formation and nuclear activity are observed @xcite . in the scenario proposed by @xcite the gas fueling the nuclear activity originates from winds of agb stars , which can be accreted more efficiently than the ejected mass by o and b stars and/or supernova . in these two versions of the first scenario ,",
    "the star formation ceases due to the exhaustion of gas , and the post - starburst population is distributed in the circumnuclear region extending even to the nucleus . in the quenching scenario ,",
    "the star formation occurring in the vicinity of the nucleus is abruptly interrupted due to feedback from the agn ( e.g. , nuclear outflows , radiation and jets ) .",
    "our proposition is that , in this case , the post - starburst population should be located in regions suffering the feedback effects ",
    "e.g. , over regions where a gaseous outflow is observed , which can be mapped via the gaseous kinematics . with the goal of investigating the nature of the connection between the post - starburst stellar population and nuclear activity in psqs",
    ", we began a program to map the stellar population and the manifestations of nuclear activity in the inner few kpc of psqs using integral field spectroscopy .",
    "in this paper we present the results obtained from observations of the psq sdss j021011.5 - 090335.5 ( hereafter psq j0210 - 0903 ) , selected for its proximity , at a distance of only 170mpc ( from ned , for @xmath7kmsec@xmath1mpc@xmath1 ) , allowing the study of the spatial distribution of its stellar population and gas emission characteristics . at this distance ,",
    "the scale at the psq is @xmath8 0.83kpcarcsec@xmath1 .",
    "the psq j0210 - 0903 is also one of the brightest psqs with @xmath90.1 , and its spectrum clearly reveals the presence of the balmer jump and high - order absorption lines of the balmer series .",
    "these absorption features are characteristic of the atmospheres of a stars , which dominate the absorption spectra of intermediate age ( @xmath10 yrs ) stellar populations ( or post - starburst galaxies ) .",
    "the psq j0210 - 0903 is hosted by a barred spiral galaxy with hubble type sa @xcite and its sdss petrosian absolute magnitude is @xmath11 .",
    "although this object is not as luminous as typical qsos ( e.g. , as those in * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) its absolute magnitude is close to the lower luminosity limit of qsos ( @xmath12 ; @xcite ) and its spectrum presents similar characteristics to other psqs .",
    "in addition , the downsizing issue @xcite makes the psqs with lower redshifts important probes of agn evolution .    this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : obs_reduc ] we describe the observations and reduction processes .",
    "in section [ sec : population ] we present the methodology and results of the stellar population analysis . in section [ sec : emitting ] we present the methodology of analysis of the gas emission and the gas emission - line flux distributions and ratios . in section [ sec : kinematics ] we report our results for the gas kinematics . in section [ sec : discussions ] we discuss and interpret our results as well as discuss the technique of principal component analysis to study the gas kinematics . in sections [ sec : mass ] and [ sec :",
    "outflowrate ] we present an estimate to the mass of the emitting gas and the mass outflow rate , respectively . in section [ sec : conclusions ] we present a summary of our results as well as our conclusions .        [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      the stellar population synthesis results are affected by the restrict wavelength range of our data , which excludes the near - uv region ( below 4200 )  the most sensitive to the intermediate age population .",
    "this limitation may have affected the absolute value of the contribution of this age component . in order to compensate for this ,",
    "we have restricted the population vector to only 3 stellar components ( young , intermediate age and old ) .",
    "the relative contribution of these different age components at the different locations seems to be robust , supported , for example , by the dominance of the young stellar population component in region 7 , for which the emission - line spectrum supports ionization by stars .    from the synthesis",
    ", we conclude that within the inner 0.3kpc the old population dominates the flux at 4700  ( @xmath860% ) , but that there is also some contribution of the intermediate age one ( @xmath830% ) .",
    "the gaseous kinematics has shown that the agn feedback is concentrated approximately within the inner 0.3kpc , coinciding with the region where the stellar population synthesis has revealed predominance of old population , but with some contribution of intermediate age population and fc . beyond this region , at the 0.8kpc ring , the young stellar population has a contribution ranging from @xmath040% to @xmath060% , reaching 100% at the detached region 7 , located in an spiral arm . in regions 4 , 5 and 6 , there is also significant contribution of the intermediate age population .",
    "we can represent the mixture of ages of the stellar population components in a more condensed form by its mean stellar age .",
    "following @xcite we can define the mean stellar age weighted by the light fraction as @xmath13 and by the stellar mass fraction as @xmath14 while the light - weighted mean stellar age is biased towards younger ages , as we can see in table [ tab : avgage ] , the mass - weighted stellar age is more representative of the older population ( which has a larger mass - to - light ratio ) .",
    "according to @xcite , although the latter is more physically representative , it has less relation with the observed spectrum .",
    "these authors argue that , in practice , @xmath15 is the most useful of the two indices , due to the large m / l ratio of old stars . in table",
    "[ tab : avgage ] we list these two mean ages for the integrated spectrum and for the regions @xmath16 . @xmath15 is indeed characteristic of a post - starburst population at most locations , where mean ages are smaller than 1gyr , except at the nucleus , where the mean age is larger than 3gyr .",
    "we have used integral field optical spectroscopy in order to map the stellar population and the gas kinematics within the inner 1.5kpc ( radius ) around the post - starburst quasar j0212 - 0903 at spatial resolution of @xmath00.5kpc ( 0.6 arcsec ) and velocity resolution of @xmath0120kms@xmath1 .",
    "this is the first two - dimensional study of both the stellar population and gas kinematics of a post - starburst quasar and our main conclusions are :    1 .",
    "the stellar population is dominated by old stars within 0.3kpc ( radius ) from the nucleus , while in the circumnuclear region both intermediate age ( 100myrs @xmath17 2.5ggyrs ) and young stars ( @xmath18myrs ) dominate the optical flux .",
    "our results support a location of most of the post - starburst population in a ring with radius of @xmath00.8kpc , where active star formation is also occurring ; 2 .   extended emission up to 1.5kpc from the nucleus",
    "is observed in both [ oiii ]  and h@xmath19 .",
    "the [ oiii ]  flux distribution is more centrally concentrated , while the h@xmath19 flux distribution is more extended approximately along the line of the nodes and is also observed in a detached patch which seems to belong to a spiral arm with active star formation ; 3 .",
    "the emission - line ratios are typical of seyfert excitation within the inner 0.3kpc , where an outflow is observed , while beyond this region the line ratios are typical of liners , which we attribute to a combination of diluted nuclear radiation and ionization by young stars .",
    "a principal component analysis ( pca ) supports the conclusion that recent star formation dominates the spectrum in the circumnuclear region ; 4 .",
    "the mass of ionized gas in the inner 1.25kpc ( radius ) is @xmath20 ; 5 .",
    "the gas kinematics can be reproduced by a combination of ( 1 ) rotation in the plane of the galaxy whose line of the nodes runs approximately north - south with amplitude @xmath21kms@xmath1 ( supported also by the pca ) and ( 2 ) an outflow observed within the inner 0.3kpc , with blueshifts reaching up to @xmath2kms@xmath1 ; 6 .",
    "the mass outflow rate is in the range of 0.3 - 1.1m@xmath22yr@xmath1 , which is @xmath23 times the agn mass accretion rate of @xmath24yr@xmath1 , implying that most of the outflow originates via mass - loading in the surrounding interstellar medium of the galaxy , swept away by the agn outflow .",
    "we conclude that our observations support both the evolutionary and quenching scenario for this galaxy , as follows .",
    "the feeding of gas to the nuclear region has triggered a circumnuclear starburst a few 100smyr ago , extending all the way to the nucleus .",
    "the remaining gas from this inflow , combined with the mass loss from the newly formed stars may have then triggered the nuclear activity , producing the observed gas outflow .",
    "this outflow , observed within the inner 0.3kpc , has then quenched further star formation at this location , in agreement with the observed absence of young stars and the contribution of intermediate age stars in the inner 0.3kpc . beyond this region",
    "affected by the outflow , star - formation seems to be still active in a 0.8kpc ring .",
    "the presence of a delay between the triggering of star formation and the nuclear activity is supported by the presence of the intermediate age stellar population at the nucleus .",
