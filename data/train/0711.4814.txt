    "_ in situ _ solar wind plasma observations over the last 30 years show that its local properties at 1 a.u .",
    "are modulated by the solar cycle @xcite and that this has an impact on the magnetosphere and ionosphere @xcite .",
    "there is evidence for more mixing of fast and slow solar wind plasma at solar maximum @xcite and changing magnetic for complexity over the cycle @xcite @xcite .",
    "one method for quantifying the effect of solar activity on the solar wind is to determine the correlation length scale of fluctuations measured _ in - situ_. in the past this was done using the taylor hypothesis @xcite and long timeseries from single spacecraft ( e.g. bruno _ et al _ @xcite ) .",
    "more recently , multiple spacecraft studies @xcite have used linear correlation to calculate a typical correlation length for magnetic field in the solar wind .",
    "the ace and wind spacecraft give an excellent range of separations and enable long baseline correlations to be calculated for magnetic field vector * b * and magnitude @xmath2 as well as solar wind bulk velocity and density @xmath1 .",
    "these observations have been used to show anisotropy in the solar wind @xcite and measure the taylor microscale @xcite .",
    "quantitative knowledge of the spatial correlation of the fluctuations of the flow is relevant to attempts to understand the solar wind in terms of locally evolving turbulence @xcite @xcite .",
    "it also has implications for cosmic ray propagation @xcite @xcite which shows solar cycle dependence @xcite .",
    "previous studies used linear correlation measures and did not investigate solar cycle effects on the measurements of correlation length . here",
    "we use a nonlinear measure of correlation , mutual information @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite , alongside linear correlation coefficient .",
    "we calculate correlation lengths for the components of @xmath8 , as well as @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "we also investigate the behaviour of the correlation length of these quantities over the recent solar cycle , using ace and wind spacecraft data .",
    "we use two methods for estimating correlation : correlation coefficient as a linear measure , and normalised mutual information as a nonlinear measure .",
    "the linear cross covariance provides a measure of correlation between two signals @xmath9 and @xmath10 , defined by :    @xmath11}{\\sqrt{e[(a - \\overline{a})^2 ] e[(b - \\overline{b})^2 ] } } \\label{eq : xcor}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath12 $ ] denotes the mathematical expectation value and @xmath13 $ ] .",
    "mutual information ( mi ) quantifies the information content shared by two signals @xmath9 and @xmath10 . for discrete signals",
    "we can write the mi as :    @xmath14    here the signals @xmath9 and @xmath10 have been partitioned into an alphabet ( an exhaustive discrete set which spans the possible values the signal can take ) so that @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the extrema of @xmath9 found in all data considered .",
    "the discretised signal takes value @xmath18 with probability @xmath19 and similarly for @xmath20 we have @xmath21 , while @xmath22 is the joint probability of @xmath18 and @xmath23 .",
    "the chosen base of the logarithm defines the units in which the mi is measured .",
    "normally base 2 is used , so that the mi is measured in bits .",
    "if one defines the entropy of a signal as @xmath24 then mi can be written as a combination of entropies @xcite    @xmath25    the calculation of the entropies needed to form the mi is not trivial , as there is some freedom in the method of discretisation of the signals and in the method used to estimate the probabilities @xmath19 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "there are many different methods currently used , summarised and compared by cellucci _",
    "_ @xcite and kraskov _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite . for spacecraft observations of the solar wind",
    ", we use a discretisation based on the standard deviation @xmath28 of the data . only data within @xmath29 of the mean",
    "is considered and bins of @xmath30 are used , giving @xmath31 bins in total . the form of mi used here is the normalised mutual information ( nmi ) @xcite , which is @xmath32 normalised by the joint entropy @xmath33 so as to remove the dependence on the entropy of the solar wind at the time of observation : @xmath34 this gives results in the range @xmath35 facilitating direct comparison between different periods of data .",
    "to investigate the effect of the solar cycle on spatial correlation in the solar wind we take data from periods as near to solar activity minimum as possible , that is in 1998 , 2005 and 2006 , and from solar maximum in 2000 . in 1998",
    "wind was returning towards earth from the sun - earth libration point while ace orbited the libration point ; in 2005 and 2006 both ace and wind orbit the libration point .",
    "17 periods of data were chosen with different spacecraft separations , giving a total of 48 days of data . at solar maximum in 2000",
    "wind is orbiting the earth and therefore only short periods , when the spacecraft is suitably far from the magnetopause and bow shock , can be used .",
    "four such periods were used giving a total of 15 days of data .",
    "two minute cadence data are used for all variables .",
    "we use two different lengths @xmath36 for our measurement window to optimise for the two distinct timescales in the power spectrum .",
    "we choose @xmath37 minutes to investigate the large scale structures and @xmath38 minutes to access the inertial range of turbulence in the solar wind .",
    "a shorter window can not be used as the data in the window then becomes too short for a reliable correlation estimate to be made .",
    "nmi ( [ eq : nmi ] ) and correlation coefficient ( [ eq : xcor ] ) are calculated for windows @xmath39 and @xmath40 as they are moved along the data . a value for nmi and correlation coefficient is thus obtained every two minutes for each window length , 24 hour averages are calculated and plotted against separation in figures [ fig : figure1 ] to [ fig : figure4 ] .",
    "figure [ fig : figure1 ] plots linear correlation and nmi versus spacecraft separation for @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath8 components at solar minimum using @xmath40 .",
    "following @xcite we fit an exponential function @xmath41 to the data using nonlinear least squares , with @xmath42 for correlation coefficient .",
    "the values of @xmath0 calculated are shown in table [ table : table1 ] .",
    "the quality of the fit is indicated by the error on the correlation length , calculated as the @xmath43 confidence bound of the nonlinear least squares fit .",
    "the errors on these values arise primarily from the scatter of the measurements due to the highly variable nature of the solar wind .",

    "those values marked with @xmath45 are fits that resulted in an @xmath46 value of less than @xmath47 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we anticipate the spatial variation of correlation coefficient to be of exponential form .",
    "however nmi , which is a nonlinear measure , may have more complex behaviour ; an exponential function provides a simple parameterisation of the data .",
    "the nmi gives @xmath1 a longer correlation length than @xmath2 , whereas the correlation coefficient gives the reverse .",
    "both give a lower correlation for @xmath1 than @xmath2 .",
    "if both @xmath1 and @xmath2 nmi fits are set to have the same intercept then the nmi gives similar results to those found with the cross corelation , however as exact form of the nmi dependence on separation is unknown these correlation lengths remain a local estimate .",
    "table [ table : table1 ] also shows that at minimum the _ y _ and _ z _ components of @xmath8 have similar correlation lengths to each other and @xmath2 .",
    "the scatter on the correlation calculated for the components of @xmath8 and @xmath2 is larger than for @xmath1 .",
    "the correlation coefficient gives a clearer decay and the estimates of correlation length are correspondingly more accurate .     and @xmath1 for window length @xmath37 minutes , for selected periods in 1998 , 2005 and 2006 ( solar minimum : ( @xmath44 ) and solid line ) and 2000 ( solar maximum : ( + ) and dashed line ) .",

    "the lines plotted are inverse exponential fits to the data , width=340 ]    we now consider variation with solar cycle .",
    "figure [ fig : figure2 ] plots linear correlation coefficient and nmi against spacecraft separation for @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "it shows that both the linear and the nonlinear measure of correlation yield a higher spatial correlation in both @xmath1 and @xmath2 at solar maximum . to quantify this we again fit an exponential of the form @xmath41 , with @xmath42",
    "this provides a reasonable fit in all cases except for the nmi at solar maximum for @xmath1 , which also shows the largest scatter .",
    "the calculated values of correlation length @xmath0 are shown in table [ table : table1 ] .",
    "we see that the correlation length measured at solar minimum is systematically smaller than that at maximum .",
    "the value at maximum for @xmath2 is within error of previous estimates for the same interval @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : figure3 ] shows the spatial correlation of components of @xmath8 .",
    "the points from solar maximum and minimum do not show distinct behaviour , unlike @xmath1 and @xmath2 in figure [ fig : figure2 ] . fitting an exponential function to the data , as before ,",
    "yields the values of the correlation lengths for the components of @xmath8 shown in table [ table : table1 ] .",
    "the @xmath49 and @xmath48 values of @xmath50 and @xmath51 are within error of each other , and are distinct from the values for @xmath2 and @xmath1 .     and @xmath1 measurements at solar minimum in 1998 , 2005 and 2006 ( top panels ) and solar maximum in 2000 ( bottom panels ) .",
    "the ( @xmath44 ) and solid line fits correspond to @xmath37 min and the ( + ) and dashed line fits correspond to @xmath38 min .",
    "the lines are inverse exponential fits to the data.,width=340 ]    finally , figure [ fig : figure4 ] gives a comparison between the measured correlation coefficient from the two different time windows , @xmath37 minutes and @xmath38 minutes .",
    "the shorter window is within the inertial range of solar wind turbulence ; it gives slightly smaller values for the correlation length ( @xmath52 , @xmath53 ) than the longer time window ( @xmath54 , @xmath55 ) .",
    "this difference is more obvious at solar maximum where the correlation lengths measured by the smaller window are @xmath56 for @xmath2 and @xmath57 for @xmath1 ; compared to @xmath58 and @xmath59 using the longer window @xmath40 .",
    "large coherent structures within the solar wind may contribute to the change in correlation length seen on timescales @xmath40 above the inertial range value @xmath39 ; however the difference is not large .",
    "we have used simultaneous data from the ace and wind spacecraft separated by between @xmath60 and @xmath61 , to calculate the spatial correlation of solar wind @xmath1 , @xmath2 and * b * components .",
    "cross correlation and normalised mutual information were used as alternative linear and nonlinear measures of correlation . at",
    "solar minimum we have @xmath62 days of contemporaneous wind and ace observations .",
    "we determine the correlation lengthscale @xmath63 for @xmath1 to be @xmath64 . this is smaller than @xmath65 by @xmath66 1.6 .",
    "for the components of * b * , we find @xmath67 is within error of @xmath65 and @xmath68 is slightly above the range of errors .    at solar maximum we have @xmath69 days of contemporaneous wind and ace data .",
    "this allows us to investigate the effect of the solar cycle .",
    "we find that @xmath65 and @xmath63 at solar maximum are larger than at minimum by @xmath66 a factor of @xmath70 .",
    "in contrast the components of the magnetic field show weak variation with solar cycle .",
    "we have used two window lengths ; one within the inertial range ( @xmath71 min ) and the other on longer timescales ( @xmath72 min).the window on inertial range timescales gives values of @xmath0 , that are systematically shorter , but within the errors , of the values from the larger window .",
    "the solar cycle dependence of the correlation length is in all cases independent of our chosen window sizes .",
    "our result that @xmath1 and @xmath2 show variation with solar cycle , whereas the components of * b * do not , is consistent with the idea that the correlation in @xmath2 and @xmath1 is , at least in part , of solar origin .",
    "intriguingly this behaviour persists when we restrict our analysis to timescales within the inertial range .",
    "this is consistent with recent single - spacecraft results @xcite @xcite which show solar cycle dependence within the inertial range of magnetic energy density fluctuations .",
