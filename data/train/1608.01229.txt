    "it has been a century since edward @xcite first observed strong emission lines originating in the nucleus of ngc1068 and discovered the first active galactic nucleus ( agn ) . yet it is only in the last 30 years that agns have become synonymous with supermassive black holes ( e.g. , @xcite ) and that supermassive black holes have become synonymous with galaxy nuclei ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "multiple independent lines of study focusing on a zoo of seemingly unrelated characteristics across the entire spectral energy distribution are now unified through our current understanding of the agn phenomenon ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the mass and the spin of the black hole , its only quantifiable characteristics , are two key parameters in our understanding of not only agn physics ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but also galaxy evolution ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "astrophysical black holes can be characterized by their mass and spin , and being able to constrain both properties is rare .",
    "mcg-06 - 30 - 15 is one of only a handful of x - ray bright agns where its fe k@xmath9 emission may be studied in detail , allowing a measure of the black hole spin .",
    "tanaka et al . ( 1995 ) first detected a broad red wing of the fe k@xmath9 emission line , as is expected due to the strong gravitational redshift and relativistic doppler effects from material in the innermost accretion disk .",
    "relativistic reflection models fit to the x - ray spectrum , including the fe k@xmath9 line , all indicate that the black hole spin is high , with a dimensionless spin parameter @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "while the spin has been constrained for a decade now , the black hole mass of mcg-06 - 30 - 15 is less well known .",
    "previous estimates of the mass have relied upon scaling relationships such as the x - ray power spectral density break ( @xmath11m@xmath3 ; @xcite ) or the @xmath6  relationship ( @xmath12m@xmath3 ; @xcite ) .",
    "high spatial resolution integral field spectroscopy of the inner @xmath13kpc of the galaxy allowed @xcite to determine an upper limit on the black hole mass of @xmath14m@xmath3 , but the integration time was somewhat shallow and precluded a stronger mass constraint .",
    "reverberation mapping @xcite is often employed for determining the black hole masses of agns of interest .",
    "unlike dynamical modeling , which is limited by spatial resolution and therefore distance , reverberation mapping is applicable to all broad - lined agns regardless of location .",
    "the method makes use of the spectral variability of agns and determines the time delay between variations in the continuum emission ( likely emitted from the accretion disk ) and the response to these variations in the broad emission lines ( emitted from the broad line region , blr ) .",
    "the time delay is simply the responsivity - weighted average of the light travel time from the accretion disk to all of the blr `` clouds '' , and is generally interpreted as a measure of the average radius of the blr for a specific emission species . in this case , the limiting resolution is temporal rather than spatial , and regions on the order of microarcseconds in size are routinely investigated ( e.g. , @xcite ) . the time delay combined with a measure of the velocity of the gas provides a constraint on the black hole mass through the virial theorem , modulo a scaling factor that accounts for the detailed geometry and kinematics of the line - emitting gas .",
    "the requirements of dense temporal sampling and long monitoring baselines have generally limited reverberation campaigns to 1.0 - 4.0 m class telescopes in the past , and these have generally been located in the northern hemisphere . at a declination of @xmath15 , mcg-06 - 30 - 15 has not been an ideal target for a reverberation campaign . nevertheless , it was included in the set of agns monitored from lick observatory as part of the lamp 2008 program @xcite , but no time delays were detected due to the low level of variability of the source throughout the campaign combined with the non - optimal conditions under which it was observed each night ( airmass @xmath16 ) .",
    "we describe here the results of a reverberation - mapping campaign for mcg-06 - 30 - 15 anchored by spectroscopy from the smarts 1.5-m telescope at cerro tololo interamerican observatory ( ctio ) .",
    "the variability of the target was somewhat increased during the monitoring period , compared to the 2008 campaign , and coupled with better data quality , we are able to determine a time delay for the broad h@xmath0 emission line and a constraint on the black hole mass .    throughout this paper ,",
    "we adopt a @xmath17cdm cosmology of @xmath18kms@xmath19mpc@xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 .",
    "for the monitoring campaign presented here , observations were carried out during spring 2012 with spectroscopy obtained at ctio ( latitude@xmath22 ) , and photometry obtained at siding spring observatory ( latitude@xmath23 ) and at the observatorio del roque de los muchachos at la palma ( latitude@xmath24 ) .",
    "the details of each are described below .      for reverberation mapping campaigns , photometric monitoring can provide a higher signal - to - noise ratio and better calibrated light curve of continuum variations than measurements taken directly from the spectra ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in the cases of the @xmath25 and @xmath26 bands , especially , the contribution of broad - line emission to the bandpass is small compared to the continuum ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we therefore carried out broad - band @xmath25 and @xmath26 photometric monitoring at two sites to better constrain the continuum variations throughout our campaign : the 2-m faulkes telescope south ( fts ) at siding spring observatory and the 2-m liverpool telescope ( lt ) at the observatorio del roque de los muchachos on la palma in the canary islands .",
    "monitoring at fts began on 4 february and continued through 26 may 2012 with the spectral camera ( ut dates here and throughout ) .",
    "observations were obtained on 42 nights and generally consisted of @xmath27s exposures in @xmath25 and @xmath28s exposures in @xmath26 at an average airmass of 1.3 .",
    "the field - of - view for the images was 105@xmath29105 with a pixel scale of 0.304  in @xmath30 binning mode .",
    "monitoring at lt utilized the ratcam and was carried out from 20 february through 29 may 2012 .",
    "observations were obtained on 42 nights at a typical airmass of 2.27 . because of",
    "the higher expected airmass for these observations based on the latitude of the observatory relative to the declination of the target , longer exposure times of @xmath31s were utilized in @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the field of view for ratcam is 46@xmath2946 , with a pixel scale of 028 in @xmath30 binning mode .",
    "both imaging datasets were analyzed through image subtraction methods in order to accurately constrain the nuclear variability of the galaxy .",
    "images from a single observatory and a single filter were registered to a common alignment using the sexterp routine @xcite .",
    "we then employed the isis image subtraction package @xcite to build a reference image ( figure  [ fig : refims ] ) from the subset of images taken under the best conditions .",
    "the reference frame was convolved with a spatially - varying kernel to match each individual image in the dataset .",
    "subtraction of the convolved reference from each image produces a residual image in which the components that are constant in flux have disappeared and only variable sources remain .",
    "aperture photometry was then employed on the residual images to measure the amount of variable flux for the agn .",
    "analysis of these resultant light curves demonstrated that the @xmath32band light curves exhibit the same features as the @xmath33band light curves , but with less noise .",
    "we therefore focus our remaining analysis on the @xmath32band light curves from our photometric monitoring .",
    "spectroscopic monitoring was carried out with rcspec on the smarts 1.5-m telescope at ctio .",
    "observations were scheduled to be carried out in queue - observing mode every other night during the period 1 march @xmath34 31 may 2012 .",
    "the spectrograph was equipped with the 600l / mm blue grating ( known as grating 26 ) , giving a wavelength coverage of @xmath35  and a nominal resolution of 1.5pix@xmath19 in the dispersion direction .",
    "spectra were obtained through a 4  slit at a fixed position angle of 90  ( i.e. , oriented east - west ) .",
    "the rcspec detector , a loral 1k ccd , provides a spatial resolution of 13pix@xmath19 .    over the course of the campaign , spectra were obtained on 36 nights .",
    "each visit consisted of two spectra with exposure times of 900s that were obtained at an average airmass of 1.08 . a spectrophotometric flux standard , ltt4364 , was also observed during each visit to assist with flux calibrations .",
    "standard reductions were carried out with iraf and an extraction width of 8pixels ( 104 ) was adopted .",
    "the initial flux calibration provided by the standard star is generally a good correction for the shape of the spectra , providing a useful way to remove the effects of the atmospheric transmission as well as the optics of the telescope and instrument .",
    "however , reverberation campaigns require high temporal sampling and therefore acquire spectra on all nights when the telescope may be safely used , often times under non - photometric conditions .",
    "we therefore require a method for carefully calibrating the overall flux level of each spectrum .",
    "this is generally accomplished by using the narrow emission lines as `` internal '' flux calibration sources , as the narrow lines do not vary on the timescales of a reverberation campaign . specifically",
    ", we employ the @xcite spectral scaling method with the [ ] @xmath364959,5007 emission lines as our internal calibration sources .",
    "the method minimizes the differences in a selected wavelength range between each individual spectrum and a reference spectrum created from a subset of the best data .",
    "it is therefore able to correct for slight differences in wavelength calibration , slight resolution differences ( caused by variable seeing and the employment of a wide spectroscopic slit ) , as well as flux calibration differences . @xcite",
    "have shown that this method is able to provide relative spectrophotometry that is accurate to @xmath37% . to ensure the accuracy of our absolute spectrophotometry , we compared the integrated [ ] @xmath38 flux to published values determined from high quality spectra observed under good conditions .",
    "we adopted a value of @xmath39[]@xmath40ergs@xmath19@xmath41 , in good agreement with @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the red lines in figure  [ fig : meanspec ] show the mean of all the calibrated spectra throughout the campaign ( _ top _ ) and the root mean square of the spectra ( _ bottom _ ) , which highlights variable spectral components .",
    "it is immediately obvious that the variable ( rms ) spectrum is swamped by some combination of host - galaxy light , possibly from mis - centering of the slit and poor seeing conditions , as well as scattered light from a nearby milky way star along the line of sight ( 54 south of the nucleus and superimposed on the galaxy disk ) .",
    "we therefore investigated a method for carefully subtracting the continuum of each spectrum , both the agn powerlaw and the starlight , through spectral modeling .",
    "we employed the publicly - available ulyss package @xcite , which creates a linear combination of non - linear model components convolved with a parametric line - of - sight velocity to match an observed spectrum .",
    "our method started with modeling the very high signal - to - noise mean spectrum .",
    "we included a powerlaw component for the agn continuum emission , multiple gaussians for the emission lines ( three components were necessary to match the h@xmath0 profile ) , and a host - galaxy component parametrized by the vazdekis models derived from the miles library of empirical stellar spectra @xcite .",
    "we make no attempt to interpret the best - fit parameters of our model , as our goal was simply to separate the line emission from the continuum components as cleanly as possible .",
    "we then held the number of model components and the age and metallicity of the best - fit vazdekis model fixed , but allowed all other parameters to vary as we looped through all of the individual spectra of mcg-06 - 30 - 15 . in this way , we allow for variation of the powerlaw index , the relative contribution of powerlaw versus host - galaxy starlight , and emission line flux variability .",
    "furthermore , we modeled the agn spectra that had an initial flux calibration from a spectrophotometric standard star but had not yet been scaled with the @xcite code in order to get the best match between the models and the `` untouched '' observed spectra . the best - fit powerlaw and host - galaxy models were subtracted from each spectrum , providing a set of continuum subtracted , pure emission - line spectra . in figure",
    "[ fig : galsub ] , we show a typical example of a single spectrum , the best - fit continuum model ( powerlaw + starlight ) , and the resultant continuum - subtracted spectrum .",
    "after modeling and subtraction of the continuum , all the spectra were then scaled with the @xcite method in the same way as previously described .",
    "the mean and rms of the scaled , continuum - subtracted spectra are displayed by the black lines in figure  [ fig : meanspec ] .",
    "the h@xmath0 emission line , though weak , is apparent in the continuum - subtracted rms spectrum .",

    "emission - line light curves were determined from both the original , scaled spectra as well as the continuum - subtracted , scaled spectra , in order to verify that our continuum subtraction method did not introduce artificial variability . in both cases ,",

    "the broad emission lines in agn spectra are interpreted as being doppler broadened through the bulk gas motions deep in the potential well of the black hole . therefore , the width of the broad line is a constraint on the line - of - sight velocity of the gas .",
    "the narrow emission lines , however , are produced by gas that is well outside the nucleus of the agn and does not reverberate on the time scales of a few months .",
    "it is therefore important that we remove the narrow contribution to the h@xmath0 emission line before attempting to measure the line width .",
    "we accomplish this by using the [ ] @xmath1895007 emission line as a template for the narrow emission lines in the spectrum . the template is shifted and scaled by an appropriate amount to account for both the [ ] @xmath1894959 line and the h@xmath0 narrow line .",

    "a local linear continuum was determined from two continuum windows on either side of the emission line , and the width was determined directly from the measurements above this local continuum .",
    "we report the line width as the full width at half the maximum flux ( fwhm ) and also as the second moment of the line profile , or the line dispersion , @xmath192 .",
    "the uncertainties on the line width measurements were determined from a monte carlo random subset sampling method . for a set of @xmath168 spectra , we select @xmath168 without regard to whether a spectrum was previously chosen or not . the mean and rms of this subset are determined , and the fwhm and @xmath192 are tabulated .",
    "the process is repeated 1000 times , and a distribution of each measurement is built up . in this way , the effect of any particular spectrum on the line width measurements is assessed .",
    "we also included a slight modification in which the continuum windows on either side of the emission line were allowed to vary in size and exact placement within an acceptable range , thereby assessing the effect of the continuum window choice on the final measurements .",
    "this modification generally has little or no effect on the line widths derived from the rms spectrum , where noise already dominates the uncertainties , but slightly increases the uncertainties on the line widths derived from the mean spectrum @xcite .",
    "the mean and standard deviation of each distribution are adopted as the measurement value and its uncertainty , respectively .",
    "finally , we also corrected for the dispersion of the spectrograph following the method employed by @xcite , in which the observed line width can be described as a combination of the intrinsic line width , @xmath193 , and the spectrograph dispersion , @xmath194 , such that @xmath195 in this case , it is not possible to measure @xmath196 from sky lines or arc lamps employed for wavelength calibration , because in both of those cases , the source fills the entire slit .",
    "however , the angular size of the unresolved agn point source is set by the seeing , which varies throughout the campaign but is almost always smaller than the 5  width of the slit",
    ". our typical approach is to therefore search the literature for very high resolution measurements of the width of the [ ] lines , to serve as a measurement of @xmath193 , allowing @xmath194 to be determined .",
    "such measurements do not exist for mcg-06 - 30 - 15 , but they do exist for ngc1566 , another seyfert galaxy that we have monitored with the same instrument and setup .    for ngc1566 , @xcite measured @xmath197kms@xmath19 for [ ] @xmath38 through a small slit , with a high resolution , and under good observing conditions . from our own spectra of ngc1566 taken with rcspec on the smarts 1.5-m telescope , we determined @xmath198  for [ ] @xmath38 .",
    "we therefore deduce a value of @xmath199  and adopt this value for our observations of mcg-06 - 30 - 15 . the final dispersion - corrected line widths and uncertainties",
    "for the mean and rms h@xmath0 broad line profiles are tabulated in table  [ tab : lagwidth ] .",
    "the black hole mass is generally derived from reverberation - mapping measurements as @xmath200 where @xmath201 is taken to be @xmath202 , the speed of light times the mean time delay of a broad emission line relative to continuum variations , @xmath26 is the line - of - sight velocity of the gas in the broad line region and is determined from the emission line width , and @xmath203 is the gravitational constant .",
    "the factor @xmath204 is a scaling factor that accounts for the detailed geometry and kinematics of the gas in the broad line region , which is generally unknown . in practice ,",
    "it has become common to determine the population average multiplicative factor , @xmath205 , necessary to bring the @xmath6  relationship for agns with reverberation masses into agreement with the @xmath6  relationship for nearby galaxies with dynamical black hole masses ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in this way",
    ", the overall scale for reverberation masses should be unbiased , but the mass of any single agn is expected to be uncertain by a factor of 2 - 3 . the value of @xmath205 has varied in the literature from 5.5 @xcite to 2.8 @xcite , depending on which objects are included and the specifics of the measurements .",
    "we adopt the value determined by @xcite of @xmath206 .",
    "our preferred combination of measurements is @xmath166 for the time delay and @xmath192 measured from the rms spectrum for the line width .",

    "describe a long - term monitoring campaign in x - ray , optical , and near - ir bands from which several broad - band time delays were measured .",
    "in particular , they find that the near - ir bands lag the @xmath25 and @xmath26 bands by 13 , 20 , and 26days in @xmath209 , @xmath210 , and @xmath211 respectively .",
    "while our monitoring campaign was not contemporaneous with that described by @xcite , it was carried out the following observing season .",
    "furthermore , @xcite find that the luminosity state of mcg-06 - 30 - 15 did not change significantly over the period between 2001 and 2013 , and the light curve from the swift / bat hard x - ray transient monitor shows no luminosity state changes between 2005 and 2015 @xcite .",
    "comparison of our measured h@xmath0 time delay of @xmath212days to the near - ir delays places the inner edge of the dust torus outside the blr , as has been found for other seyferts @xcite .",
    "furthermore , our h@xmath0 time delay compares remarkably well with the findings of @xcite that @xmath213 .",
    "these findings are also in keeping with the scenario proposed by @xcite in which the dust torus creates the outer edge of the blr through suppression of line emission by the dust grains .",
    "the empirical relationship between the agn blr radius and the agn optical luminosity @xcite is a well - known scaling relationship derived from the set of reverberation mapping measurements for relatively nearby agns .",
    "the calibrated relationship relies on h@xmath0 reverberation results and measurements of the continuum luminosity at 5100 , and it provides a quick way to estimate black hole masses without investing in time- and resource - intensive reverberation mapping programs for every target of interest .",
    "the @xmath4@xmath5  relationship has been found to be in good agreement with simple expectations from photoionization physics , once the luminosity measurements were corrected for the host - galaxy starlight contribution measured through the reverberation - mapping spectroscopic aperture @xcite .",
    "the scatter has also been found to be quite low , @xmath214dex @xcite , implying that agns are mostly luminosity - scaled versions of each other .",
    "starlight corrections are especially important for nearby agns , like mcg-06 - 30 - 15 , because they can provide a significant fraction of the flux through the reverberation - mapping spectroscopic aperture .",
    "these corrections are generally obtained through two - dimensional surface brightness modeling of high - resolution agn host galaxy images .",
    "the decomposition allows the agn psf to be accurately separated from the host - galaxy and the underlying sky , and thus an `` agn free '' image can be recovered from which the starlight flux can be measured .",
    "mcg-06 - 30 - 15 was observed with _ hst _  and the uvis channel of wfc3 through the f547 m filter as part of program go-11662 to image the host galaxies of the lamp 2008 agn sample @xcite .",
    "a single orbit was split into two pointings separated by a small angle maneuver , and at each pointing a set of three exposures was taken , each exposure graduated in exposure time ( short , medium , and long ) .",
    "the saturated pixels in the agn core in the long exposures are corrected by scaling up the same pixels from the shorter , unsaturated exposures by the ratio of the exposure times . in this way , the graduated exposure times allow the dynamic range of the final drizzled image to significantly exceed the dynamic range of the detector itself .",
    "the total exposure time of the final combined , drizzled image is 2290s .",

    "a single fourier mode ( @xmath215 ) was also allowed for each of these components , to account for gross perturbations on the initial parametric models .",

    "their work assumed a linear scaling between @xmath230  and the x - ray power spectral density break , with the relationship anchored to the measurements for the galactic black hole cygnus x-1 .",
    "this agreement therefore bolsters the claim that supermassive black holes are simply analogs of galactic black holes , but scaled up in mass ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite describe vlt sinfoni integral field spectroscopic observations of the innermost @xmath8kpc of the galaxy in the @xmath210 band .",

    "intriguingly , they find a best - fit value of @xmath231m@xmath3 ( assuming @xmath232mpc ) , although they caution that there is actually a stronger constraint on an upper limit of @xmath233m@xmath3 than on the best - fit mass .",
    "one of our original reasons for targeting mcg-06 - 30 - 15 included the fact that it might be possible to determine a black hole mass through both reverberation mapping and stellar dynamical modeling for this nearby agn .",
    "the sample of objects for which we are able to compare these two mass determination methods is extremely small for two reasons : ( 1 ) stellar dynamical modeling is limited by spatial resolution , and therefore distance ; and ( 2 ) broad - lined agns in the local universe are quite rare , and therefore generally far away .",
    "only two galaxies have published masses from both methods thus far  ngc4151 @xcite and ngc3227 @xcite .",
    "a useful metric for determining whether a stellar dynamical mass is likely to be achievable is to determine whether the black hole sphere of influence ( @xmath234 ) could be resolved with the observations , where @xmath235 combining our mass with the value of @xmath236kms@xmath19 determined by @xcite and the distance of 25.5mpc adopted above , we estimate @xmath237 .",
