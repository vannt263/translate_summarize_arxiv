    "soon after the discovery of high temperature superconductivity it has been established [ 1 - 3 ] that in ceramic samples of @xmath0 there exists a  large nonresonant microwave absorption in zero and low applied magnetic field that can be associated with the transition to the superconducting phase . an exemplary field dependence of this absorption is displayed in @xcite .",
    "a broad absorption structure is modulated by a noisy signal with a clear evidence of a quasiperiodic substructure .",
    "one can also observe nonlinear phenomena , e.g. a generation of odd harmonics in zero applied field and of even harmonics in nonzero field @xcite .",
    "= 0.8    the experimental setup used to measure the spectrum depicted in is an epr spectrometer , which provides the magnetic resonance response due to @xmath1 ions in the normal phase in the field range @xmath2 .",
    "the lower field signal has a reversed phase with respect to the usual ( lorentzian ) epr line .",
    "therefore , this low - field absorption has been attributed to the power loss in current loops connected by the dissipative josephson junctions , which in turn are created between the grains in a ceramic sample .",
    "actually , such junctions appear also in the monocrystaline sample @xcite , although their presence in good quality untwinned monocrystalline samples should be associated with the cooper - pair tunneling along the @xmath3-axis .    because of the potential application of ceramic high temperature superconductors in various microwave applications , it is important to study the properties of a general three - dimensional array of josephson junctions shunted by resistance ( @xmath4 ) , capacitance ( @xmath5 ) , and with inductance ( @xmath6 ) , together with inclusion of some random variations of the junction parameters .",
    "such model can be called the disordered _ rlc - sjj _ model @xcite . for that purpose",
    "we consider a lattice depicted in , where @xmath7 labels the phase difference in the direction @xmath8 , and @xmath9 locate the junction position in the three - dimensional array .",
    "this model was considered in various simplified situations by a number of authors @xcite .",
    "here we consider a 3-dimensional granular structure and disregard the circumstance that the grains themselves may have a coupled josephson structure along the @xmath3-axis , perpendicular to the @xmath10 planes @xcite .",
    "in other words , the intergranular critical currents are assumed to be much smaller than their intragranular counterpart .",
    "this should allow us to address the question about role of the josephson network in causing the hysteresis when cycling slowly the applied field , as well as the question of the existence of a residual contribution in the zero field .",
    "we start from the gauge invariant phase @xmath11 between points @xmath12 and @xmath13 : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the gradient of the phase of macroscopic wave function , @xmath16 in the vector potential , and the integration takes place between the two sides of the junction with the sign convention in accordance with the coordinate directions shown in . taking into account the single valuedness of the wave function , the stokes theorem for the elementary loop",
    ", we obtain the relation between e.  g. the magnetic flux piercing the loop in @xmath17 plane and the phase differences on the josephson junctions composing the loop in the form : @xmath18 for the sake of convenience we label the loops currents @xmath19 in the same manner as the fluxes @xmath20 , as shown explicitly in .",
    "= 0.8    = 0.8    introducing reduced quantities @xmath21 , and @xmath22 we can write down the relation for each plane @xmath23 with the replacement @xmath24 and @xmath25 , so that : @xmath26 the cyclic properties of these relations are easy to grasp .",
    "the @xmath9 take the following values for the cubic array containing @xmath27 junctions : @xmath28 the corresponding relation for the junction phase differences are : @xmath29    let us write down the dynamic equation for the current in individual loop . for a single",
    "@xmath30 shunted josephson junction ( cf .",
    "the inset in ) the total current @xmath31 through it is composed of 3 terms , namely @xmath32 where @xmath5 and @xmath4 are the junction capacity and resistance , respectively and @xmath33 is its critical current ( the self - inductance @xmath6 is included through the relation to the flux , @xmath34 , see below ) . in the case of a junction placed on @xmath35 axis inside the network , the current through it",
    "is composed of four contributions from the loops attached to it , namely @xmath36 defining additional dimensionless variables @xmath37 we can write down a complete set of dynamic equations for @xmath38 in the form @xmath39 the boundary conditions are set as @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the external flux ( in units @xmath42 ) enclosed by the plane perpendicular to the axis @xmath8 .",
    "thus we see that the external flux is screened by the self - inductance and josephson supercurrents at the surface ; these currents ignite internal supercurrents distribution . substituting the expression for the current via fluxes , and subsequently , use the relation between the fluxes and phases , we arrive at the closed system of @xmath43 equations for @xmath44 of a homogeneous josephson array",
    "whose solution will be discussed first numerically , and then in physical terms . for that purpose",
    "we have to introduce first the random variations of the junction parameters to make the situation more realistic .",
    "the system of nonlinear equations , and is solved numerically and , subsequently , analyzed in qualitative terms .",
    "the physical situation is reflected by assuming that we have a microwave field of period @xmath45 and amplitude @xmath46 applied along the @xmath47-axis and @xmath47-axis and a static magnetic field applied in the @xmath35-direction . in other words , the external magnetic flux piercing the network",
    "has the components @xmath48 where @xmath49 describes the slow sweeping rate of the applied ( quasistatic ) field .",
    "the description of real systems requires taking into account the random variation of the parameters of each loop in the array . for this purpose",
    "we introduce coefficients @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 , which characterize the size of elementary loop with coordinates ( i , j , k ) .",
    "these parameters scale the magnetic flux @xmath53 in the following way @xmath54 and in a similar manner the other components .",
    "analogously , the junction parameters @xmath55 and @xmath56 fluctuate and depend on the direction , e.g. @xmath57 all the parameters fluctuate according to the gaussian distribution with @xmath58 dispersion to match the experimentally estimated dispersion of crystallite size @xcite arround the values @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 .",
    "the representative values of the parameters in both physical and dimensionless units ( used in the simulation ) are provided in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "the microwave field period @xmath62 corresponds to the frequency much higher than that in the experiments @xcite ( @xmath63).the higher frequency was taken to accelerate the computations carried out on the work station alpha-600  mhz ( dec ) .",
    "we believe that this factor does not influence the output character in any essential way . besides , the values of parameters listed in table  [ tab1 ] are rough estimates anyway .    .",
    "the estimated values of the sample parameters and the corresponding values of the parameters taken in the network simulation [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     stability analysis complicates enormously for large @xmath64 , even for @xmath65 .",
    "however , we can grasp the difference between the results for @xmath66 and @xmath67 in .",
    "namely , taking for @xmath67 the problem symmetry then we can reduce effectively our reasoning to the @xmath66 situation by merely rescaling the quantities : @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 .",
    "this explains the doubling of the number of maxima when moving from @xmath66 to @xmath67 case .",
    "the existence of additional maxima for @xmath71 in indicates the presence of other oscillation modes leading to the subsidiary maxima near the main maxima .",
    "for @xmath72 we observe already an absorption band widening with growing system size .",
    "additionally , for @xmath71 a gradual growth of maxima in the lowest regime of @xmath73 takes place .",
    "the absorption maxima become periodic with the interval of one quantum ( i.e. @xmath74 ) only for @xmath75 for @xmath76 .",
    "this phenomenon seems to be analogous to the existence of two critical fields in bulk samples .",
    "= 0.6    the character change of the absorption spectrum obtained after introducing the random fluctuations of the junction parameters is also easy to grasp quantitatively .",
    "each discrete absorption line for a regular array depicted in is convoluted with the probability distribution .",
    "the lines for large @xmath73 are smeared out proportionally in a wide region , so their sum will result in a practically constant value of the absorption .",
    "the expression for the first critical field is valid ; that is why it was used to the evaluation of the quantities listed in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "this is simply due to the fact that for @xmath77 absorption is zero , since the superconducting loops screen the external field .",
    "as we have seen , the absorption effects are amplified with growing @xmath64 .",
    "this proves that they are common to all inhomogeneous superconductors , in distinction to the dispersion of results in one simulation cycle , which disappears with the better statistics .",
    "a general method has been presented of generating a system of second - order differential equations , which describe the time evolution of three - dimensional josephson networks with inclusion of their resistivity , inductance and capacity .",
    "the effect of junction capacity is important , since we include high frequency microwave field .",
    "apart from a characteristic field @xmath78 we observe the existence of second critical field described above .",
    "the analysis of the stability of those equations for a single structural cell ( a cube containing @xmath79 junctions ) provides the absorption maxima positions only after inclusion of the small microwave field amplitude .",
    "also , the networks of the size @xmath80 and with a @xmath58 random variations of the junction parameters are sufficient to account for the experimental observations .",

    "in this appendix we derive the analytic result from the stability considerations for the system of differential equations , describing the time evolution of the phases .",
    "the reasoning is carried out for an isolated structural unit composed of @xmath79 josephson junctions ( an elementary cube ) with inclusion of resistances and capacitances .",
    "this cell is placed in the applied field static parallel to @xmath35-axis and the microwave field parallel to @xmath47-axis .",
    "then , the symmetry of the problem reduces to consideration of four invariant phases @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 , as well as of two magnetic fluxes @xmath85 and @xmath86 , and to the loop current @xmath87 and @xmath88 . the situation is depicted schematically in .",
    "the magnetic fluxes can be related to the phase differences and the currents in the following manner ( cf .",
    "@xmath89 where @xmath90 and @xmath73 are the fluxes parallel to the corresponding axes ( in units of @xmath42 ) .",
    "we show below that the @xmath98 dependence of the potential is connected to @xmath73 and thus vanishes if @xmath99 .",
    "therefore , @xmath100 has a sharp minimum at @xmath101 .",
    "furthermore , since along the @xmath47-axis @xmath102 , with @xmath103 , and the force is given by , we have for small vibrations around minimum that @xmath104 the instability threshold of the system is reached when the quadratic form ceases to be positively determined .",
    "this happens for @xmath105 it remains still to determine the relation between @xmath98 and @xmath73 .",
    "since @xmath103 , then we can set at @xmath106 @xmath99 ; then @xmath107 and hence @xmath108 thus , the relation to @xmath73 can be determined by considering the equilibrium points , for which e.g. the first equation of reduces to the form @xmath109 taking into account and we obtain the critical flux value @xmath110 this formula determines the applied field value , for which the first catastrophe takes place .",
    "formally , the critical value of @xmath98 , for which the determinant of the quadratic form vanishes , repeats every unit . in effect , the critical value @xmath111 should repeat itself every @xmath112 units .",
    "this does not happen because at the catastrophe , at which changes locally from paraboloidal into saddle - like , the small oscillation approximation looses its meaning .",
    "the @xmath113 value does not grow without limit but changes abruptly by the amount @xmath114 , i.e. the system jumps to the closest minimum , where again we can use for the time being the small - oscillation considerations .",
    "the sign is not important .",
    "nonetheless , such change of @xmath113 determines the sign change of the term @xmath115 in the second equation of system .",
    "therefore , the equilibrium condition for @xmath116 and @xmath98 has now the form @xmath117 from which we have @xmath118 and thus , the magnitude of the jump is @xmath119 this means that at each catastrophe the system overcomes , at given magnetic field , half of the way to the next critical point ( or , pulls back by the same value ) .",
    "this , in turn leads to the frequency doubling , with which catastrophes happen with a slow increase of static external field . in effect",
    "this leads to @xmath120 where @xmath121 .",
