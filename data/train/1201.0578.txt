    "the claim that an isolated ( closed ) macroscopic system evolves to the thermal equilibrium state lies in the very basis of the statistical mechanics .",
    "the question about the precise meaning of this statement for classical and quantum systems arises for every student studying the university course of statistical mechanics . with me",
    "this happens in kharkov university in 1978 .",
    "two years later , i published two papers @xcite in russian - language journals , in which relaxation of the isolated macroscopic quantum system to the thermal equilibrium was studied on the example of the chain of harmonic oscillators .",
    "it turns out , that the set of problems considered in these papers and underlying ideas became the subject of considerable theoretical interest in subsequent years , to much extent , due to experiments on quantum dynamics in the ultracold atomic gases @xcite .",
    "this relates , in particular , to the quantum quench problem @xcite , and to the equilibration scenario in quantum systems based on the _ eigenstate thermalization hypothesis _ ( eth ) @xcite and on the idea of canonical typicality @xcite .",
    "while the second paper @xcite was later translated into english , the first one @xcite remained without translation .",
    "the aim of the present retrospective publication is to present the english translation of paper @xcite , complemented with comments relating to its motivations and results .    in the both papers @xcite , the isolated linear chain of @xmath0 weakly coupled quantum harmonic oscillators ( the atoms )",
    "was considered .",
    "the model hamiltonian reads as @xmath1 , \\quad \\omega\\ll\\omega_0.\\ ] ] here index @xmath2 @xmath3 enumerates the atoms in the chain , @xmath4 and @xmath5 denote the special coordinate and momentum of the @xmath6-th atom , periodical boundary conditions are implied . at @xmath7 ,",
    "the chain was taken in the inhomogeneous pure state @xmath8 , in which the macroscopic energy @xmath9 , with @xmath10 was supplied to one atom with @xmath11 . at @xmath12 ,",
    "the chain evolved into the state @xmath13 , which was determined due to exact integrability of the model ( [ hc ] ) .    in the first paper @xcite ,",
    "the time evolution of the reduced density operator @xmath14 of the atom located at the @xmath6-th site of the chain was calculated and studied , @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the projector - type density operator of the whole chain , and @xmath18 denotes the trace over the space corresponding to the rest @xmath19 atoms .    on the short - time scale ,",
    "the slow spreading of the energy from the initially excited atom along the chain with the velocity @xmath20 was found . on the other hand ,",
    "the time average of the reduced density operators @xmath14 of each atom in the chain over the infinite time interval was found to approach to the gibbs distribution in the thermodynamic limit @xmath21 .",
    "it turns out , however , that the time - fluctuations of the single - atom reduced density operators @xmath14 remain considerable on the long - time scale .",
    "such atypical behavior was associated with the strong degeneracy of the energy level differences @xmath22 in model ( [ hc ] ) .",
    "it was shown in @xcite , that lifting this degeneracy by arbitrary weak nonlinear interaction provides suppression of these fluctuations and guaranties approach of the single - atom density operators @xmath14 to the gibbs distribution at large @xmath23 .",
    "though this result was proved only for the case @xmath24 , it is very likely , that it holds also for @xmath25 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite as well , that for a huge majority of eigenstates @xmath26 of the total hamiltonian ( [ hc ] ) , the reduced density operators @xmath27 corresponding to each individual @xmath6-th atom in the chain are equal to the gibbs distribution in the thermodynamic limit . in other words , a typical exact pure stationary state @xmath26 of the chain hamiltonian",
    "would be perceived as the thermal equilibrium state by the observer , which can see just one atom in the chain .",
    "this result agrees with the eth , which was put forward later by deutsch @xcite and srednicki @xcite .    in paper @xcite the results of @xcite",
    "were partly extended to the subsystems consisting of @xmath28 neighbouring atoms in the chain , @xmath29 .",
    "starting from the same initial pure state @xmath8 , the time evolution of the reduced density operator @xmath30 of the subsystem containing @xmath28 atoms was calculated .",
    "qualitative behavior of @xmath30 at large @xmath23 was shown to be similar to that of the single - atom reduced density operator @xmath14 described in @xcite . it should be noted , however , that calculation of the time - average in @xcite was not completely rigorous , but applied a certain reasonable conjecture , see equation ( 10 ) in @xcite .",
    "the following note is in order here .",
    "the quantum chain of harmonic oscillators determined by hamiltonian ( [ hc ] ) has the complete set of @xmath3 commuting integrals of motion @xmath31 which characterize the number of phonons with given quasimomenta @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",
    "integrability of model ( [ hc ] ) is the direct consequence of existence of these integrals of motion .",
    "the another side of the coin is that conservation of @xmath3 integrals of motion makes impossible the complete thermalization of a typical initial state in this model .",
    "however :    * an observer , which can see _ just one atom in the chain _ , can not distinguish phonon modes with different quasimomenta @xmath34 . by this reason , conservation of the phonon numbers",
    "@xmath31 in the whole quantum chain does not conflict with the chain _ partial thermalization _",
    ", which is registered by the observer watching at a single atom .",
    "* anyway , complete thermalization in model ( [ hc ] ) could be still possible for some particular initial states of the chain .",
    "the rest of this preprint is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec1 ] describes in detail the background ideas on thermalization in quantum systems , which stimulated me to do the model calculations described in @xcite . in a very brief form , these ideas were present already in the introductory parts of these two papers .",
    "section [ sec2 ] contains comments on the results and some calculation details of paper @xcite , which english translation is given in the appendix .",
    "section [ s3 ] contains new results illustrating the effect of the nonlinear interaction on the thermalization of the atom energies in the chain .",
    "the statistical mechanics , besides the dynamical laws , is based on certain additional probability hypothesis ( the micro - canonical distribution postulate , the correlation weakness principle , etc . ) which are justified finally by the good agreement of the theory with experiment .",
    "one can guess , that such additional hypothesis are in fact the consequences of the dynamical laws .",
    "this idea was realized in the boltzmann s approach , for which ergodicity of the hamiltonian flows plays an important role .",
    "verification of the latter for real systems is a difficult problem . in @xcite ergodicity of a system of @xmath3 hard spheres",
    "was proved .",
    "however , this proof can not be extended to oscillatory systems . in many papers @xcite the ergodicity problem",
    "is analyzed analytically and numerically .    for quantum systems , justification of the micro - canonical distribution",
    "is even more problematic , since the matrix elements of the density operator calculated in the basis of the stationary states only change their phases and do not approach to the equilibrium distribution .",
    "nevertheless , von neumann @xcite managed to prove some important statements , which could be treated as quantum basis of the classical statistical mechanics . in the von neumann s approach",
    ", it is allowed to measure not all dynamical quantities , but only classical ( macroscopic ) variables which quantum operators mutually commute .",
    "one can guess , that in a non - isolated system being in contact with the thermal bath , all dynamical variables are characterized by statistical properties .",
    "in other words , the density operator of such a system at almost all time moments is the gibbs distribution . in the present paper",
    "this assumption is verified for the linear chain of harmonic oscillators - the system of interacting particles , which allows exact solution of the schrdinger equation .",
    "the dynamics of relaxation in this system is studied as well .",
    "the fundamental question about the meaning and the mechanism of thermalization in a macroscopic isolated dynamical system can be divided into two parts :    * what is the precise meaning ( microscopic definition ) of the term the thermal equilibrium state for the isolated macroscopic system ? * in what sense the isolated macroscopic system approaches to the equilibrium state due to its dynamical evolution ?",
    "though for classical systems , at least , partial answers to these questions could be found in the ergodic theory , the situation with the quantum systems was much less certain . in the statistical mechanics textbooks ( for example , see @xcite ) , the equilibrium state of an isolated quantum system with the hamiltonian @xmath35 and the energy lying in the interval between @xmath36 and @xmath37 , ( @xmath38 )",
    "is usually defined through the equal _ a priori _ probability postulate , leading to the microcanonical density operator @xmath39 , @xmath40 where @xmath41 denotes the trace of the operator @xmath42 , and @xmath43 is the heaviside step function .    however , it is not easy to answer to the question ( ii ) with this conventional definition of the thermal equilibrium state",
    ". really , the matrix elements of the density operator @xmath44 of the isolated system calculated in the basis of its stationary states only change their phases with time and do not approach to the matrix elements of the microcanonical distribution ( [ mc ] ) .",
    "furthermore , evolution of the isolated system from some non - equilibrium pure state @xmath8 is described by the unitary operator @xmath45 , @xmath46 .",
    "corresponding density operator @xmath47 being the orthogonal projector operator at @xmath7 , @xmath48 remains , of course , to be the orthogonal projector operator at all @xmath49 , @xmath50 since the microcanonical density operator ( [ mc ] ) is not a projector operator , the projector - type density operator @xmath51 can not approach to it in some simple sense , say , in the strong or weak operator topology .",
    "the common way used in the textbooks to avoid this problem , is to remind that the notion of the isolated system is a physical idealization , and in reality , all systems interact with their surrounding .",
    "however , though this statement is undoubtedly correct , one could hardly believe , that it is the true origin of thermalization , and that the latter can not be understood within the concept of the isolated quantum system .    if only isolated systems are concerned , the possible way to answer question ( ii ) is to restrict the set physically observable operators @xmath52 , to some family @xmath53 and to claim , that only for these operators @xmath54 one should expect approaching of the quantum expectation values @xmath55 to the their ( microcanonical ) equilibrium values : @xmath56 \\leadsto   { \\rm tr }   \\ , [ { a}_i\\,\\cdot \\rho_{\\delta}(e ,   { h})],\\ ] ] with subsequent fluctuations .",
    "notation @xmath57 will be used to indicate that the value of the time - dependent quantity @xmath58 is close ( equals in the thermodynamic limit ) to @xmath59 at almost any moment @xmath23 .",
    "this idea was realized by von neumann in his quantum ergodic theorem @xcite . in this theorem , operators @xmath60 were treated by von neumann as operators of the macroscopic observables , and were assumed to commute with each other , @xmath61=0 , \\quad { \\rm for } \\ ; a_i , a_j\\in { \\mathcal   a}. $ ]    a deep analysis of foundations of the statistical mechanics was given by landau and lifshitz in their course of theoretical physics .",
    "they define the thermal equilibrium in the following way ( see pages 6 and 2 in @xcite ) : [ ll ] . if a closed macroscopic system is in a state such that in any subsystem the physical quantities are to a high degree of accuracy equal to their mean values , the system is said to be in a state of statistical equilibrium ( or thermodynamic or thermal equilibrium ) .",
    "the subsystems here are implied to be small compared with the whole system and weakly interacting with surrounding .",
    "such subsystems will be called as allowed subsystems in the sequel .    in the above definition , thermalization behavior",
    "is required for the reduced family of the macroscopic observables , which relate to the macroscopic subsystems of the isolated system .",
    "taking definition [ ll ] as a starting point , one could arrive to a nice physical scenario , in which thermalization in the isolated macroscopic quantum system could result solely from its quantum mechanical evolution .",
    "the first step was to drop two underlined words  in the above definition .",
    "this extended the family @xmath62 of thermalizable physical observable to _ all _ physical observables , which characterize the state of _ allowed subsystems _ , either macroscopic or not .",
    "then , definition [ ll ] becomes equivalent to the following one :    [ q ] @xcite . a closed macroscopic system with hamiltonian h at the time moment t is in the state of equilibrium if any sufficiently small",
    ", possibly macroscopic subsystem of it that is weakly coupled to the surroundings has the gibbs distribution .",
    "let us denote by @xmath63 some subdivision of our isolated macroscopic quantum system into the allowed subsystem @xmath64 with the hamiltonian @xmath65 , and the rest of the system @xmath66 , which plays the role of the thermal bath .",
    "the hilbert space @xmath67 of the whole system can be decomposed into the tensor product @xmath68 of the hilbert spaces @xmath69 and @xmath70 corresponding to the subsystem , and its surrounding , respectively . [",
    "part ] an isolated macroscopic quantum system will be called to be in the ( partial ) thermal equilibrium with respect to the allowed subsystem @xmath64 , if the reduced density operators @xmath71 of this subsystem is to a high accuracy equal to the canonical density operators @xmath72 given by the gibbs formula @xmath73 } , \\\\",
    "z_{s,\\alpha } = { { \\rm tr } ^{(s,\\alpha ) } \\,\\exp [ -\\beta(\\alpha ) \\ , h_{s,\\alpha } ] } , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath74 denotes the trace over the hilbert space corresponding to the quantum states of the subsystem @xmath64 , and @xmath75 is the inverse temperature which could depend on the subsystem @xmath64 .",
    "note , that the reduced density operator of the subsystem @xmath76 is related with the density operator @xmath77 of the whole system as @xmath78 where @xmath79 denotes the trace over the thermal bath space @xmath70 .",
    "it is clear , that the macroscopic quantum system stays in the global thermal equilibrium in the sense of definition [ q ] , if and only if it is in the partial thermal equilibrium with respect to all its allowed subsystems @xmath64 with the same inverse temperature @xmath80",
    ".    definition [ q ] has several important advantages .",
    "first , it does not refer to the notion of the microcanonical ensemble and to the equal _ a priori _ probability postulate .",
    "second , with definition  [ q ] , the answer to the question ( ii ) becomes straightforward and leads to the natural treatment of the thermalization phenomenon in quantum systems .",
    "[ t ] thermalization in the macroscopic isolated quantum system means , that after the relaxation time , the matrix elements of the reduced density operators @xmath81 of all its allowed subsystems @xmath64 in the basis of their stationary states @xmath82 should approach ( up to further fluctuations ) to those of the canonical density operators ( [ g ] ) , @xmath83 and @xmath84 , @xmath85 is the energy spectrum of the subsystem @xmath64 .",
    "third , one can easily see , that the problem mentioned in the beginning of this section does not arise with definition [ t ] .",
    "really , if the whole system is in a pure state described by some projector density operator ( [ nes ] ) , the subsystem reduced density operator ( [ rd ] ) can correspond to a mixed state due to the quantum entanglement , and this mixed state can approach to the equilibrium gibbs state ( [ g ] ) .",
    "if a macroscopic isolated quantum system possesses the property of thermalization , one should expect , that a typical initial state @xmath86 having macroscopically well determined total energy would approach in its unitary evolution to the equilibrium state , understood according to definition [ q ] and then remain in this state almost at any time .",
    "it is tempting to take the initial state @xmath87 of the whole system as a single stationary state @xmath88 of its hamiltonian , @xmath89",
    ". then , the previous statement naturally leads to the eth @xcite , which can be formulated as follows : [ eth ] in a thermalizable isolated quantum system , the huge majority of individual stationary states @xmath88 of the whole system represent the thermal equilibrium state .",
    "this means , that @xmath90 for all allowed subsystems @xmath64 , and almost all stationary states @xmath88 .    though the described above heuristic scenario of thermalization looked rather reasonable and attractive for me in 1979 ,",
    "i had no idea how to put it on a more firm basis for a generic isolated quantum system .",
    "so , it was natural to try to test this scenario on some simple model of interacting particles .",
    "such a test was partly realized in @xcite for the model of the quantum chain of harmonic oscillators .",
    "it should be noted , that definition [ q ] provided the basis of the described above treatment of thermalization .",
    "it implies that the family @xmath62 of thermalizable observables can be associated with all observables which characterize the states of allowed subsystems .",
    "approach to the thermalization problem emphasizing the role of the canonical ensemble for the subsystem state as the main indication of thermal equilibrium in quantum systems ,     the origin of this approach comes back to erwin schrdinger @xcite , see discussion in @xcite .",
    "was developed later by several groups .",
    "important results along this direction were obtained by tasaki @xcite , popescu , short , and winter @xcite , linden _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , and by goldstein _",
    "in the normal mode representation , the quantum chain of harmonic oscillators reduces to the free phonon gas .",
    "as it was mentioned in the introduction , conservation of phonon numbers @xmath91 makes impossible complete thermalization of a typical initial state @xmath86 in this model .",
    "however , the quantum measurements performed on one atom in the chain does not allow one to distinguish different phonon modes .",
    "so , it is natural to expect , that for model ( [ hc ] ) , the weak versions of the thermalization property ( proposition [ t ] ) and of the eth ( proposition [ eth ] ) are still valid , in which equations ( [ g ] ) and ( [ g1 ] ) are required only for the subsystems @xmath92 consisting of one @xmath6-th atom in the chain .",
    "note , that due to the requirement @xmath93 , each atom in the chain weakly interacts with its surrounding and , therefore , represents an allowed subsystem by itself .",
    "paper @xcite , which english translation is given in appendix , was dedicated to verification of this statement .",
    "the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis ( see proposition [ eth ] ) was the important part of the described above heuristic scenario of thermalization , which provided motivation for @xcite . note , that the eth was not formulated explicitly in @xcite , this has been done later by deutsch @xcite and srednicki @xcite . however , a weak form of the eth for model ( [ hc ] ) was proved in @xcite .",
    "namely , equation validates the eth ( proposition [ eth ] ) in model ( [ hc ] ) for the _ single - atom subsystems_. it was conjectured also in @xcite , that , `` perhaps , this result holds to some extent in other dynamical systems '' .",
    "parameter @xmath94 in is related with the inverse temperature @xmath80 by the plank s formula @xmath95 and @xmath96 . in the case @xmath24 , equation can be easily obtained from which , in turn , follows from the results of appendix 1 of paper @xcite .",
    "to prove , let us rewrite for @xmath97 in the explicit form @xmath98 where @xmath99 denotes the set of integer numbers @xmath100 , which lie in the interval @xmath101",
    ". denote by @xmath102 the number of nonzero integers in the set @xmath31 . for fixed @xmath103 and macroscopic @xmath102 , the leading contribution to the sum @xmath104 comes from configurations @xmath100 , in which @xmath105 takes values either @xmath106 , or @xmath107 .",
    "contribution of all the rest terms is smaller by the factor @xmath108 .",
    "the same is valid also for the sum @xmath109 therefore , @xmath110   = \\\\",
    "\\nonumber \\frac { { \\mathfrak n } ! } { p ! ( { \\mathfrak n}-p ) ! } [ 1+o(n_1^{-1 } ) ] = \\frac { { \\mathfrak n}^p } { p ! } [ 1+o(n_1^{-1})],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] at fixed @xmath111 and @xmath112",

    "if @xmath114 , the above formal manipulations can be justified , since the infinite series in @xmath111 in converges uniformly in @xmath21 .    at @xmath115 , the series in @xmath111 in diverges . nevertheless , it is also possible to prove at @xmath115 directly from , though the proof is more complicated , than at @xmath116 . on the other hand , a much easer indirect way to confirm exists , which is suitable for all positive @xmath117 .",
    "namely , one can check that the quantum expectation values of the operator @xmath118 calculated with the both sides of this equation lead to the same results for any integer @xmath119 .",
    "let @xmath120 and @xmath121 are the two sets of @xmath3 bosonic annihilation operators , which are related by the linear transformation @xmath122 with the unitary @xmath3-dependent matrix @xmath123 , and @xmath124 denotes the basis associated with the first set of the bosonic operators .",
    "for each @xmath3 , let us choose a basis vector @xmath125 in such a way , that @xmath126 , \\textrm {   with some fixed   } c>0,\\ ] ] and the limits @xmath127 exist for given @xmath6 .",

    "so , it is sufficient to put @xmath131 in . then , substitution of into the matrix element in the left - hand side of this equation followed by straightforward calculations yields @xmath132 where @xmath133 is the laguerre polynomial , @xmath134 the explicit form of read as @xmath135 ^ 2- \\sum_{l=1}^n |a_{kl}|^4 ( n_l + n_l^2 ) , \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\langle n_n,\\ldots , n_1|b_k^{\\dagger 3}b_k^3|n_1,\\ldots , n_n\\rangle   = 3!\\left [ \\sum_{l=1}^n |a_{kl}|^2 n_l\\right]^3 + \\sum_{l=1}^n |a_{kl}|^6 ( 2 n_l+6 n_l^2 + 4 n_l^3)- \\\\ & & 9 \\sum_{l=1}^n |a_{kl}|^4 \\sum_{m=1}^n ( n_l\\,n_m +   n_l^2),\\\\ & & \\langle n_n,\\ldots , n_1|b_k^{\\dagger m}b_k^m|n_1,\\ldots , n_n\\rangle =    m!\\left [ \\sum_{l=1}^n |a_{kl}|^2 n_l\\right]^m+\\ldots\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is easy to understand , that only the first term in the right - hand side of the above relations survives in the thermodynamic limit @xmath21 due to and .    let us associate with each pair of operators @xmath136 the single - atom subsystems @xmath92 with the hamiltonians @xmath137 .",

    "<S> this preprint contains the english translation of the paper `` relaxation dynamics of a quantum chain of harmonic oscillators '' , which was published by the author in 1980 in the ukrainian physical journal . </S>",
    "<S> comments describing its motivations , background ideas and results are presented as well . </S>",
    "<S> this paper addressed to the problem of approach to the thermal equilibrium in an isolated macroscopic quantum system , which was studied on the example of the quantum chain of weakly interacting harmonic oscillators . in the initial state , macroscopic energy </S>",
    "<S> was supplied to one oscillator ( atom ) in the chain . </S>",
    "<S> subsequent evolution of the quantum state of the whole chain was determined due to the model integrability . </S>",
    "<S> the main subject of interest was the time evolution of the reduced density operators characterizing the quantum state of a particular atom . </S>",
    "<S> on the short time - scale , the energy perturbation expands along the chain with the velocity of the fastest phonon mode . on the long - time scale , </S>",
    "<S> the single - atom density operators display strong fluctuations around the canonical gibbs distribution . </S>",
    "<S> these fluctuations are caused by the degeneracy of the energy level differences ( presence of resonances ) in the model of coupled harmonic oscillators . </S>",
    "<S> after lifting this degeneracy , fluctuations are suppressed providing , that the reduced density operator of each atom in the chain becomes very close to the gibbs distribution at almost any time moment . </S>"
