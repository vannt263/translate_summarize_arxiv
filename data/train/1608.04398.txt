    "the constant @xmath170 is a parameter between 0 and 1 that we set to 0.65 for most cases . for loops that tend to diverge during early iterations ,",
    "@xmath170 is first set to 0.2 and then gradually raised to 0.5 .",
    "once @xmath57 is updated , the table of @xmath154 values is updated , and the process is repeated until the relative temperature difference between one iteration and the next is less than a thousandth of a percent for ten sample grid points spaced evenly through the grid , from @xmath171 to @xmath172      in order to determine whether the time - steady solutions are stable to small perturbations , we test for unstable gravitational stratification . according to @xcite ,",
    "a hydrostatic loop becomes _ dynamically unstable _ if @xmath173 in the region @xmath174 .",
    "often , it is not necessary to apply this criterion because unstable solutions tend to be unphysical in other ways . in almost all cases ,",
    "our models exhibit monotonically decreasing density with increasing @xmath5 .",
    "if the coronal heating is concentrated too strongly at the base , equation ( [ eq : gravstrat ] ) may end up being satisfied , but these models tend to have insufficient heating toward the apex to maintain a time - steady hot corona .",
    "the iteration process in this case leads to negative temperatures , clearly indicating an unphysical solution .",
    "there have been a number of different _ thermal instabilities _ proposed that could disrupt some coronal loops and give rise to prominence condensation or `` coronal rain '' ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "this process  in which the loop is stretched or twisted beyond a stable length and cools catastrophically to chromospheric temperatures  is just one of several proposed to explain the highly dynamic and intermittent ultraviolet and x - ray emission seen from loops .",
    "however , we defer the study of these kinds of instabilities to future work , since the large - scale quiescent loops modeled in this paper appear to have parameters quite distinct from the ( mainly low - lying ) unstable loops in the studies cited above .",
    "we consider loops of two different lengths , both given in table  1 , and we refer to them as `` long '' and `` short '' loops with reference to the categories defined by @xcite .",
    "the short loops are characterized by @xmath175 and @xmath176 , and the long loops have @xmath177 and @xmath178 . to span the full parameter space of possible loop solutions for each length , we fill a three - dimensional grid of values for @xmath78 , @xmath77 , and @xmath104 .",
    "twenty different values for @xmath78 are used , with ten values evenly spaced between 0 and 0.9 ( i.e. , @xmath179 ) and another ten values evenly spaced in @xmath114 between 1.3 and 4.0 .",
    "ten different values are used for @xmath77 that are evenly spaced on a logarithmic scale bounded by 0.01 and 3.16 erg @xmath71 . for most values of @xmath78",
    "we use 13 different values of @xmath104 . however , when @xmath180 , the compressive heating term described in equation ( [ eq : compheat ] ) vanishes and the coronal heating term is purely alfvnic .",
    "it is therefore only necessary to simulate the loops once for each value of @xmath77 when @xmath180 since the damping length no longer affects the heating rate .",
    "for all other values of @xmath78 , the 13 values of @xmath104 are evenly spaced between 0.004 and 0.04 @xmath181 . in total ,",
    "4960 loops are simulated , half of which are short and half of which are long .    in order to draw as close a parallel as possible to the findings of @xcite , we often average values along the loop `` legs '' at the heights probed by the demt technique .",
    "the legs are defined to span heights between 0.03 and 0.2 @xmath181 , with the larger value replaced by @xmath20 for the short loops that do not extend as high as 0.2 @xmath181 . specifically , we compute mean temperatures @xmath182 in the legs , and we use the slope of a linear fit to @xmath183 in the legs to determine a mean temperature derivative @xmath184 . models with a positive slope are characterized as `` up loops '' and those with a negative slope are `` down loops . ''",
    "we note , however , that this one parameter does not always accurately characterize the full spatial dependence of @xmath57 .",
    "figure [ fig05 ] shows a selection of temperature and pressure profiles for long loops ( @xmath185 ) with a range of @xmath114 values and fixed values of @xmath186 erg @xmath71 and @xmath187 . increasing the amount of mode conversion ( i.e. , larger values of @xmath114 ) decreases the total amount of heat deposited along the loop , but it also makes the heating rate more strongly peaked at the footpoints .",
    "@xcite showed that a sufficiently steep decrease in @xmath188 indeed gives rise to a `` down loop '' with a local minimum in temperature at the apex .",
    "we determined that stable down loops become possible when the mode conversion from alfvnic to compressive waves is strong ( i.e. , @xmath189 ) .",
    "down loops tend to be seen only for a finite range of @xmath77 values , and the bounds of this range vary inversely with @xmath104 . for values of @xmath77",
    "smaller than this finite range , loops remain `` normal '' ( i.e. , with monotonically increasing temperatures ) for all values of @xmath114 . for values of @xmath77 larger than this finite range , the amount of deposited energy at the base appears to be too large for stable coronal loops to exist , and the code is unable to find solutions with @xmath190 everywhere .",
    "detailed maps of the parameter space are shown below .",
    "a number of loops are poorly described as `` up '' or `` down '' when their slope @xmath184 is only taken from a linear fit along the legs as described above . in some cases , the peak temperature occurs below the apex , but it is too high for it to be registered as a down loop . of the 1940 short loops recorded as `` up '' loops , 214 ( 11% ) have maximum temperatures before the apex , while the same is true for 189 ( 8.9% ) of the 2115 long `` up '' loops .",
    "it is possible that these kinds of loops are not reported by @xcite because they only considered loops for which it was possible to create a high - quality linear fit ( i.e. , with @xmath191 ) from the demt data .    in figure  [ fig06 ]",
    "we also illustrate a transitional nonmonotonic temperature profile that occurs for some long - loop models .",
    "standard up and down loops exhibit one and two temperature maxima ( when measured from footpoint to footpoint ) , respectively .",
    "these `` hybrid '' loops exhibit _ three _ temperature peaks ; i.e. , they have a local maximum at the apex , local minima below the apex , and additional local maxima below them on either side",
    ". figure  [ fig06](b ) illustrates how these hybrid loop cases can occur .",
    "equation ( [ eq : dpsi ] ) indicates that if @xmath192 , the second derivative of @xmath143 is positive and the temperature curve near the peak is concave up , consistent with down loops . if @xmath193 , the curve is concave down at the apex , consistent with up loops .",
    "however , in figure  [ fig06](b ) we see that for the hybrid loop case , the ratio @xmath194 oscillates above and below 1 a number of times between the base and the apex . thus , despite the strong conduction that tends to smear out small - scale thermal fluctuations along the field , these rare cases do demand multiple minima and maxima in the time - steady @xmath57 .",
    "figures [ fig07 ] and [ fig08 ] are contour plots that indicate the mean temperature gradient @xmath184 in units of mk  @xmath195 .",
    "each panel plots @xmath184 versus @xmath114 and @xmath77 for a fixed value of @xmath104 . figure  [ fig07 ] shows results for the short loop models , and figure  [ fig08 ] shows results for the long loop models .",
    "we continue the color scheme from figures  [ fig05 ] and [ fig06 ] ( and from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in which up - loop parameters are in red and down - loop parameters are in blue .",
    "white areas in figures [ fig07 ] and [ fig08 ] indicate combinations of parameters for which the code did not find physically realistic solutions .",
    "this tends to occur for the largest values of both @xmath114 and @xmath77 ; i.e. , very strong basal heating and a rapid drop - off of @xmath60 with increasing height .",
    "all cases of `` good '' solutions ( not in white ) were found to be also gravitationally stable ( @xmath196 ) everywhere from footpoint to apex .",
    "this result disagrees somewhat with @xcite , who found some cases of gravitationally unstable loops with positive temperatures at all values of @xmath5 .",
    "these cases occurred for similar ( i.e. , rapidly decreasing ) heating functions as our no - solution cases , but it should be noted that the exponential form for @xmath197 used by @xcite was different from what is used here .    as noted above , the sign of the observationally motivated mean gradient @xmath184 does not always convey an accurate picture of the number of temperature minima and maxima . specifically , it does not reveal the region of parameter space that produces `` hybrid loops '' ( i.e. , ones with three maxima in @xmath57 from footpoint to footpoint ) at all .",
    "thus , in figure  [ fig09 ] we give an example of the same parameter space shown in figures [ fig07][fig08 ] , but with a finer grid and a color scale that denotes the exact topological nature of each model s temperature profile .",
    "this grid contained 12,000 models that were only simulated until the peak temperature had sufficiently converged : 100 values of @xmath114 and 120 values of @xmath77 that span the limits shown in figure  [ fig09 ] .",
    "the hybrid loops ( 3 peaks ) occupy a narrow strip of parameter space between the standard regions of up loops ( 1 peak ) and down loops ( 2 peaks ) , with some small - scale boundary structure that depends on the relative magnitudes of the heating terms @xmath153 and @xmath60 as discussed above .",
    "the purple `` spurs '' that extend to the right in figure  [ fig09 ] correspond to loops with extremely shallow minima beneath their apex .",
    "in those cases the temperature variation at the top of the loop is almost flat , and a plot of @xmath57 would look nearly indistinguishable from a two - peak down  loop .    the numerical results for apex temperature @xmath198 and base pressure @xmath56 can be compared straightforwardly to several existing analytical models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for simplicity",
    "s sake we compare only with ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter rtv ) , who assumed a constant heating rate @xmath59 versus distance along a loop with constant pressure and cross section . for standard choices of the radiative and conductive constants ,",
    "the rtv laws can be written as @xmath199 @xmath200 @xmath201 @xmath202 because the heating rates used in this paper are monotonically decreasing from footpoint to apex , it is not clear what value(s ) of @xmath59 to use in equations ( [ eq : rtvt])([eq : rtvp ] ) . after some experimentation , we found that using the geometric mean of the basal and apex heating rates ( i.e. , the square root of their product ) produces reasonable agreement with the rtv predictions .",
    "figure  [ fig10 ] shows a model - by - model comparison for the grid of short loops .",
    "a comparable plot for the long loops looks similar to this one , but with all values of @xmath198 and @xmath56 shifted slightly upwards .",
    "note that the up  loops ( red points ) tend to be more rtv - like than the down  loops ( blue ) , since the latter often have a more pronounced and complicated @xmath5-dependence to their heating rates and pressures .    for a more direct comparison with the observational data , figure  [ fig11](a ) shows how @xmath182 and @xmath184 compare against one another .",
    "polygonal outlines ( adapted from figure 10 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) give an approximate indication of the observed region of parameter space for up and down loops .",
    "out of the 4960 cases simulated in the short and long loop grids , only 698 of them ( 14% ) fall inside the polygonal outlines .",
    "figure  [ fig11](b ) outlines the regions of parameter space ( in @xmath77 and @xmath114 ) corresponding to the these models .",
    "there seems to be an intermediate range of values for @xmath77 ( which changes slightly based on the mode coupling efficiency ) required to match the observations .",
    "more wave power would result in too much heating ( i.e. , @xmath203  mk ) , and less wave power would give too little ( @xmath204  mk ) .",
    "there are no clear limiting values of @xmath104 that identify the subset of models that agree with the observations .",
    "figure  [ fig11 ] gives the general impression that the measured quiescent up  loops are produced when there is a _ small _ amount of mode energy transfer from alfvn to compressive waves at the tr , and the down  loops are produced when there is _ large _ mode energy transfer . for low values of @xmath114 ,",
    "the band of observationally appropriate parameters for up  loops corresponds to basal values of the alfvn velocity amplitude around 36 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "these values are quite a bit smaller than the canonical 2030 km  s@xmath1 nonthermal amplitudes often seen in the brighter and more compact active - region loops .",
    "however , the large quiescent loops traced out by the demt technique @xcite are believed to comprise a _ diffuse coronal background _ that must be heated more weakly than the small and bright loops that are easier to resolve in extreme ultraviolet images .",
    "@xcite measured the plasma @xmath205 ratio for the observed loops , where @xmath206 the leg - averaged value @xmath207 was found to be systematically larger for down  loops ( median values of 13 ) than for up  loops ( median values of 0.50.9 ) .",
    "@xcite attributed this difference mainly to the fact that down  loops tend to have weaker magnetic fields than up  loops .",
    "they also speculated that the larger values of @xmath207 in the down  loops should make them more susceptible to mode conversion between alfvn and compressive waves .",
    "unfortunately , we can not make a direct comparison with the observed trends in @xmath205 because our modeled loops do not depend on an absolute normalization for @xmath15 .",
    "however , we have estimated the value of @xmath208 at the tr under the assumption that all loops share a common value of @xmath209  g at the tr .",
    "in fact , we believe @xmath208 may be a more important parameter for determining the degree of basal mode conversion than @xmath207 measured higher up in the corona . with the above assumption about @xmath15 ,",
    "the up  loops within the red polygonal outline in figure  [ fig11](a ) have a median value of @xmath210 , and the corresponding down  loops have a median value of @xmath211 .",
    "this difference is attributable solely to differences in @xmath56 in the two populations of models , but it does go in the same direction as the observed variation in @xmath207 . it should be noted that a similar trend in base pressures is also evident in the measured mean values given in table  1 of @xcite .",
    "thus , it is unclear whether the observed differences in @xmath207 between the up and down loops can be attributed primarily to differences in gas pressure or magnetic pressure .",
    "one key goal of this paper was to test the conjecture made by @xcite that mode conversion at the tr  from alfvnic to compressive waves  can be responsible for the existence of coronal loops with an `` inverted '' temperature structure .",
    "we constructed a large grid of models with two sources of time - steady coronal heating : a turbulent cascade of incompressible alfvn waves ( which generally produces heating that varies slowly with height ) and the rapid basal dissipation of compressive waves ( whose heating is highly peaked at the loop footpoints ) .",
    "the production of stable loops with radially decreasing temperatures requires nearly all ( i.e. , @xmath099% ) of the alfvn wave energy to be converted to compressive waves that deposit their heat at the base .",
    "this was anticipated in earlier parameter studies @xcite , but we have quantified how much wave - mode energy transfer is needed to produce such highly peaked heating functions .",
    "one aspect of the models that was relegated to free - parameter status was the damping length @xmath104 of the compressive waves .",
    "our grid of models assumed values of @xmath104 that vary over an order of magnitude between 0.004 and 0.04 @xmath181 .",
    "it is worthwhile to compare these values with predictions from the theory of magnetoacoustic wave dissipation .",
    "@xcite modeled this by assuming two sources of energy loss : ( linear ) thermal conductivity and ( nonlinear ) shock entropy evolution .",
    "the latter was found to be more important in the chromosphere , and the former was found to be more important in the corona .",
    "thus , we examine heat conductivity , which has an effective damping length @xmath212 , where @xmath213 is the linear damping rate due to electron heat conduction . making use of classical expressions for this transport coefficient",
    "( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xmath214 @xmath215 where @xmath216 is the acoustic wave period .",
    "when evaluated at the chromospheric base , this damping length is very large ( 10100 @xmath181 ) , but it drops rapidly with increasing height . for typical coronal - loop apex properties ,",
    "this theoretical @xmath217 is of order @xmath218 .",
    "the height at which the value of @xmath217 matters most to the models ( equations ( [ eq : ys])([eq : compheat ] ) ) is essentially @xmath219 .",
    "this is the distance above the tr at which the damping finally gets a chance to reduce the wave energy density by a significant amount .",
    "thus , we can identify a unique damping length by finding the location at which @xmath217 ( a decreasing function of distance along the loop ) and @xmath5 ( an increasing function , by definition ) become equal to one another .    for each of the 798 models inside the polygons in figure [ fig11 ] , we determined a unique conductive damping length @xmath217 using the above procedure .",
    "we assumed a fiducial chromospheric value of @xmath220  minutes @xcite .",
    "this produced a range of values that matched the initial assumptions from our grid quite well .",
    "the minimum , median , and maximum values of @xmath217 were 0.0052 , 0.0072 , 0.047 @xmath181 , respectively . if we had used larger periods , such as the 2030 minute values observed for off - limb intensity oscillations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , then equation ( [ eq : ldtheory ] ) would have given much larger damping lengths .",
    "however , such long period waves may be susceptible to conversion to other types of conductivity - dominated modes .",
    "@xcite showed that such modes can dissipate rapidly at the coronal base , thus effectively reducing @xmath217 despite the large values of @xmath216 .",
    "although the models presented in this paper have helped to refine the connections between wave mode conversion and loop temperature structure , there are many other improvements that would allow us to build a more comprehensive understanding of heating in the closed corona .",
    "for example , instead of assuming the compressive waves are generated impulsively at the lower boundary , the models should include a self - consistent description of the height - dependence of plasma parameters in the chromosphere and tr , as well as the @xmath205-dependent physics of mode conversion ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "time - dependent simulations are beginning to show a broad diversity of mode coupling processes in this complex environment @xcite .",
    "lastly , our adopted rate of heating due to mhd turbulent cascade was a relatively simple phenomenological scaling law , but there are others ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that may be more realistic .",
    "@xcite and @xcite found that inverted - temperature loops tend to occur most frequently at low heliographic latitudes , and that they preferentially appear in the `` deep '' solar minimum .",
    "thus , the footpoint locations of down  loops correspond with some of the weakest large - scale magnetic fields seen over the solar cycle .",
    "it is not surprising that they may have higher plasma @xmath205 ratios and greater amounts of wave mode conversion than the rest of the corona .",
    "trans - equatorial loops like these connect to the cusp regions of large helmet streamers , which also exhibit @xmath76 due to their weak fields @xcite .",
    "the overall mhd stability of these regions  including their propensity to produce episodic bursts of solar wind @xcite  is likely to depend sensitively on the physics of waves and their dissipation as studied here .",
