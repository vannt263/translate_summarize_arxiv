    "during the last decades there has been great interest in the model of a harmonic oscillator confined to boxes of different shapes , sizes and dimensions .",
    "such model has been suitable for the study of several physical problems ranging from dynamical friction in star clusters to magnetic properties of solids and impurities in quantum dots ( see@xcite for a review of the relevant literature on the subject ) .",
    "in addition to it , systems of few identical particles in one dimension have proved to exhibit a rich phenomenological structure resembling that of realistic systems@xcite .",
    "in two recent papers amore and fernndez discussed the problems posed by two@xcite and three@xcite particles confined in a one - dimensional box with impenetrable walls that interact through harmonic forces .",
    "they found that a straightforward application of group theory considerably facilitates the analysis of the solutions to the schrdinger equation .",
    "in particular , an accurate rayleigh - ritz variational calculation revealed that the energies of the three - particle model as functions of the box length exhibit a most interesting pattern of avoided crossings between pairs of states of the same symmetry@xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to discuss the case of four particles in a one dimensional box that also interact through harmonic forces .",
    "the reason for choosing such interaction is that it has proved quite useful in the past ( see the references in@xcite ) and because the calculation of the matrix elements of the resulting potential is quite simple . in section  [ sec : model ]",
    "we introduce the model , section  [ sec : small - box ] shows a perturbation approach to the small - box regime and a rayleigh - ritz calculation with symmetry - adapted basis sets , section  [ sec : large - box ] describes the large - box limit , in section  [ sec : variational ] we discuss a simple variational calculation that is more suitable for larger box sizes and in section  [ sec : conclusions ] we draw conclusions .",
    "there is also an appendix outlining the construction of the projection operators used in all the calculations just described .",
    "we first consider @xmath1 interacting point particles of mass @xmath2 in a one - dimensional box of length @xmath3 with hamiltonian @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the coorinate of the @xmath6-th particle .",
    "the boundary conditions are determined by the impenetrable walls of the box @xmath7 the hamiltonian operator is invariant under the @xmath8 permutations of the particle coordinates as well as under parity inversion @xmath9 . the @xmath10 @xmath11 matrices that produce all the permutations of the sets @xmath12 and @xmath13 form a group given by the product @xmath14@xcite . when @xmath15 the group is also called @xmath16 ( in principle we can also use @xmath17 or @xmath18 that are isomorphic to @xmath19 ) and when @xmath20 we can resort to either @xmath21 or @xmath22@xcite . both cases have already been treated by group theory in earlier papers@xcite .    in order to solve the schrdinger equation",
    "it is convenient to define the dimensionless particle coordinates @xmath23 and the dimensionless hamiltonian @xmath24 where @xmath25 .",
    "the boundary conditions for the eigenfunctions @xmath26 of this operator now become @xmath27 from now on we only consider the dimensionless hamiltonian ( [ eq : h_d(nd ) ] ) and omit the subscript @xmath28 . in order to facilitate the numerical calculations we choose a harmonic interaction of the form @xmath29 that leads to @xmath30 @xmath31 and @xmath32 .    for @xmath33",
    "our problem just reduces to solving the schrdinger equation for the operator @xmath34 ,   \\label{eq : h_dimensionless}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the boundary conditions @xmath35 in this case the group @xmath36 is isomorphic to @xmath37 and in this paper we resort to the character table of the latter group@xcite .",
    "when @xmath38 is sufficiently small ( sufficiently small box size @xmath39 ) we can estimate the energy levels by means of perturbation theory .",
    "the schrdinger equation is exactly solvable when @xmath40 and the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of @xmath41 are @xmath42 note that @xmath43 .    in order to facilitate the discussion of the results we introduce the notation @xmath44 to indicate the set of all distinct permutations of four elements that may be either coordinates or quantum numbers .",
    "for example , each 4-tuple of quantum numbers in the set @xmath45 leads to the same unperturbed energy @xmath46 .",
    "we may eventually add accidental _ pythagorean _ degeneracies of the form @xmath47 , where @xmath48@xcite .",
    "if such energy level is @xmath49-fold degenerate then the perturbation corrections of first order to the eigenfunctions will be of the form @xmath50 where @xmath51 denotes a 4-tuple @xmath52 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath53 are solutions to the secular equation @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the @xmath56 matrix of the perturbation @xmath57 in the set of degenerate eigenfunctions @xmath58 , @xmath59 is the @xmath56 identity matrix , @xmath60 is a column vector with elements @xmath53 and @xmath61 is one of the @xmath49 roots of the secular determinant @xmath62 .    in order to determine the symmetry of the solution @xmath63 , which provides a suitable label for the corresponding root @xmath61 , we apply the projection operators @xmath64 associated to the irreducible representations ( irreps ) @xmath65 of the group @xmath37@xcite .",
    "the result is well known to be @xmath66 if @xmath63 is a basis for the irrep @xmath65 or @xmath67 otherwise .",
    "the construction of the projection operators is outlined in the appendix . in this way",
    "we obtain the following results for the first energy levels :    @xmath68    @xmath69    @xmath70    @xmath71    @xmath72    @xmath73    @xmath74    @xmath75    where @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 are nondegenerate , @xmath80 and @xmath81 are two - fold degenerate , and @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 are three - fold degenerate .",
    "we appreciate that the degeneracy of the unperturbed states is partially removed by the perturbation .",
    "the remaining degeneracies are expected to be broken at higher perturbation orders .",
    "one does not expect that such remaining degeneracies are due to an unknown hidden symmetry@xcite because they are rather inconsistent .",
    "for example , in the case @xmath86 we have @xmath87 ; however , @xmath88 leads to @xmath89 where the state @xmath76 and the three states @xmath83 are not degenerate as in the preceding case .",
    "figure  [ fig : eptrr ] shows the lowest energy levels in the interval @xmath90 where perturbation theory is expected to yield sufficiently accurate results .",
    "we also carried out a simple rayleigh - ritz variational calculation with symmetry - adapted basis sets for @xmath76 and @xmath83 choosing only those functions coming from @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath86 in order to show the splitting of the levels @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "these levels appear to be degenerate in the upper subfigure but the finer scale of the lower one clearly reveals the splitting that takes place at the second order of perturbation theory ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "the symmetry - adapted basis set was constructed by straightforward application of the projection operators @xmath96 and @xmath97 to the zeroth - order eigenfunctions ( [ eq : h0_eigenval_eigenfun ] ) ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "when @xmath98 ( @xmath99 ) we have a system of four unconfined particles with harmonic - pair interaction . in order to discuss this case",
    "it is convenient to define the new coordinates    @xmath100    because the hamiltonian operator becomes @xmath101 we appreciate that the center of mass described by the coordinate @xmath102 moves freely while there is harmonic oscillation along the 3 remaining coordinates .",
    "the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are expected to be @xmath103 where @xmath104 is a harmonic - oscillator eigenfunction .",
    "the connection between the small and large box regimes is given by @xmath105 when carrying out this limit we should take into account that the symmetry of the eigenfunction should be conserved as @xmath99 and that @xmath106 does not exhibit a definite symmetry .",
    "therefore , in order to make a connection between both regimes the eigenfunctions in the large - box case should be of the form @xmath107    in order to determine the symmetry of a given eigenfunction in the large - box limit we take into account that @xmath102 is basis for the irrep @xmath78 while the set @xmath108 is a basis for the irrep @xmath85",
    ". therefore , @xmath109 and @xmath110 are basis for the irreps @xmath76 and @xmath78 , respectively . by means of the direct product of irreps",
    "we obtain the symmetry of any eigenfunction of the form ( [ eq : psi_large_box ] ) .",
    "for example , when @xmath111 the three possible products @xmath112 are basis for @xmath85 and the resulting functions @xmath113 and @xmath114 are basis for @xmath85 and @xmath83 , respectively .",
    "in order to obtain accurate variational results for large values of @xmath115 as was done in the case of two particles@xcite we should try variational functions of the form @xmath116 , \\label{eq : psi_var_good}\\ ] ] where @xmath117 satisfies the boundary conditions at the box walls and @xmath118 $ ] provides the correct asymptotic behaviour of the wavefunction of the free oscillator .",
    "the variational parameter @xmath119 will increase from @xmath120 to infinity as @xmath38 increases from zero to infinity .",
    "however , since this calculation is rather cumbersome here we try a much simpler one with a variational function of the form @xmath121 , \\label{eq : psi_var_wrong}\\ ] ] where we clearly sacrifice the correct description of the asymptotic behaviour when @xmath99 . for example , @xmath122 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath123 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath124 \\left\\ { \\begin{array}{c } \\xi _ { 1 } \\\\ \\xi _ { 2 } \\\\",
    "\\xi _ { 3 } \\end{array } \\right.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] are expected to yield approximations to the first energy levels @xmath125 .",
    "figure  [ fig : eptvar ] shows the perturbation and variational results for those three states .",
    "both the perturbation corrections of first order and the variational approaches are upper bounds to the corresponding energies because the variational principle applies to the lowest state of each symmetry . since the perturbation expressions shown in section  [ sec : small - box ] ( @xmath126 from now on )",
    "yield the exact result when @xmath127 they are expected to be more accurate than the variational results ( @xmath128 ) for sufficiently small @xmath38 .",
    "figure  [ fig : eptvar ] reveals that @xmath129 for @xmath130 that tells us that @xmath131 is more accurate for sufficiently large values of @xmath38 . as expected , the perturbation expressions exhibit a wrong behaviour for large values of @xmath38 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath128 increases correctly as @xmath132 but the choice of an incorrect exponential factor in the trial function leads to a wrong coefficient of the leading term of the energy ; for example a numerical calculation suggests that @xmath133",
    "throughout this paper , as well as in the two earlier ones@xcite , we have shown that group theory is useful for the analysis of systems of particles in a one - dimensional box . in the present case we can label the states of the system of four particles by means of the irreps of the point group @xmath37 .",
    "the knowledge of the symmetry of the states for finite @xmath38 and for @xmath99 facilitates the analysis of the connection between the states of the confined and free systems , respectively .",
    "in addition to it , point group proves suitable for the construction of simple variational trial functions like those in section  [ sec : variational ] as well as for the construction of symmetry - adapted basis sets for more accurate calculations like the rayleigh - ritz method used in section  [ sec : small - box ] .",
