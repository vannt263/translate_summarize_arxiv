    "the highly successful kepler spacecraft is being utilised for the so - called k2 mission , a survey of a number of fields lying along the ecliptic that are accessible to the spacecraft with a reduced number of reaction wheels @xcite ; more than 10 observing campaigns are expected .",
    "the k2 mission became operational in mid-2014 , reaching a photometric precision approaching that obtained by the kepler mission .",
    "each of the k2 observing campaigns cover an approximate 80 day period , with target lists compiled from community solicitations for proposed targets .",
    "in this paper we describe contemporaneous observations of k2 field 1 with the murchison widefield array ( mwa : @xcite ) and historical ( from 2010 - 12 ) observations from the giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) tifr gmrt sky survey ( tgss ) , via the tgss alternative data release 1 ( adr1 ) @xcite .",
    "the mwa and gmrt are radio telescopes operating at low radio frequencies ( approximately 140 - 200 mhz for the work described here ) , the mwa being the low frequency precursor for the square kilometre array ( ska : @xcite ) .",
    "we describe multi - epoch observations with the mwa .",
    "the mwa s extreme field of view encompasses the entirety of the k2 field , allowing efficient monitoring of all radio sources within field 1 .",
    "we also describe historical , but significantly higher angular resolution , gmrt tgss observations .",
    "the combination of mwa and gmrt data provide a multi - epoch ( via the mwa ) and multi - resolution ( low resolution mwa and high resolution gmrt ) low radio frequency catalog for k2 field 1 .",
    "the mwa observations were also coordinated with skymapper observations of k2 field 1 .",
    "the skymapper observations will be published elsewhere ( wolf et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .    a range of mechanisms will produce variability and transient phenomena at low radio frequencies , relevant to several areas of k2 science .",
    "for example , flares from dwarf stars @xcite are expected to produce low frequency radio emission .",
    "low frequency flares similar to those observed from jupiter may be expected from exoplanets @xcite . and on longer timescales , active galactic nuclei are variable across the entire electromagnetic spectrum , including at low radio frequencies .",
    "overviews of classes of variable and transient radio sources relevant to k2 science can be found in @xcite and @xcite ( particularly for the low frequencies of the mwa and gmrt ) .",
    "k2 mission campaign 1 was conducted on field 1 ( center at ra=11:35:45.51 ; dec=+01:25:02.28 ; j2000 ) , covering the north galactic cap , between 2014 may 30 and 2014 august 21 .",
    "a target list of 21,649 targets across 76 proposals was constructed .",
    "the target list was drawn from proposals seeking to study a wide range of galactic and extragalactic populations .",
    "reduced light curves for k2 campaign 1 are available for the target list from https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/vanderb/k2.html , according to the analysis of @xcite .    in the future",
    ", the release of the mwa gleam continuum survey , covering the full observable sky from the mwa , will greatly expand the scope of the type of multi - wavelength studies described here @xcite .",
    "in particular , coupled with the gmrt tgss , detailed multi - resolution low frequency cross matching will be possible over a large fraction of the sky .",
    "further , the lofar msss survey will play a similar role in the northern hemisphere @xcite .",
    "the radio catalog is presented to support a range of multi - wavelength studies of objects within k2 field 1 .",
    "the parameters of the mwa observations are described in table 1 , 15 observations conducted over a period of approximately one month in june and july 2014 .",
    "all observations were made in a standard mwa imaging mode with a 30.72 mhz bandwidth consisting of 24 contiguous 1.28 mhz  coarse channels \" , each divided into 32  fine channels \" each of 40 khz bandwidth ( total of 768 fine channels across 30.72 mhz ) .",
    "the temporal resolution of the mwa correlator output was set to 0.5 s. all observations were made in full polarimetric mode , with all stokes parameters formed from the orthogonal linearly polarised feeds .",
    "observations were made at two centre frequencies , 154.88 mhz and 185.60 mhz , with two 296 s observations of the k2 field at each frequency on each night of observation , accompanied by observations of one of three calibrators ( centaurus a , virgo a , or hydra a ) at each frequency , with 112 s observations .",
    "the observed fields were tracked and thus , due to the fixed delay settings available to point the mwa primary beam , the tracked right ascension and declination changes slightly between different observations ( always a very small change compared to the mwa field of view ) .",
    "the total volume of mwa visibility data processed was approximately 2.2 tb .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,<,^,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     the final set of mwa images , after source finding ,",
    "yields a total of 1,085 radio sources at 154 mhz and 1,468 at 185 mhz , over 314 square degrees , at angular resolutions of @xmath04 .",
    "the gmrt images , after source finding , yields a total of 7,445 radio sources over the same field , at an angular resolution of @xmath00.3 .",
    "thus , the overall survey covers multiple epochs of observation , spans approximately 140 - 200 mhz , is sensitive to structures on angular scales from arcseconds to degrees , and is contemporaneous with the k2 observations of the field over a period of approximately one month .",
    "the resulting survey is significant in its own right , in terms of the parameter space it occupies .",
    "however , it is also interesting as the first dedicated radio survey of a k2 field",
    ". thus , the survey provides a low frequency , multi - resolution , radio component for multi - wavelength investigations of the more than 21,000 k2 targets in this field .",
    "no transient or variable radio sources were detected from the multi - epoch mwa data above a level of 3@xmath1 using our blind search technique , consistent with similar recent transient surveys of other fields at similar frequencies .",
    "for example , at low frequencies with the mwa 32-tile prototype , @xcite found no astrophysical transient radio sources at 154 mhz , placing an upper limit on the sky density of @xmath2 deg@xmath3 with flux densities @xmath45.5 jy for characteristic timescales of 26 min and 1 year .",
    "similarly , and more constraining , @xcite undertook a transient survey with the 128-tile full mwa , finding no transient sources greater than 0.285 jy at 182 mhz on timescales between 28 seconds and 1 year , with @xmath5 deg@xmath3 on the shortest timescales . with the lofar telescope ,",
    "one convincing transient event has been reported recently , by @xcite . at current flux density limits ,",
    "transient radio sources at low radio frequencies appear to be very rare .",
    "murphy et al .",
    "( 2016 , in preparation ) find a low frequency transient rate of @xmath6 per sq .",
    "deg . on timescales of 1 to 3 years , from a large - scale comparison of tgss and mwa datasets .",
    "this limit is an order of magnitude better than previous limits on these timescales .",
    "long timescale studies probe phenomena that are transient on shorter timescales , in this case ranging from stellar flares to agn .    aside from the blind transient and variability search performed here ,",
    "it is possible to examine our survey data for specific target lists , to search for radio counterparts to targets defined at other wavelengths , or to place limits on the radio emission from such targets .",
    "a significant target class for k2 observations is cool dwarf stars that can produce significant optical and radio flares , in stellar classes m , l , and t. we thus briefly examine k2 field 1 target lists in this category , as an example application of our survey data",
    ".    excellent overviews of radio emission from stars can be found in @xcite and ( in particular for flare stars , including at metre wavelengths relevant to our survey ) in @xcite .",
    "examples of strong radio flares at metre wavelengths , associated with optical flares , from dwarf stars are shown in @xcite ; radio flares at frequencies between 200 and 400 mhz , with durations of hundreds to thousands of seconds and amplitudes of hundreds of mjy , from 13 flares detected during approximately 60 hours of observations .    in the set of k2 field 1",
    "target lists , a number of approved programs targeted variable optical emission from dwarf stars , including : g01008 ( one object ) ; g01010 ( seven objects ) ; g01044 ( four objects ) ; and g01052 ( 124 objects ) .    to illustrate the use of our survey data",
    ", we took the objects defined by the target lists above and examined them against our catalogs from the mwa and gmrt observations .",
    "cross matching the k2 target list with the mwa and gmrt catalogs , we find that one of the k2 targets can be plausibly associated with a radio source in the mwa catalog .",
    "however , given the number of targets and the mwa angular resolution , we expect approximately one false match .",
    "thus , we attribute this single match to chance rather than an astrophysical association of quiescent emission with a dwarf star . for completeness",
    ", the object in question has a k2 i d of 201548872 , appearing in k2 programs go1011_sc , go1010_lc , go1060_lc , and go1075_lc ( ra=167.541711@xmath7 ; dec=1.270302@xmath7 ; mag=17.866 ) .",
    "additional mwa and gmrt data exist for other k2 fields and will be the subject of future publications .",
    "likewise , the k2 field 1 observations described in this paper were accompanied by skymapper observations ( see figure 2 ) and a comparison of the mwa , gmrt , and skymapper data is deferred to a later publication .",
