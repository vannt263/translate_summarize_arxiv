    "after the core collapse central parts of the star rotate differentially . in the presence of initial poloidal magnetic field",
    "toroidal component of the magnetic field appears and amplifies with time .",
    "when the pressure of the magnetic field becomes comparable with the gas pressure the compression wave arise and moves along steeply decreasing density profile . in a short time",
    "this compression wave transforms to the mhd fast shock wave and produces supernova explosion .",
    "first 2d simulations of the magnetorotational mechanism were made by @xcite with unrealistically large initial magnetic field .",
    "2d simulations of the similar problem were given in the papers of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the magnetorotational processes with very large initial magnetic fields ( typical for magnetars ) were recently simulated numerically in the papers of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the 1d simulations of the magnetorotational supernova were presented in the papers by @xcite , @xcite . in the last paper",

    "magnetorotational explosion with the initial dipole - like magnetic field has the shape of mildly collimated jet ( figure [ veldipquad ] , left plot ) .",
    "this jet can be collimated later when the shock wave pass through the envelope of the star .",
    "initial quadrupole - like poloidal magnetic field leads to the explosion which develops preferably near equatorial plane ( figure [ veldipquad ] , right plot ) .    in the both cases ( dipole and quadrupole initial poloidal magnetic field ) the amplification of the toroidal magnetic field leads to the formation of the compression wave , which moves along steeply decreasing density profile , and soon it transforms to the fast mhd shock wave .    for the quadrupole initial magnetic field the evolution of the magnetorotational explosion takes place much faster then for the dipole field ( figure[masenq ] , [ masend ] ) .",
    "the simulations of the magnetorotational explosion for the initial quadrupole and dipole magnetic field lead to the ejection of about @xmath7ergs of energy and about @xmath8 of mass .",
    "the amount of the ejected mass will increase with the evolution of the mhd shock .    .",
    "let @xmath9 be the ratio of the initial poloidal magnetic energy of the star and its gravitational energy at the moment of the `` turning on '' magnetic field .",
    "we have made simulations for the initial quadrupole - like magnetic field for the wide range of the initial values of the magnetic energy ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the values of the explosion energy and ejected mass are approximately the same for all calculated variants . in 1d simulations of the magnetorotational mechanism by @xcite",
    "it was shown that evolution time of the magnetorotational explosion depends on @xmath9 in the following way @xmath12 . in 2d simulations",
    "the situation as qualitatively different . due to the appearing and evolution of the magnetorotational instability , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , the time from the beginning of the amplification of the toroidal component of the magnetic field to the moment of explosion is much shorter then in the results of 1d simulations . at the figure [ texpl ]",
    ", the dependence of the time of the explosion ( which is calculated as a time from the beginning of the evolution of the magnetic field up to the moment of the beginning of supernova explosion ) from @xmath9 value is represented .",
    "for @xmath13 the @xmath14 law holds approximately , but for smaller values of @xmath9 the explosion time @xmath15 is proportional @xmath16 .",
