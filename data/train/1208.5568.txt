    "given an equivariantly formal action of a compact torus @xmath0 on a compact connected manifold @xmath1 , the by now classical chang - skjelbred lemma ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 2.3 ) states that the equivariant cohomology @xmath2 of the action ( with real coefficients ) is , as an algebra over the ring @xmath3 , determined by its 1-skeleton , i.e. , the subspace @xmath4 of points in @xmath1 whose isotropy group has codimension at most one in @xmath5 .",
    "important progress was made by goresky , kottwitz , and macpherson , who , originally in the context of algebraic actions of tori on complex projective varieties , found an explicit combinatorial description of @xmath2 in terms of the @xmath5-action on @xmath4 , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 7.2 ) .",
    "in fact , their result holds for any @xmath5-action on @xmath1 , under the additional assumptions that the fixed point set of the @xmath5-action is finite and @xmath4 is a union of @xmath6-spheres .",
    "( in the case of an orientable @xmath1 , the last condition is equivalent to the pairwise independence of the weights of the isotropy representations at the fixed points ) .",
    "the relevant data can be encoded in a graph with vertices corresponding to the fixed points and edges corresponding to the @xmath6-spheres in @xmath4 .",
    "this approach to equivariant cohomology , nowadays referred to as gkm theory , has received much attention in the last years .",
    "for example , the interplay between the combinatorics of the gkm graph and the geometry of @xmath1 has been investigated in the case when @xmath1 is symplectic and @xmath5 acts in hamiltonian fashion , see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , and also when @xmath1 is a quotient @xmath7 of two compact connected lie groups @xmath8 and @xmath9 of equal rank and @xmath5 is a maximal torus in @xmath9 , see @xcite .",
    "various versions and generalizations of gkm theory were proposed : guillemin and holm @xcite allowed the group action to have non - isolated fixed points ( in the setting of hamiltonian torus actions on symplectic manifolds ) . in @xcite , the first named author , together with nozawa and tben , considered gkm theory for cohen - macaulay torus actions , which are similar to equivariantly formal actions , but for which the fixed point set is replaced by the orbits of lowest dimension .",
    "actions of arbitrary , possibly non - abelian , topological groups on certain stratified spaces have been considered by harada , henriques , and holm in @xcite .",
    "our aim is to present a generalization of the classical gkm theory to the action of a non - abelian compact connected lie group @xmath8 on a compact connected manifold @xmath1 . as already motivated by the borel localization theorem ,",
    "see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem c.70 ) , the natural replacement for the fixed point set in this context is the space @xmath10 of points whose isotropy group has rank equal to the rank of @xmath8 . in section [ section : one ] we will show that the natural replacement of @xmath4 is the space @xmath11 of points whose isotropy rank is at most one smaller than the rank of @xmath8 , in the sense that there is a non - abelian version of the chang - skjelbred lemma involving this space , see theorem [ thm : cs ] .    having thus laid the theoretical foundation for our theory , we will , after reviewing ( a slight generalization of ) the classical gkm theory in section [ abelian ] , develop non - abelian gkm theory in sections [ sec : non - abeliansk]-[sec : non - abeliangkmgraphs ] , under the so - called _ non - abelian gkm conditions _ :",
    "the @xmath8-action is equivariantly formal .",
    "the space @xmath10 consists of finitely many @xmath8-orbits .",
    "3 .   for every @xmath12 ,",
    "the weights of the isotropy representation of @xmath13 on @xmath14 are pairwise linearly independent .",
    "we remark that these conditions are equivalent to the ordinary ( abelian ) gkm conditions for the induced action of a maximal torus of @xmath8",
    ".    our main task will be to understand the structure of the space @xmath11 .",
    "in the torus case , the gkm conditions imply that @xmath4 is always the union of two - dimensional manifolds which connect the fixed points , and on which the torus acts with one - dimensional maximal orbits ( i.e. , very simple cohomogeneity - one manifolds ) .",
    "abstractly , these can be defined as the closures of the components of @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the fixed point set . in the non - abelian",
    "setting , we will still consider the closures @xmath17 of the components of @xmath18 .",
    "although these subspaces of @xmath1 are not necessarily smooth , see remark [ rem : compnotsmooth ] , the group @xmath8 acts on them with cohomogeneity - one in the sense that their @xmath8-orbit space is homeomorphic to either a closed interval or a circle .",
    "any of the spaces @xmath17 above is of one of the following three types :    1 .",
    "the case which is most similar to that of a @xmath6-sphere in the 1-skeleton of a torus action is that of a space @xmath17 whose @xmath8-orbit space is a closed interval , with both endpoints of the interval corresponding to orbits in @xmath10 .",
    "2 .   it can happen that the @xmath8-orbit space of @xmath17 is an interval , but only one of the endpoints corresponds to an orbit in @xmath10 . in the torus case",
    "this phenomenon occurs only if one allows nonorientable manifolds ; then , there can appear real projective two - planes in @xmath4 , see section [ abelian ] .",
    "in the non - abelian setting this phenomenon is not connected to orientability , see example [ u2 ] .",
    "the case when the @xmath8-orbit space of @xmath17 is a circle can only appear if @xmath17 is not smooth , see example [ typec ] .",
    "this case has no analogue for torus actions on manifolds .",
    "the gkm graph associated to a torus action contains a vertex for each fixed point and an edge for each two - sphere in the 1-skeleton connecting the two vertices which correspond to the two fixed points in the sphere . by analogy , the vertices of the nonabelian gkm graph to be constructed in section [ sec : non - abeliangkmgraphs ]",
    "should be related to the orbits of maximal rank , and the edges to the spaces @xmath17 above . however , this simple analogy is not sufficient : for example , we see from case ( ii ) above that we need a second type of vertices representing those endpoints which correspond to orbits not contained in @xmath10 . for the detailed construction of the non - abelian gkm graph",
    ", we refer to section [ sec : non - abeliangkmgraphs ] .    a final comment concerns the effectiveness of our method for computing the @xmath19-algebra @xmath20 .",
    "this can also be done by using the well - known formula @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a maximal torus and @xmath23 the corresponding weyl group . as already pointed out , in our context",
    "the algebra @xmath2 can be expressed by means of the classical gkm theory .",
    "since the action of @xmath23 on this algebra can also be made precise , the formula above leads to concrete descriptions of @xmath20 .",
    "although such a description has in general a more complicated appearance than the one which results from our approach , it can , in principle , be reduced to that one . however , a considerable amount of work is sometimes needed to get this reduction . for a discussion of concrete examples we refer to remark [ simpler ] .",
    "perhaps even more important than the simplicity of our presentations of the equivariant cohomology algebra is their  naturality \" in the sense that they reflect closely the geometry of the action .",
    "in other words , our main concern here is not of combinatorial nature , but rather of geometric nature .",
    "let @xmath8 be a compact connected lie group of rank @xmath24 acting on a compact connected manifold @xmath1 . for each @xmath25",
    "we define @xmath26 .",

    "the chang - skjelbred lemma ( * ? ? ? * lemma 2.3 ) then states that its image is the same as the image of @xmath30 .",

    "we need some considerations concerning the ( krull ) dimension of certain ( @xmath8-equivariant cohmology ) @xmath32-modules , which will be simply denoted by @xmath33 .",
    "the following result is a slight generalization of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 4.4 ) .",
    "it can be proven with exactly the same arguments as that result ( the only new ingredient needed in the proof is the general result saying that if @xmath34 is a compact , possibly non - connected , closed subgroup of @xmath8 , then the dimension of @xmath35 over @xmath32 is equal to the rank of @xmath34 , see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",

    "we decided to include the proof here for the sake of completeness . because @xmath40 is exact",
    ", we have @xmath41 .",
    "on the other hand we have @xmath42 by lemma [ lem : dimension ] , so it follows that @xmath43 has dimension @xmath44 ( recall that , in general , depth can not exceed @xmath33 ) .",
    "since @xmath45 , the image of the natural map @xmath46 has dimension at most equal to @xmath47 , hence it is equal to 0 ( since otherwise , by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 4.3 ) , it would have dimension equal to @xmath44 ) .",
    "it follows that @xmath48 is exact .",
    "thus , an element in the kernel of @xmath49 must already lie in the kernel of @xmath50 and hence is in the image of @xmath38 .",
    "the theorem suggests that there might exist a non - abelian version of the atiyah - bredon sequence as in @xcite .",
    "however this is unclear , as to copy the proof given there one needs to know that the modules @xmath51 are cohen - macaulay of dimension @xmath52 .",
    "this is so far only proven for @xmath53 : ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 4.5 ) shows that @xmath54 is a free module over @xmath32 .",
    "in this section we review the theorem of goresky , kottwitz , and macpherson ( * ? ? ? * theorem 7.2 ) ( see also ( * ? ? ?",

    "the theory we present here is slightly more general than the classical one , in the sense that the manifold @xmath1 is not required to be orientable ; hence the connected components of the fixed point sets of ( codimension - one ) subtori of @xmath5 are not necessarily orientable .",
    "consequently , there might be two - dimensional submanifolds in the 1-skeleton that are not necessarily spheres which need to be taken into account ( see lemma [ lett ] and example [ ex : gras ] below ) : these new features are reflected in the resulting gkm graph by the presence of some stars , like for instance in figure [ fig2 ] .",

    "we now consider the mayer - vietoris sequence of the pair @xmath67 in equivariant cohomology .",
    "the map @xmath68 which arises in this sequence is identically zero , since it is a homomorphism of @xmath69-modules whose domain is a torsion module and whose range is a free module .",
    "thus the mayer - vietoris sequence splits into short exact sequences : @xmath70 as all the fixed points of the action are contained in @xmath71 , the natural restriction map @xmath72 ( which is injective by equivariant formality , see ) factors through @xmath73 .",
