    "andromeda ii ( and ii ) is a faint dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxy located approximately 10@xmath9 from the center of m31 .",
    "it was discovered , along with two other dsph companions of m31 , by van den bergh ( 1972 ) who visually searched an area of @xmath10 700 deg@xmath11 using plates taken with the palomar schmidt telescope .",
    "recently , three new m31 dsph galaxies have been discovered , bringing the total number of dsph galaxies associated with m31 to six ( armandroff , davies & jacoby 1998 ; armandroff , davies & jacoby 1999 ; karachentsev & karachenseva 1999 ) .",
    "although these systems have been studied to differing extents , existing observations suggest that they bear a remarkable similarity to the dsph galaxies which belong to the milky way ( @xmath12 , da costa et al .",

    "several curious properties of the galactic dsphs motivate the study of dsphs associated with other galaxies .",
    "first , their large central velocity dispersions indicate that they contain significant dark matter components ( aaronson 1983 ; faber & lin 1983 ; mateo 1998 ) .",
    "second , color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) studies reveal detailed and extraordinarily varied star formation histories ( da costa 1992 ; smecker - hane 1994 , stetson , hesser & smecker - hane 1998 ) .",
    "last , in many cases , the observed metallicity distribution functions indicate surprisingly wide ranges in metallicity and thus point to complex chemical enrichment histories ( canterna 1975 ; zinn 1978 ; shetrone , bolte & stetson 1998 ) .    the presence of intermediate - age stars in these galaxies complicates the derivation of metallicity distribution functions based on broad - band photometry alone . for most of the galactic dsphs , spectroscopic metallicity determinations for individual red giants are now available ( @xmath12 , da costa et al .",
    "1991 ; suntzeff et al . 1993 ; ibata et al .",
    "however , existing constraints on the metallicities of the dsphs associated with m31 come entirely from broad - band photometry ( armandroff et al . 1993 ; da costa et al . 1996 ; hopp 1999 ; grebel & guhathakurta 1999 ) . in the case of and",
    "ii , the sole metallicity determination comes from thuan - gunn @xmath2 photometry obtained with the four - shooter ccd camera on the palomar 5 m telescope ( knig et al . 1993 ; hereafter knmf ) . based on the location and width of the red giant branch ( rgb ) , these authors reported a mean metallicity of @xmath13 } } } = -1.59^{+0.44}_{-0.12}$ ] dex and an internal dispersion of @xmath14([fe / h ] ) @xmath10 0.43 dex .",
    "however , the possible existence of intermediate - age stars in this galaxy ( aaronson et al . 1985 ) raises concerns that spreads in both metallicity and age may be contributing to the observed width of the giant branch .",
    "clearly , spectroscopic information and/or ultra - deep _ hst _ imaging ( such as that presented by da costa et al .",
    "1996 for and i ) is required to break the well known  age - metallicity degeneracy \" in this and other m31 dsphs . in this paper , we investigate the chemical abundances of individual red giants in and ii using intermediate - resolution ( @xmath15  ) spectra obtained with the keck ii telescope ; this is the first such study for any dsph galaxy beyond the milky way .",
    "candidate red giants in and ii were selected from a single 600-second @xmath16 image of and ii obtained on 17 august 1996 using cosmic ( @xmath17 carnegie observatories spectroscopic multi - slit and imaging camera ; kells et al .",

    "somewhat brighter objects were added to fill the lris slit mask .",

    "the fwhm of unresolved objects in these images was measured to be 088 and 076 , respectively .",
    "the images were bias - subtracted , trimmed and flat - fielded using median sky flats obtained during twilight .",
    "profile - fitting photometry was performed using the stand - alone version of daophot ii .",
    "unfortunately , no photometric standard stars were observed on this night , so it was not possible to calibrate the lris photometry directly .",
    "instead , the keck photometry was calibrated by re - observing and ii and four landolt ( 1992 ) standard fields using the palomar 5 m telescope and cosmic on the night of 24 july 1998 . since cosmic",

    "based on the residuals between our calculated and observed @xmath16 magnitudes and @xmath22 colors of the landolt standards , we find standard deviations of 0.04 mag ( @xmath16 ) and 0.07 mag ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "two lris masks were designed containing a total of 52 slits : 28 on the first mask and 24 on the second , with two stars ( # 11 and 20 ) included on both masks . on 7 october 1996",
    ", we obtained a pair of 3600-second exposures for both masks using a 600 l / mm grating blazed at 5000  .",

    "the seeing during the observations was measured to be fwhm @xmath10 08 .",
    "following each exposure , we obtained a comparison spectrum of hg , kr and ar lamps which was subsequently used to derive the dispersion solution of the program spectra .",
    "crude radial velocities were measured by cross - correlating the spectrum of each program object against those of red giants in the globular clusters m13 , m92 and m71 .",

    "aaraonson et al . (",
    "1985 ) reported the presence of carbon stars in and ii , and suggested on this basis that and ii contains a modest fraction of intermediate - age stars .",
    "we return to the issue of intermediate - age stars in  3.2 .",
    "the primary goal of this study is the determination of spectroscopic metallicities for individual and ii red giants . to do so",

    "da costa & armandroff 1990 ) have luminosities which exceed those of the brightest red giants found in metal - poor globular clusters , so it is safe to assume that they are , in fact , intermediate - age objects which have undergone carbon dredge - up during the ascent of the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) , and not the end - products of mass - transfer evolution among compact binaries ( mcclure 1997 ) .    none of the four stars observed by aaronson et al .",

    "<S> we have obtained spectra for 50 candidate red giants in andromeda ii , a dwarf spheroidal companion of m31 , using the low resolution imaging spectrometer on the keck ii telescope . after eliminating background galaxies and galactic foreground stars , </S>",
    "<S> we are left with a sample of 42 red giants for which membership in andromeda ii can be established unambiguously from radial velocities . </S>",
    "<S> line indices measured on the lick / ids system are combined with @xmath0 photometry obtained with the keck ii and palomar 5 m telescopes to investigate the age and metallicity distribution of these stars . </S>",
    "<S> based on a comparison of the measured line indices to those of lick / ids standard stars in globular and open clusters , we derive a mean metallicity of @xmath1 } } = -1.47\\pm0.19 $ ] dex . </S>",
    "<S> this confirms earlier conclusions based on thuan - gunn @xmath2 photometry that andromeda ii obeys the familiar relation between mean stellar metallicity and galaxy luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> there is also evidence for a dispersion in metallicity of @xmath3([fe / h ] ) = @xmath4 dex based on the scatter in the measured mg@xmath5 line indices and the observed width of the galaxy s giant branch . </S>",
    "<S> we note that while existing observations of local group dwarf galaxies indicate that their mean metallicity depends rather sensitively on total luminosity , the internal _ spread _ in metallicity appears to be relatively independent of galaxy luminosity .    </S>",
    "<S> our spectroscopic sample contains one carbon star . </S>",
    "<S> we measure @xmath6 for this star , which places it below the tip of the red giant branch and suggests a common origin with the ch stars found in the galactic halo . </S>",
    "<S> although this carbon star alone does not provide evidence of an intermediate - age component in andromeda ii , two other stars in our spectroscopic sample have @xmath7 and @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> membership in andromeda ii is unambiguous in both cases , indicating that these stars fall along an extended asymptotic giant branch and pointing to the presence of a modest intermediate - age population in this galaxy . </S>"
