    "on the largest scales , the spatial distribution of galaxies exhibits the pattern of a filamentary network which is commonly referred to as the `` cosmic web '' .",
    "n - body simulations have long predicted the web - like pattern in the clustering of matter and galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , recent large galaxy surveys have confirmed its presence ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and theoretical endeavors have been able to explain the naturalness of its occurrence in the context of the cold dark matter ( cdm ) paradigm @xcite .",
    "it is now well accepted that the cosmic web is a real , natural , and common phenomenon .    nonetheless , the most crucial part has been missing for the comprehension of the cosmic web - an optimal statistical tool to quantify it .",
    "the standard n - point statistics of course can be used in principle to quantify it , but they can not capture the essence of the cosmic web that it is a nonlinear manifestation of the primordial tidal interactions .",
    "it is because in n - point statistics what is emphasized is the role of gravity in establishing the high - order correlations of the density field .",
    "the cosmic web is a nonlinear manifestation of the spatial coherence of the tidal field @xcite .",
    "thus , to quantify the cosmic web and capture its essence , it is necessary to have a statistical tool by which the role and effect of the tidal field and its spatial correlation are highlighted .",
    "patchy efforts have so far been made to account for the effect of the tidal field on structure formation .",
    "for instance , the failure of the press - schecther mass function @xcite has been attributed to the deviation of the gravitational process from spherical dynamics caused by the effect of the tidal forces @xcite .",
    "the galaxy angular momentum has been ascribed to the initial tidal interactions with the surrounding matter distribution @xcite .",
    "the intrinsic galaxy alignments are also found to be explained due to the effect of the nonlinear tidal interactions between the galaxies .",
    "the alignment and ellipticity correlation functions have been developed to quantify the preferential orientations of galaxies relative to the surrounding large - scale structure @xcite .",
    "the cosmic web , however , requires not a patchy but a unified way in which the multiple aspects of the nonlinear tidal field can be quantified .",
    "the difficulty in quantifying the effect of the tidal field lies in the fact that the correlations of the tidal field are highly anisotropic even in the linear regime . @xcite and @xcite have for the first time derived analytically the anisotropic two - point correlations of the linear tidal field .",
    "but , their results were all expressed in the fixed cartesian coordinate frame . to fully appreciate the anisotropic nature of the correlations of the tidal field",
    ", it is desirable to find the correlations of the tidal field in the principal axis frame , since the filamentary cosmic web is generated by the anisotropic collapse of matter along the principal axes of the tidal field @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , it is extremely difficult to derive analytically the correlations of even the linear tidal field in the principal axis frame which rotates from point to point .",
    "the goal of this paper is to measure numerically the anisotropic two - point correlations of the nonlinear tidal field in the principal - axis frame and to provide an analytic fitting formula as an efficient statistical tool for the description of the cosmic web .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in  2 , we provide a brief description of the numerical data . in  3 , we present the numerical results and analytic fitting formula as well . in  4 , we summarize the results and discuss the implications .",
    "we use the n - body results derived by @xcite using the tree - pm code gadget-2 @xcite .",
    "the simulations followed the evolution of @xmath2 particles starting from redshift @xmath3 to @xmath4 in a periodic box of linear size @xmath5mpc .",
    "a flat @xmath6cdm cosmology is assumed with key parameters given as @xmath7 ( matter density ) , @xmath8 ( vacuum energy density ) , @xmath9 ( baryon density ) , @xmath10 ( power spectrum amplitude ) , @xmath11 ( hubble constant ) and @xmath12 ( spectral index ) .",
    "@xcite constructed the overdensity field @xmath13 ( dimensionless density contrast ) on @xmath14 grids with the help of the cloud - in - cell interpolation method and smoothed it by a gaussian kernel with a filtering radius @xmath15 .",
    "the peculiar gravitational potential field @xmath16 was also derived from the overdensity field by solving the poisson s equation @xmath17 . in simulations ,",
    "the overdensity field is converted to the fourier space with the help of a fast fourier transform ( fft ) .",
    "the potential field is obtained as @xmath18 where @xmath19 represents the magnitude of the wave vector in the fourier space . for a detailed description of the n - body simulations and the derivation of the density and potential fields ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "for the smoothing of the density ( and potential ) fields , we use the small smoothing scale @xmath20mpc to minimize the effect of the smoothing on the determination of the correlations of the tidal fields .",
    "the tidal tensor @xmath21 is defined as the hessian of the peculiar gravitational potential @xmath22 . in fourier space , it is written as @xmath23 . using the fft again , we calculate the tidal tensor at each of the randomly selected @xmath24 grid points .",
    "the sum of the diagonal components of @xmath21 ( i.e. , the trace of the tidal field ) equals the dimensionless density contrast , @xmath13 . to sort out the true tidal effect from the gravitational effect",
    ", we calculate the traceless tidal field @xmath25 as @xmath26 where @xmath27 denotes the identity tensor .",
    "diagonalizing @xmath28 at each of the 250000 sampling points , we find its three eigenvalues , @xmath29 ( in a decreasing order , i.e. , @xmath30 ) , and the corresponding normalized eigenvectors with unit magnitude , @xmath31 .",
    "regardless of whether a given volume element is expanding or contracting ( negative or positive @xmath13 ) the traceless tidal tensor @xmath28 gives the deformation of that volume element ( relative to spherical expansion or contraction ) . by construction",
    ", we have @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the second largest eigenvalue @xmath34 can take on either sign .",
    "the maximal ( relative ) compression of a given volume element by gravity occurs along the direction parallel to @xmath35 associated with @xmath36 .",
    "figure [ fig : pro ] plots the probability density distributions of @xmath37 and @xmath38 as solid , dashed and dotted lines , respectively .",
    "the probability density distribution of @xmath39 and @xmath38 is positively and negatively skewed , respectively while that of @xmath40 is almost symmetric about zero .",
    "note that the two distributions , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , are also almost symmetric to each other around zero : @xmath43 .",
    "the distribution @xmath44 is much narrower than @xmath45 ) .    in the following section , we measure the two - point correlation functions of @xmath46 and @xmath13 in the principal - axis frame of the traceless tidal field and study their characteristic behaviors .",
    "for each pair of points located at @xmath47 and @xmath48 , we express the separation vector @xmath49 in the frame of the principal axes of @xmath50 spanned by @xmath51 } with orienting the @xmath52-axis in the direction of @xmath35 ( the first principal axis of the local tidal field ) .",
    "let @xmath53 represent the spherical polar coordinate of @xmath49 in the principal - axis frame .",
    "for every grid pair , we calculate the product , @xmath54 ( for @xmath55 ) .",
    "then , we take the average of the product over the points whose separation vectors belong to the differential bin , @xmath56 $ ] , to determine the correlation of @xmath57 as a function of @xmath58 as @xmath59    figure [ fig : iso ] shows the isotropic two - point correlations @xmath60 of the three eigenvalues of the traceless tidal field as a function of @xmath61 ( solid , dashed and dotted line for @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively ) at @xmath4 .",
    "this isotropic correlation function @xmath60 is obtained by taking the average @xmath54 over the points whose separation distances belong to the differential distance bin , @xmath64 $ ] .",
    "the tendency of @xmath60 being flat for @xmath65mpc is due to the effect of the smoothing of the tidal field .",
    "the isotropic two - point correlation of @xmath13 is also plotted for comparison ( thin solid line ) . as it can be seen , the correlations of @xmath39 and @xmath38 decrease with @xmath61 much more slowly than that of @xmath13 .",
    "in other words , the largest and smallest eigenvalues of the traceless tidal field are coherent over larger scales than the density field @xmath13 . let the correlation length scale @xmath66 correspond to the distance at which the correlation strength becomes an order of magnitude lower than its value at @xmath67 .",
    "we find that @xmath68mpc for @xmath39 and @xmath38 , while @xmath13 and @xmath40 has @xmath69mpc .",
    "the smallest eigenvalue @xmath38 has the highest amplitude at all distances , while the second largest eigenvalue @xmath40 has the lowest amplitude at @xmath70mpc .",
    "the correlation amplitude of @xmath13 is comparable to that of @xmath39 at small distance @xmath71mpc but decreases much more rapidly with @xmath61 than @xmath39 , reaching the lowest value at @xmath72mpc .    for the rescaled isotropic correlation @xmath73 , we find the following analytic formula : @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are two fitting parameters . by comparing the numerical results with the above analytic formula , we empirically determine the best - fit values of @xmath75 and @xmath76 , which are listed in table 1 .",
    "figure [ fig : lam ] shows the rescaled isotropic correlations of @xmath39 ( left ) , @xmath40 ( middle ) and @xmath38 ( right ) at @xmath4 . in each panel the dots and the solid line represent the numerical results and the analytic model with best - fit parameters , respectively .",
    "the error at each bin is calculated as one standard deviation in the measurement of the mean value .",
    "as it can be seen , the analytic models ( eqs.[[eqn : isofit1]-[[eqn : isofit2 ] ] ) fit the numerical results very well for @xmath77mpc . on smaller distances",
    "@xmath78mpc , the numerical results become flatter than the analytic curve due to the smoothing effect .",
    "figure [ fig : ani ] shows the anisotropic two - point correlations of @xmath39 ( left ) , @xmath40 ( middle ) and @xmath38 ( right ) as a function of @xmath61 and their variation with @xmath79 at @xmath4 .",
    "these anisotropic correlations @xmath80 are obtained by taking the average of @xmath54 over the points whose separation distances belong to the differential distance bin @xmath64 $ ] and at which the angles between the separation vectors and the first principal axes are in the differential range of @xmath81 $ ] . in each panel the thick solid , dashed , dotted , longdashed , dot - dashed , and dot - longdashed line correspond to the range @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 , respectively .",
    "the fluctuations of @xmath88 in the small-@xmath61 section ( @xmath89mpc ) are due to the numerical noise .",
    "the anisotropic two - point correlation of @xmath13 is also plotted for comparison as thin lines in each panel . as it can be seen , both correlations of @xmath90 and @xmath13 increase with @xmath79 in the principal - axis frame at all distances .",
    "that is , the correlations become stronger toward the directions normal to the first principal axes of the tidal field .",
    "this behavior is consistent with the scenario that matter compress maximally along the first principal axes of the tidal field and thus is more likely to lie in the plane normal to the first principal axis of the tidal field .",
    "the variation of @xmath40 with @xmath79 is stronger than that of @xmath39 and @xmath38 .",
    "note also that the degree of variation of @xmath91 with @xmath79 decreases with @xmath61 .",
    "in other words , the correlations tend to become less anisotropic at large distances ( @xmath92mpc ) .",
    "we also obtain @xmath93 by taking the average of @xmath54 over the points at which the angles between the first principal axis and the separation vectors belong to the differential angle bin , @xmath81 $ ] .",
    "the following analytic formulae are found to fit the numerical results well : @xmath94 where @xmath95 is an adjustable parameter whose best - fit value is determined via the @xmath96 statistics ( see table 1 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : ani ] shows the anisotropic correlation function of @xmath39 ( right ) , @xmath40 ( middle ) and @xmath38 ( left ) as a function of @xmath79 in the principal axis frame of the local tidal field . in each panel",
    "the dots represent the numerical results while the solid line is the analytic fitting formula .",
    "as it can be seen , the analytic models fit the numerical results very well for each case . to improve readibility",
    "we do not show errorbars which are negligibly small anyway .",
    "these results show clearly how anisotropic the correlations of the eigenvalues of the traceless tidal field are with respect to the first principal axis .",
    "the difference between the correlations at @xmath97 and @xmath98 reaches approximately @xmath99 for @xmath39 and @xmath38 , while it increases up to @xmath100 for @xmath40 .",
    "the web - like pattern in the large - scale matter distribution is an imprint produced by the effect of the nonlinear tidal field in the late universe . while the trace part of the tidal field is responsible for the collapse of matter , its traceless part deforms the cosmic volume elements , resisting the overall spherical expansion or contraction . in consequence",
    "the traceless tidal field induces anisotropy in the large - scale correlations of matter distribution .",
    "an efficient statistical tool has long been looked for to describe quantitatively this cosmic web and to retrieve cosmological information encoded in the cosmic web .",
    "we have determined numerically the two - point correlations of the three eigenvalues of the nonlinear traceless tidal field defined as the hessian of the gravitational potential in the frame of the principal axes of the tidal field .",
    "the numerical findings indicate that the correlation functions of the traceless tidal field and the density field are all anisotropic relative to the principal axes .",
    "their correlations having much larger correlation length scales than that of the density field .",
    "increase along the directions normal to the first principal axes of the tidal field .",
    "the analytic fitting formula for the correlation functions of the three eigenvalues of the tidal field are determined and found to fit the numerical results well .",
    "our numerical and analytical results are thus able to provide a physical description of the large - scale filamentary structure .      j.l .",
