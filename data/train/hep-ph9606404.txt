    "a theoretical study of the heavy - to - light transitions is more complicated than heavy - to - heavy ones because of the heavy quark symmetry can not be applied in this case .",
    "the results of nonperturbative calculations made within lattice qcd @xcite-@xcite , qcd sum rules @xcite-@xcite , and various quark models @xcite-@xcite are seemed to be rather different each other to give a reliable conclusion about the behavior of the form factors in the physical region .",
    "nevertheless , such calculations may be useful for our understanding what is really important under description of the heavy - to - light transitions .",
    "one has to remark that the most of mentioned approaches allows one to calculate the values of the form factors at some fixed point of @xmath0 , the momentum transfer squared , and then to adopt some simple shape for getting @xmath0 dependence in the full physical region .",
    "the lattice calculations give the form factors near @xmath7 and then extrapolate them to @xmath5 using polelike dependence .",
    "the qcd sum rules method allows one to give the reliable results at @xmath5 and then also the pole dominance hypothesis is used for extrapolating them to physical region .",
    "the @xmath0-dependence have been obtained by using the qcd sum rules method in the paper @xcite .",
    "it was found that the pole dominance dependence is a good approximation for the vector form factors whereas this approximation is not applicable for the axial form factors . in the nonrelativistic constituent quark model",
    "@xcite the form factors , computed with the overlap integral of the nonrelativistic meson wave functions , have the exponential @xmath0 dependence .",
    "the quasipotential approach @xcite predicts similar behavior .",
    "the @xmath0 dependence of the relevant form factors was derived from the independent quark model @xcite with a scalar - vector - harmonic potential .",
    "some nonrelativistic @xcite and relativistic @xcite quark models adopt polelike ( monopole , dipole , ... ) ansatz for the @xmath0 dependence of the form factors .",
    "the dispersion relations incorporating with the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) and chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) @xcite , with the light - cone model @xcite , with the crossing symmetry and qcd perturbative calculation in unphysical kinematic region @xcite have been used for studying the form factors . in the paper @xcite",
    "heavy - light form factors have been analyzed within approach incorporating hqet , chpt and vector meson dominance ( vmd ) model .",
    "therefore it may be seen that a completely consistent calculation of the heavy - to - light form factors in the full physical region of the momentum transfer squared is a problem not only for the approaches based on the first principles of qcd but also for various quark models .",
    "the polelike @xmath0 dependence usually used for the form factors should be at least justified from the more deep physical representations .",
    "the present work is devoted to the calculation of the form factors describing the heavy - to - light transitions within a relativistic quark model with confined light quarks and infrared heavy quark propagators @xcite .",
    "our previous approach @xcite was based upon the quark confinement model ( qcm ) which incorporates the confinement of light quarks by devising a quark propagator that has no singularities , thus forbidding the production of a free quark @xcite .",
    "this model then allows one to perform covariant calculations of feynman diagrams with dressed light quark propagators free of simple pole .",
    "it was shown that the qcm approach successful in many static and non - static properties of the light hadrons @xcite . in the paper",
    "@xcite the infrared behavior of the heavy quark has been taken into account by modifying its conventional propagator in terms of a single parameter @xmath1 .",
    "the weak decay constants and the isgur - wise function have been calculated .    here",
    "we slightly modify the inclusion of the infrared behavior of the heavy quark in a such way to provide the conservation of local properties of feynman diagrams like gauge invariance and the ward - takachashi identity .",
    "we investigate the dependence of the heavy - to - light form factors on two parameters : the infrared parameter @xmath1 and the mass difference of the heavy meson and heavy quark @xmath2 .",
    "we found that the values of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 form factors at @xmath5 are in excellent agreement with the available experimental data and other approaches whereas these values for @xmath6 transitions are found to be larger those of several other models .",
    "the obtained form factors are used to calculate the widths of the semileptonic decays of b and d mesons .",
    "we compare our results with the available experimental data and other approaches .",
    "our approach is based on the effective interaction lagrangian which describes the transition of hadron into quarks .",
    "for example , the transition of heavy meson @xmath8 into heavy @xmath9 and light @xmath10 quarks may be described by @xmath11       f\\ ! \\biggl [ ( \\!x_1\\!-\\!x_2\\!)^2 \\!\\biggr]\\ ! \\bar q(x_1 ) \\gamma_h",
    "\\lambda_h q(x_2)\\!+\\!{\\rm h.c.}\\ ] ] here , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the gell - mann and dirac matrices , respectively , which provide the flavor and spin numbers of mesons @xmath8 .",
    "the function @xmath14 characterizes the smearing of interaction between a hadron and quarks .    the coupling constants @xmath15 defined by what is usually called the _ compositeness condition _ which means that the renormalization constant of the meson field is equal to zero : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the derivative of the meson mass operator .",
    "it is readily seen that in the heavy quark limit @xmath18 the eq.([la ] ) becomes as @xmath19 q(x_2)+{\\rm h.c.}\\ ] ] which means the light degrees of freedom are factorized out from the heavy ones in according to the heavy quark symmetry .",
    "one has to remark that the function @xmath14 characterizing the long distance contributions is related to the light quark only in this limit .",
    "it leades to the modification of the light quark propagator in the momentum space : @xmath20 in the paper @xcite the monopole function @xmath21 has been used for calculations of physical values .",
    "but in this case the physical amplitudes had the threshold corresponding to quark production . in our approach",
    "@xcite an entire ( nonpole ) function has been used for a single light quark propagator to ensure the quark confinement .",
    "@xmath22\\ ] ] with the functions @xmath23 and @xmath24 being defined by @xmath25    to conserve the local properties of feynman diagrams like the ward identities , we had used the following prescription for the modification of a line with n - light quarks within the feyman diagram : @xmath26    in qcm we had used a simple choice of the confinement functions @xcite @xmath27 the parameters @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 have been determined from the best model description of hadronic properties at low energies and the following values were found @xcite : @xmath31 which describe various physical observable quite well @xcite .    since a heavy quark ( with mass @xmath32 ) in a heavy meson is under the influence of soft gluons ( which sets the scale @xmath33 ) , it may be regarded as nearly on its mass - shell where the infrared regime should take place for its propagation .",
    "the infrared behavior for one - fermion green s function ( propagator ) has been investigated in various papers ( see , for instance , @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "the result is well - known only for abelian gauge theories : @xmath34 where @xmath35 with @xmath36 being the gauge parameter .",
    "we have chosen @xcite the heavy quark propagator as in eq.([prinf ] ) to calculate the weak decay constants and the isgur - wise function .",
    "but as it is readily seen the using of such kind of propagators in the feynman diagrams destroys some local relations like ward identity which based on the obvious equality @xmath37    in this paper we suggest to take into account the infrared behavior of the heavy quarks by slightly different way which nevertheless allows one to conserve the local properties of the feynman diagrams .",
    "we shall use the infrapropagator for a single heavy quark line in a diagram : @xmath38 here @xmath32 is the constituent mass of a heavy quark and @xmath39    but we will use the prescription for a line with n heavy quarks analogous to those used in eq.([pod ] ) for averaging of light quarks : @xmath40    let @xmath41 be the structural integral corresponding to the feynman diagram with n heavy quark local propagators .",
    "it is readily seen that the taking into account the infrared behavior according to eqs.([ip1],[ip2],[ip3 ] ) gives @xmath42 this means that we can calculate the integral corresponding to feynman diagram with the local heavy quark propagators and then apply the averaging according to eq.([sigm ] ) to take into account the infrared behavior .",
    "first , we introduce the necessary notation . we will write @xmath43 for light pseudoscalar meson and @xmath44 for light vector meson with the masses @xmath45 and @xmath46 respectively",
    ". we will write @xmath8 for heavy pseudoscalar meson with a mass @xmath47 .    in what follows",
    "we assume that all masses and momenta in the structural integrals are given in units of @xmath48 .",
    "the invariant amplitudes for @xmath49 and @xmath50 transitions are defined as @xmath51 where @xmath52 here @xmath53 the integrals like ( [ i3 ] ) , ( [ i4 ] ) , ( [ i5 ] ) are calculated by using the standard feyman @xmath54  parametrization and the prescriptions ( [ fk ] ) and ( [ sigm ] ) to integrate over @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively .",
    "the explicit expressions for the form factors are given in appendix .",
    "the hadron - quark coupling constants for light pseudoscalar and vector mesons and heavy pseudoscalar mesons determined from the compositeness condition ( [ z_h ] ) are written down @xmath57 the functions @xmath58 are shown in appendix .",
    "we have two adjustable parameters in our approach : the difference between the heavy meson and heavy quark masses @xmath59 and the parameter @xmath1 characterizing the infrared behavior of heavy quark .",
    "we will adjust them by fitting the available experimental data for branching ratios of d - meson decays .",
    "the results of fit are given in table 1 .",
    "one has to remark that the allowed regions for the adjustable parameters are quite narrow : the parameter e varies from 0.315 up to 0.415 gev whereas the infrared parameter @xmath1 varies from 0.6 up 0.7 . in what follows we will give our results for e=0.365 gev and @xmath1=0.65 .",
    "this set of the parameters seems to be best for describing the available experimental data .",
    "our results for @xmath60 and @xmath61 in this case are @xmath62    the magnitudes of form factors of the @xmath63 at @xmath5 are given in table 2 .",
    "one can see that our results are in good agreement with the experimental data and other approaches .",
    "the dependence on the momentum transfer squared is shown in fig.1 and fig.2 .    the results for the form factors and decay widths of b - meson are given in tables 3 and 4 by using the values of adjustable parameters obtained above .",
    "it is seen that the values of the form factors at @xmath5 are substantially larger those obtained in qcd sum rules @xcite @xcite and quark models @xcite-@xcite but close to the results of papers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for @xmath64 . in the latter",
    "it was found that using the heavy quark symmetry and assuming pole dominance for the form factors , @xmath65 is estimated to be @xmath66 0.39 .",
    "if the requirement of heavy quark symmetry is weaken so that it applies only to soft pion emissions from the heavy meson , one finds @xmath67 .",
    "recently , the cleo collaboration @xcite claims the following results for semileptonic @xmath68 decays branching ratios and @xmath69 : @xmath70 one has to note that the branching fractions for @xmath71 and @xmath72 have been obtained by using a variety of models . what is given in eq .",
    "( [ cleo ] ) is just the average value of the branching fractions obtained for each model .",
    "the errors are statistical , systematic and the estimated model dependence .",
    "the values for @xmath73 were extracted from the branching fractions using @xmath74 ps . to obtain @xmath75 ,",
    "the @xmath76 and @xmath77 modes were combined by fixing their ratio to the prediction for each model .",
    "this means that it is not easy to use these results for checking predictions of other models .",
    "nevertheless , we extract the values @xmath78 from eq .",
    "( [ cleo ] ) and put them without errors in table 4 .",
    "as one expects our predictions are almost twice larger those values obtained in a such manner . at the same time the ratio @xmath76/@xmath77 is in a good agreement with the experimental result .    the @xmath0 dependence of form factors is shown in fig .",
    "one can see from fig.1 - 3 that the behavior of the form factors @xmath79 and @xmath80 in the physical regions of the momentum transfer squared ( @xmath81 for the d - meson decay and @xmath82 for the b - meson decay ) agrees quite well with @xmath0 dependence of the monopole form factor . at the same time the behavior of the form factors @xmath83 and @xmath84 is rather different from the monopole function and similar to the prediction of qcd sum rules @xcite .",
    "we have slightly modified our previous work @xcite to take into consideration the infrared behavior of the heavy quark in consistent way to provide the conservation of local properties of feynman diagrams like gauge invariance and the ward - takachashi identity .",
    "the infrared behavior of the heavy quark is modelled in terms of a single parameter @xmath1 which modifies the simple free feynman propagator .",
    "we have investigated the dependence of the heavy - to - light form factors calculated within this approach on two parameters : the infrared parameter @xmath1 and the mass difference of the heavy meson and heavy quark @xmath2 .",
    "we found that the values of the @xmath3 or @xmath85 form factors at @xmath5 are in excellent agreement with the available experimental data and other approaches whereas these values for @xmath6 transitions are found to be larger than those of several other models .",
    "we have used the obtained form factors to calculate the widths of the semileptonic decays of b and d mesons .",
