    "next we apply this procedure to the study of hot / dense matter .",
    "as we noted in the beginning of this subsection , the bare parameters are determined by integrating out high frequency modes above the matching scale .",

    "the intrinsic temperature and/or density dependences are nothing but the signature that the hadron has an internal structure constructed from the quarks and gluons .",
    "this is similar to the situation where the coupling constants among hadrons are replaced with the momentum - dependent form factor in the high - energy region .",
    "thus the intrinsic temperature / density effects play more important roles in higher temperature / density region , especially near the phase transition point .",
    "it should be noticed that there is no longer lorentz symmetry in matter , and the lorentz non - scalar operators such as @xmath73 may exist in the expressions of the ope current correlators .",
    "however , we neglect the contributions from these operators since such effects are suppressed by powers of the matching scale  @xcite .",
    "thus it is a good approximation that we determine the bare parameters at non - zero temperature / density through the matching conditions with putting possible temperature / density dependences on the quark and gluon condensates : @xmath74 through the matching conditions , the temperature / density dependences of those condensates determine the intrinsic effects of the bare parameters , which are then converted into those of the on - shell parameters through the wilsonian rges .",

    "we consider the quantity @xmath76 which is a measure of the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in qcd . here",
    "we assume that the quark condensate approaches zero when the restoration point is approached from the broken phase : the phase transition is of second order .",
    "in such a case , as we can easily see in eq .",
    "( [ cc - ope - vac ] ) , @xmath76 in the ope approaches zero as @xmath77 this condition @xmath78 should be also satisfied in the eft .",
    "we thus impose that these current correlators approach each other at the bare level , which implies @xmath79 for @xmath80 .",
    "we require that this equality is satisfied at an arbitrary momentum scale @xmath81 near the matching scale @xmath41 .",
    "this can be satisfied only when the following conditions for the bare parameters are met : @xmath82 for @xmath80 .",

    "we should note that eq  ( [ vm - cond ] ) is realized due to the intrinsic @xmath85 effects introduced through the wilsonian matching .",
    "it was shown  @xcite that these conditions are protected by the fixed point of the rges ( see also eq .",
    "( [ rge ] ) in the next section ) and never receives quantum corrections at the critical point .",
    "thus the parametric vector meson mass determined at the on - shell of the vector meson also vanishes since it is proportional to the vanishing gauge coupling constant .",
    "the vector meson mass @xmath86 defined as a pole position of the full vector meson propagator has the hadronic corrections through thermal / dense loops , which are proportional to the gauge coupling constant  @xcite .",
    "consequently the vector meson pole mass also goes to zero for @xmath80 : @xmath87 by performing the matching to @xmath88 near the critical point and using the fact that the vanishing gauge coupling constant is the fixed point of the rge , we find that _",
    "the @xmath0 meson mass drops as the chiral condensate _ ; @xmath89 for @xmath90 .",

    "it has been shown that the vector dominance ( vd ) of the electromagnetic form factor of the pion  @xcite is accidentally satisfied in @xmath33 qcd at zero temperature and zero density , and that it is strongly violated in large @xmath32 qcd when the vm occurs  @xcite .",

    "in hot / dense matter , the parameter @xmath20 is modified by medium effects and approaches unity with increasing @xmath85 toward the critical point , which is due to the intrinsic @xmath85 effects associated with the chiral symmetry restoration  @xcite .",
    "this implies that _ the vd is strongly violated near the critical point , maximally 50 % _ , and it strongly affects the understanding of experiments on the dilepton productions based on the dropping @xmath0 as recently pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the following sections",

    "was made by applying the matching scheme developed in the vacuum  @xcite and at the critical temperature  @xcite .    in the notion of the wilsonian matching to define a bare theory in hot environment , the bare parameters are dependent on temperature , which are referred as the intrinsic temperature effects . at low temperatures",
    "the chiral properties of in - medium hadrons are dominated by ordinary hadronic loop corrections .",

    "associated with the dropping @xmath0 , the form factor becomes sharp .",

    "the form factor and consequently the dilepton production rate with taking account of the violated vd are reduced and exhibit an obvious difference near @xmath98 compared to those with the vd .",

    "the intrinsic temperature effect comes in at @xmath100 and provides a more rapid decreasing of @xmath155 than @xmath193 .",
    "this variation reaches about 40% at @xmath201 and eventually causes a precise difference of the production rate by factor @xmath197 .",
    "several comments are in order :    the hls lagrangian has only pions and vector mesons as physical degrees of freedom , and a time evolution was not considered in this work .",
    "thus it is not possible to make a direct comparison of our results with experimental data .",
    "however a _ naive _ dropping @xmath86 formula , i.e. , @xmath202 , as well as vd in hot / dense matter are sometimes used for theoretical implications of the data . as we have shown in this paper ,",
    "the intrinsic temperature effects together with the violation of the vd give a clear difference from the results without including those effects .",
    "it may be then expected that a field theoretical analysis of the dropping @xmath0 as presented in this work and a reliable comparison with dilepton measurements will provide an evidence for the in - medium hadronic properties associated with the chiral symmetry restoration , if complicated hadronization processes do not wash out those changes .",
    "our analysis can be applied to a study at finite density . especially to study under the conditions for sps and future gsi",
    "/ fair should be addressed as an important issue .",
    "in such a dense environment , the particle - hole configurations with same quantum numbers with pions and @xmath0 mesons are crucial  @xcite .",
    "the violation of the vd has been also presented at finite density in the hls theory  @xcite .",
    "therefore the dilepton rate as well as the form factor will be much affected by the intrinsic density effects and be reduced above the `` flash density '' .",
    "recently the chiral perturbation theory with including vector and axial - vector mesons as well as pions has been constructed  @xcite based on the generalized hls  @xcite . in this theory the dropping @xmath0 and @xmath203 meson masses were formulated and it was shown that the dropping masses are related to the fixed points of the rges which gives a vm - type restoration and that the vd is strongly violated also in this case .",
