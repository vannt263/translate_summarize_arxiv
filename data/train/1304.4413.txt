    "the potentially problematic flavor - changing neutral - currents ( fcncs ) for @xmath0-@xmath5 and @xmath6-@xmath7 mixings are forbidden , but certain amounts of fcncs could still be allowed while keeping the consistency with experimental data .",
    "for example , neutral cp - even and cp - odd scalars can have large @xmath8 elements of yukawa couplings , which may enhance the top forward - backward ( fb ) asymmetry ( @xmath3 ) at the tevatron .",
    "the strong constraints from lhc can be accommodated thanks to the destructive interference among the scalars  @xcite .",
    "the charged higgs boson , which is necessarily present in the multi - higgs - doublet models , does not have sizable contribution to the top quark production at hadron colliders , but may have large couplings to the bottom quark because of theoretical consequences .",
    "this indicates that the models could strongly be constrained by @xmath0 physics .",
    "for example , the @xmath9 element of the charged higgs , which has strong correlation with the @xmath10 coupling of the pseudoscalar boson , is constrained by @xmath11 .",
    "similarly , the large @xmath12 element of the charged higgs corresponding to the large @xmath13 coupling of the pseudoscalar boson could significantly modify the branching ratios for the semileptonic @xmath0 decays , @xmath14 .",
    "recently , the babar collaboration announced interesting experimental results for the semileptonic @xmath0 decays , @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "the ratios @xmath15 defined by the branching ratios for @xmath16 to those for @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) , @xmath19 are @xmath20 and @xmath21 at babar  @xcite .",
    "these values deviate from the standard model ( sm ) predictions , @xmath22 @xcite and @xmath23 @xcite , by @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively  @xcite . combining @xmath26 and @xmath27",
    ", one finds that the discrepancy becomes about @xmath28  @xcite , which might be an evidence of new physics .",
    "( the recent lattice calculation relaxes the deviation in @xmath26 @xcite . )",
    "motivated by this babar discrepancy , new physics scenarios are widely discussed and one good candidate for new physics is a charged higgs boson in the extended sm with extra higgs doublets  @xcite .    the average value of the branching ratio for the leptonic @xmath0 decay , @xmath11 , which was measured at babar  @xcite and bell  @xcite , is @xmath29  @xcite . although there are some uncertainties from @xmath30 and the @xmath0 meson decay constant @xmath31 in the sm calculation , this measurement is slightly inconsistent with the sm prediction , for example , @xmath32 given by the utfit collaboration  @xcite .",
    "however , the recent belle measurement @xmath33 by making use of a hadronic tagging method for tau decays with the full data sample  @xcite is consistent with the sm prediction and the combination of the two is also consistent within uncertainties . since the same new physics ( e.g. , a charged higgs boson ) may affect both the semileptonic and leptonic @xmath0 decays , combined analysis of the @xmath0 decays",
    "will strongly constrain such a new physics scenario .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors investigated if the multi - higgs - doublet models can explain the discrepancies in the @xmath0 semileptonic decays while keeping consistency with @xmath34 .",
    "then they discussed the possibility that the allowed parameter region can achieve the large enough @xmath35 which was observed at the tevatron . in this paper , we summarize the results and more explicitly estimate the upper bound on the enhancement of @xmath35 in the scalar - exchanging scenario .    the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : setup ] , we give a brief review of our models proposed in ref .",
    "we assign flavor - dependent @xmath36 charges to the rh up - type quarks and introduce extra @xmath36-charged higgs doublets in order to write yukawa couplings for the up - type quarks including top quark . in sec .",
    "[ sec : top fb ] , we discuss the top fb asymmetry in our models , and show the favored parameters to enhance @xmath35 . sec .",
    "[ sec : b ] is devoted to the constraints on especially our two - higgs - doublet model ( 2hdm ) from the @xmath0 decays .",
    "then , we summarize our results in sec .  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "one of the interesting extensions of the sm is to add extra higgs doublets to the sm , for examples , two - higgs - doublet model ( 2hdm ) . in general",
    ", such an extension generates the fcnc problem at tree level through neutral higgs mediation unless each up- and down - type quark couples only with one higgs doublet .",
    "this flavor problem can be avoided by controlling the flavor structures of yukawa couplings .",
    "a simple way is to assign a new symmetry to extra higgs and matter fields .",
    "the most popular symmetry is to introduce an extra @xmath38 symmetry with soft breaking terms  @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite , the authors proposed gauged @xmath36 symmetry to the sm fermions instead of @xmath38 symmetry .",
    "then extra higgs doublets charged under @xmath36 should be introduced to generate proper mass terms of sm fermions charged under @xmath36 .",
    "especially , in ref .",
    "@xcite , models where only rh up - type quarks are charged flavor - dependently under @xmath36 was proposed . then , only fcncs involving the top quark can be enhanced . in these models ,",
    "interactions between the higgs doublets charged under @xmath36 and the rh up - type quarks are given in the form @xmath39 here @xmath40 are charged under @xmath36 .",

    "( [ eq : yukawa ] ) , there may , in general , be up to four higgs doublets : @xmath41 and @xmath42 , but the number of higgs doublets depend on the @xmath36 charge assignment . in ref .",

    "we identify @xmath45 and @xmath46 as @xmath41 and @xmath47 as @xmath48 , while in the 3hdm , @xmath45 as @xmath48 , @xmath46 as @xmath41 , and @xmath47 as @xmath49 , respectively .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the yukawa couplings of ( pseudo)scalars and charged higgs are calculated explicitly , and we notice that the form of yukawa couplings in eq .",
    "( [ eq : yukawa ] ) realizes large @xmath8 yukawa couplings because of the top mass .",
    "the other elements are suppressed by the light quark masses .",
    "we can expect that the large @xmath10 and @xmath13 couplings of ( pseudo)scalars enhance @xmath3 and achieve the babar discrepancy .",

    "@xcite , the bound from the same - sign top - quark pair production can be relaxed if destructive interferences work among the contributions from each mediator . especially , in the case that one cp - even scalar and one pseudoscalar have the same @xmath10 couplings and the same masses , the contributions of the scalars totally cancel each other , and @xmath69 becomes zero , if the contributions of the other mediators to @xmath69 are negligible .",

    "@xmath70 is the @xmath10 coupling of the cp - even scalar and the pseudoscalar , and the ( pseudo)scalar mass @xmath71 is heavier ( lighter ) than @xmath72 gev for the blue ( red ) points . we see that @xmath70 should be around one and @xmath71 should be as small as possible . if the mass is too light compared with top quark mass , the branching ratio for the top quark decaying to @xmath73 will be modified .",
