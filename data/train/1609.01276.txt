    "* what is the distribution of the commutator map ( [ cm ] ) ?    in @xcite shalev conjectured that for a finite non - commutative simple group @xmath0 the distribution of ( [ cm ] ) is approximately uniform , i.e. , @xmath12 in a well defined quantitative sense ( i.e. , in a family of groups of growing size ) .",
    "this conjecture is wide open @xcite .",

    "for example  see figure [ dim - irrsp6_5 ] for illustration  it is known dl , lu1 that the dimensions of the irreducible representations of @xmath16 are given by some `` universal '' set of polynomials in @xmath20 in this case the degrees of these polynomials give a natural partition of @xmath21 according to order of magnitude of dimensions@xmath22 since the dimension of the representation of a group @xmath0 is what appears in the denominator of ( [ c - r ] ) , it seems reasonable to expect that  in ( [ c - s ] )    * ( a ) * _ character ratios of lower dimensional representations tend to contribute larger terms_.    * ( b ) * _ the partial sums over low dimensional representations of `` similar '' size exhibit cancellations . _    a significant amount of numerical data collected recently with cannon and goldstein supports assertions ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "for example , in figure [ cr - t - sp6_5 ] we plot the numerical values of the character ratios of the irreducible representations of @xmath23 evaluated at the transvection @xmath17 ( [ tr ] ) .",
    "more precisely , for each @xmath24 we marked by a circle the point the nearest integer value to a real number @xmath25 @xmath26 and find that the overall picture is in agreement with ( a ) and ( b )",
    ". moreover  see figures [ dim - irrsp6_5 ] and cr - t - sp6_5 for illustration  the numerics shows that , although the majority of representations are `` large '' , their character ratios tend to be so small that adding all of them contributes very little to the entire ore sum ( [ c - s ] ) .",
    "the above example illustrates that a possible obstacle to getting group theoretical properties by summing over characters , as in formula ( [ o - sum ] ) , is lack of control over the representations with relatively small dimensions .",
    "in particular , it seems that a systematic knowledge on the * `` small '' * representations of finite classical groups could lead to proofs of some important open conjectures , which are currently out of reach .",

    "we develop a language suggesting that the small representations of the finite classical groups can be systematically described by studying their restrictions to unipotent subgroups , and especially , using the notion of * rank * of a representation @xcite .",

    "we conjecture that our construction is exhaustive .",

    "let us start with the numerical example of the dimensions of the irreducible representations of the group @xmath28 the beginning of the list appears in figure [ numerical - dim - irrsp6_5 ] .",
    "these numbers  see also figure [ dim - irrsp6_5]reveal the story of the hierarchy in the world of representations of finite classical groups .",

    "we will not attempt to define the `` big '' representations at this stage , but in figure [ numerical - dim - irrsp6_5 ] the ones of dimension @xmath34 and above fall in that category .",
    "however , relatively little seems to be known about the representations of the classical groups which are in the range between `` minimal '' and `` big '' @xcite .  in figure numerical - dim - irrsp6_5 those form the layer of @xmath35 representations of dimensions between @xmath36 and @xmath37    in this section we introduce a language that will enable us to define the `` small '' representations of finite classical groups .",
    "this language will extend well beyond the notion of minimal representations and will induce a partition of the set of isomorphism classes of irreducible representations which is closely related to the hierarchy afforded by dimension .",

    "that is , @xmath81 if @xmath82 and @xmath83  define equivalent symmetric bilinear forms on @xmath42 .    the first major invariant of a symmetric bilinear form is its rank .",

    ", we can reorganize the expansion ( [ ft1 ] ) of @xmath93 namely , we split the sum according to the ranks of characters , and within each rank we split the sum into two partial sub - sums according to the two isomorphism classes of the associated forms:@xmath94note that , formula ( [ ft2 ] ) implies , by evaluation at the identity of @xmath60 , that the dimension of @xmath8 must be@xmath95i.e .",

    "in particular , using standard formulas @xcite for @xmath105 @xmath106 and @xmath107 we obtain @xmath108      from ( [ card2 ] ) we get , in particular , that the smallest non - trivial orbits are those of rank one forms . using ( [ card1 ] ) we see that these have size @xmath109 it follows from this that the smallest possible dimension of a non - trivial irreducible representation @xmath8 of @xmath52 should satisfy@xmath110indeed , we have the following lemma :    [ trivial]the only irreducible representation of @xmath52 with @xmath60-spectrum concentrated at zero is the trivial one .",
    "the proof of lemma [ trivial ] is easy , but to avoid interrupting this discussion , we defer it to appendix [ p - of - lemma - trivial ] .    a representation whose dimension attaining the lower bound ( [ lowestdim ] ) would contain each rank one character of one type , and nothing else . since @xmath111 is such a small subgroup of @xmath52 , it is unclear whether to expect such a representation to exist . in particular , it would be irreducible already on the siegel parabolic @xmath53 , and it would be the smallest possible faithful representation of @xmath53 .",

    "the existence of the above smallest possible representations , plus considerations of tensor products , tell us that , for any orbit @xmath115 in @xmath70 there will be representations of @xmath52 whose @xmath60-spectrum contains the given orbit , together with orbits of smaller rank . since the size  see formulas ( [ card1 ] ) and",
    "( [ card2])of the orbits @xmath115 is increasing rapidly with @xmath116 , representations whose @xmath60-spectrum is concentrated on orbits of smaller rank can be expected to have smaller dimensions .",
    "this motivates us to introduce the following key notion in our approach for small representations .",
    "let @xmath8 be a representation of @xmath117    1 .",
    "we say that @xmath8 is of @xmath118 denoted @xmath119 iff the restriction @xmath120 contains characters of rank @xmath116 , but of no higher rank .",

    "let us convey some intuition for this notion using numerical data obtained for the irreducible representations of the group @xmath124see figure [ ranksp6_5 ] .",
    "the computations of the multiplicities and rank in this case reveal a striking compatibility with the families of representations appearing in the list of figure [ numerical - dim - irrsp6_5 ] .",
    "for example , it shows that the trivial representation is the one with rank @xmath125 the @xmath29 components of the two oscillator representations are those of rank @xmath126 and they split into @xmath30 of type @xmath127 and @xmath30 of type @xmath128 the @xmath35 representations of dimensions between @xmath129 and @xmath130 are the ones of rank @xmath131 and they split into @xmath132 of type @xmath133 and @xmath134 of type @xmath135 ; and above that the `` big '' representations are those with rank @xmath136    the main quest now is for a systematic construction of the `` low rank '' irreducible representations . in the next section",
    "we take the first step toward that goal by treating the smallest non - trivial representations of @xmath52 which are of rank @xmath126see propositions [ smallest ] and [ next ] .",
    "where do the smallest representations of @xmath52 come from ?",
    "a conceptual answer to this question was given by weil in @xcite .",
    "they can be found by considering the heisenberg _ _  _ _ group .",

    "moreover , the commutator operation in @xmath141 induces a skew - symmetric bilinear form on @xmath142 that coincides with the original symplectic form .",
    "the group @xmath143 is the analog over a finite field of the lie group associated with the canonical commutation relations ( ccr ) of werner heisenberg , of uncertainty principle fame .",
    "we would like to describe the representation theory , i.e. , the irreducible representations , of the heisenberg group .",
    "this theory is simultaneously simple and deep , with fundamental connections to a wide range of areas in mathematics and its applications .",

    "then , by schur s lemma , the center @xmath139 will act by scalars@xmath145where @xmath146 is the the identity operator on the representation space of @xmath144 , and @xmath147 is a character of @xmath148 called the _ central character _ of @xmath144 .",
    "if @xmath149 then @xmath144 factors through @xmath142 , which is abelian , so @xmath144 is itself a character of @xmath47 the case of non - trivial central character is described by the following celebrated theorem @xcite :    up to equivalence , there is a unique irreducible representation @xmath150 with given non - trivial central character @xmath65 in @xmath151    we will call the ( isomorphism class of the ) representation @xmath152 the _ heisenberg representation _ associated to the central character @xmath153    there are many ways to realize ( i.e. , to write explicit formulas for ) @xmath154 @xcite . in particular , it can be constructed as induced representation from any character extending @xmath65 to any maximal abelian subgroup of @xmath143 @xcite . to have a concrete one , note that the inverse image in @xmath143 of any lagrangian subspace of @xmath155 will be a maximal abelian subgroup for which we can naturally extend the character @xmath65 .",

    "this is also the reason we use a related ,    although different , notation for the correspondence ( [ eta ] ) .",
    "finally , we would like to make the following remark on the generality of our work .",
    "the notion of rank for the group @xmath271 over local fields was described in @xcite .",
    "the theory for general classical groups over local fields was developed by li in @xcite , and it was extended to all semi - simple algebraic groups over local fields by salmasian in @xcite .",
    "the development of the eta correspondence ( [ eta ] ) for all finite classical groups will be discussed in future publications . for expositional purposes , in this note",
    "we describe only the case of the finite symplectic groups .",
    "conjecture [ exhaustion ] is backed up by numerical data collected for the groups @xmath272 @xmath273 ; @xmath274 , @xmath275 and @xmath276    indeed , the magma computations done with cannon and goldstein , for the various sizes of symplectic groups , repeatedly confirm the assertion made in the exhaustion conjecture , i.e. , identity ( [ ex ] ) .",
    "for example , the number of conjugacy classes in the orthogonal groups @xmath277 and @xmath278 together is @xmath279 each contributes @xmath30 classes ; the number of conjugacy classes in the groups @xmath280 and @xmath281 together is @xmath282 one contributes @xmath283 classes and the other @xmath284 classes .",
    "in addition , the number of conjugacy classes in the groups @xmath285 and @xmath286 together is @xmath287 , each contributes @xmath288 classes .",
    "hence , the computations of the multiplicities and rank for the groups @xmath124 and @xmath289 presented in figures [ ranksp6_5 ] and [ ranksp8_3 - 012][ranksp8_3 - 34a][ranksp8_3 - 34b ] , respectively , give the required numerical confirmation of ( [ ex ] ) in these cases .",
    "we would like to clarify the strong relationship between the dimension of a representation of @xmath52 and its rank .",
    "fix @xmath290 and consider a rank @xmath116 irreducible representation @xmath291 let us assume that @xmath8 appears in the image of the eta correspondence ( [ eta ] ) .",
    "namely , there exist @xmath292 such that @xmath293see section [ ec ] . using part spectrum of theorem [ etac ] , and the dimension formula ( [ dimform ] )",
    ", we have @xmath294the point now is  see figure [ dim - ranksp6_5 ] for illustration  that the term @xmath295 dominates the right hand side of ( [ dim - eta - tau - form ] ) .",
    "indeed , we have    [ dim]let @xmath257 be a rank @xmath290 irreducible representation of @xmath52 associated to an irreducible representation @xmath255 of @xmath296 then @xmath297    a proof of theorem [ dim ] will be given in a sequel paper .",
    "the term @xmath298 can be estimated explicitly .",
    "for example we have @xmath299    theorem [ dim ] seems to substantially extend the current knowledge ls , n , sh , tz on the dimensions of representations of the finite symplectic groups ( see lemma 2.3 . in @xcite ) .      although dimension tends to increase with rank , because of the factor @xmath300 in ( [ dim - eta - tau - form ] ) , it may happen , see figures ranksp8_3 - 34a[ranksp8_3 - 34b ] , that a representation of rank @xmath116 has larger dimension than one of rank @xmath301 .",
    "however , for a given @xmath116 , if @xmath302 is large enough then the representations of rank @xmath116 will have smaller dimension than those of rank @xmath301 .",
    "for example , it seems that if @xmath303 is sufficiently large , then for @xmath126 , one can take @xmath304 , and for @xmath305 one can take @xmath306see figures [ dim - ranksp6_5 ] and [ ranksp8_3 - 012 ] for illustration . in general , using theorem [ dim ] and the known estimates on the dimensions of the largest irreducible representations of the orthogonal groups , we have the following result :    [ compatibility]for sufficiently large @xmath307 in the regime @xmath308the rank @xmath116 representations appearing in the image of the eta correspondence ( [ eta ] ) always have smaller dimension then those of rank @xmath301 .",
    "the exact computation leading to a verification of proposition compatibility will be given in a sequel paper .",
    "if @xmath309 then @xmath120 is trivial .",
    "the lemma now follows from the well known fact that the @xmath60 conjugates generate the group @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "consider the automorphism @xmath310 given by @xmath311 it can be extended to an automorphism of the semi - direct product of @xmath52 with @xmath143 , by letting it act trivially on @xmath52 .",
    "the equivalence of oscillator representations follows .",
    "the fact that for a non - square @xmath312 , the representations @xmath178 and @xmath313 are not isomorphic , can be verified using the realization given in remark [ schrodinger model ] .",
    "this completes the proof of the proposition .",
    "the proposition follows immediately from equation ( [ op - model - n ] ) in section [ schrodinger - vu ] .",
    "we give a proof of theorem [ etac ] * *  * * that is an elementary application of the _",
    "double commutant theorem _ @xcite .",

    "we work with the schrdinger model of @xmath228 appearing in section schrodinger - vu .",
    "it is realized on the space @xmath330and there , the actions of an element @xmath331 of the siegel unipotent radical @xmath60 @xmath332 and an element @xmath333 are given by formulas ( op - model - n ) and ( [ op - model - o ] ) , respectively . in particular ,",

    "weyl theorem @xcite for the regular representation implies      we would like now to describe the commutant of @xmath216 in @xmath346 considering the group @xmath347 of automorphisms of @xmath42 that stabilize the form @xmath348 we obtain two commuting actions@xmath349moreover , we have          write @xmath352for various irreducible representations @xmath353 of @xmath52 .",
