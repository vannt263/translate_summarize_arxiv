    "the most urgent issue that the current lhc experiments attempt to settle is to clarify a particle responsible for the origin of mass . in the standard model ( sm )",
    "higgs boson corresponds to the key particle , where the mass generation / electroweak ( ew ) symmetry breaking takes place through an ad hoc assumption of the nonzero vacuum expectation value of the elementary higgs field .",
    "thus in the framework of the sm , the origin of mass is put in by hand and not explained , which would suggest existence of more fundamental theory beyond the sm .",
    "recently , the atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite experiments have excluded the sm higgs boson for most of low mass range up to @xmath0 600 gev .",
    "if the higgs - like object , if any , existed above 600 gev , it would be too large to be accounted for by the sm higgs boson .",
    "even for the most recently reported diphoton excess at around 125 gev  @xcite , the best - fit signal strength denoted by cross section times the @xmath1 branching ratio is about 2 times larger than that of the sm higgs resonance  @xcite , which may also imply a non - sm higgs - like object .",
    "technicolor ( tc )  @xcite accommodates the electroweak symmetry breaking by techni - fermion condensation , without invoking the fundamental higgs boson , just like the quark condensation in qcd , and hence gives the dynamical explanation for the origin of mass .",
    "the original version of tc  @xcite , a naive scale - up version of qcd , was ruled out due to the excessive flavor - changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) . a way out of the fcnc problem",
    "was suggested under a simple assumption of the existence of a large anomalous dimension for techni - fermion bilinear operator @xmath2 without any concrete dynamics and concrete value of the anomalous dimension  @xcite .",
    "it was the walking tc ( wtc )  @xcite that exhibited a concrete dynamics based on a nonperturbative analysis of ladder schwinger - dyson ( sd ) equation with nonrunning ( scale invariant / conformal ) gauge coupling , @xmath3 , yielding a concrete value of the anomalous dimension , @xmath4 in the broken phase @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the critical coupling for the chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "modern version of wtc  @xcite is based on the two - loop running coupling with the caswell - banks - zaks infrared fixed point ( cbz - irfp )  @xcite , instead of the nonrunning one , in the improved ladder sd equation .",
    "another problem of the tc as a qcd scale - up is the electroweak constraints , so - called @xmath7 and @xmath8 parameters .",
    "this may also be improved in the wtc  @xcite . even if wtc in isolation can not overcome this problem ,",
    "there still exist a possibility that the problem may be resolved in the combined dynamical system including the sm fermion mass generation such as the extended tc ( etc ) dynamics  @xcite , in much the same way as the solution ( `` ideal fermion delocalization '' )  @xcite in the higgsless models which simultaneously adjust @xmath7 and @xmath8 parameters by incorporating the sm fermion mass profile .    in the wtc the techni - fermion ( @xmath9 )",
    "acquires the mass @xmath10 dynamically due to the scale - invariant / conformal dynamics in the form of essential - singularity scaling , miransky scaling  @xcite : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is an ultraviolet cutoff to be identified with an etc scale , @xmath13 .",
    "thanks to the miransky scaling , @xmath10 can be much smaller than @xmath12 , @xmath14 , near the criticality @xmath15 .",
    "this mass generation spontaneously breaks the scale symmetry , which can be characterized by the conformal phase transition  @xcite .",
    "actually , once the mass @xmath10 of the techni - fermion ( @xmath9 ) is dynamically generated , the coupling @xmath16 starts to run slowly ( `` walking '' ) according to the miransky scaling eq.([ms ] ) leading to the nonperturbative beta function  @xcite , @xmath17 the scale symmetry is thus spontaneously and explicitly broken by the dynamical mass generation with the scale @xmath10 .    in the case of modern version of wtc  @xcite based on the cbz - irfp @xmath18",
    ", the gauge coupling @xmath16 is almost nonrunning @xmath19 for @xmath20 where @xmath21 is an intrinsic scale analogous to @xmath22 and plays a role of the ultraviolet cutoff @xmath12 : @xmath23 . the existence of the intrinsic scale @xmath21 breaks the scale symmetry already at two - loop perturbative level for the ultraviolet region @xmath24 , where the coupling runs in the same way as in qcd .",
    "however , this perturbative scale - symmetry - breaking scale @xmath21 is irrelevant to the dynamical mass @xmath10 which can be much smaller than @xmath21 .",
    "the very reason for the nonperturbative scale anomaly thus comes only from the dynamical fermion mass generation along with the infrared scale @xmath10 .",
    "the spontaneous breaking of such an approximate scale symmetry implies existence of a light composite scalar , techni - dilaton ( td )  @xcite , arising as the pseudo nambu - goldstone boson ( pngb ) for the scale symmetry .",
    "since the td field ( @xmath25 ) couples to the trace of energy momentum tensor @xmath26 which is chiral invariant , the composite td is formed by techni - fermion and anti - techni - fermion bound state @xmath27 in a chiral- and flavor - singlet manner : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the td decay constant related to the spontaneous breaking of the scale symmetry ; @xmath30 denotes scale dimension of @xmath31 ; @xmath32 is the usual chiral field parametrized by the ngb fields associated with the spontaneously broken chiral symmetry as @xmath33 with the techni - pion decay constant @xmath34 .",
    "the td gets massive due to the nonperturbative scale anomaly as mentioned above , generated from the nonperturbative renormalization of the tc gauge coupling @xmath16 as in eq.([np : beta ] ) associated with the techni - fermion mass generation via miransky scaling .",
    "the td mass @xmath35 and decay constant @xmath29 may then be related to @xmath26 , trace of the energy momentum tensor , through the partially conserved dilatation current ( pcdc ) for the trace anomaly : @xmath36 where @xmath37 stands for the techni - gluon field strength .",
    "here @xmath38 , with @xmath39 being the vacuum energy density , and @xmath39 only includes contributions from the nonperturbative scale anomaly , defined by subtracting contributions @xmath40 of @xmath41 from the perturbative running of the gauge coupling @xmath16 , such as @xmath42 , which is saturated by the techni - gluon condensation induced by the techni - fermion condensation .",
    "hence the pcdc relation eq.([pcdc ] ) generically scales like @xmath43 where @xmath44 is dimension of techni - fermion representation for @xmath45 tc gauge group ( say , @xmath46 for fundamental representation ) and @xmath47 denotes the number of techni - fermions .",
    "eq.([pcdc : gene ] ) indeed implies that td can be lighter than other hadrons having masses of @xmath48 when the scale of @xmath29 is of @xmath48 or higher .",
    "however , the td mass can not parametrically be small since the scale symmetry is actually broken explicitly for the very reason of the spontaneous breaking itself , namely the dynamical generation of the techni - fermion mass @xmath10 , which is responsible for the nonperturbative running of @xmath16 ( nonperturbative scale anomaly eq.([pcdc ] ) ) as mentioned above .",
    "in fact , straightforward nonperturbative calculations of @xmath39 based on the ladder sd analysis  @xcite support the scaling eq.([pcdc : gene ] ) and show that @xmath49 finite even at the criticality limit @xmath50 @xmath51 where @xmath52 . thus the td can not be massless unless it is decoupled by @xmath53   as @xmath54 might be relevant to dark matter  @xcite . ] .    in fact ,",
    "@xmath55 for the typical one - family model was suggested  @xcite , based on various explicit calculations  @xcite .",
    "( this is also consistent with the recent holographic estimate  @xcite and others  @xcite . )",
    "however , their results are not very conclusive due to the respective uncertainties in those computations .",
    "although such a composite scalar was identified as a chiral non - singlet state , just like the chiral partner of pion , in contrast to the correct identification of td as in eq.([ff - phi ] ) , the td mass would be more involved than such an estimated scalar mass",
    ". it may therefore be reasonable to deal with the td mass as a free parameter at present .",
    "actually , we have recently explored the td lhc signatures taking the mass as a free parameter in the range 110 gev ",
    "1000 gev , which is in the reach of lhc experiments  @xcite .",
    "we addressed how the signatures look different from those of the sm higgs for by explicitly calculating the td lhc production cross sections at 7 tev times branching ratios normalized to the corresponding quantities for the sm higgs . particularly in ref .",
    "@xcite the currently observed excess at 125 gev in the diphoton channel can be explained by td .    in this paper",
    ", we first refine the previous calculations of refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite , based on a new method to derive all the td couplings to the sm particles and techni - fermions , solely from the ward - takahashi identities for the dilatation current coupled to td .",
    "we show that all the couplings to the sm particles are induced from techni - fermion loops : the yukawa couplings to the sm fermions arise due to etc - induced four - fermion interactions reflecting the ultraviolet feature of wtc characterized by the anomalous dimension @xmath56 .",
    "the couplings to the sm gauge bosons , on the other hand , are determined by the infrared features fixed solely by the low - energy theorem .",
    "we also refine the low - energy effective lagrangian for td in a way consistent with the ward - takahashi identities mentioned above .",
    "the lagrangian is based on the nonlinear realization of both the scale and chiral symmetries , where the scale invariance is ensured by including a spurion field which reflects the explicit breaking induced from the dynamical generation of techni - fermion mass itself .",
    "we then discuss the stability on the td mass against quadratically divergent corrections arising from an effective theory below the scale @xmath10 which would be the only possible source for a sizable scale symmetry breaking relevant to the td mass .",
    "to be concrete , we take typical models of wtc such as one - doublet model ( 1 dm ) and one - family model ( 1fm ) to discuss the td lhc signatures in comparison with those of the sm higgs by changing the td mass as a free parameter concentrated on a light mass region 110 gev - 600 gev . it turns out that the td in the 1 dm is invisible due to the highly suppressed couplings to the sm particles .",
    "it is shown that the light td signal in the 1fm can be found as a large excess relative to the sm higgs at around 125 gev only in the diphoton channel .",
