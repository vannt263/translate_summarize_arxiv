    "a potentially young shell - type galactic supernova remnant ( snr ) g1.9 + 0.3 was identified for the first time by @xcite , from very large array ( vla ) observations of a sample of small - diameter galactic radio sources .",
    "the interest in this snr has increased after the work of @xcite and @xcite who deduced that g1.9 + 0.3 is of order 100 yr old and therefore , the youngest snr in the galaxy . based on extremely high absorption , they placed g1.9 + 0.3 near the galactic centre ( gc ) , at a distance of about 8.5 kpc , where the mean diameter would be about 4 pc and the required expansion speed about 14000 km / s .",
    "@xcite propose a lower limit on its distance from sun as 10 kpc , based on the giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) measurements of absorption by known anomalous velocity features near the gc .    according to @xcite",
    ", the synchrotron - dominated x - ray spectrum clearly indicates that the effective particle acceleration takes place , at least for electrons , given the very high shock velocities and low ambient densities .",
    "also , the implied characteristic roll - off electron energy of about 100 tev is the highest ever reported for a shell snr .",
    "@xcite reported spatially resolved spectroscopy of sn ejecta and interpreted their results in the framework of an energetic and asymmetric type ia explosion .",
    "they also concluded that the outermost ejecta layers in free expansion have velocities in excess of 18000 km / s .",
    "several arguments suggest a type ia origin of g1.9 + 0.3 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : the high velocities more than 100 yr after the explosion , the absence of central pulsar - wind nebula and the bisymmetric morphology in x - ray and substantial thermal emission from fe .",
    "a usual core - collapse event could not reproduce the observations , while an sn ia model can easily reach the observed size and velocity for a mean ambient density of about 0.02 @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "@xcite compared their vla radio observations of the snr g1.9 + 0.3 at 4.86 ghz and 1.43 ghz with earlier observations at 1.49 ghz which have a comparable resolution .",
    "they found evidence that this snr has been brightening over the past few decades in the radio emission at a rate of @xmath5 2 per cent yr@xmath4 for the available flux densities and proposed explanation that the efficiency of particle acceleration and/or magnetic field amplification ( mfa ) has been increasing .",
    "@xcite analysed all available radio - continuum observations of snr 1.9 + 0.3 at 6 cm from the vla and also the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : radio ] ) , obtaining results that are in broad agreement with the estimates of expansion made by @xcite and @xcite .    by using the time - dependent non - linear kinetic theory for cosmic ray ( cr ) acceleration in snrs ,",
    "coupled with 1d spherically symmetric gas dynamics , @xcite predicted that radio luminosity should increase during the free expansion phase , in general case . according to these authors ,",
    "this is mainly due to the growing number of accelerated crs .",
    "@xcite also applied a similar model of non - linear cr acceleration to study the non - thermal properties of snr g1.9 + 0.3 .",
    "they obtained a spatially integrated radio synchrotron flux that slowly increases with time , explaining it as a consequence of the rapidly increasing total number of accelerated electrons in the increasing snr volume @xmath6 , where @xmath7 represents the current shock radius .",
    "recently , @xcite used their analytical model to demonstrate that a double degenerate ( dd ) progenitor can explain the decades - long flux rise and size increase of the snr g1.9 + 0.3 and disfavour a single degenerate ( sd ) scenario for this snr .",
    "nevertheless , for the pre - explosion circumstellar density @xmath8 they assume index @xmath9 for the sd and @xmath10 for the dd case , which may be questionable .",
    "it should be examined whether the increasing radio brightness of g1.9 + 0.3 is a unique property amongst the snrs in our galaxy and does it require some special conditions .",
    "one of the aims will also be to go beyond the specific analysis of g1.9 + 0.3 and , in some future papers , expand the proposed analysis to any young snr or further to a global sample of snrs with different ages .",
    "why do we think the radio evolution modelling is important ?",
    "electrons emitting at a radio frequency have the acceleration time - scales of the order of a week , when the bohm diffusion is assumed @xcite .",
    "this is much less than the acceleration time of the highest - energy particles , for which it is of the order of an snr age .",
    "due to this , modelling of radio evolution and connecting it to the radio observations may reveal the present - time behaviour of the injection efficiency and also its time dependence @xcite .",
    "also , the radio surface - brightness - to - diameter ( @xmath11 ) relation for snrs , being a useful distance determination tool , can be significantly improved if the radio evolution is better understood .",
    "this relation is known to depend on the properties of the sn explosion such as the explosion energy , mass of the ejected matter and also on the properties of ism such as density , magnetic field strength , etc .",
    "one of the main shortcomings of this relation is the severe data scatter that is mainly due to the spread in mentioned parameters , in addition to measurement errors and selection effects ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* etc . ) .",
    "theoretical considerations contain many limitations because they often rely on simplified assumptions about the evolutionary stage of snrs , particle spectra and its evolution , magnetic field evolution , etc .",
    "numerical simulations should provide a better understanding of underlying physics and explanation of the observed statistical properties .",
    "magnetic field is one of the main ingredients in particle acceleration and non - thermal emission .",
    "consistent , the time - dependent calculation of mfa is one of the main advantages in an approach based on numerical simulations .",
    "the dynamical evolution of an snr was modelled by numerically solving the time - dependent hydrodynamical ( hd ) equations of mass , momentum and energy conservation , including a semi - analytical model of acceleration and back reaction of particles on shock dynamics .",
    "we threat the back - reaction of the energetic particles on the shock in sense of the pressure of particles that affect shock dynamics @xcite and cr current that amplifies the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "both effects happen upstream of the shock wave , in the so - called precursor .",
    "accent of this paper is given to the spatially integrated radio emission of a single snr and its temporal evolution , but also to the development of a consistent model that can be applied to any type ia snrs .    throughout our paper",
    ", we will use classical  non - linear diffusive shock acceleration ( nldsa ) that naturally predicts that the spectrum steepens at low energies and flattens at higher energies , as the compression ratio felt by a diffusing particle depends on particle s energy .",
    "recent gamma - ray observations of galactic snrs seriously challenge this understanding of cr acceleration at fast shocks .",
    "there are evidences of high - energy part of cr spectra steeper than @xmath12 ( significantly steeper than what is expected in nldsa that is implemented in our model ) coming mainly from gamma - ray observations of snrs @xcite .",
    "he developed a self - consistent scenario in which mfa induces the conditions for reversing previously mentioned trend and can lead to a steepening in the high energy part of the spectrum of crs .",
    "the crucial point in @xcite is that he takes the alfvn speed in the amplified magnetic field ( as being @xmath13 ) instead of calculation in the ambient field @xmath14 .",
    "this is not crucial for this study and not modelled here because the part of the electron spectrum that matters for radio emission is at much lower energies . as for higher energies",
    ", it should be included in our future modelling , especially if we are interested in gamma - ray emission produced in hadronic scenario , with spectrum and emissivity directly related to the spectrum of highest energy crs .",
    "the simplified model of gamma - ray evolution , used in our paper , is not strongly influenced by the shape of the spectrum as it approximates it with @xmath12 .",
    "the dynamical evolution of an snr was modelled by numerically solving the time - dependent hd equations of mass , momentum and energy conservation :    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the mass density , @xmath17 is the flow velocity , @xmath18 is the thermal pressure , @xmath19 is the unit vector , @xmath20 is the total energy density and @xmath21 is the adiabatic index .",
    "the total energy density is the sum of the thermal and kinetic components :    @xmath22    we adopt the pluto code ( version 4.2 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to solve the system of hd conservation laws by using a cell - centred finite - volume approach based on godunov - type schemes .",
    "the code design enables efficient usage of massively parallel computers through the message passing interface standard ( mpi ) for interprocessor communications .",
    "we do not include radiative cooling and thermal conduction in our hd equations , describing only the free and sedov expansion phases of the snr evolution in a tenuous , collisionless medium .",
    "the transition time from sedov to radiative phase for an snr is described with the approximation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* )    @xmath23    where @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the initial total explosion energy , contained mostly in form of kinetic energy . in our set of simulations , @xmath26 myr and",
    "therefore our modelled snrs never reach the radiative phase .",
    "we will compute the radio emission from the snr but with assumption that the radiation has no impact yet on its dynamical evolution .    throughout our modelling",
    ", we do not activate the mhd solver of pluto because it is in any case powerless in describing the generation of magnetic turbulence by crs upstream of the shock and corresponding mfa .",
    "such an amplified magnetic field is dominant compared to the field compressed only due to fluid compression , especially for young snrs where non - linearity is very pronounced .",
    "nldsa module , which runs parallel with pluto hd code , simultaneously performs calculations of mfa , synthesize the global radio emission in this amplified field and also accounts for its impact on hydrodynamics .",
    "we used the following set of pluto algorithms in our simulations : linear interpolation with default limiter , hllc riemann solver and rk2 algorithm for the time evolution .",
    "additionally , we used multid shock flattening algorithm for the numerical dissipation near the strong shocks .",
    "our three - dimensional ( 3d ) computations were carried out in spherical coordinates @xmath27 , by using a static logarithmic grid , with mesh size increasing with the snr radius .",
    "detection and tracking of the snr shock waves in the fluid , travelling in some direction @xmath28 , is based on two standard numerical conditions , namely @xmath29 and @xmath30 , where @xmath31 represents parameter , setting the shock strength .",
    "we modified pluto modules in order to couple the hydrodynamical evolution of the remnant with particle acceleration . instead of a constant adiabatic gas index @xmath21 ( ratio of specific heats ) , obeying the ideal gas low @xmath32 ,",
    "where @xmath33 represents thermal energy density , we adopted hydrodynamic equations to use the space and time - dependent adiabatic index @xmath34 i. e. @xmath35 .",
    "the effective adiabatic index @xmath36 , defined so it produces the same total compression @xmath37 as obtained from a non - linear model ( described later in section  [ sec : dsa ] ) , is calculated at the shock front and then advected within the remnant , remaining constant in each fluid element as in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . as pointed out by @xcite and @xcite",
    ", each fluid element should remember the effect of shock modification induced by accelerated crs at the time when shock wave passes through the fluid element .",
    "to fulfil this requirement , we threat the gas adiabatic index as a pluto built - in code feature called passive scalar  or colour  ( denoted by @xmath38 ) obeying the simple advection equation of the form    @xmath39    which is added to the standard set of hydrodynamic equations ( equation  [ eq2 ] ) , where @xmath40 denotes the lagrangian time derivative .",
    "the shock precursor is not explicitly modeled in the hydrodynamic part of our simulations .",
    "the precursor properties are handled in a separate module containing a non - linear acceleration calculation .",
    "non - linear effects on snr hydrodynamics are visible only through the effective adiabatic index , as explained in the next section .",
    "we model the evolution of an snr , including the effect of the high - energy cr particles accelerated by the shock wave .",
    "it is widely accepted that the most efficient process of particle acceleration in snrs is the diffuse shock acceleration ( dsa ) , proposed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "also known as a first - order fermi mechanism , it provides the energy gain due to collisions with irregularities of the magnetic field of @xmath41 , that is , first order in @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the velocity of magnetic perturbation and @xmath44 is the velocity of high - energy particle . for additional reviews of particle acceleration theories ,",
    "see for example @xcite and @xcite .    in order to take into account the non - linear back",
    "reaction of accelerated particles on the fluid structure , we use the semi - analytical model of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this model iteratively solves the particle distribution function @xmath45 satisfies @xmath46 , where @xmath47 represents number of particles per unit volume .",
    "the energy distribution @xmath48 can be calculated as @xmath49 , giving @xmath50 in relativistic regime where @xmath51 . ] and the dimensionless fluid velocity @xmath52 , both as functions of particle momentum @xmath53 .",
    "the boundary condition @xmath54 has to be fulfilled since at @xmath55 there are no crs to contribute any pressure . the function @xmath52 represents quantity defined as @xmath56 , where @xmath57 represents the average fluid velocity experienced by particles with momentum @xmath53 while diffusing upstream away from the shock surface and @xmath58 is the fluid velocity far upstream ( shock wave velocity ) .    in the following",
    ", we will use standard indexing of quantities around shock wave , namely subscript 1 ( 2 ) for parameters immediately upstream ( downstream ) , while subscript 0 denotes undisturbed , far upstream quantities .",
    "we introduce three quantities @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 that are respectively the compression factor at the gas subshock , the total compression factor and compression in the shock precursor . the compression ratio @xmath62 ( @xmath37 ) is expected to be lower ( higher ) than for the standard test - particle ( tp ) case where @xmath63 . for a strongly modified shock , @xmath64 can attain values much larger than @xmath65 .",
    "the model iteratively solves acceleration , by numerical integration of integro - differential equations , providing the values for shock compressions @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath64 that give @xmath52 solution , satisfying @xmath54 .",
    "this model only finds quasi - stationary solutions so that we have to rerun it after each hydro time step ( see recent paper @xcite that describes the time - dependent dsa at the non - relativistic shocks ) .",
    "having the overall compression ratio , @xmath64 , the effective ratio of specific heats is calculated as @xcite    @xmath67    where @xmath68 represents the sonic mach number far upstream .",
    "the originally proposed non - linear acceleration model of blasi usually gives high levels of shock modification , as the total shock compression factors may exceed @xmath2 50100 @xcite and thus do not compare well with some observations , suggesting @xmath69 710 or slightly higher ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we assume that part of the energy in the form of turbulent alfn waves , excited by energetic particles and responsible for the scattering of charged particles , is damped on the thermal gas and heats the gas in the upstream region .",
    "our model uses non - adiabatic compression in the precursor proposed by @xcite    @xmath70    which is caused by the alvfn heating and significantly reduces the shock modification .",
    "here , @xmath71 represents far upstream fluid pressure , @xmath72 and @xmath73 are respectively the fluid pressure and dimensionless fluid velocity at any point @xmath74 ( for a given diffusion law @xmath75 , particles of momentum @xmath53 diffuse up to a distance @xmath76 where the fluid velocity is @xmath57 ) and @xmath77 $ ] is a free parameter introduced by @xcite .",
    "this parameter accounts that the fraction @xmath78 of the energy transferred from cr streaming to mhd waves is dissipated as heat in the plasma by non - linear damping processes .",
    "the damping of the waves is mitigated for @xmath79 and therefore allows mfa , the rate of damping of the waves is close to that of wave - growth and the mfa is heavily suppressed . ] .",
    "we use a recipe for the injection of particles from the thermal pool , proposed by @xcite , and set the following fraction @xmath80 of particles entering the acceleration process from maxwellian downstream thermal pool    @xmath81    which assumes that only particles with momentum @xmath82 can be involved in acceleration process , where @xmath83 represents the mean downstream thermal momentum , @xmath84 is the proton mass and @xmath85 is the downstream temperature . the shift @xmath86 is due to the assumption that thermal particles in downstream have a maxwellian spectrum in the fluid reference frame , while @xmath87 is taken in the shock frame .",
    "the injection parameter @xmath88 strongly affects the acceleration fraction @xmath80 .",
    "@xcite conclude from their kinetic simulations that for parallel non - relativistic shocks a fraction of about @xmath89 to @xmath90 of the particles crossing the shock is injected into the dsa process and that the injection parameter is @xmath91 34 .    while the thermal leakage may represent a viable way of parameterizing injection , it does not account for the dependence of ion injection on shock inclination , elaborated by @xcite .",
    "recent pic simulations bring back again the dependence of ion injection on shock inclination @xcite .",
    "they show that ions are injected not by being heated and then leaking , but instead by specular reflection .",
    "a different dependence of @xmath80 on subshock compression is then hard to encompass in a formula similar to equation  [ eq : efficiency ] .",
    "this refinement is well beyond the goal of this paper , but should be somehow encompassed in future modelling .",
    "it is worth stressing that using equation  [ eq : efficiency ] introduces some kind of time dependence of the acceleration efficiency , as compression at the subshock is not constant during snr evolution .",
    "this may be seen as an improvement in comparison with previous models setting @xmath92 , keeping in mind that it may be still artificial and a questionable simplification .",
    "recently proposed , a new theoretical model of time - dependent shock acceleration of particles @xcite shows that variable injection could be a crucial element in explaining the x - ray and gamma - ray spectra of young snrs , but not so important for radio spectra .",
    "nevertheless , the time dependence in injection efficiency is hard to model , and even more how the proton - to - electron ratio ( introduced later in section  [ sec : radio ] ) depends on time .",
    "kinetic simulations , providing us first - principles calculations , seem to show that ion injection does not vary as long as the shock is strong , while the electron injection efficiency in the regimes considered here is still questionable .",
    "we assume that the cr distribution vanishes at a distance @xmath93 upstream of the shock wave , where parameter @xmath94 is the fraction of the shell radius @xmath7 , to account for the presence of a free - escape boundary beyond which highest energy crs , mainly consisting of protons , can not diffuse back at the shock and escape into the interstellar medium ( ism ) @xcite .",
    "this approximation allows us to determine the maximum momentum @xmath95 of accelerated protons by assuming    @xmath96    where @xmath75 is the bohm - like diffusion constant i.e. @xmath97 , with @xmath98 and @xmath99 are respectively the particle velocity and the larmor radius , in agreement with the approach of @xcite and references therein .",
    "we use @xmath100 in our model as suggested by @xcite , which satisfies the condition that the acceleration time up to @xmath95 is less than the age of the system @xcite .      galactic cr acceleration to the knee in the spectrum at a few pev is only possible if the magnetic field ahead of an snr shock is strongly amplified by crs escaping the snr @xcite .",
    "consistent calculation of the magnetic field strength , although not yet fully understood , is of the utmost importance for the radio emission of energetic electrons . due to this , we include mfa in our model .",
    "the mfa is driven by streaming instabilities , induced by crs in the vicinity of snr shocks .",
    "instabilities can be resonant @xcite , assuming that alfvn waves , generated by particles streaming faster than the alfvn speed , have a wavelength in resonance with the cr larmor radius , and strongly driven , nearly purely growing , non - resonant @xcite .",
    "non - resonant instabilities are not accurately described as alfvn waves and they grow preferentially at wavelengths that are not resonant with the cr larmor radius .",
    "@xcite showed that the non - resonant modes are bound to be relevant mostly in the earlier stages of the snr evolution , namely free expansion and early sedov ",
    "taylor , while streaming instability should be dominated by resonant waves for the most of the history of the snr .",
    "however , according to @xcite , their equation obtained for resonant instability fits well up to simulations with @xmath101 and can also be extrapolated to higher mach numbers , inferred at the blast waves of young snrs , in the case of efficient cr acceleration , which is certainly the case for g1.9 + 0.3 . for such high-@xmath102 shocks , according to @xcite , we can distinguish two regions : the far upstream region dominated by non - resonant instability , and the precursor , where resonant and non - resonant instabilities grow at a comparable rate .",
    "closer to the snr shock , resonant instabilities seems to take over but ambient magnetic field is already considerably modified in the precursor .",
    "it is , however , hard to simulate what happens for @xmath103 in global shock simulations mentioned , as simulations become quite expensive , and many questions remain open here . due to this ,",
    "whichever model we choose to implement , it will contain a lot of uncertainties until the future pic simulations and better theory give us and improved understanding .    we choose to model mfa due to resonant streaming instability , being already compatible with blasi s formalism and easy to implement in our code . with the assumption that all the turbulence is generated via streaming instability in the precursor , it is described by @xcite in the form    @xmath104    this model of mfa",
    "is also used by @xcite and @xcite . here",
    ", @xmath105 denotes the precursor magnetic pressure of alfvn waves ( subscript @xmath106 indicates modes of the magnetic turbulence ) and @xmath107 is the alfvnic mach number far upstream . for simplicity , we do not include pre - existing magnetic turbulence in the ism in our models .",
    "the factor @xmath108 is introduced to balance the factor @xmath78 in , and accounts for local wave dissipation and reduction of mfa .",
    "the total magnetic field at point @xmath74 is then calculated with    @xmath109    with @xmath14 denoting the ordered component of the ambient magnetic field .",
    "however , keep in mind that this is a rough estimate as the effective ambient @xmath14 field that we need in the precursor is always determined by the bell s non - resonant instabilities far upstream and will be larger than the few @xmath106 g of the galactic field .",
    "the magnetic pressure in the amplified fields becomes quite high , comparable with or even higher than the thermal one , making the dynamical role of amplified magnetic fields non - negligible @xcite . due to this",
    ", the magnetic pressure as well as the pressure of accelerated particles is accounted for in the nldsa part of the presented calculations and then affects fluid compressibility through the effective adiabatic index .",
    "the global shock modification follows from the conservation of momentum between the far upstream medium and any precursor point @xmath74 , which involves four terms : dynamical pressure @xmath110 , thermal pressure @xmath18 , non - thermal pressure of crs computed from their distribution @xmath45 as @xmath111 and magnetic pressure @xmath112 @xcite , described with equation    @xmath113    as we will see later , the factor @xmath78 in our simulations is close to @xmath114 and therefore gives the amplified magnetic field an important role in snr dynamics .",
    "also note that mfa leads to non - adiabatic heating of the background plasma ( turbulent heating , as mentioned in section  [ sec : dsa ] ) in such a way that plasma and magnetic field pressure are almost in equipartition throughout the precursor @xcite .",
    "the maximum value of the amplified upstream magnetic field @xmath115 is reached immediately ahead of the shock wave and we calculate it by putting @xmath116 in .",
    "we use a common assumption that the @xmath117-field is totally random in orientation , as a consequence of the strong turbulence .",
    "we then assume that the downstream magnetic field is compressed only due to fluid compression such that the components in a shock plane are compressed and the three components of the magnetic field are roughly equal .",
    "the downstream magnetic field is then given by @xmath118 .",
    "we also account for damping of the amplified magnetic field in the downstream region .",
    "we use the following recipe for the downstream magnetic field @xcite , based on the non - linear landau damping mechanism    @xmath119    the typical length scale @xmath120 for the non - linear landau damping given by    @xmath121    where @xmath122 is the alfvn velocity in the downstream region .",
    "bell s model for the mfa due to the non - resonant streaming instability @xcite predicts the total saturated magnetic energy density    @xmath123    where @xmath124 represent the cr energy density at the shock . in the active snr phase ,",
    "when @xmath125 , this results in an amplified magnetic field of @xmath126 .",
    "another point of view , namely equipartition between the total energy densities of crs and that of the magnetic field @xcite results in @xmath127 .",
    "both dependences , mentioned above , were implemented in the numerical model of @xcite , while @xcite used only the later one .",
    "@xcite favors a dependence @xmath126 , providing the observational evidence , but also notes that the dynamic range makes the dependence on shock velocity uncertain . on the other hand , @xmath126 implementation in @xcite , results in a too slow increase in radio flux density of snr g1.9 + 0.3 to provide a reasonable agreement with observations .",
    "equation  [ eq : pw - res ] , used as a receipt for mfa in our modelling of radio evolution , is a pretty much non - linear and therefore the magnetic field dependence on shock velocity will be affected by other simulation parameters .",
    "if we deduce from equation  [ eq : pw - res ] that @xmath128 , we obtain @xmath129 that should be taken with caution as the term @xmath130 probably brings additional dependence on shock velocity .",
    "we will see later in section  [ sec : results ] the relation between the amplified magnetic field and the shock velocity , obtained from our simulations .",
    "the previous paragraph demonstrates an important difference between mfa driven by resonant and non - resonant streaming instabilities .",
    "the saturation of the resonant cr - driven instability explicitly depends on initial @xmath14 , which is not the case for bell s non - resonant instabilities ( see , , e.g. equations 12 and 13 in * ? ? ?",
    "magnetic field modelling here does not consider its stretching and amplifying caused by the initial clumping of the ejecta and due to the development of rayleigh  taylor instabilities ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "it is thus important to simulate these effects by using pluto mhd in future , in order to follow morphological evolution of snr along with the integrated radio emission that is modelled here .",
    "although the injection mechanisms for electrons are much less clear than for protons , we use the assumption that electron injection is the same as that of protons and normalize their spectrum with respect to the protons spectrum :    @xmath131    where parameter @xmath132 represents the electron - to - proton ratio , very likely related to the different mechanisms responsible for lepton and hadron injection .",
    "we allow this parameter to vary from the value @xmath133 , observed near earth in the diffuse spectrum of galactic crs around gev energies .",
    "since the energy losses of gev electrons are not significant for propagation in the galaxy , the electron - to - proton ratio is also about 10@xmath134 in the source .",
    "nevertheless , this does not mean that this ratio must be the same for young snrs @xcite .",
    "young snrs , like g1.9 + 0.3 , may be the main source of galactic electrons with energies higher than 10 tev , while gev electrons may be produced in older snrs and therefore the value measured in crs seems to be determined by later stages of the snr evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . from recent pic simulations of simultaneous acceleration of protons and electrons @xcite",

    "we assume that the spectrum of accelerated electrons is parallel to protons one , except for large momenta , since the dsa mechanism should not be dependent on charge . we neglect the dynamical role of electrons in our model .",
    "assumption about parallel proton and electron spectra holds as long as synchrotron losses are neglected .",

    "strict numerical treatment of electron cooling is beyond the scope of this paper , as for radio - emitting electrons it can be safely neglected .",
    "nevertheless , we implement the simple toy  model , dealing with high - energy part of the electron spectrum , in order to obtain satisfying model of synchrotron spectra from radio to x - ray domain , which is later demonstrated in section 3 .",
    "we assume that electron spectra above a certain energy becomes steeper , i.e. changes from @xmath139 to @xmath140 @xcite and allow @xmath141 to be different than 1 .",

    "the x - ray part of the spectrum and gamma - ray emission evolution are given above only in an illustrative way , to check how our model fits with observations in domains other than radio .",
    "more rigorous numerical treatment of synchrotron losses will be necessary in order to obtain evolution of the emission at energies higher than radio .",
    "we reserve a detailed modelling of snr evolutionary tracks at different wavelengths for future work .",
    "the peculiar nature of radio evolution of the youngest known galactic snr g1.9 + 0.3 is modelled by using blasi non - linear kinetic theory of cr acceleration in snrs coupled with 3d hydrodynamics , simultaneously solved with the pluto code .",
    "we assume this snr originated from a type ia supernova ( sn ) explosion located near the gc , with explosion energy 10@xmath0 erg and ejecta mass 1.4 m@xmath257 .",
    "hydrodynamic equations in the pluto code were adopted to use the space and time - dependent adiabatic index in order to account for the presence of energetic particles , making the fluid more compressible .",
    "our modelling and analysis leads to the following essential results .",
    "\\(i ) from our 3d hydrodynamic simulations of snr evolution , including a deceleration of fs by the ambient medium and due to back reaction of crs , we estimate the current age of g1.9 + 0.3 snr to be slightly over 120 yr , expanding in an ambient density of 0.02 @xmath258 .",
    "\\(ii ) efficient acceleration is necessary in order to explain observed spectral steepening of the radio spectra .",
    "namely , observations are well fitted for injection parameter @xmath88 between 3.45 and 3.30 , corresponding to an acceleration efficiency @xmath2590.51.1@xmath260 and magnetic field amplified more than 50 times from the assumed ambient value .",
    "\\(iii ) following our models , it can be concluded that radio emission increasing brightness is a common property of young snrs .",
    "our model gives the average 843 mhz flux increase gradient during a 20-yr period of around 0.017 @xmath232 ( 1.8 per cent yr@xmath4 ) , which is in a very good agreement with most observations and also with other available observations from a range of instruments , compiled from the literature .",
    "simulations give the average 2695 mhz flux gradient of 0.008 jy yr@xmath4 during the past 30 yr , being in a good agreement with effelsberg measurements .",
    "\\(iv ) numerical model predicts increasing radio emission from g1.9 + 0.3 during the free expansion phase , reaching its maximum value around the age of 600 yr and then decreasing during late free expansion and beginning of sedov phase around 1700 yr after the sn explosion .",
    "interestingly , it seems that we are currently witnessing approximately the fastest radio emission increase than it will ever be .",
    "\\(v ) the radio brightness will grow according to prediction given in this paper , until its maximum flux densities of @xmath2 4.3 , 3.1 and 1.5 jy , respectively , for frequencies 843 , 1425 and 4860 mhz , being around three times higher than the present day values .",
    "\\(vi ) the steep radio spectral index ( steeper than linear dsa prediction of @xmath215 ) for young snrs is explained only by means of efficient nldsa and accompanying strong mfa .",
    "the radio spectral index also shows qualitatively similar evolution as the radio flux , it reaches the steepest value @xmath261 and then becomes shallower ( trending towards the value of 0.5 ) .",
    "higher injection efficiency @xmath80 leads to higher @xmath261 but also causes this value to be reached earlier in the snr history .",
    "however , the temporal evolution of the radio spectral index turns out to be very sensitive to model parameters @xmath88 and @xmath78 .",
    "\\(vii ) we implement a simple toy  model for the synthesis of a broader synchrotron spectrum from radio to x - ray , by using the electron spectrum obtained in our simulations .",
    "this spectrum is modified in post - processing by introducing a break in the electron spectrum , to account for synchrotron losses and modelled x - ray emission fit well the _ chandra _ and nustar measurements .",
    "it agrees well with models of spectra containing more consistent , numerical calculation of synchrotron losses .",
    "\\(viii ) we also implement approximative model of gamma - ray emission coming from the snr .",
    "we inspect time evolution of the total gamma - ray flux and conclude that it may be visible in tev gamma - rays by future instruments , including the cta .",
    "model predicts increasing tev gamma - ray emission during the entire free expansion phase , reaching the maximum value of @xmath256 at the age of around 1500 yr .",
    "our model enabled us to make important conclusions about the present and predictions about the future properties of radio emission from the youngest known galactic snr . we want to emphasize that , although the presented model contains robust implementation , all provided quantitative estimates should be taken with caution .",
    "besides our limited knowledge in physical descriptions of particle acceleration and snr evolution , a significant number of model parameters still remain weakly constrained .",
    "models of radio evolutionary tracks can be of the utmost importance for the future observers working on powerful radio telescopes such as alma and ska .",
    "these types of modelling can provide important information about the evolutionary stage of snrs , as well as to characterize the physical conditions in the shocks where the relativistic particles are accelerated .",
