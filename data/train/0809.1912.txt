    "entanglement in systems of few particles is one of the most characteristic aspects of quantum dynamics.@xcite . with",
    "its counterpart decoherence is a key element in quantum computing , quantum cryptography and quantum teleportation@xcite .",
    "quantification of the degree of entanglement@xcite corresponding to a given quantum state and understanding of how it changes due to interactions with other quantum systems or with the environment are of great importance , both from a fundamental point of view or to envisage possible applications . for systems with many degrees of freedom recent developments have stressed approximate methods for the separation of the entangled component of a given configuration @xcite , but a complete characterization has not been achieved . on the contrary for two qubits the works of peres , horodecki , hill , and",
    "wootters @xcite established the base for a complete discussion of entanglement in terms of algebraic properties of the density matrix . in particular ,",
    "the peres - horodecki criterion @xcite and concurrence as defined by wootters @xcite allow to quantify entanglement for arbitrary states .",
    "when interacting with the environment , entanglement between subsystems tends to fade away .",
    "interaction may be represented using a bath with chosen specific properties . in some cases a complete suppression of entanglement",
    "may be observed at finite time , an effect which is referred as entanglement sudden death . @xcite . since in general ,",
    "interaction with some kind of bath is inevitable and one is interested in having maximum entanglement at disposal it is important to device strategies to preserve or recuperate entanglement during the evolution of an open system . among the strategies to minimize the influence of the environment are the use of quantum zeno effect @xcite , the identification and use of free decoherence spaces @xcite , and the application of quantum error correcting codes in quantum computation@xcite .    in this work",
    "we are interested in the use of local operations which allow to recuperate at least partially the entanglement which has been lose in the interaction with the bath .",
    "as is known , there are situations where it is possible to improve the degree of entanglement of a pair of systems by means of filtering operations consisting in local non unitary operations and classical communication ( lsocc)@xcite . moreover , as we discuss below for each state there exists an optimal filtering operation for which the image state is the one with maximum entanglement among the accessible sates@xcite .",
    "the concurrence of this state is what is call the maximum extractable entanglement of the original state . in this paper",
    "we propose to study the evolution of the maximum extractable entanglement for two qubits in contact with a bath in order to identify conditions for which local observers using ( lsocc ) at adequate times may recuperate maximum final entanglement . in the following section we review some of the fundamental concepts discussed in this paper .",
    "then in section ( [ sec3 ] ) we discuss the explicit form of the optimal filtering operation . in section ( [ sec4 ] ) the dynamics of the maximum extractable entanglement for a system composed of two qubits in the presence of two independent thermal baths , a common thermal bath or a common squeezed bath is studied . in section ( [ sec5 ] )",
    "the specific case of interaction with the vacuum of two independent baths is discussed in some detail .",
    "for a composed system with subsystems @xmath0 and @xmath1 in a pure state , a good measure of entanglement is the entropy of either of the two subsystems .",
    "the entanglement of formation of a mixed state @xmath2 defined as the average entanglement of the pure states appearing in its decomposition minimized over all possible decompositions @xcite is also a good measure of the entanglement of such system .",
    "it is a monotonically increasing function of concurrence introduced in @xcite which consequently may be taken as an entanglement measure too . for two qubits , with density matrix @xmath3 , concurrence @xcite",
    "is calculated in terms of the eigenvalues @xmath4 of the related matrix @xmath5 defined by , @xmath6 it is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 entanglement measured , for example , by concurrence diminishes in general by effect of decoherence but may be preserved in some particular situations when decoherence free subspaces are allowed .",
    "it may also be partially , but in general not totally , recovered by applying on the system some specific operations . among them , filtering operations of the form @xmath9}\\ \\   , \\ ] ] are important because they represent the only way to increase the entanglement of the bipartite system using local operations and classical communication . under the action of these operations the concurrence transforms as @xcite , @xmath10 } .\\ ] ] which in particular means that separable and entangled states are mapped onto their own kind .",
    "as we mentioned earlier it is of practical interest to find the state with maximum entanglement which can be obtained from the initial state via filtering operations . for two qubits",
    ", the density matrix can be represented in terms of pauli matrices ( @xmath11 ) as @xmath12 it was shown @xcite that the optimal filtering operation maps the initial state on a bell diagonal state .",
    "these are states which can be written in the standard form @xmath13 and define a vector sub - space of three dimensions with coordinates @xmath14 . in this subspace",
    ", physical states form a tetrahedron whose vertices @xmath15 represent pure bell states .",
    "separable states of this subspace form an octahedron @xcite . for matrices written in the standard form",
    "is easy to show that @xmath16 the eigenvalues of r are @xmath17 , and concurrence in terms of the eigenvalues @xmath18 of @xmath2 is , @xmath19 where @xmath20 in the parametrization ( [ standard ] ) of the bell diagonal states the eigenvalues of @xmath2 can be written as @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24    to quantify the degree of mixing of the states during their evolution we use von neuman entropy defined in terms of the eigenvalues @xmath25 of the density matrix as @xmath26 for pure states @xmath27 .",
    "the practical problem we have to address is given an initial state , to find explicitly at any time the maximum entangled state and the optimal filtering operation leading to it .",
    "the concurrence of this optimal state is call the maximum extractable entanglement of the state at this time .",
    "there are different approaches to compute it which depend on the rank of the initial density matrix @xcite .",
    "following leinaas _",
    "et al _ @xcite we discuss an explicit procedure to perform this mapping , for a five parameter family of states and show how the maximum extractable entanglement evolves in the presence of either two independent thermal baths , a common thermal bath or a common squeezed bath .",
    "et al _ @xcite showed that filtering operations ( [ filt ] ) on two qubits correspond to lorentz transformations @xmath28 on the real parametrization ( [ general ] ) of the density matrix .",
    "the lorentz transformations @xmath29 and @xmath30 are related with @xmath0 and @xmath1 in ( [ filt ] ) by @xmath31 with @xmath32 the fixed matrix @xmath33 to identify the optimal filtering operations one should first find @xcite the four - vectors @xmath34 and @xmath35 that minimize the function @xmath36 assuming the normalization condition @xmath37 and @xmath38 , @xmath39 . then the optimal lorentz transformation is chosen so that @xmath40 in general this transformation does not map directly the initial state to a state written in the standard form ( [ standard ] ) . an additional local unitary transformation which does not modify the entanglement of the system is necessary to this end . nevertheless for the class of states defined by @xmath41 matrices of the form",
    "@xmath42 which we consider in this work , the optimal filtering operation leads directly to a sate in the standard form . for this class of states using the lagrange s multipliers method the extremal problem ( [ min ] )",
    "may be solved to find the lorentz transformation which diagonalize the real parametrization of the density matrix .",
    "this is given by , @xmath43 where @xmath44 satisfies both @xmath45 and @xmath46 with @xmath47 since the lorentz transformations are not unitary the transformed density matrix must be normalized after each step .",
    "one then obtains the following non zero entries for the final bell diagonal state : @xmath48 @xmath49 @xmath50 using these expressions and eqs.([9]-[14 ] ) one obtains the concurrence of the optimum state .     in two independent thermal baths , ( @xmath51     in two independent thermal baths of @xmath52",
    "in this section we discuss the evolution of the maximum extractable entanglement of a two qubits system in three different situations .",
    "we consider the two particles interacting with two independent thermal baths , a common thermal bath or a squeezed bath .",
    "we note that although the final state in presence of thermal baths is independent of the initial states , the details of the evolution may differ depending of the starting point .",
    "moreover as we discuss in detail below for a squeezed bath the steady state also depends on the initial condition .",
    "since we are interested in configurations with a high entanglement degree we choose in each case a pure bell state as the initial configuration . in what follows",
    "we show the results for the initial states @xmath53 and @xmath54 . for other possibilities",
    "either the initial bell state belongs to the decoherence free subspace and then the evolution is trivial or the resulting evolution is similar to discussed cases .",
    "the master equation for a pair of two - level particles in the presence of two independent thermal baths is @xmath55 where @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 is the vacuum decay constant .",
    "we assume that both baths have the same temperature _ i.e. _ they have the same average number @xmath59 of thermal photons .",
    "it is easy to show that evolution with this master equation preserves the form of states defined by ( [ matrixform ] ) .",
    "when bell states are taken as initial conditions one obtains for the non zero elements @xmath60 of ( [ matrixform ] ) a set of equations whose solutions can be found either analytically or numerically . in the particular case @xmath61 the system analytical solutions are discussed in section ( [ sec5 ] ) . meanwhile , using the results of the previous section , we obtain numerically the evolution of the entanglement and of the maximum extractable entanglement . in figures",
    "( [ figure1 ] ) and ( [ figure2 ] ) we plot the evolution of concurrence and maximum extractable entanglement for two different initial states . in the first case",
    "we take @xmath53 as initial state and in the second the initial state is @xmath54 .    in this case as in the case with a common bath discussed below sudden death of the entanglement appears sharply .",
    "the death time may be computed analytically but the result depends on the initial state and is not particularly illustrating . in the current case",
    "there is a slightly better preservation of entanglement for the the first initial condition but the entanglement evolution is quite similar for both of them . on the contrary the evolution of the maximum extractable entanglement is very different .",
    "this difference is particularly evident for early times .",
    "it may be understood as the result of a balance between two characteristics of the state : the degree of mixing and the entanglement . for a pure state with non vanishing concurrence",
    "the maximum extractable entanglement is always 1 .",
    "correspondingly the filtering operations are more efficient on states which are almost pure . on the other hand for a mixed state with a very small concurrence",
    "the filtering operation is not able to improve the degree of entanglement .",
    "this is illustrated with the use of entropy defined in ( [ entropy ] ) . in figure ( [ figure1 ] )",
    "the entropy decays sufficiently fast and the maximum extractable entanglement remains larger until entanglement sudden death when of course it also vanish .",
    "for the second case ( figure ( [ figure2 ] ) ) the entropy for the second initial condition decays too slowly and when the state finally is almost pure ( entropy almost zero ) there is no longer sufficient entanglement to be enhanced .    for a pair of two level particles in the presence of a common thermal bath",
    "the master equation becomes : @xmath62\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath63 .",
    "the form of the matrix ( [ matrixform ] ) is also preserved in this evolution and as in the previous case one obtains the differential equations for to the non zero elements . in figure ( [ figure3 ] ) the evolution of concurrence and maximum extractable entanglement",
    "is displayed for the initial state @xmath53 and in figure ( [ figure4 ] ) for the case in which the initial state is @xmath54 .     in a common thermal bath , ( @xmath51     in a common thermal bath of @xmath52    in figure ( [ figure4 ] )",
    "we observe that although in this case concurrence always decreases there is a sector in which we obtain a revival of the extractable entanglement .",
    "in other words a decreasing of concurrence does not always imply decreasing of maximum extractable entanglement .",
    "this is a more dramatic consequence of the competition between entanglement and mixing , discussed in the case above .",
    "finally we consider evolution of a pair of two level particles in the presence of a common squeezed bath .",
    "the master equation is @xmath64\\nonumber \\\\ & -&\\frac{\\gamma m}{2}\\left[e^{i\\psi } ( 2\\sigma ^{\\dagger } { \\rho } \\sigma^{\\dagger } - \\sigma ^{\\dagger } \\sigma ^{\\dagger } { \\rho } - { \\rho } \\sigma^{\\dagger } \\sigma ^{\\dagger } ) -e^{-i\\psi } ( 2\\sigma { \\rho } \\sigma -\\sigma \\sigma { \\rho } -{\\rho } \\sigma",
    "\\sigma ) \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the parameters of the squeezing .",
    "once again as in the previous cases , one can verify that the master equation preserves the symmetric form ( [ matrixform ] ) of the @xmath67 matrix .     in a common squeezed bath , (",
    "@xmath51     in a common squeezed bath of @xmath52    one of the most interesting properties of this system is the existence of a decoherence free subspace @xcite spanned by the states @xmath68 @xmath69 each of these states is a stationary state of the dynamics defined by the master equation ( [ mastereqsquezz ] ) @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "moreover for states with no contribution of the singlet state @xmath70 the system is driven to the pure state @xmath71 . only for initial conditions with non vanishing components along @xmath70 and some other direction",
    "the final state is a mixed state in the decoherence free subspace@xcite .",
    "this is reflected in the evolution of the system shown in figures ( [ figure5 ] ) and ( [ figure6 ] ) .",
    "as one can observe in these figures this system displays two interesting effects which are the revival of entanglement and of the maximum extractable entanglement .",
    "moreover in the stationary regime almost all the entanglement is recovered .",
    "this is explained by the fact that for these initial conditions there is no component in the direction of @xmath70 and explained above the final state is the pure state @xmath71 whose maximum extractable entanglement is 1 .",
    "this is further illustrated by the behavior of the entropy which in each case goes to zero confirming that the final state is a pure state .",
    "in this section we consider the @xmath61 case for two independent baths with @xmath53 as initial state .",
    "the non zero components of the density matrix satisfies the following equations , @xmath72 for @xmath73 the solutions of these differential equations are , @xmath74 @xmath75 @xmath76 @xmath77 for any finite @xmath78 when @xmath79 @xmath80 then from ( [ equ1]-[equ2 ] ) and ( [ equ3]-[equ5 ] ) one obtains @xmath81 the optimal state at any time is equal to the initial bell state @xmath82 . using an infinite boost eq.([infi ] ) tells that the complete initial entanglement is recoverable .",
    "one can also partially recover the entanglement to any desired degree at any finite time using a finite boost . by a numerical analysis one verifies that with the boost @xmath83 one",
    "recovers almost all the entanglement at any finite time @xmath84 . in figure ( [ figure7 ] )",
    "we show the extracted entanglement with @xmath85 . in this case one",
    "recovers almost all the entanglement if @xmath86 .     in a common squeezed bath of @xmath87",
    "in this work we studied the evolution of the maximum extractable entanglement for an open system of two qubits considering three different interactions with the environment . for two independent thermal baths at zero temperature",
    "we show that it is possible to recover almost all the initial entanglement using finite operations of local filtering . in the case of a common thermal bath we observed during the evolution an increasing of the maximum extractable entanglement when entanglement was in fact diminishing . related to this",
    "is important to note that the maximum extractable entanglement is a property of the state and not of the evolution . in this case",
    "what is happening is that evolution drove the system to states with less entanglement but more extractable entanglement .",
    "this suggest as a strategy to manipulate efficiently the entanglement to set the conditions of interaction of the system with the environment in such a way not to preserve maximum entanglement but maximum extractable entanglement .",
