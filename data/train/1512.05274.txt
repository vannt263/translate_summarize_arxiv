    "these griffiths effects are due to sample - to - sample fluctuations , producing non - self - averaging within the shrinking critical dynamical region , rather than the existence of rrs of actual griffiths phases .",

    "alternatively , such results can describe the behavior of systems in which power - law degree distribution in modules make up a very weakly coupled network .",
    "more specifically for free cutoff networks , we found an asymptotic logarithmic decay of density in time in the interval @xmath132 . here",
    "@xmath133 is associated with the activation of the most connected vertex  @xcite and @xmath1 describes the mutual activation of hubs that leads to an endemic phase of the network  @xcite .",
    "both thresholds go to zero at the infinite size limit with @xmath134 , implying that for finite sizes there exists a detectable extended interval with griffiths effects .",
    "the logarithm decay is explained by an optimal fluctuation theory for networks where fluctuating pseudo - critical points are considered . for structural and hard cutoffs the griffiths effects are weaker , resulting in nonuniversal power - law density decay tails within a smaller range of the control parameter .",
    "we attribute this to the lack of outliers , which causes weaker sample - to - sample heterogeneity and less fluctuating pseudo - critical points .",

    "<S> we provide numerical evidence for slow dynamics of the susceptible - infected - susceptible model evolving on finite - size random networks with power - law degree distributions . </S>",
    "<S> extensive simulations were done by averaging the activity density over many realizations of networks . </S>",
    "<S> we investigated the effects of outliers in both highly fluctuating ( natural cutoff ) and non - fluctuating ( hard cutoff ) most connected vertices . </S>",
    "<S> logarithmic and power - law decays in time were found for natural and hard cutoffs , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> this happens in extended regions of the control parameter space @xmath0 , suggesting griffiths effects , induced by the topological inhomogeneities . </S>",
    "<S> optimal fluctuation theory considering sample - to - sample fluctuations of the pseudo thresholds is presented to explain the observed slow dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> a quasistationary analysis shows that response functions remain bounded at @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we argue these to be signals of a smeared transition . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the thermodynamic limit the griffiths effects loose their relevancy and have a conventional critical point at @xmath2 . since many real networks are composed by heterogeneous and weakly connected modules </S>",
    "<S> , the slow dynamics found in our analysis of independent and finite networks can play an important role for the deeper understanding of such systems .    </S>",
    "<S> quenched randomness in interacting dynamical systems causes non - trivial critical behavior in nonequilibrium finite - dimensional systems  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> spatial randomness can be introduced , among other ways , in the form of dilution  @xcite or nonuniformity of the control parameters  @xcite or by topological heterogeneity of the connectivity structure of the interactions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one of the most noticeable effects of quenched ( or quasistatic ) disorder is the onset of dynamical criticality , manifested in diverging correlation times and slow decays of the order parameter in extended regions of the parameter space , rid of fine tuning  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this allows a potential for explaining widespread observation of criticality , even without the assumption of self - organized mechanisms  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> extended criticality induced by quenched disorder is grounded on the existence of rare regions ( rrs ) , which are large , randomly occurring patches that can linger for long times in a phase that differs from the global state of the system . </S>",
    "<S> lets consider interacting dynamical systems with active and inactive ( absorbing ) phases and a control parameter @xmath3 such that for @xmath4 the system is globally active ( supercritical ) and for @xmath5 it is inactive without long lived active rrs  @xcite . for @xmath6 , </S>",
    "<S> the activity in rrs lasts for very long ( exponential in patch size ) periods but fluctuations unavoidably end up the local activity due the finite size of the patches . </S>",
    "<S> convolution of low - probability rrs and exponentially long lifetimes results in a slow dynamics with nonuniversal exponents in the interval @xmath6 called griffiths phase ( gp )  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> complex networks constitute a fundamental theoretical framework to describe substrates where many dynamical processes , as epidemics , information , and transportation take place  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> heterogeneity ( disorder ) is an intrinsic hallmark of complex networks manifested through several forms of centralities  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the degree - centrality ranks among the most basic properties and is statistically represented by the degree probability distribution @xmath7 that a randomly selected vertex of the network has @xmath8 connections  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> many networks observed in nature have highly heterogeneous patterns of connectivity usually described by a power - law ( pl ) degree distribution . </S>",
    "<S> these can be scale - free ( sf ) networks  @xcite , characterized by heavy - tailed distribution @xmath7 with the ratio @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> other important measure of the dynamics on networks is the eigenvector centrality  @xcite associated with the principal eigenvector of the adjacency matrix defined as @xmath10 if vertices @xmath11 and @xmath12 are connected and 0 otherwise .    </S>",
    "<S> this intrinsic disordered nature of networks calls for analogues of gp and rr phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> this issue has recently been investigated @xcite and gps have been found in the contact process ( cp ) @xcite on finite - dimensional networks . </S>",
    "<S> it was conjectured that gps are not present in models on infinite - dimensional , small - world graphs , where the average distance between vertices increases logarithmically or slower with the network size  @xcite as , for example , the case of random pl networks . on the other hand , at models defined on hierarchical modular structures , where the inter - module connectivity is weak , gps were reported  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the susceptible - infected - susceptible ( sis ) epidemic model  @xcite , in which infected vertices spontaneously heal with rate 1 ( fixing the time scale ) and infect each of the susceptible nearest neighbors with rate @xmath3 , is a paradigmatic example of a non trivial dynamical process on complex networks . </S>",
    "<S> differing from other dynamical processes with transitions from active to inactive states , the sis threshold is governed by the activation of hubs , also called star subgraphs , and their mutual reinfection through connected paths  @xcite . as a consequence , the threshold is proved to be null in the infinite size limit for random networks with pl degree distribution @xmath13 , irrespective of the degree exponent @xmath14  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . some interesting physical mechanisms behind the rigorous proof of chatterjee and durret  @xcite were used by bogu _ </S>",
    "<S> et al_.  @xcite to unveil the nature of the epidemic threshold of the sis model . </S>",
    "<S> stars are graphs with @xmath15 leaves connected to a center that can themselves sustain long - term epidemic activity if @xmath16 . in pl networks </S>",
    "<S> the average highest degree diverges with the network size  @xcite , implying that more and more hubs become active stars at finite values of @xmath3 . due to the small - world property of random pl networks </S>",
    "<S> , the lifetime of hubs is large enough to permit infecting each other , sustaining epidemic activity in the network  @xcite .    in finite random networks , </S>",
    "<S> the sis dynamics is puzzling due to the highly fluctuating size and the number of stars realized in a network sample  @xcite . indeed </S>",
    "<S> , the effective finite - size epidemic threshold is finite  @xcite since @xmath17 for sufficiently small values of @xmath3 and stars alone can not sustain a long - term activity . </S>",
    "<S> several network realizations have just a few vertices with degree much larger than the rest of network , hereafter called outliers . </S>",
    "<S> outliers can sustain localized epidemics , with different activation thresholds for very long times , producing multiple transitions  @xcite . neglecting interactions among hubs , lee _ </S>",
    "<S> et al_.  @xcite predicted that the threshold for an endemic phase , in which a finite fraction of infected vertices is present , should take place at a finite value for @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is finite . according to lee _ </S>",
    "<S> et al_.  @xcite , the subcritical region is ruled by a gp , with an ultraslow ( logarithmic ) decay of activity , in odds with the rigorous results of null threshold for infinite pl networks  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this proposition was supported by numerical simulations on very large , but finite , random pl networks  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , in finite pl networks , a vanishing epidemic threshold is predicted by the quenched mean - field ( qmf ) theory  @xcite , in which the full connectivity structure of the network is included through the adjacency matrix  @xcite . in such models , griffiths effects </S>",
    "<S> were also shown in the localized phase for @xmath18  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> rr effects , localization , and heavy - tailed dynamics have also been shown in spreading models defined on weighted pl networks by suppressing hub infection via disassortative weight schemes @xcite , in random networks @xcite , or in aging barabasi - albert graphs @xcite .    although localization effects were obtained in simulations on finite networks  @xcite , the investigated systems were very large ( @xmath20 vertices ) , suggesting that these can be observable and relevant in many unavoidably finite real networks . </S>",
    "<S> aiming at a deeper understanding of the intricate behavior of epidemic spreading on finite - size networks , we investigate the dynamics of the sis model on a large ensemble of pl networks , using extensive numerical simulations . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the averaging over many independent graph realizations exhibits a slow dynamics , analogous to gps , in an interval of control parameter @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this region is delimited by two transitions : the former is related to the activation of the most connected hub of the network , while the latter is related to a smeared phase transition  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate that this region shrinks as the size of the network increases and disappears in the thermodynamic limit , implying the absence of gps . </S>",
    "<S> this is in agreement with the conjecture that finite dimensionality is required for the existence of gps  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , many real networks , as , for instance , brain connectomes , have a modular organization , where modules are finite , heterogeneous , and weakly connected  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> slow dynamics has been reported in models defined on hierarchical modular networks  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , performing analysis over independent , finite networks can be useful to understand these systems .    </S>",
