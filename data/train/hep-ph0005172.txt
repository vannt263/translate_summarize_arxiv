    "spin effects in high energy fragmentation processes have attracted much attention@xcite recently .",
    "study of such effects provide useful information for the spin structure of hadron and spin dependence of high energy reactions . there",
    "exist now two distinctively different pictures for the spin contents of the baryons : the static quark model picture using su(6 ) symmetric wave function [ hereafter referred as su(6 ) picture ] , and the picture drawn from the data for polarized deep inelastic lepton - nucleon scattering ( dis ) @xcite and su(3 ) flavor symmetry in hyperon decay [ hereafter referred as dis picture ] .",
    "it is natural to ask which picture is suitable to describe the relationship between the polarization of the fragmenting quark and that of the produced hadron .",
    "it has been pointed out in [ [ bl98 ] ] that measurements of @xmath1 longitudinal polarization in @xmath0 annihilation at high energies can provide useful information to answer this question .",
    "calculations based on these two different pictures have been made in [ [ gh93 ] ] and [ [ bl98 ] ] .",
    "a comparison of the obtained results with the aleph data@xcite obtained at lep , which was available at that time , was made .",
    "the result shows that the su(6 ) picture seems to agree better with the data@xcite .",
    "this is rather surprising since the energy is very high at lep and the initial quarks and anti - quarks produced at the annihilation vertices of the initial @xmath0 are certainly current quarks and current anti - quarks rather than the constituent quarks used in describing the static properties of hadrons using su(6 ) symmetric wave functions .",
    "other models@xcite are also proposed which can give a description of the available data@xcite .",
    "the available data@xcite are certainly still far from accurate and abundant enough to make a conclusive judgment of these different models .",
    "it is therefore important and urgent to make further checks of this conclusion by performing complementary measurements .    in this paper",
    ", we formulate the calculation method of longitudinal polarization of different hyperons in @xmath0 annihilation at high energies proposed in [ [ gh93 ] ] and [ [ bl98 ] ] in a systematic way so that they can be generalized to other hyperons and/or other reactions .",
    "we describe in detail the inputs and/or assumptions which have been used in the calculations .",
    "we then present the calculated results for different hyperons based on these two pictures .",
    "we present the results for the whole events as well as those for different particularly chosen event samples .",
    "we show that corresponding measurements can be used as complementary method to check the above mentioned conclusion .",
    "in particular , we discuss also how to distinguish such models from the kind of models proposed in [ [ kotz98],[ma2000 ] ] . in section 2 , we outline the calculation method and present the results for @xmath1 polarization . in section 3",
    ", we present our results for other hyperons .",
    "we recall that@xcite , according to the standard model of electroweak interactions , quarks and anti - quarks produced at the annihilation vertices of @xmath0 are longitudinally polarized .",
    "such longitudinal quark polarization can be transferred to the produced hadron which contains the initial quark thus lead to longitudinal polarization of hadron in the inclusive process @xmath2 .",
    "measuring the polarizations of the produced hadrons , we can study the relation between the spin of the fragmenting quark and that of the produced hadron which contains that quark . in this aspect ,",
    "the @xmath3 hyperons are most suitable candidates among all the hadrons .",
    "this is because these hyperons decay weakly so that their polarizations can easily be obtained from the angular distributions of their decay products .",
    "we now outline the calculation method of the longitudinal polarization @xmath4 of different hyperon @xmath5 in the inclusive process @xmath6 .",
    "since the longitudinal polarization @xmath4 of the hyperon @xmath5 in the inclusive process @xmath6 originates from the longitudinal polarization @xmath7 of the initial quark @xmath8 ( where the subscript @xmath9 denotes its flavor ) produced at the annihilation vertex of the initial state @xmath0 , we should consider the @xmath5 s which have the following different origins separately .",
    "\\(a ) hyperons which are directly produced and contain the initial quarks @xmath10 s originated from the annihilations of the initial @xmath11 and @xmath12 ;    \\(b ) hyperons which are decay products of other heavier hyperons which were polarized before their decay ;    \\(c ) hyperons which are directly produced but do not contain any initial quark @xmath10 from @xmath0 annihilation ;    \\(d ) hyperons which are decay products of other heavier hyperons which were unpolarized before their decay .",
    "it is clear that hyperons in groups ( a ) and ( b ) can be polarized .",
    "those in group ( a ) are polarized @xcite since the polarization of the initial quark @xmath10 can be transferred to such hyperon @xmath5 s in the fragmentation process .",
    "we denote the probability for this polarization transfer by @xmath13 and call it polarization transfer factor from quark @xmath14 to hyperon @xmath5 , where the superscript @xmath15 stands for fragmentation .",
    "hyperons in group ( b ) can be polarized since such hyperons can inherit part of the polarization of the parent hyperons in the decay process .",
    "we denote the probability for this polarization transfer by @xmath16 and call it polarization transfer factor from hyperon @xmath17 to hyperon @xmath5 , where the superscript @xmath18 stands for decay .",
    "in contrast , hyperons in groups ( c ) and ( d ) are unpolarized .",
    "hence , we obtain that the polarization of the final hyperon is , @xmath19 here @xmath7 is the polarization of the initial quark @xmath10 ; @xmath20 is the average number of the hyperons which are directly produced and contain the initial quark of flavor @xmath9 ; @xmath21 is the polarization of the hyperon @xmath17 before its decay ; @xmath22 is average numbers of @xmath5 hyperons coming from the decay of @xmath17 hyperons which are polarized ; @xmath23 ) , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are average numbers of hyperons in group ( a ) ,",
    "( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) respectively .",
    "these different factors can be calculated in the following way .",
    "longitudinal polarization of the initial quark @xmath10 is determined by the standard model for electroweak interactions .",
    "the polarization comes from the weak interactions and the results for @xmath27 can be found e.g. in [ [ ar80 ] ] , i.e. , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the angle between the outgoing quark and the incoming electron , the subscript @xmath9 denotes the flavor of the quark , and @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the mass and decay width of @xmath36 ; @xmath37",
    "@xmath38 @xmath39 @xmath40 are the vector and axial vector coupling constants of electron and quark to @xmath36 boson , and @xmath41 is the weinberg angle . to see the size and the @xmath29-dependence of @xmath7 , we show in fig.1 the numerical results of @xmath42 as a function of @xmath43 at lep i energy .",
    "we see clearly that all the quarks produced at the @xmath0 annihilation vertices are longitudinally with significantly high polarizations .",
    "we see also that the magnitude of the polarization of the down - type quarks ( @xmath44 and @xmath45 ) is large and varies little with the angle @xmath29 , while that of the up - type quarks ( @xmath46 and @xmath47 ) is a little bit smaller and has a relatively larger variation in the whole range of @xmath43 . the latter increases with @xmath43 from 0.58 at @xmath48 to 0.74 at @xmath49 . averaging over @xmath29",
    ", we obtain , @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the angular variation of the unpolarized cross section . in fig.2",
    ", we show @xmath52 as a function of the total @xmath0 center - of - mass energy @xmath53 .",
    "we see that , at the lep i energy , i.e. @xmath54 , the polarizations of quarks have the maximum negative value , i.e. , @xmath55 for @xmath56 , and @xmath57 for @xmath58 and @xmath45 . from the lep i energy to the lep ii energy , the polarizations decrease a bit but it is still very large at the lep ii energy ( @xmath59 ) , where we have @xmath60 for @xmath56 , and @xmath61 for @xmath58 and @xmath45 .    at lep",
    "ii energy , the @xmath62 events , i.e. @xmath63 , are significant .",
    "it takes about 10% of the whole events .",
    "the polarizations for the initial quarks in such events are different from those in @xmath64 , and should be considered separately in the calculations . according to the standard model for electroweak interactions ,",
    "the polarization of initial quark and that of initial anti - quark created in @xmath65 or @xmath66 decay vertex are equal to -1.0 and 1.0 , respectively .",
    "there exists also another type of events , i.e. @xmath67 , which contribute at lep ii energy . but",
    "this contribution is very small ( less than 1% ) .",
    "we will not consider such events in the following calculations .",
    "the fragmentation polarization transfer factor @xmath13 from the initial quark @xmath14 to hyperon @xmath5 is equal to the fraction of spin carried by the @xmath9-flavor - quark divided by the average number of quark of flavor @xmath9 in the hyperon @xmath5@xcite .",
    "this fractional contribution to the hyperon spin from @xmath9-flavor - quark is different in the above - mentioned su(6 ) or the dis picture .",
    "the results in the su(6 ) picture can easily be obtained from the wave functions . in the dis picture , the fractional contribution of quarks of different flavors to the spin of a baryon in the @xmath68 octet is extracted from @xmath69 obtained in deep - inelastic lepton - proton scattering experiments@xcite and the constants @xmath15 and @xmath18 obtained from hyperon decay experiments .",
    "the way of doing this extraction is now in fact quite standard ( see , for example , the appendix in [ [ bl98 ] ] ) . the results for @xmath1 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 hyperons have been obtained in [ [ jaffe96 ] ] and [ [ bl98 ] ] . using exactly the same way",
    ", we obtain also the results for @xmath72 . for completeness , we list the results for all the @xmath3 hyperons in table 1 .    in the calculations ,",
    "we take also the contributions from the decay of @xmath73 , i.e. the decuplet hyperons into account .",
    "the polarizations of such hyperons in the su(6 ) picture can easily be calculated using the su(6 ) symmetric wave functions .",
    "but , it is presently impossible to calculate them in the dis picture since no dis data is available for any one of the decuplet baryons . therefore , in the calculation we take them into account in the same way as those in the su(6 ) picture .",
    "the decay polarization transfer factor @xmath16 is determined by the decay process and is independent of the process in which @xmath17 is produced .",
    "the results for different decay processes are different and will be given for each individual hyperon in the following sections of this paper .    after we obtain the results for @xmath7 , @xmath13 and @xmath16 , we can calculate @xmath4 if we know the average numbers @xmath20 , @xmath22 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 for hyperons @xmath5 from the different origins .",
    "these average numbers are determined by the hadronization mechanism and should be independent of the polarization of the initial quarks . hence , we can calculate them using the a hadronization model which give a good description of the unpolarized data for multiparticle production in high energy reactions . presently , such calculations can only be carried out using a monte - carlo event generator .",
    "we use the lund string fragmentation model@xcite implemented by jetset @xcite in the following .      among all the @xmath3 hyperons , @xmath1 is most copiously produced .",
    "furthermore , the spin structure of @xmath1 in the @xmath74 picture is very special , which makes it play a very special role in distinguishing the su(6 ) and the dis pictures . in the @xmath74 picture ,",
    "spin of @xmath1 is completely carried by the @xmath75 valence quark , while the @xmath46 and @xmath76 quarks have no contribution . since the initial @xmath75 quark produced in the annihilation of the initial @xmath0 takes the maximum negative polarization , @xmath77 obtained using the su(6 ) picture is the maximum among all the different models . in contrast , in the dis picture , the @xmath75 quark carries only about @xmath78 of the @xmath1 spin , while the @xmath46 or @xmath76 quark each carries about @xmath79 ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the resulting @xmath77 should be substantially smaller than that obtained in the @xmath74 picture . comparing the maximum with experimental results provide us a good test of the validity of the picture .",
    "@xmath1 is also the lightest hyperon , so the final @xmath1 s produced in high energy reactions contain contributions from the decays of many different heavier hyperons .",
    "there are three octet , i.e. @xmath70 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 , and five decuplet , i.e. , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , hyperons that can decay to @xmath1 .",
    "the polarization transfer in @xmath84 has been studied in [ [ gatto58 ] ] , the result for the polarization transfer factor @xmath85 is @xmath86 .",
    "@xmath87 is a parity non - conserving decay and is dominated by s - wave .",
    "the polarization transfer @xmath88 for this process is equal to @xmath89 , where @xmath90 can be found in review of particle properties [ [ c98 ] ] .",
    "the decay process from the decuplet hyperon to octet hyperon and a pseudo - scalar meson @xmath91 such as @xmath92 or @xmath93 is dominated by the @xmath94 wave@xcite , and the octet hyperon will get the same polarization as that of the initial decuplet hyperon , i.e. , @xmath95 . for explicity , we list all these results for @xmath96 in table.2 .",
    "there are also some contributions from the decays of open charm or open beauty baryons .",
    "the polarization transfer factors in these decay processes are unfortunately unknown yet .",
    "this is a theoretical uncertainty in the calculations .",
    "however , according to the materials in review of particle properties@xcite , we do know that each of these open charm or open beauty baryons can decay to @xmath1 through many different channels .",
    "the contributions to @xmath1 polarization in these different channels may be quite different .",
    "we expect that the net contribution from all these channels can not be large .",
    "we will just neglect it in our calculations .    using jetset and pythia",
    ", we obtain the average numbers @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 at @xmath101 gev and those at @xmath102200 gev , respectively .",
    "we show them in fig.3 and fig.4 .",
    "the results at @xmath101 gev are of course the same as those in [ [ gh93 ] ] and [ [ bl98 ] ] . from these figures , we see clearly that contribution to @xmath1 from the events originating from the initial @xmath75 quarks play the most important role , in particular for large @xmath103 . for example , for @xmath104 , it gives about 70% of the whole @xmath1 s , while those from the events initiated by @xmath46 or @xmath76 take only 10% respectively .",
    "using the results for the @xmath7 s , the @xmath105 s , and the @xmath16 s mentioned above , we obtain the longitudinal polarization of @xmath1 as shown in fig.5 .",
    "a comparison of those results at lep i with the aleph data @xcite and the opal data @xcite shows that the data@xcite of both groups agree better with the calculated results based on the @xmath74 picture .",
    "but , these available data@xcite are still far from accurate and enormous enough to make a decisive conclusion .",
    "further complementary measurements are needed .    at the lep ii energy ,",
    "@xmath62 events take about 10% of the whole events .",
    "we expect that such events give a even more significant contribution to @xmath1 polarization , since the polarization of the initial quark at @xmath65 or @xmath66 decay vertex is 100% , which is larger than those from the @xmath106 .",
    "since there are two initial quarks and two initial anti - quarks in @xmath62 events , the energy of each of them should be much smaller than those in the @xmath106 events .",
    "hence , such events should contribute mainly in relatively smaller @xmath103 regions .",
    "adding all the different together , we obtain @xcite @xmath107 at lep ii energy shown in fig.5 .",
    "we see that , compared with those obtained at the lep i energy , @xmath77 at lep ii energy is a little larger at small @xmath103 region , and is a little smaller at large @xmath103 region .",
    "this is consistent with the above - mentioned qualitative expectations and can be checked experimentally .      in the two models we discussed above",
    ", @xmath1 polarization comes solely from the hyperons which contain the initial quark created at the @xmath0 annihilation vertex .",
    "the contributions are very much different for the hyperons which contain the initial @xmath75 from those which contain the initial @xmath46 or @xmath76 quarks . there is also a big differences between the contribution from the hyperons which contain the initial quarks and that from those which do not .",
    "it is thus clear that we can get a further check of the two pictures if we study the @xmath1 polarization in events which originate from the initial @xmath46 or @xmath76 quark or those which originate from the initial @xmath75 quark separately .",
    "we should also get a very sensitive check to different pictures if we study only those @xmath1 s which contain the initial quarks .    in this connection",
    ", it should also be mentioned that there exist another different type of models@xcite for spin transfer in fragmentation processes .",
    "in contrast to that described in subsection [ subs : method ] , in these models , no distinction is made between the hyperons which contain the initial quarks or those which do not contain the initial quarks .",
    "some of them@xcite even do not distinct those which are directly produced or those which come from heavier hyperon decays .",
    "in other words , in these models , there is no distinction between hyperons from the groups ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) .",
    "it is simply assumed that a `` reciprocity relation '' is valid between the fragmentation function for the final hyperons and the corresponding quark distribution functions in the hyperons .",
    "they are taken as proportional to each other , with a proportional constant which is common for quarks of different flavors .",
    "the hyperon polarization can easily be calculated in such models if the spin - dependent quark distribution functions are known .",
    "the obtained results depend obviously very much on the spin - dependent quark distributions , which are used as theoretical input .",
    "since the spin dependent quark distributions in hyperons are still poorly known yet , the obtained results can be very much different from each other if different sets of quark distributions are used .",
    "but , since the ( polarized ) fragmentation function from a given quark @xmath8 to a given hyperon @xmath5 depends only on the fractional momentum @xmath103 of the quark carried by the produced hyperon , the obtained polarization at a given @xmath103 should be completely the same if we study only those hyperons which contain the initial quarks or all of them in events originating from a given type of initial quark .",
    "it is unfortunately impossible to make a complete separation of hyperons in these different groups in experiments .",
    "however , it should be possible to separate the events into different subsamples , in each of which the hyperons from one group dominate . measuring @xmath1 polarization in such subsamples of events should give further complementary checks of the different models mentioned above . using the monte - carlo event generator jetset @xcite , we can study the various possibilities in this direction .",
    "we note that , if a @xmath1 originates from the initial @xmath75 quark , the leading particle in the opposite direction should contain the @xmath108 produced in the @xmath0 annihilation vertex .",
    "hence , we choose an event sample according to the following criteria :    \\(i ) @xmath1 is the leading in one direction ;    \\(ii ) the leading particle in the opposite direction is @xmath109 .",
    "we expect that such @xmath1 s should mainly have the origin ( a ) mentioned in the subsection [ subs : method ] . in fig.6 , we show the results obtained from jetset for the average numbers of @xmath1 s of different origins .",
    "we see that such leading @xmath1 s indeed mainly originate from the initial @xmath75 quark .",
    "the contribution from the initial @xmath46 or @xmath76 quark is indeed substantially small .",
    "it takes only about 3% of such @xmath1 s .",
    "in particular , in @xmath110 region there is almost no contribution from the initial @xmath46 or @xmath76 quark at all .    using eq.(1 ) , we calculated @xmath107 for the events under the conditions ( i ) and ( ii ) using the su(6 ) and the dis pictures .",
    "the comparison of the obtained results with those obtained in the average events are shown in fig.7 .",
    "we see that there is indeed a significant difference between the results obtained for such particularly chosen events and those for the average events in particular in the region of @xmath111 .",
    "checking such differences by measuring @xmath107 for such events can be helpful in distinguishing the validity of different pictures for the spin transfer in fragmentation processes .",
    "the production rates for other octet hyperons are smaller than that for @xmath1 so the statistic errors should be larger for the polarizations of these hyperons . on the other hand , decay contributions from heavier hyperons to these hyperons are also much less significant than that in case of @xmath1 .",
    "hence , the contaminations from the decay processes are much smaller . these conclusions can easily be checked using a monte - carlo event generator for @xmath0 annihilation into hadrons . in fig.8",
    ", we show the results obtained from jetset for these hyperons compared with those for @xmath1 .",
    "we see that , the production rate for @xmath112 or @xmath80 is less than @xmath113 of that for @xmath1 . on the other hand ,",
    "we see also that the contribution from heavier hyperon decays is also much smaller . for example , for @xmath112 s , the decay contribution takes only about @xmath114 of the total rate .",
    "the situations for @xmath115 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 are similar to that for @xmath112 .",
    "most of them are directly produced .",
    "hence , the theoretical uncertainties in the calculations for these hyperons are much smaller . the study of polarizations of these hyperons should provide us with good complementary tests of different pictures . in this section",
    ", we calculate the longitudinal polarizations of these hyperons , i.e. , @xmath112 , @xmath115 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 , in @xmath0 annihilation at lep i and lep ii energies .",
    "the calculations are quite similar to those for @xmath1 production .",
    "the general procedure is the same and has been outlined in last section .",
    "the polarization transfer factor @xmath13 are given in table 1 .",
    "the situation for decay contributions is quite simple : there are only contribution from the corresponding decuplet hyperon decays .",
    "more precisely , @xmath116 contains only decay contribution from @xmath117 and @xmath71 has the decay contribution from @xmath118 .",
    "both decay processes are strong decays and are dominated by the p - wave .",
    "the polarization transfer is the same as that in @xmath119 , i.e. @xmath120 .",
    "first , although the spin structure of @xmath112 and that of @xmath115 or that of @xmath80 and that of @xmath81 are symmetric under the exchange of @xmath46 and @xmath76 ( c.f .",
    "table 1 ) , their polarizations should be quite different from each other .",
    "this is because the polarization of the initial @xmath46 and that of the initial @xmath76 produced at the @xmath0 annihilation vertices are quite different .",
    "this can be seen clearly in fig.1 , where we see that the magnitude of the polarization of @xmath46 quark is smaller than that of @xmath76 quark .",
    "second , from table 1 , we see that the contributions from the two different flavors in these hyperons ( @xmath121 , @xmath122 ) are quite different : they have different signs and different magnitudes , and the differences are also different in the su(6 ) or the dis picture .",
    "this implies that their contributions to hyperon polarizations are also quite different .",
    "they should have different signs and different magnitudes .",
    "these differences make the situation very interesting .",
    "we should have different expectations for different hyperons .",
    "even the signs of polarizations of some hyperons in the two different pictures can be different from each other .    using jetset and pythia , we calculated the different contributions to @xmath112 , @xmath115 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 from all the different sources discussed above at lep i and lep ii , respectively .",
    "the results at lep i energy are shown in fig.9 .",
    "those at lep ii energy are similar and are not shown . from this fig.9 , we see that the @xmath112 s mainly come from the initial @xmath75 and the initial @xmath46-quark , and that the @xmath115 s come mainly from the initial @xmath75 and the initial @xmath76-quark , and that these two contributions are comparable with each other in particular for @xmath115 s .",
    "in contrast , the source for @xmath122 is very pure : they come predominately from the initial @xmath75-quarks .",
    "all the others are negligible .    using eq.(1 ) and",
    "the results shown in fig.9 , we calculated the hyperon polarizations , @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "the obtained results are shown in fig.10 . from these results , we see clearly that the polarizations are different for these different hyperons , and that there are considerably large differences between the results using the @xmath74 picture and those using the dis picture . in particular , we see that @xmath123 in the @xmath74 picture has opposite sign to that in the dis picture .",
    "but their magnitudes are relatively small .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath125 and that of @xmath126 are considerably larger , in particular in the large @xmath103 region .",
    "this is because the contribution to @xmath80 or @xmath81 is very clear .",
    "they come mainly from the initial @xmath75-quark .",
    "there is thus little theoretical uncertainty in calculating @xmath127 .",
    "hence , although the statistics may be much worse than @xmath1 , there are still good reasons to study @xmath127 in @xmath128 at lep energies .",
