    "high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxb ) are systems composed by a massive , early type star which provides the matter to an accreting compact object , typically a highly - magnetized neutron star , @xmath2 .",
    "this has been inferred from the presence in their x - ray spectra of absorption - like features , which are interpreted as cyclotron resonant scattering features ( crsf ) , where @xmath3 kev , and _",
    "b _ is the magnetic field of neutron star .",
    "such strong magnetic fields channel the accretion flow towards the magnetic poles of the neutron star .",
    "the resulting anisotropy induces a modulation in the radiation emitted by the neutron star , which is then observed as an x - ray pulsar ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for recent reviews ) .",
    "the accreted matter may come either from an accretion disk , via roche lobe overflow , or directly from the wind of the massive companion .",
    "wind - fed hmxbs are further sub - divided into two groups , super - giant and be systems , depending on the properties of the donor star . in particular , be stars are fast - rotating ob stars in which the outflow takes the form of a dense equatorial disk , as suggested by observations of broad emission lines at optical / infrared wavelengths ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "be / hmxb exhibit long periods of quiescence , interrupted by bursts of activity which are classified in two groups @xcite .",
    "the so - called type i , or normal , outbursts occur quasi - periodically at orbital phases close to the periastron passage , and reach a luminosity of @xmath4 at most .",
    "they are likely related to an increase in the accretion rate due to the passage of the pulsar through the equatorial disk of the companion . on the other hand ,",
    "type ii ( giant ) outbursts are less frequent , with no apparent correlation with the orbital phase , and can reach a luminosity close to the eddington limit , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the mass of the neutron star . the origin of type ii outbursts is not clear and still matter for debate ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "interestingly , these changes in luminosity can be used to test the accretion theory on strongly - magnetized pulsars at different accretion rates . in accreting pulsars a radiation - dominated shock forms in the accretion column at a luminosity @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "as the matter passes through the shock , it gives away most of its kinetic energy , which is transferred to the radiation field .",
    "below the shock , the accreted matter slowly sinks towards the surface of the pulsar where it can be further decelerated .",
    "the final deceleration depends on the luminosity . for a certain critical value @xmath8 , which depends on the properties of the neutron star , like e.g. the mass and the strength of magnetic field ( see equation 32 of *",
    "* ) , the pressure exerted by the upward radiation flux is such that the accretion flow arrives at the surface of the pulsar with zero speed . above this critical value the dynamics of the accreted matter",
    "is dominated by radiation pressure , and both the radiative shock and the line forming region are expected to move upwards where the magnetic field is lower .",
    "this in turn implies an anti - correlation between the energy of the cyclotron line and the luminosity of the source , as reported e.g. for the be / hmxb systems 4u 0115 + 63 and v0332 + 53 ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , in sources below the critical luminosity , the radiation pressure can not stop completely the in - falling matter , which is instead decelerated by coulomb interactions towards the base of the accretion column @xcite . in this case , the height of the region where the deceleration occurs decreases with luminosity ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) and , because of the increase of magnetic field at lower altitudes , a positive correlation between the energy of the cyclotron line and the flux is then expected . such behavior has been observed e.g. in her x-1 , gx 304@xmath91 , _ swift _ j1626.6@xmath95156 , and vela x-1 @xcite .",
    "a0535 + 26 ( a0535 hereafter ) is a transient be / hmxb discovered by the _",

    "after its discovery , a0535 exhibited several bursting episodes of both types i and ii .",
    "the hard x - ray spectrum of the source during these outbursts showed two prominent absorption lines at about 45 and 100 kev ( e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .    at variance with the examples reported above",
    ", the energy of the fundamental cyclotron line in a0535 was found to be remarkably stable at @xmath14 in almost all observations of the source .",
    "the only exception occurred during a short flaring episode in which a higher value , @xmath15 , was reported @xcite .",
    "this increase in the observed cyclotron energy was coupled with changes of the pulse profile , and was explained by the occurrence of instabilities in the magnetosphere of the pulsar leading to a sudden increase in the accretion rate and changes in the geometry of the accretion column @xcite . according to @xcite , and @xcite , a0535 exhibits a positive correlation of the cyclotron energy with the luminosity on a pulse phase - dependent basis . while this result suggests that the source is in the sub - critical regime , a definitive proof of the correlation of the cyclotron lines with the luminosity in a0535 is still lacking .",
    "dedicated observations of a0535 during a giant outburst are thus important in order to extend the range of luminosity covered by spectroscopic studies of the source . in this regard , the two previous giant outbursts ( may / june 2005 and december 2009 ) were not well suited for the task due to sun constraints , i.e. the source was too close to the sun in the sky to be safely observed .",
    "on the other hand , the giant outburst of february 2011 was well covered by several instruments , and it offers a unique possibility to reveal changes , or lack thereof , in the spectral properties of a0535 and their relation with the observed luminosity , thus probing the accretion regime of the source . an analysis of _ swift_/bat and _ integral_/isgri data below 80 kev taken during the outburst has been presented by @xcite , where they reported that the energy of the fundamental cyclotron line was stable on all but one of the _ integral_/isgri observations .    in this paper",

    "we also extract event lists corresponding to each data sub - set in order to follow the evolution of the pulsar spin period and of the associated pulse profiles .",
    "the analysis of the source spectra has been performed with xspec 12.8.2 @xcite .",
    "the hard x - ray emission of accreting pulsars is thought to originate from the thermal and bulk comptonization of seed photons in the accretion column ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * for details ) .",
    "the resulting spectral shape can be well approximated by a power law continuum with exponential cut - off at high energies ( cutoffpl in xspec ) , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 are respectively the spectral index of the power law , the folding energy and the normalization constant of the model spectrum , and @xmath28 is the energy of the incoming photons in kev .",
    "we first perform a fit of each spectrum with this model .",
    "we notice that the spectrum of rev .",
    "1028 has low count statistics , hence we exclude it from the spectral analysis .    all spectra show large structured residuals around @xmath14 ( see figure [ fig_spectra ] ) , pointing out the presence of the fundamental cyclotron feature in our data",
    ". we account for this feature by including a multiplicative absorption line with gaussian profile ( gabs in xspec ) in the spectral model , which becomes @xmath29 $ ] , where @xmath30 $ ] and @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 are respectively the centroid energy , the width , and the depth of the cyclotron line .",
    "this results in significant improvements in the @xmath34 in all cases .",
    "we notice that there is a strong coupling between the spectral index and the cut - off energy of the continuum model ( figure [ fig_continuum_degen ] ) .",
    "in addition , the width of the absorption line is anti - correlated with parameters of the continuum .",
    "this may result in unrealistic values of the fit parameters .",
    "for this reason , we fix the spectral index to an average value , @xmath35 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and repeat the fits ,    to assess the significance of the absorption lines we proceeded as follows .",
    "first , for each data - set we generate 10000 simulated spectra with the in - built fakeit command from xspec , using the best - fit model as a template .",
    "then we fit each simulated spectrum with either the cutoffpl or the cutoffpl * gabs models , imposing that the energy of the line is equal to the corresponding best - fit value , and taking note of the resulting @xmath34 . from these",
    "we build the distribution of the _ f _ statistics , defined as @xmath36 ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , where @xmath37 is the number of degrees of freedom of model _",
    "i _ and the subscripts @xmath38 correspond respectively , to the models without and with the absorption line .",
    "finally we infer the probability of a chance improvement of the @xmath34 by counting how many times the simulated values of _ f _ were larger than that obtained from the real data . in all cases",
    "the estimated chance probability is lower than @xmath39 , implying a significance greater than @xmath40 .",
    "from part b of rev .",
    "1021 onward the spectrum exhibits structured residuals at @xmath41 .",
    "the existence of a second cyclotron line at @xmath42 kev in the spectrum of this source has been reported several times in the past ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the residuals observed in our spectra are likely due to this feature .",
    "as in the case of the line at lower energy , we perform simulations in order to assess the significance of these absorption lines , where we now include the fundamental feature at @xmath43 in the null hypothesis .",
    "the line is formally significant ( @xmath44 ) for rev .",
    "1021b , 1022 , 1023 , and 1026 , while for rev .",
    "1024 the significance is barely @xmath45 .",
    "we nevertheless include the second line in the spectral model for all these observations . finally , for rev .",
    "1025 and 1027 we find no evidence of residuals around 100 kev , possibly due to a lack of statistic caused by the combined effect of the fading flux of the source and of the short exposure times .",
    "we report the results of the spectral fitting in table [ table_specfit ] , where all the uncertainties are at the @xmath46 confidence level and have been estimated by means of simulations .    for each spectrum , we estimate the corresponding flux in the @xmath47 kev range , and normalize it to that of the crab nebula obtained simultaneously from the same observations ( figure [ fig_flux_vs_time ] ) .",
    "the flux reaches a maximum of @xmath48 ( @xmath49 crab ) during rev .",
    "this corresponds , at a distance of @xmath50 kpc , to a luminosity @xmath51 , where we assumed isotropic emission and a bolometric correction factor of 40% @xcite .",
    "we then look for possible correlations of the spectral parameters with the observed flux , in order to constrain the accretion regime of the source .",
    "we find that the cut - off energy of the spectral continuum is anti - correlated with the flux ( figure [ fig_spec_vs_flux ] , upper panel ) .",
    "accordingly , the spectrum softens as the flux increases , as showed by the hardness ratio between fluxes in the @xmath52 and @xmath53 kev bands ( lower panel of figure [ fig_spec_vs_flux ] ) .",
    "the boundaries of the two energy bands were chosen in order to limit as much as possible the contribution of the two cyclotron lines .",
    "intriguingly , the relations between the parameters of the fundamental cyclotron line and the flux of the source differ between each other ( figure [ fig_lines_vs_flux ] , left panels ) .",
    "the centroid energy @xmath54 is positively - correlated with the flux of a0535 , going from @xmath55 kev at high luminosity ( rev .",
    "1021b ) to @xmath56 kev at low luminosity ( rev .",
    "we notice that the energy of the line at the lowest luminosity ( rev .",
    "1027 ) is compatible with that from the previous revolution , which implies a possible change in the correlation at about this luminosity .",
    "on the other hand , the width of the line @xmath57 remains in the @xmath58 range , and it does not exhibit a correlation with the flux , while the line depth @xmath59 presents a clear anti - correlation with the flux ( see figure [ fig_lines_vs_flux ] ) , going from @xmath60 at low luminosity to @xmath61 at high luminosity .",

    "it can be observed that the depth of the line exhibits significant variations during the outburst , while the variations of the centroid energy are less significant .",
    "the parameters of the line at the end of the outburst are very close to the ones at the beginning with similar flux level , suggesting the absence of hysteresis effects during the outburst .",
    "finally , we find no correlation between the flux of the source and the parameters of the first harmonic .",
    "however , the energy of the line seems to increase from @xmath42 kev to @xmath62 kev between rev .",
    "1021b and 1022 , and to decrease again to @xmath42 kev from rev .",
    "1024 onward even though the lack of statistics prevents any firm conclusion .      for each event list",
    ", we first convert photon arrival times to the solar system barycenter and apply corrections to account for the binary motion of a0535 . ephemerids for the binary orbit",
    "are taken from @xcite , adopting the updated values from @xcite for the epoch of the periastron passage and the orbital period .",
    "we then carry out a @xmath63 test @xcite around the known pulse frequency of the source on each event list .",
    "for this task , we select only photons in the @xmath64 kev range , where the signal - to - noise ratio is higher . to further increase the signal - to - noise ratio , we use the information from the spectral deconvolution algorithm : for all the available scw",
    ", we estimate the fraction @xmath65 of source photons that reach each detector due to the shadow casted by the coded mask on the detectors , and select only photons from detectors with @xmath65 larger than a given value ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for details ) . in this work ,",
    "we exclude events from detectors with @xmath66 .",
    "the @xmath63 periodogram exhibits a very large peak around the reported spin period of the pulsar in all data - sets , with values of the power ranging from @xmath67 to @xmath68 against an expected average of 4 .",
    "following @xcite , we fit the periodograms around the peak of the @xmath63 distribution with a gaussian model in order to better estimate the spin frequency .",
    "the @xmath46 uncertainties on the best - fit frequencies were inferred by adapting equation b17 of @xcite to the @xmath63 case .    then , we perform phase - connected timing in order to determine the spin evolution of the pulsar during the outburst . the pulse phase at a time _",
    "t _ can be expressed as :    @xmath69    where _ f _ is the spin frequency , the dots represent derivation with respect to the time , and the subscript 0 denotes quantities evaluated at the reference epoch .",
    "we take @xmath70 , the mid - point of rev .",
    "1021a , as the reference epoch @xmath71 .",
    "starting from a simple constant frequency model , @xmath72 , for each data - set , we produce pulse profiles using events in the @xmath73 range , and measure the phase shift as a function of time with respect to the reference epoch .",
    "the phase is measured at the minimum of the pulse profile .",
    "we find a reasonable fit using a polynomial model which includes the derivatives of the frequency up to the fourth order .",
    "the best - fit coefficents of the timing solution are reported in table [ table_timing_solution ] .",
    "we can now infer the evolution of the spin frequency and its first derivative along the outburst ( see respectively upper and lower panels of figure [ fig_timing ] ) .",
    "the increase in the spin frequency induced during the accretion episode is evident . moreover",
    ", the pulsar was already spinning up during the rising part of the outburst ( rev .",
    "1019a to c ) , and it reached a maximum spin - up rate of @xmath74 at mjd=55617.25 , i.e. about five days after the passage at the periastron .",
    "the rate of spin - up correlates with the flux of the source ( figure [ fig_torque ] ) .",
    "this behavior is expected in the case of accretion from a prograde accretion disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , because both the spin frequency derivative rate and the luminosity are proportional to the accretion rate . fitting the @xmath75 relation with a power law model , @xmath76 ,",
    "we obtain @xmath77 , higher than the standard value of 6/7 .",
    "finally , we build pulse profiles for each data - set in four different energy bands , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 kev , respectively , by folding the data according to our estimated timing solution .",
    "the profiles are then normalized to their average value .",
    "we avoid the energy interval between 49 and 70 kev because of the presence of a strong background feature ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which significantly reduces the signal - to - noise ratio of the pulsation .",
    "the resulting pulse profiles are shown in figures [ fig_prof_1 ] to [ fig_prof_4 ] . at high luminosity ,",
    "the pulse profile is made of two sub - pulses .",
    "the width of each sub - pulse is @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the rotational phase in units of the spin period .",
    "the relative strength of the sub - pulses is roughly equal in the lowest energy range , @xmath84 . at higher energies",
    "the second peak becomes fainter than the first one , which dominates the pulse profile above 49 kev . as the luminosity decreases , both sub - pulses weaken .",
    "however , it can be noticed that the change in the first sub - pulse is much more dramatic than in the second one . at energies below 49 kev",
    "the profile shows a broad , single pulse ( @xmath85 ) , while in the @xmath81 kev range the lack of statistics does not allow to determine the presence of pulsations .",
    "we analyzed several _ integral_/spi observations of the transient be / x - ray binary a0535 , performed during a type ii outburst of the source occurred in february 2011 .    based on the data taken during a previous outburst , @xcite suggested that the lack of significant flux - related variations of the cyclotron line energy in a0535 result from a peculiar accretion geometry , or from a peculiar alignment between the pulsar and an observer at the earth . as an alternative",
    ", they suggested that a0535 may be in a different accretion regime with respect to other sources , where the luminosity is close or below the so - called coulomb stopping limit ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) , and in any case below the critical value @xmath86 , estimated for this source at all except the brightest outbursts of the source registered so far .",
    "the results of @xcite for the outburst of february 2011 seem to support this picture . however , the results of our spectral analysis are in striking contrast with those reported above .",
    "we found a significant increase in the energy on the fundamental cyclotron line , which correlates with the flux of the source .",
    "this discrepancy might be due to the different energy range used in the spectral analysis , and/or by the different hypotheses in the modelization of the continuum emission , which might have a considerable effect on the measured energy of the cyclotron lines , see e.g. the discussion of @xcite .    in any case , the observation of a positive correlation between the energy of the fundamental cyclotron line and the flux confirms that a0535 is accreting at sub - critical regimes .",
    "interestingly , the correlation seems to fall off at the end of the outburst .",
    "this behaviour is expected when the accretion flow passes from a coulomb - stopping deceleration regime a gas shock deceleration regime @xcite . in our case",
    ", the transition occurs between rev . 1026 and 1027 , that is between @xmath87 and @xmath88 , in broad agreement with the value of @xmath89 obtained from equation 54 of @xcite , where we assumed for a0535 a magnetic field of @xmath90 .",
    "the spectral analysis also highlighted a softening of the continuum emission as the flux of the source increased .",
    "a similar behavior of the hard ( @xmath91 ) x - ray spectrum was also reported by @xcite from batse observations of the giant outburst of 1994 .",
    "this is apparently in contrast with the hardening of the spectrum with flux reported by @xcite .",
    "however , the hardness ratio estimated by these authors were obtained from different energy bands , which included the soft ( 5 - 20 kev ) x - ray contribution as well .",
    "a global hardening of the spectrum could result from a shift of the emission peak towards higher energies .",
    "this would in turn cause the softening of the spectrum observed above 20 kev .    the spin history of a0535 has been tracked since its discovery ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the pulsar shows a steady spin - down during quiescence , which is overlapped with spin - up episodes during giant outburst . from the timing analysis we obtained a phase - connected timing solution for the evolution of the spin frequency relative to the february 2011 outburst . making use of this timing solution , we inferred the evolution of the spin - up rate , which reached a maximum value of @xmath92 at mjd 55617.25 , in good agreement with the value of @xmath93 found by @xcite using _",
    "fermi_/gbm data of the same outburst .",
    "we showed that the spin - up rate of a0535 during the outburst was correlated with the flux of the source , @xmath94 , and it is clearly different from the theoretical value of @xmath95 expected in the case of disk accretion .",
    "this discrepancy has been recently reported also by @xcite using _ fermi_/gbm and maxi / gsc data of a0535 and other be x - ray binaries , and it could be explained by unaccounted variations of the beaming geometry and/or of the bolometric correction factor throughout the outburst , which may affect the determination of the true luminosity of the source .",
    "our study of the energy - dependent pulse profiles and their evolution along the outburst gave results in line with those found in previous outbursts of the source @xcite .",
    "the pulse profiles of a0535 have been analyzed by @xcite , using the beam pattern decomposition method of @xcite , and their results are consistent with the emission from a hollow cone ( i.e. the accretion column ) above the polar cap(s ) of the neutron star .",
    "the transition from a top - hat , energy independent profile at low luminosity to a highly asymmetric double - peaked and energy - dependent profile at high luminosity might be explained in terms , for instance , of variation of the height and shape of the accretion column .",
    "the broad , top - hat and almost energy - independent profile at low luminosity suggests that the emission region occupies a large part of the neutron star surface ( even accounting for light - bending effects ) and that the physical conditions , and thus the optical depth , do not change much with the rotational phase . on the other hand ,",
    "the asymmetric and energy - dependent profile observed at high luminosity might result from a non - symmetric accretion column , due to either offset dipole or non - dipolar magnetic fields , and thus , to a non - trivial and energy - dependent relation between the physical conditions and geometry of the emission region and the rotational phase .",
    "this relation can be verified by means of phase - resolved spectroscopy , which will be detailed in a forthcoming paper ( sartore et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",

    "<S> a0535 + 26 is a slowly rotating pulsar accreting from the wind of a massive be star , and that exhibits two cyclotron absorption lines in its x - ray spectrum , at about 45 and 100 kev , respectively . unlike similar sources , no significant variations of the energy of its cyclotron lines with flux were observed to date . </S>",
    "<S> the bright outburst of february 2011 thus offers a unique occasion to probe this peculiar behavior at flux levels not yet observed with present - day instruments . here </S>",
    "<S> we report on the spectral and timing analysis of the data from the spectrometer spi on - board _ integral _ collected during the outburst . at the peak of the outburst the estimated luminosity is @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the fundamental cyclotron feature is detected at all flux levels , and its centroid energy is positively - correlated with the flux of the source , confirming that a0535 + 26 is accreting at a sub - critical regime . </S>",
    "<S> the correlation seems to fall off at @xmath1 , suggesting the transition from a coulomb - stopping regime to a gas - mediated shock regime . from the timing analysis we found that the pulsar was spinning up during most of the outburst , and that the spin - up rate correlates with the flux of the source , albeit the correlation is steeper than the one expected from the standard disk accretion theory . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we show that the pulse profile of the source changes dramatically as the flux increases . at high </S>",
    "<S> luminosity the profile is highly asymmetric , implying an asymmetry in the geometry of the accretion flow . </S>"
