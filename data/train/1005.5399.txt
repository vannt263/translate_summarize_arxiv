    "in this article we study the deformations of smooth surfaces @xmath0 of general type whose canonical map is a finite , degree @xmath1 morphism onto a minimal rational surface @xmath6 , embedded in projective space by a very ample complete linear series .",
    "minimal rational surfaces are the projective plane and hirzebruch surfaces @xmath7 with @xmath8 ; then , for completeness sake we will include canonical double covers of all hirzebruch surfaces ( also the non  minimal @xmath2 ) in our study .",
    "our main result is theorem  [ coversofp2andruled ] , in which we show that any deformation of the canonical morphism of most such surfaces @xmath0 is again a morphism of degree @xmath1 .",
    "thus in section  [ non.existence.onminimal.section ] we study how the deformations of the canonical morphism @xmath9 of @xmath0 are .",
    "since @xmath9 is by hypothesis finite and of degree @xmath1 onto its image , any deformation of @xmath9 has to be also a finite morphism and either of degree @xmath1 or of degree @xmath10 . a priori ,",
    "it is not clear which of the two possibilities should happen . on the one hand ,",
    "it is well  known ( see  @xcite ) that if @xmath9 is a double cover of a surface of minimal degree , any deformation of @xmath9 has again degree @xmath1 .",
    "of course , there is a good reason for this to occur , namely , the invariants of a canonical double cover of a surface of minimal degree are below castelnuovo s line @xmath11 ( recall that no surface below castelnuovo s line can have a birational canonical map ) . on the other hand however , if @xmath12 is embedded by an arbitrary very ample complete linear series , there are many surfaces @xmath0 whose invariants lie on or above castelnuovo s line .",
    "thus the existence of deformations of @xmath9 to degree @xmath10 morphisms would be plausible in these cases ( for instance , examples  [ example39 ] and  [ example45 ] show the existence of surfaces of general type with very ample canonical divisors and having the same invariants as certain canonical double covers of minimal rational surfaces ) . moreover , if we consider canonical double covers of non  minimal rational surfaces , there exist cases for which the canonical morphism can be deformed to a morphism of degree @xmath10 ( see  @xcite and  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.14 ) ) . in this article",
    "we completely settle this matter when @xmath6 is @xmath13 or a hirzebruch surface and the branch divisor of the canonical double cover is base  point  free . in theorem",
    "[ coversofp2andruled ] we show that any deformation of @xmath9 is again a degree @xmath1 morphism .",
    "theorem  [ coversofp2andruled ] can be rephrased in terms of the moduli space in the following way : the irreducible component containing @xmath4 $ ] it its moduli space parametrizes surfaces whose canonical map is a finite , degree @xmath1 morphism .",
    "theorem  [ coversofp2andruled ] contrasts therefore with the results of  @xcite and  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.14 ) mentioned above ; instead , theorem  [ coversofp2andruled ] generalizes the behavior of the deformations of canonical covers of surfaces of minimal degree mentioned earlier .",
    "this variety of behaviors shows how different and complicated the moduli spaces of surfaces of general type that are canonical double covers of arbitrarily embedded rational surfaces can be when compared with either the moduli of curves or , for that matter , the moduli of surfaces of general type that are canonical double covers of surfaces of minimal degree .    the key point for the proof of theorem  [ coversofp2andruled ] is the vanishing of hom@xmath14 , which we prove in proposition  [ nonexist.canonical.structures ] .",
    "this vanishing can be interpreted as the non  existence , at an `` infinitesimal '' level , of deformations of @xmath9 to degree @xmath10 morphisms .",
    "thus theorem  [ coversofp2andruled ] shows how infinitesimal properties translate into global statements such as the fact that the moduli component containing @xmath4 $ ] parametrizes surfaces whose canonical map is a degree @xmath1 morphism . on the other hand ,",
    "finite morphisms that can be deformed to morphisms of degree @xmath10 are linked to the existence of certain multiple structures embedded in projective space ( see  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and  @xcite ) . thus , as a by  product of proposition  [ nonexist.canonical.structures ] , in section  [ noropes ] we prove the non  existence of `` canonically '' embedded ( i.e. , such that the dualizing sheaf is the restriction of @xmath15 ) multiple structures on @xmath13 and on hirzebruch surfaces . in particular , this means that there do not exist canonically embedded double structures on smooth surfaces of minimal degree .",
    "this fact is interesting since there do exist double structures of other kinds on a surface of minimal degree ( see  @xcite where the existence of double structures on rational normal scrolls with the invariants of a smooth @xmath16 surface is shown ) .",
    "finite covers of rational surfaces have interesting implications for the geography and the moduli of surfaces of general type ( see e.g.  @xcite or  @xcite ) . in section  [ moduli.section ]",
    "we chart the region in the geography covered by the double covers @xmath0 of theorem  [ coversofp2andruled ] .",
    "this is done in propositions  [ cancover.p2.invariants ] and  [ cancover.ruled.invariants ] and in remark  [ cancover.ruled.geography ] .",
    "the chern quotient @xmath17 of our surfaces approaches @xmath18 ; on the other hand , our region is not contained but goes well inside the region above castelnuovo s line . in the second part of section  [ moduli.section ] we explore the moduli space of @xmath4 $ ] .",
    "first , in proposition  [ moduli.dim ] , we compute the dimension of the irreducible moduli component of @xmath4 $ ] , which is @xmath19 if @xmath12 is @xmath13 embedded by @xmath20 and @xmath21 if @xmath12 is @xmath7 embedded by an arbitrary very ample linear series @xmath22 . finally we go a bit further in studying the complexity of some of these moduli spaces .",
    "we find examples ( see examples  [ example39 ] and  [ example45 ] ) of moduli spaces having two kind of components : components parametrizing surfaces which can be canonically embedded and components parametrizing surfaces whose canonical map is a degree @xmath1 morphism .",
    "in this section we study how the canonical morphism of canonical double covers of @xmath13 and of hirzebruch surfaces deforms .",
