    "the international mobile telecommunications ( imt)-2020 promotion group drafted a white paper of ` the vision and demand of 5 g ' @xcite in 2014 to specify the key performance indicators of the fifth generation ( 5 g ) cellular networks , i.e. , the 1000 times future traffic growth , the 100 times connectivity requirements , and the 5 to 15 times spectrum efficiency enhancement etc .. to this end , new multiple access ( ma ) techniques must be developed because current 4 g ma solutions have not been designed to meet such demands .",
    "as a promising multiple access technique , considerable attention has been drawn to the non - orthogonal multiple access ( noma ) @xcite due to its less processing overhead and superior spectral efficiency .",
    "the 3rd generation partnership project ( 3gpp ) initiated several discussions about the benefits of non - orthogonal downlink transmissions . in these meetings",
    ", noma has been selected as the study item in long - term evolution ( lte ) release 13 , termed multiuser superposition transmission ( must ) @xcite .",
    "noma multiplexes users on the power - domain at the transmitter side where far users are allocated more transmission power while near users are allocated less transmission power . as such",
    ", far users decode their desired signals by treating others information as noise . on the other hand ,",
    "near users adopt the successive interference cancellation ( sic ) to extract their desired signals , i.e. , they first decode the signals of far users and then decode their own after subtracting the decoded signals of far users",
    ".    however , in current noma schemes , it is not specified which coding scheme is used .",
    "moreover , the scenarios where the users have similar channel conditions could diminish the performance gain of noma over orthogonal multiple access ( oma ) , such as tdma , fdma etc .. to address this challenge , usually , the geometrical separation should be fulfilled by the scheduler which only clusters the users with different channel gains for superposition transmissions .",
    "such a scheduler results in an excessively high complexity if the cellular network has a high user density and huge traffic demand .",
    "in addition , in order to achieve geometrical separation , the scheduler could hardly project the beams onto user clusters with maximal spatial orthogonality so that the crosstalk occurs among the neighbouring user clusters , which is another challenge especially for a mimo - noma @xcite system .",
    "motivated by the above challenges of noma , the objective of this paper is to provide a new downlink superposition transmission scheme so that the drawback of noma which arises when users have similar channel conditions can be overcome .",
    "this new superposition transmission scheme is based on multilevel lattice codes , referred to as lattice partition multiple access ( lpma ) .",
    "lpma exploits the structural property of the lattice codes to harness the co - channel interference among users . in the scenario where users have the similar channel conditions , lpma can multiplex users by assigning them different lattice partitions which are isomorphic to the same finite field .",
    "we demonstrate that the proposed lpma shows a clear throughput enhancement over noma and oma schemes .",
    "in this section , we present the basic algebra concepts of a lattice and some discussions about noma and its drawback .",
