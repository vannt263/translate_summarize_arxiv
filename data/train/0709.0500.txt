    "during the last few years applications of gauge / gravity duality @xcite to hadronic physics attracted a lot of attention , and various holographic dual models of qcd were proposed in the literature ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these models were able to incorporate such essential properties of qcd as confinement and chiral symmetry breaking , and also to reproduce many of the static hadronic observables ( decay constants , masses ) , with values rather close to the experimental ones . amongst the dual models ,",
    "a special class is the so - called `` bottom - up '' approaches ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , the goal of which is to reproduce known properties of qcd by choosing an appropriate theory in the 5-dimensional ( 5d ) ads bulk . within the framework of the ads / qcd models , by modifying the theory in the bulk one may try to explain / fit experimental results in different sectors of qcd .    in the present paper",
    ", we will be interested in the hard - wall ads / qcd model @xcite , where the confinement is modeled by sharp cutting off the ads space along the extra fifth dimension at a wall located at some finite distance @xmath0 . in the framework of this hard - wall model ,",
    "it is possible to find form factors and wave functions of vector mesons ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . to reproduce the general features of the spectrum for the higher states ( `` linear confinement '' ) ,",
    "a soft - wall model was proposed in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1-meson form factors for this model were calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in general ,",
    "the vector sector is less sensitive to the infrared ( ir ) effects , since this symmetry is not broken in qcd .",
    "however , the axial - vector sector appears to be very sensitive to the particular way the chiral symmetry is broken or , in other words , to the bulk content and the shape of the ir wall @xcite .    in this respect ,",
    "one of the interesting objects to study in the holographic dual models of qcd is the pion .",
    "the properties of the pion were studied in various holographic approaches , ( see e.g. refs .",
    "in particular , the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also recent papers @xcite ) managed to reproduce the ( gell - mann  oakes  renner ) relation @xmath2 between the quark mass @xmath3 and mass of the pion @xmath4 and also the @xmath5 coupling ( the coupling between @xmath1 meson and two pions ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the solution of the pion wave - function equation was explicitly written for the @xmath6 limit .    in this paper , working in the framework of the model proposed in @xcite ( hard - wall model ) , we describe a formalism to calculate the form factor and wave functions ( and also the density function ) of the pion . since the fits of ref .",
    "@xcite give a very small @xmath7mev value for the explicit chiral symmetry breaking parameter @xmath8 , we consider only the chiral limit @xmath6 of the hard - wall holographic dual model of two - flavor qcd .",
    "resorting to the chiral limit allows us to utilize one of the main advantages of ads / qcd - the possibility to work with explicit analytic solutions of the basic equations of motion . expressing the pion form factor in terms of these solutions ,",
    "we are able , in particular , to extract and analyze the behavior of the pion electric radius in various regions of the holographic parameters space . on the numerical side",
    ", we come to the conclusion that the radius of the pion is smaller than what is known from experiment . however , we suggest that , as in case of the radius of the @xmath1 meson , smoothing the ir wall may increase the pion radius .    in our analysis",
    ", we introduce and systematically use two types of holographic wave functions @xmath9 and @xmath10 , which are conjugate to each other and basically similar to the analogous objects introduced in our papers @xcite , where we studied vector mesons .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way .",
    "we start with recalling , in section ii , the basics of the hard - wall model and some results obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , in particular , the form of the relevant action , the eigenvalue equations for bound states and their solutions . in section iii , we describe a formalism for calculating the pion form factor and express it in terms of the two wave functions mentioned above . in section iv",
    ", we discuss the relation of our ads / qcd results to experimental data .",
    "we express the values of the pion decay constant and the pion charge radius in terms of the fundamental parameters of the theory and study their behavior in different regions of the parametric space . at the end",
    ", we study the behavior of the pion form factor at large momentum transfer .",
    "finally , we summarize the paper .",
    "in the holographic model of hadrons , qcd resonances correspond to kaluza - klein ( kk ) excitations in the sliced ads@xmath11 background .",
    "in particular , vector mesons correspond to the kk modes of transverse vector gauge field in this background .",
    "since the gauge symmetry in the vector sector of the h - model is not broken , the longitudinal component of the vector gauge field is unphysical , and only transverse components correspond to physical mesons .",
    "similarly , the axial - vector mesons are the modes of the transverse part of the axial - vector gauge field . however , because the axial - vector gauge symmetry is broken in the 5d background , the longitudinal components have physical meaning and are related to the pion field .",
    "this should be taken into account if we want to treat the pion in a consistent way .",
    "the standard prescription of the holographic model is that there is a correspondence between the 4d vector and axial - vector currents and the corresponding 5d gauge fields : @xmath12 where @xmath13 , ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 are usual pauli matrices ) .    in general",
    ", one can write @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are transverse and longitudinal components of the axial - vector field . the spontaneous symmetry breaking causes @xmath19 to be physical and associated with the goldstone boson , pion in this case .",

    "thus , the two - point function for the axial - vector currents has the form : @xmath62 where the meson polarization tensor is given by @xmath63 the representation for the two - point function can be also written as @xmath64 in which the second term on the rhs is explicitly transverse to @xmath65 .    as noted in ref .",

    ".  @xcite , we emphasized that it makes sense to consider also the conjugate functions @xmath85 of the corresponding sturm - liouville equation .",
    "as we observed , they are closer in their structure to the usual quantum mechanical bound state wave functions than the solutions of the original equation . in the pion case , it is convenient to define the @xmath86 function as @xmath87 it vanishes at the ir boundary @xmath88 and , according to eq .",

    "hence , the pion form factor can be extracted from the three - point function using @xmath105      to obtain form factor from the holographic model , we need the action of the third order in the fields .",

    "the logarithmic term taken for @xmath289 is approximately equal to @xmath284 , thus almost doubling the outcome value for @xmath282 .",
    "more precisely , we can write @xmath290     \\   .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath237 , the modified logarithmic term gives a very small contribution , and our net result is very close to the value given by the njl fixed term .",
    "numerically , though , this prediction of the hard - wall ads / qcd model , as we have seen , is essentially smaller than the experimental value .      in the large-@xmath245 limit",
    ", the source @xmath291 is given by its free - field version @xmath292 that behaves asymptotically like @xmath293 . as a result , only small values @xmath294 are important in the form factor integral , and the large-@xmath245 asymptotic behavior of the form factor is determined by the value of @xmath295 at the origin @xcite , namely , @xmath296 note that the combination @xmath297 frequently appears in the pion studies .",
    "in particular , it is the basic scale of the pion wave function in the local quark - hadron duality model @xcite , where it corresponds to the `` pion duality interval '' .",
    "the leading contribution comes entirely from the @xmath298 term of the form factor integral ( [ ff2 ] ) while the @xmath299 term contribution behaves asymptotically like @xmath300 since it is accompanied by extra @xmath301 factor .",
    "note , however , that it is quite visible in the experimentally interesting region @xmath302 : it is responsible for more than @xmath303 of the form factor value in this region ( moreover , at @xmath183 , the @xmath299 term contributes about 40% into the normalization of the form factor ) .    from a phenomenological point of view , different ads / qcd - like models for the pion form factor differ in the shape of the density @xmath304 that they produce .",
    "if we require that the density @xmath305 equals @xmath306 at the origin , the asymptotic behavior is @xmath307 in any such model . for @xmath183 ,",
    "the form factor is normalized to one , so basically the models would differ in how they interpolate between these two limits . in particular , the simplest interpolation is provided by the monopole formula @xmath308 while our hard - wall calculation gives a curve that goes above @xmath309 : the ratio @xmath310 is larger than 1 for all @xmath311 , slowly approaching unity as @xmath312 ( see fig.[ffact ] ) .",
    "in fact , a purely monopole form factor was obtained in our paper @xcite , where we studied the @xmath1-meson form factors in the soft - wall holographic model , in which confinement is generated by @xmath313 oscillator - type potential .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the form factor integral @xmath314 is the lowest bound state wave function , and @xmath315\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is the bulk - to - boundary propagator of this oscillator - type model , is exactly equal to the magnitude of the oscillator scale @xmath316 was fixed in our paper @xcite by the value of the @xmath1-meson mass : @xmath317 . as a result , the form factor @xmath318 had the @xmath1-dominance behavior @xmath319 .",
    "if we take @xmath320 both for @xmath321 and @xmath322 , the integral ( [ calf00 ] ) gives @xmath323 .",
    "the relevant wave function @xmath324 has the expected correct normalization however , the slope @xmath325 of @xmath323 at @xmath183 ( corresponding to for the radius squared ) is smaller than that of the experimental pion form factor .",
    "furthermore , @xmath326 tends to @xmath327gev@xmath328 for large @xmath245 , achieving values about @xmath329gev@xmath328 for @xmath330gev@xmath328 , and thus exceeding by more than 25% the experimental jlab values @xcite measured for @xmath331 and 2.45gev@xmath328 .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite proposed to use eqs .",
    "( [ calf00]),([caljo ] ) as an ads / qcd model for the pion form factor , with @xmath332mev chosen so as to fit these high-@xmath245 data .",
    "however , such a choice underestimates the value of @xmath333 by almost 30% .",
    "our opinion is that the ads / qcd models should describe first the low - energy properties of hadrons , and the basic low - energy characteristics , such as @xmath334 and @xmath193 , should be used to fix the model parameters . on the other hand ,",
    "if the form factor calculations based on these parameters disagree with the large-@xmath245 data , it is quite possible that this is just an indication that one is using the model beyond its applicability limits .",
    "furthermore , as we have seen in the hard - wall model , to correctly describe the pion one needs to include the chiral symmetry breaking effects absent in the vector channel . as a result ,",
    "equations for pion wave functions are rather different from those in the @xmath1-meson case .",
    "similarly , there are no reasons to expect that , in a soft - wall model , the pion density should have the same shape as the @xmath1-meson one .",
    "unfortunately , the procedure of bringing in the chiral symmetry breaking effects that was used in the hard - wall model of ref .",
    "@xcite faces serious difficulties when applied to the ads / qcd model @xcite with the @xmath301 soft wall . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the solution of the equation for the @xmath335 field in this model requires that chiral condensate @xmath28 and the mass parameter @xmath8 are proportional to each other , so that @xmath336 can not be varied independently of @xmath8 .",
    "moreover , if one takes the chiral limit @xmath6 , the chiral condensate should also vanish .",
    "this difficulty may be avoided by switching to more sophisticated recent models ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) in which the chiral condensate is generated dynamically .",
    "however , such a consideration goes well beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "thus , we just resort to an idea that whatever the mechanism is involved , the net practical outcome is a particular shape of the density @xmath337 that eventually determines the pion form factor and other pion characteristics .",
    "below , we give an example of a density @xmath338 that is normalized at the origin by the experimental value of @xmath193 , i.e. , @xmath339 , but which is also capable to reproduce the experimental value of the pion charge radius .    evidently , to increase the radius , we should take a density which is larger for large @xmath32 than @xmath340 .",
    "since the overall integral normalization of the density is kept fixed , this can be achieved only by decreasing the density for small @xmath32 values .    consider a simple ansatz ( see fig.[rhomod ] ) @xmath341   \\    , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath342 .",
    "it has both the desired value for @xmath343 and satisfies the normalization condition @xmath344 integrating it with @xmath345 taken at @xmath346 produces the model form factor given by the following sum of contributions of the three lowest vector states : @xmath347 the slope of @xmath348 at @xmath183 is given by @xmath349 \\",
    ".\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] taking @xmath350 , one obtains the experimental value 0.45 @xmath269 for @xmath351 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the model density providing this value , has an enhancement for larger values of @xmath32 ( see fig.[rhomod ] ) , just like the pion densities in the hard - wall model ( see fig.([rhodense ] ) ) . due to a larger slope",
    ", @xmath348 decreases faster than the simple monopole interpolation @xmath352 and , as a result , is in better agreement with the data .",
    "in fact , it goes very close to @xmath353gev@xmath328 data , but exceeds the values of the jlab @xmath3541.6 and 2.45gev@xmath328 points by roughly 10% and 20% , respectively .",
    "this discrepancy has a general reason .",
    "the asymptotic ads / qcd prediction is which is @xmath355gev@xmath328 for experimental value of @xmath193 . on the other hand ,",
    "jlab experimental points correspond to @xmath356gev@xmath328 , which is much smaller than the theoretical value quoted above .",
    "the pre - asymptotic effects , as we have seen , reduce the discrepancy , but there still remains a sizable gap . as we already stated , such a disagreement may be just a signal that we are reaching a region where ads / qcd models should not be expected to work . in particular , ads / qcd models of refs .",
    "@xcite describe the pion in terms of an effective field or current , without specifying whether the current is built from spin-1/2 fields , or from scalar fields , etc . for @xmath245 above 1gev@xmath328 , the quark substructure of the pion may be resolved by the electromagnetic probe ( which is a wide - spread belief ) , and the description of the pion `` as a whole '' may be insufficient .",
    "in this paper , we studied the pion in the chiral limit of two flavor qcd .",
    "to this end , we described a formalism that allows to extract pion form factor within the framework of the holographic dual model of qcd with hard - wall cutoff .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we identified the pion with the longitudinal component of the axial - vector gauge field .",
    "we defined two ( sturm - liouville ) conjugate wave functions @xmath9 and @xmath10 that describe the structure of the pion along the 5@xmath357 dimension coordinate @xmath358 .",
    "these wave functions provide a very convenient framework to study the holographic physics of the pion .",
    "we demonstrated that , just like in the @xmath1-meson case @xcite , the pion form factor is given by an integral involving the function @xmath337 that has the meaning of the charge density inside the pion .",
    "however , in distinction to the @xmath1-case , when the density was simply given by @xmath359 , the pion density has an additional term proportional to @xmath360 and entering with the @xmath32-dependent coefficient reflecting the mechanism of the spontaneous symmetry breaking . both terms are required for normalization of the form factor at @xmath361 .",
    "we found an analytic expression for the pion decay constant in terms of two parameters of the model : @xmath362 and @xmath363 , similar to those used in ref .",
    "@xcite . analyzing the results , we found it convenient to work with two combinations @xmath364 and @xmath365 of the basic parameters .",
    "in particular , we found @xmath265 for the value of @xmath219 corresponding to the experimental @xmath1-meson mass @xmath334 and pion decay constant @xmath193 .",
    "the importance of the parameter @xmath219 is that its magnitude determines the regions , where the pion properties are either governed by the confinement effects or by the effects from the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "for example , in the practically important domain @xmath366 , the pion decay constant is determined primarily by @xmath362 , with negligibly tiny corrections due to @xmath195 value . however , when @xmath367 the pion decay constant is proportional to the ratio @xmath368 . besides",
    ", for small @xmath369 , the radius of the pion is given by @xmath370 , i.e. , as one may expect , the pion size is completely determined by the confinement radius . on the other hand , for @xmath366 the radius",
    "is basically determined by @xmath371 , slowly increasing with @xmath195 due to the @xmath372 correction .",
    "we also found that the pion rms charge radius @xmath373fm in the hard - wall model is smaller than that measured experimentally . in a sense ,",
    "the hard wall at the distance @xmath374fm ( fixed from the @xmath1-meson mass ) , `` does not allow '' the pion to get larger .",
    "so , we argued that if the ir wall is `` softened '' , the size of the pion may be increased by an amount sufficient to accomodate the data .",
    "a straightforward idea is to use the soft - wall model of ref .",
    "@xcite and treat the pion in a way similar to what was done in @xcite for the @xmath1-meson case .",
    "unfortunately , there are prohibiting complications with directly introducing the chiral symmetry effects within the ads / qcd model with the @xmath301 soft wall . as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , the chiral condensate @xmath28 in such a model is proportional to the mass parameter @xmath8 , so that in the chiral limit the condensate vanishes together with the quark mass .    to illustrate a possible change in the form factor predictions due to the softening of the ir wall",
    ", we proposed an ansatz for the pion density function and used the vector current source from the soft - wall model considered in ref .",
    "@xcite . we demonstrated that this ansatz is capable to fit the experimental value of the pion charge radius .",
    "it also closely follows the data in the @xmath375gev@xmath328 region , while still overshoots available data in the @xmath376gev@xmath328 region .",
    "the basic source of this discrepancy is very general : the asymptotic ads / qcd prediction for the pion form factor is @xmath377 , and if one takes the experimental value for @xmath193 , one obtains @xmath378gev@xmath328 , which is much larger than the 0.4gev@xmath328 value given by @xmath376gev@xmath328 jlab data . for this reason , we argued that the disagreement mentioned above may be a signal that the region @xmath379gev@xmath328 is beyond the applicability region of ads / qcd models .",
    "finishing the write - up of this paper , we have learned that the paper @xcite addressing the same problem was posted into the arxive .",
    "we did not observe , however , essential overlaps with our ideas and results .",
