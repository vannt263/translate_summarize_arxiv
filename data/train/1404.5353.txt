    "a dipolariton is a three - way superposition of a microcavity photon , direct exciton ( dx ) , and an indirect exciton ( ix ) .",
    "the dx is a bound electron - hole pair in the same quantum well , and an ix is a bound electron - hole pair between the quantum wells .",

    "the dipole moment is expected to enhance the dipolariton - dipolariton interactions , but in a tunable way by varying the relative proportions of the photon , dx , and ix .",
    "this is interesting from a quantum optoelectronic standpoint with potential applications to coherent transfer between photons to electrons @xcite .",
    "although condensation of dipolaritons has not been observed to date , the light effective mass of the dipolaritons suggest that the prospect of this is rather promising . despite the experimental interest",

    "several works have in the past have calculated the effective exciton - exciton interaction @xcite , from which the polariton - polariton interaction can be obtained simply by multiplying by the exciton fraction .",
    "the exciton - exciton interaction originate from the coulomb interaction of the underlying electron and holes making up the excitons .",
    "the interaction is typically described as the sum of two contributions  the `` direct '' and `` exchange '' contributions @xcite .",
    "the direct contribution corresponds to exciton - exciton scattering process @xmath0 , where @xmath1 denotes an exciton containing an electron @xmath2 and a hole @xmath3 .",

    "in addition to this , the barrier between the two quantum wells is made sufficiently thin such that tunneling may occur between them .",

    "the tunneling of the hole is negligible because of its larger effective mass and energy separation of hole levels in a coupled double quantum well @xcite .",

    "@xcite , the tunneling amplitude may be tunable to the same order of the rabi splitting , thus a coherent superposition of the photon , direct exciton , and indirect exciton is a good approximation .    denoting the bosonic annihilation operators of the photon , dx , and ix as @xmath10 respectively",

    "for @xmath41 the two quasiparticles are @xmath42 with energies @xmath43 . now reinstating the photon coupling",
    ", we may think of the dipolariton as being a further admixture of the photon and the hybrid ix - dx particle .",
    "for the case shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : disp ] , the lp dispersion is pushed down due to the anticrossing of the photon dispersion with respect to the @xmath44 particle at energy @xmath45 .",
    "this creates a typical lp dispersion similar to exciton - polaritons , but offset in energy by @xmath46 .",
    "thus , as far as the lp dispersion is concerned , the dipolariton dispersion shows the same essential features as standard exciton - polaritons .    for sufficiently low temperatures @xmath47 we may expect that only the lp branch is populated , and we may ignore the mp and up branches completely . dropping the `` lp '' labels in ( [ transmatrix ] ) ,",
    "we may write an effective hamiltonian only for the lower polaritons @xmath48 where the effective lp interaction is @xmath49 we see that the effective lp interaction consists of four parts , the mutual dx scattering , mutual ix scattering , ix - dx scattering , and the saturation interaction .",
    "these terms are derived explicitly in the following section .",
    "in this section we present the effective polariton interaction that consists from four terms : direct exciton - direct exciton ( dx - dx ) , indirect exciton - indirect exciton ( ix - ix ) , indirect exciton - direct exciton ( ix - dx ) interactions and the saturation interaction .",
