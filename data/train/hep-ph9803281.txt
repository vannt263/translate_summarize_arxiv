    "<S> recently , the emission rate of such particles from stars has been calculated more accurately by including the many - body effects  @xcite , the effect of strong magnetic fields  @xcite , and the thermal pions and kaons  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the many - body effects in the dense core of stars are found to suppress the axion or neutrino emission rate by a factor of about 2 , while the thermal pions and kaons to increase the axion emission rate by a factor of 3 - 4 within a perturbative treatment . under a strong magnetic field </S>",

    "<S> it puts a bound @xmath3 on the axion electron coupling constant . similarly from magnetic white dwarf ( wd ) stars @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the internal temperature of the white dwarf .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we calculate the corrections to the emission rate of axions by nucleons in a strongly magnetized neutron or wd star whose magnetic field is stronger than the critical field , @xmath6 , such that the landau gap is larger than the rest mass energy or @xmath7 . as we will see later , for @xmath8 ( or @xmath9 ) the axion emission is enhanced quite a lot and gives a stringent bound on the axion - nucleon coupling . </S>",

    "<S> let us first consider how the axion decay constant is renormalized in qed under a strong magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation will go in parallel in qcd also . under a constant magnetic field oriented along the @xmath14 axis @xmath15 , the spectrum of charged particles of charge @xmath16 and mass @xmath17 </S>",

    "<S> their interaction can be described by an effective action derived by integrating out the modes at the higher landau levels ( @xmath26 )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the effective action contains a ( marginal ) four - fermion interaction , which leads to chiral symmetry breaking even at weak attraction  @xcite . using this effective action </S>",
    "<S> , we calculate the axion decay amplitude to two photons . </S>",
    "<S> the wilsonian effective action of qed is given as  @xcite @xmath27+\\cdots , \\label{effective1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the coefficients @xmath28 , and @xmath29 are of order @xmath30 while @xmath31 is of order @xmath32 , determined by the one - loop matching conditions , and the ellipses are the higher order operators in momentum expansion . </S>",
    "<S> the components @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) are perpendicular ( parallel ) to the magnetic field and @xmath35 now , we consider the axion coupling to electrons : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the axion field and @xmath38 is the axion decay constant . </S>",
    "<S> we integrate out all the modes ( @xmath39 ) except the lll electron ( @xmath40 ) to get the low energy effective interaction for @xmath37 and @xmath40 , which is given as @xmath41 where the ellipses denote the effective interaction terms containing the higher powers of axions and momenta , generated by the exchange interaction of @xmath39 .    in the leading order </S>",
    "<S> , there are three diagrams that contribute to the axion decay amplitude ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the first two diagrams vanish but the third diagram gives @xmath42 \\\\ & = & -{e^2\\over 4\\pi^2f_{pq}}\\delta^4(k - p ) \\epsilon^{\\mu\\nu\\alpha\\beta}p_{1\\mu}\\varepsilon_{\\nu}(p_1 ) p_{2\\alpha}\\varepsilon_{\\beta}(p_2),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 and @xmath44 the photon wave function , and the lll electron propagator @xmath45 with @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> the effective lagrangian for the axion decay amplitude is then @xmath47 we find that the axion decay constant is not renormalized in the leading order under an external magnetic field , @xmath48 , in contrast with the pion decay constant that increases under an external magnetic field  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , as is shown in the appendix a , the non - renormalization of the axion decay constant under external magnetic fields is exact simply because the axion couples to @xmath49 not to magnetic fields @xmath2 alone .    </S>",
    "<S> similarly , we calculate the decay amplitude of the axion into one photon ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) , using the effective lagrangians eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ effective1 ] ) and ( [ effective2 ] ) , to get @xmath50 \\\\ & = & { e^2\\over4\\pi^2f_{pq}}(2\\pi)^4\\delta^4(k - p)\\epsilon^{12\\alpha\\beta } \\varepsilon_{\\alpha}(p)k_{\\beta}b.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this result agrees with the direct calculation done with the effective lagrangian eq.([axion ] ) , where one of two photons is replaced by the external photon , assuring that @xmath38 is not renormalized . </S>",
    "<S> we see that the external magnetic field does not change the axion - photon interaction . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the energy - loss processes involving only axions and photons such as the axion - photon conversion or the primakoff process do not get affected by the dimensional reduction .    </S>",
    "<S> now we consider the process that electrons or quarks emit axions . </S>",
    "<S> for an extremely strong magnetic field @xmath6 , all the charged particles are in the lowest landau level and thus the bremsstrahlung emission is more relevant than the cyclotron emission , unless the interior temperature of stars is comparable to the landau gap . </S>",

    "<S> ( note that here we assume @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> but , if @xmath53 , the contribution goes to zero . ) in qed , @xmath54 and therefore quite small  @xcite , but in qcd , for a strong magnetic field @xmath55 ( or @xmath56 ) such that the effective action for qcd is valid , @xmath57 and is no longer negligible ( see the appendix b for details ) . especially , for quarks under a strong external magnetic field @xmath58 , @xmath59 will be quite large . </S>",
    "<S> thus the four - quark interaction will be stronger than the one - gluon exchange interaction and will break the chiral symmetry of qcd at energy above @xmath60 .    </S>",
    "<S> the axion emission process of neutron stars was first calculated by iwamoto and it is found that axion bremsstrahlung from nucleon - nucleon collision is the dominant energy - loss process in neutron stars  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since the emission rate is proportional to the square of the axion - nucleon coupling @xmath61 , any correction to this coupling will affect the emission rate . </S>",
    "<S> what we calculated above can be thought of as a finite correction to the axial singlet current of quarks and equally valid to the axial octet quark currents . </S>",
    "<S> namely , both @xmath62 and @xmath63 have the same correction @xmath64 . as was discussed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the derivative couplings of the axion to the axial vector baryon current is @xmath65 + d{\\rm tr}\\bar b\\gamma^{\\mu}\\gamma_5\\left\\{t^a , b\\right\\ } \\right ) + { s\\over3}{\\rm tr}q_a{\\rm tr}\\bar b\\gamma^{\\mu}\\gamma_5 b \\right\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the baryon octet matrices and @xmath66 the axion charge . </S>",
    "<S> according to the current algebra , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 are defined to be proportional to the nucleon matrix elements of the axial quark currents  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore we see that the axion - nucleon coupling gets a correction @xmath70    besides the correction due to the four - fermion interaction , the emission rate gets corrections since the axion - nucleon coupling and the nucleon mass will change due to the strong magnetic field . as a good approximation , we can take the nucleon mass as @xmath71 in chiral perturbation theory , the quark condensate is given as  @xcite @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the vacuum energy density . </S>",
    "<S> the one - loop vacuum energy under a magnetic field was calculated by schwinger  @xcite as @xmath74.\\ ] ] therefore , the condensate under an external magnetic field is , using the gell - mann - oakes - renner relation @xmath75 , @xmath76 where the ellipses denote the higher loop corrections  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since the axion - nucleon coupling is proportional to the nucleon mass ( @xmath77 ) and the axion decay constant does not change under magnetic fields , @xmath78 the energy - loss rate per unit volume due to the nucleon - nucleon axion bremsstrahlung is calculated in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and can be written as @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the pion - nucleon coupling and @xmath5 is the temperature . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we find the correction due to the strong magnetic field is @xmath81 where we have used the goldberg - treiman relation @xmath82 together with the gell - mann - oakes - renner relation . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , the lowest - order energy emission rate per unit volume by the pion - axion conversion @xmath83  @xcite has corrections due to the strong magnetic field as @xmath84 note that the above derivation of the change in the quark condensate relies on the chiral perturbation theory and the one loop vacuum energy calculation , which will not be valid presumably for an extremely strong magnetic field such that the landau gap becomes bigger than the @xmath85 meson mass @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> but , the condensate will still increase as @xmath2 even for such a strong magnetic field because the increment of vacuum energy due to the external field will be balanced by forming larger condensates .    </S>",
    "<S> the correction to the emission rate due to the external magnetic field comes from two sources . </S>",
    "<S> first one is from the finite correction to the axial current due to the effective four - quark operator and the second one is by the change of the quark condensate under the external field . for @xmath87 , the correction by the second one is less than a few percent while the correction by the first one is of order one . for @xmath88 or </S>",
    "<S> @xmath89 , the correction by the second is about 24% for the bremsstrahlung and about @xmath90 for the pion - axion conversion , while the correction due to the first one is about @xmath91 for both processes , because the four - quark operator will evolve sufficiently . for @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> the perturbative calculation breaks down and we expect that the correction will be extremely large because the strong enhancement of @xmath92 at low energy </S>",
    "<S> . therefore , if @xmath1 in stars , they will emit axions too quickly and will not survive present . on the other hand , if we observe such a strongly magnetized star , the axion - nucleon coupling has to be smaller than the current upper bound by several orders of magnitude .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that the axion decay constant does not get a correction by the external magnetic field and we have calculated the correction to the axion - nucleon coupling due to external magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> we find that if @xmath1 in strongly magnetized neutron and white dwarf stars , the axion emission rate is enhanced by several orders of magnitude .    </S>",
