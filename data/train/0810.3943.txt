    "the braid star exhibited a v - shaped structure centered on the star ( typical of scattering in outflow cavity walls ) and a long curving comma - like tail ( see fig .",
    "[ ids1 ] ) .",

    "the braid star only brightened to a detectable level in the nir after the 2mass survey data had been acquired and hence does not have a 2mass designation nor 2mass photometry .",
    "post-2mass , it was so bright as to be saturated in our wfcam images ( having a saturation limit of m@xmath3011.5 ) .",
    "the only k - band photometry of the source post - outburst is that given in movsessian et al .",

    "[ ccdiag ] , however , its clearly shows that the braid star possesses a large k - band thermal excess .",
    "a 1.3 to 4.0  @xmath0 m spectrum of the braid star was published in movsessian et al .",

    "there was no evidence for strong photospheric , , and absorption features leading movsessian et al . to conclude that the braid star appeared like an fuor in the nir .",

    "[ ids1 ] ) .",
    "it is not detected in the mir ( by msx ) nor in the fir ( by iras , except at 25  @xmath0 m ) suggesting the dust content of the circumstellar region is relatively small , however , it is highly extinguished in the optical implying it is perhaps viewed through a large optical depth of cold obscuring material .",
    "in addition , it does not appear to drive an active molecular co outflow nor possesses a significant molecular gas reservoir in its immediate vicinity ( see the co and hcn maps in schieven et al .",
    "the braid star should probably be classed as an embedded yso with an age , @xmath33 , around a few @xmath510@xmath34  years , although it is somewhat troublesome to reconcile its optical obscured nature and large k - band thermal excess , with no mir nor fir emission and no molecular gas detection .",
    "one interpretation is that perhaps the source has evolved enough to have exhausted its circumstellar dust / gas envelope and much of its cooler circumstellar disk except for the hotter inner regions ( where the k - band thermal excess originates ) .",
    "however , the question arises as to how the disk material has been removed while the star is still seemingly in a young evolutionary state .",
    "no br@xmath12 emission is observed in the nir which may be explained by the disk dominating the nir spectrum and it is the disks cool , low - surface gravity atmosphere that is responsible for the deep co overtone absorption .",

    "the nir h and k spectrum of cn  1 ( fig.[sp-1 ] ) shows broad water vapor absorption most noticeably from 1.7 to 2.2  @xmath0 m .",
    "it also possesses weak br(10 - 4 ) emission at 1.737  @xmath0 m and br@xmath12 emission .",
    "the h emission confirms this object as a young actively accreting star while the water vapor absorption suggests the presence of a cool atmosphere .",

    "the weak br@xmath12 emission suggests that it is actively , but not strongly , accreting . if hh ejection is tied to accretion rate ( in say , an outburst event ) , the presence of a compact and collimated hh jet would suggest that it has undergone a period of more significant accretion in the recent past . assuming a typical hh jet velocity of @xmath9200  km  s@xmath7 and an inclination with respect to the plane of the sky of 45@xmath36 , the jet would have been initiated around 300 years ago .",
