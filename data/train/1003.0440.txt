    "back in @xmath2 , more than one century ago , the first peculiar stars were found in the course of the henry draper memorial classification work at harvard by antonia maury and annie cannon .",
    "maury used the designation `` peculiar '' for the first time to describe spectral features in the remarks to the spectrum of @xmath3  cvn @xcite , making a first attempt for two - dimensional classification system considering the strength and the width of the spectral lines .    in @xmath4 preston proposed the division of main - sequence cp stars into four groups according to their spectroscopic characteristics @xcite : cp1 ( am / fm stars ) , cp2 ( si , srcreu stars ) , cp3 ( hgmn stars ) , cp4 ( he - weak stars ) .",
    "more detailed spectroscopic consideretion of cp stars required to introduce new subtypes of cp stars , such as he - rich and @xmath5  boo stars .",
    "cp2 stars , including bp / ap , host strong surface magnetic fields @xcite that are likely stable on large time - intervals @xcite .",
    "abundance peculiarities were measured using the curve - of - growth method based on simple assumptions about formation of absorption lines ( models of schuster - schwarzschild , unsld , milne - eddington ) . since that time and with development of new high - resolution , high signal - to - noise ccd based spectrometers , big progress has been made in abundance analysis of cp stars , revealing the presence of vertical @xcite and horizontal @xcite elements separation in their atmospheres caused by the processes of microscopic particle diffusion @xcite .",
    "the discovery of strong stellar surface magnetic fields @xcite opened a new research field in astrophysics    stellar magnetism .",
    "a @xmath6  gauss accuracy of the magnetic field detection usually obtained with photographic plates has increased to @xmath7  gauss with modern spectropolarimetry and new techniques ( such as least square deconvolution , or lsd , for example ) @xcite .    with the discovery by d.  kurtz @xcite of a @xmath8  min pulsation period in hd101065 a subgroup of the cool cp stars ,",
    "the so - called rapidly oscillating ap ( roap ) stars , became extremely promising targets for asteroseismology , a most powerful tool for testing theories of stellar structure .",
    "driving of the oscillations results from a subtle energy balance depending directly on the interaction between the magnetic field , convection , pulsations , and atomic diffusion .",
    "amazing insights in the 3-d structure of stellar atmospheres became available ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "current ground - based observations of cp stars reveal many interesting findings that require new modelling approaches and interpretations .",
    "accurate high - resolution observations are needed to understand the properties and origin of so - called hyper - velocity stars ( hvs ) .",
    "these are b - type stars with peculiar galactic rest frame velocity and enhanced @xmath9  elements and normal ( solar ) fe abundances in their atmospheres .",
    "the origin of these stars is not well understood : one of the hypothesis tells that they originate from the dynamical interaction of binary stars with the supermassive black hole in the galactic centre ( gc ) , which accelerates one component of the binary to beyond the galactic escape velocity .",
    "so far , however , no hvs has been unambiguously related to a gc origin .",
    "determination of the place of ejection of a hvs requires the determination of space motion ( accurate proper motions ) and chemical composition , however , the later one is hard to use to constrain their origin ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if gc origin can be proved by such future astrometric missions like gaia ( see below in this contribution ) then it can bring important constraints on magnetic fields in gc region and on the formation and evolution of cp stars in general .",
    "important issue concerns a rotational braking observed recently for magnetic bp star hd  37776 .",
    "it was shown that this star increased its rotational period by @xmath10s over the past @xmath11 years @xcite .",
    "this can not be explained by light - time effect caused , for example , by the presence of a secondary companion which is not observed in radial velocity measurements . also , the hypothesis of free - body precession due to magnetic distortion is incompatible with light curve shapes unchanged in @xmath11 years .",
    "the plausible scenario left is a continuous momentum loss due to magnetic braking that requires magnetically confined stellar wind , which naturally can be present in hd  37776 .",
    "interferometry is becoming a very powerful tool in modern astrophysics since it allows for direct and model independent measurement of sizes of stellar objects .",
    "recently , there was a report of the first detailed interferometric study of a roap star @xmath9  cir @xcite .",
    "authors used observations of sydney university stellar interferometer ( susi ) and additional data from visual and uv observations calibrated to absolute units to accurately derive @xmath12 and @xmath13 of the star . even thought the interferometry can provide us with accurate radii of stars , the accuracy of @xmath12 determination is still limited by the incompleteness of observations in all spectral range ( that would give a value of the bolometric flux ) and model atmospheres used ( see * ? ? ?",
    "implementation of interferometric techniques to another ap star @xmath14  crb is reported in this conference ( jd04-p:29 ) .",
    "interesting results were obtained for well known ap star @xmath15  uma which appeared to host a brown dwarf companion .",
    "this star shows substantial variations of radial velocities measured from different spectral lines @xcite which allowed to derive the parameters of the system and to infer the mass of the secondary component of @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "there have been an extensive discussions over past years about the lii  @xmath17   line which is usually used for the determination of li abundance in magnetic ap stars . however , due to unknown and yet unconfirmed blending with possible lines of rare - earth elements ( ree ) it was not definitely clear if the abundance determination suffer from systematic uncertainties or not .",
    "recently @xcite confirmed li identification in magnetic ap stars using detailed calculations of zeeman pattern in baschen - back regime .",
    "no correlation between li and ree line strengths was found thus ruling out the suspicion that the observed feature is due to an unidentified ree line .",
    "however the origin of li still has to be explained theoretically by diffusion calculations and/or abundance spots on stellar surface .",
    "high - resolution , high signal - to - noise observations allow to study not only elements stratification in atmospheres of cp stars with very detail , but also the separation of different isotopes of a given element as demonstrated by @xcite who studied @xmath18ca/@xmath19ca isotopic anomaly in atmosphere of selected ap stars .",
    "this was also investigated in @xcite who analysed calcium isotopes stratification profiles in three stars @xmath20  aql , hr  1217 and hd  122970 concluding that the heavy isotope concentrated towards the higher layers .",
    "interestingly , they found no correlation in @xmath19ca excess in atmospheres of roap and noap stars with the magnetic field strength .",
    "new results of searching for the line profile variability ( lpv ) in the spectra of ob stars have been recently reported based on observations made with the @xmath21-m telescope of korean bohyunsan optical astronomical observatory and @xmath22-m telescopes of special astrophysical observatory , russia .",
    "for all program stars the regular and often coherent for all spectral lines lpv was reported , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.comparedist ] ( right panel ) for the b1 supergiant @xmath23leo .",
    "this coherence is connected with the presence of the stellar magnetic field .",
    "the moderate dipole magnetic field of @xmath24leo with the polar field strength @xmath25  g was detected by @xcite .    together with the regular lpv the numerous local details of line profiles in spectra of a few program stars are detected and are connected with the formation and destruction of the small - scale structures ( clumps or clouds ) in the stellar wind .",
    "the evidence that numerous clumps exist in the winds of the o6 star @xmath5  ori  a and o9.5 star @xmath26  ori  a was found .",
    "the _ dynamical wavelet spectra _ of lpv technique is used @xcite to determine the distribution of the line fluxes for the clump ensemble in the winds of these stars .",
    "leo in the spectral region @xmath27  in 2004 and 2005 years .",
    "* right panel * : _ dynamical _ spectra of lpv in the same region . , width=475,height=129 ]    many new interesting results have been obtained in the past couple of years from ground - based observations of cp stars , that lead to refinements of `` traditional '' analyses based on observations of ever increasing quality and on more refined analyses evidence effects that had not been previously detected .",
    "definitely , `` new '' observational techniques ( such as interferometry ) have a large potential .",
    "additional observational constraints will force us to re - think some of our `` well - established '' views on the nature , origin and evolution of cp stars bringing bridges between them and some topics of present - day astrophysics ( galactic center , lowest - mass stars , etc . ) .",
    "in parallel to the progress in ground - based observations , modern space missions open a number of possibilities for cp stars research not only in solar neighbourhood , but also much far beyond .",
    "scheduled to be launched in 2012 , gaia is one of the cornerstone astrometric mission of european space agency ( esa ) which will allow to study general properties and characteristics of a huge sample of stars of all spectral types .",
    "gaia will measure position , distances , space motions , radial velocities and fundamental parameters of about @xmath28  billion ( ! ) of sky - objects .",
    "this scanning satellite will observe every single object ( galaxies , quasars , solar system objects , etc . ) up to @xmath1th magnitude , thus providing important scientific constrains almost for all fields of modern astrophysics . with the expected astrometric accuracy of about @xmath29as at @xmath20th magnitude , gaia s precision is more than @xmath30 times higher than those of previously developed missions like tycho and hipparcos .",
    "gaia has two telescopes with two viewing directions separated by @xmath31 : each telescope has sic primary mirror @xmath32  m@xmath33 and @xmath34  m focal length .",
    "the key idea of gaia design is that the images from both telescopes are combined in one focal plane which hosts a number of ccd detectors with the total size of @xmath35 pixels .",
    "many interesting and much more detailed information can be retrieved from official gaia website ( http://www.rssd.esa.int/index.php?project=gaia&page=index ) .",
    "although gaia is at first an astrometric mission , it will also provide us with broad - band spectrophotometric data in wide spectral range .",
    "this is done by two photometers called blue photometer ( bp ) and red photometer ( rp ) with the working wavelength s ranges of @xmath36  nm and @xmath37  nm respectively . in addition",
    ", gaia will be armed with spectrograph for the radial velocity measurements ( rvs ) which operates in a narrow spectral range of @xmath38  nm ( around caii infrared triplet ) with the resolution of @xmath39 .",
    "every detected object will automatically pass through bp / rp and then rvs ccd s , and this opens a wide range of possibilities for stellar studies .",
    "indeed , rp / bp photometry and rvs spectroscopy will ideally allow the determination of such important parameters as @xmath40 , and metallicity based on specific calibrations and sophisticated algorithms that are presently developed : the final catalog of gaia observations is scheduled to 2020 , after 5 years of operation and three years of data reduction phase .",
    "among @xmath28  billion of objects , there will be a certain fraction of cp stars observed .",
    "indeed , depending on spectral classes , @xmath41% of main - sequence b - f stars are cp , and at a0 all slow rotating stars are cp . the determination of the position of these stars , their parameters , binarity , class of peculiarity etc . , would greatly benefit to our understanding of cp phenomenon in general and increase the number of potentially interesting objects for detailed research in particular .",
    "however , we are faced a difficulty that for stars with moderate or strong peculiarities the standard temperature indicators are inadequate and blind application of usual photometric calibrations may lead up to @xmath42  k errors in @xmath12 determination ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . generally , there are two reasons why the energy distributions of cp stars differ from those of normal : inhomogeneous horizontal and vertical elements distribution as well as the presence of strong surface magnetic fields .",
    "all these modifies atmospheric structure and thus lead to abnormal photometric parameters observed for cp stars . as an example , the impact of peculiar opacity on some photometric parameters are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : peculiar ] , which illustrates theoretically predicted behaviour of some parameters .",
    "theoretical models were computed taking into account characteristic temperature behaviour of abundances of cp stars as derived , for example , in @xcite .     as a function of strmgren @xmath43 index for normal ( open cycles ) and",
    "cp ( filled cycles ) stars .",
    "_ right panel _ : same but for bolometric correction bc as a function of @xmath44 genva index .",

    "upper subplot shows difference in bc of non - magnetic cp and @xmath45  kg magnetic cp models with respect to models computed with solar abundances.,title=\"fig:\",height=151 ]    thus , in order to distinguish between normal and cp stars as observed by gaia , as well as to derive the type of peculiarity for individual objects , a parametrization of cp stars is needed .",
    "this , in turn , requires dedicated model atmospheres to predict their observed parameters . in out investigations we employ the llmodels stellar model atmosphere code to compute extensive libraries of high resolution stellar fluxes that are now used for preliminary analysis of gaia simulated data .",
    "llmodels is 1-d , lte model atmosphere code",
    "@xcite that treats the bound - bound opacity by direct , line - by - line spectrum synthesis with the fine frequency spacing ( @xmath46 points , @xmath47 in parallel mode ) thus resolving individual spectral lines .",
    "the code does not use any precalculated opacity tables and no assumptions are made about the depth - dependence of the line absorption coefficient thus providing a high dynamical range in opacity calculation .",
    "this makes it possible to account for the effects of individual non - solar abundance and inhomogeneous vertical distribution of elements .",
    "it can also compute models with detailed treatment of anomalous zeeman splitting @xcite , polarized radiative transfer in all four stokes parameters @xcite , and magnetohydrostatic equilibrium taken into account @xcite .",
    "chemical abundances and stratification are provided as input parameters for the llmodels code and kept constant in the model atmosphere calculation process .",
    "this allow us to explore the changes in model structure due to stratification that were extracted directly from observations without modelling the processes that could be responsible for the observed inhomogeneities .",
    "such an empirical modelling can be applied to any cp star for which accurate spectroscopic observations exist ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and talk jd04-i:5 of this meeting ) .    k ,",

    "user source input specification were used allowing us directly feed gog with high resolution fluxes obtained by llmodels .",
    "calibration and spectral noises were ignored , mostly because their final models are not yet strictly defined .",
    "the model grid of cp stars were computed taking into account characteristic chemistry and effective temperatures of following types of cp stars : am / fm , @xmath5boo , ap , hgmn , he - weak and he - rich .    as an example , fig .",
    "[ fig : ap ] illustrates the result of simulation of bp , rp , and rvs spectra of normal @xmath49  k , @xmath48 star with solar composition and two ap stars : non - magnetic and magnetic with assumed @xmath20  kg surface magnetic field .",
    "it is clearly seen the energy redistribution due to peculiar abundances and magnetic field , and abnormally strong lines of ree in rvs spectrum in case of ap stars .",
    "thus , there is a chance to use both low resolution spectrophotometry and high resolution spectroscopy to verify the type of peculiarity .",
    "the example of am / fm and @xmath5  boo models is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : am ] .",
    "it follows from our analysis that using bp / rp spectra its possible to distinguish only between ap and normal stars .",
    "energy distribution of am / fm , @xmath5boo , hgmn , he - weak and he - rich stars as seen by gaia are hardly different from that of normal stars with the same @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "however , in rvs spectra different types of cp stars are well visible due to the presence of certain spectral features ( like deep fei and caii lines in case of am / fm stars , ree elements in case of ap stars , mni / ii features in case of hgmn stars , etc . ) .",
    "thus , using the bp / rp spectra can most likely help to see cp stars with only strong peculiarities causing substantial energy redistribution from uv to ir and thus easily detectable .",
    "on the other hand , analysis of line strength indices or relative parameters ( like equivalent widths ) in rvs spectra can be applied for all type of cp stars .",
    "in addition , after a standard procedure of gaia s data processing ( which will derive fundamental parameters of all observed stars ) , it will be possible ( based on rvs spectra ) to derive extended astrophysical parameters like magnetic field strength , signatures of element stratification , starspots , etc .    in the framework of this analysis",
    "we carry out calculations of extensive grids of normal and selected cp groups model atmospheres and fluxes , as well as development , testing and implementation of modified stellar parametrization algorithms as applied to cp stars research .    during its @xmath45 years life time",
    ", gaia will observe every object from @xmath50 to @xmath51 times depending upon their individual positions on the sky .",
    "the gaia time sampling is quite irregular , with gaps of typically a month .",
    "still , the probability to recover the periods of strictly periodic signals is high , and this opens a possibility to study a variability of ap and related stars .",
    "the variability amplitude of magnetic cp stars depends on wavelength and is up to @xmath52  mag . for stars with @xmath53  k",
    "the amplitude is lower for longer wavelength ( decreasing amplitude from u to v ) , and with @xmath54  k variability in different filters may be in correlation and thus applying too wide filters may result in very weak or no observed variations at all .",
    "the characteristic periods are from @xmath55  day to decades , and are generally stable .",
    "the preliminary estimate of detected variable ap stars with gaia is about @xmath56 ( lower limit ) and depends upon the galaxy model used .",
    "this is achieved by the high photometric precision of gaia in @xmath57-band ( @xmath58  nm ) which is @xmath1  mmag at @xmath59 and @xmath7  mmag at @xmath60 .",
    "in addition , the application of two separate bp and rp photometers is a good point as it allows to study variability due to energy redistribution from uv to visual and ir .    on the other hand ,",
    "the detection of roap variability is a challenging task for gaia since the characteristic amplitudes are below @xmath61  mag and periods are between @xmath22 and @xmath1 minutes , however , there is a possibility to use data from every single ccd of gaia detector separetely , thus allowing for finer time resolution which is critical for roap stars . for instance , @xcite studied a model of roap star hr  3831 for which they were able to recover three periods assuming stable multiperiodic sinusoidal signal with @xmath62 frequencies ( without noise ) .",
    "later , @xcite investigated zz  ceti stars resulting in 65% of recovery of a period ( multi - periodic nonlinear stable signal with @xmath63 frequencies , with noise at @xmath64  mag ) .",
    "thus , the goal of using gaia data in the light of variability research is to detect and classify correctly roap with some period(s ) and amplitude(s ) characteristics .",
