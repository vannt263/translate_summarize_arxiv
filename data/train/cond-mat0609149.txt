    "in all 4@xmath7 elemental metals , including ru , the degree of overlap between neighboring 4@xmath7 orbitals is far too great to permit the formation of either local - moment or itinerant magnetism @xcite .",
    "one can estimate , however , that if one were to increase the interatomic separations in ru metal by 45% or more , the degree of 4@xmath7-orbital overlap would decrease sufficiently for ru metal to exhibit itinerant magnetism @xcite .",
    "we note that in the itinerant ferromagnet srruo@xmath1 , the only known ferromagnetic metal among the 4@xmath7 oxides @xcite , the nearest - neighbor separation between ru ions ( @xmath8 3.92  ) is 48% greater than that in ru metal ( 2.65  ) .",
    "the oxygen anions in srruo@xmath1 also play an important role in its magnetism , the ru - o direct exchange interaction being estimated to be strongly ferromagnetic @xcite .",
    "ferromagnetism would appear to be less likely in caruo@xmath1 than in srruo@xmath1 since in the former oxide the ru - ru nearest - neighbor separation is less and the degree of structural disorder is greater ; indeed , caruo@xmath1 exhibits no magnetic order but is paramagnetic with a negative curie - weiss temperature @xmath9 k indicative of antiferromagnetic correlations @xcite .",
    "both theoretical and experimental studies have underscored the important role structural disorder plays in suppressing the magnetic ordering temperature in these ruthenates @xcite and other atomically arranged perovskites @xcite .",
    "weak itinerant ferromagnets such as zrzn@xmath10 @xcite , uge@xmath10 @xcite , mnsi @xcite , and srruo@xmath1 @xcite have enjoyed considerable interest for many years because of the possibility of unconventional superconductivity , non fermi liquid behavior , and other exotic phenomena near quantum critical points .",
    "relatively minor perturbations , such as those generated by high pressures , are able to transport the system from one ground state to another , including the destruction of the ferromagnetic state . that the magnetism is weakened under pressure follows from the above discussion since the degree of overlap between the magnetic orbitals increases under pressure .",
    "wohlfarth @xcite derived an expression valid for weak itinerant ferromagnets whereby the rate of decrease of the curie temperature with pressure , @xmath11 is inversely proportional to the value of @xmath0 itself .",
    "it is notable that the weak itinerant ferromagnet sc@xmath1 in does not fit into this scheme since its curie temperature initially _ increases _ under pressure @xcite .",
    "several years ago belitz _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite argued on general grounds that in a weakly ferromagnetic system the nature of the ferromagnetic transition would be expected to change from second to first order at a tricritical point , i.e. under an external perturbation such as pressure , the order parameter ( magnetization ) and curie temperature should disappear discontinuously above a critical pressure @xmath12 metamagnetic transitions are anticipated out of the paramagnetic state for pressures above @xmath13 if strong magnetic fields are applied .",
    "such first - order transitions under pressure with accompanying field - induced metamagnetism have been found in the weak itinerant ferromagnets zrzn@xmath10 @xcite and uge@xmath10 @xcite ; in the latter compound the weak ferromagnetism even coexists with superconductivity .",
    "it is clearly of interest to investigate further systems in order to establish whether the behavior found for zrzn@xmath10 and uge@xmath10 is only an anomaly or representative for weak itinerant ferromagnets in general .",
    "more than a decade ago we carried out ac susceptibility ( @xmath14 ) studies in a diamond - anvil cell ( dac ) on polycrystalline srruo@xmath1 to nearly hydrostatic ( dense helium ) pressures as high as 6 gpa @xcite .",
    "the curie temperature was found to decrease approximately linearly from 161 k to 130 k at the rate @xmath15 -5.7 k / gpa , a value somewhat less in magnitude than that ( -7.5 k / gpa ) from ac susceptibility studies to 0.78 gpa by shikano _",

    "_ @xcite carried out electrical resistivity measurements on srruo@xmath1 thin films epitaxially grown on a batio@xmath1 substrate under high quasihydrostatic pressure ( solid steatite pressure medium ) to 23 and 21 gpa , respectively . in both experiments @xmath0",
    "was observed to decrease from 150 k at ambient pressure to approximately 75 k at 13 gpa , yielding a negative pressure derivative @xmath15 -5.9 k / gpa close to our value for bulk srruo@xmath1 above ; however , for @xmath16 was reported to pass through a minimum near 15 gpa , increasing at higher pressures only slightly in the former experiment @xcite but strongly in the latter @xcite .",
    "this abrupt change in slope @xmath17 near 15 gpa may signal a structural phase transition .",
    "however , the fact that the @xmath16 dependences differ in the two thin - film experiments suggests that shear stresses might play an important role ; such shear stresses could arise either from the solid steatite pressure medium or from the increasing lattice mismatch between thin - film sample and substrate under pressure .",
    "x - ray diffraction and magnetic susceptibility studies on bulk srruo@xmath1 samples to very high nearly hydrostatic pressures would clearly be of value to help clarify these issues and establish the intrinsic pressure dependence @xmath16 .    in the present paper",
    "we extend the pressure range of our previous ac susceptibility measurements and include high - pressure structural studies as well . over the pressure range to 17.2 gpa @xmath0",
    "is found to decrease nearly linearly with nearly hydrostatic pressure at the rate -6.8 k / gpa with no indication of a slope change near 15 gpa .",
    "furthermore , ambient - temperature x - ray diffraction studies to 25.3 gpa reveal that srruo@xmath1 remains in the orthorhombic structure over the entire pressure range .",
    "interestingly , the pressure dependences of the lattice parameters are quite complex but allow the estimate that the average ru - o - ru bond angle @xmath3 initially decreases under pressure but passes through a minimum near 15 gpa . a possible correlation between the pressure dependence of the curie temperature @xmath0 and the bond angle @xmath3 is discussed .",
    "the present results make it imperative that the magnetic and superconducting properties of this interesting system be extended to even higher pressures and lower temperatures .",
    "the polycrystalline sample of srruo@xmath1 used in the present experiments was prepared by solid state reaction of stoichiometric quantities of high purity ( 99.9% or better ) srco@xmath1 and ruo@xmath10 .",
    "the starting materials were weighed , mixed and placed in an al@xmath10o@xmath1 crucible .",
    "the specimen was reacted for 4 hours at 1100@xmath18c , ground with an agate mortar and pestle for 5 min and reacted in air for 6 h at 1250@xmath18c .",
    "subsequently , the specimen was reground for 5 min and reacted at 1250@xmath18c for 14 h and cooled by shutting the furnace off .",
    "powder x - ray diffraction proved the specimen to be single - phase with no observable secondary phases .",
    "single - crystals of srruo@xmath1 were grown in pt crucibles from off - stoichiometric quantities of ruo@xmath10 , srco@xmath1 , and srcl@xmath1 mixtures with srcl@xmath10 self flux .",
    "the mixtures were first heated to 1500@xmath18c , soaked for 25 hours , slowly cooled at 2 - 3@xmath18c / hour to 1350@xmath18c , and finally cooled to room temperature at 100@xmath18c / hour .",
    "the single crystals were characterized by single crystal x - ray diffraction and by scanning and transmission electron microscopies .",
    "all results indicate that the single crystals are of high quality .",
    "high pressure x - ray diffraction experiments were performed in a dac on polycrystalline srruo@xmath1 using synchrotron x - rays ( @xmath19  ) with beam size @xmath20 @xmath21m@xmath22 at the advanced photon source hpcat , sector 16-idb , argonne national labs .",
    "the powder sample was loaded together with a ruby chip and silicon fluid as pressure medium into a 135 @xmath21 m diameter bore through a rhenium gasket @xcite .",
    "the x - ray diffraction patterns ( see fig .  1 ) were collected using a mar image plate camera with @xmath23 @xmath21m@xmath22 pixel dimension for 10 - 20 s. the images were integrated using fit2d program @xcite and structural refinements were carried out using jade @xcite .",
    "high - pressure ac magnetic susceptibility measurements @xmath24 were carried out using a dac made of cube alloy @xcite where two 1/6-carat type ia diamond anvils with 0.5 mm diameter culets press onto a 3 mm diameter gold - plated rhenium gasket preindented from 250 @xmath21 m to 80 @xmath21 m thickness and containing a centered 235 @xmath21 m diameter hole . after the sample",
    "( typical dimensions @xmath25 @xmath21m@xmath26 and tiny ruby spheres @xcite are placed in the hole , the dac is assembled , cooled down to low temperatures and flooded with liquid helium pumped to 2 k. the opposing diamond anvils are then pressed into the gasket to trap and build up pressure in the liquid helium pressure medium surrounding the sample . as in the above x - ray studies ,",
    "the standard ruby calibration @xcite is used to determine the pressure to within @xmath27 gpa .",
    "the temperature was kept below 180 k during the entire experiment to reduce the chance that helium might enter the diamond anvils , possibly causing them to fail .",
    "the ferromagnetic transition at @xmath0 is determined inductively using two balanced primary / secondary coil systems located immediately outside the metal gasket @xcite and connected to a stanford research sr830 digital lock - in amplifier .",
    "the ac susceptibility studies were carried out using a 3 oe r.m.s .",
    "magnetic field at 1023 hz .",
    "further experimental details of the diamond - anvil cell and ac susceptibility techniques are published elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the lock - in amplifier allows the measurement of not only the basic 1st harmonic of the ac susceptibility , @xmath28 , but also the higher harmonics . since in this experiment",
    "the signal from the ferromagnetic transition of srruo@xmath1 in @xmath28 becomes very difficult to resolve for pressures above 10 gpa , we decided to also measure the 3rd harmonic @xmath29 which has a superior signal / noise ratio at the highest pressures .",
    "in contrast to @xmath30 where the transition is only revealed after the subtraction of a relatively large temperature - dependent background , the background signal in @xmath31 has little temperature dependence . in fig .  2 we compare at ambient pressure the real part of the 1st harmonic @xmath32 to the imaginary part of the 3rd harmonic @xmath33 for a single - crystalline sample much larger ( @xmath34 @xmath21m@xmath35 ) than that used in a typical high - pressure experiment in the dac .",
    "it is seen that the temperature of the peak in @xmath32 , which we use to define the curie temperature @xmath36 corresponds well with the transition onset in @xmath37 as we will see , measuring the 3rd harmonic allows us to follow the ferromagnetic transition in srruo@xmath1 to higher pressures .",
    "at ambient pressure srruo@xmath1 is found to crystallize in the orthorhombic structure ( pbnm , 62 ) with lattice parameters @xmath38  , @xmath39  , @xmath40  , in good agreement with literature values @xcite .",
    "1 shows the x - ray diffraction patterns at various pressures to 25.3 gpa . as pressure",
    "is increased , no new peaks are found indicating the sample retains the orthorhombic crystal structure . however , the peaks broaden due to increasing nonhydrostatic conditions in the solidified silicone pressure medium .",
    "the pressure dependences of the lattice parameters are given in table i and are shown in fig .",
    "3 ( upper ) .",
    "the smooth monotonic change in all lattice parameters under pressure to 25.3 gpa is consistent with the absence of even an isostructural phase transition over this pressure range .",
    "however , it is seen that there is a crossover of the @xmath41 and @xmath42 parameters near 15 gpa ; this will be discussed in detail below .    the equation of state for srruo@xmath1 is shown in fig .",
    "3 ( lower ) with the least - squares fit ( solid line ) obtained using the birch - murnaghan expression @xcite @xmath43   \\times\\left\\ {   1+\\frac{3}{4}\\left ( b_{0}^{\\prime}-4\\right )   \\left [   \\left (   v / v_{0}\\right )   ^{-2/3}-1\\right ] \\right\\ }   , \\ ] ] where @xmath44 gpa is the bulk modulus and @xmath45 its pressure derivative .",
    "these values are similar to those found in ca - based perovskites with pbnm symmetry and similar ambient pressure volumes @xcite .",
    "again , we find no evidence for a structural phase transition near @xmath46 gpa where abrupt changes in @xmath17 were seen for two different thin - film srruo@xmath1 samples @xcite",
    ". however , this pressure lies near that for the lattice parameter crossover seen in fig .  3 ( upper ) .",
    "as it is known that @xmath0 is reduced @xcite as one moves farther away from cubic symmetry by substituting ca for sr , it is instructive to ask whether pressure might have a similar effect . following the work of others @xcite , if one assumes that the ruo@xmath47 coordination octahedra are not distorted and only rotate when pressure is applied ( a reasonable assumption for the small rotations occurring in srruo@xmath1 ) , the angles of rotation around the characteristic directions of the ideal cubic perovskite structure can be calculated by simply using the orthorhombic lattice parameters .",
    "the validity of using this model in a semi - quantitative manner for determining the tilt angles has been shown by the good agreement between the angles estimated from the lattice parameters and directly from the atomic positions @xcite .",
    "the ru - o - ru bond angles can be found simply from the angle of rotation @xmath48 around the ( 111)@xmath49 direction of the ideal cubic perovskite structure given by @xmath50 the ru - o - ru bond angles @xmath51 and @xmath52 are then given by@xmath53 while the absolute values of the angles may not be in exact agreement , the relative change of the angles obtained using these formula agrees well with high resolution diffraction data .",
    "in fact , as one goes from srruo@xmath1 to caruo@xmath1 , direct calculation of the average ru - o - ru bond angle @xmath3 decreases by 14.1@xmath18 @xcite , while the estimate from the lattice parameters is 15.4@xmath18 .",
    "the inset in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "3 shows the pressure dependence of the average ru - o - ru bond angle calculated from the lattice parameters . up",
    "to approximately 15 gpa we find that the value of the angle @xmath3 decreases in a nearly linear fashion ( @xmath54 @xmath55/gpa ) signifying that the perovskite structure is becoming more distorted .",
    "however , for pressures above 15 gpa the angle @xmath3 is seen to increase ! we explore the significance of this finding below .",
    "we have also found that these structural results are reproduced when ar or a 4:1 methanol : ethanol mixture is used as the pressure transmitting media instead of silicon oil .",
    "this leads us to the conclusion that the results of our structural studies on bulk samples are not unduly sensitive to the pressure transmitting fluid used .",
    "this along with detailed structural information will be presented in a future report @xcite .",
    "the first of the present experiments ( run b ) was carried out on a polycrystalline srruo@xmath1 sample ( dimensions @xmath56 @xmath57m@xmath35 ) in a dac under nearly hydrostatic pressures to 14.7 gpa . in fig .",
    "4 the results are compared to those from our earlier measurements to 6 gpa ( run a ) @xcite ; the agreement is reasonable , although the final two data points in the earlier study lie somewhat above the straight - line fit . from 0 to 14.7 gpa",
    "the height of the transition in the ac susceptibility decreased from approximately 5 to 1.5 nv .",
    "one should not conclude from this that the value of the magnetic moment per ion necessarily decreases since the ac susceptibility measures only the initial response of the sample magnetization to an imposed magnetic field and thus also depends on extrinsic parameters such as the degree of domain wall pinning .",
    "a pressure - dependent reduction in the applied field by shielding currents in the re gasket may also contribute to the signal reduction .",
    "the failure of the diamond anvils ended the experiment in run b.    run b was followed by run c on a polycrystalline sample ( dimensions @xmath58 @xmath21m@xmath35 ) to 9 gpa ; as seen in fig .  4 ,",
    "the results are in good agreement with those from run b. from 0 to 9 gpa the height of the transition decreased from 2.5 to 0.6 nv . at the next higher pressure",
    "( 15 gpa ) the transition had decreased sufficiently in size that it was not possible to unequivocally identify it .    the next high - pressure dac experiment ( run d )",
    "was carried out on a single - crystalline srruo@xmath1 sample ( dimensions @xmath59 @xmath57m@xmath35 ) where both @xmath32 and @xmath33 were measured in an effort to track the ferromagnetic transition to higher pressures ( fig .",
    "the transition height in @xmath32 is seen to decrease roughly by a factor of two from 0 to 9.9 gpa , but the transition also becomes broader , perhaps due to nonhydrostatic stresses even in the helium pressure medium ; the area under the transition curve decreases by only @xmath8 20% over the pressure range to 9.9 gpa . at higher pressures",
    "the transition could not be identified in the 1st harmonic , so @xmath33 was measured ( see the lower half of fig .  5 ) . even though the transition in @xmath33 is relatively small",
    ", the absence of a strong temperature - dependent background signal allows one to track @xmath16 to higher pressures .",
    "the dependence of @xmath0 on pressure is seen in fig .  4 to be reversible and approximately linear to 17.2 gpa with slope @xmath2 k / gpa , @xmath0 decreasing from 162 k to 42.7 k , i.e. by nearly a factor of four .",
    "unfortunately , at higher pressures ( 20.4 to 34 gpa ) the ferromagnetic transition could no longer be resolved .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , in a canonical weak itinerant ferromagnet the curie temperature and saturation magnetization would be expected to decrease monotonically under pressure , falling to zero at a critical pressure @xmath13 @xcite . that srruo@xmath1 may exhibit more complex behavior",
    "is indicated by the fact that in thin - film studies @xcite the curie temperature passes through a minimum near 15 gpa ( fig .",
    "4 ) , approximately the same pressure where we find the average ru - o - ru bond angle @xmath3 in a crystalline sample to pass through a minimum ( fig .  3 ) . indeed , in sr@xmath60ca@xmath61ruo@xmath1 and related systems the value of @xmath0 appears to be inversely related to the degree of distortions away from the ideal cubic perovskite structure , i.e. the greater the distortions , the lesser the average bond angle @xmath3 and the lower the value of @xmath0 @xcite . we can estimate the dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath3 by considering that upon increasing @xmath62 in sr@xmath60ca@xmath61ruo@xmath1 from 0 to 1 the value of @xmath0 decreases from 162 k to 0 k whereas the bond angle @xmath3 decreases by 15.4@xmath18 @xcite , yielding @xmath63 k/@xmath64 we note that this value of @xmath65 is quite close to that derived from the values of @xmath17 and @xmath66 in the present high - pressure experiments from 0 to 15 gpa where @xmath67 k / gpa@xmath68",
    "@xmath55/gpa@xmath69 k/@xmath70 the present experiments on the single - crystalline srruo@xmath1 sample thus support the contention that @xmath0 is correlated with the degree of structural distortion as represented by the bond angle @xmath71 at least in the pressure range 0 - 15 gpa .    for pressures at 15 gpa and above",
    ", @xmath3 passes through a minimum and then increases quite rapidly , as seen in fig .",
    "the above correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath3 for bulk srruo@xmath1 would then lead to the expectation that @xmath16 should also pass through a minimum near 15 gpa and increase at higher pressures .",
    "unfortunately , this possibility can not be adequately checked in the present experiment since the anticipated minimum in @xmath16 at 15 gpa lies close to the maximum pressure ( 17.2 gpa ) for which the ferromagnetic transition can be resolved .",
    "it is not unreasonable to assume that @xmath16 may pass through a minimum at lower pressures in thin - film relative to bulk samples since the former are already in a strained state at ambient pressure which is consistent with their lower ambient pressure value of @xmath0 . in the thin - film studies shear",
    "stresses may originate either from the solid pressure medium or from the increasing lattice mismatch between the thin - film srruo@xmath1 sample and its catio@xmath1 substrate ; the latter effect is expected since the bulk moduli @xmath72 of srruo@xmath1 ( 192(3 ) gpa ) and catio@xmath1 ( 176 gpa from ref .",
    "@xcite ) differ by 9% .",
    "the fact that for both thin film samples a break in slope in @xmath16 is observed near 15 gpa with quite different behavior at higher pressures can easily be explained by differing strain states in the two thin film samples .",
    "this would lead to different values of the ru - o - ru angles , and hence different @xmath0 values , as a function of pressure .",
    "a search for superconductivity in single - crystalline srruo@xmath1 with negative results was carried out by measuring @xmath32 or @xmath73 to temperatures as low as 4 k at the following pressures :  17.2 , 20.4 , 21.3 , 22.5 , 23.8 , 25.8 , and 34 gpa .",
    "similar ac susceptibility studies on polycrystalline caruo@xmath1 at 6 and 8 gpa found no evidence for either ferromagnetism or superconductivity above 4 k.    in summary , parallel ac susceptibility and x - ray diffraction studies have been carried out on poly- and single - crystalline samples of srruo@xmath1 to 34 and 25.3 gpa , respectively .",
