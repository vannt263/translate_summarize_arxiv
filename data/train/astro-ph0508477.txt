    "gravitational lensing and microlensing have been treated and employed as powerful tools to study astrophysical objects and phenomena ( schnierder , ehlers and falco 1993 ; mollerach , esteban 2002 ) . among many examples and applications",
    "one could mention the search for macho candidates at the galactic halo using gravitational microlensing with the recent data pointing at the absence of them @xcite .",
    "other application of gravitational microlensing include ( a ) study of stellar atmosphere ( cassan et al .",
    "2004 ; abe et al .",
    "2003 ; bryce et al .",
    "2002 ) , ( b ) planet searching ( bennet et al . 1999 ) , ( c ) exotic matter searches such as magnetic masses @xcite and wormholes ( safonova , torres and romero 2002 ) , ( d ) possible black hole detection based on gravitational microlensing method ( agol et .",
    "al 2002 ) .",
    "furthermore it seems that future observations will be based on astrometric microlensing which is hoped to improve previous studies .",
    "another application which is the concern of this paper includes angular momentum detection by photometric and astrometric microlensing .",
    "this in turn could enhance detection of black hole candidates through this extra parameter .",
    "+ the outline of the paper is as follows : in section [ photometry ] we introduce photometric and astrometric microlensing .",
    "section [ kerr ] contains gravitational microlensing in kerr metric and sensitivity of angular momentum detection to the lens parameters .",
    "conclusion and summery are given in section [ sum ] .",
    "simple microlensing events occur when the approximation of a point - like deflector and point - like source in a relative uniform motion is valid in the galactic scale @xcite . at a given time t",
    ", the light magnification @xmath2 of a point - like source located at lens - source @xmath3 and observer - lens @xmath4 distances induced by a point - like deflector of mass @xmath5 is given by : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the impact parameter ( distance between lens and source in the lens plane ) , expressed in units of the `` einstein radius '' @xmath8 and is given by : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the newtonian gravitational constant and @xmath11 is the velocity of light .",
    "assuming a source moving at a constant relative transverse speed @xmath12 , reaching its minimum distance @xmath13 to the lens in the lens plane at time @xmath14 , @xmath7 is given by : @xmath15 where @xmath16 , the `` einstein crossing time '' , is the only measurable parameter providing useful information about the lens in the approximation of the simple microlensing . within this approximation ,",
    "the light - curve of a microlensed star is fully determined by the parameters @xmath17 and @xmath16 . in the next two subsections we introduce astrometry and parallax effect and their signature in the gravitational microlensing .      for a point like source at distance @xmath18 in the lens plane from a point like gravitational lens",
    ", it is well known that the images are located at : @xmath19 corresponding amplifications are given by : @xmath20 the location of the center of images with respect to lens , in the lens plane , is defined by : @xmath21 we are interested in the deflection of the combined images , i.e. the location of centroid with respect to the source , so we transform @xmath22 to @xmath23 i.e : @xmath24 as @xmath25 changes with time @xmath23 plots a pattern . in the case of the schwarzschild space - time the pattern is an ellipse .",
    "+ to study the asymptotic behavior of the standard astrometric microlensing , we examine equation ( [ c_image ] ) .",
    "if @xmath26 , the centroid shift falls off like @xmath27 , this can be compared with the photometric amplification a , which falls off like : @xmath28 .",
    "these asymptotic results illustrate one of the important differences between astrometric and photometric microlensing namely that the _ centroid shift falls off much more slowly than amplification_. in consequence , cross section for astrometric events is much larger than that for photometric events @xcite .",
    "if the variation of the earth s velocity around the sun is not negligible with respect to the projected transverse speed of the deflector , then the apparent trajectory of the deflector with respect to the line of sight is a cycloid instead of a straight line .",
    "the resulting amplification versus time is therefore affected by the so - called _",
    "parallax effect_. this effect is more easily observable for long duration events ( several months ) , for which the change in the earths velocity is important @xcite .",
    "if @xmath29 is the position of the deflector in the deflector s transverse plane and @xmath30 is the intercept of the earth - source line of sight with this plane , then : @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 is the angle between the projected lens trajectory and the projected major axis of the earth s orbit in the deflector plane . here",
    "@xmath34 is the closest approach of the lens to the sun at the lens plane . neglecting the earth s",
    "orbital eccentricity , @xmath30 is given by : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the projection of the earth s orbital radius in the deflector plane in unit of einstein radius and @xmath37 , @xmath38 is the angle between the ecliptic and deflector planes and @xmath39 is the phase of the earth relative to its position at @xmath40 .",
    "the distortion of the light curve is important if the earth s orbital velocity around the sun is not negligible with respect to the projected transverse speed of the deflector : @xmath41 rahvar et al .",
    "( 2003 ) proposed an observation strategy , using the alert and follow - up telescopes for that can put constrain on the mass and distance of lens in the direction of magellanic clouds . adding a third telescope such as gaia or sim one can break the degeneracy between the parameters of lens through astrometric measurements @xcite .",
    "[ f1 ] shows the photometry and the astrometry of center of images for the case of simple and considering the parallax effects for a typical lens located at @xmath42 from the observer with the source star at @xmath43 .",
    "gravitational lensing in the field of a rotating star has been studied previously , for example in @xcite . here",
    "we employ the formalism introduced by ibanez ( 1983 ) in which the first approximation in @xmath10 of kerr metric was used . in the slow - motion or the fast - motion approximation ,",
    "the bending angle is given by : @xmath44,\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the impact parameter , @xmath46 spin of the lens and @xmath47 a unit vector representing the initial direction of incoming photons toward the lens .",
    "we note that for @xmath46 normal to the lens plane , the second term in the right hand side of equation ( [ dev_eq ] ) vanishes and we can not observe the signature of angular momentum on the position of images .",
    "the relation between the position of image and source at the lens plane perpendicular to the line of sight is given by : @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 is the projected angular momentum on the lens plane . @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the components of the source and image positions respectively .",
    "( y - axis is chosen along projection of spin at the lens plane ) . at the lens plane ,",
    "the ratio of the terms corresponding to that of the angular momentum to the of mass , in the deviation of light ray is @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the rotation speed of lens , @xmath55 is gyration radius and @xmath56 is the position of images .",
    "sine @xmath57 and @xmath58 , the ratio of the spin to the mass term should be smaller than one , means that @xmath59 . for a typical lens of solar mass , in the milky way , the images are produced at an astronomical distance from the lens , in other words @xmath60 . for lenses with larger masses and located at the galactic scale , the upper limit on the spin will be higher .",
    "+ for a given source , equations ( [ proj1 ] ) and ( [ proj2 ] ) in principle have three solutions , which means that rotating stars produce three images through lensing where the third image is very close to the lens . glicenstein ( 1999 ) has showed that the third image having a very small impact parameter , it always eclipsed by the lens itself . using equations ( [ proj1 ] ) and ( [ proj2 ] ) ,",
    "the amplification of the light of an image produced by a rotating lens is given by :    @xmath61      as the equations ( [ proj1 ] ) and ( [ proj2 ] ) are too complex to be solved analytically , we employ the method of initial guess and substitute the schwarzschild solution in ( [ proj1 ] ) and ( [ proj2 ] ) and through iteration obtain the location of images in the linear kerr metric .",
    "[ f2 ] shows the astrometry of the center of images and the photometry of a microlensing event by a rotating star .",
    "similar to the case of schwarzschild metric the parallax effect alters the path of center of images in the kerr metric .",
    "astrometries in schwarzschild and kerr metrics with and without the parallax effect are compared in fig .",
    "since the parallax is not an intrinsic effect it alters the center of images with the same amount both in kerr and schwarzschild spaces , fig .[f3 ] .",
    "subtraction of the parallax effect from the path of the center of the images may help us to distinguish the kerr from schwarzschild metric .",
    "+ in practice , the astrometric measurements can be done by a ground - based telescope accompanying a space - based interferometry telescope .",
    "the ground - based telescope signals the microlensing events and undertakes photometric measurement and the space - based telescope measures the displacement of image centroids .",
    "we examine the sensitivity of angular momentum detection as a function of lens parameters .",
    "to do so we need a monte carlo simulation generating the mass function as well as the corresponding angular momentum for a given direction of milky way and use observational efficiency to estimate the number of events .",
    "however , since the dependence of angular momentum to the mass function of stars is not well know , we generate a uniform distribution of lens parameters and use the criterion that the difference between the astrometry of kerr and ordinary lenses should be more than the angular resolution of gaia or sim ( @xmath62 ) . the fraction of events with the detectable angular momentum is shown in fig . [ f4 ] .",
    "it is seen that the angular momentum detection is correlated to all of the parameters of the lens .",
    "increasing the spin , in contrast to the mass rises the detection probability .",
    "very short and long einstein crossing times are not favored for the spin detection but on the other hand small impact parameter is more convenient for our propose .",
    "the distance of lens from the observer also decreases the sensibility of angular momentum detection .",
    "the effect of distance decreases the displacement of center of images , fig .",
    "in the present study we examined the possibility of angular momentum detection of rotating lenses by the gravitational microlensing . out of two methods of photometric and astrometric microlensing , the latter is more feasible .",
    "future space - based interferometry telescopes such as gaia and sim can be used for this purpose . studying the detection sensitivity in terms of the lens parameters showed that the centriod of images in the lenses with angular momentum larger than @xmath0 deviates more than @xmath63 from that of the schwarzschild case .",
    "recent analysis of x - ray spectral data from _ asca _ and _ rxte _ of the two black hole candidates gro j1655 - 40 and 4u 1543 - 47 has estimated the corresponding dimensionless spin parameter @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 respectively @xcite . considering",
    "our estimation of the spin detection limit implies that the mass of an extreme black hole @xmath67 with observable angular momentum should be more than @xmath1 .",
