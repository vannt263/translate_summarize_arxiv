    "a key goal of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) physics programme is to reveal the properties of the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) sector in nature .",
    "the atlas and cms data from the 7 and 8 tev runs of lhc show that the properties of the newly discovered higgs particle are compatible with those expected for the standard model ( sm ) higgs boson @xmath6 .",
    "yet , it still needs to be determined whether the scalar sector consists of one @xmath7 doublet or has a richer structure , with additional states .",
    "a particularly appealing feature of extensions of the sm scalar sector , like two - higgs - doublet - models ( 2hdms ) , is that they could successfully explain the generation of the cosmic matter - antimatter asymmetry via electroweak baryogenesis @xcite .",
    "a key requirement in this context is that the electroweak phase transition ( ewpt ) in the early universe be strongly first order , which for the sm with a @xmath8 gev higgs is not the case @xcite .",
    "here we review the results of @xcite , showing that the characteristic signature of a strongly first order ewpt in 2hdms is the decay @xmath9 , and analyzing its promising search prospects at the 14 tev run of lhc in the @xmath10 and @xmath11 final states .",
    "this signature could then provide a connection between the generation of the cosmic matter - antimatter asymmetry in the early universe and searches for new physics at lhc .",
    "the scalar sector of a 2hdm contains two scalar doublets @xmath12 . in the following",
    "we assume for simplicity no charge - parity ( cp ) violation in the scalar sector .",
    "then , apart from the recently observed ( cp - even ) higgs boson @xmath6 , the 2hdm physical spectrum contains a charged scalar @xmath2 , a cp - even scalar @xmath0 , and a cp - odd scalar @xmath1 . after fixing the electroweak ( ew ) vacuum expectation value ( vev ) @xmath13 gev and the higgs mass @xmath8  gev , the remaining parameters in the scalar potential are : the masses @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , two angles @xmath17 and @xmath18 and a dimensionful parameter @xmath19 . here",
    "the angle @xmath18 is defined such that when @xmath20 , the state @xmath0 decouples from gauge bosons , and @xmath6 has sm - like properties , known as the _ alignment limit _ ( see @xcite for a review of 2hdms , and @xcite for details on the definition of parameters and the conventions chosen ) .    in order to study the strength of the ewpt in 2hdms , a scan over the new physics parameters @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath19 is performed .",
    "the yukawa type of 2hdm considered is irrelevant for the ewpt ( all types couple in the same way to the top quark ) , while experimental constraints do differ between types .",
    "we choose a type i 2hdm , which is less constrained than a type ii , and thus provides a better gauging of the impact of a first order ewpt on the 2hdm parameter space .",
    "the scan is interfaced to 2hdmc  @xcite and higgsbounds  @xcite to select points in parameter space that satisfy stability , unitarity , perturbativity , ew precision constraints and collider bounds .",
    "flavour constraints ( coming mainly from @xmath23 for type i 2hdm @xcite ) and constraints from measured higgs signal strengths on @xmath21 and @xmath24 ( see e.g. @xcite ) are also included .",
    "point in our scan satisfying the above constraints are called _ physical points_. for them , the strength of the ewpt is computed via the thermal 1-loop effective potential ( see @xcite for details ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : ewpt ] we show heat - maps of physical points ( _ left _ ) and points with a strongly first order ewpt ( _ right _ ) in the planes ( @xmath25 ) and ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "altogether , a strong ewpt as needed for electroweak baryogenesis strongly favours a rather heavy cp - odd scalar @xmath1 ( @xmath27 gev ) , together with a large mass splitting @xmath28 , as shown in figure  [ fig : ewpt ] ( bottom )",
    ". it also favours the light higgs @xmath6 to have sm - like properties , _",
    "i.e. _ small @xmath24 and moderate @xmath21 @xcite , the range of @xmath24 leading to a strong ewpt shrinking as the cp - even state @xmath0 becomes heavier .    )",

    "the dotted - black line corresponds to @xmath29.,scaledwidth=63.0% ]    [ fig : ewpt ]",
    "the results of the previous section point towards the @xmath9 decay channel ( see also @xcite ) as a characteristic signature of 2hdms with a strong ewpt , to be searched for at the upcoming 14 tev run of the lhc .",
    "this decay is strongly favoured both by the large phase space available and by the @xmath31 dependence of the coupling @xmath32 , unsuppressed in the alignment limit .",
    "this is in contrast with the decay @xmath33 , which vanishes in that limit ( since @xmath34 ) , and is therefore suppressed in this scenario ( see figure [ fig : br ] ) .",
    "the competing decay channels would then be @xmath35 and possibly @xmath36 .",
    "the former is subdominant for @xmath37 ( figure [ fig : br ] ) .",
    "the presence of the latter depends on the splitting @xmath38 .",
    "ew precision observables require @xmath2 to be close in mass to either @xmath0 or @xmath1 @xcite , which makes @xmath36 either kinematically forbidden or similar to @xmath9 , and here we assume for simplicity @xmath39 .    in the following we analyze two prototypical scenarios which feature @xmath40  gev , @xmath41 and @xmath42  gev , and with @xmath43 ( benchmark a ) and @xmath44 ( benchmark b ) , as shown in figure [ fig : br ] .",
    "these two benchmarks characterize the two dominant alternatives for the subsequent decay of @xmath0 : @xmath45 dominates very close to the alignment limit , while away from it @xmath46 ( and to a lesser extent @xmath47 ) is the dominant decay mode .     as a function of @xmath14 for @xmath42   gev , @xmath48 , @xmath40  gev , @xmath49 ( benchmark a , solid lines ) and @xmath50 ( benchmark b , dotted lines ) .",

    "we now analyze the search prospects in the @xmath55 and @xmath56 channels at the 14 tev run of the lhc using the defined benchmarks a and b from section [ section3 ] and considering in both cases a mass for the cp even scalar @xmath57  gev .",
    "concentrating first on benchmark a , which corresponds to the @xmath55 final state , the two main sm backgrounds are : ( i ) @xmath58 production ( with @xmath59 ) , ( ii ) qcd @xmath60 production ( with @xmath61 ) , while the rest of potential backgrounds ( e.g. @xmath62 production and associated production of a higgs @xmath6 and a @xmath63 boson ) are found to be practically negligible @xcite .",

    "the leading order cross sections at lhc 14 tev after event selection for the signal and @xmath62 background are respectively @xmath98 fb and @xmath99 fb . we note that a @xmath63-veto on the remaining lepton pair would greatly suppress the @xmath62 background , as would a veto on sf leptons ( this at the expense of reducing the signal by a factor 2 ) . defining the transverse mass variables @xmath84 and @xmath85 @xmath100    ( @xmath101 are the two sf leptons most closely reconstructing @xmath96 )",
