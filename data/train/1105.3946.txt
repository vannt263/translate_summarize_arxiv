    "there are of order 100300 million close pairs of white dwarfs in the galaxy .",
    "they are thought to be the dominant source of background gravitational waves detectable by _ lisa _ @xcite .",
    "the loss of orbital angular momentum via gravitational radiation in these systems will eventually bring the two white dwarfs into contact with one another .",
    "those that achieve this within a hubble time are possible progenitors of am cvn binaries , r crb stars and type ia supernovae @xcite .",
    "the coalescence of two low - mass , helium core white dwarfs is also a possible formation channel for the creation of single sdb stars @xcite ; indeed it may be one of the more important sdb formation channels @xcite .",
    "there are now 43 detached double white dwarf binaries known ( @xcite ; @xcite and references therein ) but few of these yield the precise parameters needed to determine their eventual fate .",
    "the subject of this paper , css 41177 ( sdss j100559.10 + 224932.2 ) , was listed as a white dwarf plus main sequence binary by @xcite .",
    "they used a marginal 2mass detection to infer the presence of a late - type companion though they note that a small faint object could also produce the observed transit signal .",
    "we observed css 41177 as part of a monitoring campaign for period variations in white dwarf plus main sequence binaries . with a better sampled eclipse and detection of the secondary eclipse we realised that it was in fact a detached eclipsing double white dwarf binary , making it only the second known after nltt 11748 @xcite , but in this case the secondary star contributes 22% of the overall flux ( compared to 3% in nltt 11748 ) .",
    "follow up spectroscopy revealed that css 41177 was also a double - lined spectroscopic binary .    here",
    "we present liverpool telescope ( lt)+rise photometry and gemini+gmos spectroscopy of css 41177 , and use these observations , and mass - radius relations , to determine the system parameters .",
    "we also discuss the evolution and eventual fate of the binary .",
    "three primary eclipses and two secondary eclipses of css 41177 were observed using the lt and rise @xcite between february and april 2011 .",
    "rise is a high - speed frame transfer ccd camera with a single wideband v+r filter @xcite .",
    "all observations were made in @xmath6 binning mode , giving a scale of 1.1 arcsec per pixel , and with exposure times of 12 - 13 seconds .",
    "the raw data are automatically run through a pipeline that debiases , removes a scaled dark frame and flat - fields the data .",
    "the source flux was determined with aperture photometry using a variable aperture , whereby the radius of the aperture is scaled according to the fwhm , using the ultracam pipeline @xcite .",
    "variations in observing conditions were accounted for by determining the flux relative to the nearby star g 54 - 11 ( v=14.6 ) .",
    "css 41177 was observed using gmos on the 8 m gemini observatory north telescope @xcite on 15 march 2011 .",
    "we used the r831 grating with a 0.5 arcsec slit and @xmath7 binning ( spatial by spectral ) to give a resolution of @xmath8 centered at h@xmath2 .",
    "we used an exposure time of 10 minutes , recording 17 spectra covering an entire orbit .",
    "the average bias and flat - field correction was carried out using the figaro package from starlink and nightly bias and tungsten frames .",
    "we optimally extracted each spectrum @xcite and used a cuar arc lamp to establish an accurate wavelength scale .",
    "the arc spectrum was fitted with a fifth - order polynomial to 15 lines which gave an rms of 0.05 pixel .",
    "the individual spectra were normalised to the continuum level using a polynomial fit to the continuum regions and the spectra were placed onto a heliocentric wavelength scale .",
    "the left hand panel of figure  [ risefit ] shows the lt+rise photometry of css 41177 folded on its 2.78 hour orbital period and binned by a factor of two .",
    "since both eclipses are detected , the light curve information alone constrains the system inclination and the radii scaled by the binary separation .    to measure the system parameters we fitted the light curve using a code written to produce models for the general case of binaries containing a white dwarf ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the program subdivides each star into small elements with a geometry fixed by its radius as measured along the direction of centres towards the other star . from an initial set of parameters defined by the user , the code produces model light curves which are initially fitted to the rise data using markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) minimisation to produce a set of covariances .",
    "we then ran another mcmc minimisation using these covariances to define the parameter jumps . to produce the final parameters and their errors we followed the procedures described in @xcite .",
    "the parameters needed to define the model were : the mass ratio , @xmath9 , the inclination , @xmath10 , the radii scaled by the binary separation , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , the surface brightness ratio , @xmath13 , quadratic limb darkening coefficients for the both white dwarfs , the time of mid eclipse , @xmath14 and the period , @xmath15 .",

    "the zero - point of the ephemeris and the period were allowed to vary in our final fit .",
    "we kept the mass ratio fixed as 1.0 ( the light curves of this well - detached system are independent of the mass ratio ) .",
    "we determined the quadratic limb darkening coefficients from a pair of white dwarf atmosphere models with temperatures of 21,100k and 10,500k and @xmath16 ( see section  [ temps ] ) folded through the rise filter profile @xcite .",
    "we determined coefficients of a = 0.105 and b = 0.228 for the primary and a = 0.176 and b = 0.288 for the secondary for @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the cosine of the angle between the line of sight and the surface normal ; we kept these values fixed .",

    "initially , we fitted its sdss spectrum as a single white dwarf using the models of @xcite , which results in a @xmath21k and @xmath22 . to determine the temperature of both stars better , we fitted the sdss @xmath23 magnitudes with a composite of two da white dwarf models , with the additional constraint of the surface brightness ratio @xmath24 in the lt / rise band , as measured from the light curve .",

    "we fitted the line using a combination of a straight line plus a gaussian .",
    "however , the radial velocity measured does not represent the true radial velocity of the primary star as the absorption from the secondary star causes a slight underestimation . nevertheless , we used these velocities to correct out the motion of the primary star .",
    "we then averaged the shifted spectra to obtain the rest - frame spectrum of the primary star which we then subtracted from all the observed spectra .",
    "the result is shown in the right hand panel of figure  [ trail ] , clearly showing the absorption from the secondary star .",
    "we fitted the absorption from the secondary star in the same way as the primary star .",
    "this too underestimated the true velocity since the primary star s contribution had not been completely removed .",
    "however , both fits provide us with an initial starting point for @xmath27 and @xmath28 , the radial velocity amplitudes of both stars . in order to measure accurate radial velocities",
    "both absorption components need to be fitted simultaneously .",
    "we fit both lines together by simultaneously fitting all of the spectra .",
    "we used a combination of a straight line and gaussians for each spectrum ( including a broad gaussian component to account for the wings of the primary star s absorption ) and allowed the position of the gaussians to change velocity according to @xmath29 for each star , where @xmath30 is the offset in the line from its rest wavelength and @xmath31 is the orbital phase of the spectrum . due to the faintness of the secondary star s absorption we keep the offset @xmath32 to reduce the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "all other parameters were initially set to those measured from fitting the lines individually .",
    "we fitted the data using levenberg - marquardt minimisation @xcite .",
    "the resultant fit had a reduced @xmath33 of 1.02 .",
    "we find @xmath34 km@xmath35s@xmath36 , @xmath37 km@xmath35s@xmath36 and @xmath38 km@xmath35s@xmath36 .",
