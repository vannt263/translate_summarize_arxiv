    "the galaxy two - point correlation function , @xmath12 , is a fundamental statistic of the galaxy distribution , and is relatively straightforward to calculate from observational data . since the clustering of galaxies is determined by the initial mass fluctuations and their evolution , measurements of @xmath12 set constraints on the initial mass fluctuations and their evolution .",
    "the astrophysics of galaxy formation introduces uncertainties , but there is now good evidence that galaxies do trace the underlying mass distribution on large scales .    in this paper",
    "we analyse the distribution of @xmath24 220000 galaxies in the 2-degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs , colless  2001 ) .",
    "a brief summary of the data is presented in section 2 .",
    "much of our error analysis makes use of mock galaxy catalogues generated from @xmath25-body simulations which are also discussed in section 2 .    the two - dimensional measurement @xmath0 , where @xmath26 is the pair separation perpendicular to the line - of - sight and @xmath27 is the pair separation parallel to the line - of - sight provides information about the real - space correlation function , the small - scale velocity distribution , and the systematic gravitational infall into overdense regions .",
    "the spherical average of @xmath0 gives an estimate of the redshift - space correlation function , @xmath4 , where @xmath28 , so the galaxy separations are calculated assuming that redshift gives a direct measure of distance , ignoring the effects of peculiar velocities . integrating @xmath0 along the line - of - sight sums over any peculiar velocity distributions , and",
    "so is unaffected by any redshift - space effects .",
    "the resulting projected correlation function , @xmath6 , is directly related to the real - space correlation function .",
    "our estimates of @xmath0 , @xmath4 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are presented in section 3 .",
    "these statistics have been measured from many smaller redshift surveys ( davis & peebles 1983 ; loveday  1992 ; jing , mo & brner  1998 ; hawkins  2001 ; zehavi  2002 ) , but since they sample smaller volumes , there is a large cosmic variance on the results .",
    "the large volume sampled by the 2dfgrs leads to significantly more reliable estimates .",
    "a preliminary analysis was performed on the 2dfgrs by peacock  ( 2001 ) but we now have a far more uniform sample and twice as many galaxies .",
    "madgwick  ( 2003 ) have measured these statistics for spectral - type sub - samples of the 2dfgrs .",
    "peculiar velocities of galaxies lead to systematic differences between redshift - space and real - space measurements , and we can consider the effects in terms of a combination of large - scale coherent flows induced by the gravity of large - scale structures , and a small - scale random peculiar velocity of each galaxy ( e.g. marzke  1995 ; jing  1998 ) .",
    "the large - scale flows compress the contours of @xmath0 along the @xmath27 direction , as described by kaiser ( 1987 ) and hamilton ( 1992 ) .",
    "the amplitude of the distortion depends on the mean density of the universe , @xmath29 , and on how the mass distribution is clustered relative to galaxies , which can be parameterized in terms of a linear bias @xmath30 , defined so that @xmath31 , where @xmath32 represents fluctuations in the density field .",
    "the random component of peculiar velocity for each galaxy means that the observed @xmath0 is convolved in the @xmath27 coordinate with the pairwise distribution of random velocities . in section 4",
    "we describe the construction of a model @xmath0 from these assumptions about redshift - space distortions and also the shape of the correlation function .",
    "in section 5 we use the @xmath33 statistic ( hamilton 1992 ) based on the quadrupole moment of @xmath0 to estimate the parameter @xmath34 . in the absence of the small - scale random velocities the shape of @xmath0 contours on large scales",
    "is directly related to the parameter @xmath15 .",
    "a similar estimate of @xmath15 is provided by the ratio of amplitudes of @xmath4 to @xmath7 and this is also presented in section 5 .",
    "in section 6 , we use the landy , szalay & broadhurst ( 1998 ) method to estimate the distribution of peculiar velocities .",
    "this technique ignores the effect of large - scale distortions and uses the fourier transform of @xmath0 to estimate the distribution of peculiar velocities , @xmath17 .",
    "the large sample volume of the 2dfgrs makes our measurements more reliable than previous estimates in the same way as for the correlation functions mentioned earlier .",
    "these two approaches provide reasonable estimates of @xmath15 and @xmath17 so long as the distortions at small and large scales are completely decoupled .",
    "this is not the case for real data , and so we have fitted models which simultaneously include the effects of both @xmath15 and @xmath17 .",
    "the resulting best - fit parameters are the most self consistent estimates .",
    "previous data - sets have lacked the signal - to - noise to allow a reliable multi - parameter fit in this way .",
    "our fitting procedure and results are described in section 7 .    in section 8",
    ", we examine the luminosity and redshift dependence of @xmath15 and combine our results with estimates of @xmath30 ( verde  2002 ; lahav  2002 ) to estimate @xmath29 , and compare this with other recent analyses .    in section 9 ,",
    "we summarise our main conclusions .",
    "when converting from redshift to distance we assume the universe has a flat geometry with @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , so that all scales are in units of @xmath38 .",
    "the 2dfgrs is selected in the photometric @xmath39  band from the apm galaxy survey ( maddox , efstathiou & sutherland 1990 ) and its subsequent extensions ( maddox , in preparation ) .",
    "the bulk of the solid angle of the survey is made up of two broad strips , one in the south galactic pole region ( sgp ) covering approximately @xmath40 , @xmath41 and the other in the direction of the north galactic pole ( ngp ) , spanning @xmath42 , @xmath43 .",
    "in addition to these contiguous regions , there are a number of circular 2-degree fields scattered randomly over the full extent of the low extinction regions of the southern apm galaxy survey .",
    "the magnitude limit at the start of the survey was set at @xmath44 but both the photometry of the input catalogue and the dust extinction map have been revised since and so there are small variations in magnitude limit as a function of position over the sky .",
    "the effective median magnitude limit , over the area of the survey , is @xmath45 ( colless  2001 ) .",
    "the completeness of the survey data varies according to the position on the sky because of unobserved fields ( mostly around the survey edges ) , un - fibred objects in observed fields ( due to collision constraints or broken fibres ) and observed objects with poor spectra .",
    "the variation in completeness is mapped out using a completeness mask ( colless  2001 ; norberg  2002a ) which is shown in fig .",
    "[ f : masks ] for the data used in this paper .",
    "we use the data obtained prior to may 2002 , which is virtually the completed survey .",
    "this includes 221283 unique , reliable galaxy redshifts ( quality flag @xmath46 3 , colless  2001 ) .",
    "we analyse a magnitude - limited sample with redshift limits @xmath47 and @xmath48 , and no redshifts are used from a field with @xmath49 completeness .",
    "the median redshift is @xmath50 .",
    "the random fields , which contain nearly 25000 reliable redshifts are not included in this analysis . after the cuts for redshift , completeness and quality we are left with 165659 galaxies in total , 95929 in the sgp and 69730 in the ngp .",
    "these data cover an area , weighted by the completeness shown in fig .",
    "[ f : masks ] , of @xmath51 in the sgp and @xmath52 in the ngp , to the magnitude limit of the survey .    in all of the following analysis we consider the ngp and sgp as independent data sets . treating the ngp and sgp as two independent regions of the sky gives two estimates for each statistic , and so provides a good test of the error bars we derive from mock catalogues ( see below ) .",
    "we have also combined the two measurements to produce our overall best estimate by simply adding the pair counts from the ngp and sgp .",
    "the optimal weighting of the two estimates depends on the relative volumes surveyed in the ngp and sgp , but since these are comparable , a simple sum is close to the optimal combination .",
    "it is important to estimate the effective redshift at which all our statistics are calculated .",
    "as @xmath12 is based on counting pairs of galaxies the effective redshift is not the median , but a pair - weighted measure .",
    "the tail of high redshift galaxies pushes this effective redshift to @xmath2 .",
    "similarly the effective magnitude of the sample we analyse is @xmath53 , corresponding to @xmath54 ( using @xmath55 , norberg  2002a ) .      for each of the ngp and sgp regions , 22 mock catalogues were generated from the @xmath13 hubble volume simulation ( evrard  2002 ) using the techniques described in cole  ( 1998 ) , and are designed to have a similar clustering signal to the 2dfgrs .",
    "a summary of the construction methods is presented here but for more details see norberg  ( 2002a ) and baugh  ( in preparation ) .",
    "these simulations used an initial dark matter power spectrum appropriate to a flat @xmath13 model with @xmath36 and @xmath56 .",
    "the dark - matter evolution was followed up to the present day and then a bias scheme ( model 2 of cole  1998 , with a smoothing length , @xmath57 ) was used to identify galaxies from the dark matter haloes .",
    "the bias scheme used has two free parameters which are adjusted to match the mean slope and amplitude of the correlation function on scales greater than a few megaparsec . on scales smaller than the smoothing length",
    "there is little control over the form of the clustering , but in reality the methods employed work reasonably well ( see later sections ) .",
    "the resulting catalogues have a bias scheme which asymptotes to a constant on large scales , giving @xmath58 , but is scale dependent on small scales .",
    "apparent magnitudes were assigned to the galaxies consistent with their redshift , the assumed schechter luminosity function and the magnitude limit of the survey .",
    "the schechter function has essentially the same parameters as in the real data ( see norberg  2002a ) .",
    "then the completeness mask and variable apparent magnitude limits were applied to the mock catalogues to reproduce catalogues similar to the real data .    in the analysis which follows",
    ", we make use of the real- and redshift - space correlation functions from the full hubble volume simulation .",
    "these correlation functions are determined from a fourier transform of the power spectrum of the full hubble volume cube using the real- and redshift - space positions of the mass particles respectively , along with the bias scheme outlined above .",
    "this allows us to compare our mock catalogue results with that of the simulation from which they are drawn to ensure we can reproduce the correct parameters .",
    "it also allows us to compare and contrast the results from the real universe with a large numerical simulation .",
    "we analyse each of the mock catalogues in the same way as the real data , so that we have 22 mock measurements for every measurement that we make on the real data .",
    "the standard deviation between the 22 mock measurements gives a robust estimate of the uncertainty on the real data .",
    "we use this approach to estimate the uncertainties for direct measurements from the data , such as the individual points in the correlation function , and for best - fit parameters such as @xmath59 .    when fitting parameters we use this standard deviation as a weight for each data - point and perform a minimum @xmath60 analysis to obtain the best - fit parameter .",
    "the errors that we quote for any particular parameter are the rms spread between the 22 best - fit parameters obtained in the same way from the mock catalogues .",
    "this simple way of estimating the uncertainties avoids the complications of dealing directly with correlated errors in measured data points , while still providing an unbiased estimate of the real uncertainties in the data , including the effects of correlated errors .",
    "although this approach gives reliable estimates of the uncertainties , the simple weighting scheme is not necessarily optimal in the presence of correlated errors .",
    "nevertheless , for all statistics that we consider , we find that the means of the mock estimates agree well with the values input to the parent simulations . also , we have applied the technique described by madgwick  ( 2003 ) to de - correlate the errors for the projected correlation function , using the covariance matrix estimated from the mock catalogues .",
    "we found a @xmath61 difference between the best - fit values using the two methods .",
    "so , we are confident that our measurements and uncertainty estimates are robust and unbiased .",
    "the two point correlation function , @xmath12 , is measured by comparing the actual galaxy distribution to a catalogue of randomly distributed galaxies .",
    "these randomly distributed galaxies are subject to the same redshift , magnitude and mask constraints as the real data and we modulate the surface density of points in the random catalogue to follow the completeness variations .",
    "we count the pairs in bins of separation along the line - of - sight , @xmath27 , and across the line - of - sight , @xmath26 , to estimate @xmath0 .",
    "spherically averaging these pair counts provides the redshift - space correlation function @xmath4 . finally , we estimate the projected function @xmath6 by integrating over all velocity separations along the line - of - sight and invert it to obtain @xmath7 .      to reduce shot noise we compare the data with a random catalogue containing ten times as many points as the real catalogue .",
    "this random catalogue needs to have a smooth selection function matching the @xmath62 of the real data .",
    "we use the 2dfgrs luminosity function ( norberg  2002a ) with @xmath63 and @xmath64 to generate the selection function , following the change in the survey magnitude limit across the sky .",
    "when analysing the mock catalogues , we use the input luminosity function to generate the selection function , and hence random catalogues .    as an alternative method , we also fitted an analytic form for the selection function ( baugh & efstathiou 1993 ) to the data , and generated random catalogues using that selection function .",
    "we have calculated all of our statistics using both approaches , and found that they gave essentially identical results for the data .",
    "when analysing the mock catalogues , we found that the luminosity function method was more robust to the presence of large - scale features in the @xmath62 data .",
    "thus , all of our quoted results are based on random catalogues generated using the luminosity function .",
    "the design of the 2df instrument means that fibres can not be placed closer than approximately 30 arcsec ( lewis  2002 ) , and so both members of a close pair of galaxies can not be targeted in a single fibre configuration .",
    "fortunately , the arrangement of 2dfgrs tiles means that not all close pairs are lost from the survey .",
    "neighbouring tiles have significant areas of overlap , and so much of the sky is targeted more than once .",
    "this allows us to target both galaxies in some close pairs .",
    "nevertheless , the survey misses a large fraction of close pairs .",
    "it is important to assess the impact of this omission on the measurement of galaxy clustering and to investigate schemes that can compensate for the loss of close pairs .    to quantify the effect of these so - called ` fibre collisions ' we have calculated the angular correlation function for galaxies in the 2dfgrs parent catalogue , @xmath65 , and for galaxies with redshifts used in our @xmath12 analysis , @xmath66 .",
    "we used the same mask to determine the angular selection and apparent magnitude limit for each sample as in fig .",
    "[ f : masks ] .",
    "note that the mask is used only to define the area of analysis , and the actual redshift completeness values are not used in the calculation of @xmath67 . in our @xmath12 analyses we impose redshift limits @xmath68 , which means that the mean redshift of the redshift sample is lower than the parent sample .",
    "we used limber s equation ( limber 1954 ) to calculate the scale factors in amplitude and angular scale needed to account for the different redshift distributions .",
    "the solid line in fig .",
    "[ f : ang ] shows @xmath69 , and the filled circles show @xmath70 after applying the limber scale factors .",
    "the error bars in fig .",
    "[ f : ang ] show @xmath71 from the full apm survey ( maddox , efstathiou & sutherland 1996 ) , also scaled to the magnitude limit of the 2dfgrs parent sample . on scales",
    "@xmath72 all three measurements are consistent . on smaller scales",
    "@xmath70 is clearly much lower than @xmath69 , showing that the fibre collision effect becomes significant and can not be neglected .",
    "the ratio of galaxy pairs counted in the parent and redshift samples is given by @xmath73 , which is shown by the filled circles in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ f : ang ] .",
    "as discussed in the next section , we use this ratio to correct the pair counts in the @xmath12 analysis .      each galaxy and random galaxy",
    "is given a weighting factor depending on its redshift and position on the sky .",
    "the redshift dependent part of the weight is designed to minimize the variance on the estimated @xmath12 ( efstathiou 1988 ; loveday  1995 ) , and is given by @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the density distribution and @xmath76 .",
    "we use @xmath75 from the random catalogue to ensure that the weights vary smoothly with redshift .",
    "we find that our results are insensitive to the precise form of @xmath77 but we derived it using a power law @xmath12 with @xmath78 and @xmath79 and a maximum value of @xmath80 .",
    "this corresponds to the best - fit power law over the range @xmath81 with a cutoff at larger scales .",
    "we also use the weighting scheme to correct for the galaxies that are not observed due to the fibre collisions .",
    "each galaxy - galaxy pair is weighted by the ratio @xmath82 at the relevant angular separation according to the curve plotted in the bottom panel of fig.[f : ang ] .",
    "this corrects the observed pair count to what would have been counted in the parent catalogue .",
    "the open points in fig .",
    "[ f : ang ] , which have the collision correction applied , show that this method can correctly recover the parent catalogue result and hence overcome the fibre collision problem .",
    "since the random catalogues do not have any close - pair constraints , only the galaxy - galaxy pair count needs correcting in this way .",
    "we also tried an alternative approach to the fibre - collision correction that we used previously in norberg  ( 2001 , 2002b ) where the weight for each unobserved galaxy was assigned equally to its ten nearest neighbours .",
    "this produced similar results for @xmath83 , but did not help on smaller scales .",
    "all of our results are presented using the @xmath84 weighting scheme .",
    "hence each galaxy , @xmath85 , is weighted by the factor , @xmath86 and each galaxy - galaxy pair @xmath85,@xmath87 is given a weight @xmath88 , whereas each galaxy - random and random - random pair is given a weight @xmath89 .",
    "we use the @xmath12 estimator of landy & szalay ( 1993 ) , @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the normalised sum of weights of galaxy - galaxy pairs with particular @xmath92 separation , @xmath93 the normalised sum of weights of random - random pairs with the same separation in the random catalogue and @xmath94 the normalised sum of weights of galaxy - random pairs with the same separation . to normalise the pair counts we ensure that the sum of weights of the random catalogue equal the sum of weights of the real galaxy catalogue , as a function of scale .",
    "we find that other estimators ( hamilton 1993 ) give similar results .    the @xmath62 distributions for the data and random catalogues ( scaled so that the area under the curve is the same as for the observed data ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ f : nzs ] .",
    "it is clear that @xmath62 for the random catalogues are a reasonably smooth fit to @xmath62 for the data .",
    "norberg  ( 2002a ) showed that large ` spikes ' in the @xmath62 are common in the mock catalogues , and so similar features in the data redshift distributions indicate normal structure .",
    "the resulting estimates of @xmath0 calculated separately for the sgp and ngp catalogues are shown in fig .",
    "[ f : sigpi ] , along with the combined result .",
    "the velocity distortions are clear at both small and large scales , and the signal - to - noise ratio is in general very high for @xmath26 and @xmath27 values less than @xmath95 ; it is @xmath96 in each @xmath97 bin at @xmath98 . at very large separations @xmath0 becomes very close to zero , showing no evidence for features that could be attributed to systematic photometric errors .",
    "we used an earlier version of the 2dfgrs catalogue to carry out a less detailed analysis of @xmath0 ( peacock  2001 ) .",
    "the current redshift sample has about 1.4 times as many galaxies , though more importantly it is more contiguous , and the revised photometry has improved the uniformity of the sample .",
    "nevertheless our new results are very similar to our earlier analysis , demonstrating the robustness of our results .",
    "the current larger sample allows us to trace @xmath12 out to larger scales with smaller uncertainties . also , in our present analysis we analyse mock catalogues to obtain error estimates which are more precise than the previous error approximation ( see section[s : john ] ) .",
    "averaging @xmath0 at constant @xmath99 gives the redshift - space correlation function , and our results for the ngp and sgp are plotted in fig.[f : redxi ] on both log and linear scales .",
    "the ngp and sgp measurements differ by about @xmath100 between @xmath101 and @xmath102 , and we find one mock whose ngp and sgp measurements disagree by this much , and so it is probably not significant .",
    "we tried shifting @xmath103 by @xmath104mag to better fit the @xmath62 at @xmath105 in the sgp , and this moved the data points by @xmath106 for @xmath107 .",
    "the redshift - space correlation function for the combined data is plotted in fig .",
    "[ f : redxi2 ] in the top panel .",
    "it is clear that the measured @xmath4 is not at all well represented by a universal power law on all scales , but we do make an estimate of the true value of the redshift - space correlation length , @xmath59 , by fitting a localised power - law of the form , @xmath108 using a least - squares fit to @xmath109 as a function of @xmath110 , using two points either side of @xmath111 .",
    "this also gives a value for the local redshift - space slope , @xmath112 .",

    "the points are the data divided by a small scale power law fitted on scales @xmath115 ( dashed line ) .",
    "the data are remarkably close to the power - law fit for this limited range of scales , and follow a smooth break towards zero for @xmath116 .",
    "the measurements from the hubble volume simulation are shown by the solid line , and it matches the data extremely well on scales @xmath117 . on smaller scales , where the algorithm for placing galaxies in the simulation has little control over",
    "the clustering amplitude ( as discussed in section  [ s : mocks ] ) , there are discrepancies of order @xmath118 .",
    "the mean @xmath4 determined from the mock catalogues agrees well with the true redshift - space correlation function from the full hubble volume .",
    "this provides a good check that our weighting scheme and random catalogues have not introduced any biases in the analysis .",
    "redshift - space correlation functions have been measured from many redshift surveys , but direct comparisons between different surveys are not straightforward because galaxy clustering depends on the spectral type and luminosity of galaxies ( guzzo  2000 ; norberg  2002b ; madgwick  2003 ) .",
    "direct comparisons can be made only between surveys that are based on similar galaxy selection criteria .",
    "the 2dfgrs is selected using pseudo - total magnitudes in the @xmath39 band , and the three most similar surveys are the stromlo - apm survey ( sapm , loveday  1992 ) , the durham ukst survey ( ratcliffe  1998 ) and the eso slice project ( esp , guzzo  2000 ) .",
    "the las campanas redshift survey ( lcrs , lin  1996 , jing  1998 ) and sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , zehavi  2002 ) are selected in the @xmath119 band , but have a very large number of galaxies , and so are also interesting for comparisons .",

    "this difference is likely to be caused by the different galaxy selection for the surveys , though the sdss results shown are for the early data release ( edr ) and have larger errors than the 2dfgrs points .",

    "galaxies are more strongly clustered than blue ( late type ) galaxies ( zehavi  2002 ; and via spectral type , norberg  2002b ) , we should expect that @xmath12 will be higher for red selected surveys than a blue selected survey .",
    "this issue is examined further in madgwick  ( 2003 ) .",
    "the redshift - space correlation function differs significantly from the real - space correlation function because of redshift - space distortions ( see section 4 ) .",

    "it is worth contrasting our present results with those obtained in a previous 2dfgrs analysis ( peacock et al .",
    "this was based on the data available up to the end of 2000 : a total of 141402 redshifts .",

    "the present analysis uses 165659 galaxies , but to a maximum redshift of 0.2 . because galaxies are given a redshift - dependent weight , this difference in redshift limit has a substantial effect on the volume sampled . for a given area of sky , changing the redshift limit from @xmath283 to @xmath281 changes the total number of galaxies by a factor of only 1.08 , whereas the total comoving volume within @xmath284 increases by a factor of 2 . allowing for the redshift - dependent weight used in practice , the difference in effective comoving volume for a given area of sky due to the variation in redshift limits becomes a factor of 1.6 .",
    "since the effective area covered by the present data is greater by a factor of @xmath285 , the total effective comoving volume probed in the current analysis is in fact 15% smaller than in the 2001 analysis ; this would suggest random errors on clustering statistics about 7% larger than previously .",
    "of course , the lower redshift limit has several important advantages : uncertainties in the selection function in the tail of the luminosity function are not an issue ( see norberg et al .",
    "2002a ) ; also , the mean epoch of measurement is closer to @xmath286 . given that the sky coverage is now more uniform , and that the survey mask and selection function have been studied in greater detail , the present results should be much more robust .",
    "the other main difference between the present work and that of peacock  ( 2001 ) lies in the method of analysis .",
    "the earlier work quantified the flattening of the contours of @xmath282 via the quadrupole - to - monopole ratio , @xmath287 .",
    "this is not to be confused with the quantity @xmath288 from section  [ s : q ] , which uses an integrated clustering measure instead of @xmath289 .",
    "this is inevitably more noisy , as reflected in the error bar , @xmath290 , resulting from that method .",

    "2001 ) , this was assumed to be known from the de - projection of angular clustering in the apm survey ( baugh & efstathiou 1993 ) ; in the present paper we have made a detailed internal estimate of @xmath291 , and considered the effect of uncertainties in this quantity .",
    "apart from this difference , the previous method of fitting to @xmath287 should , in principle , give results that are similar to our full fit to @xmath282 in section  [ s : fits ] .",
    "the key issue in both cases is the treatment of the errors , which are estimated in a fully realistic fashion in the present paper using mock samples .",
    "the previous analysis used two simpler methods : an empirical error on @xmath287 was deduced from the ngp  sgp difference , and correlated data were allowed for by estimating the true number of degrees of freedom from the value of @xmath60 for the best - fit model .",
    "this estimate was compared with a covariance matrix built from multiple realizations of @xmath282 using gaussian fields ; consistent errors were obtained .",
    "we applied the simple method of peacock  ( 2001 ) to the current data , keeping the assumed apm @xmath291 , and obtained the marginalized result @xmath292 .",
    "the comparison with our best estimate of @xmath293 indicates that the systematic errors in the previous analysis ( from e.g. the assumed @xmath294 $ ] ) were not important , but that the previous error bars were optimistic by about 20% .",

    "the dashed line is from peacock & smith ( 2000 ) who used the halo model to predict the peculiar velocities for the galaxy distribution .",
    "kauffmann  ( 1999 ) and benson  ( 2000 ) used the gif simulations combined with semi - analytic models of galaxy formation and the galaxy predictions of benson  ( 2000 ) are shown by the dotted line .",
    "these predictions generally assume @xmath295 , but there is evidence that @xmath296 could be @xmath297 lower than this ( spergel  2003 ) and so the pairwise velocity dispersions implied would also be lower .",
    "observationally , jing  ( 1998 ) measured the pairwise velocity dispersion in the las campanas redshift survey and found no significant variation with scale .",
    "we note again that the errors for the lcrs ignore the effects of cosmic variance and are likely to be underestimates .",
    "zehavi  ( 2002 ) used the sdss data and found that @xmath18 decreased with scale for @xmath298 .",
    "these observations are plotted in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ f : va ] .",
    "all these observations have assumed a functional form for the infall velocities ( or ` streaming ' ) and not used @xmath15 directly .",
    "we have already shown that proper consideration of the infall parameter is vital in such studies .",
    "indeed , zehavi  ( 2002 ) say that their estimates of @xmath18 for @xmath299 depend significantly on their choice of streaming model .",
    "this factor , along with a dependence of @xmath18 on luminosity and galaxy type may help to explain the differences between the 2dfgrs and sdss results .",
    "the difference in results from section  [ s : vfv ] which measured the value of @xmath18 at small @xmath26 ( @xmath300 ) , and from using the @xmath0 grid ( @xmath301 ) , which measures an average value , hints that there may be such an dependence of @xmath18 on @xmath26 in the 2dfgrs data .",
    "we test for variations in @xmath18 by repeating the fits described in section[s : fits ] using a global @xmath302 and @xmath151 but allowing @xmath18 to vary in each @xmath26 slice .",
    "the results are shown in fig.[f : va ] , compared with the results from other surveys , and numerical simulations as discussed above .",
    "the value of @xmath301 obtained from the 2-d fit for scales @xmath303 is close to the value at @xmath304 where most of the signal is coming from .",
    "the value of @xmath300 obtained from the fourier transform technique agrees well with the results found for @xmath305 .",
    "the values of @xmath306 and @xmath151 are essentially unchanged when fitting in this way . we note again that the effects of the infall must be properly taken into account in these measurements .",
    "we also note that we used our linear , power - law model on all scales , but we have seen that this is a reasonable approximation on non - linear scales .",
    "we see that the overall shape of the 2dfgrs results are fairly consistent with , though slightly flatter than the semi - analytic predictions , but the amplitude is certainly a little different , which could be due to the value of @xmath296 used in the models , as discussed above .",
    "we also plot the mean of the mock catalogue results ( solid line ) , and the results of a simulated catalogue ( dashed line ) of yang  ( 2003 , with @xmath307 ) and these match the real data well .",
    "we take the value of @xmath15 measured from the multi - parameter best fit to @xmath0 , @xmath309 which is measured at the effective luminosity , @xmath310 , and redshift , @xmath311 , of our survey sample . in section  [ s:2dfdata ]",
    "we quoted these values , which are the applicable mean values when using the @xmath77 weighting and redshift cuts employed , as @xmath312 and @xmath2 .",
    "we also note here that if we adopt an @xmath313 geometry we find that @xmath314 , within the quoted 1@xmath26 errors .",
    "the redshift distortion parameter can be written as , @xmath315 where @xmath316 , and @xmath317 is the linear fluctuation growth factor and @xmath18 is the expansion factor . a good approximation for @xmath318 , at all @xmath319 , in a flat universe ,",
    "was given by lahav  ( 1991 ) , @xmath320 and so to constrain @xmath29 from these results we need an estimate of @xmath30 .",
    "there have been two recent papers describing such measurements .",
    "verde  ( 2002 ) measured @xmath321 from an analysis of the bispectrum of 2dfgrs galaxies .",
    "their results depend strongly on the pairwise peculiar velocity dispersion , @xmath18 , assumed in their analysis .",
    "they used the result of peacock  ( 2001 ) , who found @xmath322 , somewhat lower than our new value of @xmath323 . to derive @xmath29 using these results would not therefore be consistent and so a new bispectrum analysis is in preparation .",
    "lahav  ( 2002 ) combined the estimate of the 2df power spectrum , @xmath324 ( percival  2001 ) , with pre-_wmap _ results from the cmb to obtain an estimate of @xmath30 , but this value is also dependent on @xmath29 .",
    "their likelihood contours , the optical depth of reionisation , as @xmath325 . the plotted results do not include this effect , which could be significant , and this is discussed further in section  [ s : omcomp ] . ]",
    "are reproduced in fig.[f : omvb ] , as the dashed lines .",
    "they also introduced a ` constant galaxy clustering ' model for the evolution of @xmath30 with @xmath319 . following these equations",
    "we can evolve our measured @xmath15 to the present day and estimate @xmath326 and these contours are shown by the solid lines in fig.[f : omvb ] .",
    "these are in good agreement with , and orthogonal to , those of lahav  ( 2002 ) .",
    "we note that the above analysis is independent of luminosity as we examine everything at the effective luminosity of the survey , @xmath310 . from the correlation functions in different volume - limited samples of 2dfgrs galaxies ,",
    "norberg  ( 2001 ) found a luminosity dependence of clustering of the form ( cf .",
    "[ e : r0star ] ) , @xmath327 which gives an estimate for the bias of the survey galaxies , @xmath328 ( using @xmath166 ) , where @xmath329 is the bias of @xmath330 galaxies .",
    "if this bias relation holds on the scales considered in this paper then @xmath15 will be increased by the same factor of 1.06 , @xmath331 and evolving @xmath15 in a ` constant galaxy clustering ' model ( lahav  2002 ) then , @xmath332 which we choose as a fiducial point to allow comparisons with other surveys with different effective luminosities and redshifts .",
    "lahav  ( 2002 ) obtained , @xmath333 , in their combined 2dfgrs and cmb analysis , completely consistent with the our result .",
    "percival  ( 2002 ) combined the 2dfgrs power spectrum with the pre-_wmap _ cmb data , assuming a flat cosmology and found @xmath334 .",
    "these measurements of @xmath29 are also consistent with a different estimation from the 2dfgrs and cmb ( efstathiou  2002 ) and from combining the 2dfgrs with cosmic shear measurements ( brown  2003 ) .",
    "also plotted in figure  [ f : omvb ] is the recent result from the analysis of the _ wmap _ satellite data .",
    "spergel  ( 2003 ) found @xmath335 using _ wmap _ data alone , although there are degeneracies with other parameters .",
    "it is clear that this is completely consistent with the other plotted contours .",
    "spergel  ( 2003 ) also found that the epoch of reionisation , @xmath336 , which would reduce the value of @xmath30 found by lahav  ( 2002 ) by about @xmath337 , still in good agreement with the results in this paper .",
    "in this paper we have measured the correlation function , and various related quantities using 2dfgrs galaxies .",
    "our main results are summarised as follows :    1 .",
    "the spherical average of @xmath0 gives the redshift - space correlation function , @xmath4 , from which we measure the redshift space clustering length , @xmath5 . at large and small scales",
    "@xmath4 drops below a power law as expected , for instance , in the @xmath13 model .",
    "2 .   the projection of @xmath0 along the @xmath27 axis gives an estimate of the real - space correlation function , @xmath7 , which on scales @xmath338 can be fit by a power - law @xmath8 with @xmath339 , @xmath340 . at large scales",
    ", @xmath7 drops below a power - law as expected , for instance , in the @xmath13 model .",
    "the ratio of real and redshift - space correlation functions on scales of @xmath14 reflects systematic infall velocities and leads to an estimate of @xmath188 .",
    "the quadrupole moment of @xmath0 on large scales gives @xmath195 .",
    "4 .   comparing the projections of @xmath0 along the @xmath27 and @xmath26 axes gives an estimate of the distribution of random pairwise peculiar velocities , @xmath17 .",
    "we find that large - scale infall velocities affect the measurement of the distribution significantly and can not be neglected .",
    "using @xmath341 , we find that @xmath17 is well fit by an exponential with pairwise velocity dispersion , @xmath342 , at small @xmath26 .",
    "a multi - parameter fit to @xmath0 simultaneously constrains the shape and amplitude of @xmath7 and both the velocity distortion effects parameterized by @xmath15 and @xmath18 .",
    "we find @xmath239 and @xmath20 , using the hubble volume @xmath7 as input to the model .",
    "these results apply to galaxies with effective luminosity , @xmath343 and at an effective redshift , @xmath344 .",
    "we also find that the best fit values of @xmath15 and @xmath18 are strongly correlated .",
    "we evolve our value for the infall parameter to the present day and critical luminosity and find @xmath345 .",
    "our derived constraints on @xmath29 and @xmath30 are consistent with a range of other recent analyses .",
    "our results show that the clustering of 2dfgrs galaxies as a whole is well matched by a low density @xmath13 simulation with a non - linear local bias scheme based on the smoothed dark - matter density field .",
    "nevertheless , there are features of the galaxy distribution which require more sophisticated models , for example the distribution of pairwise velocities and the dependence of galaxy clustering on luminosity or spectral type .",
    "the methods presented have also been used on sub - samples of the 2dfgrs , split by their spectral type ( madgwick  2003 ) .",
    "the 2df galaxy redshift survey has been made possible through the dedicated efforts of the staff of the anglo - australian observatory , both in creating the 2df instrument and in supporting it on the telescope .",
