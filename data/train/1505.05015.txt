    "the modern advanced technologies , and its resulting end use for improved and novel products , create a stress on the basic sciences of physics and chemistry .",
    "this is a result of trying to mantain a balance in the triade st&i ( science , technology and innovation ) [ 1 ] .",
    "particular questions involve , for example , the dissipation of energy and heat transport in devices under high - levels of excitation , namely , working in far - removed - from equilibrium conditions and eventually involving ultrafast relaxation and transport processes , as well as spatial motion in nanometric scales .",
    "another important aspect is the one of fluids under flow present in certain production processes ( e.g. , in food engineering , petrochemistry , etc ... ) whose performance depends on their hydrodynamic properties [ 2 ] .",
    "moreover it can be mentioned the question of figure of merit in thermoelectric devices , that is , relating currents of charges and of heat , particularly in the nanometric scale [ 3 ] .",
    "it has been noticed that one of the complicated problems of the nonequilibrium theory of transport processes in dense gases and liquids is the fact that their kinetics and hydrodynamics are intimately coupled , and must be treated simultaneously ( e.g. , see refs . [ 4 - 6 ] ) . along the last decades hydrodynamics has been extensively treated resorting to the so - called nonequilibrium molecular dynamics ( nmd for short ) .",
    "nmd is a computational method created for modelling physical systems at the microscopic level , being a good technique to study the molecular behavior of several physical processes [ 7,8 ] . on the other hand , another very satisfactory approach to deal with hydrodynamics within an ample scope of nonequilibrium conditions",
    "consists in the kinetic theory based on the non - equilibrium statistical ensemble formalism ( nesef for short ) [ 9 - 14 ] .",
    "nesef is a powerful formalism that provides an elegant , practical , and physically clear picture for describing irreversible processes , as for example in semiconductors far - from equilibrium [ 15 - 17 ] .",
    "nesef provides a way to go beyond standard ( or classical ) onsagerian hydrodynamics which involves restrictions , namely , local equilibrium ; linear relations between fluxes and thermodynamic forces ( meaning weak amplitudes in the motion ) with onsager s symmetry laws holding ; near homogeneous and static movement ( i.e. , involving only smooth variation in space and time ) ; and weak and rapidly regressing fluctuations [ 18,19 ] .",
    "hence , more advanced approaches are required to lift these restrictions . in phenomenological theories",
    "this corresponds to go from classical irreversible thermodynamics to extended irreversible thermodynamics [ 20 - 22 ] .",
    "this is what has been called _ generalized hydrodynamics _ , a question extensively debated for decades by the statistical mechanics community .",
    "several approaches have been used , and a description can be consulted in chapter 6 of the classical book on the subject by boon and yip [ 23 ] .",
    "introduction of nonlocal effects for describing motions with influence of ever decreasing wavelengths , going towards the very short limit , has been done in terms of expansions in increasing powers of the wavenumber , which consists in what is sometimes referred to as  higher - order generalized hydrodynamics \" ( hogh for short ) , also dubbed mesoscopic hydro - thermodynamics ( mht for short ) [ 24 ] .    within the scope of mesoscopic hydro - thermodynamics we consider here the question of transport of charge and of heat in n - doped polar semiconductors in the presence of electric fields .",
    "the hierarchy of equations of evolution for the density and energy density of carriers and of energy density of phonons and together with those for their fluxes of all orders , are obtained in the framework of the nonlinear quantum kinetic theory that is based on nesef [ 11 - 13,25,26 ] .",
    "the electrical and thermal conductivities in such nonequilibrium thermodynamic state and within a mht of order 1 , that is , a description reduced to include the densities and their first fluxes , are derived , and the influence of the order of the hogh ( contracted description in terms of the densities and a reduced number of higher - order fluxes ) and of the sample size ( macro to nano ) are discussed .",
    "the so - called maxwell times [ 27,28 ] are characterized and analyzed , with some numerical calculations and figures being presented .",
    "maxwell times are of fundamental relevance for establishing the order of the contracted description of mht to be used , and of large influence on the behavior of transport properties at short nanoscales .",
    "the construction of a mesoscopic hydro - thermodynamics for the description of the movement of matter and energy in fluids under nonequilibrium thermodynamic conditions and at the classical mechanical level based on a generalized moments approach method to the solution of a nesef - based generalized boltzmann equation [ 29 ] , is described elsewhere [ 30,31 ] .",
    "we consider here mht at the quantum mechanical level , for dealing with a system of carriers and phonons in n - doped polar semiconductors in the presence of electric fields ( up to 100 kv / cm ) which drive the system away from equilibrium .",
    "moreover , the system is taken to be in contact with an external thermostat at temperature @xmath0 .",
    "the system is characterized at the microscopic level by the hamiltonian @xmath1 consisting of the hamiltonians of the free electrons and free phonons , respectively @xmath2 @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the electrons conduction - band energy ( spin index has been ignored ) , @xmath5 is the phonon frequency dispersion relation with @xmath6 indicating the branch lo , to , la , ta , and @xmath7 and @xmath8 are wave vectors running over the brillouin zone .",
    "the electron - electron interaction is @xmath9 and for the electron - phonon interaction we have @xmath10 where as noticed @xmath6 indicates the phonon branch , and @xmath11 the type of interaction ( deformation potential , frhlich - polar with lo phonons , piezoelectric with la phonons ) with coupling strength @xmath12 .",

    "for the description of the macroscopic nonequilibrium thermodynamic state we resort , as already noticed , to the use of nesef .",
    "the statistical approach nesef requires first of all to specify the basic dynamical variables used to characterized the non - equilibrium ensemble [ 9,11 - 13,25,32 ] .",
    "a priori , when the system is driven away from equilibrium , it is necessary to include all observables of the system , which leads to the introduction of many - particle dynamical operators [ 33,34 ] , in the present case of single electrons in bloch conduction band and single phonons , it suffices to introduce only the single particle dynamical operator , namely @xmath19 with @xmath20 , and spin index ignored , for the carriers , and @xmath21 with @xmath20 for the phonons .",
    "dynamical operators of order two and higher ( in the bbgky hierarchy [ 34 ] ) do not contribute because correlations and higher - order variances are absent in the mean - field approximation for the carriers and the harmonic approximation for the lattice vibrations .",
    "moreover , since phonons are bosons , it would be necessary also to include the annihilation and creation operators @xmath22 and @xmath23 because their eingenstates are the coherent states [ 35 ] , and also the pair operators @xmath24 , @xmath25 because the number of quasi - particles is not fixed [ 36 ] .",
    "however , we disregard them because are of no relevance for the problem at hands . in appendix",
    "a we describe the corresponding non - equilibrium statistical operator ( cf .",
    "( a1 ) and ( a2 ) ) .",
    "operators @xmath26 and @xmath27 correspond to the occupation number operator describing a homogeneous population and those with @xmath20 , account for changes in space of the non - equilibrium distribution functions .    the average , over the non - equilibrium ensemble , of the microdynamical variables in the sets of eqs .",

    "[ 37 ] .",
    "elsewhere [ 38 ] it has been discussed the question of the contraction of description ( reduction of the dimensions of the nonequilibrium thermodynamic space of states ) , where a criterion for justifying the different levels of contraction is derived : it depends on the range of wavelengths and frequencies which are relevant for the characterization , in terms of normal modes , of the hydro - thermodynamic motion in the nonequilibrium open system .",
    "it can be shown that the truncation criterion _ rests on the characteristics of the hydrodynamic motion that develops under the given experimental procedure_.    since inclusion of higher and higher - order fluxes implies in describing a motion involving increasing knudsen numbers per hydrodynamic mode ( that is , governed by smaller and smaller wavelengths  larger and larger wavenumbers  accompanied by higher and higher frequencies ) .",
    "in a qualitative manner , we can say that , as a general  thumb rule \" , the criterion indicates that _ a more and more restricted contraction can be used when larger and larger are the prevalent wavelengths in the motion_. therefore , in simpler words , when the motion becomes more and more smooth in space and time , the more reduced can be the dimension of the basic macrovariables space to be used for the description of the nonequilibrium thermodynamic state of the system .",
    "it can be conjectured a general contraction criterion , namely , a contraction of order @xmath87 ( meaning keeping the densities and their fluxes up to order @xmath87 ) , once we can show that in the spectrum of wavelengths , which characterizes the motion , predominate those larger than a  frontier \" one , @xmath88 where @xmath89 is of the order of the thermal velocity and @xmath90 and @xmath91 the corresponding _ maxwell times _ , see next , associated to the @xmath87 and @xmath92 order fluxes .",
