    "looking for signals of physics beyond the standard model  ( sm ) is one of the most important missions of high energy physics .",
    "complementary to direct searches for new physics  ( np ) particles in the high energy colliders , the study of @xmath6 physics is of great importance for probing indirect signals of np . in this respect , the @xmath6 factories at slac and kek are doing a commendable job by providing us with a huge amount of data on various @xmath6-meson decays , which are mostly in perfect agreement with the sm predictions .",
    "however , there still exist some unexplained puzzles , such as the unmatched @xmath7 asymmetries in @xmath8 decays  @xcite , the abnormally large branching ratios of @xmath9 and @xmath10 decays  @xcite , and the large transverse polarization fractions in @xmath11 decays  @xcite . confronted with these anomalies , we are forced not only to consider more precise qcd effects , but also to speculate on the existence of possible np scenarios beyond the sm .",
    "it is well - known that the flavor - changing neutral current  ( fcnc ) processes arise only from loop effects within the sm , and are therefore very sensitive to various np effects .",
    "since the puzzling @xmath6-meson decay processes mentioned above are all related to the fcnc @xmath12 transitions , these decay channels could be used as effective probes of possible np scenarios .",
    "so , if one kind of np could resolve one of these puzzles , it is necessary to investigate whether the same scenario can also provide a simultaneous resolution to the others .",
    "considering the fact that current theoretical estimations of @xmath13 still suffer from large uncertainties  @xcite , and the np scenario with anomalous tensor operators considered in this paper do not contribute to the @xmath14 and @xmath15 decays in the naive factorization  ( nf ) approximation , we shall only focus on the @xmath16 and @xmath17 decays .",
    "the recent experimental data on the longitudinal polarization fraction @xmath18 in @xmath19 decay is given as @xmath20 on the other hand , since the two final - state light vector mesons @xmath21 and @xmath22 in this decay mode are flying out fleetly in the rest frame of @xmath6 meson , and the structure of the charged weak interaction current of the sm is left - handed , as well as the fact that high - energy qcd interactions conserve helicity , any spin flip of a fast flying quark will be suppressed by one power of @xmath23 , with @xmath24 the @xmath25 quark mass .",
    "it is therefore expected that , within the sm , both of the final - state hadrons in this decay mode are mainly longitudinally polarized , with @xmath26 while the transverse parts are suppressed by powers of @xmath27 .",
    "obviously , the experimental data eq .",
    "( [ fl - data ] ) deviates significantly from the sm prediction eq .",
    "( [ predifl ] ) , and this polarization anomaly has attracted much interest in searching for possible theoretical explanations both within the sm and in various np models  @xcite .",
    "for example , the authors in refs .",
    "@xcite have studied this anomaly and found that the four - quark tensor operators of the form @xmath28 could offer a simple resolution to the observed polarization anomaly within some possible parameter spaces .",
    "since the @xmath29 decays , in analogy with the @xmath11 decays , also involve the @xmath30 transition , it is necessary to investigate the effects of these new types of four - quark tensor operators on the latter . in particular , it is very interesting to see whether these new four - quark tensor operators with the same parameter spaces could also simultaneously account for the measured @xmath31  @xcite , which are much larger than the theoretical predictions within the sm  @xcite , and survive bounds from @xmath3 decays .",
    "motivated by these speculations , in this paper , we shall investigate the effects of the following two types of tensor operators on these decay modes  ( with @xmath32 the color indices ) @xmath33 and try to find out the allowed parameter spaces characterized by the strengths and phases of these new tensor operators that satisfy all the experimental constraints from these decays .",
    "moreover , since the ( pseudo-)scalar operators @xmath34 can be expressed , through the fierz transformations , as linear combinations of the new tensor operators eq .",
    "( [ eq : tensor ] ) , constraints on these two operators can be derived easily from those on the latter .    to further test such a particular np scenario with anomalous tensor operators",
    ", we also give predictions for the branching ratio and the longitudinal polarization fraction of @xmath5 decay , which is also involved the same quark level @xmath35 transition .",
    "all these results could be tested at the fermilab tevatron and the lhc - b experiments .",
