    "consider a semiparametric partially linear single - index model defined by @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a bounded time interval , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are two unknown vectors of parameters with dimensions @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively , @xmath6 is an unknown link function , @xmath7 is a scalar stochastic process , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are covariates with dimensions @xmath4 and  @xmath5 , respectively , and @xmath10 is the random error process . for the case of independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) or weakly dependent time series data , there has been extensive literature on statistical inference of model ( [ eq11 ] ) since its introduction by @xcite .",
    "several different approaches have been proposed to estimate the unknown parameters and link function involved ; see , for example , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . a recent paper by @xcite further developed semiparametric techniques for the variable selection and model specification testing issues in the context of model ( [ eq11 ] ) .    in this paper",
    ", we are interested in studying partially linear single - index model ( [ eq11 ] ) in the context of longitudinal data which arise frequently in many fields of research , such as biology , climatology , economics and epidemiology , and thus have attracted considerable attention in the literature in recent years . various parametric models and methods",
    "have been studied in depth for longitudinal data ; see @xcite and the references therein .",
    "however , the parametric models may be misspecified in practice , and the misspecification may lead to inconsistent estimates and incorrect conclusions being drawn .",
    "hence , to circumvent this issue , in recent years , there has been a large literature on how to relax the parametric assumptions on longitudinal data models and many nonparametric , and semiparametric models have thus been investigated ; see , for example , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "suppose that we have a random sample with @xmath11 subjects from model ( [ eq11 ] ) .",
    "for the @xmath12th subject , @xmath13 , the response variable @xmath14 and the covariates @xmath15 are collected at random time points @xmath16 , @xmath17 , which are distributed in a bounded time interval @xmath1 according to the probability density function @xmath18 . here",
    "@xmath19 is the total number of observations for the @xmath12th subject . to accommodate such longitudinal data , model ( [ eq11 ] )",
    "is written in the following framework : @xmath20 for @xmath13 and @xmath17 . when @xmath19 varies across the subjects , the longitudinal data set under investigation",
    "is unbalanced .",
    "several nonparametric and semiparametric models can be viewed as special cases of model ( [ eq12 ] ) .",
    "for instance , when @xmath21 , model ( [ eq12 ] ) reduces to the single - index longitudinal data model [ @xcite , @xcite ] ; when @xmath22 and @xmath23 , model ( [ eq12 ] ) reduces to the partially linear longitudinal data model [ @xcite ] . to avoid confusion , we let @xmath24 and @xmath25 be the true values of the two parameter vectors . for identifiability reasons ,",
    "@xmath26 is assumed to be a unit vector with the first nonzero element being positive .",
    "furthermore , we allow that there exists certain within - subject correlation structure for @xmath27 , which makes the model assumption more realistic but the development of estimation methodology more challenging .    to estimate the parameters @xmath24 , @xmath25 as well as the link function @xmath6 in model  ( [ eq12 ] ) , we first apply the local linear approximation to the unknown link function , and then introduce a profile weighted least squares approach to estimate the two parameter vectors based on the technique of generalized estimation equations ( gee ) .",
    "under some mild conditions , we derive the asymptotic properties of the developed parametric and nonparametric estimators in different scenarios .",
    "our framework is flexible in that @xmath19 can either be bounded or tend to infinity .",
    "thus both the dense and sparse longitudinal data cases can be included .",
    "dense longitudinal data means that there exists a sequence of positive numbers @xmath28 such that @xmath29 , and @xmath30 as @xmath31 [ see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ] , whereas sparse longitudinal data means that there exists a positive constant @xmath32 such that @xmath33 ; see , for example , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we show that the convergence rates and asymptotic variances of our semiparametric estimators in the sparse case are substantially different from those in the dense case .",
    "furthermore , we show that the proposed semiparametric gee ( sgee)-based estimators are asymptotically more efficient than the profile unweighted least squares ( puls ) estimators , when the weights in the sgee method are chosen as the inverse of the covariance matrix of the errors . we also introduce a semiparametric approach to estimate the covariance matrices ( or weights ) involved in the sgee method , which is based on a variance  correlation decomposition and consists of two steps : first , estimate the conditional variance function using a robust nonparametric method that accommodates heavy - tailed errors , and second , estimate the parameters in the correlation matrix . a simulation study and a real data analysis",
    "are provided to illustrate our methodology and theory .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec2 ]",
    ", we introduce the sgee methodology for estimating @xmath24 , @xmath26 and @xmath6 .",

    "various semiparametric estimationapproaches have been proposed to estimate model ( [ eq11 ] ) in the case of i.i.d .",
    "observations ( or weakly dependent time series data ) .",
    "see , for example , @xcite and @xcite for the profile likelihood method , @xcite and @xcite for the `` remove - one - component '' technique using penalized spline and local linear smoothing , respectively , and @xcite for the minimum average variance estimation approach .",
    "however , there is limited literature on partially linear single - index models for longitudinal data because of the more complicated structures involved .",
    "recently , @xcite studied a partially linear single - index longitudinal data model with individual effects . to remove the individual effects and derive consistent semiparametric estimators , they had to limit their discussions to the dense and balanced longitudinal data case . @xcite considered a partially linear single - index longitudinal data model by using polynomial splines to approximate the unknown link function , but their discussion was limited to the sparse and balanced longitudinal data case . in contrast , as mentioned in section  [ sec1 ] , our framework includes both the sparse and dense longitudinal data cases .",
    "meanwhile , observations are allowed to be collected at irregular and subject specific time points .",
    "all this provides much wider applicability of our framework .",

    "following the existing literature such as @xcite , the weights @xmath51 can be specified by two schemes : @xmath52 ( type 1 ) and @xmath53 ( type 2 ) , where @xmath54 . the type 1 weight scheme corresponds to an equal weight for each observation , while the type 2 scheme corresponds to an equal weight within each subject . as discussed in @xcite and @xcite , the type 2 scheme may be appropriate if the number of observations varies across subjects . as the longitudinal data under investigation in this paper are allowed to be unbalanced , we use @xmath53 , which was also used by @xcite and @xcite .",

    "together with the measurements from the children , the mean levels of ozone and no@xmath289 in the month prior to the visit were also recorded . due to dropout or other reasons ,",
    "the majority of children had 4 to 5 years of records , and the total number of observations in the data set is 3809 .",
    "as in many other studies , the fev will be used as a measure of lung function , and its log - transformed values , log(fev ) , will be used as the response values in our model .",

    ", we include all other recorded variables . as age and height exhibit strong co - linearity ( with a correlation of 0.78 ) , we will only use height in the study .",
    "in fitting the partially linear single - index model to the data , all the continuous variables ( i.e. , fev , h , bmi , ozone and no@xmath289 ) are log - transformed , and the log(bmi ) , log(ozone ) and log(no@xmath289 ) are included in the single - index part .",

    "the conditional variance function is estimated by using the log - transformed local linear method , and the parameters in the correlation matrices are estimated by the minimum generalized variance method . in particular , if the correlation matrices are correctly specified , as is stated in corollary  [ co1 ] , the sgee - based estimators @xmath84 and @xmath296 are generally asymptotically more efficient than the corresponding puls estimators @xmath64 and @xmath65 in the sense that the asymptotic covariance matrix of the sgee estimators minus that of the puls estimators is negative semi - definite .",
