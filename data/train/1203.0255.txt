    "evolved late - type stars ( agb stars and red supergiants ) are observed to undergo mass loss at high rates .",
    "they are thus surrounded by expanding circumstellar envelopes ( cses ) .",
    "observations show a wide variety of different properties of the central stars and of the cses , which are not always easily related .",
    "the time variability of the mass loss phenomenon may explain why it is difficult to relate the properties of cses to those of the central stars .",
    "also , some stars may share the same observational properties , but be in slightly different evolutionary stages , with different initial masses and different mass loss histories .",
    "it would be extremely useful to get overviews of cses that would allow us to smooth the chaotic effects of the mass loss time - variability and as well to measure the total mass expelled by the central stars . with this goal in mind",
    ", we are exploring the properties of cses around evolved stars by using the atomic hydrogen ( h ) line at 21 cm .",
    "indeed , hydrogen is expected to be the dominant species in stellar winds of evolved stars .",
    "it is also expected to be in atomic form right from the stellar atmosphere if the effective temperature , t@xmath9 , is larger than 2500k , and to remain atomic in the expanding wind ( glassgold & huggins 1983 ) .",
    "also , atomic hydrogen should be protected from photoionization by the abundant atomic hydrogen in the interstellar medium ( ism ) which absorbs uv photons of energy larger than 13.6 ev .",
    "the h  line at 21 cm should thus be an important tracer of stellar winds for late - type stars with t@xmath9@xmath10 2500k , including the outer cses where molecules are dissociated .",
    "h  studies should bring unique information on the kinematics in these media , and in particular in the regions of interaction with the ism .",
    "however the detection of red giants in the h  line at 21 cm is hampered by the competing emission from atomic hydrogen in the ism ( which ironically protects the circumstellar atomic hydrogen from destruction ) along the same lines of sight . for a long time",
    "this difficulty precluded h  observational studies of evolved stars .",
    "however , recently , taking advantage of upgraded instruments , we addressed this topic and obtained several detections of agb stars ( grard & lebertre 2006 , matthews & reid 2007 ) . in general ,",
    "a narrow emission line with a quasi - gaussian profile ( fwhm @xmath2 3kms@xmath6 ) is observed close to the stellar radial velocity ( v@xmath11 ) .",
    "the fate of massive stars is strongly dependent on their mass loss history , which is still poorly understood , in particular when they are red supergiants ( van loon 2010 ) .",
    "our previous successes encouraged us to extend h   observations to this class of stars .",
    "although suffering from strong galactic h  emission , the supergiant @xmath0 ori   was detected by bowers & knapp ( 1987 ) using the very large array . at the position of the star , they found emission from the front and back sides of a cse expanding at a velocity of 14 kms@xmath6 .    in this paper , we report new 21-cm observations of @xmath0  ori that we analyze in combination with the previous data from bowers & knapp ( 1987 ) , in order to revisit in h  this otherwise well - documented red supergiant .",

    "( 2011 ) have studied the coupling of dust and gas within a shocked wind with conditions typical of @xmath0ori .",
    "they find that , apart for large grains ( radius  @xmath10  0.045@xmath14 m ) , the dust remains bound to the gas in such a structure .",
    "we found however that the far - ir arc coincides with fuv emission and is associated with atomic hydrogen emission ( figs .",
    "[ vla - channel - maps - hr ] and [ vla - channel - maps - plus - iras ] ) .",
    "the mass in atomic hydrogen compares fairly well with the estimate of the total mass of the far - ir arc by noriega - crespo et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , given the uncertainties in our h  estimate and in the gas - to - dust ratio ( 100 ) adopted by noriega - crespo et al .",
    "h  emission is found mainly at 7.6@xmath121.3 kms@xmath6 , i.e. at the velocity at which interstellar emission peaks ( see fig .  [ nrt - lab ] ) .",
    "thus the atomic gas that we detect in coincidence with the far - ir arc seems related to the surrounding ism rather than to @xmath0 ori .",
    "possibly , it is interstellar matter compressed in a precursor ahead of the bow shock",
    ".    the ism gas that crosses the bow shock at @xmath230kms@xmath6  should be heated at a temperature @xmath225000k , and hydrogen may be ionized . except to the south - west ,",
    "we have found no unambiguous evidence of atomic hydrogen associated with @xmath0 ori  beyond 3@xmath8 from the star .",
    "this suggests that hydrogen in the region between the interface and the bow shock remains ionized during the lapse of @xmath210@xmath35 years that we infer for the formation of the detached shell , or that it remains sufficiently warm that its emission is widened over a large range of velocities , preventing its detection . in these conditions ,",
    "our h   modeling can not bring real constraints on the region of the detached shell which is filled by matter from the ism .",
    "in particular , the value that we have adopted for the parameter r@xmath21 has no real significance .",
    "conversely , the parameters that we find for the circumstellar part of the detached shell could be used as constraints for the 3d hydrodynamic simulations of the betelgeuse s bow shock that start to be developed ( e.g. mohamed et al . 2011 ) . in this specific case",
    ", we note that the interface is at  0.3pc from the central star , which seems too large compared to our h   observations , that suggest a smaller value .",
    "possibly the rate of mass loss adopted by mohamed et al .",
    "( 3@xmath310@xmath4m@xmath5yr@xmath6 ) is too large . the density of the ism material through which @xmath0 ori  is moving is also uncertain .",
    "another possibility is that the far - ir arc seen at 6@xmath8 from @xmath0 ori  is not the true bow shock related to the detached gas shell that is detected at 21 cm .",
    "the examination of the images published by cox et al .",
    "( 2012 ) suggests that there are other structures inside the far - ir arc , in particular another arc at 3@xmath8 north - east of @xmath0 ori .",
    "it is tempting to hypothesize that this 3@xmath8-radius arc is the true bow shock related to the detached shell that we have modeled . in that case",
    "the 6@xmath8-radius arc which is also seen in h  and far - uv would be related to a more ancient episode of mass loss .",
    "clearly spectral information on the far - ir emission of this arc and imaging in h  at a higher spatial resolution are needed in order to elaborate on its true nature .",
    "the characteristics of the internal medium , between the detached shell and the far - ir arc , are also an issue .",
    "observations in the h  line at 21 cm of @xmath0 ori  have been performed with the nrt and the vla . a source ( @xmath45 )",
    "has been detected at the position of the star .",
    "the emission is dominated by a narrow line ( fwhm @xmath2 3 kms@xmath6 ) centered close to v@xmath11 .",
    "the vla data show that this source has the structure of a detached shell elongated towards the south - west .",
    "this shape agrees with the numerical simulations of a cse moving through the ism .",
    "emission peaks at v@xmath11@xmath12v@xmath22  are also observed by the vla at the position of the central star .",
    "presently the data bring no clear evidence of atomic hydrogen outside this source .",
    "we have developed a working model adapted to @xmath0 ori  and its detached neutral gas shell that accounts for the spectral features that are observed and for the size of the source . in this model , the detached gas shell of @xmath0 ori  results from the collision of a 1.2@xmath310@xmath4 m@xmath5yr@xmath6  stellar wind , expanding at 14kms@xmath6 , with the surrounding ism for a lapse of @xmath210@xmath35 years .",
    "the gas is cooling from a post - termination - shock temperature of 5800k to @xmath2220k , at the interface with ism .",
    "the high level of confusion in the direction of @xmath0 ori forces us to be cautious .",
    "nevertheless , by selecting different ranges of baselines , it is possible to obtain images revealing the detached shell of @xmath0 ori as well as h  emission coincident with the 6@xmath8 far - ir / far - uv arc .",
    "presently , we can not conclude on the exact nature of the structure in arc discovered by iras .",
    "we suggest that the h  emission might come from a precursor of the @xmath0 ori  bow shock , or that the whole structure could be related to an ancient episode of mass loss .",
