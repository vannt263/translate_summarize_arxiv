    "tunable continuous - wave ( cw ) lasers are the workhorse for quantum technologies based on ultracold atoms and ions . while the visible and near - infrared spectral regions are readily accessible by solid - state laser systems , the extension of these techniques to the near - ultraviolet region remains an active area of research .",
    "many ionic and atomic species have their principal cooling transitions in the near - uv , including species such as be@xmath12 @xcite and hg @xcite that are relevant for optical frequency standards .",
    "in addition to laser cooling , narrowband cw excitation enables precision spectroscopy of highly excited rydberg states .",
    "rydberg atoms have high principal quantum number @xmath10 and exhibit large atomic polarizabilities , which scale as @xmath15 , thus providing tunable long - range interactions and high sensitivity to electric fields . with sufficiently narrowband excitation the long - range interactions between pairs of rydberg atoms can be observed .",
    "in particular , if the interaction shift exceeds the linewidth of the excitation , then a blockade effect occurs @xcite and a single excitation is shared between all the atoms within a blockade radius @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the van der waals interaction strength and @xmath18 is the excitation rabi frequency .",
    "the rydberg blockade effect has been used to demonstrate quantum effects in neutral atoms , including cooperativity @xcite , entanglement @xcite , a controlled - not gate @xcite and coherent many - body rabi oscillations @xcite .",
    "other applications of precision rydberg spectroscopy include electrometry @xcite , production of single photons @xcite and the creation of ultra - long range molecules @xcite . by optically `` dressing '' the ground or a metastable state with a rydberg state ,",
    "further potential applications include demonstration of a super - solid phase of matter @xcite and spin - squeezing in optical lattice clocks for increased signal - to - noise beyond the standard quantum limit @xcite .",
    "_ @xcite have recently demonstrated rydberg dressing in cs atoms for studying low - decoherence implementation of a controlled - z gate .",
    "so far , most of these experiments have relied on a two - step excitation scheme via a short - lived , low - lying intermediate state .",
    "while this has the advantage that both lasers may be in the visible or near - ir spectral regions , the short lifetime of the intermediate state introduces additional decoherence .",
    "electromagnetically induced transparency @xcite or off - resonant two - photon excitation @xcite can reduce this effect , but at the expense of a lower rydberg excitation efficiency .",
    "more recently , experiments in the alkali atoms have used direct excitation from the ground state , which requires tunable cw light at 297 nm ( rb ) @xcite and 319 nm ( cs ) @xcite .    an alternative approach to reducing the decoherence of the two - photon excitation scheme is provided by two - electron atoms such as sr . here , intercombination transitions give access to long - lived intermediate states .",
    "these provide a coherent two - photon excitation route to the triplet rydberg states , including the 5s@xmath10s@xmath19s@xmath20 series which have near - isotropic wavefunctions and interaction strengths @xcite .",
    "isotropic interactions relax the geometric constraints of the atomic sample for many of the proposed rydberg and dressing experiments , and could be key for demonstrating a supersolid phase of matter @xcite . moving to two - electron atoms",
    "also enables applications , such as spin - squeezing @xcite and blackbody thermometry @xcite , in optical lattice clocks . in sr",
