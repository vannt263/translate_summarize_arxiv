    "quantum information theory explores the potential of quantum mechanics in order to process and transmit information . a two - level system , a qubit , constitutes the unit resource for storing information .",
    "similarly , a unitary operation on one qubit can be regarded as a basic unit of information processing @xcite . in this paper",
    "we explore the possibility of storing quantum dynamics , in particular unitary transformations , in the state of a quantum system , in a manner that the transformation can be performed at a later time and on another system almost perfectly",
    ".      the problem we address can be well - posed in the context of quantum circuitry .",
    "we will say that the _ program _ state @xmath0 of some _ program register _ stores the one - qubit transformation @xmath1 , if some `` fixed '' protocol employing the state @xmath0 is able to perform @xmath1 on an arbitrary _ data _ state @xmath2 of a single qubit _ data register_. here , a `` fixed '' protocol means that the manipulation of the joint state _u [ estat ] does not require knowing the operation @xmath1 nor the state @xmath2 .",
    "a device able to transform state ( [ estat ] ) into uu^_,u , [ universal ] where @xmath3 is just some residual state , is known as a _ programmable _ quantum gate @xcite . in a similar fashion as modern ( classical ) computers take both the program to be executed and the data to be processed as input bit strings , a programmable or universal quantum gate is a device whose action @xmath1 on an arbitrary data state @xmath2 is determined by the program state @xmath0 .",
    "nielsen and chuang @xcite analyzed the possibility of constructing such a programmable quantum gate .",
    "its total dynamics was described by means of a fixed unitary operator g according to g [ ] = ( u ) , [ perfect ] where only pure data states @xmath4 were considered because this already warranties the mixed state case .",
    "notice that the program state @xmath5 and the residual state @xmath6  which was showed to be independent of @xmath4 can always be taken to be pure , by extending the program register with an ancillary system if needed .",
    "nielsen and chuang proved that any two inequivalent operations @xmath1 and @xmath7 require orthogonal program states , that is @xmath8 .",
    "thus , in order to perfectly store a given operation @xmath9 from some set @xmath10 , a vector state @xmath11 from an orthonormal basis @xmath12 has to be used . the operation @xmath13 can then be implemented by , say , measuring the program register to obtain the value @xmath14 , and gauging correspondingly some convenient experimental device . since the set of unitary operations is infinite ,",
    "their result implied that no universal gate can be constructed using finite resources , that is , with a finite dimensional program register .",
    "the aim of this work is to present programmable quantum gates with a finite program register , and thus physically feasible .",
    "a finite register turns out to be sufficient if a degree of imperfection , no matter how small , is allowed in performing the unkwon operation @xmath1 .",
    "we will construct a family of _ probabilistic _ programmable quantum gates , that is programmable quantum gates which work with a given prior probability @xmath15 of a successful implementation of @xmath1 .",
    "such a one - qubit gate with @xmath16 was already described in @xcite . here",
    "we will achieve any arbitrarily small @xmath17 .",
    "we will also consider _ approximate _ programmable quantum gates , which perform an operation @xmath18 very similar to the desired @xmath1 , that is @xmath19 for some transformation fidelity @xmath20 .",
    "the second main result is a lower bound on the dimension of the program register of the programmable gate in terms of its degree of imperfection @xmath21 .",
    "it implies that the orthogonality result of @xcite is robust",
    ". we will discuss its implications in the context of secure secret computation .",
    "finally , operations stored in a quantum state can be teleported .",
    "this leads to a new scheme for quantum remote control @xcite that only requires unidirectional communication .",
    "we start by showing how to store and reimplement , in an imperfect but feasible fashion , an arbitrary one - qubit unitary operation of the form u _ ( i_z ) , [ unialpha ] where @xmath22 .",
    "notice that a general one - qubit operation @xmath23 can be obtained by composing three operations of the form of eq .",
    "( [ unialpha ] ) with some fixed unitary operations , for instance as @xmath24@xmath25@xmath26@xmath27 .",
    "let us consider the state ( e^i+e^-i ) , which someone , say alice , can prepare by applying @xmath28 on a qubit in the standard state @xmath29 .",
    "suppose she also prepares , along with @xmath30 , another qubit in some arbitrary state @xmath31 and provides bob , who does nt know @xmath32 nor the complex coefficients @xmath33 and @xmath34 , with the two qubits in state @xmath35 .",
    "alice challenges now bob to obtain the state @xmath36 .",
    "what bob can do in order to implement the unknown @xmath1 with some probability of success is to perform a c - not operation taking the data qubit in state @xmath4 as the control and the program qubit in state @xmath30 as the target .",
    "this will constitute the basic part of our simplest programmable quantum gate .",
    "recalling that the c - not gate , i + _ x , permutes the @xmath37 and @xmath38 states of the target ( second qubit ) only if the control ( first qubit ) is in state @xmath38 , it is easy to check that the two - qubit state is transformed according to ( u _ + u_^ ) .",
    "therefore , a projective measurement in the @xmath39 basis of the program register will make the data qubit collapse either into the desired state @xmath36 or into the wrong state @xmath40 , with each outcome having prior probability @xmath41 .",
    "that is , we have already constructed a probabilistic programmable quantum gate with error rate @xmath42 ( see figure ( [ fig1 ] ) ) .",
    "notice that a single qubit has been sufficient for alice to store an arbitrary unitary @xmath28 , i.e. , one from an infinite set , although its recovery only succeeds with probability @xmath41 .",
    "if bob obtains @xmath40 instead of @xmath36 , then not only he fails at performing the wished operation , but in addition he does no longer have the initial data state @xmath4 .",
    "how can we construct a more efficient programmable gate ?",
    "notice that in case of failure , a second go of the previous gate can correct @xmath40 into @xmath36 . indeed , bob needs only apply the gate of fig .",
    "( [ fig1 ] ) to @xmath40 , inserting a new program state , namely @xmath43 , which alice can prepare by performing twice the operation @xmath28 on @xmath44 .",
    "therefore , if alice supplies the state @xmath45 to bob , he can perform the operation @xmath28 with probability @xmath46 .",
    "figure ( [ fig2 ] ) displays a more compact version of this second probabilistic programmable gate , which requires a two - qubit program register and has a probability of failure @xmath47 .    in case of a new failure ,",
    "the state of the system becomes @xmath48 .",
    "bob can insert again this state , together with state @xmath49 , into the elementary gate .",
    "if bob has no luck and keeps on obtaining failures , he can try to correct the state as many times as he wishes , provided that the state @xmath50 is available for the @xmath51th attempt . therefore , for any @xmath52 , the @xmath52-qubit state @xmath53 can be used to implement the transformation @xmath28 with probability @xmath54 .",
    "resembles that used in @xcite to implement a non - local unitary operation . in the present context",
    "all intermediate measurements and conditional actions can be substituted by a single unitary operation , as described in figures 2 and 3 . in this section",
    "we have first presented the several - measurement version for pedagogical reasons . ] the corresponding probabilistic programmable gate ( see figure ( [ fig3 ] ) ) , consists of the unitary transformation of @xmath55 into (  u _",
    "+ u_^(2^n-1 ) ) [ nqubits ] and of a posterior measurement of the program register ( either in state @xmath56 or @xmath57 , @xmath58 ) .",
    "its failure probability , @xmath59 , decreases exponentially with the size @xmath52 of the program register .",
    "it is interesting to look at how long the program needs to be , on average , until bob succeeds to perform @xmath28 with certainty . with probability",
    "@xmath60 he succeeds after using a single - qubit program ; with probability @xmath61 a two - qubit program is sufficient ; etc .",
    "the average length @xmath62 of the required program is thus |n= _",
    "[ average ] that is , a two qubit register is sufficient , on average , to store an arbitrary @xmath28 so that it can be performed with certainty .",
    "a probabilistic programmable gate may either succeed or fail , depending on the result of the final measurement on the program register .",
    "an approximate gate , instead , performs a transformation only similar to the desired one , but it is always successful .",
    "suppose we want to apply the unitary transformation @xmath1 on @xmath63 but instead another ( general ) transformation @xmath64 is actually performed .",
    "a possible way of quantifying how similar these two operations are is by applying both operations to the same state @xmath63 , and then computing the fidelity between the two transformed states , @xmath65 and @xmath66 . when averaged over all possible @xmath63 this reads f(,u ) du^()u .",
    "[ fid ] suppose now that after the transformation ( [ nqubits ] ) of the previous probabilistic gate we decide to ignore the state of the @xmath52-qubit program register .",
    "then the programmable gate works approximately , implementing an operation @xmath67 , where @xmath68 .",
    "the average fidelity of performance ( [ fid ] ) satisfies @xmath69 .",
    "so far we have explicitly constructed programmable quantum gates that perform , either probabilistically or approximately , some class of one - qubit unitary operations @xmath28 .",
    "but the previous protocols also allow alice to codify with finite resources any unitary operation @xmath70 acting on an arbitrary number @xmath51 of qubits .",
    "indeed , as already mentioned , alice can codify an arbitrary one - qubit unitary operation using only @xmath71 @xmath28 s , and then also combine several of those with c - not gates to obtain @xmath70 .      in view of these results",
    ", one may wonder whether quasi - perfect programmable gates can be applied , in the context of quantum cryptography and computation , to secretly compute some unitary operation @xmath70 , for instance a precious algorithm , on some initial @xmath51-qubit state @xmath72 .",
    "the idea is that alice gives a program state @xmath73 and the data state @xmath72 to bob , who operates a programmable quantum gate array but ignores @xmath70 .",
    "bob is required to compute @xmath74 , but alice does not want bob to know what program he is running on his quantum computer . if the gate is perfect as in ( [ perfect ] ) , then bob can in principle distinguish @xmath73 from any other program state , since they are orthogonal .",
    "therefore he can , imperceptibly to alice , make an illegal copy of the program , perform the required transformation using the original program state , and give the computed state to alice .    however , when the gate is slightly imperfect , different programs need no longer be orthogonal .",
    "now bob can not determine perfectly well which program he is to run in his computer .",
    "if he tries to estimate @xmath73 , then in addition he will necessarily modify the program state , which will result in an improper performance of the gate and then alice  who may have simply been testing bob s integrity  can , in principle , detect it .",
    "that is , it is not possible for bob to copy , even in an approximate form , the program state and at the same time perform the operation alice has commended him with , without this being detectable .",
    "we next derive lower bounds on the size @xmath52 of the program register of any quasi - perfect ( i.e. with @xmath75 ) programmable gate , and on the degree of orthogonality between its program states @xmath5 corresponding to similar operations , in terms of its failure parameter @xmath21 .",
    "these bounds represent a severe limitation on the degree of reliability that a security scheme based on the above ideas can offer .",
    "they indicate that the program vectors @xmath5 and @xmath76 are significantly non - orthogonal ( that is , non - distinguishable ) only when the imperfection parameter @xmath21 makes them effectively equivalent .",
    "let us consider a generic imperfect programmable gate acting on a @xmath77 system , so that it can be programmed to perform some or all @xmath78 .",
    "it can be described by a unitary operator @xmath79 according to g _ [ ] = ( u ) + , [ rotllo ] where the wrong state @xmath80 is not required to fulfill any requirement for an _ approximate _ gate , whereas it must satisfy @xmath81 ( here @xmath82 is the null vector of the data register ) for any two inequivalent operations @xmath7 and @xmath1 and any two data states @xmath83 and @xmath84 for a _",
    "probabilistic _ gate .",
    "this last condition is necessary for bob , who ignores both @xmath1 and the data , to be able to know whether the transformation @xmath1 has been successfully performed by measuring the program register .",
    "we first notice that the state @xmath85 only depends on @xmath86 through a contribution of order @xmath87 , where from now on @xmath88 for approximate gates and @xmath89 for probabilistic ones . indeed , for any program state @xmath5 , the scalar product of ( [ rotllo ] ) corresponding to any two data states @xmath83 and @xmath84 reads = + o(^p ) , from which , by fixing @xmath83 and considering any @xmath84 , we find that @xmath90 .",
    "that is = + o(^ ) . keeping this in mind , we now consider , for any given @xmath4 , the scalar product of ( [ rotllo ] ) corresponding to two unitary operations @xmath1 and @xmath7 , which turns out to read = u^v + o(^ ) .",
    "[ productuv ] the scalar product @xmath91 does not depend on @xmath4",
    ". therefore the dependence of @xmath92 on @xmath4 has to be of order @xmath87 , at most .",
    "suppose @xmath1 and @xmath7 are very close . that is , u^ v = e^il = i + il - l^2 + o(l^3 ) , where all the eigenvalues @xmath93 of the traceless ( @xmath94 ) hermitian operator @xmath95 @xmath96 , are very small .",
    "the largest variation of @xmath97 in ( [ productuv ] ) for two different vectors @xmath4 is @xmath98 .",
    "we introduce a distance on the set of operators on @xmath99 , d_u , v ( [ ( u - v)^(u - v)])^. then @xmath100 .",
    "subtracting ( [ productuv ] ) for @xmath101 from itself for @xmath102 we conclude that @xmath103 , which finally implies || .",
    "[ bound1 ] this bound says that in a programmable quantum gate with a small error rate @xmath104 , two transformations @xmath1 and @xmath105 will have program states with significant overlap @xmath91 ( states @xmath5 and @xmath76 are indistinguishable ) only if @xmath1 and @xmath7 are also very close to each other , @xmath106 .",
    "that is , only if @xmath1 and @xmath7 process the data very similarly , then a dishonest bob is unable to distinguish between the corresponding programs .      the previous result can also be used to derive a lower bound on the dimension of the program register of an imperfect programmable gate with error @xmath21 .",
    "for simplicity we will assume that the gate can only be programmed to perform the one - qubit transformations @xmath28 from eq .",
    "( [ unialpha ] ) . consider a discrete subset of such transformations , namely those with @xmath107 , @xmath108 , and apply the previous bound to @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "we obtain || k^pm ,   t0 , [ bo ] where @xmath111 is some unimportant constant .",
    "we need the following lemma .    * lemma : * let @xmath112 be a set of @xmath113 ( normalized ) vectors such that their scalar products @xmath114 satisfy @xmath115 for @xmath116 . then the @xmath113 vectors are linearly independent .    _",

    "* remark : * for @xmath113 sufficiently large , if all @xmath131 are of order @xmath132 and the components of the eigenvector @xmath120 are relatively equally weighted , then it is plausible that the eigenvalue @xmath133_j/[{\\mbox{$|",
    "\\varphi \\rangle$}}]_i$ ] is of the order @xmath134 ( random walk ) .",
    "this suggests that in order for the set @xmath112 to have rank close to @xmath113 , it is sufficient that @xmath135 , instead of @xmath115 as required in the lemma",
    ".    let us set @xmath136 .",
    "then ( [ bo ] ) becomes @xmath137 , and this means , because of the lemma , that at least an @xmath138-dimensional hilbert is required to contain @xmath139 .",
    "that is , the program register must consists of at least @xmath140 qubits .",
    "notice that the previous remark suggests that this bound may be reduced to @xmath141 qubits , in which case the probabilistic programmable gate of figure ( [ fig3 ] ) would require , asymptotically , the smallest possible program register .",
    "for a general programmable gate implementing some or all transformations @xmath78 it is straightforward to obtain a similar lower bound on the dimensions of the program register , which also says that its number @xmath52 of qubits grows proportionally to the logarithm of the inverse of the rate error , @xmath142 , for some positive constant @xmath143 .",
    "we have shown how to store an arbitrary unitary transformation in the pure state of a finite quantum register , in such a way that it can be performed quasi - perfectly at a later time . once the unknown operation has been encoded in a quantum state ,",
    "it can of course be processed using _ any _ known state manipulation technique .",
    "an interesting application of our results is in the context of quantum remote control . as introduced by huelga _",
    "_ in @xcite , let us suppose bob wishes to manipulate some data state according to an unknown operation alice , a distant party , can implement by using some device .",
    "if the state of alice s device can not be teleported , then the optimal protocol @xcite is to use standard teleportation @xcite to send the data from bob to alice , who will use the device to process it and will teleport it back to bob .",
    "but we now know how to efficiently store operations in quantum states , which can then be teleported .",
    "this leads to a new scheme for quantum remote control : alice stores the operation in a quantum state and applies standard teleportation to send it to bob .    remarkably enough , in this protocol only one - way communication is required in addition to entanglement in order for alice to remotely manipulate bob s data , as opposed to the two - way classical communication of the scheme presented in @xcite .",
    "this implies that the operation can be teleported independently of whether bob s data state is already available .",
    "more specifically , we find that a @xmath52-qubit program @xmath144 can be teleported from alice to bob by using up @xmath52 ebits of entanglement and by sending @xmath52 classical bits from alice to bob ( recall that the classical communication cost of quantum teleportation of equatorial states , as @xmath30 , require only one bit per state @xcite ) . eq .",
    "( [ average ] ) implies that , on average , @xmath145 ebits of entanglement between alice and bob , and @xmath145 classical bits from alice to bob are sufficient for alice to teleport an arbitrary @xmath28 to bob , so that he , ignoring @xmath28 , can perform it with certainty .",
    "the storage of quantum transformations turns out to be useful in several other contexts .",
    "if state estimation techniques are applied to the system that stores an unknown operation , then we obtain the scheme for estimation of quantum dynamics recently exploited by acn _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "cirac _ et al _ @xcite have recently explored the possibilities of encoding operations in quantum states in the context of non - local transformations of a composite system .",
    "in particular , they have shown how to implement non - local unitary transformations using less than one ebit of entanglement . in an extension of their work ,",
    "dr _ et al _ @xcite have considered alternative schemes for storing and manipulating quantum transformations .",
    "we have presented a scheme for storing unitary operations in the quantum state of a finite dimensional program register .",
    "the operations can be implemented at a later time with some associated error @xmath21 , which decreases exponentially with the number of qubits of the program register .",
    "we have presented both probabilistic and approximate programmable quantum gates , and have discussed the possibility of using them to make a secrete computation on a public quantum computer .",
