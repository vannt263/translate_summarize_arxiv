    "gravity is the only fundamental interaction which is universally coupled to all matter fields .",
    "universality is then guaranteed by the tree - level coupling of the graviton field with the conserved energy - momentum tensor . however ,",
    "when quantum corrections are taken into account , matter - coupling universality could be spoiled .",
    "it is known that quantum corrections to the graviton - matter vertices ( without gravitons in the loops ) are finite if the underlying theory of matter fields ( in flat space - time ) is renormalizable @xcite .",
    "this remarkable property is just a consequence of the ward identities ( wi ) that result from the energy - momentum conservation @xcite .",
    "therefore , ( matter ) radiative corrections to the graviton - matter vertices can be consistently calculated in the framework of gravity coupled to the standard model ( sm ) theory .",
    "long ago , berends and gastmans evaluated the finite corrections to the graviton - photon and graviton - electron vertices due to virtual quantum electrodynamical ( qed ) processes at the one - loop level @xcite . in the latter case",
    "the corrections found lead to a modification of the newton s law . in particular , for an electron ( or any charged particle ) in a gravitational field of a stationary mass @xmath4 , they found a repulsive correction term proportional to the classical radius of the particle , @xmath5 , or v(r)~-(1- ) , [ np ] where @xmath6 is the newton constant , @xmath7 is the fine - structure constant , and @xmath8 is the mass of the electron . at macroscopic distances ( @xmath9 ) the modification of newton s law induced by the @xmath10 term in eq.([np ] ) is extremely small , @xmath11 at the surface of the earth @xcite .",
    "the term @xmath10 has an infrared origin as it can be simply understood by looking at the singular behavior of the one - loop feynman diagrams in the massless limit ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the correction to the tree - level electron - graviton vertex is proportional to @xmath13 for negative small values of @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the momentum transfer .",
    "this is due to the fact that the photon has a tree - level coupling with the graviton .",
    "then , the diagram where the external graviton is attached to two virtual photons in the loop contains a term with a powerlike infrared singularity as @xmath12 .",
    "thus , after fourier transforming into coordinates space , this contribution gives rise to a @xmath16 correction to the newton potential .",
    "notice that there is no counterpart of such effect in qed .",
    "indeed , due to the absence of self - photon interactions at tree - level , the coulomb potential is protected against @xmath10 corrections of order @xmath17 .",
    "it is remarkable that , although derived in the framework of quantum field theory , the @xmath10 term in eq.([np ] ) has a pure classical origin and it was first obtained on the basis of purely classical considerations in ref.@xcite .",
    "indeed this term arises from the fact that the total mass of the particle is not concentrated at a point but is partly distributed as field energy in the space around the particle @xcite .",
    "when gravity is coupled to the weak interactions the one - loop radiative corrections to the graviton - fermion vertex will include also the virtual exchanges of the weak gauge bosons @xmath18 and @xmath19 . at the moment ,",
    "a complete study of these effects is still missing .",
    "these corrections are expected to give small contributions in the low energy limit and furthermore to be infrared safe , being the @xmath18 and @xmath19 massive .",
    "therefore , no long - distance modifications in the newton potential are expected from the weak radiative corrections .",
    "a peculiar aspect of the weak interactions is that they can induce ( at one loop ) flavor - changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) processes in the fermionic sector .",
    "since fcnc are absent at tree - level , they arise as a pure quantum effect .",
    "analogously , flavor - changing ( fc ) graviton vertices are not present at the tree - level . however",
    ", when gravity is coupled to the weak interactions , quantum weak - corrections can induce an off - diagonal contribution ( in flavor space ) to the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "these effects are the spin-2 counterpart of the standard spin-1 fcnc contribution in the sm . because of the tensorial nature of the coupling of spin-2 particles to the matter fields we will refer to these effects as tensorial flavor - changing neutral currents ( tfcnc ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to compute the form factors of the tfcnc and analyze their gravitational couplings .",
    "we perform the exact computation of the one - loop fc fermion - graviton vertex , i.e.  retaining the full dependence on all masses and momenta .",
    "we investigate under which conditions these effective couplings could induce modifications in the newton potential discussing both cases of massless and massive - graviton exchange .",
    "we consider a few applications of these results in the case of massive spin-2 particles .",
    "in particular , we analyze the fc decay @xmath20 , and the decay @xmath21 where @xmath22 stands for a massive spin-2 particle .",
    "our results can be easily generalized to the leptonic sector with massive dirac neutrinos , provided the ckm matrix of the quark sector is substituted with the corresponding leptonic one .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we specify the interaction between the sm fields and the graviton by suitably choosing a gauge that avoids the appearance of cubic vector boson - goldstone - graviton interactions .",
    "we analyze the general structure of the off - diagonal matrix element ( in flavor space ) of the energy - momentum tensor of fermion fields , derive the corresponding ward - identities , and provide the analytical expressions of the relevant form factors .",
