    "products of quantum fluctuations in two non commuting observables satisfy the uncertainty relation but the individual fluctuations can be reduced and this gives the well known concept of squeezing . in classical optics , the polarization state of light beam can be visualized as direction of a stokes vector in poincare sphere and is determined by the four stokes parameters @xcite . for a monochromatic unidirectional light traveling along z - direction ,",

    "e.g. _ , @xmath17 does not represent only unpolarized light @xcite .",
    "these parameters still remain important mainly due to the non - classicalities associated with polarization , _ viz _ , polarization squeezing @xcite and polarization entanglement @xcite .",
    "+ the stokes operators are the relevant continuous variables for the system describing polarization . squeezed radiation states in quantum optics are identified by the property that their quantum fluctuations are reduced below the standard quantum limit in one of the quadrature components .",
    "similar to this concept , polarization squeezing is defined using the commutation relations followed by stokes operators and uncertainty products .",
    "existence of a minimum quantum limit for product of uncertainties in measurement of two different stokes operators leads to the concept of polarization squeezing discussed in the next section , where one of the uncertainties @xmath18 and @xmath19 can be reduced below @xmath20 at the expense of the other , _ e.g. _ in .",
    "+ these properties are of paramount importance in the real world applications on different scales as quantum stokes operators and non - classical polarization can be used for quantum information protocols and quantum communication .",

    "the direct measurement schemes for measuring these parameters are developed methods which preserve quantum noise property .",
    "looking forward to such applications , it is desirable to devise methods for generation of states with appreciable polarization squeezing .",

    "we use the most general criterion @xcite for polarization squeezing to show that in case of a polarized @xmath21 photon number state , all the three orthogonal components of stokes operator vector may be squeezed and as a matter of fact , almost all components are squeezed .",
    "we consider the polarization squeezing along a general component of stokes operator vector and show that there is polarization squeezing unless the component is either along or perpendicular to the direction of polarization of light . in section 4 , we show that after a squeezing operation like parametric amplification applied to a photon number state , squeezing is observed only in certain stokes operators in specific conditions .",
