    "there is growing evidence that a new state of hot and/or dense matter is formed in high energy heavy ion collisions at rhic @xcite .",
    "this new state of matter is thought to be made of de - confined quarks and gluons , and it is expected to behave differently from normal nuclear matter .",
    "heavy quarks ( charm and bottom ) and quarkonia are produced via hard processes in the early stage of the collisions , and they travel through the medium of partons . due to their heavy mass , heavy quarks can experience interaction with the medium in a different way from light quarks @xcite .",
    "therefore , measurements of open heavy quark yields in heavy ion collisions provide new information on the nature of the medium created at rhic .",
    "also , it is predicted that the @xmath0/@xmath1 yield will be either suppressed @xcite or enhanced @xcite in the presence of de - confined quarks and gluons .    in high energy nuclear collisions , a large fraction of electrons with transverse momentum ( @xmath5 ) larger than 1 gev/@xmath6 comes from decays of heavy quarks .",
    "thus , one can measure heavy quark production via single electrons .",
    "phenix has measured open heavy quark yields using single electrons , and @xmath0/@xmath1 yields using both di - electron and di - muon pairs , allowing a systematic study of the effects of nuclear matter on these heavy quark signals . in this article , the recent results of the heavy quark data at phenix are presented .",
    "the open heavy quark yields were studied through their electron decays .",
    "the electrons were measured in two central arms @xcite , each covering @xmath7=@xmath8/2 at mid - pseudo - rapidity ( @xmath9@xmath100.35 ) .",
    "the charged tracks were reconstructed with drift chambers and pad chambers . in each arm",
    "the electrons were identified by a ring imaging erenkov counter ( rich ) and an electromagnetic calorimeter ( emcal ) in the @xmath5 range of 0.5 to 5 gev/@xmath6 .",
    "yields of electrons coming from heavy quark decays are extracted by subtracting background electrons .",
    "the main components of the background electron yield , called  photonic electrons \" come from the dalitz decays of neutral pions and eta mesons , and from gamma conversions .",
    "all other electrons , including those from heavy quark decays , are called  non - photonic electrons \" . the backgrounds in",
    "non - photonic electrons are small , and come from di - electron decays and semi - leptonic decays of other mesons .",
    "phenix evaluates the backgrounds mainly by the following two methods . in the first method , the  converter subtraction \" method ,",
    "special data sets were taken with a thin brass cylinder ( radiation length of 1.7% ) installed around the collision vertex position .",
    "since the brass converter increases only the yield of conversion electrons , the yield and @xmath5 shapes of photonic electrons can be evaluated experimentally and precisely , especially in the low @xmath5 region .",
    "the advantage of this method is that the systematic error in the result is small .",
    "the disadvantage is that the statistical error is dominated by the data taken with the converter , about 10% of all the data . in the second method ,",
    "the  cocktail subtraction \" method , all of the background electron yields are evaluated by simulation using as input the meson and photon distributions measured by the phenix detector .",
    "this method is good to study signal electrons at high @xmath5 , where signal to background ratio is larger than unity .",
    "the results of the cocktail subtraction measurement are confirmed by those of the converter subtraction method .",
    "to study the behavior of heavy quarks in the new state of matter systematically , various data were collected in @xmath2+@xmath2 , @xmath3+au , and au+au @xcite collisions at @xmath4=200 gev , and au+au at 62 gev and 130 gev @xcite .",
    "comparison between @xmath2+@xmath2 and @xmath3+au data @xcite , shows that the @xmath5 distribution of single electrons scales with the number of binary collisions ( @xmath11 ) , within the uncertainty of the measurement .",
    "the total yield of single electrons is also found to be proportional to @xmath11 in au+au collisions .",
    "figure  [ fig.1 ] shows the au+au results @xcite , with the signal electron yield normalized by @xmath11 as a function of @xmath11 .",
    "this was also studied at 62.4 gev .",
