    "b - physics has been reserved an important role in the exciting programme to be developed at the large hadron collider or lhc along the 21st century . as an example , the atlas tdr @xcite collects a large number of topics related to charm and beauty flavours allowing precise tests of the standard model benefitting from a foreseen huge statistics even with the machine running at @xmath2low \" luminosity ( @xmath3 @xmath4 ) .    in a series of previous papers @xcite",
    "we examined charmonium hadroproduction in a monte carlo framework , using pythia 5.7 @xcite event generator with the colour - octet model ( com ) @xcite implemented in .",
    "basically , such a production mechanism is based on the formation of an intermediate coloured state during the hard partonic interaction , evolving non - perturbatively into physical heavy resonances in the final state with certain probabilities governed by nrqcd @xcite .",
    "this mechanism constitutes a ( relativistic ) generalization of the so - called colour - singlet model ( csm ) @xcite which requires the formation of a colour - singlet state in the hard interaction itself .",
    "although the discrepancies between the csm and experimental cross sections on bottomonia hadroproduction are smaller than those found for charmonia @xcite , still some extra contribution should be invoked to account for the surplus observed at the fermilab tevatron .    in this paper",
    "we extend our analysis on @xmath5 and @xmath6 hadroproduction @xcite to the bottomonium family lowest vector resonance , i.e. the @xmath0 state . once again",
    ", those matrix elements ( mes ) determined from tevatron data in other analysis @xcite have to be lowered once initial - state radiation of gluons is taken into account .",
    "this is because of the raise of the ( _ effective _ ) intrinsic momentum ( @xmath7 ) of the interacting partons enhancing the high-@xmath8 tail of the differential cross section for heavy quarkonia production ( for more details the reader is referred to ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the study of bottomonia production at hadron colliders should permit a stringent test of the colour - octet production mechanism , especially regarding the expected ( mainly transverse ) polarization of the resonance created through this process at high-@xmath8 . moreover",
    ", lhc experiments will cover a wider range of transverse momentum than at the tevatron .",
    "therefore , it is worth to estimate , as a first step , the foreseen production rate of bottomonium resonances at the lhc and this constitutes one of the goals of this work .",
    "thereby any experimental strategy to be conducted in the future ( for example a specific high - level trigger within the dedicated b - physics data - taking ) can be foreseen in advance .",
    "we have based our study on recent results from run 1b at the tevatron @xcite .",
    "this means significantly more statistics than the data sample from run 1a , employed in a former analysis @xcite .",
    "however , the different sources of prompt @xmath0 production were not yet separated along the full accessible @xmath8-range , in contrast to charmonium production .",
    "hence we give in this work numerical values for some relevant combinations of long - distance mes ( including _ direct _ and _ indirect _",
    "@xmath0 production and @xmath9 states - i.e. excluding long - lived particle decays ] ) extracted from the fit to the cdf experimental points .",
    "nevertheless , we still are able to estimate some colour - octet mes for _ direct _ production from the measurements on different production sources at @xmath10 gev @xcite .",
    "originally the event generator pythia 5.7 produces direct @xmath5 and higher @xmath11 resonances via the csm only @xcite .",
    "it is not difficult to extend this generation to the bottomonium family by redefining the resonance mass and wave function parameter accordingly . in our analysis",
    "we have besides implemented a code in the event generator to account for the colour - octet production mechanism via the following @xmath12 partonic processes of the colour - octet production cross section ) , whereas quark - antiquark scattering represents @xmath13 .",
    "these fractions are slightly larger than those found in charmonium production as could be expected from a heavier quark mass ] for heavy quarkonium production : @xmath14\\ + \\ g\\ ] ] @xmath15\\ + \\ q\\ ] ] @xmath16\\ + \\ g\\ ] ] where @xmath17 $ ] stands for a certain heavy quarkonium state denoted by its spectroscopic notation . in particular we have considered the @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 contributions as leading - order intermediate coloured states . in addition",
    "we generated @xmath0 and @xmath9 ( @xmath21 ) resonances decaying into @xmath0 according to the csm as mentioned above .",
    "a lower @xmath8 cut - off was set equal to 1 gev ( by default in pythia ) throughout the generation since some of the contributing channels are singular at vanishing transverse momentum @xcite .",
    "below we list the main parameters , including masses and branching fractions , used in our generation with pythia 5.7 .",
    "we employed the cteq2l parton distribution function ( pdf ) in all our analysis .",

    "in fact , temporarily setting @xmath37 and defining the ratio @xmath38 } { \\frac{d{\\sigma}}{dp_t}[^1s_0^{(8)}]}\\ ] ] it is found @xmath39 as a mean value over the @xmath40 $ ] gev @xmath8-range . actually the above ratio is not steady as a function of the @xmath0 transverse momentum .",
    "therefore in the generation we splitted the @xmath8 region into two domains : for @xmath41 gev we set @xmath42 whereas for @xmath43 gev we set @xmath44 .    in summary ,",
    "only the @xmath19 channel was generated but rescaled by the factor @xmath45 to incorporate the @xmath20 contribution as we did in @xcite for charmonium hadroproduction .",
    "consequently , in analogy to @xcite we shall derive a numerical estimate for the combination of the colour - octet matrix elements :    @xmath46      according to the colour - octet model , gluon fragmentation becomes the dominant source of heavy quarkonium direct production at high transverse momentum . on the other hand ,",
    "altarelli - parisi ( ap ) evolution of the splitting gluon into ( @xmath47 ) produces a depletion of its momentum and has to be properly taken into account .",
    "if not so , the resulting long - distance parameter for the @xmath18 channel would be underestimated from the fit @xcite .",

    "final hadronization into a ( @xmath47 ) bound state is taken into account by means of the colour - octet matrix elements multiplying the respective short - distance cross sections @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it is reasonable to assume that , on the average , the virtual @xmath49 should evolve at high @xmath8 similarly to the other final - state gluon - which actually is evolved by the pythia machinery .",
    "we used this fact to simulate the ( expected ) evolution of the ( ungenerated ) @xmath49 whose momentum was assumed to coincide with that of the resonance ( neglecting the effect of emission / absorption of soft gluons by the intermediate coloured state bleeding off colour @xcite ) .    therefore , event by event we get a correcting factor to be applied to the transverse mass of the @xmath50 state ( for the @xmath18 channel only ) :",
    "@xmath51    where @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) denotes the transverse momentum of the final - state gluon without ( with ) ap evolution and @xmath54 denotes the mass of the resonance . at high @xmath8 ,",
    "@xmath55 where @xmath8 is the transverse momentum of the resonance as generated by pythia ( i.e. without ap evolution ) , whereas for @xmath56 the effect becomes much less significant as it should be .",
    "thus the interpolation between low and high @xmath8 is smooth with the right asymptotic limits at both regimes .",
    "the above way to implement ap evolution may appear somewhat simple but it remains in the spirit of our whole analysis , i.e. using pythia machinery whenever possible .",
    "in fact , it provides an energy depletion of the fragmenting gluon in accordance with cho and leibovich s work for charmonium hadroproduction @xcite .",
    "it is worth to note , moreover , that the effect of the ap evolution on the generation over the [ 0,20 ] gev @xmath8-range , though sizeable , is considerably less pronounced for bottomonium than for charmonium because of the larger mass of the former .",
    "notice finally that , although we can switch on / off ap evolution and initial - state radiation _ at will _ in the generation , both next - to - leading order effects have to be incorporated for a realistic description of the hadronic dynamics of the process .",
    "as already mentioned , the theoretical differential cross section on inclusive production of prompt @xmath0 s stands above tevatron experimental points for relatively high @xmath8 if the set of long - distance parameters from @xcite are blindly employed in the pythia generation with initial - state radiation on .",
    "therefore we performed a new fit to recent cdf data , incorporating both direct and indirect production through the csm ( as a @xmath2fixed  contribution ) which , in fact , is dominant at low and even moderate @xmath8 .      in order to assess the effect of ap evolution on the fit parameters we show in table 1 two sets of numerical values for the relevant colour - octet mes obtained from a best @xmath57 fit to tevatron data @xcite using the cteq2l pdf : ( i ) the first row corresponds to a generation _ without _ ap evolution ; ( ii )",
    "the second set does take it into account .",
    "notice the increase of @xmath58 in the latter case w.r.t .",
    "ap off ( but to a lesser extent than for charmonium @xcite ) whereas @xmath59 decreases consequently to keep the fit at low and moderate @xmath8 values .",
    "let us stress that our mes numerical estimates have to be viewed with some caution because of the theoretical and @xmath2technical  ( due to the monte carlo assumptions ) uncertainties . for example",
    "our algorithm for ap evolution should be regarded as a way to reasonably steepening the high-@xmath8 tail of the ( leading - order ) differential cross section which otherwise would fall off too slowly as a function of @xmath8 .    [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     by comparison between tables 2 and 3 we can conclude that the @xmath0 indirect production from @xmath1 s decays is almost completely accounted for by the csm according to the assumptions and values of the parameters presented in section 2 . indeed , experimentally @xmath60 of @xmath0 production is due to @xmath61 and @xmath62 decays @xcite while from our generation we find a close value , namely @xmath63 , coming exclusively from colour - singlet production ! moreover , assuming that a @xmath64 from the @xmath65 fraction corresponding to the colour - octet @xmath18 contribution ( as expressed in eq .",
    "( 6 ) ) can be attributed to the @xmath66 channel in addition to the colour - singlet contribution ( @xmath67 , we obviously get the fraction @xmath68 for the latter , bringing our theoretical result into agreement with the experimental value .",
    "furthermore , this single assignment implies to reproduce very well the experimental fraction ( @xmath69 ) of direct @xmath0 production by adding the remaining @xmath18 contribution to the @xmath70 and @xmath71 channels ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "of course all the above counting was based on mean values from table 2 and subject to uncertainties . nevertheless , apart from the consistency of our generation w.r.t .",
    "experimental results under minimal assumptions , we can conclude , as an important consequence , that there is almost _ no need for _ @xmath0 indirect production from feeddown of @xmath1 states produced through _ the colour - octet mechanism_. in other words , the relative contribution from @xmath73-wave states to @xmath33 in eq .",
    "( 6 ) should be quite smaller than navely expected from nrqcd scaling rules compared to the charmonium sector , in agreement with some remarks made in @xcite .",
    "the underlying reason for this discrepancy w.r.t other analyses @xcite can be traced back to the dominant colour - singlet contribution to the cross section at @xmath8 values as much large as @xmath74 gev ( see figure 1 ) caused by the effective @xmath7 smearing - already applied to charmonium hadroproduction by one of us @xcite .    on the other hand the corresponding velocity scaling rule in the bottomonium sector is nicely verified . indeed from the value @xmath25 gev@xmath26 and the result found for @xmath75 gev@xmath26 shown in table 1 , the ratio @xmath76 is in accordance with the expected order of magnitude @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the relative velocity of the bottom quark inside bottomonium ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "bottomonium hadroproduction is especially interesting to check the validity of the colour - octet model as often emphasized in the literature @xcite . this becomes particularly clear at the lhc since experimental data will spread over a wider @xmath8-range than at the tevatron .    keeping this interest in mind",
    ", we generated prompt @xmath0 resonances in proton - proton collisions at a center - of - mass energy of 14 tev by means of our code implemented in pythia employing the same colour - octet mes of table 1 with ap evolution on .",
    "we present in figure 2 our theoretical curves for the @xmath0 differential and integrated cross sections as a function of @xmath8 , including both direct production and feeddown from higher resonance states .",
    "in figure 3 we show our prediction for _ direct _ @xmath0 production .",
    "this is especially interesting if lhc detectors will be able to discriminate among such different sources of resonance production .",
    "to this end we generated @xmath0 events through both the csm and com making use of the following parameters    * @xmath80 gev@xmath26 ( from @xcite ) * @xmath81 gev@xmath26 * @xmath82 gev@xmath26    the first value corresponds to the csm me for direct production .",
    "the @xmath58 me was obtained after removing the @xmath66 contribution according to the discussion made in section 3.1.1 , i.e. under the assumption that a fraction @xmath64 from the @xmath65 in table 3 should be assigned to indirect production .",
    "finally the @xmath59 value is based on the assumption that this channel mainly contributes to direct production .",
    "in this paper we have analyzed cdf measurements on @xmath0 production cross sections at the tevatron in a monte carlo framework .",
    "higher - order qcd effects such as initial - state radiation of gluons and ap evolution of splitting gluons into ( @xmath83 ) states were taken into account .",
    "on the other hand , since different sources of @xmath0 production were not experimentally separated along the full accessible @xmath8-range we have included all of them in the generation and later fit . only for @xmath10 gev feeddown from @xmath1 states",
    "was experimentally separated out from direct production .",
    "we used such results as a consistency check of our analysis and to draw some conclusions summarized below .",
    "the numerical value of the @xmath33 matrix element should be ascribed almost totally to @xmath84 states .",
    "this finding may be surprising when confronted with other results obtained from previous analyses @xcite , where the contribution to the @xmath85 yield through the colour - octet @xmath1 channels was thought as dominant @xcite .",
    "on the contrary , we concluded from tables 2 and 3 that the _ colour - singlet production _ by itself can account for the feeddown of @xmath0 from @xmath86 states .",
    "( notice however that experimental uncertainties still leave some room for a possible com contribution but to a much lesser extent than previously foreseen @xcite . ) on the other hand the different production channels are consistent ( or can be made consistent ) with the experimental relative fractions shown in table 2 , after some reasonable assumptions .",
    "we have extended our study to lhc collider experiments ( @xmath87 tev center - of - mass energy ) . in figure 2",
    "we present our predictions for prompt production rates ( i.e. including direct and indirect production ) while in figure 3 we show our prediction for direct production alone .",
    "lastly we conclude that the foreseen yield of @xmath0 s at lhc energy will be large enough even at high-@xmath8 to perform a detailed analysis of the colour - octet production mechanism and should be included in the b - physics programme of the lhc experiments , probably deserving ( together with charmonia ) a dedicated data - taking trigger .",
    "we acknowledge the working subgroup on @xmath88-production of the workshop on the standard model ( and more ) at the lhc , especially m. kraemer and m. mangano , for comments and valuable discussions .",
