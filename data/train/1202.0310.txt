    "observation of high - energy neutrinos of astrophysical origin would open a new window on origin of cosmic rays .",
    "neutrinos are expected at some level in association with cosmic rays , both from interactions of accelerated protons and nuclei in or near their sources and from interactions of the cosmic rays during propagation in space .",
    "production of high - energy neutrinos requires interaction of hadrons to make mesons which then decay to neutrinos .",
    "observation of neutrinos from gamma - ray sources would therefore indicate a hadronic rather than electromagnetic origin for the photons .",
    "examples of possible sources are galactic supernova remnants and extragalactic objects such as gamma - ray bursts ( grb ) and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .    in addition , wherever gamma - rays are produced by interactions of cosmic rays during their propagation , neutrinos will also be produced .",
    "examples of the latter are neutrinos related to the diffuse gamma - ray emission from the disk of the milky way  @xcite and _ cosmogenic _ neutrinos produced when cosmic rays of ultra - high energy ( uhecr ) interact with the cosmic background radiation ( cmb )  @xcite .",
    "both processes can be calculated in a straightforward way . for the galaxy ,",
    "the physics is pion production in interactions of cosmic rays with gas in the interstellar medium , and the neutrino flux follows directly from the observed diffuse gamma - radiation from the same source .",
    "the calculation of photo - pion production by protons in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) also follows from well - known physics , but in this case the level of neutrino production is highly uncertain because the ultra - high energy cosmic ray ( uhecr ) spectrum is unknown . whether there are sufficient protons above the threshold of @xmath0  ev is one of the main unanswered questions of neutrino astronomy .",
    "the discovery of neutrino oscillations  @xcite has important implications for neutrino astronomy .",
    "one expects only muon and electron neutrinos to be produced both in interactions with gas and in photo - pion production .",
    "however , the effect of oscillations on an astronomical baseline is that the initial flavor ratio evolves toward comparable numbers of all flavors for the observer .",
    "for example , for an initial flavor ratio of @xmath1 the ratio at earth would be @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "since tau neutrinos are essentially absent above @xmath3  gev in the atmospheric neutrino background , identification of a @xmath4 would be strong evidence for astrophysical origin .",
    "for this reason , the ability to distinguish neutrino flavors is important .",
    "the biggest signal is expected in the muon neutrino channel . because of the long range of high energy muons , interactions of @xmath5 outside the detector can produce muons that reach and pass through the detector . for an instrumented volume",
    "even as large as 10  km@xmath6 , the external @xmath5 events are more numerous than interactions inside the instrumented volume .",
    "the most sensitive searches use the earth as a filter against the downward background of atmospheric muons by requiring the muon track to be from below the horizon .",
    "the most basic approach to neutrino astronomy is to look for an excess of events from a particular direction in the sky .",
    "amanda , baikal , antares and icecube all make sky maps .",
    "the search can be binned or unbinned  @xcite . after accounting for the effective number of trials , no significant",
    "excess has been seen in any detector .",
    "a related approach is to look for an excess of events from a list of objects selected because they are likely neutrino sources .",

    "icecube is by far the most sensitive detector at present",
    ". published limits from icecube during construction with 40 strings installed ( ic-40 ) on specific point sources of neutrinos in the northern sky are less than @xmath7@xmath8s@xmath9tev@xmath9 . with the full icecube the sensitivity is now approaching @xmath10@xmath8s@xmath9tev@xmath9 , at which level tev gamma - rays",
    "are seen from some blazars such as mrk 401  @xcite .",
    "a related approach is to look for neutrinos correlated in time , either with each other or with a gamma - ray event  @xcite .",
    "the strongest limit from icecube in terms of constraining models that relate cosmic - ray origin with production of neutrinos is the absence of neutrinos in coincidence with grb .",
    "recently data sets from two years of icecube while the detector was still under construction ( ic-40 and ic-59 ) have been combined to obtain a significant limit  @xcite on models  @xcite in which grbs are the main source of extragalactic cosmic rays . in total 215 grbs reported by the grb coordinated network between april 5 , 2008 and may 31 , 2010 in the northern sky",
    "were included in the search .",
    "no neutrino was found during the intervals of observed gamma - ray emission .    to set limits on the model  @xcite , the expected neutrino spectrum was calculated for each burst based on parameters derived  @xcite from features in the spectrum of the grb . in particular ,",
    "a break in the observed photon spectrum marks the onset of photo - pion production by accelerated protons interacting with intense radiation fields in the grb jet .",
    "the neutrinos come from the decay of charged pions . given a predicted neutrino spectrum ,",
    "the expected number of events was calculated for each burst .",
    "the normalization of the calculation is provided by the assumptions that a fraction of the accelerated protons escape and provide the ultra - high energy cosmic rays . in the simplest case , the uhecr are injected as neutrons from the same photo - production processes in which the neutrinos are produced  @xcite . with this normalization , 8 neutrinos are expected in 215 grbs and none is observed .",

    "it is important also to search for an excess of astrophysical neutrinos from the whole sky at high energy above the steeply falling background of atmospheric neutrinos .",

    "[ fig2 ] , is from an analysis of approximately 14,000 upward neutrino - induced muons in ic-40  @xcite .",
    "this analysis proceeds by assuming a flux of neutrinos with three components : conventional atmospheric neutrinos from decay of kaons and pions ; prompt neutrinos ; and a hard spectrum of astrophysical neutrinos assumed to have an @xmath18 differential spectrum .",
    "free parameters in fitting the data are the normalization of the prompt and astrophysical neutrinos .",
    "the normalization and slope of the atmospheric neutrinos are also allowed to vary within a limited range .",
    "the result is consistent with conventional atmospheric neutrinos , with no need for a contribution from prompt neutrinos and no evidence of a hard spectrum of astrophysical neutrinos .",
    "a limitation of the analysis is that the atmospheric neutrino background is represented by a simple power law extrapolation of the calculation of ref .",

    "[ fig2 ] are several measurements of the flux of atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "the fit for atmospheric neutrinos from the ic-40 analysis that gives the diffuse limit is shown as a slightly curved band extending from 0.33 to 84  tev .",
    "the reason that the diffuse limit applies at much higher energy ( 39tev to 7 pev ) is that it assumes a hard , @xmath18 differential energy spectrum for the neutrinos , in contrast to the steep ( @xmath20 ) atmospheric spectrum .",

    "the atmospheric fluxes shown are averaged over the upward hemisphere . at high energy",
    "atmospheric neutrinos from decay of charged pions and kaons have a significant angular dependence ( the  secant theta \" effect ) with the intensity increasing toward the horizon .",
    "this angular dependence will be important in distinguishing atmospheric background from astrophysical signal in future analyses .    at the current level of sensitivity in the search for high - energy astrophysical neutrinos ,",
    "the energy range where the atmospheric neutrino background becomes important is at 100  tev and above , as illustrated by the crossover of the limits and the atmospheric fluxes in the fig .",
    "this energy is well beyond the range of detailed monte carlo calculations  @xcite , which extend only to @xmath19  tev .",
    "in addition , this is the energy range where prompt neutrinos from decay of charm and heavier flavors may become important , but the expected level of this contribution is uncertain .",
    "the spectrum of prompt neutrinos is harder by one power than the spectrum of conventional atmospheric neutrinos in this energy range , and its angular distribution is isotropic . these features mimic a diffuse astrophysical flux to some extent .",
    "a possible strategy is to determine the level of prompt lepton production with atmospheric muons which would remove the ambiguity from this contribution to the background of atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "calculations that extend the atmospheric neutrino flux up to the pev range will also need to account for the primary composition in the knee region keeping in mind that what is relevant is the spectrum of nucleons as a function of energy per nucleon .",
    "figure  [ fig2a ] summarizes searches for neutrinos of higher energy , including the region relevant for cosmogenic neutrinos . limits on the high energy side from auger  @xcite and anita  @xcite are shown as well as the results at lower energy from ic-40 . in the ic-40 analysis shown here",
    "@xcite , the strategy is to look for extremely energetic events where the atmospheric neutrino background should not be important .",
    "the greatest sensitivity in this energy range is to events near the horizon because vertically upward muons are absorbed by the earth .",
    "the contribution of @xmath4 is particularly important . for the auger analysis ,",

    "the appearance of @xmath4 depends on energy . for @xmath26  gev a charged current interaction inside icecube would give a ",
    "double bang \" event  @xcite with two separated cascades , one when the @xmath4 interacts and the other when the @xmath23 decays . at lower energy",
    "there would be a single , perhaps elongated , cascade and at higher energy a cascade plus the track of a @xmath23-lepton either entering or leaving the instrumented volume .",

    "[ fig2 ] and in fig .",
    "[ fig2a ] show a benchmark intensity , the _ waxman - bahcall limit_. current icecube limits are below the original waxman - bahcall limit  @xcite .",
    "we discuss the implications of this fact later in the section on extragalactic sources .",
    "since we have not yet detected neutrinos arriving to us from astrophysical sources we have to use the existing gamma ray data to identify sources that are likely to produce neutrinos .",
    "there are two different ways to produce neutrinos in astrophysical sources .",
    "one is from interactions of accelerated protons and nuclei on matter .",
    "all kinds of mesons are produced and the charged mesons decay to muons and neutrinos while the neutral mesons decay mostly into gamma rays .",
    "it is easy to do a rough estimate of the relation of the neutrino and gamma ray fluxes from pion decay .",
    "if the gamma ray flux from @xmath27 decay is @xmath28 the corresponding muon neutrino and antineutrino spectrum from @xmath29 decay is @xmath30 , where @xmath31 = @xmath32 . since in astrophysical environments muons usually also decay ,",
    "this flux is doubled and becomes roughly equal to the photon flux .",
    "it is also straightforward to take into account the muons and neutrinos from decay of kaons .",
    "the exact calculations are algebraically complicated because of polarization effects in muon decay  @xcite . for a power - law distribution of protons with differential index @xmath33 the ratio of @xmath21 to photons is @xmath34 for @xmath35 and @xmath36 for @xmath37",
    ". we will start with the assumption that production via proton interactions in gas contributes the most to the neutrino production in many galactic sources ( like supernova remnants and molecular clouds ) where the matter density provides enough target for nuclear interactions .",
    "neutrinos are also produced in interactions of protons with ambient photons , @xmath38 .",
    "possible photon backgrounds are those in jets of agn and gamma ray bursts ( grb ) as well as the cmb .",
    "the proton threshold energy for production of pions is @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the energy of the photon in the lab system . in the cmb",
    "( @xmath41 = 6.3@xmath4210@xmath43 ev ) the proton threshold energy , calculated with the exact cmb spectrum is 3@xmath4210@xmath44 ev .",
    "it is more difficult to estimate the threshold energy and the secondary particle spectra in agn or grb jets where the photon background spectra usually have non - thermal , typically broken power - law spectra .",
    "one can simplify the estimate by assuming that all pion photoproduction goes through the @xmath45 , i.e. @xmath46 , which is a reasonable approximation especially in the case of a steep proton spectrum interacting with thermal distribution of photons where most of the production occurs near the kinematic threshold . in the @xmath45 approximation",
    "the production of neutral pions is twice that of @xmath47 .",
    "the @xmath48-rays from @xmath49 decay would have higher energy than the neutrinos from the @xmath50 decay chain .",
    "in general , the ratio of the final energies of the @xmath48-rays to neutrinos is greater than one , but when production above the @xmath51 resonance region is important , the ratio of charged to neutral pions is increased .",
    "an essential complication from the point of view of neutrino astronomy is that gamma - rays can also be produced in purely electromagnetic processes whenever accelerated electrons are present in the sources .",
    "synchrotron radiation is important at low energy and inverse compton scattering at high energy , as well as bremsstrahlung when there is sufficient gas present to scatter the electrons .",
    "figure  [ tevc ] shows the location of galactic and extragalactic sources of tev gamma rays from the tevcat catalog  @xcite . in the following sections we discuss examples of these objects as potential neutrino sources",
    "to the extent that the diffuse gamma radiation from the plane of the milky way is due to interactions of cosmic rays with gas in the interstellar medium through the @xmath27 channel , there will be a corresponding level of diffuse neutrinos  @xcite . for power law spectra",

    "the last three objects could be seen in upgoing neutrinos from the southern hemisphere , although the neutrino fluxes from individual lbls will be difficult to detect .",
    "the actual contribution to the diffuse neutrino fluxes depends on the number of lbls and hbls in the universe .",
    "most fits to multi - wavelength spectra of agn are made with electromagnetic processes only .",
    "the low energy ( radio - x - ray ) part of the spectrum is explained as synchrotron radiation by electrons accelerated in the jets .",
    "the high energy ( gev - tev ) portion of the spectrum is fit with inverse compton scattering by the same electron population boosting background photons to high energy .",
    "the energy where the synchrotron component declines and the inverse compton component becomes more important has been noted as a characteristic feature used to characterize different classes of agn  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , in the hadronic models of agn discussed above , the high - energy portion of the gamma - ray spectrum is produced by a cascade initiated by the neutral pions produced by proton induced photoproduction .",
    "mixed hadronic / electromagnetic models are also possible since it is likely that protons as well as electrons will be accelerated .",
    "an example where observations point to acceleration of protons is the  orphan \" flare of the agn 1es 1959 + 650  @xcite .",
    "if the photon radiation at all wavelengths is driven by the accelerated electrons , then when a flare occurs both the synchrotron component and the inverse compton component should increase in unison , and this is often observed . in this case",
    "there was a normal flare in both components and later a sequence of flaring activity in the tev component only observed by whipple  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "the whipple group  @xcite reports an average flux of 0.64 in crab units over a 60 day period , which corresponds to a flux of gamma - rays with @xmath99  tev of @xmath100@xmath8s@xmath9 .",
    "if we normalize the neutrino spectrum to the gamma - ray spectrum measured at one tev , we find @xmath101 events would have been seen during this period in a kilometer scale detector . in this case , however , one can not scale the expected neutrino flux to the gamma - rays in such a simple way , as noted in the analysis of ref .  @xcite .",
    "for one thing , the gamma rays are likely to cascade in the intense electromagnetic radiation inside the source .",
    "in addition , the spectrum may be steepened by interactions with extra - galactic background light between the source and the earth .",
    "reference  @xcite addresses this problem by assuming a canonical @xmath18 spectrum for protons accelerated in the source and hence for the neutrinos , which are not absorbed in the source .",
    "they normalize the energy content of the neutrinos to the total energy in the gamma - ray spectrum , which is quite steep .",
    "the result also depends on the lorentz factor of the jet , so it is quite model dependent , but could be much larger than the estimate from a one - to - one correspondence between neutrinos and photons .",
    "the processes that may generate neutrinos in gamma ray bursts ( grb ) are not much different from these in agn jets .",
    "the main differences include the much higher lorentz factor of the grb plasma ( usually set to an average value of @xmath102 = 300 compared to 10 in agn jets ) , the short duration of the process ( 10 seconds ) , and the shape of the photon target spectrum known from the grb detections .",
    "it is a broken power spectrum .",
    "the radiation below the break ( @xmath103 = 1 mev ) follows a power law with index 1 and above the break it steepens to 2 .",
    "this shape of the target photons generates a specific neutrino spectrum .",
    "protons of energy above @xmath104 ( @xmath105 is the proton interaction threshold in the co - moving frame ) interact mostly with the lower energy flat photon spectrum , while lower energy protons can only interact with the steeper energy spectrum higher energy photons .",
    "the resulting neutrino spectrum has two breaks , one at about 10@xmath106 gev where the neutrino energy spectrum changes from e@xmath9 to e@xmath90 and another at about 10@xmath84 gev where the neutrino spectrum steepens because of the energy losses of the parent pions . in the model of ref .",
    "@xcite the middle part of the neutrino spectrum of all grb ( which are identical sources ) is @xmath107 = 3@xmath4210@xmath108 gev.@xmath8s@xmath9ster@xmath9 .",
    "the grb studies are in rapid development both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "a recent model of magnetized gamma ray bursts  @xcite predicts detectable neutrino rates for grbs containing significant magnetic fields in their jets .",
    "the magnetic field contains the protons , which are reaccelerated , while the neutrons produced in photoproduction interactions leave the jets .",
    "since their lorentz factors start to differ , the protons and neutrons interact and generate neutrinos on an almost e@xmath90 energy spectrum with an exponential cutoff at 250 gev .",
    "such neutrino spectra would produce of order one event in icecube and deep core for grbs at redshift of 0.1 .",
    "the exact flux magnitude and event rate depends strongly on the baryon load in the jet , the ratio of protons to electrons , and could be much lower .      in the discussion of potential galactic sources of neutrinos",
    ", we gave the example of @xmath48-cygni , a supernova remnant the environment of which includes molecular clouds .",
    "in the fit in which @xmath27 gamma - rays provide only part of the gamma flux , we estimated only one neutrino per year in icecube .",
    "quantitative estimates of neutrino fluxes from @xmath48-ray sources identified by milagro  @xcite with @xmath10910  tev lead to the prediction that icecube should detect the corresponding neutrinos within three years  @xcite .",
    "a condition is that these sources accelerate cosmic rays to energies of 3 pev / nucleon with a hard spectrum into the region of the knee of the spectrum .",
    "moreover , the photon flux observed in milagro is assumed here to be entirely hadronic in origin .",
    "we also discussed the neutrino flux from production of pions in the disk of the galaxy during cosmic - ray propagation .",
    "we estimate an excess of 10 neutrinos per year above the atmospheric background from a region that is 3% of the northern sky .",
    "this too will not be easy to detect as the full icecube is expected to see more than a thousand atmospheric neutrinos per year from the same solid angle .    as noted above ,",
    "one way to saturate the waxman - bahcall bound is to have the protons trapped in the acceleration region by the turbulent magnetic fields needed to make the acceleration process work .",
    "this scenario could be realized in jets of grb and of agn if acceleration occurs in internal shocks in the jets .",
    "if this class of sources is responsible for the uhecr , another implication would be that the highest energy cosmic rays should be protons .",
    "as icecube limits become increasingly strong , this class of models is constrained .",
    "an example of a model already constrained by amanda , the predecessor of icecube , is that the nearby active galaxy cen a is typical of sources that contribute to the extragalactic cosmic rays _ and _ that the cosmic rays are accelerated inside the jets .",
    "several of the highest energy events observed by auger come within a few degrees of cen a  @xcite . assuming that 2 out of 27 events with @xmath110  eev are accelerated in its jets , the corresponding neutrino production is estimated in ref .",
    "koers & tinyakov  @xcite follow through the consequences of this idea by assuming that all uhecr come from sources like cen a distributed throughout the universe .",
    "the argument schematically outlined in eq .",
    "[ diffuse ] is used to estimate the neutrino flux from all sources .",
    "the source density is normalized by requiring that the sum of all such sources give the observed uhecr spectrum .",
    "the predicted neutrino rate depends on assumptions about cosmological evolution of the sources , but even with no cosmological evolution , the level of neutrinos was comparable to the amanda limits and is clearly ruled out by the current icecube limits",
    ".    a generic alternative to acceleration of uhecr inside the jets of agn or grb could be that they are accelerated outside the jets , for example at the termination shocks of agns . in ref .",
    "@xcite , for example , agn are assumed to be the sources of extragalactic cosmic rays with the acceleration occurring at the termination shocks analogous to acceleration of galactic cosmic rays at snr . in this case",
    "the composition of the extragalactic cosmic radiation would depend on the ambient medium , and the level of neutrino production would be contingent on the density of the surrounding medium and correspondingly low .",
    "these ultrahigh energy neutrinos were suggested in 1969  @xcite soon after the discovery of cmb . the uhecr interact in the microwave background in their propagation to us and",
    "produce pions and other mesons which later decay to neutrinos , electrons and gamma rays .",
    "this source of neutrinos is independent of whether the uhecr are produced inside jets or at the termination shocks of agn or grb , or indeed from some other source altogether .",
    "the shape of the neutrino and @xmath48-ray fluxes at production are shown in fig .",
    "we only show the fluxes of neutrinos , @xmath48-rays and electrons produced in proton propagation on 200 mpc ( @xmath111= 0.05 ) , a distance within which the cascading process in cmb is completed . to obtain the total neutrino flux one has to account for the protons accelerated at earlier times and also to account for possible cosmological evolution on the proton accelerators .",
    "spectrum on 200 mpc . ]",
    "the peaks of the spectra around 10@xmath97 - 10@xmath44 ev are due to the muon neutrinos and antineutrinos generated in the meson and muon decays and to the neutral meson decays into @xmath48-rays .",
    "the lower energy peaks just above 10@xmath112 ev are due to @xmath113 and electrons from neutron decay .",
    "the peak @xmath48-ray energy is higher roughly by a factor of two than those of the @xmath5 , @xmath98 and @xmath25 because the neutral pions decay in 2@xmath48-rays while the charged pions decay to 3 neutrinos and one electron .    the exact flux of these _ cosmogenic _ neutrinos depends on many factors , such as    * the total emissivity of the universe in uhe cosmic rays , usually expressed in ergs / mpc@xmath6/year . * the average acceleration spectrum of these particles .",
    "the flatter the spectrum is the more uhecr can interact in the cmb . * the maximum acceleration energy in the uhecr sources . * the cosmological evolution of the uhecr sources . * the chemical composition of uhecr .",
    "if the highest energy cosmic rays are heavy nuclei , as suggested by the auger observatory measurements up to 50 eev , the energy spectrum of individual nucleons will cut off at relatively low energy which will decrease the fluxes of the @xmath11410@xmath97 ev neutrinos .",
    "the flux of 10@xmath112 ev @xmath113 will increase because of the decay of neutrons from the spallation of the nuclei .        when calculated with the same input that waxman & bahcall used  @xcite the flux of cosmogenic neutrinos",
    "touches the limit at the maximum of the muon neutrinos and antineutrinos and is generally lower at higher and lower energies  @xcite .",
    "the contemporary measurements of the uhecr spectrum show lower total emissivity and steeper acceleration spectrum than used in ref .",
    "@xcite which significantly decreases the expectations for cosmogenic neutrinos unless  @xcite the cosmological evolution of the uhecr sources is extremely strong .",
    "associated with the production of neutrinos during their propagation in the cosmos is the predicted steepening of the spectrum above @xmath115  eev , often referred to as the _ gzk effect _ after the initials of the authors of the original papers  @xcite .",
    "a question that remains open is whether the observed steepening is the gzk effect ( as often assumed ) or whether it is simply the sources of uhecr reaching their maximum energy . in this connection",
    "it is relevant to recall the hillas diagram  @xcite which illustrates the difficulty of accelerating particles to @xmath3  eev . as an illustration of the importance of this point for neutrino astronomy ,",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ f326 ] how the predicted fluxes of cosmogenic @xmath21 depend on maximum energy assumed at the sources .",
    "muon neutrinos and antineutrinos are generated in proton propagation over 200 mpc .",
    "the spectral index @xmath33 = 2.5 and there is an exponential decline of the flux at different values of @xmath116 from 21.5 to 19.5  ev / nucleon .",
    "there are two effects : the maximum of the neutrino flux moves to lower energy when e@xmath117 decreases , and the total flux of cosmogenic neutrinos also decreases .",
    "while the maximum neutrino flux for @xmath118 = 21.5 is at 2@xmath4210@xmath119 it decreases to 5@xmath4210@xmath120 for @xmath118 = 19.5 .",
    "there are no cosmogenic muon neutrinos and antineutrinos generated in the local universe if @xmath118 = 19 .",
    "the full icecube detector has been operating since may , 2010 .",
    "this means that the integrated exposure under analysis will increase quickly compared to approximately one km@xmath6 year from ic-40 and ic-59 currently under analysis . on the horizon",

    "the goal is to achieve sensitivity corresponding to @xmath121  km@xmath71 area sensitive to cosmogenic ( gzk ) neutrinos .",
    "an important modification of the original plan of icecube was the installation of 8 specially instrumented strings with their optical modules concentrated in the deep , clearest ice in between the 7 standard strings in the center of icecube .",
    "together these 15 strings form the deepcore of icecube  @xcite .",
    "the full year of deepcore data in 2010 - 2011 with 73 standard strings and 6 special stings in place has already been analyzed  @xcite . by using the surrounding detectors of icecube to veto atmospheric muons ,",
    "it has been possible for the first time to identify neutrino - induced cascade event in icecube .",
    "these are interactions with a mean energy of @xmath122  gev that include charged current interactions of electron neutrinos and neutral current interactions of all flavors .",
