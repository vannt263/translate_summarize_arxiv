    "the study of the statistics of magnetic fluctuations excited by a random gaussian white - noise - like advecting velocity field , was pioneered by kazantsev  @xcite , and , in more recent times , has generated a considerable amount of research ( see , e.  g. , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein , as well as refs .",
    "while much attention has concentrated on resistive dynamo problems , most often for very large magnetic prandtl numbers , it is well known that the fundamental zeldovich s , or `` stretch  twist  fold , '' mechanism of the magnetic - energy amplification ( the so - called `` fast dynamo '' ) is active regardless of the presence of the resistive ( diffusive ) regularization  @xcite .",
    "if the initial seed magnetic field is concentrated on the scales of the same order as the characteristic scales of the advecting velocity , the stretching and folding of the magnetic - field lines by the random flow leads to an exponential growth of the magnetic fluctuations at scales that decrease exponentially fast , until the diffusive scales are reached  @xcite .",
    "this scenario is common in astrophysical applications such as the turbulence in the interstellar medium or in the protogalaxy where the prandtl number ranges from  @xmath4 to  @xmath5 , giving rise to  7 to  11 decades of small ( subviscous ) scales available to the magnetic fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the initial diffusion - free regime may well be the only one practically important in such applications as far as the kinematic approximation is concerned , since the nonlinear saturation effects are likely to set in before the diffusion scales are reached  @xcite . on the fundamental physical level ,",
    "the diffusion - free regime , in which the magnetic - field lines are fully frozen into the flow , exhibits most clearly the underlying symmetry properties of the passive advection  @xcite .    with a few notable exceptions ( such as refs .",
    "@xcite ) , the dominant approach in the existing literature on the turbulent kinematic dynamo problem has been to study the statistics of passive magnetic fields advected by a flow @xmath6 whose two - time correlation function is approximated by a @xmath0 function , @xmath7 .",
    "this white - noise property of the velocity greatly simplifies matters : the evolution equations for such statistical quantities as the correlation functions and probability density function of the magnetic field can be derived in closed form and yield themselves to exact solution .    in this paper , we relax the white - noise assumption and explore the effects that arise when a finite - time correlated velocity field is introduced .",
    "this immediately raises the level of difficulty associated with solving the statistical problem . within the theoretical framework adopted here",
    ", the difficulty can be described in the following terms . in the zero - correlation - time approximation ,",
    "one essentially has to deal with only one closed differential equation that fully determines the desired statistics .",
    "allowing for a finite velocity correlation time leads to an infinite number of interlinked integro - differential equations involving time - history integrals .",
    "these equations form an infinite open hierarchy that formally constitutes the exact description of the problem ( these matters are explained in more detail in  ) . solving this hierarchy in its entirety without additional assumptions",
    "appears to be an impossible task .",
    "the most obvious way to make progress is clearly to try a perturbative approach , i.e. , to consider the kinematic dynamo problem with an advecting field whose correlation time is short , but finite .",
    "if the correlation time  @xmath8 is assumed to be small , one can expect to be able to construct an expansion in the powers of  @xmath8 ( in what follows , we will frequently refer to it as _ the @xmath9  expansion _ ) and calculate corrections to the growth rates of the moments of the magnetic field .",
    "this is the program that we undertake here .",
    "we consider the one - point statistics of the passive magnetic field in the diffusion - free regime . in this context",
    ", the infinite hierarchy we have mentioned above interrelates the one - point probability density function  ( pdf ) of the magnetic field and an infinite set of response functionals .",
    "these are averaged multiple functional derivatives of the magnetic field with respect to the velocity field and its gradients .",
    "we develop a _ functional expansion method _ that allows us to calculate successive terms in the @xmath9  expansion and derive in a closed form a fokker ",
    "planck equation for the one - point  pdf of the magnetic field .",
    "we limit ourselves to advancing the expansion one order beyond the zero - correlation - time approximation .",
    "the result is a set of corrections to the growth rates of all moments of the magnetic field .",
    "these corrections are negative , so the growth rates are reduced .",
    "the expansion is carried out assuming that the velocity correlation time is small and keeping the time integral of the velocity correlation function fixed .",
    "the latter constraint ensures that the dynamo growth rate remains finite when the correlation time vanishes .",
    "an alternative way , which is sometimes deemed preferable on physical grounds ( see , e.g , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , is to fix the total energy of the velocity field .",
    "since a @xmath0-correlated velocity field must necessarily possess infinite energy , fixing the energy at a finite value leads to vanishing of the growth rates when  @xmath10 .",
    "the _ relative _ ordering of the terms in the expansion is , however , the same , regardless of what is kept fixed , so the technical side of the expansion method is unaffected .    our expansion technique will be given detailed treatment in the body of this paper . here",
    ", let us rather discuss the finite - correlation - time effects that can be distilled on the basis of our approach .",
    "as it turns out , a number of new interesting phenomena manifest themselves already at the level of the short - but - finite - correlation - time approximation .    in the case of the @xmath0-correlated advecting flow ,",
    "the one - point statistics of the passive magnetic field are _ universal _ in the sense that they only depend on one small - scale property of the velocity : the time integral of the one - point correlation tensor of its gradients , @xmath11 .",
    "the essential novelty in the case of finite correlation time is that this small - scale universality is lost on two accounts .",
    "first , the @xmath9  expansion exhibits a sensitive dependence on the specific shape of the time - correlation profile of the velocity field ( in recent literature , this was first explicitly pointed out by boldyrev  @xcite ; see also refs .",
    "namely , multiple time integrals of products of velocity correlation functions enter the expressions for the expansion coefficients . choosing different correlation profiles",
    "leads to order - one changes in the values of these coefficients .",
    "the root of this nonuniversality lies in the topology of the vertex - correction diagrams that contribute to the orders higher than the zeroth in the @xmath9  expansion ( see  ) .",
    "second , the first - order terms of the @xmath9  expansion feature a part that arises from the _ fourth - order _ derivatives of the velocity correlation function , i.e. , from the second derivatives of the velocity field . in the one - point statistical approach",
    ", this is the first manifestation of the more general tendency that introducing finite correlation times brings into play the large - scale structure of the velocity field .",
    "a related effect is the loss of galilean invariance due to the fact that the expansion terms also depend on the actual _ energy _ of the velocity field , i.e. , on the rms value of the sweeping velocity . indeed , now that the trajectories of the fluid elements have a `` memory '' of themselves , which extends approximately one  @xmath8 back in time",
    ", we should naturally expect that there will appear an effective `` correlation length '' of the velocity ( in what regards the one - point statistics of the fields it advects ) approximately equal to  @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , the one - point statistics of the passive fields now depend not only on the instantaneous velocity difference between two fluid particles that meet at a given time ( i.e. , the velocity gradient at a point ) , but also on the velocity that swept them into place and on the variation of the velocity gradient over the correlation length .",
    "this appearance of first - order corrections due to the second derivatives of the flow is a new effect , which indicates , in particular , that the customary approximation used in the batchelor regime , where the advecting velocity is assumed to be locally linear  @xcite , is only justified for the @xmath0-correlated - in - time advecting fields .    such are the main qualitative consequences of introducing a finite - time - correlated velocity field into the kinematic dynamo problem ( or , in general , any passive - advection model ) .",
    "a few words are in order as to the quantitative impact of a finite correlation time on the dynamo action .",
    "as we have already mentioned , the effect of the first - order corrections is to reduce the growth rates of all moments of the magnetic field . besides the nonuniversal dependence on the spatial and temporal structure of the velocity correlation function",
    ", the reduction depends in a universally calculable way on the usual set of parameters : the order of the moment , the dimension of space , and the degree of compressibility of the flow .",
    "the overall magnitude of this reductive effect is measured by the expansion parameter , which is of the order of  @xmath13 , where @xmath14  is the growth rate of the magnetic energy .",
    "it is not hard to demonstrate ( see  ) that  @xmath15 , where @xmath16  is the `` eddy - turnover '' time of the advecting turbulent velocity field and @xmath1  is the dimension of space . in a standard kolmogorov - type turbulence setting , one would , of course , expect any such approximation to be valid at best marginally , since @xmath17 .",
    "astrophysical plasmas offer more variety in this respect , as their driving forces ( typically supernova explosions ) can , in fact , decorrelate faster than the turbulent eddies turn over  @xcite . in any event , the small-@xmath8 expansion does not offer much more than qualitative , or , at best , semiquantitative , information about the way the dynamo action is modified by the finiteness of the correlation time .",
    "it is , of course , clear that introducing a finite correlation time can not altogether suppress the fast - dynamo mechanism  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "our conclusion that some reduction of the growth rate should be expected , is corroborated by numerical evidence  @xcite that suggests a reduction of about  40% to  50% .",
    "in fact , in  , we offer a semiquantitative evaluation of the finite-@xmath8 correction to the growth rate which yields a reduction of approximately  40% in the three - dimensional case and for  @xmath18 .",
    "of course , this is at best just an indication of the well - behaved character of our expansion , rather than a truly solid quantitative confirmation of  it .",
    "the literature on the @xmath9  expansion and finite - correlation - time effects is not extensive .",
    "kliatskin and tatarskii  @xcite were the first to propose the hierarchy of equations for the response functionals as a starting point for a method of successive approximations as applied to the description of waves propagating in a medium with random inhomogeneities .",
    "vainshtein  @xcite applied this method to the mean - field kinematic dynamo theory .",
    "the kliatskin  tatarskii method and its relation to our functional expansion method are discussed at the end of  .",
    "van  kampen  @xcite and terwiel  @xcite developed the so - called cumulant expansion method ; van  kampen s review article  @xcite also contains a good critical survey of other @xmath9-expansion schemes predating his work .",
    "his method was later applied in the kinematic - dynamo context by knobloch  @xcite and chandran  @xcite .",
    "their treatment was lagrangian and did not include any effects due to the explicit spatial dependence in the induction equation .",
    "consequently , the nonuniversality of the @xmath9  expansion with respect to the spatial structure of the velocity correlator was not captured .",
    "the van  kampen method is discussed in detail in  .",
    "parallel to our development of the functional expansion method , boldyrev  @xcite proposed a @xmath9-expansion method that was based on the exact solution of the induction equation in the lagrangian frame and offered a way to calculate the second moment of the magnetic field that elicited the nonuniversal character of the @xmath9  expansion with respect to both temporal and spatial properties of the velocity correlation tensor .",
    "molchanov , ruzmaikin , and sokoloff  @xcite considered the statistics of the kinematic dynamo in a renovating flow using the formalism of infinite products of random matrices .",
    "( see also  ref .",
    "@xcite for the treatment of the kinematic mean - field dynamo in a renovating flow . ) a version of their approach was later advanced by gruzinov , cowley , and sudan  @xcite .",
    "considerable progress was achieved in a nonperturbative way by chertkov _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , who studied the passive - scalar problem in two dimensions for arbitrary velocity correlation times .",
    "however , their method only works in the two - dimensional case .",
    "thus , while we now seem to have a fairly good understanding of the structure of the @xmath9  expansion and such qualitative features as the loss of the small - scale universality , an adequate nonperturbative theory of the kinematic dynamo and passive advection in finite - time - correlated turbulent velocity fields remains an open problem .    this paper is organized in the following way . in",
    ", our functional expansion method is systematically developed on the example of the simplest available passive - advection problem : that of the lagrangian passive vector in an incompressible flow . in this model ,",
    "no explicit spatial dependence is present . in  , , and",
    ", we present a functional formalism that allows one to systematically construct successive terms in the @xmath9-expanded fokker ",
    "planck equation .",
    "the dependence of the expansion coefficients on the specific functional form of the velocity time correlation profile emerges .",
    "the expansion is carried out up to the first order in  @xmath8 . in  , our method is compared with the van  kampen cumulant expansion method  @xcite .",
    "we ascertain that results obtained via the van  kampen method are consistent with ours .",
    "finally , in  , we discuss the underlying structure of the @xmath9  expansion in diagrammatic terms . in  ,",
    "the general arbitrarily compressible space - dependent dynamo problem is solved with the aid of the functional expansion . at this level ,",
    "the nonuniversality with respect to the spatial structure of the velocity correlations , as well as the loss of galilean invariance , become evident . in",
    ", we explain the emergence of an infinite hierarchy of equations for the characteristic function and various averaged response functionals of the magnetic field in the passive dynamo problem with finite - time - correlated advecting flow .",
    "the hierarchy is advanced up to the emergence of the second - order response functions . in",
    ", we construct the @xmath9  expansion up to first order in the correlation time , which leads to a closed equation for the characteristic function of the magnetic field . in",
    ", we derive the fokker ",
    "planck equation for the one - point  pdf of the magnetic - field strength valid to first order in the correlation time .",
    "the distribution is lognormal . in",
    ", we calculate the rates of growth of all moments of the magnetic field with ( negative ) first - order corrections .",
    "finally , in  , we give a semiquantitative argument that relates the expansion parameter to the ratio of the correlation and eddy - turnover times of the velocity field .",
    "we also evaluate the finite-@xmath8 reduction of the magnetic - energy growth rate in a model incompressible turbulence consisting of eddies of a fixed size . in",
    ", we provide the basic relations that allow one to express the results we have obtained in the configuration space in terms of the spectral characteristics of the velocity field .",
    "some of the more cumbersome technical details of the @xmath9  expansion are exiled to  .",
    "in this section , we explain the gaussian functional method for constructing the short - correlation - time expansion for passive  advection problems . working out such expansions for specific problems",
    "often involves a fair amount of algebra , which tends to obscure the otherwise transparent ideas behind them . in an attempt at the maximum possible clarity of exposition , we first consider a model that , while preserving most of the essential features of the passive - advection problems , offers much greater technical simplicity .",
    "namely , let us consider the following stochastic equation in @xmath1  dimensions : [ model_b ] b^i = ^i_k b^k .",
    "all the fields involved explicitly depend on time only .",
    "the specific initial distribution of  @xmath19 is not important for the derivation or the validity of the results below .",
    "spatial isotropy is always assumed . the matrix field  @xmath20 is gaussian with zero mean and a given two - point correlation tensor : [ model_sigma ] = t^ij_kl(t - t ) , + t^ij_kl = ^ij_kl + a(^i_k^j_l + ^i_l^j_k),a = -1/(d+1 ) .",
    "these equations can be interpreted to describe the evolution of a passive magnetic field in a lagrangian frame , where the lagrangian advecting velocity field is gaussian and incompressible , and the tensor  @xmath21 is its gradient matrix . in the more general context of the theory of passive advection , equations   and   model the stochastic dynamics of a vector connecting two lagrangian tracer particles in an ideal fluid .",
    "we assume that the temporal correlation function  @xmath22 of  @xmath20 has a certain characteristic width  @xmath8 , i.e. , the field  @xmath20 possesses a correlation time  @xmath8 .",
    "our task in this section is to construct an expansion of the statistics of  @xmath23 in powers of  @xmath8 , which is assumed to be small .",
    "the limit  @xmath24 ought to be taken in such a way that the time integral of the correlation function is kept constant : [ kbar_const ] _",
    "0^ ( ) = 2 = const 1 .",
    "the white - noise limit of zero correlation time is realized by setting  @xmath25 .",
    "the first step in our averaging scheme is to define the characteristic function of the field  @xmath23 , [ model_z ] z(t ; ) = = .",
    "here and in what follows , the overtildes designate unaveraged random functions . upon differentiating  @xmath26 with respect to time and making use of  , we obtain a new stochastic equation : [ model_eq_ztilde ] = ^i_k_i_k = ^k_i^i_k , where the auxiliary operator  @xmath27 has been introduced for the sake of notational compactness .",
    "our objective now is to learn how to obtain a closed equation for the averaged characteristic function  @xmath28 , i.e. , how to average   when  @xmath21 has a nonzero correlation time .",
    "the inverse fourier transform ( with respect to  @xmath29 ) of the resulting equation will be the fokker ",
    "planck equation for the pdf  @xmath30 of the passive field  @xmath19 .",
    "we start the construction of the functional expansion by developing an exact formalism that describes the one - point statistics of the field  @xmath23 .",
    "let us average both sides of   and `` split '' the mixed average that arises on the right - hand side with the aid of the well - known furutsu ",
    "novikov ( or `` gaussian - integration '' ) formula  @xcite : [ model_eq_z ] z(t ) = ^k_i = ^k_i t^i_k_0^tt(t - t)g^_(t|t ) , where we have suppressed the  @xmath31 s in the arguments , used the formula   for the second - order correlation tensor of  @xmath20 , and introduced the _ averaged first - order response function : _ [ def_g1 ]",
    "g^_(t|t ) = = .",

    "we have thus obtained the equal - time form of  @xmath38 . in order to determine the response function at  @xmath39",
    ", we simply take the functional derivative  @xmath36 of both sides of   and find that each element of the unaveraged tensor  @xmath40 satisfies an equation identical in form to  . upon averaging this",
    ", we obtain an evolution equation for  @xmath38 subject to the initial condition   at  @xmath41 : [ g1_eq ] g^_(t|t ) = ^l_j .",

    "an infinite linked hierarchy can be constructed by further iterating this procedure and introducing response functions of ascending orders .",

    "define the _ @xmath46th - order averaged response function : _ [ def_gn ] g^_1  _n__1  _n(t|t_1,  ,t_n ) = .",
    "this function has two essential properties : ( i ) it is causal : @xmath47 if any  @xmath48 ; ( ii ) it remains invariant under all simultaneous permutations of the times @xmath49 and indices @xmath50 , @xmath51 , which correspond to changes of the order of functional differentiation in the definition  .",
    "the @xmath46th - order response function satisfies the following recursive relations : if  @xmath52 , [ gn_eq ] g^_1  _n__1  _n(t|t_1  t_n ) = ^k_i t^i_n+1_k_n+1_0^tt_n+1(t - t_n+1 ) g^_1  _n+1__1  _n+1(t|t_1  t_n+1 ) ; if , say , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , [ gn_tt ] g^_1  _n-1_n__1  _n-1_n(t|t_1  t_n-1,t ) = ^_n__n g^_1  _n-1__1  _n-1(t|t_1  t_n-1 ) .",
    "the hierarchy is `` forward '' at different times and `` backward '' at equal times .",
    "the characteristic function  @xmath45 is formally treated as the zeroth - order response function .",
    "the white - noise approximation is obtained by setting  @xmath55 .",
    "we are then left with just  , where the time history integral reduces to  @xmath56 , which is substituted from  .",
    "this produces a closed evolution equation for  @xmath45 .",
    "the fourier transform of it is the fokker ",

    "to be not overly burdened by notation , we typically use the same symbol for denoting an operator in the fourier space of the  @xmath31 s and its analog in the configuration space of the  @xmath57 s .",

    "the operator  @xmath61 in   can therefore be written in the following isotropic form : [ def_l_iso ] = t^i_k ^k_i ^_= d-1d+1@xmath62 , which turns   into the familiar fokker ",

    "@xcite , the lagrangian and eulerian statistics are the same for the @xmath0-correlated incompressible flow .    thus , the solution in the @xmath0-correlated limit is quite elementary .",
    "things become much more complicated once the white - noise assumption is relaxed and a nonzero , however small , velocity correlation time is introduced .      in order to construct an expansion in small correlation time ,",

    "after that , or if the prandtl number is of order unity or small ( as is , e.g. , the case for the sun ) , resistive effects must be taken into account . in this case , the calculation of the moments of the magnetic field via the fokker  planck equation for its  pdf as presented in this section does not apply because of the closure problem associated with the diffusion term [ the equations for  @xmath182 and  @xmath28 do not close ] .",
    "however , the general @xmath9-expansion method proposed in this paper can , in principle , be applied to multipoint correlators of the magnetic field , for which treating the diffusive case presents no conceptual difficulty .",
    "one - point moments can then be obtained by fusing the points at which the multipoint correlators are taken  ( cf .",
    "although it is the diffusive case that is studied in most numerical simulations , where @xmath183 rarely exceeds  @xmath184 , it is not necessarily the most relevant one in the context of the ( proto)galactic dynamo , for which @xmath185 . indeed , as we already pointed out in the introduction , the initial ( proto)galactic seed field may well be strong enough for the kinematic approximation to break down while the dynamo is still in the diffusion - free stage  @xcite . if this is the case , the effect of magnetic diffusion must be studied in conjunction with nonlinear saturation of the magnetic fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "in real astrophysical environments , such as the interstellar medium and the protogalactic plasmas , the magnetic fields are acted upon by a kolmogorov - like turbulence with a fully developed inertial range about three decades wide ( @xmath186 ) . while the velocities of the turbulent eddies excited by the kolmogorov cascade decrease with the scale of the eddy , the velocity gradients increase ( see , e.g. ,  ref .",
    "therefore , the dominant role in the process of amplification of the small - scale magnetic fluctuations is played by the smallest eddies . with this circumstance in mind ,",
    "one often considers , for modeling purposes , a synthetic incompressible turbulent velocity field consisting of eddies all of which have the same fixed size but random isotropic orientation ( for detailed discussions of the galactic and protogalactic dynamo , we refer the reader to  refs .",

    ", we will present a brief discussion of the implications of the @xmath9-expansion theory developed in   for such a model problem , which will henceforth be referred to as the _ one - eddy model_.    the velocity field in the one - eddy model is specified as follows : ^i(t , ) & = & e^i^i(t , ) , where the fourier modes  @xmath187 are random variables that satisfy & = & ( 2)^d(+ ) @xmath188(k - k_0)(t - t ) . in this case , @xmath189 , and , upon using the relations listed in  , we  get [ kappa0_kappa2 ] _ 0 ( ) & = & 1k_0 ^ 2(d-1)(d+2)d+1_2 ( ) , + [ kappa4_kappa2 ] _ 4 ( ) & = & k_0 ^ 2d+32(d+4)(d+1)_2 ( ) .",

    "@xcite ) , the coefficients of the @xmath9  expansion   are  @xmath191 .",
    "the relations   and   provide the value of  @xmath164 : [ tk2_k ] _ 2 = ( d-1)(d+2)(d+3)2(d+1)^2(d+4)k_2 .",
    "let us define the `` eddy - turnover '' time  @xmath192 of such a velocity field according to the following relation : [ deff_teddy_k ] 1 ^ 2 = k_0 ^ 21 _ -^+^ii(,=0 ) = k_0 ^ 2d_0 = d(d-1)(d+2)d+1_2 , where we have used   to express @xmath193 in terms of  @xmath194 .",
    "note that the same expression is obtained if @xmath195  is formally defined in terms of the velocity gradients ( without recourse to the one - eddy model ) : [ deff_teddy_x ] 1 ^ 2 = 1 _ -^+|^ii_,jj(,=0)| = d(d-1)(d+2)d+1_2 .",
    "we recall that the zeroth - order growth rate  @xmath196 of the magnetic - fluctuation energy  @xmath197 is  [ see formula  ] [ deff_gamma ] _ 0 = ( d-1)(d+2)d+1_2 . formulas   and   then imply [ small_param ] @xmath198 ^ 2 = _ 0 d = ( d-1)(d+2)d+1_2 d. we have established a correspondence between the small parameter that has arisen in our expansion of the dynamo growth rates and the `` physical '' small parameter , which is the ratio of the correlation and eddy - turnover times .",
    "of course , the above expression hinges on the definitions   or   of  @xmath16 .",
    "a simple physical argument can be made in favor of these definitions and the resulting formula  .",
    "namely , let us observe that when  @xmath18 the eddy only stretches the magnetic field line in one of the  @xmath1 available directions during one turnover time , whence  @xmath199 .",
    "the same estimate follows from the formula  .",
    "let us now evaluate the first - order correction to the growth rate of the magnetic energy . in the one - eddy model , one gets , upon using formulas   and   and taking  @xmath191 for the ornstein  uhlenbeck time - correlation profile  , [ exp_gamma ] = ( 2 ) = _ 0(1 - c_d_0 d ) , c_d = 2d(d+1)-12d(d-1)(d+2 ) .",
    "we note that in three dimensions , @xmath200 .",
    "when  @xmath18 , we have @xmath201 , and the resulting growth - rate reduction of  @xmath202 is in a good qualitative agreement with the available numerical results  @xcite . of course , as we have already stressed in the introduction , our @xmath9  expansion is not designed for the case of  @xmath18 , so the fact that it gives a fairly reasonable prediction should not be considered as an adequate quantitative corroboration of our theory .",
    "at best , one might conclude that the first - order expansion is well behaved for not - too - small values of the expansion parameter .",
    "let us emphasize , however , that such a well - behaved expression has resulted from a number of essentially arbitrary ( albeit physically reasonable ) specifications of the parameters involved in the @xmath9  expansion .",
    "one of the most physically important points that we have tried to make in this work is , in fact , that the inclusion of finite - correlation - time effects leads to _ nonuniversal _ statistics , so the quantitative predictions of the theory can and will change appreciably if such factors as the shapes of the time - correlation profiles are changed .",
    "namely , one would obtain expressions of the form   with different values of the coefficient  @xmath203 .",
    "for sufficiently large values of  @xmath204 , the validity of the expansion   will break down , and the expression in the brackets may even become negative .",
    "however , the following heuristic argument can be envisioned in this context .",
    "let us recall that the finite - correlation - time effect was due to the presence of time - history integrals such as those that appear in the equations  , , and  .",
    "the first - order corrections in the fokker ",
    "planck equation   arose from systematically approximating the time evolution of the statistical quantities [ response functions and characteristic function  @xmath28 ] that entered these time - history integrals .",
    "the corrected ( `` true '' ) value of  @xmath14 represents , in a rough way , the rate at which these quantities change .",
    "it would appear then that a better estimate of  @xmath14 would be obtained if  @xmath196 in the first - order term in the brackets in   were replaced with the corrected value  @xmath14 . with this caveat",
    ", we would find  that  @xcite = _ 01 + c_d_0 d. to first order , this formula is equally accurate as  .",
    "however , it better represents the fact that , as @xmath204  increases , the corrected value of of the growth rate should be expected to saturate  @xcite .",
    "of course , such considerations can not substitute for an adequate nonperturbative theory of the passive advection and kinematic dynamo in finite - time - correlated flows , which remains an open problem .",
    "the authors would like thank s.  a.  boldyrev for extensive and very fruitful discussions of the physics and the formalism of the finite - time - correlated kinematic dynamo problem .",
    "both the substance and the style of the presentation have benefited from suggestions made by j.  a.  krommes who read an earlier manuscript of this work .",

    "in this appendix , we list the basic formulas that relate the coefficients of the small - scale expansion   of the velocity correlation tensor to the spectral characteristics of the velocity field .",
    "these relations allow one to apply the results on the small-@xmath8 expansion obtained in   to velocity fields that are specified in the fourier , rather than configuration , space .",

    "<S> most of the theoretical results on the kinematic amplification of small - scale magnetic fluctuations by turbulence have been confined to the model of white - noise - like ( @xmath0-correlated in time ) advecting turbulent velocity field . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> the statistics of the passive magnetic field in the diffusion - free regime are considered for the case when the advecting flow is finite - time correlated . </S>",
    "<S> a new method is developed that allows one to systematically construct the correlation - time expansion for statistical characteristics of the field such as its probability density function or the complete set of its moments . </S>",
    "<S> the expansion is valid provided the velocity correlation time is smaller than the characteristic growth time of the magnetic fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> this expansion is carried out up to first order in the general case of a @xmath1-dimensional arbitrarily compressible advecting flow . </S>",
    "<S> the growth rates for all moments of the magnetic - field strength are derived . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of the first - order corrections due to the finite correlation time is to reduce these growth rates . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that introducing a finite correlation time leads to the loss of the small - scale statistical universality , which was present in the limit of the @xmath0-correlated velocity field . </S>",
    "<S> namely , the shape of the velocity time - correlation profile and the large - scale spatial structure of the flow become important . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is a new effect , that implies , in particular , that the approximation of a locally - linear shear flow does not fully capture the effect of nonvanishing correlation time . </S>",
    "<S> physical applications of this theory include the small - scale kinematic dynamo in the interstellar medium and protogalactic plasmas .    </S>",
