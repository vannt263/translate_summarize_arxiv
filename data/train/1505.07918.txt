    "energy storage is a major challenge in present times to meet the demand of consistent power supply , both in the portable devices like laptops , cameras , cellphone , etc . , and in the bigger devices like electric vehicles , backup inverters , etc .",
    "additionally , increase in the cost of fuel and increase in green house gases have given rise to the hybrid electric vehicle technology with battery supplement , known as plugin hybrid electric vehicle ( phev).@xcite for several years , phevs and many other appliances , lithium batteries have been considered to be optimum candidates for rechargeable battery technology .",
    "although li metal has a high theoretical capacity of @xmath03842 , rechargeable lithium batteries can not use the bulk lithium metal due to safety issues , dendritic growth , rapid decay and small recycling time.@xcite to overcome these problems many other materials and structure have been investigated , e.g. , metal oxide such as licoo@xmath1 , lifepo@xmath2 and limno@xmath1,@xcite where li atoms can be stored in layers within these metal oxides .",
    "however , these materials are found to have very small practical capacities of 140 , 170 and 119 , respectively . whereas , graphite with theoretical capacity of @xmath0372 is used as conventional anode .",
    "recently , significant work is being done to enhance the capacities of anodes as well as cathodes using the carbon based materials,@xcite like a composite anode based on carbon and silicon with a specific capacity of @xmath01000 has been proposed.@xcite similarly , a few more works@xcite also shows a hike in the capacity of the li storage on graphene porous networks with stone - wales ( sw ) and divacancy ( dv ) defects .",
    "they reported an experimental capacity of 850 , whereas theoretical calculation predict capacities of 698 and 590 with 75% sw and 16% dv defects , respectively .",
    "although even higher capacities with 100% sw and 25% dv defects are predicted from the calculation , creating graphene sheets with such a high percentage of defects is difficult and energetically unfavourable .",
    "for example , formation energies of sw defect is @xmath05 ev@xcite and it is formed by rapid quenching from high temperature under the radiation of 90 - 100 ev of electron energy .",
    "similarly , formation energies of single- and di - vacancies in graphene sheet are @xmath07.5 ev and @xmath08 ev , respectively.@xcite although dv are thermodynamically more stable than single vacancy at high temperature , these vacancies are practically immobile.@xcite additionally , removal of a large number of atoms can lead to the bending and wrapping of the sheet destroying its electronic properties . to overcome the problem , as well as taking the advantage of the fact that graphene sheet with non - stoichiometric nature can increase the lithiation potential ( lp )",
    ", we investigated the lithium adsorption over graphene oxide ( go ) .",
    "interestingly , we find a positive lp on these functionalized graphene sheets suggesting a favourable adsorption of li on go leading to the specific capacity of @xmath0860 .",
    "the most notable aspect of our proposed system is that it is simple and cost effective to prepare .",
    "functionalized graphene can be created by simply treating it with strong acid / base@xcite that results in functional groups ( epoxy ( -o- ) and hydroxyl ( -oh ) ) attached to the sheet . for go , one does not have to go through the reduction process of removing oxygen that naturally gets adsorbed on it or one does not have to create any high energy defects .",
    "functionalized graphene shows a great potential for li storage for making high capacity batteries .",
    "a specific capacity of @xmath0860 obtained by us is greater than that of 698 and 590 obtained with 75% sw and 16% dv of defects .",
    "thus , go is not only easy to prepare , it also gives very high specific capacities and could emerge as an ideal material for li - batteries .",
    "density functional theory ( dft ) calculations are performed in the pseudopotential formalism using quantum espresso@xcite code . due to the presence of lithium metal ,",
    "a higher plane - wave cutoffs of 60 ry is used .",
    "exchange interactions were treated within gga with perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe)@xcite functional form .",
    "we did include spin polarization in our calculations but found that there is negligible magnetic moment in the system .",
    "as van - der - waal s interactions play an important role in binding of lithium ions over the graphene sheet,@xcite we have included dispersion correction in our dft calculations.@xcite we choose a computationally cost - effective  dft - d2 \" method of grimme,@xcite for vdw interactions . for ( 1@xmath31 )",
    "unit cell of graphene , we use a monkhorst - pack k - mesh grid of @xmath4 and the corresponding k - mesh for bigger supercells .",
    "all the configurations have been relaxed with a force tolerance of @xmath5 ry / bohr . to avoid interactions between images perpendicular to the plane of the sheet , a vacuum of 21   is used .",
    "using these parameters , we get c - c bond length of 1.42   for pristine graphene that agrees well with the experiments.@xcite    we calculate the adsorption energy and the lithiation potential as a function of li concentration in pristine and functionalized graphene .",
    "lp can be determined from the nernst equation using following equation : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is charge on the li ion and @xmath8 is the change in gibb s free energy . at room temperature",
    ", the entropic effects ( @xmath9 ) and volume effects ( @xmath10 ) will be very small compared@xcite to the formation energy @xmath11 and can be neglected .",
    "@xmath11 is defined as @xmath12 $ ] , where @xmath13 is the total energy of the lithiated go , @xmath14 is the total energy of a single lithium atom in body centred cubic ( bcc ) structure , and @xmath15 is the total energy of substrate go . on the other side ,",
    "the ae of li is calculated by using @xmath14 for a gas phase li atom instead of the metallic li in the bcc structure .",
    "we have looked at the adsorption of li ion on graphene for various li concentrations by either varying the cell size or keeping the cell size fixed and varying the number of li atoms in the cell .",
    "figure [ [ fig1 ] ] shows the adsorption energies as a function of li concentration from 0.01% to 0.10% by varying the cell size from 3@xmath33 to 6@xmath36 , while the inset shows the variation of li concentration from 0.11% to 0.33% by varying number of li atoms in a fixed cell size 2@xmath32 .",
    "first of all , notice that adsorption energy ( ae ) of li increases with decrease in li concentration suggesting a repulsive interaction between li atoms .",
    "ae at hollow site is the highest of all the other high symmetry sites ( onsite , hollow and bridge ) , in agreement with previous literature.@xcite we find that including van - der - waal s ( vdw ) increases the adsorption of li by 0.35 ev irrespective of the li concentration and the dispersion contribution to the ae comes out to be 0.48 ev , in good agreement with 0.45 ev found by allouche @xcite even though the ae changes by a fixed amount of @xmath00.35 ev for all the li concentrations , this difference is expected to change when we functionalize graphene with epoxy / hydroxyl groups , as these functional groups will change the charge distribution in the system .",
    "hence , just by taking the vdw contribution separately will not give you the exact information about the ae and the proper inclusion of  dft - d2 \" inside the scf calculation is important .",
    "at hollow site . ]      here we investigate go as an anode material for li - batteries .",
    "it is well known that pristine graphene is not a suitable candidate for the li adsorption due to its negative lithiation potential,@xcite and hence it has a limitation to intercalate only between the spaces of graphene planes ( with a theoretical capacity of @xmath0372 ) .",
    "recently it has been shown that by introducing defects / vacancies,@xcite and functionalizing@xcite the graphene sheet , a positive lp can be achieved , and hence one can enhance the battery capacity .",
    "for the case of single li atom adsorption on the opposite side of epoxy group ( site-3,4,5 ) , we get the highest lp of 0.03 ev at site-3 having specific capacity of 115 . for the adsorption at site-1 and 2 on the same side as epoxy group , we get a lp of 1.44 ev and 0.31 ev , respectively .",
    "this high lp of 1.44 ev at site-1 is due to the binding of li atom to the oxygen atom causing it to break the double bond with the graphene sheet ( see figure[[fig32]](ii ) ) .",
    "a high lp of 1.66 ev was also found by stournara , @xcite for a similar configuration of li bonded to the oxygen atom .",
    "this discrepancy of 0.22 ev in lp could be due to the different cell sizes used in our calculations . at site-2 ,",
    "the li atom remains at the hollow site and hence has a lower lp as expected .",
    "we also looked at adsorption of li atom at site-3,4,5 on the same side as epoxy and found that in all three cases , li atom gets bonded with the oxygen atom resulting in 1.44 ev of lp(same as site-1 conf .",
    "figure[[fig32]](ii ) ) , with o - li bond getting oriented along the hollow site .",
    "thus , lp gets greatly affected whether the li atom is deposited on the same side or the opposite side of the epoxy group in the sheet . for the case of two li atoms in cell at site-1&2 and site-1&4 placed along the side of epoxy",
    ", we obtain a lp of 1.11 ev and 2.01 ev , respectively . for site-1&2",
    "one li atom makes bond to oxygen and another li atom remaining at site-2 , while for site-1&4 li atoms come near to oxygen with the position of oxygen at onsite position shown in figure[[fig32]](iii ) .        in the case",
    "hydroxyl functionalized graphene sheet , we get the highest lp of 0.86 ev at site-6 and 7 with li atom deposited on the opposite side of the -oh group .",
    "thus , lp in the hydroxyl functionalized graphene is higher than that of the epoxy functionalized graphene . with two and three li atoms adsorbed on the opposite side , lp of 0.32 ev and 0.22 ev ( specific capacity 230 and 345 ) ,",
    "respectively are obtained . in the extreme case of",
    "fully covered ( nine li atoms per -oh group ) go a lp of -0.20 ev is found .",
    "however when li is placed on the same side as the -oh group , it gets strongly bonded to the -oh group and the whole molecule ( li - oh ) gets detached from graphene sheet .",
    "860 is obtained on go with both epoxy and hydroxyl groups attached.,width=294,height=222 ]",
    ".lithiation potential with varying capacity for conf .",
    "iii(e ) and iii(h ) in 3@xmath33 supercell . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "lithium adsorption and lithiation potential on graphene oxide has been investigated using dft .",
    "we find that epoxy and hydroxyl functionalized graphene sheet provides the highest specific capacity of @xmath0860 .",
    "we have achieved higher capacities than previously reported capacities@xcite of 698 and 590 with 75% sw and 16% dv defects .",
    "although , even higher capacities of 1186 and 1029 were obtained by dutta , @xcite with 100% sw and 18.75% ( or higher ) dv defects , respectively .",
    "we believe that creating such high density of defects would make the entire system energetically unstable leading to bending and wrapping of the 2d sheet . in this paper",
    ", we have shown the hike in li storage capacity by attaching the functional group on one side of the sheet and li on the other side . however , it would be possible to further increase the storage capacity by increasing the density of functional groups and li atoms , _",
    "i.e. _ , by playing around with number of li atoms per epoxy and/or per hydroxyl groups .",
    "we have also demonstrated that london s dispersion contribution plays an important role in binding of li on graphene and go sheets .",
    "oxygen bonding and its position in go plays an important role in raising the specific capacity of go .",
    "thus , based on the first principle studies , we propose an efficient way to increase the capacity on a novel low - cost system ( go ) .",
    "our results provide an insight to find a better anode material for rechargeable li batteries without damaging or drastically modifying the properties of graphene .",
