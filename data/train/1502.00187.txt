    "so the difference in equilibrium free energies of li@xmath2 transfer from each electrodes to the electrolyte , divided by @xmath14 should be proportional to their voltage difference . since lic@xmath0 is an electronic conductor , at equilibrium @xmath7 flows between surfaces to make the voltage the same on basal and edge planes .",
    "on pristine edge planes , the all - important @xmath11=0 point is determined not only by the electronic charge ( @xmath12 ) compensated by mobile li@xmath2 in the liquid electrolyte , but also the fraction of li occupying the edge sites ( @xmath1 ) . at a fixed ,",

    "<S> the `` anode potential '' of charge - neutral lithium - intercalated graphite ( lic@xmath0 ) with oxidized edge planes is computed as a function of li - content ( @xmath1 ) at edge planes , using _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics ( aimd ) , a previously introduced li@xmath2 transfer free energy method , and the experimental li@xmath2/li(s ) value as reference . </S>",
    "<S> the voltage assignments are corroborated using explicit electron transfer from fluoroethylene carbonate radical anion markers . </S>",
    "<S> pf@xmath3 is shown to decompose electrochemically ( i.e. , not just thermally ) at low potentials imposed by our voltage calibration technique . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that excess electrons reside in localized states - in - the - gap in the organic carbonate liquid region , which is not semiconductor - like ( band - state - like ) as widely assumed in the literature .    </S>",
