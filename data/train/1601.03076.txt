    "lab on a chip is the generic term for the integration of the microdevices to carry out conventional analytical laboratory tests .",
    "such devices offer significant benefits over traditional laboratory tests in terms of device size , sample / reagent usage , and can provide much faster results for chemical and biochemical analyses @xcite .",
    "because of these advantages , lab on a chip devices are considered a promising option for the development of miniaturized devices for the environmental and defense monitoring , chemical synthesis and biomedical applications . in lab on a chip systems , various subcomponents such as pumps , mixers , reactors , and dilution chambers are integrated .",
    "therefore , the study of fluid flow in microscale , i.e. microfluidics , has become central to the development of lab on a chip devices @xcite . for lab on a chip devices ,",
    "micromixers are often vital components as mixing is required for chemical applications , biological applications , and detection / analysis of chemical or biochemical content @xcite .",
    "owing to small channel dimensions and low flow rates , the reynolds number for flows in microfluidic device is typically very small .",
    "hence , mixing through turbulent flow induced by inertial / viscous effects for aqueous solutions is not feasible in these miniaturized devices . therefore , diffusion is the dominant mechanism in micromixing due to the absence of turbulence .",
    "although it is difficult to induce turbulence in microchannels , an effective mixing in low reynolds number flow regimes can be obtained by the chaotic advection mechanism , which can occur in regular smooth flows @xcite and provides an effective increase in the interfacial contact area @xcite .",
    "electroosmosis is one of the most common nonmechanical means of achieving chaotic advection in microfluidics .",
    "when a charged solid surface comes in contact with an electrolyte , an electric double layer ( edl ) of ions is formed due to the interplay between electrical and diffusive forces @xcite .",
    "the flow of liquids containing dissolved ions under the influence of electrical body forces is known as electroosmosis ; it is a subject treated in depth in the electrokinetic transport literature @xcite . a simple method has been proposed for mixing low reynolds number electroosmotic flows in microchannels with patterned grooves @xcite .",
    "these grooves induce spiral circulations around the flow axis at low reynolds numbers and stretch and fold the streams with the result that a complete mixing can be achieved within a short mixing length .",
    "the use of unstable electrokinetic flow to achieve chaotic mixing effect has also been presented in @xcite . several numerical analytical investigation on electroosmotic",
    "mixing have been performed @xcite . and",
    "the mixing efficiency has been enhanced based on the periodic electroosmotic flow @xcite , modulation of electric fields @xcite , and shape optimization @xcite et al .",
    "the pattern of electroosmotic flow is mainly determined by the electrode distribution . for the complexity of electroosmotic flow",
    ", physical intuition - based determination of electrode distribution has its limitation . to overcome this limitation ,",
    "it is necessary to develop the inverse termination method for electrode distribution of electroosmotic mciromixer .    in the electroosmotic micromixer",
    ", the mixing efficiency is mainly determined by the electrode distribution used to carry the externally applied electric potential .",
    "therefore , this paper is focused on the method used to inversely determine the electrode distribution for electroosmotic micromixers .",
    "the discussed inverse termination method is built based in the optimal control method , which has been utilized to implement airfoil design * ? ? ?",
    "* , sensor deployment * ? ? ?",
    "* , control the convection diffusion @xcite and electric field for electrorheological fluids @xcite .",
    "based on the optimal control method , one boundary control problem is constructed for the electroosmotic micromixer in this paper . after solving of the problem , the electrode distribution can be determined according to the obtained step - shaped externally applied electric potential .",
    "when a micromixer is used to mix two fluidic flows with different solutes , the desired effect is the mixing of the two flows with anticipated concentration distribution at the outlet of the micromixer .",
    "the anticipated concentration distribution at the outlet can be specified by the designer based on the desired performance of the micromixer .",
    "the mixing performance of the micromixer can be measured by the least square variance between the obtained concentration @xmath0 and the anticipated concentration @xmath1 at the outlet , named mixing measurement @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the inlet and outlet of the micromixer , respectively ; @xmath5 is the reference concentration distribution , which is usually chosen to be the given concentration distribution at the inlet . for micromixers ,",
    "the required performance is to achieve the sufficient mixing of the two solutes .",
    "therefore , the anticipated concentration @xmath1 is specified to be the ideal concentration distribution of the solute at the outlet after sufficient mixing . in a electroosmotic micromixer with fixed geometry ,",
    "the mixing efficiency is determined by the distribution of the external electric potential induced by the electrode potential . and",
    "the distribution of the electrode potential lies on the distribution of the electrodes at the sidewalls of the electroosmotic micromixer .",
    "then the problem is on how to find a reasonable distribution of the electrodes that minimizes the mixing measurement and achieves sufficient mixing in a electroosmotic micromixer . in this paper ,",
    "the optimal control method is adopted and one dirichelet boundary control problem is constructed to solve this problem .    under the precondition of the continuum assumption ,",
    "the electroosmotic flow is described by the navier - stokes equations modified to include an electrical driving force term to represent the interaction between the excess ions of the electrical double layer ( edl ) and the external electric field induced by the electrode potential , where an assumption is made that the joule heating effect is negligible and can be ignored @xcite . in electroosmotic flows",

    "the ion distribution in the edl is influenced primarily by the zeta potential , and the distribution of the potential due to surface wall charge can be obtained by solving the equation @xmath27 for equation [ wallchargepotential ] , the imposed boundary conditions are @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the zeta potential . since the external electric potential arises from external charges , it satisfies laplacian equation within the fluid domain @xmath30 and the corresponding boundary conditions are @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the electrode potential on the sidewalls of the electroosmotic micromixer .",
    "then the micromixing in the electroosmotic flow can be described using the coupled system of equation [ nsequ ] , [ cdequ ] , [ wallchargepotential ] , and [ laplacian ] .",
    "+    based on the above description , the optimal control problem , used to find the reasonable distribution of the electrode potential and minimize the mixing measurement , can be constructed with the mixing measurement as objective , the coupling system of equation [ nsequ ] , [ cdequ ] , [ wallchargepotential ] and [ laplacian ] as constraints , and the electrode potential as control variable . because the control variable ( i.e. electrode potential ) is defined on the sidewalls which is the dirichlet boundary of the coupled system ,",

    "the distance between two neighboring electrodes can be controlled by reasonably choosing the value of the filter radius to control the size of the transition region .",
    "generally , higher value of filter radius corresponds to larger size of the transition region .",
