    "the _ spitzer _ galactic legacy infrared mid - plane survey extraordinaire ( glimpse ; @xcite ) identifies almost 600 bubbles  @xcite , extended to 5106 by the milky way project ( mwp )  @xcite .",
    "bubbles were defined by the 8.0 micron emission  , which contains 7.7 micron and 8.6 micron polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) features , including the continuum  @xcite .",
    "@xcite claimed that 25% of 322 bubbles outside 10  of the galactic center coincide with known radio  regions , and   extended this proportion to 86% based on a sample of 102 bubbles selected from the catalog provided by @xcite .",
    "most bubbles are photodissociation regions ( pdrs )   produced by high - mass stars ionizing atomic or molecular hydrogen .",
    "proposed a simple model for  region evolution involving two main phases , rapid ionization of the neutral medium followed by a long expansion . during the second phase , shock and ionization fronts form , and neutral material and cold dust collected between them .",
    "there are some studies supporting that the expanding of   regions are three - dimensional .",
    "@xcite find three - dimensional structures throughout a sample of 43 bubbles , using the observations of co ( j=3 - 2 ) and  ( j=4 - 3 ) observed by the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) . with more sensitive _ herschel _ data , detected emission from `` near - side '' and `` far - side '' of bubbles along the line of sight , which suggesting three - dimensional structures for bubbles .",
    "molecular lines , usually characterized with particular critical densities , excitation temperatures , and kinematics information , are superb tools for studying molecular clouds including those around infrared bubbles",
    ". observations of molecular lines contain physical , chemical , and dynamic information which is essential to the study of molecular clouds .",
    "co , a good tracer of molecular clouds due to its low excitation temperature and low critical density  , has been widely used to study infrared bubbles . for example , the galactic ring survey ( grs ) @xmath1co data  @xcite has been present in many bubble papers  . other molecular lines , such as  and   which are probes of dense clumps and cores  @xcite can also been found throughout bubble studies  @xcite .",
    "moreover ,  and  are good tracers of bipolar outflows , which are ubiquitous phenomena in star forming regions  @xcite , and  has also been used to identify outflows around infrared bubbles  @xcite .",
    "a number of papers argue that star formation processes can be triggered by expanding  regions , and mainly two mechanisms for the triggering are proposed : collect - and - collapse  @xcite , and radiation - driven implosion ( rdi )  @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed that star formation can be triggered by the propagation of ionization and shock fronts through a molecular cloud complex .",
    "@xcite analyzed the dynamical expansion of  regions and the outer pdrs around a high - mass star by solving the uv and fuv radiation transfer and the thermal and chemical processes , using time dependent hydrodynamics .",
    "they find that a molecular gas shell with a mass in the order of @xmath2 @xmath0 can be shaped in @xmath31 myr , and this triggering process is of great importance for star formations of next generation .",
    "seventeen candidate regions for the collect - and - collapse process were identified by , and a large number of young stellar objects ( ysos ) were found in the vicinity of bubbles @xcite .",
    "@xcite found a strong positional correlation between high - mass ysos ( hmysos ) and  regions with mwp bubbles at separations of @xmath42 bubble radii . a statistical study of ysos around 322 _ spitzer _ mid - infrared bubbles has been done by @xcite , and they found a significant overdensity of red msx - source survey ( rms ) ysos around the bubbles .",
    "these results support that expanding  regions can provide an effective mechanism to form next generation stars .    however , this scenario is not universal",
    ". found the cold gas lies in a ring instead of a sphere , indicating a flattened molecular clouds which could be not greatly compressed by expanding shock fronts . in this case , the formation of new stars could be hindered .",
    "@xcite investigated the most commonly used signposts and found none of them significantly improved the chances of correctly identifying a given star as triggered .",
    "they argued that we should be cautious in interpreting observations of star formation near feedback driven structures in terms of triggering .",
    "if bubbles can truly trigger star formation , then the characteristics of star formation , i.e. , collapse , outflows , or masers , should be found around them .",
    "although these phenomena are not specific for triggered star formation , the more star formation process we find around bubbles , the safer we can say they are triggered or accelerated by expanding  regions .",
    "identifying ysos is the most commonly used method to study triggered star formation .",
    "however , it is difficult to determine the distances , ages , and masses of ysos .",
    "if we could find outflows or specific masers , such as oh , h@xmath5o , and class ii ch@xmath6oh @xcite , which are direct signposts of star formation , we can at least confirm that star formation processes are indeed present around bubbles , although some of these processes are probably spontaneous .",
    "@xcite made a class i and ii  masers survey of approximately 20 hmyso outflow candidates , referred to as extend green objects ( egos ) which are candidates of massive outflows , and three of them are associated with bubbles .",
    "@xcite proposed 12 eye - based outflow candidates , and however , stronger evidence is required to confirm them because moments maps are inadequate to confirm outflows due to the complex environments around bubbles .",
    "we studied 13 infrared bubble regions selected from the bubble catalog of  @xcite , including 18 bubbles . for each bubble , five molecular lines",
    "were observed , revealing the dynamic and physical features of molecular clouds around bubbles . among the five lines ,",
    "c@xmath7o ( j=1 - 0 ) , hcn ( j=1 - 0 ) , and hco@xmath8(j=1 - 0 ) are not widely present in previous observations .",

    "<S> we investigated the physical properties of molecular clouds and star formation processes around infrared bubbles which are essentially expanding  regions . </S>",
    "<S> we performed observations of 13 galactic infrared bubble fields containing 18 bubbles . </S>",
    "<S> five molecular lines , , , , , and , were observed , and several publicly available surveys , glimpse , mipsgal , atlasgal , bgps , vgps , magpis , and nvss , were used for comparison . </S>",
    "<S> we find that these bubbles are generally connected with molecular clouds , most of which are giant . </S>",
    "<S> several bubble regions display velocity gradients and broad shifted profiles , which could be due to the expansion of bubbles . </S>",
    "<S> the masses of molecular clouds within bubbles range from 100 to 19,000 @xmath0 , and their dynamic ages are about 0.3 - 3.7 myr , which takes into account the internal turbulence pressure of surrounding molecular clouds . </S>",
    "<S> clumps are found in the vicinity of all 18 bubbles , and molecular clouds near four of these bubbles with larger angular sizes show shell - like morphologies , indicating that either collect - and - collapse or radiation - driven implosion processes may have occurred . due to the contamination of adjacent molecular clouds , only six bubble regions are appropriate to search for outflows , and we find that four of them have outflow activities . </S>",
    "<S> three bubbles display ultra - compact   regions at their borders , and one of them is probably responsible for its outflow . in total , only six bubbles show star formation activities in the vicinity , and we suggest that star formation processes might have been triggered . </S>"
