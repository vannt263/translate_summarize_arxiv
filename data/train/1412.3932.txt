    "recent findings @xcite indicate this alloy as particularly interesting for _ e.g.  _ the self - assembling of functional multilayers and for having revealed the decisive role of mn as surfactant during the epitaxial growth of al@xmath0ga@xmath1n : mn , considerably enhancing the critical thickness of al@xmath0ga@xmath1n : mn on gan , and opening new perspectives for the realization of _ e.g.  _ improved reflectors in gan - based laser structures .",

    "measurements of squid magnetometry in the temperature range between 1.5 k and room temperature , confirm the samples to be paramagnetic . here",
    ", we focus on the effect of mn incorporation on the structural arrangement of al@xmath0ga@xmath1n : mn and on the local atomic environment of mn , with particular attention to the xrd and hrtem analysis as essential complement to the synchrotron xas and xes measurements .",

    "this corresponds to the best fitting model and consists of a mn@xmath12 defect in al@xmath0ga@xmath1n  expanded in three sets of single scattering paths : mn - n , mn - al and mn - ga , corresponding to the first three coordination shells . for each sample",

    "in fact , the absolute value of this variable , which represents the coordination of the first coordination shell ( mn-4n tetrahedron ) , is affected by the numerical correlation with @xmath16 and by the presence of nitrogen vacancies , as found in similar samples @xcite .",
    "for this reason , we rely on the results of the xld analysis , which is much more sensitive to the symmetry of the crystal , for determining the level of mn@xmath25 in the samples .",
    "nevertheless , a strong @xmath26-independent amplitude reduction of the exafs signal is obtained for the aln : mn sample ( # h ) . as shown by the tem micrographs",
    ", this sample has a columnar structure , thus the amplitude reduction is attributed to an increased local disorder , as it was demonstrated by exafs simulations combined with molecular dynamics calculations for mn nano - columns in ge : mn @xcite .",
    "the second percentage parameter,@xmath15 , is extracted from the fitted coordination number of the second coordination shell , keeping the constraint of 12 total neighbors ( ga / al ) dictated by the wurtzite structure .",
    "the results follow a linear dependence and match , within the error bars , with the al concentration found by xrd .",
    "furthermore , it is found that the average mn - n bond distance is larger than those of ga - n or al - n and is not affected by the al doping , while mn - al and mn - ga show a contraction going from gan : mn to aln : mn , as expected by the reduction of the lattice parameters .",

    "the herfd - xanes spectra correspond to a diagonal cut in the 2d resonant inelastic x - ray scattering ( rixs ) plane @xcite and can be approximated to a standard xanes spectra only in the region above the main absorption edge , where the spectral features arise from electric dipole transitions from 1@xmath28 to 4@xmath29 empty states of the absorbing atoms ( mn ) . on a first order approximation",
    ", this energy range can be described by multiple scattering theory employing simple muffin - tin potentials @xcite within a one - electron approach , _",
    "i.e.  _ the level of theory employed for the simulated spectra shown in this study . the spectral features present in the pre - edge region of the herfd - xanes spectra can not be fully described by the level of theory employed here and a quantitative analysis requires to account for the full rixs plane , not only for line cuts @xcite . nevertheless , the presence of an intense pre - edge peak in the k - edge xas spectra of 3@xmath30 transition metals is the fingerprint of tetrahedral ( t@xmath31 ) symmetry @xcite , due to allowed electric dipole transitions to the @xmath29-character of the @xmath32 spin - polarized 3@xmath30 states .",
    "the spectral features present in the xanes region do not correlate straightforward with a given coordination shell or scattering species , but are the result of full multiple scattering configurations .",
    "this induces an enhanced sensitivity to the geometry around the absorber . on the other hand , this also makes challenging to quantitatively model the xanes via _ ab initio _ methods .",

    "the mn@xmath22 interstitial shows a xld signal too , however it is not in phase with the mn@xmath12 xld signal and the resulting xld amplitude in the region of interest is reduced . as a reference for the 100% case , we arbitrarily rescale the experimental xld amplitudes to the xld amplitude at the ga k - edge of a gan : mn layer from ref .",
