    "with the turning - on of the lhc in the near future , one of the most important tasks of both general - purpose detectors atlas and cms will be the search for physics beyond the standard model , with one of the most promising candidates being supersymmetry .",
    "in the course of this program , which will obviously be adjusted and focused with increasing luminosity and with the first indications of `` new physics '' , the determination of the properties of newly detected particles will be a major task .",
    "indeed , only after the quantum numbers , the interaction and the mass of a new particle have been measured with high precision , this requirement can be considered fulfilled .    in the present paper",
    "we want to concentrate on the gluino , the supersymmetric partner of the gluon , and discuss the possibility to determine its quantum numbers , i.e. its spin , color , majorana nature and its mass , through the investigation of non - relativistic boundstates of two gluinos , generally denoted `` gluinonia '' .",
    "the classification of gluinonia according to their quantum numbers and their qualitative properties , i.e. spectra and decay modes , as well as estimates of their production cross section at hadron colliders have been studied already more than two decades ago and presented in refs .",
    "@xcite concentrating at that time on gluino masses which are by now experimentally excluded .",
    "more recently gluinonia have been discussed in refs .",
    "hadronic transitions between different gluinonium levels and some rare annihilation decays were evaluated in @xcite .",
    "the production of vector and pseudoscalar states at the tevatron and the lhc was investigated in @xcite where it was argued that , given sufficiently good yet realistic jet mass resolution , pseudoscalar states could be detected for bound state masses up to 3 tev . a phenomenological study of the question , to which extent a signal for color - octet states could indeed be detected experimentally , has been performed in @xcite . in all these cases , however , the production cross section has been calculated in lowest order approximation only and a qualitative phenomenological potential for the gluino - gluino interaction has been employed .",
    "the topic has gained renewed interest in connection with split susy @xcite , ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the detection of these bound states would provide important information about gluino properties , difficult to obtain through other means .",
    "since gluinonia only exist if gluinos do not decay too rapidly , say with decay rates less than a few gev , their observation would immediately provide at least an upper limit on @xmath1 .",
    "the energy spectrum of the gluinonium system , e.g. the mass difference between ground state and first radial excitation ( or open gluino production ) would be sensitive to the potential and thus to the color - octet nature of the constituents .",
    "the same is true for the production cross section which is proportional to the square of the wave function at the origin .",
    "gluinos are expected to decay through cascades into several jets plus the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) which escapes detection .",
    "for this reason the precise determination of its mass in direct gluino decays is limited by the missing mass or energy resolution .",
    "in contrast , once the mass of the boundstate and the dynamics of the interaction are known with sufficient precision , the mass of the constituents is fixed with the corresponding accuracy and in any case subject to a different systematic error .    the energy levels of gluinonia were estimated already in the early papers employing phenomenological color - octet potentials , obtained from phenomenological quarkonium potentials by multiplication with the ratio of the corresponding casimir operators @xmath2 and the gluino mass was interpreted as an effective mass closely related to the pole mass . during recent years",
    "more refined studies have been performed to describe non - relativistic boundstates of color - triplet constituents .",
    "this includes the evaluation of the static two - loop potential @xcite , first steps toward the evaluation of the three - loop potential @xcite and the calculation of mass - suppressed terms proportional @xmath3 @xcite and @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "mass definitions better suited to control the long distance part of the potential have been introduced @xcite , and the evaluation of the spectra through analytic methods has been possible , using a perturbative approach to include higher order contributions from the potential @xcite .",
    "last but not least , finite - width effects were incorporated for top - quark production at electron - positron @xcite and hadron colliders @xcite .",
    "these new results can be applied also in studies of gluino bound states .    in order to arrive at reliable predictions for the signals of gluinonium production and decay ,",
    "the inclusion of a realistic qcd potential and next - to - leading order ( nlo ) corrections to boundstate production at the lhc is mandatory . considering and building on the significant progress in the perturbative treatment of non - relativistic boundstates ,",
    "in particular quarkonium and positronium , predictions of similar quality can be made for boundstates with color - octet constituents .",
    "this is the main content of the present paper .",
    "we start with a brief overview and a discussion of the quantum numbers and qualitative properties of boundstates with majorana constituents and evaluate the qcd potential for a color - octet boundstate ( section [ sec : properties ] ) .",
    "subsequently , in section [ sec : spectroscopy ] , we calculate the spectrum and the wave function at the origin for the lowest - lying levels .",
    "these quantities are the necessary ingredients for a realistic prediction of gluinonium production and decay rates presented in section [ sec : production ] . assuming that squarks are relatively heavy , the dominant decay channel of the pseudoscalar singlet boundstate proceeds through two gluons , and it will be a difficult task to distinguish this signal from the irreducible background from the two - gluon jet continuum .",
    "in section [ sec : photons ] we consider as an alternative the decays into top quarks and two photons , which can proceed through virtual quark ( @xmath5 ) and squark ( @xmath6 ) intermediate states .",
    "one might , in principle , hope that the extremely clean @xmath7 signal sticks out of the irreducible background similarly to the higgs decay into two photons which has been identified as a promising signal significantly superior to the @xmath8 or two - gluon mode .",
    "similar considerations apply to the @xmath9 mode .    in order that these modes can compete with the two - gluon channel",
    ", squarks should not be dramatically heavier than gluinos .",
    "on the other hand , to avoid dominance of the single - gluino decay , the decay mode @xmath10 should be kinematically forbidden , corresponding to @xmath11 .",
    "we therefore evaluate the corresponding decay rates and study if , given suitable choices for the respective masses , the two - photon mode might lead to a possible signal . in section",
    "[ sec : background ] a rough estimate of the dominant signal versus background is presented .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusions ] contains our conclusions .",
    "let us start with a brief recapitulation of the quantum numbers of gluino boundstates and the corresponding color , spin and orbital momentum configurations @xcite . these differ from those of quarkonia due to the restrictions arising from the majorana nature of gluinos , and due to their different color assignment .",
    "two color - octet states can be combined into irreducible representations as follows @xmath12 where the index indicates the ( anti-)symmetry with respect to their color index",
    ". the interaction can be either attractive , repulsive or absent ( in lowest order ) .",
    "in lowest order the coefficient of the qcd potential is given by the expectation value of the product of the color generators @xmath13 , taken between two - particle states in the respective representation .",
    "this product , in turn , can be expressed by the eigenvalues of the quadratic casimir operator of the constituents , @xmath14 , and the boundstate in representation @xmath15 , @xmath16 : @xmath17=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(c_{{r}}-2c_{a}\\right )    \\ , .",
