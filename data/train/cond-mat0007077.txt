    "dynamically screened electron - electron interactions in disordered metals are known to cause singular corrections to the electronic density of states ( dos ) , as explained by aronov and altshuler @xcite .",
    "the corresponding zero - bias anomalies ( zba ) have been studied by tunneling spectroscopy on wide junctions in thermodynamic equilibrium @xcite . how is the zba modified when a large current is driven through the system by a finite bias voltage , and the bridge is so small that there is phase coherence across the whole sample ? in this case , no local equilibrium is reached , since energy relaxation does not occur within the sample . instead , the distribution function of electrons traversing the system exhibits two fermi steps related to the two different electrochemical potentials of the two leads .",
    "this fact has been claimed theoretically @xcite and has recently been confirmed in tunneling experiments @xcite ( where in addition the steps were rounded due to interactions in long wires ) and indirectly by noise measurements in a similar setup @xcite .",
    "we have fabricated metallic nanobridges , which allow for the first time to study the aronov - altshuler anomaly @xcite in the stationary non - equilibrium situation specified above .",
    "a two - dimensional ( 2d ) , diffusive metal bridge , much shorter than all inelastic scattering lengths , is placed in good metallic contact between two thick reservoirs .",
    "a high lead - to - bridge aspect ratio allows to maintain a finite voltage drop across the bridge despite its small resistance , thus allowing the observation of temperature - voltage scaling behavior .",
    "the study of a 2d bridge is further motivated by the fact that this geometry allows to distinguish between the aronov - altshuler conductance anomaly and a possible two - channel kondo effect induced by two - level systems @xcite , which has been put forward as the origin of zbas observed in ultrasmall point contacts @xcite : in 3d both the aronov - altshuler and the two - channel kondo anomalies show square root power - law behavior ; in 2d the aronov - altshuler correction is logarithmic , while the two - channel kondo singularity , as a local effect , is independent of dimension .",
    "as will be discussed , the conductance through the non - equilibrium bridge can be well described by a two - termnal landauer - bttiker formula , generalized for interacting systems @xcite .",
    "applying the theory of electron - electron interaction in disordered systems in non - equilibrium , we find that the electronic dos is strongly modified by the non - equilibrium and displays two logarithmic singularities , corresponding to the two steps in the distribution function .",
    "this yields quantitative agreement with the experimental results .",
    "the samples were produced by the shadow - evaporation technique @xcite .",
    "metal was deposited at two different angles under uhv conditions through a pmma mask patterned with e - beam lithography .",
    "we deposited 10 nm of cu@xmath1au@xmath2 for the bridge at one angle ( -13@xmath3 off the normal direction of the surface ) and 700 nm of cu for the reservoirs ( + 13@xmath3 ) at the opposite angle without breaking the vacuum ( on the 10@xmath4  mbar scale during evaporation ) .",
    "the transport measurements were performed in a @xmath5he/@xmath6he dilution refrigerator in a temperature range between @xmath7  mk and @xmath8  k. the differential resistance was measured with a lr  700 resistance bridge , which was capacitively coupled to a dc circuit through the sample . the ac excitation was less than @xmath9v .",

    "it is placed in good metallic contact between two bulk cu leads , which are about 70 times thicker than the bridge and extend over a large area of about 1  mm@xmath35 each ( see fig.[weber_fig1 ] ) .",
    "hence the voltage applied to the sample drops only along the bridge , and the arising heating power is reliably conducted away by the leads .",
    "this was verified in a control experiment , where the cooling capability of the reservoirs was varied using a different geometry .",
    "no change of the behavior reported below was observed .",
    "moreover , as demonstrated in detail below , the electronic motion is coherent over the entire size of the nanobridge , which means , in particular , that there is no heat deposition within the bridge .",
    "the elastic mean free path @xmath13 was estimated from the residual - resistance ratio and consistently from the drude formula . in all samples",
    "@xmath13 is comparable to the thickness @xmath10 , but much shorter than the lateral length @xmath34 , and therefore , the electronic density modes in the bridge obey the rules of 2d diffusive motion .",
    "below we present experimental conductance data of sample no . ( 1 ) ; the results obtained from the other cu@xmath1au@xmath36 and cu films are very similar .",
    "raw data of the zero - bias conductance as a function of temperature @xmath37 are shown in fig .",

    "below @xmath7  mk , small deviations from the form eq .",
    "( 1 ) were observed , which are probably due to incomplete thermalization of the sample at the lowest temperatures .",
    "such logarithmic behavior has often been observed in thin metallic films and metallic nanobridges and is usually attributed to weak localization @xcite and/or electron - electron interaction @xcite .",
    "7.7 cm    when applying a bias voltage @xmath42 , small deviations from ohmic behavior , i.e. a voltage - dependent differential conductance @xmath43 , are observed at low @xmath42 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ weber_fig3 ] .",
    "this zero - bias anomaly ( zba ) , symmetrical with respect to reversal of @xmath42 , becomes continuously more pronounced as @xmath37 is lowered . for all voltage sweeps taken for various @xmath37 in the range of 0.1  k to 2.1  k , one observes a remarkable scaling property : if one subtracts the zero - bias conductance of each sweep and plots @xmath44 as a function of @xmath45 , all conductance sweeps collapse onto a single curve , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ weber_fig3 ] .",
    "comparison with results of several cu@xmath1au@xmath36 samples and for pure cu samples ( with a mean free path comparable to the thickness of the wire ) yields a further general property @xmath46 is identical for all samples ( table i ) , where @xmath40 is the zero - bias anomaly amplitude defined above .",
    "we therefore propose the following scaling law : @xmath47    8.1 cm    7.7 cm    where @xmath48 is a function of @xmath49 only .",
    "other scaling laws , in particular @xmath50 dependence as expected for the two - channel kondo effect @xcite , fit very poorly to the data . fig .",
    "[ weber_fig4 ] shows the function @xmath48 extracted from conductivity measurements on one sample at seven different temperatures as a function of @xmath51 on a semi - logarithmic scale ( data of positive and negative bias are included ) . within some scatter due to experimental noise ,",
    "all sweeps collapse onto one single curve . at @xmath52 ,",
    "the conductance is essentially constant , which corresponds to thermal smearing . at @xmath53 ,",
    "the behavior is roughly logarithmic , and for still larger values of @xmath54 , the curves deviate from scaling .",
    "the low-@xmath37 data follow the logarithmic behavior up to @xmath55 , while the high-@xmath37 data deviate at lower y. these deviations at higher energies are attributed to heating effects and/or additional high - energy processes like phonon excitations and are well known from similar experiments @xcite .",
    "when a perpendicular magnetic field of up to @xmath56 is applied , we do not observe any systematic change of the conductance behavior apart from universal conductance fluctuations ( ucf ) .",
    "in particular , the scaling behavior persists , with the amplitude @xmath40 and the scaling function @xmath48 remaining unchanged .",
    "we expect a weak localization conductance correction of @xmath57 , which is not clearly distinguishable from the ucfs in our small samples . however , the fact that the amplitude @xmath40 of the zba as a function of applied voltage @xmath42 ( i.e. the slope of the logaritmic scaling curve ) remains unchanged in a magnetic field of @xmath56 indicates that weak localization only gives a constant , voltage independent correction and that the logarithmic increase of the conductance with applied voltage is not due a to a loss of coherence at finite voltage and a subsequent suppression of weak localization , since otherwise the effect would disappear in a magnetic field .",
    "this , in turn , provides clear evidence that the samples are coherent even at finite bias voltage @xmath42 as expected from their small size .",
    "7.7 cm    logarithmic behavior may also be caused by magnetic impurities or by non - magnetic two - channel kondo defects @xcite above their respective kondo temperatures @xmath58 . since an applied field of @xmath59  t",
    "does not modify the zba , any magnetic impurities present in the sample must have @xmath60  k. however , the logarithmic behavior of the zero - bias conductance observed down to the lowest @xmath37 ( fig .",
    "[ weber_fig2 ] ) puts an upper bound to the kondo temperature , @xmath61  k , thus ruling out magnetic impurities as the origin of the zba .",
    "in the two - channel kondo scenario , from point - contact spectroscopy on cu one expects @xmath62 5 to 10  k @xcite .",
    "hence , it is unlikely that the zba is due to two - channel kondo defects for the same reason as in the magnetic case .",
    "the assumption that there is no sizable number of two - channel kondo defects present in our cu@xmath19au@xmath20 samples is consistent with the fact that in previous cu point contacts the two - channel kondo signal completely disappeared upon doping with 1% au or more @xcite .",
    "in the following we show that the observed scaling behavior of the differential conductance can be explained quantitatively by electron - electron interaction within a model calculation for the non - equilibrium dc transport through our small , disordered metal bridges .",
    "since the diffusion time of an electron through the bridge , @xmath63ps , is short compared to the dephasing time @xmath64 and the energy relaxation time @xmath65 , the electrons occupy the exact eigenstates of the disordered bridge while traversing the system .",
    "therefore , the dc transport is coherent ( zero - dimensional ) , even when a finite bias voltage is applied as discussed above , i.e. the interacting eigenstates of the bridge serve as transmission channels . in such a situation",
    "a generalized landauer - bttiker approach can be applied , where the conductance is expressed in terms of the interacting , non - equilibrium dos @xmath66 of the bridge in the presence of coupling to the leads @xcite .",
    "diffusive density modes , which exist at time scales down to the elastic scattering time @xmath67 couple to the electronic dos via the dynamically screened coulomb interaction and thus give a singular correction to the conductance as shown below .    because of the good metallic contact , charging effects at the interfaces @xcite are negligible in our devices .",
    "since the transition between the reservoirs and the bridge occurs abruptly on a scale small compared to the extension of the bridge wave functions and energy relaxation in the bridge is negligible , one may represent the system in terms of the exact eigenstates @xmath68 of the bridge , separated from the leads , and include the bridge - lead coupling to infinite order in perturbation theory @xcite ( assumed to be convergent ) . denoting the corresponding creation operators for eigenstates with spin @xmath69 in the left ( right ) leads and the bridge by @xmath70 , @xmath71 , respectively",

    "we also introduce the effective couplings @xmath79 , and @xmath80 , which will be assumed to be assumed to be independent of energy and of the channels @xmath81 , @xmath82 of the bridge . + using the dyson equation for the keldysh matrix green function @xmath83 in terms of the exact eigenstates of the bridge , it is straight - forward to show that at finite bias and for negligible energy relaxation the distribution function @xmath84 of quasiparticles is a linear superposition of the distribution functions in the leads , @xmath85\\ ; , \\label{eq : f}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath86 is the fermi function .",
    "the distribution function @xmath87 , eq .  ( [ eq : f ] ) , represents the probablility for eigenstates of the entire bridge with energy @xmath88 being occupied and , therefore , is position independent .",
    "it should be emphasized that this is to be distinguished from the local distribution function @xmath89 , which is defined as the probability of finding an electron in a state with energy @xmath88 within a small volume centered at position @xmath90 wherein the externally applied fields are slowly varying @xcite .",
    "when , as in the present case , the interaction correction to the local dos is small ( @xmath91 ) , in a disordered system @xmath89 obeys a diffusive kinetic equation @xcite @xmath92 for negligible energy relaxation the collision integral @xmath93 vanishes , and @xmath89 is a linear superposition of fermi functions @xmath94 , @xmath95 with coefficients depending linearly on the position @xmath90 along the bridge .",
    "it follows directly from the definitions of @xmath87 and @xmath89 via the total and the local density matrices , respectively , that @xmath96 the local distribution @xmath89 has been measured in tunneling experiments of ref .",
    "[ 7 ] , while for the description of the present experiment only the integrated distribution @xmath97 , eq .",

    "the problem of the dc current at arbitrary bias voltage is thus reduced to calculating the non - equilibrium dos , @xmath101 .",
    "note that the diffusion constant @xmath12 does not appear explicitly in eq.([eq : current ] ) , since the dc transport is zero - dimensional .",

    "the inverse screening length in 2d is @xmath114 . according to our sample dimensions , @xmath115 , the quasiparticle momentum @xmath105 is integrated over the 3d momentum space , while the wave number of the diffusion mode is 2d and restricted to the range @xmath116 .",

    "this expression recovers the well - known dos correction @xcite @xmath123 . for our finite - size bridges ,",
    "however , the log divergence of the term in square brackets is cut off , and a single logarithmic singularity remains .",
    "thus , we expect a crossover from log@xmath35 to simple log behavior in finite - size 2d films , as the energy considered becomes less than @xmath124 . near the fermi edges",

    "the resulting scaling curve does not contain any adjustable parameters and agrees quantitatively with the experimental data , as shown in fig .",
    "[ weber_fig4 ] .",
    "it is characteristic for log behavior that in eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltansc ] ) , and consequently also in the conductance @xmath138 , the prefactor of the term depending on the dimensionless voltage @xmath139 is independent of @xmath37 and is equal to the amplitude of the @xmath37-dependent term @xmath140 at @xmath132 .",
    "this is in contrast to , e.g. , power - law scaling or @xmath141 dependence of the dos correction and , hence , can be used to distinguish the latter behaviors from simple log scaling in the experimental data .    from the above discussion",
    "it is seen that the scaling of the non - linear conductance in terms of @xmath49 arises because ( 1 ) the low - energy behavior of the dos inside the bridge is dominated by one single infrared divergent process ( in the present case diffusion modes coupling to the single - particle states via dynamically screened coulomb interaction ) , which ensures that the dos is described by a scale - independent function of the quasiparticle energy ; ( 2 ) the low - energy cutoff , which determines the units of the dimensionless energies @xmath142 and @xmath139 , is the same in the reservoirs and in the interacting region .",
    "this means that the reservoir temperature @xmath37 ( entering through the distribution functions @xmath143 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : current ] ) ) and the width of the fermi steps in the bridge ( entering through eq .",
    "( [ eq : f ] ) ) must be the same , i.e. energy relaxation in the bridge must be negligible ; ( 3 ) a finite bias voltage is maintained between the leads .",
    "a high lead - to - bridge aspect ratio and a short nanobridge are essential to establish conditions ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) at the same time .",
    "finally , we can estimate the amplitude @xmath40 of the aronov - altshuler conductance correction compared to the background conductance @xmath144 . assuming that each channel contributes equally to the conductance , the unknown coupling constant @xmath145 cancels in the ratio @xmath146 .",
    "we obtain @xmath147 , which is in reasonably good agreement with the experimental result @xmath148 ( see fig .  [ weber_fig2 ] ) , considering the crudeness of the estimate .",
    "7.5 cm    very recently , it has been proposed that logarithmic corrections to the conductance may also be caused by charge fluctuations between bridge and the reservoirs even in a clean system @xcite .",
    "this correction can presumably be understood as the leading logarithmic behavior of an orthogonality catastrophe caused by the vanishing overlap between different charge states of the bridge .",
    "a similar effect has been considered by matveev and larkin @xcite in the context of tunneling through a charged impurity .",
    "it remains to be seen whether this may provide an explanation of the zba in our samples .",
    "we have performed differential conductance measurements on small 2-dimensional metal bridges , whose thouless energy is larger than the temperature .",
    "a controlled non - equilibrium situation was established by using a high aspect ratio between the lead and bridge thickness .",
    "we observe a zba with logarithmic scaling behavior as a function of the dimensionless bias voltage @xmath49 .",
    "the observed scaling curve as well as the amplitude of the effect are in good quantitative agreement with our theoretical prediction that in short bridges ( @xmath149 ) the altshuler - aronov dos correction shows @xmath150 behavior instead of the @xmath151 behavior of infinite films .",
    "for the observed scaling behavior to occur it is crucial that , despite the metallic contact to the leads , eigenstates in the bridge survive due to strong wave - function mismatch caused by the enormous lead - to - bridge aspect ratio .        for a review see b.l .",
