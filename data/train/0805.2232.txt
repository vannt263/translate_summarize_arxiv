    "however , x - rays in the low energy band are absorbed by the interstellar medium , and hence soft x - ray observations can detect x - rays from only nearby snrs on the galactic plane . on the other hand , although hard x - rays can observe snrs even in the galactic plane , hard x - ray detectors without imaging capability could not find faint x - ray emission from snrs on the galactic plane where there are many bright x - ray sources containing a compact object .",

    "the size of the snr is derived from the radio and x - ray images , while the plasma temperature ( @xmath61 ) and the emission integral ( @xmath62=@xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the hydrogen and electron densities , respectively , @xmath66 is the volume of the x - ray emitting region ) are taken from the mekal model fit .",
    "the distances to the snrs were calculated from the best - fit @xmath48 values with assumption of the mean density of 1 h@xmath67 . for g355.6@xmath00.0 , we assumed the low - temperature component is x - ray emission from the shell region .",
    "assuming the temperature of the snr shell ( @xmath68 ) of @xmath69 , the filling factor of 0.25 , and @xmath65=1.2  @xmath64 , the explosion energies for g12.0@xmath00.1 , g346.6@xmath00.2 , and g355.6@xmath00.0 were calculated to be @xmath311 , @xmath310.05 , and @xmath310.5 in units of 10@xmath70 erg , respectively .",
    "although the uncertainties of the physical parameters derived from the spectral fits are large , the case of g346.6@xmath00.2 seems to be much smaller than the canonical supernova explosion energy ( = 10@xmath70 erg ) .",
    "next , we examined two cases of nonthermal x - ray emission from the snr for g12.0@xmath00.1 and g346.6@xmath00.2 , a sn 1006-like case and a pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) case . in the case of sn 1006-like snrs ,",
    "high energy electrons accelerated in the snr shells emit synchrotron x - rays and lose their energy .",
    "the observed flux densities at 10@xmath71 hz were @xmath319@xmath1810@xmath72 jy and @xmath317@xmath1810@xmath72 jy for g12.0@xmath00.1 and g346.6@xmath00.2 , respectively , which are smaller than the values extrapolated from the radio band with the parameters in table 1 @xcite , @xmath31(12)@xmath1810@xmath73 jy and @xmath313@xmath1810@xmath74 jy for g12.0@xmath00.1 and g346.6@xmath00.2 , respectively .",
    "furthermore , although the errors are large , the spectral indices in the x - ray band obtained from the power - law model fit were steeper than those in the radio band .",
    "these suggest that there is a break frequency between the radio and the x - ray bands",
    ". therefore , the nonthermal x - rays from the snr shells like sn 1006 , may be possible .",
    "the x - ray morphology of g346.6@xmath00.2 seems to show a weak peak in the radio structure .",
    "although a pulsar has not been discovered for g346.6@xmath00.2 , a pwn scenario can not be excluded .",
    "unfortunately , detailed properties of the snrs are still unknown because the photon statistics in the agps data were limited . in order to understand",
    "the physical process in the snrs and their nature , spatially resolved x - ray spectra with good photon statistics with chandra , xmm - newton , and suzaku are required .",
