    "<S> ( [ jmc ] ) was the focal point of extensive scrutiny , and has been demonstrated to furnish a unified description of a wide variety of the low energy qcd data @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> however , an important unresolved question in this context is the incorporation of the qcd effective charge into the standard schwinger - dyson equation governing the dynamics of the quark propagator @xmath57 @xmath58    specifically , since qcd is not a fixed point theory , the usual qed - inspired gap equation must be modified , in order to incorporate the running charge and asymptotic freedom . </S>",
    "<S> the usual way of accomplishing this eventually boils down to the replacement @xmath59 in the corresponding kernel of the gap equation , where @xmath60 is the qcd running coupling . </S>",
    "<S> the inclusion of @xmath60 is essential for arriving at an integral equation for @xmath57 which is well - behaved in the ultraviolet . </S>",
    "<S> however , since the perturbative form of @xmath60 diverges at low energies as @xmath61 when @xmath62 , some form of the infrared regularization for @xmath60 is needed , whose details depend on the specific assumptions one is making regarding the nonperturbative hadron dynamics . at this point </S>",
    "<S> the issue of the critical coupling makes its appearance . specifically , as is well - known </S>",
    "<S> , there is a critical infrared limiting value of the running coupling , to be denoted by @xmath63 , below which there are no nontrivial solutions to the resulting gap equation , i.e. , there is no csb , see fig .  </S>",

    "<S> ( [ jmc ] ) into a gap equation has been studied for the first time in ref .  </S>",

    "<S> there it was concluded that csb solutions for @xmath66 could be obtained only for unnaturally small values of the gluon mass , namely @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> this is so because the typical value of @xmath63 found in the standard treatment of the gap equation is @xmath68 , which is what the expression for @xmath50 yields for the above value of  @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> this issue was further investigated in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , where a system of coupled gap and vertex equations was considered . </S>",
    "<S> the upshot of this study was that no consistent solutions to the system of integral equations could be found , due to the fact that the allowed values for  @xmath64 , dictated by the vertex equation , were significantly lower than @xmath50 , i.e. , not large enough to trigger chiral symmetry breaking .    ) , solid curves ) with the effective charge  ( [ jprc ] ) ( dashed curves ) . </S>",
    "<S> the values of parameters are : @xmath39 active quarks , @xmath70mev ( a ) , @xmath71mev ( b ) , gluon mass @xmath72mev and @xmath73mev ( c ) , gluon mass @xmath74mev and @xmath75mev  ( d).,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ] -7 mm    -7 mm    in what follows we will suggest a possible resolution of this problem . </S>",
    "<S> the basic observation is captured in figure  [ fig:4 ] : the effective charge with a gluon mass ( dashed curves ) and the analytic charge ( [ aicm ] ) ( solid curves ) coincide for a large range of momenta , and they only begin to differ appreciably in the deep infrared domain ( @xmath76 ) . in this region the analytic charge ( [ aicm ] ) rises abruptly , almost doubling its size between @xmath77 and @xmath78 , whereas the running coupling  ( [ jprc ] ) in the same momentum interval remains essentially fixed to a value of about  0.6 . </S>",
    "<S> a possible picture that seems to emerge from this observation is the following . </S>",
    "<S> it may be that the concept of the dynamically generated gluon mass fails to capture all the relevant dynamics in the very deep infrared , where confinement or other nonperturbative effects make their appearance . at that point </S>",
    "<S> it may be preferable to switch to a description in terms of the analytic charge ( [ aicm ] ) , which ( i )  coincides with that of cornwall in the region where the latter furnishes a successful description of data , and ( ii )  in addition , because it overcomes the critical value @xmath63 , offers the possibility of accounting for csb at the level of gap equations . </S>",
    "<S> it would be interesting to carry out a detailed study of the gap equation , with the analytic charged plugged into , in order to verify if indeed one encounters nontrivial solutions , whose size is phenomenologically relevant , and if a reasonable value of the pion - decay constant @xmath79 may be obtained . </S>"
