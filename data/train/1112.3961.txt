    "recently the atlas and cms collaborations have reported important exclusions in the higgs mass with about @xmath6 fb@xmath7 of accumulated luminosity  @xcite .",
    "however , both experiments observe excess signal events at low masses .",
    "the most significant of these is in the diphoton channel @xmath8 channel , which would point to a higgs mass of @xmath9gev . for atlas",
    "@xcite the local significance of this excess is of @xmath10 , whereas for cms  @xcite it is about @xmath11 .",
    "atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite also observe modest excesses in the @xmath12 channel with local significance not musch above @xmath13 , as well as cms  @xcite has also searched for an enhanced @xmath14 signal coming from vector boson fusion ( vbf ) , which could be associated with fermiophobic higgs models . with cuts that significantly reduce the gluon fusion contribution ,",
    "cms has found a @xmath15 excess .",
    "finally , atlas  @xcite has also search for similar signals , which are enhanced by a cut in the transverse momentum of the diphoton system .",
    "they found an excess of about @xmath16 .",
    "thus , taken all combined , both experiments appear to coincide in the existence of a diphoton excess somewhere around @xmath17 , while differing on the invariant mass of the less significant excesses observed in @xmath18 , as well as in @xmath19 .",
    "in this paper we consider the possibility that the excess in the @xmath1 channel is real , but that it is caused by the pseudo - scalar state @xmath20 in a two - higgs doublet model ( thdm ) .",
    "we assume that the spectrum of the thdm is inverted with respect to what is usually considered , for instance in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm )  @xcite : @xmath20 is the lightest state , with @xmath21 much heavier and with small splittings among them  @xcite . in considering this possibility",
    ", we must address the vbf - enriched samples in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , which find excesses in regions that favor vbf and disfavor gluon fusion .",
    "however , the excesses are still small ( @xmath16 and @xmath15 for cms and atlas respectively ) , and the techniques used new . in any case , the pure gluon fusion interpretation is still compatible with both the atlas and cms data at about the @xmath16 level  @xcite .",
    "so more data is needed .",
    "the inverted spectrum can naturally appear in a generic thdm , just by choosing the right set of parameters in the potential , even after demanding tree - level unitarity and stability , as well as the correct minimum for electroweak symmetry breaking  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , this spectrum of the thdm is typical in models of where un - confined fermions condense to break the electroweak symmetry dynamically  @xcite , due to the existence of an approximate peccei - quinn symmetry which keeps the pseudo - scalar state light in comparison t the rest of the scalars .",
    "whatever the origin of this scalar spectrum , the first signal of it would be the observation of @xmath22 if @xmath23gev , just as is the case of the sm higgs .",
    "the production cross section times branching ratio for @xmath24 need not be the same as that of the sm higgs .",
    "in fact the atlas signal is somewhat larger that the sm prediction for a higgs of @xmath25gev . on the other hand ,",
    "since @xmath20 has no tree - level couplings to @xmath26 and @xmath27 , these channels would not be observed for the lightest mass peak .",
    "more importantly , the current excesses in the vbf channels studied by atlas and cms should disappear .",
    "if this is the case , other channels will have to be studied to confirm the thdm explanation . in",
    "what follows , we specify the parameter space of this scenario as well as its predictions for future lhc data samples .",
    "we also point out the strategy for finding the other states that would confirm the thdm hypothesis . finally , we speculate on the possible dynamical origin of this peculiar thdm spectrum and its relation to theories of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) .",
    "in order to specify the phenomenology of the thdm we must define the scheme of fermion couplings .",
    "there are four possible choices that would avoid flavor changing neutral currents ( fcncs ) at tree level : the so called type i , type ii , lepton - specific and flipped schemes  @xcite , depending on the choice of doublet responsible of the masses of right - handed fermions .",
    "the couplings of the scalar sector are determined by @xmath28 , the ratio of vacuum expectation values of the two doublets , and the mixing angle @xmath29 between the neutral cp - even scalars . however , the couplings of @xmath20 to fermions only depend on @xmath30 .",
    "for instance , the couplings of @xmath20 to all up - type quarks in all four schemes is @xmath31 . on the other hand , its couplings to down - type , go like @xmath31 in the type  i and lepton - specific case , whereas they go like @xmath32 for the type  ii and flipped schemes .",
    "finally , the couplings of charged leptons to @xmath20 in type  i and flipped scenarios go like @xmath33 , while the same couplings in type  ii and lepton - specific schemes go like @xmath32 .",
    "we are interested in calculating the @xmath34 in the inverted thdm .",
    "the production cross section for @xmath35 is given by  @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the sm @xmath38 production cross section , the functions in ( [ aprod ] ) are given by : @xmath39/\\tau^2~ , \\label{is}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath40 ^ 2~ , & \\tau>1 \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] expressed in terms of the variable @xmath41 .",
    "the factor @xmath42 in ( [ aprod ] ) depends on the choice of thdm scheme : for type  i and lepton specific models , @xmath43 , while for type  ii and flipped cases we have @xmath44 . for moderate values of @xmath32",
    "the top quark contribution dominates the @xmath45 vertex .",
    "the b quark term is important for large @xmath32 in the type  ii and flipped schemes .",
    "similarly , we can compute the @xmath22 decay width normalized by the sm @xmath46 width , obtaining @xmath47 where @xmath48 are the charges of up and down type quarks and the @xmath49 contribution to the sm higgs decay to diphotons is accounted for by the function @xmath50/\\tau^2~. \\label{iw}\\ ] ]    we are now ready to compute the @xmath51 in the inverted thdm normalized by the analogous sm higgs process .",
    "we have not included qcd corrections to the quark contributions since they largely cancel in the ratio .",
    "vs. @xmath32 .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to the type  i and lepton - specific schemes , with the solid curve being for the type  ii and flipped cases .",
    "the horizontal dotted line corresponds to @xmath52 equal to the prediction for this process mediated by the sm higgs . ]    in figure  [ fig:1 ] we plot the ratio @xmath53 vs. @xmath32 .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to the type  i and lepton - specific schemes , with the solid curve being for the type  ii and flipped cases .",
    "we see that excesses over the sm prediction for @xmath54 can only be obtained for @xmath55 or so .",
    "larger values of @xmath32 would imply @xmath56 , in contradiction with the atlas data , as long as we interpret it as purely coming from signal ( i.e. not aided by a significant upward fluctuation ) .",
    "the top yukawa coupling only becomes non - perturbative for @xmath57 , so these values are safe  @xcite .",
    "thus , we see that the inverted thdm can explain the diphoton signal at the lhc for these small values of @xmath32 .",
    "this region of parameter space is allowed by all other data .",
    "in addition to the absence of fcnc at tree level , the loop contributions to fcnc processes are safely below bounds given that the charged states of the model , @xmath58 , are assumed to have masses well in excess of the @xmath59c.l . bound @xmath60 gev which is mostly driven by @xmath61  @xcite",
    "it is also generally compatible with precision electroweak constraints . in figure",
    "[ fig : st ] we show the contributions to the @xmath62 and @xmath63 parameters the inverted thdm .",

    "gev , and @xmath65 , with @xmath66 and @xmath67 varying in the range @xmath68gev .",
    "a scan over this parameter space results in the points in the figure .",
    "the ones outside the @xmath69  c.l . contour come from larger values of @xmath70 , which result in large custodial breaking .",
    "we take @xmath71gev  @xcite . ]    for the two choices @xmath72  gev and @xmath73  gev , we vary @xmath66 and @xmath67 in the range @xmath68gev .",
    "the points represent the results of scanning over this range .",
    "we also show the @xmath74 and @xmath75  c.l .",
    "intervals obtained from a fit of electroweak data as performed in ref .",
    "@xcite using @xmath71gev .",
    "we can see from figure  [ fig : st ] that there are many solutions within the inverted thdm spectrum that are compatible with electroweak bounds .",
    "the points falling out of the allow region are those with large values of @xmath70 , which represent a breaking of custodial symmetry . as long as this mass difference is not large compared to @xmath76",
    ", the inverted thdm spectrum is within the allowed values of the electroweak parameters @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the bounds on higgs searches from atlas and cms suggest that the rest of the scalar spectrum of the thdm is quite heavy .",
    "a detailed study of the exclusion is left for ref .",
    "but we can see that the neutral states , @xmath77 and @xmath78 , are not excluded by the sm higgs bounds obtained using the standard channels , due to a combination of them being heavy plus the fact that other decay channels are open for their decays .",
    "in particular , the decay channels @xmath79 that are competitive with @xmath80 and @xmath81 , the channels that drive the bounds on large sm higgs masses . in order to illustrate this we show in figure  [ fig:2 ] the branching fractions of the lightest cp - even neutral scalar @xmath77 for the type  ii case ..     vs. @xmath82 , for @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85gev . here",
    "@xmath86 refers to all sm fermions , and the couplings to them are type  ii . ]",
    "the branching ratios are computed for @xmath85gev and @xmath87 , which would correspond to a diphoton signal at about the same level of the sm higgs , as can be seen in figure  [ fig:1 ] .",
    "we used a negligibly small value of the mixing angle @xmath84 which comes from the typical parameter space studied here and also is typical in the models presented in the next section .",
    "this results in an important coupling of @xmath77 to the top quark , making @xmath88 an important decay channel above threshold .",
    "more importantly , we see that the @xmath26 and @xmath27 channels used by atlas and cms to put bounds on the mass of the higgs now have to compete with the @xmath4 and @xmath5 channels",
    ". in fact , the lhc bounds on higgs searches do not apply to the thdm @xmath77 once its mass is above @xmath4 threshold or about @xmath89gev .",
    "the @xmath26 only becomes more important than the @xmath4 channel for rather large masses .",
    "similarly , we plot the the branching fractions for the decays of the heavier cp - even state , @xmath78 , in figure  [ fig:3 ] .    , vs. @xmath66 , for @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85gev . here",
    "@xmath86 refers to all sm fermions , and the couplings to them are type  ii . ]",
    "thus , we see that the search for the neutral states in the inverted thdm should include , in addition to the @xmath26 and @xmath27 channels , the @xmath90 and @xmath91 . in both cases",
    "the @xmath20 should be reconstructed to have the same mass as the one in the @xmath1 channel , which would provide a nice confirmation of the model  @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of the inverted thdm presented here , with a light pseudo - scalar with @xmath92gev , and heavy masses for the scalars @xmath21 in the @xmath93gev range , is compatible with tree - level unitarity . to check this we test the parameters of the model by calculating the scattering matrix of scalar interactions .",
    "we require that the eigenvalues of this matrix be smaller than @xmath94 , corresponding to saturation .",
    "all the points in the parameter space considered here satisfy this constraint  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the large masses for the scalars point to the existence of a strongly coupled sector wich should appear not too far above the scalar masses .",
    "thus , this scenario for the scalar spectrum of the thdm should be accompanied by new states not too far above the scalar masses , such as new gauge bosons and/or new fermions .",
    "we will present such an example in the next section .",
    "although in principle the inverted thdm spectrum can always be considered as a possibility , it is interesting to ask whether such spectrum can be obtained dynamically .",
    "the typical mssm scalar spectrum requires a light scalar , so the pseudo - scalar is rather heavy , or much lighter as in the nmssm  @xcite .",
    "a techni - pion in techni - color models could be light  @xcite , but the rest of the thdm is missing . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that this inverted thdm is precisely obtained in theories where the condensation of a fermion sector leads to ewsb . in these models",
    "the new chiral fermions feel a strong interaction at the few tev scale , condensing and breaking the electroweak symmetry .",
    "since both the up - type and down - type right - handed fermions condense with the left - handed doublet , the resulting scalar spectrum at low energies is that of the thdm .",
    "furthermore , the presence of a peccei - quinn symmetry in the fermion theory , only broken by the new interaction s instanton effects , guarantees that the cp - odd state @xmath20 is the lightest state of the scalar spectrum .",
    "the rest of the spectrum , given by @xmath21 , is much heavier as is expected from the condensation of fermions with a cutoff scale in the multi - tev region .",
    "the scalars are also somewhat degenerate giving this inverted thdm a very interesting phenomenology at the lhc .",
    "the bounds from electroweak precision measurements vary somewhat in the presence of the new fermions , but it is still possible to have agreement with them , as shown in ref .  @xcite .",
    "the simplest model for the condensing fermions is to assume that they are quarks belonging to a fourth generation  @xcite .",
    "however , this assumption together with the hypothesis that the diphoton signal comes from the pseudo - scalar @xmath20 is in great tension with the recent lhc data . in order to see this , we first consider the contributions of the fourth generation quarks to the @xmath45 vertex .",
    "the dynamics of the condensation naturally selects the type  ii scheme for the fourth generation  @xcite , so it is natural to adopt it for all four generations . with the addition of the fourth - generation quarks , now eq .",
    "( [ aprod ] ) for the @xmath35 production cross section reads @xmath95 where the last two terms are the contributions of the @xmath96 and @xmath97 fourth - generation quarks , respectively . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the condensation models typically select @xmath98 .",
    "thus , we see that the production cross section is greatly enhanced , by a factor of about 9 at leading order . on the other hand , and unlike the case for the higgs in the presence of a fourth generation  @xcite , the @xmath99 is not suppressed in the presence of the fourth generation since there is no w contribution against which to cancel . to the numerator in the expression ( [ adecay ] ) , we must now add @xmath100 as a result the @xmath101 branching ratio is also enhanced .",
    "all in all , the @xmath102 in the fourth generation model is larger than the sm analogous rate by a factor of 10 for @xmath103 and @xmath85gev , which is excluded by the lhc data .",
    "although not motivated by the condensation models , we could consider type  i thdm with a fourth generation .",
    "the resulting ratio of @xmath104 to the corresponding sm prediction for the higgs is plotted as the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] .",
    "we see that for this case , it is possible to generate rates consistent with or slightly above the sm rates for a higgs of the same mass , as long as @xmath105 .",
    "another possibility for generating the inverted thdm spectrum is to just consider that the condensing fermions , although chiral , do not carry color  @xcite . in this case",
    "the strong interaction responsible for fermion condensation is not related to @xmath106 . with this assumption",
    ", the new heavy fermions do not contribute to the @xmath107 vertex , leaving this to be just as in eq .",
    "( [ aprod ] ) for the three generation case . on the other hand",
    ", the fact that the new fermion condensates break the electroweak symmetry , implies that they must have couplings to the photon , and therefore they will contribute to the @xmath108 vertex .",
    "if for concreteness we assume that the exotic fermions have the same charges as the up and down quarks , and that the new strong interaction requires that there be @xmath109 copies of them ( e.g. the new interaction is @xmath110 ) , we can make a definite prediction for the new fermion contributions to the @xmath111 by just using ( [ adecay ] ) supplemented by ( [ fgadd ] ) with @xmath109 substituting @xmath112 .     vs. @xmath32 , for @xmath85gev , in a model with colorless chiral fermions .",
    "the line of for the type  ii scheme .",
    "the horizontal dashed line corresponds to @xmath52 equal to the prediction for this process mediated by the sm higgs . ]    as an example , in the solid line of figure  [ fig:4 ] we plot the ratio @xmath113 for a model with colorless chiral fermions including a doublet and two singlets with the same hypercharges as the fourth generation quarks , and for @xmath114 .",
    "although the new fermions are typically heavy ( @xmath115gev ) , the results depend little on the value of their mass as long as they are significantly heavier than the top quark .",
    "we see that , although the curve is somewhat shifted upwards with respect to the three - generation thdm case of figure  [ fig:1 ] , it is still possible to obtain cross sections for the @xmath1 channel that are of order of the sm higgs ones , or even somewhat larger as long as @xmath116 , which is the value selected by the dynamics of the fermion condensation models .",
    "the atlas and cms data are beginning to probe the scalar sector of the sm , the least known sector of the theory .",
    "it is important that we consider alternatives to the one doublet case , and that we study the resulting phenomenology in light of the coming increased data samples . in this letter",
    "we have studied the possibility that the diphoton signal observed in atlas and cms is due to the pseudo - scalar , cp - odd , state @xmath20 of a thdm where it is the lightest scalar in the spectrum . if this were the case , no @xmath26 and @xmath27 signal should be confirmed at the diphoton invariant mass , @xmath117gev .",
    "furthermore , the vbf - enriched channels of diphoton production , studied by both collaborations with different methods should , be accounted for only from the gluon fusion process .",
    "these channels are new and the excesses found are still small .",
    "but if they are confirmed with more data they would put severe constraints to their interpretation as coming purely from gluon fusion . depending on where the results of atlas and cms settle in these channels , it may or may not be possible to accommodate the thdm interpretation . for this , more data is needed .",
    "we computed the signal cross section into diphotons and showed that it could explain the observations in the diphoton channel at the lhc for small values of @xmath32 , as it can be seen in figure  [ fig:1 ] .",
    "given these values of @xmath32 , we predict the branching fractions for the cp - even neutral states , shown in figures  [ fig:2 ] and [ fig:3 ] , and show that the new decay modes @xmath118 and @xmath119 are competitive enough so that these states , if heavy enough , are not affected by the lhc bounds on the sm higgs . in general , it is enough for cp - even masses to be above the @xmath4 threshold , or @xmath120gev , for them not to be bound by the existing lhc data up to rather very large values .",
    "the confirmation of this scenario requires the search for these decay modes in the @xmath121 , and @xmath122  @xcite .    the inverted thdm spectrum can be dynamically generated by models where chiral fermions interact strongly with a new interaction at the tev scale , leading to their condensation and ewsb  @xcite .",
    "we showed that the lhc diphoton signal can only be accommodated in these models if the new fermions are either colorless , so as to not affect significantly the productions vertex , or in type  i scenarios which are not motivated in fourth generation condensation models  @xcite .",
