    "the high temperature gap ( 2@xmath33 @xmath2 100mev ) is close to the intrinsic value of 140mev estimated from resistivity measurements on polycrystalline samples or single crystals@xcite above room temperature .",
    "the plateau in the resistivity curves near 50 - 80k suggests a possible phase transition in this temperature region .",
    "there is no evidence , however , of a phase transition in x - ray , neutron and heat capacity data.@xcite the behavior between 50 - 80k is likely related to the decrease in carrier mobility with increasing temperature when phonon scattering dominates the carrier relaxation time .",
    "this scattering effect is generally observable when the carrier density in the conduction band is relatively constant , which is possible in this temperature range considering the magnitude of the high - temperature band gap and the analysis of the hall data presented below .",

    "all hall resistivity data are linear in applied magnetic field at least up to fields of 4 tesla , independent of whether the current is along [ 110 ] or [ 001 ] .",
    "we note that the hall data for crsb@xmath0 are easier to analyze than for fesb@xmath0 , since @xmath37 is linear in field for crsb@xmath0 at all temperatures where bipolar conduction is not present , unlike the complicated field dependence of @xmath37 exhibited by fesb@xmath0.@xcite the most striking feature of the hall data is the maximum that occurs in the magnitude of the hall resistivity at t@xmath215k , corresponding to an apparent minimum in the carrier concentration .",
    "this is more evident when the apparent carrier concentration ( determined from the one band expression n@xmath38@xmath391/@xmath37 ) is plotted versus temperature ( see fig.[hall]c ) .",
    "the hall and seebeck signals are both negative below 250k . at high temperatures ( @xmath40250k )",
    "large numbers of intrinsic electrons and holes are excited in crsb@xmath0 , and the hall signal is found to be positive while the seebeck coefficient remains negative .",
    "the minimum gap between the valence and conduction bands of crsb@xmath0 is estimated to be 140mev.@xcite this implies that intrinsic electron - hole pairs can be neglected for temperatures less than about 50k . below 50k , the apparent carrier concentration continues to decrease which suggests a freeze out of extrinsic carriers into a donor band .",
    "the position of the donor level is estimated from the resistivity data to be in the range of 16mev below the conduction band edge .",
    "the source of extrinsic electrons in crsb@xmath0 is unknown .",
    "a slight sb deficiency ( @xmath20.00001 ) could account for the low temperature ( 5k ) carrier concentration of about 3@xmath910@xmath34electrons/@xmath11 , as could a small amount of electronically active impurities in the starting materials or from the alumina crucibles .",
    "a minimum in the apparent carrier concentration is unusual , but it has been observed in semiconductors such as ge , @xcite as well as in fesb@xmath0 and feas@xmath0.@xcite in ge , the extrinsic carriers freeze out into a low mobility impurity band that is close to the conduction ( or valence ) band edge . when the impurity level is within a few mev of the conduction or valence band edge , and the total concentration of dopants is in the range of 10@xmath34carrier/@xmath11 , a low temperature minimum in the apparent carrier concentration can be observed .",
    "it is important to stress that the carriers are not entirely localized in the donor band , though conduction in this band occurs with a low mobility and may be hopping - type conduction .",
    "indeed , the obtained temperature dependence of n@xmath38 originates in the dominance of the donor band conductivity at temperatures below the minimum in n@xmath38 .    to determine the occupation of the dopant and conduction bands with increasing temperature",
    ", we use a simple model of two localized levels , where the occupation of conduction ( band ) levels is given by :    @xmath41    where @xmath27 is the energy difference between the two levels , and @xmath42 is the degeneracy of the conduction level relative to the dopant level .",
    "the energy of the dopant level is defined to be at e=0 .",
    "the number of electrons remaining in the impurity band , n@xmath43 , is 3@xmath910@xmath34 - n@xmath44 . for temperatures less than about 50k , intrinsic conduction ( the valence band ) can be neglected , and the system is in the regime of k@xmath28t/@xmath27 @xmath45 1 .",
    "we note that in this temperature regime the standard expression@xcite for the number of electrons in the conduction band is n@xmath44 @xmath2 n@xmath46exp(-@xmath27/k@xmath28 t ) , where n@xmath46 is the effective density of states of the conduction band , implying that in our simplified model @xmath42 is proportional to n@xmath46 .    for the two band system ,",
    "the apparent carrier concentration is given by @xmath47    where @xmath48 is ratio of the mobility of an electron in the conduction band to the value in the impurity band .",
    "this simple expression provides a good description of the hall data , particularly for temperatures less than about 30k , as shown in fig.[napp ] .",
    "although the exact fitting values given in the caption of fig.[napp ] should not be taken too seriously because of the extreme simplicity of the model , they do indicate that the mobility of the conduction level is about 130 times higher than that of a donor level and the donor band lies @xmath216mev below the conduction band .",
    "since crsb@xmath0 is antiferromagnetic , there is the possibility of an anomalous hall effect contribution to the measured data.@xcite this would add a term to the inferred hall coefficient which is proportional to the magnetic susceptibility . in the temperature range of interest ( t@xmath3050k ) the magnetic susceptibility of crsb@xmath0 is temperature independent for all orientations of the crystal with respect to the applied magnetic field , and all isothermal m versus h curves are linear up to the maximum field of 7 t. @xcite any anomalous hall effects would therefore result in at most a temperature independent offset in the hall coefficient or inferred carrier concentration , and could not account for the observed minimum in fig .",
    "the observation that the magnetic susceptibility varies by about 50% between the two directions measured,@xcite while the inferred carrier concentration at the lowest temperatures are essentially independent of orientation ( fig.[napp ] ) , suggests that anomalous hall effects are negligible in this material at the temperatures where the hall data are analyzed .     with current along either [ 001 ] ( solid squares ) or [ 110 ] ( solid circles ) with the values calculated from two electron bands : a low mobility donor level , e@xmath49 , in the gap a distance @xmath27 below the conduction band edge at e@xmath46 .",

    "the shape of s(t ) is very similar to that previously reported for some fesb@xmath0 single crystals,@xcite although there is some controversy as to how large s can be in fesb@xmath0 .",
    "@xcite in crsb@xmath0 single crystals , a minimum in s(t ) of @xmath2 -4500@xmath3v / k occurs at 18k . from 18k to 10k",
    "there is a rapid decrease in the magnitude of s , while s changes much more slowly from 10 - 2k .",
    "the seebeck data below 50k are very similar in shape to the hall data from the same temperature range ( see fig[napp ] ) .",
    "for a two band system the seebeck coefficient is given by the seebeck coefficient of each band weighted by the electrical conductivity of each band.@xcite .",
    "the rapid drop in s below 18 k can be accounted for by the thermal depopulation of electrons from the non - degenerate conduction band into the low mobility and degenerate donor band upon cooling .",
    "below 10k , the seebeck coefficient is approximately linear in temperature and is dominated by donor band conduction .",
    "the large magnitude of s at 18k is difficult to reconcile with a purely electronic mechanism , particularly since the cr moments order at t@xmath1 @xmath2 273k and hence there is no additional magnetic entropy to be removed at lower temperatures . the heat capacity and lattice thermal conductivity data , which are discussed below , are consistent with a phonon drag mechanism as the origin of the large values for s near 20k .",
    "we note that the crsb@xmath0 seebeck data were reproducible using crystals from different growths and by measuring the seebeck data using different heating and cooling parameters . the very similar shape between the seebeck data from fesb@xmath0@xcite and the seebeck data shown in fig.[seebeck ] , suggests a similar origin for the effect .",

    "the debye temperature is 281k , which implies an average sound velocity of v@xmath51 = 2700 m/s .",
    "although crsb@xmath0 is magnetically ordered below t@xmath1= 273k , at low temperatures there is a substantial gap in the spin wave spectrum of about 25mev.@xcite thus the heat capacity below 7k is only due to phonons .     crystals .",
    "the thermal conductivity was measured along the @xmath18 direction and perpendicular to @xmath18 ( along [ 110]).,width=288 ]    the thermal conductivity data for two crsb@xmath0 single crystals are shown in fig.[kappa ] for heat flow along the @xmath18 direction , @xmath52 , and along [ 110 ] , @xmath53 . for temperatures below 50k ,",
    "the thermal conductivity data are very similar in both directions with a large maximum of 300 - 400w / m - k near 12k .",
    "this is approximately a factor of 10 larger than that observed in polycrystalline crsb@xmath0.@xcite this implies that the average mean free path for phonons at low temperature is about 10 times smaller in the polycrystalline samples . for the polycrystalline samples @xcite",
    "the peak in the seebeck data is also a factor of 10 smaller .",
    "all of these observations are consistent with a phonon drag mechanism as the origin of the large peak in the seebeck data near 18 k , as is discussed in more detail below .",
    "the electronic contribution to the thermal conductivity is estimated to be negligible at all temperatures using the wiedemann - franz law and the resistivity data shown in fig.[resist ] the effect of subtracting the electronic contribution to the data shown in fig.[kappa ] is less than the size of the data symbols used in the figure .    above 50k , @xmath52 is substantially larger than @xmath53 .",
    "the magnetic excitations in crsb@xmath0 are quasi-1d with high spin - wave velocities along the @xmath18 direction .",
    "it is possible that the excess heat carried along the @xmath18 direction is due to spin - waves since in this direction the spin wave velocities are about three times larger than the average sound velocity for crsb@xmath0 .",
    "the gap of 25mev in the spin - wave spectrum at the zone center is also consistent with an onset of spin - wave heat conduction near 50k .",
    "however , since @xmath52 is not an order of magnitude larger than @xmath53 , it is also possible that the magnetic excitations scatter phonons more strongly for @xmath53 thereby suppressing @xmath53 relative to @xmath52 .",
    "there is no simple way to distinguish between these two possibilities for crsb@xmath0 .",
    "substantial heat conduction by magnetic excitations has been clearly demonstrated in the insulating spin - ladder compound ca@xmath54la@xmath55cu@xmath56o@xmath57 . along the ladder direction",
    "the heat conducted by spin - waves at room temperature is comparable to the heat conducted by metallic platinum.@xcite in the spin - ladder compound , however , it was found that a small amount of electronic conduction tended to greatly reduce the spin - wave heat conduction due to electron - magnon scattering .",
    "it is likely that the presence of conduction electrons in crsb@xmath0 has a similar effect .",
    "a quantitative estimate of a phonon drag contribution to the seebeck coefficient is difficult .",
    "an approximate estimate@xcite for the phonon drag contribution to s is given by s@xmath58=@xmath59v@xmath51l@xmath60/@xmath3 t , where @xmath59 is a parameter that characterizes the relative strength of the electron - phonon interaction with 0@xmath611 , and @xmath3 is the mobility of electrons in the conduction band . using the measured low temperature values for the heat capacity and thermal conductivity , the estimated mean free path for phonons , l@xmath60 , is about 7@xmath3 m at 18k . using the simple two band analysis of the hall data , presented above , yields a value of @xmath3 @xmath62 500 - 2500cm@xmath23/v - s at 18k depending on whether the current is along [ 110 ] or along the @xmath18 axis .",
    "this yields s@xmath58=@xmath59(20 - 100)mv / k at 18k , which indicates that phonon drag could account for a large percentage of the negative peak in the seebeck data shown in fig.[seebeck ] .",

    "we note that the high values of the seebeck coefficient can not be explained in terms of the behavior of a standard doped semiconductor model with temperature independent doping in the absence of phonon drag or some other enhancement.@xcite this is because , although the thermopower may increase as one decreases the carrier concentration , this increase will be limited by bi - polar conduction at a finite temperature .",

    "the hall and seebeck coefficients are both negative for temperatures below 250 k. the sharp maximum in the magnitude of the hall resistivity for temperatures near 18k clearly suggests two electron bands influence electrical transport at low t. the resistivity and hall data are consistent with an occupied low - mobility donor band at 2k with the conduction band edge about 16mev higher in energy .",

    "<S> resistivity , hall effect , seebeck coefficient , thermal conductivity , heat capacity , and magnetic susceptibility data are reported for crsb@xmath0 single crystals . in spite of some unusual features in electrical transport and hall measurements below 100k , only one phase transition is found in the temperature range from 2 to 750k corresponding to long - range antiferromagnetic order below t@xmath1 @xmath2 273k . </S>",
    "<S> many of the low temperature properties can be explained by the thermal depopulation of carriers from the conduction band into a low mobility band located approximately 16 mev below the conduction band edge , as deduced from the hall effect data . in analogy with what occurs in ge , </S>",
    "<S> the low mobility band is likely an impurity band . </S>",
    "<S> the seebeck coefficient , s , is large and negative for temperatures from 2 to 300k ranging from @xmath2 -70@xmath3v / k at 300k to -4500@xmath3v / k at 18k . </S>",
    "<S> a large maximum in @xmath4s@xmath4 at 18k is likely due to phonon drag with the abrupt drop in @xmath4s@xmath4 below 18k due to the thermal depopulation of the high mobility conduction band . </S>",
    "<S> the large thermal conductivity between 10 and 20k ( @xmath2 350w / m - k ) is consistent with this interpretation , as are detailed calculations of the seebeck coefficient made using the complete calculated electronic structure . </S>",
    "<S> these data are compared to data reported for fesb@xmath0 , which crystallizes in the same marcasite structure , and fesi , another unusual narrow - gap semiconductor . </S>"
