    "<S> we investigate the behavior of single polyelectrolytes in multivalent salt solutions under the action of electric fields through computer simulations . the chain is unfolded in a strong electric field and aligned parallel to the field direction , and </S>",
    "<S> the chain size shows a sigmoidal transition . the unfolding electric field </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 depends on the salt concentration and scales as @xmath1 with @xmath2 being the ellipsoidal volume occupied by the chain . </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude of the electrophoretic mobility of chain drastically increases during the unfolding . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that @xmath0 depends on the chain length provides a plausible mechanism to separate long charged homopolymers by size in free solution electrophoresis via the unfolding transition of globule polyelectrolytes condensed by multivalent salt .    </S>",
    "<S> electrophoresis is an important separation technique in molecular biology and chemical analysis  @xcite . nonetheless , in a free solution </S>",
    "<S> , polyelectrolytes ( pes ) like dna molecules can not be size - separated in an electric field  @xcite owing to the proportionality of the hydrodynamic friction and the total charge of the molecule to its chain length  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , to separate homo - pes by size is commonly carried out in a sieving matrix , like gel  @xcite , in which biased reptation is responsible of the separation mechanism  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , efforts have been continually put into free solution electrophoresis ( fse ) due to its high throughput and analysis efficiency , compared to the gel electrophoresis ( ge ) . </S>",
    "<S> a breakthrough was done by a method called `` end - labeled free - solution electrophoresis '' ( elfse )  @xcite . in elfse , </S>",
    "<S> the friction to charge balance is broken by attaching uncharged giant molecules or polymers to the ends of the pes , producing a length - dependent electrophoretic mobility  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , netz proposed a new strategy to separate homo - pes by size based upon drastic change of migration speed in the unfolding of collapsed pes by an electric field  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> he predicted that the electric field to unfold a chain , @xmath0 , follows the scaling law @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the chain length and @xmath5 the swelling exponent . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , longer chains will be unfolded and separated out using a smaller electric field . </S>",
    "<S> it could be a plausible way to sequence dna , providing a read - length of hundred - kilo bases  @xcite , in comparison with thousand bases in capillary ge and hundred bases in elfse  @xcite . in this study </S>",
    "<S> , we use a coarse - grained model to verify the prediction of netz for the first time by means of computer simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the objective is to understand how electric fields influence the conformation of single chains and the electrophoretic mobility .    </S>",
    "<S> there are many ways to collapse pe chains  @xcite , for e.g. , reducing the temperature , decreasing the dielectric constant of solvent , modifying the chain charge density , and so on . </S>",
    "<S> adding multivalent salt into the solution is a simple way to initiate the collapse at ambient condition . </S>",
    "<S> it is the condensation of multivalent counterions on the chains which induces the chain collapse  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the collapsed pes exhibit the most compact structure at the salt concentration @xmath6 where the multivalent counterions and the chains are in charge equivalence  @xcite , resulting in a nearly zero effective chain charge and hence zero electrophoretic mobility  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the condensation of multivalent counterions also leads to two very relevant phenomena , _ overcharging _ and _ charge inversion _  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we showed in a recent study  @xcite that although charge overcompensation ( i.e.  overcharging ) occurs on the surface of pe at high salt concentrations , the effective chain charge may not invert its sign ; in other words , charge inversion does not necessarily happen with overcharging . in that study , </S>",
    "<S> the effective chain charge was calculated by the ratio of the electrophoretic mobility to the diffusive mobility , and the applied electric field was very weak , keeping unmodified the chain conformation . the fact that a strong electric field could largely change the conformation and mobility lightens up a possible way to separate pes by size and drives our motivation to study the electrophoretic behavior of pes in multivalent salt solutions . </S>",
    "<S> this kind of study , interplaying at the same time the strength of electric field and the salt concentration , is still few in literatures , specially by a method able to provide information at molecular level </S>",
    "<S> . it will enrich our understanding of the behavior of pes in the presence of multivalent counterions in a whole range of electric field . in netz </S>",
    "<S> s study  @xcite , a pe was collapsed in a salt - free solution by decreasing the dielectric constant . </S>",
    "<S> although his results gave a valuable picture of pe behavior , a more realistic system such as salt - collapsed pes in electric fields should be investigated in detail in order to put into reality of his idea . moreover , to unravel a dna molecule is a key issue in dna sequencing and diagnostics . </S>",
    "<S> it can be done by several methods such as optical tweezers  @xcite , flows  @xcite , and electric fields  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this work can provide deep insight of the unraveling of charged biopolymers in electric fields .    </S>",
    "<S> we simulate a single pe chain using a bead - spring chain model , consisting of @xmath4 monomers . </S>",
    "<S> each monomer carries a negative unit charge @xmath7 and the adjacent monomers are connected by virtual springs described by a finitely extensible nonlinear elastic potential @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the bond length , @xmath10 the maximum extention , and @xmath11 the spring constant . </S>",
    "<S> we add ( 4:1)-salt into the system and hence there are three kinds of ions in the solution : the tetravalent cations ( counterions ) and monovalent anions ( coions ) dissociated from the added salt , and the @xmath4 monovalent cations dissociated from the chain . </S>",
    "<S> the excluded volume of the monomers and ions is modeled by a shifted lennard - jones potential @xmath12 ^ 2 $ ] truncated at its minimum where @xmath13 represents the particle diameter and @xmath14 the coupling strength . </S>",
    "<S> the particles also interact with each other via coulomb interaction @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath17 the absolute temperature , @xmath18 the charge valence , @xmath19 the distance and @xmath20 the bjerrum length ( @xmath21 the vacuum permittivity ) . </S>",
    "<S> the solvent is considered as a continuum medium of dielectric constant @xmath22 and its effect on the chain and ions is implicitly taken into account by langevin equation @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the @xmath25th particle mass and @xmath26 the friction coefficient , @xmath27 the conservative force acting on the particle , and @xmath28 the random force satisfying the fluctuation - dissipation theorem : @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> the system is placed in a periodic box , subject to an external electric field @xmath30 pointing toward @xmath31-direction . </S>",
    "<S> ewald sum is applied to calculate coulomb interaction . we know that in dilute solutions without electric fields , the dynamics of chain is described by zimm dynamics  @xcite . however , under the action of electric fields , the coions and the counterions move in opposite directions , which largely cancels out the hydrodynamic effect in the solutions . as well documented in the literatures  @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> hydrodynamic interaction is shielded in a typical electrophoretic condition . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we neglect it in this study . </S>",
    "<S> we remark that this effect will become important when the chain length is very short  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we assume that all the monomers and ions have identical mass @xmath32 and diameter @xmath13 . in the following text </S>",
    "<S> , we choose @xmath13 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 to be the unit of length , mass , and energy , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the time unit will be @xmath34 , the unit of concentration @xmath35 , the unit of electric field @xmath36 , and so on . </S>",

    "<S> the chain length @xmath4 is varied from @xmath42 to @xmath43 and the volume of simulation box is changed accordingly to keep constant the monomer concentration @xmath44 at @xmath45 . for a short chain ( @xmath46 ) , we use a cubic box whereas for a long chain ( @xmath47 ) , a rectangular box elongated in the field direction is used to prevent chain overlapping under periodic boundary condition . </S>",
    "<S> the sides of the rectangular box are equal to @xmath48 in @xmath49- and @xmath50-directions and @xmath51 in @xmath31-direction . </S>",
    "<S> salt concentration @xmath52 is varied from @xmath53 to @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> the strength of the electric field @xmath55 is changed from @xmath53 to @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> we launch langevin dynamics simulations  @xcite with a time step equal to @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> a pre - run of @xmath58 time steps is performed to bring the system to a steady state and a production run is then executed for , at least , @xmath59 time steps .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : p1n48_rg_re.eps](a ) , we show the variation of chain size for a pe of @xmath60 , characterized by the square of radius of gyration , @xmath61 , against @xmath52 under the action of different electric field @xmath55 .     vs.  @xmath52 in different @xmath55 . </S>",

    "<S> this size decrease is the well - known salt - induced condensation  @xcite . because we focus here on the behavior of condensed pes in electric fields , the value of @xmath52 is not so elevated to be able to observe the chain decondensation . at a really high @xmath52 </S>",
    "<S> , the pe is expected to attain the size of its neutral counterpart  @xcite . under the action of an electric field , @xmath65 becomes larger . </S>",
    "<S> the stronger the electric field , the larger the deviation from the chain size in the zero field . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , there is a threshold of electric field near @xmath66 , smaller than which the chain is basically not deformed by the field at @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> it shows that a coil pe ( in @xmath68 ) is easier to be deformed than a condensed pe ( in @xmath67 ) . for @xmath69 , </S>",
    "<S> the chain reexpansion is suppressed by the strong field and @xmath65 decreases with @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> a very strong field ( @xmath70 ) can completely prevent the collapse of the pe and @xmath65 is a constant , indicating a chain unfolding . </S>",
    "<S> we have verified that the unfolded chain is aligned parallel to the field direction . </S>",
    "<S> the degree of unfolding can be studied by calculating the ratio of the end - to - end distance @xmath71 to the contour length @xmath72 and the results are plotted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : p1n48_rg_re.eps](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> each curve denotes a salt concentration and exhibits a sigmoidal variation against @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> the sharp transition of the curve suggests the existence of a critical electric field @xmath0 to unfold a chain , over which the chain is stretched and @xmath62 drastically increases . in this study , the chain is unfolded up to a value of @xmath71 , @xmath73 of the contour length , and hence displays like a rod . </S>",
    "<S> the transition occurs at different @xmath55 , showing that @xmath0 depends on @xmath52 .    </S>",
    "<S> we determine @xmath0 by equating the polarization energy @xmath74 to the thermal energy @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the induced dipole moment in the electric field @xmath77  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is because the thermal fluctuation can destroy the polarization order while @xmath78 and hence , @xmath55 is too weak to perturb the chain orientation and conformation . in solutions , </S>",
    "<S> charged chains can form complexes with ions . to calculate @xmath76 </S>",
    "<S> , we need to know first the `` members '' of the pe complex . </S>",
    "<S> we define the members to be the monomers and ions lying in a worm - shaped tube around pe , which is the union of spheres of radius @xmath79 , centered at each center of the monomers . </S>",
    "<S> we choose @xmath80 . inside this tube , the kinetic energy ( @xmath81 ) of a counterion is smaller than the coulomb attraction to a monomer and hence , the ion is `` bound '' to the chain . </S>",

    "<S> we rederive here the scaling law of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the general polarizability is a tensor and can be written as @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the depolarization tensor and @xmath2 is the volume of the dielectric object  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for a fixed geometry , thus a fixed @xmath102 , the polarizability is proportional to @xmath2 . in this study , @xmath103 , which implies @xmath104 . in netz </S>",
    "<S> s theory , @xmath2 was simply estimated by @xmath105 . here , we do it in a more precise way , from the gyration tensor of the chain . </S>",

    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : p1nxx_ce_rg_v2.eps](c ) shows that @xmath92 follows _ a priori _ a power law . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of finite chain length is more important in this case because an ellipsoidal description is good only when chain length is long . </S>",
    "<S> fitting the data for @xmath109 gives @xmath110 and @xmath111 for the two cases , which yields @xmath112 and @xmath113 , in good agreement with the results of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : p1nxx_ce_rg_v2.eps](a ) .    knowing that @xmath0 depends on @xmath4 , we study now the electrophoretic mobility of pe , @xmath114 , for different chain length . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath114 is calculated by @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the velocity of the center of mass of pe in the field direction . </S>",

    "<S> ( c ) number of condensed tetravalent counterions on each monomer of the pe of @xmath117 in different strength of @xmath55.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    in weak fields , @xmath114 is zero , showing that the pes are of charge neutral in the salt solutions . </S>",
    "<S> this confirms the experimental observations  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as soon as @xmath55 is strong enough to unfold the chain , @xmath114 shows a drastic decrease in accompany with chain unfolding . </S>",
    "<S> the net chain charge is hence negative . </S>",
    "<S> the longer the chain length , the sharper the unfolding transition and also the decrease of @xmath114 . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that the occurrence of the @xmath114-decrease is @xmath4-dependent provides a good mechanism to separate pes by the chain length . </S>",
    "<S> one advantage to do electrophoresis at @xmath6 is that only the chains being unfolded will be moved out by the electric field , leaving the shorter chains in the center . for @xmath118 </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath114 shows a plateau when the chain is completely unfolded , which is basically independent of chain length . </S>",
    "<S> this predicts a field - independent free - draining behavior when the chains are stretched . </S>",
    "<S> we have verified that in this region , the number of the condensed tetravalent counterions is roughly a constant . fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : p1nxx_mupe_re.eps](c ) shows the variation of these ions distributed along the chain backbone of @xmath117 in different @xmath55 fields . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution changes from a horizontal line ( of value 0.25 ) at @xmath119 where the chain is in a collapsed state , to a line inclined toward the field direction at @xmath120 where the chain is unfolded , followed by a tangential ( @xmath66 ) and then a horizontal ( @xmath121 ) sigmoidal curve . in a high field region @xmath122 , the baseline of the distribution moves downward , showing a decrease of the number of the condensed ions , which implies the further decrease of @xmath114 . </S>",
    "<S> we have calculated the electrophoretic mobility of the condensed tetravalent counterions , @xmath123 . </S>",
    "<S> the value is zero when the chain is collapsed . </S>",
    "<S> once the chain is unfolded , @xmath123 becomes positive and increases with @xmath55 ; thus , the ions are not tightly bound to the chain in the electric fields but glide along the chain following the field direction . </S>",
    "<S> they can fly away off the chain and other ions condense onto it , establishing a dynamic equilibrium which keeps constant the number of the condensed ions .    </S>",
    "<S> the results clearly demonstrate the possibility to separate pes by size in multivalent salt solutions under the action of appropriate electric fields . mapping our models to a pe in an aqueous solution at room temperature yields @xmath124   and hence , the critical field @xmath125 for @xmath60 is equivalent to @xmath126v / cm in real unit . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , to unfold a pe chain with @xmath127 demands @xmath0 of a value roughly 2 kv / cm according to the scaling law , which is feasible in experiments and can be applied to separate long polymer chains in compliment to the current fse methods . </S>",
    "<S> our results confirm the idea of netz  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for practical reason , we wish the value of @xmath0 to be as small as possible . to achieve this goal </S>",
    "<S> , we can use trivalent salt , or even divalent salt , to condense pes to a less - compact collapsed chain structure  @xcite , which will reduce @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we remark that multivalent salt can also induce multi - chain aggregation . </S>",
    "<S> to diminish this effect , salt of small ion size should be used as the condensing agent , which induces mainly single chain collapse  @xcite .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have studied the static and dynamic properties of homo - pes in multivalent salt solutions under the action of electric fields . </S>",
    "<S> the electrophoretic mobility of pe shows a drastic decrease due to the change of the effective chain charge while the chain is unfolded . the unfolding electric field </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 sensitively depends on the chain length . by studying the scaling law of @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> , we presented the first , strong evidence of the feasibility to separate homo - pes by size , via unfolding transition , in free solution electrophoresis .    </S>",
