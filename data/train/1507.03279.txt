    "thanks to the great efforts of many people in both nuclear physics and astrophysics communities , much progress has been made in recent years in constraining the density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy around the saturation density @xmath4 , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite for comprehensive reviews . at supra saturation densities , however , even the tendency of the is still controversial based on the model analyses of very limited data available .",
    "moreover , predictions on the high - density behavior of nuclear symmetry energy based on both microscopic many - body theories and phenomenological models diverge broadly mainly because of our poor knowledge about the spin - isospin dependence of nuclear many - body forces , isospin - dependence of short - range correlations , the nature of tensor forces , etc , besides the well - known difficulties of treating precisely quantum many - body problems @xcite .",
    "heavy - ion collisions are the only means in terrestrial laboratories to create dense nuclear matter .",
    "to pin down the high - density symmetry energy has been one of the major goals of the low - intermediate energy heavy - ion reaction community in recent years . among the potential probes of the high - density symmetry energy ,",
    "the in heavy - ion collisions has attracted much attention since it was first proposed @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , several model analyses @xcite of some existing data have so far been inconclusive . realizing the importance of thoroughly understanding all aspects of the @xmath5 dynamics in isospin - asymmetric matter especially since several experiments measuring the are currently underway at riken @xcite and nirs @xcite besides those planned at other facilities @xcite , significant efforts have been made recently in studying effects of the in - medium pion production threshold @xcite , pion mean - field @xcite , electromagnetic field @xcite , neutron - skin @xcite and nucleon - nucleon short - range correlation @xcite on pion production mostly at intermediate energies above the pion production threshold of about 300 mev / a .",
    "extending these efforts , we report here results of a study on effects of the completely unknown symmetry ( isovector ) potential of the on both the total and differential @xmath2 ratios in heavy - ion collisions at beam energies from 100 to 1000 mev / a within an isospin - dependent transport model ibuu @xcite .",
    "it is found that the @xmath2 ratio of energetic pions remain a useful probe of the high - density without much influence by the completely unknown symmetry potential of the @xmath0 resonance .",
    "the density dependence of the potential symmetry energy used in this study.,width=340,height=302 ]    we first recall here briefly the major ingredients and new modifications of the ibuu transport model that are relevant for this study .",
    "first of all , to ease future comparisons with studies using other transport models , for the isoscalar potential we use the momentum - independent bkd ( bertsch - kruse - das gupta ) nucleon potentials @xcite with an incompressibility of @xmath7 mev that is a common option in most transport models developed for investigating heavy - ion reactions .",
    "this choice does not affect our qualitative conclusions as we are dealing with the ratios of charged pions that are insensitive to the nucleon isoscalar potential .",
    "on the other hand , it allows us to generate timely enough reaction events necessary for studying various cases of deeply sub - threshold pion production using the best high - performance computing resources available to the author today .",
    "we caution , however , to compare with data of ongoing experiments to constrain quantitatively the at supra saturation densities using the differential of energetic pions , the momentum dependence of both the isoscalar and isovector potentials of nucleons and @xmath0 resonances should be considered carefully .    for the purpose of this work , it is sufficient and more economic to use the simplest parameterization for the density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy @xmath3 .",
    "since the earlier studies about effects of nuclear symmetry energy on several properties of neutron stars @xcite and the isospin dynamics of heavy - ion collisions @xcite , one often parameterizes the as @xmath8 + e_{{\\textrm{s}}ym}(\\rho_{0})f(u),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the typical function @xmath9 being @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the reduced baryon density , @xmath12 mev is the fermi energy and @xmath13 mev is the symmetry energy at @xmath4 .",
    "the selected three forms of the f(u ) span a large uncertain range of @xmath3 .",
    "what is important for the present study is the potential symmetry energy given in the second part of eq .",
    "[ esymfu ] and shown in fig . [ esym ] .",
    "assuming there is no momentum dependence , the nucleon symmetry potential @xmath14 up to the linear term in the isospin asymmetry @xmath15 of nucleonic matter can be obtained from taking the partial derivative of the potential symmetry energy density with respect to the neutron or proton density @xcite .",
    "the @xmath14 corresponding to the three functions of @xmath9 is given by , respectively , @xmath16 where the @xmath17 sign is for neutrons / protons and @xmath18 .",
    "we notice here that the potential symmetry energy density for @xmath19 and @xmath20 also contributes a term proportional to @xmath21 to the isoscarlar potential .",
    "however , such a term in heavy - ion collisions is negligibly small compared to the isoscalar potential corresponding to the eos of symmetric matter .    associated with the @xmath22-n-@xmath0 dynamics in nuclei , nuclear reactions and neutron stars , the isoscalar potential for",
    "the has been extensively studied for a long time using various many - body theories and interactions , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite . for a comprehensive review of the relevant issues ,",
    "we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite . indeed , there are indications from analyses of electron - nucleus , photoabsorption and pion - nucleus scattering that the @xmath0 isoscalar potential @xmath23 is in the range of @xmath24 with respect to the nucleon isoscalar potential @xmath25@xcite .",
    "since a constant potential has no dynamical effect in heavy - ion reactions and there is no information available as to how the difference in the isoscalar potentials for nucleons and @xmath0 resonances depend on the density and/or other properties of the medium , in this study we thus use the same isoscalar potentials for nucleons and @xmath0 resonances .",
    "the mean - field potential of pions in neutron - rich matter is an interesting issue . while there is some information about the strength of pion potential in nuclei from study pionic atoms , there is little information about its density , isospin and momentum dependence in nuclear matter . recognizing its possible importance but also considering the currently existing controversies about it , we neglect here the pion mean - field .    as pointed out already in ref .",
    "@xcite , we essentially know nothing about the isovector ( symmetry ) potential of the in isospin - asymmetric nuclear matter . in heavy - ion collisions near the pion production threshold ,",
    "the @xmath0 population is very small .",
    "for example , for @xmath26sn+@xmath27sn reaction at a beam energy of 400 mev / nucleon and an impact parameter of 1 fm , the maximum total multiplicity of @xmath0 resonances in all charge states reached during the reaction is about 4 @xcite .",
    "this is about 3.2% of the total number of nucleons involved .",
    "thus , the mean - field potential of @xmath0 is mainly due to its interactions with nucleons not other @xmath0 resonances .",
    "therefore , similar to nucleons , the isovector potential of @xmath0 resonances is also proportional to the isospin asymmetry @xmath28 of nucleons due to the isospin - dependent @xmath29 term in the @xmath30 interaction @xcite .",
    "the population of @xmath0 only has a small perturbative effect on the isospin asymmetry @xmath28 of nucleonic matter . assuming the @xmath31 meson exchange among nucleons and baryon resonances is mainly responsible for the isovector interactions , there is a simple scaling relation between the @xmath32 and @xmath33 coupling constants @xmath34 and @xmath35 in free - space based on the quark model of baryons @xcite .",
    "however , the relationship between the isovector potentials of nucleons and baryon resonances in isospin - asymmetric matter is completely unknown .",
    "in fact , the critical density for formation in neutron stars has been found to depend almost linearly on the unknown ratio @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "depending on the assumed value of @xmath37 , the formation of can even happen at @xmath4 and affect significantly properties of neutron stars @xcite .",
    "in addition , the isovecor lorentz - scalar @xmath28-meson may also play some roles in determining the baryon isovector potentials",
    ". however , its couplings with baryons are even less known .",
    "thus , because of their ramifications in both nuclear physics and astrophysics both the isoscalar and isovector parts of the @xmath0 potential deserve further investigations . in particular , it would be interesting to know if any observable in heavy - ion collisions especially those induced by neutron - rich nuclei may be used to probe the @xmath0 isovector potential in neutron - rich matter .    in two earlier studies @xcite ,",
    "the isovector potential of @xmath0 resonances was connected to that of nucleons based on rather different assumptions . in ref .",
    "@xcite and subsequently many other studies , considering the @xmath0 as a molecule consisting of a nucleon and a pion , the isovector potential of the @xmath0 resonance is an average of that for neutrons and protons with weights given by the square of the clebsch - gordon coefficients in the @xmath38 processes conserving the total isospin . under these assumptions , one has @xcite @xmath39 assuming that baryon isovector potentials are all due to the @xmath31 meson exchange neglecting possible contributions of the @xmath28-meson , the above prescription is equivalent to setting @xmath40 . in line with the above assumption , taking into account the small contributions of the @xmath0 resonances",
    "the effective isospin asymmetry @xmath41 of the excited baryonic matter can be obtained from @xmath42 where @xmath43 it is evident that the @xmath41 reduces naturally to the isospin asymmetry @xmath28 of nucleonic matter as the beam energy becomes smaller than the pion production threshold .    while in ref .",
    "@xcite , the following prescription according to the effective charge of the was used @xmath44 this prescription is equivalent to setting @xmath45 , thus the magnitudes of these isovector potentials for are 3 times that of eq .",
    "[ dpot1 ] .",
    "we emphasize that the ratios of @xmath0 isovector potentials for different charge states are the same in both prescriptions . in this work ,",
    "we use the symmetry potentials in eq .",

    "we can explore effects of the isovector potential of on pion observables in heavy - ion collisions .     the mean lifetime ( black line ) of as a function of its mass .",
    "the dashed line at 1.7 fm / c indicates the lifetime of the @xmath0 as its centroid mass of 1232 mev .",
    "the blue lines are the @xmath0 mass distributions in @xmath47 collisions at nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) center of mass energy of @xmath48 gev and 2.32 gev corresponding to first chance nn collisions in nucleus - nucleus reactions at a beam energy of 500 and 1000 mev / nucleon , respectively.,width=491,height=377 ]",
    "whether the @xmath0 potential has any observable effect in heavy - ion collisions depends strongly on the lifetime of over which the @xmath0 potential acts to modify its momentum .",
    "it is thus important to outline how we model the mass distribution and the corresponding width of the in heavy - ion collisions . as discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite and reviewed in ref .",
    "@xcite , in the ibuu transport model the mass @xmath49 of a baryon resonance @xmath50 ( @xmath0 or @xmath51 ) produced in an inelastic nucleon - nucleon collision @xmath52 is generated according to a modified breit - wigner function @xcite @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the final nucleon momentum in the nn center of mass frame , @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the centroid and width of the resonance , respectively .",
    "as noticed earlier @xcite , the @xmath54 surpreses significantly the @xmath0 production near its maximum mass of @xmath57 compared to the simple breit - wigner function widely used in many transport models .",
    "this effect is especially significant when the @xmath58 is less than 1232 mev in sub - threshold pion production . for @xmath59 , the width @xmath56 is given by @xcite @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the pion momentum in the @xmath0 rest frame in the @xmath62 decay process . during each time step of very small length @xmath63 ,",
    "a monte carlo sampling of the @xmath0 decay is carried out according to the probability @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the @xmath0 mean lifetime .",
    "it is necessary to mention that there are many interesting issues regarding the @xmath0 spectroscopy in neutron - rich matter to be studied @xcite , such as the possible modification of its width ( lifetime ) and centroid mass .",
    "moreover , there are already some interesting work on the delay times of @xmath47 scattering , how the width of in the scattering should be modeled quantum mechanically and whether pions should be directly produced without going through the intermediate at all in heavy - ion collisions @xcite .",
    "these issues are not addressed here .",
    "our calculation of the lifetime of the is rather standard used in most transport models .",
    "moreover , as discussed in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite , in ibuu we use free - space @xmath47 cross sections and the scattering kinematics is that in vacuum . this is a good approximation when nucleons and @xmath0 resonances have the same momentum - independent potential , since in this case the baryon potentials before and after the nn collision cancel out in the energy conservation equation . in other cases , however , our treatment is equivalent to neglecting residual effects of the baryon mean - field potential on the nn center of mass energy @xmath66 , except those through the momenta of the colliding nucleons from their earlier propagation in the medium .",
    "as we noticed earlier , how the isospin and momentum dependent potentials of nucleons and @xmath0 resonances may affect particle production thresholds is an interesting issue under investigation by several other groups .",
    "we also plan to address this issue within the ibuu approach in the near future .     the @xmath67 ratio as a function of time in head - on au+au reactions at a beam energy of 100 , 200 , 500 and 1000 mev / nucleon with the same f(u)=u but 3 different @xmath46 values.,width=377,height=566 ]     the as a function of pion kinetic energy in head - on au+au reactions at a beam energy of 200 mev / nucleon with the same f(u)=u but three different isovector potentials for the @xmath0 resonance.,width=377,height=340 ]    as discussed earlier @xcite and seen clearly in fig",

    "pions from decays of these resonances may then carry some information about the @xmath0 potential . on the contrary , as indicated by the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ tau ] , the @xmath0 resonance around its mass centroid of 1232 mev has a lifetime of only about 1.7 fm / c which is too short for the @xmath0 mean - field to cause any significant change in its momentum .",
    "moreover , subsequent @xmath68 reaction cycles tend to destroy the memory of the pion about the dynamical history of its parent @xmath0 .",
    "the two blue lines are the @xmath0 mass distributions in @xmath47 collisions at the nn center of mass energy of @xmath48 gev and 2.32 gev corresponding to the first - chance nn collisions in nucleus - nucleus reactions at a beam energy of 500 and 1000 mev / nucleon without considering contributions of the initial nucleon fermi momentum , respectively .",
    "it is seen that at 1000 mev / nucleon , the @xmath0 mass distribution peaks around 1232 mev .",
    "the @xmath0 resonances created at this beam energy are thus mostly very short - lived .",
    "as the beam energy decreases towards sub - threshold energies , e.g. , at 500 mv / nucleon , more long - lived low - mass @xmath0 resonances are produced .",
    "one thus expects that pions from heavy - ion collisions at sub - threshold beam energies to be more sensitive to the @xmath0 potential than reactions at higher beam energies .",
    "moreover , only a small fraction of nucleons go through the @xmath0 resonances for a relatively short time interval compared to the whole reaction period over which the nucleon potential acts continuously .",

    "the more energetic pions are not much affected at all by the @xmath0 potential even at such a deeply sub - threshold beam energy .",
    "again , this is due to the mass - dependent lifetime of the @xmath0 resonance .",
    "the low ( high ) energy pions are mainly from the long- ( short- ) lived , low ( high ) mass @xmath0 resonances .",
    "thus , to investigate the isovector potential of one should focus on the of low energy pions for which the coulomb fields are also important but are well understood .",
    "the observation that the uncertain isovector potential of the has almost no effect on the differential of energetic pions is very encouraging .",

    "we notice that the current uncertainty of the potential symmetry energy at supra saturation densities going from large negative to positive values is much larger than the difference between the @xmath82 and @xmath83 used as examples here @xcite .",
