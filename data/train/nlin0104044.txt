    "one of the most surprising results of the last decades in the field of stochastic processes has been the discovering that fluctuation terms ( loosely called _ noise _ ) can actually induce some degree of order in a large variety of non - linear systems .",
    "the first example of such an effect is that of _",
    "stochastic resonance_@xcite by which a bistable system responds better to an external signal ( not necessarily periodic ) under the presence of fluctuations , either in the intrinsic dynamics or in the external input .",
    "this phenomenon has been shown to be relevant for some physical and biological systems described by nonlinear dynamical equations @xcite .",
    "other examples in purely temporal dynamical systems include phenomena such as noise - induced transitions@xcite , noise - induced transport@xcite , coherence resonance@xcite , etc . in extended systems",
    ", noise is known to induce a large variety or ordering effects@xcite , such as pattern formation@xcite , phase transitions@xcite , phase separation@xcite , spatiotemporal stochastic resonance@xcite , noise - sustained structures@xcite , doubly stochastic resonance@xcite , amongst many others .",
    "all these examples have in common that some sort of _ order _ appears only in the presence of the right amount of noise .",
    "there has been also some recent interest on the interplay between chaotic and random dynamics .",
    "some counterintuitive effects such as coherence resonance , or the appearance of a quasi  periodic behavior , in a chaotic system in the presence of noise , have been found recently@xcite .",
    "the role of noise in standard synchronization of chaotic systems has been considered in @xcite , as well as the role of noise in synchronizing non  chaotic systems@xcite . in this paper",
    "we address the different issue of synchronization of chaotic systems by a common random noise source , a topic that has attracted much attention recently .",
    "the accepted result is that , for some chaotic systems , the introduction of the same noise in independent copies of the systems could lead ( for large enough noise intensity ) to a common collapse onto the same trajectory , independently of the initial condition assigned to each of the copies .",
    "this synchronization of chaotic systems by the addition of random terms is a remarkable and counterintuitive effect of noise and although some clarifying papers have appeared recently , still some contradictory results exist for the existence of this phenomenon of noise  induced synchronization .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to give further analytical and numerical evidence that chaotic systems can synchronize under such circumstances and to analyze the structural stability of the phenomenon .",
    "moreover , the results presented here clarify the issue , thus opening directions to obtain such a synchronization in electronic circuits , for example for encryption purposes .",
    "common random noise codes have been used in spread spectrum communication since a long time ago @xcite .",
    "the main idea is to mix a information data within a noisy code . at the receiver",
    ", the information is recovered using a synchronized replica of the noise code .",
    "more recently , the use of common noise source has been also proposed as a useful technique to improve the encryption of a key in a communication channel @xcite .",
    "the issue of ordering effect of noise in chaotic systems was considered already at the beginning of the 80 s by matsumoto and tsuda@xcite who concluded that the introduction of noise could actually make a system less chaotic .",
    "later , yu , ott and chen@xcite studied the transition from chaos to non  chaos induced by noise .",
    "synchronization induced by noise was considered by fahy and hamman@xcite who showed that particles in an external potential , when driven by the same random forces , tend to collapse onto the same trajectory , a behavior interpreted as a transition from chaotic to non  chaotic behaviors .",
    "the same system has been studied numerically and analytically@xcite .",
    "pikovsky @xcite analyzed the statistics of deviations from this noise - induced synchronization .",
    "a paper that generated a lot of controversy was that of maritan and banavar@xcite .",
    "these authors analyzed the logistic map in the presence of noise :    @xmath0     + where @xmath1 is the noise term , considered to be uniformly distributed in a symmetric interval @xmath2 $ ] .",
    "they showed that , if @xmath3 was large enough ( i.e. for a large noise intensity ) two different trajectories which started with different initial conditions but used otherwise the same sequence of random numbers , would eventually coincide into the same trajectory .",
    "the authors showed a similar result for the lorenz system ( see section [ lorenz ] ) .",
    "this result was heavily criticized by pikovsky@xcite who proved that two systems can synchronize only if the largest lyapunov exponent is negative .",
    "he then argued that the largest lyapunov exponent of the logistic map in the presence of noise is always positive and concluded that the synchronization was , in fact , a numerical effect of lack of precision of the calculation .",
    "the analysis of pikovsky was confirmed by longa _",
    "et al_. @xcite who studied the logistic map with arbitrary numerical precision .",
    "the criterion of negative lyapunov exponent has also been shown to hold for other types of synchronization of chaotic systems and zhou and lai@xcite noticed that previous results by shuai , wong and cheng@xcite showing synchronization with a positive lyapunov exponent were again an artifact of the limited precision of the calculation .",
    "in addition to the above criticisms , herzel and freund@xcite and malescio@xcite pointed out that the noise used to simulate eq.([map ] ) and the lorenz system in @xcite is not really symmetric . while the noise in the lorenz system is non  symmetric by construction , in the case of the map , the non  zero mean arises because the requirement @xmath4 , actually leads to discard the values of the random number @xmath5 which would induce a violation of such condition .",
    "the average value of the random numbers which have been accepted is different from zero , hence producing an effective _ biased _ noise , i.e. one which does not have zero mean .",
    "the introduction of a non - zero mean noise means that the authors of @xcite were altering essentially the properties of the deterministic map .",
    "furthermore , gade and bassu@xcite argued that the synchronization observed by maritan and banavar is due to the fact that the bias of the noise leads the system to a non  chaotic fixed point . with only this basis , they concluded that a zero  mean noise can never lead to synchronization in the lorenz system .",
    "the same conclusion was reached by snchez _",
    "et al_.@xcite who studied experimentally a chua circuit and concluded that synchronization by noise only occurs if the noise does not have a zero mean .",
    "the same conclusion is obtained in @xcite by studying numerically a single and an array of lorenz models , and in @xcite from experiments in an array of chua circuits with multiplicative colored noise .",
    "therefore , from these last works , a widespread belief has emerged according to which it is not possible to synchronize two chaotic systems by injecting the same noisy unbiased , zero  mean , signal to both of them .",
    "contrary to these last results ( but in agreement with the previously mentioned results @xcite ) , lai and zhou@xcite have shown that some chaotic maps can indeed become synchronized by additive zero  mean noise . a similar result has been obtained by loreto _",
    "et al_. @xcite , and by minai and anand@xcite , in the case where the noise appears parametrically in the map .",
    "the implications to secure digital communications have been considered in @xcite , and an application to ecological dynamics in fluid flows is presented in @xcite .",
    "an equivalent result about the synchronization of lorenz systems using a common additive noise has been shown by the authors of the present paper in@xcite .",
    "the actual mechanism that leads to synchronization has been explained by lai and zhou@xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "as pikovsky@xcite required , synchronization can only be achieved if the lyapunov exponent is negative .",
    "the presence of noise allows the system to spend more time in the  convergence region \" where the local lyapunov exponent is negative , hence yielding a global negative lyapunov exponent .",
    "this argument will be developed in more detail in section [ maps ] , where an explicit calculation in a simple map will confirm the analysis .",
    "the results of lai and zhou have been extended to the case of coupled map lattices@xcite where pikovsky s criterion has been extended for spatially extended systems .    in this paper",
    "we give further evidence that it is possible to synchronize two chaotic systems by the addition of a common noise which is gaussianly distributed and not biased .",
    "we analyze specifically some 1-d maps and the lorenz system , all in the chaotic region .",
    "the necessary criterion introduced in ref . @xcite and",
    "the general arguments of @xcite are fully confirmed and some heuristic arguments are given about the general validity of our results .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section [ maps ]",
    "we present numerical and analytical results for some 1-d maps , while section [ lorenz ] studies numerically the lorenz system . in section",
    "[ structural ] we analyze the structural stability of the phenomenon , i.e. the dependence of the synchronization time on the parameter mismatch .",
    "finally , in section [ conclusions ] we present the conclusions as well as some open questions relating the general validity of our results .",
    "the first example is that of the map : @xmath6 where @xmath5 is a set of uncorrelated gaussian variables of zero mean and variance 1 . as an example",
    ", we use explicitly @xmath7 \\label{eq:3}\\ ] ] studying the convergence or divergence of trajectories of eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) starting from different initial conditions under the same noise @xmath5 is equivalent to analyzing the converge or divergence of trajectories from two identical systems of the form ( [ eq:2 ] ) driven by the same noise .",
    "we plot in fig.(1 ) the bifurcation diagram of this map in the noiseless case .",
    "we can see the typical windows in which the system behaves chaotically .",
    "the associated lyapunov exponent , @xmath8 , is positive in these regions .",
    "for instance , for @xmath9 ( the case we will be considering throughout the paper ) it is @xmath10 . in fig.(2 )",
    "we observe that the lyapunov exponent becomes negative for most values of @xmath11 for large enough noise level @xmath12 .",
    "again for @xmath9 and now for @xmath13 it is @xmath14 .",
    "a positive lyapunov exponent in the noiseless case implies that trajectories starting with different initial conditions , but using the same sequence of random numbers @xmath15 , remain different for all the iteration steps . in this case , the corresponding synchronization diagram shows a spread distribution of points ( see fig.(3a ) ) .",
    "however , when moderate levels of noise ( @xmath16 ) are used , @xmath8 becomes negative and trajectories starting with different initial conditions , but using the same sequence of random numbers , synchronize perfectly , see the synchronization diagram in fig.(3b ) .",
    "obviously , the noise intensity in the cases shown is not large enough such as to be able to neglect completely the deterministic part of the map .",
    "therefore , the synchronization observed does not trivially appear as a consequence of both variables becoming themselves identical to the noise term .    according to @xcite , convergence of trajectories to the same one , or lack of sensitivity to the initial condition ,",
    "can be stated as _ negativity of the lyapunov exponent_. the lyapunov exponent of the map ( [ eq:2 ] ) is defined as    @xmath17     + it is the average of ( the logarithm of the absolute value of ) the successive slopes @xmath18 found by the trajectory .",
    "slopes in @xmath19 $ ] contribute to @xmath8 with negative values , indicating trajectory convergence .",
    "larger or smaller slopes contribute with positive values , indicating trajectory divergence .",
    "since the deterministic and noisy maps satisfy @xmath20 one is tempted to conclude that the lyapunov exponent is not modified by the presence of noise .",
    "however , there is noise - dependence through the trajectory values @xmath21 , @xmath22 . in the absence of noise",
    ", @xmath8 is positive , indicating trajectory separation . when synchronization is observed , the lyapunov exponent is negative , as required by the argument in @xcite .",
    "notice that this definition of the lyapunov exponent assumes a fixed realization of the noise terms , and it is the relevant one to study the synchronization phenomena addressed in this paper .",
    "one could use alternative definitions @xcite .",
    "for instance , if one considers the coupled system of both the @xmath23 variable and the noise generator producing @xmath24 , then the largest lyapunov exponent of the composed system is indeed positive ( and very large for a good random number generator ) .",
    "this simply tells us that there is a large sensitivity to the initial condition of the composed system @xmath25 as shown by the fact that a change of the seed of the random number generator completely changes the sequence of values of both @xmath24 and @xmath23 .",
    "we consider in this paper the situation described by definition ( [ lyapunov2 ] ) with fixed noise realization .    by using the definition of the _ invariant measure on the attractor _ , or _ stationary probability distribution _",
    "@xmath26 , the lyapunov exponent can be calculated also as @xmath27 here we see clearly the two contributions to the lyapunov exponent : although the derivative @xmath28 does not change when including noise in the trajectory , the stationary probability does change ( see fig.4 ) , thus producing the observed change in the lyapunov exponents .",
    "synchronization , then , can be a general feature in maps , such as ( [ eq:3 ] ) , which have a large region in which the derivative @xmath29 is smaller than one .",
    "noise will be able to explore that region and yield , on the average , a negative lyapunov exponent .",
    "this is , basically , the argument developed in @xcite .    in order to make some analytical calculation that can obtain in a rigorous way the transition from a positive to negative lyapunov exponent , let us consider the map given by eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) and @xmath30 + with @xmath31 .",
    "this particular map , based in the tent map @xcite , has been chosen just for convenience .",
    "the following arguments would apply to any other map that in the absence of noise takes most frequently values in the region with the highest slopes , but which visits regions of smaller slope when noise is introduced .",
    "this is the case , for example , of the map ( 3 ) . in the case of ( [ twotents ] ) , the values given by the deterministic part of the map , after one iteration from arbitrary initial conditions , fall always in the interval @xmath32",
    "this is the region with the highest slope @xmath33 . in the presence of noise",
    "the map can take values outside this interval and , since the slopes encountered are smaller , the lyapunov exponent can only be reduced from the deterministic value . to formally substantiate this point ,",
    "it is enough to recall the definition of lyapunov exponent ( [ lyapunov2 ] ) : an upper bound for @xmath34 is @xmath35 , so that a bound for @xmath8 is immediately obtained : @xmath36 .",
    "equality is obtained for zero noise .",
    "the interesting point about the map",
    "( [ twotents ] ) and similar ones is that one can demonstrate analytically that @xmath8 can be made negative .",
    "the intuitive idea is that it is enough to decrease @xmath37 in order to give arbitrarily small values to the slopes encountered outside @xmath32 , a region accessible only thanks to noise . to begin with ,",
    "let us note that @xmath38 if @xmath39 , and @xmath40 if @xmath41 , so that an upper bound to ( [ lyapunov2 ] ) can be written as @xmath42 @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the proportion of values of the map inside @xmath45 and outside this interval , respectively , and we have used that as @xmath46 they converge to @xmath47 and @xmath48 , the invariant measure associated to @xmath49 and to the rest of the real line , respectively ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "a sufficient condition for @xmath51 to fall outside @xmath49 is that @xmath52 .",
    "thus , @xmath53 , where we have used the gaussian character of the noise . in consequence , one finds from ( [ bound ] ) @xmath54 the important point is that @xmath55 is independent on the map parameters , in particular on @xmath37 .",
    "thus , ( [ rebound ] ) implies that by decreasing @xmath37 the value of @xmath8 can be made as low as desired . by increasing @xmath12 such that @xmath56 , @xmath8 will be certainly negative .",
    "thus we have shown analytically that strong enough noise will always make negative the lyapunov exponent of the map ( [ twotents ] ) and , accordingly , it will induce yield `` noise - induced synchronization '' in that map .",
    "in this section we give yet another example of noise  induced synchronization .",
    "we consider the well known lorenz@xcite model with additional random terms of the form@xcite :    @xmath57     + @xmath24 is white noise : a gaussian random process of mean zero , @xmath58 and delta  correlated , @xmath59 .",
    "we have used @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 which , in the deterministic case , @xmath63 are known to lead to a chaotic behavior ( the largest lyapunov exponent is @xmath64 ) . as stated in the introduction ,",
    "previous results seem to imply that synchronization is only observed for a noise with a non  zero mean .",
    "however , our results show otherwise .",
    "we have integrated numerically the above equations using the stochastic euler method @xcite .",
    "specifically , the evolution algorithm reads : @xmath65 \\nonumber \\\\",
    "y(t+\\delta t ) & = & y(t ) + \\delta t \\left [ -x(t ) z(t ) + r x(t ) -y(t ) \\right ] \\label{eq : euler}\\\\    &   + & \\epsilon \\sqrt{\\delta t } g(t ) \\nonumber \\\\",
    "z(t+\\delta t ) & = & z(t)+ \\delta t \\left [ x(t ) y(t ) -b z(t)\\right ] \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] + the values of @xmath66 are drawn at each time step from an independent gaussian distribution of zero mean and variance one and they have been generated by a particularly efficient algorithm using a numerical inversion technique@xcite .",
    "the time step used is @xmath67 and simulations range typically for a total time of the order of @xmath68 ( in the dimensionless units of the lorenz system of equations ) .",
    "the largest lyapunov exponent has been computed using a simultaneous integration of the linearized equations@xcite . for the deterministic case , trajectories starting with different initial conditions",
    "are completely uncorrelated , see fig .",
    "this is also the situation for small values of @xmath12 .",
    "however , when using a noise intensity @xmath69 the noise is strong enough to induce synchronization of the trajectories .",
    "again , the presence of the noise terms forces the largest lyapunov exponent to become negative ( for @xmath69 it is @xmath70 ) . as in the examples of the maps , after some transient time , two different evolutions which have started in completely different initial conditions synchronize towards the same value of the three variables ( see fig .",
    "( 5b ) for the @xmath71 coordinate ) . therefore , these results prove that synchronization by common noise in the chaotic lorenz system does occur for sufficiently large noise intensity .",
    "this result contradicts previous ones in the literature@xcite .",
    "the main difference with these papers is in the intensity of the noise : it has to be taken sufficiently large , as here , in order to observe synchronization .",
    "notice that although the noise intensity is large , the basic structure of the  butterfly \" lorenz attractor remains present as shown in fig .",
    "( 6 ) . again",
    ", this result shows that , although the noise intensity used could be considered large , the synchronization is rather different from what would be obtained from a trivial common synchronization of both systems to the noise variable by neglecting the deterministic terms .",
    "an important issue concerns the structural stability of this phenomenon , in particular how robust is noise synchronization to small differences between the two systems one is trying to synchronize . whether or not the synchronization of two trajectories of the same noisy lorenz system ( or of any other chaotic system ) observed here , equivalent to the synchronization of two identical systems driven by a common noise , could be observed in the laboratory , depends on whether the phenomenon is robust when allowing the two lorenz systems to be not exactly equal ( as they can not be in a real experiment ) .",
    "if one wants to use this kind of stochastic synchronization in electronic emitters and receivers ( for instance , as a means of encryption ) one should be able to determine the allowed discrepancy between circuits before the lack of synchronization becomes unacceptable .",
    "additional discussions on this issue may be found in @xcite .",
    "we consider the following two maps forced by the same noise : @xmath72 linearizing in the trajectory difference @xmath73 , assumed to be small , we obtain @xmath74 we have defined @xmath75 , and we are interested in the situation in which the two systems are just slightly different , for example , because of a small parameter mismatch , so that @xmath76 will be small in some sense specified below .",
    "iteration of ( [ linearized ] ) leads to the formal solution : @xmath77 we have defined @xmath78 , and @xmath79 .",
    "an upper bound on ( [ solution ] ) can be obtained : @xmath80 the first term in the r.h.s . is what would be obtained for identical dynamical systems . we know",
    "that @xmath81 as @xmath82 , where @xmath8 is the largest lyapunov exponent associated to ( [ second ] ) .",
    "we are interested in the situation in which @xmath83 , for which this term vanishes at long times .",
    "further analysis is done first for the case in which @xmath84 is a bounded function ( or @xmath23 is a bounded trajectory with @xmath76 continuous ) . in this situation",
    ", there is a real number @xmath85 such that @xmath86 .",
    "we then get : @xmath87 an unequality valid for large @xmath88 .",
    "let us now define @xmath89 , the maximum slope of the function @xmath90 .",
    "a trivial bound is now obtained as : @xmath91 this can be further improved in the case @xmath92 , where we can write : @xmath93 as a consequence , differences in the trajectories remain bounded at all iteration steps @xmath88 . since , according to the definition ( [ lyapunov2 ] ) , @xmath94 is also an upper bound for the lyapunov exponent for all values of @xmath12 and , in particular , for the noiseless map , @xmath63 , this simply tells us that if the deterministic map is non ",
    "chaotic , then the addition of a common noise to two imperfect but close replicas of the map will still keep the trajectory difference within well defined bounds .",
    "the situation of interest here , however , concerns the case in which a negative lyapunov exponent arises only as the influence of a sufficiently large noise term , i.e. the deterministic map is chaotic and @xmath95 . in this case , the sum in eq .",
    "( [ bound3 ] ) contains products of slopes which are larger or smaller than @xmath96 .",
    "it is still true that the terms in the sum for large value of @xmath97 can be approximated by @xmath98 and , considering this relation to be valid for all values of @xmath99 , we would get : @xmath100 and , thus , at large @xmath88 : @xmath101 it can happen , however , that the product defining @xmath102 contains a large sequence of large slopes @xmath103 . these terms ( statistically rare ) will make the values of @xmath104 to violate the above bound at sporadic times .",
    "analysis of the statistics of deviations from synchronization was carried out in @xcite .",
    "although for @xmath83 the most probable deviation is close to zero , power - law distributions with long tails are found , and indeed its characteristics are determined by the distribution of slopes encountered by the system during finite amounts of time , or finite - time lyapunov exponents , as the arguments above suggest .",
    "therefore , we expect a dynamics dominated by relatively large periods of time during which the difference between trajectories remains bounded by a small quantity , but intermittently interrupted by bursts of large excursions of the difference .",
    "this is indeed observed in the numerical simulations of the maps defined above .",
    "this general picture is still valid even if @xmath105 is not explicitly bounded .",
    "we have performed a more quantitative study for the case in which two noisy lorenz systems with different sets of parameters , namely : @xmath106 + and @xmath107 + are forced by the same noise @xmath108 . in order to discern the effect of each parameter separately ,",
    "we have varied independently each one of the three parameters , @xmath109 , while keeping constant the other two .",
    "the results are plotted in fig .",
    "7 . in this figure",
    "we plot the percentage of time in which the two lorenz systems are still synchronized with a tolerance of 10% .",
    "this means that trajectories are considered synchronized if the relative difference in the @xmath71 variable is less than 10% .",
    "according to the general discussion for maps , we expect departures from approximate synchronization from time to time .",
    "they are in fact observed , but from fig .",
    "7 we conclude that small variations ( of the order of 1% ) still yield a synchronization time of more than 85% . in fig .",
    "8 we show that the loss of synchronization between the two systems appears in the form of bursts of spikes whose amplitude is only limited by the size of the attractor in the phase space . moreover , it can be clearly seen in the same figure that large ( but infrequent ) spike amplitudes appear for arbitrarily small mismatch .    in the realm of synchronization of chaotic oscillators , two different types of analogous intermittent behavior",
    "have been associated also to the fluctuating character of the finite - time conditional lyapunov exponents as above .",
    "one is on - off intermitency @xcite where the synchronization manifold is sligthly unstable on average but the finite time lyapunov exponent is negative during relatively long periods of time . in the other one , named bubbling @xcite ,",
    "the synchronization is stable on average but the local conditional lyapunov exponent becomes occasionally positive .",
    "while in the former case bursting always occurs due to the necessarily imperfect initial synchronization , in the latter it is strictly a consequence of the mismatch of the entraining systems . in this sense , the behavior reported in the preceding paragraph should be considered as a manifestation of bubbling in synchronization by common noise .",
    "in this paper we have addressed the issue of synchronization of chaotic systems by the addition of common random noises .",
    "we have considered three explicit examples : two 1-d maps and the lorenz system under the addition of zero  mean , gaussian , white noise . while the map examples confirm previous results in similar maps , and we have obtained with them analytical confirmation of the phenomenon , the synchronization observed in the lorenz system contradicts some previous results in the literature .",
    "the reason is that previous works considered noise intensities smaller than the ones we found necessary for noise - synchronization in this system . finally , we have analyzed the structural stability of the observed synchronization . in the lorenz system ,",
    "synchronization times larger than 85% ( within an accuracy of 10% ) can still be achieved if the parameters of the system are allowed to change in less than 1% .",
    "it is important to point out that noise - induced synchronization between identical systems subjected to a common noise is equivalent to noise induced order , in the sense that the lyapunov exponent defined in ( 4 ) becomes negative in a single system subjected to noise .",
    "one can ask whether the state with negative lyapunov exponent induced by noise may be still be called ` chaotic ' or not .",
    "this is just a matter of definition : if one defines chaos as exponential sensibility to initial conditions , and one considers this _ for a fixed noise realization _ , then the definition of lyapunov exponent implies that trajectories are not longer chaotic in this sense .",
    "but one can also consider the extended dynamical system containing the forced one _ and _ the noise generator ( for example , in numerical computations , it would be the computer random number generator algorithm ) .",
    "for this _ extended system _ there is strong sensibility to initial conditions in the sense that small differences in noise generator seed leads to exponential divergence of trajectories .",
    "in fact , this divergence is at a rate given by the lyapunov exponent of the noise generator , which approaches infinity for a true gaussian white process .",
    "trajectories in the noise - synchronized state are in fact more irregular than in the absence of noise , and attempts to calculate the lyapunov exponent just from the observation of the time series will lead to a positive and very large value , since it is the _ extended _ dynamical system the one which is observed when analyzing the time series @xcite ( typically such attempts will fail because the high dimensionality of good noise generators , ideally infinity , would put them out of the reach of standard algorithms for lyapunov exponent calculations ) . again , whether or not to call such irregular trajectories with just partial sensibility to initial conditions ` chaotic ' is just a matter of definition .",
    "more detailed discussion along these lines can be found in @xcite .",
    "there remain still many open questions in this field .",
    "they involve the development of a general theory , probably based in the invariant measure , that could give us a general criterion to determine the range of parameters ( including noise levels ) for which the lyapunov exponent becomes negative , thus allowing synchronization . in this work and similar ones ,",
    "the word synchronization is used in a very restricted sense , namely : the coincidence of asymptotic trajectories .",
    "this contrasts with the case of interacting periodic oscillations where a more general theory of synchronization exists to explain the phenomenon of non trivial phase locking between oscillators that individually display very different dynamics .",
    "indications of the existence of analogue non trivial phase locking have been reported for chaotic attractors@xcite .",
    "there a  phase \" with a chaotic trajectory defined in terms of a hilbert transform is shown to be synchronizable by external perturbations in a similar way as it happens with periodic oscillators . whether or not this kind of generalized synchronization can be induced by noise is , however , a completely open question .",
    "last , but not least , it would be also interesting to explore whether analogs of the recently reported synchronization of spatio - temporal chaos@xcite may be induced by noise .",

    "<S> we study the effect that the injection of a common source of noise has on the trajectories of chaotic systems , addressing some contradictory results present in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> we present particular examples of 1-d maps and the lorenz system , both in the chaotic region , and give numerical evidence showing that the addition of a common noise to different trajectories , which start from different initial conditions , leads eventually to their perfect synchronization . </S>",
    "<S> when synchronization occurs , the largest lyapunov exponent becomes negative . for a simple map we are able to show this phenomenon analytically . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we analyze the structural stability of the phenomenon .    </S>",
    "<S> * the synchronization of chaotic systems has been the subject of intensive research in the last years . besides its fundamental interest </S>",
    "<S> , the study of the synchronization of chaotic oscillators has a potential application in the field of chaos communications . </S>",
    "<S> the main idea resides in the hiding of a message within a chaotic carrier generated by a suitable emitter . </S>",
    "<S> the encoded message can be extracted if an appropriate receiver , one which synchronizes to the emitter , is used . </S>",
    "<S> one of the conditions to be fulfilled in order to achieve synchronization is that the receiver and the emitter have very similar device parameters , hence making it very difficult to intercept the encoded message . </S>",
    "<S> although the usual way of synchronizing two chaotic systems is by injecting part of the emitted signal into the receiver , the possibility of synchronization using a common random forcing has been also suggested . </S>",
    "<S> however , there have been some contradictory results in the literature on whether chaotic systems can indeed be synchronized using such a common source of noise and the issue has began to be clarified only very recently . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we give explicit examples of chaotic systems that become synchronized by the addition of gaussian white noise of zero mean . </S>",
    "<S> we also analyze the structural stability of the phenomenon , namely , the robustness of the synchronization against a small mismatch in the parameters of the chaotic sender and receiver . * </S>"
