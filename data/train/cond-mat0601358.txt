    "nonlinear stochastic equations subjected to additive and/or multiplicative noises have been widely adopted for a study on real systems in physics , biology , chemistry , economy and networks .",
    "interesting phenomena caused by both the noises have been intensively investigated ( for a recent review , see ref . 1 , related references therein ) .",
    "it has been realized that the property of multiplicative noises is different from that of additive noises in some respects as follows .",

    "3 ) although the probability distribution in stochastic systems subjected to additive gaussian noise follows the gaussian , it is not the case for multiplicative gaussian noises which generally yield non - gaussian distribution @xcite-@xcite .",
    "( 4 ) the scaling relation of the effective strength for additive noise given by @xmath1 is not applicable to that for multiplicative noise : @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 denote effective strengths of multiplicative and additive noises , respectively , in the @xmath0-unit system @xcite .    in order to show the above item ( 4 ) ,",
    "the present author has adopted the augmented moment method ( amm ) in a recent paper @xcite .",
    "the amm was originally developed by expanding variables around their mean values in order to obtain the second - order moments both for local and global variables in stochastic systems @xcite .",
    "the amm has been successfully applied to a study on dynamics of coupled stochastic systems described by langevin , fitzhugh - nagumo and hodgkin - huxley models subjected only to additive noises with global , local or small - world couplings ( with and without transmission delays ) @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have reformulated the amm with the use of the fokker - planck equation ( fpe ) , in order to avoid the difficulty due to the ito versus stratonovich calculus inherent for multiplicative noise .",
    "it has been pointed our that a naive approximation of the scaling relation for multiplicative noise : @xmath5 , as adopted by mu@xmath6 oz , colaiori and castellano in their recent paper @xcite , leads to the result which violates the central - limit theorem and which is in disagreement with those of amm and direct simulations .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is two folds : ( 1 ) to reformulate amm forfitzhugh - nagumo ( fn ) model    subjected to both additive and multiplicative noises with the use of fpe @xcite , and ( 2 ) to discuss the respective roles of the two noises on the synchronization .",
