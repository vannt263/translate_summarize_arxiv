    "a combined configuration - interaction ( ci ) many - body - perturbation - theory ( mbpt ) method , applied previously to divalent atoms  @xcite , is extended to particle - hole states of closed - shell atoms .",
    "after derivation of ci+mbpt expressions for particle - hole states , we will apply the theory to calculations of energies and electric - dipole transition probabilities for neon .    for neon , many accurate measurements of transition rates are available , providing important tests of theory .",
    "reciprocally , the theory might help resolve existing discrepancies among oscillator strengths ( @xmath3-values ) for transitions from the ground state to several excited states , for which experiments disagree .",
    "there is also a certain deficiency in existing _ ab - initio _ theories in neon , for which discrepancies among many measurements and theoretical calculations are unsettled .",
    "for example , the only other elaborate _ ab - initio _ calculations ( @xcite ) give an oscillator strength for the @xmath4 _ { 1}$ ] neon state larger than most experimental values by more than two standard deviations .",
    "extensive calculations performed by @xcite for many transition rates along the neon isoelectronic sequence use a general configuration - interaction code ( civ3 )  @xcite .",
    "the calculations utilize parametric adjustments with measured fine structures , but do not completely agree with experiments in neon and have an accuracy similar to other semiempirical calculations of  @xcite .",
    "however , the two calculations disagree with each other for several transitions .",
    "we hope that our calculations may help to understand better the theoretical problems in neon and provide guidance for the analysis of experimental data .",
    "some possible applications of the present ci+mbpt method include the study of neonlike ions , ne i ",
    "si v , s vii , ar ix , ca xi , and fe xvii that have astrophysical interest and have been included in the opacity project ( @xcite ) .",
    "the transition data in neon and other noble gases are also used in plasma physics , and in studying discharges that find many industrial applications in lamps and gas lasers .",
    "the methods presented here might be also used for improving the accuracy of mbpt or for extending ci+mbpt to more complicated open - shell atoms .",
    "the principal theoretical difficulty arises from the sensitivity of transition amplitudes to the interaction between closely spaced fine - structure components .",
    "although it is possible to obtain energies which are reasonably precise on an absolute scale using coupled - cluster methods ( @xcite ) , accurate fine - structure splittings seem very difficult to obtain without semiempirical adjustments .",
    "this is why semiempirical approaches , which have fine - structure intervals carefully adjusted , are more successful in neon than are _ ab - initio _ calculations .",
    "however , as we will demonstrate in this paper , ci calculations corrected with mbpt are also capable of accurately predicting fine - structure splittings and , consequently , transition amplitudes . in this paper",
    ", we will demonstrate the excellent precision of ci plus second - order mbpt .",
    "third - order corrections , for which numerical codes already exist  @xcite , can also be included , providing even further improvement in accuracy .    in the following section",
    ", we use the effective hamiltonian formalism and particle - hole single - double coupled equations to derive expressions for the second - order hamiltonian matrix of the ci+mbpt method . in the final expressions , we present a quite accurate new mbpt that can predict energies of hole states and can describe appropriately the interactions in particle - hole atoms . the accuracy of hole energies obtained with the new mbpt will be illustrated for neon and low-@xmath2 neon - like ions .",
    "our ci+mbpt energies and @xmath3-values for many states of neon are tabulated .",
    "their agreement with experiment and other theories are shown .",
    "the accuracy of the rayleigh - schrdinger variant of second - order mbpt given in @xcite is insufficient for purpose , so that more accurate single - double equations must be used .",
    "the formulas for the correlation operator and a system of coupled equations for the correlation coefficients are given in @xcite ; we follow the notation of @xcite in the the paragraphs below . under certain conditions ,",
    "those equations can be further simplified and rewritten in the following form : @xmath5 in the second equation of this set , the term @xmath6 is subtracted from both sides of this equation to make the right - hand side small . since large random - phase approximation ( rpa )",
    "corrections in the particle - hole ci+mbpt are treated by ci , the quantities @xmath7 entering this set of equations on the right - hand side in ref .",
    "@xcite are small and have been neglected here .",
    "the concern might be raised for the correlation coefficients @xmath8 and @xmath9 , which generally would have small factors @xmath10 or @xmath11 in front . however , for the large ci model space , energies of the core - virtual orbitals @xmath12 are well separated from the energies of the valence - hole orbitals @xmath13 .",
    "the quantities @xmath14 in zero approximation can be set to : @xmath15 to obtain the first - order effective hamiltonian , @xmath16 and the correlation coefficients @xmath17 .",
    "here we define the first - order correction @xmath18 to the effective hamiltonian . for faster convergence of ci and for subtraction of the dominant monopole contributions in rpa diagrams , a @xmath19 hartree - fock ( hf ) model potential for which @xmath20 , @xmath21 is introduced .",
    "further improvement of accuracy can be achieved through iterations .",
    "after one iteration we obtain the second - order contribution to the effective hamiltonian , @xmath22 where @xmath23 note that in the last equation we have extended the single - double method .",
    "the last term entering @xmath24 in the single - double formalism would normally not contain @xmath25 in the denominator .",
    "however , if we do not modify this denominator , we find that in the third - order mbpt , large terms proportional to @xmath25 will appear leading to a decrease in accuracy .",
    "a physical reason for modifying the denominator of this term is that the process described by this term contains two holes in the intermediate states with large interaction energy .",
    "this interaction should be treated nonperturbatively , for example , by inclusion of @xmath25 into the denominator as we have done on the basis of the single - double equations in other terms . finally , this term is almost equal to the seventh term ( they are complex conjugates and their goldstone diagrams are related by a reflection through a horizontal axis ) , and for convenience they are set equal in numerical calculations .",
    "the angular reduction for @xmath24 can be easily obtained using the second - order particle - hole formulas given in ref .",
    "apart from coulomb correlation corrections , the breit magnetic interaction is also important in neon and the isoelectronic ions .",
    "the breakdown of various coulomb and relativistic contributions to the energy of @xmath26 states of neon are given in ref .",
    "breit corrections cancel , but for higher excited states they may not . hence , to improve the accuracy of fine - structure splittings , we include the hartree - fock hole breit correction @xmath27 in our calculations , @xmath28 we have checked that the first - order corrections @xmath29 to the energies of @xmath30 and @xmath0 states given in table i of ref .",
    "@xcite agree with our @xmath31 contributions , 0.00062 and 0.00090 a.u .",
    ", for @xmath32 and @xmath33 states , respectively .",
    "we omit the small frequency - dependent breit , quantum - electrodynamic , reduced - mass , and mass - polarization corrections .",
    "small as they are , those corrections are further reduced after subtraction for the fine - structure intervals .",
    "more careful treatment of relativistic corrections is needed in calculations of high-@xmath2 neon - like ions .",
    "since we propose a new variant of the mbpt expansion , we would like first to demonstrate that this expansion is convergent for hole states .",
    "the theoretical hole energies shown in table  [ table : hole ] have been obtained in the @xmath34 hf potential using eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) for @xmath35 to calculate second - order corrections .",
    "the extra term in the denominator is important and is necessary for convergence of the perturbation expansion .",
    "experimental hole energies in the national institute of standards and technology ( nist ) database ref .",
    "@xcite are found as the limit energies for the neon isoelectronic sequence .",
    "for neutral neon only one limit , the p@xmath36 energy is given in nist  @xcite .",
    "the 2p@xmath37 - 2p@xmath36 splitting 780.4269(36 ) @xmath38 has been measured in ref .",
    "@xcite , and using this value we find the experimental p@xmath37 energy .",
    "table  [ table : hole ] demonstrates the good agreement of our theoretical p@xmath36 , p@xmath37 energies as well as the same fine structure interval for neon - like ions . our fine structure interval , whose correctness is crucial for transition amplitude calculations , differs from experiment just by about 10 @xmath38 .",
    "note that the hf value 187175 @xmath39 for the 2p@xmath36 state is 8.5% higher than the experimental value 173930 @xmath38 , and , after adding correlation corrections , we obtain improvement by a factor of ten . for the fine structure ,",
    "the hf value 1001@xmath39 disagrees even more , by 28% . if we use rayleigh - schrdinger perturbation theory , the corrections are twice as large as our results , and the agreement with experiment does not improve .",
    ".a comparison of theoretical and experimental hole energies and the 2p@xmath36 - 2p@xmath37 fine - structure intervals for neon and neon - like ions .",
    "all energies are in @xmath38 [ cols=\"<,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     many experiments have disagreements in oscillator strengths far exceeding the cited errors ( see fig .  [ neonexp ] and",
    "table  [ graphtable ] ) : hence , for comparison , we give in table  [ tab : neontr ] two statistical averages : the first is a weighted according to cited standard deviations and the second is an unweighted average . for the 3s levels , the experimental data compiled in ref .",
    "@xcite and for the higher excited levels in ref .",
    "@xcite have been included in the averaging .",
    "average values obtained here are not necessarily the most accurate , but they serve well for comparison and for a test of our probably less accurate calculated values .    a more careful analysis of experimental techniques to exclude systematic errors , which are definitely present , is necessary ; our values can provide some guidance . for @xmath40 states , since the energy separation of the two states is small , experiments give the sum of the two oscillator strengths , and the value 0.0196 rather than 0.0130 should be compared with the experimental values 0.0187 ( 0.0199 ) . in this table , we also compare our theory with other semiempirical theories .",
    "surprisingly , early calculations by  @xcite agree well with our calculations . a fair agreement , considering the high sensitivity of these transitions to correlation correction ,",
    "is also obtained with the other theories in the table .",
    "in this paper , we have introduced ci+mbpt theory for particle - hole states of closed - shell atoms .",
    "a difficulty that the hole energy has poor convergence is overcome with modifications of denominators in mbpt .",
    "good precision for hole states and for particle - hole states is illustrated for many energy levels of neon .",
    "apart from energies , our theory is tested in calculations of oscillator strengths .",
    "agreement with averaged experimental values is achieved ."
