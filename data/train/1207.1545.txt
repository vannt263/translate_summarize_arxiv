    "<S> data from the atlas and cms collaborations  @xcite provide an essentially @xmath4 signal for a higgs - like resonance with mass of order @xmath2 . in the @xmath3 final state , the atlas and cms rates are roughly @xmath5 and @xmath6 times the standard model ( sm ) prediction . in the @xmath7 channel , </S>",

    "<S> enhanced rates in the @xmath3 channel have been shown to be difficult to achieve in the nmssm @xcite , while remaining consistent with all relevant constraints , including those from lep searches , @xmath18-physics , the muon anomalous magnetic moment , @xmath19 , and the relic density of dark matter , @xmath20 , when parameters are semi - unified at the gut scale . by `` semi - unified '' </S>",
    "<S> we mean a model in which @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 are universal at the gut scale with nuhm relaxation for @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 and general @xmath27 and @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> enhancements appear to be possible only if large values of the superpotential coupling @xmath29 are employed and the @xmath30 constraint is greatly relaxed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( see @xcite for the first discussion of an enhanced @xmath3 rate at large @xmath29 in the nmssm with parameters defined at the weak scale . ) in this letter , we pursue the case of generally large @xmath29 and uncover a particularly interesting set of scenarios in which the two lightest cp - even higgs bosons , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , both lie in the @xmath2 mass window . </S>",
    "<S> phenomenological consequences are examined .    for the numerical analysis , </S>",
    "<S> we use nmssmtools  @xcite@xcite@xcite version 3.2.0 , which has improved convergence of rges in the case of large yukawa couplings and thus allows us to explore parameter regions that where left uncharted in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the precise constraints imposed are the following . </S>",
    "<S> our ` basic constraints ' will be to require that an nmssm parameter choice be such as to give a proper rge solution , have no landau pole , have a neutralino as the lightest susy particle ( lsp ) and obey higgs and susy mass limits as implemented in nmssmtools-3.2.0 ( higgs mass limits are from lep , older tevatron , and early lhc data ; susy mass limits are essentially from lep . )    regarding @xmath18 physics , the constraints considered are those on @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 at @xmath37 as encoded in nmssmtools-3.2.0 , except that we updated the bounds on rare @xmath18 decays to @xmath38 and @xmath39 ; theoretical uncertainties in @xmath18-physics observables are taken into account as implemented in nmssmtools-3.2.0 . </S>",
    "<S> regarding dark matter constraints , we accept all points that have @xmath40 , thus allowing for scenarios in which the relic density arises at least in part from some other source . </S>",
    "<S> however , we single out points with @xmath41 , which is the ` wmap window ' defined in nmssmtools-3.2.0 after including theoretical and experimental systematic uncertainties . in addition , we impose bounds on the spin - independent lsp  </S>",
    "<S> proton scattering cross section implied by the neutralino - mass - dependent xenon100 bound  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( for points with @xmath42 , we rescale these bounds by a factor of @xmath43 . )    </S>",
    "<S> our study focuses in particular on nmssm parameter choices such that both @xmath44 and @xmath45 lie within @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we focus moreover on @xmath46 , a range for which it is known  @xcite@xcite that some enhancement , relative to the sm , of the higgs signal in the @xmath3 final state is possible . </S>",
    "<S> the degenerate situation is especially interesting in that an enhanced @xmath3 rate at @xmath14 could arise as a result of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 rates summing together , even if the individual rates are not full sm - like strength ( or enhanced ) .    </S>",
    "<S> above , we did not mention imposing a constraint on @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> rough consistency with the measured value of @xmath30 requires that the extra nmssm contribution , @xmath47 , falls into the window defined in nmssmtools of @xmath48 expanded to @xmath49 after allowing for a @xmath13 theoretical error in the nmssm calculation of @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , given the previously defined constraints and focusing on @xmath46 , @xmath51 is always too small , being at most @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> demanding @xmath51 large enough to fall into the above window , or even come close to doing so , appears from our scans to date to only be possible if @xmath53 @xcite , for which the higgs signal in the @xmath3 and @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) final states for higgs in the @xmath2 window is very sm - like .    </S>",
    "<S> the main production / decay channels relevant for current lhc data are gluon - gluon and @xmath56 fusion to higgs with higgs decay to @xmath3 or @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> the lhc is also beginning to probe @xmath58higgs with higgs decay to @xmath10 , a channel for which tevatron data is relevant , and @xmath59higgs with higgs@xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> for the cases studied , where there are two nearly degenerate higgs bosons , we will combine their signals as follows in defining the mass and signal for the effective higgs , @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> first , for the individual higgs we compute the ratio of the @xmath62 or @xmath56-fusion ( vbf ) induced higgs cross section times the higgs branching ratio to a given final state , @xmath63 , relative to the corresponding value for the sm higgs boson : @xmath64 r^{h_i}_{\\rm vbf}(x)&\\equiv & { \\gamma(ww\\to h_i ) \\ \\br(h_i\\to </S>",
    "<S> x)\\over \\gamma(ww\\to \\hsm)\\ \\br(\\hsm\\to x)},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 is the @xmath66 nmssm scalar higgs , and @xmath67 is the sm higgs boson . </S>",
    "<S> note that the corresponding ratio for @xmath68 ( @xmath55 ) with @xmath69 is equal to @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> these ratios are computed in a self - consistent manner ( that is , treating radiative corrections for the sm higgs boson in the same manner as for the nmssm higgs bosons ) using an appropriate additional routine for the sm higgs added to the nmhdecay component of the nmssmtools package . </S>",
    "<S> next , we compute the effective higgs mass in given production and final decay channels @xmath71 and @xmath63 , respectively , as m_h^y(x ) and define the net signal to simply be r^h_y(x)=r^_y(x)+ r^_y(x ) . </S>",
    "<S> of course , the extent to which it is appropriate to combine the rates from the @xmath0 and @xmath1 depends upon the degree of degeneracy and the experimental resolution . for the latter , we assume @xmath72  @xcite . quoted in this paper range from @xmath73@xmath74 to @xmath75@xmath76 , the better resolutions being for the case where both photons are in the barrel and the worse resolutions for when one or both photons are in the endcap . </S>",
    "<S> we anticipate that the more recent analyses have achieved substantially better mass resolutions , but details are not yet available . ] </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that the widths of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 are of the same order of magnitude as the width of a 125 gev sm higgs boson ,  they are very much smaller than this resolution .    </S>",
    "<S> we perform scans covering the following parameter ranges , which correspond to an expanded version of those considered in @xcite : @xmath77 ; @xmath78 ; @xmath79 ; @xmath80 ; @xmath81 ; @xmath82 ; @xmath83 ; @xmath84 ; @xmath85 . in the figures shown in the following , we only display points which pass the basic constraints , satisfy @xmath18-physics constraints , have @xmath86 , obey the xenon100 limit on the lsp scattering cross - section off protons _ and _ have _ both _ @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the desired mass range : @xmath87 .    in fig .  </S>",
