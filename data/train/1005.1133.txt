    "a class of transition metal oxides with a chemical composition @xmath15o@xmath16 crystalizes into so - called cubic pyrochlore structure ( @xmath17 ) , and it can be regarded as two interpenetrating networks of corner - shared tetrahedra consisting of @xmath0o and @xmath18o@xmath19 sublattices.@xcite because of high crystal symmetry , presence of antiferromagnetic correlation or charge disproportion between the metal ions on the pyrochlore lattice induces a geometrical flustration and associated macroscopic degrees of degeneracy for the spin / charge states in their ionic limit .",

    "it is naturally expected that geometrical frustration ( or correlation ) would also lead to nontrivial effects on itinerant electrons , because they can be a local entity in a certain time scale ( @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the relevant energy band width ) .",
    "the unusual behavior of ordinary and anomalous hall coefficients in the mo pyrochlores with @xmath25=nd , sm and gd might be a manifestation of such effect.@xcite above all , however , the  heavy fermion \" behavior in a metallic vanadium spinel liv@xmath21o@xmath26 ( in which the v ions form a pyrochlore sublattice ) is one of the most interesting phenomena among conducting pyrochlores / spinels.@xcite    in the previous studies on liv@xmath1o@xmath27 , we demonstrated by muon spin rotation / relaxation ( @xmath7sr ) and muon knight shift measurements that , unlike what is anticipated in the conventional heavy fermion metals , local vanadium moments in liv@xmath1o@xmath27  are not quenched by the kondo mechanism , and that they give rise to a highly inhomogeneous and dynamically fluctuating magnetic ground state that seems to be in close association with the geometrical frustration.@xcite it would be interesting to note that a strikingly similar situation was reported to occur in an intermetallic laves phase ( c15-type ) compound , y@xmath28sc@xmath29mn@xmath1 , where it is inferred from earlier @xmath7sr  study that inhomogeneous local magnetism persists at low temperatures in a sample that exhibits a heavy fermion behavior induced by suppression of structural phase transition upon substitution of y by sc.@xcite thus , these results demonstrate a pressing need to develop a new concept of quasipartcle state that should represent the anomalous conducting state of electrons under geometrical ( three - body ) correlation .    from the experimental view point , it would be helpful for the understanding of anomalous metallic properties to establish the generic character of such electronic states by extending @xmath7sr  study to other electrically conducting pyrochlores / spinels . to this end ,",
    "spinels and pyrochlores are good candidates for materials survey , although they exhibit a common tendency of structural phase transition at lower temperatures that lifts the orbital degeneracy and relieve the frustration .    here",
    ", we focus on a family of ruthenium and osmium pyrochlores , @xmath30o@xmath2 ( @xmath31=ru , os ) with nominally divalent cations ( i.e. , @xmath32o@xmath2 ) . as shown in fig .",

    "this means that there is no orbital degeneracy that would lead to the instability against the jahn - teller distortion and associated structural phase transition to reduce the crystal symmetry , and therefore one may be able to observe the effect of geometrical frustration at lower temperatures .",
    "moreover , considering that the suppression of structural transition is favorable for preventing the system from mi transition , they would provide a stage for studying the effect of geometrical correlation on itinerant electrons .",
    "interestingly , the actual ground state of these pyrochlores suggested from bulk electronic properties turns out to be considerably dependent on the choice of @xmath8 site ions .",
    "as summarized in table [ pyrolist ] , some exhibit metal - insulator ( mi ) transition that does not necessarily accompany structural phase transition .",
    "we have shown by recent @xmath7sr  study that an osmium pyrochlore , cd@xmath1os@xmath1o@xmath2 , which remains in a cubic structure and falls into semi - insulating state below 225 k , exhibits a peculiar magnetic ground state probably related with geometrical frustration.@xcite a similar but more inhomogeneous electronic state is suggested by a preliminary @xmath7sr  study for the case of hg@xmath1os@xmath1o@xmath2  which remains metallic down to 4 k ( ref . ) .",
