    "the vsop ( vlbi space observatory program ) is the first space vlbi ( svlbi ) mission that has been running in a facility mode .",
    "vsop observations have utilized a worldwide array of radio telescopes and an orbiting 8-meter antenna deployed on the japanese satellite halca ( @xcite ) .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the ground - space baselines provided by halca contain a unique information about source structure , and that this information can not be obtained by super - resolution applied to ground vlbi images @xcite .",
    "regular vsop observations started in september 1997 at 1.6 and 5ghz , quickly turning it to an excellent tool to study the morphology extragalactic flows _ en mass _",
    "( @xcite , and references therein ) and on a case by case basis ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "vsop observations at 1.6ghz match closely the resolution of the vlba array at 5ghz ( @xcite , and references therein ) . this can be used effectively for studying the distribution of spectral index in extragalactic jets @xcite .",
    "the quasar 0836@xmath1710",
    "( 4c71.07 , z@xmath42.17 ) was observed with the vsop in 1997 , on october 3 ( at 1.6ghz ) and october 7 ( at 5ghz ) .",
    "the observation at 5ghz was presented in @xcite .",
    "0836@xmath1710 is an ultra - luminous quasar showing correlated ( otterbein et al .",
    "1998 ) broad - band variability in gamma - ray ( @xcite ) , x - ray ( @xcite ) , optical ( @xcite ) , mm- and cm- radio regimes @xcite .",
    "the source has a well collimated vlbi - scale jet @xcite extending out to @xmath5240 milliarcseconds @xcite .",
    "the jet shows typical proper motions of 0.20.3mas / yr @xcite and it is substantially curved , with lateral displacements of its ridge line and oscillations of its transverse width ( possibly correlated with the observed jet speeds ; @xcite ) .",
    "we present here a 1.1-mas resolution vsop image of 0836@xmath1710 made at 1.6ghz , and discuss the morphological and spectral properties of the compact jet in this quasar . for the purpose of facilitating comparisons with previous measurements , the big bang cosmology with the hubble constant @xmath6kms@xmath7mpc@xmath7 and deceleration parameter @xmath8 is adopted throughout the paper . for 0836@xmath1710 ,",
    "this translates into a linear scale of 4.0pc / mas and corresponds to apparent speed of 41.6@xmath9 for an observed proper motion of 1mas / yr .",
    "0836@xmath1710 was observed with the vsop at 1.6ghz for 11.5 hours with the vlba providing ground support for the observation .",
    "the data were recorded in the vlba format , using total observing bandwidth of 32mhz divided in two intermediate frequency ( if ) bands , each having 256 spectral channels .",
    "the data were correlated at the vlba correlator in socorro , with output pre - averaging time of 1.966 and 0.524 seconds for the ground and space baselines respectively .",
    "data from halca were received for the total of 5 hours at the satellite data acquisition stations in tidbinbilla ( australia ) , robledo ( spain ) , and green bank ( usa ) .",
    "fringe visibilities were detected in the halca data recorded at all three sts .",
    "the rms noise on the halca baselines is about 4.5 times higher than on the ground baselines .",
    "the _ uv_-coverage of the final correlated dataset is shown in fig .",
    "[ lobanov - fig1 ] .",
    "the minimum _",
    "uv_-spacing of the data is 0.77m@xmath10 , corresponding to an angular scale of 260mas .",
    "the maximum _",
    "uv_-spacings of the ground and space baselines are 47m@xmath10 and 180m@xmath10 , respectively .",
    "these values indicate that the vsop data provide an improvement of resolution by a factor of @xmath53.5 compared to ground vlbi observations at the same frequency .",
    "the estimated thermal rms noise of the vsop data is 0.75mjy / beam , corresponding to a brightness temperature of @xmath11k .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)lobanov - fig1.eps      the correlated data were fringe - fit and imaged using aips and difmap ( @xcite ) .",
    "antenna gain and system temperature measurements were applied to calibrate the visibility amplitudes . after inspecting the if bandpasses , the last 46 channels were flagged in each if , owing to significant ( 50 - 80% ) amplitude reduction .",
    "this has reduced the total observing bandwidth to 26.2 mhz .",
    "the recorded phase - calibration signals from the observing log were applied to the vlba antennas .",
    "the residual delays and rates were corrected using the single - band ( sb ) and multi - band ( mb ) delay fringe fitting .",
    "we used solution intervals of 3 minutes ( sb ) and 5 ( mb ) minutes , and accepted all solutions with @xmath12 .",
    "after the fringe fitting , the residual phase variations were found to be within 2@xmath13 on the ground baselines , and @xmath14 on the space baselines .",
    "we then averaged over all frequency channels , and calibrated the phases with a point source model ( to enable time averaging ) .",
    "( 160mm,130mm)lobanov - fig2.eps    after fringe fitting , the data were exported into difmap and further time - averaged into 60-second bins ( with the resulting spatial dynamic range of @xmath15 and the largest detectable scale of @xmath16mas ) .",
    "the amplitude and phase errors were calculated from the scatter in the un - averaged data .",
    "the hybrid imaging using the clean algorithm was applied to produce final , self - calibrated images .",

    "the location of the slice is indicated in the spectral index map and in the 5ghz image .",
    "the dots mark the positions of the local peaks in the run of the spectral index .",
    "the peaks seemingly underline the edges of the enhanced emission regions .",
    "this can be viewed as evidence for forward and reverse shocks dissipating in the jet after injection of dense plasma condensations at the nucleus ( cf .",
    ", @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the likely associations with the enhanced brightness regions are marked with j1j5 in fig .",
    "[ lobanov - fig4 ] .",
    "another possible explanation involves elliptical modes of kelvin - helmholtz ( k - h ) instability developing in the flow @xcite .",
    "it is remarkable that the peaks in the spectral index run are separated by similar intervals , with an average separation of @xmath24mas .",
    "this regularity suggests that k - h instability can also play a role in forming the observed structure .",
    "it is also possible that the observed morphology and spectral properties result from an interplay between relativistic shocks and instabilities @xcite .",
    "better indications about the nature of the extended emission should come from imaging the turnover frequency distribution @xcite , which is sensitive to velocity and pressure gradients in the plasma .",
    "the reported observation of 0836@xmath1710 shows that the vsop mission provides an excellent opportunity for high - resolution and high dynamic range imaging of vlbi - scale jets in extragalactic objects .",
    "the vsop image of 0836@xmath1710 allows to investigate the jet morphology and physical conditions on projected linear scales up to 1kpc .",
    "the jet is substantially curved on scales from @xmath25mas to @xmath26mas , underlining the likely complexity and possible stratification of the flow .",
    "this is also reflected in remarkable changes of the apparent speeds measured at different locations along the jet .",
    "near the core , apparent speeds @xmath27 are measured . at a 3@xmath28mas core separation , the speed decreases down to @xmath29-@xmath30 , and then becomes larger once again , further out @xcite .    this kinematic behavior and the pronounced curvature of the jet",
    "are indicative of kelvin - helmholtz ( k - h ) instability developing in the flow @xcite . previous analysis of the jet ridge line measured in the vsop image at 5ghz ( rightmost image in fig .  [ lobanov - fig3 ] ) has indicated that , on scales of @xmath31mas the jet is dominated by a helical surface ( h@xmath32 ) mode of k - h instability @xcite in a relativistic flow with a lorentz factor @xmath33 , mach number @xmath34 , and a jet / ambient medium density ratio of @xmath35 @xcite . with the parameters derived in @xcite ,",
    "the h@xmath32 mode has a wavelength of @xmath36mas , similar to the oscillations observed in the ridge line at 5ghz .",
    "the corresponding wavelength of the elliptical surface mode ( e@xmath32 ) is @xmath37mas , which is close to the observed average separation of @xmath38mas between the peaks in the spectral index run ( bottom left panel of fig .",
    "[ lobanov - fig4 ] ) .",
    "the instability should have a relatively fast propagation speed @xmath39 . to maintain the remarkable stability of the flow , the opening angle , @xmath40 , of the jet should not exceed the limit of @xmath41 , which translates into @xmath42 .    the vlba image at 1.6ghz ( left panel of fig .",
    "[ lobanov - fig2 ] ) gives an hint of a structural changes at a much longer wavelength , possibly as large as @xmath26mas .",
    "it is impossible to reproduce this wavelength in a flow discussed above , as it would require the jet to have an opening angle far in excess of the @xmath43 limit derived above .",
    "this implies that either this wavelength is either produced in a flow with substantially different properties ( for instance , it could be generated in outer layers of a stratified flow ) or it is not related to k - h instability at all ( it could be due to precession or other purely kinematic factors ) .",
    "this is subject to a more detailed analysis of the morphology and kinematics of the jet . at this point",
    ", it could only be noted that such a wavelength could correspond to a helical surface mode of k - h instability developing in outer layers of the jet , with a transverse width about 10 times larger than the width of the flow giving rise to the shorter wavelengths detected in the vsop image at 5ghz .",
    "finally , the preliminary measurement of the core shift between 1.6ghz and 5ghz allow us to place limits on the parameters of the inner jet , following the method described in @xcite .",
    "the magnetic field strength in the self - absorbed core should be 2 mg and 18 mg at 1.6ghz and 5ghz , respectively ( assuming the spectral index of @xmath44 for synchrotron emission ) .",
    "the 1.6ghz core should be located at about 85pc ( @xmath45mas , assuming a viewing angle of 3@xmath13 ) from the central engine of the agn .",
    "the total luminosity of the jet reaches up to @xmath46erg / s , with about 10% of that coming from the synchrotron emission .",
    "this makes 0836@xmath1710 one of the most powerful extragalactic jets certainly worth of more detailed studies .",
    "we gratefully acknowledge the vsop project , which is led by the japanese institute of space and astronautical science in cooperation with many organizations and radio telescopes around the world .",
