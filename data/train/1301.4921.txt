    "the last years a lot of experimental and theoretical efforts have been made to investigate the physics behind of the ultra relativistic heavy - ion collisions ( urhic s ) .",
    "today the efforts towards the deconfinement phase of the hadrons and the research for the chiral symmetry restoration phase have become more systematic . in this research , tools like ,",
    "light vector mesons production , search for strangeness and di - leptonic production are in the front line of the battle .",
    "each tool has its own advantages and disadvantages but one is for sure , that all this years a great progress in understanding the physics behind have been made . in the following two sections we summarize the work depend on hadron structure of photon and the vector dominance model ( vdm ) and also the electromagnetic form factors .",
    "very important and useful tools to the understanding of the nature of the quark gluon plasma formation at the ultra relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the vector mesons @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 play an important role in the description of hadronic interactions in a non - pertrurbative region . in this region",
    "effective hadron models use composite hadrons and mesons as field carriers instead of quarks and gluons . in these models",
    ", vector mesons are introduced together with photons as a gauge bosons of an implicit gauge symmetry in a close analogy to spontaneously broken @xmath3 symmetry of the electro - weak interactions .",
    "the fundamental role of the vector mesons was pointed out first by sakurai in the vector dominance model ( vdm)@xcite who introduced the hadron - vector meson interactions by analogy with the photon - electron interactions in quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) . according to this model , the coupling of the hadrons to vector mesons",
    "is described by an universal coupling constant which conserved in all hadronic interactions .",
    "also the same coupling constant and the vector meson mass describes the vector meson conversion into a photon .",
    "in field theory , the particle interactions are described via lagrangians of interacting current fields .",
    "for example , in the qed lagrangian the quark - photon electromagnetic interaction is described by a product of the quark electromagnetic current @xmath4 with photon vector field @xmath5 : @xmath6 . the vector meson dominance model ( vdm )",
    "assumes that at low energies where hadrons rather than quarks are appropriate degrees of freedom , the quark electromagnetic current is carried entirely by a vector meson fields . the typical energy range where this hypothesis holds is given by a four - momentum of the exchanged photon of @xmath7 @xmath8 .",
    "this assumption results in so - called field current , valid exactly at the vector meson poles : @xmath9 where @xmath10 are the vector meson fields and @xmath11 is the conversion factor given by the vector meson mass @xmath12 and the universal coupling constant @xmath13 . a connection between the vector fields @xmath10 and the quark electromagnetic current @xmath14 is easily obtained in the framework of the second quantization . in this framework ,",
    "the @xmath14 is a creation operator acting on the qcd vacuum and creating quark - antiquark pairs witch overlap with the mesonic states .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath13 can be obtained from the measured di - electron vector meson decay widths .",
    "for example the matrix element for the @xmath15 decay , the @xmath16 can be calculated within the vdm using the graph in fig.1b and the following factorization : @xmath17 the last matrix element describes the conversion of the virtual @xmath18 with the four - vector @xmath19 into a positron - electron pair and is given by : @xmath20 @xmath21 using eq.([eq:1.3 ] ) and neglecting the electron mass , one gets the di - electron vector meson decay width@xcite : @xmath22 @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the momentum of the daughter electron in the center mass frame . from the measured di - electron experimental decay widths one can therefore obtain the universal coupling constants for the light vector mesons : @xmath25 and as one can see from eq.([eq:1.6 ] ) that the ratios @xmath26 for the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons is proportional to @xmath27 .",
    "they also agree with the ratios of the squared numerical coefficients resulting from the @xmath28 decomposition , namely :     annihilation with @xmath29 emission . according to vdm hypothesis a time - like photon ( @xmath30 ) couples to a pion via an intermediate vector @xmath31 meson state .",
    "b : vertex coupling constants @xmath32 and @xmath33 can be derived from the @xmath34 and @xmath35 decays , respectively.,width=264,height=151 ]    @xmath36    where @xmath37 as value selected .",
    "exception is the @xmath0 meson for which one observes a larger discrepancy .",
    "the deviation on @xmath38 from the ideal @xmath28 value @xmath39 can be explained by a large contribution on the one - pion loop to the @xmath0-self energy at the effective lagrangian approach @xcite .",
    "another part of the vdm hypothesis is the assumption that the same coupling constant @xmath39 describes also the meson - hadron interaction and therefore connects strong and electromagnetic interactions by the vector mesons gauge fields .",
    "the interaction lagrangian can be written by analogy to the electromagnetic interaction introduced above : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the hadronic vector current and @xmath42 is the vector mason field ( here we replaced the @xmath43 index form eq.([eq:1.1 ] ) with @xmath44 ) .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath39 can be interpreted as a conserved hadronic charge of the vector meson and for example should be the same for the @xmath45 and @xmath46 couplings and equal to @xmath47 derived from the @xmath0 meson di - electron decay .",
    "this can be verified by the analysis of the di - pion decay width of the @xmath0 meson .",
    "the @xmath48 decay width can be calculated in a similar way as for di - electron decay using the graph of the fig.1b .",
    "the matrix elements is given by@xcite : @xmath49 and finally we get : @xmath50 where @xmath51{(\\frac{m_{\\rho}}{2})^2-m^{2}_{\\pi}}}\\label{eq:1.12}\\ ] ] using the experimental value from eq.([eq:1.11 ] ) we obtain that @xmath52 which is close to the universal value @xmath53 . should be mentioned here an important aspect of broad resonances such as the @xmath0 meson .",
    "the decay widths in eq.([eq:1.5 ] ) and eq.([eq:1.11 ] ) are valid strictly for the meson poles @xmath54 . for the broad @xmath31 , the respective decay widths are mass dependent and for the di - electron decay as given in@xcite,@xciteis : @xmath55 for the di - pion decay",
    "is : @xmath56 an important consequence of eq.([eq:1.14 ] ) is that in contrary to the di - pion decay the di - electron decay yield increases at low masses .",
    "the dominance of the vector masons in the hadron - photon interaction vertex which discussed at the previous paragraph is conspicuous in the electromagnetic form factors of the hadrons .",
    "let us consider the electron - positron annihilation with a pion production .",
    "the cross section ratio of the positron annihilation with the production of even number of pions , normalized to the cross section for the di - muon production as@xcite : @xmath57 at large @xmath58 the observed @xmath59 values is one of the proofs for the quark - hadron structure . as predicted by the quark parton model and qed , for large four - momentum transfers ( @xmath60 @xmath61 ) the @xmath59 value is proportional to the product of the electromagnetic current , carried by electrons and quarks according to : @xmath62 the result of the leading order qcd calculation , shows that @xmath59 is equal to the sum of squared light quarks charges @xmath63 multiplied by the number of colors @xmath64 , ( @xmath65 ) : @xmath66(1+\\frac{\\alpha_{s}(q^{2})}{\\pi})}\\label{eq:2.3 } \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath67 is the qcd `` running '' coupling constant . at low energies ( @xmath7 @xmath61 ) according to vdm the quark electromagnetic current is carried out by the vector mesons what has been confirmed by the annihilation experiments .",
    "the relation of the quark electromagnetic current @xmath68 and the pion electromagnetic form factor @xmath69 is given by the following matrix element@xcite : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the four - momentum transfer @xmath72 of scattered particle .",
    "the form factor can be obtained in a time - like region @xmath73 from the annihilation experiments discussed above . here",
    "we consider the cross section for an inverse reaction of pion annihilation @xmath74 important for di - electron production .",
    "the cross section for this reaction can be calculated according to the production graph shown in fig.1a assuming the vdm .",

    "contains the @xmath0 meson propagator and the @xmath83 , @xmath84 coupling constants . it can be also easily calculated comparing the internal lines of two production graphs in fig.1a , where @xmath82 is shown as a blob in the right graph : @xmath85 the precise description of @xmath86 , obtained by the eq.([eq:2.8 ] ) including @xmath0-@xmath1 mixing and one - loop pion contribution@xcite,@xcite .",
    "time - like electromagnetic form factors for other hadrons can be obtained by studying invariant mass distributions of di - electrons streaming from the dalitz @xmath87 decays . according to the vdm",
    ", these decays proceed as shown in fig.2 , as two sequential body decays : @xmath88 with the sub sequential virtual @xmath89 gamma - ray conversion described by the eq.([eq:1.3 ] ) .",

    "this is due to the @xmath0 meson dominance in the @xmath112 conversion process .",
    "one should note , that the parametrization of the pion form factor given in table.i is nothing else but the @xmath82 given by eq.([eq:2.8 ] ) but for @xmath113 accessible in the @xmath95 dalitz decay .",
    "the first two decays from table.i , agree with the vdm predictions but for the @xmath1 decay a strong discrepancy is observed@xcite,@xcite .",
    "it well known today that the di - electron dalitz processes as well for mesons as for baryons are of large interest for the understanding of the structure of hadrons .",
    "furthermore , the pion annihilation , the vector mesons two - body decays and the dalitz meson decay are important processes in di - electron spectroscopy performed in many experiments such as hades collaboration and in future cbm collaboration at the gsi in germany .",
