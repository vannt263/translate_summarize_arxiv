    "the shell model concepts of _ closures _ , _ magic numbers _ and _ inert cores _ leads to a reasonably good description of nuclear phenomena in light as well as in heavy nuclei . however , recent experimental findings show that shell closures might get eroded in very neutron - rich nuclei and that the inter - shell correlations among nucleons play a decisive role for the structure of these nuclei .",
    "a famous example is the nucleus @xmath5 mg which is strongly deformed in the ground state , despite its neutron number @xmath6 , e.g. @xcite .",
    "ar ( left ) and @xmath4ar ( right ) .",
    "excitation energy @xmath7 is plotted along the y - axis .",
    "the calculations have been performed in the @xmath1 shell using the usd interaction @xcite .",
    "the model space allows only the formation of positive parity states . ]    thus , shell closures are not rigid and there have been for a long time indications for cross - shell correlations even in nuclei close to classical double - magic nuclei like @xmath8ca . for this nucleus ,",
    "these include the observation of a strong m1 transition @xcite and of a non - vanishing gamow - teller ( gt ) strength built on the @xmath8ca ground state @xcite . on the theory side , recent studies @xcite show that there are very large admixtures of @xmath1 configurations in low - energy states of ca isotopes with @xmath9 , although these nuclei are usually considered as `` good '' @xmath2 shell nuclei .     strength distributions for @xmath3ar ( left ) and @xmath4ar ( right ) .",
    "the calculations have been performed in the @xmath1-shell using the usd interaction @xcite .",
    "the spin part of the m1 operator has been quenched by a factor of 0.75 which is in agreement with the one deduced for other nuclei in this mass range @xcite .",
    "the same quenching of the spin part of the m1 operator has been used throughout this paper .",
    "experimental error bars , which are of order of 10@xmath10 for all measured states , are not shown here and in all further figures . ]",
    "another indication for the erosion of the @xmath1@xmath2 closure near @xmath11 are the data for the m1 strength in @xmath3ar and @xmath4ar @xcite .",
    "while experimentally the m1 strength distribution for both nuclei is rather fragmented , this feature is reproduced by @xmath1 shell model calculations for @xmath3ar , while these studies predict only one strong m1 transition for @xmath4ar , in clear contradiction to the data @xcite .",
    "obviously a single @xmath1-shell model space , allowing only for two proton holes with respect to a @xmath8ca core , besides a closed neutron shell , is too limited for a description of the m1 data in @xmath4ar .",
    "the fact that cross - shell excitations are quite important is revealed by a detailed comparison of the experimental and calculated spectrum at low energies .",
    "the shell model calculations have been performed within the @xmath1 shell using the standard usd interaction @xcite .",
    "the model space does not allow the formation of negative parity states , but the calculation also misses a few of the low - lying @xmath12 and @xmath13 states in @xmath4ar , while the agreement between theory and experiment is quite sufficient for the positive parity states in @xmath3ar ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) . in fig.[fig2",
    "] we compare the experimental m1 strength distribution with the shell model results , which are similar to those published earlier in @xcite .",
    "the shell model code antoine @xcite has been used for all calculations presented in this paper .",
    "the detailed comparison of the @xmath1-shell model results with the data shows that the m1 data for the two argon isotopes @xmath3ar and @xmath4ar present a challenge to theory : correlations between @xmath1 and @xmath2 shells should not affect the major features of the m1 strength distribution for @xmath3ar , but must be essential for the @xmath4ar m1 data , e.g. if only two neutrons are added to the nucleus .",
    "the present paper is an attempt to reproduce this striking behavior on the basis of large - scale shell model calculations which combine both @xmath1 and @xmath2 shells .",
    "we have followed two routes . at first",
    ", we have performed studies within the complete @xmath14 shell . however , due to computational limitations these calculations had to be restricted to 2-particle 2-hole ( 2p2h ) and 4p4h excitations from the @xmath1- to the @xmath2-shell .",
    "these studies were supplemented by full diagonalization calculations within the @xmath15 model space ( denoted as @xmath16 space below ) .",
    "further additional 1p1h coupling between the @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 orbitals and the @xmath16 space has been taken into account  this extended space is refered to as @xmath20 below . as we will show in the following sections , the calculations in the @xmath20 model space indeed result in fragmentation of the m1 strength for both argon isotopes and also reproduce their low - energy excitation spectrum .",
    "there have been several attempts to derive a suitable effective interaction for the @xmath14 model space ( see , for example @xcite and references therein ) . for our study",
    "we adopt the one of ref .",
    "this interaction contains three parts : the usd interaction for the @xmath1-shell @xcite , the kb matrix elements for the @xmath2 shell @xcite and the g - matrix of kahana , lee and scott for the cross - shell matrix elements @xcite .",
    "the @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 monopole terms have been adjusted to some recent experimental data @xcite .",
    "we note hat there is a problem with spurious center - of - mass ( com ) excitations for the chosen configuration space . to treat this problem",
    "we have added the tenfold of the center - of - mass hamiltonian to the original hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "this procedure pushes states with predominantly center - of - mass excitations up in energy and practically eliminates the spurious excitations in the low - energy states of interest here .",
    "unfortunately full diagonalization studies are yet not possible in the complete @xmath14 model space due to computational limitations .",
    "however , it is feasible to perform calculations for @xmath4ar in which 2 particles or even 4 particles are promoted from the @xmath1 shell to the @xmath2 shell",
    ". we will refer to these studies as 2p2h and 4p4h calculations , respectively .",
    "the dimension of the 4p4h model space is 227 625 436 for @xmath25 states in the m - coupling scheme .",
    "for @xmath3ar we have performed 2p2h calculations , corresponding to 3 148 356 @xmath25 states .    these studies , however , showed no improvement for the @xmath4ar spectrum compared to the pure @xmath1-shell results .",
    "in fact the first excited @xmath12 state lies at an excitation energy above 7 mev , with very little mixing to the ground state which had basically an @xmath1 shell configuration .",
    "consequently no fragmentation has been found in our calculation of the m1 strength distributions for @xmath4ar .",
    "we also have performed no - core shell model @xcite calculations in a @xmath26 model space using the ucom interaction @xcite obtaining similar results .",
    "ar in the full @xmath14 space with 4p4h cross - shell excitations .",
    "the calculations have been performed using a monopole - modified interaction as described in the text . ]",
    "the mixing of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 shell configurations can be enhanced by slight monopole modifications in the interaction .",
    "this strategy has been applied in large - scale shell model calculations of @xmath3ar and leads to a quite satisfying description of the strongly deformed 4p4h band and its coupling to the ground state band @xcite . following this reference",
    "we have lowered the energy of the @xmath27p@xmath27h configurations with @xmath28 and @xmath29 by suitable monopole shifts , in this way enforcing @xmath2-shell configurations to mix into the ground states . as it is expected the mixing results in fragmentation of the m1 strength distribution .",
    "this can be seen in fig.[fig3 ] which shows the calculated m1 strength for @xmath4ar obtained in a 4p4h calculation and employing lanczos diagonalization with 50 iterations .",
    "indeed the strong m1 transition observed in the pure @xmath1-shell calculation is now split into several components and some m1 strength is shifted to higher excitation energies .",
    "nevertheless , the agreement with data is only marginal . in particular , the data show already some m1 strength around 8 mev , which is missing in the calculation .",
    "this is possibly improved if @xmath27p@xmath27h configurations with @xmath30 were included ",
    "previous shell model studies @xcite indicated that energies of the states in nuclei around @xmath8ca are converging rather slowly when @xmath27p@xmath27h cross - shell excitations with larger @xmath27 are gradually added . while such converged calculations are yet impossible in the complete @xmath14 shell , they are , however , feasible in the @xmath16 and @xmath20 model spaces ( see text above ) to which we turn in the next section .",
    "we have performed diagonalization calculations in the @xmath20 model space which includes the spin - orbit partners ( missing in the @xmath16 space ) approximately by allowing 1p1h excitations from the @xmath17 orbital to the rest of the @xmath1 shell , and from the @xmath31 space to the @xmath32 sub - space , respectively . in other words",
    "we put 1p1h predominantly spin - flip excitations on top of the complex @xmath27p@xmath27h @xmath33 cross - shell configurations obtained within the @xmath16 space .",
    "this extension increases the dimension of the model space from 2.3 million ( @xmath16 ) to nearly 75 million ( @xmath20 ) for @xmath4ar . for the calculations we have used the same effective interaction as in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath16 model space allows up to 8 or 10 particles to be promoted from the @xmath1-shell to the @xmath2-shell for @xmath3ar and @xmath4ar , respectively .",
    "it turns out these cross - shell excitations are sufficient to achieve a good agreement between our calculations and the experimental @xmath4ar spectrum . as one can observe in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ,    ar within the full @xmath20 space . ]",
    "the calculation now yields the low - lying @xmath12 and @xmath13 excitations which were missing in the @xmath1-model space ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the calculated @xmath3ar spectrum in the @xmath20 model space ( see fig . [ fig5 ] ) agrees similarly well with the data as the pure @xmath1-shell result ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) for the positive parity states . for both argon isotopes the calculated negative parity spectrum , missing in the pure @xmath1-shell studies , agrees quite well with the observed one .",

    "the interference of these two contributions produces the fragmentation of the m1 strength .",
    "the further addition of new components like @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) and @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) does not change the fragmentation picture qualitatively , however , the summed b(m1 ) strength increases from 2.95 @xmath51 ( @xmath73 case ) to 4.02 @xmath51 and 4.20 @xmath51 , respectively , as more @xmath2-shell components are mixed into the ground state wave function .",
