    "a common problem in numerical relativity is the global treatment of asymptotically flat space - times , specially related to the implementation of boundary conditions on an artificial time - like boundary and the measurement of gravitational radiation by detectors located on time - like trajectories .",
    "most of the initial value problems formulated are based on a cauchy space - like foliation with the hypersurfaces approaching spatial infinity @xmath0 .",
    "then , boundary conditions must be supplied at an artificial boundary , for instance , absorbing boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "recent efforts point to the use of hyperboloidal foliations of the space - time , because asymptotically the spatial slices reach future null infinity @xmath1 and for asymptotically flat space - times , the gravitational radiation is well defined at such boundary @xcite , so that the measurement of the gravitational radiation can be observed by detectors near or at that boundary .",
    "more common efforts are related to matching techniques of cauchy slices with slices approaching future null infinity @xcite , which has already been applied to the binary black hole problem @xcite . on the other hand , it is desirable to compactify the space - time foliated in this manner in order to work on a numerical domain that contains @xmath1 , for which it is necessary to compactify the spatial coordinates in an appropriate way such that the space - time is regular there , at future null infinity . at present time",
    ", foliations with boundaries at future null infinity are being used for various applications , like the solution of perturbation equations @xcite and the study of tails @xcite .",
    "the idea behind scri - fixing conformal compactification is the following : i ) use hyperboloidal slices that reach @xmath1 , ii ) compactify the spatial coordinate , iii ) rescale the metric with an appropriate conformal factor .",
    "we proceed by defining a new time coordinate @xmath2 , where ( @xmath3 ) are the original time and space coordinates this transformation has the advantage that keeps the time direction invariant .",
    "that is , regardless of the choice of the @xmath4 , the time - like killing vector has the same form in both coordinate systems .",
    "a compactifying coordinate is introduced in the form @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is a non - negative conformal factor that vanishes at @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "then the physical metric @xmath7 becomes singular at the boundary of the compact coordinate . in order to remove the singularities",
    "the metric is rescaled @xmath8 with the conformal factor so that the conformal metric @xmath9 is regular at the boundary @xmath1 . on the other hand , for the construction of @xmath4 , we restrict in this paper to the case of constant mean curvature ( cmc ) slices @xcite .",
    "in this manuscript we present the solution of the wave equation for the extended minkowski and schwarzschild space - times described with cmc slices , construct the foliations and compactification , and solve the wave equation on top of the resulting space - times with a twofold goal , on the one hand we verify as an academic exercise that the behavior of the wave function is consistent with the properties of the particular space - times constructed here , we are explicit in the construction of the numerical solution of the wave equation in one spatial dimension and illustrate the role played by the gauge . on the other hand , we study in particular the wave function on top of the schwarzschild space - time , and track the quasinormal mode frequencies and tail decay rates of the amplitude of the wave function , which is also the case of a test mass - less scalar field evolving on the space - time .",
    "once the space - time has been foliated with hyperboloidal slices , the spatial coordinate has been compactified and the metric rescaled , it is necessary to solve a wave equation that is physically meaningful .",
    "thus the wave equation to be solved has to be a conformally invariant one .",

    "for the cases presented in this manuscript , the conformally invariant wave equation for the 1 + 1 minkowski space - time is @xmath20 , whereas for the schwarschild space - time ( @xmath21 ) the conformally invariant wave equation reads @xmath22 .",
    "we solve these two equations as initial value problems in each case using a first order variable formulation . in the case of the solution of the wave equation on the schwarzschild space - time",
    ", the equation also corresponds to a test mass - less scalar field , which is related to quasinormal mode oscillations of the black hole and study the polynomial tail decay of the amplitude of the scalar field ; in such case we use mass - less scalar field and wave function indistinctly .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we solve the conformally invariant wave equation on top of the 1 + 1 minkowski space - time , and provide diagrams illustrating the results . in section iii",
    "we solve the conformally invariant wave equation on top of a scri - fixing conformally compactified version of the schwarzschild solution ; we show the quasinormal mode oscillations and the tail decay of the scalar field , and compare with previous results . in section",
    "iv we present general formulas useful to set up slicings with constant mean curvature and scri - fixing conformal compactification for spherically symmetric and static space - times in spherical coordinates ; we show as an example the 3 + 1 minkowski space - time in spherical coordinates . finally in section",
    "v we summarize the main results .",
    "we choose the coordinates of the space - time @xmath23 and the line element    @xmath24    where @xmath25 . in order to construct the hyperboloidal slices ,",

    "then the future - pointing unit vector normal to the hypersurface @xmath31 is    @xmath32    with which it is possible to calculate the mean extrinsic curvature of the slice @xmath33 :    @xmath34    where the second equality is obtained after assuming @xmath35 is constant , and finally @xmath36 is an integration constant .",
    "this equation can be manipulated to give a complete description of the slices :    @xmath37    where @xmath38 . the space - time in these new coordinates is described with hyperboloidal constant mean curvature slices .    in order to compactify the space - time at the future null infinity boundary it suffices to define a new spatial compact",
    "coordinate @xmath39 defined through @xmath40 .",
    "a convenient choice of the conformal factor is @xmath41 , because we want the two asymptotic ends @xmath42 correspond to @xmath43 in the compactified coordinate .",
    "this choice has been used for instance in @xcite to construct the solution of the perturbation equation of charged wormholes . in this way , using @xmath44 with @xmath41 , @xmath45 , implies @xmath46 , and finally the conformal metric reads    @xmath47    in order to find the gauge functions , this conformal metric has to be identified with the standard 1 + 1 metric of type ( [ eq : metricadm1p1 ] ) , where we remove the tildes because we deal with the conformal metric .",
    "the identification implies the following gauge functions :    @xmath48    which are the ones used to describe the space - time on top of which we solve the wave equation .",
    "we solve the conformally invariant wave equation .",
    "for this case @xmath49 and @xmath50 , the wave operator is conformally invariant , thus we solve the equation ( [ eq : invwave ] )    @xmath18=0 \\nonumber\\ ] ]    for the metric ( [ eq : metric_mink_conformal ] , [ eq : gauge_mink_wave ] ) as an initial value problem .",
    "it is straightforward to show that assuming @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , the wave equation can be written as a first order system of equations given by    @xmath54    where @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "this system of equations holds as long as @xmath57 .",
    "the third equation is a definition of @xmath58 but it is also a constraint of the system that has to be satisfied . the value of the wave function is obtained from the definition of @xmath59 , that is @xmath60 and can be integrated in time at the same time as @xmath59 and @xmath58 .",
    "we define the state vector @xmath61 , so that the wave equation can be cast in a balance law form @xmath62 , where    @xmath63    and the characteristic speeds of the system are given by    @xmath64    these eigenvalues are real and distinct and in fact correspond to a complete set of eigenvectors .",

    "we choose initial data corresponding to an initially time - symmetric wave function with gaussian profile .",
    "in particular we use @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "we solve this problem using a finite differences approximation , with a method of lines using second order stencils along the spatial direction and a third order runge - kutta time integrator .",
    "the question about the boundary conditions @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath72 remains , and the answer is that there is no need to apply boundary conditions ( e.g. radiative boundary conditions ) because we notice that in the continuum limit at @xmath73 the characteristic speed corresponding to the mode moving to the right is zero ( @xmath74 ) , whereas the characteristic speed of the mode moving to the left at @xmath75 is also zero ( @xmath76 ) , and then no signals are propagated into the domain of the problem .",
    "the result is as expected , the initial gaussian pulse will split into two pulses with half the initial amplitude and opposite directions , and the speed of propagation of each pulse depends on the coordinates chosen .",

    "the implication is that the pulses of the initial data propagating outwards will slow down and squeeze when they approach the boundaries in the case of small @xmath77 .                    in order to obtain a better understanding of the nature of the slices ,",
