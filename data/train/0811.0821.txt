    "a wealth of observational evidence attests to the existence of dark matter ( dm ) ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite for reviews ) .",
    "however , despite the fact that dm accounts for a large fraction of the total energy density of the universe , it has evaded direct detection and its particle properties remain unknown .",
    "if dark matter is a thermal relic , it should have a small , but non - negligible , self annihilation cross section .",
    "this allows a means of indirect detection of dm , as annihilations in the universe today may generate an observable flux of products . for thermal relic dm ,",
    "a total annihilation cross section of @xmath6 is needed in order to obtain the observed relic abundance of @xmath7 .",
    "( we shall work with the quantity @xmath8 , which is the product of the annihilation cross section and relative velocity , averaged over the dark matter velocity distribution . in the milky way , @xmath9 . )",
    "if dm is not a thermal relic , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite , even larger annihilation cross sections are possible .",
    "there have also been a number of recent proposals in which @xmath8 is enhanced at low velocity  @xcite ( i.e. , in galactic halos ) while still satisfying the thermal relic constraints .",
    "( note that these scenarios are subject to constraints arising from annihilations in the first collapsed structures  @xcite . )    while the total cross section may be related to the relic abundance , the branching ratios to any particular final states are model - dependent .",
    "if we assume the dm is the lightest new particle beyond those in the standard model ( sm ) , then the branching ratio to sm final states must be 100% .",
    "annihilations must then produce fluxes of detectable particles emanating from regions of dm concentration , with signals such as gamma rays , microwaves , neutrinos , and positrons being of particular interest .",
    "there exist general constraints on the total annihilation cross - section , based upon unitarity  @xcite and the requirement that annihilations not significantly alter halo density profiles  @xcite . a strong bound",
    "is placed on the total annihilation cross section by assuming that the branching ratio to neutrinos , the least detectable final state , is 100%  @xcite .",
    "we focus here on the process @xmath10 in which dm annihilates to an electron - positron pair , though we shall also report results for the other charged leptons .",
    "although the branching ratio to this particular final state is model - dependent , it is a significant channel in a wide range of models .",
    "for example , while annihilation to fermions is helicity suppressed in supersymmetric models , kaluza - klein dm features large ( unsuppressed ) annihilation rates to leptons @xcite , as does the dirac dm model of ref .",
    "numerous authors have recently proposed models in which annihilation to charged leptons is significantly enhanced  @xcite , making upper limits on the cross section to these annihilation products particularly interesting .",
    "in addition , various other sm final states , such as @xmath11 and @xmath12 , produce @xmath13 via their decays and hence a flux of charged leptons is of generic interest in a large variety of dm models .",
    "several techniques may be used to constrain the production of @xmath2 within galactic halos , all of which rely on the fact the charged particles inevitably produce photons .",
    "signals considered include gamma rays , x - rays , microwaves and radio waves .",
    "photons are produced by the various energy loss processes that charged particles undergo in a galactic halo , examples of which include synchrotron radiation due to the propagation of @xmath14 in galactic magnetic fields , and inverse compton scattering of electrons from interstellar radiation fields , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "the drawback of these techniques is a significant dependence on astrophysical inputs , some of which are poorly known .",
    "uncertainties in magnetic field strengths , radiation backgrounds , and electron diffusion scales all enter the calculations in an involved fashion .",
    "charged particles also produce photons via electromagnetic radiative corrections  @xcite .",
    "the lowest order dark matter annihilation process @xmath15 is necessarily accompanied by the radiative correction @xmath16 .",
    "this is an _ internal bremsstrahlung _",
    "( ib ) process , meaning that the photon arises at the feynman diagram level and is not due to interaction of charged particles in a medium .",
    "importantly , for a given annihilation cross section , @xmath4 , the accompanying flux of ib photons can be determined without knowledge of the new underlying particle physics which mediates the dm annihilation .",
    "moreover , ib suffers none the drawbacks of the competing inverse compton and synchrotron techniques outlined above . while inverse compton and synchrotron fluxes are dependent on conditions of the astrophysical environment , the ib flux is always present and its normalization and spectrum are predetermined .    in this paper",
    "we use ib emission to derive robust upper limits on the dark matter annihilation cross section to electron - positron pairs @xmath4 over a wide dm mass range spanning @xmath17 gev .",
    "we calculate dm annihilation fluxes produced in the galactic halo , and compare with the gamma - ray backgrounds reported by comptel , egret and h.e.s.s .",
    "we also look at data for the m31 ( andromeda ) galaxy , to fill a gap between the energy ranges covered by egret and h.e.s.s .",
    "we explicitly demonstrate how our limits vary according to the assumed dm halo profile ( our one source of uncertainty ) and also compare our limit on the annihilation cross section to @xmath2 with corresponding bounds on the @xmath18 and @xmath19 final states .",
    "if dm annihilates to produce charged particles , the lowest order processes will always be subject to electromagnetic radiative corrections , resulting in the production of real photons .",
    "in particular , the annihilation @xmath20 will be accompanied by the internal bremsstrahlung process @xmath21 .",
    "a photon may be emitted from either the final state @xmath22 or @xmath23 , with a cross - section proportional to @xmath24 .",
    "see refs .",
    "@xcite for a detailed discussion . to a good approximation ,",
    "the differential cross section for @xmath25 is @xmath26\\bigg[1+\\bigg ( \\frac{s'}{s}\\bigg)^2\\bigg ] , \\label{sigbrem}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the photon energy , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 is the tree - level cross section for @xmath31 .",
    "note that @xmath30 factors from the ib cross - section .",
    "this important feature implies that the ib spectrum is independent of the unknown physics which mediates the lowest order annihilation process .",

    "suppressed , bremsstrahlung from internal propagators can be particularly important as it can circumvent this suppression  @xcite .",
