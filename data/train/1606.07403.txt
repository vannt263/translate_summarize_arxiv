    "<S> we may call  alien particles \" those particles belonging to the matter / field content of a @xmath0-dimensional brane other than the @xmath1-brane ( or stack of branes ) sweeping the space - time in which we live . </S>",
    "<S> they can appear in our space - time at the regions of intersection between our and their brane . </S>",
    "<S> they can be identified ( or not ) as alien matter depending on their properties , on the physical laws governing their evolution in the  homeland \" brane , and on the details of our detection techniques .    </S>",
    "<S> modern physical theories  in particular , higher - dimensional unified models of gravity and of the other fundamental interactions  have accustomed us to the idea that the space - time in which we live can be appropriately represented as the four - dimensional hypersurface spanned by the evolution of a @xmath1-brane , embedded in an external  bulk \" manifold . </S>",
    "<S> we may recall , in this respect , the so - called brane - world scenario , and its many physical / cosmological applications ( see e.g. ref . 1 for an updated review ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the bulk , however , might also contain many other branes similar to ours . </S>",
    "<S> the space - times spanned by the various branes might have reciprocal ( and possible multiple ) intersections . </S>",
    "<S> the intersection of ( wrapping , dirichlet ) branes is indeed at the ground of possible string - theory explanations of basic standard model properties , such as the chirality of the fermion spectrum and the observed number of quark / lepton generations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> but there are also cosmological and inflationary consequences of brane intersections @xcite .    quite independently of the possible motivations / applications mentioned above , another important aspect of brane intersections , in my opinion , is the following . </S>",
    "<S> even if the matter / field content of a given brane is rigidly localized ( excluding gravity @xcite ) on the associated world - volume , a direct interaction among the matter components of different branes ( or stacks of branes ) turns out to be possible , in principle , at the intersection regions , where the world - lines of particles belonging to different branes can mix and intersect . </S>",
    "<S> those regions may thus behave as open windows on the extra dimensions .    </S>",
    "<S> let us consider , in such a context , the high - energy collision of two particles @xmath2 and @xmath3 belonging to our brane @xmath4 , and suppose that the collision point lies within the region of spatial intersection with another brane @xmath5 . in that case the collision can possibly produce particles ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 ,  ) which are living on the brane @xmath5 ( let us call them  alien \" particles ) , but which nevertheless propagate , are visible , and can possibly be detected also inside our brane  at least until they keep inside the region of spatial intersection .    </S>",
    "<S> if the two branes @xmath4 and @xmath5 are identical and , in particular , characterized by the same particle content , then no anomalous effect associated to the process @xmath8 can obviously be observed . </S>",
    "<S> the particle content of the two branes , however , could be different ; in addition , the physical properties of the so - called alien particles could differ , in principle , from the properties of the particles belonging to our brane .     and @xmath9 with timelike ( left ) and spacelike ( right ) intersections . </S>",
    "<S> we have also plotted two possible quantum processes localized in our brane @xmath10 , and described by feynman diagrams with external legs in @xmath10 and internal legs in the region of intersection with @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the particle propagating in the intersection region is virtual in the right picture , and real in the left one.,height=6 ]    for a simple illustration of this possibility we may refer those models allowing ( and predicting ) the time and space variation of the so - called fundamental constants . according to such models a theory of fundamental interactions has in general many possible ground states ( or vacua ) , with possibly different realizations ( and different physical constants ) in different bulk domains : hence , the alien particles living on @xmath5 might obey physical laws characterized by a set of fundamental parameters different from those typical of our brane @xmath4 .    </S>",
    "<S> we shall concentrate , in this essay , on the particularly interesting case in which the physics and the particle content of the two branes @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the same except for the fact that , on the @xmath5 brane , light propagates in vacuum with a constant velocity @xmath11 ( let us suppose , in particular , @xmath12 ) . </S>",
    "<S> hence , alien particles satisfy the usual relativistic laws with @xmath13 replaced by @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> this , of course , can break the global lorentz symmetry of the higher - dimensional bulk manifold , but has no effect on the ( separate ) validity of the relativistic lorentz invariance in the four - dimensional space - times spanned by the two branes in localized ( microscopic ) space - times domains was first considered , to the best of my knowledge , in refs . </S>",
    "<S> 12 and 13 . </S>",
    "<S> more recently , the possible variation of the speed of light in vacuum has been proposed and discussed also at a macroscopic and cosmological level @xcite ( see ref . </S>",
    "<S> 17 for a detailed review ) . ] .    </S>",
    "<S> the obvious question which arises , in this case , is the following : can we discover the anomalous behavior of this type of particles , and unambiguously classify them as alien particles ? </S>",
    "<S> the answer crucially depends on our detection techniques .    </S>",
    "<S> if the life of an alien particle inside our brane is long enough to allow for direct velocity measurements ( of the particle itself , or of its alien decay products ) then , of course , the anomaly might explicitly appear whenever we could find for the velocity @xmath15 a result in the range @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> even if @xmath17 , however , the anomaly might appear when , measuring also the relativistic momentum @xmath18 and energy @xmath19 of the particle , we could find that p = e v c^2 ( since , for the alien particle , @xmath20 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> similarly , if the type of particle ( and its mass ) is known , and if we could be able to measure both @xmath21 and @xmath18 , the anomaly might appear whenever p ( v ) = mv ( 1- v^2/c^2)^1/2 ( since , for the alien particle , the effective lorentz factor depends on the ratio @xmath22 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the situation is different , however , in the more realistic case of very short - lived particles only until they are inside the region of intersection with their brane , a region expected to have , in general , very limited spatial ( and temporal ) extension . ] </S>",
    "<S> ( like , for instance , a typical hadronic resonance ) . in that case </S>",
    "<S> there is no hope ( at present ) to measure its velocity , and the only kinematical variable that we can associate to the particle is the so - called  invariant mass \" parameter @xmath23 , obtained from the total energy @xmath24 of its decay products in the center of mass system by applying the standard relation @xmath25 .    </S>",
    "<S> this relation is incorrect , of course , for alien particles , for which @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to overestimate the real mass of the particle by the factor = ( c/ c)^2 . </S>",
    "<S> this discrepancy could only appear by comparing the kinematic parameter @xmath23 with complementary experimental information on the actual mass value , obtained for instance from measures concerning the particle gravitational interactions . barring this , as well other , presently unlikely , possibilities </S>",
    "<S> , we can ask : are there particle states which might have been misinterpreted , up to now , in this way ?    </S>",
    "<S> the question may be legitimate , in principle , for those states which mainly differ only for their masses and have very similar quantum numbers . </S>",
    "<S> are ( some of ) these states alien particles ? is the width of such states ( i.e. , the associated mean life ) determined by the size ( or the  </S>",
    "<S> thickness ) of the intersection region between our brane and the alien brane ? </S>",
    "<S> is our universe , at the subnuclear level , a dense and tangled network of intertwining brane space - times , continuously overlapping , splitting up , and crossing among each other ?    </S>",
    "<S> maybe the example considered here  namely , alien branes with different values of @xmath13  is not the most appropriate or the most realistic case to consider . </S>",
    "<S> maybe there are more fundamental parameters varying through different domains of the bulk space - time ( let us recall , in this respect , the possible relation between the observed values of the standard yukawa couplings and the intersection area of different branes @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , i think there is a possible lesson that we could learn from the above discussion .    in the occurrence of unexpected results in high - energy experiments ( like , for instance </S>",
    "<S> , the @xmath27 gev diphoton excess@xcite recently reported at lhc ) , we should look for possible interpretations not only as signals of new particles not included in the standard phenomenological scenario , but also as signals produced by standard particles crossing our space - time but coming from an  outside \" brane , where physics is the same but ( some of ) the fundamental physical parameters are appreciably different .    remarkably , this approach could also provide a way  probably the only way  to test the so - called ( and so far experimentally elusive ) multiverse scenario @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the existence of different physical domains in very distant , disconnected regions of space - time is likely not directly testable , as stressed in ref . </S>",
    "<S> 11 . </S>",
    "<S> the local intersections of different branes , on the contrary , could bring the  alien \" space - time domains ( i.e. , the different ground state regimes ) directly inside our world and our accessible physical experience . </S>"
