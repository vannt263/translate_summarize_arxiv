    "<S> the black dotted curves are the corresponding boundaries calculated with an effective two - band model . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : bs].,width=340 ]    _ topological band structure_. as demonstrated in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the lowest band of hamiltonian eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqn : h ] ) can be topologically non - trivial under appropriate parameters . under the two - band model @xmath41 </S>",
    "<S> , the gap between the lowest two bands closes at a critical zeeman field @xmath66 , and the lowest band changes from topologically non - trivial for @xmath67 to topologically trivial for @xmath68  @xcite . under the raman - induced high - band effect however , the condition for the emergence of a topological band structure can be quite different . to characterize the topological invariant of the lowest band , we calculate the chern number of the band  @xcite : @xmath69 , where the berry connection @xmath70 and @xmath71 is single - particle wave function at the quasi - momentum @xmath38 in the first brillioun zone . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : topo]a , we plot the chern - number phase diagram for the topology of the lowest band . </S>",
    "<S> apparently , as @xmath18 increases , the boundaries of the topological band deviates from that of the simple two - band model . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , there appears to be a maximal @xmath18 below which the lowest band can be topological . for small @xmath5 </S>",
    "<S> , this suggests the existence of a high - band induced topological boundary as @xmath18 is increased . </S>",
    "<S> these features can be probed using the spin - projection measurements  @xcite , and can give rise to new topological phase transitions in a fermi gas under the 2d lattice soc .    another interesting observation </S>",
    "<S> is that the topology of the single - particle band structure can be carried over to the quasi - particle excitation spectrum . unlike the single - particle situation </S>",
    "<S> , the chern number for the excitation spectrum is defined in a symplectic manner  @xcite . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : topo]b , we show the chern - number diagram of the lowest band in the excitation spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> while the overall phase structure is similar to that of the lowest band in the single - particle spectrum , the topologically non - trivial region is larger in the excitation spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , as the spin polarization of the condensate differs on either side of the @xmath20 axis , a fine structure emerges in the phase boundaries near the @xmath20 axis at small @xmath18 , which may be attributed to the competition between the interactions and the effective zeeman field @xmath5  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the non - trivial band topology of the excitation spectrum can lead to interesting chiral edge modes in the quasi - particle excitations in the presence of boundaries  @xcite . in cold atomic experiment , </S>",
    "<S> these edge modes may be excited and probed using radio frequency spectroscopy .    _ effective two - band model_. so far , we have demonstrated that high - band effects can significantly modify the system properties as @xmath18 increases . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is not always easy or desirable to carry out a full - band calculation . to solve this dilemma </S>",
    "<S> , we propose an effective two - band model , which captures the essential high - band physics in the experimentally relevant regime when @xmath18 is not too large . </S>",
    "<S> our formalism can be summarized as follows : ( i ) we start from a minimal multi - band model with only @xmath19- and @xmath72-orbital of the lattice potential , and perform adiabatic elimination to get an effective two - band model with only @xmath19-orbital contributions ; ( ii ) we fit the parameters of the effective two - band model using a handful of data points from the single - particle spectrum and the many - body phase diagram obtained by the full - band calculations . </S>",
    "<S> the consideration behind this procedure is that the effective model derived in ( i ) , while applicable in the limit of a deep lattice and weak raman couplings , should contain the leading terms responsible for the high - band effects , although the coefficients may be modified as @xmath18 increases . </S>",
    "<S> formally , the effective model can be written as @xmath73 where @xmath74 , @xmath75 creates a particle with bloch momentum @xmath76 and spin @xmath4 , and the parameters @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 can be systematically fitted with data from full - band calculations  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , while @xmath78 contains an effective in - plane zeeman field that explicitly breaks the inversion symmetry , the effective interaction involves interesting spin - spin correlations . as shown in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : pd ] ,  [ fig : bs ] , and  [ fig : topo ] , the effective model works reasonably well in the experimentally relevant regime with small to moderate @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> we stress that the formalism discussed here is quite general and can be applied to describe high - band effects in systems with arbitrary raman - assisted lattice socs .    _ </S>",
    "<S> summary_. we study the behavior of a bec under the recently realized 2d lattice soc . </S>",
    "<S> while high - band effects drastically modify system properties and lead to high - band - induced `` roton '' gaps and topological phase transitions , we derive an effective two - band model , which is able to capture the high - band physics to the leading order . </S>",
    "<S> our results not only offer valuable insights into the novel two - dimensional lattice spin - orbit coupling , but also provide a systematic formalism to model high - band effects in lattice systems with raman - assisted soc .    _ </S>",
