    "with the increasing demand of radio spectrum , cognitive radio ( cr ) @xcite has drawn great attention in the world these days for its ability of operation in licensed bands without a license . in cognitive radio systems ,",
    "the cognitive ( unlicensed ) user needs to detect the presence of the primary ( licensed ) users as quickly as possible and dynamically change system parameters , such as the transmitting spectrum and modulation schemes , so as to best utilize the valuable spectrum .",
    "recently , several papers @xcite,@xcite have discussed the achievable rate of such a cognitive radio system from the view of information theory .",
    "literature @xcite studied the achievable rate of cognitive user under the constraint that ( i ) no interference is created for the primary user , and ( ii ) the primary encoder - decoder pair is oblivious to the presence of cognitive radio .",
    "the authors pointed that , the maximum achievable rate is achieved by a mixed strategy of dirty paper coding and cooperation with the primary user .    in this letter",
    ", we further study the scenario containing multiple cognitive users in the presence of primary transmission .",
    "these cognitive users wish to communicate with a same access point ( ap )",
    ". we first model this system as a cognitive multiple access channel ( mac ) and character the capacity region of the cognitive mac channel .",
    "then , the problem of maximizing the sum - rate capacity is formulated as a nonlinear optimization problem . employing the classic lagrangian multiplier method , an iterative algorithm to achieve the maximum sum - rate capacity",
    "is proposed .",
    "the remainder of this letter is organized as follows .",
    "section ii gives the system model .",
    "section iii abstracts the system model in section ii into an information theory model , and the capacity region of it is analyzed . in section iv , the problem of achieving the sum - rate optimal point is discussed and the corresponding algorithm is given .",
    "finally , we conclude the letter in section v.",
    "the system model we study is the heterogeneous network depicted in fig .",
    "1 . there is a primary user @xmath0 communicating with the base station ( bs ) in a large 3 g cellular network , which uses a licensed spectrum .",
    "a small wlan network without license of the spectrum lies in the communication range of a 3 g cell , where @xmath1 cognitive radio users @xmath2 want to access the wlan access point ( ap ) .        for the above scenario to be studied , we assume the primary user @xmath0 has message @xmath3 intended for the primary receiver @xmath4 to decode , and the cognitive user @xmath5 has message @xmath6 intended for the cognitive receiver @xmath7 .",
    "the average transmit powers of @xmath0 and @xmath8 are constrained by @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "it is assumed that all cognitive users have perfect knowledge of the primary user s codeword @xmath11 .",
    "in this section , we will model the heterogeneous network in fig .",
    "1 as an information theory model , and then analyze its capacity region . the information theory model of the heterogeneous network is depicted in fig.2 .",
    "the small wlan can be viewed as a multiple - access channel with inference from the primary user , whose receive signal is expressed as follows : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the path gain of the link from cognitive user @xmath8 to @xmath7 , @xmath14 is the path gain of the inference link from @xmath0 to @xmath7 , and @xmath15 is additive white gaussian noise with variance @xmath16 . for the large 3 g cellular network ,",
    "the received signal model is : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the path gain of the link from primary user @xmath0 to @xmath4 , @xmath19 is the path gain of the inference link from @xmath8 to @xmath4 , and @xmath20 is additive white gaussian noise with variance @xmath21 .",
    "the capacity region of the cognitive multiple access channel is defined as the set of achievable rates of cognitive users under the constraints that ( i ) no interference is created for the primary user , and ( ii ) the primary encoder - decoder pair is oblivious to the presence of cognitive radio . a simpler scenario which contains only one cognitive user",
    "is studied in @xcite .",
    "the largest rate of the cognitive user is achieved by a mixed strategy of dirty paper coding and cooperation with the primary user .",
    "the optimal coding strategy for the cognitive user @xmath22 is : @xmath23 where the first term @xmath24 denotes that the user @xmath22 s codeword @xmath25 is dirty - paper coded based on the primary user s codeword @xmath11 ( so it is called the _ dirty - paper code part _ ) , and the second term , the _ cooperation part _ , is the duplicated information of the primary user , which is combined with the information from @xmath0 in order to assure the primary user s rate .",
    "in addition , @xmath26 denotes the power ratio of the cooperation part .    for the receiver of the ap",
    ", it can decode each cognitive user s signal @xmath27 as if there is no interference from the primary user due to the dirty paper coding .",
    "therefore , we can regard this model as a gaussian multiple - access channel , and its capacity region is written as @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are constant , but @xmath31 is a variable vector . for the receiver of @xmath4 ,",
    "its rate can be expressed as follows : @xmath32 which should be equal to the original rate as if there is no interference from the cognitive users , i.e. , the following equation must be satisfied : @xmath33 define the set of feasible power allocation policies @xmath34 as @xmath35 then the capacity region of the cognitive mac channel is the convex hull of all capacity regions for every @xmath36 .",
    "that is , @xmath37 an example of capacity region of a two - user cognitive mac channel is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] .    .",
    "the point a corresponds to the maximum sum - rate point , which will be exploited in the next section.,scaledwidth=30.0% ]",
    "in this section , our interests turn to the maximum sum rate point on the capacity region * _",
    "c_*. for a fixed @xmath38 , the sum - rate capacity of the multiple cognitive radio access network is expressed as follows : @xmath39 now , the problem is how to optimally choose the @xmath40 so as to maximize the the sum - rate capacity , which can be formulated as a nonlinear optimization problem : @xmath41   * subject to * @xmath42    we can see that , the optimization object is quadratic and concave , and meanwhile , the constraint is quadratic and convex , but not affine .",
    "so we ca nt solve the above optimization by classical convex optimization algorithms @xcite .",
    "therefore , we will give an iterative algorithm to solve the above problem .",
    "first , a lagrangian multiplier is defined as @xmath43 .",
    "\\label{equ13}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if there is no constraint of @xmath44 , a unique maximizer of @xmath45 exists when @xmath46 where @xmath47 taking into account the restrict of @xmath48 , we obtain @xmath49 where @xmath50 .",
    "define the set @xmath51 as : @xmath52 and substitute ( [ equ16 ] ) into ( [ equ15 ] ) , @xmath53 can be determined as @xmath54 where @xmath55 .",
    "it s still very difficult to calculate @xmath53 and @xmath56 since @xmath51 is determined by @xmath56 . in",
    "what follows , we will introduce an iterative algorithm to the problem .",
    "it is observed from ( [ equ14 ] ) that , when @xmath57 is small enough , @xmath56 satisfies @xmath48 for all @xmath58 . in that case ,",
    "@xmath59 and @xmath53 can be easily calculated by ( [ equ18 ] ) .",
    "in addition , given that @xmath51 is not changed , both @xmath53 and @xmath56 increase with the increasing of @xmath57 . in the case that some @xmath56 turns to one ,",
    "@xmath51 should be updated , so are @xmath53 and @xmath56 .",
    "the flow chart of the proposed algorithm is depicted in fig.[fig5 ] , where @xmath60 is a step size .",
    "the algorithm starts searching from @xmath61 and @xmath59 . for each @xmath57 ,",
    "the algorithm first computes @xmath53 by ( [ equ18 ] ) using the former @xmath51 , and computes @xmath62 ) by ( [ equ16 ] ) .",
    "if @xmath51 is changed , @xmath53 and @xmath56 should be calculated according to the updated @xmath51 .",
    "the algorithm converges when @xmath56 satisfies ( [ equ12 ] ) .",
    "in this letter , we first study the capacity region of cognitive multiple access channel under the constraint that the transmission of primary user is not interfered by cognitive users . then , we investigate the optimization of sum - rate capacity on the capacity region .",
    "the optimization is formulated as a nonlinear problem and an iterative algorithm is introduced ."
