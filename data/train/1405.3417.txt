    "the qatar exoplanet survey ( qes ; alsubai et al .",
    "2013 ) is discovering hot jupiters ( qatar-1b , alsubai et al . 2011 ; qatar-2b , bryan et al .",
    "2012 ) and aims to discover hot saturns and neptunes that transit in front of relatively bright host stars ( 8 - 15 mag ) .",
    "the survey operates a robotic wide - angle multiple - camera system installed at the `` new mexico skies '' observing station in southern new mexico , usa , and it has been in operation since mid - november 2009 . the cameras , which operate without filters for maximum signal - to - noise ( s / n ) , photometrically survey a target field of @xmath0400 square degrees repeatedly with a cadence of @xmath010 minutes .",
    "each target field is followed for @xmath03 - 4 months continuously while it is visible at greater than 30 above the horizon .",
    "each year a new set of target fields are designated .",
    "the time - series images of each field are processed by a customised data pipeline ( sec .  4 of alsubai et al .",
    "2013 ) to calibrate the images , detect objects , perform astrometry , and extract photometry .",
    "only objects successfully matched with stars in the us naval observatory ccd astrograph catalog ( ucac3 ; zacharias et al .",
    "2010 ) are considered further in order to avoid faint stars with very low s / n .",
    "a reference image , chosen as a best - seeing high - s / n image from the time series , is subtracted from each image in the time series using the image subtraction technique to create difference images ( alard & lupton 1998 ; bramich 2008 ; bramich et al .",
    "photometry is performed on the difference images using point spread function ( psf ) fitting at the object positions with a spatially - variable psf model .",
    "the output of this difference image analysis ( dia ) is a set of object light curves in differential flux units ( adu / s ) .",
    "these light curves are converted to instrumental magnitudes using reference fluxes for each object as measured on the reference image .",
    "the photometric zero point for the reference image is determined using the ucac3 magnitudes and this is used to calibrate the light curve magnitudes on an absolute scale with a scatter of @xmath00.1  mag .",
    "the qes light curves are then stored in a data archive system and trend filtering algorithms are applied to them . however , since the application of trend filtering algorithms to variable star light curves risks distorting their shape , we opted to use the raw qes light curves from the archive ( i.e. before detrending is applied ) for the study of the variable stars in this paper .    with a typical photometric precision of @xmath01 - 2% over the magnitude range 8 - 14 , a high temporal cadence ( @xmath010  min ) sustained over @xmath02 - 7 hours in each 24-hour period , and a time baseline of @xmath03 - 4 months",
    ", the qes light - curve archive is a potential gold mine for variability studies . as part of realising the full scientific potential of qes ,",
    "we have started to investigate the variable star content of the archive .",
    "this short paper is the first in a series reporting our results .",
    "here we investigate known rr lyrae variables .",
    "we cross - matched ucac3 with the 47969 variable stars in the general catalogue of variable stars ( gcvs4 - version 30/04/2013 ; samus et al .",
    "2009 ) using the cds x - match service .",
    "the cross - match algorithm simply selects any gcvs star entries within a 5 radius of any ucac3 star .",
    "this resulted in 43009 matched entries , of which 42973 are unique . retaining only the unique matches and filtering for variable star type",
    ", we obtained 6921 ucac3 stars classified as rr lyrae variables .",
    "we then searched in the qes light - curve archive for these ucac3 rr lyrae stars and found that we had observed 752 objects in this list .",
    "we note that any object observed across multiple target fields and/or cameras will have multiple light curves in the qes archive .",
    "since our analysis requires a reasonable number of data points in each light curve , we rejected light curves with fewer than 100 data points .",
    "furthermore , due to the faint limit of the qes lying at @xmath017  mag , we rejected any objects with ucac3 aperture magnitudes fainter than 16.5 .",
    "we were left with 724 objects with 2220 light curves .",
    "we inspected plots of the phased ( using the gcvs periods where available ) and unphased light curves of our object sample . since rr lyrae variations have typical amplitudes of 0.1 - 1.3  mag , we could immediately identify 65 objects with multiple light curves where a subset of the light curves were not showing any variability .",
    "this occurs when the qes pipeline misidentifies an object and measures the wrong star , which tends to happen for relatively crowded objects towards the edge of a detector where camera distortions are not sufficiently well - modelled in the astrometric solution . for these cases we simply rejected the 143 light curves that failed to show the variations clearly visible in the remaining light curves for the same object .",
    "we also identified 136 objects for which none of their light curves showed variations above the noise level .",
    "we found that this was due either to the objects being very faint and therefore exhibiting a large scatter in their light curves , or to the object misidentification problem mentioned already .",
    "we rejected these objects from our sample , which left us with 588 photometrically variable objects with 1783 light curves .",
    "some variables in our data sample do not have gcvs period estimates and/or their gcvs classification as rr lyrae variables is uncertain or does not distinguish between fundamental mode and first overtone pulsators .",
    "hence our first step was to estimate the variable star periods using our light curve data .",
    "we applied the string - length method ( burke , rolland & boy 1970 ; dworetsky 1983 ) to each of the 1783 light curves in our sample to search for periods in the range 0.1 - 500  d. for variables with multiple light curves , we adopted the period derived from the light curve with the best combination of the longest time span , the smallest noise , and the most data points ( all light curve plots in this paper display this `` best '' light curve for clarity ) .",
    "we then phase - folded the light curves with our derived periods , and we checked the rr lyrae classification of our variables .    apart from being able to improve the gcvs periods and classifications for a large number of variable stars , we also found that some variables in our data sample are not rr lyrae stars .",
    "consequently we have reclassified these stars using the gcvs classification system described in samus et al .",
    "( 2009 ) . to aid in our reclassification efforts",
    ", we searched the literature for previous studies of some of these variables .",
    "however , a full literature search for all of the variables in our data sample is outside of the scope of this paper , the purpose of which is to provide a set of concrete updates to the latest version of the gcvs .",
    "therefore we can not claim that all of our results are guaranteed to be new although we are sure that the majority of the information presented in this paper has not previously been reported in the literature .    before reporting our results , we mention that due to the coarse pixel scale of the qes camera system ( 9.26 and 4.64  arcsec / pixel for the 200 and 400  mm lenses , respectively ) , a relatively high proportion of the variable stars in our sample are likely to be blended with another star . hence the reference flux for such blended variables as measured on the reference image",
    "is systematically over - estimated which leads to artificially small amplitudes of variation in the corresponding light curves .",
    "therefore , the amplitudes of our variable star light curves may be systematically too small in a number of cases when compared to light curves derived from higher resolution imaging data .      in table  1 , we report the reclassification of 21 variable stars .",
    "our period estimates improve on the gcvs periods in all cases .",
    "we reclassify 14 of these variables as eclipsing binaries , where 13 of these are of the w ursae majoris - type .",
    "we plot the phased light curves of the eclipsing binaries in figure  1 using the best light curve for each variable .",
    "four eclipsing binaries ( 3uc191 - 025421 , 3uc192 - 006598 , 3uc247 - 041882 and 3uc308 - 105518 ) clearly show the oconnell effect in our data , which is characterised by two maxima of different brightnesses ( oconnell 1951 ) .",
    "we find that the variable star 3uc205 - 101683 , which is listed in the gcvs as an rr lyrae star of unknown sub - type , is a known double - lined spectroscopic binary ( mathieu et al .",
    "2003 ) showing x - ray emission ( belloni , verbunt & mathieu 1998 ) and classed as an rs canum venaticorum - type variable ( van den berg et al .",
    "we have updated the record for this star in table 1 , quoting the period derived from our best light curve spanning @xmath0154 days , which is more precise than the photometric periods quoted in the literature .",
    "the phased light curve for this star is shown in figure  2 .",
    "we note that the slight variations in the light curve shape and amplitude reported by van den berg et al .",
    "( 2002 ) are also detected in our light curve .",
    "the variable star 3uc171 - 023140 is a herbig ae / be star of spectral type b9e ( vieira et al .",
    "2003 ) that exhibits irregular light variations ( see figure  3 ; bernhard 2010 ) .",
    "we were unable to find periodicity in our light curves for this object .",
    "hence we reclassify this star as an irregular variable of early spectral type in table  1 .",
    "we found that four of the variable stars in our sample are most likely classical cepheids as opposed to rr lyrae stars .",
    "our new classifications for two of these stars ( 3uc208 - 318430 and 3uc225 - 131002 ) are based only on the period and the shape of the phased light curve ( see figure  4 ) , which does not definitively distinguish them from other variable types in their period range .",
    "hence our classifications for these two stars are tentative and marked with a colon `` : '' in table  1 .",
    "the variable star 3uc237 - 053427 was originally classified as a classical cepheid by schmidt & gross ( 1990 ) and we confirm that it is most likely pulsating in the first overtone mode as indicated by its smaller pulsation amplitude and relatively symmetric phased light curve .",
    "the variable star 3uc268 - 064903 has also already been classified as a classical cepheid by wils , lloyd & bernhard ( 2006 ) .",
    "we also noticed that the variable star 3uc237 - 121450 has an unusually long period for an rr lyrae .",
    "a literature search revealed that wallerstein , kovtyukh & andrievsky ( 2009 ) found this star to be carbon - rich and of relatively high metallicity .",
    "these facts lead andrievsky et al .",
    "( 2010 ) to suggest that 3uc237 - 121450 is more likely to be a short - period type ii cepheid ( or bl her type variable ) .",
    "we adopt this tentative classification for this star in table 1 and display the phased light curve in figure 5 ."
