    "most ecosystems are under considerable stress , having been perturbed by human intrusions including , population reduction or complete species annihilation , the introduction of foreign species , habitat destruction or fragmentation , contamination , and general global warming .",
    "we are now witnessing one of the highest rates of species disappearance and ecosystem collapse over the entire history of life on earth .",
    "fortunately , ecosystems can often recover from perturbations and can even evolve and adapt to new boundary conditions ( norberg et al . , 2001 ) .",
    "however , successful recovery depends on the inherent stability of the system , which is a complex function of the individual interactions among all the participating species and among species and their environment .",
    "given that typical ecosystems contain over 3000 species ( polis , 1991 ) , understanding the nature of this stability , and thus predicting ecosystem response to perturbation , is far from trivial , but indispensable for obtaining a quantitative understanding of ecosystem dynamics .",
    "predicting ecosystem response to perturbation is , therefore , one of the most scientifically taxing yet important questions of our time .",
    "present ecosystem dynamics theory is based on empirically inspired but essentially ad hoc equations incorporating one - body parameters , such as inherent birth and death rates , and two - body effects of one species population on another through coefficients representing competition , predator - prey , symbiosis , or neutral interaction , as well as species - environment effects , incorporated through parameters such as the `` carrying capacity '' .",
    "this two - body `` community matrix '' approach , although widely recognized for its usefulness in revealing the general spectrum of the dynamics of model ecosystems ( may , 1974 ) , has had little application to predicting real ecosystem response to perturbation .",
    "this is primarily due to the fact that the dynamical equations are ad hoc _ _  _ _ and that the community matrix is obtained from fits to time - series population data , and therefore can be expected to be representative of nature only within the limited range of the available population data .",
    "a further problem debilitating the community matrix approach is that it is a two - body approach while species interactions are really of a many - body nature .",
    "these many - body effects are usually absorbed within so called `` environmental factors '' which are included in the dynamical equations as fitted constants .",
    "however , these `` constants '' are not really constant for perturbed ecosystems and anyhow fail to endow the resultant 2-body equations with the true dynamics of inherently many - body natural ecosystems .    a clear indication of the failure of traditional theory is the fact that today s ecosystem health is usually surmised by making painstaking field counts of the populations of particular species and then , rather arbitrarily , deciding whether or not to include those species on an `` in danger of extinction '' list .",
    "such one dimensional and last minute vigilance of ecosystems is not satisfactory for a number of reasons : first , it fails to treat the ecosystem as an integrated whole and could thereby miscalculate the gravity of the situation about to unfold ; second , since many ecosystems have a natural cyclical , or even chaotic , but stable dynamics , it may be difficult to distinguish normal , but stable , periodic or chaotic behavior from a dangerous fall toward extinction ; third , our human perspective tends to focus on species in which the individuals are physically large , easily observable , or likable , but not necessarily those key species that are most important to the stability of an ecosystem .",
    "most important , however , is the fact that present ecosystem theory provides no information for designing an integral solution for arresting an impending catastrophe , other than , perhaps , suggesting that the endangered specie be protected by law .",
    "there is clearly a need for a more quantitative approach to population modeling based on fundamental science and measurements that can predict ecosystem dynamics for regions in population space for which no data exists .",
    "there has been a growing realization that such a quantitative theory of ecosystems will have a thermodynamic basis ( odum , 1969 , gallucci , 1973 , swenson , 1989 , michaelian , 2005 ) .",
    "the reasons are compelling : first , thermodynamic laws derive from symmetry principles inherent in nature and thus are universal , applicable in suitable form to all macroscopic systems and processes , irrespective of the types of interactions involved .",
    "second , thermodynamics deals with a much reduced set of macroscopic variables which can be related with measurable ecosystem variables ( e.g. populations ) involved in the dynamical patterns observed in nature .",
    "third , a number of stubborn problems and paradoxes existing in traditional ecosystem theory appear to have a simple resolution in terms of thermodynamic directives ( swenson , 1989 , michaelian , 2005 ) .",
    "the objective of this paper is to demonstrate that , for ecosystems under constant boundary conditions , a non - equilibrium thermodynamic framework for the population dynamics can lead to explicit predictions concerning ecosystem response to perturbation .    in the following section we briefly outline the thermodynamic framework for treating ecosystems which has been presented elsewhere ( michaelian , 2005 ) . in section 3",
    "we present a simple model ecosystem and demonstrate how its population dynamics and stability characteristics are determined by thermodynamic constraints and criteria relating to energy , work , and mass flow among the species populations , and with the external environment . in section 4",
    "we perturb this ecosystem and analyze the response as predicated on the basis of non - equilibrium thermodynamic formalism . finally ,",
    "in section 5 , we discuss how our thermodynamic framework may have relevance in explaining the particular population dynamics observed in a real ecosystem ; the outbreak of sustained population oscillations of the southern pine beetle .",
    "to avoid misinterpretation , it is prudent to first make a clear distinction between two existing but fundamentally different thermodynamic frameworks . _ equilibrium thermodynamics _ deals with isolated systems and the fundamental state variable governing the evolution of the isolated system toward the stable _ equilibrium _ state is the total entropy , @xmath0 .",
    "_ irreversible thermodynamics _ deals with open systems or processes , such as ecosystems , which exchange energy , work , and mass between component parts and with the environment . here , the variable governing the evolution toward the stable _ stationary _ state ( for constant boundary conditions ) is the time variation of the total entropy of the system , @xmath1 .",
    "our framework is based on the latter _",
    "irreversible thermodynamics _ and we employ only that part of this framework , known as _ classical _ , developed by lars onsager ( onsager , 1931 ) and illya prigogine ( prigogine , 1967 ) that has been verified empirically .    as for any open system , the time variation of the total entropy of the ecosystem may be divided into a part due to the internal entropy production arising from irreversible processes occurring within the ecosystem itself , and a second part due to the flow of entropy into , or out of , the ecosystem from the external environment ( prigogine , 1967 ) , @xmath2    all macroscopic systems and processes , including ecosystems , are subject to definite thermodynamic law .",
    "the primary among these is the second law of thermodynamics which states that the internal production of entropy due to irreversible processes occurring within the system must be positive definite , @xmath3    for the case of ecosystems under the condition of constant external constraints ( see ( michaelian , 2005 ) for justification of this condition for a large class of ecosystems ) classical irreversible thermodynamic theory states ( prigogine , 1967 ) that the system will eventually arrive at a thermodynamic _ stationary state _ in which all macroscopic variables , including the total entropy , are stationary in time , @xmath4 therefore , from ( [ eq : dsdt ] ) , at the stationary state , @xmath5 implying from eq .",
    "( [ eq:2ndlaw ] ) that @xmath6 maintaining an ecosystem in a stable thermodynamic stationary state thus requires a continuous negative flow of entropy into the system .",
    "this has already been emphasized by schrdinger ( schrdinger , 1944 ) , but was first recognized by boltzmann ( boltzmann , 1886 ) .",
    "the internal entropy production @xmath7 can be written as a sum of generalized thermodynamic forces @xmath8 multiplied by generalized thermodynamic flows @xmath9 ( prigogine , 1967 ) ( for example , @xmath10 @xmath11gradient of the inverse temperature , and @xmath12 heat flow ) , @xmath13 the separation of the entropy production into its components of thermodynamic forces and flows is somewhat arbitrary and can often be chosen for convenience in resolving the particular problem at hand . however , there are a number of conditions that must be met for any particular choice .",
    "the first condition is that the product of the force and flow gives units of entropy production , and the second is that symmetry aspects must be respected , for example , a scaler force can not give rise to a vector flow ( katchalsky and curran , 1975 ) .",
    "we have shown ( michaelian , 2005 ) that ecosystem dynamics can be treated consistently within this irreversible thermodynamic framework by assigning the generalized thermodynamic forces to the species populations ( @xmath14 ) ( where @xmath15 represents the species type ) and the generalized flows to the flows of entropy ( @xmath16 ) ( due to flows of energy , work , or mass , to or from species @xmath15 , see below ) .    within this framework ,",
    "it was shown ( michaelian , 2005 ) that the ecological steady state , prevalent in nature ( goldwasser & roghgarden , 1993 ; polis , 1991 ) , has the stability characteristics of the thermodynamic stationary state . in view of this",
    ", we have made the formal assertion that the ecological steady state is just a particular case of the more general thermodynamic stationary state ( michaelian , 2005 ) .    a further criterion from classical irreversible thermodynamic theory , considered by prigogine as the most general result of irreversible thermodynamic theory , and valid for constant external constraints ,",
    "is that the rate of change of the internal entropy production , due to changes in the generalized forces @xmath8 ( the populations ) , is negative semi - definite ; the _ general evolutionary criterium _",
    "( prigogine 1967 ) , @xmath17 equation ( [ eq : dxpdt ] ) implies that , under constant boundary conditions , all natural changes in the species populations must be in such a manner so as to reduce the internal production of entropy .",
    "this is a powerful auxiliary criterion on ecosystem response to perturbation and it will be shown below that this , together with the second law of thermodynamics , and the fact that a system with constant external constraints must arrive at a thermodynamic stationary state , effectively determines the population dynamics that the ecosystem can assume .",
    "in this way , we can predict the actual dynamic response of the ecosystem to perturbation , be it either toward recovery , toward a new dynamics , or toward extinction .",
    "we now present our thermodynamic framework for an over simplified but illustrative 3-species model ecosystem , including up to 3-body interaction terms .",
    "two of the populations , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , are considered variable , while the third , @xmath20 , is fixed , and represents the constant boundary conditions over the ecosystem ; such as the constant supply of nutrients due to a primary producer species .",
    "for example , in our application to the pine beetle ecosystem , to be detailed in the section 5 , @xmath20 would represent the approximately constant population of the pine trees vulnerable to infection ; @xmath18 will be taken as the population of the southern pine beetle ; and @xmath19 that of its most important natural predator , the clerid beetle _",
    "thanasimus dubius_.    the total entropy brought into the ecosystem or carried out of it through one - body transport processes can be written as ( michaelian , 2005 ) , @xmath21 where the sum is over all @xmath22 species and @xmath23 is the population of species @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath24 represents the average rate of exchange , or flow , of entropy with the external environment per individual per unit time of species @xmath25 as a result of energy ( including heat ) , work , or matter flow ( see below ) .",

    "the 4-body and higher order n - body terms will be neglected in what follows since they would normally be small as they require increasingly improbable ( except for social species ) n - body localization in space and time .",
    "equation ( [ eq : dxpdt ] ) , the general evolutionary criterium , for the time change in the entropy production due to a change in the generalized forces @xmath32 ( the populations ) then becomes @xmath33 \\le 0 .",

    "the @xmath34 s represent entropy production and flow between individuals of the species and between individuals and their environment .",
    "a general expression for this entropy flow comes from the gibb s equation and results from the flow of energy , work , and matter ( prigogine 1967 ) .",
    "for example , the energy per individual per unit time taken in through photosynthesis @xmath35 , or the heat @xmath36 per individual per unit time transported to the external environment , the work done on the environment per unit time @xmath37 at constant pressure @xmath38 , and the matter components ( e.g .. nutrients ) of type @xmath39 taken in or given out by species @xmath15 , @xmath40 , of chemical potential @xmath41 , give for the rate of entropy exchange per individual with the environment , @xmath42 where the temperature @xmath43 ( of the participating individuals ) may be approximated as being constant for the ecosystem ( gallucci , 1973 ) .",
    "a similar expression can be written for the @xmath44 , representing the entropy production and exchange between individuals of species @xmath15 and @xmath45 , i.e. in terms of the energy , work , and matter exchanged due to the 2-body interactions between individuals of the species .",
    "the affect on the entropy flows due to a simultaneous interaction of a third individual ( three - body effects ) of species @xmath46 is considered in the parameter @xmath47    determining the @xmath34 s for a real ecosystem therefore requires the determination of the flows of energy @xmath48 , heat @xmath49 , volume @xmath50 , and mass @xmath51 of type @xmath39 between individuals of the participating species and between individuals and the external environment .",
    "such a determination is possible in principle but obviously difficult in practice",
    ". some of the experimental details for obtaining these types of flow measurements between the individuals , and between the individuals and their environment , can be found in ( gallucci , 1973 ) and references therein .",
    "we have outlined the empirical determination of the entropy production coefficient @xmath27 for a plant ( hernndez , 2008 , hernndez and michaelian , 2008 ) .",
    "the entropy exchange between individual animals @xmath52 is more difficult to measure .",
    "however , since much of the entropy flow between individuals is directly related to their diet , it is plausible , for example , that values for the @xmath52 may one day be obtained through a chemical analysis of the dna of the excrement of individuals .",
    "similar analyses have in fact been performed for real ecosystems , however , with the focus on energy flow ( see for example , homer et al . , 1976 ) .",
    "in the absence of real ecosystem data concerning the production of entropy and the exchange of entropy , here we generate these coefficients @xmath34 for a model ecosystem subject to thermodynamic law with the aid of a genetic algorithm ( michaelian , 1998 ) .",
    "the algorithm begins by randomly generating sets of initial values for the @xmath34 s within fixed ranges .",
    "the algorithm then evaluates the fitness of each set by checking to see if the population dynamics , as determined by criteria ( [ eq : disdt ] ) and ( [ eq : dxp ] ) , leads to a viable stationary state in the long time limit , i.e. one with @xmath53 ( as required by classical irreversible thermodynamics for constant external constraints , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : desdis ] ) ) and with @xmath7 large and positive ( consistent with what is known about the natural evolution of biotic systems to ever higher entropy production regimes ( see prigogine , 1967 ) ) .",

    "( [ eq : disdt ] ) and ( [ eq : dxp ] ) , leads to the stable cyclic attractor ( oscillating ) population dynamics as shown in figure [ fig : ca ] .",

    "( [ eq : desdis ] ) , are shown in figure [ fig : ca ] .",
    "this stationary state , for the particular set of @xmath34 s obtained , is a cyclic attractor .",
    "the first perturbation , affected at time @xmath62 by reducing the population of @xmath18 to @xmath63 can be seen to have little effect on the ecosystem , a full recovery of the populations is obtained rapidly .",
    "the second perturbation affected by increasing the population of @xmath18 to @xmath64 at time @xmath65 also produces only a small transient effect .",
    "however , if the ecosystem is perturbed in the same manner but at time @xmath66 , population @xmath18 goes negative ( as does the internal production of entropy @xmath7 ) implying the extinction of the species and the non - viability , thermodynamically , of the ecosystem .",
    "the timing of a perturbation affected on an ecosystem with cyclic attractor population dynamics therefore appears to be crucial in deciding the fate of the ecosystem .",
    "similar results are obtained if population @xmath19 is perturbed .",
    "a perturbation of the ecosystem at time @xmath67 by increasing population @xmath19 to @xmath68 has no long term consequences .",
    "however , when population @xmath19 is reduced to @xmath69 at time @xmath70 , the internal production of entropy and the population @xmath18 both go negative , the ecosystem again becomes untenable .",
    "figure [ fig : p1p2 ] plots the dynamics of the ecosystem in population space @xmath71 for 50 different initial populations .",
    "it is apparent from this figure that the recovery or not of an ecosystem from a particular perturbation depends on the region in population space into which the ecosystem is perturbed .",
    "perturbation into the `` regions of danger '' marked on the figure leads to either one of the populations going negative , or to the internal production of entropy going negative .",
    "both of these results are non physical and would foretell the collapse of the ecosystem in nature .",
    "interestingly , these regions of danger do not necessarily correspond to regions of small population .",
    "we next examine the response of our model ecosystem to permanent changes in the boundary conditions .",
    "figure [ fig : pa1 ] shows the ecosystem dynamics under new boundary conditions of @xmath20 reduced to @xmath72 , down from its originally fixed value of @xmath73 , implying a less negative flow of entropy into the ecosystem . without allowing time for the interaction coefficients @xmath34 to evolve in response to the new boundary conditions ,",
    "the cyclic attractor then becomes a point attractor as shown in figure [ fig : pa1 ] .",
    "however , as can be seen from this figure , the point attractor is not a thermodynamic stationary state since the internal production of entropy is no longer equal to the negative of the external flow of entropy ( equation ( [ eq : desdis ] ) is no longer satisfied ) .",
    "the ecosystem fitness function , eq .. ( [ eq : fitness ] ) , is no longer at a local maximum value and the system , given time , would evolve its entropy production and exchange coefficients ( the set @xmath34 ) until reaching a new stationary state where the production and external flow of entropy are once again equal .",
    "note that in the perturbed state with the new external constraint , @xmath74 the same small perturbation of reducing the population @xmath18 to 40 at time @xmath62 , which did not have any lasting affect on the ecosystem previously ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ca ] ) , now results in the collapse of the ecosystem since it moves it into the non - physical , thermodynamically prohibited , regime of negative internal entropy production ( figure [ fig : pa1 ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : ca4 ] shows the opposite effect of increasing the flow of negative entropy into the ecosystem , obtained by increasing the value of the fixed external condition to @xmath75 . without allowing time for the interaction coefficients @xmath34 to evolve , the dynamics",
    "remains that of a cyclic attractor but the orbit of the attractor increases significantly , bringing the population @xmath18 very close to zero at one point in its orbit .",
    "a slight perturbation of population @xmath19 at time @xmath62 is sufficient to cause the population @xmath18 to pass through zero and thereby cause the collapse of the ecosystem .",
    "we believe that this is a possible thermodynamic explanation of the `` enrichment paradox''(rosenzweig , 1971 ) ; contrary to naive expectation , an increase in the inflow of nutrients is often observed to make an ecosystem more vulnerable to perturbation .",
    "this will be considered in detail in a forthcoming paper ( alonso , 2007 ) .",
    "we have also verified ( alonso , 2007 ) that had the set of @xmath34 s been chosen such that the thermodynamic stationary state corresponded to a point attractor in population space ( sometimes referred to as an _ equilibrium state _ in the ecological literature ) , then increasing the value of the fixed external condition @xmath20 leads to population oscillations of @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "this may have relevance to the sudden outbreak of large population oscillations of certain insect pathogens , such as the southern pine beetle , as described in the following section .",
    "the southern pine beetle , indigenous to the southern and south eastern states of the united states and to the northern parts of mexico , is one of the pathogens of most concern to humans as it can severely affect the economic value of a forest stand .",
    "its population dynamics often exhibits infestation outbreaks of an oscillatory nature .",
    "this dynamics has been extensively studied with a view to understanding its origin and thereby to controlling the pest ( turchin et al . , 1999 ) . in the wild state of natural forests ,",
    "the pine beetle populations are small and relatively constant and the insect may be considered as an integral component of a robust ecosystem , even helping to promote normal ecosystem succession ( natural resources canada , 2003 ) .",
    "however , the last century has seen an almost complete replacement of the natural mixed forest stands with homogeneous stands of particular species of greater economic value to humans , such as soft wood pine .",
    "this has led to forests more vulnerable to pine beetle attack with the result that millions of hectors of pine trees can be devastated by a single beetle outbreak ( aukema et al . , 2008 ) .",
    "the outbreak is often preceded by a debilitating event affecting the forest such as a drought , fire , or flood ( mcnulty et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "the details surrounding an outbreak of a sustained pine beetle attack are well known .",
    "normally the pine beetle population is relatively small and constant with the beetle preying only on the vulnerable weaker trees of a stand .",
    "the vulnerable pine trees provide nourishment and protection for the pine beetle which buries under the inner bark of the tree to deposit its eggs in bored out gallerias .",
    "the beetles carry a fungus which quickly establishes itself within the tree and spreads out to cut off the water and nutrient irrigation of the tree .",
    "the vulnerable tree normally dies within a year of first attack .",
    "healthy trees efficiently repel the pine beetle attack by emitting enough resin in the beetle galleries to dissuade further colonization ( blinka , 2007 ) and induce beetle mortality through a number of effects including crystallization of the sap around beetle larva .    unlike vulnerable pine trees , healthy pine trees , therefore ,",
    "can not normally be considered as contributing to the primary host species of the pine beetle .",
    "if , however , there occurs a debilitating event , such that the density of vulnerable pine trees in a given area becomes great enough , then the local population of pine beetles may swell to such a point that there is now a large enough number of beetles on each tree ( @xmath76m@xmath77 that even the healthy trees can not cope and become vulnerable ( blinka , 2007 ) .",
    "it has long been debated as to whether exogenous ( originating externally ) or endogenous ( originating from within ) factors contribute most to the observed population oscillations of the pine beetle .",
    "turchin ( turchin , 2003 ) has argued for a synthetic approach , suggesting that both enogenous and endogenous factors can be important .",
    "for example , while it is known that particularly cold winters can reduce and even end an outbreak , otherwise very little correlation of climate on population dynamics has been found ( turchin et al .",
    "this fact has lead to a search for possible endogenous effects to explain oscillations in the population density of the pine beetle .    one endogenous effect studied by turchin et al .",
    "is a time delay in density - dependent affect of a predator on the pine beetle .",
    "the effect of introducing a time delay into the normally stabilizing density dependent terms of lotka - volterra type equations was first studied theoretically by may ( 1974 ) for the systems of vegetation - herbivore , and vegetation - herbivore - predator . for the vegetation - herbivore system , may found that a time delay in the normally stabilizing density term of the logistic equation could lead to limit cycles ( stable population oscillations ) if the characteristic growth rate of the herbivore was small compared to the time delay in the regulatory mechanism ( stabilizing term of the logistic equation related to the density of the herbivore ) .",
    "when a predator was included to prey on the herbivore , may found it much more difficult to obtain oscillatory solutions to the model equations .",
    "nevertheless , through carefully controlled field experiments , turchin et al .",
    "( 1999 ) verified that there indeed exists a delayed density - dependent affect of predators on the pine beetle which could thus contribute to the population oscillations .",
    "the essence of the pine beetle ecosystem can be reduced to three strongly interacting species ; the primary production species ( the vulnerable pine tree ) , the herbivore ( the pine beetle itself ) and a predator species ( the clerid beetle , the most important natural predator of the pine beetle ) .",
    "this reduction of the ecosystem to only three species is convenient ( but not necessary ) to demonstrate how our formalism , based on the application of general thermodynamic criteria concerning entropy production and exchange , can describe the dynamics of the pine beetle ecosystem .    in section [ response ]",
    "we have shown that if the interactions ( exchange and production of entropy ) between individuals of the different species of an ecosystem is of n - body nature ( including higher than 2-body terms ) then a stable point attractor or stable limit cycle dynamics can be obtained after the system relaxes to its thermodynamic stationary state ( see figure [ fig : ca1 ] ) .",
    "consider now such a stable ecosystem in its stationary state , being either a point attractor or stable limit cycle in population space .",
    "the initial constant boundary conditions for this ecosystem correspond to that segment @xmath20 of the total population of pine trees within a given area that are vulnerable to attack while the ecosystem is enjoying normal , stable conditions . if the population @xmath20 of the vulnerable trees then increases suddenly due to a debilitating event affecting the forest , then the beetle population @xmath18 and the clerid beetle predator population @xmath19 start to oscillate with potentially much greater amplitude ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ca4 ] ) .    the interaction ( production and exchange of entropy ) of the pine beetles with the pine trees and its predator is non - linear in their respective populations and the physical restrictions on the total entropy production ( the 2nd law ) and on the sign of the rate of change of the production of entropy ( prigogine s general evolution criterium ) together force this oscillatory population dynamics . however , this is a perturbed ecosystem , one which is no longer in a thermodynamic stationary state , as could be verified in the field by demonstrating that the production of positive entropy has temporarily increased and is no longer equal to that of the inflow of negative entropy ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : desdis ] and figure [ fig : ca4 ] ) .",
    "this explanation of the population oscillations is in accord with the following known facts regarding pine beetle population dynamics ; 1 ) the pine beetle populations are not always oscillating but can be relatively constant in healthy forest stands , 2 ) oscillations usually begin after a particular debilitating event which causes a rapid increase in the number of vulnerable trees , the primary resource available to the beetle , 3 ) the amplitude of the population oscillations are correlated with the _ increase _ in the amount of vulnerable trees in a given area , or , in other words , to the density of nominally healthy pine trees in the area , 4 ) it is known that perturbed ecosystems ( including diseased systems ) have temporarily increased total entropy production ( schneider and sagan , 2005 ) , 5 ) it is contingent on both exogenous ( debilitating events ) and endogenous ( thermodynamic laws ) factors .",
    "the results presented above suggest a possible means for controlling a pine beetle outbreak .",
    "figure [ fig : p1p2 ] shows that there are regions in population space for which perturbation into these regions leads to eventual collapse of the ecosystem .",
    "once the entropy flow coefficients @xmath34 have been determined , the thermodynamic formalism presented here determines these regions of danger .",
    "it is then only a matter of perturbing one of the populations into these regions of danger to obtain the desired extinction of the outbreak .",
    "this could be obtained by augmenting , or reducing , the population of one of the involved species at the indicated point in the population cycle .",
    "acknowledging that ecosystems , like all macroscopic processes , are subject to definite thermodynamic law , we have demonstrated that under constant external constraints , the response of ecosystems to perturbation can , in principle , be predicted .",
    "the thermodynamic criteria which direct the dynamics come from non - equilibrium thermodynamic theory .",
    "they are ; 1 ) the system must eventually arrive at a thermodynamic stationary state , eq .",
    "( [ eq : desdis ] ) , 2 ) the internal production of entropy must be positive definite , in accord with the second law of thermodynamics , eq .",
    "( [ eq:2ndlaw ] ) , and 3 ) any natural change in the populations must be in such a manner so as to reduce the internal production of entropy of the entire system , prigogine s general evolution criterion , eq .",
    "( [ eq : dxpdt ] ) .    in the absence of data on the entropy production and exchange of real ecosystems",
    ", we considered a simple model ecosystem generated by evolving interaction coefficients ( representing entropy production and exchange ) through selection with a fitness function favoring the thermodynamic criteria identified above .",
    "we then studied the response of this model ecosystem to perturbation of the populations under the same thermodynamic criteria .",
    "we found that there exists regions in population space for which perturbation into these regions leads to the eventual extinction of one or more of the species , or to a negative internal production of entropy .",
    "the latter violates the second law of thermodynamics and would lead to ecosystem collapse since physical maintenance processes require positive production of entropy .",
    "an important finding is that these regions in population space are a general feature of the thermodynamic framework and do not necessarily correspond to regions of small population . assigning species to `` in danger of extinction '' lists , solely on the basis of the smallness of their populations",
    "may therefore not be an effective conservation policy .",
    "our proposed approach , based on thermodynamic criteria , predicts the dynamics over all of population space and thus leads to quantitative elements for providing more informed policy statements for responding to ecosystem perturbation .",
    "increasing or decreasing the negative flow of entropy ( natural resources ) into the ecosystem has the effect of increasing or decreasing respectively both the amplitude of the orbit of the attractor in population space and the internal production of entropy of the system . in either case , this results in a more vulnerable ecosystem since the populations pass closer to zero or the internal production of entropy may more easily become negative respectively .",
    "we believe that this result is a thermodynamic explanation of the `` enrichment paradox '' .",
    "we applied our thermodynamic framework to a reduced ecosystem consisting of the southern pine beetle , pine trees , and the beetles most important predator .",
    "we have shown that the population oscillation of the southern pine beetle may be viewed within this thermodynamic framework as resulting from an increase in the inflow of resources ( negative entropy ) into a system which has a non - linear dependence of the production and flow of entropy on the species populations .",
    "our thermodynamic description is contingent on the initial conditions known to precede an attack ( the increase in the density of the vulnerable trees ) , predicts pine beetle population oscillations for perturbed ecosystems , and predicts constant ( or small amplitude oscillations ) populations for unperturbed ecosystems .",
    "the model is consistent with the synthetic view that oscillations of the pine beetle populations are a result of both exogenous factors ( the initial debilitating event causing an increase in the number of vulnerable pine trees ) and endogenous factors ( thermodynamic laws and non - linear coupling of entropy flows ) .",
    "we proposed a method of control of the pine beetle by first delimiting these regions of danger , and then perturbing the populations into these regions .",
    "ecosystems are composed of many thousands of interacting species and the details of the dynamics is , undoubtedly , significantly more complicated .",
    "however , our thermodynamic framework can be straightforwardly applied to a much larger and more complex ecosystem simply by measuring all the entropy production and exchange coefficients @xmath34 for all the species involved .",
    "work in this direction is underway ( hernndez , 2008 ) .    in conclusion , as for all macroscopic process ,",
    "ecosystems are subject to definite thermodynamic law . for constant external constraints ,",
    "these laws are sufficient to determine ecosystem response to perturbation .",
    "our analysis of the population dynamics based on thermodynamic law and the formulation of the interaction coefficients in terms of physical and measurable quantities ( the production and exchange of entropy ) is a step toward a more quantitative theory of ecosystems .",
    "k.m . is grateful for the financial support of dgapa - unam project number in-118206 , and for financial assistance while on a 2007 sabbatical leave .",
    "the hospitality afforded during this leave by the faculty of science , universidad autonoma del estado de morelos , mexico , is greatly appreciated .",
    "the following set of species interaction ( entropy production and exchange ) coefficients ( see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : desdt ] ) and ( [ eq : disdt ] ) ) , for an @xmath22 species ecosystem and including up to 3-body terms , were used for calculating the dynamics of figures [ fig : ca ] to [ fig : ca4 ] ;       these coefficients were obtained by evolving various initial random sets of coefficients , selected from within a finite range , using a genetic algorithm with a fitness function favoring a stationary state , i.e. @xmath78 and @xmath7 large in the long - time limit , ( ie . at the stationary state ) .",
    "although our 3 species ecosystem is artificial , the coefficients have characteristics of what would be expected of a real ecosystem .",
    "for example , the coefficient of entropy flow with the external environment , @xmath79 , representing the fixed external constraints , is of large negative value .",
    "the one - body internal entropy production coefficients @xmath80 are all positive ( respecting the 2nd law of thermodynamics ) and of large value with respect to the 2- , and 3-body coefficients . the second law for the total internal entropy production , eq.([eq:2ndlaw ] ) , is also respected over a large region of population space ( see figure [ fig : p1p2 ] ) .",
