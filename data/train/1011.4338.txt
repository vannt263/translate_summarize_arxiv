    "it offers high resolution , typically of the order of @xmath1 m , which is achieved via the use of interferometry and the broad bandwidth of the optical source @xcite .    with the addition of transverse scanning",
    ", this range - finding technique provides cross - sectional images and is called optical coherence tomography ( oct ) @xcite . because oct has the merits of being a non - invasive , non - contact , high - resolution , and rapid procedure , it has revolutionized _ in vivo _ biological imaging @xcite .",
    "it has found widespread use in clinical medicine , particularly in the specialties of ophthalmology , gastroenterology , dermatology , laryngology , cardiology , and oncology @xcite .",
    "oct makes use of the second - order coherence properties of a classical optical source to effectively section a reflective or scattering sample with a resolution governed by the coherence length of the source .",
    "sources of short coherence length , with their attendant broad spectral width , provide high resolution .",
    "examples of optical sources used in oct include superluminescent diodes ( slds ) , ultrashort pulsed lasers , wavelength - swept lasers , supercontinuum sources such as photonic - crystal fibers @xcite , and wavelength - swept amplified - spontaneous - emission ( ase ) sources @xcite .",
    "oct can be carried out in a number of modalities , including time - domain , fourier - domain , swept - source , doppler , spectroscopic , and polarization - sensitive configurations ( ps - oct ) @xcite .",
    "this latter modality , in particular , reveals enhanced information about the birefringence properties of samples endowed with an organized linear structure @xcite , such as tissues containing a high content of collagen or other elastin fibers , including tendons , muscle , nerve , and cartilage @xcite .",
    "indeed , a change in birefringence can be indicative of a change in the functionality , integrity , or viability of biological tissue .",

    "imaging , for example , the retinal structure of interest is located behind the thick dispersive ocular medium .    to further improve the sensitivity of oct ,",
    "it is useful to implement techniques for handling dispersion .",
    "indeed , a whole host of techniques for mitigating its presence have been developed , ranging from the use of dispersion - compensating optical elements to _ a posteriori _ numerical methods .",
    "the use of many of these techniques , however , requires an understanding of the character of the dispersion inherent in the sample so that the appropriate optical element or numerical algorithm can be used @xcite .",

    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    over the past several decades , a number of nonclassical ( quantum ) sources of light have been developed  @xcite and it is natural to inquire whether making use of any of these sources might be advantageous for tomographic imaging .",
    "an example of such a nonclassical source is spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) @xcite , a nonlinear process that generates entangled twin beams of light .",
    "type - i and type - ii spdc interactions generate light with spectral / spatial and polarization entanglement , respectively @xcite@xcite .",
    "such sources , which are broadband , have been utilized to demonstrate a number of interference effects in physics that can not be observed using traditional classical sources of light ( * ? ? ? * as an example ) .",
    "it turns out that we are indeed able to make use of frequency - entangled twin photon pairs to construct a system that provides range measurements analogous to those obtained using classical oct , but with additional salutary nonclassical features .",
    "we refer to this scheme as quantum optical coherence tomography ( qoct ) .",

    "i qoct was first proposed in 2002  @xcite , and experimentally demonstrated as a quantum - imaging technique in 2003 and 2004  @xcite .",
    "three - dimensional qoct images of a biological sample , an onion - skin tissue coated with gold nanoparticles , were obtained more recently @xcite , confirming that qoct is a viable biological imaging technique .",
    "this also represented the first demonstration that a quantum - entangled entity could interact with a nonplanar , scattering , biological medium to generate a collection of quantum interferograms , which in turn could be used to construct a biological image .",
    "a particular merit of qoct , as indicated above , is that it is inherently immune to even - order group - velocity dispersion ( gvd )  @xcite imparted by the sample , by virtue of the frequency entanglement associated with the twin - photon pairs  @xcite .",
    "conventional oct , in contrast , is subject to gvd , which degrades resolution .",
    "moreover , for sources of the same bandwidth , the twin - photon entanglement endows qoct with a resolution enhancement of a factor of two in comparison with that achievable with oct  @xcite .",
    "in addition , qoct permits a direct determination of the gvd coefficients of the interstitial media between the reflecting surfaces of the sample  @xcite .",
    "a typical qoct scan comprises two classes of features .",
    "features in the first class carry the information that is most often sought in oct : the depth and reflectance of the layer surfaces that constitute the sample . in qoct , each of these features is associated with a reflection from a single surface and is _ immune _ to gvd .",
    "features in the second class arise from cross - interference between the reflection amplitudes associated with every pair of surfaces and _ are sensitive _ to the dispersion characteristics of the media between them .",
    "measurement of the broadening of a feature associated with two consecutive surfaces directly yields the gvd coefficient of the interstitial medium lying between them . in an oct scan ,",
    "in contrast , only a single class of features is observed ; each feature is associated with the reflection from a single surface and is subject to the cumulative dispersion of the portion of the sample lying above it .",
    "thus , gvd information is not directly accessible via oct ; to measure the gvd of a particular buried medium , it is necessary to consecutively compute the gvd of each of the constituent layers above it .",
    "the performance characteristics of a qoct system , such as its signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) and speed , are determined by a number of factors , including the optical power ( biphoton flux ) in the interferometer @xcite .",

    "this approach provides a means for obtaining information about the optical path length between isotropic reflecting surfaces , the relative magnitudes of the reflectances from each interface , the birefringence of the interstitial materials , and the orientation of the optical axes of the sample . as with its precursor ,",

    "the second experiment ( sec .  [ ssec : gvdfsec ] ) , conducted with pump pulses of fsec duration , illustrates the persistence of group - velocity dispersion when the pump pulses have insufficient duration .",

    "the interferogram is constructed from two separate scans because of operational problems with the ti : sapphire laser that prevented all of the data from being acquired in a single scan .",
    "though the experiment was not optimized , the interference dips resulting from the two interfaces are clearly evident .",
    "they are at the correct locations and are indeed separated by the optical path length of the sample , @xmath22 m , although they exhibit different visibilities because of alignment problems .    also , as expected , the cross - interference feature emerges midway between the dips .",
    "its width , in conjunction with those of the two interference dips , can be used to provide the gvd coefficients for the interstitial silica .    for multilayer samples it is worth emphasizing that the widths of the cross - interference terms are determined only by the dispersion of the medium residing between the two relevant reflective surfaces , and not by the nature of the material under which they are buried .",
    "furthermore , in the absence of prior information relating to the structure of the sample , interference features in the ps - qoct interferogram associated with reflections from individual surfaces may be confounded by the presence of cross - interference features associated with pairs of surfaces .",
    "these two classes of features may be readily distinguished , however , since slight variations of the pump frequency can be used to change the form of features in the second class ( e.g. , from dips to humps ) , whereas those in the first class are invariant to such variations . thus , dithering the pump frequency , for example , can serve to wash out the features in the second class , thereby leaving intact the desired dispersion - cancelled portion of the interferogram that reveals the axial structure of the sample @xcite .",
    "we expect that returns from scattering media would exhibit similar behavior because of the randomness of the relative phases associated with different surfaces . at the same time",
    ", simple subtraction of this pattern from the undithered version would allow the second class of features to be separated , thereby facilitating the determination of the gvd coefficients of the various media comprising the sample .",

    "it would be helpful to accommodate : 1 ) depletion of the probe beam  the assumption of an undepleted probe beam is widely used throughout the oct literature but the ability of ps - qoct to probe more deeply into tissue may make depletion more important ; 2 ) frequency- and polarization - dependent reflection coefficients at the boundaries ; 3 ) scattering and absorption at the boundaries and in the interstitial layers .",

    "we have illustrated the principal advantages that stem from the entanglement of the twin - photon source : dispersion cancellation , polarization sensitivity , and the ability to directly measure the dispersion characteristics of the interstitial media .",
