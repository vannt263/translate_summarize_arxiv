    "as we will show , we can create a ucycle packing by selecting only those subsets that avoid certain structure .",
    "we prove that there are asymptotically few such structured subsets .",
    "the general technique used to construct ucycles originated from @xcite .",
    "it consists of classifying the component subsets by their structure and ordering them accordingly .",
    "we write the @xmath3-subset @xmath0 of @xmath4 $ ] as @xmath46 , with @xmath47 , and define the _ form _ of @xmath0 as @xmath48 by @xmath49 , where indices are modulo @xmath3 and arithmetic is modulo @xmath1 .",

    "we consider the cyclic permutations of a form to be equivalent , so @xmath53 and @xmath54 can both serve as the form of @xmath51 .",
    "the choice of form has to do with how the form appears in the cycle .",
    "for example , the form @xmath55 makes the sets @xmath56 and @xmath57 appear as @xmath58 and @xmath59 , respectively .",
    "note that the last 2 in @xmath60 is not used for these sets , and so we may represent @xmath60 as @xmath61 , or more simply @xmath62 . in our techniques",
    "below , we will restrict our attention to forms @xmath63 having unique @xmath64 .",
    "in fact , we choose @xmath64 to be the largest unique entry .",
    "it is important to note that the method used here to construct the forms is somewhat limited . as part of our definition",
    ", every form has entries whose sum is @xmath1 .",
    "we call such forms _ simple_. however , it is possible to relax this condition .",
    "for example , the set @xmath65 would have the form @xmath66 .",
    "if we allow the sum of form entries to be a multiple of @xmath1 , we would have more freedom in representing the subsets , and hence a better method of constructing ucycles could be developed .",
    "these forms we define as _ crossing_. in this paper , we will only use simple forms .",
    "the purpose of the forms is to model what occurs in a ucycle , namely , that if @xmath67 appears in a ucycle then the forms @xmath68 and @xmath69 of the sets @xmath70 and @xmath71 overlap on @xmath72 .",
    "this motivates the following definitions .    for a given form rep .",

    "if we write the form @xmath83 as @xmath84 , then we would instead connect @xmath85 .",
    "since this form has no unique entry , this is left ambiguous .",
    "we call such forms _ bad_. we define all forms with at least one unique element , a clear representative , as _",
    "good_.    consider the previous example .",
    "we can ignore all bad forms of @xmath33 , and construct the transition graph , as shown in figure 2 .",
    ", height=192 ]    in this case , ignoring the bad forms yields an even transition graph . as stated in the following result , this is true for any connected transition graph .",
    "note , however , that it is not eulerian since @xmath86 is not connected .",
    "this problem disappears if we also ignore all such isolated cycles , as stated in the following result . as we will show , the number of such isolated cycles is negligible as @xmath42 .",
    "[ oldlem2]@xcite if @xmath87 is connected and there are no bad forms for @xmath3-subsets of @xmath4 $ ] , then @xmath76 is eulerian .",
    "we can construct a ucycle packing by ignoring such bad forms for any @xmath2 pair and restricting our attention to the largest component of @xmath76 , the component containing @xmath88 .",
    "in order to prove that a near ucycle packing is possible for any @xmath3 , we must show that an asymptotically large proportion of sets can be included in a ucycle . as we will show , the _ good sets _",
    ", those belonging to good forms , can easily be included in a ucycle packing , while the remaining _ bad sets _ can not .",
    "as we have indicated , we will only include good sets .",
    "of course , not all good sets can be included .",
    "it therefore remains to show that the good sets which can be included asymptotically outnumber all other sets , and that a ucycle packing that includes each of these sets can be created .",
    "consider the example of the @xmath37-ucs .",
    "we know that each form must have four entries , and , since each form is simple , the sum of these entries must be eight .",
    "the number of times each entry appears is also important , since the bad forms will have no entry appearing only once .",
    "therefore , we do not need all of its entries in order to determine whether or not a form is bad . we need only to know how many times each entry appears .",
    "for example , the form @xmath89 has the unordered _ pattern _ @xmath90 , essentially the list of multiplicities .",
    "as @xmath91 , a notation we will find useful later ] since this pattern contains a 1 as an entry , it has a unique element and therefore all forms with this _ good pattern _ are good . in this case",
    ", the pattern entries define a partition of @xmath92 , since each form has @xmath92 entries . in general , every pattern of an @xmath2-ucs is a partition of @xmath3 .",

    "clearly , @xmath94 for all @xmath95 , so there exists a corresponding good pattern @xmath96 .",
    "we define the function @xmath97 from the set of of good patterns to the set of bad patterns as @xmath98 .",
    "since this map applies to any bad pattern , we can see that @xmath99 .",
    "is equal to the number of partitions of @xmath100 , denoted @xmath101 .",
    "since @xmath102 , almost all patterns are good . ]    as we can see , many forms may belong to the same pattern .",
    "in fact , the forms belonging to a particular pattern satisfy the equation @xmath103 , for some positive integers @xmath104 , where @xmath105 are the pattern entries .",
    "however , this equation imposes no order on the solution , and thus does not distinguish between two different forms that share the same entries .",
    "we say that two such forms belong to the same _",
    "class_.    for example , the forms @xmath89 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 both share the class @xmath108 $ ] .",
    "by convention , we order the entries of a class from smallest to largest entry .",
    "as we know , the classes belonging to a pattern @xmath109 are all representations of @xmath1 as a positive distinct integer linear combination of @xmath110 .",
    "we count the classes with the aid of shur s theorem . for @xmath111 , define the function @xmath112    [ schur]@xcite suppose that @xmath113 , and define @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "then @xmath116    counting the classes requires a slightly more general result .",
    "namely , we want to extend schur s theorem as follows .",
    "we define @xmath117    [ genschur ] define @xmath118 , @xmath114 , and @xmath119 .",
    "then @xmath120    since all form entries are positive integers , we count only integer solutions to @xmath121 such that @xmath122 .",
    "this is equivalent to finding all integer solutions to the equation @xmath123",
    "@xmath124 @xmath125 , without the positivity constraint .",
    "we further modify the system to act for the condition @xmath126 . the equation @xmath127",
    "@xmath128 @xmath129 is the same as our original equation , and clearly @xmath130 .",
    "finally , we need to account for the fact that for a pattern of size @xmath131 , each corresponding class has exactly @xmath131 distinct entries .",
    "if , for example , @xmath132 , then @xmath133 $ ] is one possible class .",
    "however , @xmath134 $ ] , although it is a valid solution to @xmath135 , does not fulfill the requirement that @xmath136 for all @xmath137 .",
    "this is easily seen if we adopt the notation @xmath138 $ ] . written in this way ,",
    "@xmath139 = [ 1 ^ 2 3 ^ 1 5 ^ 1]$ ] and @xmath134 = [ 3 ^ 2 3 ^ 1 1 ^ 1]$ ] in the latter case , @xmath140 , so the class @xmath141 $ ] is not valid .",
    "therefore , we must account the number of such non - distinct solutions . if @xmath142 , then the equation reduces to @xmath143",
    "we can then apply schur s theorem to this equation as we did before . for the new system ,",
    "@xmath144 @xmath145 @xmath146 , so the total number of non - distinct solutions to this equation is @xmath147    in order to count the classes , we now apply lemma 8 to each pattern . we want to show that as @xmath1 gets large , a given bad pattern @xmath109 has far fewer classes than its good component @xmath148 .",
    "first , we must determine the size of @xmath149 for any pattern @xmath109 .    for any @xmath150 , we know that @xmath151@xmath152 for some @xmath153 , which is maximized when @xmath154 . if @xmath154 , then @xmath155@xmath156@xmath157 .",
    "thus @xmath158 . since each @xmath154 , we maximize the value of this expression when @xmath159 .",
    "thus , @xmath149@xmath160@xmath161 @xmath162 .    using this upper bound , we calculate that the number of classes belonging to a pattern @xmath109 is    @xmath163    with this application of schur s theorem , we can count the number of classes belonging to good patterns compared to the number of classes belonging to bad patterns as follows .",
    "@xmath164 that is , the good classes asymptotically outnumber the bad classes .",
    "it still remains to show that the number of forms of a bad class @xmath165 belonging to a bad pattern @xmath109 is no greater than the number of forms of a good class @xmath165 of @xmath148 .",
    "as we know , the forms of a class are all permutations of the class entries modulo cyclic rotation .",
    "therefore , each class @xmath166 has @xmath167 forms , while classes @xmath168 has @xmath169 forms .",
    "that is , the good forms outnumber the bad forms by a factor of @xmath170 .    finally , it remains to count the sets . by definition ,",
    "all good forms have at least one unique element .",
    "thus the good sets have at least one unique difference between two elements .",
    "this implies that every good form contains exactly @xmath1 sets .. ( symmetry can reduce the number of sets ; e.g. @xmath171 has forms @xmath172 , @xmath173 , and @xmath174 when @xmath175 . ) ] therefore , the number of sets per good form is at least the number of sets per bad form .    by counting the patterns , classes , forms and sets",
    ", one can see that almost every set is good .",
    "however , it remains to be shown that asymptotically many of these good sets can be arranged into a ucycle packing .",
    "we will use the following lemmas to prove that this is true , and therefore a near ucycle packing is always possible .",
    "[ even ] if @xmath76 is restricted to the good classes then it is a union of cycles , and hence even .    for a given class @xmath165 and transition graph @xmath76",
    ", we define the graph @xmath176 to be the restriction of @xmath76 to the edges belonging to the forms of @xmath165 .    if the class @xmath165 is good , then @xmath176 is a cycle or union of cycles .",
    "each form of @xmath165 has a unique representative @xmath177 , thus for any permutation @xmath60 of @xmath178 , all cyclic permutations of @xmath60 are also forms of @xmath165 . since @xmath176 is a union of cycles for each good @xmath165 , it is clear that @xmath76 restricted to the good classes will be a union of eulerian subgraphs , and is therefore even .    if the restriction of @xmath76 to good classes is connected , then it is eulerian .",
    "since the restriction of @xmath76 to good classes is a union of cycles , it is easily seen that if @xmath76 is connected , it is surely eulerian .    by the result in @xcite , if @xmath76 is eulerian , then an @xmath2-ucs exists .",
    "therefore , if we can show that the restriction of @xmath76 to good classes is connected , then it follows that a ucycle packing exists that includes all good sets . however , fig .",
    "2 demonstrates that this is not always the case .",
    "instead , we prove that an asymptotically large component is connected .",
    "since we have proven that @xmath7 sets are good , a ucycle packing that includes all good sets is a near - packing .      in order to study the components of the restriction of @xmath76 to good classes , we define the _ class graph _",
    ", denoted @xmath87 , as the undirected graph whose vertices are all classes of @xmath2-ucs .",
    "an edge is drawn between the class representations that differ by only one entry .",
    "for example , @xmath179 $ ] and @xmath180 $ ] are connected in @xmath181 .",
    "if @xmath182 and @xmath183 are connected in @xmath87 , then this means that @xmath184 and @xmath185 will also share vertices .",
    "for example , @xmath179 $ ] and @xmath180 $ ] are connected in @xmath181 , and correspond to the cycles @xmath186 and @xmath187    just because @xmath182 and @xmath183 are connected in @xmath188 , this does not guarantee that the union of @xmath184 and @xmath185 will be connected .",
    "it could happen , for example , that each @xmath189 has two components that connect , resulting in two components for @xmath190 .",

    "\\rightarrow \\   [ 1,1,2;6 ] \\",

    "we restrict our attention to the _",
    "awesome classes _ , the good classes whose largest singleton is greater than 1 . using schur s theorem",
    ", we can show that the number of classes that are not awesome is negligible , as shown below .",
    "@xmath207 @xmath208 for @xmath209 .",
    "since the number of non - awesome classes is negligible compared to the number of total classes , we can disregard them and restrict our attention to the awesome classes , which still comprise an asymptotically large proportion of all subsets .",
    "since almost all classes are awesome , we know that each awesome class is connected to @xmath210 $ ] in @xmath87 . since the awesome classes of @xmath87 are connected , the restriction of @xmath76 to the awesome classes is also connected .",

    "many of the techniques presented here can be extended to other forms of ucycle approximations .",
    "for example , it is possible to include any set in a ucycle packing by simply inserting the set elements anywhere in the cycle .",
    "we could therefore construct a _ ucycle covering _ by simply appending all non - awesome sets onto a near ucycle created using the techniques we have described .",
    "however , this is very inefficient because it increases the length of the cycle by @xmath3 for each added set instead of the desired 1 . in order to find a more elegant method of constructing ucycle coverings ,",
    "more complicated analysis is required .",
    "as stated earlier , each bad form may only produce a factor of @xmath1 sets .",
    "therefore , the method used to connect awesome sets into the ucycle will not work , since traversing an eulerian transition graph @xmath1 times is impossible for many bad forms .",
    "one possible method of connecting bad sets in a ucycle is to consider multiple form classes .",
