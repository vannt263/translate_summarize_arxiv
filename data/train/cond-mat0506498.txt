    "the key feature of these systems is there controllability and weak decoherence .",
    "in particular we employ two aspects of control , the confinement of atoms in optical lattices @xcite and ( magnetic or optical ) feshbach resonances as a way to manipulate atomic interactions @xcite . according to the setup described in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup](a ) we will study the dynamics of an atomic quantum gas in 1d ( with a single internal atomic state ) , representing bosonic or fermionic `` modes '' , controlled by an atomic spin-1/2 impurity .",
    "the quantum gas is confined by tight trapping potentials ( e.g. an optical or magnetic trap ) , so that only the motional degrees along the @xmath3-axis in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup](a ) are relevant . in the @xmath3-direction",
    "the motion is confined to the left by a trapping potential ( e.g. a blue sheet of light ) , while the atomic impurity restricts the motion of the gas to the right due to collisional interactions of the quantum gas with the impurity .",
    "the atom representing the impurity can , for example , be a different atomic species in a tight trapping potential , a configuration discussed in refs .",

    "thus the impurity atom plays the role of `` single atom mirror '' confining the quantum gas in an `` atomic cavity '' .    in our model system",
    "the impurity atom is an internal two level system , which we write as an effective spin-1/2 . in the following",
    "we will also interpret this two - level system as a qubit with two logical states @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "cold atom collision physics allows for a situation where the collisional properties ( scattering length ) of the impurity atom and atoms in the quantum gas are spin - dependent . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup](a ) , we assume that in one spin state , say @xmath7 , the single impurity atom is completely transparent for the quantum gas , i.e. the gas will leak out through the `` mirror '' .",
    "in contrast , in the other spin state the mirror atom is `` highly reflective '' confining the gas . for an impurity atom ( qubit ) initially prepared in a spin superposition @xmath8 the combined system at a time @xmath9 will be in a macroscopic superposition state @xmath10 with @xmath11 many body wave functions of the gas atoms .",

    "the gas could be loaded initially , for example , in a mott insulating state , i.e. where large repulsion of the gas atom leads to a filling of the lattice sites with exactly one atom per lattice site @xcite .",
    "the cat state ( [ eq : macrocatstate ] ) will thus correspond to a superposition of the _ mott phase _ and the _ melted _ mott phase , i.e. a _ ( quasi- ) condensate _ of atoms obtained by expansion of the atomic gas : @xmath15 in this case the distinguishing features of the two entangled quantum phases are the observation / non - observation of interference fringes as signatures of the mott and bec phase , when the atomic gas in released in a single experiment .",
    "transport through an impurity is a well studied problem in mesoscopic condensed matter physics @xcite , which typically focuses on conductance properties of a system attached to leads .",

    "[ sec : many_body_scattering ] we generalize the discussion to the case of interacting many - systems including the cases of a 1d degenerate fermi - gas , a 1d quasi - condensate and tonks gas .",
    "in this section we introduce the our model system by specifying the hamiltonian for a 1d lattice gas coupled to an impurity , and we explain the key idea behind our setup",

    "we consider the dynamics of a spin-1/2 atomic impurity @xmath2 coupled to a 1d quantum gas of either bosonic or fermionic probe atoms @xmath1 .",
