    "since the seminal paper @xcite , the theory of hydrodynamic limit of interacting particle systems has evolved into a powerful tool in the study of non - equilibrium properties of statistical systems of many components ( see the book @xcite for a comprehensive exposition ) . recently , and due to the infuence of physical and mathematical works about random walks in random environment ,",

    "we give an unified approach to this problem , recovering previous results in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , in a simple way . in order to concentrate our efforts in the influence of the inhomogeneous environment on the asymptotics of the density of particles",
