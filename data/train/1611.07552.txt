    "at this point in the development of practical quantum annealing devices , there has been a great deal published regarding specialized benchmarking problems designed for existing hardware @xcite .",
    "progress has also been made in the development of potential applications that are suitable for quantum annealers but not fundamentally hardware specific @xcite .",
    "although some work exists @xcite , less attention has been paid in the published literature to the difficult and important work of transforming these more general applications into specific hardware implementations .",
    "the first step in the transformation , embedding , while crucial to the success of quantum annealing ( qa ) , is not the primary focus here .",
    "the leading embedding algorithm is that which has been developed by d - wave systems for their own hardware @xcite , which we will use here without comment .",
    "this algorithm produces an _ embedding _ which translates the @xmath0 _ logical qubits _",
    "@xmath1 that make up the original _ logical problem _ @xmath2    @xmath3    into sets of @xmath4 _ physical qubits _",
    "@xmath5 that make up the _ physical problem _ @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath7    the logical problem may define a _ logical bias _ @xmath8 for each individual logical qubit , which will be represented by one or more _ physical bias _",
    "@xmath9 terms on the relevant physical qubits .",
    "two logical qubits may be connected by a _ logical coupler _",
    "@xmath10 in the logical problem , which must be represented by one or more _ physical couplers _",
    "@xmath11 in the physical problem .",
    "finally , the physical qubits comprising each logical qubit must be kept consistent , and are therefore subject to _ chain couplings _ @xmath12 connecting them .",
    "@xmath13    in this notation , @xmath0 is the number of logical qubits , @xmath14 is the number of physical qubits , @xmath15 is the logical edge set of the problem and @xmath16 is the physical edge set that exists in the hardware .    even with an embedding provided , we are free to choose the physical biases , physical couplings , and chain couplings that transform a logical problem into a physical problem , subject to certain constraints .",
    "this process is called _ parameter setting _ , and is addressed in section [ ps_strategies ] .",
    "section [ decoding ] covers _ decoding _ , defined for our purposes as the process of transforming a _ physical result _",
    "back into a _",
    "logical result _ that is a candidate solution to the original logical problem . after defining our main procedural tools ,",
    "we describe our test problem set of mixed satisfiability instances and commercial quantum annealing equipment in sections [ mixed_sat ] and [ equipment ] .",
    "we then apply our parameter setting methods to the problem set , developing recommendations for choosing a favorable approach based on experimental data in sections [ results ] and [ conclusions ] .",
    "the most important consideration in parameter setting is the preservation of the ratio between terms in the logical problem .",
    "biases and couplings may be rescaled to suit the hardware parameters or the number and distribution of available qubits , but the relationship of each logical problem term ( i.e. the sum of the associated physical problem terms ) to each other term must remain consistent .",
    "the choice of chain coupling will in turn be affected by the physical problem terms being used .",
    "the simplest parameter setting strategy is to choose one physical device on - chip to represent each logical problem term . out of @xmath4 physical qubits in logical qubit @xmath17",
    ", one will be programmed with the full logical bias , so @xmath18 for the selected @xmath19 and @xmath20 otherwise .",
    "if there is more than one physical coupler representing a logical coupler , only one is selected and programmed with the logical coupling , so one @xmath21 and the rest are @xmath22 .",
    "we choose the physical qubit with the most physical problem couplings attached to it , and the first available physical coupler ( this choice is not as crucial because embedding algorithms often struggle to provide one physical coupler per logical coupler ) .",
    "this strategy has been observed to work best with chain couplings @xmath12 less than or equal to the magnitude of the largest physical problem term .",
    "another straightforward strategy is to distribute logical problem terms evenly over the number of physical devices available to represent them . for a logical qubit with @xmath4 physical qubits , @xmath23 for all @xmath19 , unless it falls below the hardware resolution @xmath24 . in this case",
    ", we rank the physical qubits @xmath25 in order of decreasing number of adjacent , active physical couplers .",
    "the first @xmath26 physical qubits are assigned @xmath27 , the next on the list gets the remainder , if any , from @xmath28 , and the rest are assigned @xmath20 .",
    "the same procedure is followed for the couplers , although there are usually few of them and they can not be ordered in the same way because every coupler touches exactly two qubits .",
    "the even distribution was generally found to be optimal when chain coupling exceeded the magnitude of the largest physical problem term , with this combination being the best overall strategy .",
    "the idea that the physical qubits which are coupled to members of other logical groups are the most crucial leads to a weighted distribution of physical problem terms .",
    "we first assign a weight to each qubit , @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the number of active physical couplers attached to qubit @xmath19 of logical group @xmath17 and @xmath31 is the total number of active physical couplers for logical qubit @xmath17 ( excluding couplers used in @xmath32 ) .",
    "the physical bias on each physical qubit is then @xmath33 .",
    "if @xmath34 , @xmath9 is set to @xmath22 and its value is distributed among the physical qubits that made the cutoff .    a variant of this strategy , which we term the weighted regularized distribution",
    ", assigns a base bias of magnitude @xmath24 to each physical qubit , then distributes any extra bias according to the weight system ; @xmath35 , where @xmath36.the weighted regularized distribution results fell somewhere between those from the weighted and even strategies , more closely tracking the even strategy .",
    "after a qa problem has been implemented and annealed on hardware , the result must be transformed back into the solution space of the logical problem .",
    "we term this process decoding .",
    "for this work , several decoding strategies ( single qubit , majority vote , and weighted majority vote ) were used in concert .",
    "the simplest decoding strategy is to take the readout from the physical qubit within each logical qubit with the highest weight @xmath37 as described in section [ sec_weighted ] to be the value of logical qubit @xmath17 .",
    "this strategy never produces an indeterminate outcome , but also discards any information that may be contained in the remaining physical qubits .",
    "a more popular decoding strategy is to take a majority vote over the physical qubits to determine each logical qubit value .",
    "ties in the majority vote are resolved by choosing one of the two possible values at random .",
    "the majority vote can be simple or it may take into account the weight @xmath37 of each physical qubit and give those with higher weights more value .",
    "the simple majority vote result is @xmath38 and the weighted majority vote result is @xmath39 , where the readout values @xmath40 .",
    "we studied parameter setting on mixed satisfiability ( sat ) problems .",
    "sat problems are a core variety of optimization problems that underlie a variety of applications and are important enough to motivate the development of an ecosystem of specialized classical solvers @xcite .",
    "mixed sat problems specifically have fewer constraints on their structure than other classes of sat , making them a useful general class to study . whereas many sat classes are defined by the number of variables in the individual clauses that together constitute the larger problem",
    ", two clauses in a mixed sat problem need not involve the same number of variables , opening up representations of naturally varied constraints .",
    "another important feature of this problem class is that , unlike many problem sets that have been constructed for study with quantum annealers to date @xcite , but like the general class of potential optimization applications , it does not embed natively on the hardware graph , making parameter setting critically important for performance .",
    "these problems also have multiple satisfying answers , a case not usually considered by classical sat solvers due to the difficulty of finding all solutions , leaving room for progress on sampling over the solution space for problems with many satisfying assignments .",
    "mixed sat problems involving @xmath41 binary variables were generated by randomly choosing @xmath42 clauses of bounded length .",
    "the random problem instance set was downselected twice , first to limit the number of solutions to fewer than a million ( according to the results of a classical all - solutions sat solver @xcite ) , then to instances for which we were able to find an embedding on hardware . practically speaking",
    ", this meant that the @xmath43 instances were implemented on the smaller @xmath44 qubit d - wave two ( dw2 ) chip used for this work , while the @xmath45 instances were studied using a larger @xmath46 qubit d - wave two x ( dw2x ) processor .",
    "the resulting problem set had @xmath47 instances for the dw2 , and 123 for the dw2x .",
    "quantum annealing optimization experiments referenced here were performed using two commercial quantum annealing chips manufactured by d - wave systems .",
    "the dw2 generation chip was designed with @xmath48 qubits and yielded @xmath44 working qubits ; the dw2x was designed with @xmath49 qubits and yielded @xmath46 working .",
    "this class of quantum annealing processor uses superconducting quantum interference devices to create a quantum environment for solving ising spin glass problems of the form described in equation [ eq_h_logical ] and is extensively described in the literature @xcite .",
    "the first parameter to set is the magnitude of the chain coupling @xmath12 , which ties the logical qubits into internally consistent units .",
    "the choice of this seemingly straightforward parameter can have crucial impacts on the time - dependent energy spectrum of the annealing process . if the chain coupling is too weak , logical qubits break into domains of physical qubits with opposing spin orientations , failing to act as a single variable .",
    "if it is too strong , it can overwhelm the physical problem terms @xmath9 and @xmath11 , possibly even pushing them below the precision threshold of the devices on - chip ( physical bias and coupling terms are subject to noise ; those that are set too close together may in fact cross @xcite ) .",
    "this is an important point because the chain couplings that are necessary for internally consistent logical qubits are often greater than @xmath50 , if we define the scaling of the physical problem such that the maximum physical problem term @xmath51 .",
    "our mixed sat problem set was tested with chain couplings @xmath52 , a range motivated by an earlier study of 3-sat problems which showed the most instances were solved at @xmath53 .",
    "each problem instance has its own peak in success probability ( the observed probability that a single annealing run will result in an answer satisfying the mixed sat formula ) and number of unique answers observed . in order to treat the problem set as a class , we examined two figures of merit for performance : the number of instances with optimal performance at a given chain coupling , and the median success probability ratio over the instance set for all problems . because some instances are harder than others",
    ", we used a ratio normalizing the success probability of each problem at a given chain coupling to its performance at @xmath54 , therefore differentiating the performance of the chain couplings regardless of instance hardness .",
    "the results for the dw2 ( @xmath55 ) problem set can be seen in figures [ dw2_hist ] and [ dw2_median_success_vs_chain ] , and indicate an optimal chain coupling of @xmath54 over the parameter space studied .",
    ".,width=264 ]    . plotted here is the median value of @xmath56 over the problem set .",
    "all parameter setting strategies perform best for @xmath54 , with the single strategy exhibiting a particularly sharp decline in success probability as the chain coupling increases.,width=264 ]    the same figures of merit were calculated for the dw2x ( @xmath45 ) problem set , and can be seen in figures [ dw2x_hist ] and [ dw2x_median_success_vs_chain ] .",
    "the advantages of @xmath54 are even more pronounced in these results than they were for the dw2 data .",
    ".,width=264 ]    . plotted here",
    "is the median value of @xmath56 over the problem set .",
    "all parameter setting strategies perform best for @xmath54 , and decline more quickly as the chain coupling increases than was observed for the dw2 problem set.,width=264 ]      now we turn to a comparison of the different parameter setting strategies and how they performed over the two mixed sat problem sets . if we look at the median success plots in figures [ dw2_median_success_vs_chain ] and [ dw2x_median_success_vs_chain ] , we see that the even , weighted , and weighted regularized strategies generally perform better than the single strategy , which declines rapidly with increasing chain coupling over the dw2 problem set , though the difference is not evident in the dw2x problem set . in order to understand these performance differences",
    ", we must remember that a choice of a parameter setting strategy is a choice of a time - dependent physical hamiltonian with which quantum annealing will attempt to solve the optimization problem .",
    "the performance of qa depends critically on the characteristics of this physical hamiltonian , especially in the time when the system approaches the minimum gap , but calculating the dynamics of the system at this point is more difficult than solving the original optimization problem .",
    "we can , however , readily examine the physical problem , which represents the hamiltonian at the end of the qa evolution .",
    "the figure of merit for the physical problem that is most relevant here is the minimum parameter distance ( mpd ) , i.e. , how close are the closest two values in the set @xmath57 ?",
    "if we take the first form of equation [ eq_h_phys ] , the values in this set are elements of the @xmath0 by @xmath0 coupling matrix @xmath58 , and the mpd can be expressed simply as :    @xmath59    the closer these physical parameters are , the more likely it is that they will cross due to one of the many sources of noise on - chip .",
    "a parameter setting with more separation between all physical values , then , is preferable to one that drives two or more values very close together ( i.e. we prefer larger mpd because it signifies a physical problem that is more robust to noise ) .",
    "figures [ precision_dw2 ] and [ precision_dw2x ] show what is happening with the mpd of the instances in the problem sets when they are parameterized with different strategies and chain couplings .    .",
    "the other three strategies show lower but more consistent mpd because they have multiple physical devices over which to distribute the logical values , blunting or negating entirely the impact of higher chain couplings.,width=264 ]     mixed sat binary problems are larger and more complicated .",
    "although the dw2x chip can handle lower mpd than the dw2 chip , the mpd demands of this problem set are such that all strategies suffer as chain coupling increases.,width=264 ]      spin reversal transformations ( srts ) are another way to change the physical problem representation .",
    "the transformation is represented by a reversal vector @xmath60 , which has length @xmath14 ( the number of physical qubits ) and creates a transformed @xmath6    @xmath61    the use of multiple parameter settings or spin reversal transformations becomes important when we consider sampling from a large solution space . by changing the physical problem",
    ", we may gain access to different parts of the solution space , allowing us to see a wider variety of answers .",
    "the use of srts to boost success probability by averaging out noise is well established using the argument that srts can flip the effect of persistent bias on individual qubits and couplers @xcite .",
    "if not averaged out , these biases can push the system in different directions depending on the effect of the current srt .",
    "we subjected the dw2x problem set to four spin reversal transformations ( the same four used in @xcite , including the identity transformation ) to determine whether multiple parameter settings or srts provide more unique answers and better success probability .",
    "the results , shown in figures [ frac_gauges_vs_params ] and [ success_gauges_vs_params ] , favor the spin reversal transformations for this purpose .",
    "the performance of parameter setting strategies on d - wave quantum annealers is affected strongly by the mpd of the physical problem generated .",
    "this is good news because physical problem mpd can be calculated efficiently for problems of application scale , as opposed to physically important but computationally inaccessible values like the minimum gap of the time - dependent quantum annealing energy spectrum .",
    "distribution of logical bias and coupling values over more than one physical device is also a desirable characteristic of a parameter setting strategy because it avoids single qubit failure modes and makes the success of the calculation less dependent on the choice of chain coupling .",
    "the even and single parameter setting strategies described here are recommended to qa programmers in the field for their ease of implementation and favorable characteristics .",
    "the even strategy achieves distribution of logical values , but the single strategy may be appropriate for logical problems with unfavorable mpd _",
    "a priori_. new parameter setting strategies with favorable logical value distribution and physical problem mpd may still emerge from future research .    for this problem",
    "set , we found that spin reversal transformations performed better than alternate parameter setting strategies to boost success probability and solution sampling diversity .",
    "reasons for this may include the similarity of three out of the four parameter setting strategies ( even , weighted , and weighted regularized ) ; these strategies may have produced physical problems that were more meaningfully consistent than the same parameter setting with a spin reversal transformation .",
    "additionally , the parameter setting strategies may have suffered from being studied with no spin reversal transformation applied ; for this chip and problem set , the identity transformed problems exhibited the poorest performance .",
    "whatever the reason , the utility of spin reversal transformations is a positive result because they are easy to generate and lightweight to perform , rendering them a good tool for practical qa programmers .",
