    "a crucial quantity in the models based on einstein gravity aimed at accounting for this expansion is the equation of state ( eos ) of dark energy ( de ) , i.e. , @xmath5 , the ratio of the pressure to the energy density of the dark energy . in the case of the lambda cold dark",
    "matter , @xmath6cdm model , this agent can be identified with the energy of the quantum vacuum whence the corresponding eos parameter is just @xmath7 . in spite of the observational success of this model , recent model - independent measurements of @xmath8 seem to favor a slightly more negative eos ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , which , if confirmed , would invalidate the model .",
    "in particular , the planck mission yields @xmath9 @xcite , rest et al . , using supernovae type ia ( sn ia ) data from the pan - starrs1 medium deep survey found @xmath10 , i.e. , @xmath11 at 2.3 @xmath12 confidence level @xcite , shafer and huterer @xcite using geometrical data from sn ia , baryon acoustic oscillations ( baos ) , and cmb , determined @xmath13 at 2@xmath12 confidence level .",
    "the simplest way to get @xmath13 , consistent with general relativity , is assume that the de has your origin at a phantom field @xcite .",
    "despite being compatible with observational data , such a possibility has serious theoretical problems @xcite .",
    "other stringent constraints on the eos have been analyzed in several contexts , such as , considering a variable eos for both dark components @xcite , using cosmographic methods to investigate various dynamic eos models @xcite , and a reconstruction of the dark energy eos via node - based reconstruction @xcite .",
    "+ in a recent work @xcite , the authors investigated an alternative to this possibility , namely , that the measured equation of state , @xmath8 , is in reality an effective one , the equation of state of the quantum vacuum , @xmath14 , plus the negative equation of state , @xmath15 , associated to the production of particles by the gravitational field acting on the vacuum . from a joint analysis of data supernova type ia , gamma ray bursts , baryon acoustic oscillations , and the hubble rate ,",

    "+ in this context , one may wonder that the primeval accelerated expansion of the universe ( i.e. , the inflationary era ) could result in a very fast rate of relativistic particle productions due to action of the gravitational field on the quantum vacuum . if for a sufficiently long period of time , this rate was high enough to compensate , or nearly compensate , for the dilution of particles due to the universe expansion , then the energy density of the particles fluid wound remain nearly constant giving rise to an inflationary expansion . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", this idea was first proposed in @xcite .",
    "+ it is important to mention that inflation driven by the particle production is not a new subject .",
    "particle creation as a source of inflation in the early universe , was first investigated in @xcite , using the expressions for the energy - momentum of the created particles and the rate of their creation ( @xmath17 for non - conformal particles in a flrw universe ) derived earlier in @xcite .",
    "however , it appeared that such model presents some problems , such as , they can not produce a sufficiently low curvature during inflation , and a graceful exit from it . thus , success in constructing viable inflationary models",
    "was achieved in the starobinsky model @xcite in which the dissipation and the creation of matter occurred already after the end of inflation .",
    "however , the idea of particle creation driving inflation was revived after that under the name of warm inflation @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to explore a possible connection between the inflationary stage with late cosmic acceleration through of a continuous process of creation of particles by the gravitational field acting on the quantum vacuum @xcite .",
    "+ this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the next section briefly sums up the phenomenological basis of particle creation in an expanding homogeneous and isotropic , spatially flat , universe . in section",
    "[ sec : inflationary_epoch ] , we describe the inflationary era as a result of a continuous and fast process of creation of relativistic particles . in section [ sec : inflationary_epoch ] , we present the dynamics of the universe in the post inflationary era in presence of a continuous matter creation associated with the production of particles by the gravitational field acting on the vacuum .",
    "section [ statistical_analysis ] specifies the various sets of data and the statistical analysis employed to constrain the model .",
    "the concluding section summarizes and gives comments on our findings . as usual , the scale factor of the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric is normalized so that @xmath18 , the naught subscript indicates the present time .",
    "as investigated by parker and collaborators @xcite , the material content of the universe may have had its origin in the continuous creation of radiation and matter from the gravitational field of the expanding cosmos acting on the quantum vacuum , regardless of the relativistic theory of gravity assumed . in this picture , the produced particles draw their mass , momentum and energy from the time - evolving gravitational background which acts as a  pump \" converting curvature into particles . + prigogine @xcite studied how to insert the creation of matter consistently in einstein s field equations .",
    "this was achieved by introducing in the usual balance equation for the number density of particles , @xmath19 , a source term on the right hand side to account for the production of particles , namely , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the particle fluid four - velocity normalized so that @xmath22 , and @xmath23 denotes the particle production rate . according to parker s theorem ,",
    "the production of relativistic particles is strongly suppressed in the radiation era @xcite .",
    "the above equation , when combined with the second law of thermodynamics , naturally leads to the appearance of a negative pressure , the creation pressure @xmath24 , which adds to the other pressures ( i.e. , radiation , baryons , dark matter , and vacuum pressure ) in the stress - energy tensor .",
    "these results were subsequently discussed and generalized in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite by means of a covariant formalism , and were further confirmed by using relativistic kinetic theory @xcite . + since the entropy flux vector of matter , @xmath25 , where @xmath12 denotes the entropy per particle , must fulfill the second law of thermodynamics @xmath26 , the constraint @xmath27 readily follows .    for a homogeneous and isotropic universe , with scale factor @xmath28 ,",
    "in which there is an adiabatic process of particle production , its variation with respect to the cosmic time is null , i.e. , @xmath29 .",
    "this adiabatic matter creation process corresponds to an irreversible energy flow from the gravitational field to the created matter constituents . ] from the quantum vacuum , a direct relationship between the creation pressure and the particle production rate exists as @xcite @xmath30 therefore , being @xmath24 negative , it may have produced the accelerated expansion in the early universe ( i.e. , inflationary era ) , as well as , it may also drive the present accelerated cosmic expansion . here ,",
    "@xmath31 , @xmath32 , respectively , denote the energy density and the pressure of the corresponding fluid , @xmath33 is the hubble factor , and as usual , an overdot denotes the differentiation with respect to cosmic time .",
    "+ the eos associated with the process of creation of matter follows from eq .",
    "( [ pressure_creation ] )    @xmath34    where @xmath35 for non - relativistic matter , and @xmath36 for relativistic matter .",
    "we consider a spatially - flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe , with hubble factor @xmath37 .",
    "we assume a universe undergoing a continuous process of particle creation thanks to the action of the gravitational field on the quantum vacuum .",
    "the first friedmann equation reads    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is the reduced planck mass .",
    "let us consider the possibility that the early inflationary phase was the result of a continuous and fast process of creation of particles , so fast that the energy density @xmath31 stays practically constant by about 55 e - folds , to decline quickly afterwards around the gut era .",
    "to go ahead , an expression for the rate @xmath23 is needed .",
    "we first assume that the total rate split into two terms as    @xmath40    with @xmath41 referring to the particle creation rate in the early universe , and @xmath42 , the particle creation rate of dark matter particles .",
    "then we adopt the following phenomenological expressions    @xmath43,\\ ] ]    and    @xmath44,\\ ] ]    where , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 are positive constant parameters . the parameter @xmath47 is associated with the decay rate of the particle production .",
    "the higher @xmath47 , the faster @xmath41 goes down .",
    "thus , in order to obtain an inflationary expansion for a sufficiently long period of time , @xmath47 must lie in an interval @xmath49 . here , we adopt @xmath50 . for other values within the above range ,",
    "the dynamics generated by @xmath41 is practically the same .",
    "let us consider @xmath51 , to eliminate the possibility of an eos less than @xmath0 in the inflationary era .",
    "the constants @xmath46 , @xmath48 are free parameters of the model to be constrained by the observational data . when @xmath52 , @xmath42 gets close to zero regardless the value of @xmath48 .",
    "in fact , as we will see later , @xmath42 practically does not influence the cosmic dynamics for @xmath53 , since in the very early universe , the production of non relativistic matter is negligible .",
    "figure [ gamma_3h ] shows the ratio @xmath54 in terms of the scale factor for different values of @xmath46 . from eqs .",
    "( [ g ] )  ( [ g3 ] ) , it is seen that at early times ( @xmath55 ) @xmath56 , and @xmath57 , otherwise .",

    "( [ g2 ] ) . at the end of this phase ,",
    "the scale factor will have grown enormously , the production of particles will have declined sharply , and the transition to the radiation dominated phase occurs .",
    "according to parker s theorem , in the latter phase massless particles can not be quantum - mechanically produced @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the early inflationary era is usually described by a self - interacting scalar field , @xmath58 , that slowly rolls down its potential , @xmath59 , in such a way that the latter dominates the total energy density ( i.e. , @xmath60 ) during the inflationary expansion .",
    "it is therefore illustrative to relate @xmath15 to a scalar field that would generate the same amount of inflation as the particle production scenario .",

    "<S> a continuous process of creation of particles is investigated as a possible connection between the inflationary stage with late cosmic acceleration . in this model </S>",
    "<S> , the inflationary era occurs due to a continuous and fast process of creation of relativistic particles , and the recent accelerating phase is driven by the non - relativistic matter creation from the gravitational field acting on the quantum vacuum , which finally results in an effective equation of state less than @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , explaining recent results in favor of a phantom dynamics without the need of any modifications in the gravity theory has been proposed . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we confront the model with recent observational data of type ia supernova , history of the hubble parameter , baryon acoustic oscillations , and the cosmic microwave background . </S>"
