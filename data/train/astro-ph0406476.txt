    "it is a great challenge to implement inflation in string / m - theory .",
    "currently , to achieve this goal , there are mainly two types of models : one is the modification of the friedmann equation in the braneworld scenario ( see , e.g. @xcite for a review ) ; another is specific model of inflaton field from string / m - theory ( see , @xcite for a recent important development ) . in this paper",
    ", we will consider a scenario belonging to the second type recently proposed by silverstein and tong @xcite .    in @xcite ,",
    "silverstein and tong considered the inflaton as the scalar field in the moduli space of the @xmath0 supersymmetric yang - mills ( sym ) theory .",
    "they call this model `` d - cceleration '' . in the strong coupling region ,",
    "the effective description of the theory is via gravity and string theory by using the ads / cft correspondence @xcite .",
    "then in the gravity side , the causal speed - limit in the bulk will translate into a speed limit on moduli space .",
    "this has also been observed before by kabat and lifschytz @xcite .",
    "interpreted in the field theory side of the correspondence , this result reflects the breakdown of the moduli - space @xmath1-model approximation due to the growing importance of the higher derivative terms .",
    "the dynamics will be changed dramatically from the canonical scalar field theory due to this speed limit and may lead to inflations without a flat potential .",
    "the effective action comes from , as written in field theory variable , the dirac - born - infeld action of a probe d3-brane moving in ads@xmath2s@xmath3 @xcite with metric signature @xmath4 , @xmath5,\\label{1.1}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the yang - mills coupling , and @xmath7 is the t hooft coupling , in which @xmath8 is the rank of the sym theory .",
    "the string coupling @xmath9 is given by @xmath10 .",
    "it is worth commenting that in the pure @xmath0 sym theory , there does not have the potential @xmath11 ( the dynamics of the @xmath12 field without the potential is analyzed in sec.3.2 of @xcite ) .",
    "the potential @xmath11 arises only after couple @xmath12 to other sectors involved in a full string compactification .",
    "however , as we will show in sec.[ec ] , a simple argument based on strong energy condition shows that if we want the @xmath12 field to be a reasonable candidate of inflaton , we must consider a non - zero potential .",
    "it is interesting to note that when @xmath13 , expanding the action ( [ 1.1 ] ) to first order in @xmath14 , it just reduces to the lagrangian of a canonical scalar field theory @xmath15 .",
    "so the lagrangian ( [ 1.1 ] ) can be viewed as a correction to the canonical scalar field theory when the kinetic term @xmath16 is large . on the other hand , the lagrangian ( [ 1.1 ] ) is also similar to the effective action of tachyon field @xcite @xmath17 , which is a physical example of the general scenario of `` k - inflation '' @xcite . so it is also conceivable that the dynamics of the theory ( [ 1.1 ] ) will be similar in some respects to the tachyon field .",
    "the author of @xcite mentioned that the theory ( [ 1.1 ] ) can be viewed as a physical example of k - inflation .",
    "however , the general lagrangian of k - inflation is of the form @xmath18 , where @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are two arbitrary functions .",
    "then we can see that the lagrangian ( [ 1.1 ] ) actually does not belong to this form .",
    "so this lagrangian is not an example of k - inflation in a precise meaning and the analysis of the dynamics of k - inflation can not be applied to it .",
    "the most notable feature of the lagrangian ( [ 1.1 ] ) is that it automatically imposes a restriction on @xmath22 , the speed limit : @xmath23 thus when @xmath12 is small , the @xmath12 field will be enforced to roll slowly without the need of a flat potential .",
    "the energy density @xmath24 and pressure @xmath21 of the @xmath12 field follows from the action ( [ 1.1 ] ) ( note that since we are interested in the cosmological dynamics of the @xmath12 field , it is reasonable to assume that @xmath12 is spatially homogeneous ) , @xmath25 @xmath26 and the equation of motion for @xmath12 can be obtained either by varying @xmath12 in ( [ 1.1 ] ) or by the energy conservation equation @xmath27 , @xmath28 it is easy to check that @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the initial value , is always a solution of the evolution equation ( [ 2.6 ] ) which satisfies the speed limit exactly , i.e. @xmath31 , irrespective of the precise form of the potential @xmath32 .",
    "however , this can not be a stable solution : from the expression for the energy density @xmath24 , i.e. eq.([1.5 ] ) , we can see that when @xmath12 satisfies the speed limit exactly , the energy density tends to infinity ( this also has an interesting dual interpretation from ads / cft : when the speed of the d - brane tends to unity , according to relativity , its energy tends to infinity ) .",
    "this means that the action ( [ 1.1 ] ) is not sensible when @xmath12 satisfies the speed limit exactly .",
    "when facing a new field theory that intended to apply to cosmology , one natural question one would like to ask is : under what conditions it will satisfy or violate the various energy conditions @xcite ?",
    "first , it is easy to see from eqs.([1.5 ] ) , ( [ 1.6 ] ) that @xmath12 always satisfies the weak energy condition : @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "this implies that the equation of state of @xmath12 @xmath35 always satisfies @xmath36 .",
    "thus this theory will not suffer from the possible instability of vacuum @xcite that might cause problems in a phantom field theory which is characterizes by @xmath37 .",
    "second , with a little more labor , it is also easy to say that the dominant energy condition : @xmath38 , is also always satisfied by @xmath12 .",
    "thus , from the vacuum conservation theorem of hawking and ellis @xcite , ( see also @xcite a recent review and a simplified proof ) , the energy of @xmath12 field can not propagate outside the light - cone .",
    "at last , let s come to the strong energy condition : @xmath34 and @xmath39 . from eqs.([1.5 ] ) , ( [ 1.6 ] ) , @xmath40 then it is easy to see that when @xmath41 , @xmath12 will always satisfy the strong energy condition . as is well - known , for a matter to drive an accelerated universe ,",
    "it is just necessary and sufficient for that matter to violate the strong energy condition .",
    "so if @xmath41 , as in the case of pure @xmath0 sym theory , @xmath12 field can not be a viable candidate of infaton . whether @xmath12 field can violate the strong energy condition depends on the precise form of the potential . in this sense ,",
    "the @xmath12 field is more like a canonical scalar field rather than a tachyon field . since in the latter case , whether the tachyon field can violate the strong energy condition depends only on the value of @xmath42 ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "inflation can be predictive only if the solution exhibits an attractor behavior , where the differences between solutions of different initial conditions rapidly vanish ( see sec .",
    "3.7 of @xcite for a review ) .",
    "thus this section is devoted to the study of the inflationary attractor property of the @xmath12 field for a general potential @xmath11 .",
    "the friedmann equation reads , @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the hubble parameter .",
    "we will use the hamilton - jacobi formulation for the modified friedmann equation @xcite , which is a powerful and very effective tool for analyzing the inflationary attractor property @xcite .",
    "this formulation is also very useful in obtaining solutions of the evolution equations @xcite . in this formulation",
    ", we will view the scalar field @xmath12 as the time variable and this requires that the @xmath12 field does not change sign during inflation . without loss of generality",
    ", we can choose @xmath45 in the following discussions .",
    "if this is not satisfied , it can be brought about by redefining @xmath46 .",
    "the hamilton - jacobi formulation of the friedmann equation reads @xcite @xmath47 and @xmath48    supposing @xmath49 is any solution to eq.([2.7 ] ) , which can be either inflationary or non - inflationary .",
    "we consider a small homogeneous perturbation @xmath50 to this solution .",
    "the attractor property will be satisfied if it becomes smaller as @xmath12 increases .",
    "substituting @xmath51 into eq.([2.7 ] ) and linearizing , we find that the perturbation obeys @xmath52 which has had the general solution @xmath53\\label{2.9}\\ ] ] where @xmath54 is the value at some initial point @xmath30 . from eq.([2.71 ] ) , since @xmath55 and @xmath56 have the opposite sign , if @xmath57 is an inflationary solution , all linear perturbations are damped at least exponentially .",
    "thus we conclude that the inflationary attractor property holds for the field @xmath12 .",
    "see fig.1 for the phase portrait of the potential ( [ 1.4 ] ) where we can clearly perceive this conclusion .",
    "in this section , we will study numerically the dynamics of the @xmath12 field for the simplest potential that may lead to a power law acceleration @xcite @xmath58 it has been shown in @xcite that at late time , @xmath12 will just tend to solution ( [ 1.31 ] ) .",
    "we choose this potential is because that in addition to its simplicity , as argued in @xcite , higher power terms in the effective potential will be small compared to the quadratic term without significant tuning .",
    "however , the lagrangian ( [ 1.1 ] ) can not be trusted for arbitrarily small @xmath12 because of the back reaction of the probe brane on the geometry .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that the theory can be trusted only for @xmath12 greater than a critical value @xcite , @xmath59    also in @xcite , it has been argued that the potential ( [ 1.4 ] ) can drive a power law inflation only if @xmath60 satisfies @xmath61 where the planck scale @xmath62 .",
    "we have verified numerically that this is indeed the case .",
    "thus in the following discussions , we will impose this bound on the parameter @xmath60 .    in the following discussion",
    ", we will fix the tension parameter @xmath63 throughout for illustrative purposes .    to study the evolution , it is convenient to rewrite the evolution equation ( [ 2.6 ] ) as a set of two first order equations with two independent re - scaled variables @xmath64 and @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the inflationary energy scale .",
    "then in terms of @xmath67 and @xmath68 , the speed limit ( [ 1.2 ] ) and the bound ( [ 1.7 ] ) translate into @xmath69 and @xmath70 where @xmath71 for any reasonable value of the scalar field s mass @xmath60 .",
    "we define a dimensionless parameter@xmath72 for describing the energy scale fraction . in the following discussion",
    ", we will always take @xmath73 , which corresponds to the gut scale for the m. then the evolution equation ( [ 2.6 ] ) can be written as an dynamically autonomous system : @xmath74 @xmath75\\label{3.3}\\ ] ] where a prime denotes differentiation with respect to the number of e - folding @xmath8 defined by @xmath76 thus @xmath77 .    and in terms of @xmath67 and @xmath68 , the friedmann equation ( [ 2.5 ] )",
    "can be rewritten as @xmath78\\label{3.5}\\ ] ]    also in terms of @xmath79 and @xmath80 , the bound ( [ 1.8 ] ) translates into @xmath81     in the re - scaled coordinates @xmath82 for @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "the left panel show the behavior for small initial value of @xmath68 .",
    "the right panel shows the behavior for initial value of @xmath68 close to the speed limit bound . in both panels",
    ", the dotted line corresponds to the curve that satisfies the speed limit exactly , i.e. @xmath85 . the dashed line in the right panel corresponds to the slow - roll approximated equation ( [ 3.9]).,title=\"fig : \" ]   in the re - scaled coordinates @xmath82 for @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "the left panel show the behavior for small initial value of @xmath68 .",
    "the right panel shows the behavior for initial value of @xmath68 close to the speed limit bound . in both panels",
    ", the dotted line corresponds to the curve that satisfies the speed limit exactly , i.e. @xmath85 . the dashed line in the right panel corresponds to the slow - roll approximated equation ( [ 3.9]).,title=\"fig : \" ]    in the following we start the numerical analysis of the dynamical system .",
    "fig.1 shows the trajectories in the phase plane @xmath86 with @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "@xmath67 will take values in the region @xmath89 ; @xmath68 will take values in the region @xmath90 .",
    "we can see that there is a curve that attracts all the trajectories which correspond to the slow - roll curve .",
    "this confirms our conclusion in the last section for the specific potential ( [ 1.4 ] ) .",
    "for all the allowed initial value , @xmath12 tends to the slow - roll curve quite soon after it begins to evolve . for simplicity ,",
    "let us then analyze in detail the dynamics of @xmath12 for small initial @xmath68 that satisfies @xmath91 . since @xmath92 and @xmath63",
    ", this corresponds to @xmath93 .    see the left panel of fig.1 where we have taken @xmath94 . by the numerical calculations ,",
    "the dynamics of @xmath12 can be divided qualitatively into three stages .",
    "first , when it begins to evolve , it quickly evolves to the slow - roll curve .",
    "second , it undergoes a slow - roll stage until @xmath95 .",
    "third , it evolves as the speed limit curve .    in the first stage , from the left panel of fig.1",
    ", we can consistently set @xmath96 and because we have assumed a small initial @xmath68 , we can set @xmath97 .",
    "thus from eq.([3.5 ] ) , @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "because @xmath100 and @xmath101 in this stage , we have @xmath102 with @xmath103 .",
    "thus eq.([3.3 ] ) reduces to @xmath104 which can be integrated to give @xmath105 thus in this region , @xmath68 is damped exponentially to the slow - roll curve with @xmath67 kept almost constant as we can see that from the upper right of the left panel .",
    "furthermore , we can see that during the slow - roll stage , @xmath106 .    in the second stage , since @xmath107 , we may set @xmath108 and @xmath109 in the dynamical system as described by eqs .",
    "( [ 3.2 ] ) , ( [ 3.3 ] ) , and ( [ 3.5 ] ) .",
    "then the system can be approximated by @xmath110 and @xmath111    this is a simple algebraic system of @xmath112 and can be solved exactly to give @xmath113\\frac{y_1}{12}\\label{3.9}\\ ] ] the dashed line in the left panel of fig.1 corresponds to the phase portrait of this slow - roll approximated evolution equation . furthermore , since @xmath99 and @xmath114 , eq.([3.9 ] ) can further reduce to @xmath115 this is consistent with eq.([3.62 ] ) .    in the third stage , when @xmath116 , the attractor curve coincides with the limit curve that satisfies the speed limit exactly , i.e. @xmath85 .",
    "this has already been pointed out in @xcite as the late time behavior of @xmath12 by using the hamilton - jacobi method .",
    "however , as we have showed , @xmath12 will behave in this way well before it reaches the critical point @xmath117 .",
    "in this paper , we studied the cosmological dynamics of the d - cceleration scenario .",
    "we proved the inflationary attractor property using the hamilton - jacobi method and studied the phase portrait .",
    "thus in this respect , this model can be a reasonable model of inflation .",
    "of course , there are still many works needed to be done such as confrontation with observation to see whether this is a viable model of inflation .",
    "it is interesting to ask whether the theory ( [ 1.1 ] ) can also be a viable candidate for quintessence which can drive an acceleration in the current universe ( see , e.g. @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "this is interesting because the model building of quintessence faces the same problem as inflation : it requires the quintessence field to be in a slow - roll phase which requires a flat potential . but",
    "this is rather difficult to achieve from a particle physics point of view .",
    "so the important feature of d - cceleration , i.e. slow - roll without a flat potential , is also very attractive as a quintessence candidate .",
    "however , the problem is that , assuming we still work with the potential ( [ 1.4 ] ) , the theory will make sense only under the condition that @xmath118 .",
    "so if we want to apply this model to the late universe , we must check that @xmath12 will satisfy @xmath118 after inflation for a wide range of initial conditions .",
    "although we still can not present a definite answer to this question , through numerical computation , we found that the evolution of @xmath12 will be extremely slowed down before it reaches @xmath117 .",
    "so this possibility still remains .",
    "following the same line of reasoning after the effective theory of tachyon is proposed , it is also interesting to consider the evolution of the d - cceleration in brane - world scenarios such as the well - studied randall - sundrum ii model @xcite .",
