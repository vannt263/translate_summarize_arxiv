    "the nature of the high velocity gas giving rise to the pedestal feature is thus difficult to assess .",
    "higher angular resolution observations are needed to investigate whether the high velocity emission arises from a collimated bipolar outflow driven by the recently formed massive stars or from an spherically symmetric structure possible driven either by stellar winds or by the expansion of the hii region onto the ambient medium .",

    "the relative contribution to the observed intensity is different from source to source . in g324.201",
    "the sio emission from the broad component dominates the spectrum , whereas in g330.949 the narrower emission is stronger .",
    "we suggest that , on the one hand , the narrow sio emission arises from the warm ambient gas surrounding the recently formed massive stars , and that this component results from the evaporation of silicon compounds from grain mantles produced by the stellar radiation .",
    "on the other hand , the broad sio emission most likely indicates mass outflows from a star or stars embedded within the massive core , and that this component results from grain disruption by shock waves .",
    "hence , the sio emission traces both high kinetic temperature ambient gas and outflowing shocked gas .",

    "the high - mass stars are found concentrated near the center of the core while intermediate mass stars are spread over much larger distances from the core center .",

    "the question arises as to whether the massive stars are formed in situ or if their spatial location is a result of dynamical effects .",
    "the characteristics of the cores derived here , namely their high densities , steep density profiles and sizes , together with the relatively low fraction of the total mass in the form of stars , suggest that dynamical friction ( also called gravitational drag ) produced by the gaseous background onto the stars may play an important role in the orbital evolution of stars ( ostriker 1999 , sanchez - salcedo & brandenburg 2001 , kim & kim 2007 ) .",
    "the role of gravitational drag on a gaseous background in the evolution and migration of stars within dense gaseous star forming clouds has been investigated using numerical smooth particle hydrodynamics simulations ( escala et al .",

    "this value is smaller than the estimated ages of the young clusters within the cores of @xmath42 1  myr ( see paper ii ) .",
    "since the migration timescales for dynamical friction are proportional to the inverse of the perturber s mass ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) , intermediate mass stars have migration timescales typically a factor @xmath42 10 longer than those of high mass stars and greater than the estimated age of the clusters . therefore , gravitational drag is considerably less effective for intermediate mass stars than for high mass stars .",
    "this suggest that in the young embedded stellar clusters only the massive stars have been able to efficiently migrate towards the center due to gravitational drag .",
    "we conclude that dynamical interactions of cluster members with the gaseous component of massive and dense cores can explain the observed mass segregation , indicating that the gas play an important role in the dynamic of young cluster members and originating the observed mass segregation .",
    "we can not rule out , however , the hypothesis that the cradles of massive stars are formed by direct accretion at the center of centrally condensed massive and dense cores ( mckee & tan 2003 ) . in their turbulent and pressurized dense core accretion model , the collapse of a massive and dense core is likely to produce the birth of a stellar cluster , with most of the mass going into relatively low - mass stars .",

    "the dust temperature of the norma cores are however larger than of the fandez et al . cores , for which they find an average temperature of 32 k. the larger values derived for the norma cores are consistent with them being centrally heated by more luminous objects ( average luminosity of @xmath172  @xmath28 ) .",
    "we find that the observed radial intensity profiles of the dust continuum emission from the norma cores are well fitted with single power - law profiles , with intensity indices in the range 1.5 to 1.9 .",
    "this in turn indicates that the cores are highly centrally condensed , having radial density profiles with power - law density indices in the range @xmath173 .",
    "these steep profiles are thought to indicate objects in the collapse and accretion phase of evolution .",
    "we find that under the physical conditions of the norma cores , high - mass stars can migrate towards the central region due to gravitational drag in time scales of @xmath174  yr , smaller than the estimated ages of the clusters , providing an explanation for the observed stellar mass segregation within the cores ( paper ii ) .",
