    "the observation of the cutoff in the spectrum of ultra - high energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) @xcite as predicted by @xcite provides compelling evidence for the shortening of the uhecr propagation length at high energies .",
    "the highest energy events then must have come from relatively close sources ( within @xmath2 mpc ) . at these",
    "length scales the matter in the universe is distributed inhomogeneously , being organized into clusters and superclusters .",
    "one should , therefore , expect the flux of highest - energy cosmic rays to be anisotropic .    in astrophysical scenarios , it is natural to assume that the number of sources within @xmath2  mpc is large , and that these sources trace the distribution of matter . under these assumptions ,",
    "the anisotropy at earth depends only on the nature and size of uhecr deflections .",
    "measurement of the anisotropy , therefore , gives direct experimental access to parameters that determine the deflections , notably to the uhecr charge composition and cosmic magnetic fields .",
    "several investigations of anisotropy in arrival directions of uhecrs have been previously undertaken . at small angular scales ,",
    "correlations with different classes of putative sources were claimed ( e.g. @xcite ) . at larger angular scales and energies below 10 eev possible",
    "anisotropy towards the galactic center was reported in @xcite , but not supported by more recent studies @xcite . at higher energies",
    ", @xcite found evidence against an isotropic flux above 40 eev through correlations with the supergalactic plane , but this was not confirmed by other authors @xcite .",
    "finally , using the pierre auger observatory ( pao ) data , @xcite have found correlations between uhecr arrival directions and the large - scale structure of the universe which are incompatible with an isotropic flux ( see , however , @xcite ) .    in this paper , we analyze the data accumulated by the hires experiment for anisotropy associated with the large - scale structure of the universe .",
    "the hires experiment has been described previously @xcite .",
    "it studied ultrahigh energy cosmic rays from @xmath3 ev to @xmath4 ev using the fluorescence technique .",
    "hires operated two fluorescence detectors located atop desert mountains in west - central utah .",
    "the data set used in this study consists of events observed by both detectors , analyzed jointly in what is commonly called `` stereo mode '' . in this mode",
    "the angular resolution in cosmic rays pointing directions is about @xmath5 degrees , and the energy resolution is about 10% .",
    "the hires experiment operated in stereo mode between december , 1999 , and april , 2006 . at the highest energies hires has the largest data set in the northern hemisphere .",
    "large number of events , good angular resolution ( better than the bending angles expected from galactic and extragalactic magnetic fields ) and the wide energy range covered make the hires data particularly suitable for anisotropy studies .",
    "the exact data set used in this study was described previously in @xcite .",
    "we consider here a generic model that assumes many sources within @xmath2  mpc tracing the distribution of matter , which we refer to as the `` matter tracer '' model .",
    "we also assume that deflections of uhecr do not exceed the angular size of the nearby structures , that is 10 - 20@xmath6 . in this regime , both regular and random deflections in magnetic fields",
    "can be modeled with a one - parameter distribution , for which we take a gaussian distribution centered at zero with width @xmath7 .",
    "this width is treated as a free parameter , whose value we aim to constrain from the data .",
    "constraints on @xmath8 may then be used to obtain information on the strength of galactic and extragalactic magnetic fields . in keeping with our assumption of small deflections , we assume a proton composition in this study , which is consistent with the @xmath9 analysis based on the same dataset ( for confirmation see @xcite ) .",
    "the hires data is compared to model predictions using the `` flux sampling '' test put forward by @xcite .",
    "this test has good discrimination power at small statistics and is insensitive to the details of deflections .",
    "the comparison is performed at three different threshold energies that have been used in previous studies : 10 eev , 40 eev , and 57 eev @xcite .",
    "an _ a priori _ significance of 5% , corresponding to a confidence level ( cl ) of 95% , is chosen for this work .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ section : modeling ]",
    "we discuss the modeling of uhecr arrival directions .",
    "section  [ section : data ] concerns the hires data used in the analysis , while section  [ section : fluxsampling ] describes the flux sampling method .",
    "we present our results in section  [ sec : results ] and conclude in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "_ galaxy catalog  _ the distribution of matter in the local universe is modeled with the 2 micron all - sky redshift survey ( 2mrs ; @xcite ) galaxy catalog , using galaxies as samplers of the underlying matter density field .",
    "the 2mrs is a flux - limited sample of galaxies , that is , the sample containing all galaxies with observed magnitude in the @xmath10 band @xmath11 .",
    "it contains spectroscopically measured redshifts for all but a few galaxies .",
    "a number of cuts have been applied to the galaxy sample .",
    "first , the galactic plane , where the sample is incomplete , has been excluded from the sample by removing all galaxies with @xmath12 .",
    "second , objects with @xmath13 mpc are removed because such objects should be treated on an individual basis . finally , the catalog is cut at 250  mpc because the sample becomes too sparse .",
    "the resulting sample provides an accurate statistical description at smearing angles @xmath14 . the flux from sources beyond 250  mpc is taken to be isotropic .",
    "a total of 15508 galaxies remain in the hires field of view after the cuts . to compensate for observational selection effects in the ( flux - limited ) 2mrs catalog , weights @xmath15",
    "are assigned to the galaxies with the sliding - box method as described in @xcite .",
    "_ energy loss  _ uhecr fluxes are affected by energy loss due to redshift and interactions with the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) . to account for the resulting flux suppression ,",
    "the integral flux , @xmath16 , from a single source is expressed as follows : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the threshold energy , @xmath19 is the source distance , @xmath20 stands for the integral injection spectrum at the source , and @xmath21 represents the flux fraction that remains after interactions and redshift .",
    "we take an injection spectrum @xmath22 extending to very high energies .",
    "the function @xmath21 is determined using a numerical propagation code based on the continuous loss approximation that is described in @xcite .",
    "energy loss due to interactions with the extragalactic background light is neglected . in figure",
    "[ fig : ffunc ] , top panel , the fraction @xmath21 is shown as a function of distance for the different energies considered in this work .",
    "the strength of the isotropic flux component that is added to account for sources beyond 250 mpc also depends on uhecr energy loss . using the computer code described in the previous paragraph",
    ", we estimate the fraction @xmath23 of total flux contributed by sources within 250 mpc to be 0.4 , 0.7 , and 1.0 for threshold energies @xmath24 eev , 40 eev , and 57 eev , respectively ( see figure 1 , bottom panel ) .",
    "_ deflections  _ uhecr protons ( as well as nuclei ) are deflected by galactic and intergalactic magnetic fields .",
    "these deflections are taken into account by an angular smearing procedure , which replaces the point - source flux , @xmath25 , by a flux density distribution : @xmath26 where @xmath27 represents the probability density that an uhecr is deflected by @xmath28 , the angle between galaxy @xmath29 and the line of sight .",
    "this procedure also accounts for the detector s angular resolution and prevents unphysical fluctuations due to the use of a catalog of point sources . in the absence of detailed knowledge on the structure of galactic and extragalactic magnetic fields ,",
    "we adopt a simple gaussian probability density distribution with characteristic angle , @xmath7 .",
    "this angle is treated as a free model parameter .",
    "the gaussian distribution is a fair approximation when the deflections are small . for large deflections , details on the structure of the galactic and extragalactic magnetic fields",
    "become important .",
    "accounting for these details goes beyond the scope of the present study .",
    "_ exposure  _ the hires exposure is modeled using our monte carlo simulation of the experiment @xcite .",
    "the aim of this simulation was to create a set of monte carlo events that would be in all essences identical to the actual data . in making the simulation we put in the properties of cosmic ray air showers as measured by previous experiments @xcite .",
    "we used cosmic ray showers generated by the corsika and qgsjet programs @xcite and simulated the generation of fluorescence light ( see references in @xcite ) and its propagation through the atmosphere ( see references in @xcite ) .",
    "a complete simulation of the optics and electronics ( trigger and front - end electronics ) of our detectors was performed .",
    "the result was an excellent simulation of our experiment as evidenced by the very good agreement between data and simulated events in the distribution of all kinematic variables , e.g. zenith angle , impact parameter to detector , etc . by assigning monte carlo events times of occurrence taken from the actual on - time of the experiment",
    "we are able to calculate the exposure on the sky very accurately .",
    "_ model flux maps  _ the integral uhecr flux from a given direction is expressed as follows : @xmath30 where @xmath29 enumerates galaxies in the 2mrs sample , @xmath31 denotes the weight assigned to galaxy @xmath29 in the catalog , @xmath32 is the deflection probability distribution , and @xmath33 is the uhecr flux arising from sources beyond 250 mpc .    the probability to observe a cr from a given direction is proportional to the product of flux and exposure .",
    "we denote this probability as @xmath34 where @xmath35 stands for exposure . in figure",

    "our sample of the 2mrs catalog does not cover the region near the galactic plane with @xmath12 .",
    "we therefore removed cosmic ray events with @xmath12 from the analysis .",
    "the resulting sample contains :    * 309 events with @xmath38  eev ; * 27 events with @xmath39  eev ; * 10 events with @xmath40  eev .",

    "the compatibility of a model flux map with the set of uhecr arrival directions is quantified by the flux sampling method introduced by @xcite .",
    "the idea of the method is as follows . to any set of arrival directions one",
    "associates the set of flux values that are obtained by sampling a given flux map ( such as the map shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : skymap : struct ] ) , i.e. by extracting the flux values at corresponding points on the sphere .",
    "the two - dimensional distribution of arrival directions thus translates into a one - dimensional distribution of flux values .",
    "if the reference model is true , this flux distribution will tend to high values since events fall preferentially into regions where the model flux ( times exposure ) is high .",
    "if , on the other hand , the reference model is not true , the flux distribution is more uniform because the correlation between arrival directions and regions of high model flux is ( partly ) destroyed . by comparing the flux distribution to a model flux distribution , the compatibility between a set of arrival directions and model predictions can be quantified .",
    "this comparison is performed by the kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test , which yields a test statistic @xmath41 .",
    "the relevant statistical quantities , in particular powers and @xmath42-values , are computed from the distribution of this test statistic .",
    "note that this test does not involve any additional parameters like bin size .",
    "the ability of the test to discriminate between models may be quantified in terms of the statistical power , @xmath43 , i.e. the probability to rule out , at a given confidence level , the reference model when an alternative model is true .",
    "within numerical uncertainties , the statistical power is equal to the fraction of event sets generated under the alternative model that leads to rejecting the reference model .",
    "figure  [ fig : power - nvsths ] shows the number of events required for a power @xmath44 ( i.e. , a 50% probability ) to rule out ( at 95% cl ) the matter tracer model when the true flux is isotropic .",
    "the number of events increases with increasing smearing angle and decreasing energy : the decreasing flux contrasts in the matter tracer model call for an increase in statistics to achieve the same discriminatory power .",
    "observe that the event numbers indicated in figure  [ fig : power - nvsths ] are of the same order as the data analyzed in this work .",
    "we thus expect that there is sufficient data to obtain meaningful constraints at 95% cl .",
    "the level of compatibility between data and model predictions is quantified by a @xmath42-value , which represents the model probability of obtaining a measurement that is at least as extreme as the actual measurement . with our _ a priori _ choice of significance , a @xmath42-value smaller than @xmath45 rules out the model .",
    "the probability of falsely excluding the model is then @xmath46% , translating to a cl of @xmath47% .",
    "figure [ fig : pvalues ] shows the @xmath42-values obtained by the flux sampling method for the hires data and predictions of the matter tracer model .",
    "the smearing angle , @xmath7 , is treated as a free parameter .",
    "that is , at each value of @xmath7 and each threshold energy a flux map is generated and compared to the hires data as described above .",
    "the results can be summarized as follows :    * for the threshold energies of 40 eev and 57 eev , the tests show disagreement between data and the matter tracer model for @xmath48 . within this parameter range ,",
    "a source distribution tracing the distribution of matter is excluded at a 95% confidence level .",
    "* for the threshold energy of 10 eev , the test shows agreement between data and the matter tracer model .",
    "the incompatibility between data and matter tracer model is illustrated by the non - correlation between the observed arrival directions and regions of high model flux shown in the two lower panels of figure [ fig : skymap : struct ] .",
    "we have also tested the data for compatibility with an isotropic model flux and found no disagreement , at 95% cl , for any of the three tested threshold energies ( the data with threshold energy 57 eev are marginally consistent with an isotropic flux ) .      at energy threshold @xmath51  eev a correlation between the arrival directions of uhecrs and the location of agns contained in the 12@xmath52 edition of the vron - cetty & vron catalog",
    "was reported by the pao @xcite .",
    "this correlation was found to be maximal for @xmath53 , where @xmath54 denotes the maximum angular distance between uhecrs and agns . in the northern hemisphere ,",
    "correlation with agn was not confirmed by the hires experiment @xcite .    since agns are tracers of the distribution of matter in the universe , the pao result is suggestive of a more general correlation between uhecrs and the local structure of the universe on an angular scale of a few degrees .",
    "the methods presented in this paper allow a check on the existence of such correlations in the hires data .",
    "the results presented in the previous section disfavor a correlation between uhecrs and the local structure of the universe . in fact , the flux sampling test yields @xmath42-values smaller than @xmath55 for the matter tracer model with @xmath56 , with a @xmath42-value of @xmath57 for @xmath58 .",
    "( note that @xmath7 is not in @xmath59 correspondence with @xmath54 ; both quantities are however representative of the angular scale of the problem ) .",
    "focusing on the case of @xmath60 in more detail , figure [ fig : ddist ] shows the distribution of the test statistic @xmath41 for the matter tracer model and for an isotropic flux for this smearing angle .",
    "the vertical line shows the value @xmath61 obtained for the hires data .",
    "this demonstrates the strong incompatiblity between hires data and the matter tracer model for smearing angle @xmath58 and threshold energy @xmath62 eev .",
    "to summarize , we have confronted the stereo data collected by the hires experiment with predictions of the matter tracer model , a generic model of cosmic ray origin and propagation .",
    "the model assumes a large number of cosmic ray sources within @xmath2  mpc whose distribution traces that of matter , and relatively small deflections characterized by a single parameter , the typical deflection angle @xmath0 .",
    "we have found that the hires data with energy thresholds @xmath63  eev and @xmath62  eev are incompatible with the matter tracer model for @xmath64 at 95%  cl . with an energy threshold @xmath24",
    "eev the hires data are compatible with the matter tracer model .",
    "at all three energy thresholds , the data are compatible with an isotropic flux at 95%  cl .    in the present analysis",
    "we have treated the deflections as random and gaussian , which is only appropriate for small deflection angles and limited number of events .",
    "the actual deflections are expected to contain a coherent component due to the galactic magnetic field . with the accumulation of uhecr events by pao in the southern hemisphere and by telescope array in the northern hemisphere ,",
    "our analysis will become sensitive to the nature of deflections and thus , with proper modifications of the statistical procedure , may give direct access to the parameters of cosmic magnetic fields .",
