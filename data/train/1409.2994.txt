    "the study of non - equilibrium quantum systems is among the most rapidly expanding areas of theoretical physics . triggered by the remarkable experimental progress in manipulating trapped ultra - cold atomic gases , there is recently great interest in the search for universal properties of such systems ( see e.g. @xcite for a review ) .",
    "much attention is devoted to the behavior of quantum systems after a quench and in particular , on the nature of the equilibrium state which is approached in this case .",
    "other interesting studies concern the impact of both internal and space - time symmetries ( e.g. scale invariance ) on the quantum transport in non - equilibrium steady states ( ness ) .",
    "in this paper we investigate some general features of the energy transport in ness s , representing non - equilibrium extensions of a gibbs state ( gs ) .",
    "the physical models we focus on are schematically shown in fig .",
    "we are dealing with a multicomponent system represented by the @xmath0 semi - infinite leads ( edges ) @xmath1 of a star graph @xmath2 .",
    "each lead @xmath1 is attached at infinity to a heat reservoir @xmath3 .",
    "the interaction between the @xmath4 components of the system is localized in the vertex of the graph and is defined by a scattering matrix @xmath5 . each heat reservoir @xmath3",

    "the state @xmath10 is fully determined by @xmath5 and @xmath11 .",
    "we show that @xmath10 is not invariant under parity and time - reversal transformations and generates therefore a nontrivial orbit @xmath12 , consisting of four nonequivalent ness s .",
    "the total energy of the system in these states has two components : heat energy ( parametrized by @xmath6 ) and chemical potential energy ( parametrized by @xmath7 ) .",
    "provided that the dynamics of the system is invariant under time translations , the total energy is conserved . for generic values of @xmath11",

    "is strongly influenced by nonlinear phenomena , the well known linear response approximation is not suitable for our investigation because it covers only a little part of the parameter space .",
    "for this reason a fundamental objective of our study is to simplify as much as possible the dynamics in order to solve the problem in exact form , preserving at the same time a nontrivial quantum transport . in this respect",
    "we demonstrate that assuming free propagation along @xmath1 and scale - invariant point - like interactions in the vertex is enough for this purpose .",
    "we study both fermionic and bosonic systems , showing that the particle statistics affects the energy transmutation .",
    "the detailed comparison between the two cases is very instructive , because the bosonic case is poorly investigated .",
    "the impact of parity and time reversal on the quantum transport is discussed in detail as well .",
    "we proceed as follows . in the next section we briefly recall the construction of the ness @xmath10 and its orbit @xmath17 under parity and time reversal transformations . in section 3",

    "the basic features of this process of energy transmutation are investigated in section 4 , where we introduce the efficiency coefficients for both cases @xmath16 .",
    "we describe here also the scale invariant ( critical ) interactions in the junction . the efficiency of the quantum transport for a system with two leads is investigated in section 5 both for the lb state @xmath10 and the orbit @xmath17 .",
    "we also relate here our approach to some exact results , concerning other systems and ness s . in section 6",

    "we briefly recall an explicit quantum field theory construction @xcite of the landauer - bttiker ( lb ) state @xmath10 , which adapts to the star graph case some general ideas @xcite-@xcite about ness s .",

    "as mentioned in the introduction , the elements of this orbit represent new nonequivalent ness s with interesting physical properties .",
    "the first step in constructing the lb state @xmath10 is to describe the asymptotic dynamics at @xmath18 ( i.e. before the interaction ) in terms of the operators @xmath19 which create and annihilate the particle excitations with momentum @xmath20 in the reservoir @xmath3 . in agreement with the orientation of the leads in fig.1",
    ", the condition @xmath21 implies that ( [ in ] ) create and annihilate incoming particles . for fermionic systems ( [ in ] ) generate therefore an incoming canonical anti - commutation relations ( car ) algebra @xmath22 .",

    "we have to introduce the interaction , connecting different heat reservoirs and driving the system away from equilibrium .",
    "we consider the simple case where the incoming particles propagate freely along the leads towards the vertex of the graph , where they are reflected or transmitted with some probability in the rest of the graph .",
    "this process is codified in the reflection - transmission equations @xmath27 which relate @xmath22 and @xmath25 . here",
    "@xmath28 is the scattering matrix describing the point - like interaction in the vertex of the graph .",

    "the non - equilibrium features of the correlation functions are encoded in the mixing of the fermi distributions , associated with the different heat reservoirs @xmath3 , via the scattering matrix @xmath5 , which is evident already from ( [ cor1 ] ) .",
    "an advantage of the above framework is that it allows to investigate directly the behavior of the lb state @xmath10 under parity and time reversal .",
    "we first recall that these operations are implemented by a unitary operator @xmath45 and an anti - unitary operator @xmath46 , acting in the algebra @xmath32 in the standard way : @xmath47 apart from the multiplicative phase factors , the action of @xmath45 and @xmath46 seems to be the same , but one should remember that @xmath45 is a linear operator , whereas @xmath46 is anti - linear . using the explicit form ( [ cor1 ] ) of the two - point function and ( [ pt ] ) , one can explicitly verify that @xmath48 if @xmath9 for some reservoirs .",

    "the result ( [ xcorr ] ) suggests also that the four states in the orbit @xmath12 have different transport properties , which is confirmed by the analysis in section 5.2 below . since time reversal symmetry is the quantum counterpart of classical reversibility",
    ", one can interpret the breakdown of this symmetry in the lb representation @xmath36 as quantum irreversibility .",
    "we conclude by observing that above construction can be easily generalized to bosons by replacing the car algebra with a canonical commutation algebra ( cca ) , which implies the substitution of the fermi distribution in ( [ cor1 ] ) with the bose distribution : @xmath52}}{1- \\e^{-\\beta_i \\left [ \\omega_i ( k ) -\\mu_i\\right ] } } \\ , .",

    "quantum systems away from equilibrium behave usually in a complicated way . in",
    "most of the cases the linear response or other approximations are not enough for fully describing the complexity of this behavior .",
    "for this reason the existence of models which incorporate the main non - equilibrium features , while being sufficiently simple to be analyzed exactly , is conceptually very important .",
    "an interesting family of such models in @xmath53 space dimensions is characterized by requiring that the interaction , which drives the system away from equilibrium , is localized on a @xmath54-dimensional sub - manifold , whereas the propagation in the complementary orthogonal direction is free . in what follows",
