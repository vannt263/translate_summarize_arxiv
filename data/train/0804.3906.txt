    "work on extending stochastic processes characterized by a single index to corresponding processes with two indices or processes with variable index has attracted considerable interest lately .",
    "for example , fractional brownian motion parametrized by a constant hurst index @xmath0 has recently been generalized to the bifractional brownian motion @xcite characterized by two indices , with fractional brownian motion as a special case .",
    "a process with two indices provides a more flexible model as far as applications are concerned .",
    "fractional brownian motion has also been extended to multifractional brownian motion with a variable index @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "multifractional brownian motion allows one to model phenomena with variable memory and fractal dimension that changes with time or position .",
    "another example is the process of cauchy class @xcite , which has been extended to the process with two - indices known as generalized cauchy process @xcite .",
    "in contrast to many other single - index processes ( for example , fractional brownian motion ) , generalized cauchy process has the advantage that its two indices separately characterize the fractal dimension or self - similar property and the long range dependence .",
    "the aim of this paper is to introduce a new type of fractional gaussian process indexed by two parameters so that its short range dependence property and fractal dimension can be separately characterized .",
    "such a process can be regarded as a generalization of fractional oscillator process or fractional ornstein - uhlenbeck process with single index @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 introduces the generalized fractional oscillator process as solution of a stochastic differential equation with two fractional orders . despite the covariance of this process",
    "does not have a closed analytic form , its basic properties can be studied by considering the asymptotic properties of its covariance . in particular ,",
    "the fractal dimension and short range dependence are studied . the fluctuation ",
    "dissipation relation are discussed in section 4 . in section 5",
    ", we consider the fractional oscillator process as one - dimensional euclidean fractional scalar field .",
    "stochastic quantization of the field at zero and finite temperature is carried out .",
    "we proceed to calculate the casimir energy associated with the fractional field at finite temperature by employing the zeta function regularization technique . in the last section ,",
    "we briefly discuss possible generalizations of the results obtained .",
    "in this section we define the fractional oscillator process with two indices .",
    "recall that an ordinary oscillator process @xmath2 can be obtained as a solution to the langevin equation @xmath3where @xmath4 is the standard white noise with @xmath5@xmath6 is the standard brownian motion , and @xmath7 is a positive constant . using fourier transform ,",
    "the solution of can be written as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the fourier transform of the standard white noise @xmath10 : @xmath11 in the literature , @xmath2 is known as the oscillator process or the ornstein  uhlenbeck process .",
    "it is a centered stationary gaussian process with covariance function @xmath12 one can also regard the oscillator process @xmath2 as one - dimensional euclidean scalar klein ",
    "gordon field with mass @xmath7 , and propagator given by the spectral density @xmath13    since fractal dynamics @xcite have increasingly played an important role in various transport phenomena in complex media , it would be interesting to investigate various possible generalizations of @xmath2 to its fractional counterpart .",
    "one direct way is to replace the differential operator @xmath14 in by the fractional differential operator @xmath15 to obtain the following type i fractional langevin equation @xcite : @xmath16where the fractional derivative @xmath15 is defined as @xcite : @xmath17 when @xmath18 , @xmath19 is known as the riemann  liouville fractional derivative ; and for @xmath20 , @xmath21 is called the weyl fractional derivative .",
    "another possible generalization is to fractionalize the operator @xmath22 to obtain the following type ii fractional langevin equation @xcite:@xmath23recently we have combined the investigation on these two type of processes and study the more general case @xcite : @xmath24 if weyl fractional derivative is used in , then for @xmath25 , @xmath26 turns out to be a centered stationary gaussian process with a representation @xmath27and covariance function latexmath:[\\]]where @xmath435and follows .",
