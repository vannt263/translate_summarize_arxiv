    "<S> we discuss the crystallization process from the supersaturated melt in terms of its non - equilibrium properties . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we quantify the amount of heat that is produced irreversibly when a suspension of hard spheres crystallizes . </S>",
    "<S> this amount of heat can be interpreted as arising from the resistance of the system against undergoing phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> we identify an intrinsic compression rate that separates a quasi - static regime from a regime of rapid crystallization . in the former </S>",
    "<S> the disspated heat grows linearly in the compression rate . in the latter the system crystallizes more easily , because new relaxation channels are opened , at the cost of forming a higher fraction of non - equilibrium crystal structures . in analogy to a shear - thinning fluid , the system shows a decreased resistance when it is driven rapidly .    </S>",
    "<S> crystallization from the metastable melt is a non - equilibrium process . </S>",
    "<S> yet , it is usually discussed in terms of quasi - equilibrium concepts such as transition state theory @xcite , which do not account for the fact that any irreversible process of finite duration is inevitably subject to dissipation . here , we present a numerical approach to assess the amount of energy that is dissipated in a crystallization process , and we discuss the relation between dissipation and external driving .    the most obvious way to characterize the irreversibility of a process is to quantify entropy production . </S>",
    "<S> however , to do so directly is unpractical even for very simple model systems . to bypass this problem , we instead evaluate the mechanical work performed on the system by compressing it at a constant rate , and subtract the equilibrium work , which we obtain independently via the equation of state .    as a model system </S>",
    "<S> we use hard spheres , the most simple system that shows a liquid - to - crystal transition @xcite . despite their simplicity </S>",
    "<S> hard spheres capture the essential physics of the crystallization process in many atomic systems . in general , at high densities </S>",
    "<S> the excluded volume between atoms dominates their dynamical behaviour , because the typical interparticle distances are smaller than the attraction ranges . </S>",
    "<S> the attractive forces thus effectively only add up to a flat background that does not influence the dynamics , but merely changes the equilibrium equation of state @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus the results from our study should be applicable to a large class of crystallization processes in metallic systems as well as colloids .    to model the crystallization process </S>",
    "<S> , we perform computer simulations of hard spheres in the npt ensemble . the system is prepared in a fluid equilibrium state at constant pressure and then subjected to an increase in pressure with a constant rate @xmath0 for a duration @xmath1 . under these conditions </S>",

    "<S> the dissipated energy @xmath14 is indicated by the shaded areas . </S>",
    "<S> it consists of three contributions : ( i ) is the work associated with compression of the metastable liquid phase until the nucleation event occurs ; ( iii ) is a contribution that arises because the system is not completely transformed into the equilibrium crystal during the simulation time , but contains defects . </S>",
    "<S> this contribution results in an almost constant offset in volume with respect to the equation of state of the equilibrium crystal , which does not vary much between trajectories for any given @xmath15 . </S>",

    "<S> we monitor the degree of crystallinity by means of the local @xmath31 bond order parameter @xcite . in order to distinguish different crystal structures we analyze the averaged bond order parameters @xmath32 and @xmath33 @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> we set the induction time @xmath8 to the time after which the largest crystalline cluster maintains a size of ten or more particles . </S>",
    "<S> the end of the process , @xmath34 , is set to the time when the overall crystallinity reaches @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> this value is large enough to capture the main contributions of dissipated heat , but still small enough to minimize the influence of periodic boundary conditions .    </S>",
    "<S> since rare trajectories can contribute considerably to the non - equilibrium work distribution , we need to generate a very large number of independent trajectories . as the computational effort is large ( @xmath36 trajectories per value of compression rate ) , we simulate a relatively small system of @xmath37 particles , a system size that , albeit small , still reproduces the nucleation rates correctly . to verify this , we compared the nucleation rates to those obtained from simulations with @xmath38 and @xmath39 particles @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> , the jarzinsky relation connects the work distribution @xmath65 to the equilibrium free energy difference @xmath5 , @xmath66 since the average is over the exponential of @xmath2 , the jarzynski relation provides a very sensitive test for the accuracy of sampling .    for distributions @xmath65 that are superpositions of gaussian distributions , eq .  </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : qc_dist ] shows the distribution of dissipated energy per particle , @xmath11 , for various values of the compression rate @xmath15 . as the compression rate increases , the distribution shifts to higher average @xmath70 and broadens . at the highest compression rate we simulated </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath70 is about @xmath71 , which is of the same order of magnitude as the average ( macroscopic ) interfacial energy over the area per particle , @xmath72 @xcite . in the right panel of the figure </S>",
    "<S> we show that the distributions collapse for weak driving @xmath15 , when plotted in terms of the reduced variable @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> this collapse defines the regime of quasi - static behaviour , where the response @xmath69 of the system is independent of the driving force .    </S>",
    "<S> in the context of equilibrium thermodynamics the term `` quasi - static '' is restricted to the case of infinitely slow driving , @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of a regime of @xmath15-independent distributions of @xmath69 justifies the extension of this notion to finite ( small ) driving rates . </S>",
    "<S> the limiting value of the average response @xmath74 attained for @xmath75 can be interpreted as an immanent system property , the _ quasi - static crystallization loss_. for the hard - sphere system , we obtain @xmath76 .     </S>",
    "<S> crystallization loss , i.e , , the average energy per particle dissipated during crystallization relative to the external driving rate,@xmath77 as a function of compression rate @xmath15 . ]    at driving forces above a threshold @xmath78 the crystallization loss @xmath79 , as a function of @xmath15 , drops sharply ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : central]).(if one took into account the energy costs due to defects in the crystal ( contribution  ( iii ) in fig .  [ fig : trajectory ] ) this effect would even be enhanced , since the excess volume over the equilibrium volume @xmath80 ( used to define @xmath11 ) increases monotonically with increasing @xmath15 . ) </S>",
    "<S> intuitively , one would expect the relative dissipation to increase once the rate of driving exceeds typical microscopic relaxation times of the system , as additional work can be dissipated through the microscopic degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> the counter - intuitive behaviour of the crystallization loss can be rationalized by analogy with mechanical friction in fluids . there </S>",
    "<S> , one typically observes friction to decrease strongly in the nonlinear - response regime of fast driving @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is particularly well known for the viscosity of non - newtonian fluids @xcite , where the effect is called shear thinning . </S>",
    "<S> it also holds for a driven tracer subject to an external force in a dense fluid @xcite . in these cases , </S>",
    "<S> the slow near - equilibrium relaxation processes are replaced by faster ones that occur on the time scale set by the external driving . in analogy , we interpret @xmath79 as a generalized friction coefficient that characterizes the melt s resistance to phase transformation .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath79 shows non - monotonic behaviour because both effects , i.e. , increased friction through enhanced coupling to microscopic degrees of freedom as well as decreased friction through non - equilibrium relaxation channels , contribute to the crystallization loss . as indicated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : qc_dist ] , the initial increase is associated with an increase in the large-@xmath11 tail . </S>",
    "<S> this is intuitively expected since an increased coupling to microscopic degrees of freedom increases the probability for stronlgy dissipating trajectories . at @xmath81 </S>",
    "<S> , this large-@xmath11 tail is cut off . </S>",
    "<S> ( we will show in the following that this effect is due to the formation of non - equilibrium crystal structures . ) </S>",
    "<S> the crossover between the two trends occurs around @xmath82.this cross - over value is explained by the time scale @xmath83 needed for collective particle rearrangements involving the nearest and next - to - nearest neighbour shells . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath83 is set by the long - time self - diffusion coefficient @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> for the typical densities reached when crystallization sets in , @xmath85 ( for the initial fluid state in our work , @xmath86 ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence , @xmath87 ; i.e.  the effects of the external driving start to dominate the crystallization process once the compression rate is faster than the typical thermal energy density can be redistributed through collective particle rearrangements .    </S>",
    "<S> distribution of the time interval over which the system crystallizes , for different @xmath15 corresponding to the data shown in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> vertical lines indicate the maximum @xmath88 possible in the simulation for the earliest induction time @xmath8 observed in our simulations , for the highest two @xmath15 shown . ]    to demonstrate that the melt indeed relaxes faster into the crystal phase at @xmath81 , we show in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : histo_dt ] the distributions of the crystallization time @xmath88 ( i.e.  the distributions of the length of time between the induction time and the time when 60% of the system are crystallized ) . for small @xmath15 , </S>",
    "<S> the distributions again collapse to a @xmath15-independent curve . </S>",
    "<S> this curve displays a pronounced tail at large @xmath88 , and the crystallization process is slow on the time scale @xmath13 of free particle diffusion . </S>",
    "<S> the average @xmath89 is approximately @xmath90 , i.e.  on the order of the long - time self - diffusion time @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> this fact confirms that long - time diffusion sets the relevant time scale for the crystallization process . at large @xmath15 , the distributions shift to smaller average @xmath88 , and the large-@xmath88 tail is cut off . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , @xmath91 narrows proportionally to @xmath15 , which suggests that the inverse external driving rate @xmath92 sets the relevant time scale for the dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the change in shape of the distribution @xmath91 with @xmath15 is qualitatively similar to the one observed for the distribution @xmath93 shown in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> next we show that the accelerated crystallization mechanism proceeds through non - equilibrium relaxation channels , in particular the formation of non - equilibrium crystal structures ( bcc instead of fcc ) . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : bcc_dist ] shows the probability distribution of the fraction of particles with a bcc - like environment in the crystal at the end of the simulation run . </S>",
    "<S> again , at slow driving rates , @xmath94 , the distributions are independent of @xmath15 . for @xmath95 , </S>",
    "<S> more bcc structures are formed . </S>",
    "<S> there even is a signifiant number of runs that crystallize completely into bcc . </S>",
    "<S> our data indicate that the formation of bcc - like structures is facilitated at large compression rates . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the question why fcc is the stable equilibrium structure while bcc should form more easily is known from landau theory @xcite . there , the effect arises because a larger set of reciprocal lattice vectors is needed to form fcc . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that a larger set of local density fluctuations needs to be sampled . </S>",
    "<S> it is conceivable that this takes more time , and hence , bcc is favored kinetically .    the tendency to form metastable crystal structures in rapid solidification </S>",
    "<S> is well known from metallic melts @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is often attributed to oswald s step rule , which invokes interfaction tensions between the crystal nucleus and the surrounding fluid . </S>",
    "<S> we offer an alternative explanation that is founded on microscopic kinetic arguments , rather than macroscopic thermodynamic quantities that might not be well defined on the scale of a few particle diameters . </S>"
