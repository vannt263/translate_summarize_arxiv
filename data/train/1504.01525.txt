    "this paper is part of a general study about the feasibility of the forecast of meteorological parameters and optical turbulence at eso sites ( cerro paranal and cerro armazones ) in the framework of the mose project ( modeling eso sites ) .",
    "the mose project is presented extensively in a previous paper @xcite .",
    "we only recall here that the mose project aims at proving the feasibility of the forecast of all the most relevant classical atmospherical parameters for astronomical applications ( wind speed intensity and direction , temperature , relative humidity ) and the optical turbulence ot ( @xmath0 profiles ) with the integrated astro - climatic parameters derived from the @xmath0 i.e. the seeing ( @xmath1 ) , the isoplanatic angle ( @xmath2 ) , the wavefront coherence time ( @xmath3 ) above the two eso sites of cerro paranal ( site of the very large telescope - vlt ) and cerro armazones ( site selected for the european extremely large telescope - e - elt ) .",
    "+ the final outcome of the project is to investigate the opportunity to implement an automatic system for the forecast of these parameters at the vlt observatory at cerro paranal and at the e - elt observatory at cerro armazones .",
    "+ in a previous paper @xcite , we presented results of a deep analysis of the bias and rmse between observations and model outputs of absolute temperature , wind speed and direction above both astronomical sites ( paranal and armazones ) .",
    "these statistical operators provide fundamental informations on systematic and statistical model errors .",
    "this statistical study was performed on a sample of 20 nights , the same for each site .",
    "a part of the nights is coming from the par2007 campaign @xcite , and the sample was completed with nights with available observations from the same period of the year . in the same study we also provided a detailed analysis on the model performances on individual nights .",
    "the most important results we obtained can be summarized as in the following .",
    "the model showed a very good score of success in terms of bias and rmse for absolute temperature ( median bias in the [ 0.03,0.64]@xmath4c range and median rmse in the [ 0.64,0.93]@xmath4c range ) and wind direction ( median bias in the [ -1.01,-8.55]@xmath4 range and median rmse in the [ 30,41]@xmath4 range for a wind speed threshold of 2  @xmath5 equivalent to a rmse@xmath6 in the [ 17,23]@xmath7 range ) when it is used in grid - nesting configuration and the horizontal resolution of the innermost model domain is 500  m. to obtain equivalent satisfactory results for the wind speed we need to use a horizontal resolution of the innermost model domain equal to 100  m. under this condition we obtained a median bias within 0.93  @xmath5 and a median rmse within 2.18  @xmath5 .",
    "these results were , in conclusion , very promising .",
    "+ in this paper the preliminary analysis done by @xcite was extended to a sample of 129 nights uniformly distributed between 2007 and 2011 .",
    "the analysis is performed for the cerro paranal case .",
    "it was possible to have access to homogeneous measurements distributed over such a long period of time , only at this site .",
    "all the 129 nights belong to different periods of the year , and not only to summer ( like for the sample of 20 nights from @xcite ) .",
    "this permits us to analyze definitely the robustness of the model on a rich statistical sample , independently from the period of the year considered .",
    "all the measurements , at cerro paranal , are part of the vlt astronomical site monitor @xcite .",
    "+ besides that , on the same sample of nights , we present a complementary statistical analysis based on a different approach .",
    "indeed , it is worth to highlight that bias and rmse , in spite to be fundamental statistical operators providing key informations on model performances , do not answer to the necessary information one would like to have in terms of model performances @xcite .",
    "a key rule in the complex art of the model prediction estimation is that it makes no sense to quantify the model performance with one parameter only or one method only . to investigate the quality of a model prediction , a method widely used in physics of the atmosphere as well as in other fields such as economy and medicine , consists in constructing and analyzing contingency tables . from these tables",
    "one can derive a number of different parameters that describe the quality of the model performances .",
    "+ a contingency table allows for the analysis of the relationship between two or more categorical variables .",
    "one of the first classic examples of a forecast verification using contingency tables is the tornado forecast from @xcite .",
    "a contingency table is a table with @xmath8 entries that displays the distribution of modeled outputs and observations in terms of frequencies or relative frequencies .",
    "here the variables we considered are the observations of different categories of temperature , wind speed , wind direction , near the surface , and the respective reconstructed parameters by the meso - nh model .",
    "+ in this part of chile the weather is particularly dry , the relative humidity ( rh ) in the surface layer is typically below 30@xmath7 .",
    "the frequency of the nights with a relative humidity above 80@xmath7 , level at which the dome of the telescope has to be closed and observations are not allowed , is definitely very low ( typically less than 5 nights for year ) . in all the other nights",
    "the rh does not really represent a critical issue in terms of scheduling of observations because the rh value is not high enough to affect the observations .",
    "the study of the relative humidity close to the ground is therefore not very critical and important for telescopes in this region .",
    "also it has been observed in occasion of the tmt site characterization in this region ( t. travouillon , private communication ) , that the reliability of the relative humidity measurements , when values are so low , can hardly be assured .",
    "this makes difficult ( and mostly useless ) to investigate the model performances in reconstructing the rh on the same sample of nights selected for the analysis of the other parameters .",
    "a more interesting analysis might be to check the model performances in reconstructing the rh values in those few nights in each year where rh is higher than the threshold imposing to close the dome of the telescope .",
    "in annex we report satisfactory results obtained in this sense . + in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we describe the model configuration defined for this study . in section [ sec3 ] we report the bias and rmse obtained for the new sample of 129 nights , at cerro paranal . in section [ sec4 ]",
    "we define what is a contingency table for different discretized values @xmath9 of observations and predictions and which parameters qualifying the model behavior can be retrieved from them . in section [ sec : climato ] we describe the criteria we used to identify the thresholds separating the @xmath9 categories . in sections",
    "[ sec6 ] , [ sec7 ] and [ sec8 ] we provide the results in terms of model performances ( reconstruction of the absolute temperature , the wind speed and direction in the 0 - 30  m range ) . finally conclusions are drawn in section [ sec9 ] .",
    "the 129 nights have been selected starting with the 20 nights of @xcite .",
    "those 20 nights were all concentrated in november and december 2007 ( the reader can refer to @xcite to understand how this first sample was constructed ) .",
    "when results obtained with the sample of 20 nights indicated a very promising model behavior , to have a better evaluation of the model performances in statistical terms , it was decided to extend this sample to a more consistent one .",
    "two different periods , distant in time , were arbitrarily chosen ( the only constraint was the availability of continuous measurements ) : 1/from january 2007 to december 2007 and 2/from june 2010 to may 2011 .",
    "we tried to select nights that were regularly spaced in time , as much as possible , in order to cover all the four seasons ( which are characterized by slightly different meteorological behaviours ) .",
    "the result was 55 nights in 2007 ( the 20 ones mentioned above , plus around 3 nights per month ) , and 74 nights in 2010 - 2011 ( around 6 nights per month ) .",
    "no specific criterium has been used on the goodness of the weather conditions . in other words ,",
    "nights include good and/or bad weather conditions therefore no specific bias affects the sample .",
    "all these nights were characterized by different conditions of wind speed , temperature and relative humidity ( see discussion in section [ sec3 ] ) .",
    "all the numerical simulations of the nights ( 129 in total ) presented in this study have been performed with the mesoscale numerical weather model meso - nh:@xmath10-@xmath11 @xcite and the astro - meso - nh code for the optical turbulence @xcite .",
    "the model has been developed by the centre national des recherches mtorologiques ( cnrm ) and laboratoire darologie ( la ) from universit paul sabatier ( toulouse ) .",
    "the meso - nh model can simulate the temporal evolution of three - dimensional meteorological parameters over a selected finite area of the globe .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite , sec .",
    "3.3 , for the general model configuration and the physical packages used for this study .",
    "we just recall here that we used the grid - nesting technique @xcite , that consists in using different imbricated domains of the digital elevation models ( dem i.e orography ) extended on smaller and smaller surfaces , with increasing horizontal resolution but with the same vertical grid . in this study",
    "we use two different configurations . the first grid - nesting configuration employed three domains ( table  [ tab : config ] ) and",
    "the innermost resolution is @xmath12  =  500  m. the second configuration is made of four imbricated domains , the first same three as the previous configuration , plus one centered at cerro paranal site , with a horizontal resolution of @xmath12  =  100  m ( all domains of table  [ tab : config ] ) . along the z - axis",
    "we have 62 levels distributed as follows : a first vertical grid point equal to 5  m , a logarithmic stretching of 20  @xmath7 up to 3.5  km above the ground , and an almost constant vertical grid size of @xmath13600  m up to 23.8  km .",
    "+ all the simulations done for the analyses discussed in this paper , were initialized the day before at 18  ut and forced every 6 hours with the analyses from the ecmwf ( european centre for medium - range weather forecasts ) , and finished at 09  ut ( 05 lt ) of the simulated day ( for a total duration of 15 hours ) .",
    "the reader can refer to @xcite to have more information about the site coordinates and ground altitude . +    [",

    "we report in this section the forecasted temporal evolutions for 3 nights in 2011 , and 4 nights in 2013 , of the relative humidity .",
    "these nights are all the nights of 2011 and 2013 , in which a relative humidity ( rh ) larger than 80% has been observed .",
    "this is the unique interesting condition to be studied for astronomical application in this region for these wavelengths .",
    "as already remembered , in this region the rh is mainly of the order of 20 - 30 % and measurements for such a low values are not necessarily reliable .",
    "figure  [ fig : appendix_rh ] displays the temporal evolution of the relative humidity for these nights . the forecasted relative humidity is , in these cases , very close to the observed one . in two nights over three in 2011",
    "the forecasted rh is moreover larger than 80% as well as the observed one . in one night",
    "( 5 july 2011 ) , the forecasted rh is slightly inferior ( @xmath13 70% ) but still very high .",
    "the four night of 2013 with a high observed rh are well reproduced too by the model ( predicted values always between 60% and 100% ) even if a small dry bias is present .",
    "this means that apparently , the model succeeds in predicting these critical high values , even though the frequency of occurrence of such an event is very low .",
    "practically , the astronomer needs to know if the humidity during the night will be higher than 80% , a threshold above which the dome must be closed , and thus observations are not allowed .",
    "our results indicate that the model can give a positive forecast of the night relative humidity useful for astronomers .",
    "of course it would be of interest to identify a richer sample of nights with relative humidity as high as 80% across several years and study the behavior of the model on a richer sample .",
    "this might permit us to have a more robust conclusions on this specific subject ."
