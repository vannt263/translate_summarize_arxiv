    "it is well known that , with few exceptions , the presence of non - mesomorphic solutes in nematics depress the normal nematic - isotropic transition temperature ( @xmath5 ) @xcite .",
    "moreover , experiments @xcite over last few decades have confirmed that the presence of such impurities leads to the formation of a two phase region .",
    "this is consistent with the laws of thermodynamics and the first order nature of the @xmath6 transition .",
    "two types of models have proved to be generally useful for investigating @xmath6 transitions in dilute solutions .",
    "the first is a lattice model @xcite which takes into account the role of intermolecular repulsion or the steric effect .",
    "the other @xcite is the mean field theory of the maier - saupe type which takes into account the anisotropic intermolecular attraction or dispersion forces .",
    "more recently mukherjee @xcite has explained the behavior of the two phase region using the phenomenological landau de gennes theory .",
    "the role of non mesogenic impurities on a mesogen which exhibits a smectic phase as well , has not received a great deal of attention of either experimentalists or theorists . here too , in favourable circumstances , remains a possibility of the existence of a two phase region near the smectic transition @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we report the results of measurements carried out on a mixture of biphenyl and @xmath1-n - octyl - cyano biphenyl ( 8cb ) .",
    "the latter which has a strong polar group and a long alkyl chain has received considerable attention of experimentalists over last few decades @xcite and is known to exhibit a first order @xmath7 transition .",
    "the biphenyl+8cb system to our knowledge , has not been studied before and is a natural and interesting choice in its own merit since the solute , which is chemically @xmath0 , is a non - mesogenic , non - polar , rigid molecule and is nothing but 8cb deprived of its cyano group and the flexible alkyl chain .",
    "we have observed that biphenyl is easily miscible with 8cb and lowers both @xmath8 and @xmath5 by an amount which depends on the impurity concentration .",
    "the range of the nematic phase i.e. , @xmath9 however is not significantly altered .",
    "the effect of this rod - like non - polar impurity on the dielectric anisotropy , the frank elastic constants ( splay and bend ) and on the effective rotational viscosity coefficient of pure 8cb has been reported here . to our knowledge",
    ", no measurement has yet been reported on the effect of impurities on the elastic constants and the viscosity coefficient of a nematic .",
    "the experiments we have carried out involve electric field induced freedericksz transition and consist of two parts .",
    "the dielectric anisotropy and the frank elastic constants are extracted from a set of measurements of the voltage dependence of capacitance of a sample cell filled with the 8cb and biphenyl mixture . for the determination of the rotational viscosity coefficient a method based on dynamic freedericksz transition is used .",
    "interesting features have emerged from these measurements and the splay elastic constant is seen to exhibit anomalous behavior in the vicinity of the @xmath7 transitions for the impurity concentration exceeding a certain value .",
    "the splay elastic constant @xmath2 is related to the freedericksz threshold voltage @xmath10 by the relation    @xmath11    where @xmath12@xmath13 is the permittivity of free space and @xmath14@xmath15 , the dielectric anisotropy of the sample .",
    "the method of determination of @xmath3 is described below .",
    "the exact relationship between the cell capacitance @xmath16 and the voltage @xmath17 applied across the cell was obtained by gruler @xcite    @xmath18 ^{1/2}d\\phi\\ ] ]    and    @xmath19 ^{1/2}d\\phi } { \\int _ { 0}^{\\phi _ { m}}\\left [ \\frac{(1+\\kappa \\sin ^{2}\\phi ) } { ( 1+\\gamma \\sin ^{2}\\phi ) ( \\sin ^{2}\\phi _ { m}-\\sin ^{2}\\phi ) } \\right ] ^{1/2}d\\phi } \\ ] ]    where @xmath20 ( @xmath21 being the bend elastic constant ) , @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the tilt angle made by the director with a direction parallel to the cell walls , @xmath23@xmath24 is the tilt angle at the center of the cell and @xmath25 is the capacitance of the cell when the liquid crystal molecules are homogeneously aligned , that is , before the onset of freedericksz transition when the voltage applied is lower than the threshold voltage .",
    "these equations can be combined to yield    @xmath26 ^{1/2}dx\\ ] ]    when the applied voltage is much higher that the threshold voltage , the director at the center of the cell becomes perpendicular to the cell walls and @xmath27 .",
    "then the above equation reduces to    @xmath28 ^{1/2}dx\\ ] ]    or dividing by @xmath29    @xmath30 ^{1/2}dx\\ ] ]    where @xmath31 may be called the reduced capacitance .",
    "@xmath16@xmath32 is the capacitance of the cell when the nematic is homeotropically oriented , i.e. , the value of @xmath16 in the limit @xmath33 @xmath34 .",
    "@xmath35 and @xmath36 may be obtained by dividing @xmath37 and @xmath25 by the empty cell capacitance @xmath38 respectively . in the above equation use",
    "has been made of the relation @xmath39 .",
    "thus equation ( [ crat2 ] ) predicts that a plot of @xmath40@xmath41 against @xmath33 for @xmath17@xmath42 should be linear and the extrapolated value of the ordinate for @xmath33 @xmath34 should directly provide the value of @xmath29=@xmath43 .",
    "this procedure for obtaining @xmath29 was first suggested by meyerhofer @xcite .",
    "the variation of capacitance with applied voltage was fitted against equations ( [ vrat ] ) and ( [ crat ] ) to obtain @xmath10 and @xmath44 .",
    "we then used ( [ k11eq ] ) to calculate @xmath2 and hence @xmath21 .",
    "this method for obtaining @xmath10 and @xmath44 was suggested by morris et al @xcite .",
    "the viscous behavior of a nematic can be obtained by studying the response to a sudden change of an applied magnetic or electric field which is normally stronger than the freedericksz - threshold value . in case of deformations involving a pure twist",
    "there is no hydrodynamic flow .",
    "the molecules merely rotate without any translational motion and the analysis is rather simple @xcite .",
    "the situation is far more complicated in case of a splay geometry which we have studied since the director reorientation is now accompanied by a hydrodynamic flow .",
    "the gradient of the angular velocity of the director produces a backflow motion , first demonstrated by pieranski @xcite giving rise to a frictional torque .",
    "the sudden removal of an external field in this case would result in a director relaxation time    @xmath45    where @xmath46 is the effective rotational viscosity coefficient , @xmath47 is the cell thickness and @xmath2 is the splay elastic constant . in practice",
    "@xmath46 is about @xmath48 less than the rotational viscosity coefficient @xmath49 .",
    "we have determined the relaxation time @xmath50 by measuring the decay of capacitance in a nematic cell .",
    "the details are given in the next section .",
    "we have used a hewlett - packard lcr meter hp 4274a to measure the capacitance of the sample cell .",
    "the instrument employs the so called `` auto balancing bridge method '' to measure both the real and complex parts of impedance simultaneously .",
    "the voltage was varied from 0.1 v to 5 v at a frequency of 1khz .",
    "the sample cells , which were of very high precision , were obtained from displaytech , usa . the cells consisting of two ito coated glass plates with a spacing of 4 @xmath51 m , and an active area of 0.26 @xmath52 , had brushed polyimide treatment to ensure planar orientation . they also had a guard ring incorporated in them to minimize fringe electric fields .",
    "the temperature of the cells were controlled to within @xmath53 by placing the cells within a mettler hot stage fp 82 .",
    "the texture of the samples were viewed through a leitz polarizing microscope and photographs were taken with the help of photoautomat .",
    "both 8cb and biphenyl were obtained from merck and were used without further purification .    the samples which we have used were mixtures of various concentrations of biphenyl , ranging from 0.4% to 6.4% , in pure 8cb .",
    "the smectic to nematic transition temperature , @xmath8 and the nematic to isotropic transition temperature @xmath5 were determined from texture studies of the samples .",
    "various photographs were taken at different stages of transition . in the capacitance measurement experiments the probe voltage of the lcr meter hp 4274a provided the aligning a.c . electric field .",
    "the voltage was varied from 0.1 v to 5 v at a frequency of 1khz in the @xmath54 mode of the instrument . in the neighborhood of freedericksz transition readings",
    "were taken at intervals of 10mv .",
    "the samples were filled in the cells and the c - v variation was recorded at a large number of temperatures ranging from the smectic to nematic transition temperature , @xmath8 , to a few degrees beyond the nematic to isotropic transition temperature , @xmath5 . it must be noted that all measurements were carried out as the temperatures of the sample were increased gradually starting from @xmath55 and none of the measurements were taken during cooling .",
    "fig.[c - v variation ] shows a few capacitance - voltage variations of the mixture with biphenyl concentration @xmath56 at temperatures near the two transitions @xmath7 and @xmath6 and at an intermediate temperature .",
    "there is always a need to have a refinement in the value of @xmath10 as the c - v curves obtained in a polyimide cell usually do not exhibit a very sharp threshold of freedericksz transition so as to yield a precise value of @xmath10 from the data directly . from the c - v data @xmath36 and @xmath35",
    "were calculated and subsequently @xmath10 and @xmath44 were determined as described below .",
    "@xmath36 was determined directly from the value of capacitance at voltages lower than the threshold voltage , ( before the onset of the freedericksz transition ) by dividing the capacitance , @xmath25 by the empty cell capacitance @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath35 was obtained by plotting @xmath16 against @xmath33 for the higher voltage range @xmath57 .",
    "the extrapolated value of capacitance in the limit as @xmath58 gives @xmath37 which when divided by @xmath38 gives @xmath35 .    a direct measurement of @xmath37",
    "was also carried out to check the reliability of the value of @xmath29 obtained by the above method .",
    "a homeotropic alignment was obtained in the ito coated glass cells using ctab ( cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide ) and the capacitance of the cell was measured while a @xmath59 magnetic field was applied across the cell .",
    "the values of @xmath29 thus obtained never differed from the @xmath29 s obtained from the @xmath33 -extrapolation method by more than @xmath60 .    a two parameter non - linear least square fit for finding @xmath10 and",
    "@xmath44 worked in the following manner .",
    "starting values of @xmath10 and @xmath29 were taken directly from the experiment .",
    "( [ vrat ] ) was then used to obtain the @xmath61 s for all values of v for which measurements of capacitance were carried out .",
    "the @xmath61 s thus obtained were used in ( [ crat ] ) to obtain c. the error which was minimized in the least square programme is @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the measured value of the capacitance at v=@xmath64 and @xmath65 is the value of capacitance obtained by solving ( [ crat ] ) , n being the number of data points for a particular temperature .",
    "the final values of @xmath10 never differed a great deal from the input values .    for the rotational viscosity coefficient measurements ,",
    "we have used a hewlett - packard impedance gain - phase analyser hp @xmath66a in the programmable mode to record the decay of capacitance with time .",
    "an integration time of @xmath67 @xmath51sec was chosen which resulted in an interval of @xmath68 msec between the successive readings at the operating frequency which was fixed at @xmath69 khz . with our instrument a delay time , in multiples of @xmath70 msec , could be introduced between the readings but in this case we did not introduce any delay since the decay of capacitance was found to be pretty fast .",
    "probe voltage across the sample cell was held fixed at @xmath71 v. a low frequency a.c .",
    "voltage about @xmath72 volts peak to peak was applied across the cell for about @xmath73 secs .",
    "it was switched off and the transient ( decaying ) capacitance of the cell , was captured as a function of time by the hp @xmath66a .",
    "a plot of this decay of capacitance with time which was always found to be exponential was then dumped into a hp @xmath74a plotter which was connected to the impedance analyser over a hpib bus . from the plots thus obtained for different concentration of biphenyl mixtures , at different temperatures ,",
    "the time constant , @xmath50 was calculated and using the values of @xmath2 obtained from the static capacitance measurements , the effective rotational viscosity coefficient , @xmath46 was evaluated .",
    "the transition temperatures @xmath5 ( upper ) , @xmath5 ( lower ) and @xmath8 were determined from optical texture studies and the results are presented in table [ transition temp(table ) ] and fig.[phase diagram ] . the @xmath5 ( upper )",
    "is the temperature at which the field of view of the polarizing microscope ( with crossed polarizer and analyzer ) becomes completely dark .",
    "all real nematics contain impurities and rosenblatt @xcite has observed in 8cb a two phase @xmath75 region of temperature of width @xmath76 in absence of an electric field .",
    "needless to say , with our temperature resolution of @xmath77 , we were unable to confirm this .",
    "the width of the two phase region was seen to increase with the concentration of biphenyl and for the maximum concentration of @xmath78 this was @xmath79 .",
    "we were unable to work with higher impurity concentration because of non - availability of an experimental arrangement for producing sub - ambient temperatures .",
    "all the transition temperatures reported in table [ transition temp(table ) ] were determined without the presence of any external field .",
    "however , we confirmed that with the highest electric field we applied across the sample cells , namely @xmath80 @xmath81 , there was no noticeable change in any of the transition temperatures .",
    "the temperature dependence of the dielectric anisotropy for the concentration ( c ) of biphenyl ranging from @xmath82 to @xmath56 is shown in fig.[deltaeps ] .",
    "in pure 8cb and for all mixtures we have studied @xmath3 , in the neighborhood of @xmath5 , shows the same feature in that it disappears at @xmath5 ( upper ) . at this particular temperature",
    "the field of view in the microscope with crossed polars is completely dark and hence the phase is isotropic .",
    "values of the dielectric constant @xmath83 obtained well within the isotropic phase show a gradual increase with temperature for pure 8cb as well as for all mixtures we have studied .",
    "focussing on the behavior of @xmath3 as @xmath8 is approached from the higher temperature side we find that for biphenyl concentration , c upto 2.00% @xmath3 in mixtures behaves the same way as that in pure 8cb , namely that it shows a sharp increase . however , for impurity concentrations of @xmath84 and higher , @xmath3 goes down sharply , while always remaining positive ( at least in the temperature range we have explored ) . we have noted that the decrease in @xmath3 results from a reduction of @xmath35 , ( @xmath36 remaining fairly constant ) as @xmath8 is approached .",
    "a similar decrease in @xmath35 as @xmath8 is approached has been observed in pure @xmath85 - diheptylazoxybenzene where the @xmath4 transition is almost second order .",
    "this has been attributed to the presence of pretransitional effects within the nematic phase @xcite .",
    "the temperature and concentration dependence of the splay elastic constant @xmath2 is shown in fig .",
    "the ratio @xmath44 was seen to approach the value 0 and stay around that value at and around transition but then it was seen to increase again with increase in temperature . the plot of bend elastic constant @xmath21 with @xmath86 is shown in fig . [ k33 ] .",
    "the bend elastic constant @xmath21 is seen to diverge as the smectic phase is approached from the nematic side .",
    "the behavior was of the type @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the difference @xcite between @xmath21 and its nematic part , @xmath89 and @xmath90 is the critical exponent .",
    "we found that for all the samples studied @xmath90 is @xmath91 which is in agreement with the exponent obtained by morris et al @xcite in pure 8cb .",
    "it must be recalled , however , that anisotropic scaling laws , predict that @xmath88 should vary as the correlation length @xmath92 both above and below @xmath8 and this should result in an exponent @xmath93 , which from x - ray scattering experiments in many samples turn out to be @xmath94 @xcite .",
    "but the temperature @xmath95 at which @xmath21 diverges is slightly higher by @xmath96 than @xmath8 for the mixtures and for ease of eye , indicated by the vertical lines in fig.[k33 ] .",
    "we are however unable to say if the weakly first order @xmath7 transition in pure 8cb approaches a second order transition in the mixtures and this needs more detail studies .",
    "on plotting @xmath2 against @xmath29 we find that the variation for all the concentrations lie nearly on a universal curve , as shown in fig.[k11vsgamma ] .",
    "the deviations which are seen in the figure are mainly the points for the higher concentration mixtures which lie in the vicinity of the two transitions .",
    "the abrupt decrease in @xmath35 as the smectic phase is approached , seems to occur at relatively higher concentrations of biphenyl and is totally absent in pure 8cb and in the mixtures of low impurity concentration .",
    "the optical texture studies we have performed fail to reveal the existence of any smectic phase other than smectic a in the mixtures at low temperatures .",
    "it may however be conjectured that the increase in the proportion of biphenyl in the mixture , though small , is leading to a type of ordering , cybotactic or otherwise , of the 8cb molecules where the contribution of the permanent dipole moment of the @xmath97 group to @xmath35 is greatly reduced .",
    "the decrease in @xmath35 which suggests the existence of pre - transitional smectic effects within the nematic phase occurs only for biphenyl concentrations greater than a limiting value .",
    "it may be noted that the ratio @xmath98 changes from @xmath99 in pure 8cb to @xmath100 in the @xmath56 biphenyl-8cb mixture .",
    "it may be pointed out that the decrease in this ratio , though marginal , is believed to favor a second order @xmath7 transition .",
    "the temperature dependence of the rotational viscosity coefficient for the concentration of biphenyl ranging from @xmath82 to @xmath56 is shown in fig.[rotviscvst ] . the @xmath5 ( upper )",
    "is the temperature at which the field of view of the polarizing microscope ( with crossed polarizer and analyser ) becomes completely dark . in pure 8cb and for all the mixtures @xmath46 in the neighborhood of @xmath5 , shows the same feature in that it disappears at or before @xmath5 ( upper ) .",
    "however , as we approach @xmath8 from the higher temperature side we find that for impurity concentrations upto @xmath101 @xmath46 shows a sharp increase as in pure 8cb while for impurity concentration of and higher than @xmath84 , @xmath46 is seen to decrease sharply .",
    "we are not aware of any systematic study involving te effect of non - mesogenic solutes on the rotational viscosity coefficient of the nematics in the neighborhood of nematic - smectic transition .",
    "the miesowicz viscosities of a mixture of 8ocb and 4tpb ( exhibiting the nematic - smectic transition ) were recently investigated by janik et al @xcite using a miesowicz viscometer .",
    "[ orderparm ] shows the plot of @xmath102 vs. @xmath103 .",
    "the dielectric anisotropy @xmath3 is roughly proportional to the long range nematic order parameter .",
    "for pure as well as all mixtures the plot of @xmath102 vs. @xmath103 gives a straight line .",
    "the same sort of dependence has been obtained by gasparoux and prost @xcite , heppke and schneider @xcite for mbba and by prost et al @xcite , for a mixture of two isomers of @xmath104 .",
    "close to @xmath5 and @xmath8 there are deviations and those points have not been shown in the figure . from the slope of these plots",
    "the activation energy for diffusion @xcite was calculated and has been shown in table [ activation energy ] .",
    "to summarize it can be stated that the presence of the rigid , non - polar and non - mesogenic solute biphenyl in 8cb results in a change in the dielectric anisotropy @xmath3 , the splay elastic constant @xmath2 and the effective rotational viscosity coefficient @xmath46 . in the neighborhood of the nematic - smectic a transition for the concentration of biphenyl @xmath105",
    "the changes in these quantities have been found to be anomalous in that , instead of the usual rapid increase observed on cooling , @xmath3 , @xmath2 and @xmath46 sharply decrease .",
    "this may perhaps be attributed to the presence of pretransitional effects within the nematic phase . from optical texture studies we could not identify any new smectic phase in the mixtures other than what is found in 8cb .",
    "the bend elastic constant @xmath21 in all the mixtures was found to diverge as the smectic phase was approached and the critical exponent was found to be the same as that observed for pure 8cb , although the temperatures at which the divergences occur were slightly higher than the respective values of @xmath8 .",
    "more elaborate studies involving dsc , x - ray diffraction and refractive index measurements ( to obtain the long range nematic order parameter ) may perhaps reveal more about what is actually happening in the mixtures near the smectic a - nematic transition particularly for those containing relatively higher biphenyl concentration .",
