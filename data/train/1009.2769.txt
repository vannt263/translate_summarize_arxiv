    "the galactic center region ( gcr ) has the highest star formation rate density in the milky way , more than @xmath42 orders of magnitude above the average value of the galactic disk ( @xcite  @xcite ) .",
    "this is considered to be a consequence of the large reservoir of molecular gas that fills the central half - kiloparsec of the galaxy , where @xmath410% of the galaxy s molecular gas is concentrated . with respect to the physical properties that are typical of molecular gas further out in the galactic disk ,",
    "the gcr medium is significantly hotter , more turbulent , and more highly magnetized .",
    "it is also subject to mechanical shearing by the strong tidal field , and repeated compression from cloud - cloud collisions , stellar winds , and supernova shock waves ( @xcite  @xcite ) .",
    "it has been suggested that the environmental conditions in the gcr result in an elevated jeans mass and an enhanced rate of massive - star production .",
    "at least three extraordinary clusters of massive stars have formed within the unique gcr medium during the past several myr , including the arches cluster (  ) and the quintuplet cluster (  ;  ;  ) , both of which lie @xmath430 pc , in projection , from the center . within the inner few parsecs of the galaxy",
    "lies the central cluster (  ) , which is gravitationally bound to the galactic black hole , sgr a@xmath3 (  ;  ) .",
    "all three of the known clusters are massive ( @xmath5 ) , dense , containing hundreds of o stars , and dozens of evolved wolf - rayet stars ( wrs ) and ob supergiants (  , ; ) .",
    "the collection of three such extraordinary clusters in the gcr is evidence favoring the hypothesis that the predominant mode of star formation in the region gives rise to dense , massive clusters .",
    "however , surveys aimed at identifying massive stars throughout the greater gcr have revealed a population of several dozen massive stars that have no apparent spatial association with the known stellar clusters (  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  , ) .",
    "the discovery of these  isolated \" massive stars has motivated the continued search for additional such cases , with the goal of determining the total extent of the inter - cluster population of massive stars and their physical relation to , or independence from , starburst clusters like the arches and quintuplet .",
    "the demography and kinematics of these isolated stars will yield valuable insight into the mode of massive star formation in the gcr and the dynamical evolution of massive stellar clusters within galactic nuclei .",
    "the identification of isolated massive stars in the gcr is a difficult task .",
    "heavy extinction limits observations of the galactic center starlight to the infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "infrared measurements sample the rayleigh - jeans tail of stellar spectral energy distributions where there is a degeneracy of stellar color with effective temperature .",
    "this renders early - type and late - type stars photometrically indistinguishable .",
    "narrowband photometry aimed at detecting emission - line excesses from hot supergiants can be very effective but requires a highly stable point - spread function ( psf ) in order to accurately subtract the stellar continuum emission from the spectral line emission .",
    "this is difficult to achieve in seeing limited conditions , especially when extreme stellar confusion is an issue , as it typically is when observing the gcr .",
    "therefore , infrared narrowband surveys are best conducted from the stable environment of space , where low - background , diffraction - limited observations can be executed without the nuisance of psf variability .",
    "furthermore , space - based narrowband observations enable measurement of the paschen-@xmath0 ( p@xmath0 ) transition ( @xmath6=43 ) of h i , which is the strongest emission line of this species in the infrared .",
    "the @xmath71.87 wavelength of this transition is also shared with several transitions of he i and he ii , which is important in the interest of detecting hydrogen - poor wrs that exhibit strong helium emission .    in this work ,",
    "we report discoveries of  isolated \" emission - line stars in the gcr via p@xmath0 narrowband imaging from space and subsequent infrared spectroscopy from the ground .",
    "the new additions add to our recent identification of a new luminous blue variable in the gcr (  ) , which was the first reported discovery of the spectroscopic survey .",
    "the successful detection of these stars highlights the significant advantage that space - based narrowband searches using the p@xmath0 line have over ground - based surveys centered on other atomic transitions ( e.  g. ,  ;  ) which have identified only a fraction of the isolated emission - line stars .",
    "we present here the spectra of new identifications , their photometric properties , and discuss the implications that these objects have for massive star formation in the gcr .",
    "our target sample was assembled following the completion of a p@xmath0 narrowband imaging survey of the gcr , performed with the _ hubble space telescope _ and the near - infrared camera and multi - object spectrometer ( nicmos ; @xcite@xcite ) .",
    "the survey , requiring 144 orbits of observations , covered the central @xmath8 arcmin@xmath9 around sgr a@xmath3 , which corresponds to a total projected physical area of @xmath10 pc@xmath11 , assuming a distance of 8 kpc to sgr a@xmath3 (   and references therein ) .",
    "the nic3 camera was utilized and narrowband images were obtained through the f187n ( line ; @xmath12 ; fwhm=0.019 ) and f190n ( continuum ; @xmath13 ; fwhm=0.017 ) filters .",
    "the survey resulted in the detection of @xmath4150 point - like sources of p@xmath0 line excess ( i.e. , sources with f187n - f190n values @xmath145@xmath15 above the mean of all point sources in the survey area ; dong et al .",

    "approximately half of the sources are located outside of the three known stellar clusters , and nearly half of those were unidentified prior to this work .",
    "we have undertaken a near - infrared spectroscopic campaign to characterize the unidentified sources of p@xmath0 line excess .",
    "focusing on the sources having the strongest line excess and the brightest near - infrared counterparts ( @xmath16 mag ) , we have spectroscopically identified 19 new , hot , massive stars in the gcr .",

    "the spectra of these stars are dominated by emission lines of br@xmath27 and the @xmath72.1122.115 complex of he i , n iii , c iii and o iii .",
    "stars 16 , 15 , and 12 exhibit the @xmath72.1122.115 complex in fairly strong emission , while 9 and 10 , instead , exhibit a he i absorption line accompanied by a relatively weak emission component .",
    "weak c iv emission is also apparent in the spectra of stars 16 , 15 , and 12 .",
    "the br@xmath27 lines of all of these stars exhibit an asymmetry on their blue side owing to a contribution from he i at @xmath72.1647 .",
    "an absorption line of he i at @xmath72.058 is present for four of the stars , while this feature appears in emission for two of them .",

    ", we may be inclined to classify them all as wn89h stars . however , the weakness of the @xmath72.1122.115 complex in the spectra of stars 9 and 10 is more typical of the o46if@xmath30 stars in  ( ) than the wn89h stars , which always have a strong @xmath72.1122.115 emission complex .",
    "furthermore , wn89h always exhibit he  ii emission or absorption at @xmath72.189 , but this transition is not detected in the spectra of stars 9 and 10 .",

    "stars 13 and 18 also exhibit strong he i emission at @xmath72.058 with a p cygni profile , and weak he i absorption at @xmath72.112 that may also include a weak n iii emission component on the red side of the he i absorption line .",
    "the br@xmath27 line of star 13 exhibits an asymmetry on its blue side owing to a contribution from he i. star 1 exhibits he i at @xmath72.058 in emission , although it is relatively weak .",
    "star 5 exhibits the he i @xmath72.058 feature as well , but it is in weak absorption .",

    "their classification as supergiants is justified in section 4.2 . by comparison , stars 13 and 18 must be hotter , as indicated by the presence of he i absorption , while the strong p cygni emission lines of he i at @xmath72.058 indicate relatively strong winds . based on these features , we conclude that stars 13 and 18 can be classified as p cygni - type o supergiants . \"",
    "figure 4 presents spectra of stars 11 and 17 .",
    "these stars exhibit broad emission lines , indicative of fast , extended stellar winds . for star",
    "11 spectral emission features include br@xmath27 , he i at @xmath72.058 and @xmath72.112 , and he ii at @xmath72.189 .",
    "the latter of these features is probably the superposition of a he ii @xmath72.189 p cygni profile and a blend of he i emission at @xmath72.185 .",
    "weak emission from n iii is also present at @xmath72.247 , as well as a weak c  iii / n  iii blend at @xmath72.104 .",
    "the weakness of he ii relative to br@xmath27 and he i at @xmath72.112 , and the strong p cygni emission component of he i at @xmath72.058 , are characteristics of late - type , hydrogen - rich , nitrogen - type stars , specifically wn89h stars (;  ) .",
    "the dominant emission feature in the spectrum of star 17 is he ii at @xmath72.189 , which indicates that it is of an early wn ( wne ) subtype .",
    "weak but broad he i emission at @xmath72.058 is present with a deep and highly blueshifted p cygni absorption component .",
    "the large blueshift of this absorption component relative to the peak of the emission component highlights the high wind velocity of star 17 ( @xmath31=0.015 @xmath32 @xmath33 km s@xmath34 ) relative to star 11 ( @xmath31=0.006 @xmath32 @xmath35 km s@xmath34 ) .",
    "furthermore , the emission lines of star 17 are exceptionally broad , having fwhm=155  . according to  ( ) , wn stars with fwhm(he ii @xmath72.189 ) @xmath36130  are classified as broad - lined wn stars ( wnb ) .",
    "star 17 satisfies the broad criterion , while the relative strength of he ii relative to br@xmath27 and he i is consistent with a wn5 spectral type .",
    "thus , we classify star 17 as a wn5b star .      figure 5 presents the @xmath21-band spectra of star 8 , 19 , 14 , 3 , 2 , and 4 .",
    "each of these stars exhibit emission from c iii at @xmath72.115 , he i , and he ii near @xmath72.058 , c iii , and c iv near @xmath72.072.08 , and weak he ii emission near @xmath72.189 .",
    "these spectral characteristics are consistent with those of late , carbon - type ( wc ) wrs . a subtype diagnostic",
    "is provided by the strength ratio of c iv at @xmath72.08 relative to c iii at @xmath72.115 (  ) , which is less than unity for all stars , consistent with wc9 subtype .",
    "luminous wr and o stars generally exhibit infrared excess from the free - free emission generated in their ionized winds , and also from strong line emission (  ;  ) .",
    "thermal continuum excess from hot dust emission is also not uncommon to late - type wc ( wcl ) stars .",
    "color - color diagrams are useful in assessing the infrared excess of wrs and the likely causes for it .",
    "figure 6 shows a color - color diagram of @xmath37 versus @xmath38 for the stars in our sample that were detected in all three near - infrared bands .",
    "the interstellar reddening vector is illustrated by the linear trend traced by random field stars that lie toward the gcr , most of which are presumably late - type giants .",
    "stars 1 and 7 lie near the lower left of figure 6 , well separated from most of the other massive stars .",
    "the fact that they suffer relatively low extinction implies that they are in the foreground toward the gcr .",
    "they also do not appear to exhibit evidence for significant , intrinsic excess .",
    "while the ob and wn stars in the gcr have color excesses typical for their class , several wc stars in figure 6 appear to have color excesses that are significantly higher than those of the o and wn stars and 1 wc star ( note that only four of the wc stars from our sample are included in figure 6 , since two others have not been detected in the @xmath39 band ) .",
    "the colors of star 19 are consistent with the excess being from free - free emission alone , and this might also be true for star 14 .",
    "however , the relatively strong excess emission from stars 2 and 4 ( the two wc stars that are furthest from the reddening trend in figure 6 ) indicates that there is an additional excess component , which is likely the result of thermal emission from hot dust .",
    "late - type wc stars ( wc89 ) commonly exhibit thermal emission from hot dust , and it is generally accepted that the production of dust from these stars is a consequence of binary evolution , whereby the dust is created via the collision of hydrogen - rich and carbon - rich winds from the respective ob and wc stars (  ) .",
    "several likely examples of this phenomenon are already known in the gcr , and they are typically detectable as hard x - ray sources ( e.g. , see and references therein ) . since stars 2 and 4 were not detected in x - ray surveys of their respective fields (  ) ,",
    "there is currently no evidence that they are members of colliding - wind binary systems .",
    "nonetheless , the relatively strong excess emission from stars 2 and 4 is consistent with thermal dust emission .",
    "thus , we tentatively classify stars 2 and 4 and wc9?d stars .",
    "we derived the extinction and absolute photometry for each source by comparing the observed @xmath40 and @xmath37 colors with the intrinsic colors of stars of the same spectral types , which were adopted from the literature (  ;  ) .",
    "we used the extinction relation of  ( ) for stars near the galactic center , which is given by @xmath41 and @xmath42 where @xmath43 , and similarly for the @xmath40 colors .",
    "the two values were then averaged to obtain a final extinction estimate , @xmath44 .",
    "the results are listed in table 3 .",
    "the values are similar to other known massive stars in the gcr ( e.g. , see  ) . as expected from their positions in figure 6 , stars 7 ( o46i ) and 1 ( b0i  b2i ) have relatively low @xmath45 values of 1.16 and 0.95 mag , respectively , which indicates that they lie in the foreground .    assuming a distance of 8 kpc for the galactic center (  )",
    ", we derived @xmath46 from the extinction - corrected values .",
    "to calculate the bolometric luminosities of the stars , bolometric corrections for the appropriate spectral types were adopted from the same literature sources used to obtain the intrinsic colors , except for the wn89h stars , whose bolometric corrections were derived from the @xmath47 and luminosity values of the wn89h stars in  ( ) .",
    "these results are also listed in table 3 , and they are more or less consistent with luminosities that are typical for these spectral types .",
    "the luminosity values derived for the other o and b stars are also consistent with supergiant luminosity class .",
    "we note that the luminosity values obtained for wc9?d stars should be met with caution , since thermal dust emission can have a significant effect on the observed infrared colors , leading to an overestimate of the extinction toward the source .",
    "nonetheless , the luminosity values that we obtain are consistent with those of other wc9 stars .",
    "for the foreground o4i star 7 , we assumed that it shares the same value of @xmath47 as star 6 , since they appear to be identical in spectral type .",
    "thus , we derive a distance modulus of 12.79 mag ( 3.6 kpc ) to star 7 , which places it in the norma arm of the galaxy (  ) . for the b0i  b2i star 1 we have no information on its luminosity class , so we are unable to derive its foreground distance .",
    "however , its extinction value is very comparable to star 7 ; so , we could infer that it also lies at roughly the same distance , also in the norma arm .",
    "if so , then the associated distance modulus of 12.79 mag indicates that star 1 has @xmath48 , which implies supergiant luminosity class .",
    "the o46i stars 6 and 7 have x - ray counterparts in the master catalog of  ( ) , which contains 9017 x - ray point sources detected in all combined observations of the gcr with the _ chandra x - ray observatory_. the x - ray photometric data for these two sources is presented in table 4 .",
    "the details of the extraction process are described in  ( ) .",
    "candidate near - infrared counterparts to the population of gcr x - ray sources were identified in  ( ) ; the o46i star 6 is source 432 from table 3 of those authors , and is associated with the _ chandra _ source cxogc j174531.4@xmath19285716 . on the other hand , the foreground o46i star 7 that is associated with _",
    "chandra _ source cxogc j174537.9@xmath19290134 is not present in  ( ) , since it was flagged as having erroneous photometry in the sirius near - infrared catalog that was used for that work ; so , for this star we relied on photometry from the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ; cutri et al .",
    "table 4 includes x - ray source astrometry , total on - source integration time , photon number counts in the hard ( 2.08.0 kev ) and soft bands ( 0.52.0 kev ) , broadband photon flux , hardness ratios for soft and hard energy bands , and the average energy of all detected photons .    in order to constrain the distance and nature of the x - ray sources",

    "the hard color , hr2 , is defined by letting @xmath50 and @xmath51 be the fluxes in the 4.78.0 kev and 3.34.7 kev energy bands , respectively .",
    "galactic center sources , which typically lie behind a hydrogen absorption column of @xmath52 @xmath53 , will have most of their soft x - ray photons absorbed by the interstellar medium ( ism ) , and will , thus , exhibit @xmath54 (  ) . star 6 , with hr0=0.56 , definitely satisfies the criterion for galactic center location , while star 7 , with hr0=@xmath190.17 barely makes the cut . compared with hr0 ,",
    "the more energetic photons used to calculate hr2 suffer significantly less absorption from intervening gas and dust , so they are more useful for constraining the intrinsic x - ray hardness .",
    "we compared the hr2 colors of these sources with those of the several dozen x - ray emitting massive stars in the gcr that were presented in  (; their figure 11 ) .",
    "star 6 is among the faintest x - ray sources that has a confirmed infrared counterpart .",
    "it was not significantly detected at energies above 4.7 kev , so its hr2 value is @xmath55 .",
    "this contrasts with most of several dozen known , massive stellar x - ray sources in the gcr , many of which have significant detections at energies up to 8.0 kev .",
    "this feature of the general population is presumed to be the result of emission from a relatively hard thermal plasma with @xmath56 kev . by contrast , the practically null detection of x - rays above 4.7 kev energy from star 6 implies that it is a relatively faint and soft x - ray source ( @xmath57 kev , if it is thermal ) . unfortunately , there are not enough counts to effectively model the x - ray spectrum .",
    "but if we assume a thermal plasma and guess a reasonable temperature , we can at least get an order - of - magnitude estimate of the x - ray luminosity . to do this",
    ", we used the derived extinction values in table 3 to calculate the corresponding hydrogen column density ( @xmath58 ) , using the @xmath59 ratio from ( ) , assuming a negligible difference between @xmath60 and @xmath45 , and the @xmath61 ratio of ( ) , which gives @xmath62 @xmath53 mag@xmath34 .",
    "we obtained @xmath63 @xmath53 for star 6 , which is consistent with the canonical average value of @xmath64 @xmath53 that is typical for galactic center x - ray sources . using the observed 0.58.0 kev energy flux of @xmath65 erg s@xmath34 @xmath53 for this source , we employed the   simulator to calculate the absorption - corrected x - ray flux .",
    "we assumed an intrinsic thermal plasma energy value range of @xmath661 kev , which is appropriate ; after all , the faintness of this source and its lack of high energy emission ( low hr2 value ) , compared with the other gcr x - ray sources of  ( ) , imply that the plasma temperature is unlikely to be any hotter than this .",
    "predicts an unabsorbed x - ray flux in the range of @xmath67@xmath68 erg s@xmath34 @xmath53 for star 6 .",
    "accounting for the distance of 8 kpc , this implies an x - ray luminosity in the range of @xmath69@xmath70 erg s@xmath34 in the 0.58.0 kev energy band .",
    "thus , assuming @xmath71 is between 0.6 and 1 kev , the x - ray to bolometric luminosity ratio of star 6 is in the range of @xmath72 to @xmath73 .",
    "the other o46i star , 7 , has a relatively large x - ray flux in the soft energy range ( 0.52.0 kev ) compared with star 6 and the other massive stellar x - ray sources in the gcr .",
    "it is also relatively bright overall .",
    "this is not surprising , since both the photometry and the extinction value that we calculated for the stellar counterpart in table 3 imply a foreground distance of 3.6 kpc .",
    "so , if the x - ray - detected o46i stars 6 and 7 have the same intrinsic nature , then we should expect the foreground star 7 to appear brighter .",
    "fortunately , star 7 has enough counts to warrant a fitting of its x - ray spectrum , which can better constrain the physical parameters of the x - ray emission . to do this",
    ", we used the program (  ) .",
    "first , the x - ray spectral data were binned to have at least 30 counts in each energy bin . then , we performed least squares fits to the data by trying out two different emission models , including a power - law model and a thermal plasma model .",
    "the power - law fit required an unrealistically steep photon index of @xmath74 , so we do not regard this as a viable model for star 7 . however , the thermal plasma model fit the data reasonably well .",
    "the parameters fit by the model were @xmath58 , @xmath71 , and a normalization factor that is proportional to the emission measure .",
    "for the iterative fitting procedure , we used initial guess values of @xmath75 @xmath53 , derived from the infrared photometry , and @xmath76 kev .",
    "after 30 fitting iterations , returned values of @xmath77 @xmath53 , @xmath78 kev , and an energy flux of @xmath79 erg s@xmath34 @xmath53 .",
    "the reduced @xmath80 of the fit was 0.7 for 13 degrees of freedom . using these parameters we calculated an absorbtion - corrected x - ray flux of @xmath81 erg s@xmath34 @xmath53 . using the derived distance of 3.6 kpc , we calculated an x - ray luminosity of @xmath82 erg s@xmath34 for star 7 , which implies an x - ray to bolometric luminosity ratio of @xmath72 ,    the estimated plasma temperatures and x - ray luminosities of stars 6 and 7 are consistent with the values that have been measured for the gcr o46i stars in the sample of  ( ) , and the o46i stars in the cygnus ob2 sample of  ( ) .",
    "o stars typically exhibit @xmath83 , and this is true for both single stars and those in massive binaries (  ) .",
    "this relation is a result of the connection between the strength of radiatively driven winds and the temperature of the resulting shocks , which may occur inside the stellar wind via turbulence - induced micro shocks , or from wind collision if the o star is in a massive binary .",
    "however , the plasma temperatures reached via the inter - wind micro - shock process typically have @xmath57 kev , while shocks in colliding - wind binaries generate higher temperatures ( @xmath842 kev ) and produce harder x - ray spectra .",
    "our derived value of @xmath78 kev is insufficient to effectively discriminate between these two mechanisms .",
    "although the average photon energy of both sources is @xmath853.0 kev , these photons could simply be the tail of a much softer intrinsic spectrum whose lower energy photons were absorbed by the ism .",
    "alternatively , our assumption of a single temperature plasma for star 7 might be too simplistic , and the highest energy photons detected from this source could actually be from an intrinsic hard component with @xmath842 kev . but without more counts in the softer energy bands , we can not reliably fit a multi - temperature plasma model to the data , which is generally the case for high x - ray flux o stars in cygnus . in conclusion ,",
    "the x - ray properties of stars 6 and 7 are consistent with thermal emission from either single o stars or those in colliding - wind binaries , although we currently have no good reason to invoke binarity for either source .",
    "there are currently 92 identified wrs in the gcr , including all known wne ( wn46 ) , wnl ( wn79 ) , wce ( wc47 ) and wcl ( wc89 ) stars identified in the field ( including those identified outside of the p@xmath0 survey area ) , and those identified in the arches , quintuplet , and central clusters .",
    "their subtype statistics are presented in table 5 .",
    "the most noteworthy characteristic of the wr subtype distribution is the high late - type to early - type ratio for both wc and wn stars ; out of the 55 wn stars , only 5 are wne types ; and out of 36 wc stars , only 1 is a wce type .",
    "wc stars comprise 40% of the total wr population ( 47% if we exclude the arches cluster , which is too young to have produced wc stars ) .",
    "figure 7 shows a plot of p@xmath0 line strength ( defined here as the f187n / f190n flux ratio ) versus @xmath18-band magnitude for known wrs in the gcr and the remaining unidentified p@xmath0-excess candidates in the survey area (; dong et al .",
    "2011 , in preparation ) .",
    "the known sources in figure 7 include emission - line stars from the gcr field , and from the arches , quintuplet , and central parsec clusters .",
    "the @xmath18-band values of unidentified sources were obtained by cross - correlating the positions of the p@xmath0-excess candidates with sources from the sirius and 2mass catalogs ( we make a note of caution that a few of the unidentified p@xmath0 sources having the faintest @xmath18 matches might be spurious associations in this crowded region , and that sirius magnitudes may have significant systematic errors because of source confusion , especially near the central parsec cluster ) .",
    "the data in figure 7 suggest that all but a few of the remaining unidentified p@xmath0 candidates occupy a brightness range of @xmath18 and f187n / f190n that is systematically offset from the range occupied by confirmed wrs .",
    "thus , an important question naturally arises as to the completeness of the wr sample at the inner @xmath86 pc@xmath11 around sgr a@xmath3 ( the survey area ) .",
    "wnl stars , which almost completely dominate the current wn sample , have f187n / f190n ratios between 1.2 and 2.9 , and have bright counterparts with @xmath8712 mag .",
    "wnl types are expected to generally have @xmath88 mag when observed in the gcr ( e.g. , see  , their figure 25 ) .",
    "thus , we suspect that only a few wnl stars , at most , could remain unidentified in the survey area .",
    "this also appears to be the case for wne types ; those confirmed thus far , all of which have subtypes in the wn56 range , have several of the highest f187n / f190n ratios in the entire sample of wrs . none of the unidentified p@xmath0-excess candidates have f187n / f190n ratios this large .",
    "earlier wne stars of subtype wn34 have not yet been found in the gcr .",
    "although they are intrinsically the faintest of the wn stars ( @xmath89 mag ;  ) , having expected @xmath21-band magnitudes as faint as @xmath414 in the gcr , wn34 stars will exhibit p@xmath0 excess similar to the wn56 stars .",
    "therefore , they should still be easily detectable as relatively strong sources of p@xmath0 excess spectra of wn36 and wc46 stars obtained from the ground ( not shown here ) .",
    "the spectra of the wne stars exhibit large flux at @xmath71.87 that can penetrate the severe atmospheric absorption at this wavelength , which implies that such stars will generally have high f187n / f190n ratios . ] , modulo the presence of a bright , diffuse background .",
    "thus , although figure 7 indicates that several wn stars could remain unidentified , we suspect the wn sample in the survey area is near completion nonetheless .",
    "this implies that wnl types heavily dominate the gcr wn population , and that wne subtypes are intrinsically rare in the region .",
    "the situation is less clear for wc stars .",
    "their f187n / f190n ratios span a range of values similar to the distribution of wnl types , but the faint end of their expected brightness distribution in the gcr extends down to @xmath90 mag for the earliest wce subtypes (  ) .",
    "this has been confirmed by photometry of the wc56 star irs 3e of the central parsec cluster ( e58 from  ) , which has @xmath91 mag and is the only wce star identified in the gcr to date .",
    "unfortunately , the f187n / f190n ratio for this source could not be measured because of source confusion and the strong , diffuse background emission from sgr a west .",
    "even with relatively large intrinsic f187n / f190n ratios , however , sources as faint as irs 3e will have large photometric uncertainties that could render them weak or undetectable sources of p@xmath0 excess in the _ hst_/nicmos survey ( dong et al .",
    "2011 , in preparation ) .",
    "thus , it is difficult to ascertain the detectability of a hypothetical population of wce types in the gcr , and we can not reliably estimate the potential contribution of such stars to the sample of unidentified sources in figure 7 . the same is true for wcl types , which can also be very faint ( @xmath92 mag ) and whose line strengths can be heavily diluted in cases where there is significant flux contribution from a host dust continuum .",
    "extremely dusty wcl stars ( dwcl ;  ) , like the quintuplet proper members , whose emission lines have been completely diluted by a thermal continuum or obscuring dust screen , are not detectable p@xmath0 excess sources at all ; so , some of these stellar types could remain unidentified .",
    "however , dwcl stars are very bright infrared sources ( @xmath937 mag ) and typically have x - ray counterparts . based on these properties ,",
    "the statistics of x - ray / infrared matches from  ( ) , combined with the spectroscopic survey results of  ( ) , imply that most , if not all , dwcl stars in the survey area should have been found already .",
    "still , less extreme wc9d stars with diluted emission lines that are not detectable x - ray sources might remain elusive .",
    "the near completeness of the wn stars in the survey area implies that apparent dominance of wnl stars over wne stars is an intrinsic property of the gcr .",
    "although the sample of wc stars is probably not complete , we also suspect that wcl stars are intrinsically dominant over wce types .",
    "the reasons for this are as follows .",
    "it has been well established that wr subtype distributions are correlated with environmental metallicity ; this has been established for the milky way and other galaxies of the local group (  ) .",
    "wne and wce stars appear to be rare in relatively high - metallicity environments ( @xmath94 ) , such as the inner galaxy , but are common in low - metallicity environments , such as the outer galaxy ( @xmath95 ) , and the large magellanic cloud ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "this observed trend has been interpreted as a result of the metallicity dependence of wr winds ( see   and references therein for the following discussion ) . for wn stars ,",
    "the higher wind density that results from increased metallicity leads to more efficient atomic recombination from high ionization stages ( e.g. , n@xmath97 ) to lower ions ( e.g. , n@xmath98 ) , which effectively increases the trend toward later spectral types .",
    "alternatively , decreased recombination efficiency and reduced nitrogen content at lower metallicity results in a trend toward earlier wn subtypes .",
    "for wc stars in high - metallicity environments , higher wind densities lead to an increased emission strength of c iii with respect to c iv .",
    "since wcl and wce stars are classified as such based upon the relative strengths of c iii and c iv emission lines , wc stars in environments with @xmath94 will tend to manifest as wcl subtypes ( c iii stronger than c iv ) .",
    "although this effect was originally suggested by  ( ) to be an important factor for the optical classification of wc stars ( specifically for c iii at @xmath75696  ) , the effect of elevated c iii relative to c iv for increasing wind density is likely to be mirrored in the infrared spectrum of wc stars as well .",
    "thus , the dominance of wnl and wcl stars over wne and wce stars in the gcr is a natural consequence of the fact that the metallicity of the region is at least solar ( e.g. , see  , and references therein ) , if not supersolar (  ;  ) .      figures 8 and 9 show the distribution of  isolated \" massive stars very near the arches and quintuplet clusters . for the arches ,",
    "there are three wnh stars that lie within @xmath42 pc , in projection , of the cluster .",
    "the magnitudes and spectral types of these outer wnh stars are very similar to the brightest arches members , some of which have estimated initial masses above 100 (  ) . based on the spectral similarities and the close spatial proximity , we suggest that the three massive stars surrounding the arches cluster are coeval with the system .",
    "the main uncertainty is with regard to their current kinematical state .",
    "one might expect that mass segregation via dynamical friction should concentrate massive stars like these toward the cluster center .",
    "however , higher order processes occurring at the cluster center might result in an alternative effect .",
    "indeed , the arches cluster is the most dense system known in the galaxy ( @xmath99 pc@xmath100 ;  ) . as such",
    ", the central region of this cluster must be the site of frequent gravitational encounters between massive stars and binaries , including binary captures , disruptions , and exchanges . through such interactions",
    ", one might expect a few massive stars to be gravitationally  kicked \" from time to time beyond the tidal radius , which is @xmath41 pc for the arches and quintuplet (  )",
    ". this could be the case for stars 11 and 12 of this work , and g0.10@xmath1010.02 from  ( ) , all of which lie well beyond the arches cluster s tidal radius .",
    "given that the internal velocity dispersion of the arches cluster is @xmath10210 km s@xmath34 (  ) , a massive star would not require an unusually large gravitational  kick \" to escape the cluster .",
    "alternatively , one or more of these stars could have formed at the same time and from the same cloud as the main cluster but never became bound to the system .",
    "if this is the case then the stars could simply be following a path that is in tandem with that of the cluster , without orbiting the cluster center .",
    "these possibilities may also be applicable to the massive stars surrounding the quintuplet cluster .",
    "( ) suggested that the o6if@xmath28 x - ray source cxogc j174617.0@xmath19285131 , a suspected colliding - wind binary , may have originated in the quintuplet , while the same might be true for the nearby lbv g0.120@xmath190.048 (  ) .",
    "observationally distinguishing between the various possible origins of the stars surrounding the arches and quintuplet clusters would be very difficult using radial velocities alone , since both ejected stars _ and _ comoving stars that were never bound to the clusters would exhibit similar radial velocities , perhaps differing on the order of only 10 km s@xmath34 .",
    "proper motion measurements , however , would allow for the derivation of a three - dimensional space velocity vector , which would better elucidate the association between these stars and the clusters , and could provide evidence for ejection , specifically .",
    "such measurements are within the capabilities of 10 m class telescopes utilizing adaptive optics . for example ,  ( ) used proper motion measurements over a 4.3 year baseline to derive a three - dimensional space velocity of @xmath103 km s@xmath34 for the arches cluster . as coeval siblings of the arches cluster stars",
    ", we might expect stars 11 , 12 , and g0.10@xmath1010.02 to have a similar velocity , whether they were ejected from the cluster or are just comoving with it .",
    "multiple epoch measurements with longer time baselines , however , could discriminate between ejection and comoving scenarios by achieving the required accuracy to obtain a velocity _ difference _ vector between the individual star vectors and the average cluster vector .",
    "if the stars were ejected from the cluster , we would expect these difference vectors to point away from the cluster .",
    "the continuum - subtracted p@xmath0 mosaic of the inner @xmath86 pc@xmath11 of the gcr from ( ) is shown in figure 10 , where the positions of the known clusters and the  isolated \" massive stars are illustrated . aside from the several stars potentially associated with the arches and quintuplet clusters , some of the other new discoveries appear to reside in regions that were heretofore unidentified as potential associations .",
    "there is a noteworthy association of 3 wc9 stars , a wn7 , and an ob supergiant at @xmath104 .",
    "several promising unidentified candidates having @xmath105 and @xmath106 mag and f187n / f190n ratios consistent with them being wc or ob stars also lie in this region .",
    "this area is far from any of the known clusters , so , these stars might be the brightest representative members of a bona fide association .",
    "there is a more highly concentrated group containing a wc9d , an ofpe / wn9 , and a b2 ia star at @xmath107 , originally identified as a potentially coeval system by ( ) . in addition",

    "could these associations of massive stars represent the  tip of the iceberg \" of stellar clusters that are less compact than the arches and quintuplet ? there is no measured stellar density enhancement in the vicinity of isolated massive stars in the gcr (  ; dong et al .",
    "2011 , in preparation ) .",

    "the cluster dissolution timescale is a sensitive function of galactocentric radius , initial cluster mass , and initial density , such that less compact stellar clusters could become invisible as stellar density enhancements on a shorter timescale than the arches or quintuplet ages , or could even persist as undetectable entities for their entire lives . in such cases , an earth - based observer undertaking",

    "<S> several wc stars exhibit a relatively large infrared excess , which is possibly thermal emission from hot dust . </S>",
    "<S> most of the stars appear scattered throughout the gcr , with no relation to the three known massive young clusters ; several others lie near the arches and quintuplet clusters and may have originated within one of these systems . </S>",
