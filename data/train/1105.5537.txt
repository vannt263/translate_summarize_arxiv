    "solitons in the bec are described via the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation  @xcite which has form of one - particle nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nlse ) .",
    "the nlse plays an important role when describing the dynamics of various physical systems ; name just a few degenerated chargeless bosons and fermions as well as superconductors . a more detailed account of the interaction in comparison with the gp equation leads to the appearance of additional terms both in the gp equation and in the corresponding quantum hydrodynamics ( qhd ) equations .",
    "a similar generalization is acquired for ultracold boson - fermion mixtures  @xcite .",
    "such generalization leads to that the term depending on the spatial derivatives of the concentration ( modulus quadrate of wave - function in the medium ) appears in the nlse .",
    "different authors  @xcite ,  @xcite suggested the nlses for the description of the bec dynamic taking into account the terms depending on high degrees of concentration .",
    "the occurrence of additional terms in the gp equation leads to varying the characteristics of wave perturbations  @xcite , solitons  @xcite , vortices , dispersion shock waves , and can also lead to new types of solutions .",

    "the possibility to derive the gp equation from a microscopic many - particle schrdinger equation ( mpse ) is substantiated in  @xcite .",
    "the method of direct derivation of the gp equation from the mpse was suggested in ref .",
    "it was made by means of qhd method  @xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that the gp equation can be present in the form of hydrodynamic equations  @xcite @xmath4 and @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the concentration of particles and @xmath10 is the velocity field .",

    "@xcite , equation for bec evolution was derived in the framework of nonequilibrium thermo field dynamics . in the qhd method",

    "the first step of derivation is the definition of concentration of particles in three dimensional physical space .",
    "differentiation of concentration with respect to time and applying of the schrdinger equation leads to continuity equation , a current of density is arisen there .",
    "next step of derivation is differentiation of the current density . in this way",
    "we obtain a momentum balance equation , in another terms the euler equation .",
    "a force field exists in the obtained euler equation . for neutral particles with the short - range interaction the force field",
    "could be present in the form of a expansion in a series . in this case",
    ", the gp equation emerges when we take into account the first member of decomposition of the force field by the interaction radius .",

    "different types of solitons occur in the bec and boson - fermion mixtures . if the interaction between the bosons is repulsive @xmath15 , dark solitons that are the regions with a lowered concentration of the particles can propagate in the bec  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite .",

    "this solution appears when we account the interaction accurate to the toir . to obtain this soliton",
    "we solve the set of the qhd equations by the perturbative method suggested washimi et al .",
    "@xcite , which is widely used in the plasma physics , see for example  @xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "the obtained solution is the soliton of compression ; it exists under the condition @xmath15 ,",
    "i.e. , in the case of repulsion between the particles . the existence of such a solution can be conditioned by higher spatial concentration derivatives in the term for interaction in the toir .",

    "assuming that an increase in the sl is caused by a decrease in the interaction potential depth , the conditions of existence of equations could be considered as fulfilled .    in a general case , the fact that under the fr condition larger values of sl @xmath14 are attained , can point to the fact that a more successive account for the interaction should be necessary .    the processes and effects in the toir , along with the effects in the spinor bec  @xcite , magnetically  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite and electrical  @xcite ,  @xcite polarized bec , can play an important role when investigating bec and interatomic interaction .",

    "6 brief summary of obtained results is presented .",
    "to investigate solitons in bec , we use the set of qhd equations up to the toir approximation  @xcite .",
    "the calculation of the first member in a quantum stress tensor that corresponds to the gp equation is fulfilled in  @xcite under the condition that the particles do not interact .",
    "a more complete investigation into the conditions of derivation of the gp equation from the mpse shows that the gp equation appears in the first order by the interaction radius ( foir ) , if the particles are in an arbitrary state that can be simulated by a single - particle wave function .",
    "such a state can particularly appears as a result of strong interaction between the particles that takes place in quantum fluids .",
    "the qhd equations set for the atoms with a two - particle interaction with the potential @xmath25 and located in external field @xmath26 in the toir approximation has the form  @xcite @xmath27 and @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath28 @xmath29 where @xmath30and @xmath31 we also have @xmath32 . equations ( [ toir sol cont boze toir ] ) and ( [ toir sol eiler boze toir ] ) determine the dynamic of concentration of particles @xmath9 and velocity field @xmath10 . from equation ( [ toir sol eiler boze toir ] )",

    "consequently @xmath33 is negative , i.e. @xmath51 it corresponds to the repulsive sri .    also , from ( [ toir sol 1 order syst ] ) we obtain relation between @xmath52 and @xmath53 and their derivatives @xmath54 integrating this equation and using a boundary conditions @xmath55 we have @xmath56    in the second order by @xmath42 , from equations ( [ toir sol cont boze toir ] ) and ( [ toir sol eiler boze toir ] ) , we derive @xmath57 and @xmath58 @xmath59    in ( [ toir 2e cont eq ] ) we can express @xmath60 via @xmath61 and @xmath52 , @xmath53 _ and _ put it in equation ( [ toir sol 2 order syst ] ) . using ( [ toir sol rel for u 1d ] )",
