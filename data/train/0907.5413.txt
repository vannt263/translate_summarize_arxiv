    "the coming experiments at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , by directly exploring physics at the weak scale , are set to unveil the precise dynamics of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "indeed , the accurate measurements performed at lower energies by lep1/slc and lep2 already provide important indirect information .",
    "it is fair to say that , according to these results , the favored scenario is one in which the dynamics is weak up at least the multi - tev range and a light higgs degree of freedom exists @xcite . in recent years interesting theoretical progress , based on extra - dimensional constructions @xcite ,",
    "was also made towards the construction of higgsless theories of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "constructions along those lines have perhaps a better chance than ordinary technicolor to satisfy the electroweak precision tests .",
    "but , as far as we know right now , they compare less well to models featuring a light higgs . in the end",
    "approaches utilizing a higgs - like scalar appear more promising .",
    "quantum mechanically , a scalar particle like the higgs receives corrections to its mass - squared that are quadratically sensitive to ultraviolet ( uv ) physics , and much of the model - building activity centers on devising ways to reduce this uv sensitivity . on symmetry grounds two general classes of models",
    "exist to date : those using spontaneously broken accidental global symmetries , under which the higgs may arise as a pseudo - nambu - goldstone boson ( pngb ) @xcite , and those possessing low - scale supersymmetry . while supersymmetry has been the leading candidate for weak scale physics for several decades , the idea that higgs may be a pngb was first considered many years ago by refs .",
    "@xcite and resurrected after the proposal of little higgs theories @xcite and of holographic goldstone models @xcite . in this class of theories , the higgs boson arises as a composite particle out of some unknown strong dynamics at a scale @xmath4 .",
    "the presence of a moderate separation between the weak scale @xmath5 and @xmath4 allows to keep under control the unwanted corrections to electroweak precision observables .",
    "little higgs models aim at explaining the smallness of @xmath6 in a fully natural way , as a loop effect .",
    "holographic goldstone models , instead , content themselves by explaining @xmath7 as the result of an accidental cancellation , which does not seem implausible given that a mild hierarchy @xmath8 is sufficient in the existing models .",
    "moreover , also thanks to their somewhat less ambitious goal , holographic models can rely on a simpler structure ( symmetries , couplings , and multiplets ) than the ambitious little higgs models .",
    "thus it is fair to keep both classes of models under consideration . on the other hand ,",
    "there are models , supersymmetric or not , which do not address the issue of cancellations of quadratic divergences in the higgs mass , such as those in refs .  @xcite .",
    "in particular in the model of ref .",
    "@xcite the presence of new states at the weak scale is associated with the dark matter problem and the gauge unification constraints , rather than with electroweak symmetry breaking .    if the higgs boson is in the hundred gev range , and any new particles interacting with it are heavier , then it is possible to integrate out the heavy states and study properties of the higgs boson by an effective lagrangian technique @xcite .",
    "different approaches to an effective higgs lagrangian have been followed in the literature .",
    "a first approach consists in writing down all possible operators in a large mass expansion , without making any dynamical assumption . a second , complementary , approach",
    "consists of focusing on one very specific model , computing the effective coefficients , and scanning through the allowed parameter space . besides these two approaches , it is possible to have a third approach instead , which corresponds roughly to marrying the first two by making simple dynamical assumptions that encompass a general class of models .",
    "a specific example of this third approach is given by the strongly interacting light higgs effective lagrangian ( silh ) @xcite , which concentrates on the general scenario where the higgs is a light composite pngb , while the rest of the sm particles are elementary .",
    "which of the above approaches to choose depends on the questions one wants to ask .",
    "now , given the uncertainty of what could ( and could not ) be seen at the lhc , and the realization that several models could lead to similar first - order predictions at the lhc , we think it is important to ask structural and global questions such as : is physics at the electroweak scale natural ? is the higgs boson fundamental or composite ? if new particles are discovered , who ordered them ?",
    "are they responsible for canceling the higgs quadratic divergences ? in this regard , neither of the first two methods is adequate . for instance , in the first approach there is no assessment as to which effects are genuinely associated with the electroweak breaking dynamics and which are not . on the other hand ,",
    "the third method , based on definite dynamical assumptions , seems better suited to ask questions which are relevant to structure and dynamics .    in this paper",
    "we initiate a study to address the aforementioned structural and global questions .",
    "we adopt a top - down approach by exploring possible theoretical constraints on the sign of the higgs effective couplings from the naturalness principle and from other prime principles such as global symmetry patterns and unitarity . even though we will base our work on the silh lagrangian in ref .",
    "@xcite , most of our results do not depend on the silh assumption on the pngb nature of the higgs , and can be applied to the case of a fundamental higgs scalar , in particular to supersymmetric models .",
    "the advantage of using the silh lagrangian is power counting : we will be able to understand which operators are genuinely sensitive to the underlying strong dynamics occurring at the scale @xmath4 , as well as the relative importance of different operators when it comes to the collider phenomenology .    according to the results in ref .",
    "@xcite , the most relevant effects of a strongly - interacting light higgs are described by the following dimension - six effective operators : @xmath9 where we use the same notation as in @xcite . the operator @xmath0 renormalizes the higgs kinetic term , after the higgs gets a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) @xmath10 , and contributes to the high energy limit of the scattering amplitudes for longitudinal gauge bosons , while the operator @xmath1 modifies the higgs coupling to the sm fermions , in particular the top quark .",
    "therefore these four operators control , among other things , the higgs production rate in the gluon fusion channel and decay width in the di - photon channel @xcite .",
    "the gluon fusion channel is the dominant production mechanism of the higgs at the lhc , while the decay to two photons is the main discovery mode for a higgs mass below 140 gev .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sect : powercount ] we recall basic results for the silh lagrangian .",
    "section iii discusses theoretical constraints on the sign of the coefficient of @xmath0 , followed by section iv which considers constraints on @xmath2 , @xmath1 , and @xmath3 . in section [",
    "sect : discussion ] we present a synthesis of our results and summarize .",
    "many of our results are quite general and apply to theories with either a fundamental or composite higgs scalar . nevertheless , it will be convenient to adopt the composite higgs model as a benchmark scenario and use the silh lagrangian as a reference frame , whose results we briefly review here .    the generic scenario of higgs compositeness to which little higgs and holographic higgs models belong can be characterized as follows :    1 .   the higgs doublet @xmath11 results from some new ( strong ) dynamics broadly described by two parameters @xmath12 , the mass scale of composite states , and @xmath13 , their self - coupling . from this definition",
    "it follows that non - renormalizable higgs self - interactions are characterized by the coupling scale @xmath14 . in models where the higgs is a pngb",
    "the scale @xmath4 corresponds to the decay constant of the non - linear sigma model ( nl@xmath15 m ) .",
    "2 .   the vector bosons and the fermions of the sm are elementary up to well above the fermi scale .",
    "the vectors are coupled to the strong sector via a weak gauging of a @xmath16 subgroup of its global symmetry group @xmath17 .",
    "the fermions are coupled via the same interactions that give rise to yukawa couplings . in particular , apart from the top quark , the sm fermions are very weakly coupled to the strong dynamics .    under these assumptions",
    "( and with a two more specifications we shall explain below ) the deviations from the sm at energy @xmath18 are described at leading order by the following dimension - six effective lagrangian @xcite : @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 are the sm @xmath23 gauge couplings , respectively , and @xmath24 is the sm top yukawa coupling . our notation and definition is such that @xmath25 notice that the limiting case @xmath26 corresponds to a maximally strongly - coupled theory in the sense of naive dimensional analysis ( nda ) @xcite . however in the existing explicit models one understandably relies on a weaker coupling in order to retain computational control .",
    "for example , in the little higgs theories @xcite @xmath13 can be as weak as the typical sm coupling @xmath27 , while in the holographic higgs models @xcite it is assumed @xmath28 .",
    "we should stress that even in theories other than the composite higgs models , it is still useful to think of the new physics in terms of the generic interaction strength @xmath13 and mass scales of new particles @xmath12 .",
    "for instance in supersymmetric theories , we have @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "s in the first three lines of eq .",
    "( [ l_silh ] ) are all one - loop suppressed @xmath31 . similarly for kk - parity in extra - dimensional models . ]",
    "the coefficients @xmath32 through @xmath33 are expected to be of order 1 in a generic composite higgs model .",
    "counting of the power of @xmath12 , @xmath13 and loop factors in eq .",
    "( [ l_silh ] ) can then be understood intuitively .",
    "for example , the terms in the first three lines are obtained from similar interactions of the sm by paying a factor of @xmath34 for each additional pngb and a factor @xmath35 for each additional derivative .",
    "the terms in the fourth line are instead suppressed by a loop factor , which corresponds to assuming that in the limit @xmath36 the underlying theory is an ordinary minimally coupled gauge theory , as is the case for little higgs and holographic higgs theories .",
    "indeed the operators associated to @xmath37 and @xmath38 give rise to such effects like an anomalous magnetic moment of the sm @xmath39 boson which in minimally coupled theories only arise at the loop level .",
    "notice however that in the case of maximal nda coupling @xmath40 the terms in the fourth line are not suppressed with respect to those in the third line .",
    "finally the two operators appearing in the fifth line both violate minimal coupling and break explicitly any goldstone symmetry under which the higgs boson shifts .",
    "this property explains our parametrization of their coefficient as we will better explain below .",
    "notice that the pngb nature of the higgs was assumed only in the fifth line of eq .",
    "( [ l_silh ] ) .    as discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , the most relevant operators in higgs physics at the lhc are @xmath41 the operator associated with @xmath42 gives a contribution to to the @xmath43-parameter @xmath44 , so we expect @xmath42 to be small either for symmetry reasons ( e.g. , custodial symmetry @xcite , t - parity @xcite ) or by simple tuning .",
    "the term @xmath45 in eq .",
    "( [ l_silh ] ) gives potentially important effects but only in higgs self interactions , which are difficult to test at the lhc .",
    "the operators in the third line give subleading effects in the coupling to vector bosons , and moreover are already constrained by the lep bounds on the @xmath46 parameter .",
    "the operators in the fourth line gives potentially sizable @xmath47 effects , but only to observables like the decay rate of @xmath48 , which are difficult to study at the lhc .",
    "finally one should remark that for @xmath13 much bigger than the sm couplings , say @xmath49 like in the simple georgi - kaplan pngb higgs models @xcite , the effects of @xmath33 and @xmath50 are suppressed relative to those of @xmath32 and @xmath51 .",
    "but this is not the case in little higgs models , in which @xmath52 , and whenever there exists light colored or charged states with mass below @xmath12 .",
    "let us analyze more closely the four relevant operators in eq .",
    "( [ pc : ope ] ) . the operator",
    "@xmath0 contains four higgs fields and two derivatives , and is thus suppressed by @xmath53 using the above power counting .",
    "there are several possible sources for @xmath0 .",
    "first , integrating out heavy vectors and scalars coupling to the higgs field at the tree - level will induce @xmath0 regardless of whether the higgs is a pngb or not . secondly ,",
    "if the higgs is a pngb , there are additional contributions from the nl@xmath15 m .",
    "in section [ sect : oh ] we will discuss these effects in detail . on the other hand , @xmath1 breaks the same global symmetry as the sm yukawa coupling , and has two more higgs fields than the yukawa coupling , which explain the @xmath54 suppression .",
    "the coefficient of @xmath2 and @xmath3 can be understood in various ways .",
    "for instance the coefficient of @xmath2 can be written as @xmath55 by which @xmath56 counts the external sm gluon legs , @xmath57 counts the operator dimension , @xmath58 counts the fact that these operators arise at one - loop level in minimally coupled theories , and finally @xmath59 represents the goldstone boson suppression .",
    "in fact @xmath2 and @xmath3 break the goldstone shift symmetry @xmath60 in precisely the same way the higgs mass term does .",
    "( [ countcg ] ) then follows by assuming that no couplings , other than @xmath61 , break the goldstone shift symmetry that protects the higgs mass .",
    "therefore , quite generally , by symmetry and dimensional analysis the coefficient of @xmath2 can be estimated by attaching four derivatives ( the field - strength squared ) to the generic contribution to the higgs mass term : @xmath62 assuming the heavy particle with mass @xmath12 cuts off the higgs quadratic divergence , @xmath63 , we obtain again eq .",
    "( [ countcg ] ) .",
    "our power counting thus applies to more general scenarios than composite higgs models , such as weak - scale supersymmetry .",
    "it is worth commenting that in an unnatural theory effects of @xmath2 and @xmath3 could be larger . in the case where the higgs mass is light simply because of a tuning between the bare mass term and the radiative corrections , @xmath64 , then the proper parametrization for @xmath2 and @xmath3 , barring additional tunings ,",
    "would be @xmath65 with @xmath66 .",
    "the above result gives sizable @xmath67 effects even when the lightest new states are rather heavy with @xmath68 tev . keeping this comment on unnatural theories in mind , in the rest of this section we will only focus on the pngb case .",
    "aside from the above discussion of the physics underlying the silh lagrangian , a final technical comment is in order .",
    "the form of a lagrangian can be changed , without affecting the physics , by reparametrizing the field variables .",
    "this well - known fact is particularly important when dealing with effective lagrangians based on a large mass expansion . in our case , reparametrizing the fields by treating @xmath53 as a small parameter , or , equivalently using the leading order equations of motion , the form of the dimension - six effective lagrangian can be modified without affecting physics at @xmath69 . in eq .",
    "( [ l_silh ] ) a specific field parametrization was chosen so as to remove that redundancy . more specifically , by using the reparametrization freedom",
    "@xmath70 the operator @xmath71 was removed in the silh lagrangian @xcite .",
    "indeed it is easy to see that , under eq .",
    "( [ repara ] ) , the higgs kinetic term transforms as @xmath72 while the yukawa interaction transforms as @xmath73 we thus deduce the useful operator identity ( satisfied on the sm equations of motion , and neglecting the higgs potential ) @xmath74 equivalently defining the coefficient of @xmath75 to be @xmath76 , then under reparametrization of the higgs field in eq .",
    "( [ repara ] ) we have @xmath77 with all other coefficients unaffected .",
    "notice that the top yukawa coupling in the sm is defined as @xmath78 in our convention , hence the sign of the shift in @xmath51 . starting from a generic lagrangian with @xmath79 ,",
    "the silh basis is obtained by choosing @xmath80 .",
    "therefore parameters in the silh basis are related to those in a general basis by @xmath81 physical amplitudes should depend only on reparametrization - invariant combination of parameters .",
    "( [ repara ] ) is an instance of a reparametrization of the dynamical variables in the composite sector to which the higgs is assumed to belong . on the other hand ,",
    "the vectors and fermions of the sm are assumed to be elementary .",
    "technically this means ( assumption 2 at the beginning of this section ) that there exists a parametrization of the corresponding fields such that , neglecting the small effects of yukawa couplings , all new physics effects are described by `` oblique '' operators which involve only vector bosons and higgses .",
    "( [ l_silh ] ) is derived by working in such a basis , which is the same basis as employed in ref .",
    "one advantage of working in this basis is that there are no corrections to vertices between sm vectors and fermions , allowing for a simple parametrization of the electroweak precision parameters .",
    "a generic operator basis can be obtained from ours by performing the following covariant redefinition of low - energy gauge fields : @xmath82 under which @xmath32 , @xmath83 , and @xmath42 shift . moreover , from the gauge - covariant derivative in the fermion kinetic term , operators such as @xmath84 are generated , which modify sm vector - fermion vertices .",
    "when integrating out heavy vectors by working in the mass eigenbasis such terms are generically obtained . on the other hand , by working in the interaction eigenbasis @xcite , that is defining the low - energy vector as the one that couples to the sm fermion , only oblique operators are generated .",
    "needless to say , the low - energy physics does not depend on which interpolating fields we choose , as long as the one we keep fixed ( as the low - energy field ) has a non - vanishing matrix element @xmath85 between the vacuum and the light gauge boson .    using the parametrization in eq .",
    "( [ l_silh ] ) we can compute on - shell amplitudes of production , decay , and scattering processes .",

    "notice that by the last estimate we indicate collectively both @xmath364 in the top sector and @xmath350 in the vector sector , which in given models could be quantitatively quite different .",
    "in fact we know that in little higgs model @xmath365 is preferred to be large , by naturalness considerations , while @xmath350 is preferred to be small by the constraint on the @xmath46 parameter .",
    "we will consider the expected size of @xmath6 in two broadly defined scenarios : the composite higgs model without the collective breaking mechanism ( ncb ) , which includes the original georgi - kaplan model and the holographic higgs model , and the little higgs models ( lh ) which implement the collective breaking .",
    "the two scenarios differ in the way they engineer a hierarchy in @xmath366 : : = o(1)_ncb , : = o ( ) _ lh , where the @xmath367 s quantify the amount of tuning in electroweak symmetry breaking . in the absence of fine - tuning , @xmath368 , there is no separation in the two scales @xmath369 and @xmath4 in the ncb models while a separation of one - loop order is achieved in lh theories via the collective breaking mechanism . in this case",
    "the @xmath6 effect in lh is always smaller than in the ncb models by a loop factor , unless @xmath370 .",
    "( however in this case the higgs mass in lh is fine - tuned and collective breaking does not work . )",
    "the situation changes when one considers precision electroweak constraints such as the @xmath46 parameter @xcite : 210 ^ -3 ~ .",
    "the contribution to @xmath371 in both ncb and lh models , barring t - parity , is given by ~ = .",
    "therefore the @xmath46 parameter requires [ eq : voverf ] = , which can be achieved in lh theories without fine - tuning , @xmath372 , while in ncb the amount of fine - tuning necessary is @xmath58 .",
    "the relative importance of the @xmath93 effects from @xmath0 and @xmath1 is determined by comparing eq .",

    "we need @xmath374 , otherwise the higgs quartic coupling @xmath375 is too small and the higgs mass is below the direct experimental lower bound . in lh ,",
    "instead , the quartic coupling arises at tree level @xmath376 and thus the lower bound on the higgs mass does not constrain @xmath13 , which can be as small as @xmath377 .",
    "of course in both ncb and lh the constraint @xmath378 is required to have some calculability .",
    "but notice also that in ncb models bigger @xmath13 means less tuning is needed to satisfy eq .",
    "( [ eq : voverf ] ) . in the end ,",
    "@xmath6 in ncb models is expected to be much larger that the typical sm one - loop effect , while in lh models @xmath6 can be as small as the typical sm one - loop effect . however , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , precision electroweak constraints do not prefer such a low value of @xmath6 in lh , which can conceivably be slightly bigger without making the lh model less plausible ( that is more fine - tuned ) .",
    "the only lh model where @xmath27 is mandated is the one with t - parity , in which case precision electroweak constraints are avoided due to t - parity .",
    "we conclude that , in a significant region of parameter space of ncb and lh , the effects associated to @xmath32 and @xmath51 do stand out over the ` background ' of ordinary one - loop effects within the sm . especially for ncb models where",
    "@xmath6 is favored large , effects of @xmath32 and @xmath51 have a chance of being detectable at the lhc .",
    "needless to say , they are surely of interest for precision measurements at a linear collider working as the higgs factory .",
    "now we discuss the second class of effects , focusing on @xmath2 .",
    "as mentioned above , the size of the effect here comparing to the sm contribution is = .",
    "so , even without fine - tuning , in lh models this effect is formally one sm - loop smaller than the sm top effect , i.e. it is of the order of nlo effects in the sm . in ncb theories , given the fine - tuning necessary to satisfy the @xmath46 parameter , this is also suppressed by a sm loop factor , without the @xmath379 enhancement seen in the first class of effect .",
    "however , if the higgs is naturally light and close to the lep lower bound , the top quadratic divergence in the higgs mass is cut off by the top partner , m_h^2 ~ m_t^2 , which implies @xmath380 is only a few hundreds gev .",
    "therefore , it is important to stress that , although formally a loop factor , @xmath364 could end up being numerically important .",
    "it is finally worth mentioning a class of models for which the silh power counting does not apply because of symmetry reasons and the ( more ) fundamental nature of the higgs .",
    "this class includes models with a fundamental higgs scalar and a new parity at the tev scale , such as the r - parity in supersymmetry and kk - parity in extra - dimension @xcite . in this case",
    "the higgs sector does not belong to a nl@xmath15 m ( below at least tens of tev ) and the only contributions to @xmath32 and @xmath51 come from integrating out heavy vectors and scalars , which can only be loop - induced due to the new parity .",
    "then @xmath32 and @xmath51 are in the order of @xmath381 , where we have taken the typical coupling strength associated with the heavy particle to be @xmath61 , as is the case in existing literature .",
    "furthermore , the scale @xmath4 is defined as the ratio of the heavy mass @xmath382 with @xmath61 . as such ,",
    "these effects are much smaller than the sm one - loop effect . on the other hand ,",
    "the effects in @xmath33 and @xmath50 are still suppressed by @xmath383 , which could turn out to be numerically important if @xmath382 is not too far from the mass of the sm particles associated in the process .",
    "we summarize the discussion above as follows :    * the effects of @xmath32 and @xmath51 can stand out over sm loop effects for ncb and lh models with @xmath384 . on the other hand , for the same models ,",
    "the effects of @xmath33 and @xmath50 are formally of order @xmath31 with respect to the leading sm contribution .",

    "the higgs is a fundamental scalar up to at least tens of tev and there is a new parity at the tev scale to suppress tree level effects from integrating out heavy particles .    a final word of caution : when we classify effects as being @xmath386 one - loop in sm , it is important to keep in mind that in the sm there is indeed a wide spectrum of one - loop effects ranging from @xmath387 , appearing in electroweak precision quantities , to @xmath388 , controlling threshold corrections to the higgs mass from heavy states .",
    "our estimate of the size of the effects has to be taken _",

    "<S> if further assuming a collective breaking mechanism as in little higgs theories , the coefficient of @xmath0 remains positive even in the presence of triplet scalars . in the end , we conclude that the gluon fusion production of the higgs boson is reduced from the sm rate in all composite higgs models . </S>",
