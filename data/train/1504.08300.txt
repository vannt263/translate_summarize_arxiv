    "the second localization of electrons is around a k@xmath188 point at @xmath189 .",

    "[ charge_vs_fnew.pdf ] for four independent combinations of the field and current directions , @xmath157 , @xmath158 , @xmath159 , and @xmath160 .",
    "a remarkable property of these results is that in all cases , except for @xmath160 , the charge transferred changes its sign as the field amplitude increases .",
    "this can be attributed to the increased number of electrons experiencing the bragg reflections at the brillouin zone boundary , especially at the k - points , with the field increase .",
    "thus this sign change of the transferred charge has the same origin as the current oscillations in fig .",
    "[ current_dynamics.pdf ] as described above .",

    "focused spot , this gives a @xmath201 transferred charge .",
    "such a charge is on the same order of magnitude as in experiments refs .",
    "@xcite and is , in principle , reliably observable .",
    "the accumulation of charge @xmath198 transferred through the system implies a dramatic manifestation of symmetry violation .",
    "this charge accumulation violates simultaneously the parity symmetry ( p - symmetry ) and the charge - inversion symmetry ( c - symmetry ) .",
    "this violation happens due to the fact that our pulse is short and has a controlled cep ( zero in our case ) : the maximum field is reached at the maximum of the envelope ( instance @xmath165 ) .",
    "due to strong nonlinearity of the system for fields @xmath202 applied , this maximum field defines a selected direction in the system plane for the force acting on electrons .",
    "this causes the violation of the c- and p - symmetries .",
    "this is actually a general property for systems subjected to a short , strong , cep - controlled pulses .",
    "it takes place in both two - dimensional solids such as graphene , silicene , germanene , and also conventional three - dimensional solids such as fused silica , sapphire , etc .",
    "in particular , it was a fundamental origin for the charge transfer in silica and quartz in original experiments @xcite .",
    "a symmetry violation specific for silicene is related to the electron transfer between the sublattices caused by the normal field component @xmath9 , which effectively reduces the system s symmetry from hexagonal to triangular .",
    "this causes non - reciprocity : @xmath203 and the appearance of a cross - current , @xmath204 .",
    "note that anisotropicity in the @xmath27 plane , @xmath205 , is inherent in both silicene and graphene .",
    "our zero - cep pulse is t - symmetric ; in the absence of the t - symmetry violation , the current should be t - odd , which would preclude the accumulation of charges after the pulse .",
    "however , we have seen from the results of figs .",
    "[ current_dynamics.pdf](a)-(c ) that the current is not anti - symmetric in time , i.e. , there is a significant violation of the t - symmetry , which we attribute to the landau damping .",
    "this is inherent in both graphene and silicene and is due to the absence of a significant band gap ; this is in contrast to silica that is almost perfectly t - reversible @xcite .",
    "an additional contribution to t - irreversibility stems from the fact that the frequency associated with the electron transfer in the normal direction , @xmath206 , is on the same order as the carrier frequency of the pulse .",
    "this causes resonant absorption of the excitation pulse and the landau damping , specific for the silicene ( and also germanene ) . if adiabaticity were present , it would have guaranteed reversibility and would have forbidden the charge accumulation .",
    "finally , we note a close analogy of silicene with the field - effect transistor ( fet ) @xcite . in fet ,",
    "the gate field , applied normally to the conducting channel , changes the carrier populations in it and , thereby , controls its conductance .",
    "analogously , in silicene , the normal field component , @xmath9 , transfers carriers to one of the sublattices , a or b , thereby changing the system s response to the in - plane field . a fundamental difference ( and advantage ) of silicene",
    "is that such a `` device '' works at optical frequencies , with the response time on the ( sub)femtosecond scale .",
