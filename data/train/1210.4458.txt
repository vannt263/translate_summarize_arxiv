    "spectral - hole - burning ( shb ) laser frequency stabilization  @xcite in eu@xmath0-doped y@xmath1sio@xmath2  has recently approached the performance of state - of - the - art cavity - stabilized llos  @xcite and indirect measurements suggest that the fundamental noise floor may be significantly lower . because of the long lifetime of spectral holes ( of order @xmath3  s at 3.7  k @xcite ) , the large number of dopant ions within a crystal ( of order @xmath4/@xmath5 ) , and the narrow linewidth of each absorber , such crystals can serve as precise memories for laser frequency .",

    "the narrow @xmath6f@xmath7@xmath8@xmath9d@xmath7  optical transition of each eu@xmath0  ion is shifted by the local crystal field , which is slightly random , such that each eu@xmath0  dopant has a fixed transition frequency within the typical 1 - 30 ghz inhomogeneous linewidth .",

    "the resonant population of eu@xmath0  ions is excited by the laser , and a significant fraction decays into different hyperfine levels , causing a transparency , or spectral - hole , at the laser frequency .",
    "high - resolution spectroscopy has shown that the environmental sensitivity of eu@xmath0:y@xmath1sio@xmath2  spectral holes to temperature , pressure , and accelerations are all smaller than that of fabry - prot cavities @xcite , and frequency drift rates can be lower than those of cavity - stabilized lasers @xcite .",
    "these results suggest that spectral holes in eu@xmath0:y@xmath1sio@xmath2  could form a frequency - stable flywheel for optical atomic clocks and potentially extend the coherence time of atom - laser interactions .    unlike fabry - prot cavities , whose oscillation period is directly proportional to an artificial length , the optical frequency of spectral holes depends primarily on the atomic hamiltonian of dopant ions .",
    "spectral holes are less sensitive to mechanical perturbations , which couple only weakly through the field of the host crystal , but may be more sensitive to ambient electric and magnetic fields . moreover , probing of the spectral holes causes additional burning that can modify the hole shape and frequency .",

    "temperature - dependent shifts are also measured , and it is shown that the linear dependence of the hole frequency on temperature can be eliminated by placing the crystal inside a sealed chamber that is filled with a particular pressure of helium gas . with the current level of environmental stability , fluctuations in these frequency shifts are small enough to allow for laser stabilization with a fractional - frequency noise floor below @xmath10 .",
