    "the main advantage of these three - body decays comes from the possibility of performing a dalitz analysis , which allows to reduce the typical eight - fold ambiguity in the determination of @xmath15 to only a two - fold ambiguity @xcite .",
    "moreover the ratio @xmath19 of the cabibbo allowed over the cabibbo suppressed amplitudes , which in the two - body decays is about 0.02 , is expected here to be quite large ( about 0.4 ) in some regions of the dalitz plot .",
    "this parameter is directly related to the sensitivity to .",
    "the ambition of the analysis technique is to be completely model independent , in the sense that at high statistics it will not rely on any theoretical assumption : all quantities will be directly extracted from the fit on data .",
    "a sensitivity study of the channel can be found in  @xcite . here ,",
    "following the same approach , we complete it with simulations making use of realistic background distributions , resolution and tagging performances taken from the @xmath0 run1 - 4 data sample .",
    "the model assumed for the decay parameterizes the amplitude @xmath20 at each point @xmath21 of the dalitz plot as a sum of two - body decay matrix elements and a non - resonant term according to the isobar model  @xcite : @xmath22 where @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) indicates the cabibbo allowed ( suppressed ) decay in each point @xmath21 of the dalitz plot .",
    "each term of the sum is parameterized with an amplitude ( @xmath25 or @xmath26 ) and a phase ( @xmath27 or @xmath28 , where the @xmath29 index indicates the non resonant ) .",
    "the factor @xmath30 gives the lorentz invariant expression for the matrix element of a resonance @xmath31 as a function of the position @xmath21 in the @xmath32 dalitz plot ; the functional dependence varies with the spin @xmath33 of the resonance , the mass @xmath34 and the decay width @xmath35 .",
    "the time dependent evolution can be obtained from the resolution of the schroedinger equation , leading to the following expression : @xmath36 with : @xmath37 where @xmath38 ( -1 ) if the tagged initial state is a @xmath7 ( @xmath39 ) , @xmath40 ( -1 ) if the final state contains a @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) , and @xmath43 is the proper time interval between the reconstructed @xmath32 ( @xmath44 ) and the tagging @xmath32 ( @xmath45 ) . @xmath46 and @xmath47 are respectively the @xmath7 decay width and its mixing frequency .",
    "thanks to the presence of the terms @xmath30 which vary over the dalitz plot , we can fit the amplitudes ( @xmath25 ) and the phases ( @xmath27 ) of eq .",
