    "analytical models @xcite claim that in general well - behaved photospheric motions will not lead to the formation of current sheets , and that only a discontinuous velocity field can form discontinuities in the coronal magnetic field , and counterexamples of well - behaved solutions of the magnetostatic equations have been reported @xcite .",
    "alternatively @xcite proposed that the random character of footpoint motions might generate , on time - scales much longer than photospheric convection time - scales , uniformly distributed small - scale current layers that would heat the corona without forming discontinuous structures .",
    "numerical simulations of boundary forced models @xcite suggest that the nonlinear dynamics of this system can be modeled as a magnetically dominated instance of magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence , implicitly implying that current sheets thickness is limited only by numerical diffusion ( i.e. , resolution ) in dissipative mhd .",
    "but recent simulations of the decay of an initially braided magnetic configuration @xcite have shown that in some instances the system forms only large - scale current layers of thickness much larger than the resolution scale , in stark contrast with the recent result supporting the development of finite time singularities in the cold plasma regime @xcite .",
    "furthermore , recent investigations suggest that the rate of magnetic reconnection can be very fast in low collisional plasmas , both in the mhd @xcite and the collisionless regime @xcite . therefore , in order to have an x - ray corona , it is _ critical _ that current sheets form , but only _ above _ a magnetic energy threshold . indeed the energy flux injected in the corona by photospheric motions is the average poynting flux @xmath8 @xcite , that depends not only on the photospheric velocity @xmath9 and the axial guide field @xmath0 , but also on the dynamic magnetic field @xmath1 , and if dissipation keeps low the value of @xmath3 , the flux @xmath10 will be too low to sustain the corona @xcite .    in this letter",

    "the magnetic field loses energy at high wavenumbers ( figure  [ fig : fig1 ] , inset @xmath79 ) , thus current sheets disappear , and the system relaxes to a stage with @xmath80 of the initial magnetic energy and a very small velocity . at the same time an _ inverse cascade _",
    "occurs , transferring energy at the largest scales ( particularly in mode @xmath81 ) , so that the asymptotic state consists of large - scale magnetic islands , with large - scale current layers and no current sheets , and this process can be described as the 2d analog of taylor relaxation @xcite .    for this 2d case ( periodic boundary conditions , with @xmath59 ) given a solution of eqs .",

    "when the same initial condition is used with _ line - tying _ boundary conditions , the system is no longer invariant along @xmath35 , as now the velocity must vanish at the top and bottom plates @xmath88 , therefore the velocity can not develop uniformly along z as in the periodic case .    the temporal evolution of total energy for line - tied simulations with different values of @xmath86 is shown in figure  [ fig : fig2 ] . while the dynamics of the system with @xmath89 is similar to the 2d case with energy dissipating @xmath90 of its initial value ,",
    "the behavior is increasingly different for lower values of @xmath86 , with less energy getting dissipated . for @xmath91 no significant energy dissipation nor decay are observed , and also for the decaying cases their dynamics are quenched once energy crosses this threshold . as shown in the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] energies decay with different power - law indices , indicating that self - similarity is lost and new dynamics emerge .",
    "there are therefore two _ antagonistic _ forces at work .",
    "the system starts to behave as in the 2d case , with the tension of perpendicular field lines @xmath92 creating an orthogonal velocity , that coupled with all others _ nonlinear terms _ are the only ones that can cascade energy and generate current sheets .",
    "but this displaces the total line - tied ( axially directed ) field lines , and is then opposed by the axial tension @xmath93 that resists bending , and together with the other _ linear term _",
    "@xmath94 tends to impose the vanishing boundary velocity in the whole box .",
    "furthermore the pattern of the boundary velocity does not match that of the velocity generated by the nonlinear terms in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : eq1])-([eq : eq2 ] ) ( also for @xmath95 ) .",
    "consequently line - tying opposes current sheet formation , more efficiently the smaller the value of @xmath96 .    , and the 2d simulation with @xmath89 .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] ]    for a low ratio of @xmath97 the axial field line tension dominates and impedes the formation of current sheets .",

    "normalized energy dissipation rate @xmath101 ( @xmath102 ) decreases sharply for lower values of @xmath97 , with the 2d case reaching a higher dissipative peak .",
    "we have performed similar sets of simulations with different initial conditions , including more modes besides @xmath51 , and they show a similar behavior to that shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : fig1]-[fig : fig3 ] and will be described in detail in an upcoming paper .",
    "we conclude that current sheets form when the orthogonal lorentz force @xmath92 is stronger than the field line tension term @xmath93 . from initial condition ( [ eq : pot4 ] ) we can estimate the gradient lenght - scale of @xmath3 in the orthogonal direction as @xmath103 , while line - tying will yield a lenght - scale of @xmath104 for the variation of @xmath3 along @xmath35 .",

    "provided the value of magnetic fluctuations @xmath3 is beyond the threshold ( [ eq : th ] ) , we have shown that current sheets form on fast ideal timescales , with their thickness reaching the resolution scale in the ideal case . below this threshold",
    "the field - line tension of the line - tied magnetic field lines inhibits the dynamics and the formation of current sheets , thus the solutions remain regular . as mentioned in the introduction",

    "indeed the majority of these equilibria ( section [ sec : eq ] ) do not have the highly symmetric fields required for linear instability as , e.g. , for kink or other cases @xcite .",
    "furthermore the magnetic field induced by _ disordered _ photospheric motions is not symmetric , and in general will not be in equilibrium .    in our case",
