    "lattices and codes based on lattices have been considered as one of potential transmission schemes for point - to - point communications for decades .",
    "consider the additive white gaussian ( awgn ) channel @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the received signal , @xmath6 is the transmitted signal with input power constraint @xmath7 , and @xmath8 . in @xcite , de buda showed that one can use lattices shaped by a proper thick shell to reliably communicate under rates arbitrarily close to the channel capacity @xmath9 where @xmath10 represents the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "this result was then corrected by linder _",
    "@xcite which states that with de buda s approach , only those lattice points that lie inside a thin spherical region are allowed to be used in order to achieve the rates promised by de buda , which destroys the desired lattice structure .",
    "urbanke and rimoldi @xcite then showed that lattice codes with the minimum angle decoder can achieve the channel capacity . on the other hand , for lattice codes with lattice decoding , it was long believed that they can only achieve @xmath11 @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "erez and zamir finally showed that lattice codes can achieve the channel capacity with lattice decoding with the help of nested lattice shaping and an mmse estimator at the receiver .",
    "erez and zamir s coding scheme is based on sequences of nested lattices that are constructed by construction a @xcite @xcite .",
    "recently , lattices have been adopted to many problems in networks and their benefits have gone beyond merely practical aspects @xcite . in many networks ( e.g. @xcite )",
    ", it has been shown that the lattice structure enables one to exploit the structural gains induced by the channels and hence achieve higher rates than that provided by random codes . in most of these examples ,",
    "the coding schemes are based on the random ensemble of nested lattice codes from construction a by erez and zamir @xcite . on one hand , this ensemble of nested lattice codes is known for its ability of producing capacity - achieving lattice codes and its structure which is suitable for many problems in network communications . on the other hand , decoding of a construction",
    "a lattice typically depends on decoding the underlying linear code implemented over a prime field whose size has to be large in order to have a good lattice code @xcite @xcite .",
    "this results in a large decoding complexity for lattices and codes based on them .    to alleviate this drawback ,",
    "in this paper , we propose a novel lattice construction called construction @xmath2 ( previously called product construction in @xcite a precursor of this paper ) that can be thought of as a generalization of construction a to codes which can be represented as the cartesian product of @xmath0 linear codes over different prime fields @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 .",
    "this generalization is enabled by a ring isomorphism between the product of prime fields and the quotient ring @xmath15 which is guaranteed by chinese remainder theorem ( crt ) . due to the multilevel nature",
    ", the construction @xmath2 lattices admit multistage decoding which decodes the coset representatives level by level . this construction",
    "is then shown to be able to produce lattices that are good for channel coding ( poltyrev - limit achieving ) under multistage decoding and good for quantization .",
    "this allows one to achieve the poltyrev - limit with a substantially lower decoding complexity as now the complexity is dominated by the code over the prime field with the largest size rather than the product of them .    as an example , construction @xmath2 lattices are then adopted for communication over the awgn channel . in order to achieve the ultimate shaping gain of 1.53 db",
    ", efficient shaping techniques have to be employed .",
    "we tailor a recently proposed construction of nested lattice codes by ordentlich and erez @xcite specifically for our construction @xmath2 lattices .",
    "we then show that this construction is able to produce a sequence of nested lattice codes that can achieve the awgn channel capacity under multistage decoding , which again substantially reduces decoding complexity .",
    "lattices generated by the construction @xmath2 preserve most of the structure of construction a lattices with codes over prime fields and hence can be applied to most of the applications using lattices from such construction . however",
    ", there are some subtle differences between these constructions that may have a bearing on the application at hand . for e.g.",
    ", lattices built from construction @xmath2 appear to be ideally suited for lattice index coding @xcite @xcite and more so than other known constructions .",
    "lattices from construction @xmath2 have been considered for the compute - and - forward paradigm @xcite in @xcite . in this case , the set of integer combinations that can be decoded and forwarded may be smaller than those from construction a since in effect the modulo operation at the relay is only over a ring instead of over a prime field .",
    "we also provide a generalization of construction @xmath2 to codes over rings .",
    "this generalization is called construction @xmath3 and subsumes construction a , construction d @xcite ( * ? ? ?",
    "* page 232 ) , and construction @xmath2 as special cases .",
    "the main idea which allows this generalization is from the observation made in @xcite indicating the connection between construction d and construction a with codes over rings .",

    "we begin by noting that any lattice @xmath31 generated by construction a can be written as ( up to scaling ) @xmath397 , where @xmath124 is a coded level resulting from mapping a @xmath119 linear code to @xmath398 via a ring isomorphism and @xmath399 can be viewed as an uncoded level . as shown in @xcite",
    ", one can first reduce the received signal by performing @xmath400 .",
    "this will make the equivalent channel a @xmath401 channel .",
    "when the underlying linear code is capacity - achieving for the @xmath401 channel , the probability of error for the first level can be made arbitrarily small .",
    "moreover , by choosing @xmath131 arbitrarily large , the probability that one would decode to a wrong lattice point inside the same coset can be made arbitrarily small .",
    "i.e. , the probability of error for the second level can be made arbitrarily small .",
    "_ in @xcite showed the existence of a sequence of lattices that is good for channel coding under the above two conditions .    in the following",
    ", we closely follow the steps in @xcite to show the existence of lattices that are good for channel coding generated by our construction .",
    "let @xmath158 be a collection of distinct odd primes .",
    "similar to lattices from construction a , a construction @xmath2 lattice can be written as @xmath402 where @xmath124 is obtained from the steps 1 ) and 2 ) in section  [ sec : prod_const ] and @xmath403 is an uncoded level .",
    "similar to @xcite , the probability of error in the uncoded level can be made arbitrarily small when we choose @xmath404 sufficiently large .",
    "therefore , one then has to show that the linear code @xmath178 over @xmath405 together with the mapping @xmath133 is capacity - achieving for the @xmath401 channel under multistage decoding .",
    "now , by the chain rule of mutual information @xcite , one has that @xmath406 hence , the only task remained is showing that linear codes over @xmath163 can achieve the conditional mutual information @xmath407 .",
    "note that in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section iii.a ) , it is shown that the average error probability @xmath408 over the ensemble of random linear codes ( form a balanced set ) exponentially decays with @xmath30 for all rates smaller than the capacity if the channel is regular .",
    "if we randomly choose one code from this ensemble , by markov inequality , we have @xmath409 where @xmath410 is the probability of error and @xmath411 .",
    "this guarantees that by randomly picking a code from this ensemble , with probability @xmath368 , the error probability is not deviated too much from its average which is exponentially decayed in @xmath30 .",
    "we now follow the proof in @xcite and show that the equivalent channel at each level is regular in the sense of delsarte and piret @xcite . as restated in @xcite , a channel with transition probabilities @xmath412 is regular if the input alphabet can be identified with an abelian group @xmath413 that acts on the output alphabet @xmath414 by permutation . in other words ,",
    "if a set of permutations @xmath415 can be defined such that @xmath416 for all @xmath417 and @xmath418 such that @xmath419 depends only on @xmath420 .",
    "note that since we are considering the @xmath401 channel , the additive noise is actually the @xmath421-aliased gaussian noise given by @xmath422 where @xmath423 is the gaussian density function with zero mean and variance @xmath424 .    now , suppose we are at the @xmath239th level s decoding .",
    "i.e. , all the codewords in the previous levels have been successfully decoded .",
    "the receiver first subtracts out the contribution from the previous levels by @xmath425 .",
    "we show that the equivalent channel seen at the @xmath239th level s decoding is regular . for @xmath426 define @xmath427 where @xmath428 for @xmath429 and none of these vectors are exactly the same",
    ". therefore , there are total @xmath430 possibilities .",
    "also , note that the ordering of elements in @xmath431 does not matter and can be arbitrarily placed .",
    "thus , given the previously decoded codewords , @xmath431 is fully determined by @xmath60 .",
    "for @xmath432 , let us now define the following , @xmath433 one can verify that @xmath434 where @xmath435 for @xmath429 and ( a ) follows from the fact that @xmath133 is an isomorphism .",
    "now , since the mapping from @xmath436 to @xmath437 is bijective for all odd primes @xmath131 , it is clear that none of @xmath438 for @xmath429 are the same so one can rearrange to get @xmath416 .",
    "let @xmath426 be transmitted , the transition probability is given by @xmath439 which only depends on @xmath420 .",
    "hence the equivalent channel experienced by the @xmath239th level is regular and linear codes suffice to achieve the mutual information . repeating this argument to each level",
    "shows that multilevel coding and multistage decoding suffice to achieve the capacity .",
    "let @xmath440 where @xmath441 is chosen to be the largest value in @xmath442 such that @xmath115 is a product of @xmath443 distinct primes . for some @xmath444 ,",
    "for every @xmath164 , choose @xmath445 such that @xmath446 where @xmath447 .",
    "in this subsection , we show that with the above choice of parameters , almost all lattices in the construction @xmath2 ensemble satisfy @xmath448 for some @xmath449 to be specified later .    here",
    ", we do not specify how each @xmath394 grows with respect to @xmath30 ; instead , we only fixes the scaling of @xmath440 and confines @xmath0 to be sub - linear in @xmath30 .",
    "note that for any fixed @xmath0 , the smallest @xmath115 is the product of the first @xmath0 primes , i.e. , the primorial @xmath450 which scales like @xmath451 .",
    "therefore , with @xmath0 sub - linear in @xmath30 , the scaling of each @xmath394 with respect to @xmath30 can be very slow .",
    "recall that the normalized second moment @xmath50 is invariant to scaling . here",
    ", we choose to work with a scaled ( by @xmath452 ) lattice @xmath453 where @xmath454 for some @xmath455 which will serve an upper bound on the second moment of @xmath31 asymptotically . for any @xmath456 , define the mse distortion @xmath457 for any @xmath458 $ ] where @xmath459 , define @xmath460 $ ] and let @xmath461 .",
    "note that each @xmath462 is uniformly distributed over @xmath463 as each @xmath464 is uniformly distributed over @xmath465 and @xmath133 is a ring isomorphism",
    ". we can then follow ( * ? ? ? * ( 14)-(16 ) ) and show that for all @xmath466 and @xmath456 , @xmath467 where @xmath468 is the volume of an @xmath30-dimensional ball with radius 1 .",
    "note that the reason that we exclude those all - zeros sub - messages is because those would make @xmath469 non - uniform and hence make the analysis more involved .",
    "however , including those points will only help the quantization and hence , the above inequality is valid .",
    "recall that @xmath440 .",
    "this in turns provides @xmath470    following the similar probabilistic arguments in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( 18)-(19 ) ) , we define the indicator random variable related to the point @xmath456 @xmath471 since each @xmath472 occurs with probability @xmath473 , one can use chebyshev s inequality to get @xmath474 now , note that @xmath475 and @xmath476 are statistically independent unless @xmath477 for some @xmath478 and some @xmath164 .",
    "therefore , @xmath479 we then plug into to get @xmath480    using the above inequality , one can bound the expectation of the distortion over the ensemble of lattices and @xmath481 which may have arbitrary distribution as @xmath482}\\right ) ,      \\ ] ] which tends to @xmath483 if is satisfied .    as in @xcite",
    ", picking @xmath481 to have uniform distribution over @xmath484 allows one to relate the mse to the second moment of the lattice .",
    "thus , @xmath485 and hence @xmath486 .",
    "moreover , the volume of the normalized fundamental voronoi region of @xmath31 is lower bounded by @xmath487 where ( a ) becomes an equality if and only if every @xmath488 is full rank and ( b ) follows from the choice of . with the expectation of the second moment and the volume of the normalized fundamental voronoi region , one can then bound the expectation of the normalized second moment over the ensemble of lattices as @xmath489 after this , by applying the markov inequality , we have @xmath490 where @xmath411 . therefore , with probability @xmath368 , the lattice from the ensemble satisfies @xmath491 , where @xmath492 .",
