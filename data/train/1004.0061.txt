    "magnetic fields of galaxies , stars or planets are produced by homogenous dynamo action in which a conducting fluid flow provides for generation and maintenance of field energy . during the past decade",
    "the understanding of the field generation mechanism has considerably benefitted from the examination of dynamo action in the laboratory .",
    "however , realization of dynamo action at least requires the magnetic reynolds number @xmath1 to exceed a threshold of the order of @xmath2 . from the parameter values of liquid sodium  the best known liquid conductor  at standard laboratory conditions ( i.e. @xmath3c , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the vacuum permeability and @xmath7 the electrical conductivity ) it becomes immediately obvious that self excitation of magnetic fields in the laboratory needs typical velocity magnitudes of @xmath8 , which is already quite demanding .",
    "therefore , the first successful dynamo experiments performed by @xcite utilized soft - iron material so that the magnetic diffusivity is reduced and the magnetic reynolds number is ( at least locally ) increased . although these experiments can not be classified as hydromagnetic dynamos ( no fluid flow and therefore no backreaction of the field on a fluid motion ) they allowed the examination of distinct dynamical regimes manifested in steady , oscillating or reversing fields .",
    "it is interesting to note that these results did not initiate further numerical studies on induction in the presence of soft iron domains .",
    "a possibility to increase the effective magnetic reynolds number in fluid flow driven dynamo experiments arises from the addition of tiny ferrous particles to the fluid medium leading to an uniform enlargement of the relative permeability @xcite . to retain reasonable fluid properties the amount of particles added to the liquid is limited so that an upper bound for the achievable fluid permeability is given by @xmath9 .",
    "the main effect found in the simulations of @xcite was a reduced decay of the initial field but not a smaller threshold ( essentially because of nonmonotonous behavior of the growth rate in dependence of @xmath10 ) .",
    "another type of ferromagnetic influence on dynamo action is observed in the von - krmn - sodium ( vks ) dynamo . in the vks experiment a turbulent flow of liquid sodium",
    "is driven by two counterotating impellers located at the opposite end caps of a cylindrical domain @xcite .",
    "dynamo action is only obtained when the impellers are made of soft - iron with @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "recently it has been shown in @xcite that these soft - iron impellers essentially determine the geometry and the growth rates of the magnetic field by locally enhancing the magnetic reynolds number and by enforcing internal boundary conditions for the magnetic field at the material interfaces in terms of jump conditions .",
    "furthermore , gradients of the material coefficients @xmath12 and @xmath7 might support dynamo action because corresponding additional terms in the induction equation couple toroidal and poloidal fields which is essential for the occurrence of dynamo action .",
    "an example for this dynamo type has been presented in @xcite where it was shown that even a straight flow over an ( infinite ) conducting plate with sinusoidal variation of the conductivity is able to produce dynamo action .",
    "however , the experimental realization of this setup would require either an unachievable large magnetic reynolds number or a rather large variation in the conductivity ( @xmath13 factor of 100 ) whereas the mean value should not be too far away from the conductivity of the fluid . in order to obtain semi - homogenous dynamo action it might be more promising to replace the conductivity variation by a permeability variation because the relative permeability of soft - iron alloys easily attains values of several thousands .",
    "although such dynamos are of little astrophysical relevance the experiments of lowes and wilkinson and in particular the rich dynamical behavior in the vks dynamo demonstrate the usefulness of such models .",
    "the scope of the present work is to validate the numerical tool necessary to establish a basic understanding of the influence of material properties on the induction process .",
    "emphasis is given to the problem of the free decay in cylindrical geometry where two disks characterized by high conductivity / permeability and their thickness are inserted in the interior of a cylindrical container filled with a conducting fluid .",
    "to demonstrate the reliability of our results we use two different numerical approaches and show that both methods give results in agreement . the study is completed by an application of a mean flow as it occurs in the vks experiment in combination with two high permeability disks",
    "from faraday s law in combination with ohm s law one immediately retrieves the induction equation that determines the temporal behavior of the magnetic flux density @xmath14 ( often abbreviated with magnetic field ) : @xmath15 in eq .",
    "( [ eq::induction ] ) @xmath16 denotes the flow velocity , @xmath7 the electric conductivity , @xmath6 the vacuum permeability and @xmath12 the relative permeability . in case of spatially varying distributions of conductivity and permeability eq .",
    "( [ eq::induction ] ) can be rewritten : @xmath17 the terms on the right - hand - side that involve gradients of @xmath12 and @xmath7 couple the toroidal and poloidal field components which is known to be essential for the existence of a dynamo . the lack of symmetry between the terms containing @xmath12 and @xmath7 indicates a distinct impact of @xmath7 and @xmath12 which is also manifested in the jump conditions for electric field and magnetic field that have to be fulfilled at material interfaces . at interfaces between materials 1 and 2 that exhibit a jump in conductivity @xmath7 and/or in relative permeability @xmath12 the normal component of the magnetic flux density is continuous whereas the tangential components exhibit a jump described by the ratio of the permeabilities . in case of conductivity discontinuities ,",
    "the tangential components of the electric field are continuous and the normal component of the electric current is continuous . if there is no contribution of the flow , the continuity of the normal current leads to the discontinuity of the normal electric field in the ratio of the conductivities .",
    "mathematically these jump conditions are given by ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) : @xmath18 \\displaystyle { \\mbox{\\boldmath$n$}}\\times\\left(\\frac{{\\mbox{\\boldmath$b$}}_1}{\\mu_{{\\rm{r}},1}}-\\frac{{\\mbox{\\boldmath$b$}}_2}{\\mu_{\\rm{r},2}}\\right)&=&0,\\\\[0.6 cm ] { \\mbox{\\boldmath$n$}}\\cdot({\\mbox{\\boldmath$j$}}_1-{\\mbox{\\boldmath$j$}}_2)&=&0,\\\\[0.5 cm ] { \\mbox{\\boldmath$n$}}\\times({\\mbox{\\boldmath$e$}}_1-{\\mbox{\\boldmath$e$}}_2)&=&0 , \\label{eq::jumpconditions } \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 denotes the unit vector in the normal direction on the interface between materials 1 and 2 .",
    "although these transmission conditions are standard , their dynamical consequences in flows at large @xmath10 are largely unknown .",
    "two different numerical algorithms and codes are used for the numerical solution of problems involving the kinematic induction equation ( [ eq::induction ] ) .",
    "a combined finite volume / boundary element method ( fv / bem ) is a grid based approach which provides a flexible scheme that utilizes a local discretization and intrinsically maintains the solenoidal character of the magnetic field .",
    "the second solution method is based on a spectral / finite element approximation technique denoted sfemans for spectral / finite elements for maxwell and navier - stokes equations .",
    "taking advantage of the cylindrical symmetry of the domains , fourier modes are used in the azimuthal direction and finite elements are used in the meridional plane . for each fourier mode",
    "this leads to independent two - dimensional - problems in the meridian plane .",
    "we start with the induction equation in conservative form : @xmath20 where the electric field @xmath21 is given by @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the magnetic diffusivity . for the sake of simplicity we give a short sketch for the treatment of inhomogeneous conductivity and permeability only in cartesian",
    "the scheme can easily be adapted to different ( orthogonal ) coordinate systems ( e.g. cylindrical or spherical coordinate system ) making use of generalized coordinates @xcite .    in the finite volume scheme the grid representation of the magnetic field",
    "is given by a staggered collocation of the field components that are interpreted as an approximation of the ( cell-)face average : @xmath24 where the integration domain @xmath25 corresponds to the surface of a single cell - face : @xmath26\\times[z_{k-\\frac{1}{2}},z_{k+\\frac{1}{2}}]$ ] ( see fig .

    "we only discuss the treatment of the diffusive part of the electric field , @xmath36 because the advective contributions @xmath37 do not involve the material properties and can be treated separately in the framework of an operator splitting scheme ( see e.g. @xcite @xcite , @xcite @xcite , @xcite @xcite ) . to obtain the computation directive for the electric field",
    "the magnetic field has to be integrated along a ( closed path ) around @xmath38 at the edge of a grid cell ( see dotted curve in fig .",

    "applying the averaging rules ( [ eq::eta_average ] ) and ( [ eq::mu_average ] ) for the computation of the `` diffusive '' part of the electric field results in a scheme that intrinsically fulfills the jump conditions  ( [ eq::jumpconditions ] ) at material interfaces .",
    "the scheme is robust and simple to implement , however , the averaging procedure results in a artificial smoothing of parameter jumps at interfaces and in concave corners additional difficulties might occur caused by ambiguous expressions for @xmath12 .",
    "furthermore in the simple realization as presented above , the parameter range is restricted . for larger jumps of @xmath12 or @xmath7 a more careful treatment of the discontinuities at the material interfaces",
    "is necessary which would require a more elaborate field reconstruction that makes use of slope limiters .      in numerical simulations of laboratory dynamo action insulating boundary conditions",

    "this ambiguous denomination may be understood only for convecting flows at small magnetic reynolds number where the induced fields remain small compared to a given field .",
    "in fact , a restriction of the boundary magnetic field to its normal component resembles an artifical but numerically convenient setup where the exterior of the computational domain is characterized by an infinite permeability . in case of vtf boundary conditions the calculation of field growth rates for typical dynamo problems",

    "note that this pseudo - vacuum set - up under - estimates the threshold by more than 30% .",
    "this confirms that a realistic description of the soft iron impellers is crucial to get correct estimates .",
    "the robustness of the solutions suffers from the rather delicate dependence of the field behavior on the details of the flow distribution , in particular from the flow in the lid layers . beside the well known dynamo killing influence of the lid flow @xcite",
    "this is also true for the radial flow in the vicinity of the inner side of the disks .",
    "a couple of simulations have been performed applying a slightly different velocity field where the radial component is smoothed at the transition between the bulk of the domain and the impeller disk ( where @xmath259 ) .",
    "the resulting decay rates ( black stars in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig::mnd_gr ] and tab .  [ tab::m1_mnd ] ) exhibit slight differences in case of @xmath186 and a more moderate enhancement of the @xmath225 - mode for @xmath260 .",

    "although soft iron is strongly connected to magnetostatics , experimental dynamos have shown that this material may also find important applications in the field of magnetohydrodynamics .",
    "for instance , at least one of the two impellers of the cadarache experiment must be made of soft iron in order to achieve dynamo action .",
    "this is an unexplained fact which suggests that one may wonder if the role of this material is only to lower the critical magnetic reynolds number in the domain of experimental feasibility or if the dynamo mechanism is fundamentally different when the conducting medium is no longer homogenous .",
    "this issue may be faced in principle numerically . however , to face such problems with heterogenous domains , specific algorithms must be implemented and validated and this is the aim of the present study since analytical results are lacking .",
    "our comparative runs of ohmic decay problems proved in practice to be extremely useful to optimize both codes and to select some numerical coefficients occurring in the algorithms ( such as in penalty terms ) .",
    "the problems which have been successively presented above are standard in mhd , but we were forced to reduce the dimension of the parameter space to configurations more or less related to the cadarache experiment , where the impellers may be treated as disks in a conducting flow bounded by a cylinder of a given aspect ratio",
    ". we have thus considered axisymmetric domains only ( see @xcite for non - axisymmetric cases ) , and azimuthal modes of low order @xmath261 and @xmath262 .",
    "we have first studied ohmic decay problems , with disk impellers of various thicknesses to investigate scaling laws and the impact of the spatial resolution .",
    "internal assemblies of high permeability material within the fluid container are different from the problem of an enhanced , but homogenous fluid permeability because of inner boundary conditions for the magnetic field ( in case of high permeability material ) , respectively for the electric field / current ( in case of conductivity jumps ) . in the free decay problem with thin high permeability disks a selective enhancement of the axisymmetric toroidal field and the @xmath225 mode",
    "is observed whereas the axisymmetric poloidal field component is preferred in case of high conductive disks .",
    "we have also shown that pseudo - vacuum boundary conditions , which are easier to implement on the cylinder walls than the jump conditions on the impellers , have only a slight influence on the decay rates .",
    "the impact of the outer container boundaries on the field behavior is limited to a shift of the decay / growth rates .",
    "this is surprising , insofar as pseudo vacuum boundary conditions resemble the conditions that correspond to an external material with infinite permeability . nevertheless , the presence of high permeability / conductivity disks within the liquid occlude the influence of outer boundary conditions , and the simplifying approach applying vanishing tangential field conditions at the end caps of the cylinder in order to mimic the effects of the high permeability disks in the vks experiment is not sufficient to describe the correct field behavior .",
    "the consideration of lid layers and disks with ( large but finite ) permeability remains indispensable in order to obtain the influence of the material properties on growth rates as well as on the field geometry .    for completeness",
    ", we have also considered conductivity domains . from the experimental point of view the utilization of disks with a conductivity that is 100 times larger than the conductivity of liquid sodium remains purely academic .",
    "nevertheless , the simulations show a crucial difference between heterogeneous permeabilities and conductivities : even if these two quantities may appear in the definition of an effective reynolds number @xmath263 , they do not play the same role and they select different geometries of the dominant decaying mode .",
    "it is not only a change of magnetic diffusivity that matters .",
    "we considered then kinematic dynamo action , using analytically defined flows in accordance with the setting of the vks mean flow .",
    "since these flows are axisymmetric , the azimuthal modes are decoupled .",
    "the most important is the ( @xmath196 ) mode which will be excited eventually through dynamo action .",
    "we have shown that our codes give comparable growth rates for this mode .",
    "we have examined also the growth rate of the ( @xmath192 ) magnetic field in presence of soft iron impellers and the axisymmetric mnd flow . since convergence of results is not achieved in all the cases considered , this comparative study is still in progress and it has thus not been included in the present paper .",
    "we recall that the main surprise of the cadarache experiment was perhaps the occurrence of the mode ( @xmath192 ) , which pointed out the possible role of the non - axisymmetric flow fluctuations .",
    "non - axisymmetric velocity contributions might be considered in terms of an @xmath157-effect as it has been proposed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "preliminary examinations applying simple @xmath157-distributions are presented in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , there is still a lack of knowledge on the details and physical justification on a precise @xmath157-distribution which requires a non - linear hydrodynamic code .",
    "the questions related to this empirical fact represent a main issue of the experimental and numerical approaches of the fluid dynamo problem and deserve a dedicated study .",
    "so far our model is not capable to explain the main features of the vks experiment , which are the dominating axisymmetric field mode and the surprising low critical magnetic reynolds number of @xmath264 .",
    "however , our results give a hint why the @xmath225 mode remains absent in the experiment .",
    "dynamo action may occur when coupling terms between the magnetic field components are present and antidynamo theorems are derived when such terms are lacking : this is in particular the case for the ( @xmath192 ) mode with an axisymmetric flow ( cowling s theorem ) .",
    "conversely , a source term on this mode appears when the flow axisymmetry is broken .",
    "although the relative amplitude of this source can not be discussed here , we note that the decay time of the @xmath232 toroidal mode become the smallest when the effective permeability is high enough ( see for example fig .",
    "[ fig::decay_rates_vac ] ) .",
    "it may thus appears as the dominant mode of the dynamo , as it seems to be observed in the vks experiment .",
    "otherwise stated , the impact of soft - iron impellers on the critical magnetic reynolds number of the ( @xmath196)-mode could be rather low ( decrease from @xmath265 to @xmath266 in the mnd case ) and could remain unobservable , while it could be strong for the ( @xmath192 ) mode ( down to 32 in the vks geometry ) when conjugated to a slight departure from flow axisymmetry .",
