    "chaos synchronization is a fundamental phenomenon in dynamical systems ( pecora & carroll 1990 , pikovsky _ et al . _ 2002 ) .",

    "chaos synchronization is commonly found in unidirectionally coupled systems , where a distinction can be made between a drive or forcing subsystem and another driven or response subsystem that possesses chaotic dynamics ( pikovsky _ et al .",
    "complete synchronization occurs when the state variables of the drive and the response subsystems converge to a single orbit in phase space .",
    "more generally , generalized synchronization of chaos arises when a functional relation different from the identity is established between the drive and the response subsystems ( rulkov et al 1995 , abarbanel _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 , kapitaniak _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 , hunt _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 , parlitz & kokarev 1999 , zhou & roy 2007 ) .    the auxiliary system approach ( abarbanel _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) shows that when a response and a replica subsystems are driven by the same signal , then the orbits in the phase spaces of the response and replica subsystems become identical and they can evolve on identical attractors , if their initial conditions lie on the same basin of attraction of the driven - response system . by extension , an ensemble of identical chaotic oscillators can also be synchronized by a common drive . in this case",
    ", generalized synchronization implies that the elements in the ensemble become synchronized into a single trajectory that evolves differently from that of the drive .",
    "the specific functional form of the drive is not determinantal ; the basic mechanism that leads to synchronization is the sharing of the same input by the oscillators for all times .    on the other hand ,",
    "there has been interest in the investigation of chaotic synchronization and other forms of collective behaviors emerging in autonomous systems consisting of networks of mutually interacting nonlinear units without the presence of external influences ( newman _ et al .",
    "_ 2006 , manrubia _ et al .",
    "synchronization in globally coupled oscillators is relevant in many chemical and biological systems and have been experimentally investigated ( wang _ et al .",
    "_ 2000 , s. de monte _ et al . _",
    "( 2007 ) , taylor _ et al .",
    "_ 2009 ) . in autonomous systems where",
    "the units are coupled through their mean field , the units and the mean field can synchronize to a common chaotic trajectory ( kaneko 1989 ) .",
    "this process can be regarded as the analogous of complete synchronization in driven systems of elements subject to a common drive .",
    "recently , the concept of generalized synchronization of chaos occurring in driven systems has been applied to the context of autonomous systems ( alvarez - llamoza & cosenza 2008 ) .",
    "this means that , under some circumstances , the chaotic state variables in an autonomous dynamical system can be synchronized to each other but not to a shared coupling function containing information from those variables .",
    "the occurrence of both forms of chaos synchronization in driven and in autonomous systems suggests that the nature of the common influence acting on the elements in a system is irrelevant ; it could consist of an external forcing , or an autonomous interaction function ( alvarez - llamoza & cosenza 2008 ) .",
    "at the local level , each element in the system is subject to a field , either external or endogenous , that eventually induces some form of synchronization between that field and the element .",
    "thus , the local dynamics can be seen as a single element subject to a drive evolving as the common field in each case .    in this paper",
    "we present a simple and unified scheme for the study of chaos synchronization in classes of driven and in autonomous dynamical systems .",
    "our method is based on the reported analogy between a single driven map and a system of globally coupled maps ( parravano & cosenza 1998 ) .",
    "this analogy provided an explanation of dynamical clustering in globally coupled systems ( parravano & cosenza 1998 , manrubia _ et al .",
    "_ 2004 ) and of stability of steady states in systems with delayed interactions ( masoller & marti 2005 ) .",
    "we show that the synchronization behavior of a system of chaotic maps subject to either an external forcing or a coupling function of their internal variables can be inferred from the behavior of a single driven map in the system .",
    "when this single drive - response system reaches either complete or generalized synchronization , the local analogy implies that an ensemble of identical maps subject to a common ( external or internal ) field that behaves as this drive , should also synchronize in a similar fashion .",
    "we show that the conditions for stable synchronization in a single driven map also describe the regions where synchronized states occur in both driven and autonomous extended systems .    by studying a single driven - map model with minimal ingredients ,",
    "we find minimal conditions for the emergence of chaos synchronization in both driven and autonomous associated systems .",
    "our results show that the presence of a common drive or a coupling function for all times is not indispensable for reaching synchronization in an extended system of chaotic oscillators , nor is the simultaneous sharing of the drive or the coupling function by all the elements in the system . in the case of an autonomous system",
    ", the coupling function does not need to depend on all the internal variables for achieving synchronization and , in particular , its functional form is not crucial for generalized synchronization .",
    "what seems essential for reaching synchronization in a system is the sharing of some minimal information by the elements , on the average , over long times , independently of its source .    in sec .",
