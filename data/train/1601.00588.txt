    "the so - called @xmath0 theories @xcite are a generalization of teleparallel gravity ( tegr ) @xcite ; the latter is a theory of gravity based on a riemann - cartan space - time , endowed with the non symmetric weitzenbck connection which , unlike the levi - civita connection of gr , gives rise to torsion but is curvature - free . in tegr torsion plays the role of curvature , while the tetrad , instead of the metric , plays the role of the dynamical field ; the field equations are obtained from a lagrangian containing the torsion scalar @xmath7 .",
    "actually , even if tegr has a different geometric structure with respect to general relativity ( gr ) , the two theories have the same dynamics : in other words every solution of gr is also solution of tegr . in the @xmath0 theories the lagrangian is an analytic function of the torsion scalar @xmath7 : these theories generalize tegr and are not equivalent to gr @xcite .",

    "the additional degrees of freedom of @xmath0 gravity are related to the fact that the equations of motion are not invariant under local lorentz transformations @xcite : for this reason it is important to suitably choose a tetrad that does not constrain a priori the functional form of the lagrangian @xcite . in recent papers @xcite the problem of the violation of local lorentz invariance has been analyzed with emphasis on the role of the spin connection , and it has been showed that it is possible to obtain a fully covariant reformulation of @xmath0 gravity",

    "then , we use these results to evaluate the possibility of constraining the theory parameter @xmath2 .    this work is organized as follows : in section [ sec : ft - gravity ] we briefly review the foundations of @xmath0 theories , in order to obtain the rr space - time ; then , in section [ sec : lensing ] , we study light propagation and , in section [ sec : disc ] , we evaluate the impact on the observations .",

    "the upper bound in eq . ( [ eq : boundalpha ] ) is looser than the one already available , deriving from the analysis of solar system dynamics .",
    "however , since the @xmath2 contribution to the bending angle only depends on the impact parameter , tighter constraints could be obtained with objects smaller than the sun : for instance , the contribution from jupiter would give ( with the same astrometric accuracy ) a bound smaller of two orders of magnitude .",
    "perhaps , this could be of some interest for the ongoing gaia mission @xcite .",

    "furthermore , according to the discussion above , the order of magnitude of the correction to the image position is @xmath105 : it is evident that this correction decreases with the mass of the lens and it is not effective for supermassive objects .",
    "similarly , we can estimate the first order correction to the differential time delay ( [ eq : tau1 ] ) .",
    "it turns out to be @xmath106 : again , we see that this correction decreases with the mass of the lens ( @xmath67 depends on the mass of the lens ) .    in summary , lensing observables in the case of supermassive objects",
    "would give poor constraints on the theory parameter @xmath2 .",
    "in the framework of @xmath0 gravity , we have focused on a spherically symmetric solution for the lagrangian @xmath1 , that can be considered as the first approximation of a power series expression of an arbitrary lagrangian .",
    "the @xmath2 parameter measures the deviation from general relativity or , which is the same , from teleparallel gravity . in previous works",
    ", this parameter has been constrained analyzing solar system dynamics ; here , by exploiting a general formalism that applies to spherically symmetric space - times , we have studied the deflection of light .",
    "we have obtained the correction to the gr bending angle and , moreover , using the lensing formalism , we have derived the modifications of the images position , the time delay , and the magnification .",
    "these corrections are negligibly small for supermassive objects : this is ultimately related to the fact that the modification to the bending angle does not depend on the mass of the lens .",
    "however , the sign of @xmath2 influences the magnification : images with different parity undergo opposite effects ; in principle , this could constrain the sign of @xmath2 .",
    "eventually , we have showed that the study of light deflection with the vlba accuracy could provide constraints on @xmath2 that are looser than those already available . indeed ,",
    "since the effect only depends on the impact parameter , we have suggested that the study of gravitational bending from planetary objects could give better constraints : perhaps this could be of some relevance for the astrometric missions , such as gaia .    as a final remark , we remember that @xmath0 theories generalize tegr just as @xmath107 theories do for gr : indeed , in @xmath107 gravity ( which is based on the levi - civita connection of gr ) the gravitational lagrangian depends on a function @xmath19 of the curvature scalar @xmath108 ( see @xcite and references therein ) : when @xmath109 the action reduces to the usual einstein - hilbert action , and einstein s theory is obtained . both theories , as discussed in the above references , have been considered to explain observations at large cosmological scales , so it is in general expected that their impact at the solar system scale is very small , as we have discussed in this work .",
    "we have investigated lensing in @xmath107 gravity elsewhere @xcite , and we have showed that the non linearity of the lagrangian could be relevant for distant galaxies or clusters of galaxies acting as lenses . however , in order to make a possible comparison between @xmath0 and @xmath107 gravity on the basis of lensing observables , it is necessary to generalize the simple point - like lens model that we have used in this paper .",

    "<S> in the framework of @xmath0 gravity , we focus on a weak - field and spherically symmetric solution for the lagrangian @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is a small constant which parameterizes the departure from general relativity . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we study the propagation of light and obtain the correction to the general relativistic bending angle . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we discuss the impact of this correction on some gravitational lensing observables , and evaluate the possibility of constraining the theory parameter @xmath2 by means of observations . in particular , on taking into account the astrometric accuracy in the solar system </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain that @xmath3 ; this bound is looser than those deriving from the analysis of solar system dynamics , e.g. @xmath4 @xcite , @xmath5 @xcite or @xmath6 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however we suggest that , since the effect only depends on the impact parameter , better constraints could be obtained by studying light bending from planetary objects . </S>"
