    "it has been established by now that a large body of astrophysical objects hosting supermassive black holes ( e.g. , quasars , galactic black hole candidates or microquasars ) exhibit collimated , powerful jets / winds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for review ) .",
    "in particular , strong outflows generally occur in the radio - loud active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "it is now widely accepted that the outflows observed from a large class of objects as jets or winds have their origin in accretion flows , which at the same time power the radiation emission associated with these objects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "many astrophysical systems apparently manage to transfer the energy from inflowing accretion flows to outflowing jets / winds of a small population of nonthermal particles .",
    "for instance , @xcite in radio observations of the nearby active galaxy m87 found a remarkably broad jet with strong collimation occurring already at @xmath3 radii from a central engine .",
    "recently , @xcite discussed the disk - jet connection of the radio galaxy 3c  120 observed with _",
    "suzaku_. such a population of relativistic outflowing particles is thought to produce a subsequent synchrotron emission that is observed in several sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this issue clearly points to the importance of investigating a fundamental connection between the accreting flows and outflows in regions not too far from the central engines  presumably within @xmath4 radii . because the emission of radiation requires the dissipation of the kinetic energy of the accretion flow ,",
    "it is not unreasonable to suggest that the two phenomena , i.e. the dissipation / emission of radiation and the presence of outflows , are related to the same generic process , which manifests itself with different guises at the diverse sites that these phenomena are observed .    given that an accretion flow may very well become turbulent or , at a very minimum hot due to adiabatic compression , it is not surprising to anticipate such a flow to emit radiation , with luminosity and spectrum depending strongly on the specific character of the accretion process ( e.g. quasi - spherical or disk ) .",
    "however , the ubiquitous presence of outflows in the same objects presents a different problem altogether : an outflow requires that a fraction of the accreted matter be endowed with velocity higher than the escape velocity associated with the specific radius at which the outflow is launched .",
    "given that the only free energy available to the accreting gas is that of the gravitational field , hydrodynamic dissipation of the accretion kinetic energy can never produce an outflow since this process simply converts the kinetic energy of a gravitationally bound flow into thermal , with the energy per unit mass ( thermal plus kinetic ) never higher than that of the local gravitational potential .",
    "the launch of an outflow such as those observed requires the presence of an  engine \" , i.e. a mechanism that expends mechanical work ( i.e. low entropy energy ) to transfer a fraction of the available energy to an even smaller fraction of the available mass , thereby imparting to it specific energy greater than the local gravitational potential ; it is then expected that in its further evolution the excess energy will be converted into directed motion and the fraction of the mass will escape to infinity in a collimated ( jet ) or uncollimated ( wind ) outflow .",
    "the well known models of outflows , usually involving the action of magnetic fields such as the magnetocentrigual jet models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , are specific examples as to what may constitute such an engine .",
    "these models assume the presence of a thin keplerian disk  threaded \" by a poloidal magnetic field ; the keplerian rotation of the magnetic field line footpoints and the magnetic tension transfer energy and angular momentum to the disk plasma which can escape to infinity .",
    "these models are consistent in that they solve simultaneously for the poloidal field geometry and the flow velocity ( under certain simplifying assumptions , i.e. the self - similarity of the solutions ) .",
    "@xcite further developed the general theory of non - self - similar solutions of hydromagnetic disk winds . in these models the transfer of excess energy to the escaping particles is made at the expense of the rotational energy of the matter in the disk and it is mediated by the magnetic field .",
    "while this type of model gained popularity , the issue of jet / outlfow formation took a different turn with the introduction of advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these radiatively inefficient accretion flows ( riaf ) were found to have positive bernoulli integral of the flow and could therefore fulfill the condition necessary for the launching of jet / wind outflows ; as such they present potentially interesting sites for the origin of such outflows .",
    "the positivity of the bernoulli integral has been discussed and analysed by @xcite who pointed out that it is due to the combination of energy transfer by the viscous torques from the inner to the outer sections of the flow ( the gas of the flow becomes bounded at its inner edge ) and the local dissipation of the flow s azimuthal kinetic energy which is not radiated away but stored in the fluid to increase its internal energy .",
    "the latter authors then argued that the excess energy can be carried away to infinity ( along with some fraction of the accreting mass and angular momentum ) to produce continuous outflows from all radii to infinity while leaving the remaining flow with negative bernoulli constant to naturally accrete onto the compact object : advection - dominated inflow - outflow solution ( adios ) . in this case , while the necessary excess energy is transferred by the viscous torques from the flow s more highly bound inner section , the necessary separation of mass to components with positive and negative total energy is still left unspecified .",
    "an altogether different model that offers a simplified picture of such a separation was presented by @xcite who proposed that in the tenuous , collisionless plasma of an adaf particles ( protons ) could be accelerated via a second - order fermi acceleration by the shear motions of the underlying quasi - keplerian azimuthal flow .",
    "they then argued that if sufficiently large pressure is built in the accelerated particle proton population ( the electrons generally lose energy on time scales short compared to their transit time through the system and can not build an energy density that could be dynamically important ) and for favorable geometries of the disk magnetic field ( large scale poloidal loops that open up above the disk ) the relativistic particle population could naturally ( through the action of the gravitational field ) segregate itself from the non - relativistic one , carrying off to infinity only the accelerated ( @xmath5 ) portion of the disk plasma . in this case",
    "the engine is a combination of the particle acceleration and the action of the gravitational field .",
    "finally , a model along the same lines was proposed by @xcite who suggested that even in the case of a completely turbulent magnetic field , a separation of the relativistic and non - relativistic particle populations is possible through the production of relativistic neutrons in the collisions of the relativistic protons with the ambient plasma and the ensuing production of relativistic neutrons .",
    "the subsequent decay of neutrons back into protons produces then a proton fluid in regions of space devoid of inertia whose energy - to - mass ratio ( and hence its asymptotic lorentz factor ) depends only on the ratio @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the size of the system and @xmath8 the neutron life time and can lead to highly relativistic flows for black hole masses @xmath9 .    in the present note",
    "we follow a similar simplified view to study outflows in objects powered by accretion : we consider the presence of ( 2-dimensional ) shocks as a means of dissipation of the accretion kinetic energy in a fashion similar to that considered by @xcite and collaborators .",
    "that is we consider the transonic accretion of matter with the proper angular momentum to produce a standing shock at a radius close to the horizon , which , subsequently accretes onto the black hole after passing through a downstream sonic point .",
    "previous steady - state analysis found that it is possible to judiciously choose the specific angular momentum of the flow , so that the outer transonic one could be connected through a shock transition to an inner transonic one which , passing through an inner sonic point , accretes onto the black hole . the location of the shock in this situation is determined by finding a radial position at which the density and velocity of the two flow sections were those demanded by the dissipative rankine - hugoniot conditions across a shock .",
    "so far , the formation of standing shocks in hydrodynamic accretion has been extensively studied by a number of authors for both inviscid flows ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and viscous flows ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , considering either dissipative or non - dissipative shock jump conditions .",
    "recently , standing shocks in the presence of poloidal magnetic fields [ i.e. , magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) shocks ] around a black hole was also studied for various parameter dependence ( see das & chakrabarti 2007 for pseudo - newtonian geometry ; takahashi et al . 2002 , fukumura et al .",
    "2007 for kerr geometry ) . in the context of the particle acceleration via the first - order fermi mechanism across a shock front",
    ", the production of shock - accelerated relativistic protons were discussed in spherical accretion @xcite , while other authors have explored the relativistic outflows in adaf with shocks @xcite .",
    "similar attempts have been made to make physical connections between the shocked - accretion and outflows .",
    "for instance , mass outflow rate were estimated from adiabatic shocked - flow region in newtonian gravity ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "@xcite took a similar approach to study the shock - generated outflows with little energy dissipation in pseudo - newtonian geometry . independently , from general relativistic mhd simulations , the formation of jets ( magnetically - driven and gas - pressure driven jets ) is found in the high pressure regions due to the shock / adiabatic compression ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "they concluded that the jets are mainly produced by the gas - pressure gradient which is greatly enhanced by the shock front at around @xmath10 gravitational radii ( note that this feature was not seen in the newtonian calculations ) .",
    "these studies also suggest an essential connection between the shocked accretion flows and the jets ; i.e. , the shock front may serve as a base of the outflows .",
    "the novelty of our approach lies in considering the possibility of shock formation ( i.e. obeying the general relativistic , dissipative rankine - hugoniot conditions at a shock front ) in which part of the mass , angular momentum and energy fluxes escape in the z - direction and do not participate in the shock transition .",
    "we then examine the energy per unit mass of the escaping matter which we compare to the escape velocity at the shock radius ; if it is greater than the latter we conclude that this scenario can produce an outflow with its outflow rate @xmath11 and luminosity that are calculable and can be compared to those of the entire accretion to obtain a measure of the efficiency of our  engine \" in producing outflows .",
    "some population of energetic nonthermal particles , produced via a shock acceleration , may then be well separated from the equatorial accretion flows ( which consists primarily of thermal particles ) .",
    "more specifically , since we are interested in the formation of outflows through shocks in the inner disk region relatively close to a presumably rotating black hole at a center ( say , @xmath12 gravitational radii ) , it is important to include the strong gravity and frame - dragging effects described by general relativity . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "no relevant work in the literature incorporates such mass and energy loss in the shock jump conditions . in the framework of our model presented here ,",
    "mass loss is coupled to energy loss via the shock jump conditions , and therefore it must be considered simultaneously .",
    "it is this point that motivates us to explore , for the first time , the formation of outflowing particles as a consequence of the formation of dissipative standing shocks in accretion in a fully relativistic treatment .",
    "the formalism of our current model is partly based on the previous works @xcite .",
    "our main objective in this study is therefore to explore in details a possibility that the formation of outflows ( jets / winds ) can occur at a dissipative shock front in transonic accreting flows : i.e. , a connection between shocked - accreting gas and the outflowing particles .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in ",
    "2 we review and explain our simplified model that simultaneously considers both shocks and outflows with appropriate jump conditions .",
    "main parameter dependence of the shock - outflow solutions is explored in  3 , where we show the nature of the shock - outflow solutions and the corresponding global accretion solutions .",
    "our primary goal in these analysis is to examine the coupling between the shock - outflow solutions . in  4 we discuss our results and make some observation implications .",
    "brief summary and concluding remarks are given there as well .",
    "in black hole accretion , accreting gas must be transonic . after passing through a first sonic radius ,",
    "the gas is slowed down , and a shock may develop . for causality , the shocked gas must become supersonic again before crossing the event horizon .",
    "below , we will explain the details of our simplified model .",

    "the self - gravity of the flow is ignored , and we do not include the effects of magnetic fields for simplicity .",

    "therefore , the results above suggest that more energetic outflowing particles may be separated from a shock front when the upstream flow possesses smaller angular momentum regardless of black hole spin @xmath18 .",
    "mass loss fraction @xmath114 can become as high as @xmath122 for both @xmath112 and @xmath119 cases regardless of energy @xmath118 , whereas energy loss fraction is only @xmath123 for @xmath112 case but @xmath124 for @xmath119 case . by direct comparison of these figures",
    ", we note that rotation of a black hole @xmath18 is also effective such that @xmath125 , i.e. an increase in mass loss would allow more energy loss for @xmath119 case . therefore",
    ", more energetic outflows can be expected from a shock around a rotating black hole .",
    "the upstream flow energy @xmath118 also affects the mass loss fraction .",
    "it is noted that the energy - dependence of @xmath114 is strong ; higher energy @xmath118 can lead to larger mass outflow fraction for a given angular momentum @xmath48 and a shock location @xmath104 .",
    "for instance , with @xmath126 for @xmath112 case ( in fig .",

    "angular momentum @xmath48 is fixed in each case to see energy - dependence alone ( although different values of @xmath48 for different spin @xmath18 must be chosen to obtain the solutions ) .",
    "we find that our dissipative shocks ( coupled to mass loss ) become stronger with decreasing energy , a behavior similar to the typical types of shock formation ( e.g. , see lu et al .",
    "1997 for adiabatic shocks ; lu & yuan 1998 , fukumura & tsuruta 2004 for isothermal shocks ) .    to exclusively illustrate the black hole spin dependence @xmath18 of the mass loss efficiency @xmath114 we fix all other parameters ( @xmath138 ) except for @xmath18 .",
    "figure  [ fig : spin ] shows @xmath114 against @xmath18 and @xmath121 for @xmath139 and @xmath140 . as seen in the earlier results , black hole rotation alone can clearly enhance the efficiency of mass outflows @xmath114 from @xmath141 ( for @xmath112 ) up to @xmath142 ( for @xmath143 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the corresponding energy loss efficiency @xmath121 remains as low as @xmath144 .",
    "note here that @xmath48 would have to be properly adjusted in order to obtain the solutions for higher black hole spin @xmath18 .",
    "we have chosen above some representative values for the flow energy for parametric purpose .",
    "weakly viscous / inviscid accretion in general is a good model for some limited specific cases , like our galactic center , for example . for such specific cases ,",
    "the realistic choice of energy should be very small .",
    "from this perspective we examine to see whether low energy flows can still produce shock - driven outflows .",

    "we set @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",
    "mass outflows can indeed be produced with @xmath114 ranging from @xmath147 up to @xmath148 .",
    "both unstable and stable shocks are present as in the earlier cases but not continuously connected ( no shock regions between the two ) .",
    "the range of shock location is much narrower in radius in this case , over which the mass loss efficiency can significantly change as mentioned above .",
    "we will discuss this more in the discussion section .",
    "the major correlations we find among the primary parameters are summarized in table  [ tab : tbl-1 ] .",
    "table  [ tab : tbl-2 ] shows various correlations with shock strength .",
    "compression ratio @xmath97 is strongly correlated with ( @xmath149 ) ; stronger shocks are expected in regions very close to the central engine particularly around a rotating black hole .",

    "the rotation of the black hole apparently amplifies the shock strength by more than a factor of two , also extending the outflowing site significantly inward ( i.e. , @xmath117 when @xmath119 while @xmath154 when @xmath112 ) .",
    "we will make some implications of the obtained shock - outflow solutions in the last section ,  4 .",
    "samples of the global run of the physical parameters of accretion flows that include shocks are given in figures  [ fig : global-1 ] ( @xmath112 ) and [ fig : global-2 ] ( @xmath119 ) . in tables",

    "vertical lines denote the positions of shocks connecting the upstream and downstream values of the corresponding quantities of each flow .",
    "dotted curve in panel ( b ) shows the keplerian angular velocity @xmath163 .",
    "note that for clarity purposes we only show three of the representative shock solutions obtained , although the shock can occur at any radius between the outermost and innermost solutions ( with different values of @xmath114 and @xmath121 ) .",
    "we find that in both the non - rotating ( fig .",
    "[ fig : global-1 ] ) and rotating ( fig .",
    "[ fig : global-2 ] ) cases the upstream flow density scales as @xmath164 , as in the adaf self - similar solution .",
    "on the other hand , as we explain below , the downstream flow density generally has a slightly steeper power - law slope , @xmath165 unless the shock location is too close to the horizon . as seen in figures  [ fig : global-1]a and [ fig : global-2]a , this is primarily because of the decreasing ( radial ) downstream flow speed @xmath166 , whose feature is more obvious around a rotating black hole .",
    "after the shock transition , frame - dragging of the rotating black hole forces the accreting flow to accelerate more in the toroidal direction ( i.e. , corotate ) rather than radial direction . under adiabatic assumption , at the same time , the flow temperature continues to rise ( fig .",
    "[ fig : global-1]d and [ fig : global-2]d ) due to @xmath167 compression of the flow . since @xmath168",
    ", sound speed also increases .",
    "the resulting ( thermal ) pressure gradient ( @xmath169 ) prevents the incoming flow from speeding up and in fact decelerate the downstream flow ( for a while ) until the flow falls deep inside the gravitational potential well to radially speed up again .",
    "consequently , the fluid motion is governed mainly by increasing toroidal velocity rather than radial one ( compare fig .  [",
    "fig : global-1]a with fig .",
    "[ fig : global-2]a ) .",
    "this results in a larger radial velocity gradient @xmath170 in figure  [ fig : global-2]a .    in differentially - rotating flows , the keplerian frequency increases with decreasing @xmath20 even more rapidly than the sound speed , leading to a decreasing scale - height @xmath61 [ see equation  ( [ eq : h ] ) ] .",
    "the dependence of these two quantities , @xmath171 and @xmath52 , on the radius in the downstream flow could lead to geometrically slim / thick all the way to the horizon [ see , e.g. , @xmath172 in figs .",
    "[ fig : global-1]f and [ fig : global-2]f ] .",
    "recalling @xmath173 from equation  ( [ eq : mdot1 ] ) , the above fact that both @xmath174 and @xmath61 decrease allows a very steep downstream density profile @xmath175 after the shock transition ( and this is more so in a rotating black hole case because of larger drop in @xmath174 as mentioned earlier ) .",

    "in this work we have examined the structure of accretion flows that includes shocks of more general character than those discussed so far in the literature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in particular we have examined whether it is possible to have flows with shocks at which part of the mass and/or energy fluxes are lost and do not participate in the shock transition ( this maybe the case in multidimensional shocks or in shocks that involve acceleration of particles that escape from the shock region ) .",
    "such generalized shocks obey jump conditions more general than those of rankine - hugoniot and it is not _ a priori _",
    "certain if accretion flows can allow for such shocks .",
    "we have also examined the degree of mass and energy loss allowed that are at the same time consistent with the continuation of the downstream flow through another sonic transition onto the black hole . in this respect",
    "we have focused our study on shocks in which the energy per particle for those escaping the shock transition is greater than that of the local gravitational potential . in such a case",
    "one can argue that these particles can escape to infinity producing the jets / winds observed in many accretion - powered systems .",
    "we have found that there are indeed flows with global parameters ( i.e. @xmath48 and @xmath33 ) that allow for such shocks . on the other hand ,",
    "we have also obtained solutions at which the energy per particle of the escaping matter is smaller than the local gravitational potential , indicating that in all likelihood these particles will stagnate and eventually join the rest of the flow onto the compact object .",
    "however , a deeper understanding of the precise mechanisms that can lead to the particles that do not participate in the shock transition , as we conjectured above , requires the knowledge of the detailed microphysics of the shock ( i.e. the acceleration efficiency , the fraction of energy put into relativistic particles at the shock and their transport in and around the shock geometry ) ; these are beyond the scope of the present paper .    to get a crude estimate of the energetics of these outflowing particles",
    ", we compute a threshold energy of the escaping particles under a set of assumed parameters . the total energy flux carried by the escaping particles ( of energy @xmath77 )",
    "is given by @xmath201 [ erg  s@xmath202 where @xmath203 and @xmath204 are evaluated at the shock location ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "the minimum kinetic energy necessary for the separated particles ( of mass outflow rate @xmath79 ) to escape the bulk flow is given by @xmath205 [ erg  s@xmath202 where @xmath206 , to be determined below , is the required critical velocity of the particles . by equating these ,",
    "we solve for @xmath206 to obtain @xmath207 for the outflowing particles to be effectively decoupled from the bulk flow , kinetic energy associated with this critical velocity should exceed or be at least comparable to the corresponding gravitational binding energy at the shock location .",
    "this condition reads @xmath208 or @xmath209 where @xmath210 . since all these parameters ( @xmath211 )",
    "are functions of shock location @xmath104 which depends on @xmath114 , @xmath212 is obtained once we specify @xmath114 .",
    "now , we can review the shock solutions obtained earlier from this new perspective : in figures  [ fig : rsh - a0]-[fig : e - a099 ] the allowed shock solutions satisfying @xmath213 , which is relevant for outflows that may escape the shocked flow , are displayed by shaded regions , while the rest of the solutions correspond to the outflows presumably bound to the bulk flow . according to these estimates , an outflow that expels a certain amount of the preshock accreting matter is possible , over a rather broad range of radii in the vicinity of the central object ; up to nearly 10% of matter may participate in producing seed particles for jets / winds within @xmath214 gravitational radii around a non - rotating black hole , while as much as 50% of preshock matter could contribute to forming jets / winds within @xmath215 gravitational radii around a rapidly - rotating black hole . more interestingly , our solutions also allow for dissipative shocks ( @xmath216 ) with negligible mass loss ( @xmath217 ) . such solutions that involve the loss of infinitesimal mass and finite amount of energy can lead to relativistic outflows from the corresponding shocks .",
    "perhaps , outflows via this type of shocks may produce kinematically strong jets ( with high lorentz factor ) rather than moderate velocity winds .",
    "thus , shock - driven outflows may provide clues on the origin of the jets / winds from the inner accretion regions , for instance , in some active galaxies , e.g. , m87 and 3c120 .",
    "in this simple model , shocks in principle could drive axisymmetric outflowing matter . near the base of the outflow ,",
    "as illustrated in figure  [ fig : schematic ] , its shape would be that of a hollow cone .",
    "however , as it propagates to longer distances we do not expect that this shape would be preserved all the way . within the framework of our current scenario",
    "it can be speculated that the most of the outflows discussed here could be in a diffuse form , while some strong outflows with low @xmath114 and high @xmath121 might possess a relatively more collimated geometry ( perhaps in the poloidal direction ) due to its high lorentz factor . in the presence of large - scale magnetic fields",
    "the dissipated plasma would stream along the field lines , producing collimated outflows .",
    "however , it is beyond the scope of our model to further discuss the exact geometry of the outflows .",
    "it should be noted that for a given @xmath48 there exists the degeneracy of shock - outflow solutions : i.e. , for a single value of angular momentum @xmath48 there is a finite range of possible shock locations allowed ( @xmath218 ) that corresponds respectively to outflows with @xmath219 where the indices  min \" and  max \" denote minimum and maximum values , respectively . in the context of our model , one can predict the shock location @xmath104 by the ( observational ) knowledge of @xmath220 , although the obtained parameter space can be altered by additional physical ingredients ( e.g. , viscosity , magnetic fields , for instance ) .",
    "another issue to be addressed is the fact that in general critical points are not necessarily equivalent to sonic points depending on the flow geometry and equation of state used ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "that is , there could be a potential danger that a false shock could occur in subsonic region between a critical radius and an actual sonic radius , in which case the obtained shock would be unphysical . to ensure that a physically valid shock forms in supersonic regions , we have checked the validity of our shock solutions by computing a three - velocity component of the flow measured by a suitable local observer at the shock location .",
    "we calculated the ( radial ) flow velocity @xmath221 measured by a locally stationary observer in the corotating reference frame ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath222 and compared this velocity to the local sound velocity @xmath52 given by equation  ( [ eq : sound ] ) .",
    "all the shock solutions presented here are found to form in supersonic regions ( i.e. , @xmath223 at @xmath81 ) .",
    "we showed that low energy flows can still produce mass outflows with suitable angular momenta .",
    "although continuous accreting solutions ( i.e. shock - free solutions ) are persistently present even for smaller energy @xmath118 ( as expected ) , we do not find shocked flow solutions ( or perhaps they are present but in much narrower parameter space ) .",
    "it can be speculated that maybe by prohibiting our jump condition in energy ( energy dissipation at a shock front ) we may obtain shock - driven outflows for smaller flow energy @xmath118 , which could be a case similar to @xcite where they considered little energy loss and found mass outflows in pseudo - newtonian geometry .",
    "however , powerful outflows should carry away a significant amount of ( kinetic ) energy .",
    "hence , outflow solutions should in principle be coupled to energy dissipation as treated here .",
    "we have explored a coupling between shock solutions in accretion and mass / energy losses ( fractions ) under a scenario that the shock - driven outflowing particles may participate in forming a base of jets / winds . for various flow parameters with a given black hole spin ,",
    "we have shown , by steady - state , axisymmetric hydrodynamic calculations , that the dissipative shock front could be a plausible site where a fraction of the accreting matter can be decoupled as jets / winds from the bulk accretion flows .",
