    "arrays of magnetic nanowires have attracted considerable interest due to their promising technological applications @xcite mainly in high - density information storage .",
    "electrodeposition in polycarbonate and alumina membranes is the preferred technique used in the fabrication of these systems @xcite , leading to the production of highly ordered arrays of magnetic nanowires inside the pores of membranes @xcite .",
    "different groups have investigated the role of magnetostatic interactions and the influence of the size of nanowires on the magnetic properties of these systems @xcite .",
    "recently escrig _ et al _ @xcite investigated the dependence of the coercivity of ni nanowire arrays when the external magnetic field is applied parallel to the nanowire axis .",
    "however , for applications in devices that use longitudinal / perpendicular magnetic recording , it is important to investigate the angular dependence of the magnetization .",
    "it is expected that the direction of the external magnetic field with respect to the wire axis strongly influences the magnetic properties of the array .",
    "the properties of virtually all magnetic materials are controlled by domains separated by domain walls .",
    "measurements on elongated magnetic nanostructures@xcite highlighted the importance of nucleation and propagation of a domain wall between opposing magnetic domains in the magnetization reversal process .",
    "three main idealized modes of magnetization reversal have been identified and occur depending on the geometry of the particles hertel02 , fss+02 , lae+07 .",
    "these mechanisms are known as _ coherent rotation _ , c , with all the spins rotating simultaneously ; _ vortex wall _ , v , in which spins invert progressively via propagation of a vortex domain wall ; and _ transverse wall _ ,",
    "t , in which spins invert progressively via propagation of a transverse domain wall .",
    "if a wire is thin enough , the exchange interaction forces the magnetization to be homogeneous through any radial cross section of the particle @xcite . in this way",
    "a transverse wall is the preferred mode in thin ferromagnetic wires ( diameters @xmath0 @xmath1 60 nm ) .    to investigate the angular dependence of the reversal of the magnetization in nanoparticles ,",
    "several models have been proposed . in particular , the stoner - wohlfarth model has been used to calculate the angular dependence of the coercivity when the reversal of the magnetization is driven by coherent rotation @xcite .",
    "however , landeros _",
    "et al _ @xcite have shown that coherent rotation is present only in very short particles , namely , when the length of the particles is similar to the domain wall width . on the other side ,",
    "aharoni @xcite calculated the angular dependence of the nucleation field in an ellipsoid when the reversal is driven by curling rotation .",
    "et al _ edl+07 extended this expression for magnetic nanotubes .",
    "finally , allende _",
    "et al _ @xcite presented an expression for the angular dependence of the coercivity in magnetic nanotubes when the reversal of the magnetization is driven by a transverse domain wall .",
    "however , the angular dependence of the coercivity in magnetic nanowire arrays has not been modeled yet .",
    "thus , usually experimental results for the angular dependence of the coercivity are interpreted using the stoner - wohlfarth model sw48 .    in this paper",
    "we present an analytical model that allows us to investigate the angular dependence of the coercivity and remanence for ni nanowire arrays , considering the different modes that can be present , as a function of wire geometry .",
    "additionally , experimental data for the switching field of high - aspect ratio ni nanowires will be compared with this analytical model .",
    "our approach to the preparation of magnetic ni nanowires arranged in hexagonally ordered , parallel arrays is based on the combination of two complementary aspects , namely , ( i ) the use of self - ordered anodic aluminum oxide ( aao ) as a porous template and ( ii ) the electrodeposition of ni in the cylindrical pores .    _",
    "anodic aluminum oxide _ is obtained from the electrochemical oxidation of aluminum metal under high voltage ( usually 20 - 200 v ) in aqueous acidic solutions @xcite . under certain proper sets of experimental conditions ( acid nature and concentration , temperature , and applied voltage ) ,",
    "the electrochemically generated layer of alumina displays a self - ordered porous structure .",
    "cylindrical pores of homogeneous diameter are thus obtained , with their long axis perpendicular to the plane of the alumina layer and ordered in a close - packed hexagonal arrangement . with our method @xcite , first and second anodizations of al",
    "have been carried out in 0.3__m _ _ oxalic acid under 40 v at 20 @xmath2c .",
    "subsequently , the pores were widened in a 0.085__m _ _ h@xmath3po@xmath4 solution at 37 @xmath2c , obtaining pores of @xmath5 nm diameter and a center - to - center distance of @xmath6 nm .    _",
    "electrodeposition _ was performed at a constant potential ( dc electrodeposition at -1.0 v ) . to facilitate the electric contact ,",
    "a very thin au - pd layer was sputtered on one side of the membrane , followed by the electrodeposition @xcite of a thicker nickel layer to achieve full pore sealing .",
    "the potentiostatic condition allows us to have more precise control of the electrochemical reaction , and then more accurate control of the growth of the ni nanowires @xcite .",
    "the morphology and the single - crystal structure of the individual nanowires after dissolution of the template were subsequently investigated by scanning electron microscopy ( sem ) and transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) using a jeol 5900 lv , checking the high ordering of the hexagonal arrays and the large aspect ratio .",
    "@xcite the chemical characterization of the nanowires was made by means of energy dispersive analysis of x - rays ( edax ) , obtaining a clear peak corresponding to the emission spectrum of ni .",
    "@xcite the magnetic measurements were performed by a vibrating sample magnetometer ( vsm ) with the applied field at different angles .",
    "the measurements were made at ambient temperature .",
    "figure 1 illustrates the hysteresis curves for two samples with diameter @xmath7 50 nm , lattice parameter @xmath8 100 nm , and lengths _ ( a ) _",
    "@xmath9 4 @xmath10 m and _ ( b ) _ 12 @xmath10 m , measured with the external field along and perpendicular to the axis of the wires . in this figure",
    "it is clearly seen that the easy axis of the nanowires is along the wire axis .",
    "4 @xmath11 m and ( b ) 12 @xmath11 m , @xmath7 50 nm , and @xmath8 100 nm.,width=302 ]    in a series of ni nanowire arrays of varying lengths ( all other geometric parameters being kept constant ) investigated by vsm magnetometry , we observed a significant dependence of the remanence ( see fig .",
    "2 ) and coercivity ( see fig .",
    "3 ) on the angle at which the external magnetic field is applied .",
    "in particular , the coercive field @xmath12 can be tuned between 100 and 720 oe approximately by properly adjusting @xmath13 .",

    "in order to analyze our results for the angular dependence , we made calculations which lead us to obtain analytical expressions for both coercivity and remanence .      in an array",
    "the magnetization inside each nanowire is oriented parallel to the wire s axis ( easy axis ) , due to the strong shape anisotropy . when the applied field is reduced to zero , at remanence",
    ", each wire presents its magnetization along the axis , but it is measured at an angle @xmath13 with respect to the easy axis . when the field is reduced to zero , and",
    "due to the strong shape anisotropy , the remanence rapidly relaxes and points along the axis .",
    "then , one can approximate the remanence of the wire by the projection of the magnetization on the direction of measurement , i. e. , @xmath20 , with @xmath21 the remanence measured at @xmath22 . the solid line in fig .",
    "2 illustrates this expression for @xmath23 together with our experimental results , showing a very good agreement , particularly for @xmath24 @xmath25 , for which the shape anisotropy is stronger .",
    "then the angular dependence of the remanence can be described by @xmath26 for nanowires with a large aspect ratio , i. e. , with their easy axis along the wire axis . for nanowires",
    "in which the easy axis is perpendicular to the wire axis , the angular behavior of the remanence can be modeled as @xmath27 .",
    "note that this expression defines only the angular behavior of the remanence , and does not determine the intrinsic remanence , @xmath18 , which has to be obtained by considering the particular reversal mode , according to the geometry of the wire .      in order to study the angular dependence of the reversal modes we have developed analytical calculations that lead us to obtain the coercive field @xmath28 for each of the reversal mechanisms , @xmath29 c , t , and v. the angular dependence of the nucleation for a coherent magnetization reversal",
    "was calculated by stoner - wohlfarth @xcite and gives@xmath30where @xmath31 and @xmath15 is the saturation magnetization .",

    "starting from the equations presented by landeros _ et al _",
    "@xcite we can calculate the width of the domain wall for the transverse mode as a function of the wire geometry .",
    "the domain wall width increases with the wire s radius , and is about 50 nm larger than the wire s radii . following this approach",
    ", @xmath36it is important to mention that the expressions for @xmath37 and @xmath38 differ only by the length . in a coherent reversal",
    ", @xmath39 represents the total length of the wire , and then the coercivity varies with the length .",
    "however , in a transverse mode , and because @xmath35 is almost independent of the length of the wire , as shown by landeros _",
    "et al _ @xcite , the coercivity is also independent of the length .",
    "then , when @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) , the @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) mode will always exhibit a lower coercivity , independent of @xmath44 .",
    "as shown in the stoner - wohlfarth model @xcite , the nucleation field does not represent the coercivity in all cases .",
    "however , from the discussion presented on p. 21 in reference [ 19 ] , the coercivity for coherent and transverse reversal modes can be written as@xmath45 in very short wires ( @xmath46 ) the energy cost involved in the creation of a domain wall gives rise to a coherent reversal .",
    "the curling mode was proposed by frei _",
    "et al _ @xcite and has been used to investigate magnetic switching in films @xcite and particles with different geometries , like spheres @xcite , prolate ellipsoids @xcite , and cylinders @xcite . however , for simplicity , expressions for the nucleation field obtained using infinite cylinders are used in all cases .",
    "the angular dependence of the curling nucleation field in a finite prolate spheroid was obtained by aharoniaharoni97 .",
    "@xmath47the demagnetizing factor of a wire along the @xmath48 axis has been obtained previously @xcite and is given by @xmath49 -\\frac{4r}{3\\pi l}$ ] . for a cylindrical geometry , shtrikman _",

    "@xmath51 and @xmath52 are bessel functions of the first and second kind , respectively , and @xmath53  is the exchange length . as pointed out by aharoni @xcite , for a prolate spheroid with @xmath22 , a jump of the magnetization at or",
    "near the curling nucleation field occurs .",
    "therefore , the coercivity is quite close to the absolute value of the nucleation field .",
    "then , we assumed here that @xmath54 is a good approximation to the coercivity , @xmath55 , when the reversal occurs in the v mode , as in other studies@xcite .",
    "with the above expressions we can study the angular dependence of the coercivity for our ni nanowire array . in our model the system reverses its magnetization by whichever mode opens an energetically accessible route first , that is , by the mode that exhibits the lowest coercivity",
    ". however , for highly dynamic cases , the path of lowest coercivity might not be accessible due to precession effects . by evaluating the coercivity for the different modes described in section iii we found the one which drives the reversal for each @xmath13 .",
    "figure 5 illustrates our results for an isolated ni nanowire with @xmath24 @xmath10 m .",
    "the dotted line represents the coercive field when the wire reverses its magnetization by a coherent rotation ; the dashed line is the coercive field when the wire reverses its magnetization by the propagation of a vortex domain wall , and the solid line represents the coercive field when the wire reverses its magnetization by the propagation of a transverse domain wall .     to 90@xmath2).,width=302 ]    as depicted in fig .",
    "5 , in a 50 nm diameter ni nanowire the t mode is preferred for almost every @xmath44 because it exhibits a lower coercivity",
    ". however , in the limit @xmath56 , the coercivity for the t and c modes are very close .",
    "our results for ni nanowires are combined in fig .",
    "the solid line represents the coercivity obtained by means of analytical calculations for @xmath24 @xmath10 m .",
    "however , for almost every @xmath57 , differences with the results for @xmath58 @xmath10 m are less than 3 @xmath59 , then at this scale , the line depicts results for both lengths .",
    "squares and triangles represent the experimental values of the coercivity for @xmath24 @xmath60 m and @xmath58 @xmath10 m , respectively . as shown in fig . 5 ,",
    "the coercivity obtained from the stoner - wohlfarth model ( coherent rotation ) is two to three times higher than the one obtained assuming a transverse domain wall , for almost all @xmath44 , and is much larger than the experimental results .",
    "then , although the shape of the angular dependence of the coercivity is the same for coherent rotation and the transverse reversal mode , the values are significantly different , showing that a transverse mode drives the reversal for each @xmath44 .",
    "however , the absolute values computed for the coercivity are still different compared with the experimental data .",
    "we ascribe such difference between calculations and experimental results to the interaction of each wire with the stray fields produced by the array . when the distances between nanowires are smaller or comparable to their diameter , the magnetostatic interactions between nanowires are stronger , and consequently have an important influence on the magnetic properties of the array .",
    "the interaction of each wire with the stray fields produced by the array strongly influences the coercivity @xcite .",
    "therefore , the small discrepancy between experiments and model can be regarded as the result of interactions within the wires in the array and size distribution , which are not included in our model .",
    "finally , the results presented above may be generalized .",
    "figure 7 shows the angular dependence of the coercivity for an isolated ni nanowire when it reverses its magnetization by the propagation of a transverse domain wall .",
    "we have considered different radii in order to investigate the behavior of the geometry of the wire with the angular dependence of the coercivity . in the range of radii",
    "considered , we find that an increase in the radius @xmath61 results in a decrease in the coercive field .",
    "in conclusion , by means of theoretical studies and experimental measurements we have investigated the angular dependence of the magnetization in ni nanowire arrays . as found from experiments , the angular dependence in large aspect ratio wires",
    "can be understood assuming that the relaxation process is very fast and then the magnetization orients rapidly along the easy axes .",
    "we have derived analytical expressions that allow us to obtain the coercivity when the wire reverses its magnetization by means of a coherent rotation , transverse reversal mode , and a vortex domain wall . for the wires studied",
    "experimentally the magnetization is driven by means of the nucleation and propagation of a transverse wall . the stray field produced by the array , as a function of the angle of the external field ,",
    "can not be determined analytically .",
    "however , it is responsible for small differences between experiments and calculations .",
