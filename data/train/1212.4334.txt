    "communication today has been posed with the problem of overcrowding in unlicensed bands , a direct consequence of the static spectrum allocation policy .",
    "cognitive radios offer an exciting solution to this problem by intelligently exploiting the under - utilized spectrum in licensed bands without causing any hindrance to the licensed user s communication .",
    "co - operative communication is an interesting paradigm in which cognitive radios have the potential of creating tremendous impact . in its simplest form , co - operative communication consists of an intermediate node which relays data between the transmitter and receiver , located far away from each other , in case of a weak direct communication link between them .",
    "this results in an improvement in the link quality and in turn , the system capacity .",
    "communication using multiple hop relays not only helps in overcoming path loss and achieve power gain , but also adds multipath diversity , critical to wireless communication over fading channels[8 ] .",
    "t. nadkar @xmath0 have shown in [ 1 ] that in an scr scenario , su nodes can act as multihop relays to maximize throughput between the pu transmitter and the pu receiver , which have a very weak direct communication link between them .",
    "the time which the pu saves through the scr approach is rewarded to the su nodes to carry out su - su communication using licensed pu band .",
    "similar to this model , termed as _ ` cognitive relaying with time incentive'_[1 ] , the authors in [ 1 ] also propose another scheme with frequency usage incentives . in this model , while relaying the pu s data , su nodes only try to achieve the throughput that the primary would have achieved on its own on the direct weak link , but sus require a lesser number of channels to achieve the same .",
    "the remaining frequency channels are awarded to the sus for their own communication .",
    "authors in [ 6 ] have discussed an interesting _ cooperative cognitive radio network_[6 ] where the primary transmitter asks for relay - based cooperation from some other pu or su node for its transmission to the primary receiver .",
    "this drastically improves the throughput of primary communication and the transmission is completed at a higher data rate . in return , the su nodes may be allowed to use the licensed primary band for the saved time duration by paying some revenue .",
    "authors in [ 6 ] formulate a stackelberg game between the pu(as leader ) and su nodes(as follower ) where the pu nodes try to maximize its throughput and revenue using the su nodes while the su nodes tries to use the channel at the least cost .",
    "et al . _ in [ 7 ] also takes the _ property - rights model _ of spectrum - usage and discuss a model where the pu node chooses a subset of su nodes and allows them to use primary band for some units of time asking for co - operation by relaying of primary s data in return .",
    "in the awarded time , the su nodes compete with each other for their own communication by power control in a distributed fashion[7 ] .",
    "thus , all these literatures motivates us to have a detailed look into the _ property - rights model _ in contrast to the much studied _ commons model _ and see if the primary can leverage its spectrum to the secondary nodes asking for a better qos for itself .",
    "mobility in cognitive radio networks also hasnt been a much studied area .",
    "mobility brings in notable impact on various parameters of a cr network including but not limited to spectrum opportunity , handoff , pu protection range , spatio - temporal diversity , sensing scheduling[9 ] etc . in this work , by introducing mobility to the su nodes following a specific mobility pattern , while keeping the pu nodes stationary , we analyze the throughput in each of the relaying phases and also find a bound on the delay for scr model in cognitive radio network .",
    "+ the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we discuss the related works on theoretical bounds of throughput in mobile networks . sec .",
    "iii talks about our system model . in sec .",
    "iv , we show the detailed throughput analysis and we conclude the paper with results and discussions in sec . v.",
    "gupta and kumar[2 ] have shown in their pioneering work on capacity of ad - hoc wireless networks that the per node average achievable throughput for a ad - hoc network with randomly distributed static nodes is @xmath1 in a non - interfering scenario where w is the available bandwidth to the network . even by optimally choosing the positions of the nodes and their transmission ranges , the best average per - node throughput that can be achieved is @xmath2 .",
    "the results in [ 1 ] also assumes an optimal scheduler which knows the location and traffic patterns of all the nodes .",
    "if they are not known or the nodes starts moving , then the capacity will be smaller than this .",
    "in other words , the maximum bit - meters * per second that can be supported by an ad - hoc wireless network on a disk of unit area is @xmath2 .",
    "thus , the authors suggests considering networks with smaller no . of nodes or scenario where each node communicates with its nearest neighbour since increase in node density n reduces the capacity .",
    "tse and grossglauser[3 ] shows that by introducing mobility and using a 2-hop relay algorithm in between each s - d pair , the per node throughput can be increased from @xmath3 or @xmath4 to @xmath5 .",
    "this surprising increase in throughput owes its reason to the mobility of nodes , scheduling policy and the buffering and relaying of data at the intermediate nodes .",
    "the main result in [ 3 ] is that even though n increases , the long - term throughput per source(s)-destination(d ) pair remains almost unaffected .",
    "but the authors in [ 3 ] do nt consider the delay caused in such a model .",
    "the results in [ 3 ] are mostly useful for systems which can afford to incur a large delay to increase the throughput .",
    "the key problem in a fixed ad - hoc network is that direct communication from s to d becomes extremely difficult when the no . of nodes increases[3 ] .",
    "so , intermediate nodes are used as relays .",
    "usually , a multi - hop route consists of nodes of the order @xmath6 .",
    "so , when n is very high , the nodes are always busy with relaying .",
    "thus , effective throughput of the network comes down . the solution to reduce number of hops",
    "is sought by introducing mobility .",
    "the nodes transmit only when they come close to the destination . but this ca nt be a realistic solution .",
    "authors in [ 3 ] suggests a routing algorithm by which a source node distributes its packets to its nearest neighbors .",
    "these mobile relay nodes then pass on the packet to the final destination when any of them go close to the destination .",
    "as n increases , the probability of at least one of the mobile relays going close to the destination becomes very high .",
    "thus , a source node uses the multiple user diversity to transfer its packet to the destination node .",
    "bansal and liu shows in [ 4 ] that by following a specific routing algorithm , the per node throughput can be _",
    "c_.@xmath7 keeping the delay less than @xmath8 .",
    "in our network model , we consider @xmath9 static primary user ( pu ) and _ m _ secondary user ( su ) nodes .",
    "the pu nodes are static and infrastructure - based .",
    "the su nodes , on the other hand , are mobile which move around following a specific mobility model that we discuss next .",
    "we assume that every node knows each other s position at every instant of time by using some mechanism like gps or centralized location database .",
    "the link between the pu @xmath10 and pu @xmath11 being very weak as considered in [ 1 ] , the pu nodes seek help from the mobile su nodes to relay their packets at a higher data rate .",
    "the su nodes in turn get _ time - incentive_[1 ] to carry out their own communication on the licensed pu band without any need of spectrum sensing and thus they save their own energy as well .",
    "the wireless channel that we consider in our setup is in the same spirit as of most of the other works[2]-[5 ] , i.e , we consider large scale path loss and ignore the small scale multipath fading .",
    "so , channel gain is defined as @xmath12where _ h _ is the distance between the source(s)-destination(d ) pair and @xmath13 is the path - loss factor .",
    "we call the transmission from a source node _ i _ to a destination node _ j _ at time _",
    "is successful if @xmath14 where , @xmath15 is the transmission power of node _",
    "i _ at time _",
    "t _ and @xmath16 is the threshold signal to noise ratio required for a successful transmission .",
    "we define the mobility pattern of the su nodes as follows : + the initial positions of the su nodes are randomly chosen from a uniform distribution . then , these su nodes start moving choosing velocity and direction in the following manner : + * velocity : * all the su nodes moves with a same fixed velocity @xmath17 throughout the time . +",

    "t _ , the nodes changes its direction to a new direction which lies in an angular range @xmath19 from its previous direction .",
    "this way of modelling the direction of mobile nodes has been done keeping in view the very realistic situations where a moving node ( for eg , a wireless device handheld by a person or fixed to a vehicle ) usually moves in a specific direction and does nt change abruptly to any new random direction which is poles apart from its previous direction .

    "relaying of packets is done in the following 3 phase scheme as it has been done in [ 3],[4 ] : pu @xmath10-su relaying , su - su relaying and su - pu @xmath11 relaying .",

    "the pu @xmath10 selects a su node for relaying which lies in between these two straight lines and moves towards the line joining the pu @xmath10 and pu @xmath11 and also towards the pu @xmath11 .",
    "the objective is to have a minimum path length from the pu @xmath10 to the pu @xmath11 , so the su nodes moving closely around the line joining the pu @xmath10 and pu @xmath11 are preferred .",
    "closeness to the pu @xmath10 _ : a su node lying close to the pu @xmath10 is preferred over a far - away node as nearest neighbour communication requires less transmission power and thus reduces interference and increases throughput as shown in [ 2 ] .    _",
    "case(b ) : su - su relaying _ + in this phase of relaying also , the parameters considered to select a node is same as above .",
    "a su node looks in the angular range @xmath20 from the straight line joining itself to the pu @xmath11 in search of a close - by su node to relay the pu s packet .",
    "+   + _ case(c ) : su - pu @xmath11 relaying _ + in this last phase of the multihop communication , when the su node finds that it has come close to the pu @xmath11 , it passes on the packet to the pu @xmath11 .",
    "the static pu transmitter node looks for a useful mobile node ( useful node is one which satisfies all the conditions mentioned above ) in the angular range @xmath20 from the straight line joining itself to the pu receiver and transfers its packets .",
    "we now show a bound on the closeness factor between the pu and su so that the communication is always successful . theorem 3 of [ 4 ] specifies the least condition under which the communication between static pu node and mobile su node is always a success .",
    "we use this result to find a circular region around the pu transmitter so that the pu - su communication is always successful inside this region .",

    "[ con ]   +    using the result of lemma 5 of [ 4 ] , it can be further shown that if two mobile nodes are at a distance less than @xmath101 , then the probability of successful communication is greater than or equal to @xmath102 where @xmath16 is the threshold sinr for successful transmission , @xmath103 is the path - loss factor and @xmath104 is the number of mobile nodes .",
    "+ _ * throughput calculation : * _ @xmath105      when a mobile su node finally arrives sufficiently close to the static pu receiver , it finally hands over the primary packet to the pu receiver in this last phase of the relaying process .",
    "+ _ * throughput calculation : * _ + by symmetry , throughput in mobile to static relaying phase is same as obtained in the static to mobile relaying phase .",
    "therefore , + @xmath106 + so , net effective throughput for the entire relaying path from static pu transmitter to static pu receiver is @xmath107 + @xmath108 is different for static and mobile phases relaying phases .",
    "so , the above expression amounts to minimum of @xmath109 . since @xmath110",
    ", it is obvious that @xmath111 .",
    "thus , our conclusion is that throughput is greater than @xmath112 .",
    "now , the net delay incurred in transferring a single packet from pu transmitter to the pu receiver is obtained as a sum of the waiting times for each relay node to find another relay node . note",
    "that we assume that the time required to transfer a packet from one node to another is sufficiently small compared to the waiting time for relaying , so it does nt make any difference in delay .",
    "we showed earlier that the time that a node has to wait until another node satisfying all the relaying criteria comes in its vicinity is @xmath95 with probability 0.9999 .",
    "if a packet is delivered in @xmath113 interactions , the total delay incurred by the packet is @xmath114 .",
    "since we have assumed that all the mobile nodes travel with the same speed @xmath115 , it is very unlikely that one node would receive the same packet more than once in the course of the packet s journey .",
    "thus , maximum number of interactions is @xmath116 .",
    "+ thus , total delay @xmath117 .",
    "existing literatures in cognitive radio does nt talk much about mobile nodes .",
    "in addition to that , most of the work focus on the _ commons model _ of spectrum access and _ property rights model _ is much less explored .",
    "we bring these two relatively unexplored areas together in this paper and show analytically the lower and upper theoretical bounds on throughput and delay respectively specific to our defined mobility pattern and relaying strategy .",
    "one of the basic assumption used in computing the bounds on throughput and delay is that the su nodes moves with a non - zero velocity . since throughput and delay have been calculated in terms of _ number of interactions _ which is a fixed constant in case of a static network , the obtained results are valid only for @xmath118 .",
    "the throughput value will satisfy the obtained bound with an associated probability of 0.9999 which is fairly high . taking a closer look at the throughput will reveal that it decreases as the number of mobile nodes increases , since an increase in the number of secondary nodes leads to an increase in the interference as well , thus enhancing the chances of a packet being dropped .",
    "an increase in @xmath119 leads to a decrease in the throughput because more nodes would then be eligible to receive packets , which would directly translate in greater interference . delay on the other hand , decreases drastically with a small increase in the number of nodes because waiting time for finding a suitable relay node reduces with an increase in the number of nodes .",
    "similarly , a small increase in the speed of mobile nodes leads to a drastic decrease in the total delay , which again can be established intuitively owing to the increase in number of interactions .",
    "although tse and grossglauser s algorithm[3 ] guarantees a high throughput , it is more suited to delay - tolerant systems , which is unlike most of the real - time applications . what is interesting to note is how we can leverage our relay - selection algorithm to increase throughput .",
    "a higher throughput can be achieved by restricting @xmath119 to small values .",
    "a suitable value of @xmath119 could be selected to exploit the throughput - delay tradeoff .",
