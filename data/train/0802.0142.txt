    "an activity of many compact objects  active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , young stellar objects ( ysos ) , microquasars  is associated with the highly collimated jets .",
    "these jets are thought to be a natural outlet of an excess angular momentum of a central object and accreting matter@xcite . the latest observations indicating the jet rotation in agns  @xcite and ysos  @xcite support this idea .",
    "the most attractive model for such outflows is the mhd one@xcite .",
    "of course , the main question within this model is the collimation itself  @xcite .",
    "we assume here that collimation is due to a finite external gas and/or magnetic pressure@xcite . indeed , proposing that it is the external magnetic field @xmath0",
    "g that plays the main role in the collimation , we obtain @xmath1 . here",
    "@xmath2 is the distance from the rotational axis , and the subscripts in correspond to the values in the vicinity of the central object .",
    "the similar evaluation can be obtained for external pressure @xmath3 .",
    "e.g. , for ysos ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) we obtain @xmath6 cm , in agreement with observational data .",
    "accordingly , for agns ( @xmath7 g , @xmath8 cm ) we have @xmath9 pc .",
    "it means that the external media may indeed play important role in the collimation process .",
    "the internal structure of cylindrical jets was considered both for non - relativistic  @xcite and relativistic  @xcite flows . in particular",
    ", it was shown that for constant angular velocity of plasma @xmath10 it is impossible to obtain reasonable solution with total zero electric current  @xcite , but it can be constructed if the angular velocity vanishes at the jet boundary and if the external pressure is not equal to zero  @xcite .    another result was obtained for relativistic and non - relativistic cylindrical flows  @xcite is that the poloidal magnetic field @xmath11 has a jet - like form @xmath12 where @xmath13 . but this relation corresponds to a very slow ( logarithmic ) growth of the magnetic flux function : @xmath14 .",
    "it means that if the jet core contains only a small part of the total magnetic flux @xmath15 , the jet boundary is to locate exponentially far from the axis , magnetic field being too weak to be in equilibrium with the external media .",
    "in what follows we ll try to resolve this contradiction .",
    "thus , we consider the following model : the flow crosses all the critical surfaces while the effects of the external media are negligible .",
    "it allows us to use standard values of integrals of motion .",
    "as the supersonic wind expands , its pressure becomes comparable with the external gas and/or magnetic pressure .",
    "the interaction of a flow with external media results in well collimated jet which can be described by 1d cylindrical equations .",
    "for cylindrical flow one can write down electric and magnetic fields as well as the four - velocity of a plasma @xmath16 in standard form @xmath17 here @xmath18 is the concentration in the comoving reference frame , and @xmath19 is the lorentz - factor . in other words , it is convenient to express all the values in terms of magnetic flux @xmath20 and total electric current @xmath21 , the angular velocity of plasma @xmath10 and the particle to magnetic flux ratio @xmath22 being constant on the magnetic surfaces : @xmath23 , @xmath24 . accordingly , the trans - field gs equation can be rewritten as  @xcite @xmath25 here @xmath26 , the alfvnic factor is @xmath27 , @xmath28 is the alfvnic mach number , @xmath29 is the relativistic enthalpy , and the derivative @xmath30 acts on the integrals of motion only . finally , the relativistic bernoulli equation @xmath31 has a form @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",

    "certainly , the approach under consideration is 1d as well . for this reason",
    ", it has some properties similar to another self  similar ones . in particular",
    ", one can easily check that the singularity on the fast magnetisonic surface is absent . on the other hand ,",
    "singularity appears on the cusp surface where the factors in front of @xmath63 in ( [ ap10 ] ) and ( [ gs - me ] ) vanish .",
    "nevertheless , in our opinion , this one - dimensional approach has clear advantages in comparison with the standard self - similar ones  @xcite .",
    "first of all , it allows us to use any form of the five integrals of motion .",
    "indeed , the self - similarity of a flow demands definite dependence of invariants which may be not correspond to the real boundary conditions .",
    "e.g. , for relativistic self - similar flow the angular velocity @xmath10 is to have the form @xmath64",
    "@xcite . it does not correspond neither to the homogeneous stellar rotation , nor to the keplerian disk rotation .",
    "moreover , this dependence has the singularity at the rotational axis .",
    "thus , the standard self - similar approach can not describe the central ( and , hence , the most energetic ) part of the flow .",
    "further , classical self - similar approach can not describe the region of electric current closure .",
    "finally , for relativistic magnetically dominated flow it is more convenient to use first - order equation ( [ ap10 ] ) instead of second order gs equation for which it is necessary to be careful in taking into account small but important terms @xmath65 .",
    "indeed , the force balance equation ( [ ap10 ] ) does not contain the leading terms @xmath66 and @xmath67 as they are analytically removed using bernoulli equation . as a result , as @xmath68 all the terms in equation ( [ ap10 ] ) are of the same order .",
    "in particular , in the limit @xmath69 , @xmath70 equation ( [ ap10 ] ) can be rewritten in the simple form  @xcite @xmath71 without the last term @xmath72 equation ( [ qq ] ) results in the conservation of the value @xmath73 @xmath74 was found in  @xcite for conical magnetic field . it is the conservation of @xmath73 that results in the jet - like solution ( [ r-2 ] ) .",
    "indeed , as @xmath75 const and @xmath76 const in the center of a jet , we obtain @xmath77 . using now the definitions @xmath78 and @xmath79 ( and the condition @xmath80 const fulfilled in the very center of a flow ) , we return to ( [ r-2 ] ) .",
    "but , as we will see , the term containing @xmath81 ( which appears to be missed previously ) can be important  @xcite .",
    "it is this term that can change the jet - like structure in relativistic case .",
    "the solution of equations ( [ ap4 ] ) and ( [ ap10 ] ) depends essentially on the mach number on the rotational axis @xmath82  @xcite . for @xmath83 where @xmath84 @xmath85 the poloidal magnetic field corresponding to jet - like solution ( [ r-2 ] ) . on the other hand , for @xmath86 @xmath87 here",
    "@xmath88 , and @xmath89 is the michel magnetization parameter  @xcite ( @xmath90 for particle dominated flow @xmath91 ) .",
    "it means that @xmath92 const , i.e. , the solution has no jet - like form .",
    "as was already stressed , the solution ( [ sol0 ] ) can not be realized in the presence of the external media .",
    "hence , for any finite pressure @xmath93 magnetic field in the center of cylindrical jet @xmath94 can not be much smaller than @xmath95 .",
    "it gives @xmath96 where @xmath97 .",
    "thus , for external magnetic field @xmath98 the internal structure of a relativistic jet is to be described by relations ( [ sol1 ] ) . on the other hand , for @xmath99",
    "the core with @xmath100 is to be formed in the center of a flow ( i.e. , for @xmath101 ) . in particular , for @xmath102 ( and for @xmath103 ) the solution can be presented as  @xcite @xmath104 the sum being @xmath105 .",
    "e.g. , for @xmath106 we have @xmath107 , @xmath108 ( cf . [ sol1 ] ) , and for @xmath109 we have @xmath110 , @xmath111 .",
    "the results presented above were reproduced recently both analytically and numerically . in  @xcite it was shown that 1d approximation becomes true for paraboloidal outflow at large distances from the equatorial plane @xmath112 where the flow becomes actually cylindrical . up to the distance @xmath113 one can use the relations ( [ sol1 ] ) , so that the poloidal magnetic field does not depend on @xmath2 .",
    "the region @xmath114 corresponds to core - like solution ( [ a+b ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , the transverse dimension of a jet remains parabolic : @xmath115 .",
    "numerically the scalings ( [ a+b ] ) were confirmed in  @xcite .",
    "remember that the existence of cylindrical core with @xmath116 was predicted in many papers  @xcite , but magnetic flux @xmath117 inside the core was unknown up to now . as we see , in relativistic case the central core contains only a small part of the magnetic flux : @xmath118 nevertheless , as @xmath119 , such core - like flow can exist in the presence of external media .",

    "( @xmath124 for parabolic flow ) the lorentz - factor for @xmath125 can be determined as @xmath126 accordingly , one can write down  @xcite @xmath127^{1/2}. \\label{46b}\\ ] ] it means that for @xmath128 ( @xmath129 for parabolic flow ) where the transverse jet dimension @xmath130 almost the full energy transformation from the poynting to particle energy flux can be realized . in particular , for the particle moving along parabolic magnetic field line one can obtain @xmath131 this scaling was confirmed numerically as well  @xcite .",
    "it is necessary to stress that relation ( [ gx ] ) takes place only if one can neglect the curvature of magnetic surfaces .",
    "indeed , for magnetically dominated case in the limit @xmath132 the leading terms in 2d gs equation can be rewritten in the simple form  @xcite @xmath133 here @xmath134 is the ( poloidal ) curvature radius of magnetic surfaces , and @xmath135 .",
    "neglecting now the curvature term and using standard relations @xmath136 and @xmath137 resulting from ( [ defe ] ) and ( [ ap4 ] ) , we return to ( [ gx ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if the curvature is important , then one can neglect the first term in ( [ balance ] ) , and we obtain @xmath138 this scaling taking place for split - monopole geometry outside the fast magnetosonic surface corresponds to @xmath139  @xcite .",
    "remember that for @xmath140 we have `` linear '' acceleration ( [ gx ] ) .",
    "thus , the effective particle acceleration can take place only if @xmath130 , and if the curvature of magnetic surfaces is not important .",
    "the approach under consideration allows us matching the self - similar solution to the rotational axis . indeed , for relativistic self - similar invariants @xmath141 the solution of the 2d gs equation for @xmath142 has the form @xmath143 , where @xmath144 is the spherical radius",
    "hence , far from the equatorial plane where @xmath145 ( @xmath146 , @xmath147 ) one can write down @xmath148 as a result , the cylindrical radius of the boundary @xmath149 can be written as @xmath150    let us consider now the central part of a flow @xmath151 . if again @xmath146 , one can integrate 1d cylindrical equations ( [ ap4 ] ) and ( [ ap10 ] ) considering @xmath152 as a parameter .",

    "as a result , equations ( [ ap4 ] ) , ( [ ap10 ] ) give @xmath159 substituting now @xmath160 , we obtain @xmath161 the coefficient @xmath162 , in agreement with self - similar property , does not depend on @xmath55 .        for nonrelativistic case in the central part of a flow one can use general expressions ( [ probstat - l1 ] )",
    "@xmath163 non - dimensional current @xmath164 depending now on the angular velocity @xmath10 . for @xmath165 , where @xmath166 corresponding to particle dominated outflow near the star the 2d problem can be solved analytically  @xcite , and we obtain @xmath167 . for magnetically dominated flow near the origin one can write down  @xcite @xmath168",
    "nevertheless , for @xmath169 , where @xmath170 the flow remains particle dominated : @xmath171 .",
    "remember that in the nonrelativistic case the flow can pass smoothly the critical surfaces only if @xmath172 .",
    "thus , the flow at large distances is to be particle dominated .",
    "solving now equations ( [ 11a ] ) and ( [ gs - me ] ) for sub alfvnic flow @xmath173 we obtain that poloidal magnetic field remains constant inside the jet up to the very boundary .",

    "but such a flow can exist only in the presence of large enough external magnetic field @xmath175 . for ordinary ysos @xmath176 g",
    ", so sub alfvnic flow in a jet can not be realized .",
    "on the other hand , for super - alfvnic cold outflow one can find that the term @xmath177 in ( [ gs - me ] ) plays no role .",
    "it means that here @xmath178 const , and we return to jet - like solution ( [ r-2])@xcite .",
    "but , as was already stressed , in the presence of finite external pressure it is possible if the central core @xmath179 contains almost all magnetic flux @xmath15",
    ". this can be realized only for slow rotation @xmath165 . in this case magnetic field on the axis",
    "can not be much smaller than @xmath180 : @xmath181 accordingly , @xmath182 .",
    "this structure was reproduced numerically as well  @xcite .",
    "but for fast rotation @xmath183 the core magnetic flux @xmath184 is much smaller even than the flux @xmath185 ( [ inin ] ) within the central part of a flow : @xmath186 it means that the cold cylindrical flow resulting from the interaction of fast rotating supersonic wind with the external media can not be realized .      to resolve this contradiction , one can propose that in real nonrelativistic jets an important role may play the finite temperature .",
    "e.g. , the additional heating can be connected with the oblique shock near the base of a jet  @xcite .",
    "it is well known that such a shock is needed to explain the emission lines observed in ysos  @xcite.this situation is alike the hydrodynamical supersonic flow meeting the wall .",
    "this analogy is all the more reasonable as the non - relativistic supersonic outflow is to be particle dominated .    to evaluate the thermal terms in equations ( [ 11a ] ) and ( [ gs - me ] ) we consider pure hydrodynamical shock wave swifting spherically symmetric supersonic flow into cylindrical jet .",
    "knowing the swifting angle , one can determine the entropy jump @xmath187 as a function of particle flux , all other four invariants being the same as in front of a shock . as a result",
    ", we found that fastly rotating jet with @xmath183 heated in a shock is to have core - jet structure ( [ a+b ] ) with @xmath188 , @xmath119 .",
    "hence , it can be realized in the presence of external media .",
    "obtained jet parameters ( @xmath189 , @xmath190 km / s at @xmath191 a.u . )  @xcite are in agreement with observational data .",
    "the procedure similar to sect . 4.1.4 . for nonrelativistic particle dominated flow",
