    "` _ the strong interactions comprise a richer field than the set of phenomena that we have learned to describe in terms of perturbative qcd or the ( near- ) static non - perturbative domain of lattice qcd ( ... ) it may well be that interesting unusual occurrences happen outside the framework of perturbative qcd - happen in some collective , or intrinsically nonperturbative way .",
    "_ ' it is in these terms that the _ resource letter : quantum chromodynamics _ , arxiv : 1002.5032v2 [ hep - ph ] , of february 26 , 2010 , concludes its overall review of the most salient achievements realized in qcd .",
    "of course by its very definition , the _ non - perturbative _ qualifier applies to a large variety of very different realizations : there are several ways of ` being non - perturbative ' , in the either context of lagrangian quantum field theory or of algebraic quantum field theory , the former admittedly more pragmatic .",
    "it is this route of lagrangian quantum field theory which will here be followed so as to introduce an extraordinary property of fermionic qcd amplitudes .",
    "this property can be phrased as follows :    in any quark / quark ( or anti - quark ) scattering amplitude , the full gauge - invariant sum of all cubic and quartic vectorial gluonic interactions , fermionic loops included , results in a local contact - type interaction mediated by a tensor field which , in both internal ( color ) and external ( lorentz ) indices is rank 2 and antisymmetric .",
    "this property , dubbed ` effective locality ' appears to be a genuine one of qcd and is worth exploring in relation to the expected non - perturbative properties of qcd , and some examples will be presented .",
    "it is most interesting that a previous approach , looking for a ` most dual ' description of qcd , and first restricted to the pure yang - mills case , was able to display some positive results in this direction @xcite .",
    "it may also be worth noting that a non - perturbative analysis of yang - mills thermodynamics has recently put forth the occurrence of a contact - type interaction within the confined phase of @xmath2 and @xmath3 theories @xcite . and",
    "even more recently , a fascinating functional connection of our approach to a most general formulation of quantum field theories @xcite has been brought to our attention .    in a previous paper  @xcite , it was shown how the formal schwinger solution  @xcite to the qcd generating functional can , by a slight rearrangement , be brought into gauge - invariant form .",
    "this simple procedure has been overlooked for decades .",
    "when combined with the fradkin representations  @xcite for the functionals @xmath4 $ ] and @xmath1 $ ] ( that are an integral part of the schwinger solution ) , as well as with the useful halpern representation @xcite for @xmath5}$ ] , the relevant gaussian functional operations may be performed exactly .",
    "this corresponds to the summation of all feynman graphs of gluons exchanged between quarks , and one then explicitly sees the cancelation of all gauge - dependent gluon propagators .",
    "gauge invariance is achieved by gauge independence , a hope some authors long had ( _ e.g. _ r.p .",
    "feynman ) for qed @xcite , which turns out to be realized in the case of qcd thanks to its very non - abelian structure .",
    "one also can see the appearance of a new and exact property of effective locality ( el ) , which simplifies all calculations by transforming the remaining functional integrals into sets of ordinary integrals , a non - trivial mathematical point @xcite .",
    "further , it readily becomes apparent that one can not continue to consider quarks in the same , conventional fashion as quanta of other ( _ e.g. _ , abelian ) fields , such as electrons , which satisfy the standard measurement properties of quantum mechanics , perfect position dependence at the cost of unknown momenta , and vice - versa .",
    "this is impossible for quarks since they always appear asymptotically in bound states , and their transverse coordinates can never , in principle , be exactly measured . in the developments to follow one finds that a violation of this principle produces absurdities in the exact evaluation of any qcd amplitude . at a phenomenological level , we therefore propose a change in the basic qcd lagrangian , which introduces a measure of transverse fluctuations by the insertion of an unknown probability amplitude that is essential to and determined from quark binding into hadrons .",
    "all previous absurdities in estimates of all `` realistic '' qcd amplitudes are then removed , and one finds a simple method of constructing quark - binding potentials , as well as other , somewhat more involved potentials between nucleons to form nuclei .",
    "this paper is divided into a sequence of sections each emphasizing a particular aspect of this formulation . in section  [ sec2 ] , as a result of the gaussian nature of the functional operations which are performed exactly , the expression of the fundamental gauge invariance becomes evident , along with the el property and its simplifying effects . in sections",
    "[ sec3 ] ,  [ sec4 ] , and   [ sec5 ] , the obvious need for transverse fluctuations is made clear , and the form of a corresponding insertion of an unknown probability amplitude into the basic qcd lagrangian is described .",
    "sections  [ sec6 ] ,  [ sec7 ] , and  [ sec8 ] deal with the construction of quark - binding potentials , exhibited for a model pion and model nucleon , using a simple , analytic technique ( which reverses the potential - theory derivation of an eikonal function from a specified potential ) .",
    "section  [ sec9 ] is devoted to a brief summary and speculations . in the remainder of the present section , we shall for completeness",
    "summarize the argument of @xcite , which shows how the conventional schwinger solution for the generating functional may be converted , for qcd , but not for qed , into a manifestly gauge - invariant form .",
    "it is simplest to begin with qed , and its free - photon lagrangian , @xmath6    whose action integral may be rewritten as @xmath7    the difficulty of maintaining both manifest gauge invariance ( mgi ) and manifest lorentz covariance ( mlc ) appears at this stage . what has typically been done since",
    "the original days of fermi , who simply neglected the inconvenient @xmath8 , is to use the latter to define a relativistic gauge in which all calculations maintain mlc , while relying upon strict charge conservation to maintain an effective gauge invariance of the theory .",
    "the choice of relativistic gauge can be arranged in various ways .",

    "such linkage operation statements are frequently more convenient than the standard fi representations , since they do not require specification of infinite normalization constants .",
    "the tr - log term of ( [ eq:4 ] ) is an infinite phase factor , representing the sum of the vacuum energies generated by longitudinal and time - like photons , with a weight @xmath9 arbitrarily inserted ; this quantity can be removed by an appropriate version of normal ordering , but can more simply be absorbed into an overall normalization constant .    including the conventional fermion interaction , @xmath17 , and the gauge interaction @xmath18 , it is easy to show  @xcite that the standard schwinger solution for the gf in the @xmath19-covariant gauge becomes @xmath20 = \\mathcal{n } \\left .",

    "the answer is that the assumption has earlier been made , in the conventional abelian way , that the quark and/or anti - quark may be treated as ordinary particles , whereas asymptotic quarks exist only in bound states : their transverse coordinates can not , in principle , be specified , and there is therefore no reason to retain the conventional ( abelian ) practice in which such measurement is assumed possible .",

    "the latter display sums over interconnected propagators , which provide a certain vagueness of position , whereas in the exact non - perturbative qcd , as described above , one finds the sharp determination of delta - functions corresponding to the el property , and transverse imprecision must therefore be introduced separately , as a fundamental input to the theory .    in ref .",

    "<S> following a previous calculation of quark scattering in eikonal approximation , this paper presents a new , analytic and rigorous approach to the calculation of qcd phenomena . in this formulation a basic distinction between the conventional `` idealistic '' description of qcd and a more `` realistic '' description is brought into focus by a non - perturbative , gauge - invariant evaluation of the schwinger solution for the qcd generating functional in terms of the exact fradkin representations of the green s functional @xmath0 and the vacuum functional @xmath1 $ ] . because quarks exist asymptotically only in bound states , their transverse coordinates can never be measured with arbitrary precision ; the non - perturbative neglect of this statement leads to obstructions that are easily corrected by invoking in the basic lagrangian a probability amplitude which describes such transverse imprecision .    </S>",
    "<S> the second result of this non - perturbative analysis is the appearance of a new and simplifying output called `` effective locality '' , in which the interactions between quarks by the exchange of a `` gluon bundle ''  which `` bundle '' contains an infinite number of gluons , including cubic and quartic gluon interactions  display an exact locality property that reduces the several functional integrals of the formulation down to a set of ordinary integrals . </S>",
    "<S> it should be emphasized that `` non - perturbative '' here refers to the effective summation of all gluons between a pair of quark lines  which may be the same quark line , as in a self - energy graph  but does not ( yet ) include a summation over all closed - quark loops which are tied by gluon - bundle exchange to the rest of the `` bundle diagram '' . as an example of the power of these methods we offer as a first analytic calculation the quark - antiquark binding potential of a pion , and the corresponding three - quark binding potential of a nucleon , obtained in a simple way from relevant eikonal scattering approximations . a second calculation , analytic , non - perturbative and gauge - invariant , of a nucleon - nucleon binding potential to form a model deuteron , will appear separately . </S>"
