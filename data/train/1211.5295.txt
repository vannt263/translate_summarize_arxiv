    "neutrino oscillations have established the need for massive neutrinos and hence physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) . while most of the data can be explained in a minimal framework of three active neutrinos ",
    "realized for example with a type - i seesaw mechanism  @xcite  some experiments and observations strongly favor one or two additional light neutrinos , with masses around @xmath0{ev}$ ] and @xmath1 mixing  @xcite .",
    "these hints stem from completely independent fields , namely particle physics , cosmology and astrophysics .",
    "we refer to the exhaustive overview of the situation provided by the white paper in ref .  @xcite .",
    "since these new states are not allowed to contribute to the @xmath2 width , they have been dubbed sterile neutrinos .",
    "a large number of experiments will be coming up in the next months and years with the aim of investigating their possible presence with a variety of methods and approaches  @xcite .",
    "obviously , proving the existence of light sterile neutrinos would be a sensational and groundbreaking discovery .",
    "sterile neutrinos aside , the mixing of active neutrinos has been of much interest to the physics community , as the peculiar values for the mixing angles seem to hint at an underlying symmetry principle .",
    "the astonishing precision of neutrino experiments has however put a slight dent in this idea , as increasingly complicated models seem to be required in order to be valid . on the other end of the model - building spectrum , the complete absence of a symmetry behind lepton mixing",
    "has also been proposed  @xcite , both for an effective theory of neutrino mass and for the type - i seesaw case .",
    "the apparent randomness of parameters in this scheme can be the result of a sufficiently complex overlying fundamental theory , as discussed in detail in ref .",
    "this `` anarchy solution '' ( henceforth called active anarchy ) has been successful , especially in light of the rather large reactor mixing angle @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "taking the various hints for sterile neutrinos seriously , it is of obvious interest to try to accommodate these states in models .",
    "while flavor symmetry models that include sterile neutrinos exist  @xcite , the counterframework of anarchy has not yet been discussed in the context of light sterile neutrinos in detail .",
    "this will be amended by the paper at hand . instead of simply adding two light sterile neutrinos to the three active ones ( which would not be successful in the context of anarchy due to the sizable mass hierarchy between the active and sterile neutrinos )",
    ", we will work in a much more economical scenario .",
    "namely , we assume that the sterile states are the right - handed neutrinos of the type - i seesaw mechanism ( ev - seesaw  @xcite ) . the most minimal case which can accommodate the active neutrino data is then when only two such states are added to the picture .",
    "( heavy seesaw ) right - handed neutrinos has been recently discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it has been found that the active neutrino mass hierarchy prefers small @xmath4 .",
    "] this implies two light sterile neutrinos , one massless active neutrino , no neutrinoless double beta decay and only a small effective electron neutrino mass .",
    "a phenomenological study of this straightforward scenario has recently been provided in ref .",
    "we will study the implications of anarchy in this framework and present the statistical distributions for all observables .",
    "we show that the large active  sterile mixing angles needed for various anomalies can be naturally obtained .",
    "thus , the economic and attractive scenario of anarchy can also be extended to the case of light sterile neutrinos  in particular the minimal two - neutrino ev - scale seesaw .",
    "two right - handed singlet neutrinos @xmath5 modify the sm lagrangian by the following terms : @xmath6 where sums over @xmath7 and @xmath8 are understood .",

    "we assume that the unitary @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) matrix @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) is distributed according to the haar measure of @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) , which can then be compared to the experimental values . or @xmath22 with haar - distributed @xmath23 , because our framework is by construction basis independent . ]",

    "@xcite for active anarchy , lies beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "note that this is the proper way of defining anarchy in the case of two right - handed neutrinos , even outside of the seesaw limit @xmath29 .",
    "taking for example the full mass matrix @xmath15 to be distributed according to @xmath30 ( as in ref .",
    "@xcite ) would make majorana masses for the @xmath31 necessary , for which we would have to introduce a scalar triplet ( type - ii seesaw ) , complicating the study considerably .",
    "additional mechanisms that decouple some heavy right - handed neutrinos or impose anarchy in only a subsector could also be constructed  @xcite , but we will only consider the minimal framework here .    in eq .",
    ", we have @xmath32 , and the only free parameters are the scales @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",

    "the other two masses and all the mixing angles and phases are then distributed in a known way and can be compared to measurements . defining the parameter @xmath38 , we can estimate the expected values of the observables : @xmath39 here , @xmath40 denotes the upper - left @xmath16 submatrix of @xmath14 ( corresponding to the pontecorvo ",

    "@xcite , does of course not change the qualitative discussion of this paper .",
    "we further note that the precision in the parameters associated with the sterile neutrinos is much weaker than it is for the active ones .",
    "let us emphasize that while the best - fit value for @xmath60 is somewhat larger than the anarchy prediction , this tension is alleviated once we consider e.g.  the @xmath54  c.l .  contour .",
    "for example , there seems to be an interesting region in parameter space @xmath61{ev^2}$ ] , @xmath62{ev^2}$ ]  @xcite that gives roughly @xmath63 , perfect for sterile anarchy .",
    "obviously , the agreement with standard @xmath64cdm cosmology worsens in this case due to the large sum of neutrino masses  @xcite .",

    "let us discuss the distribution of the mixing matrix @xmath14 .",
    "since we are not working in the seesaw limit , or in an effective theory , the upper - left @xmath16 submatrix @xmath40 is not distributed according to the haar measure of @xmath20 as in active anarchy  @xcite @xmath69 ( which would imply the same distribution for all @xmath70 , @xmath8 , @xmath71 ) , but shows small deviations . from the unitarity of @xmath14namely",

    "the diagonalization condition @xmath74related to the upper - left @xmath16 zero matrix in @xmath15then shows that mainly @xmath75 is suppressed ( due to @xmath76 ) .",

    "[ fig : mixing ] ( top ) , where we see that @xmath77 ( and therefore @xmath78 ) is still approximately distributed like in the seesaw limit , while @xmath75 is drawn to slightly smaller values .",

    "[ fig : mixing ] ) .",
    "the suppression of @xmath83 compared to @xmath84 is due to the mass hierarchy in @xmath25 , as the entries scale with @xmath85 and @xmath86 , respectively  @xcite .",
