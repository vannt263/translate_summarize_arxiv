    "helium ( he ) nanodroplets have been a focus of research of cluster physics and physical chemistry for more than twenty years .",
    "several review articles have been devoted to the various facets of the production , the fundamental properties , and applications of he nanodroplets  @xcite . today , he droplets",
    "are widely used as nanometer - sized cryo - matrices for spectroscopic studies of embedded molecules and complexes . however",
    ", their peculiar properties associated with their highly quantum nature resulting from their ultralow internal temperature of 380mk still pose us many riddles .",
    "one of the useful properties of he droplets is their ability to pick - up atoms and molecules they collide with on their travel through the molecular beam apparatus .",
    "these impurities , called ` dopants ' , are subsequently embedded into the droplet interior , or , in some cases , stick to the droplet surface . while dopant molecules are efficiently cooled internally to the droplet temperature , guest - host interactions between the molecules and the he droplet are extraordinarily weak as long as the dopants remain in their electronic ground state .",
    "this outstanding property of he droplets results from the extremely low polarizability of he as well as from the quantum liquid nature and the unique spectrum of elementary excitations of he droplets  @xcite .",
    "therefore , he nanodroplet isolation is a particularly well - suited technique when combined with microwave and infrared spectroscopy  @xcite .",
    "owing to the highly resolved absorption spectra of embedded molecules at very low temperature , he nanodroplets are commonly termed the `` ideal spectroscopic matrix ''  @xcite .",
    "however , this attribute is no longer generally justified when it comes to electronic spectroscopy , where electronically excited bound states as well as the ionization continuum is probed . for larger molecules , high resolution in electronic spectra",
    "can be achieved when the overall electronic configuration does not vastly alter , and when no significant geometric changes are induced @xcite . however , in particular for small molecules and open shell systems , upon electronic excitation or ionization , strong guest - host interactions set in which induce considerable spectroscopic line shifts and broadenings .",
    "the he droplets then turn from an inert substrate into a reactive environment which facilitates the formation of he containing neutral molecules ( `` exciplexes '' ) , ionic complexes ( `` snowballs '' ) , and even strongly ionized states of matter ( `` nanoplasmas '' ) .",
    "most atoms and molecules in their electronic ground state experience a weakly attractive interaction with he . as a result",
    ", these species are located in the interior of he droplets .",
    "electrons , however , are subject to short - range repulsion from he . as a consequence ,",
    "the interaction of a dopant atom or molecule with he usually becomes repulsive upon excitation into an excited electronic orbital which is spatially more extended than the ground state .",
    "hence , an excited dopant will be accelerated towards the surface and may eventually be expelled from the droplet . in certain cases , local dopant - he attraction and global repulsion coexist due to non - spherically symmetric dopant - he interactions . then dopant - he@xmath0 , @xmath1 exciplexes can form as ejected free molecules . upon ionization , strong attractive forces between the cation and he set in due to the electrostatic polarization of the he atoms surrounding the ion , which tend to drag the ion toward the droplet center to form a ion - he snowball .",
    "once relaxed inside the he droplet , the cation again desolvates and leaves the droplet upon laser - excitation .",
    "rydberg states of atoms and molecules , having extended electron orbits which may exceed the size of the he droplet , show the characteristics of either repulsive or attractive dopant - he interaction , depending on whether the repulsive electron - he or the attractive cation - he interaction dominates .    in these regimes of excitation or ionization of either the dopants or the he itself , a rich spectrum of new phenomena emerges which are subjects of ongoing research .",
    "new experimental approaches include ion imaging detection , time - resolved femtosecond pump - probe spectroscopy , as well as novel sources of energetic radiation using free - electron lasers and high - harmonics generation from ultrashort intense laser pulses .",
    "this overview article summarizes recent advances in the field of he nanodroplet spectroscopy involving the ionization of either the he droplet or the dopant or both by interaction with radiation .",
    "it is written from an experimentalist s perspective and , while we attempt to largely reference the relevant literature , it certainly is biased by our own research activities and personal tastes and may not cover all aspects and all the work that has been done .",
    "after briefly reviewing the fundamentals of generating beams of he nanodroplets ( sec .",
    "[ sec : generation ] ) , we start with a discussion of resonance - enhanced multiphoton ionization ( rempi ) spectroscopy of dopants attached to he nanodroplets in sec .  [",
    "sec : spectro ] .",
    "these studies extend the work on laser - induced fluorescence spectroscopy of he droplets doped mostly with alkali metal atoms and molecules . as an additional observable , photoion mass and charge spectra ( sec .",
    "[ sec : massspectra ] ) as well as photoelectron spectra ( sec .",
    "[ sec : pes ] ) reveal direct information about the reactivity of the droplet environment following excitation or ionization of dopants .",
    "detailed insights into the dynamics of the dopant - droplet complex initiated by laser - excitation or ionization are obtained from velocity map ion or electron imaging ( sec .",
    "[ sec : ionimaging ] ) .",
    "this technique has recently been applied to pure he droplets which are directly excited or ionized by extreme - ultraviolet ( euv ) radiation . the dynamic response of excited or ionized pure or doped he droplets",
    "is directly probed by femtosecond pump - probe photoionization experiments ( sec .",
    "[ sec : pp ] ) , which are now possible even in the euv spectral range ( sec .",
    "[ sec : euv ] ) . in the limit of intense laser pulses , the initial ionization of dopants inside",
    "he droplets can induce ionization of the whole he droplet in an avalanche - like process thereby creating a nanoplasma , which we discuss in the last section  [ sec : strongfield ] .",
    "he droplets of the bosonic isotope @xmath2he with sizes @xmath3 ranging from a few hundred up to a few million he atoms per droplet , which are typically used for spectroscopic measurements , are generated by supersonic expansion of he gas out of a small orifice of a cryogenic nozzle into vacuum .",
    "nowadays , both continuous and pulsed nozzles are commonly used .",
    "the process of he droplet formation is well understood and discussed in detail elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "depending on the expansion conditions ( he backing pressure @xmath4 , nozzle temperature @xmath5 , and nozzle diameter @xmath6 ) he droplets are generated in two different expansion regimes . in the so - called subcritical expansion ( typically @xmath7  k at @xmath8  bar , @xmath9  @xmath10 m ) he droplets form by condensation of the out flowing atomic he gas due to many - body collisions . during the aggregation process ,",
    "the newly formed he clusters release their binding energy by evaporating he atoms .",
    "as the he density gradually drops in the course of the expansion and collisions cease , the droplet temperature levels off to @xmath11  k within about @xmath12  s  @xcite .",
    "when cooling the nozzle further ( @xmath13  k ) , larger he droplets are generated by dispersing the beam of liquid he ejected out of the nozzle orifice .",
    "the distributions of he droplet sizes generated in these two regimes clearly differ from one another : subcritical expansion produces small droplets ( @xmath14 ) , generally referred to as `` nanodroplets '' due to their dimension in the nanometer range .",
    "since droplet formation in this regime is a statistical process the final he droplet sizes follow a broad log - normal distribution function with a half - width comparable to the most probable size .",
    "supercritical expansion generates droplets in the size range @xmath15  @xcite having a linear - exponential size distribution @xcite .",
    "when cooling the nozzle to @xmath16 k very large droplets ( @xmath17 ) with velocities as low as 15 ms@xmath18 emerge  @xcite . in this regime ,",
    "rayleigh instabilities break up the liquid he flow .",
    "absolute sizes have been measured by means of deflection of the droplets out of the beam in crossed molecular beam scattering experiments  @xcite or by attachment of electrons and deflection in electric fields  @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been shown that reliable information about the mean droplet sizes can be obtained from scattering with rare gases introduced into in a scattering cell ( `` titration '' ) and by comparing characteristic mass peaks recorded using a quadrupole mass spectrometer combined with electron - impact ionization  @xcite . in most spectroscopic experiments , where the density of isolated dopant atoms or molecules should be highest , the he droplet size is set to @xmath19 by operating at subcritical expansion conditions .",
    "large droplets generated in the supercritical expansion regime are useful when large dopant clusters are to be aggregated inside the droplets  @xcite , or when pure he droplets are probed directly , e.g. using euv radiation  @xcite",
    ".    pulsed cryogenic nozzles for generating he nanodroplets were first realized by modifying conventional commercial pulsed valves  @xcite . nowadays ,",
    "high - performance pulsed cryogenic nozzles are commercially available  @xcite .",
    "these pulsed valves are particularly advantageous for experiments using pulsed lasers operated at relatively low repetition rates ( @xmath20  khz ) . compared to a continuous droplet beam ,",
    "orders of magnitudes higher flux within the pulse have been reached . at the same time",
    ", the gas load is significantly reduced , which greatly relaxes the requirements for high pumping speeds at the vacuum chamber for the droplet source .",
    "pulse lengths have been determined to fall into the range 20-100  @xmath10s .",
    "however , when operating the nozzles at high repetition rates ( @xmath211  khz ) the increased gas load may again become a limiting factor and local heating of the nozzle due to the dissipation of electric power limits the minimal nozzle temperature @xmath5 . besides , due to velocity dispersion the temporal profile of droplet sizes within one pulse tends to be inhomogeneous  @xcite which might be advantageous or disadvantageous depending on the performed experiment .",
    "doping of he droplets is commonly achieved by inelastic collisions inside a scattering cell , termed as the pick - up technique  @xcite .",
    "the typical length of the scattering cell is a few centimeters . at a partial pressure of molecules in the cell of about 10@xmath22 pa the probability of singly doping he droplets of size",
    "@xmath23 is highest .",
    "depending on the material of interest , different techniques are suitable to provide the required vapor pressure in the scattering cell .",
    "gases or high vapor pressure liquids and solids samples are directly introduced through room temperature capillaries .",
    "sample temperatures exceeding 1500  k have been used for evaporating metals  @xcite .",
    "thermal radiation from the cell or the heaters does not affect the droplet beam since the lowest dipole active transitions in he are at photon energies @xmath24  ev . in the same way , a high temperature setup has been employed to dope with radicals by means of pyrolysis  @xcite . in that case ,",
    "an effusive continuous beam of radicals intersected the he droplet beam .",
    "laser evaporation has been established as an alternative way to produce doped he droplets by the authors  @xcite .",
    "the material is ablated from a rotating and translating rod by a pulsed infrared , visible or ultraviolet laser .",
    "the laser plasma is typically generated inside the he source chamber 1020 millimetres below the droplet beam near the nozzle .",
    "apparently the high density of he atoms accompanying the central part of the he droplet beam is needed for pre - cooling the hot atoms or molecules from the laser plasma . when using a nanosecond pulsed laser for evaporating the target material , the part of the he droplet beam with is doped arrives at the detector within a time interval of about 100  @xmath10s . in this way ,",
    "doping with refractory metals as well as with fragile bio - molecules was demonstrated  @xcite . since a significant part of the laser - induced plasma consists of charged particles",
    ", ions are also attached to the droplets  @xcite .",
    "the time - of - flight mass distributions of these ion - doped droplets revealed surprisingly large charged droplet distributions which suggest that the presence of charged particles enhances the condensation of droplets .",
    "recently we have successfully combined a laser ablation - based doping unit with a pulsed",
    "he droplet source .",
    "the collision energies ( velocities ) involved in the pick - up process are high compared to energies relevant for superfluid he ( landau critical velocity ) .",
    "thus , frictionless motion is not an issue and dopants are efficiently captured by the droplets .",
    "pick - up cross sections have been determined to be of the order of 50-90% of the total geometric cross section of the droplets  @xcite .",
    "all energy contributions released during the pick - up process ( collisional , binding of dopant to droplet , internal energy of dopant , dopant - dopant binding in the case of multiple doping ) are dissipated by evaporation of he atoms . as a rule of thumb ,",
    "@xmath25  cm@xmath18 of energy is emitted by evaporating 1 he atom .",
    "the pick - up of dopants is a statistical process which follows the poisson statistics in first approximation  @xcite .",
    "more realistic models include the initial he droplet size distribution , droplet shrinking and scattering during the pick - up process , and in the case of surface - bound dopants , the desorption of dopants off the droplets by evaporation  @xcite .",
    "most atomic and molecular species immerse into the droplet interior upon doping . due to the generally attractive dopant - he interactions ,",
    "local shell - like structures of enhanced he density around the dopants are formed . in extreme cases such as for some cations ,",
    "the he density may even surpass the one of solid he , in which case the dopant - he complexes are referred to as `` snowballs ''  @xcite .",
    "the solvation energy of neutral dopants in @xmath2he droplets ranges from about 50 up to about 800  k@xmath27 for ne and sf@xmath28 , respectively  @xcite , whereas that of cations reaches thousands of k@xmath27  @xcite . here",
    "@xmath29 denotes the boltzmann constant .    only neutral alkali and",
    "to some extent alkaline earth metals remain weakly bound to the droplet surface in dimple - like states as a result of the strong short - range repulsion of the valence electron from the surrounding he  @xcite . for these species ,",
    "the long - range van der waals attraction induces shallow surface states with binding energies of about 10 k@xmath27  @xcite .",
    "however , alkali clusters of sizes exceeding a critical value again submerge into the droplet interior  @xcite .",
    "the tendency of dopants to submerge into the droplets or to stay at the surface has been rationalized in terms of balancing the energy cost of creating a void cavity to accommodate the dopant , and the gain due to the presence of he atoms in the well of the dopant - he pair potential  @xcite .",
    "the first electronic spectra of dopants attached to he droplets had been introduced using laser - induced fluorescence ( lif ) detection of sodium - doped droplets @xcite .",
    "lif has proven to be the most sensitive method even for larger molecules having reasonable fluorescence quantum yields ( e.g.  acenes , dyes ) as compared to droplet beam depletion methods employing electron impact in combination with quadrupole mass filters or bolometers as detectors  @xcite .",
    "resonance enhanced multiphoton ionization ( rempi ) as an alternative detection scheme appears appealing , since it allows to record photoionization ( pi ) spectra separately for every fragment ion produced in the rempi process ( dopant monomer , oligomers , dopant - he complex , mixed chemical compounds , etc . ) .",
    "the combination of rempi spectroscopy with time - of - flight detection has the multiplexing advantage of measuring all fragment ion spectra at the same time .",
    "moreover , rempi spectroscopy does not rely on fluorescence emission by the excited dopants as lif does . hence , spectra and dynamics including non - radiative states can be addressed .",
    "however , ionized dopants immersed in he droplets in most cases do nt end up as bare dopant ions but remain bound to the he droplets or form complexes with a small number of he atoms . in this case , although the detection of the massive ions requires particular measures , spectra on the full - sized ion - doped he nanodroplets may provide useful information ( see section  [ sec : massspectra ] )  @xcite . alternatively , detecting photoelectron yields and spectra has proven to be a powerful technique when combined with rempi spectroscopy ( see section  [ sec : pes ] )  @xcite .",
    "finally , the ionization step generally requires higher energy ( uv ) photons which makes high demands as to the required laser systems .",
    "a new detection scheme for he nanodroplet isolation spectroscopy using rempi was recently demonstrated by m. drabbels and coworkers in lausanne  @xcite .",
    "the method relies on the complete evaporation of the droplets following excitation of dissolved molecules and the subsequent detection of the remaining unsolvated molecules by nonresonant photoionization using femtosecond laser pulses in combination with time - of - flight mass spectrometry .",
    "thus , the method combines the advantage of background - free signal detection with that of beam depletion spectroscopy , which is a sensitive technique to detect non - fluorescing states with ultrashort lifetimes .",
    "this detection scheme has been successfully applied to recording high - resolution electronic spectra of benzene , rotaxane , and of derivatives of the nucleobase adenine  @xcite .",
    "the obstacles mentioned above , which make sophisticated spectroscopies necessary , do not hold for alkali ( ak ) metal dopants ; that s why a large body of studies has been done for these systems .",
    "ak metals have extremely large absorption cross sections for transitions to the lowest excited states ( d@xmath30-lines ) which are easily accessible by near - infrared and visible lasers .",
    "in contrast to all other species which are immersed in the droplet interior upon doping , ak dopants reside in shallow dimple states at the droplet surface . upon electronic excitation ,",
    "ak atoms and small molecules tend to desorb off the surface of he droplets due to repulsive forces acting between the excited ak atom or molecule and the he droplet as a whole . a simplified representation of the state - dependent interaction of ak atoms with he nanodroplets is given by the `` pseudo - diatomic model '' , in which the ak dopant constitutes one atom and the entire he droplet the other  @xcite .",
    "this model provides a simple interpretation of the absorption spectra measured by laser - induced fluorescence emission or by rempi and of momentum distributions of desorbed ak atoms .",
    "the comprehensive characterization of ak absorption spectra  @xcite in the frame of the pseudo - diatomic model has revealed that all ak atoms experience repulsive interaction between them and the he nanodroplets in any excited electronic state , the only exceptions being the lowest excited states of rubidium ( rb ) and cesium ( cs )  @xcite .",
    "thus , rempi of ak atoms and small molecules attached to he nanodroplets generates neat atomic or molecular ions with high abundance .",
    "[ fig : cspispectrum ] displays the integral and product mass - resolved rempi spectrum of cs attached to he nanodroplets as a prototypical example for rempi spectra of metal atoms .",
    "the vertical lines indicate the atomic d@xmath31 and d@xmath32-transitions .",
    "the correlating spectral features of cs on he droplets are blue - shifted and broadened in the range @xmath33-@xmath34 cm@xmath18 as a result of the repulsive interaction of the excited cs atoms with the he droplet in the franck - condon region .",
    "the splitting of the feature around 11800 cm@xmath18 into two components derives from the existence of two projections of orbital angular momentum of the atomic 6p@xmath35-state with respect to the droplet surface , @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "while the integral rempi spectrum , which matches the lif spectrum , only bears information about the absorption cross section , the spectra recorded selectively for the masses of neat cs and of cshe provide additional information about the response of the system to photoexcitation , the formation of cshe complexes .",
    "these so called `` exciplexes '' are characterized by only having bound vibrational states as long as the complex is electronically excited . upon spontaneous decay into the electronic ground state the exciplex decomposes .",
    "accordingly , cshe exciplexes preferentially form upon excitation of the @xmath36-component , which can be viewed as a cs p - orbital lying flat on the surface such that a he atom can easily attach to the nodal plane as a result of attractive cs - he pair - interaction .",
    "more generally , while excited ak atoms mostly interact repulsively with a he nanodroplet as a whole , many excited states experience pair - wise attraction between the excited ak@xmath38 atom and one individual he atom . therefore , as the ak@xmath38 atom is repelled from the droplet surface a bound ak@xmath38he molecule or in some cases small ak@xmath38he@xmath0 , @xmath39 complexes can form simultaneously .",
    "alkali - he exciplexes formed on he nanodroplets have been extensively studied spectroscopically and more recently by means of time - resolved rempi mass spectrometry ( see section  [ sec : pp ] ) and ion imaging techniques ( see section  [ sec : ionimaging ] )  @xcite .",
    "akhe exciplexes are believed to form by two different mechanisms .",
    "on the one hand , excitation of the lowest - lying p@xmath40 and p@xmath35-levels prepares the ak and the nearest he atom in a state where the two atoms are initially separated by a potential energy barrier  @xcite .",
    "akhe association can only occur by a tunneling process .",
    "subsequent desorption of the akhe exciplex is driven by repulsive forces acting between the exciplex and the whole droplet and possibly by vibrational relaxation of the akhe molecule which induced its evaporation off droplet surface  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , higher - lying ak states often feature extended attractive wells in the akhe pair - potentials . in that case , bound vibrational states can directly be populated in a process akin to photoassociation  @xcite .",
    "these two formation schemes can be distinguished by measuring velocity distributions of the desorbing akhe exciplex ( isotropic vs.  anisotropic )  @xcite or formation times ( time - delayed vs.  instantaneous ) .    recently , the ak - doped he nanodroplets excited into high rydberg states of the ak adatom were studied by m. drabbels and coworkers in lausanne and by w. ernst and coworkers in graz .",
    "these studies were motivated by the question whether such an exotic rydberg system consisting of a he droplet with a charged core at the center and a rydberg electron orbiting outside the droplet can be stable .",
    "the stabilization of such a `` superatom '' could result from the @xmath41 ev potential barrier for electron penetration into liquid he , as theoretically predicted  @xcite .",
    "however , in a more recent theoretical study , ancilotto _ et al .",
    "_ questioned the stability of such a system arguing that the electron orbiting outside the droplet may pull the positive ionic core close enough to the surface that fast electron - ion recombination occurs  @xcite .",
    "rempi spectra , photoelectron and zeke measurements revealed clearly resolved rydberg series of broadened peaks up to principal quantum numbers @xmath42 in the absorption spectra of na , rb and cs attached to he droplets  @xcite . while lifetimes shorter than the laser pulse ( @xmath43 ns ) were inferred for na rydberg states with @xmath44 , lifetimes @xmath45s were measured for states with @xmath46 .",
    "since these are still significantly shorter than the lifetimes of equivalent states in the free na atom , these observations seem to support the suggestion that the lifetime of rydberg states of the he droplets is governed by electron - ion recombination  @xcite .",
    "all cs rydberg lines were found to evolve from blue - shifted for @xmath47 to red - shifted for higher levels , indicating the transition from repulse to attractive cs@xmath38-he@xmath48 interaction  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the transition occurs for values of @xmath49 , where the orbital radii @xmath50 become comparable to the mean radius of the he droplets @xmath51 nm .",
    "this supports the simple conception that for @xmath52 , the rydberg electron penetrates into the droplet and therefore the interaction is repulsive , whereas for @xmath53 the electron orbits the cs@xmath54-he@xmath48 cluster core and the interaction is dominated by the cs@xmath54-he@xmath48 attraction .",
    "the rydberg line positions where found to be well reproduced by a modified rydberg formula @xmath55 where @xmath56 denotes the ionization energy of the cshe@xmath48 complex and @xmath57 is the quantum defect consisting of the atomic term @xmath58 and an @xmath59-state dependent constant addend @xmath60 which accounts for the perturbation by the he droplet  @xcite . @xmath61 ev is the rydberg constant .",
    "the ionization energy @xmath56 was found to be lowered with respect to the gas - phase value by about 120 cm@xmath18 for na .",
    "this shift matches the calculated one based on franck - condon factors for the ionizing transition from the neutral to the cationic nahe@xmath48 complex  @xcite .",
    "as mentioned above , only rb and cs excited close to their atomic d@xmath31-lines remain bound to the he droplets .",
    "this has been exploited for exciting rb and cs into rydberg states .",
    "besides that , the non - desorbing lowest p@xmath40-states of rb and cs were used as springboards for characterizing the ionization thresholds as a function of the he droplet size .",
    "ionization energies were found to be lowered compared to the free atoms as for the na case .",
    "the energy shift increases when going from heavy to light ak atoms and from small to large he droplets due to the difference in polarization energies associated with the submerged ak metal cations  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , is was shown that large rbhe@xmath0 and cshe@xmath0 snowballs are formed by resonant two - photon ionization of rb and cs via the lowest p@xmath40-states due to the creation of rb@xmath54 and cs@xmath54 cations at the droplet surface which subsequently submerge into the droplet interior  @xcite .",
    "recently , the alkaline - earth metal atom barium ( ba ) , which is thought to reside in a dimple at the droplet surface somewhat deeper than ak atoms  @xcite , was studied using various spectroscopic techniques  @xcite . as for ak metals ,",
    "a cross - over from blue to red - shifting of the absorption lines with increasing principal quantum number was observed as well as a lowering of the ionization threshold .",
    "previous lif measurements of ak molecules formed by aggregation of atoms on the surface of he droplets have been complemented by rempi studies of lics and nacs  @xcite , cs@xmath32  @xcite , and li@xmath32  @xcite .",
    "recently , absorption spectra of the mixed ak - alkaline - earth dimer lica were reported  @xcite . due to the weak binding of these species to the droplets ,",
    "weakly bound ak molecules in high - spin configurations tend to be enriched  @xcite .",
    "since the binding energy of the dopant complex is dissipated by evaporation , a high energy input tends to boil off the dopant itself thus filtering out those complexes with low binding energy .",
    "therefore , the mentioned studies addressed ak dimers in triplet states .",
    "due to their binding to the he droplets in a configuration where the molecular axis lies parallel to the surface , the coupling to the he is stronger than for singlet molecules which stand perpendicular on the droplet surface  @xcite . as a result",
    ", the vibrational lines are asymmetrically broadened towards higher energies with respect to the unperturbed transition frequencies by @xmath62 cm@xmath18 . besides",
    ", the zero - phonon line which is observed in the spectra of singlet dimers is absent in the spectra of triplet dimers  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the low - energy edges of the vibrational lines were found to match the expected line positions within a precision of a few cm@xmath18  @xcite .",
    "the first non - alkali rempi spectra were measured for embedded silver ( ag ) clusters @xcite .",
    "the observed spectra of ag dimers and trimers exhibit strongly broadened and shifted transitions .",
    "in general , for larger clusters one does not expect highly resolved rempi spectra because of the collective plasmon character of metallic clusters with corresponding lifetimes much shorter compared to the nanosecond laser pulse .",
    "nevertheless , a narrow ( 56mev in widths ) resonance of the silver octamer was observed indicating an excited state lifetime in the nanosecond range . when probing the ag dopant monomers inside he",
    "droplets , the authors could for the first time measure highly resolved rydberg series of ag ( principle quantum numbers @xmath6320 - 60 ) . their appearance gives first evidence for the migration of excited impurities towards the surface of the he droplet within the duration of the nanosecond laser pulse  @xcite .",
    "a more detailed study of ag atoms embedded in he nanodroplets using electron and ion imaging spectroscopy by m. drabbels and coworkers is described in section  [ sec : pes ] .",
    "recently w. ernst and coworkers have started to investigate the formation and the deposition on surfaces of transition metal clusters aggregated inside he nanodroplets . in this context , chromium ( cr ) and copper ( cu ) atoms embedded in he droplets were studied by means of rempi spectroscopy  @xcite .",
    "the main outcome of that work has been that absorption lines are broadened and shifted by hundreds of cm@xmath18 indicating that the dopants are located inside the droplets .",
    "the presence of sharp lines in the rempi spectra showed that excited cr and cu atoms are ejected out of the droplets and are subsequently ionized via resonant transitions or autoionizing states within the same laser pulse .",
    "this observation is in line with previous dispersed lif measurements revealing highly resolved emission spectra  @xcite .",
    "as previously observed for ak and alkaline - earth metals as well as for ag , the he droplet environment induces fast electronic relaxation of the laser - excited cr atoms into various low - lying levels including different spin - states .",
    "surprisingly , the formation of the crhe complex involving ground state he is observed , which is expected to be extremely weakly bound  @xcite .",
    "a peculiar property of mass spectrometry of doped he droplet either by electron impact or by pi is the high abundance of bare dopant masses . when ionization proceeds with a large amount of excess energy the he droplets largely decompose and ions are expelled without having he attached despite of switching to the more attractive short - range ion - he interaction .",
    "electron - impact ionization of embedded species generally proceeds as a two - step process where first a he atoms is ionized and then the charge is transfered to the dopant .",
    "thus , a large amount of energy ( 320  ev ) is deposited in the he droplet .",
    "only when a dopant is ionized by pi close to the ionization threshold the remaining photoion tends to sink into the droplet interior .",
    "however , a conclusive understanding of the droplet response to dopant ionization is still lacking .",
    "fragmentation of molecular dopants upon ionization has been found not to be significantly suppressed by the he environment  @xcite . however , additional doping with water molecules can efficiently buffer the fragmentation of fragile molecules . over the last years , extensive analysis of mass spectra of doped",
    "he droplets has been carried out in the group of paul scheier in innsbruck .",
    "recent studies include larger molecules  @xcite , molecular clusters  @xcite , mixed doping @xcite and snowball formation analysis  @xcite .",

    "( c ) mass progression associated with compound clusters containing three cs atoms . adapted from  @xcite.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "atomic ions are usually accompanied by he progressions in the mass spectra due to the formation of so - called _ snowballs _ , shells of he atoms surrounding the ion core which have densities comparable to solid he , see fig .",
