    "relaxation and decoherence in a two state system coupled to environment is a fundamental problem of quantum physics .",
    "it was intensively studied in the past ; see , e.g. , the review of leggett _ et al . _ @xcite . in the last years",
    "the interest to this problem has been revived by the effort to build solid state qubits .",
    "recently , symmetry implications have been considered for the problem of a particle in a rigid double - well potential embedded in a solid @xcite .",
    "it was demonstrated that symmetry arguments allow one to obtain parameter - free lower bound on the relaxation of quantum oscillations in a rigid double well , caused by the elastic environment .",
    "one of the arguments is that the double - well potential formed by the local arrangement of atoms in a solid is defined in the coordinate frame of that local atomic environment , not in the laboratory frame .",
    "another argument is that interactions of the tunneling variable with phonons must be invariant with respect to global translations and rotations .",
    "when these arguments were taken into account , a simple universal result for the relaxation rate was obtained @xcite in terms of measurable constants of the solid , with no unknown interaction constants .",
    "the above mentioned universal result refers to the low temperature limit when the relaxation of a two state system is dominated by the decay of the excited state due to the emission of one phonon . in this paper",
    "we extend the method developed in ref . to the study of two - phonon raman processes in double - well structures @xcite .",
    "such processes can dominate relaxation at higher temperatures @xcite",
    ". we will show that in the temperature range bounded by the level splitting from below and by the debye temperature from above , the rate of the raman process for a biased rigid double well is given by a universal expression , very much like the rate of the direct one - phonon process .",
    "the raman rate is proportional to the seventh power of temperature , while the one - phonon rate is linear on temperature .",
    "interestingly , however , at small bias , the raman rate , unlike the one - phonon rate , is proportional to the square of the bias .",
    "consequently raman processes can be switched on and off by controlling the bias .",
    "this universal result , which is a consequence of the parity of quantum states , must have important implications for solid - state qubits at elevated temperatures .",
    "indeed , for an electron in a quantum dot , the rate of a direct one - phonon process is usually small . if the rate of a two - phonon process can be made small as well , this means that one can eliminate phonons as a significant source of relaxation and decoherence of the electron states in solid - state qubits .",
    "throughout this paper we shall use units where @xmath0 unless stated otherwise . in the absence of phonons ,",
    "the hamiltonian in the laboratory frame is @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the radius vector , @xmath3 is the momentum , and @xmath4 is the mass of the particle ( e.g. , electron ) . a long - wave phonon described by the displacement field @xmath5 translates the rigid double well in space .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system ( including the free phonon field ) in the laboratory frame becomes @xmath6 here , @xmath7 is the hamiltonian of the free phonon field .",
    "we intend to obtain a hamiltonian of the form @xmath8 where the last term describes the interaction of phonons with the electron in the double well potential . using the fact that @xmath9 is small",
    ", one can expand @xmath10 in taylor series to obtain @xmath11 the first three terms form the interaction - free part of the total hamiltonian .",
    "the rest of the terms containing powers of @xmath9 comprise the electron phonon interaction .",
    "it is clear that eq .",
    "( [ taylor exp .-",

    "one can , however , obtain eq .",
    "( [ elect - phonon hamilt.1 ] ) by performing a unitary transformation on eq .",

    "( [ baker - hausdorf ] ) that we are going to employ allows one to obtain parameter - free results solely in terms of the energy levels of our effective two - state system without knowledge of the explicit form of @xmath15 .",
    "we consider the case in which the particle , with good accuracy , is localized near @xmath16 , where @xmath17 are the energy minima of the left or right wells . without loss of generality",
    "we assume that @xmath18 .",
    "the localization length of the state inside each well is small compared to the distance between the minima of the double - well potential .",
    "the bare ground states ( when tunneling is neglected ) in the left and right wells , that we denote by @xmath19 , are approximately orthonormal , @xmath20 the tunneling between the wells leads to the hybridization of the states given by orthonormal wave functions @xmath21 where @xmath22 with @xmath23 being the tunnel splitting in the unbiased double well and @xmath24 being the energy bias between the wells .",
    "note that the double well also has states , @xmath25 , with energies , @xmath26 , other then @xmath27 corresponding to @xmath28 .",

    "( 18,3.5 )    the raman rate can be computed with the help of the fermi golden rule in the second order in the interaction .",

    "( [ gamma - r ] ) .",
    "the raman rate for @xmath131 then becomes @xmath132 where we have introduced characteristic energy and frequency scales @xmath133 of the problem that are entirely determined by the parameters of the unperturbed dot and its elastic environment .",

    "two - phonon processes may dominate relaxation at elevated temperatures ( see below ) .",
    "an interesting observation , however , is that at a small bias the rate of eq .",
    "( [ raman - final ] ) is proportional to @xmath144 , while at a large bias it becomes independent of @xmath145 .",
    "this means that one can switch raman processes on and off by controlling the bias .",
