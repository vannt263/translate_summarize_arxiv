    "in spite of the success of the local density approximation ( lda)@xcite and the generalized gradient approximations ( gga)@xcite for the exchange - correlation ( xc ) part of the total energy in the density functional theory ( dft)@xcite , it is observed that in some cases these approximations lead to qualitatively incorrect results . on the other hand , appropriate self - interaction corrected versions of these approximations",
    "are observed@xcite to lead to correct behaviors .",
    "these observations motivate one to use functionals in which the self - interaction contribution is removed exactly .",
    "one of the functionals which satisfies this constraint is the exact exchange energy functional . using the exact exchange functional leads to the correct asymptotic behavior of the kohn - sham ( ks ) potential as well as to correct results for the high - density limit in which the exchange energy is dominated . given an orbital - dependent exchange functional , one should solve the optimized effective potential ( oep ) integral equation@xcite to obtain the local exchange potential which is used in the ks equations .",
    "application of this integral equation to three dimensional systems @xcite needs considerable technicalities and has some limitations .",
    "recently , kmmel and perdew @xcite proposed an iterative method which allows one to solve the oep integral equation accurately and efficiently .",
    "in this work , using the exact - exchange oep method , we have obtained the ground state properties of simple neutral @xmath0-electron metal clusters of al , li , na , k , and cs with closed - shell configurations corresponding to @xmath0= 2 , 8 , 18 , 20 , 34 , and 40 ( for al , only @xmath1 corresponds to real al cluster with 6 atoms ) .",
    "however , it is a well - known fact that the properties of alkali metals are dominantly determined by the delocalized valence electrons . in these metals ,",
    "the fermi wavelengths of the valence electrons are much larger than the metal lattice constants and the pseudopotentials of the ions do not significantly affect the electronic structure .",
    "this fact allows one to replace the discrete ionic structure by a homogeneous positive charge background which is called jellium model ( jm ) . for closed - shell clusters ,",
    "the spherical geometry is an appropriate assumption @xcite and therefore , we apply the jm to metal clusters by replacing the ions of an @xmath0-atom cluster with a sphere of uniform positive charge density and radius @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the valence of the atom and @xmath4 is the bulk value of the wigner - seitz ( ws ) radius for valence electrons . for al ,",

    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we explain the calculational schemes .",
    "section [ sec3 ] is devoted to the results of our calculations and finally , we conclude this work in section [ sec4 ] .",
    "in the jm , the total energy of a cluster with exact exchange is given by @xmath5=t_s[n_\\uparrow , n_\\downarrow]+     e_x[n_\\uparrow , n_\\downarrow]\\\\     + \\frac{1}{2}\\int d\\rr\\;\\phi([n , n_+];\\rr)\\,[n(\\rr)-n_+(\\rr)],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in which @xmath6 and @xmath7;\\rr)=2\\int    d\\rrp\\frac{[n(\\rrp)-n_+(\\rrp)]}{\\mid\\rr-\\rrp\\mid}.\\ ] ]    here , the background charge density is given by @xmath8 and @xmath9 is calculated from    @xmath10    where @xmath11 are the ks orbitals obtained from the self - consistent solutions of the set of equations @xmath12 in eq.([eq6 ] ) , @xmath13 @xmath14 @xmath15 all equations throughout this paper are expressed in rydberg atomic units .    to solve the ks equations , one should first calculate the local exchange potential from the exchange energy functional .",
    "this is done via the solution of the oep integral equation .",
    "recently , kmmel and perdew@xcite in a simple and elegant way have proved that the oep integral equation is equivalent to the equation @xmath16 in which @xmath17 are the self - consistent ks orbitals and @xmath18 are orbital shifts which are obtained from the solution of the following inhomogeneous ks equations @xmath19 with @xmath20\\phi_{i\\sigma}^*(\\rr).\\ ] ]    @xmath21 are the ks eigenvalues which satisfy eq .",

    ". then we solve eq .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) to obtain the orbital shifts @xmath18 . in the next step ,",
    "we calculate the quantity @xmath26 the deviation of which from zero is a measure for the deviation from the self - consistency of the oep - ks orbitals .",
    "this quantity is used to construct a better exchange potential from @xmath27    with this @xmath28 and keeping the ks eigenvalues and orbitals fixed , we repeat the solution of the eq .",
