    "topological defects occur in many topics of field theory , cosmology and condensed matter physics .",
    "there is a particular interest to study models with additional nonabelian internal degrees of freedom localized on solitons ( domain walls , strings , monopoles etc . ) , see @xcite .",
    "the next possible step is to consider theories containing solitons on solitons ( as in @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we study q - lumps on domain wall ( see similar construction in @xcite , full numerical solution in @xcite and generalization to higher dimension in @xcite ) .",
    "q - lumps are q - ball type solutions of nonlinear o(3 )  @xmath0-model with an additional potential term of some special form .",
    "they were discovered by r.  leese @xcite and have nontrivial topological charge in addition to the nonzero conserved noether charges .",
    "properties of such configurations differ significantly from those of pure @xmath0-model solution even when coupling constant is small , e.g. in case of small perturbation to the action , that may be important from physical point of view as every physical system is unlikely to contain no perturbation at all .",
    "the main result of r.  leese was that he first managed to obtain explicit solutions to o(3 )  @xmath0-model with a particular potential term and to investigate stability and scattering effects of them , later the mechanism of building of such configurations was generalized to arbitrary @xmath0-models by e.  abraham @xcite .",
    "one special feature of q - lumps is that the model admits stationary manysoliton solutions that can be interpret as non - interacting particle ( relevant to initially motionless configuration ) . in this paper",
    "we investigate whether and what interaction appears if one adds spin - orbit interaction term in the bulk ( as in @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "the main body of the paper looks at the interaction of two q - lumps on a domain wall .",
    "2 presents the model we deal with and introduces all the objects ( the wall , q - lumps , spin - orbit interaction term ) in details .",
    "3 investigates interaction effects perturbatively and through adiabatic approximation , finally , effects found are outlined in sect .",
    "the theory considered includes scalar fields @xmath1 and @xmath2 in 3 + 1dimensional spacetime and admits domain wall with additional nonabelian internal degrees of freedom localized on it .",
    "lagrangian of the theory is @xmath3 to build a domain wall let us look for solutions with separated variables @xmath4 , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 , and fields @xmath7 correspond to o(3 )  @xmath0-model .",
    "thus the lagrangian takes form @xmath8 where @xmath9 , differentiation over @xmath10 is denoted by prime and @xmath11 motion equations derived from action ( [ larg0 ] ) are : @xmath12      the model with lagrangian ( [ lagr ] ) in three - dimensional spacetime was studied in detail by robert leese in paper @xcite : he managed to find explicit form of solitonic solutions having both topological and noether charges related respectively to homotopic group @xmath13 and to internal rotation with constant velocity around @xmath14 ( one can notice that potential term breaks o(3 ) symmetry of the model to o(2 ) ) .",
    "these solitons were named `` q - lumps '' ( by analogy with s.  coleman s `` q - balls '' @xcite ) .",
    "they are not forbidden by derrick s theorem ( e.g. @xcite ) as they are not static and are stabilized by charge .",
    "let s write them and their properties explicitly .    for convenience",
    "we introduce complex scalar fields @xmath15 , @xmath16 instead of @xmath7 through stereographic projection : @xmath17 , then @xmath18 topological and noether charges and total energy of configuration look like @xmath19d^2x=\\frac{i}{2 \\pi}\\int \\frac{\\partial_x u^*\\partial_y u-\\partial_x u\\partial_y u^*}{(1+u u^*)^2 } d^2x , \\\\ & q = \\int \\frac{1}{2}(s_2 \\partial_t s_1 - s_1 \\partial_t s_2 ) d^2x = i \\int \\frac{u^ * \\partial_t u - u\\partial_t u^*}{(1+u u^*)^2 } d^2x,\\\\ & \\mathcal{e}_{lump}=\\int \\frac{\\partial_t u \\partial_t u^*+ \\partial_i u \\partial_i u^*+\\alpha^2 u u^ * } { ( 1+u u^*)^2 } d^2x\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and are linked by bogomolny bound @xmath20 thus configurations saturating bogomolny bound have minimal energy among solutions with given charges and are classically stable because of charge conservation",
    ". conditions of saturations are : @xmath21 and that immediately gives explicit form of solutions : @xmath22 here function @xmath23 must be ( anti-)rational for energy to be finite . in that case degree of the function",
    "gives topological charge @xmath24 of configuration , whereas noether charge @xmath25 takes finite value when @xmath26 .",
    "for instance , ansatz @xmath27 corresponds to radially symmetric soliton of topological charge @xmath28 , while @xmath29 includes all solutions with top .",
    "configurations having several distant poles could be interpret as manyparticle solutions and one can study scattering processes on moduli space in the limit of low energies , e.g. papers @xcite , @xcite considering scattering of monopoles and vortices , and in particular @xcite and @xcite about solitons of o(3 )  @xmath0-model .",
    "term @xmath30 allows to construct static domain wall of fields @xmath31 and @xmath32 : firstly one can see that in case of @xmath33 motion equation ( [ phieq ] ) for field @xmath31 has ordinary kink solution @xmath34 , but such a configuration is unstable ( @xcite ) .",
    "the stable one has nonzero expectation value @xmath35 inside domain wall ( i.e. around @xmath36 ) .",
    "profiles of functions @xmath31 , @xmath32 shown in fig",
    ".

    "now we add spin - orbit interaction in the bulk ( for more detail about its origin see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "it breaks lorentz - invariance of lagrangian , leads to entanglement between fields @xmath39 and coordinates and is effectively described by term @xmath40 or , in case of separated variables , @xmath41 , @xmath42 where @xmath43 to obtain effective action for theory on the wall in presence of this term one should integrate ( [ larg0 ] )  +  ( [ so ] ) over @xmath10 . then in 2 + 1 dimensions we get @xmath44 where constant values @xmath45 are introduced and in case of symmetric wall ( function @xmath32 ) @xmath46 after division by a constant @xmath47 and up to a constant term @xmath48 thereby , of the three terms in ( [ so ] ) the first one leads to the correction of @xmath49 @xmath50 the second one vanishes due to the symmetry and only the third one can significantly influence the system .",
    "to find interaction effects let s consider two - particle solution of non - perturbated theory ( without spin - orbit interaction ) .",
    "two - particle configurations correspond to solutions of topological charge 2 : @xmath51 here complex parameters @xmath52 and @xmath53 give size of particles @xmath54 and distance between them @xmath55 .      here",
    "we look for correction to ansatz ( [ nonper ] ) by perturbation theory assuming coupling @xmath56 to be small .",
    "to simplify calculations let s assume parameters @xmath57 , this corresponds to poles lying on axis  @xmath58 .",
    "equation for the first correction looks like @xmath59 where @xmath60 in case of distant particles ( @xmath61 ) one can expand the equation in powers of @xmath62 , that in the leading order leads to @xmath63 and gives asymptotes of the first correction at the spatial infinity , i.e. far from lumps : @xmath64 it is necessary to notice some peculiarities of the correction found : firstly , it breaks analyticity of the solution ; secondly , the phase rotates in the opposite direction ; and finally one can see linear growth with time , that means size increase .",
    "now we say parameters ( moduli ) @xmath65 , @xmath66 of ansatz ( [ nonper ] ) slowly depend on time .",
    "then effective action for such a four - dimensional dynamical system after integrating over @xmath67 , @xmath58 takes the following form ( here and below we denote @xmath68 just as @xmath49 ; moreover in the very ansatz we include rotation with constant velocity @xmath68 into the definition of @xmath69 ) : @xmath70 where @xmath71 and functions @xmath72 , @xmath73 are complete elliptical integrals of the first and of the second kind respectively .",
    "this way we obtain explicit form of motion equations : @xmath74 @xmath75 where @xmath76 equations ( [ gequation])([pequation ] ) can be solved numerically .",
    "then @xmath77 give initial configuration , @xmath78 , @xmath79  a small perturbation .",
    "in our case @xmath80 , @xmath81 .",
    "equations were solved using runge - kutta 4th order method for following parameter values : couplings @xmath82 , @xmath83 , lumps size @xmath84 , distance between lumps @xmath85 .",
    "integrals @xmath86-@xmath87 were also calculated numerically .",
    "several effects of spin - orbit interaction on two - particle solution were discovered .    1 .",
    "size increase : this effect is in good correspondence to the growth found with perturbation theory .",
    "+    2 .   attraction : distance between particles declines , that was not seen from correction ( [ correction ] ) . the fact , however , is due to expression ( [ correction ] ) gives only asymptotes at spatial infinity , which remain the same .",
    "+    3 .   dependence on phases : figures  [ size ] ,  [ distance ] show numerical solutions for two choice of parameter @xmath88 and @xmath89 that determine initial positions of q - lumps .",
    "the first one corresponds to particles lying on the real axis , the second one  on the imaginary one .",
    "while system behaviour remains qualitatively the same , one can notice that velocities of processes depend significantly on the parameter .",
    "thus in contrast to functions ( [ f])-([h ] ) not depending on phases @xmath90 , @xmath91 and allowing to consider just functions @xmath92 , @xmath93 in absence of spin - orbit interaction ( in case of the same initial @xmath94 , @xmath95 ) , addition of @xmath96 results in appearance of such a dependence . in fig .  [ profilepicture ] one can see how potential @xmath97 depends on phases : indeed for every fixed @xmath90 , @xmath91 profile @xmath97 qualitatively remains the same and results in growth and attraction of particles .",
    "in this paper we considered o(3 )  @xmath0-model with an additional potential term on domain wall in 3 + 1dimensional spacetime admiting solitonic solutions ( q - lumps ) .",
    "effects caused by spin - orbit interaction in the bulk on two - particle solutions were studied .",
    "asymptotic behaviour at spatial infinity of first corrections to two - particle ansatz was found perturbatively ; evolution of initially motionless configuration was numerically studied through adiabatic approximation .",
    "we discovered that in presence of spin - orbit interaction q - lumps begin to interact : they grow and attract ; also entanglement between internal degrees of freedom and coordinates leads to dependence on phases of configuration .",
    "one important feature of q - lumps in ( 2 + 1 ) discovered by leese was that the additional term , which significantly change behaviour of the system , can be treated as just external perturbation .",
    "the interaction effects outlined in sect .",
    "4 suggest that another perturbation to the action in media ( in bulk ) can `` break '' some properties of leese s non - interacting lumps living on the ( 2 + 1 ) dimensional wall , and all this happens even when taking small both couplings .",
    "the author is grateful to a.  gorsky for suggesting the problem and for numerous inspirational discussions and also would like to thank k.  pavlenko for valuable comments ."
