    "problems involving nonlinear differential equations arise in a variety of models for real world problems . even finding _ approximate _",
    "solutions for nonlinear differential equations remains a challenge . in the previous work @xcite",
    "we have established a technique based on sparse semidefinite programming ( sdp ) relaxations to construct discrete approximations for solutions of systems of nonlinear differential equations . in this paper",
    "we present a novel approach to obtain smooth approximations for solutions of differential equations and of problems involving differential equations such as optimal control problems .",

    "our contribution in this paper is primarily concerned with _ nonlinear _ differential equations and _ nonlinear _ optimal control problems . in a first step ,",
    "we take advantage of the discrete approximations provided by the sdp relaxation method in @xcite to compute a finite set of moments for an appropriately defined measure with discrete support .",
    "next , an approximation for the solution of the differential equation is obtained in closed form by maximum entropy estimation , using the moments of the discrete measure . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", it seems to be the first attempt to apply maximum entropy estimation to obtain smooth approximations for solutions of linear and nonlinear differential equations .",
    "finally , if maximum entropy estimation does guarantee some weak convergence of the estimate to the true solution as the number of moments increases , it does not guarantee _ pointwise _ convergence on the entire domain of the differential equation .",
    "however , as our preliminary results show for different linear and nonlinear differential equations and optimal control problems , accurate pointwise approximations can be achieved on certain regions of the domain .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section [ secsdpr ]",
    "we briefly recall the sparse sdp relaxations method for solving nonlinear differential equations numerically , which is the basis for our technique . in section [ secmaxentropy ]",
    "we introduce the method of maximum entropy estimation .",
    "our technique to compute smooth approximations for the solutions of ordinary differential equations ( ode ) , partial differential equations ( pde ) and optimal control problems ( ocp ) , which combines the methods from section [ secsdpr ] and [ secmaxentropy ] , is presented in section [ secsmooth ] .",
    "finally , preliminary numerical results for this method are reported in section [ secnumexp ] .",
    "in this section we recall the approach to compute discrete approximations for solutions to systems of differential equations with polynomial data presented in @xcite .",
    "in this paper we consider bidimensional differential equation problems of the following type @xmath0 with @xmath1\\times [ y_{\\min},y_{\\max } ] \\subset \\mathbb{r}^2 $ ] , @xmath2 , @xmath3 smooth functions , @xmath4 and @xmath5 differential operators , @xmath6 operator , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are polynomial in the function @xmath10 and its derivatives for some function space @xmath11 , with @xmath12 the banach space of integrable functions on @xmath13 , and @xmath14 bounds for the function values of @xmath15 . even if lower and upper bounds are not given by the problem directly , we need to impose them , since they are crucial for numerical stability of our method . if little is known about the solutions of ( [ pdeproblem ] ) , loose lower and upper bounds are to be imposed .    in a first step of the sparse semidefinite programming relaxation ( sdpr )",
    "method for solving differential equations , we transform an ode or a pde of form ( [ pdeproblem ] ) into a polynomial optimization problem ( pop ) .",
    "we then discretize the rectangular domain @xmath13 by @xmath16 ( one - dimensional case ) or @xmath17 ( two - dimensional case ) grid points , approximate the derivates by standard finite differences , for instance @xmath18 , where @xmath19 , and denote the discretized differential operators at some interior grid point @xmath20 and boundary grid point @xmath21 as @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively . finally , we take the discretization of the problem ( [ pdeproblem ] ) as a system of constraints , choose some objective function @xmath24 which needs to be polynomial in @xmath15 , i.e. @xmath25 $ ] , and obtain the following optimization problem @xmath26 which , since all functions are polynomial in the variable @xmath27 , is a pop . in the case of an ocp",
    "the objective function @xmath24 is given by the discretization of the optimal value function .",
    "in the case of a differential equation with several solutions we can pick a specific solution by choosing an appropriate objective function . a particular choice for the objective function may be motivated by the underlying problem , such as energy functionals in physics .",
    "problem ( [ discretizedpdepop ] ) is of the form : @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 . as mentioned above , the dimension of this pop is @xmath32 ( or @xmath33 in the one - dimensional case ) .",
    "but due to the structure of the finite difference discretization only a small number of the @xmath34 components of @xmath15 occurs in each constraint or in each monomial of the objective function of ( [ discretizedpdepop ] ) .",
    "thus , the pops derived from nonlinear differential equations are sparse .",
    "a systematic way of characterizing the structured sparsity of a pop has been introduced in @xcite , and this structured sparsity is exploited by the _",
    "sparse sdp relaxations _ constructed in @xcite . for the pop ( [ genpop ] )",
    "one obtains the sparse sdp relaxations : @xmath35 where @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 is the set of subsets of @xmath39 derived from the correlative sparsity pattern matrix of the pop @xcite , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the partial moments and localizing matrices of @xcite , and @xmath42 is the order of the sdp relaxation . as @xmath43 increases , solving @xmath44 generates a nondecreasing sequence of lower bounds for @xmath45 , namely : @xmath46 moreover , if ( [ genpop ] ) has a unique minimizer @xmath47 , the vector @xmath48 obtained from an optimal solution @xmath49 of ( [ sparsesdp ] ) is an approximation of @xmath47 , and under certain compactness conditions , see @xcite , as @xmath50 , @xmath51 in implementations of the sparse sdp relaxation such as sparsepop , small linear perturbation terms are added to the objective function @xmath24 , in order to ensure that ( [ discretizedpdepop ] ) has a unique optimal solution .",
    "therefore , an optimal solution of the sdp ( [ sparsesdp ] ) is an approximation of the optimal solution of the pop ( [ discretizedpdepop ] ) .      from ( [ conv ] ) , asymptotic convergence of minimum and minimizer of @xmath44 to minimum and minimizer of pop ( [ genpop ] )",
    "are guaranteed under uniqueness of the optimal solution and compactness of the feasible set of the pop . however , recall that the dimension @xmath34 of pop ( [ genpop ] ) is @xmath52 , and so , if @xmath43 is much larger than @xmath53 , the resulting @xmath44 in ( [ sparsesdp ] ) is untractable for general purpose sdp solvers .",
    "therefore , we have to restrict ourselves to @xmath54 for medium scale @xmath16 , and we can not expect that @xmath55 or @xmath56 provide accurate approximations to a solution of a nonlinear differential equation . in order to improve accuracy",
    ", we may apply additional locally convergent optimization techniques .",
    "for instance sequential quadratic programming ( sqp ) can be applied to ( [ discretizedpdepop ] ) , starting from the solution of @xmath44 as initial guess .",
    "since the solution of the sdp relaxation is an approximation for the global optimizer , it is a systematic choice for an initial point for local methods which does not require any a priori information . combining the sparse sdp relaxation with sqp ( or another local method )",
    "is summarized in the scheme :    _ the sdpr method _    1 .",
    "choose a discretization @xmath57 for the differential equation problem .",
    "2 .   choose a relaxation order @xmath43 and an objective function @xmath24 .",
    "apply @xmath44 to ( [ discretizedpdepop ] ) and obtain its solution @xmath58 and the lower bound @xmath59 for @xmath60 .",
    "3 .   apply sequential quadratic programming ( sqp ) to ( [ discretizedpdepop ] ) with @xmath58 as initial guess , and obtain @xmath15 as discrete approximation to a solution of the differential equation problem .",
    "in this section we briefly introduce the _ maximum entropy estimation _ of @xcite , our second tool to find smooth approximations for solutions of nonlinear differential equations .",
    "the maximum entropy estimation is concerned with the following problem : let @xmath61 be nonnegative and partially known by the finite vector @xmath62 of moments up to order @xmath63 of the associated borel measure @xmath64 on @xmath13",
    ". from the only knowledge of @xmath62 , find an estimate @xmath65 such that all moments of order up to @xmath63 of the measure @xmath66 match those of @xmath67 and analyze the asymptotic behavior of @xmath68 as @xmath69 .",
    "an elegant method consists in finding the estimate @xmath68 that maximizes the _ boltzmann - shannon _ entropy functional @xmath70 in this case , the optimal estimate @xmath71 is given by @xmath72 where @xmath73 is a ( global ) optimizer of the _ convex _ finite - dimensional optimization problem : @xmath74 the optimization problem ( [ concaveoptprob ] ) can be solved by first or second order methods like newton s method or sqp . for these methods , gradient and hessian of the objective function in ( [ concaveoptprob ] ) must be computed . in the case",
    "the domain @xmath13 is simple , we may compute them by quadrature and cubature formulas . for more difficult domains one may use the procedure described in @xcite . concerning the behavior of @xmath71 as @xmath75 and its relationship with @xmath15 ,",
    "one has the following weak convergence result from @xcite .",
    "[ convergence ] let @xmath71 be obtained from an optimal solution of ( [ concaveoptprob ] ) . then , as @xmath75 , @xmath76 for every bounded measurable function @xmath77 which is continuous almost everywhere .",
    "however , the _ pointwise _ convergence @xmath78 does not hold in general .",
    "in this section we show how to combine the sdpr method and maximum entropy estimation to obtain smooth approximations for solutions of linear and nonlinear differential equations .",
    "our discussion focuses on the 2-dimensional case , but the 1-dimensional case is covered analogously .",
    "let @xmath10 be a solution of ( [ pdeproblem ] ) and assume without loss of generality that @xmath79 so that @xmath15 is nonnegative on @xmath13 . for @xmath80 define @xmath81 and apply the outlined procedure to the new function @xmath58 .",
    "associated with @xmath15 , let @xmath82 be the finite borel measure on @xmath13 with moment vector @xmath83 of all moments up to order @xmath63 : @xmath84 for @xmath85 with @xmath86 . for linear pdes , a hierarchy of tightening lower and upper bounds for the components @xmath87 of the moment vector can be obtained by solving a sequence of sdps as proposed in @xcite . however",
    ", this approach can not be applied in the case of nonlinear pdes .",
    "our strategy is to use a discrete approximation @xmath88 of a solution of the pde to approximate the moments @xmath87 by : @xmath89 for @xmath85 with @xmath86 , where @xmath90 , @xmath91 .",
    "if the discretization @xmath92 is sufficiently fine and @xmath93 is a close approximation of @xmath15 , then we expect @xmath94 to be a good approximation of @xmath87 for all @xmath85 .",
    "thus , we can apply maximum entropy estimation to the vector @xmath95 to obtain a smooth approximation of @xmath15 .",
    "this idea is formalized in the following algorithm for obtaining smooth approximations of solutions of linear or nonlinear pde problems .    _ the smooth sdp approximation method _ + given a pde problem of form ( [ pdeproblem ] ) .    1 .",
    "choose a discretization @xmath57 , relaxation order @xmath43 and objective @xmath24 , and apply the sdpr method to obtain a discrete approximation @xmath93 to a solution of the pde problem .",
    "if not given in the formulation of the pde problem , impose lower and upper bounds , lbd and ubd for @xmath15 .",
    "2 .   choose a moment bound @xmath96 and use @xmath93 to calculate @xmath95 as in ( [ momapprox ] ) .",
    "3 .   apply maximum entropy estimation to @xmath95 and obtain vector @xmath97 , optimal solution of ( [ concaveoptprob ] ) .",
    "4 .   obtain the approximation @xmath98 with @xmath99 for a solution @xmath15 of the pde problem ( [ pdeproblem ] ) on @xmath13 .",
    "[ ssdpam ]    as @xmath75 , @xmath100 weakly ( see proposition [ convergence ] ) but not pointwise , i.e. , one can not guarantee @xmath101 on @xmath13 .",
    "nevertheless , as reported in @xcite the maximum entropy estimation may provide accurate pointwise approximation of the unknown function to be recovered on certain segments of the domain @xmath13 .",
    "we next illustrate on a variety of pde problems and ocps , that indeed good pointwise approximation can be obtained on some parts of the domain @xmath13 .",
    "we illustrate the potential of method [ ssdpam ] on a variety of ode and pde problems . as an implementation of the sparse sdp relaxations we apply the software sparsepop of @xcite and as an implementation of sequential quadratic programming ( sqp ) in the sdpr method and in solving the optimization problem ( [ concaveoptprob ] ) we apply the matlab optimization toolbox commands fmincon and fminunc , respectively . as we restrict ourselves to odes and pdes with rectangular domains @xmath13 we can apply standard quadrature and cubature formulas to compute the gradient and hessian for ( [ concaveoptprob ] ) .",
    "thus , we apply the matlab commands trapz in the one - dimensional case and dblquad in the two - dimensional case , respectively . in order to evaluate the quality of the smooth approximation provided by method [ ssdpam ] we define the _ average error _ @xmath102 and the _ maximum pointwise error _ @xmath103 .      as first test problems for our approach",

    "we apply method [ sdprm ] with @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "we calculate the approximate moments @xmath95 for @xmath109 and compare them to approximate moments for @xmath62 derived in @xcite by contracting lower and upper bounds in table [ reslinearode ] .",

    "we observe that the pointwise approximation of optimal control and trajectories on the interior of the domain gets better and better for increasing moment order , see figure [ doublefig ] .",
    "note , unlike the moment based method in @xcite which yields bounds for the optimal value of the control problem , we obtain discrete and smooth approximations to the optimal control and the corresponding trajectories by method [ sdprm ] and method [ ssdpam ] , respectively .",
    "we introduced a novel technique to derive smooth approximations for solutions of systems of differential equations and optimal control problems , which is based on sparse sdp relaxations and the maximum entropy estimation method .",
    "as demonstrated on some examples of nonlinear ordinary differential equations , partial differential equations and optimal control problems , this technique is promising to obtain accurate pointwise approximations of a solution of a differential equation on segments of its domain .",
    "it would be interesting to characterize regions of the domain of nonlinear differential equations where accurate pointwise approximations can be guaranteed .",
    "another question is whether a different , less restrictive parametrization than ( [ maxentestimate ] ) allows better pointwise approximations on larger segments of the domain .",
    "of course , other choices of entropy would lead to different results , and it remains a topic of future investigation to analyze , whether or not some choice should be preferred . at this point solving",
    "the sparse sdp relaxation is the major computational bottleneck in method [ ssdpam ] .",
    "every improvement for approximation accuracy and efficiency of sdp relaxation techniques for polynomial programs and every improvement for sdp solvers will extend the range of the proposed method .    in order to validate these techniques in the present context of pdes , a comparison with state - of - the - art numerical methods for solving nonlinear pdes remains to be done .",
    "in particular , the maximum entropy technique should be compared with standard and spline interpolation methods which both provide differentiable approximations that coincide with the discrete solution at each grid point .",
    "but , unlike our method , in polynomial interpolation the _ degree _ of the polynomial is directly related to the number of grid points",
    ". also , cubic splines are twice differentiable at the grid points , whereas our approximation is smooth .",
    "in contrast , and instead of searching for a smooth solution that matches the unknown @xmath15 at the grid points , one searches for a smooth solution that matches finitely many _ moments _ of the associated measure @xmath126 .",
    "and so , an interesting feature is to obtain a smooth approximation from a limited number of _ moments _ and not from the discrete solution explicitly ( still , before using moments , a sufficiently fine discretization is necessary to ensure @xmath127 ) .",
    "this method is an attempt to deal with the _ curse of dimensionality _ in the numerical analysis of pdes .",
    "furthermore , we emphasize that the proposed method can be applied to a wide range of problems that encompasses nonlinear partial differential equations and nonlinear optimal control problems .",
    "a detailed comparison is however out of the scope of this paper , whose main objective was to pave the way for the development of sdp techniques to solve optimal control design problems for dynamical systems described by polynomial odes and pdes , in the spirit of @xcite .",
