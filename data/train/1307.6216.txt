    "superwinds are galaxy - scale outflows of material often present in galaxies hosting star formation or active galactic nuclei ( agns ) @xcite .",
    "the feedback from winds plays an important role in the evolution of galaxies , their interstellar media ( ism ) , and the surrounding intergalactic or intracluster medium in which they are embedded .",
    "outflows of material can inhibit the growth of a central supermassive black hole and limit the star formation rate ( sfr ) by removing the fuel for star formation @xcite .    prior to 2005 ,",
    "much of the observational data have emphasized the entrained gas in winds from the neutral gas @xcite to ionized gas @xcite to the highly ionized x - ray emitting plasma @xcite .",
    "recent observations have shown that these outflows entrain dust @xcite and molecular gas @xcite .",
    "the striking detection by @xcite of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) emission in the prototypical wind of m82 has demonstrated that the four near - infrared ( nir ) to mid - infrared ( mir ) channels of the infrared array camera ( irac ) on board the _ spitzer space telescope _ are ideal for detecting warm dust and molecules in galactic winds .",
    "pahs are aromatic molecules a few   in diameter and are often referred to as small dust grains .",
    "tens of carbon atoms with a `` fringe '' of hydrogen atoms make up a typical pah molecule , while the largest ones contain hundreds of carbon atoms .",
    "these molecules are found throughout the ism of our galaxy as well as in nearby galaxies exhibiting evidence of ongoing or recent star formation .",
    "since they efficiently absorb ultraviolet and optical photons , their reprocessed infrared ( ir ) emission features are often much stronger than the background dust continuum @xcite .",
    "pahs are widely believed to be responsible for emission features in the nir to mir at 3.3 , 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 - 8.8 and 11.3 - 11.9 @xmath1 m @xcite .",
    "the 3.6 , 4.5 and 5.8 @xmath1 m irac channels can detect dust at temperatures a few hundred to 1000 k , and the 3.6 , 5.8 and 8.0 @xmath1 m channels are sensitive to pah emission features .",
    "the 8.0 @xmath1 m band is particularly important due to the 7.7 @xmath1 m pah feature ( e.g. figure 1 of @xcite ) which typically dominates compared to other flux contributions from stars , dust continuum , molecular emission , and fine structure lines ( see discussion in   [ convolution ] ) .",
    "relative to the 8.0 @xmath1 m band , the 4.5 @xmath1 m band contains very little pah emission while significantly more stellar and dust continuum emission .",
    "some h@xmath2 rotational line emission and trace br@xmath3 emission may also contribute in the 4.5 @xmath1 m band @xcite .",
    "the 3.6 and 5.8 @xmath1 m bands also contain the 3.3 and 6.2 @xmath1 m pah emission features respectively , so using these bands as tracers of stellar emission is less reliable .",
    "therefore , a comparison of 4.5 and 8.0 @xmath1 m images differentiates pah emission from stellar emission .",
    "we have used this comparison to identify extraplanar pah features and estimate extraplanar pah flux .",
    "our sample of local galaxies provides the resolution necessary to distinguish coplanar from extraplanar emission and to study morphological features . in this paper , pah emission or pah flux",
    "refers to measurements in the irac 8.0 @xmath1 m band rather than a bolometric pah measurement .    in   [ sample ]",
    ", we describe the selection criteria for our sample of nearby galaxies and provide tables summarizing their basic properties and the data we used from the _ spitzer _ archive . in   [ reduce ] and  [ analysis ] , we describe the data reduction process with example images and our analysis respectively .",
    "we present our results in ",
    "[ results_discuss ] , include images of each galaxy in the irac 4.5 and 8.0 @xmath1 m channels , discuss some of the most prominent features we have identified , compare our results with previous observations , and describe variations with galaxy type , ir luminosity , and sfr surface density .",
    "our results are summarized in   [ summary ] .",
    "appendix  [ append : galaxies ] contains discussion of each individual galaxy and its features .",
    "we selected the 16 galaxies in our sample ( listed in table  [ tbl : sample ] ) based on three main criteria .",
    "( 1 ) from observations at other wavelengths , they are known to host galactic - scale winds or exhibit associated extraplanar material .",
    "most have disk morphology with inclinations ( @xmath4 ) typically @xmath0 70@xmath5 , making extraplanar regions distinguishable from the galaxy s disk .",
    "( 2 ) they are nearby galaxies with a median distance of 8.6 mpc .",
    "we adopted redshift - independent distance values ( except for ngc 2992 ) found using the tip of the red giant branch or the tully - fisher relation . by choosing local sources , we maintain good spatial resolution even for the most distant galaxy in our sample : at the adopted distance of 31 mpc for ngc 2992 , the 1.72 `` and 1.98 '' mean fwhm of the 4.5 and 8.0 @xmath1 m irac bands resolve structure down to @xmath0 260 pc and @xmath0 300 pc respectively .",
    "( 3 ) each source has publicly available irac data in the _ spitzer _ archive ( summarized in table  [ tbl : data ] ) .",
    "data for four of the galaxies ( ngc 1482 , ngc 1705 , ngc 4631 , and m82 ) came from the sings survey @xcite .    from previous multi - wavelength observations , most of the galaxies host active star formation ( h ii regions ) , two ( ngc 3079 and ngc 4945 ) contain both h ii regions and an agn and two ( ngc 2992 and ngc 4388 ) exhibit agn but little or no ongoing star formation .",
    "since ngc 55 and ngc 891 are not generally considered starburst galaxies , but do contain active star forming regions , we used the broader catch - all h ii type to include a range of sfrs .",
    "@xcite investigated extraplanar diffuse ionized gas ( edig ) in h@xmath3 for a sample of nearby edge - on spiral galaxies .",
    "their sample covered a range of ir luminosities ( @xmath6 ) in order to determine minimum thresholds for sfr surface density ( @xmath7 - from far - ir surface brightness , @xmath8/@xmath9 ) and far - ir flux ratio ( @xmath10/@xmath11 ) leading to the presence of edig .",
    "all the galaxies in our sample apart from ngc 55 lie above their derived lower limit for @xmath8/@xmath9 ( ( 3.2 @xmath12 0.5 ) @xmath13 10@xmath14 erg s@xmath15 kpc@xmath16 ) and lie either near or above their limit for @xmath10/@xmath11 ( 0.4 ) . combining their data with that of @xcite , @xcite noted the apparent correlation between @xmath7 and far - ir flux ratio , which is also recovered in our sample as shown in figure  [ fig : rossadettmar_analog ] . the @xmath7 shown in figure  [ fig : rossadettmar_analog ]",
    "was derived from @xcite using the @xmath6 and @xmath17 values in table  [ tbl : sample ] .",
    "extended , extraplanar emission features are typically faint compared to their host galaxy and its nuclear regions .",
    "these features are particularly susceptible to confusion with data artifacts even for nearby , resolved galaxies .",
    "therefore , a careful data reduction process is necessary to distinguish emission features from a number of potential artifacts .",
    "our sample contains data from a variety of observations , and each of the galaxies has different properties and morphology , so the lack of uniformity made it impossible to use a single data reduction rubric for all sources .",
    "therefore , we tailored our approach to each data set s individual features and artifacts .",
    "typically , we used the basic calibrated data , uncertainty and mask fits files from the _ spitzer _ archive as our starting point . since we were most interested in the extraplanar emission , maintaining the quality of the galaxy s nuclear region",
    "was sometimes sacrificed in order to get a better result for extraplanar regions .",
    "we also dealt with other features such as cosmic ray hits , image alignment , and rotation .",
    "however , we dealt with these relatively minor issues in standard ways , so we do not discuss them here .      the mitigation of artifacts in the irac basic calibrated data presents a variety of challenges due to electronic , instrumentation , and environmental effects . here",
    ", we discuss the major artifact corrections performed on the data in our sample .",
    "a comprehensive discussion of the irac pipeline and data artifacts can be found in the irac instrument handbook .",
    "all of the irac data sets from the _ spitzer _ archive contain basic calibrated data images ( bcds ) , uncertainty maps , and mask files amongst their data products .",
    "these products are the result of the _ spitzer science center _ ( ssc ) pipeline which corrects for detector bias , does dark subtraction , flatfielding and photometric calibrations . prior to release ,",
    "some of the data were also run through a ssc - contributed artifact mitigation code , so these data contain corrected basic calibrated data ( cbcds ) in addition to the original bcds .",
    "the ssc - contributed code attempts to correct for the following artifacts :    * column pulldown / pullup - a uniform bias shift up or down within columns containing a bright source . according to the irac instrument handbook",
    ", this artifact only appears in the 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath1 m channels , but we also observed a similar artifact in some 8.0 @xmath1 m data ( see   [ banding ] ) .",
    "* muxbleed - a periodic shift in the bias along rows in the image containing a bright source such as a star .",
    "it appears like a decaying `` trail of breadcrumbs '' .",
    "this artifact only affects the 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath1 m channels . * electronic banding - a nearly constant bias shift to higher values across rows containing a bright source .",
    "this artifact appears only in the 5.8 and 8.0 @xmath1 m channels . *",
    "first frame effect - a bias effect on the entire frame , which makes consecutive frames mismatched - a problem when co - adding images or creating mosaics . in our mosaics and image stacks",
    ", we excluded the first short frame taken at each new pointing , since those frames are most affected by the first frame effect .",
    "the ssc - contributed code does not correct full - array pull - up , internal scattering , optical banding , `` muxstriping '' , or persistent images . for a detailed description of these artifacts ,",
    "consult the irac instrument handbook .",
    "we discuss the correction of full - array pull - up , internal scattering , and optical banding in the following sections .",
    "the data are minimally affected by `` muxstriping '' or persistent images , so in general these artifacts could be ignored . whenever advantageous , we worked from the cbcds , since they often exhibited a useful reduction or elimination of the prescribed artifacts .",
    "as implied above , some data sets only contained bcds and no cbcds .",
    "for those data sets , we downloaded the ssc - contributed code and used it to produce cbcds .      when integrating individual frames in both the 4.5 @xmath1 m and 8.0 @xmath1 m channels , the total flux from all sources within the frame contributes a uniform , proportional offset across all pixels - an effect called `` full - array pull - up '' by the irac instrument handbook .",
    "in addition to this effect , some light can scatter approximately uniformly within the array due to the presence of a bright source in the 8.0 @xmath1 m channel , adding to the total offset .",
    "we accounted for the offsets due to full - array pull - up and internal scattering by background subtracting all individual frames via user - defined background regions .",
    "the background regions were carefully selected to exclude galaxy features , foreground stars , and any data artifacts .",
    "bright features within the galaxy s disk or any bright stars within the frame were the main source of the internally scattered flux , but these features were not part of our extraplanar flux measurements , so removing their redistributed flux from the frame was an acceptable solution .",
    "background matching via subtraction worked significantly better than utilizing the mopex overlap modules , which tended to introduce a bias across the mosaic .",
    "it does not escape our notice that any uniform extraplanar emission would be subtracted off using this method , but we expect such a flux distribution to be unlikely ( a test of this background subtraction method is described in   [ model_epah ] below ) .      the horizontal ( row )",
    "electronic and optical banding effect was pervasive in the data and presented a significant challenge in exposures where a galaxy covered a large fraction of the array or in exposures where banding and extraplanar features overlapped .",
    "in the course of inspecting the cbcds , we found that the banding correction applied to the 8.0 @xmath1 m data by the ssc - contributed code and later versions of the ssc pipeline provided incomplete artifact removal by only addressing the brightest rows .",
    "since the banding artifacts for extended sources covered a wide range of rows , we developed a pyraf script to correct individual frames by removing the entire band rather than just the few brightest rows .",
    "our pyraf script employs user - defined rectangular regions to sample the background and banding artifact regions .",
    "it then subtracts a constant value banding offset from each affected row .",
    "overlaid example regions are shown in the left panel of figure  [ fig : banding ] and an example result is shown in the right panel .    we also observed a less common , but similarly uniform bias shift in the columns of 8.0 @xmath1 m images containing a bright source .",
    "however , in this case the bias shift was uniformly negative rather than positive .",
    "we adapted our pyraf script and corrected the affected columns .",
    "the point spread function ( psf ) wings of bright sources can be another locus of confusion with extraplanar emission .",
    "although the galaxies in our sample are not true point sources , several ( ngc 1482 , ngc 2992 , ngc 3079 , ngc 3628 and ngc 5253 ) contain bright , concentrated nuclei , which exhibit psfs very similar to those produced by bright stars and extend to regions of possible extraplanar emission . in addition , several galaxies ( e.g. ngc 1569 ) have bright foreground stars with prominent psf wings in close proximity to or overlapping the galaxy s disk .",
    "the ssc has produced point response functions ( prfs ) , which are tables for point source fitting stored as 2-dimensional fits files and over - sampled to account for intra - pixel sensitivity variations . by sampling the prfs at the appropriate resolution , we fit and subtracted an estimate of the psf wings for nuclei and foreground stars using the apex and apex qa modules of the ssc - provided mopex software .    since the nuclei of our sample galaxies are not true point sources ( the closest being ngc 5253 ) , fitting their wings presented more of a challenge than foreground stars .",
    "the bright source generating the psf is typically spread over several pixels , each with their own intra - pixel variation , leading to smeared wings , which could not be fit well for a single frame with the ssc - provided prfs . when multiple frames were stacked or mosaicked , that reduced some of the intra - pixel variation , making a fit a bit more straightforward , but we still needed to use a combination of the apex fitting modules in mopex together with some common sense `` manual '' adjustments , which sometimes meant a segmented model of the source to imitate the smearing .",
    "figure  [ fig : prf ] shows an example of the fitting challenges .",
    "the irac instrument handbook lists extended source photometrical correction factors based on the radius of an effective circular aperture for the flux measurement region . since our sources are nearby , and all our extraplanar regions cover extended solid angles ( @xmath18 35 `` ) , we applied the infinite , asymptotic correction coefficients : 4.5 @xmath1 m @xmath19 0.94 and 8.0 @xmath1 m @xmath19 0.740 . in order to save a step in our flux measurements",
    ", we applied the aperture corrections to the 4.5 and 8.0 @xmath1 m micron images before the stellar continuum emission subtraction in the next section .",
    "despite these aperture corrections , our flux measurements still have uncertainties at the 10 - 20% level due to differences in ' ' full - array pull - up \" and internal scattering from source to source .",
    "we propagated these uncertainties through our calculations .",
    "apart from the 7.7 and 8.6 - 8.8 pah emission features , other potential contributions to the 8.0 @xmath1 m band flux include stellar and dust continuum emission , [ ar ii ] and [ ar iii ] fine structure lines at 6.985 @xmath1 m and 8.991 @xmath1 m respectively , and the h@xmath2 @xmath20(5 ) and h@xmath2 @xmath20(4 ) pure rotational lines at 6.909 @xmath1 m and 8.026 @xmath1 m respectively .",
    "@xcite included the fine structure lines and h@xmath2 rotational lines in their detailed decomposition of ir spectra from 59 nearby galaxies with a range of star formation properties , but these lines typically accounted for negligible flux in the 8.0 @xmath1 m band compared with the contributions of the pah emission features plus stellar and dust continuum emission .",
    "likewise , these atomic and molecular lines appear comparatively weaker in the nuclei of starburst galaxies @xcite as well as within ultraluminous infrared galaxies @xcite . in addition ,",
    "absorption from amorphous silicate centered at 9.7 - 9.8 @xmath1 m can attenuate pah emission at the red end of the 8.0 @xmath1 m band , particularly the 8.6 - 8.8 @xmath1 m pah feature @xcite .",
    "however , the optical depth due to silicate absorption will likely approach zero for extraplanar regions , so we considered it negligible . similarly",
    ", dust continuum emission should be less important in extraplanar regions .",
    "therefore , we focused on accounting for the stellar emission contribution to the 8.0 @xmath1 m band flux .    first , we convolved the 4.5 @xmath1 m images to the resolution of the 8.0 @xmath1 m images using the appropriate convolution kernel as described in @xcite along with the associated idl routineskgordon/mips/conv@xmath21psfs/conv@xmath21psfs.html ] .",
    "the convolved images and original 8.0 @xmath1 m images both have a psf fwhm of @xmath0 1.9 `` , which is comparable to the 1.22 '' pixel scale of the irac images . as a check",
    ", we also generated kernels from the data directly , producing similar flux values after convolution .",
    "however , we used the images convolved with the kernels from k. gordon for our stellar subtraction , since the data - generated kernels tended to over - reduce resolution and compromise the subtraction of individual stars .",
    "@xcite used a conceptually simple approach to model the stellar contribution to the seds of 75 nearby galaxies . using a starburst99 @xcite model with 900",
    "myr continous star formation , solar metallicity , and a salpeter imf ( @xmath22 = 2.35 ) and dust models essentially parametrized by the far - infrared color @xmath23(70 @xmath1m)/@xmath23(160 @xmath1 m ) , they found `` remarkable '' fits to their sample s seds . with this method , they estimated the `` dust - only '' 8.0 and 24 @xmath1 m fluxes by subtracting an extrapolated stellar contribution scaled from the 3.6 @xmath1 m flux .",
    "since the 4.5 @xmath1 m band contains predominantly stellar continuum emission , it can be used along with a scaling factor to estimate the stellar contribution to the 8.0 @xmath1 m band .",
    "adopting their scaling factors , the extrapolated stellar contribution scaling factor to go from 4.5 to 8.0 @xmath1 m is @xmath24 = 0.352 .",
    "thus , in order to obtain fluxes with only 8.0 @xmath1 m pah emission , we subtracted the scaled 4.5 @xmath1 m flux :    @xmath25    a couple irac artifacts tend to redistribute the flux of bright sources , so star subtraction with this method does nt work as consistently well for bright stars as it does for dimmer stars .",
    "when residual stars remained in the extraplanar regions of our stellar continuum - subtracted maps , we masked them out before taking flux measurements ( see   [ flux ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : subtract ] shows an example of subtracting the stellar continuum from the data for ngc 891 . in subsequent sections ,",
    "we refer to the stellar continuum - subtracted 8.0 @xmath1 m maps as pah images .",
    "since measuring diffuse extraplanar flux depends critically on the accuracy of the background subtraction , we tested our method by carefully constructing a model of diffuse extraplanar pah emission for ngc 891 .",
    "we chose ngc 891 , because ( 1 ) it has one of the best behaved edge - on disk morphologies of our sample galaxies , making it simpler to model the underlying stellar disk at 4.5 @xmath1 m , ( 2 ) it is dominated by a very diffuse , nearly featureless extraplanar pah emission morphology , and ( 3 ) it is large on the sky , with the disk subtending more than two full irac fields of view . attributes ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) make quantifying the extraplanar pah emission in ngc 891 most challenging , and thus an excellent test case for our methods of data reduction .",
    "we modeled the diffuse extraplanar pah emission as a basic exponential disk :    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the pixel intensity as a function of @xmath28 and @xmath29 , @xmath30 is the reference intensity , and @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the vertical and radial scale heights with respect to the disk .",
    "we chose values of @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 which came close to replicating the morphology of the 8.0 @xmath1 m data , but with more extended , diffuse flux in the @xmath28-direction .",
    "we chose a more extended @xmath28-direction morphology in order to make it harder to find background reference regions within individual on - source frames .    in order to simulate each individual frame of 8.0 @xmath1 m data in the same pattern as the observations , we added ( 1 ) a scaled 4.5 @xmath1 m frame , ( 2 ) the corresponding 256x256 pixel area from our model , ( 3 ) 20 - 30% ( the percentage was chosen at random in that range ) of the total flux from the first two components evenly distributed throughout the 256x256 frame , and ( 4 ) a constant offset .",
    "components ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) approximate the source s 8.0 @xmath1 m flux , while ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) approximate the behavior of the detector , with component ( 3 ) mimicking the `` full - array pull - up '' plus internal scattering .",
    "the 20 - 30% range was chosen to bracket the @xmath0 25% value listed in the irac instrument handbook .",
    "next , we performed background subtraction on the individual frames by following the procedure described in ",
    "we made a mosaic of these simulated 8.0 @xmath1 m frames using mopex , performed scaled stellar subtraction , and applied aperture corrections , obtaining a model of diffuse extraplanar pah emission .",
    "we measured the flux of our modeled diffuse extraplanar pah emission and recovered @xmath0 98% of the flux originally contained within the same extraplanar region of the model .",
    "this flux loss of @xmath0 2% is an order of magnitude lower than the @xmath0 10 - 20% systematic uncertainty of irac flux measurements as listed in the irac instrument handbook , so our method of background subtraction has a negligible effect on the measured fluxes . since our method of background subtraction performed well in the challenging case of ngc 891 , we are confident that our reduction also worked well for the other galaxies in our sample .",
    "measuring the extent of extraplanar pah emission features gives a basis for comparison to other data such as h@xmath3 , x - ray , na i d , etc . in order to measure the extent of extraplanar pah features ( @xmath33 ) , we measured perpendicularly from the major axis of the disk to the tip of the feature as it appeared in the 8.0 @xmath1 m images ( before stellar continuum subtraction ) .",
    "we defined the tip of the feature by overlaying a 3-@xmath34 contour , based on the @xmath34 value of the background noise in the 8.0 @xmath1 m image ( as listed in table  [ tbl : data ] ) .",
    "the projection angles of features are unknown , so our method finds the value of @xmath33 as though it were perpendicular to the line of sight setting an approximate lower limit to the actual size of these features . for cases where the galactic disks are not quite edge - on , the error in our @xmath33 measurement may be larger . table  [ tbl : results ] lists the @xmath33 value representing the most extended pah emission feature for each galaxy .      beyond simply identifying extraplanar pah emission features ,",
    "quantifying their flux and comparing with the host galaxy s properties allows us to investigate relationships with star formation and galaxy type . measuring a value for the extraplanar pah flux necessitates delineating the disk from the extraplanar region of each galaxy .",
    "factors such as inclination and morphology can complicate this task somewhat , but our sample consists primarily of disk galaxies with nearly edge - on orientations , simplifying matters .",
    "we wrote a pyraf script , which determines the vertical scale height ( @xmath31 ) of a galaxy s stellar disk and from that value generates a disk region .",
    "we used the 4.5 @xmath1 m images ( pre - convolution ) to generate disk regions based on continuum stellar emission . before running our script , we rotated the images to align each galactic disk horizontally .",
    "our script first determines a vertical scale height value ( @xmath35 ) for each column of pixels above the disk of the galaxy by fitting a simple exponential :    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is the intensity at height @xmath28 , and @xmath30 is the intensity where the fit begins . since the vertical intensity profile plateaus near the midplane of the disk , our script omits this area by using a small offset above the midplane ( @xmath38 ) for the beginning pixel of the fit .",
    "the fit range then extends up to where the intensity has fallen off by 1/@xmath39 .",
    "the script determines a global @xmath31 value by finding the median of all the @xmath35 values .",
    "the actual or apparent vertical thickness of the galaxy s stellar component can vary along the disk , especially with a bulge , disk asymmetry , or inclination effects .",
    "when measuring the extraplanar flux , the biggest contaminating flux typically comes from the galaxy s bulge .",
    "setting a constant vertical edge based on just @xmath31 can include too much of the central bulge or exclude regions at larger galactic radii which should be considered extraplanar .",
    "therefore , the method in our script for finding a vertical edge ( @xmath40 ) needed to account for the bulge and other variations in disk thickness when delineating the disk region .    starting from our assumption that _ to first order _ , the vertical light profile will have the same functional shape and @xmath31 value at all galactic radii , the exponential profile in equation  [ eq : scaleheight ] will simply shift in the @xmath28-direction based on the value of @xmath30 .",
    "consider two columns which reach the same @xmath37 at different values of @xmath28 - say one at large galactic radius where the projected disk intensity is low ( @xmath41 ) and one near the nucleus where the projected disk intensity is high ( @xmath42 ) :    @xmath43    @xmath44    where @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( @xmath45 <  @xmath46 ) are the different heights at which the intensity reaches @xmath37 .",
    "if we define the shift in the @xmath28-direction as @xmath47 = @xmath46 - @xmath45 , then    @xmath48    thus the shift of the exponential profile in the @xmath28-direction should depend only on the ratio ( @xmath42 / @xmath41 ) and @xmath31 , which we ve assumed to be constant for the entire disk .",
    "therefore our script determines the edge of the disk region , @xmath40 , by combining the offset at the midplane ( @xmath38 ) with a multiple of @xmath31 and a term to account for the intensity profile shift in the @xmath28-direction due to a bulge or other variations in disk thickness :    @xmath49    where @xmath50 is a distance constant determined by trial , @xmath51 is the median @xmath30 within a bin along the major axis of the disk , and @xmath52 is the unit intensity in mjy sr@xmath15 .",
    "the bin size is chosen to reflect a balance of disk feature size and image resolution constraints .",
    "the factor of 3 represents a typical value for the ratio of the thick disk to the thin disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , since our method typically finds the vertical scale height of the thin disk .",
    "including each galaxy s @xmath31 value within the shift term as suggested by equation  [ eq : shift ] produced inconsistent results , often underestimating or overestimating the disk edge .",
    "instead , we adopted the distance constant @xmath50 , which we found by iteratively running our script with different constant values in order to appropriately scale the shifts of all bins .",
    "we use the same unit intensity @xmath52 as the reference value within the shift term for all galaxies in order for the @xmath28-direction shift to depend only on the relative values of @xmath51 ( i.e. the intensity variation within the disk ) . figure  [ fig : h_fit ] shows an example of vertical scale height fits to the 4.5 @xmath1 m surface brightness profile above and below the midplane of ngc 891 .",
    "the midpoint of the bin and @xmath40 are then the ( x , y ) coordinates of a point on the edge of the disk region .",
    "once these coordinates are determined for all the bins above the midplane , the script then repeats the fitting process below the midplane and generates a polygonal disk region by connecting points sequentially .",
    "our method for determining @xmath40 is purposefully conservative to make sure disk regions include the thick disk and bulge , so our extraplanar flux measurements may be lower limits .",
    "figure  [ fig : ext_flux ] shows an example of the disk region generated with this method for ngc 4388 .",
    "for the six galaxies in our sample with lower inclination or less disk - like morphology ( ngc 253 , ngc 1705 , ngc 1808 , ngc 2992 , ngc 4945 , and ngc 5253 ) , our method for finding a vertical scale height does not work .",
    "therefore , we used a disk region defined by the 20-@xmath34 contour of the 4.5 @xmath1 m image , where @xmath34 is the standard deviation of the background noise ( see table  [ tbl : data ] ) . as a check on the validity of this method to characterize the disk region",

    "since @xmath7 measures an average over the entire stellar disk while star formation tends to concentrate in certain regions , a global calculation will typically underestimate sfr surface density .",
    "therefore we developed a measurement of sfr surface density , which includes quantification of the star formation location and distribution .",
    "in doing so , we used the 8.0 @xmath1 m band emission as an approximate , though imperfect , tracer of star formation rather than the 24 @xmath1 m band emission , which is often used as such a tracer @xcite .",
    "the archival mips data for our sample suffers from lower resolution ,",
    "bright ( sometimes saturated ) psfs that overwhelm or significantly cover some galaxies making reliable disk diameters tricky to obtain , other detector artifacts that complicate photometry , and strong contamination from the agn in some objects .",

    "measuring the diameter of a single region or summing the diameters of multiple regions parallel to the galaxy s major axis , we obtained a characteristic diameter of pah emission in the disk , @xmath65 .",

    "the extraplanar features extend up from the disk , but also tend to splay outward radially .",
    "this morphology suggests a radially decreasing density gradient in the ism at the point of origin .",
    "some evidence exists for isolated extraplanar features at locations far from the nucleus ( e.g. ngc 3628 ) , but these appear to be outliers .",
    "for some galaxies ( e.g. ngc 2992 and ngc 3628 ) , the morphology , location , and orientation of particular pah features indicates tidal disruption rather than wind - driven origins .",
    "the extraplanar pah features we identify often coincide with previously observed h@xmath3 , x - ray , uv , and molecular features . amongst these observations",
    ", h@xmath3 appears to trace the spatial extent and morphology of extraplanar pah features best , though more observations of x - ray , uv , and molecular features are needed for comparison .",
    "bright h@xmath3 filaments and areas of diffuse h@xmath3 emission very frequently have a pah analog .",
    "however there does nt seem to be an entirely consistent correlation between these two tracers , since some significant features do not match ( e.g. ngc 1705 and ngc 6810 ) .",
    "the @xmath33 of pah emission is often less than coincident h@xmath3 or x - ray features , suggesting pahs do not survive out to the same distances as the wind s gas components , or the sensitivity of the irac data is not sufficient to pick up the full extent of these features .",
    "we also compare our measurement of extraplanar pah flux ( @xmath53 ) to the total ir flux ( @xmath67 ) of our sources .",
    "since @xmath67 relates to the galaxy s sfr ( excluding possible contributions from the agn ) , comparing these fluxes should give some insight into what physical mechanism drives the pahs out of the galaxy .",
    "we plot @xmath53 vs. @xmath67 in figure  [ fig : plot1 ] .",

    "these points should probably be considered lower limits , since part of the extraplanar pah emission associated with these lower inclination disks may overlap with the pah emission from the disk or be occulted by the disk itself .",
    "the points for ngc 2992 and ngc 4388 also lie below the fit .",
    "they are the only objects in our sample clearly dominated by a central agn rather than star formation .",
    "this result suggests agn - driven winds in the absence of robust star formation do not eject pahs as efficiently . in these cases",
    ", the presence of an agn may also affect the emitting grain distribution via grain destruction or ionization by the hardness of the radiation field @xcite .",
    "this tentative difference between agn- and supernova - driven winds needs to be confirmed with a larger sample of agn .",
    "we compare the characteristic properties of extraplanar pah emission to sfr surface density in figure  [ fig : plot2 ] .",
    "the plot in the top - left panel of figure  [ fig : plot2 ] suggests a moderate correlation between @xmath59 and @xmath7 with significant scatter and correlation coefficient @xmath69 = 0.55 .",
    "the open symbols on the plot tend to fall at lower @xmath59 values than other galaxies at similar values of @xmath7 , suggesting again that an inclined disk probably coincides with or occults a significant portion of the extraplanar pah flux .",
    "the plot in the center - left panel of figure  [ fig : plot2 ] shows scattered @xmath62 values , but we do find that the galaxies with smaller diameters ( @xmath60  <  5 kpc ; ngc 1569 , ngc 1705 , and ngc 5253 ) tend to fall near the lower end of the @xmath62 range , as would be expected .",
    "ngc 4388 also has a low @xmath62 value relative to the rest of the sample , and it s very likely that flux from tidal features increases the value for ngc 2992 , so the agn without robust star formation in our sample tend not to produce broadly extended extraplanar pah emission features .",
    "as listed in table  [ tbl : results ] , our sample galaxies span a broad range of sizes and luminosities .",
    "since large galaxies have more of everything compared to dwarf galaxies , they not only have larger sfrs , stellar masses , and disks on average than their dwarf counterparts , but their disks and associated extraplanar regions also extend higher vertically from the disk mid - plane than in dwarf galaxies , and so they tend to have larger @xmath62 values on average .",
    "to put all galaxies on the same footing , it is therefore natural to normalize @xmath62 by the size of the galaxy .",
    "normalization of @xmath62 by @xmath17 results in a significant correlation with @xmath7 , which is shown in the bottom - left panel of figure  [ fig : plot2 ] .",
    "the correlation coefficient between @xmath62/@xmath17 and @xmath7 is @xmath69 = 0.93 , and the best fit power law has an exponent of 0.62 @xmath12 0.12 .",
    "the point for ngc 891 ( read vertically from the labels in the center - left panel ) exhibits the largest offset from the overall trend .",
    "the anomalously large @xmath62 for ngc 891 is more challenging to explain , but may be due to the halo - like structure of the extraplanar pah emission in contrast with most other galaxies in our sample , which display filamentary extraplanar pah emission . in the case of halo - like pah emission , equation",
    "[ eq : hepah ] produces a larger @xmath62 value than in the case of filamentary emission , because the overall flux ( @xmath53 ) is larger and @xmath59 is smaller ( see figure  [ fig : h_epah_behave ] ) .",
    "using @xmath65 to calculate @xmath66 in the right column of figure  [ fig : plot2 ] , we find similar results to the left column of plots .",
    "the correlation coefficient between @xmath62/@xmath17 and @xmath66 is @xmath69 = 0.89 , and the best fit power law shown in the bottom - right panel of figure  [ fig : plot2 ] has an exponent of 0.40 @xmath12 0.12 .",
    "we also found a similar correlation between @xmath62/@xmath60 and @xmath7 .",
    "as a note of caution to the reader , we point out that the normalization factor @xmath17 on the vertical axis of figure  [ fig : plot2 ] may introduce an artificial correlation due to the linear correlations between @xmath17 , @xmath60 , and @xmath65 ( see figure  [ fig : diameters ] ) and the fact that @xmath7 and @xmath66 depend on @xmath70 and @xmath71 respectively . while we can not completely rule out this possibility , we note that @xmath62 also depends on @xmath72 according to equation  [ eq : hepah ] , so we would expect a log - log slope of unity between @xmath62/@xmath17 and @xmath7 or @xmath66 , which is inconsistent with our findings .",
    "therefore , we believe that the correlations between @xmath62/@xmath17 and @xmath7 and @xmath66 are physically motivated .",
    "these correlations support the idea of a surface density threshold on the energy or momentum injection rate necessary for elevating the disk ism sufficiently high above the disk to be detectable as extraplanar material .",
    "we have used existing data from the _ spitzer space telescope _ archive to perform the first multi - object search for extraplanar pah emission associated with known galactic winds .",
    "the data from the _ spitzer _ archive are ideal for detecting pahs due to the strength of the 7.7 @xmath1 m emission feature , which falls conveniently in the irac 8.0 @xmath1 m band .",
    "our sample contains 16 nearby known wind galaxies , for which there are publicly available irac data .",
    "our analysis of these data has yielded the following results :    * _ frequent detection _ - we found extraplanar pah features extending from 15 of the 16 known wind galaxy in our sample with the exception of ngc 1705 , which does not have a favorable orientation to search for extraplanar pah emission . *",
    "_ kiloparsec - scale extent _ - the extraplanar pah features we identified extend to projected distances @xmath0 0.8 - 6.0 kpc .",

    "_ varied morphology _ - a variety of extraplanar pah features were observed from filamentary structures and large areas of diffuse emission to the rare isolated cloud .",
    "the brightest filaments and bulk extraplanar pah emission appear to originate close to galactic nuclei .",
    "* _ correlations with other phases of the ism _ - since extraplanar pah features often trace the wind structures detected in h@xmath3 and x - rays , the pahs likely represent cold ism being swept out of the galaxy by the wind . however , not all features of the ionized gas phase ( particularly h@xmath3 ) match perfectly , so the presence of ionized gas in a wind does not necessarily imply the presence of extraplanar pahs",
    ". this may be due to dust grain destruction or insufficient sensitivity of the spitzer data .",
    "* _ connection with star formation activity in the disk _ - we found that extraplanar pah emission flux correlates linearly with total ir flux , a direct tracer of the sfr ( excluding possible contributions from an agn ) . employing a more quantitative analysis of the extent of extraplanar pah emission , we derive a characteristic scale height of the extraplanar pah emission , @xmath62 , for each galaxy .",
    "we find a significant correlation between the surface density of star formation in the disk and the characteristic scale height of the extraplanar pah emission , once it is normalized to the galaxy diameter .",
    "this direct link between the star formation activity in the disk and the extent of the extraplanar pah emission is similar to that seen when considering the extraplanar h@xmath3 emission .",

    "can be seen in the 8.0 @xmath1 m image , but it does not contribute significantly to the total extraplanar flux . also , the fainter band in the disk directly north of the nucleus resulted from psf subtraction , and not any real feature in the data .",
    "we see little to no evidence of extraplanar pah emission coincident with the region where @xcite observed a complex of highly ionized gas extending north of the nucleus . nor",

    ". the southeastern edge of the disk exhibits the highest concentration of filamentary features , where a dense region of plumes is bright against the background .",
    "filaments northwest and directly north of the nuclear region extend up from the disk and radially outward suggesting similar structure to the wide cone - like feature observed in broadband optical emission by @xcite and in line splitting by @xcite ( perhaps better seen in the optical image shown by @xcite ) .",

    "the clear presence and morphology of extraplanar pah emission filaments at large galactic radii suggests much of the extraplanar pahs were ejected from regions well outside the starburst disk or ring traced by br@xmath74 and l band imaging @xcite .",
    "since ngc 4945 is quite near the galactic plane ( @xmath75 @xmath76 13@xmath5 ) , these pah filaments at large galactic radii may not appear to have analogs in previous observations at other wavelengths due to galactic absorption as noted by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "* ngc 5253 ( figure  [ fig:5253_6810 ] , top ) : as with our data reduction for ngc 1482 , the 8.0 @xmath1 m psf was slightly over - subtracted along the vertical and horizontal axes after fitting and subtracting the psf wings .",
    "also , ghost image artifacts near the nucleus appear as multiple point sources in the 8.0 @xmath1 m image .",
    "extraplanar pah filaments seem to extend approximately radially from the nuclear region in most directions .",
    "filaments to the east and west match up somewhat with previous observations of h@xmath3 filaments @xcite .",
    "however , more prominent pah emission to the southeast of the nucleus coincides with an h i plume which has been interpreted as a tidal remnant or inflow @xcite .",
    "the filaments of pah emission to the west of the nucleus appear to extend into the region where a `` quiescent '' ( neither outflowing nor inflowing ) h@xmath3 bubble has been observed @xcite . * ngc 6810 ( figure  [ fig:5253_6810 ] , bottom ) : at first look , some of the radially - oriented pah features ( light blue in figure  [ fig:5253_6810 ] ) around the nucleus in the 8.0 @xmath1 m image appeared conspicuously similar to the wings of the ssc - provided prf .",
    "however , upon fitting a psf to the galaxy s nucleus , we found that there was little to no contribution to the extraplanar features from the psf .",
    "therefore , the extended extraplanar pah emission features appear as two galactic - scale bubbles emerging from either sides of ngc 6810 s nuclear region .",
    "this dust morphology resembles the x - ray features observed by @xcite more closely than h@xmath3 maps , which include a prominent filament extending toward the north - west , confirmed by @xcite after noting its presence in the observations of @xcite . *",
