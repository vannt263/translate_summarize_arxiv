    "the excitation of the resonances by electrons and neutrinos has been studied for a long time .",
    "the earlier articles @xcite@xcite tried to determine the @xmath3transition form factors in terms of basic principles , like cvc , pcac , dispersion relations , etc .",
    "these and subsequent papers introduced dipole form factors and in various cases other functional forms with additional kinematic factors in order to reproduce the data .",
    "the result was the presentation of cross sections ( differential and integrated ) in terms of several parameters @xcite@xcite .",
    "the relatively large number of parameters and the limited statistics of the experiments provided qualitative comparisons but an accurate determination of the terms is still missing . a new generation of experiments is now under construction aiming to measure properties of the neutrino oscillations and they present the opportunity for precise tests of the standard model .    for these reasons we decided to improve the calculation of the excitation of resonances with isospin @xmath4 and @xmath5 looking into the various terms that enter the calculations and trying to determine them , as accurately as possible . for reasons of economy we shall study four resonances .",
    "we shall give explicit formulas and form factors for @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 and use a functional form for @xmath9 obtained in electroproduction @xcite .",
    "we calculate the cross section for the production of each resonance alone ( fig .",
    "3 ) and found that @xmath6 dominates . next we shall study the vector current in electroproduction data and then use it for neutrino reactions .",
    "for the axial current we shall discuss the constraints introduced by pcac for several form factors .",
    "then we shall calculate the differential cross section in @xmath10 and also in @xmath11 ( invariant mass of the final pion  nucleon system ) .",
    "we shall restrict the numerical analysis to the @xmath12 channel and to @xmath13 gev where there is accurate data and in order to avoid the influence of higher resonances .",
    "for example the @xmath14 resonance is expected to provide a small contribution , at low energies , because it is further away and has a small elasticity @xcite . for our kinematic region the higher resonances with @xmath15 provide a smooth background to the @xmath16 and @xmath17 channels .",
    "their effects will show up in the w - distributions and the overall scale of the integrated cross sections .",
    "this approach was demonstrated @xcite to agree with the available data . in this article",
    "we extend the calculations giving more details which will be helpful for future comparisons .",
    "cross sections will be presented primarily for free protons and neutrons . in the future",
    "we will extent this study by including higher resonances contributing to other channels",
    ". it will be interesting to include the inelasticity of higher resonance in order to estimate their contribution to the multi - pion events .",
    "neutrino experiments , however , use medium  heavy and heavy nuclei which brings additional corrections .",
    "several studies so far identified nuclear effects from    * the pauli exclusion principle , * the fermi motion , and * the absorption and charge exchange of the produced pions    in nuclei . in this article",
    "we discuss in greater detail the pauli effect and show that it brings a modification to the data which should be identified and checked in the experiments .",
    "it may be important in producing the @xmath10 distribution .",

    "the paper is planned as follows .",
    "in section 2 we present the general formalism for the production of the @xmath2-resonance emphasizing the minimal input , which is necessary . in section 3",
    "we give explicit formulas for the other two resonances @xmath23 and @xmath1 where contribution we find to be small .",
    "since nuclear corrections were calculated long time ago we decided to present an explicit calculation of the pauli suppression factor , in order to examine its validity in various processes .",
    "we emphasize in section 4 how the pauli factor should be applied to quasi - elastic scattering , as well as in the production of resonances . in section 5",
    "we apply the formalism to the production of @xmath24 and rely on the connection with electroproduction data .",
    "finally , in section 6 is presented a summary of the results .",
    "photoproduction and electroproduction data in the @xmath2-region are well reproduced by a single form factor plus a smooth background representing the tails of higher resonances @xcite .",
    "we shall use these results by adopting one vector form factor , i.e. the magnetic dipole term .    for neutrino ",
    "induced reactions , on the other hand , there are many models some of which introduce many resonances . this way one accounts for the data at the cost of introducing many parameters .",
    "other models restrict the analysis in the @xmath2region , @xmath11 1.4 gev , where the @xmath2resonance dominates and the main issue is the selection of the axial form factors and their parameterization . we shall use form factors which satisfy pcac and have a modified dipole @xmath10 dependence .",
    "this approach provides a relatively simple formalism for single pion production and was shown recently to reproduce the existing data @xcite .",
    "we shall adopt this formalism and use it to calculate differential and total cross sections comparing it with data in order to determine overall validity or need for modifications and extensions . in this article , the formulas for the excitation of the @xmath2 resonance are simpler than in ref .",
    "@xcite because we take into account special properties of the form factors , which have been accumulated in the meanwhile .",
    "we give explicit formulas for the @xmath15 resonances and show that in the energy region of the experiments their contribution is small .",

    "we adopt this vector form factor and use cvc to determine its contribution to the neutrino induced reactions .",

    "the @xmath10dependence of the form factors varies among the publications giving different cross sections and different @xmath10 distributions even when the same @xmath47 is used . for this dependence",

    "if the overlap of the wave functions has a larger mean - square - radius then the form factor will have a steeper @xmath10 dependence as is indicated by the electromagnetic form factor for the excitation of @xmath2 @xcite . since the effect is geometrical",
    "we expect a similar behavior for the vector and axial vector form factors .",
    "for this reason we replace another factor used in previous articles @xcite by the modified dipole in eq .",

    "it is evident that the matrix element vanishes for @xmath95 , which we shall use as a condition later on .",
    "the problem now is to carry out the integrals and express the suppression factor in terms of @xmath96 , the ratio of momentum transfer to the fermi momentum .    to obtain the cross section we square the amplitude and integrate over final momenta @xmath97 the terms @xmath98 involve the spectator nucleon and will be normalized to one .",

    "the extension to higher energies @xmath170 will reveal the significance of additional resonances , especially those with large inelasticities , because they may reveal characteristics for the transition to the inelastic region where multi - pion production is important .      the support of the `` bundesministerium fr bildung , wissenschaft , forschung und technologie '' , bonn under contract 05ht1pea9 is gratefully acknowledged .",
