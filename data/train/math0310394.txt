    "since the advent of quantum groups , and in particular of the notion of a quantised universal enveloping algebra of a semisimple lie algebra in the end of the eighties , their theory has been applied to the construction of link invariants .",
    "the main idea behind all approaches comes from the observation that , in the current terminology , they are ribbon hopf algebras @xcite , which implies that their category of finite dimensional representations is a ribbon category , with trivial associativity constraints . in the pioneering work of freyd and yetter , cf .",
    "@xcite , it was observed that the ( ribbon ) tangles form a ribbon category which is universal in the class of all strict ribbon categories .",
    "this framework gives us a knot invariant for any ribbon hopf algebra and any finite dimensional representation of it , as observed in the construction of reshetikin and turaev s functor defined in @xcite .",
    "a limitation of the constructions above is that they are not directly applicable to the case of infinite dimensional representations of ribbon hopf algebras .",
    "this is because they involve taking traces or the use of coevaluation maps , which are difficult to define in the infinite dimensional context .",
    "however , one is forced to consider knot invariants associated with infinite dimensional representations when generalising to invariants associated with unitary representations of non - compact groups .",
    "this kind of representation appears in the context of @xmath2-quantum gravity and chern - simons theory with non - compact groups .",
    "see for example @xcite,@xcite,@xcite , @xcite , @xcite or @xcite",
    ". it would thus be important to define @xmath0-valued knot invariants associated with representations of this kind .",
    "the aim of this paper , which continues @xcite , is describe a possible path for doing this",
    ". we shall be mostly interested in the @xmath1 and @xmath3 cases .",
    "the @xmath4-adic quantised universal enveloping algebras of semisimple lie algebras are usually easier to deal with in the context of infinite dimensional representations . in this article",
    "we shall restrict to them . in this case",
    "there are various different variants of the construction of quantum knot invariants .",
    "some of them can be used in the infinite dimensional case , for example , laurence s universal @xmath5 knot invariant or the kontsevich universal knot invariant . roughly speaking ,",
    "given a ( complex semisimple ) lie algebra and an @xmath6-invariant non - degenerate symmetric bilinear form on it , they will yield a knot invariant which take values in the algebra of formal power series over the centre of @xmath7 , the universal enveloping algebra of @xmath8 .",
    "it is called the universal @xmath7-knot invariant .",
    "the main idea behind the construction of non - compact group knot invariants is the following .",
    "suppose we have a representation @xmath9 of the lie algebra @xmath8 in some vector space @xmath10 , which we do not assume to be finite dimensional .",
    "we can always lift it to a representation , also denoted by @xmath9 , of the enveloping algebra of @xmath8 . in some cases it can happen that any element of the centre of @xmath7 acts in @xmath10 as a multiple of the identity .",
    "such representations thus define an algebra morphism from the centre of @xmath7 to @xmath0 , a central character of @xmath7 .",
    "they are usually called representations which admit a central character .",
    "this type of @xmath8-module arises naturally in lie algebra theory .",
    "some examples would be the cyclic highest weight representations of a semisimple lie algebra .",
    "notice they are infinite dimensional if the weight is not integral .",
    "it is a well established fact that the central characters of them exhaust all central characters of @xmath7 if @xmath8 is complex semisimple .",
    "another context where representations which admit a central character appears is the context of unitary irreducible representations @xmath11 of real lie groups @xmath12 in complex hilbert spaces @xmath10 .",
    "more precisely , it is possible to prove that the induced representation @xmath13 of @xmath14 in the space of smooth vectors of @xmath10 under the action of @xmath11 admits a central character .",
    "here @xmath8 denotes the lie algebra of @xmath12 .",
    "it is called the infinitesimal character of @xmath11 .",
    "any central character of @xmath7 can be used to evaluate the universal @xmath7 knot invariant .",
    "this will then yield a knot invariant with values in the space of formal power series over @xmath0 .",
    "obviously , one price we have to pay when we consider infinite dimensional representation of @xmath8 will then be , in general , the need to stick to representations of @xmath8 that admit a central character and links with one component ( knots ) . in this article",
    "we propose to consider this kind of knot invariant in the context of irreducible unitary representations of @xmath1 and @xmath3 .",
    "notice that as they are non - compact lie groups they admit infinite dimensional irreducible unitary representations .    as mentioned before , in the semisimple lie algebras context the central characters of the highest weight representations exhaust all central characters of @xmath7 .",
    "moreover the value of these central characters in a central element of @xmath7 depends polynomially on the weight and it is determined by its values on the weights that define finite dimensional representations . in particular the knot invariants obtained by admitting infinite dimensional representations are not more powerful than the already known ones . in the power series level they are in an obvious sense analytic continuation of the usual quantum groups knot invariants .",
    "the fact finite dimensional representations suffice was also pointed out in @xcite .",
    "for example in the @xmath1 and @xmath3 context , these non compact knot invariants express out of a analytic continuation of the coloured jones polynomial to complex spins , termwise in the power series . in the former case",
    "this extension is immediate from the melvin - morton expansion of it .",
    "we called this extension the @xmath15-coloured jones polynomial .",
    "we need however an infinite set of finite representations to determine these knot invariants .",
    "it is unclear what happens in the non - semisimple lie algebras context .",
    "as we referred before , the definition of @xmath0-valued , that is numerical , knot invariants would be the most important for applications .",
    "so we want to say something about about the kind power series that we obtain .",
    "this will be one of the main subjects of this paper .",
    "a main result will be that for a large class of interesting unitary infinite dimensional representations of @xmath1 the associated series has a zero radius of convergence , at least in the case of torus knots .",
    "the same is true in the @xmath3 case .",
    "notice that this does not happen in the case of finite dimensional representations , the case in which there is no problem in defining numerical knot invariants .",
    "however , in the context of torus knots , they define borel summable series .",
    "this means there is a natural way to find analytic functions of which these power series are asymptotic expansions . also , that the uncertainty in process of re - summation is reduced to a numerable , in this case finite , set of functions , differing by rapidly decreasing terms .",
    "it would be interesting to analyse what this uncertainty means .",
    "this re - summation realises an analytic extension of the coloured jones polynomial of torus knots to complex spins , in the context of numerical knot invariants rather than only termwise in the power series , that is , of the actual values of the coloured jones polynomial . in the general case of an arbitrary knot and a unitary representation of @xmath1 or @xmath3 it is possible to prove that the series obtained are of gevrey type @xmath16",
    "this is a necessary condition for borel summability and permits us to define a weaker process of re - summation up to exponentially decreasing functions .",
    "it is an open problem whether the process of borel re - summation of the @xmath15-coloured jones polynomial works for any knot .",
    "we recall the definition of the algebra of chord diagrams , which is the target space for the kontsevich universal knot invariant . for more details see for example @xcite or @xcite .",
    "both references contain almost all the material considered in this section .",
    "a chord diagram is a finite set @xmath17 of non intersecting , cardinality 2 subsets of the oriented circle , modulo orientation preserving homeomorphisms .",
    "the subsets @xmath18 are called chords and are supposed to be pairwise disjoint .",
    "we usually specify a chord diagram by drawing it as in figure [ chord ] . in all the pictures we assume the circle is oriented counterclockwise .    for each @xmath19 ,",
    "let @xmath20 be the free @xmath0 vector space on the set of all chord diagrams with @xmath21 chords .",
    "that is the set of formal finite linear combinations @xmath22 , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 for any @xmath25 .",
    "consider the sub vector space @xmath26 of @xmath20 which is the subspace generated by all linear combinations of chord diagrams of the form displayed in figure [ 4 t ] .",
    "the three intervals considered in the circle can appear at an arbitrary order in @xmath27 .",
    "define for each @xmath28 , the vector space @xmath29 .",
    "we consider @xmath30 and @xmath31 .     a chord diagram with @xmath32 chords ]     @xmath32 term relations ]    let @xmath8 be a lie algebra over the field @xmath0 .",

    "the commutator is taken in @xmath35 , where @xmath7 denotes the universal enveloping algebra of @xmath8 .",
    "the map @xmath36 is the standard coproduct in @xmath7 .",
    "it verifies @xmath37 if @xmath38 .",
    "suppose we are given an infinitesimal r - matrix @xmath39 .",
    "write @xmath40 with @xmath41 .",
    "we have @xmath42\\tn b_j=0 $ ] , thus @xmath43 which resembles the @xmath44 relations just considered . given a chord diagram @xmath45 and an infinitesimal r - matrix @xmath46 it is thus natural to construct an element @xmath47 of @xmath7 in the following fashion , cf @xcite : start in an arbitrary point of the circle and go around it in the direction of its orientation .",
    "order the chords of @xmath45 by the order with which you pass them as in figure [ chords ] .",
    "each chord has thus an initial and an end point .",
    "then go around the circle again and write ( from the right to the left ) @xmath48 or @xmath49 depending on whether you got to the initial or final point of the @xmath50 chord .",
    "finally , sum over all the @xmath51 s .",
    "for example for the chord diagram of picture [ chords ] the element @xmath47 is : @xmath52 let @xmath45 be a chord diagram .",
    "a good feature about the element @xmath53 is :     enumerating the chords of a chord diagram ]    [ central ] let @xmath8 be a complex lie algebra and @xmath33 be an infinitesimal r - matrix of @xmath8 .",
    "let also @xmath45 be a chord diagram with @xmath21-chords . the element @xmath47 is well defined , that is it does not depend on the chosen point of the chord diagram @xmath45 , and it is a central element of @xmath7 .",
    "moreover the assignment @xmath54 descends to a linear map @xmath55 . here",
    "@xmath56 denotes the centre of @xmath7 .",
    "see for example @xcite or @xcite .    in general infinitesimal r - matrices in a lie algebra @xmath8",

    "concretely let @xmath59 and @xmath60 be a basis and a dual basis of @xmath8 with respect to @xmath57 .",
    "it is easy to show that the tensor @xmath61 is an infinitesimal r - matrix of @xmath8 .",
    "see also @xcite .",
    "the details of the definition of the kontsevich integral can be easily found in the literature .",
    "the classical reference is @xcite .",
    "for the framed kontsevich integral which we are going to use see @xcite or @xcite .",
    "we give a small review in the appendix .",
    "recall that the kontsevich integral @xmath62 is a framed knot invariant of the form @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath4 is a formal variable .",
    "we shall take the normalisation of @xmath62 for which the value on the unknot is the wheels element , cf @xcite .",
    "let @xmath8 be a lie algebra and @xmath39 an infinitesimal @xmath11-matrix of @xmath8 .",
    "we can consider the composition @xmath65 .",
    "this will yield a knot invariant with values in the algebra of formal power series in the centre of @xmath7 .",
    "therefore :    [ universalg ] let @xmath8 be lie algebra and @xmath39 an infinitesimal r - matrix in @xmath8 .",
    "there exists a framed knot invariant @xmath66 .",
    "it has the form : @xmath67 where @xmath68 .",
    "if @xmath8 is complex semisimple and @xmath39 is the infinitesimal r - matrix coming from its cartan - killing form in @xmath8 , then @xmath69 defines an analytic function from @xmath0 to a completion of @xmath7 , where @xmath7 is given the topology of convergence in its finite dimensional representations , cf .",
    "in other words , for any finite dimensional representation @xmath9 of @xmath8 in @xmath10 , the power series @xmath70 converges to a linear operator @xmath71 , in fact to a multiple of the identity , if @xmath10 is irreducible .",
    "the usual quantum group knot invariants are obtained by taking the trace of these operators .",
    "we will go back to these issues later .",
    "this article aims mostly to consider the case in which we admit infinite dimensional representations .",

    "notice @xmath10 is not assumed to be finite dimensional .",
    "we recall that unitarity means that the operator @xmath73 is a unitary for any @xmath74 .",

    "let @xmath77 denote the vector space of smooth vectors of @xmath11 .",
    "that is @xmath78 it is well known @xmath79 is dense in @xmath10 .",
    "differentiating @xmath11 at the identity of @xmath12 defines a map @xmath80 .",
    "it is possible to show that @xmath79 is invariant under @xmath8 and that @xmath13 is a honest representation of @xmath8 .",
    "it extends therefore to a representation , which we also call @xmath13 , of @xmath81 in @xmath77 . recall that @xmath10 is a complex vector space .",
    "suppose @xmath11 is a irreducible representation . in our context",
    "this means that @xmath10 has no closed invariant subspaces under the action of @xmath12 .",
    "the following ( non trivial ) result can be found in @xcite :    [ infinitesimal ] if @xmath10 is irreducible then any element of @xmath82 acts on @xmath79 under @xmath83 as a multiple of the identity operator .",
    "recall @xmath82 denotes the centre of the universal enveloping algebra of @xmath84",
    ". obviously if @xmath10 is a finite dimensional complex vector space then the theorem just stated is a consequence of schur s lemma and the unitarity condition is not needed .",
    "also it is in general possible to show directly that the above property is true for a large class of infinite dimensional representations , not necessarily unitary . amongst them",
    "are the representations of @xmath1 and @xmath3 which we are going to consider .",
