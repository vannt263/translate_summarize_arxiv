    "low cost global navigation satellite systems ( gnss ) are used for most mobile applications , whose localization accuracy are typically in the range of several meters . improving the localization accuracy of these widespread gnss without incurring additional",
    "hardware and infrastructure costs has motivated recent research activities on cooperative map matching ( cmm ) .",
    "cmm has been shown able to improve global navigation satellite system ( gnss ) positioning of a group of connected vehicles through estimation and correction of the common gnss localization error .",
    "since the error caused by atmospheric delay and satellite clock error is almost the same to all the vehicles in the same area , this common error can be estimated by matching the vehicle positioning results to a digital road map , assuming that all the vehicles travel on lanes . with a properly estimated common error ,",
    "the positioning of vehicles can be corrected , thus improving the localization accuracy .",
    "the improvement would largely depend on the quality of the common error estimation , which is determined by the cmm algorithm and the configuration of the road constraints .",
    "+ recently , two different cmm algorithms have been developed for gnss common error estimation problem , i.e. , a non - bayesian particle - based approach in rohani et .",
    "@xcite and a bayesian approach based on a rao - blackwellized particle filter in our previous work @xcite , @xcite .",
    "+ in contrast , the effects of road configuration on the common error estimation have not been reported in open literature .",
    "intuitively , in order to produce a good estimation of the common error , the road constraints should be rich enough so that common error in different directions can be detected .",
    "this richness is expected to be enhanced with the number of vehicles and the diversity of the road directions .",
    "+ in this work , the correlation between the estimation quality of the common error and the richness of the road constraints is quantified analytically .",
    "more specifically , the functional relationships between the mean square error of the common error estimation and the number of connected vehicles are derived under two different assumptions about road configurations .",
    "the results provide a guideline for the implementation of cmm and a foundation for the development of algorithms that intelligently select vehicles to include for maximal error reduction . + in the following sections , details of the derivation of the error bounds are presented with justification through monte carlo simulations . in section 2 , an analytic expression of the estimation error as a function of the road configuration and the non - common error is derived . in section 3 ,",
    "asymptotic formulas of the expectation of the estimation error with respect to gaussian distributed non - common error are derived for uniformly or bernoulli distributed road directions .",
    "nonetheless , most of the results are derived under the assumptions of large number of vehicles and small non - common error . in section 4 ,",
    "simulation results are presented to demonstrate and justify the applicability of the theoretical results to realistic scenarios where both the number of connected vehicles and the non - common error are finite . in section 5 , the contributions and conclusions are summarized .",
    "in this section , we propose a framework of vehicle positioning within a reference road framework to facilitate the analytic investigation .",
    "the gnss measurement will be decomposed into four components and one estimator of the common error will be formulated and the corresponding estimation error will be represented as an integral depending on the non - common error and the road constraints .",
    "+        the coordinate of gnss positioning of the @xmath0-th vehicle can be decomposed into superposition of the coordinate of a point on the corresponding lane center , the deviation of the vehicle from the lane center ( yellow arrows ) , the common error ( red arrows ) and the non - common error ( black arrows ) as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ notation ] .",
    "the blue and red dots represent the true positions and the gnss positioning , respectively .",
    "this relationship can be expressed mathematically as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the gnss positioning of the @xmath0-th vehicle , @xmath3 is the closet point on the center of the lane from the vehicle , @xmath4 is the deviation of the vehicle coordinates from @xmath3 , @xmath5 is the gnss common localization error , @xmath6 is the gnss non - common localization error including receiver noise error and multipath error and @xmath7 is the number of connected vehicles .",
    "+ the fact that all the vehicles travel on the roads can be expressed as a set of inequalities @xmath8 in reality , the geometry of the road sides can be so complicated that the constraints can not be expressed analytically .",
    "but frequently , the road sides can be approximated as straight lines such as those shown in fig .",
    "[ notation ] . in these cases , the constraint functions",
    "@xmath9 have simple analytic forms @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the dot product operator , @xmath12 is the unit vector normal to the lane center point towards outside of the road and @xmath13 is the half width of the lane .",
    "+ alternatively , ( 2 ) can be interpreted as the feasible set of the common error given the gnss positioning and the non - common error .",
    "the non - common error is unknown , however , to the implementation of cmm .",
    "thus , an approximation of the feasible set by neglecting the non - common error is used instead of the exact feasible set , which is @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 a point estimator of the common error can be taken as the average over the approximate feasible set @xmath17 , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the dummy integration variable and @xmath20 is the area element . + the estimation error of the common error is of practical interest , which can be evaluated as @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 eq .",
    "( 8) and ( 10 ) states that the estimation error equals to the geometric center of the intersection of the road constraints perturbed by the composite non - common error @xmath24 .",
    "+ it has been shown by experimental data that the gnss non - common error can be well approximated as gaussian random variable in @xcite .",
    "the safety pilot dataset collected in ann arbor shows that statistically the deviations from the lane center also obey gaussian distribution . as a result ,",
    "the composite error @xmath24 is a gaussian random variable .",

    "can be established .",
    "in this section , we derive the asymptotic decay of the mean square error with respect to the number of vehicles in two typical cases of the road configuration , whose examples are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig ] . in the first case ,",
    "the road configuration is modeled as cross roads where the roads are either parallel or orthogonal . in the second case ,",
    "it is modeled as randomly oriented roads where the direction angles obey a uniform distribution .      in the first case",
    ", it is assumed that each road is parallel to one of the two orthogonal axes of the global reference frame . as a result",
    ", the direction angles @xmath25 of the vehicles relative to the reference frame belong to a set with four elements : @xmath26 this case can be viewed as a simplified model for the urban areas where most roads are orthogonal to each other .",
    "+ invoking ( 8) , the square error can be expressed analytically as @xmath27 where @xmath28 are the largest projections of the composite non - common error on each of the four normal vector : @xmath29 @xmath30 are the numbers of vehicles traveling in each of the four directions .",
    "+ if all the @xmath31 are independent and identically distributed , then according to the fisher - tippett - gnedenko theorem @xcite , the limit distribution of @xmath32 for large @xmath33 is gumbel distribution whose cumulative distribution function is given by @xmath34 moreover , the leading order of the normalization constants @xmath35 and @xmath36 are related to the variance of the gaussian distribution @xmath37 through @xcite @xmath38 using the property of gumbel distribution , the expectation of @xmath39 with respect to @xmath32 can be evaluated : @xmath40&=\\frac{\\pi^2}{24}\\sum_{j=1}^4\\beta^2_j+\\frac{1}{4}[\\mu_1-\\mu_3+\\gamma(\\beta_1-\\beta_3)]^2\\\\   & + \\frac{1}{4}[\\mu_2-\\mu_4+\\gamma(\\beta_2-\\beta_4)]^2 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is the euler - mascheroni constant . + with the assumption that all the four @xmath33 are large number of the same order and using the asymptotic formulas ( 15 ) , it can be readily shown that the first term in ( 16 ) is of @xmath42 and the following two terms are of @xmath43 .",
    "thus , the leading order asymptotic approximation is @xmath44\\sim\\frac{\\pi^2\\sigma^2}{48}\\sum_{j=1}^4\\frac{1}{log(n_j)}.\\ ] ]      in the second case , each direction angle is assumed to be randomly distributed within @xmath45 . in addition , it is assumed that the non - common error is small enough such that ( 8) can be linearized with respect to the non - common error : @xmath46 where @xmath47 @xmath48 @xmath49^t,\\ ] ] and @xmath50 @xmath51 is a @xmath52 matrix whose components are related to the geometric quantities of the road constraints . + the condition under which the linearization ( 18 ) is valid is @xmath53 where @xmath13 is the half width of the lane .",
    "+ with the assumption that each non - common error obeys independent gaussian distribution with zero mean , i.e. , @xmath54 , the expectation of the square error is @xmath44=e^2_0+\\frac{1}{s^2_0}tr(l^tc^tcl ) , \\label{24}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is the cholesky decomposition of the joint gaussian covariance matrix . + eq .",
    "( [ 24 ] ) is quite useful in practice as it implicitly provides a measurement of the road configurations . given any road configurations specified by @xmath56 and @xmath51 , the mean square error can be evaluated .",
    "an optimization technique can be developed to select the best road configuration so as to optimize the localization accuracy .",
    "on the other hand , the theoretical value of this equation is demonstrated through the derivation of asymptotic error decrement shown as follows .",
    "+ as both @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath51 depends on the road direction angles @xmath58 , @xmath59 is also a random variable .",
    "it can be shown that the expectation of @xmath59 with respect to @xmath60 is of @xmath61 ( see appendix ) .",

    "in this section , simulation results are presented to justify the validity of the asymptotic formulas derived in section 3 .",
    "the expectations are calculated by averaging over 5000 samples of @xmath39 .",
    "each sample value for the orthogonal road case is calculated through two approaches .",
    "one approach is the analytic formula ( 12 ) , and the other approach is a monte carlo integration where the proposal distribution is a two - dimensional uniform distribution . besides , the number of vehicles in each direction is the same . for the uniformly random road angle case , each sample value of @xmath39",
    "is calculated by the monte carlo integration .",

    "[ f2 ] shows the comparison of the orthogonal road case .",
    "the asymptotic formula is in good agreement with the numerical results as the number of vehicles increases .",
    "the results using the two numerical approaches are also different , which should be caused by the random error resulted from the monte carlo integration used to calculate @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , the one that uses ( 8) is expected to be closer to the underlying true expectation . compared with this result , the asymptotic formula slightly overestimates the error",
    ". this difference may be the result of the fact that the convergence to the gumbel distribution is rather slow @xcite .",

    "[ f4 ] shows the corresponding difference between the asymptotic formula and the simulation results using monte carlo integration .",
    "the difference reaches its minimum around @xmath66 and increases with the further increase of @xmath7 .",
    "this result can be expected for the following two reasons .",
    "first , the asymptotic formula is derived for large @xmath7 . as a result",
    ", the difference at small @xmath7 should be significant .",
    "second , the linearization ( 18 ) based on the small non - common error assumption ( 23 ) eventually becomes invalid for fixed @xmath37 and increasing @xmath7 .",
    "the analytic results shown in section 3 do not apply to the large non - common error case because the approximate feasible set described by ( 4 ) may be an empty set .",
    "nonetheless , this problem can be addressed by assigning a weight to each hypothesis of the common error according to its compatibility with the road constraints . the weighted road map approach proposed by rohani et .",
    "al . is applied to generate simulation results because of its simplicity for implementation .",
    "+        fig .",
    "[ rf5 ] shows the error decrement in the two different cases of road configuration when the non - common error variance is large .",
    "as can be observed from the figure , the slope of the decrement curve in the uniformly distributed road case is steeper than that corresponding to the orthogonal road case .",
    "this result is expected from intuition as in the former case , the road angles are more diverse , thereby , providing more constraints to correct the gnss bias .",
    "this can also be understood from another point of view from the mathematical expression ( [ eq8 ] ) .",
    "the estimation error is equal to the deviation of the geometric center enclosed by the road constraints .",
    "as the directions of the road angles become diverse , there is a large probability that the error in different directions cancels out . as a result ,",
    "the expectation of the error become small . in contrast , if there exists some dominant directions , the expectation of the error would be large as the probability that the error cancels out becomes small . +",
