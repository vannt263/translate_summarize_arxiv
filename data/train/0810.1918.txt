    "since the smoothed - particle hydrodynamics method was proposed by @xcite  and @xcite thirty years ago it has become a powerful and very successful method , which is routinely used worldwide to model systems with complicated geometries .",
    "in particular the combination of the sph method with hierarchical algorithms , addressed to efficiently organize data and calculate gravity , have led to a robust and reliable schemes able to handle complex geometries in three dimensions . in spite of these achievements",
    "little effort has been put in the development of axisymmetric applications of the method",
    ". however , a large body of interesting applications has to do with systems which have axisymmetrical geometry such as accretion discs , rotating stars or explosive phenomena ( i.e. novae or supernovae events ) provided the ignition takes place in a point - like region at the symmetry axis .",
    "the interaction between the gas ejected during a supernova explosion and the circumstellar matter has been extensively simulated using cylindric coordinates either with eulerian @xcite or sph @xcite codes . in inertial confinement fusion ( icf )",
    "studies the collapse of the deuterium capsule induced by laser ablation can be also approximated using two - dimensional hydrodynamics .",
    "axisymmetrical hydrocodes are also useful to conduct resolution studies of three - dimensional codes just by imposing an initial configuration with the adequate symmetry . in these cases a comparison between the results obtained using the 3d - hydrocode and the equivalent ,",
    "although usually better resolved , 2d simulation could help in numerical convergence studies .",
    "several formulations of different complexity have been proposed to handle with the axisymmetric version of sph . while the first algorithms were in general very crude , i.e. @xcite and references therein , neglecting the so called hoop - stress terms , there were also more consistent sph approximations , @xcite .",
    "recently more complete formulations were given by @xcite and by @xcite .",
    "in particular the scheme devised by omang et al . includes not only the hoop - stress terms but also a consistent treatment of the singularity line defined by the symmetry axis .",
    "the algorithm proposed by these authors relies in the use of interpolative kernels especially adapted to the cylindrical geometry .",
    "although the resulting scheme is robust , being able to successfully pass several test cases , it has the numerical inconvenient that an elliptical integral has to be solved numerically at each integration step for each particle .    in this paper",
    "we propose a new formulation of the axisymmetric sph technique which preserves many of the virtues stated by @xcite and @xcite , being also able to handle the singularity axis in an efficient way . in our scheme",
    "there is no necessity to modify the interpolating kernel ( we use the cubic spline polynomial ) .",
    "instead , taking advantage of the symmetry properties across the z - axis , we found several analytical correction factors to the physical magnitudes .",
    "these correction factors only affect particles moving at a distance from the z - axis lesser than @xmath0 , being @xmath1  the smoothing - length parameter . for the remaining particles the sph equations are identical to those given in @xcite .",
    "in addition , we also give expressions for the artificial viscosity and a new heat conduction algorithm , which takes into account the hoop - stress contribution .",
    "finally , we propose an original method to handle gravity within the sph paradigm which is consistent with the gridless nature of that particle method .",
    "the text is organized as follows : the basic fluid equations written in axisymmetric coordinates , and corrected from axis effects when necessary , are provided in section 2 . in section 3",
    "we add useful physics to these equations consisting of an artificial viscosity term to handle shock waves ( section 3.1 ) , an expression for thermal conduction ( section 3.2 ) and an algorithm addressed to calculate self - gravity within the axisymmetric hypothesis ( section 3.3 ) .",
    "section 4 is devoted to describe and discuss five test cases aimed at validating the proposed scheme .",
    "finally the main conclusions of our work as well as some comments about the limitations of the developed scheme and prospects for the future are presented in section 5 .",
    "an elegant approach to the axisymmetric euler fluid equations was given by @xcite who derived the sph form of these basic equations using the minimal action principle ( see monaghan 2005 and references therein for the history of variational sph ) .",
    "the resulting expressions for mass , momentum and energy conservation written in the cylindrical coordinate system @xmath2 are :    @xmath3    @xmath4    @xmath5    where @xmath6  is the two - dimensional density of the i - particle , @xmath7  its velocity , @xmath8  the interpolating kernel and the remaining symbols have their usual meaning .",
    "the differential operator @xmath9 is a cartesian operator written in the @xmath10   plane of cylindric coordinates .",
    "the first terms on the right in the r - component of equation ( 2 ) and equation ( 3 ) are called the hoop - stress terms .",
    "they are geometrical terms which arise from the nabla operator written in cylindrical coordinates .",
    "the smoothing - length parameter , @xmath1 , is usually taken as the local resolution of the sph .",
    "equations ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) along with the adequate equation of state ( eos ) are the starting point to carry out numerical simulations of fluid systems with axisymmetric geometry . as boundary conditions we consider reflective ghost particles across the z - axis and open flow at the outer limits of the system . for the @xmath11-particle  with",
    "coordinates @xmath12  and velocity @xmath13  it is defined its reflective @xmath14-particle by taking @xmath15 , @xmath16  and @xmath17 . thus position ,",
    "velocity as well as other magnitudes such as density or internal energy of reflective particles are updated at each step not using the sph equations but from the evolution of real particles . even though the use of reflective boundary conditions is not strictly necessary in axisymmetric geometry it is useful to correctly represent the density and its derivatives near to the singularity axis .",
    "one of the major causes of inaccuracy of axisymmetric sph is the treatment of particles that get close to the symmetry axis . unlike spherically symmetric systems where there is only one singular point , just at the center , here there is a singular line at @xmath18 .",
    "a good treatment of particles moving close to the z - axis is especially relevant for implosions such as the collapse of a self - gravitating system or in inertial confinement fusion studies .",
    "as far as we know only @xcite have consistently addressed this problem . in that paper",
    "the interpolation kernel is modified according to the particular geometry of the system , spherical or cylindrical .",
    "the resulting scheme does not have singularity problems when the particles approach the axis .",
    "however the resulting kernel does not have an analytical expression and must be calculated at any step for each particle using a numerical integration .",
    "recently , useful fitting formulae were proposed by @xcite  but still involving a large number of operations which slows the calculation .",
    "an alternative way to handle with the symmetry axis , without modifying the basic sph scheme given above , is to calculate correction terms to equations ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , which become significant only close to the z - axis .",
    "these correction factors arise because of the limited capability of standard kernels to interpolate accurately non linear functions . in the particular case of the two - dimensional density , @xmath19 ,",
    "its profile is not longer linear in the axis neighbourhoods due to the presence of reflective particles .",
    "usually the errors are small and the interpolation is precise to second order in @xmath1 . unfortunately , close to the symmetry axis errors grow and density and other physical magnitudes are not well reproduced , as it will be shown below . the detailed derivation of these corrections are given in appendix a , leading to the following equations :    @xmath20    where @xmath21  is the new , improved , two - dimensional density and @xmath22  is a correction factor which , for the cubic - spline kernel , reads ( appendix a ) :    @xmath23^{-1}\\qquad 0<\\zeta_i < 1    \\cr\\cr    \\left[\\frac{8}{15}\\zeta_i^{-1}-\\frac{1}{3}+\\frac{4}{3 } \\zeta_i- \\frac{2}{3}\\zeta_i^2+\\frac{1}{6}\\zeta_i^3-\\frac{1}{60}\\zeta_i^4\\right]^{-1}\\cr   \\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad { \\mathrm for } \\qquad\\qquad 1<\\zeta_i<2        \\cr\\cr    1 \\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad \\zeta_i > 2 \\cr\\cr }    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    being @xmath24 . a plot of @xmath25  and its first derivative is given in fig .  1 .",
    "hereafter a hat will be placed over any corrected , and therefore , `` true '' magnitude .    and @xmath26  and their derivatives as a function of @xmath27 .",
    "the cubic spline interpolator kernel was assumed to compute @xmath28  and @xmath26  ( appendix a ) .",
    "]    at this point it is useful to introduce a couple of algebraic rules :    @xmath29    @xmath30    which are valid as long as , close to the axis , the magnitude @xmath31  has a weak dependence in the r - coordinate .",
    "in particular , setting @xmath32   in equation ( 7 ) leads to equation ( 4 ) .    to find the influence of the above correction factor in the momentum equation , equation ( 2 ) ,",
    "its is better to write the components of that equation in differential form . for the radial component",
    "we have :    @xmath33    when @xmath34  the particle approaches the z - axis where symmetry enforces the last term on the right to vanish for spherically symmetric kernels .",
    "the first term on the right is the hoop - stress term which should be exactly balanced by the central term when @xmath34 , because the acceleration should be zero at the symmetry axis .",
    "nevertheless , this does not happen unless the correction factor @xmath25  is taken into account during the calculation of the gradient of @xmath35 :    @xmath36    similarly , for the z - component in the momentum equation :    @xmath37    where now we simply have :    @xmath38    the resulting momentum components in discrete sph form can be obtained from equations ( 6 ) to ( 11 ) :    @xmath39-\\\\   \\left(\\frac{2\\pi p_i~r_i}{\\widehat\\eta_i\\times f_1^i}\\right ) ~\\frac{df_1^i(\\zeta_i)}{dr_i}\\qquad\\qquad\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath40    the value of pressure in equations ( 12 ) and ( 13 ) must be computed through the eos using the corrected 3d - density , @xmath41 .",
    "note that close to the axis the summatories in equations ( 12 ) and ( 13 ) are non symmetric with respect any pair of particles .",
    "still the r - component of the momentum is conserved , even for those particles with @xmath42 , because of the imposed reflective boundary conditions . in the z - axis",
    "the momentum is not exactly conserved within the band defined by @xmath42 . in general such loss",
    "is small , affecting a tiny amount of mass . in most of the tests described below total momentum",
    "was very well preserved .",
    "a similar approach can be worked out to improve the energy equation :    @xmath43    where :    @xmath44+\\left[v_{z}\\frac{\\partial\\widehat{\\eta}}{\\partial z}-\\frac{\\partial\\widehat{(\\eta v_z)}}{\\partial z}\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    being @xmath45 ;  @xmath46  and @xmath47 .",

    "thus , they can easily be computed and stored in a vector without introducing any significant computational overload .",
    "examples about the use of the axisymmetric fluid equations with axis corrections , equations ( 4 ) , ( 12 ) , ( 13 ) and ( 17 ) in practical situations will be provided and discussed in section 4 .",
    "as in three dimensions the treatment of shocks in the axisymmetric approach also relies in the artificial viscosity formalism .",
    "nonetheless , there are a variety of artificial viscosity algorithms suited for sph to choose at .",
    "we have adapted the standard recipe by @xcite to the peculiarities of the 2d - axisymmetric hydrodynamics . in that approach the artificial viscosity",
    "gives rise to a viscous bulk and shear pressure which is added to the normal gas pressure only in those regions where the particles collide ( in the sph sense  ] ) . in three dimensions",
    "it is defined a magnitude , @xmath52 :    @xmath53    which is closely related to the viscous pressure . in equation",
    "( 19 ) @xmath54  and @xmath55  are constants of the order of unity , @xmath56  and @xmath57   are the average of density and sound speed of @xmath11  and @xmath58- particles , and @xmath59  is :    @xmath60    here @xmath61 , @xmath62  and @xmath63  avoids divergences when @xmath64 .",
    "the scalar magnitude @xmath52  has a linear and a quadratic term .",
    "the linear component mimics bulk and shear viscosity of fluids whereas the quadratic one is important to avoid particle interpenetration in strong shocks .",
    "the easiest way to write the contribution of the artificial viscosity to the momentum and energy equations in an axisymmetric code is by changing the mass of the particles according to their distance to the z - axis : @xmath65 .",
    "the viscous acceleration becomes :    @xmath66    taking @xmath67  in equation ( 19 ) the explicit dependence on @xmath68   in the viscous acceleration formula is removed ,    @xmath69    where @xmath70  is :    @xmath71    being @xmath59 :    @xmath72    expressions ( 22),(23 ) and ( 24 ) account for the cartesian part of viscosity .",
    "it has been shown ( i.e. monaghan 2005 ) that , in the continuous limit , these expressions become the navier - stokes equations provided shear and bulk viscosity coefficients are taken @xmath73  and @xmath74  respectively . however , in cylindric geometry the stress tensor which appear in the navier - stokes equations also includes a term proportional to velocity divergence through the so called second viscosity coefficient .",
    "therefore an extra term containing the magnitude @xmath75  must be added to @xmath70  to account for the convergence of the flux towards the axis .",
    "this new term , @xmath76 , should fulfill a few basic requirements : 1 ) far enough from the axis it should be negligible , 2 ) must vanish for those particles with @xmath77 , 3 ) for homologous contractions the viscous acceleration related to that term should be negligible , 4 ) it should be symmetric with respect particles @xmath11  and @xmath58  to conserve momentum . an expression satisfying the four items",
    "is :    @xmath78    where @xmath79 . the resulting viscous acceleration is :    @xmath80    where @xmath81 note that for a homologous contraction @xmath82  meaning @xmath83 , hence the gradient of @xmath84  vanishes fulfilling the third requirement above . in diverging shocks",
    "@xmath76  vanishes and only the cartesian part of viscosity matters .",
    "therefore constants @xmath85  should remain close to their standard values @xmath86  and @xmath87 .",
    "all simulations presented in this paper were carried out using @xmath88 . in converging shocks",
    ", however , the effect of @xmath76  is to increase artificial viscosity introducing more damping in the system",
    ".    equation ( 26 ) , has the advantage that is formally similar to that used in three - dimensions .",
    "therefore one can benefit from the well known features of the artificial viscosity in 3d , which can be directly translated to the axisymmetric version ( several useful variations of equation ( 19 ) can be found in @xcite ) . in particular , it is straightforward to write the corresponding energy equation :    @xmath89    which has to be added to the right hand of equation ( 3 ) .",
    "the differential equation describing the evolution of the specific internal energy due to conductive or diffusive heat transfer is :    @xmath90    being @xmath91  the conductivity coefficient which in turn is a function of the local thermodynamic state of the material .",
    "the main difficulty to write equation ( 28 ) in a discrete equation suitable to sph calculations is the existence of a second derivative .",
    "it is well known that second and higher order derivatives often pours a lot of numerical noise in disordered systems .",
    "a way to avoid that shortcoming is to reduce one degree the order of the derivative by taking the integral expression of equation ( 28 ) , @xcite .",
    "it has been shown ( see , for example , @xcite ) that in 3d - cartesian coordinates the following expression allows to approximate a second derivative using only the first derivative of the interpolation kernel :    @xmath92    where @xmath93  represents any scalar magnitude and @xmath94 . an useful algebraic relationship which allows to write",
    "the heat transfer equation in sph notation is :    @xmath95\\ ] ]    combining equations ( 29 ) and ( 30 ) the usual form of the heat transfer equation used in 3d - sph studies is obtained .",
    "a mathematical expression for the heat transfer equation in axisymmetric sph was given by @xcite .",
    "however in the derivation of equation ( 29 ) there was not taken into account the @xmath96   term which naturally arises whenever the divergence of a vector is estimated in cylindric coordinates :    @xmath97    it will be shown in section 4.1 how the inclusion of the first term on the right of equation ( 31 ) improves the quality of the results in a particular test .    to obtain the adequate numerical approximation to equation ( 28 ) in axisymmetric sph we first make use of equation ( 30 ) :    @xmath98    then , using equation ( 31 ) to develop each term inside the brackets and using the 2d - operator @xmath99  instead of @xmath100  the following expression is obtained :    @xmath101    the magnitudes inside the brackets are the new terms related to the hoop - stress . in order to calculate the derivatives we make use of one of the golden rules of sph ( @xcite ) :    @xmath102    after a little algebra the following expression is obtained :    @xmath103    the presence of @xmath104   in the equation ensures that there is not heat flux between different parts of an isothermal system .",
    "note that the presence of the @xmath105  multiplier in the second term on the right side of equation ( 35 ) does not ensure complete conservation of the heat flux .",
    "however the total energy losses in the numerical test below simulating a thermal wave evolution were negligible .",
    "of course equation ( 35 ) can be symmetrized by taking the arithmetical mean @xmath106  instead of @xmath105  but in that case the evolution of the thermal wave was not so well reproduced . on another note equation ( 35 ) is compatible to the second principle of thermodynamics in the sense that heat always flows from high to low temperature particles . to demonstrate this",
    "let us take a pair of particles @xmath11  and @xmath58  so that @xmath107 . the second term on the right becomes negative because the scalar product @xmath108  is always negative .",
    "the first term on the right is negative for @xmath109  and positive for @xmath110 . as the heat flow from particle @xmath11  must be negative",
    "the only trouble could come if @xmath110 .",
    "nevertheless , even in that case heat flux is still negative if @xmath111  because the sign of the second term in equation ( 35 ) prevails .",
    "thus @xmath111  is a sufficient condition tho get the right sign of heat flux between any pair of particles . as @xmath112",
    "such condition is fullfiled in a large domain of the system",
    ". the exception could be the axis vicinity where @xmath113 .",
    "nevertheless in that case symmetry enforces the heat flux to be negligible .",
    "therefore we expect a good behaviour of the heat flux arrow although there are not excluded marginal violations if resolution is poor and strong heat fluxes were present close to @xmath18 .",
    "a way to ensure complete compatibility to the second principle of thermodynamics is to make zero the flux between any pair of particles violating such principle .",
    "current 2d - hydrocodes often handle gravity by solving the poisson equation or , if the system remains nearly spherical , by simply computing the enclosed lagrangian mass in a sphere below the point and using the gauss law .",
    "methods based on the poisson solvers have proven very useful to find gravity in eulerian hydrodynamics where the same grid used to compute the motion of the fluid elements can be used in the calculation of gravity .",
    "however they have the difficulty to set suitable outer boundary conditions owing to the infinite range of the gravitational force . in lagrangian gridless methods such as sph",
    "it is better to use the direct interaction among mass particles themselves to calculate gravity .",
    "the evaluation of the gravitational force through direct particle - particle interaction leads to an @xmath114 scheme that makes the computation feasible only for a limited number of particles .",
    "when @xmath115 is high , as it is frequent in three - dimensional calculations , one has to rely in approximate schemes such as those based in hierarchical - tree methods , @xcite .",
    "however hierarchical methods do not work efficiently in the 2d - axisymmetric approach because what we call particles are in fact rings of different size .",
    "usually the ratio between the radius of these rings and the distance to the point where the force needs to be computed is too large to permit the multipolar approach to evaluate the gravitational force .",
    "fortunately , the good resolution usually achieved in 2d using a moderate number of particles makes the direct calculation affordable .        according to fig .",
    "2 the gravitational force per unit of mass in a point p of coordinates @xmath116 ( being z the symmetry axis ) due to the ring is :    @xmath117\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the meaning of the symbols is that shown in fig .  2 .",
    "the gravitational force acting onto the i - particle can be easily written as :    @xmath118\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath119 , and @xmath120 is the mass of the particle associated to the j - ring .",
    "integrals @xmath121 and @xmath122 are defined as follows :    @xmath123    @xmath124    where the parameter @xmath125 is : @xmath126",
    "although the elliptical integrals @xmath121 and @xmath122 can not be solved analytically they can be tabulated as a function of the parameter @xmath125 given by equation ( 40 ) .",
    "it is straightforward to show that the value of @xmath125   is always inside the interval @xmath127 , although for @xmath128 the integrals @xmath121 and @xmath122 become divergent .",
    "therefore the gravity force can be calculated in an efficient way using the following recipe :    \\1 ) build a table for @xmath121 and @xmath122 as a function of @xmath125 . a table with @xmath129 rows with values @xmath130 evenly spaced is sufficient .",
    "\\2 ) to increase the speed do not interpolate from that table but take just the row which is closest to the actual value of @xmath125 calculated using equation ( 40 ) .",
    "\\3 ) note that parameter @xmath125 is symmetric with respect any pair of particles , @xmath131 , thus @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "therefore only half of the interactions have to be calculated .",
    "if the algorithm is optimized the scheme is able to provide the exact value of the gravity for several dozens of thousand particles . in many applications using @xmath134 particles in two - dimensions",
    "is enough to guarantee a good resolution .",
    "another physical magnitude of interest is the gravitational potential at the position of the i - particle .",
    "it is easy to show that the contribution of the j- ring to the gravitational potential is :    @xmath135    where , @xmath136    again the same recipe given above to compute the force can be used to efficiently calculate @xmath137 . on the other hand",
    "the exact computation of the gravitational potential allows to calculate the gravitational force by taking the gradient of @xmath138 at any point . @xmath139    a more suitable form for sph calculations",
    "can be obtained using :    @xmath140    which , according to equations ( 7 ) and ( 9 ) , leads to the following discrete equation :    @xmath141    where @xmath28  is the corrective term given by equation ( 5 ) and @xmath142  the unit vector in the r - axis .",
    "this second route to calculate the gravitational force is computationally more efficient than evaluating equation ( 37 ) because the gradient of the potential is a local quantity which can be calculated in the same part of the algorithm devised to compute the density or other magnitudes in the hydrocode .",
    "it has the additional advantage that the resulting force is smoothed by the sph interpolation procedure avoiding divergences when a pair of particles become too close . in fig .",
    "5 ( bottom - right ) there are shown the gravity profile calculated using equation ( 45 ) ( filled triangles ) and the pressure gradient term ( continuum line ) along a sun - like polytropic structure . as it can seen the fit is satisfactory except at the surface where the pressure gradient is overestimated . although using the potential to calculate gravity is not as exact as the direct force calculation it is a factor two faster because there is a lesser amount of numerical operations in the double loop of the gravity routine .",
    "needless to say , the simplicity of the proposed scheme makes the parallelization of the gravity computational module straightforward . in this case calculations with @xmath143  particles could become feasible even for desktop computers with multiple core processors .      as an initial check of the gravity algorithm resulting from equation ( 45 )",
    "we have simulated the free - fall collapse of a uniform density sphere of mass m@xmath144  and radius r@xmath144 .",
    "it is a standard test which has the following analytical solution :    @xmath145-\\left(\\frac{r}{r_0}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\left(1-\\frac{r}{r_0}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\right\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath146  is the initial position of the fluid element and @xmath147 .",
    "the free - fall time @xmath148  is :    @xmath149    we built an uniform sphere with m@xmath150=1 m@xmath151  and r@xmath144=r@xmath151  filled with @xmath152  particles settled in a square lattice .",
    "gas pressure and artificial viscosity were set to zero so that the structure collapsed under gravity force .",
    "afterwards the implosion was followed until the elapsed time was close to @xmath148 .",
    "although restricted to spherical symmetry the free - fall test is quite demanding because the evolution is highly non linear , allowing for a good check of both the gravity module and the integration scheme ( see next section for details ) . in fig .  3 there",
    "is represented the evolution of a particle initially located at @xmath153 . as we can see its evolution is in good agreement to the analytical solution given by equation ( 46 ) .    , @xmath154  in all cases .",
    "]    a question of great interest in astrophysics is the capability of axisymmetric sph codes to handle rotation .",
    "the topic is far from trivial because in general it involves transport of angular momentum via viscous coupling .",
    "even though a complete answer to that question is beyond the scope of the present work there is a particular case that can be handled with the present scheme : the fast implosion ( or expansion ) of a self - gravitating rotating cloud . if the characteristic dynamical time is much shorter that the viscous coupling time we can impose angular momentum conservation around the symmetry axis to solve this problem .",
    "the strategy is simply to add the centrifugal force which arises from finite angular momentum to the r - component of gravity . as an example we have simulated the collapse of a slender rotating cylinder of gas with uniform density centered at the coordinate origin .",
    "the initial conditions are specified by the mass @xmath155  the radius @xmath156  and the length of the cylinder @xmath157 . if we suppose _ rigid _",
    "rotation the specific angular momentum of a mass point is given by @xmath158  being @xmath159  the initial angular velocity of the cylinder and @xmath146  the position of the fluid element at the initial time @xmath160 .",
    "angular momentum conservation demands @xmath161  so that the centrifugal force is @xmath162  which is added to the first component of gravity , calculated using equation ( 45 ) , to obtain an effective gravity value . as in the case of the spherical collapse we have taken @xmath163  and @xmath164  while the cylinder length was @xmath165 .",
    "the evolution of mass points were followed assuming two values for the angular momentum : 1 ) zero angular momentum and 2 ) @xmath166  where @xmath167  for which centrifugal force was a half of gravitational force at that position . in this case",
    "we have used a larger number of particles , @xmath168   to reduce boundary effects .    on the other hand , assuming @xmath169  and using the gauss - law it is possible to work out an analytical approach to the above scenario .",
    "the acceleration equation becomes :    @xmath170    where @xmath171  and @xmath172  is the value of gravity at @xmath173 . according to the gauss - law @xmath174 , but it is better to take @xmath172  directly from the sph simulation to ensure identical initial conditions in both calculations . the solution of equation ( 48 ) is :    @xmath175^{\\frac{1}{2}}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    which has to be solved numerically once @xmath146  and @xmath176  are specified .",
    "3 depicts the evolution of a particle initially located at @xmath177  without and with initial angular momentum as well as that obtained using the the analytical approach , equation ( 49 ) .",
    "the case with zero angular momentum led to the free fall of the mass element which was less violent than the spherical case owing to the lower initial density in the cylinder . as it can be seen in fig .",
    "3 the agreement between analytical and sph results is not as good as in the spherical case for @xmath178 .",
    "this is not surprising because boundary effects at cylinder edges progressively affects gravity at current particle test position and its evolution is very sensible to small variations of gravity force .    when angular momentum was added to the cylinder at @xmath179",
    "s the implosion of the structure slowed down . as commented above the amount of angular momentum",
    "was chosen to get a centrifugal force contribution at @xmath167   equal to a half of gravity force at that position . as we can see in fig .",
    "3 the result of the simulation is in better agreement to the analytical approach than the pure free - fall case .",
    "this is because the evolution is driven not only by gravity and errors due to the finite size of the rotating cylinder are not affecting so much the outcome as in the non rotating case . at @xmath180",
    "t@xmath181  the fluid element begins to be centrifugally sustained , in good match to the analytical estimation .",
    "in this section we describe and discuss in detail five test cases addressed to validate the computational scheme developed in the precedent sections .",
    "the first test involves the propagation of a thermal discontinuity born at the symmetry axis .",
    "it is a well known calculation which has an analytical solution to compare with .",
    "three calculations : the gravitational collapse of a polytrope , the implosion of a homogeneous capsule , and the wall shock problem deal with implosions of spherically symmetric systems . although , at first glance , such constraint looks too restrictive in fact it is not , because the spherical symmetry is not a natural geometry for axisymmetrical systems described with cylindrical coordinates .",
    "any deviation from the pure spherical symmetry during the implosion will trigger the growth of hydrodynamical instabilities .",
    "therefore the preservation of the symmetry during the calculation is an important feature to be added to mass , momentum and energy conservation .",
    "finally the last test was devoted to simulate the collision of two bubbles of fluid along the z - axis .",
    "the initial models were calculated by mapping the spherically symmetric profiles into a 2d distribution of particles settled in a square lattice .",
    "the mass of the particles was conveniently adjusted to reproduce the density profile of the one - dimensional model .",
    "for example , masses proportional to the @xmath182coordinate of the particle were taken to obtain models with constant density .",
    "reflective boundary conditions using specular ghosts particles were imposed across the z - axis .",
    "the eos was that of an ideal gas with @xmath183  and radiation in the test devoted to the collapse of a polytrope , and only gas ideal for the other tests . we have used and adaptive smoothing length parameter @xmath184  which was updated at each time step to keep a constant number of neighbours @xmath185  within a circle of radius @xmath0 .",
    "the interpolating kernel was the cubic polynomial spline .",
    "numerical integration of sph fluid equations was performed using a two - step centered scheme with second order accuracy .",
    "it is worth to mention that in the free - fall test of a homogeneous sphere the velocity was updated using the xsph variant of @xcite to avoid particle penetration through the symmetry axis . in this",
    "particular test mass points at low radius are proner to cross z - axis because pressure and viscous forces were artificially set to zero .",
    "therefore any residual value of gravity can impel particles located close to the center towards unphysical @xmath186  values .",
    "we have updated only the @xmath187-component of velocity using the following expression :    @xmath188    where @xmath189  is the new , smoother , velocity .",
    "the parameter @xmath190  was taken variable :    @xmath191    where @xmath192 . using xsph variant to move particles enforces @xmath193  when @xmath34 , making it difficult for particles to cross the axis .",
    "lets consider the problem relative to the propagation of a thermal wave moving through an uniform static medium .",
    "this is a well known test , addressed to check the capability of the numerical scheme to handle thermal discontinuities .",
    "the initial model was a sample of 57908 particles evenly distributed in a square lattice so that the density was @xmath194  .",
    "a @xmath195-like jump in internal energy originates a a thermal wave front which evolves according to :    @xmath196    where @xmath197  is the specific heat and @xmath14  is the thermal conductivity .",
    "the following set of values were taken : @xmath198  ergs.@xmath199/g , @xmath200  erg.g@xmath201 and @xmath202  @xmath203.s@xmath201 .",
    "the initial internal energy profile was that given by equation ( 52 ) for @xmath204  s , which was taken as the initial time ( t=0 s ) for the sph simulation .",
    "the evolution of the thermal signal is then controlled by the heat conduction equation , equation ( 35 ) .        in fig .  4 ( left ) there",
    "is represented the thermal profile at different times . as we can see the coincidence with the analytical solution given by equation ( 52 ) is excellent .",
    "as time goes on the peak of the signal and its slope decreases due to heat diffusion .",
    "the initial discontinuity is rapidly smeared out by thermal diffusion and soon a thermal wave is born which travels to the right , equalizing the internal energy of the system . at t=5 s the profile of the internal energy of the gas is already quite flat and the system is not far from thermal equilibrium . at that moment",
    "total energy was conserved up to @xmath205 . in fig .  4 ( right ) it is shown the evolution of the thermal profile which results when",
    "the first term on the right side in equation ( 35 ) is removed . as we can see the evolution is no longer reproduced by the sph calculation .",
    "therefore it is of utmost importance to include that term , especially in those calculations dealing with strong thermal gradients close to the symmetry axis .",
    "the second test involves a catastrophic , albeit highly unprobable , astrophysical scenario .",
    "a spherically symmetric sun - like polytrope was suddenly unstabilized by removing the @xmath206  of its internal energy so that the structure collapsed under the gravity force . at some point",
    "the collapse is halted and an accretion shock forms which manages to eject part of the mass of the polytrope .",
    "several episodes of recontraction followed by mass loss ensued until the star sets in a new equilibrium state .",
    "even though that particular scenario is not realistic it contains several pieces of physics of great interest because accretion shocks and pulsational instabilities are ubiquitous in astrophysics . as the initial model has spherical symmetry we expect it to be preserved during the implosion and further bounce .",
    "the conservation of the symmetry is a demanding test for multidimensional hydrocodes in those cases where there are episodes of strong decelerations . in the particular case of axisymmetric hydrodynamics",
    "the higher numerical noise close to the symmetry axis may trigger the growth of convective instabilities .",
    "an additional advantage of considering an spherically symmetric initial model is that the evolution calculated with the sph code can be checked using standard lagrangian hydrodynamics in one dimension .",
    "the initial model was a @xmath207",
    "m@xmath151  spherically symmetric polytrope of index @xmath208 .",
    "the radius was set equal to @xmath207  r@xmath151  so that the central density was @xmath209  .",
    "once the 1d equilibrium model was built it was mapped to a 2d distribution of 51408 particles located in a rectangular lattice .",
    "the mass of the particles were conveniently adjusted to reproduce the density profile of the polytrope . in fig .",
    "5 there are shown the profiles of density and gradient of pressure at t=0 s calculated using the 2d - sph . as we can see",
    "the inclusion of the corrective term @xmath28  given by equation ( 5 ) in the momentum equation is crucial to get good enough profiles of these quantities to guarantee the stability of the initial model .",
    "the polytrope was perturbed by reducing the temperature everywhere in a 20% of its equilibrium value .",
    "afterwards the evolution was followed with the 2d - sph from the implosion until the first pulsation and compared to that obtained by a 1d lagragian hydrocode .",
    "the main features of the model and a summary of the results are shown in table 1 .    [ cols=\"<,<,>,>,>,>,<,>,<,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     soon after the model was destabilized the polytrope started to collapse . at t@xmath210",
    "s a maximum of the central density @xmath211  was reached .",
    "a similar maximum of @xmath212  was obtained using one - dimensional hydrodynamics .",
    "the profiles of density and radial velocity at different times are depicted in fig .",
    "as we can see the evolution calculated in one and two dimensions is very similar and , in general , both profiles are in good agreement . at",
    "our last calculated time , t@xmath213  s , the shock is already breaking out the surface of the polytrope .",
    "shortly after that time some mass is ejected from the surface and , as the 1d calculation shows , the star embarks in a long pulsational stage until a new equilibrium state is achieved",
    ".    therefore the numerical scheme was able to handle with this scenario .",
    "the algorithm devised to calculated the gravity using equation ( 45 ) , which relies in the direct interaction between rings ( fig .",
    "2 ) , did a good job .",
    "the artificial viscosity module was also able to keep track with the shocks although , at some stages , the post - shock region showed a small amount of spurious oscillations .",
    "these numerical oscillations in the velocity profile are clearly visible in fig .  6 at t@xmath213  s. in the last three columns of table 1",
    "there is information concerning momentum and energy conservation at t@xmath213  s , our last calculated model .",
    "there was an excellent momentum conservation , close to machine precision , whereas the conservation of energy was more modest , @xmath214 .",
    "on the other hand the spherical symmetry was also quite well preserved during the calculation . on the negative side",
    "we find that the two - dimensional calculation was systematically delayed with respect its one - dimensional counterpart .",
    "the relative shift in time remained approximately constant , around @xmath215% , during the evolution .",
    "for the sake of clarity the elapsed times shown in fig .",
    "6 were that of the sph simulation and the times of the one - dimensional evolution were conveniently chosen to fit the 2d profiles .",
    "probably the most unfavourable case to numerical simulation is that of a strong implosion as it currently appears , for example , in icf studies .",
    "thus , our third test deals with the implosion of a homogeneous spherical capsule of size @xmath216   cm and density @xmath217  , induced by the ( artificial ) ablation of its surface .",
    "the ablation of the capsule was triggered by the instantaneous deposition of energy in the outermost layers of the capsule , which had their internal energy increased in the same proportion .",
    "the energy deposition profile was taken linear from @xmath218  cm to @xmath219  cm so that the internal energy at @xmath216  cm was a factor @xmath129  higher than that at s=0.8 cm .",
    "below s=0.8 cm a flat profile of the internal energy was assumed .",
    "the rocket effect caused by the evaporation of the surface layers forms a strong shock wave which compresses the interior of the capsule . the convergence of the shock at the center of the sphere increases the temperature and the density in a large factor , much larger than that obtained in the previous section dealing with the collapse of a solar - like polytrope .",
    "the main features of the model are shown in table 1 and fig .",
    "7 . the profiles of density and radial velocity at several times are depicted in fig .  7 which also shows the profiles obtained using a 1d - lagrangian hydrocode ( continuum lines ) with the same physics and identical initial conditions .",
    "the evolution of the capsule can be summarized as follows .",
    "soon after the initial energy deposition a pair of shock waves moving in opposite directions appear ( profiles at t=0.0044 s in fig .",
    "7 ) . as the reverse shock approaches the center",
    "it becomes stronger owing to the spherical convergence ( profiles at t=0.0087 s in fig .",
    "once the maximum compression point is reached , @xmath220  at t@xmath221   s , the wave reflects .",
    "when t=0.0150 s the density peak has already dropped to 7 and most of the material of the capsule is expanding homologously . at t=0.0264",
    "s the reflected wave reaches the initial radius of the capsule , @xmath216  cm . at that time",
    "the material of the capsule is rather diluted @xmath222  and the radial velocity profile consist of two homologously expanding zones separated by a transition region at @xmath223  cm . at the last calculated time , t@xmath224   s , the outermost layer of the sphere has expanded until @xmath225  cm , ten times the original size of the capsule . as we can see the 2d - simulation match quite well the 1d results .",
    "according to table 1 the central density at the moment of maximum compression is almost the same in both calculations .",
    "the conservation of momentum is very good , close to machine precision ( columns 5 , 6 of table 1 ) , while numerical energy losses remained lesser than 1% ( last column in table 1 ) .",
    "however , an inspection of fig .",
    "7 reveals that the spherical symmetry was not so well preserved as in the collapsing polytrope .",
    "now the implosion of the capsule was more violent and the deceleration phase before the bounce was more intense , making easier the growth of instabilities . even though the initial model had good spherical symmetry , the initial distribution of the particles in a regular lattice acts as a source of the so called hour - glass instability .",
    "such instability is related to the existence of preferred directions along the grid through which the stress propagates . as in the previous test",
    "another point of conflict between the 1d and the 2d calculations is that the 2d evolution is a bit delayed with respect its one - dimensional counterpart .",
    "for instance , the times at which the maximum central densities are achieved are @xmath226  s and @xmath227  s , so that the relative difference was around @xmath228% . such percent level of discrepancy remained approximately constant during the calculation .",
    "the wall heating shock test , @xcite , was especially devised to analyze the performace of algorithms addressed to capture strong shocks .",
    "basically the wall heating shock test consists in making a sphere or a cylinder implode by imposing a converging velocity field . for these geometries",
    "there is an analytical approach to the evolution of density and thermodynamical variables as a function of the initial conditions .",
    "the results of numerical codes can be compared with the analytical solution to seek the best method or to choose for optimal combination of parameters .",
    "it is well known that schemes which rely in artificial viscosity have difficulties to handle the wall heating shock test .",
    "the reason is that artificial viscosity spreads the shock over a 3 - 4 computational cells , which induces an unphysical rise of internal energy ahead the shock . in the case of",
    "spherical or cylindrical geometry the artificial increase in internal energy is magnified by the geometrical convergence of the shock .",
    "therefore the wall shock problem represents a strong challenge for the axisymmetric sph .",
    "brookshaw ( 2003 ) carried out a similar test with the sph code but far from the symmetry axis .",
    "in particular he modelled the impact of two supersonic streams of gas , obtaining good profiles for density and internal energy except in a small region around the collision line .",
    "the density profile showed a dip at that region while a large spike was seen in the internal energy . both , the dip and the spike are numerical artifacts which can be smoothed out by using an artificial heat conduction term to spread the excess of internal energy and reduce the error around the contact discontinuity .    to check the performance of our code we have settled n=50334 particles in a square lattice . as in the previous tests the mass of the particles was conveniently crafted to reproduce an spherical homogeneous system with initial radius @xmath216  cm .",
    "the initial conditions were taken as in @xcite : @xmath229  ; @xmath230   cm.s@xmath201 ; @xmath231  erg.g@xmath201 .",
    "the exact solution at time t=0.6 s for @xmath232  is shown in fig .  8 ( dashed line ) .",
    "the analytical profile is characterized by a constant post - shock state until distance @xmath233  cm followed by a rapid decrease in density and internal energy . in the shocked zone density",
    "reach a constant value @xmath234   while internal energy was @xmath235  erg.g@xmath201 .",
    "the combination of such harsh initial conditions plus geometrical convergence leads to an strong implosion , even harder than that described in the ablated capsule test . in fig .",
    "8 ( left ) there are shown the spherically averaged profiles of density and internal energy obtained using sph at t@xmath236  s. the error bars in the plot give the @xmath237  dispersion of these variables with respect its mean value in the shell . as we can see the resulting profiles compare poorly with the analytical results in the shocked region .",
    "in addition the dispersion is high , especially at low radius , a clear signature for the presence of numerical noise .",
    "close to the axis there is the typical artificial combination of a dip ( in density ) and spike ( in internal energy ) .",
    "the maximum density value was @xmath238  which is around 10% lower than the exact value .",
    "such bad quantitative agreement was not unexpected because it is common to all hydrodynamic codes which use the artificial viscosity scheme . a way to improve",
    "the quality of the simulation is to allow for heat conduction in the hydrocode to remove the thermal energy spike and to sharpen the shock .",
    "recipes to obtain an artificial conductivity coefficient in sph to better handle the wall shock problem were given by @xcite  and @xcite .",
    "for this calculation we have adapted the recipe of monaghan to the features of the axisymmetric sph defining an artificial conductivity for the i - particle :    @xmath239    where @xmath240  is the symmetrized specific heat and @xmath241   is the artificial viscosity parameter given by equation ( 24 ) . according to equation ( 53 ) @xmath242 , which can be used directly in equation ( 35 ) to compute the artificial heat flux . as shown in fig .",
    "8 ( right ) the inclusion of the artificial heat conduction term leads to a significant improvement of the results .",
    "not only the profound dip in density in the central region has been removed but the simulation shows much lesser dispersion around the averaged values of density and internal energy .",
    "however the maximum peak in density still remains @xmath243  below the theoretical value . in this respect",
    "the only way to improve the results is sharpening the shock either by using adaptive kernels , @xcite , @xcite , or by increasing the number of particles .",
    "our last test is specifically addressed to check momentum conservation in a very anisotropic situation : the supersonic collision along the z - axis of two homogeneous spherical clouds of gas with different size and mass .",
    "the size and mass of the spheres are @xmath244  cm ; @xmath245  g and @xmath246  cm ;  @xmath247  g respectively so that their density is @xmath248  .",
    "the biggest sphere is at rest with its center located at @xmath249  cm while the smaller one is centered at @xmath250  cm moving upwards with velocity @xmath251  cm.s@xmath201 .",
    "the initial internal energy of both spheres was @xmath252  erg.g@xmath201  whereas eos obeys an ideal gas law with @xmath183 .",
    "the corresponding initial mach number was @xmath253  thus the impact is supersonic .",
    "the number of particles in each sphere was @xmath254  and @xmath255  respectively .        in fig .",
    "9 there are represented several snapshots showing the density evolution during the collision process .",
    "as can be seen the large mass contrast leads to the complete deformation of the smaller sphere which , in the end transfers most of its initial momentum to the larger bubble .",
    "information about the evolution of the center of mass of each bubble as well as that of the whole system is provided in fig .  10 . according to figs .",
    "9 and 10 the collision history can be roughly divided in three stages : 1 ) for @xmath256  s , the incoming smaller cloud deforms while a large fraction of its kinetic energy went into internal energy around the collision region .",
    "a shock wave was launched into the larger bubble , 2 ) between @xmath257  s the total internal energy did not change so much . at @xmath204",
    "s the velocity of the center of mass of both structures was practically the same , 3 ) for @xmath258  s the energy stored as internal energy is again restored to the system . at larger times the velocity of the smaller bubble became negative while the bigger cloud acquired a positive velocity to preserve total momentum . at our last time @xmath259  s the interaction between both structures is coming to an end .",
    "10 also shows that , in spite of the large changes in the velocity of each bubble , the velocity of the center of mass of the whole system remained unaltered .    in the last row of table 1 there",
    "are shown several magnitudes related to momentum and energy conservation .",
    "conservation of linear momentum during the interaction was monitored through the displacement of the center of mass of the system . at the final time ,",
    "@xmath259  s , the deviation of the center of mass position with respect the value expected from @xmath260  was much larger than that shown in the other tests .",
    "still the relative error in the position of the center of mass once the collision has practically ceased was @xmath261 .",
    "angular momentum was very well preserved , almost to machine precision .",
    "total energy was conserved to @xmath262  relative to the initial kinetic energy of the system .    in an attempt to understand the origin of the discrepancy relative to momentum conservation in the z - direction we ran exactly the same model but this time symmetrizing equation ( 13 ) ( multiplying the term @xmath263   by @xmath264 ) . there were no significant changes .",
    "we conclude that strict total momentum conservation in the z - direction was not possible because of the interaction between real and reflected particles .",
    "such interaction took place in a small band around the symmetry axis , acting as an external force which modified momentum of real particles .",
    "however that force can not be balanced by an opposite force acting in the left semiplane because , in the z - direction , reflected particles were obliged to move exactly in the same way real particles did .",
    "therefore if strong directional anisotropies appear in the vertical displacements of the mass points some degree of violation in momentum conservation is unavoidable .",
    "eventually momentum conservation should improve as the number of particles increase because the amount of mass settled in the axis vicinity is lower .    of the center of mass of each bubble and of the system .",
    "subscripts 1 and 2 refers to the smaller and larger bubble respectively .",
    "evolution of total kinetic and internal energy is also given . ]",
    "despite the success of the smoothed particle hydrodynamics technique to handle gas - dynamics problems in three dimensions little effort has been invested to develop two - dimensional ( axisymmetric ) applications .",
    "this work intends to fill that gap by solving many of the problems often invoked in connection with sph in cylindric coordinates .",
    "these are the treatment of the singularity axis , the handling of shock and thermal waves and , in many astrophysical scenarios , an accurate procedure to calculate the gravitational force .",
    "our general philosophy in developing the mathematical formalism was to remain as close as possible to the cartesian scheme so that many of the results of the standard sph in three dimensions can be extrapolated with minimum changes to the axisymmetric version .",
    "starting from the fluid euler equations given by @xcite we have obtained analytical corrections to those particles which move close to the singularity axis .",
    "these corrections appear as multiplicative factors to the different terms of the fluid equations .",
    "such multiplicative factors become equal to one when @xmath265  ( fig .",
    "1 ) so that there is no need to calculate them beyond that distance and the method is computationally efficient .",
    "once the basic formalism was built we added several pieces of physics which make the scheme well suited to handle a large variety of problems .",
    "first of all an extension of the 3d standard artificial viscosity to the 2d - axisymmetric realm was devised , equations ( 23 ) , ( 24 ) and ( 25 ) .",
    "the artificial viscosity includes the convergence of the flow towards the symmetry axis via linear and quadratic terms proportional to @xmath266 $ ]   ( being r the distance to the symmetry axis ) .",
    "these terms arise because the diagonal part of the stress tensor in cylindric coordinates includes the divergence of the flow velocity .",
    "however the cartesian part of the divergence was already present in the standard formulation given by equations ( 22 ) and ( 23 ) giving rise to bulk and shear viscosity .",
    "therefore only the axis converging part of velocity divergence , proportional to @xmath267  has been added .",
    "the resulting viscous force @xmath268   has two terms : @xmath269  ( cartesian ) and @xmath270  ( axis converging part ) which are calculated using similar expressions , equations ( 23 ) , ( 25 ) involving four constants @xmath85  ( @xmath269 )  and @xmath271  ( @xmath270 ) .",
    "the axis converging part of viscosity will be of importance only for strong implosions .",
    "although in the simulations reported in this paper we have taken @xmath272  and @xmath273  there could be other plausible combinations worth to explore .",
    "a similar approach was used to built the conductive transport equation .",
    "starting from the expression given by @xcite we have added a new term that accounts for the divergence of the temperature gradient in the axis neighborhoods . even though the resulting expression was not totally antisymmetric it led to a satisfactory energy conservation in the tests described in sections 4.1 and 4.3 .",
    "finally the set of equations was completed with the inclusion of self - gravity . in axisymmetric geometry",
    "it is better to rely in the direct , ring to ring , interaction to compute gravity . such procedure , although in general computationally expensive",
    ", has several advantages : 1 ) it does not rely in any sort of grid and gives the exact value of the gravitational force , 2 ) the calculations are feasible for a moderate number of particles ( i.e. around @xmath274  in serial desktop machines ) which often suffice in many 2d simulations 3 ) the scheme is clear and extremely simple making it straightforward to parallelize .",
    "the algorithm devised to compute gravity was able to keep track the free - fall collapse of an homogeneous sphere as well as of an homogeneous rotating cylinder . given an initial amount of rotation the evolution of any point of the cylinder was handled by imposing angular momentum conservation around the symmetry axis .",
    "five test cases aimed at validating the computational scheme were considered .",
    "each of them intended to check a particular physics item : heat conduction ( sects .",
    "4.1 and 4.4 ) , shock waves ( sect . 4.3 and 4.4 ) and gravity ( sects . 3.3.1 and 4.2 ) .",
    "momentum conservation was specially checked in sect .",
    "because for the most part the initial configurations had spherical symmetry the preservation of that symmetry during the collapse and further expansion of the system was taken as an indicator of the general ability of the scheme to handle large changes in the spatial scale .",
    "it was also possible to make detailed comparisons of the results with those obtained either from analytical calculations , as in the case of the thermal wave propagation , or from one - dimensional simulations carried out using standard lagrangian hydrodynamics .",
    "the results , obtained using several dozen thousand particles , were in good agreement with the analytical expectations and to the 1d simulations .",
    "additionally there was an almost perfect momentum conservation while numerical energy losses always remained lesser than @xmath275 .",
    "the spherical symmetry was well preserved although a slight deviation was observed in the capsule implosion test , partially due to the so called hour - glass instability ( owing to the initial setting of the particles in a lattice ) and , despite the corrective terms , to the effect introduced by the singularity axis onto the approaching particles . a similar but",
    "probably more demanding test was the wall heating shock problem , dealing to the spherically symmetric implosion of a supersonic stream of gas .",
    "although the results are not as good as those obtained with other methods which do not use artificial viscosity , they are comparable with one - dimensional calculations with similar resolution relying in artificial viscosity schemes .",
    "however the results improved when artificial heat conduction , calculated using equations ( 35 ) and ( 53 ) , was switched - on .",
    "as discussed in sect .",
    "4.5 a weak point of the formulation is that the inclusion of reflective particles in the scheme could degrade total momentum conservation in the z - direction .",
    "however good momentum conservation , much better than energy conservation for instance , is expected in those systems in which the velocity field is not too anisotropic . if strong momentum exchange along the z - axis is expected , as in the test described in sect .",
    "4.5 , then momentum will be preserved to a similar level as total energy .    as a conclusion we can say that the formulation of the axisymmetric sph given in this paper is a solid tool to carry out simulations using that particle method .",
    "however there are still a number of unresolved issues which deserve further development .",
    "one of them is how to build good initial models without settling particles of different mass in regular lattices .",
    "this is important because ordered lattices introduce spurious instabilities in the system and the mixing of particles with very different masses could lead to numerical artifacts .",
    "another point of difficulty has to do with artificial viscosity , because it introduces too much shear viscosity in the system damping the natural development of hydrodynamical instabilities .",
    "the new term @xmath76  given by equation ( 25 ) of artificial viscosity comes from the diagonal of the stress tensor so its contribution to shear viscosity is probably lower than that of @xmath70 . in any case",
    "the artificial viscosity formulation given in this work is so close to the standard formulation that it could benefit from future advances in the much better studied three - dimensional sph .",
    "finally , the simple test about the implosion of a rotating cylinder indicates that axisymmetric sph is able to handle rotating structures but more work needs to be done to incorporate angular momentum transport into the numerical scheme .",
    "the authors want to thank the many corrections and suggestions made by the referee . in particular the referee suggested the inclusion of the noh test and the bubble collision scenario described in sects .",
    "4.4 and 4.5 and inspired the discussion about rotation given in sect .",
