    "in the last decades there have been a lot of numerical and theoretical works on interacting bose gas in lattice or continuous models.@xcite the recent advance in the realization of optical lattices , where bosons are trapped on particular lattice sites and the interaction and the hopping parameters can be tuned continuously , has also opened a novel possibility to understand fundamental questions of many - body quantum mechanics , that can be experimentally checked with high degree of reliability and reproducibility .",
    "an important example is the realization of a mott insulating state in a system with strong on site repulsion.@xcite    in this work we want to focus on an even more fundamental question , that is related to the concept of superfluidity .",
    "this concept deserves some discussion and generalization when considering a lattice model .",
    "the following discussion is not at all academic because , at present , lattice models can be realized with laser optical techniques , and the gedanken experiment we will discuss in the next section can be in principle realized experimentally .",
    "we consider a one dimensional bose - hubbard model in the ring shown in fig.([circ ] ) .",
    "the lattice ring is rotating with given angular velocity @xmath0 with respect to the environment @xmath1 which is considered here at rest for simplicity . indeed in actual experiments the environment is usually rotating , but this does not change the forthcoming analysis , because our choice is just related to the reference frame .",
    "the hamiltonian can be generally written as : @xmath2 where @xmath3 creates a boson in the ring with momentum ( @xmath4 ) @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the dispersion of bosons in the lattice ( e.g. @xmath7 for nearest neighbor hopping ) , periodic @xmath8 and even @xmath9 , @xmath10 any two - body interaction term depending only on the relative distance between bosons [ e.g. @xmath11 for the boson - hubbard model , where @xmath12 , thus is unaffected by the velocity @xmath13 of the rotating frame .",
    "the total momentum in the reference system where the ring is at rest is given ( modulo @xmath14 ) by : @xmath15 and the momenta @xmath16 are obviously quantized according to the known relation @xmath17 .",
    "strictly speaking in a lattice only the operator @xmath18 is defined , but this does not change the forthcoming analysis . in the forthcoming sections",
    "@xmath19 will be indicated by @xmath20 for simplicity .",
    "the rotating sites are decoupled from the environment @xmath1 , whereas the bosons can interact weakly with it , but are allowed to occupy only the site positions of the rotating ring.,title=\"fig : \" ]    the experimental issue to detect superfluidity is related to the following experiment .",
    "after an experimentally accessible time ( the ring rotating and the environment at rest ) will all the bosons be at rest relative to the environment ( or equivalently will they move with an appropriate velocity with respect to the ring lattice positions ) ?",
    "if this is not the case we can speak about supefluidity , a fraction @xmath21 of all bosons decouple from the rest and remains uncoupled from the environment .",
    "it is clear from the previous definition that superfluidity is related to the coupling to the environment ( otherwise any finite momentum will be conserved for ever in the ring ) .",
    "nevertheless it is possible to obtain a result that is independent of the interaction between the environment and the ring if the following three conditions are satisfied :     i ) the thermodynamic limit @xmath22 is considered ,     ii ) a finite temperature is given and the low temperature limit is considered _ after _ that the thermodynamic limit is employed ,    \\iii ) the model hamiltonian provides a stable phase in the low energy spectrum , namely stable for small perturbation of the hamiltonian itself .",
    "the first two conditions are easily understood : only within the finite temperature canonical distribution @xmath23 the momentum @xmath18 can equilibrate even without considering the coupling with the environment , and the probability of each eigenstate of the isolated ring @xmath20 is given correctly by @xmath24 , for a macroscopic system ( @xmath25 ) , just when the coupling environment - ring is negligible with respect to the bulk @xmath26 .",
    "the coupling environment - ring is used only to equilibrate the system and obtain a property - superfluidity- that characterizes the system itself and not its coupling with the environment ( otherwise we could talk about  superfluidity of capillary tubes  and not superfluidity of e.g. @xmath27 ) . in order to achieve this consistent definition",
    "the hamiltonian itself describing the system without environment has to define a stable phase of matter , namely a phase stable for small physical perturbations of the hamiltonian , otherwise , clearly , the realization of a particular phase can obviously depend on the coupling environment - system .    in cold atoms experiments @xmath26 , the number of sites ,",
    "can be as large as @xmath28 and the thermodynamic limit at fixed temperature represents a realistic limit .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the physical zero temperature limit is highly non trivial in this respect .",
    "if we take first @xmath29 and then @xmath30 superfluidity _ can not be tested _ because the lowest eigenstates of the hamiltonian with non zero current have also a non trivial complex momentum @xmath31 that is obviously conserved and no relaxation process can occur to the real ground state in a finite size system .",
    "if we explicitly consider a coupling system - environment as in@xcite to induce current relaxation , it is clear that this process should be essentially equivalent to work in the thermodynamic limit with an arbitrary small temperature .",
    "we conclude therefore that the correct limit for detecting zero temperature superfluidity is to take first @xmath32 and then @xmath33 .",
    "this order of the limits leads indeed to the definition of superfluidity that is independent of the coupling system - environment , whenever this is possible , namely when ( iii ) is satisfied .",
    "in this section we revisit some basic notions in thermodynamics , by introducing the basic quantities that define the superfluid density .",
    "the following considerations are completely general and hold in any dimensionality d with minor changes , that we omit in the following .    in the thermodynamic equilibrium it is easy to show that the free energy :    @xmath34    does not depend on @xmath35 for discrete values of @xmath36 , with @xmath37 being an arbitrary integer . for large size @xmath26 this limitation is very weak because we can reach any finite velocity @xmath35 for @xmath38 as , in this limit , the discrete velocity values merge in a continuum . indeed for each @xmath26 a simple unitary transformation , commuting with the two - body interaction @xmath10 : @xmath39 removes the velocity @xmath40 from @xmath20 .",
    "this follows immediately after simple application of canonical commutation rules , implying that @xmath41 = -\\delta_{r , r^\\prime } a_r$ ] , so that @xmath42 , and finally @xmath43 is easily obtained ( @xmath44 in the kinetic energy ) .    using the above relation",
    ", it follows that the free energy : @xmath45 does not depend on @xmath35 whenever @xmath46 , namely when @xmath47 is defined .",
    "notice that in the first step we have used the invariance of the trace under cyclic permutation .    from this relation",
    "we can expand the partition function in powers of @xmath35 because the mapping @xmath48 is just a shift of the finite size momenta and the kinetic energy of @xmath49 can be recasted in the following form : @xmath50 we thus obtain upon performing simple differentiations : @xmath51 where the brackets @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) denote the finite temperature averages @xmath54 on the hamiltonian of the rotating ring ( non rotating ring , i.e. with @xmath55 ) . strictly speaking the previous differentiation in the free energy",
    "is not allowed because the possible velocities are quantized @xmath56 otherwise the unitary transformation @xmath47 is not properly defined . in a more rigorous way one can indeed consider that : @xmath57 in the latter equation we can expand @xmath58 and use that @xmath59 in the canonical ensemble of the rotating ring because the current is odd under reflection and the hamiltonian @xmath20 is even for @xmath55 .",
    "this immediately implies the linear relation between the current flowing in the frame rotating with the ring and the corresponding velocity at thermal equilibrium : @xmath60 within  weak  assumptions on the average boson occupation in momentum space @xmath61 ( e.g. @xmath62 is finite ) that allows to neglect the @xmath63 term even for small but macroscopic velocities @xmath40 .",
    "it has to be remarked here that the fundamental relation ( [ relation ] ) is valid only at thermal equilibrium and this may be obtained only after an exceedingly large time .",
    "this is indeed the case when , for @xmath22 , superfluidity occurs . on the other hand",
    "whenever the relation ( [ relation ] ) is fulfilled the current flowing in the ring is just representing the condition of thermal equilibrium : all the bosons by scattering with the environment eventually converge to an equilibrium state characterized by no charge flow in the environment frame .",
    "we notice that a linear relation between the current and the velocity can be obtained within the linear response theory .",
    "the evaluation of @xmath64 for small @xmath35 is given by : @xmath65   v\\ ] ] where @xmath66 . and can be obtained by simple expansion of the trace with simple and standard manipulations .",
    "whenever the kernel @xmath67 relating the current response to an arbitrary small velocity is not equal to @xmath68 we will have a relation current velocity plotted in fig([curr ] ) .",
    "for any measurable finite velocity quantized as multiples of @xmath69 , there is no net current flow in the environment frame , implying that @xmath70 at equilibrium , as expected .",
    "however for unphysically small values of the current the linear response may have a finite slope as shown in fig.([curr ] ) .    [ curr ]   of the rotating ring displayed in fig.([circ ] ) .",
    "the linear behavior occurs in an irrelevant region with exceedingly small velocity , certainly not measurable for large @xmath26 , and in any case without any macroscopic current flowing in the environment frame.,title=\"fig : \" ]      we are arguing in the following that the situation displayed in fig.([curr ] ) is actually the common one for a superfluid ( @xmath22 finite temperature ) .",
    "the point is that in a superfluid , in order to obtain the equilibrium steady state solution where no net current is flowing in the environment frame , an exceedingly large time is necessary because an initial current can very slowly relax to the steady state . in order to understand this fact it is useful to remark that the experiments of superfluidity are usually done with time dependent velocity v ( e.g. a torsional pendulum@xcite ) . if the frequency @xmath72 is much larger than the inverse relaxation time of the current we can safely assume that linear response theory can be applied and we should obtain in this case a perfectly linear relation between the frequency dependent current and the frequency dependent velocity : @xmath73 for either small or macroscopically measurable velocities as shown in the fig.([curr ] ) .",
    "the situation is in some sense similar to the evaluation of the conductivity of a metal .",
    "the expectation value of the current in presence of a static field @xmath1 leads always to zero conductivity because at thermal equilibrium no net current can flow .",
    "indeed we have to take the appropriate limit , with a time dependent field and take @xmath71 after .",
    "this leads to the generally accepted kubo formula for the conductivity .    in the superfluidity experiment ,",
    "on the other hand , we have to consider the physical case when the relaxation time for the current becomes macroscopically large ( infinite for infinite size ) and the limit @xmath74 after the limit @xmath22 at finite temperature @xmath75 leads to : @xmath76 v= ( 1-\\rho_s/\\rho ) < k > v   \\label{basic}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the definition of superfluid density , being @xmath77 the total density of bosons .",
    "indeed whenever @xmath78 only a fraction of the particles @xmath79 can be interpreted to have relaxed to the steady state in an experimentally accessible time .",
    "it is important to emphasize that this definition of superfluidity is experimentally testable but is not necessarily related to broken symmetry . indeed in two dimensions , as well known , superfluidity can be detected@xcite and on the other hand there is no long range order at any finite temperature . whenever there is long range order the situation is indeed more conventional because the superfluid density is directly related to the helicity modulus of the order parameter@xcite",
    "in the free boson case , as shown in @xcite , it can be proved that @xmath21 coincides with the condensate fraction @xmath80 of particles that occupy the @xmath81 state with a macroscopic occupation .",
    "this calculation can be immediately generalized even for lattice models in any dimension @xmath82 .",
    "since the generalization is almost immediate we describe the basic steps in @xmath83 for convenience of notations and write down the explicit expression of @xmath21 as a function of @xmath82 only in the last equation .    for free bosons the current @xmath84 commute with the hamiltonian and the linear response kernel @xmath67",
    "is given by : @xmath85 in fact the hamiltonian , as well as @xmath84 ( [ defj ] ) , are diagonal in @xmath16 space @xmath86 @xmath87 , where in the latter expression we have for convenience removed the @xmath81 vector in the summation because @xmath88 for @xmath81 ( the derivative of an even function is odd in @xmath16 ) .",
    "following ref.@xcite , in order to evaluate eq.([free ] ) it is enough to compute the two body density matrix in momentum space : @xmath89\\ ] ] where @xmath90 $ ] is the free boson occupation at finite temperature , and @xmath91 is the chemical potential used to require a given density @xmath77 of bosons @xmath92 , where @xmath80 is just the condensate density . in this way",
    "the evaluation of @xmath67 can be readily performed and simplified , by using that i ) @xmath93 again because of the reflection symmetry ii ) as noted in ref.@xcite @xmath94 = -1/\\beta { d",
    "n^b_k \\over d   \\epsilon_k } $ ] : @xmath95 we can now take the appropriate @xmath38 limit to compute @xmath21 and @xmath77 by replacing the summation @xmath96 and obtain a closed form expression for @xmath21 ( a simple integration by part is also left to the reader ) : @xmath97 it is interesting that @xmath98 in this case , but there is superfluid density only when there is a non zero condensate fraction and the other way around .",
    "thus @xmath99 for @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the inverse bose - einstein transition temperature that is finite in 3d but is infinite in 1d and 2d .",
    "in principle we can take first the limit @xmath33 for the kernel @xmath102 at any fixed size @xmath26 .",
    "as we have emphasized before , this limit _ can not _",
    "test superfluidity and indeed is related to another physical quantity , the zero temperature drude weight as established by kohn long time ago@xcite : @xmath103 that distinguishes a metal from an insulator , but not a metal from a superfluid .    in the following the distinction between a bose - metal from a bose - superfluid is essentially analogous to the difference between a metal and a superconductor valid for electronic systems@xcite : superconductors are obviously metal in the sense of infinite zero temperature conductivity but they also possess the non trivial property that the current can flow basically forever without dissipation at any finite temperature below @xmath104 . clearly , within this definition ,",
    "if @xmath105 , we can speak about a bose - metal in the ground state because there is no measurable superfluid density for any @xmath106 .    in order to show that the limit @xmath107 before the thermodynamic limit is incorrect for the detection of superfluidity , it is enough to realize that , for free bosons , in the limit @xmath33 at fixed @xmath26 the kernel @xmath108 because the current commute with the hamiltonian and in the ground state @xmath109 so that @xmath110 decays exponentially to zero for @xmath33 due to the finite size gap @xmath111 of the first excited state with non zero current .",
    "thus we obtain that the drude weight for free bosons is always finite and equal to @xmath68 .",
    "thus @xmath112 in 1d and 2d even though at any _ finite _ temperature @xmath113 for @xmath38 , implying @xmath114 for any @xmath106 .    in our definition",
    "therefore , a free 1d or 2d bose gas , is not a superfluid but a bose metal .",
    "this bose metal however is too much idealized to be considered realistic because interaction is always present and it is known that an arbitrary small interaction changes the spectrum of the excitations from quadratic to linear in momentum , and condition iii ) for superfluidity is not satisfied .",
    "thus the issue of the present paper on whether bose metals can exist in a stable phase is not solved by the free boson example .",
    "bose metals should exist in nature only if a small physical perturbation of the hamiltonian does not change the qualitative features of the unperturbed phase .",
    "other definitions are known in the literature for a bose - metal@xcite , but appear much more restrictive definitions than the present one .",
    "it is fortunate that the problem has been already studied in 1d and we can use convincing results obtained in other contexts@xcite .",
    "the calculation of @xmath21 was done with the correct order of limits in @xcite . in this work",
    "the authors considered 1d - spinless fermions at half filling with nearest neighbor hopping , nearest @xmath115 and next - nearest neighbor @xmath116 repulsive interactions .",
    "this model , as well known , is equivalent to hard - core bosons with the same interaction coupling constants , because in 1d hard core bosons with nearest neighbor hopping are simply related to spinless fermion models with the same current - current response functions .",
    "the spinless fermion model , in the gapless phase , is relevant for our discussion and it was clearly found that indeed @xmath78 for @xmath106 as long as @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "however the authors claim that , an infinitesimal small coupling @xmath116 provides a vanishing @xmath21 at _ any _ finite temperature because - they argue- the model is no longer integrable by bethe ansatz . in this case the zero temperature limit of @xmath21 does not coincide with the zero temperature drude weight , that is generally finite in any gapless 1d spinless fermion phase , because it is related to the low - energy zero - temperature properties of the model .",
    "if we agree with the conclusions of ref.@xcite , that are based on calculations on periodic rings with @xmath119 sites , the model containing nearest and next - nearest neighbor repulsion is a bose metal for any non zero @xmath120 .",
    "indeed the conclusion of the work@xcite is more general and , translated in the boson language , implies quite generally that 1d bose metals do exist in the gapless phase .",
    "according to the authors conjecture , that is still under debate , @xmath99 for @xmath106 in all models that are non integrable with bethe ansatz ( e.g. also the celebrated bose - hubbard model falls in this class if we extend this conjecture also to bosonic models ) . a more clear argument",
    "was given in ref.@xcite , where the absence of a finite drude weight ( @xmath21 ) at finite temperature was predicted in all 1d models that do not have some conserved current .",
    "essentially , in lattice models , the current can decay due to umklapp - processes and a finite conductivity is expected at finite temperature , a condition that is incompatible with a finite @xmath21 ( which implies a @xmath121 function @xmath122 response and therefore an infinite finite temperature conductivity ) .",
    "the condition of integrability may instead allow for some conserved current , but it is also possible in principle that some conserved current can be realized even in non - integrable models.@xcite recently a more clear numerical evidence was also given that in a generic 1d model with frustration @xmath21 is zero at finite temperature even in the gapless phase.@xcite    we do not want to enter in this subtle discussion on what is the right criterion that allows a finite @xmath21 at finite temperature , but from what is known so far , it appears that only very particular lattice models obtained with fine tuning of coupling constants can represent 1d bose superfluid and that the generic gapless phase is instead a bose metal , at least for hard core boson models .",
    "moreover , in this case , the superfluid phase obtained at particular coupling strengths do not certainly satisfy property ( iii ) and superfluidity may be detected only for suitable and very particular environment - system coupling .",
    "we have formulated a consistent definition of superfluidity valid for lattice and continuous models in any dimensionality that relates @xmath21-the superfluid density - to the linear response current - current correlation calculated at finite temperature .",
    "this formulation agrees with the pollock - ceperley@xcite one based on the winding number , provided the correct order of limit is taken : first the thermodynamic limit and then the zero temperature limit , relevant for ground state properties . in the opposite order of limits",
    "we have shown that the so called zero temperature drude weight is obtained , but this can be finite both for a bose - metal and for a bose - superfluid .",
    "the discrimination between the two can be obtained at finite temperature within the present formulation or by using the scalapino - criterion that can be worked out directly at @xmath123@xcite .",
    "both criteria coincide in the @xmath124 limit for model systems where the solution is known , but the latter one can not be applied in 1d because it is not possible to define a transverse field in this case .",
    "the main conclusion of our approach is that in 1d a generic gapless phase may be metallic and not superfluid , namely a very peculiar and interesting interacting phase - the bose metal- with _",
    "finite _ zero temperature drude weight@xcite but no superfluid density .",
    "in many recent papers the possibility to have this type of bose metal has not been considered yet , especially in 1d@xcite , where it has been usually assumed that the gapless phase is superfluid .",
    "this attribute was originally used to characterize the classical 2d phase corresponding to the 1d zero temperature quantum model .",
    "this was certainly correct but may be clearly misleading , because the superfluidity of the 2d classical model may be not related to the superfluidity of the corresponding quantum model at low temperature .    in this work",
    "we have shown that 1d hard - core boson interacting - systems should be bose metals in the generic gapless phase , simply because for these models superfluidity can not be detected at any @xmath106 ( apart for the mentioned exceptions ) , even when the drude weight is non zero in the ground state .    based on the above results",
    ", it appears possible that this bose metal phase can be extended also to some model without the hard core constraint , because this constraint should not play an important role at low energy@xcite .",
    "the seminal work by fisher and coworkers on the mapping of the 1d zero temperature bose - hubbard model to a classical 2d model at finite temperature is perfectly valid as far as the critical behavior at the transition is concerned .",
    "however , in this mapping , the superfluid density of the classical model ( that can be finite below the kosterlitz - thouless transition temperature ) is related to the drude - weight of the quantum zero temperature model and not - obviously- to its finite temperature superfluid density .",
    "this quantity can be in principle different from the drude weight , even at arbitrary small temperature , whenever the system is indeed metallic and not superfluid .",
    "it is also clear that the analytical calculation of the  superfluid density  reported in ref.(@xcite ) for luttinger liquids refers instead to the zero temperature drude weight which is obviously finite , but does not necessarily imply superfluidity . on the other hand in the numerical calculation reported in ref.@xcite",
    ", no finite size scaling is attempted at fixed temperature .",
    "based on these considerations it appears important to improve further the numerical results of the 1d bosonic models with soft or hard core constraint by using recent more accurate and powerful techniques@xcite , that can be extended to much larger system sizes .",
    "this may allow to establish more accurately the nature of the gapless phases of 1d bose models .",
    "in 2d close to a metal - insulator transition we have recently speculated@xcite on the possibility to have a non fermi liquid phase before the mott - insulating phase . in the boson language",
    "this possibility can be realized whenever the phonon velocity @xmath125 in the superfluid phase goes to zero before the mott transition .",
    "in such a case an anomalous phase with finite zero temperature drude weight but no superfluid density should appear between the mott insulator and the superfluid . in this phase",
    "it can be also shown that there is no condensate , using a known relation based on the generalized indetermination principle.@xcite in the language of spin liquids the bose - metal is just a gapless spin - liquid of the type stabilized in the frustrated @xmath126 model@xcite .",
    "although in dimension higher than one all these examples are clearly not well established because they are based on the variational approximation , we believe that , since in 1d the bose ( spin ) liquid is stable at least in hard - core boson models , it is worth to consider this phase as a possible phase of matter even in higher dimensionality and especially in 2d .",
    "i acknowledge very useful discussions with a. sandvik , r. hlubina and a. parola .",
    "i am also especially grateful with d. poilblanc and g. batrouni , the organizers of the very exciting conference in peyres .",
    "landau long time ago , have defined a criterion of superfluidity that is valid in the ground state and is based on the coupling environment at rest- and system at finite velocity @xmath35 .",

    "statistical physics : theory of the condensed state ",

    "unfortunately this criterion can not be applied to lattice models , because there is no galilean invariance ."
