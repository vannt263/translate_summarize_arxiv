    "the moduli stack of maps from a curve to stack quotient of a smooth projective variety by the action of a complex reductive group has a natural stability condition introduced by mundet in @xcite and investigated further in schmitt @xcite ; the condition generalizes stability for bundles over a curve introduced by mumford , narasimhan - seshadri and ramanathan @xcite . in an earlier paper",
    "@xcite the first and third authors used the moduli of mundet - stable maps to give a formula that relates the genus zero gauged gromov - witten invariants and gromov - witten invariants of the git quotient of a smooth projective variety with reductive group action , termed a quantum analog of witten s localization theorem .",
    "the proof of the formula depended on the properness of the stack .",

    "the stability condition for maps to quotient stacks combines several stability conditions already present in the literature , and leads to a notion of gauged gromov - witten invariant .",
    "let @xmath0 be a smooth projective @xmath1-variety such that the semi - stable locus is equal to the stable locus , @xmath2 the quotient stack . by definition",

    "we denote by @xmath7 the projection to the classifying space . in case @xmath0",
    "is a point , a stability condition for @xmath8 , bundles on @xmath3 , was introduced by ramanathan @xcite . a stability condition that combines bundle and target stability",
    "was introduced by mundet @xcite .",
    "there is a compactified moduli stack @xmath9 whose open locus consists of mundet semistable maps of class @xmath10 with markings : @xmath11 the compactification uses the notion of kontsevich stability for maps @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the stack admits evaluation maps to the quotient stack @xmath12 in addition , assuming stable = semistable there is a virtual fundamental class constructed via the machinery of behrend - fantechi @xcite .",

    "so what we are concerned with here is the generalization of that story to arbitrary git quotients , especially the non - abelian and non - fano cases to cover situations such as arbitrary toric stacks and quiver moduli . especially , we are interested in re - proving and extending the results of those papers in a uniform and geometric way that extends to quantum k - theory and non - abelian quotients and does not use any assumption such as the existence of a torus action with isolated fixed points .",
    "the splitting axiom for the gauged invariants is somewhat different than the usual splitting axiom in gromov - witten theory : the potential @xmath17 is a non - commutative version of a _ trace _ on the frobenius manifold @xmath14 .",
    "note that there are several other notions of gauged gromov - witten invariants , for example , ciocan - fontanine - kim - maulik @xcite , frenkel - teleman - tolland @xcite , as well as a growing body of work on gauged gromov - witten theory with potential @xcite , @xcite .",

    "however , in the setting of virtual fundamental classes constructed algebraically , one prefers to stay in the framework of algebraic geometry .",

    "the associated fiber bundle @xmath999 is projective , since @xmath0 is projective and @xmath998 is projective .",

    "this implies that bundle @xmath217 is trivial on @xmath253 . finally , the inequality @xmath1004 is automatically satisfied since the scaling on @xmath957 is finite at the markings , and the forgetful map maps all components with zero scaling to loci where the scaling is finite .",

    "finally we consider the general case that domains of the family are nodal .",
    "that is , we have a family of gauged maps @xmath1005 such that every @xmath1006 is a nodal projective curve . in this case",
    "we repeat the first two steps for the family obtained by restricting to the root component @xmath1007 . in the last stage ,",
    "properness for stable maps to @xmath631 implies the existence of a limit of @xmath1008 .",
    "almost exactly the same argument shows that the moduli stack of affine gauged maps is universally closed :    [ infinite ] given a family of stable affine gauged maps over a punctured curve @xmath72 , @xmath1009 there exists an extension over @xmath233 , after tale cover .",
    "we use this and the statement of the lemma above , which dealt with irreducible domain , to prove universal closure of the moduli space of scaled gauged maps :    the moduli stack @xmath623 is universally closed .",

    "we may assume that either @xmath51 is finite or infinite on the root component @xmath99 for all @xmath560 , after possibly replacing @xmath72 with an open subscheme .",
    "in the finite case , the existence of a central extension over the central fiber follows from [ finite ] . in the infinite case ,",
    "the central fiber is a collection of affine gauged maps and maps to @xmath22 by gluing at the nodes .",

    "[ infinite ] , the restriction of the families @xmath1013 to @xmath1014 have extension over the central fiber .",
    "similarly properness of the moduli stack of stable maps to @xmath22 implies the existence of a limit of the restriction of the family to @xmath99 . by closure of the diagonal",
    ", these families glue together to a scaled gauged map on the central fiber .",
    "in this section we check the valuative criterion for separatedness .",
    "this is again a combination of separatedness of the moduli stack of stable maps to the target , its quotient , and uniqueness of extensions on bundles on surfaces .    for @xmath1015 let @xmath1016 be families of stable scaled gauged maps over a curve @xmath233 that are isomorphic over the punctured curve @xmath1017",
    ". then @xmath1018 is isomorphic to @xmath1019 over @xmath233 .",
    "again this follows from a three - step process , in which we show that the maps agree on parts of the limit corresponding to infinite , finite , and zero scaling .",
    ".1 in _ step 1 : the maps agree on the part with non - zero scaling .",
    "_ first we introduce for notation the induced map to the git quotient .",
    "let @xmath1020 denote the union of components @xmath1021 with infinite or finite , non - zero scaling @xmath1022 .",
    "the inverse image of the semistable locus @xmath22 is dense in @xmath1023 by lemma [ genlem ] . by properness of the stack @xmath22 ( it has projective coarse moduli space )",
    "we obtain maps @xmath1024 we would like to apply separatedness for the moduli stack of stable scaled maps to the git quotient to show that these maps are isomorphic .",
    "however , the maps @xmath1025 may not be stable since they may contain unstable components . to remedy this ,",
    "choose an ample invariant divisor @xmath846 as in .",
    "let @xmath1026 denote the points mapping to @xmath691 .",
    "consider the scaled curve to @xmath22 given by @xmath1027 where @xmath1028 denotes the union obtained by adding the intersection points with the divisor and deleting duplicates and nodes .",
    "after restricting to an open subset of @xmath72 containing the central fiber , we may assume that @xmath1029 are distinct , non - singular points .",
    "we claim that the tuples constructed in the previous paragraph are stable scaled maps .",
    "any component of @xmath1030 with finite , non - zero scaling that becomes a unstable component after passing to @xmath22 must either be stable , or correspond to a map to @xmath1031 that lies generically in a fiber of @xmath1032 .",
    "such maps always intersect @xmath286 since @xmath286 is ample .",
    "hence any such component has at least two special points and a non - trivial scaling , and so is stable .",
    "separation for the moduli stack of stable scaled maps to the git quotient implies that the central fibers are isomorphic : by proposition [ trivaction ] there exists an isomorphism @xmath1033 .1 in _ step 2 : the limits agree on the part with non - zero scaling .",
    "_ this step is an application of uniqueness of removal of singularities for bundles on surfaces in theorem [ extend ] .",
    "let @xmath1034 denote the curves from step 1 .",
    "the classifying maps @xmath1035 are isomorphic ( that is , the corresponding bundles are isomorphic ) except at finitely many non - singular points , the base points , since the maps @xmath1036 agree .",
    "furthermore , the base points @xmath1037 are contained in components of @xmath1038 with infinite scaling , since @xmath286 contains the unstable locus @xmath1039 . by uniqueness of the completion of bundles on surfaces in theorem",
    "[ extend ] , the bundles @xmath1040 are isomorphic over @xmath1041 .",
    ".1 in _ step 3 : the limits agree entirely .",
    "_ finally we apply separatedness for families of stable sections to show that the limiting sections are isomorphic .",
    "separation of stable maps to @xmath1042 where @xmath1043 implies that there exists an isomorphism , @xmath1044 since the scaled curves appearing in the limit already agree , this implies that the stable scaled maps @xmath1045 are isomorphic .",
    "the existence of a unique limit in the case of a family with infinite scaling is similar and left to the reader .",
    "this proves the valuative criterion for separatedness .",
    "universal closure and of finite - type was shown in previous sections .",
    "this completes the proof of properness of @xmath67 in theorem [ main ] .",
    "finally we complete the proof of the properness of moduli stacks of affine gauged maps .",
    "for any @xmath66 , the union of moduli stacks of affine gauged maps @xmath822 with @xmath1046 is proper .",
    "the proof is by an embedding argument .",
    "the stack @xmath822 embeds in @xmath1047 by choosing an attaching point @xmath1048 and taking the map on the root component to be constant : given an affine gauged map @xmath1049 and a point @xmath1048 define @xmath1050 and extend the map @xmath5 so that it is constant on the root component @xmath1051 .",
    "since any closed substack of a proper stack is proper , @xmath822 is proper .",
    "( convex targets ) we conclude by describing results for convex targets : for the moduli stack of gauged maps to a convex variety @xmath0 defined in section [ convex ] , the conclusion of theorem [ main ] also holds .",
    "as explained in corollary [ disjoint ] , mundet stable maps to @xmath0 are equivalent to maps to @xmath700 as long as the linearization @xmath277 is chosen so that the linearization is obtained from @xmath703 for @xmath315 sufficiently large .",
    "conversely , for any class @xmath707 which pairs trivially with the class of the divisor at infinity , affine gauged maps to @xmath1052 and maps to @xmath22 of class @xmath707 are equivalent : the intersection number between the map and divisor is zero and any such map can not have a component mapping entirely to the divisor . in the case of maps to the quotient , any point in @xmath700 is unstable for @xmath703 for @xmath315 sufficiently large , and so @xmath1052 is isomorphic to @xmath22 .",
    "it follows that the inclusion @xmath1053 is an isomorphism , as claimed , and in particular the union of components @xmath67 with @xmath715 is proper for any energy bound @xmath66 .",
