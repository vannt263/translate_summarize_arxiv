    "today s collider facilities raise the interest in testing perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) at work , and in searching for phenonema beyond its capability . however  at least for the experimentally available transverse momentum region ",
    "pqcd parton models underestimate the production of mesons in proton - proton ( @xmath4 ) collisions  @xcite , even at next - to - leading order ( nlo )  @xcite . in order to restore the consistency with the data ,",
    "two methods were proposed at leading order ( lo ) : inclusion of the intrinsic transverse momentum of partons  @xcite , and/or an effective correction factor ( @xmath1 factor ) , accounting for higher order contributions  @xcite .",
    "the physical background is to account for both , the missing higher order perturbative corrections and radiation effects .",
    "the latter is not present in electron - proton processes , however , it becomes important in @xmath4 collisions  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we present the first results on pion production in @xmath4 collisions applying a nlo pqcd parton model _ with _ intrinsic transverse momentum , taken from a gaussian distribution with width @xmath5 . in section",
    "ii the intrinsic transverse momentum is introduced into the formalism , and the appropriate nlo expressions are presented .",
    "the necessity of such an extension is demonstrated at @xmath6 gev in section iii .",
    "next , we display the best fit values of the width of the intrinsic transverse momentum distribution at nlo level for available @xmath7 experiments , in the energy range @xmath8 gev @xmath9 gev . similarly to ref .",
    "@xcite , we study the pion production in the @xmath10 gev @xmath11 gev transverse momentum region , where nuclear effects are considered to be important .    finally , we extract the ratio of the nlo cross section to the born term ( @xmath1 factor ) at different energies and transverse momenta , and study its dependence on the amount of the included intrinsic transverse momentum . this way we provide a numerical foundation to the correction factors used in lo calculation  @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate , that a leading order calculation with a fitted , c.m .",
    "energy , transverse momentum and scale dependent @xmath1 factor and additional intrinsic transverse momentum reproduces well the full nlo results at higher energies and momenta , and can be used as a fast method to get a reasonable estimate of a full nlo calculation .",
    "in order to extend the applicability of the original , infinite momentum frame parton model  @xcite to smaller transverse momenta , we introduce the intrinsic transverse momentum of the partons  @xcite .",
    "we write the four - momenta of the interacting partons ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) as  @xcite p_a & = & ( x_a2 + ,   _ , a ,  x_a2- ) , + p_b & = & ( x_b2 + ,   _ , b , -x_b2 + ) . in this notation @xmath14 ,",
    "the momentum fraction carried by the parton , becomes a parameter .",
    "the apparent fraction is @xmath15 , however , for practical applications at high energy ( @xmath16 gev ; @xmath17 gev ; @xmath18 gev@xmath19 ) , the distinction has a negligible ( @xmath20 ) effect .",
    "furthermore , we require that the longitudinal direction of the partons does not change sign due to the transverse momentum , i.e. @xmath21 .    the starting point of our calculation is factorization : the hadronic cross sections up to a power correction may be written as a convolution over hard partonic ( pqcd ) processes , [ pqcd - def ] & = & _ abc dx_a dx_b d^2k_,a d^2k_,b   + & & f_a / p(x_a , q;k_,a ) f_b / p(x_b , q;k_,b ) d_/c(z_c , q_f ) , where @xmath22 is the partonic cross section of the reaction @xmath23 ( lo with condition @xmath24 ) , or @xmath25 ( nlo with fixed @xmath26 ) and ( at fixed scales ) is the function of the partonic mandelstam variables only . in order to avoid singularities due to the intrinsic transverse momentum we use regularization + m^2 , -m^2/2 , -m^2/2 , with @xmath27 gev . the factorization is done at the _ factorization _ scale @xmath28 , where the parton content of the initial proton is determined by the parton distribution function @xmath29 ( pdf ) .",
    "for simplicity , we assume a gaussian dependence of the pdfs on the intrinsic transverse momentum , with a width @xmath5 , f(x , q , k^2 _ ) = f(x , q ) 12av e^-k_^2/2av .",
    "we note , that such a separation may be viewed as a first approximation to the _ unintegrated _ pdf , where recent studies indeed found a shape close to gaussian  @xcite .",
    "finally , the hadrons are created collinearly with the outgoing parton @xmath30 with momentum fraction @xmath26 at _ fragmentation _",
    "scale @xmath31 .",
    "the partonic cross section explicitly depends on three scales , @xmath28 , @xmath31 and the _ renormalization _ scale @xmath32 .    in principle , the scales can be determined such that the final result has the minimum sensitivity to them  @xcite , and usually are set to be equal .",
    "however , in this paper we use the results of a previous study  @xcite of @xmath4 and @xmath33 data , where the reproduction the cronin effect in @xmath33 reactions  @xcite imposed such scales , that the corresponding @xmath34 gev@xmath35 .",
    "we note that there is some ambiguity in the choice of scales . in the literature",
    "typical scales are fixed to hadronic or partonic variables , @xmath36 or @xmath37 , respectively , where @xmath38 is an @xmath39 number .",
    "other choices are also possible , e.g. an invariant scale , @xmath40 as proposed in ref .",
    "however , in our case we found that this choice is equivalent to @xmath37 .    at nlo level and no intrinsic transverse momentum eq .",
    "( [ pqcd - def ] ) is usually rewritten with variable change ( @xmath41,@xmath42,@xmath26)@xmath43 ( @xmath44,@xmath45,@xmath26 ) , where @xmath46 and @xmath47 , as [ pqcd - vw ] & = & 1_abc d d  j + & & d^2k_,a d^2k_,b  f_a / p f_b / p d_/c(z_c , q_f ) , with the proper kinematical boundaries , @xmath48 being the jacobian of the transformation ( @xmath49 for @xmath5=0 ) , and @xmath50 is the sum of @xmath51 and @xmath52 cross sections  @xcite , ( 1- ) + ^abcd(,,,q , q_r , q_f ) , with _",
    "scale @xmath32 ( chosen to be equal to the factorization scale @xmath28 ) . in this paper , however , we use eq .",
    "( [ pqcd - def ] ) directly , since for @xmath53 the momentum fraction @xmath14 can not be expressed analytically from @xmath44 and @xmath45 , while the inverse transformation can be done .",
    "several codes are available for calculating jet cross sections at nlo level  @xcite . here",
    "we have chosen to extend the one by the aversa group  @xcite calculating the partonic cross sections at next - to - leading - log level , with the intrinsic transverse momentum distribution .",
    "the calculations presented in the following sections were performed with the mrst - cg pdf  @xcite and kkp ff  @xcite parameterization .",
    "first , we demonstrate the importance of the intrinsic transverse momentum to reproduce experimental data in the transverse momentum region @xmath54 gev @xmath55 gev . in this part",
    ", we use the scales proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite to make a direct comparison to the 400 gev fnal experiment  @xcite .",
    "shows , that at @xmath6 gev the nlo calculations of pion production in @xmath4 collision underpredict the experimental data by a factor of 2 using the scale parameters @xmath56 and neglecting intrinsic transverse momentum ( as in  @xcite ) .",
    "decreasing the scales ( but still keeping them hard for the applicability of pqcd ) the agreement can be improved , however , without intrinsic transverse momentum , even if lower scales are chosen , the data are still underestimated . the lower line in fig .  1 .",
    "presents the nlo calculation _ with _ a partonic intrinsic transverse momentum distribution of width @xmath5 = 1 gev@xmath35 , and shows a nice agreement with the data .",
    "we note , however , that there is a delicate interplay between the choice of the scales and the intrinsic transverse momentum @xmath5 , needed to reproduce the data  @xcite .",
    "typically , increasing the scales increases the value of @xmath5 .       to experimental data in @xmath7 reactions from 19.5 to 200 gev .",
    "different symbols refer to different experiments , see  @xcite .",
    "the solid line represents the average value of a lo calculation  @xcite.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=49.0% ]    in this section we summarize the results on the intrinsic transverse momentum width of the partons in the nucleon fitting the nlo pqcd calculations to the data , generalizing the lo scale choice of  @xcite to @xmath57 , @xmath58 , where @xmath38 is a @xmath39 number . in this work ,",
    "we fix @xmath59 at nlo level .",
    "our previous study  @xcite also showed , that the reproduction of the cronin peak in @xmath33 collision requires the width of the intrinsic transverse momentum distribution to be on the order of @xmath60 2 gev@xmath35 at energies @xmath61 30 gev , which is achieved by the above choice of scales .",
    "a similar value of @xmath5 was extracted from the experimental analysis of jet - angle distribution  @xcite .    analyzing the @xmath7 experimental data  @xcite",
    ", we deduced the best fit value @xmath5 for each experiment , similarly to what is shown in fig .  1",
    ", minimizing the @xmath62 ( data over theory ) ratio in the range @xmath3 gev .",
    "the result is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig - kt2 ] , separately indicating the runs from different experiments and shows a need for a considerable amount of partonic transverse momentum .",
    "we also checked , that similarly to the lo results  @xcite , the extracted width does not depend on the charge of the pion .    usually , changing the order of a calculation",
    "requires changing of the underlying scales . comparing nlo result to the previous lo ones  @xcite one notices that in order to keep the average transverse momentum width , we had to increase the scales , dictated by the experimentally obtained cronin peak  @xcite .",
    "keeping lo scales ( @xmath63 ) would lead to a substantial reduction of the width , originating in the mechanism of nlo graphs to automatically generate transverse momenta .",
    "it is remarkable , that fitting to the nuclear reaction data requires the same width independent of the order of the calculation used !",
    "recent @xmath64 data at rhic  @xcite also indicate that at @xmath65 gev more transverse momentum is necessary , than @xmath66 gev@xmath35 , indicated in fig .",
    "2 . this shows , that the scale parameter @xmath38 possibly may also depend on the energy , and a higher , @xmath67 scale with @xmath68 gev@xmath35 reproduces well both the @xmath4 and the @xmath64 data without jet quenching effects  @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the scale parameter on the c.m .",
    "energy and its consequences will be studied in a separate paper .      since most calculations ( especially , for nucleus - nucleus collisions ) are still based on lo , it is useful to provide a well - founded @xmath1 factor for these faster calculations .",
    "[ fig - kt0 ] shows the ratio of the full nlo calculation to the born term with no intrinsic transverse momentum .",
    "indeed , at high energy and transverse momenta @xmath69 approaches the well known value of 2 , however , in the low transverse momentum region it has a strong @xmath2 dependence . as a first approximation , for @xmath70 60 gev , the pionic @xmath1 factor can be taken energy independent  @xcite .",
    "since the intrinsic transverse momentum may have a different effect on the born term than on the higher order ( ho ) processes , the latter contributing the dominant part , it is worth to study the dependence of the @xmath1 factor on the width @xmath5 .",
    "we present this behavior in fig .",
    "[ fig - kt ] , indicating the ratio @xmath71 at @xmath72 1 and 2 gev@xmath35 ( with @xmath59 scale parameter ) and at different energies from @xmath73 20 to 1800 gev .",
    "while at low energies the ratio @xmath74 shows a large decrease with increasing @xmath5 ( mainly due to the efficiency of the intrinsic transverse momentum at low energies in enhancing the born term faster than the ho corrections ) , from @xmath70 60 gev its value is always above 1 , indicating , that ho corrections are gaining more from transverse momentum , than the born term .",
    "the maximal enhancement is peaked at @xmath75 gev , with 10% correction at @xmath76 gev@xmath35 and 20% correction at @xmath77 gev@xmath35 , while for @xmath78 4 gev , the transverse momentum driven correction vanishes , validating lo calculations in this range with @xmath5 independent @xmath1 factors  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we introduced initial transverse momentum distributions into the parton - based description of hadron production in nlo level pqcd calculations and demonstrated , that such an extension is necessary even in nlo to reproduce the @xmath4 experimental data . from the analysis of most experiments in the",
    "3 gev @xmath79 6 window a width of intrinsic transverse momentum distribution on the order of @xmath80 gev@xmath35 was fitted .",
    "the obtained precision of the description of pion production in @xmath4 collisions is high enough to find possible collective effects in nuclear collisions .",
    "we presented the pionic @xmath1-factor ( full nlo cross section to the born term ) for several energies and transverse momentum values , and found a pronounced dependence on @xmath2 in the 3 gev @xmath81 6 window , where nuclear effects show up most prominently .",
    "furthermore , we investigated in detail the modifications of the born and higher order terms due to the presence of an intrinsic transverse momentum and concluded , that above certain energy in the above mentioned @xmath2 window the higher order contribution raises faster , than the born term and hence the @xmath1-factor increases compared to its value without intrinsic transverse momentum . for @xmath78 4 gev this enhancement may be neglected , justifying @xmath5 independent @xmath1-factor calculations , however , at smaller transverse momenta the correction goes up to 20% , just in the order of the measured nuclear enhancement .",
    "the detailed study of the nuclear enhancement , and its role in fixing the scales of an nlo calculation will be carried out separately .",
