    "@xcite similar to the proposals in single and double qds , three - electron doublet states in linear triple qds@xcite ( tqds ) or chirality states in triangular tqds@xcite have also been raised to realize spin qubits recently .",
    "additionally , based on zeeman sublevels of single electron in each qd as a spin qubit , tqds can be used as a small circuit for constructing the qd network.@xcite this circuit has some intriguing functionalities .",
    "specifically , it can be used to realize quantum teleportation without losing information.@xcite moreover , the entangled greenberger - horne - zeilinger state and werner state in this system can be applied for quantum error correction.@xcite all these potential applications may make tqds attractive for quantum computation .",
    "recently , electronic and spin properties of tqds with few electrons have been studied both experimentally and theoretically.@xcite in experiments , the stability diagrams of linear si tqds@xcite and both linear@xcite and triangular@xcite gaas tqds have been measured .",
    "in addition , the coherent manipulation of doublet - quartet@xcite or doublet - doublet@xcite states in gaas linear tqds has been realized very recently .",

    "et al._@xcite proposed a set of topological hund s rules to understand the spin configurations of the ground states of few electrons in gaas tqds in the absence of external fields .",
    "et al._@xcite showed the transition of the spin configurations of few - electron states in gaas tqds by tuning the perpendicular magnetic field ( i.e. ,  the faraday configuration ) .",
    "et al._@xcite investigated both the linear and nonlinear stark effects induced by the in - plane electric field .",
    "in addition to these works on triangular tqds , hsieh _ et al._@xcite also studied the dependence of the energy spectra on detuning energy in linear gaas tqds .",
    "it is noted that all the above works are based on the hubbard model .",
    "utilizing this model , the electron - electron coulomb interaction , which is crucial to the energy spectra,@xcite is not explicitly included , but rather given as hubbard parameters . with the electron - electron coulomb interaction explicitly calculated by using the real - space configuration interaction method , hawrylak and korkusinsik@xcite investigated the gate - voltage dependence of the three - electron energy spectra in triangular gaas tqds .",
    "however , the effects of the magnetic field and spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) , which have been shown to be very important to the energy spectra , were not studied in their work.@xcite it is further noted that most of the theoretical works on electronic and spin properties of few electrons in tqds have focused on gaas until now . as reported ,",
    "the spin decoherence , which is essential for applications in quantum computation , is limited by the hyperfine interaction@xcite and spin - orbit coupling ( soc)@xcite in gaas .",

    "we first investigate the case of equilateral triangular tqds where the dependences of energy spectra on the external either perpendicular magnetic or parallel magnetic ( i.e. , the voigt configuration ) field , dot size , interdot distance , and electric field are calculated .",
    "we find anticrossings with large energy splittings between the energy levels with the same spin state in the perpendicular magnetic - field dependence of the energy spectra in the absence of the soc",
    ". these anticrossings , which have not been reported in the literature , originate from the equilateral triangular tqd confinement potential . as for the parallel magnetic - field dependence , the energy spectra only vary linearly due to the negligible orbital effect of the parallel magnetic field . in addition",
    ", we find doublet - quartet transition of the ground - state spin configuration by tuning the interdot distance or dot size in the absence of external fields and the soc .",
    "we also find that the three - electron energy levels and their charge configurations can be strongly affected by the in - plane electric field .",
    "then we turn to the case of symmetric linear tqds where the effects of dot size , interdot distance , magnetic and electric fields on energy spectra are discussed .",
    "anticrossings between the energy levels with the same spin state are observed in the perpendicular magnetic - field dependence of the energy spectra , which is similar to the case of the equilateral triangular tqds .",

    "in contrast to the complex dependence on the perpendicular magnetic field , the energy spectra vary linearly with the parallel magnetic field due to the negligible orbital effect of parallel magnetic field . additionally , in perpendicular / parallel magnetic - field dependence of energy levels , we find that all the intersections in equilateral triangular tqd cases become anticrossing due to the soc whereas only part of them show anticrossing behaviors in symmetric linear tqd case .",
    "all these anticrossing behaviors are analyzed from the symmetry consideration .",
    "moreover , we also find that energy levels and their charge configurations can be strongly affected by the in - plane electric field .",

    "the inset enlarges the energy spectra in the vicinity of @xmath61 t .",
    "@xmath63nm.,width=302 ]    in this part , we show the detailed analysis about the anticrossing behavior due to the soc in the magnetic field dependence of the energy spectra in both equilateral triangular and symmetric linear tqd cases .",
    "we focus on the perpendicular magnetic field case . to facilitate the understanding , we first review the anticrossing behavior in single qd limit.@xcite in the absence of the soc , the perpendicular magnetic - field dependence of the lowest few energy levels are plotted in fig .",
    "these energy levels are denoted by the good quantum numbers @xmath80 , @xmath77 and @xmath82 , and the intersections between them are simple crossings as mentioned previously.@xcite with the inclusion of the soc , part of these intersections ( labelled by open squares in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) are lifted to show anticrossing behavior . to understand this behavior",
    ", we span the hilbert space by the three - electron eigenstates labelled by ( @xmath126 ) .",
    "it is noted that the hilbert space is also spanned by these eigenstates in the following . as the eigenstate with ( @xmath127 ) can be coupled with the one with ( @xmath128 ) or ( @xmath129 ) by the soc [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) ] according to the previous works,@xcite the hilbert space can be divided into two independent parts spanned by the eigenstates with @xmath130 being even or odd .",
    "the eigenstates in the same part can be coupled with each other by the soc , which makes the intersections between the energy levels in the same part become anticrossing .    with the increase of the interdot distance , we turn to study the equilateral triangular tqd case .",
    "as pointed out previously , the equilateral triangular tqd confinement potential can couple the eigenstates in single qds with the same spin state and the difference of @xmath82 being @xmath131 ( @xmath85 integer ) .",
    "this indicates that two independent parts ( i.e. , @xmath130 being even or odd ) can be coupled by the tqd confinement potential . as a result",
    ", all the intersections in equilateral triangular tqd case can be lifted by the soc .    as for the symmetric linear tqd case",
    ", the confinement potential can couple the eigenstates in single qds with the same spin state and the difference of @xmath82 being even .",
    "thus , two independent parts ( i.e. , @xmath130 being even or odd ) are still independent , which is different from the equilateral triangular tqd case . as a result , only the intersections between the energy levels in the same part can show anticrossing behavior due to the soc",
    ".    we also study the case of parallel magnetic field applied along @xmath14-axis .",
    "similar to the case of perpendicular magnetic field , in single qd limit , the three - electron eigenstates can be divided into two independent parts according to @xmath132 being either even or odd with the inclusion of the soc.@xcite as for the tqd cases , we also find that all the intersections in equilateral triangular tqds whereas only those between the energy levels in the same part ( i.e. , @xmath132 being either even or odd ) in symmetric linear tqds can become anticrossing due to the soc .    0 d. loss and d. p. divincenzo , phys . rev . a * 57 * , 120 ( 1998 ) .",
