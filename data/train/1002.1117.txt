    "details of mhd wave propagation inside magnetized regions are very important for understanding of interaction , scattering , and conversion of seismic waves by sunspots in the sun .",
    "the structure of sunspots themselves is not well understood .",
    "@xcite proposed a self consistent magnetostatic sunspot model .",
    "later @xcite presented a self - similar model .",
    "these two models ( model of pizzo at the top and model of low at the bottom ) were joined by @xcite .",
    "it is well understood now that the sunspot is dynamic , so several attempts have been made to build numerically a stable sunspot model with the background flows @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite obtained realistically looking penumbral structures with outflows .",
    "local helioseismology provides a tool for reconstruction of the internal structure ( both profiles of wave speed and flows ) of sunspots from doppler observations .",
    "the magnetic field of sunspots affect the result of the helioseismic inversion . for understanding the helioseismic effects of the magnetic field",
    "it is important to perform direct simulations of mhd waves in different models of sunspots .",
    "the simulations are also used for producing artificial data for calibration and testing of helioseismic measurements and inversion algorithms .",
    "there is wide gallery of numerical simulations of propagation of mhd waves inside sunspots illustrating various observed phenomena : power deficit of @xmath1-modes , acoustic halos , azimuthal phase shift variations of the signal in the sunspot penumbra , and so on .",
    "not all of these phenomena are caused by the direct effects of magnetic fields .",
    "indirect effects of magnetic fields must be also taken into account .",
    "for instance , @xcite showed that 50% of the observed acoustic power deficit in sunspots can be explained by the absence of the acoustic sources inside sunspots , where strong magnetic field inhibits convective motions , which are the primary source of solar oscillations .",
    "the suppression of acoustic sources is one of the most important indirect effects of the solar magnetoseismology .",
    "another example of the indirect effects are changes in the density and temperature stratifications caused by magnetic fields . among the direct effects of magnetic field ( effects caused by magnetic stresses on wave perturbations ) an important role is played by conversion into different types of mhd waves .",
    "for instance , 2d simulations of wave propagation in inclined magnetic fields ( e.g @xcite ) showed that fast mhd waves can be converted into slow mhd waves , which can leave the computational domain , and thus interpreted as an `` absorption '' of the fast mode .",
    "acoustic halos around sunspots were obtained in simulations by @xcite as a result of wave transformations .",
    "however , @xcite noted that this effect can be explained by changes in the excitation properties of solar convection in moderate field strength regions .",
    "@xcite obtained the peak restrictions of 3 kg for the photospheric magnetic field strength from simulations of scattering @xmath0-modes by the sunspot .",
    "three dimensional simulations of linear mhd wave propagation performed by @xcite show that the inclined magnetic field can be partly responsible for the azimuthal variations of travel times around sunspots found by @xcite from helioseismic observations .",
    "refraction of upward propagating mhd waves in the solar atmosphere was simulated by e.g. @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite carried out 2d simulations of the interaction of mhd waves with magnetostatic sunspot models . in this paper",
    "we present initial results of our 3d modeling of this problem .",
    "results of linear numerical simulations of mhd waves propagation in sunspots mainly depend on the setup of the problem : 2d or 3d simulations , choice of the background model of the sunspot , the way of excitation of the waves , and treating of the boundary conditions .",
    "the goal of this paper is to study and compare properties of 3d propagation of mhd waves in different magnetostatic models of sunspots , and also describe how different types of waves are affected by the sunspot .",
    "waves are generated by localized subphotospheric ( depth of 100 km ) sources of the vertical force .",
    "for such sources simulated waves propagate along the same ray paths as in the sun .",
    "the numerical method and the background sunspot models are described in  2 and  3 .",
    "the results of simulations are discussed in  4 .",
    "propagation of mhd waves inside the sun is described by the following system of linearized equations : @xmath2 \\displaystyle { { \\frac{\\partial { \\mbox{\\boldmath$m$}}'}{\\partial t } } } + \\nabla p ' - \\frac{1}{4\\pi}\\left [ ( \\nabla\\times{\\mbox{\\boldmath$b$}}')\\times{\\mbox{\\boldmath$b$}}_0 + ( \\nabla\\times{\\mbox{\\boldmath$b$}}_0)\\times{\\mbox{\\boldmath$b$}}'\\right ] = \\rho'{\\mbox{\\boldmath$g$}}_0 + { \\mbox{\\boldmath$s$}}(r , t),\\\\[12pt ] \\displaystyle { { \\frac{\\partial { \\mbox{\\boldmath$b$}}'}{\\partial t}}}=\\nabla\\times\\left(\\frac{{\\mbox{\\boldmath$m$}}'}{\\rho_0}\\times{\\mbox{\\boldmath$b$}}_0\\right),\\\\[12pt ] \\displaystyle { { \\frac{\\partial p'}{\\partial t } } } + c_{s0}^2\\nabla\\cdot { \\mbox{\\boldmath$m$ } } ' + c_{s0}^2\\frac{{\\mathcal{n}^{\\,2}}_0}{g_0}m_z = 0 , \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the momentum perturbation , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 are the velocity , density , pressure , and magnetic field perturbations respectively , @xmath8 is the wave source function .",
    "the quantities with subscript 0 , such as gravity @xmath9 , sound speed @xmath10 , and brnt - visl frequency @xmath11 correspond to the background model , @xmath12 is the background magnetic field satisfying the usual magnetohydrostatic equilibrium equation .",
    "the spatial and temporal behavior of the wave source is modeled by function @xmath13 : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the source radius , @xmath16 is the distance from the source center , @xmath17 is given by equation @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the central source frequency , @xmath20 is the moment of the source initiation .",
    "this source model provides the wave spectrum , which closely resembles the solar spectrum .",
    "it has a peak near the central frequency @xmath19 and spreads over a broad frequency interval .",
    "the source spectrum is : @xmath21 a superposition of such sources with uniform distribution of central frequencies randomly distributed below the photosphere describes very well the observed solar oscillation spectrum @xcite .    for numerical solution of eqs ( [ eq : mhd_3d ] )",
    "a semi - discrete finite difference scheme of high order was used . at the top and bottom boundaries",
    "non - reflective boundary conditions based on the perfectly matched layer ( pml ) technique were set .",
    "details of numerical realization of the code can be found in @xcite .",
    "we used two types of axially symmetric magnetohydrostatic background models of the sunspot described in @xcite ( `` shallow '' model ) and @xcite ( `` deep '' model ) .",
    "the `` shallow '' sunspot model is obtained as a combination of the self - similar solution @xcite in deep layers with the solution of pizzo @xcite in upper layers .",
    "we calculated three instances ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) of the `` shallow '' model with the following photospheric strengths of the magnetic field at the sunspot axis : 0.83  kg , 1.4  kg , and 2.2  kg respectively . strengths of the magnetic field at the bottom of the domain for these models are 5.0  kg , 8.0  kg , and 12.5  kg respectively .",
    "the depth of the domain ( from the photosphere ) for the `` shallow '' models is 9.87  mm .",
    "the position of the photosphere for the `` quiet '' sun ( at the boundary of the sunspot ) coincides with the photospheric level in the standard model s @xcite . for comparison purposes we calculated one instance of the `` deep '' sunspot model with the maximum strength of the magnetic field of 843  g at the photosphere and 29 kg at the bottom of the domain .",
    "the `` deep '' sunspot model is based on solution of pizzo everywhere in the domain .",
    "the depths of the deep model is 7.5  mm .",
    "maps of the relative sound speed perturbations for the `` shallow '' ( panel a ) and `` deep '' ( panel c ) models with photospheric strength of the magnetic field of 843 g and 836 g respectively are presented in figure [ fig : csmap ] .",
    "the black horizontal line marks the position of the photosphere .",
    "the red curve shows position of @xmath22  =  1 level .",
    "both types of the models were calculated under the assumption that @xmath23  =  5/3 .",
    "panels b and d show variations of relative speed of the fast mhd wave .",
    "the velocity of the fast mhd wave depends on the angle between the wave vector and the vector of the magnetic field .",
    "the maximum value is plotted .",
    "so , panels ( a ) and ( b ) represent bottom and top limits ( depending on the direction of propagation ) for the speed of the fast mhd wave for the `` shallow '' model .",
    "panels ( c ) and ( d ) represent speed limits for the `` deep '' model .",
    "there are three main differences between these models : ( i ) the topology of the magnetic field , ( ii ) the strength of the magnetic field near the bottom of the domain , and ( iii ) dependence of the horizontal profile of the sound speed on the depth .",
    "the magnetic field lines ( shown by blue curves in both panels of figure [ fig : csmap ] ) are convex near the photosphere for the `` deep '' model while in the `` shallow '' model the field lines are concave near the photosphere .",
    "one dimensional cuts of the horizontal profiles of the sound speed for different depths are shown in figure [ fig : cshorz ] .",
    "profiles are scaled by the sound speed @xmath24 taken at the same depth of the outer boundary of the sunspot . in the `` shallow '' model",
    "sound speed perturbation @xmath25 is close to zero everywhere starting from the depth of about 2  mm . in the `` deep '' model",
    "the sound speed perturbation is non zero even at the bottom of the domain at 7.5  mm .",
    "this means , that in the `` shallow '' model waves , propagating at distances greater than 10 mm , propagate mostly in the region with the sound speed profile of the quiet sun below the region with the perturbed sound speed .",
    "the vertical sound speed profiles at the sunspot center and at the boundary for both models are shown in figure  [ fig : csvert ] .",
    "the sound speed profiles along with the magnetic field structure are the most significant parameters affecting propagation of the mhd waves through the sunspot .",
    "in this section we present results of simulation of mhd waves generated by a single source in different magnetohydrostatic self - consistent background models .",
    "axially symmetric models of sunspots were interpolated on cartesian grid with @xmath26  mm .",
    "vertical grid is non - uniform .",
    "we have three instances ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) of the `` shallow '' model ( discussed above ) with the grid size of 376@xmath27376@xmath2767 and depth of 9.87  mm ( from the photosphere ) .",
    "the vertical z - grid step varies from @xmath28  mm at the level of the photosphere and above to @xmath29  mm at the bottom of the domain .",
    "time step @xmath30  s is the same for simulations with all three instances of the background `` shallow '' model .",
    "the `` deep '' model has the grid size of 184@xmath27184@xmath2762 , depth of 7.5  mm ( from the photosphere ) , and @xmath31  s. the vertical z - grid step varies from @xmath32  mm at the level of the photosphere and above to @xmath33  mm at the bottom of the domain .",
    "the source of the vertical component of force described above with the spectrum given by eq .",
    "( 5 ) is placed at the distance of 9  mm from the axis of the sunspot for the `` shallow '' models and 6  mm for the `` deep '' model .",
    "the depth of the source is 0.1  mm for both models .",
    "the top absorbing pml is placed at the height of 0.5  mm and extends up to 0.9  mm . in this region the vertical profile of the sound speed at the outer boundary of the sunspot",
    "is close to the profile in the standard solar model with @xmath23  = 5/3 .",
    "the lateral boundary conditions are chosen to be periodic .",
    "snapshots of the simulated wavefield for the `` deep '' model are shown in figure  [ fig : oldspot_map ] .",
    "panels a , b , and c represent maps of perturbations of density @xmath5 , z - momentum @xmath34 , and vertical component of the magnetic field @xmath35 respectively at moment @xmath36  = 20 min .",
    "panels d , e , and f represent maps of the same variables at @xmath36  = 25 min .",
    "each panel consists of horizontal xy - slice at the photospheric level ( top ) and vertical xz - slice through the center of the sunspot ( bottom ) . the white line in the xz - slice shows position of the photosphere .",
    "solid black curves represent the magnetic field lines .",
    "the dashed lines near the top and bottom of the xz - slice show the position of the damping layers . for the reference we plotted a circle with radius of 5 mm and origin at the wave source location .",
    "the non - uniform background model causes anisotropy of the amplitude of the wave front .",
    "when the wave front reaches the center of the sunspot the amplitude of density and momentum perturbations decrease . after passing the center of the sunspot",
    "the amplitude restores its original value . at some moments ,",
    "the amplitude inside the sunspot can become greater than the amplitude of wave propagating outside the sunspot .",
    "the shape of the wave front is changed as well .",
    "this is more noticeable for inner parts of the wave front , located inside the circle in panels a , b , and c. later we show that these parts of the wave front are formed mostly by @xmath0-modes .",
    "the shape of the outer parts of the wave front ( formed mostly by @xmath1-modes ) remains close to the circle .",
    "a wave , propagating along the magnetic field lines is appeared at the source location .",
    "it is clearly seen in vertical slices of @xmath37 and @xmath35 , but absent in @xmath5 .",
    "this wave consists of a mixture of the alfven and slow mhd waves .",
    "it is interesting to compare propagation of mhd waves in the `` deep '' and `` shallow '' models with similar photospheric strength of the magnetic field .",
    "results of wave simulations in the `` shallow '' model with the photospheric strength of the magnetic field @xmath38  = 0.83  kg are shown in figure  [ fig : newspot_map ] .",
    "there are common features with simulations for the `` deep '' model and there are differences . in general , in the `` shallow '' model waves show the same behavior as in the `` deep '' model . the amplitude of @xmath5 and @xmath37 decreases when the wave front reaches the center of the sunspot , but the ratio of amplitudes is closer to unity than in the `` deep '' model . after passing the center of the sunspot",
    "the wave restores its amplitude .",
    "the amplitude of momentum perturbations @xmath37 becomes slightly bigger inside the sunspot than outside , but again , not as much as in the `` deep '' model .",
    "perturbation of density @xmath5 remains smaller inside the sunspot than outside for all moments of time .",
    "the wave that contains a mixture of the alfven and slow mhd waves is generated near the source location , as in the `` deep '' model , but the amplitude of this wave is much smaller and it is not seen in figure  [ fig : newspot_map ] . the shape of the wave front is more circular than in simulations for the `` deep '' model . in general , we can say , that the `` shallow '' model affects the waves less than the `` deep '' model .    comparison of the z - momentum maps at the same moments of time in different instances of the `` shallow '' model with different strength of the photospheric magnetic field is shown in figure  [ fig : newspt_bdep ] .",
    "the wave amplitude inside the sunspot grows with the strength of the magnetic field and for the surface strength of 2.2  kg the wave amplitude inside the sunspot becomes bigger than outside .",
    "behavior of mhd waves inside sunspots depends on the distance of the wave source from the sunspot center .",
    "this happens because magnetoacoustic waves in the sun propagate through the solar interior .",
    "this means that waves , generated by the source located farther from the sunspot center , propagate deeper ( in the region with stronger magnetic field ) than waves from the closer source .",
    "the angle between the direction of wave propagation and the background magnetic field is also different in these two cases .",
    "snapshots of the wave field for the `` shallow '' model with surface strength of the magnetic field 2.2  kg are shown in figure  [ fig : newspt_9 - 12 mm ] .",
    "the left panel represents the wave generated by the source located at 9  mm from the sunspot axis .",
    "in the right panel the source is located at 12  mm from the sunspot center .",
    "the wave amplitude from the close source at some moment of time becomes bigger inside the sunspot than outside .",
    "the amplitude of the wave front of the distant source remains smaller inside the sunspot than outside for all moments of time .",
    "the wave source generates a mixture of fast , slow , alfven , and magnetogravity waves .",
    "the spectrum ( @xmath39 diagram ) for this case is shown in figure  [ fig : kw_oldspt ] .",
    "the solid black curve represents the theoretical curve of the @xmath0-mode in absence of the magnetic field .",
    "the fast mhd and magnetogravity modes can be separated by filtering out the @xmath0-mode .",
    "result of such separation is shown in figure  [ fig : fp_kwseprt_oldspt ] .",
    "the top row represents the original @xmath40-@xmath41 diagram ( obtained form the z - component of velocity at the photospheric level ) and @xmath40-@xmath41 diagrams obtained by filtering out @xmath0- and @xmath1-modes respectively .",
    "the white solid curve shows the theoretical position of the @xmath0-mode ridge in the absence of the magnetic field .",
    "the middle row represents maps of @xmath42 for @xmath1- and @xmath0-modes at the photospheric level at the moment @xmath36=23 min .",
    "it was shown @xcite that in case of the horizontally uniform background model and uniform inclined background magnetic field wavefronts of @xmath1- and @xmath0-modes are spatially separated after 20 - 30  min .",
    "this does not happen in the case of the non - uniform background magnitohydrostatic model .",
    "the solid black circle marks the inner part of the wavefront of @xmath1-modes .",
    "although the amplitude of the @xmath0-modes ( the right panel ) is mostly concentrated inside the circle , there is noticeable non - zero amplitude in the region outside the circle where @xmath1-modes present .",
    "it is clear , that the deformation of the wavefront ( both the shape and wave amplitude ) due to the interaction with the sunspot is much stronger for @xmath0-modes than for @xmath1-modes .",
    "the wave amplitude of the @xmath1-mode wavefront decreases at the sunspot center and quickly restores its value when the front passes through the center .",
    "the amplitude of the @xmath0-mode wavefront remains perturbed at all moments of time .",
    "according to our 3d numerical simulations of mhd wave propagation in two different models ( referred as `` shallow '' and `` deep '' ) we can point out to the following characteristic behavior of waves inside sunspots .",
    "the interaction with the sunspot changes the shape of the wave front and amplitude of the @xmath0-mode waves significantly stronger than of the @xmath1-mode waves .",
    "the amplitude of the wave front of the @xmath1-modes decreases when the wave reaches the sunspot center and restores its original value when the wave passes the center of the sunspot .",
    "the `` shallow '' model of sunspot affects waves less than the `` deep '' model .",
    "this means that the horizontal inhomogeneity of the sound speed profile inside the sunspot is mostly responsible for perturbations of the wave front . in the `` shallow '' model the horizontal distribution of the sound speed below 2",
    "mm is almost uniform and the sound speed coincides with the value in the quiet sun at the same depth .",
    "only magnetic field perturbs the wave front in this region and the total perturbation of the wave front becomes weaker than in the `` deep '' case .",
    "inside the sunspot magnetoacoustic and magnetogravity waves are not spatially separated unlike the case of the uniform inclined magnetic field .",
    "the wave amplitude inside sunspots depends on the strength of the magnetic field and the distance of the wave source from the sunspot axis .",
    "the stronger photospheric magnetic field , the bigger wave amplitude inside the sunspot ( if the source is located at the same distance from the sunspot center ) . for the source located at 9  mm from the sunspot axis the wave amplitude inside the sunspot at some moment becomes bigger than the amplitude outside .",
    "for the source located at 12 mm the wave amplitude inside the sunspot remains smaller that outside for all moments of time .",
    "in this paper , we presented initial results of 3d simulations of helioseismic mhd waves in magnetostatic sunspot models.future work includes simulations with multiple random sources for testing the travel - time measurement procedures of time - distance helioseismology , and also modeling wave propagation in the mhd models of sunspots , including flows @xcite .",
