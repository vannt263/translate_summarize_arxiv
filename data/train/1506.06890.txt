    "in this work , we study the relation between rational surfaces , long range temporal correlations and heat transport in the low shear stellarator tj - ii .",
    "the relationship between rational surfaces and heat transport has been explored in a number of earlier works , both at tj - ii  @xcite and other stellarator devices @xcite . in tokamaks , low order rational surfaces",
    "are often associated with internal transport barriers or the reduction of ( heat ) transport  @xcite . however , very little is known about the relation between rational surfaces and the hurst coefficient  @xcite , and this work will focus specifically on this issue .",
    "the hurst coefficient is a measure of the degree of long range temporal correlations  @xcite , and hence an important quantifier of anomalous transport .    in the experiments presented here ,",
    "the position of the rational surfaces is slowly scanned outwards by means of the external induction of ohmic current  @xcite , allowing the exploration of various quantities as a function of the magnetic flux by diagnostics observing at a fixed position . from doppler reflectometer ( dr ) measurements",
    ", it is found that a rational surface belonging to a low order rational ( 3/2 ) is associated with a localized variation of the radial electric field . when this rational surface crosses the dr measurement location",
    ", the hurst coefficient obtained from the dr density fluctuation amplitude is modified significantly .    in the same discharges ,",
    "we also characterize heat transport using the modulation of centrally deposited electron cyclotron resonance heating ( ecrh ) combined with radially distributed electron cyclotron emission ( ece ) temperature measurements .",
    "we observe that transport is locally enhanced when the dr hurst coefficient is increased .",
    "eight similar discharges are analyzed , showing that the obtained results are systematic and reproducible .",
    "the reported observations establish a clear link between ( a ) the modification of density fluctuation properties near a rational surface in the gradient region , associated with long range memory effects , and ( b ) enhanced heat transport .",
    "the interpretation of these observations finds support from a model  @xcite , showing that the radial electric field structure and the hurst coefficient are both modified close to the rational surface .",

    "are determined using a fourier analysis of the @xmath8 data .    assuming transport is diffusive it is possible , in principle , to extract diffusive transport parameters ( such as the effective diffusivity and convective velocity ) from these data .",
    "however , we refrain from doing so , as the uncertainties introduced by assuming a specific transport model , as well as the ill - posed nature of the problem , do not allow obtaining a clear and unambiguous interpretation of the transport processes inside the plasma from such an inversion  @xcite . instead",
    ", we will represent the amplitude and relative phase directly , noting that the gradient of the relative phase is directly linked to the speed of the transport  @xcite .",

    ", a finite tilt angle is purposely introduced between the incident probing beam and the normal to the reflecting cut - off layer , and the bragg back - scattered signal is measured  @xcite .",
    "the amplitude of the recorded signal is a measure of the intensity of the density fluctuations , @xmath10 . as the plasma rotates in the reflecting plane ( a flux surface ) , the scattered signal experiences a doppler shift .",
    "the size of this shift is directly proportional to the rotation velocity of the plasma turbulence perpendicular to the magnetic field lines , @xmath11 , and therefore to the plasma background @xmath12 velocity , provided the latter dominates over the phase velocity of density fluctuations  @xcite .",

    ", we will be using the hurst coefficient as a measure of long - range correlations .",
    "this coefficient provides an estimate of the degree to which transport deviates from normal diffusive transport .",

    "the value of @xmath26 thus obtained corresponds to asymptotic times , close to the confinement time of the plasma .",
    "note that the dr sampling rate is 10 mhz , so that 10 ms of data corresponds to @xmath30 data points , providing ample statistics for the determination of the hurst coefficient . even though the plasma state is varying constantly due to the ramped plasma current , these changes are sufficiently slow to consider the density fluctuation amplitude measurement to be essentially in steady state during the analysis time windows of 10 ms . modifying the length of these time windows by a factor of two hardly affects the results , confirming this statement .",

    "[ cog_hurst ] , discharge 29782 ) , which in turn is related to the radial extension of the magnetic island  @xcite .",
    "thus , a possible explanation for this phenomenon is that the modulated component of @xmath6 is weak inside the island o - point region as it sweeps past the observation point .",
    "even so , the modulation of the centrally deposited ecrh power does reach adjacent ece channels , so this effect occurs only at specific radii .",
    "no important profile flattening is observed , within the resolution of the diagnostic  @xcite .",
    "thus , the reason for the disappearance of the modulated component could be related to the magnetic topology , the island being isolated from the main plasma , and/or the relatively strong sheared flow associated with the rational , in combination with a significant local gradient .    again , to show how systematic this reduction of the modulated component of @xmath6 is , we calculate an average over the 8 mentioned discharges . for this purpose ,",

    "@xmath68 is defined as the rms amplitude of the measured @xmath47 data , after band - pass filtering in the frequency range @xmath69 khz .",

    ", the island o - point region is topologically separate from the main plasma and/or characterized by a significant sheared flow ( at least , in the present case ) , which would reduce the modulated component of @xmath6 in this region .",
    "thus , the regions in fig .  [ ece_noise_vs_amp ] with high values of @xmath65 ( i.e. , low modulation amplitude ) would correspond to island o - point regions and/or sheared flow regions .",
    "such regions with high @xmath65 can of course only be observed clearly ( at the fixed ece measurement positions ) if the island is large and stationary , and/or the sheared flow is strong . apparently , this condition is met when the rational 3/2 surface ( moving outward ) reaches @xmath70 , which is the density gradient region . at earlier times ,",
    "when the rational is further inward , the island may be smaller and/or rotating , such that @xmath65 is smaller .",
    "the zone of relatively high @xmath65 seen at @xmath71 is possibly associated with another rational ( @xmath72 ) ; cf .",
    "fig .  [ track ] . in view of the above argument",
    ", this 7/5 mode must also be stationary to be visible ; yet it is not located in the gradient region . therefore , we speculate that its apparent stationarity is a consequence of mode locking with the stationary 3/2 mode .",
    "note that the total magnetic field , @xmath73 , varies by less than 0.5% due to the varying plasma current , so that the radial locations of the ece channels , inversely proportional to @xmath73 , may be considered fixed .",

    "these small transport barriers tend to trap particles , leading to local subdiffusive behavior , as reported in @xcite .",
    "therefore , a reduction of the hurst coefficient below 0.5 is expected in the barrier regions . on the other hand ,",
    "experimental studies have shown that @xmath26 is systematically large in the plasma edge region  @xcite and varies with the global gradients  @xcite .    to study the correlation between the zonal flows associated with low order rationals and the hurst coefficient , we have performed a simulation of the magnetohydrodynamic turbulence induced by resistive interchange modes in a periodic cylinder .",
    "details of this type of modeling can be found in ref .",
    "we have not attempted to match the experimental situation closely , due to the difficulty of reproducing a gradual modification of the rotational transform in time , induced by an increasing plasma current . here , we limit ourselves to studying the possible relation between low order rational surfaces , zonal flow generation and the hurst coefficient . for this purpose ,",
    "we have taken one of the standard rotational transform profiles of tj - ii , the case labelled 100_46 in fig .",
    "[ iota ] , using a pressure profile that is close to the experimental one . because the rotational transform has low shear , the low order rational surfaces produce magnetic islands of a significant width , facilitating the detection of regions with potential subdiffusion .",

    "note that this mean flow is different from the perpendicular flow measured in the experiment by dr , which is instantaneous and local , and hence may be very sensitive to the precise poloidal and toroidal location of the measurement ( i.e. , the phase of the stationary island ) . if we compare the averaged flow near a singular surface to the instantaneous poloidal flow , cf .",
    "[ ben_b ] , one observes that the latter is not symmetric with respect to the singular surface , and that the asymmetry may vary .",
    "this would explain the asymmetric appearance of the poloidal flow with respect to the rational surface observed in the experiment .",
    "the @xmath26 coefficient is determined by at least two effects .",
    "one is the generation of long range correlations by avalanches , and the other is their suppression due to decorrelation by sheared flow .",
    "avalanches are non - local phenomena , but in the plasma core region avalanches are relatively rare and they tend to correlate with the gradient , as they originate there .",
    "the edge , however , is crossed by many avalanches initiated in the entire plasma , so no relation is expected between the local gradient and the @xmath26 exponent . at the plasma edge , the @xmath26 exponent tends to be above @xmath86  @xcite . in fig .",

    "this is consistent with the systematic reduction of @xmath26 at rational surfaces observed in the model discussed in section  [ modeling ] .",

    "in these experiments at tj - ii , an externally driven oh current was used to modify the rotational transform profile , @xmath97 , and slowly move the rational surfaces outward through the plasma . as the main rational @xmath0 moved past the dr observation points , the perpendicular propagation velocity of the turbulence , @xmath11  equivalent to the radial electric field , @xmath88 ",
    "was found to experience a significant ` wiggle ' . taking the time of strongest temporal variation of @xmath11 as a reference",
    ", 8 similar discharges were analyzed .",
    "small rotating mhd modes , were detected by bolometry , with decreasing frequency , consistent with the radial outward motion of the rational surface locations .",
    "once the @xmath0 rational was well inside the density gradient region , the corresponding island grew and was found to be stationary .",
    "no clear flattening of profiles was observed , which could be consistent with expectations for small magnetic shear  @xcite .",
    "however , it was found that the modulated heat deposited in the core plasma only penetrated weakly in the zone associated with the stationary island .",
    "the hurst coefficient was found to be low ( @xmath35 ) at the rational surface ( fig .",
    "[ cog_hurst ] ) and systematically high ( @xmath98 ) inward from the @xmath0 rational surface ( fig .",
    "[ mean_cog_h ] ) , as long as the rational surface was located well inside the density gradient region .",
    "the analysis of ece data revealed that radial heat transport was enhanced in the region inward from the large island .",
    "simulations of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence induced by resistive interchange modes reproduced some of these observations qualitatively , namely : ( 1 ) the variation of poloidal flow profiles associated with rational surfaces , and ( 2 ) the variation of the hurst coefficient associated with rational surfaces and local pressure gradients .",
    "thus , this work establishes a clear correlation between density fluctuation long range temporal correlation properties ( quantified via the hurst coefficient ) and enhanced heat transport in the presence of a large island , possibly providing the first direct observation of the turbulent mechanism behind anomalous heat transport .",
