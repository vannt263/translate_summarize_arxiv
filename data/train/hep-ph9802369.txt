    "dispersion relations in field theory represent nothing more than the application of cauchy s theorem to green functions , and yet information obtained from these identities continues to provide fascinating new insights into systems difficult or impossible to probe with other techniques .",
    "the natural advantage of the dispersive approach within qcd is that its incorporation of nonperturbative information is fully rigorous and model independent , since it works directly with hadronic green functions in the contour integral .",
    "thanks to cauchy s theorem , the same quantity may be evaluated at a kinematic point where perturbative qcd provides the best physical description of the green function .    and",
    "yet the physical input is minimal .",
    "nothing has been included from the fundamental theory except for the value of the green function at a single point and the existence of hadronic bound states of given quantum numbers .",
    "clearly , qcd dispersion relations provide only a bare framework of conditions that green functions must satisfy in order to be consistent with qcd ( or any well defined field theory ) , namely unitarity in the form of quark - hadron duality , crossing symmetry , and analyticity outside of poles and cuts with locations dictated by physical particle thresholds .",
    "there still remains a large space of possible hadronic green functions , each of which satisfies the dispersive constraints .",
    "nevertheless , the constraints can be surprisingly restrictive , especially when a small amount of additional physical input , such as data or the result of some model calculation , is included .",
    "it follows that constructing models manifestly satisfying dispersive constraints is an economical way of enforcing consistency with the basic features of qcd .",
    "the particular formulation of dispersion relations presented here focuses upon obtaining bounds on both the size and shape of electroweak form factors ; this is a very old game , dating back into the early 1960s@xcite , long before the advent of qcd .",
    "the essential notion is the computation of the current two - point correlator in two ways : at a point deep in the euclidean region of momentum transfer @xmath1 , and as an integral over the cut generated by on - shell hadronic states produced by the current .",
    "components of the correlator are chosen so that both sides are positive definite , implying that the neglect of contributions from some of the hadronic states leads to a strict inequality on the hadronic amplitudes , _",
    "i.e. _ , form factors .",
    "the inequality thus obtained is expressed as a weighted integral of squared form factors over the kinematic cut in @xmath1 corresponding to production of these hadrons . assuming only that the branch point @xmath2 of this cut is the lowest real value of @xmath1 where the green function exhibits non - analytic behavior , analytic continuation to the rest of the complex @xmath1 plane carries the inequality to other kinematic regions .",
    "the inclusion of perturbative qcd green functions in these studies was first made in ref .",
    "subsequently , it was observed that the most general space of analytic functions satisfying the dispersive bounds obeys a simple parameterization@xcite , which led to a number of applications in the study of semileptonic decays , in which it is the weak current that appears in the correlator .",
    "recent applications use only data below @xmath2 to restrict possible form factors .",
    "surely data from @xmath3 must provide additional restrictions ; however , for the semileptonic case this would require data from pair production via a weak current , which is beyond current experimental capabilities .",
    "instead , we focus here on electromagnetic form factors , where data in the timelike region is abundant .",
    "nevertheless , the mathematical techniques are the same .",
    "we show that data from the timelike region applied to the parameterization of ref .",
    "@xcite leads to a number of new sum rules on the parameters , which may be incorporated in an improved parameterization .",
    "these sum rules permit a more complete characterization of the form factor at all values of @xmath1 .    as an explicit example , we consider the elastic @xmath0 form factor and show that fits to the world sample of timelike data lead to predictions on the spacelike behavior of the form factor , particularly its normalization at @xmath4 and the pion charge radius .",
    "these predictions turn out to be very loose , but we shall see that this is the result of gaps in the data resulting from the fact little data has been taken near the pair production threshold @xmath5 .",
    "the same parameterization using spacelike data yields an excellent fit , in particular to the normalization of the form factor at @xmath4 and the pion charge radius .    in sec .",
    "ii we review the derivation of the parameterization from dispersive bounds , with an eye toward its application to electromagnetic form factors .",
    "section iii demonstrates the extension of the dispersive bound to the inclusion of timelike data , and its effect on the parameterization . in sec .",
    "iv we discuss issues of convergence of the parameterization in the timelike region , and observations made in this inquiry lead us , in sec .",
    "v , to develop an improved parameterization .",
    "section vi presents the result of fits to the elastic @xmath0 form factor and discusses at length the quality of the fits and extrapolations from timelike to spacelike regions .",
    "we also compare the results to direct fits to spacelike data using the same parameterization , as well as fits from the literature .",
    "section vii summarizes possible improvements and concludes .",
    "much of this discussion is patterned on that in ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein , but appears here again for clarity in understanding what is to follow .",
    "we begin with the qcd two - point function of a vectorlike current @xmath6 ; in the electromagnetic case , this is simply the conserved vector current @xmath7 .",
    "the polarization tensor is defined by @xmath8 and in the case of a conserved current @xmath9 , the polarization function @xmath10 vanishes .",
    "the remaining function @xmath11 is rendered finite in qcd by making two subtractions , leading to the dispersion relation @xmath12 the function @xmath13 may be computed reliably in the perturbative qcd operator product expansion for values of @xmath14 far from the kinematic region where the current @xmath9 can create on - shell hadronic states ; for any light quark current and @xmath15 , this condition reads @xmath16 .    inserting a complete set of states @xmath17 into the two - point function relates @xmath18 to the production rate of hadrons from a virtual photon , @xmath19 where the sum is over all hadronic states @xmath17 with the same quantum numbers as the current @xmath9 , weighted by phase space .",
    "it follows from the dispersion relation ( [ chis ] ) that the perturbatively evaluated @xmath20 equals the integrated production rate of @xmath21 weighted with a smooth function of momentum transfer squared @xmath1 . since the sum is positive semidefinite , one may restrict attention to a subset of hadronic states to obtain a strict inequality . in the case discussed in this paper , @xmath22 , and we restrict to @xmath23 .",
    "this places an upper bound on the electromagnetic @xmath0 form factor @xmath24 in the pair - production region that takes the form @xmath25 from the dispersion relation eq .",
    "( [ chis ] ) . here",
    "@xmath26 is a computable function of @xmath1 that depends on phase space and the quantum numbers of the particular form factor under consideration .    using analyticity to turn ( [ tbd ] ) into a constraint in the spacelike region in @xmath1",

    "lacking poles , the quantity @xmath52 , is expected to be analytic within the unit disc,@xcite , @xmath53 , or @xmath54 cases they are absent .",
    "moreover , we here correct an oversight of these previous works : for on - shell multiparticle resonances of the correlator or triangle - type anomalous threshold diagrams , the kinematics of the internal particles is completely fixed , meaning that the singularity in @xmath1 is a pole , not a cut . ] and may be expanded in a set of orthonormal functions that are simply powers of @xmath55 .",
    "the result of expanding in @xmath55 is an expression for @xmath24 valid even in the spacelike region , @xmath56 where , as a result of eq .",
    "( [ dispz ] ) , the coefficients @xmath57 are unknown constants obeying @xmath58 the functions @xmath42 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 are real by construction for @xmath61 .",
    "moreover , physical cuts in the form factor , which lie on the real axis , generate discontinuities only in the imaginary part of @xmath62 .",
    "since there is no physical distinction between the upper and lower complex half - planes , one must have @xmath63 for all real @xmath1 , and consequently the form factor satisfies the schwarz reflection principle .",
    "half plane , and the schwarz reflection principle continues it into the lower half plane . ]",
    "it follows from analytic continuation away from the cut that the form factor is real on the real @xmath1 axis below threshold , which maps to the real @xmath48 axis , and therefore that the coefficients @xmath57 are real .",
    "the constraints derived in the previous section require no input from the value of the form factor @xmath24 for @xmath3 . clearly , if such information is supplied from another source such as direct measurement , the bound provided by , _",
    "e.g. _ , ( [ tbd ] ) should be strengthened . in terms of the equivalent bound of eq .",
    "( [ dispz ] ) , such data appears on a segment of the unit circle in @xmath48 .",
    "suppose that one is given data for @xmath24 from threshold up to some @xmath64 . according to ( [ zblaschke ] )",

    "( [ dispz ] ) directly on the unit circle ; here the blaschke factor @xmath70 is unimodular , and so we may express this input as follows : @xmath71 .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since the value of the modulus @xmath72 is invariant under reflection about the cut ( which corresponds to @xmath73 ) , the left hand side of the corresponding expression for @xmath74 is identical , while the right hand side flips the sign of the sine term ; this term must therefore vanish .",
    "equivalently , noting that the left hand side is real and recalling from sec .",
    "ii that the @xmath57 s are real , the purely imaginary sine term must again vanish .",
    "yet another way of seeing the same result is by using @xmath75 and writing the full term as @xmath76 which is pure imaginary and vanishes trivially if all the @xmath57 s are real .",
    "we are therefore left with one nontrivial sum rule : @xmath77 we arrive at the mathematical result that allows for anaylsis of timelike data .",
    "its derivation has been exceptionally straightforward , but a number of comments are in order before proceeding .    first , the derivation is completely consistent with the constraint ( [ abound ] ) .",
    "indeed , integrating @xmath78 over the unit circle gives @xmath79 , and thus ( [ newsuma ] ) integrates to ( [ abound ] ) , using ( [ dispz ] ) .",
    "second , although the first line of ( [ deriv ] ) is written as a perfect square , exploiting the reality of the @xmath57 s means that it is more convenient to combine the two sums as in ( [ newsuma ] ) .",
    "this is because the sum rule applies to the magnitude of @xmath62 for @xmath80 .",
    "although phase data on above - threshold form factors exists in some cases , typically it is data for @xmath81 above threshold that is presented in experimental papers .",
    "indeed , the very nature of our dispersion relations [ see ( [ tbd ] ) ] precludes our use of such phase information .",
    "third , we immediately see from taking particular values of @xmath82 in ( [ deriv ] ) , or even from its first line , two very interesting special cases : @xmath83 clearly , conditions on @xmath84 or @xmath62 at these special points provide strong constraints on the parameters .",
    "we explore this next .",
    "in the last section we manipulated infinite series without regard to the fine points of convergence . does the derivation of our sum rules suffer from the possibility that some of these actions are ill - defined ? in this section",
    "we show that this is not the case .",
    "the central convergence problem may be posed as follows : in deriving ( [ abound ] ) , we use the analyticity of the combination @xmath85 inside the unit circle to expand it in the taylor series @xmath86 .",
    "since physical information `` along the cut '' actually appears at values of momentum transfer an infinitesimal distance from the genuine cut [ @xmath87 , it follows that this data is actually infinitesimally inside the unit circle in @xmath48 , where the geometric series @xmath88 is still ( barely ) convergent .",
    "the finiteness of analytic complex functions on a compact region such as the disc @xmath89 , @xmath90 , gives one sense in which the sum @xmath86 has meaning as a finite number , through geometric convergence . on the other hand , for @xmath91",
    "the expression @xmath86 is defined as the value of the quantity @xmath92 along ( the appropriate side of ) the cut , which exists since the only place where this combination is ill defined , the cut @xmath93 , has been mapped so that its two sides are sent to the two separated halves of the unit circle in @xmath48 .",
    "these two expressions for @xmath94 at @xmath91 are equal due to a theorem of abel s : in words , since analyticity demands that the power series @xmath86 converges for all @xmath95 , and since its value at @xmath91 is defined , the @xmath96 limit of the former equals the latter .",
    "therefore , the expansion as an infinite power series in @xmath48 with @xmath91 is true as a formal statement , but does it have meaning as a useful series with rapidly converging partial sums when we do not invoke the technicality that we are `` just inside '' the unit circle ?    the utility of the expansion in @xmath48 , when continued to the sub - threshold region for semileptonic decays , depends on its geometric convergence , using @xmath97 inside the unit circle and the boundedness of the @xmath57 s _ via _ ( [ abound ] ) .",
    "it follows in that case that only the first few @xmath57 s are required to describe the form factor over the entire semileptonic region@xcite .",
    "however , @xmath98 on the unit circle , and so geometric convergence fails completely .",
    "_  priori _",
    "it seems that an arbitrarily large number of @xmath57 s is required to describe the form factor in the region @xmath80 .",
    "yet things are not so bleak .",
    "we now show that the analyticity structure plus some mild physical assumptions tells us much about the convergence properties of the parameterization , even on the unit circle @xmath98 .    to begin with , in order to use parseval s theorem rigorously to prove ( [ abound ] ) , one must be able to exchange the order of sum @xmath86 and integral in @xmath48 ; for this purpose , we demand the sufficient condition that @xmath86 is uniformly convergent in @xmath48 for @xmath98 .",
    "now , @xmath99 is by physical assumption a bounded , smooth , continuous function on the compact region represented by either half of the unit circle . and @xmath100 have no singularities on @xmath91 , as discussed below , so our statements refer to the behavior of @xmath101 .",
    "resonances above threshold have finite widths and residues , so @xmath101 is also smooth , and we assume that @xmath101 is finite as @xmath102 ,",
    "_ i.e. _ , @xmath103 .",
    "finally , the one - sided limit @xmath104 along the circle is assumed to exist .",
    "] however , even with these assumptions , uniform convergence could be spoiled by a region of @xmath48 where the form factor is not smooth in @xmath48 even though it is smooth in the original kinematic variable @xmath1 .",
    "the only region fitting this description is @xmath105 , which is compressed into the finite region @xmath106 , @xmath91 .",
    "that is , a form factor could continue to oscillate smoothly in @xmath1 all the way out to infinity , but mapped to @xmath48 this behavior would appear to oscillate wildly .",
    "we therefore make the additional physical assumption that @xmath101 becomes _ featurelessly _ smooth for @xmath107 in order to guarantee uniform convergence in @xmath48 and thus the proof of ( [ abound ] ) .",
    "now we may consider the full power of ( [ abound ] ) .",
    "rather than using only the boundedness of each term as in the geometric case , we recognize that the absolute convergence of the sum of @xmath108 implies that for sufficiently large @xmath109 , @xmath110 falls off faster than @xmath111 . in a statistical sense .",
    "individual terms may deviate above or below the given @xmath109 dependence , but the overall pattern of the terms is bounded by the stated behaviors . ] notice that , although this new criterion restricts the pattern of @xmath57 s , the condition of convergence of @xmath86 is still stronger . for , one could imagine , for example , that the true form factor has @xmath112 , which satisfies @xmath113 but clearly leads to divergence of @xmath86 at @xmath114 .",
    "to proceed further , we need additional input .    up to this point , we have ignored the specific form of the function @xmath59 . in the notation of @xcite ,",
    "one begins with @xmath115 where @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 , and @xmath119 are integers specific to the form factor under consideration , and @xmath120 is an isospin clebsch - gordan factor . in the electromagnetic case for pseudoscalars , only the form factor analogous to @xmath121 in @xmath122 appears , for which @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 , and @xmath126 .",
    "the kinematic factors are simply an expression of two - body phase space , with @xmath127 for @xmath128 decays , which for the elastic case simplifies to @xmath129 , @xmath130 .",
    "the manipulations described in sec .",
    "ii lead to @xmath131 a more convenient expression for @xmath132 with @xmath80 reads @xmath133 note in particular that @xmath134 as @xmath135 , while @xmath136 as @xmath102 .",
    "the vanishing of the first limit indicates powers of the spatial momentum [ @xmath137 for the vector form factor ] of the pair created near threshold , while the vanishing of the second limit indicates the asymptotic unitarizing behavior of @xmath138 .",
    "making only the mild physical assumptions that the form factor @xmath62 is not infinite at threshold and does not grow as @xmath102 [ already assumed in proving ( [ abound ] ) ] , ( [ pirule ] ) and ( [ zrule ] ) give the sum rules @xmath139 or equivalently , @xmath140 further improvements are possible if one considers the particular nature of the vanishing of @xmath59 as @xmath135 .",
    "since the parameters @xmath57 are defined with respect to the variable @xmath48 , this is most obvious if one considers @xmath84 as a function of @xmath48 rather than @xmath1 , in which one sees@xcite that @xmath141 . for all form factors studied in that paper , @xmath142 or 3 , which originates from the suppression of pair production by @xmath143 at threshold . for @xmath144 , not only",

    ". thus one may reorder terms in the sums , as was implicit in the proof of eq .",
    "( [ newsuma ] ) .",
    "moreover , in the case of the vector form factor ( @xmath123 ) , the second and third expressions together tell us that in fact @xmath160 at least as fast as @xmath161 .",
    "this leads to a tremendous improvement in our knowledge of convergence of @xmath86 on the circle .",
    "about @xmath162 leads to the same convergence for the scalar form factor in processes with non - conserved currents .",

    "the relative error of the partial sum @xmath163 from its exact value of @xmath164 is bounded by @xmath165 .",
    "we find that only 3 terms are required for a 20% relative error , 6 for 10% , and 60 for 1% . in principle",
    ", it should be very a simple matter to fit the coarse structure of the form factor over its entire kinematic range with very few parameters ; even such a structure as the large resonant @xmath166 peak may be accommodated by this quasi - fourier analysis .",
    "however , it turns out that this expectation is unfulfilled , for reasons that we now discuss .",
    "the problem is that we do not know which of the @xmath57 s are most important in this convergence .",
    "that is , they are not necessarily the first few @xmath167 , as for the semileptonic decays or more generally for any spacelike factor , where moments about @xmath168 ( @xmath169 ) dominate .",
    "however , the constraint ( [ abound ] ) tells us that , if this set is appreciable in magnitude , there is little room for higher @xmath57 s ; this leads to a rapid convergence in @xmath109 , and consequently , one obtains a unified picture of the form factor spanning both spacelike and timelike regions .",
    "the alternate possibility is that one could have many @xmath57 s much smaller than the saturation paradigm @xmath161 , so that convergence is painfully slow in @xmath109 ; in this case , the fit to timelike data voraciously demands ever higher @xmath57 s and is relatively insensitive to the lowest coefficients , so that the spacelike data is relatively unconstrained by the timelike data",
    ". a detailed fit to data is required to determine which scenario is realized .",
    "we pause momentarily to review the assumptions made to obtain appropriate convergence properties of the parameterization .",
    "convergence of the series @xmath86 for @xmath93 is obtained by requiring @xmath101 to be a bounded , smooth , continuous function , while in obtaining the sum rule ( [ abound ] ) , we additionally assume that @xmath101 becomes _ featurelessly _ smooth as @xmath170",
    ". absolute convergence of the series uses the particular forms of @xmath152 and @xmath84 , and the assumption that @xmath171 near @xmath155 is no more singular than @xmath172 .",

    "after the detailed discussion of the series @xmath86 and its properties , it may seem incongruous to introduce a new parameterization for the form factor . yet it is entirely appropriate to do so , since it is more natural to incorporate the sum rules ( [ sum1 ] ) and ( [ sum2 ] ) directly into the parameterization than to impose them by hand .",
    "the sort of trouble one might encounter by using the parameterization in @xmath57 s becomes clear with reflection upon the content of the sum rules ( [ sum2 ] ) .",
    "one may impose explicit constraints on a truncated set @xmath175 to enforce the vanishing of the first two of these as well as the first expression in ( [ sum1 ] ) , for example by fixing @xmath176 , @xmath177 , and @xmath178 by means of the sum rules and the values of @xmath179 .",
    "but then these sum rules , which came from certain limits of the parameterization in @xmath48 , might be accomplished in perverse ways .",
    "for example , the final expression in ( [ sum2 ] ) may be finite but exceptionally large , leaving @xmath180 essentially unbounded .",

    "moreover , without the sum rules that produced a strongly convergent series in @xmath57 , the convergence of the series in @xmath187 follows no guaranteed pattern but still may give an adequate fit .",
    "we will see that this is in fact true for the @xmath0 form factor .",
    "an important aspect of the transformation between the parameters @xmath57 and @xmath187 represented by ( [ bdef ] ) is that both series require only a small number of parameters to describe the form factor in the vicinity of @xmath168 ; such behavior is necessary for a useful and minimal description of the spacelike form factor around @xmath169 .",
    "specifically , one finds @xmath199 and so forth .",
    "the essential conundrum in obtaining a parameterization valid in both spacelike and timelike regions is that , in the spacelike region , or at least near @xmath169 where data is abundant , it can not be very different from the parameterizations in @xmath57 or @xmath187 discussed above .",
    "that is , it must have a rapidly converging taylor series about @xmath168 . on the other hand , it must be able to recognize strongly localized structures in the timelike region @xmath91 , such as the @xmath166 resonance in the present case .",

    "to summarize , the parameter basis @xmath57 admits a number of sum rules from timelike constraints which give rise to a strongly convergent behavior .",
    "it also admits the very simple dispersive bound ( [ abound ] ) , but may exhibit pathological behavior in fits to timelike data . the parameter basis @xmath187 has all of the sum rules built in and is much more stable in timelike fits , but its dispersive bound ( [ bbound ] ) is much more complicated , and in general may converge much more slowly .",
    "both bases are useful in the spacelike region , while it requires a fit to data to determine whether either is useful in the timelike region .",
    "our intent is to study the possibility of using the considerable @xmath53 production data in the timelike region @xmath31 , from which the form factor @xmath200 is extracted , to fit to the parameters @xmath187 as determined from the analytic structure of the qcd dispersion relation ( [ chis ] ) and expressed by ( [ phitilde])([bcond ] ) .",
    "of particular interest is the number @xmath201 of parameters necessary to give a good accounting of the data , and what these parameters tell us about the shape of the form factor in the spacelike region , where there exists considerable data from @xmath202 elastic scattering .",
    "let us first consider the calculation of the current two - point correlator , as represented by its subtracted form @xmath203 in ( [ chis ] ) . as noted in sec .",
    "ii , this quantity possesses a well defined operator product expansion in inverse powers of @xmath204 .",
    "the first few terms are particularly simple in the case of the light quarks @xmath205 and @xmath206 . neglecting subleading mass corrections , @xmath207 note that the @xmath208 condensate has been included , despite the vanishing of the quark mass @xmath209 , to indicate its place in the expansion .",
    "the electromagnetic current bilinear @xmath210 induces an extra factor of @xmath211 in @xmath212 through the quark charges .",
    "our goal is to choose @xmath204 as small as possible in order to maximize the stringency of the dispersive bound through perturbative qcd input , but large enough that the perturbative expansion remains valid .",
    "although numerical estimates for the first few condensates certainly exist in the literature , we use them principally to establish that region in @xmath204 for which convergence of the expansion is satisfactory and to obtain a numerical uncertainty on the lowest - order result . to be specific , we use @xmath213 = 0.020.06 gev@xmath214 and the expression for @xmath215 from the three - loop beta function with @xmath216 and @xmath217 mev . values for the @xmath218 correction and the gluon condensate relative to leading order are presented in table i for various values of @xmath204 .",
    "we learn that corrections become quite large for @xmath219 gev@xmath220 .",
    "although the @xmath221 correction and the gluon condensate have opposite signs , large uncertainties on the latter prevent one from knowing how complete this cancellation might be .",
    "moreover , even with a realistically small but finite quark mass , the @xmath208 condensate becomes of relative size @xmath222% by @xmath223 gev@xmath220 .",
    "we therefore conservatively choose @xmath224 gev@xmath220 , estimating corrections to the lowest order result to be no more than 15% .",
    "we thus obtain @xmath225 .    the isospin factor @xmath120 in eq .",
    "( [ phioft ] ) for the pion case is set to unity ; in previous cases , more than one isospin channel could couple to the current @xmath6 in the same dispersion relation so that @xmath226 , thus strengthening the expression ( [ masterparam ] ) . in the @xmath0 case",
    "this is no longer possible .",
    "as we have pointed out , @xmath227 pairs can not couple to a vector current due to charge conjugation .",
    "moreover the electromagnetic current possesses both @xmath228 and 1 amplitudes , so an improvement through @xmath120 with other contributions to the dispersive bound would first require disentangling these amplitudes .",
    "the dispersive bounds may also be strengthened by the inclusion of perturbative qcd information along the cut in the deep minkowski region @xmath102 , as in @xcite .",
    "however , we opt not to do so in this work , for in this approach one must not only select a point @xmath229 for the onset of this region , but employ the perturbative expression over the whole interval @xmath230 for inclusion in the dispersion integral .",
    "the uncertainties are therefore those of the integrated perturbative result , rather than those of just one point in the euclidean case . for our purposes here , we prefer the more minimal approach of using only deep euclidean qcd calculations .",
    "we select the parameter @xmath231 .",
    "this natural choice means that @xmath168 occurs where current conservation normalizes the form factor @xmath232 to unity , the charge of the pion .",
    "it further means that the form factor near this point is well determined by the first few @xmath187 s , owing to the geometric convergence of @xmath182 . of course , such convergence is contingent upon the small size of @xmath233 , which is not so obvious as that of the @xmath110 [ compare ( [ abound ] ) and ( [ bbound ] ) ] but is empirically true in our fits .",
    "explicitly , the normalization of the form factor and the pion charge radius @xmath234 are given by @xmath235 .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the experimental data for the form factor in the timelike region is collected from a number of sources@xcite , and each data point is regarded as having significance entirely determined by its stated uncertainty .",
    "this set contains many dozens of points stretching from @xmath236 to almost 10 gev@xmath220 and covers decades of experiment , although the most recent published measurements are already over ten years old . to be precise",
    ", our sample consists of 145 timelike data points , which gives the absolute upper limit of the number @xmath201 of parameters @xmath187 one may hope to extract from the data ; more on this in a moment .",
    "we minimize @xmath237 with regard to the unknown parameters @xmath187 subject to the sum rule @xmath238 by using the levenberg - marquardt method@xcite .",
    "naturally , the topology described by a function with scores of parameters utterly escapes intuitive expectations about where the minimum might lie , so several choices of parameters for the initial iteration are selected to test the proper convergence of the algorithm to the global minimum .",
    "typically , on each given run the program finds the same @xmath239 to within a few tenths of a percent .",
    "uncertainties on the parameters are estimated by means of the covariance matrix , despite the fact that ( [ newsumb ] ) is quadratic rather than linear in the parameters @xmath187 .",
    "indeed , the two sets @xmath240 trivially give the same fit , but we select @xmath241 to guarantee the positivity of the form factor at @xmath242 . the program is permitted to wander freely in @xmath243 parameter space without imposing the constraint ( [ newsumb ] ) ; the degree of saturation of this bound , which expresses quark - hadron duality , is computed at the end of the fit and is observed to satisfy the bound in all cases .",
    "the 15% uncertainty in the perturbative value of @xmath244 appears as a systematic uncertainty in the parameters @xmath187 since @xmath245 , so that the dispersive bound @xmath246 has a linear uncertainty in @xmath247 , meaning that the 1 on the r.h.s .",
    "is to be replaced by 1.15 .",
    "the figure of merit in these fits is @xmath237 per degree of freedom ( d.o.f . ) , where the number d.o.f . is the number of data points minus the number of fit parameters @xmath201 .",
    "obviously the average variance of the fit value of the form factor from data decreases as @xmath201 is increased , but the d.o.f .",
    "denominator eventually compensates for this advantage , and so there exists a particular value of @xmath201 such that @xmath237/d.o.f . achieves a minimum . for our sample of 145 data points , this occurs for about 60 parameters @xmath187 .",
    "there is another reason to choose @xmath201 substantially smaller than the number of data points .",
    "if we think of the fit as being essentially a decomposition into fourier modes ( as evidenced by the fact that our basis functions are @xmath248 on the unit circle ) , then extracting a number of parameters comparable to the number of data points is analogous to probing modes with wavelengths as small as the spacing between these points .",
    "spurious high - frequency oscillations then appear in the fit , and the same phenomenon is observed in the present case . if one fits not to isolated data points but a model with a continuous prediction for the form factor , then one is free to expand to arbitrarily high harmonics ; the oscillations are an effect of finite experimental resolution .    in fact",
    ", these spurious oscillations tend to be compounded with even more dramatic effects when we attempt to extrapolate from the data - rich regions around the @xmath166 peak down to @xmath2 : the oscillations assume huge proportions , many times larger than the @xmath166 peak itself , with the few data points far below the peak nestling themselves in the minima of these oscillations ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the cause of this particular misfortune has a very simple origin : analyticity in @xmath48 is precisely not the same as analyticity in @xmath1 , and the map ( [ zblaschke ] ) is not conformal at the point @xmath249 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath155 .",
    "this is obvious from geometric considerations : whereas in @xmath1 space segments of the real axis below and above @xmath2 are parallel , the corresponding segments of the unit disk in @xmath48 are the real axis and the two halves of the unit circle , which make @xmath250 angles in antiparallel directions at @xmath155 .",
    "indeed , the jacobian of the map is given by @xmath251 meaning that _ any _ parameterization in the variable @xmath48 has problems as @xmath135 .",
    "and yet this is a necessary feature of the dispersive analyticity constraints : it is @xmath48 , and not @xmath1 , that is the natural kinematic variable for describing the analyticity of the form factor .",
    "additional physical requirements or a greater density of data are necessary in order to impose smoothness on the form factor in the region near @xmath2 .",
    "6.0 truein      our best fit to the form factor over the timelike region appears in fig .  1 .",
    "as stated above , the fit uses @xmath252 parameters @xmath253 and has a @xmath239/d.o.f .",
    "this large value , despite the visual goodness of the fit in the figure , can be explained by the mild inconsistency of data from numerous different experiments , as well as the famous `` @xmath254 shoulder '' due to the presence of destructive interference between the narrow @xmath254 and broad @xmath166 peaks .",
    "the shoulder represents a sudden , nearly discontinuous change in the form factor , which is difficult to simulate using only the lower harmonics . indeed , eliminating the 15 data points in the immediate vicinity of this shoulder from the fit diminishes @xmath255/d.o.f .",
    "by more than 1/3 ; of course , the oscillations in the fit below the @xmath166 peak remain .",
    "a third possible explanation is that @xmath237 is large because @xmath256 might be required to fit the data adequately .",
    "however , suppose one considers not @xmath255/d.o.f .",
    "but rather @xmath255/_datum _ and fit to 200 parameters ( approaching the limitations of modern workstations ) . ignoring the numerous spurious oscillations produced by this stretch , we find that @xmath255/_datum _ decreases from 1.85 to 0.75 , _",
    "i.e. _ , much slower than linearly with @xmath201 .",
    "the degree of saturation in the best fit , namely , the fit value for the l.h.s . of ( [ newsumb ] ) divided by the loosened bound of 1.15 , turns out to be 0.466 , meaning that charged pions and resonances coupled to them account for about half the dual perturbative result at @xmath257 .    using eq .",
    "( [ slike ] ) , the values for the spacelike parameters extracted from the @xmath252 fit are given by @xmath258 on the surface , this is not a very impressive set of results , considering the values extracted directly from the spacelike data@xcite : @xmath259 what has gone wrong ? to sharpen this complaint , we observe that even after fitting to a full 60 parameters , one still can not do a very good job extrapolating the timelike data into the spacelike region .",
    "after all , the naive behavior of the data plotted in @xmath1 seems to suggest that the lower edge of the @xmath166 peak extrapolates smoothly into the spacelike region to give much better figures for the normalization and slope of the form factor at @xmath4 .",
    "however , as we have pointed out above , the dispersive bound uses analyticity in @xmath48 , not @xmath1 .",
    "models based upon the expected theoretical shape of the @xmath166 peak or chiral perturbation theory implicitly assume that no peculiar behavior afflicts the form factor near @xmath2 .",
    "for the dispersive bounds to do the same , one would have to absorb the @xmath172 factor in ( [ jac ] ) into the parameterization in order to make @xmath260 finite at @xmath2 .",
    "at @xmath2 , indicating the threshold of absorptive processes entering through im@xmath62 .",
    "] however , since we have insisted upon @xmath48 as the natural variable of analyticity , for the remainder of this work we maintain that such a modification takes us too far from the original motivation of rigorous , minimal bounds based on quark - hadron duality and analyticity .",
    "certainly such modifications are straightforward to implement , but we forgo them for now for the sake of minimality of assumptions .",
    "the next issue is how one can believe the extrapolation from the timelike to the spacelike region if indeed the best fit is pathological in the neighborhood of @xmath2 .",
    "again , the answer is that it is @xmath48 and not @xmath1 that is the relevant variable of analyticity .",
    "an extrapolation along the real @xmath1 axis , expressed in @xmath48 coordinates , consists of following the contour of the unit circle in @xmath48 until reaching @xmath2 ( @xmath155 ) , and then moving along the real @xmath48 axis to @xmath4 ( @xmath168 ) .",
    "such a path takes us straight through the eye of the storm at @xmath2 , and should be avoided if possible .",
    "in fact , since the form factor is analytic on the entire unit disk in @xmath48 , one may choose a more direct and less contentious path ; for example , start at the point on the circle where data is plentiful , such as @xmath261 ( corresponding to @xmath262 ) , and proceed directly along a radius to @xmath4 .",
    "the fit for @xmath263 along this contour is presented in fig .",
    "this contour expressed in complex @xmath1 space resembles a cardioid with its outer edge at @xmath264 and its cusp at @xmath4 .",
    "since it does not pass near @xmath2 , it does not exhibit strong oscillations , as is apparent from the figure .",
    "clearly , analyticity in @xmath48 has no trouble with this region , and so the extrapolated results have meaning .",
    "6.0 truein    so our fit values are meaningful , and the numbers extracted for @xmath265 and @xmath266 are certainly consistent with those from the spacelike fit , but why are the uncertainties so large ? again , the interpretation becomes clear in @xmath48 space .",
    "the position of points @xmath267 in the unit disk is completely determined by the ratios @xmath268 and @xmath269 , as is clear from ( [ zblaschke ] ) . with our choice @xmath231 ,",
    "the timelike data becomes compressed almost entirely into the half - circle re  @xmath270 : see fig .",
    "as mentioned above , the @xmath166 peak data is clustered about @xmath271 , while the lowest measured points are at @xmath272 gev@xmath273 .",
    "this is a direct result of @xmath274 .",
    "if one takes @xmath275 , the extrapolation to @xmath46 should be much more precise .",
    "unfortunately , @xmath231 is exceptionally convenient for the extraction of @xmath265 and @xmath276 , as we have discussed above .",
    "we expect these problems would become much less severe if more near - threshold pion production data were measured . that this is true may be confirmed by performing the fit after including additional monte carlo data points in this region .",
    "the extrapolation uncertainties would also decrease substantially if we considered form factors where much more data naturally falls just above threshold ; this is precisely the situation for the @xmath119 form factor , where the @xmath84 peak occurs very close to the threshold @xmath277 , although in that case one faces the prospect of depleted data for @xmath278 .",
    "6.0 truein    the distribution of the parameters @xmath187 in magnitude is an interesting test of the convergence of the series @xmath182 .",
    "recall that we no longer have specific mathematical information on the rate of the convergence of this series . in our best fit with @xmath252",
    "we find only 3 parameters with @xmath279 , 12 with @xmath280 , 11 with @xmath281 , and 35 with @xmath282 .",
    "the largest single parameter is @xmath283 , and the largest 8 parameters all occur in @xmath284 . although the series is not monotonic , it appears to exhibit behavior consistent with fairly rapid convergence in @xmath109 .",
    "it is also possible to perform the fit to data fixing the normalization @xmath285 by choosing @xmath283 _ via _ eq .",
    "( [ slike ] ) . in a fit with @xmath286 using spacelike data",
    ", @xcite gives @xmath287 whereas our fit with timelike data gives @xmath288 again , our fit value is consistent with the other determination .",
    "as expected , the uncertainty in @xmath266 decreases once @xmath265 is fixed , since an additional constraint has been placed on the set of allowed analytic functions that satisfied the original fit . the value of @xmath255/d.o.f . for this fit is again 3.20 , and the level of saturation is now 0.52 .",
    "if enough data existed that the uncertainties on the parameters @xmath187 were much smaller , one could extrapolate throughout the entire spacelike region @xmath289 , which is @xmath290 .",
    "the prediction for @xmath263 for our best fit values turns out to fall smoothly and monotonically to zero as @xmath291 , and we expect this paradigm to persist in similar fits with more constraints .",
    "because of the large uncertainties in our extrapolations , we decline to exhibit just the central value fit ; however , we expect this paradigm to persist in similar fits with more restrictive constraints",
    ".    finally , the model - independent parameterization of ( [ bfit ] ) may be used directly in a fit to spacelike data .",
    "this application is entirely analogous to the semileptonic fits of @xcite , except that we pick @xmath231 and do not here seek to minimize the `` truncation error '' of between the fit and true form factor at points with @xmath292 : after all , we are interested in moments about @xmath293",
    ". a collection of 45 data points in the spacelike region taken from @xcite may be fit with just @xmath294 to give @xmath255/d.o.f .",
    "of only 0.97 and a saturation of the dispersion relation of only 0.018 ( as expected , fewer parameters lead to less saturation of the dispersive bound ) . from the parameter",
    "fit values we obtain @xmath295 or taking @xmath285 , @xmath296 with @xmath255/d.o.f .",
    "= 0.98 and a degree of saturation 0.022 . as a parting shot",
    "we point out that this model - independent determination of @xmath266 differs from that obtained by a naive linear extrapolation in @xmath1 ( [ naive ] ) by over @xmath297 .",
    "the difference lies in the fact that while the usual determination assumes @xmath62 linear in @xmath1 near @xmath4 , the model - independent form factor has a natural curvature associated with the factor @xmath298 , which in turn arose from analyticity constraints .",
    "the larger size of the uncertainty in our determination takes into account theoretical uncertainties in the shape of the form factor , which of course are absent when one assumes linearity in @xmath1 .",
    "we have explored some of the constraints that timelike data and dispersive constraints place on the shape of form factors , particularly in the spacelike region .",
    "much can be learned from little more than the analytic structure of the two - point function to which the form factor contributes and a few mild physical assumptions from finiteness .",
    "the sum rules and improved parameterization derived above arise directly from these minimal considerations .    nevertheless , the extrapolation of a finite amount of timelike data to the spacelike region is seen to lead to huge uncertainties in the case of the pion elastic form factor @xmath24 .",
    "this means that the bare assumptions of analyticity and the applicability of qcd in the deep euclidean region are not enough to obtain what seems to be a natural extrapolation of the @xmath166 peak to the spacelike region .",
    "we have discussed the dangers of extrapolating in the kinematic variable @xmath1 rather than the natural kinematic variable of analyticity , @xmath48 : namely , one must pass around a branch point @xmath299 or @xmath155 , near which the smooth behavior of the form factor may be compromised . in terms of @xmath48 , the assumption of a resonant pole in the timelike region places extremely tight constraints on the allowed parameter space of @xmath187 .    on the other hand , the @xmath48 contour from timelike to spacelike data",
    "may be distorted to avoid the troublesome point @xmath155 .",
    "the large uncertainties in our fit are seen to arise from the density and placement of the data set in @xmath48 ; basically , the problem is that most of the data , clustered near the @xmath166 peak , is far above the pair production threshold @xmath2 .",
    "since this is not the case for the @xmath119 form factor , the extrapolation may be much more reliable in that case .",
    "this is not to indicate that the technique is hopelessly weak or intrinsically flawed , however .",
    "rather , we have endeavored to exhibit what is obtained from the _ absolute minimum _ of assumptions .",
    "we have also suggested at various points possible improvements to the program presented above .",
    "it is useful to collect them here for the convenience of the reader .",
    "first , the calculation of the perturbative quantity @xmath300 may be improved by a careful analysis of multiloop effects and condensates .",
    "we have evaluated the perturbative result only at the single value @xmath224 gev@xmath220 .",
    "certainly the behavior of the dispersion relation as a function of @xmath204 , which is equivalent to a moment analysis , provides additional constraints .",
    "second , the stringency of the dispersive bound is determined by both @xmath300 and the level of saturation by all contributing states excepting those being probed by the parameterization . in the present case",
    ", this means any states like @xmath54 that receive contributions from the electromagnetic current but have not already been counted in @xmath53 production ( such as the @xmath166 ) .",
    "a calculation or estimation of this contribution effectively decreases the dispersive saturation limit allotted to the pion form factor . also falling into this category",
    "is the deep minkowski region @xmath301 of the pion form factor , for which data has not yet been collected .",
    "here , one may either use its integrated weight to increase the stringency of the dispersive bound , or retain its functional form to obtain another sum rule on the form factor parameterization .",
    "the latter suggestion leads us to the third possible improvement , that conditions on the shape of the form factor lead to constraints on the form of the parameterization .",
    "we have endeavored to make as few assumptions as possible along these lines , lest the model - independency of the parameterization is lost .",
    "nevertheless , modelers are free to start with the dispersive bounds as a starting point for building form factors that automatically satisfy nontrivial qcd constraints .",
    "another possibility along these lines not yet mentioned is the choice of the series used to parameterize the unknown physics of the form factor .",
    "we have always used a simple taylor series in @xmath302 to express the analyticity of the form factor since the set @xmath303 is a complete and orthonormal basis on the unit circle for analytic functions .",
    "although this basis proved immensely useful ( indeed , optimal ) for spacelike fits , perhaps a better basis exists for accommodating the relatively rapid variations in the form factor due to structure in resonant peaks , such as the @xmath254 shoulder .",
    "however , the constraints on this new parameterization are manifold : if it is to be adequate for both timelike and spacelike fits , it must admit a taylor series rapidly convergent in @xmath302 as @xmath304 , all of its taylor coefficients must be real ( so that the form factor is real in the spacelike region , where @xmath48 is real ) , but it can not converge _ too _ quickly in @xmath302 as @xmath96 , or else our polynomial fits in @xmath302 would already have been adequate .",
    "moreover , since the proposed functions are analytic in @xmath48 and not @xmath305 on the unit disk , natural choices such as @xmath306 and @xmath307 are forbidden .    clearly , many aspects of this program yet remain to be fully explored , but the variety of directions for improvements are quite astounding .",
