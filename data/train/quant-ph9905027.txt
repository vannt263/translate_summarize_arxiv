    "at the end of the long tunnel of experimental quantum computing there is the light of accuracy thresholds provided by quantum error correcting codes .",
    "the lengthy computations necessary for efficient factorization and simulation of quantum systems are all of a sudden possible if error rates for qubits are reduced below certain critical values in a sufficiently parallel quantum computer .",
    "the quantum codes which give rise to this intriguing phase transition work on the same basic principle as their classical precursors  they keep information secure by using more physical ( qu)bits per logical ( qu)bit of the code .",
    "what is desired of quantum codes is that , as this redundancy is increased , there should be exponential improvement in the storage / computation fidelity of the code .",
    "once the basic problem of correcting fully quantum errors was solved by the advent of quantum codes , a general recipe was obtained for expanding a given few - qubit code to achieve these exponential fidelity gains .",
    "this recipe generates a new higher level code by mimicking the old code , but with the role of physical qubits played by logical qubits of the old code .",
    "detailed methods of error correction and computation have been obtained for versions of this recipe with an arbitrary number of iterations or `` concatenations''even when faults might occur in error correction processes themselves @xcite@xcite .    however , different frameworks for fault - tolerant error correction , _",
    "e.g. _ topological quantum codes @xcite@xcite , might prove superior , and more general methods for universal computation are desirable .",
    "here , it is shown how to achieve universal fault - tolerant computation by construction of a toffoli ( c - c - not ) gate on encoded qubits , provided the code possesses a normalizer operator ( c - not ) which factors over the qubits in a block .",
    "most known quantum error correcting codes can be defined by a set of operators , the stabilizer , each of which fixes every codeword . for",
    "a number of stabilizer codes capable of simple operations , like a bit flip @xmath0 or phase flip @xmath1 on logical qubits @xmath2 , it is also known how to perform any `` normalizer '' operation_i.e .",
    "_ one that can be built from a sequence of operations involving only the c - not @xmath3 , @xmath4 phase shift , and hadamard rotation @xmath5 .",
    "normalizer operations alone , however , are insufficient for universal quantum computation ; a quantum computer with only normalizer operations can be simulated in polynomial time by a classical machine .",
    "a genuine quantum computer is realized either by the addition of a non - trivial one or two - qubit gate , like a single qubit rotation by an irrational multiple of @xmath6 , or of a three - qubit gate like the toffoli . here ,",
    "shor s procedure @xcite for performing a toffoli given the ancilla state @xmath7 will be rephrased and then a new method will be given for preparing this state , which does not rely on any concatenated structure within the code itself .",
    "it turns out one can perform a toffoli gate on three qubits @xmath9 given normalizer operations and three ancilla qubits @xmath10 prepared in the state @xmath8 .",
    "first consider the following construction , which uses one ancilla bit @xmath11 .",
    "letting @xmath11 start as @xmath12 , suppose one could perform a `` majority vote '' on @xmath13 so that , for example , @xmath14 and latexmath:[$|110\\rangle \\rightarrow     the effect on @xmath11 , leaving @xmath16 and @xmath17 unchanged , so @xmath18 and @xmath19 . now just c - not @xmath11 into @xmath20 and disentangle @xmath11 from @xmath9 .",
    "the result is exactly a toffoli on @xmath9 .    to majority vote on @xmath13 , one measures @xmath21 and",
    "if both measurement results are @xmath23 , @xmath13 are already unanimous .",
    "otherwise , the measurement results will reveal which bit is the odd - one- out .",
    "unfortunately , these measurements have also revealed information about the initial state @xmath24 , in general collapsing it , inconsistent with the desired toffoli gate , a linear operation .",
    "the solution is to perform a majority vote not directly on @xmath13 but on three ancilla qubits , which are first entangled with @xmath24 .",
    "here is where @xmath8 enters .",
    "given some arbitrary state of @xmath9 , prepare @xmath10 as @xmath8 and perform the following operations : ( i ) c - not @xmath16 into @xmath25 and @xmath17 into @xmath26 , and ( ii ) majority vote on @xmath10 ( by measuring @xmath27 and @xmath28 and flipping the odd - bit - out if necessary ) .",
    "suppose , for example , the measurement results from ( ii ) are @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "all but 8 terms will be collapsed away of the total @xmath31 terms in the initial 6-qubit state .",
    "these 8 terms , as they undergo ( i ) and ( ii ) , are ( suppressing bra - ket notation ) : @xmath32 where @xmath33 .",
    "note that all of the 8 possible bit values for @xmath9 are equally represented , so that all information in the initial superposition of @xmath9 is preserved ( albeit decoherently ) .",
    "now c - not @xmath11 into @xmath20 . from the above table",
    ", this will flip @xmath20 iff @xmath24 are @xmath34not iff @xmath24 are @xmath35 , as desired for the toffoli . applying @xmath36 then gives the desired result .",
    "finally , @xmath9 must be disentangled from the ancillas @xmath10 to restore the coherence of the original state .",
    "this is accomplished by applying @xmath37 and @xmath38 and then measuring @xmath0 .",
    "if the result is @xmath23 , @xmath9 are disentangled .",
    "if @xmath39 , a phase error on the @xmath40 term has been introduced ; it may be corrected by applying @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the controlled - phase ( c - phase ) gate .",
    "had the measurement results for @xmath43 and @xmath28 been other than @xmath39 and @xmath23 respectively , as in the above example , it is straightforward to determine what gates must be applied in place of @xmath36 and @xmath41 .",
    "the toffoli now just requires preparation of the three - qubit state @xmath8",
    ". first observe that if one can prepare @xmath44 @xmath8 may be obtained by preparing four qubits @xmath45 in the state @xmath46 , measuring @xmath28 , and performing a few simple normalizer operations .",
    "in particular , the measurement result @xmath39 gives the state @xmath47 which can be turned into @xmath48 by applying the c - nots : @xmath38 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 in that order .",

    "@xmath53 from the initial states . to start ,",

    "suppose the results are @xmath23 and @xmath23 .",
    "now perform @xmath38 and @xmath51 to disentangle @xmath64 . for pure states",
    ", this whole process would give @xmath65 and @xmath66 or @xmath67 are inconsistent with the assumed measurement results . in terms of mixed states , this means @xmath68 where @xmath69 is @xmath70\\ ] ] which is exactly @xmath71 .",
    "prepare another @xmath69 from two new @xmath72 states , and combine the two @xmath69 states by again measuring @xmath62 and @xmath63 . supposing the results are again @xmath23 and @xmath23 , @xmath64 are disentangled , leaving @xmath73 in the state @xmath74 .",
    "continuing this process through @xmath75 levels gives @xmath76 .",
    "the whole procedure may be pictured as a tree of @xmath77 states , joining in pairs from level @xmath78 to @xmath79 ( see fig .",
    "[ tree ] ) .",
    "the recursiveness is reminiscent of concatenated codes , but here the complexity appears in the auxiliary distillation process , not in the code itself .",
    "the fidelity in preparing @xmath53 is @xmath80 very close to 1 if @xmath58 .",
    "the number of ( logical ) qubits used to achieve this fidelity is @xmath81 , which by ( [ epsilon ] ) is @xmath82 .",
    "this is the same kind of polylog scaling desired from the code itself ( referring to the scaling of block size with desired failure rate @xmath83 ) . finding the number of operations on encoded qubits necessary to prepare @xmath53 is not as easy , since the assumption that all @xmath43 , @xmath84 measurement outcomes are @xmath23,@xmath23 requires repetition of the procedure a number of times before one expects such to occur .    to prepare a single @xmath77 state prepare two @xmath85 states and then combine them by measurements . if the measurement results are not @xmath23,@xmath23 , just discard these states and keep trying .",
    "( this is not an optimal procedure , but it will suffice . ) therefore , if the chances of any one attempt succeeding are @xmath86 , the expected number of logical operations @xmath87 necessary to prepare @xmath77 is @xmath88 .",
    "this assumes high confidence in the one pair of measurement results @xmath23,@xmath23 , which should be the case since @xmath45 are _ logical _ qubits . but",
    "even if there is a significant probability @xmath89 for any one measurement result to be in error , the distillation procedure can be made robust .",
    "once a @xmath23,@xmath23 result is obtained , just repeat the measurements a number of times and accept the state only if , say , a majority of the results are @xmath23,@xmath23 . to get @xmath90 confidence in the measurement outcome",
    ", one must repeat @xmath91 times .",
    "this implies @xmath92    it is not hard to see that @xmath86 must increase with @xmath93 , since this recursion relation implies that either @xmath53 will quickly begin to dominate successive @xmath77 states , in which case @xmath94 , or @xmath95 will dominate and @xmath96 .",
    "both of these values are larger than @xmath97 , which can be calculated as a function of @xmath98 but is always bounded from below by 1/4 . iterating ( [ gl ] ) with this bound gives @xmath99 note that @xmath100 is the total number of logical operations , but these can be done in parallel so that the actual distillation time is @xmath101 .",
    "the point is that even with the demand of a definite sequence of measurement results , time requirements still scale polylogarithmically with @xmath83 .",
    "the crucial fact leading to this scaling is that the probability for getting the measurement results @xmath23,@xmath23 in combining two @xmath77 states is finite as @xmath102 .",
    "thus one can prepare @xmath53 , @xmath8 , and execute a toffoli gate if one can prepare one of the mixed states @xmath54 with @xmath58 .",
    "there are multiple ways of obtaining a state @xmath103 for codes which are not too large .",
    "in fact , shor s own procedure for preparing @xmath8 can do so .",
    "an alternative method will be presented here , applicable to codes possessing a non - trivial normalizer operation ( here c - not ) that is transversal , so the encoded operation factors into a number of independent operations on physical qubits .",
    "the method works by performing a very noisy measurement of the c - not operator .",
    "were it possible to measure c - not with high fidelity , one could easily prepare @xmath104 .",
    "it turns out imperfect measurement of c - not is still capable of yielding @xmath103 .    for reference ,",
    "the eigenstates of the c - not operator @xmath37 are @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 with eigenvalue @xmath23 , and @xmath108 with eigenvalue @xmath39 .",
    "let us first describe a fault-__in__tolerant measurement procedure , that is , one which permits a single error to spread rampantly throughout a block .",
    "prepare one physical ancilla bit @xmath109 as @xmath12 and apply a certain three - bit gate @xmath110 bitwise over physical bits @xmath111 and @xmath112 in the blocks encoding @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( but always using the bit @xmath109 ) .",
    "@xmath113 is shown in fig.[ufig ] .",
    "the first hadamard rotation causes the toffoli to flip @xmath109 just if @xmath114 start in the @xmath39 eigenstate @xmath108 of @xmath115 , and the second hadamard undoes the effect on @xmath112 .",
    "apply @xmath113 bitwise over @xmath73 and measure @xmath116 .",
    "the result @xmath117 is equivalent to the result that @xmath118 , so one has effectively measured @xmath37 . to understand this process in detail ,",
    "expand the initial state of @xmath73 in eigenstates of the operators @xmath119 for @xmath120 : @xmath121 where @xmath122 and each @xmath123 is one of the four eigenstates ( @xmath124 ) of @xmath115 .",
    "the right hand sum is rearranged to segregate strings of even and odd weight .",
    "the weight function @xmath125 equals the number ( mod 2 ) of `` 4 ' 's occurring in the string @xmath126 , @xmath127 corresponding to the @xmath39 eigenstate @xmath108 of @xmath128 . using the transversality of c - not and the definition of @xmath125 , one finds @xmath129 is the projection onto the @xmath23 eigenspace of @xmath3 , and the sum with @xmath130 is the projection onto the @xmath39 eigenspace .",
    "it follows that the action of @xmath131 is latexmath:[\\[u |\\mathbf{x}\\rangle_{ab } |0\\rangle_{c_0 } =     measuring @xmath116 is equivalent to measuring @xmath37 .",
    "this method of measurement is highly sensitive to errors ; just one physical bit error can change @xmath125 for an entire string of bits , making the measurement result erroneous . as the block size @xmath133 gets large ,",
    "the chances of an even number of such errors occurring becomes nearly equal to the chances of an odd number occurring .",
    "thus the measurement result tells very little about whether a @xmath23 eigenstate or a @xmath39 eigenstate of @xmath37 has been obtained . this little bit of information , however , turns out to be important for preparing @xmath53 .",
    "as mentioned the above procedure is fault - intolerant , since one physical bit phase error may infect @xmath109 and thus spread rampantly throughout the block .",
    "it can be made fault - tolerant by using an ancilla @xmath11 , which is not just one bit , but a superposition of @xmath133 physical bits over all even weight strings ( `` weight '' is now in the sense of counting `` 1 ' 's ) .",
    "such a superposition is prepared as @xmath134 the gate @xmath135 will be applied bitwise across @xmath10 so that a single error in one block can at most spread to one bit in each of the other two blocks .",
    "acting bitwise on @xmath136 through @xmath137 , @xmath113 will flip a number of bits in the initial @xmath11 state equal ( mod 2 ) to exactly @xmath125 .",
    "thus @xmath138 measuring @xmath139 bitwise over @xmath11 with the result @xmath140 is now equivalent to measuring @xmath37 with the result @xmath141 . note that a single phase error in the @xmath133-bit cat state , or equivalently a bit flip in the sum over even weight strings , will change this sum into one over odd weight strings , again altering the measurement result while still projecting the state onto one of the eigenspaces of @xmath37 . so the measurement procedure is now fault - tolerant , but the measurement _ result _ is still highly sensitive to single bit errors , giving little information about which eigenspace the state @xmath142 collapses into .",
    "one can also perform a noisy measurement of the c - phase operator @xmath143 .",
    "the action of @xmath143 is just to apply a minus sign if @xmath73 are in @xmath95 , which is unitarily equivalent to @xmath37 through the basis change @xmath144 . to measure",
    "@xmath143 first apply @xmath144 , then measure @xmath37 by the above method , and reapply @xmath144 .",
    "these procedures may be adapted , by changing the bitwise operation @xmath113 , to noisy measurement of such operators as @xmath145 , @xmath146 , and @xmath147 .",
    "first prepare two logical qubits @xmath73 as @xmath148 and measure @xmath149 by the method given above , making use of an ancilla block @xmath11 .",
    "if the measurement result were + 1 and all qubits were error - free , one would have prepared exactly @xmath53 . but this will be changed by errors ( _ i.e. _ decoherence , gate errors , or measurement errors ) occurring either to the bits encoding @xmath25 and @xmath26 or to those of the cat - like ancilla @xmath11 used in the noisy measurement procedure .",
    "in fact @xmath11 is especially vulnerable because it is not protected by any code at all  a single bit error anywhere in @xmath11 can reverse the observed measurement result for @xmath149 .    depending on whether errors are unitary or decoherent ,",
    "this yields a cohererent or incoherent superposition of @xmath53 and @xmath95 , which will be shown to be of the form @xmath103 in either the unitary or decoherent case , hence a candidate for distillation .",
    "phase errors to the bits of @xmath73 can not be transmitted to @xmath11 by the above procedure , so are irrelevant .",
    "bit flip errors to @xmath73 can be transmitted but are equivalent to bit flip errors occurring to the bits of @xmath11 so all errors can be effectively regarded as occurring to @xmath11 alone .",
    "let us first consider the case of ( uncorrelated ) errors purely decoherent in the pauli basis @xmath150 , so that each qubit @xmath151 suffers no error , a phase error , a bit error , or both errors  each with some fixed classical probability .",
    "phase errors in @xmath11 can affect only the relative sign of terms in @xmath152 and @xmath153 of ( [ u ] ) , hence are extinguished once the @xmath139 measurements are made . depending on whether @xmath11 is attacked by an even or odd number of bit errors ,",
    "the measured eigenvalue of @xmath143 will be inferred either rightly or wrongly from the outcome of the @xmath139 measurements .",
    "so given the result @xmath154 , an even number of bits errors will yield @xmath53 as desired ; however , an odd number will yield @xmath95 unbeknownst to us .",
    "if each @xmath151 suffers a bit error with probability @xmath155 , the difference between the chances of an even number of bit errors and of an odd number is @xmath156 given that these two probabilities sum to 1 , this implies the preparation procedure will yield not exactly @xmath53 , but the state @xmath157 with @xmath158 where the last expression holds for large @xmath133 .",
    "it thus appears that one can not tell whether or not @xmath98 for a given ancilla block @xmath11 if even a few of its bits might have @xmath159 .",
    "this is true even though current codes themselves are completely robust to these `` defective '' bits so long as their distribution is suitably uncorrelated and infrequent at the level of the code s threshold error rate .",
    "still what has to be considered for the distillation process is not a single ancilla block @xmath11 , giving rise to one @xmath53-like state , but a sequence of such blocks , each with its own set of defective bits and consequent value of @xmath160 , where @xmath161 runs from @xmath162 to @xmath163 , the number of @xmath53-like states input to the distillation process .",
    "the fidelity in distilling @xmath53 is that given by ( [ epsilon ] ) with @xmath164 replaced by @xmath165 where @xmath166 is an average over the ensemble of @xmath11 blocks .",
    "assuming errors are uncorrelated between different @xmath11 blocks , the average factorizes and the distillation fidelity is @xmath167 here only the ensemble averaged bit flip error rates appear . assuming the locations of defective qubits are uncorrelated between different @xmath11 blocks , their @xmath168 contributions are simply weighted out in the average .",
    "this means infrequent defective bits no longer pose a problem , owing to the distributed nature of the distillation process .",
    "defining an average error rate @xmath169 , the above product is approximately @xmath170 . in order that the resulting fidelity be comparable to that of the code itself , which is @xmath171 for some power @xmath172 and constant @xmath173 ,",
    "the number of physical qubits used in distillation is roughly @xmath174 which puts a limit on the block size @xmath133 of the code being used , since the number of qubits used in distillation should not grow exponentially with block size .",
    "thus @xmath133 can not be larger than @xmath175    the opposite case of purely unitary errors is the same in its result . here",
    ", errors comprise a set of unitary operators which act on the @xmath176 respectively .",
    "each such operator can be written in the pauli basis and put in the form @xmath177 where @xmath178 are real .",
    "assuming low error rates , so @xmath179 and likewise with @xmath180 and @xmath181 in place of @xmath182 , one can show that these errors take @xmath11 from its prepared state @xmath183 to @xmath184 where @xmath185 .",
    "this leads to preparation of the state @xmath186 in place of @xmath53 . but",
    "this state is precisely @xmath54 with @xmath187 and @xmath188 , which can be distilled to @xmath53 if @xmath189 . for large @xmath133",
    ", @xmath190 will be very sensitive to the error amplitudes @xmath180 , and in practice one would have no way of knowing whether @xmath191 or not .",
    "this is the same problem noted above in the case of pure decoherence , and it too disappears when one realizes that the distillation input is not a single state @xmath192 but an ensemble of such states each generated by a different set of blocks @xmath10 .",
    "the distillation fidelity is now given by ( [ epsilon ] ) with @xmath164 replaced by @xmath193 where @xmath166 again averages over the ensemble of @xmath11 blocks . using this , the definition of @xmath190 , and expanding the logarithm gives @xmath194 as @xmath195 the factorization follows assuming independence of errors between different qubits in each @xmath11 block . now expand the exponential in a power series . if the error distributions are all such that the two bit flip amplitudes @xmath180 and @xmath196 are equally likely to occur , the expectation values of the odd terms in the power series vanish .",
    "( if the distributions are otherwise , one might use the computational basis @xmath197 instead of @xmath198 for the qubits in half the @xmath11 blocks , so that the same physical error would correspond to the bit flip amplitude @xmath196 as often as it would to @xmath180 . ) the even terms may then be resummed and the expectation value in ( [ ksum ] ) becomes @xmath199 where @xmath200 to lowest order in @xmath201 , hence @xmath202 can be taken roughly as a bit flip error rate . for small @xmath203",
    "the cosine functions will be close to 1 , and the product over @xmath204 will be greatest . as @xmath203 gets large , the cosines will sample their full range and the product will be highly suppressed .",
    "therefore the cosine above can be replaced by @xmath205 , as if @xmath203 were always small , giving the main contribution to the sum : @xmath206 where @xmath207 is again the average of @xmath208 over @xmath120 ; this is basically the same result as obtained for purely decoherent errors . thus again ( [ np ] ) gives the largest allowed block size in the regime where the resources needed for distillation scale polynomially with block size .",
    "in case higher fidelity is desired of the code than ( [ np ] ) allows , the above methods by themselves are insufficient and one must resort to concatenation . however , in conjunction with these methods , an unconventional , exponentially weaker form of concatenation can be used .",
    "a usual concatenated code is self- similar , the same abstract code ( _ e.g. _ the 7-qubit code ) being used at each level in its recursion .",
    "here one is free to increase the block size at each level , as long as ( [ np ] ) is satisfied level - by- level . in these `` progressive '' concatenated codes",
    ", many fewer levels are necessary given a desired fidelity @xmath90 .    in particular , for one error correction algorithm @xcite in the context of lattice codes , some reasonable parameters are @xmath209 , so that @xmath210 is acceptable by ( [ np ] ) . here",
    "@xmath211 where @xmath212 , which gives @xmath213 .",
    "so , if the desired fideltiy is below @xmath214 , _ no concatenation is necessary_. otherwise , one can begin concatenating .",
    "consider a single concatenation of a chosen code .",
    "physical qubits with error rate @xmath215 are arranged in code blocks of size @xmath216 , and these blocks are themselves arranged in blocks of size @xmath217 .",
    "the effective error rate at this higher level is just the failure rate of blocks at the lower level : @xmath218 where @xmath219 , @xmath173 , and @xmath172 come from details of the code being concatenated .",
    "the code as a whole has failure rate @xmath220 where @xmath221 includes the effect of storage errors described by @xmath222 and also gate errors associated with the operations necessary to perform error correction .",
    "thus @xmath221 will have the same form as @xmath222 in ( [ eps1 ] ) but with @xmath215 replaced by a physical qubit error rate @xmath223 including the effect of these additional errors .",
    "in other words one must deal not only with a storage error threshold but also with a gate error threshold associated with the computations necessary for error correction .",
    "of course , if one intends to use the logical qubits stored by the code for actual computations , this would be necessary anyway .    assuming the effective error rate @xmath223 is still below threshold , a single concatenation of the code in the above example gives @xmath224 where the values @xmath225 , @xmath226 , and @xmath227 have been used",
    ". the block sizes @xmath228 and @xmath229 were chosen to be consistent with @xmath230 , _",
    "i.e. _ the condition ( [ np ] ) applied at each level .",
    "thus , as long as one does not require a fidelity better than @xmath231 , a single concatenation is sufficient given the above parameters .    because the block sizes @xmath232 may increase so rapidly , the number @xmath75 of levels necessary for a desired fidelity @xmath90 scales differently than in usual concatenation , in which @xmath233 .",
    "for these progressive concatenated codes , @xmath75 is determined self - consistently by @xmath234",
    ". one might wonder about the asymptotic behavior of thresholds and fidelities as @xmath235 , taking into account the reciprocal effects between progressive concatenation and distillation ; however , this seems irrelevant given the smallness of @xmath83 already at @xmath236 .",
    "it has been shown how to construct a toffoli gate , the major part of a universal gate set , for any css code by virtue of its possession of a normalizer operator which factorizes over bits of a code block .",
    "for the particular code considered above very high fidelity , hence large block size , may require a single concatenation , the primary affect of which would be to unify the error rate thresholds for error correction and computation .",
    "the method presented derives from the ability to perform noisy measurement of the ( factorable ) c - not operator on logical qubits .",
    "this allows the preparation of a mixed state @xmath103 , which can then be used in a recursive scheme to distill a certain two - qubit entangled state @xmath53 of logical qubits , which in turn is easily transformed into a three - qubit state @xmath8 that enables the performance of one toffoli gate on three separate logical qubits .",
    "the point of this construction is to aid the cause of long quantum computations that do not rely on concatenated codes . in doing so",
