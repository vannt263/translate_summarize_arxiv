    "quark masses are fundamental free parameters of the standard model . because of the qcd phenomenon of color confinement ,",
    "quarks are bounded inside hadrons and their masses can not be directly measured .",
    "instead , for their determination one uses some physical observable depending on the masses in a theoretical approach and compares such theoretical prediction with the corresponding experimental value .",
    "such definition of the masses thus depends on the theoretical approach used . in the following",
    "we deal with the _ current quark masses _ , which are the masses appearing in the qcd lagrangian . at low - energy region , where the color confinement reigns , the non - perturbative methods of qcd",
    "are required .",
    "those relevant for the determination of the light quark masses ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) are sum rules ( sr ) , lattice ( lqcd ) and effective field theories ( eft ) .",
    "qcd sum rules are based on dispersion relations stemming from analytic properties of some observable ( such as differential decay rate of @xmath5 ) .",
    "they connect together the hadron world measured in experiments with perturbative qcd in terms of operator product expansion .",
    "for the recent review on the sr results on light quark masses we refer to @xcite . note that a computation of electromagnetic ( em ) corrections within sr methods would be very difficult since the inclusion of long - range interactions changes significantly analytic properties of the amplitudes , which makes it impossible to write dispersion relations in the regular form .",
    "numerical simulations on lattice have achieved in recent years a considerable progress  the current day simulations are performed with @xmath6 dynamical quarks , moreover , with @xmath4 near its physical value , while in order to reach the physical point in @xmath7 chiral extrapolation is predominantly still necessary . however , again the inclusion of em interactions on the lattice is very involved for their long - range character .",
    "nevertheless , even in this aspect , there is some progress as quenched qed simulations are already performed ( e.g.  @xcite ) . in recent years",
    "there appeared two attempts @xcite to review and average existing lattice calculations of various quantities , including @xmath8 , where more details can be found .",
    "both of these methods independently determined the values of @xmath4 and of isospin averaged @xmath9 with a reasonable precision with more - or - less compatible results .",
    "but since the isospin breaking effects on the observables studied by both these methods generated by em interactions are of the same order as those stemming from @xmath10 difference , for determination of the individual @xmath0 , @xmath1 they both need additional input , em interactions can not be neglected .",
    "however , since they are here less important , at the current level of precision of @xmath4 it is enough to take an estimate of them . ] .",
    "a method that can provide such input is chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) @xcite , playing a prominent role among those eft .",
    "note that for the determination of the quark masses chpt alone is insufficient .",
    "as in all physical results @xmath8 occurs multiplied by scalar quark condensate @xmath11 and thus rescalling both of them does not change the physics . moreover , starting at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in chiral counting , there exists a transformation of the masses @xcite , which together with the corresponding change in low - energy constants @xmath12 and some of nnlo constants @xmath13 leave pseudoscalar masses , scattering amplitudes and matrix elements containing vector or axial vector currents invariant .",
    "thus , using only experimental measurements we can not fix this so - called kaplan - manohar ( km ) ambiguity .",
    "consequently , chpt can determine only quark mass ratios and needs some external theoretical input in order to fix the physical definition of the masses .",
    "for a review of chpt nlo determinations of light quark masses , we refer to @xcite .",
    "in addition , in @xcite the employment of nnlo meson mass formulae is included .",
    "for a more precise determination of light quark masses it is therefore useful to combine isospin symmetric results of lqcd and sr with some isospin - breaking study performed in chpt .",
    "a very suitable process for such study is @xmath2 decay , which is possible only in the isospin breaking world .",
    "moreover , em contributions to this decay are very small and thus its amplitude is to a good approximation directly proportional to @xmath14 .",
    "( for a more detailed introduction to this process see @xcite . )",
    "we pull out the following normalization factor out of its amplitude @xmath15 by computation of so defined @xmath16 in chpt and comparing it to measured decay rate of this decay @xmath17 , one can determine the parameter @xmath18 . after pulling out this isospin breaking parameter",
    "we can perform isospin limit in the rest of the amplitude @xmath16 , which is a very good ( but once the experimental data on @xmath2 decays are available with a good precision , unnecessary ) approximation . in this approximation",
    "the amplitudes of the neutral decay @xmath19 and of the charged one @xmath20 are related together . in the following , we therefore work in such first order in the isospin breaking violation ( or in other words in the limit @xmath21 ) and deal mainly with the charged @xmath22 decay .",
    "quite recently , an inclusion of the two - loop corrections to this decay amplitude was performed in @xcite .    however , from the computed three successive orders it is obvious that chiral corrections in this process are large",
    " we illustrate this on listing the values of @xmath18 stemming from them and experimentally measured @xmath17 @xcite : @xmath23    moreover , although the nnlo computation @xcite leads to a reasonable result for the amplitude and for the value of @xmath18 , there are still discrepancies between the experimentally measured values of dalitz parameters describing their energy dependencies and the values predicted from @xcite . the charged amplitude is usually parameterized in the form ( normalized to one at the center of dalitz plot @xmath24 ) .",
    "@xmath25 with variables @xmath26    the parametrization of the neutral decay reads @xmath27 where in addition to the variable @xmath28 , there appears distance from the center of the dalitz plot @xmath29 .",
    ".comparison of the experimentally measured values of dalitz plot parameters with the values stemming from nnlo chpt [ cols=\"^ , > , < , > , < \" , ]     before we proceed to such analysis",
    "let us make a few comments .",
    "the error bars quoted in table  [ tabulka : cir ] are overestimated since they were obtained just as combinations of the errors of the individual parameters  this is the case especially for the chpt values , where the parameters were affected by the large @xmath13 uncertainties , whose effect on these combinations is reduced . hence , it would be desirable to remeasure these combinations ( and reevaluate them also in the chpt analysis ) in order to test this class of explanations . a case of a special importance",
    "is the neutral parameter @xmath30 , which is thus determined in chpt independently on the @xmath13s .",
    "once this correspondence is confirmed , from the values of the individual dalitz parameters [ or more suitably of those of parametrization ( [ nase ] ) ] corresponding to the experimental amplitude one could construct sum rules for the @xmath13s and examine their compatibility with the values coming from other observables .",
    "now let us return to our analysis .",
    "we assume that by an addition of a small real polynomial @xmath31 to the nnlo chpt amplitude one would reproduce the physical data . by fitting such @xmath31 from kloe",
    "we obtain such `` corrected amplitude '' .",
    "we have found @xcite that the corrections are indeed small ( on the physical region ) and correspond to the change of parameters in polynomial part ( [ polynom ] ) , which is shown in table  [ tabulka : prvni ] . even without changing its unitarity part",
    ", @xmath32 reproduces very well the kloe - like distribution and the corresponding value of @xmath18 is shifted to @xmath33}.\\ ] ] the quoted error is estimated conservatively taking into account the slow convergence of chiral expansion in the first three orders  assuming that the error of the corrected amplitude is equal to one half of the difference between this amplitude and the nlo one ( similarly as it was done with the nnlo amplitude in @xcite ) .",
    "a different analysis not imposing anything about the origin of the dalitz parameters discrepancy takes advantage of the fact that the construction of parametrization ( [ nase ] ) employs just general properties of the amplitude .",
    "we can thus assume that the physical amplitude ( for now the kloe - like distribution ) should be reproduced by this parametrization , which gives us a clear prescription for its fitting . in order to fix the normalization",
    "we suppose that chpt determination of the amplitude is reliable at least in the region specified below .",
    "the usually employed fact when searching for such matching region is the accidental coincidence at the chiral nlo level of the following points ( on the cut @xmath34 ) :    1 .",
    "the point , where the amplitude is of order @xmath35 ( adler zero ) , 2 .",
    "the point , where @xmath36 , 3 .",
    "the point , where the corrections of the computed order to the slope are small .    however , this coincidence proves not to be the case at nnlo .",
    "therefore , having the nnlo results at hand there is no reason why the amplitude at e.g.  the point fulfilling condition b ) should have a faster chiral convergence than at any other point ( in this particular case at nnlo it even seems to be the opposite ) .    .",
    "( more details in the main text . )",
    "the vertical lines indicate the physical region . ]    instead , taking parametrization ( [ nase ] ) and the first three chiral orders of the amplitude that are at disposal , we have found a more suitable prescription @xcite : we should fit on the @xmath37 cut and match only imaginary parts of the amplitudes under the physical thresholds ( i.e.  the dependence on the @xmath13s is reduced ) .",
    "moreover , one can further reduce the error of this procedure by fixing the normalization so that the resulting parametrization in this region interpolates between the order - by - order and the  resummed \" fits ( [ nase ] ) of the chiral amplitude ( they differ in the unitarity part , in the choice , whether one respects chiral orders of the parameters appearing there or whether one reorders them taking into account also some higher unitarity contributions ) .    in figure  [ fity ]",
    "we plot the result of this matching in comparison to the order - by - order and the `` resummed '' parametrization of the original nnlo chpt amplitude .    by comparing measured @xmath17 @xcite with integration of the resulting amplitude over phase space ,",
    "we obtain @xmath38}.\\ ] ] the possible sources of errors entering this analysis include : the uncertainties of the experimental data together with the ( in)accuracy of their description by our parametrization ; the errors induced by analytic continuation of the parametrization to the region where we match to chpt ; and finally the error of chiral expansion of the amplitude ( its @xmath39 order ) which is used for the matching in this region . taking into account properties of parametrization ( [ nase ] ) and the above described construction of the matching procedure , there is no surprise that the first type of errors prevails over other two even if we estimate them conservatively .",
    "further details on both analyses can be found in @xcite .",
    "since the dominant errors in both the performed analyses are of different origin ( and the values are compatible ) , we can combine them into @xmath40 however , as was stated above , both analyses rely on the assumption that the genuine physical amplitude is described by the distribution constructed from the values of dalitz parameters given by kloe ( and on the fact that one can use the nnlo chpt result at least as the input for the matching ) . without further measurements ,",
    "the error bar connected with this assumption is difficult to quantify .",
    "we estimate it from the second analysis and use in the following also more conservative value @xmath41        ( 0,-0.1 ) node[below ] @xmath42;(1,-0.1 ) node[below ] @xmath43;(2,-0.1 ) node[below ] @xmath44;(3,-0.1 ) node[below ] @xmath45;(4,-0.1 ) node[below ] @xmath46;(-0.05,0 ) node[left ] @xmath47;(-0.05,1 ) node[left ] @xmath48;(-0.05,2 ) node[left ] @xmath49;(-0.05,3 ) node[left ] @xmath50;(-0.05,4 ) node[left ] @xmath51;(3.5,-0.2 ) node[below ] @xmath52;(-0.15,3.5 ) node[left ] @xmath53;(3.73,2.775)(3.8,3.15 ) ; ( 3.82,3.15 ) node[above , black ] @xmath54 ; ( 3.95,2.765 ) node[white!90!black ] @xmath55 ; ( 4,2.897)(4.1,2.897 ) ( 4,2.493)(4.1,2.493 ) ; ( 4.1,2.493)(4.1,2.897 ) ; ( 4.1,2.695 ) node[right , white!30!black ] @xmath56 ; ( 3.62,2 ) node[left , white!60!black ] @xmath57 ; ( 3.63,2.25 ) node[right , white!50!black ] @xmath58 ; ( 3.06,0.35 ) node[right , white ] @xmath59 ; ( 3.38,0.62 ) node[right , white!10!black ] @xmath60 ; ( 1.5,3.7 ) node[left , white!90!black ] @xmath61 ; ( 1.72,3.8 ) node[left , white!90!black ] @xmath62 ; ( 0.071,4)(0.071,4.1 ) ( 0.87,4)(0.87,4.1 ) ( 1.668,4)(1.668,4.1 ) ; ( 0.071,4.1)(1.668,4.1 ) ; ( 0.87,4.1 ) node[above , white!60!black ] @xmath63 ; ( 1.245,0.585)(1,0.4 ) ; ( 0.9,0.32 ) node @xmath64 ; ( 3.79,1.265)(3.97,1.55 ) ; ( 3.98,1.65 ) node @xmath65 ; ( 3,3.7 ) node b ; ( 0.2,1.75 ) node kn ;      in figure  [ fig : ratios ] we review various constraints on the light quark masses coming from various recent analyses . in order to keep the plot uncluttered , we include only those which are independent and when different updates of some analysis exist , we list only the most recent one . for older results we refer to @xcite .",
