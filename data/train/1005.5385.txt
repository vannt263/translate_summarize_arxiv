    "today the observed universe almost entirely consists of matter , i.e.  is baryonically asymmetric .",

    "the rapid expansion of the universe ensures that this asymmetry is not washed out by the inverse decay and scattering processes @xcite .",
    "finally , anomalous electroweak processes convert the generated lepton asymmetry to the observed baryon asymmetry @xcite .",
    "the computation of the asymmetry in terms of the neutrino masses and mixing parameters requires a microscopic description of the out - of - equilibrium decay process .",

    "the size of various corrections to this approximation has been investigated by including e.g.  deviations from kinetic equilibrium , quantum statistical terms , thermal masses and matrix elements  @xcite .    beyond this",
    "it is important to check the validity of the semi - classical treatment embodied by the boltzmann approach .",
    "this is particularly relevant for leptogenesis where loop effects and unstable particles are essential for the generation of the asymmetry . within the standard boltzmann ( bottom - up )",
    "approach , these typically give rise to double counting problems as well as ambiguities related to the application of equilibrium quantum field theory for the analysis of out - of - equilibrium processes .",
    "these ambiguities can be resolved within the _ nonequilibrium _ closed - time - path or schwinger - keldysh formalism .",
    "in contrast to the bottom - up approach this may be viewed as a top - down approach . here , the underlying microscopic description is based on the full quantum - mechanical evolution equation for the expectation value of the lepton current .",
    "starting from the latter , quantum - corrected boltzmann - like kinetic equations can be derived , which are inherently free of the double - counting problem , and include medium corrections to the cp - violating parameters in a consistent way  @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a possible influence of off - shell and memory effects has also been studied in this approach  @xcite .",
    "the reduction of the full quantum equations of motion to boltzmann - like equation requires a so - called gradient expansion in powers of space - time gradients @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "physically , it amounts to an expansion in powers of the ratio of the microscopic time - scale @xmath1 and the macroscopic scales @xmath2 .",
    "this means , it requires that the decay rates @xmath3 and the cosmic expansion rate @xmath4 are much smaller than the corresponding right - handed neutrino masses @xmath5 .",
    "the standard boltzmann treatment of leptogenesis relies on the zeroth order in the gradient expansion , i.e.  neglects all gradient terms .",
    "although the condition @xmath6 is typically well fulfilled in thermal leptogenesis , higher gradient terms could still be important for the calculation of the _ asymmetry _ , since the latter depends on the tiny difference between particle and anti - particle interactions and densities . at zeroth order t",

    "cp_-violating source term is proportional to @xmath8 .",
    "the gradient terms capture another potential source for a deviation from thermal equilibrium , which is due to the time - dependence of the effective temperature @xmath9 of the thermal bath of leptons , quarks , gauge- and higgs bosons .",
    "consequently , we expect that the gradient _ cp_-violating source term is proportional to @xmath10 .",
    "in contrast to the standard source , it remains non - zero in the limit @xmath11 , and therefore could be important even though it is suppressed by the hubble scale , @xmath12 .",
    "furthermore , it is conceivable that leptogenesis or baryogenesis occurs in the early universe simultaneously with other non - equilibrium phenomena such as ( p)reheating or phase transitions in which case gradient contributions could be strongly enhanced .",
    "note that such gradient terms are crucial for electroweak baryogenesis , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "finally , on the formal level , it is well - known that including first - order gradient terms ensures the validity of exact conservation laws of the kinetic equations  @xcite .",

    "as we demonstrate in section  [ sec : delta ] , the additional source term has a qualitatively new structure and does not vanish even if all species are in _ local _ thermal equilibrium .",
    "furthermore , we demonstrate that it becomes important for very heavy majorana neutrinos and ultra - strong washout . * in section  [ sec : epsilon ]",
    "we argue that the gradient corrections also modify the well - known standard source term .",

    "in this section , we first review the standard boltzmann approach , and then the closed - time - path ( ctp ) approach for the generation of a @xmath14 asymmetry . in order to illustrate the effect of the gradient corrections , we consider a toy model which has also been used in  @xcite .",

    "in this section , we derive and discuss the additional cp - violating source term for the @xmath14 asymmetry , which is generated due to the time - dependence of the temperature of the thermal bath , @xmath116 .",
