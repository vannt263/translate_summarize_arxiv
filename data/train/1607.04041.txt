    "the lower limit of the mass of supermassive black holes ( smbh ) is around a million solar masses @xcite .",
    "their mass distribution can be explained @xcite by mergers @xcite in the gravitational focussing limit .",
    "since these mergers happened very early in the universe , they are too faint to observe in the electromagnetic wavelengths due to sensitivity limitation of the recent detectors . these mergers should provide another tell - tale observational sign , a gravitational wave background , expected to be detected by the elisa @xcite .",
    "promising developments in this respect are the recent results of the lisa pathfinder mission @xcite .",
    "gravitational waves from the mergers of stellar mass black holes were recently detected twice @xcite in the o1 run of advanced ligo @xcite .",
    "mergers of two smbhs typically lead to a spin - flip of the dominant relativistic jet @xcite .",
    "therefore a new channel must be plowed through the surrounding material @xcite , producing ubiquitous neutrinos with pev energies @xcite . at the end of this process ,",
    "as the jet penetrates the outer regions of the host galaxy , it will accelerate ultra - high energy cosmic ray ( uhecr ) particles , usually protons .",
    "their background has now also been detected by auger @xcite and kascade - grande @xcite at eev energies .",
    "the tev emission being interpreted as result of the proton synchrotron emission @xcite , some uhecr protons ought to be fairly deep inside the agn . explaining the tev variability of a few minutes with a structured jet ( inner cone lorentz factor @xmath0 of order @xmath1 , see @xcite ) implies a distance from the smbh of order @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the schwarzschild radius .",
    "this argument follows from @xcite s expression for variability , which is @xmath4 , using the tev emission model of proton synchrotron emission @xcite . here",
    "@xmath5 is the variability time - scale with distance @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the speed of the light , and @xmath0 is the lorentz factor .",
    "the uhecr particles at even higher energy approaching zev are mostly nuclei @xcite , and can be accelerated from the existing cosmic rays in a starburst region accompanying a galaxy merger @xcite .    optical spectroscopic and very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) observations on the inner part of some agn are consistent with a presence of a spatially unresolved pair of smbhs .",
    "such sources are e.g. mrk  501 , @xcite ; 3c  273 , @xcite ; bl  lac , @xcite ; 3c  120 , @xcite ; 3c  345 , @xcite ; s5  1803 + 784 , @xcite ; ngc  4151 , @xcite ; s5  1928 + 738 , @xcite ; pg  1302 - 102 , @xcite .",
    "the observation - compatible binary parameters most often draw a physical system being in the inspiral phase of the binary evolution , when the final coalescence will occur typically after thousands years .",
    "these systems exhibiting optical and radio periodicities are but in the very initial phases of the evolution described in the sequence above .",
    "there are however systems , which could exhibit several key elements of the model via observations in radio , high energy neutrinos and uhecr , as will be discussed in detail this letter .",
    "up to date there is no compelling understanding on the origin of extraterrestrial high - energy ( he ) neutrinos observed by the icecube antarctic neutrino detector @xcite . from the @xmath8 detections @xmath9 of them are track - type events with median angular error of @xmath10 : ids @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "the question of how to account for the observed neutrinos emerges , and by now the most conservative concept is , that they are related to a special subset of flat spectrum radio sources .",
    "we propose a model of an active radio galaxy merging its smbh with another smbh , reorienting its spin axis .",
    "after the merger the jet points to us , providing a key selection effect due to relativistic boosting .",
    "this relativistic boosting enhances all emissions , including the neutrinos .",
    "in such a picture one expects a combination of steep radio spectrum at low frequencies ( old jets ) , and a flat radio spectrum at high radio frequencies ( new jet ) , which is steeper and flatter than @xmath25 , with the convention @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "the observed neutrino spectrum is best explained by p - p collisions .",
    "the question arises , what type of protons in the interstellar matter could be hit by the energetic protons , and there are two options .",
    "the first option is that stars wander into the relativistic beam and get disrupted providing the target material @xcite , and also seed material for the acceleration process . according to another scenario @xcite , in any merger",
    "there is low angular momentum material from the other galaxy , which falls in deep and can get disrupted by the jet .",
    "the model proposes the following sequence :    1 .",
    "a merger of two galaxies with both containing smbhs , 2 .",
    "a reorientation of the dominant spin , followed by emission of low - frequency gravitational waves , culminating in the merger of the smbhs , 3 .",
    "the plowing of a new channel with a relativistic working surface shock , 4 .",
    "injection and acceleration of particles , 5 .",
    "interaction of particles .    the newborn jet ( iii ) hardens the electromagnetic spectrum at high radio frequencies .",
    "therefore selection of flat - spectrum sources is key to find traces of the model , as these reveal a relativistic jet pointing at us after the merger .",
    "the model predicts the sequence of the following events : emission of low - frequency gravitational waves , steep spectrum at low radio - frequencies ( old jet ) and flat spectrum on the high radio - frequencies ( new jet ) , high energy neutrino emission , high - frequency radio afterglow , tev @xmath27-photons and uhecr particles .",
    "while the observations in the radio and gamma spectrum and in high energy neutrinos are available , the ultimate test of the model will be provided by the corresponding gravitational wave measurement by elisa .",
    "a recently proposed shower - type candidate pks  b1424 - 418 @xcite provides the following detections .",
    "the he neutrino event @xmath28 was observed in 3 december 2012 .",
    "the radio flux density increased between november 2011 and march 2013 from @xmath29 jy to @xmath30 jy at @xmath31 ghz , reaching its peak in 28 january 2013 .",
    "the tev @xmath27-ray flare occurred between 2012 june and january 2014 , peaking in 17 april 2013 .",
    "there was a @xmath32 month delay between the neutrino emission and the @xmath27-ray peak .",
    "so in temporal order : neutrino emission , radio peak , @xmath27-ray peak , the neutrino emission being closer to the radio burst .",
    "the time sequence of these events is fully consistent with our simple model .    in this letter",
    "we present another promising candidate for a he neutrino event .",
    "moreover , in contrast to pks  b1424 - 418 @xcite , the source we discuss is candidate to a track - type event . for this type of he neutrino",
    "events the average median angular error is @xmath33 , being about ten times smaller than for the shower - type events .",
    "we searched for flat spectrum sources ( flat between @xmath34 and @xmath12  ghz ) in the @xmath35jy catalogue @xcite and in the parkes catalogue @xcite within the median angular error of the @xmath9 track - type neutrino events observed by the icecube neutrino detector @xcite . in the 1jy catalogue we did not find flat - spectrum radio sources in the required proximity of the track - type",
    "he neutrino events .",
    "however in the parkes catalogue we found four candidates : pks  0723 - 008 ( z=0.128 ; id5 ) , pks  b1206 - 202 ( z=0.404 ; id8 ) , pks  b2300 - 254 ( z unkown ; id18 ) , pks b2224 + 006 = 4c+00.81 ( z=2.25 ; id44 ) . here and thereafter we mark the corresponding he neutrino events in brackets .",
    "then we cross - correlated the 2nd planck catalogue of compact sources ( hereafter pccs2 , * ? ? ? * ) with the position of the track - type he neutrino events .",
    "we found the pccs2-counterpart of the blazar pks  0723 - 008 ( id5 ) and the quasar 4c+00.81 ( id44 ) .",
    "these sources are flat across the planck frequencies .",
    "the spectral index of pks  0723 - 008 is @xmath36 between 30 ghz and 217 ghz , and @xmath37 between 30 ghz and 857 ghz , with the convention @xmath26 .",
    "the spectral index of 4c+00.81 is @xmath38 between 30 ghz and 217 ghz , and @xmath39 between 30 ghz and 545 ghz ( we did not find the counterpart of the source at 857 ghz ) .",
    "the last known flux density of pks  0723 - 008 at 15 ghz measured by the monitoring of jets in active galactic nuclei with vlba experiments ( mojave ) team is 4807 mjy @xcite .",
    "this is almost thirteen times larger than the 15ghz flux density of the 4c+00.81 , which is @xmath40 mjy by the owens valley radio observatory @xcite .",
    "the other two flat - spectrum candidates for he neutrino events ( id8 and id18 ) do not correspond to any planck detection .",
    "a good candidate to explain a he neutrino event we found based on the coordinates and its brightness is the flat- spectrum blazar pks 0723 - 008 ( right - ascension @xmath41 , declination @xmath42 ) .",
    "this is near the position of he event id5 , observed at 12 november 2010 with energy @xmath43 tev .",
    "it is centered about @xmath44 , @xmath45 , with median angular error of only @xmath33 .",
    "we summarize the corresponding pccs2 detections in table [ table : planck_fluxes ] , and show the spectrum in the left panel of figure [ figure : planck_spectra ] .",
    "we also show a more detailed spectrum in the right panel of figure [ figure : planck_spectra ] , taken from the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) .",
    "we left out two high - energy points from the spectrum , in order to focus to the high - end of the radio frequencies , an einstein observatory measurement ( @xmath46 jyhz ) , and a fermi measurement ( @xmath47 jyhz ) .",
    "the blazar pks  0723 - 008 has flat spectrum toward the high planck frequencies , revealing the most internal component of the jet .",
    "this demonstrates that there is strong activity at the most compact scale , the core injects non - thermal particles into the surrounding material ( for radio emission : electrons ) .",
    "the planck spectrum is brighter than the wmap spectrum at the same frequencies . during the wmap measurements ( between @xmath48@xmath49 ) the flux density of the source maintained its integrated flux density about @xmath50 mj at @xmath51  ghz , while the vlba observations reveal that its flux density was increasing after @xmath49 ( see figure [ figure : vlba ] ) .",
    "the planck measurements with the low frequency instrument ( @xmath52 , @xmath21 , @xmath53 ghz ) went on between 12 august 2009 and 3 august 2013 ; with the high frequency instrument ( @xmath1 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58  ghz ) between 12 august 2009 and 11 january 2012 . obviously the wmap measured the flux density curve of the source when it was mostly constant , and the planck observed the source , when it was about four times brighter compared to the constant phase .",
    "the flat - spectrum blazar pks  0723 - 008 was monitored by the mojave team with the very large baseline array at @xmath51  ghz across @xmath59 yr in @xmath60 epochs @xcite .",
    "we cleaned the available calibrated @xmath61-visibilities to see if any activity is going on , as the radio spectrum suggests .",
    "we decomposed the surface brightness of the source into circular gaussian components , but no prominent component motion emerged , the source looking rather a core - halo object .",
    "standard difmap tasks @xcite were used to clean and model - fit the data .    on fig .",
    "[ figure : vlba ] we show the integrated flux of the source , along with the cleaned radio maps .",
    "its radio flux has been increasing since @xmath49 , indicating a continuously strengthening activity .",
    "the integrated flux exhibits a local maximum at the end of 2010 , indicating a violent component ejection , visible on the radio map for this epoch ( see fig .",
    "[ figure : vlba ] ) .",
    "fig.[figure : vlba ] shows that the radio emission already began to increase , before the icecube detected the id5 in 12 november 2010 .",
    "it suggests we catch the start of the plowing of a new channel already before the final coalescence , when the old jets are changing directions already .    concerning the tev @xmath27-rays , @xcite investigated the fermi lat data , and found that the random probability for fermi - lat detected agn to be spatially coincident with a single he track - like event is high ( 37% ) , and they found no evidence of @xmath27-ray emission associated with the detection of icecube s track - like neutrino candidates .",
    "they presented fermi - lat light curve of the 1 - 300 gev flux from pks  0723 - 008 binned in 50 day periods , that ends in the mid of april 2013 .",
    "they found no correlation between the neutrino emission and the @xmath27-ray light curve of the source .",
    "however , the model predicts a tev @xmath27-ray peak after that period , as the radio flux density of the source is still increasing at the end of 2012 .",
    "summarizing our findings , a newborn component was ejected from the core after 2006 ( see the radio maps ) , and then the spectrum brightened and flattened in the planck frequencies ( @xmath52  ghz@xmath58  ghz ) .",
    "these events suggest a violent process in the core of pks  0723 - 008 .",
    "hence pks  0723 - 008 is an excellent candidate for id5 .",
    "we will argue in the next section that the probability for an accidental identification is extremely small .",
    "in this letter we proposed a model explaining the track - type high energy neutrino events through the merger of two smbhs , which upon merging induce the reorientation of the new jet towards earth , providing a strong boosting of all emission .",
    "this model includes a spin - flip , a gravitational wave burst , strong radio emission to very high frequency , neutrino production , tev @xmath27-emission , and the ejection of ultra high energy cosmic ray particles .",
    "the model predicts that after the high - frequency radio peak tev emission ought to be detected , which in turn is expected to be highly variable .",
    "we cross - correlated several radio catalogues in order to find possible candidates to the @xmath9 track - type neutrino events detected by the icecube detector .",
    "we found four flat - spectrum radio sources close enough to a track type neutrino event , two of them being detected at high frequencies by planck .",
    "we discussed the case of the flat spectrum blazar pks  0723 - 008 as an excellent candidate for id5 .",
    "we found traces of a spin - flip , high - energy neutrino emission , and five - fold increased radio flux density in the last decade .",
    "the critical question is obviously , what is the chance coincidence of finding a flat spectrum radio source within the error - box of the track events on the sky , which source appears at high frequencies as well .",
    "@xcite found @xmath62 flat spectrum sources ( @xmath63 ) in an area of @xmath64 steradians of the sky using the parkes catalogue , above galactic latitude @xmath65 . assuming homogeneous distribution it translates @xmath66 flat spectrum radio sources over the full sky ( @xmath67 deg@xmath68 ) .",
    "taking @xmath69 as the average median angular error of the track - type neutrino events , and then the area of @xmath70 deg@xmath68 , the statistics yields @xmath71 flat spectrum source over neutrino event area .",
    "about 1/10 fraction of the flat spectrum sources extends to high planck frequencies @xcite , which means @xmath72 flat spectrum source over neutrino event area .",
    "this result points out that there is a pretty small probability for two flat spectrum sources to emerge as candidate for track - type events just by chance , as the combined probability of such coincidence is @xmath73",
    ". therefore it might be plausible that all other track events may pertain to sources at yet higher red - shift , and so at lower flux density in the radio spectrum .",
