    "the flavour puzzle is one of the biggest open questions in particle physics .",
    "currently , one may subdivide it into three main parts : the puzzle associated with the masses and mixing properties of the quarks and charged leptons , the new puzzles that have been added with the discovery of neutrino masses and mixing , as well as the issues connected to cp violation .",
    "regarding the masses of quarks and charged leptons it is tantalizing that down - type quarks and charged leptons show a similar hierarchical pattern , which differs substantially from the pattern of the up - type quark masses . in the lepton sector",
    ", in addition to the smallness of the neutrino masses the observation of large flavour mixing , in contrast to the small quark mixing , has to be explained . concerning cp violation , there is on the one hand the strong cp problem , but on the other hand the observation that the unitarity triangle is , at least , almost right - angled , i.e.  @xmath5 .",
    "if supersymmetry ( susy ) or any other kind of new physics will be discovered at the lhc , this would add another `` dimension '' to the flavour puzzle .",
    "any kind of new physics has to face severe constraints from flavour physics , e.g.  flavour changing neutral currents in the quark sector ( fcncs ) , lepton flavour violation ( lfv ) as well as electric dipole moments ( edms ) . in the case of susy",
    "this is often referred to as the `` susy flavour puzzle '' .",
    "recently a lot of effort has been made to understand the flavour structure of quarks and leptons using non - abelian family symmetries such as @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and so forth ( see , e.g.   @xcite ) , where the three families of sm fermions can be unified in representations of the family symmetry . for reviews with extensive lists of references ,",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "one strength of such non - abelian family symmetries is that they can provide an explanation of the observed close to tri - bimaximal mixing in the lepton sector .",
    "most of these models are also formulated in a susy context , although this is often not worked out in any detail . in many works only",
    "the superpotential relevant for the vacuum alignment of the family symmetry breaking higgs fields , the `` flavons '' , and the fermion masses and mixing angles is presented , without considering the consequences for the susy breaking sector .",
    "it is one main aim of this paper to highlight the entanglement between the sm and the susy sector when a careful model analysis is performed .",
    "family symmetries ( in particular non - abelian families discussed towards explaining tri - bimaximal lepton mixing ) can indeed constrain the structure of the sfermion mass matrices such that compatibility with fcnc constraints or lfv is improved , see , e.g. @xcite .",
    "several aspects regarding the connection between family symmetries and the susy flavour structure have been discussed in the literature : for example the role of induced flavon f - terms has been analysed in @xcite .",
    "canonical normalisation effects in family symmetry models in supergravity , and the dependence of their relevance on the messenger sector of the models , have been studied in @xcite . in another recent study , the impact of the messenger sector on the predictivity of family symmetries for the soft susy breaking parameters has been highlighted @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in combination with family symmetries , supersymmetric grand unified theories ( guts ) are an attractive framework for trying to solve the flavour and susy flavour puzzles , since they provide a link between the different ( s)fermion species , i.e.  between quarks and leptons respectively squarks and sleptons .",
    "many studies in the literature focus either on explaining the flavour structure of the fermion masses and mixing parameters _ or _ on the susy flavour puzzle , but not on both at the same time . however , if susy will be discovered , it is clear that successful models of flavour will have to provide an explanation for both , the flavour structure of the standard model fermions _ and _ the flavour structure of their scalar superpartners . in this paper , we discuss aspects of such `` susy flavour '' models , which aim at predicting both flavour structures simultaneously , in the context of supergravity ( sugra ) .",
    "we point out the importance of carefully taking into account susy - specific effects , such as 1-loop susy threshold corrections and canonical normalization effects , when fitting the model to the data for fermion masses and mixings .",
    "these effects entangle the flavour model with the susy parameters and lead to interesting predictions for the sparticle spectrum as well as , for instance , for the neutrino parameters .",
    "in addition , family symmetries introduced to explain the flavour structure of the standard model fermions can also make predictions testable in future flavour experiments .",
    "we demonstrate these effects by analyzing an example class of flavour models in the framework of @xmath0 grand unified theories with a family symmetry with real triplet representations .",
    "thereby we benefit from the gut yukawa relations @xmath10 and @xmath11 two of us proposed in @xcite . from there we derive , in a semi - analytical as well as in a numerical analysis , the constraints on the susy parameters and the predictions for fcncs , lfv and edms . in the class of susy flavour models considered as example ,",
    "flavour violation through the susy soft breaking terms is dominated by the trilinear terms .",
    "we discuss the possible signatures of such a scheme of `` trilinear dominance . ''",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we first define the class of models we will consider as an example . at this point the model is not yet supersymmetric , i.e.   we specify only the fields necessary to describe the sm fermion masses and mixing angles . in sec .",
    "[ sec : susy ] we discuss the relevant susy specific effects , like canonical normalization and susy threshold corrections .",
    "there , we also discuss the structure of the soft susy breaking terms , first in the flavour basis and then also in the sckm basis .",
    "the fourth section is devoted to a semi - analytical analysis , where we describe an approximate procedure to extract the low energy flavour observables from the high scale model .",
    "we also show how , from a fit of the low energy fermion masses and mixing angles to the data , constraints on the susy spectrum arise . in sec .",
    "[ sec : num ] , we discuss the results of a mcmc analysis , which supports our semi - analytical results .",
    "we also present there phenomenological consequences for the susy spectrum and low - energy observables .",
    "the last section contains a summary and our conclusions .",
    "before going to the susy specific ingredients we will first describe in general terms the class of flavour models we are going to consider as an example for all the susy specific effects .",
    "we emphasize that our analysis is not restricted to this special class of models . in contrary it",
    "should be applied to any given susy model of flavour to check its validity . as we will see it is necessary to include susy effects to check if a correct description of sm fermion masses and mixing angles can be obtained .      our starting point for describing the class of flavour models , to be discussed as an example in the next sections , is a grand unified theory ( gut ) with gauge group @xmath0 plus a non - abelian family symmetry group @xmath12 with real triplet representations such as , for example , @xmath6 or @xmath8 . for the matter fields of the sm fields @xmath0-unification",
    "implies that they are unified in the @xmath13 representations @xmath14 and in the @xmath15 representations @xmath16 , where @xmath17 labels the three families , as follows : @xmath18 and @xmath19 we will assume that the three fields @xmath14 are components of a triplet @xmath20 under the family symmetry @xmath12 . the other three fields @xmath16 remain singlets under @xmath12 .",
    "as we will see , this allows the top mass to emerge at renormalizable level , while the masses of the other lighter fermions will be generated from effective operators after family symmetry breaking .",
    "in addition to the sm fermions , we add two right - handed neutrinos @xmath21 to the spectrum , which are singlets under the family symmetry , in order to allow for two massive light neutrinos via the seesaw mechanism as observed in neutrino oscillations .",
    "note that this is a minimal setup and implies that one of the light neutrinos is massless by construction .",
    "it is straightforward to extend the model to include a third right - handed neutrino , to give mass to all three light neutrinos .",
    "as mentioned above , apart from the top quark mass all masses and thus also the mixing parameters of the fermions arise after the family symmetry ( and the ew symmetry ) gets broken .",
    "following @xcite we will assume that the family symmetry is broken by flavour - higgs fields ( the flavons ) @xmath22 in triplet representations of @xmath12 , acquiring vevs in the following directions in flavour space into two flavons ( cf .",
    "appendix b of @xcite ) , one with a purely real and another one with a purely imaginary vev . a mechanism for realising such vacuum alignments",
    "is presented in @xcite . ] : @xmath23 the least understood and most difficult - to - test part of current flavour models with non - abelian family symmetries is their so - called `` vacuum alignment '' sector .",
    "this is the part of the theory which addresses the question why the flavons point in these specific directions in flavour space . in this paper",
    "we will not enter this part of the flavour models in much detail .",
    "however , we will come back later to one ( at least in principle ) testable feature of the vacuum alignment sector in supersymmetric models , namely the size of the induced f - terms for the flavons .",
    "finally , we remark that the scale of family symmetry breaking can in principle vary over a wide range . in the following",
    ", we will assume for definiteness that the family symmetry is broken close to the gut scale .",
    "we will now describe the effective lagrangian of the model class . for its origin from a renormalizable theory",
    "we refer the interested reader to sec .",
    "[ messengers ] where we discuss the messenger field sector and sketch the additional discrete symmetries of the setup . in sec .  [ yukawa ]",
    "we will describe the resulting yukawa matrices and the mass matrix of the right - handed neutrinos .",
    "a reader mainly interested in the phenomenological analysis may skip sec .",
    "[ messengers ] .",
    "the effective lagrangian of the class of models considered here has the following structure : @xmath24 @xmath25 stands for a higgs field in the @xmath26 representation that breaks @xmath0 to the sm , and @xmath27 and @xmath28 stand for higgs fields that contain the mssm higgses @xmath29 and @xmath30 in their sm - doublet components .",
    "the higgs fields are singlets under the family symmetry .",
    "to shorten notation , @xmath31 coefficients have been absorbed ( without loss of generality ) in the mass scales in the denominators , which correspond to the masses of heavy `` messenger fields '' as will be discussed below .",
    "as one can see , only ratios of flavon vevs over the messenger masses enter the lagrangian , reflecting the fact that the family symmetry breaking scale is a priori undetermined .",
    "some properties of the effective lagrangian are determined by the family symmetry @xmath12 .",
    "for example , since @xmath20 is a triplet under @xmath12 it has to appear together with a flavon in the terms in @xmath32 which lead to the down - type and charged lepton yukawa matrices .",
    "this implies that the rows of @xmath33 and the columns of @xmath34 will be generated dynamically by the flavon vevs .",
    "other properties of the effective lagrangian , for example that the top quark yukawa coupling appears at the renormalizable level while all other up - type yukawa couplings do not , requires additional symmetries and the knowledge of the `` messenger sector '' , i.e.  of the fields which are interchanged to generate the effective interactions . in summary ,",
    "the class of models we like to outline here has the following features :    * the rows of @xmath33 and the columns of @xmath34 will be generated dynamically by the flavon vevs with the rule that @xmath35 couples only to @xmath36 , @xmath37 couples only to @xmath38 and @xmath39 , and @xmath40 couples only to @xmath41 .",
    "* the yukawa coupling ratios @xmath42 and @xmath43 at the gut scale will be predicted as @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively , by clebsch ",
    "gordan coefficients from gut symmetry breaking .",
    "as shown in @xcite this requires a moderate or large value of @xmath46 .",
    "* at leading order @xmath47 will be diagonal .",
    "* left - handed neutrino masses will be generated via a see - saw type i mechanism with two right - handed neutrinos .",
    "* the mixing in the neutrino sector is of almost tri - bimaximal form .",
    "* we consider spontaneous cp violation from the flavon vevs ( see , e.g.",
    "@xcite ) , in our specific case from @xmath48 only .",
    "the first point listed above is realized , for example , when the @xmath16 as well as the associated flavons carry some charge under a specific additional discrete symmetry , for instance a @xmath49 symmetry . in addition , we have to make sure that the ratios among yukawa couplings mentioned above are reproduced by correct contractions of the @xmath0 indices of the higgs and matter representations .",
    "this can be achieved if the effective operators are generated by integrating out the appropriate messenger fields @xcite .",
    "the relevant operators for the down - quark and charged lepton sector are , for example : @xmath50 leading to @xmath11 and @xmath51 leading to @xmath10 at the gut scale . here",
    "the subscript refers to the used @xmath0 index contraction and @xmath52 represents generically the mass scale of the messenger fields , which will be specified below . @xmath25 and @xmath53 are higgs fields in the @xmath26 and in the @xmath13 representations of @xmath0 respectively .",
    "@xmath25 can be the usual higgs responsible for the breaking of @xmath0 to the sm gauge group by acquiring a vev @xmath54 .",
    "clearly , the messenger fields , which generate these operators , can be distinguished by their charges under the additional discrete symmetries which distinguish between @xmath37 and @xmath40 .",
    "the diagrams generating the yukawa couplings for down - type quarks and charged leptons are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : messenger_d ] , where the masses of the messenger fields are also shown .    ]",
    "if we would introduce at least one discrete symmetry for each generation and the messenger fields generically carry charge under exactly one of these symmetries , it follows that the up - quark yukawa matrix is generated with a diagonal structure .",
    "specifically , we will arrange that only the top quark mass is generated at the renormalizable level , by associating @xmath40 to a @xmath55 symmetry , for instance , while the charm quark and up quark masses are generated only after family symmetry breaking , by associating @xmath37 and @xmath35 to larger symmetries as , e.g.  @xmath49 symmetries with @xmath56 .",
    "the relevant operator for the up - quark mass can then be @xmath57 generated via diagrams as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : messenger_u ] .",
    "similar considerations can be made for the neutrino sector , where now the rh neutrinos @xmath58 carry the same charges as the @xmath16 to associate them with the flavons .",
    "majorana masses for the rh neutrinos and neutrino yukawa couplings are then generated for instance by the diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : messenger_n ] .    ]    ]    in summary , we will consider models with auxiliary discrete symmetries to separate each of the @xmath16 , leading to the following pairings between matter and flavon fields : @xmath59 we note that @xmath20 is not paired to a particular flavon since it is a triplet under the family symmetry and contains all three generations of the five - dimensional matter representations .",
    "basically the following considerations are based on these pairings ( and the sketched messenger sector ) and do not explicitly depend on the discrete symmetries used to achieve them . in general these do not have to be chosen only to fulfill these pairings , but also to shape the flavon potential such that it gives the desired vacuum alignment ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . since this task will require different quantum numbers for the flavons @xmath38 and @xmath39 , it might be desirable to introduce another higgs representation @xmath25 or @xmath53 . due to this difference",
    "we also assume that @xmath60 is not paired with @xmath61 . however , these model building issues are beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the yukawa matrices after gut and family symmetry breaking are defined in the following way : @xmath62 this convention matches the one used by the particle data group @xcite . in our class of models",
    "the yukawa matrices and @xmath63 have the following form at the gut scale : @xmath64 we remark that in the definition for the yukawa matrices we have introduced a complex conjugation to match the pdg convention .",
    "this is the reason why @xmath65 instead of @xmath66 appears in the 2 - 2 elements of the down - type quark and charged lepton yukawa matrices .",
    "the matrices @xmath33 and @xmath67 are expressed in terms of the `` expansion parameters '' @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , which are defined via the relations : @xmath72 the structures of @xmath33 and @xmath67 , and its close relation , will lead to testable predictions of our class of models and the parameters @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 will be determined by a fit to the data for down - type quark and charged lepton masses and to the quark mixing parameters .",
    "the factors @xmath73 and @xmath74 are clebsch ",
    "gordan coefficients arising from gut symmetry breaking and have been proposed recently in @xcite as new possible gut relations in gravity mediated susy breaking scenarios .",
    "clearly , the obviously incorrect @xmath0 relation @xmath75 would be obtained if all clebsch  gordan coefficients were one .",
    "to provide an idea of the size of the expansion parameters , let us say that in susy models with @xmath76 we will obtain small @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 of @xmath77 or less and @xmath71 of @xmath78 .",
    "the parameters in the diagonal matrix @xmath47 simply have a one - to - one correspondence to the up - type quark masses and the ratios of the squared elements of @xmath79 over the right - handed neutrino masses in @xmath63 stands , via the seesaw mechanism , in direct relation to the observed light neutrino mass splittings . by the structure of the vevs of @xmath36 and",
    "@xmath38 the leptonic mixing matrix is of tri - bimaximal form to leading order and receives calculable corrections by the ( small ) mixings of @xmath34 , resulting in predictions for the neutrino mixing parameters as we will discuss later in the paper .    defining the ratios of flavon ( and @xmath25 ) vevs over messenger masses as @xmath80 with @xmath81 being the vev of @xmath25 ,",
    "the entries of @xmath47 , @xmath79 and @xmath63 are defined as @xmath82    now we have basically defined the building blocks of our class of flavour models .",
    "we would like to remark that within this class of models it is possible to define a specific version of a model by specifying the full set of ( discrete ) symmetries , the higgs content at the gut level , the vacuum alignment mechanism as well as the messenger sector of the theory .",
    "note that , a priori , any family symmetry with real triplets can be used .",
    "many predictions of the model class , however , are quite generic and will not depend on the realization in a specific model version .",
    "in principle a model belonging to the class discussed in the previous section may also be realised in a non - supersymmetric setup . however , if susy will be discovered , it will be necessary to extend any given model of flavour to a supersymmetric one and to perform a careful analysis of its predictions in the susy sector .",
    "the first task , to be discussed in this section , is to specify the superpotential @xmath83 and the khler potential @xmath84 of the susy version of the model , which is consistent with the symmetries of the model and can be generated by its messenger field content . from @xmath83 and @xmath84",
    "we can calculate the canonically normalized yukawa couplings as well as the soft susy breaking sfermion mass matrices and the trilinear sfermion coupling matrices .",
    "in the following , we will focus on the scenario that susy is broken in a hidden sector and then mediated to the visible sector by gravity .",
    "we will also assume complete _ sequestering _ of @xmath84 and @xmath83 , meaning that we can split the superpotential and khler potential into two parts @xmath85 respectively , where the visible superpotential is just @xmath86 and @xmath87 , where the dots refer to terms for the other visible sector superfields , and where @xmath88 contains additional superpotential terms including , for instance , the flavon and gut higgs potentials .",
    "furthermore , we will assume a gauge kinetic function such that unification of gaugino masses is realised at the gut scale .",
    "the superpotential can be obtained by simply promoting the fields in the effective lagrangian to chiral superfields . for our example class of models",
    "this gives @xmath89 promoting also the messenger fields to superfields , the effective operators in the superpotential can be generated by integrating out the heavy messenger superfields . integrating out these messengers also induces effective operators in the khler potential , as we discuss now .      .",
    "[ fig : messengers_kf ] ]    integrating out the messenger superfields generates not only the above superpotential operators but also effective operators in the khler potential .",
    "an example , within our class of models , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : messengers_kf ] .",
    "the messenger superfield is the same that is interchanged in the left side of the left diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : messenger_d ] .",
    "after family symmetry breaking , the kinetic terms are generically generated with an a priori non - canonical structure and have to be canonically normalized .",
    "this , in turn , has an effect on the fermion flavour structure , namely on the yukawa couplings , as we will discuss in sec .  [",
    "sec : normalisedyukawas ] .",
    "from the diagrams that generate the superpotential terms , using the argument from above , one can easily infer the non - canonical khler potential operators which are generated by the messenger fields . in our example class of models ,",
    "the khler potential of the visible sector fields @xmath16 and @xmath20 , including these operators , is given by @xmath90 note that @xmath91 does not contain non - renormalizable operators with flavons , while such operators are present in @xmath92 and lead to non - diagonal terms after family symmetry breaking .",
    "in contrast , @xmath93 does not contain non - renormalizable operators , which we , however , neglect . ] with @xmath25 .",
    "gauge and family indices have been suppressed and are assumed to be contracted between the matter field and the flavon / gut - higgs field , see fig .",
    "[ fig : messengers_kf ] . the couplings",
    "@xmath94 and @xmath95 depend on the fundamental couplings of the messengers , but are essentially additional free @xmath31 parameters as they do not appear somewhere else .    from the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : messenger_d ] and [ fig : messenger_u ] one can see that there is also a flavon - dependent contribution to the khler potential of the higgs field @xmath27 : @xmath96    we have not given here the khler potential for the right - handed neutrino fields since its effects are negligible for phenomenology or can be absorbed into other unknown quantities .",
    "we have also dropped terms induced by the couplings of the @xmath20 and @xmath97 fields to @xmath28 and @xmath27 , since the resulting non - universal terms are suppressed by powers of the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) vevs over the heavy messenger scale .      as typical in susy",
    "/ sugra flavour models , the kinetic terms in our example class of models are generically non - canonical and have to be canonically normalized , which has an impact on the fermion flavour structure .",
    "we will now discuss the leading order effects of this procedure .",

    "likewise , we define the transformation matrices @xmath102 and @xmath103 which canonically normalize @xmath104 and @xmath105 .    as a consequence of the field redefinitions ,",
    "the yukawa matrices @xmath106 are transformed as follows : @xmath107 the rescaling factor needed for canonically normalizing @xmath105 is readily absorbed into the definition of the @xmath108 s .",

    "several remarks are in order here :    * the parameters which are directly related to the fermion masses and mixings are the @xmath108 s . on the other hand , in our example class of models the @xmath108 s depend on the product of two ratios of flavon vevs over messenger masses , for example @xmath112 , and similarly for the other @xmath108 s as defined in the previous section . in the following",
    ", we will assume the case that @xmath113 and @xmath114 are comparatively large ( @xmath115 ) .",
    "this in turn implies that , as we will confirm later by the fit to the data , that @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 are very small such that we can neglect the corresponding canonical normalization effects in a leading order analysis . the only @xmath108 parameter which will not turn out to be very small is @xmath119 , and",
    "therefore we will introduce both parameters @xmath120 and @xmath121 explicitly .",
    "* since @xmath104 also involves couplings to the gut breaking vev of @xmath25 but @xmath92 does not , we get the relations @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",

    "however , since @xmath118 is very small , as stated above , this can be neglected .    under the assumptions specified above the main effect of canonical normalization",
    "stems from the change in @xmath33 and @xmath34 due to rescaling of the third component of the field @xmath20 , which is parameterised by @xmath126 . with the definition @xmath127 , and after absorbing all other rescalings in the @xmath108 s , the yukawa matrices have the following form at the gut scale to leading order in @xmath128 : @xmath129      let us now turn to the soft susy breaking terms which can be calculated from a given @xmath84 and @xmath83 .",
    "please keep in mind that we restrict ourselves to the case of hidden sector susy breaking transmitted to the visible sector by gravity and that we consider for definiteness complete _ sequestering _ of @xmath84 and @xmath83 into hidden sector and visible sector parts .",
    "the hidden sector is assumed to contain chiral superfields which break susy by obtaining both a vev and a non - vanishing f - term of order @xmath130 and @xmath131 , respectively .    in supergravity before canonical normalization , the soft masses can be expressed in terms of the full visible sector khler metric @xmath132 @xcite : @xmath133 where @xmath134(@xmath135 ) runs over all ( conjugated ) superfields while @xmath136(@xmath137 ) only runs over matter superfields . clearly , given the sequestering assumption , only _ visible sector _ superfields whose f - term is not vanishing contribute to the second and third term of eq .  .",
    "in our class of models this is the case for the flavons and the gut higgs field , which acquire an f - term proportional to their vev @xcite : @xmath138 where the coefficients @xmath139 , @xmath140 could be computed after fully specifying the flavon and gut higgs superpotential .",
    "given the `` irreducible '' contribution @xmath141 to @xmath142 @xcite , we can assume the @xmath143 to be real @xmath31 parameters .",
    "on the other hand the susy breaking trilinear terms @xcite take the form : @xmath144 where subdominant terms have been omitted .",
    "however after susy breaking in the hidden sector also the yukawa couplings appearing in @xmath145 are no longer the physical yukawa couplings for the low energy theory but take the form @xmath146 multiplied by the same factor also multiplying @xmath147 .",
    "this means that eq .",
    "( [ eq : sugraaterm_unrescaled ] ) is simplified to @xmath148 where @xmath149 runs over hidden sector fields and @xmath150 over visible sector fields .",
    "for this we used the fact that the rescaling factor only depends on hidden sector fields and thus commutes with @xmath151 due to sequestering .",
    "we can then define the usual msugra parameter @xmath152 which depends on the unspecified hidden sector superpotential and khler potential . regarding the yukawa matrices we can absorb the factor with @xmath153 and canonical hidden khler potential we get as factor @xmath154 ( @xmath155 if @xmath156 ) . ] @xmath157 into the previous definition of our yukawa matrices .",
    "however , the expressions linking the parameters @xmath108 s and @xmath158 s would be then modified by a @xmath31 coefficient .    from these formulae",
    "it is apparent why sequestering simplifies our construction for two reasons :    * it is known that models of the considered class with family symmetries with real triplets do not protect all particle species against large flavour violation in their soft mass matrices ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) . in our case , while the five - dimensional representation is protected , the ten - dimensional remains unprotected .",
    "in particular , without sequestering there could be planck scale suppressed couplings to hidden fields on the diagonal of the tenplet khler metric , inducing @xmath31 splittings of the tenplet soft masses .",
    "this would generate , in the basis where @xmath33 is diagonal ( the sckm basis ) , 1 - 2 entries in the soft mass matrices of the tenplet constituents which are only cabibbo suppressed .",
    "* with a sequestered khler potential all flavour violation effects come from the f - terms of the family symmetry breaking higgs fields , i.e.  the flavons , and in principle also from the f - terms of the gut - higgs fields .",

    "on the other hand , a portion of the parameter space in the reach of meg should escape the next generation eedm experiments .",
    "however , it is interesting to notice that a large part of the parameter space should be in the reach both of meg and the eedm experiments .",
    "these two observables are therefore highly complementary and the interplay between both of them represents a powerful test of the class of models we are discussing .",
    "in fact , an evidence of @xmath309 at meg , at the level of , say , br@xmath339 , would predict a lower bound on @xmath329 in the reach of the future experiments . on the other hand , observing the electron eedm with a value of the order of @xmath340 @xmath337 cm would imply that @xmath309 can be observed at meg .",
    "recent analyses of the consistency of the unitarity triangle ( ut ) have shown some tensions among the different observables used in the fit @xcite .",

    "this is due to a potentially large charged higgs mediated contribution , which grows with @xmath346 and always exhibits the opposite sign with respect to the sm contribution , whereas the present experimental measurement prefers values larger than the sm one ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",

    "however , the bulk of the points just predicts no large deviation from the sm prediction , i.e. @xmath361 .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated aspects of `` susy flavour '' models , towards predicting both flavour structures , in the context of sugra .",
    "we highlighted the importance of including carefully all the susy - specific effects such as one - loop susy threshold corrections and canonical normalization effects when fitting the model to the low energy data for the fermion masses and mixing angles .",
    "these effects entangle the flavour model with the susy parameters and leads to interesting predictions for the sparticle spectrum as well as , for instance , for the neutrino parameters .",
    "in addition , family symmetries introduced to explain the flavour structure of the standard model fermions can also make predictions testable in future flavour experiments .",
    "the extension of a pure model of flavour to a susy flavour model , and its phenomenological analysis , may be performed in the following steps :    * the starting point may be a family symmetry , as for instance @xmath9 , @xmath8 , or one of their non - abelian discrete subgroups like @xmath7 or @xmath6 ( cf .",
    "[ sec : model ] ) . *",
    "the discussion of the susy formulation of the model starts by defining the superpotential @xmath83 . *",
    "the operators induced in the khler potential @xmath84 by a given set of ( flavour ) messenger fields have to be included .",
    "* by canonically normalizing the fields ( cf .",
    "[ sec : normalisedyukawas ] ) the canonically normalized yukawa matrices are calculated . in this way",
    ", the structure of @xmath84 enters the model predictions for the sm flavour parameters ( i.e.  the fermion masses and mixings ) . * from @xmath84 and @xmath83",
    ", the ( canonically normalized ) soft susy - breaking parameters can be calculated . * to compare the flavour model predictions to the data , the rg evolution of all parameters has to be calculated . as discussed in sec .",
    "3.5 . , the inclusion of the one - loop susy threshold corrections is mandatory for all three generations at least for moderate and large @xmath46 - and connects the flavour model analysis to the susy parameters . * finally , the susy flavour structure , shaped by the same symmetries which govern the sm flavour structure , can give rise to various effects testable at flavour experiments .",
    "we have demonstrated these issues and applied the `` susy extension '' to a novel class of family symmetry models , assuming sequestering of @xmath83 and @xmath84 into visible and hidden sectors .",
    "the extension to susy , in addition to predictions for the susy flavour structure from the symmetries of the models , has various interesting effects :    * firstly , one - loop susy threshold corrections have turned out to have a crucial effect on the fit of the model to the data",
    ". not only the ratios of quark and charged lepton masses , which are predicted by the model at the gut scale but also the quark mixing angles , depend crucially on the threshold effects . via them the susy spectrum enters into the fit of the model to the data and from this constraints on the susy parameters can be obtained . using mc monte carlo techniques we demonstrated this for our example class of models . the main result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fullmcmcspectrum ] .",
    "we also compared our full mc monte carlo analysis with a simple semi - analytical treatment , which may be applied as a first step to understand such kind of constraints on the susy spectrum from a susy flavour model analysis . * secondly , also the canonical normalization of the kinetic terms , which generically requires a transformation ( including rescaling ) of the fields in a sugra context , modifies the yukawa matrices and thus affects the fit . in our class of models",
    "the canonical normalization effects were dominated by a single parameter ( related to a comparatively large ratio of the flavon vev @xmath362 over the messenger mass ) , a typical situation in flavour models with non - abelian family symmetries ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) . in our example class of models we saw , for example , that the prediction of tri - bimaximal mixing was modified by this effect , which imposed constraints on the canonical normalization parameter @xmath363 , and predicts a correlation in the deviation from tri - bimaxmial mixing ( cf .  also @xcite ) which could be tested in future precision neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "* thirdly , the example class of flavour models we considered and generalized here turned out to be an interesting novel class of susy flavour models - since the flavour structure of the soft susy breaking terms turned out to realise a scheme we dubbed `` trilinear dominance '' . while the soft masses at the gut scale have only very small off - diagonal elements , the flavour violating effects are mainly induced by the misalignment between the trilinear terms and the yukawa matrices , governed by only a few parameters .",
    "we conclude that if susy will be discovered at the lhc , models of flavour would have to be extended to susy - flavour models .",
    "the testability of such models could be enhanced significantly , for example by the predictions for the sparticle spectrum and @xmath46 .",
    "furthermore , flavour effects induced by the susy flavour structure could give new insights into flavour models , and characteristic susy flavour schemes ( like `` tri - linear dominance '' discussed here ) might be disentangled from others .",
    "finally , even precision tests of neutrino mixing angles can be sensitive to susy / sugra typical features like canonical normalization corrections , as we have seen in our example class of models .",

    "<S> if supersymmetry ( susy ) will be discovered , successful models of flavour not only have to provide an explanation of the flavour structure of the standard model fermions , but also of the flavour structure of their scalar superpartners . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss aspects of such `` susy flavour '' models , towards predicting both flavour structures , in the context of supergravity ( sugra ) . </S>",
    "<S> we point out the importance of carefully taking into account susy - specific effects , such as 1-loop susy threshold corrections and canonical normalization , when fitting the model to the data for fermion masses and mixings . </S>",
    "<S> this entangles the flavour model with the susy parameters and leads to interesting predictions for the sparticle spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate these effects by analyzing an example class of flavour models in the framework of an @xmath0 grand unified theory with a family symmetry with real triplet representations . </S>",
    "<S> for flavour violation through the susy soft breaking terms , the class of models realizes a scheme we refer to as `` trilinear dominance '' , where flavour violation effects are dominantly induced by the trilinear terms .    mpp-2011 - 43 + sissa 17/2011/ep     + stefan antusch@xmath1 ,   lorenzo calibbi@xmath2 ,   vinzenz maurer@xmath2   and martin spinrath@xmath3    @xmath4 _ department of physics , university of basel , _    </S>",
