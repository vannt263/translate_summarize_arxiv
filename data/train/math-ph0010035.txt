    "in many applications it is essential to find small inhomogeneities from surface data . for example , such a problem arises in ultrasound mammography , where small inhomogeneities are cancer cells .",
    "current x - ray mammography will be replaced by the ultrasound one because x - ray mammography has a high probability of creating new cancer cells in a woman s breast in the course of taking the mammography test .",
    "other examples include the problem of finding small holes and cracks in metals and other materials , or the mine detection . the scattering theory for small scatterers originated in the classical works of lord rayleigh .",
    "it was developed in @xcite and @xcite , where analytical formulas for the scattering matrix were derived for the acoustic and electromagnetic scattering problems . in @xcite and @xcite inverse scattering problems for small bodies are considered . in @xcite",
    "the problem of identification of small subsurface inhomogeneities from surface data was posed and its possible applications were discussed . in @xcite the results of the numerical experiments are presented for the problem of finding one small inhomogeneity from surface data . in @xcite a method for finding small inhomogeneities from tomographic data is proposed . the main result of our paper is the new optimization procedure which can be used for actual finding the small subsurface inhomogeneities from surface scattering data .",
    "our numerical results demonstrate that the method proposed in this paper is potentially of practical importance .",
    "consider a point source @xmath0 of monochromatic acoustic waves on the surface of the earth .",
    "let @xmath1 be acoustic pressure at the point @xmath2 , and @xmath3 be the wavenumber .",
    "the governing equation is :    @xmath4 u=-\\delta(x - y)\\ \\text{in}\\ r^3,\\ ] ]    @xmath5 satisfies the radiation condition at infinity , and @xmath6 is the inhomogeneity in the velocity profile , @xmath7 .",
    "let us assume that @xmath6 is a bounded function vanishing outside of the domain @xmath8 which is the union of @xmath9 small nonintersecting domains @xmath10 , all of them are located in the lower half - space @xmath11 .",
    "smallness is understood in the sense @xmath12 , where @xmath13 , and diam @xmath14 is the diameter of the domain @xmath14 .",
    "practically @xmath12 means that @xmath15 , in some cases @xmath16 is sufficient for obtaining acceptable numerical results .",
    "the background velocity in ( 1.1 ) equals to 1 , but we can consider the case of fairly general background velocity @xcite .",
    "denote @xmath17 and @xmath18 the positions of the gravity center of @xmath10 and the total intensity of the @xmath19 inhomogeneity @xmath20 .",
    "assume that @xmath21 .",
    "the inverse problem to be solved is :    * ip : * _ given @xmath1 for all @xmath22 on @xmath23 at a fixed @xmath3 , find the number @xmath9 of small inhomogeneities , the positions @xmath17 of the inhomogeneities , and their intensities @xmath18 . _",
    "let us introduce the following notations : @xmath24    @xmath25    are the points at which the data @xmath26are collected , @xmath27    @xmath28    @xmath29    @xmath30    @xmath31    the proposed method for solving the ( ip ) consists in finding the global minimizer of function ( 2.7 )",
    ". this minimizer @xmath32 gives the estimates of the positions @xmath17 of the small inhomogeneities and their intensities @xmath33 .",
    "the above approach can be justified as follows .",
    "the helmholtz equation ( 1.1 ) with the radiation condition is equivalent to the integral equation @xmath34    for small inhomogeneities the integral on the right - hand side of ( 2.8 ) can be approximately written as @xmath35    where @xmath36 is a point close to @xmath17 , and @xmath37 under the sign of the integral in ( 2.8 ) can be replaced by @xmath38 with a small error @xmath39 provided that @xmath40    where @xmath41    and @xmath9 is the number of inhomogeneities .",
    "note that the sufficient condition for the validity of the born approximation for equation ( 2.8 ) , is the smallness of the norm in @xmath42 of the integral operator in ( 2.8 ) .",
    "the above condition can be written as @xmath43 if @xmath44 , then @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the minimal distance from @xmath10 to @xmath47 .",
    "the relative error of the first approximation in ( 2.9 ) for @xmath44 is @xmath48 where @xmath46 is the minimal distance from @xmath10 to @xmath47 .",
    "if @xmath46 is not too small , @xmath49 is not too large , then the above error is small if @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a dimensionless quantity .",
    "condition ( * ) can be written as @xmath52 .",
    "this condition is much stronger than condition ( * * ) , which can be written as @xmath53 , since @xmath54 .",
    "therefore the approximation ( 2.9 ) is applicable when the born approximation may fail .",
    "if the condition @xmath55 holds , then condition ( * ) for the validity of the born approximation is violated because @xmath56 as @xmath57    condition ( * * * ) corresponds to the scattering by delta - type inhomogeneities . for such scattering",
    "the born approximation is not applicable , but a modified representation of the type ( 2.9 ) is valid ( see @xcite , p.113 , formula ( 1.1.33 ) , and @xcite , @xcite ) .    from ( 2.9 )",
    "and ( 2.6 ) it follows that @xmath58    therefore , parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18 can be estimated by the least - squares method if one finds the global minimum of the function ( 2.7 ) : @xmath59    the function @xmath60 depends on @xmath9 unknown points @xmath61 , and @xmath9 unknown parameters @xmath33 , @xmath62 .",
    "the parameter @xmath9 , the number of the small inhomogeneities , is estimated by the algorithm described in sec . 3 below ,",
    "see also a discussion in the beginning of section 4 .",
    "let the inhomogeneities be located within a box    @xmath63    and their intensities satisfy    @xmath64    then , given the location of the points @xmath65 , the minimum of @xmath60 in ( 2.13 ) with respect to the intensities @xmath66 can be found by minimizing the quadratic function in ( 2.7 ) over the region satisfying ( 3.2 ) .",
    "this can be done using normal equations for ( 2.7 ) and projecting the resulting point back onto the region defined by ( 3.2 ) .",
    "denote the result of this minimization by @xmath67 , that is    @xmath68    now the minimization problem ( 2.13 ) is reduced to the @xmath69-dimensional restrained minimization @xmath70    note , that the dependency of @xmath71 on its @xmath69 variables ( the coordinates of the points @xmath72 ) is highly nonlinear . in particular , this dependency is complicated by the computation of the minimum in ( 3.3 ) and the consequent projection onto the admissible set @xmath73 .",
    "thus , an analytical computation of the gradient of @xmath71 is not computationally efficient .",
    "we have used powell s quadratic minimization method to find local minima .",
    "this method uses a special procedure to numerically approximate the gradient , and it can be shown to exhibit the same type of quadratic convergence as conjugate gradient type methods ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , _ the exact number of the original inhomogeneities @xmath74 is unknown , and its estimate is a part of the inverse problem .",
    "_ in the hsd algorithm described below this task is accomplished by taking an initial number @xmath9 sufficiently large , so that    @xmath75    which , presumably , can be estimated from physical considerations .",
    "after all , our goal , is to find only the strongest inclusions , since the weak ones can not be distinguished from the background noise .",
    "the reduction procedure ( see below ) allows the algorithm to seek the minimum of @xmath71 in a lower dimensional subsets of the admissible set @xmath73 , thus finding the estimated number of inclusions @xmath9 .",
    "still another difficulty in the minimization is a large number of local minima of @xmath67 .",
    "while this phenomena is well known for the objective functions arising in various inverse problems , we illustrate this point on figure 1 .     ]    the original configuration @xmath76 is presented in table 1 .",
    "figure 1 shows the values of the function @xmath77 , where @xmath78 and @xmath79 the plot shows multiple local minima and almost flat regions .    a direct application of a gradient type method to such a function would result in finding a local minimum , which may or may not be the sought golobal one . in the example",
    "above , such a method would usually be trapped in a local minimum located at @xmath80 or @xmath81 . while the desired global minimum at @xmath82 will be found only for a sufficiently close initial guess @xmath83 . while various global minimization methods are known ( see below ) , we found that the most efficient way to accomplish the task for this inverse problem was to design a new method ( hsd ) combining both the stochastic and the deterministic approach to the global minimization . deterministic minimization algorithms with or without the gradient computation , such as the conjugate gradient methods , are known to be highly efficient ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however , the initial guess should be chosen sufficiently close to the sought minimum . also such algorithms ,",
    "as we mentioned above , tend to be trapped at a local minimum , which is not necessarily close to a global one .",
    "a new deterministic method is proposed in @xcite and @xcite , which is quite efficient according to @xcite . on the other hand , various stochastic minimization algorithms ,",
    "e.g. the simulated annealing method @xcite , are more likely to find a global minimum , but their convergence can be very slow . we have tried a variety of minimization algorithms to find an acceptable minimum of ( 3.4 ) or ( 2.13 ) . among them were the levenberg - marquardt method , conjugate gradients , downhill simplex , and simulated annealing method .",
    "none of them produced consistent satisfactory results .    among the minimization methods combining random and deterministic searches we mention deep s method @xcite and a variety of clustering methods @xcite , @xcite .",
    "an application of these methods to the particle identification using light scattering is described in @xcite .",
    "the clustering methods are quite robust but , usually , require a significant computational effort . the hsd method is a combination of a reduced sample random search method with certain ideas from genetic algorithms ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is very efficient and seems especially well suited for low dimensional global minimization .",
    "further research is envisioned to study its properties in more detail , and its applicability to other problems .",
    "while the steps of the hybrid stochastic - deterministic ( hsd ) method are outlined below , its basic idea is to start with a random search for the minimum .",
    "if at a certain configuration @xmath84 the minimized function is judged to be sufficiently small , this configuration is a candidate for the initial guess of a deterministic minimization method .",
    "however , this minimization is applied only after the points with smaller intensities in @xmath84 are dropped ( step 2 below ) , and all sufficiently close points are eliminated ( step 3 ) .",
    "now a deterministic minimization is performed in the resulting lower dimensional subspace .",
    "the minimizer @xmath85 is likely to represent at least some of the sought inhomogeneities .",
    "these points are supplemented with randomly chosen ones to obtain a full configuration ( step 1 ) . in this manner",
    "the iterations of the random searches and the deterministic minimization continue till a tolerance criterion is satisfied . as the algorithm finds configurations with smaller and smaller values of the objective function , the likelihood of the finding the global minimum increases , while the irrelevant local minima are eliminated .",
    "let us outline the steps of a possible implementation of the hsd algorithm for the surface data inverse scattering problem described in sections 1 and 2 .",
    "we assume that all the inhomogeneities are located in a ( known ) box @xmath73 , and @xmath9 is chosen according to ( 3.5 ) .",
    "our goal is to locate the points @xmath86 which minimize @xmath71 in ( 3.4 ) .",
    "let @xmath87 , and @xmath88 be positive numbers .",
    "let @xmath89 .    1 .",
    "generate randomly @xmath90 additional points @xmath91 to obtain a full configuration @xmath92 .",
    "compute @xmath93 .",
    "save the resulting best fit intensities @xmath94 ( see 3.3 ) .",
    "if @xmath95 then go to step 2 , otherwise repeat this step 1 .",
    "discharge all the points with the intensities @xmath33 satisfying @xmath96 . now",
    "only @xmath97 points @xmath98 remain in the box @xmath73 .",
    "3 .   if any two points @xmath99 in the above configuration satisfy @xmath100 , where @xmath101 , then eliminate point @xmath102 , change the intensity of point @xmath72 to @xmath103 , and assign @xmath104 .",
    "this step is repeated until no further reduction in @xmath105 is possible .",
    "4 .   run a restrained deterministic minimization of @xmath71 in @xmath106 variables , with the initial guess at the configuration determined in step 3 .",
    "let the minimizer be @xmath107 .",
    "if @xmath108 then save this configuration , and go to step 6 , otherwise let @xmath109 , and proceed to the next step 5 .",
    "keep intact n points @xmath107 . if the number of random configurations has exceeded @xmath110 ( the maximum number of random tries ) , then save the configuration and go to step 6 , else go to step 1 , and use these @xmath105 points there . 6 .",
    "repeat steps 1 through 5 @xmath111 times .",
    "7 .   find the configuration among the above @xmath111 ones , which gives the smallest value to @xmath71 .",
    "this is the best fit .",
    "step 1 is the stochastic part of the algorithm . in step 2 the points with low intensities",
    "are discharged , since they , most likely , are artifacts contributing on the level comparable with the background noise .",
    "step 3 is the reduction procedure replacing two nearby inclusions with one of the joint intensity .",
    "steps 2 and 3 lower the dimensionality of the minimization domain , thus greatly reducing the computational time needed to perform the deterministic minimization of the step 4 . we have used powell s minimization method ( see @xcite for a detailed description ) for the deterministic part , since this method does not need gradient computations and converges quadratically near quadratically shaped minima .",
    "also , in step 1 , an idea from the genetic algorithm s approach @xcite is implemented by keeping only the strongest representatives of the population and allowing a mutation for the rest .",
    "the algorithm was tested on a variety of configurations . here",
    "we present the results of just two typical numerical experiments illustrating the performance of the method .",
    "the data was simulated according to ( 2.12 ) . in both experiments",
    "the box @xmath73 is taken to be @xmath63 with @xmath112 .",
    "the frequency @xmath113 , and the effective intensities @xmath33 are in the range from @xmath114 to @xmath115 , ( see section 1 ) .",
    "the values of the parameters defined in section 3 were chosen as follows @xmath116 in both cases we searched for the same 6 inhomogeneities with the coordinates @xmath117 and the intensities @xmath118 shown in table 1 .        in general ,",
    "the execution times were less than 2 minutes on a 333mhz pc .",
    "as it can be seen from the results , the method achieves a perfect identification in the experiment # 1 when no noise is present .",
    "the identification deteriorates in the presence of noise , as well as if the sources and detectors are not located directly above the search area .",
    "still the inclusions with the highest intensity and the closest ones to the surface are identified , while the deepest and the weakest are lost .",
    "this can be expected , since their influence on the cost functional is becoming comparable with the background noise in the data .    in summary , the proposed method for the identification of small inclusions can be used in geophysics , medicine and technology .",
    "it can be useful in the development of new approaches to ultrasound mammography .",
    "it can also be used for localization of holes and cracks in metals and other materials , as well as for finding mines from surface measurements of acoustic pressure and possibly in other problems of interest in various applications .",
    "the hsd minimization method is a specially designed low - dimensional minimization method , which is well suited for many inverse type problems .",
    "the problems do not necessarily have to be within the born approximation range .",
    "it is highly desirable to study applications of this method , and to compare its performance to other competitive methods ."
