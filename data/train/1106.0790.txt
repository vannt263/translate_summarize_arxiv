    "was investigated .",
    "it was concluded that the third baryogenesis condition is not fulfilled , and the ept becomes of the second order in strong fields .",
    "thus , a deviation from the thermal equilibrium in the msm is not strong enough , and sakharov s baryogenesis scenario is not realized .    in connection with this ,",
    "the investigation of the ept in extensions of the standard model is of substantial interest .",
    "one of the extensions is the two - higgs - doublet model ( thdm )  @xcite . the thdm predicts four additional scalar particles : a neutral particle @xmath2 , a pair of charged fields @xmath3 and a pseudoscalar particle @xmath4 .",
    "as compared with the msm , the thdm contains more free parameters in the scalar sector .",
    "the ept in the thdm was investigated in  @xcite .",
    "the obtained results were revised in  @xcite by using an improved approximation ( avoidance of the high - temperature expansion , inclusion of the ring diagrams , and taking the experimentally measured mass of the top quark into account ) .",
    "it was concluded that the third baryogenesis condition is fulfilled in the thdm for some parameter values . in @xcite",
    "a connection between the strength of the ept and the one - loop correction to the triple self - coupling of the lightest higgs boson was considered , and the deviation of the coupling value from the sm prediction was estimated . in @xcite , as well as in the recent paper  @xcite , possible scenarios of the model behavior during the cooling were investigated .",
    "it was shown that the realization of a certain scenario strongly depends on the parameter values of the scalar potential .",
    "the authors have computed the gibbs potential in the thdm in a simple approximation considering only the first non - trivial finite - temperature corrections to the tree - level potential .",
    "within this potential they observed a few interesting phenomena :    \\1 . a sequence of phase transitions ( a second - order ept breaks the electroweak symmetry ; then a first - order ept occurs ) .",
    "exotic cp - breaking or charge - breaking minima can be realized during the cooling .",
    "the main goal of the present paper is to determine the domain of the thdm parameters , for which the strong first - order phase transition happens and the third baryogenesis condition holds .",
    "we use the approximation of thermal equilibrium .",
    "following @xcite , we compute the gibbs potential in the one - loop order and include contributions of the ring diagrams . this consistent approximation ,",

    "we found that there is a wide domain in the parameter space of the model , for which the third sakharov s baryogenesis condition is fulfilled .",
    "the values of the parameters entering the potential correspond to the scalar field masses that are compatible with modern experimental constraints .",
    "the parameter values for this domain can be found by using the introduced relation ( [ eq : opt_condition ] ) .",
    "the ept kind depends strongly on the tree - level parameter values .",
    "we have observed that the single phase transitions , as well as the sequences of transitions of the first and second orders , may happen .    we have concluded from our analysis that the restrictions @xmath162 , @xmath163 do not ensure that the symmetry breaking is realized along the @xmath127 direction , as it was proposed in @xcite .",
    "we have seen also that in the model studied in @xcite , three degenerate vacua may coexist .",
    "some of them can be realized as overcooled states .    nowadays , there are few essential experimental constraints on the thdm parameter values : the lower bound on the mass of a charged scalar field in the mssm and the bounds on @xmath164 ( see review in @xcite ) . in this situation",
    "the parameter values , for which the successful baryogenesis is possible , could be used as certain reference points in the study of a model extending the msm .            for the stability of the tree - level vacuum ,",
    "the potential value at large @xmath6 values has to be positive .",
    "this translates into sylvester s criterion for the quadratic form @xmath169 then the scalar field couplings are restricted to the conditions @xmath170    in the present paper we consider the case where the potential minimum is realized at @xmath171 , @xmath172 .",
    "this is because other cases @xmath171 , @xmath173 or vice versa can be reduced to the msm case with several additional fields , and no mass mixing is present .",
    "as it was shown in @xcite , the latter case also leads to a possibility of successful baryogenesis through a two - stage phase transition .              at @xmath190 the @xmath4 and",
    "@xmath160 masses are gauge - invariant , and the goldstone fields masses are @xmath191 , @xmath192 .",

    "the expression for the thdm potential used in @xcite is @xmath201 + \\ ] ] @xmath202 where @xmath203 and we consider the cp - conserving case only . by comparing this expression with ( [ eq : scal_pot ] ) and ( [ eq : treelevelpotential ] )",
