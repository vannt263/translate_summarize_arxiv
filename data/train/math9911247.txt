    "this paper concerns the dehn surgery construction @xcite , in particular , those dehn surgeries leaving the manifold unchanged , a phenomenon we call _ cosmetic _ surgery . in",
    "what follows it will be useful to consider the dehn surgery construction in terms of the slightly more general notion of dehn filling , recalled below .",
    "let @xmath0 be an oriented 3manifold with torus boundary @xmath8 , and let @xmath9 be a slope on @xmath10 , that is , an isotopy class of unoriented , simple , closed curves in @xmath11 . define @xmath12 , the _ r  dehn filling _ on @xmath0 , as @xmath13 where the boundaries are identified by a homeomorphism taking @xmath14 to the slope @xmath9 .",
    "the connection with dehn surgery is regained by considering @xmath4 as a surgery on @xmath15 .",
    "two dehn fillings are considered _ cosmetic _ if there is a homeomorphism @xmath6 between @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the dehn fillings are _ truly cosmetic _ if the homeomorphism @xmath6 is orientation preserving , and",
    "_ reflectively cosmetic _ if @xmath6 is orientation reversing .",
    "a pair of fillings @xmath3 and @xmath4 may be both truly cosmetic and reflectively cosmetic .    one s intuition might say that cosmetic surgeries must be rare , but examples are easy to find . as described in rolfsen s beautiful book ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 9 ) reflecting in the plane of the paper shows that @xmath16 and @xmath17 surgeries on an amphicheiral knot in the 3sphere yield oppositely oriented copies of the same manifold , and performing @xmath18 surgery on the unknot always produces a consistently oriented 3sphere .",
    "see figure 1 .",
    ".9    in both these cases , however , there exists a homeomorphism of the torally bounded knot exterior @xmath0 which takes one surgery slope to the other .",
    "we call two slopes _ equivalent _ if such a homeomorphism exists .",
    "truly cosmetic ( resp .",
    "reflectively cosmetic ) dehn fillings @xmath3 and @xmath4 are considered _ mundane _ when there is an orientation preserving ( resp .",
    "orientation reversing ) homeomorphism of @xmath0 taking @xmath1 to @xmath2 .",
    "cosmetic dehn fillings which are not mundane are _",
    "exotic_.    there is one easy way to find exotic cosmetic fillings : swapping the sides of a heegaard splitting of certain lens spaces can produce true and reflective exotic cosmetic surgeries on the unknot . in particular , @xmath16 and @xmath19 surgeries yielding the lens spaces @xmath20 and @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 perform this happy trick , for example @xmath24 and @xmath25 surgeries .",
    "so we require the space @xmath0 not to be homeomorphic to @xmath26 in our definition of _ exotic _ cosmetic fillings",
    ".    now things are much harder .",
    "indeed , recent results in surgery theory suggest that examples of exotic cosmetic surgeries are few and far between . for example , the solutions to the knot complement problems in @xmath27 @xcite and in @xmath28 @xcite , phrased in the language here , state that the 3sphere @xmath27 and the manifold @xmath29 never arise via cosmetic surgery .",
    "so one thinks of cosmetic surgeries as occurring on knots in more general manifolds .",
    "similar results hold when the first betti number of the manifold is positive .",
    "for example , boileau , domergue , and mathieu @xcite showed in 1995 that if @xmath0 is irreducible and the core of the surgered solid torus is homotopically trivial in such an @xmath3 , then for @xmath2 distinct from @xmath1 , the manifold @xmath4 is never even simple homotopy equivalent to @xmath3 .",
    "an extension and sharpening of this result was given by m lackenby @xcite shortly thereafter .",
    "assume that @xmath0 is irreducible and atoroidal and , as before , that the core of the surgered torus is homotopically trivial in @xmath3 with first betti number positive .",
    "then lackenby s theorem shows that if at least one of the slopes @xmath2 and @xmath30 has a sufficiently high geometric intersection number with @xmath1 , @xmath4 and @xmath31 are orientation preserving homeomorphic if and only if @xmath32 , and @xmath4 and @xmath31 are orientation reversing homeomorphic if and only if the surgery core is amphicheiral and @xmath33 .",
    "the assumption of homotopic triviality is important here , as illustrated by certain seifert fibre spaces . as first shown by mathieu @xcite , @xmath34 and @xmath35 surgeries on the right hand trefoil yield oppositely oriented copies of the same seifert fibre space .",
    "the slopes are inequivalent since they have different distances from the meridian , and any homeomorphism of the knot exterior must take the meridian to itself .",
    "the existence of seifert fibred cosmetic surgeries has a particularly nice picture in the kirby calculus ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 9 ) and depends on the existence of an exceptional fibre of index 2 .",
    "the key property of such an exceptional fibre is that after orientation reversal , the type of an exceptional fibre of index 2 can be restored via a twist .",
    "see figure 2 which begins with a surgery description of the trefoil knot @xmath36 in @xmath27 .",
    "( this comes from the seifert fibration of @xmath27 over @xmath37 with a trefoil knot as regular fibre and two exceptional fibres of order 2 and 3  see seifert @xcite , montesinos @xcite . )",
    ".9    the same construction gives examples of exotic cosmetic surgeries on seifert fibre spaces with positive first betti number , starting with surgery descriptions of seifert fibred spaces over higher genus surfaces as in ( * ? ? ? * , p. 146 ) .",
    "this observation was also used by rong @xcite to classify the cosmetic surgeries where @xmath0 carries a seifert fibration and the surgery yields a seifert fibre space .",
    "one consequence of the classification is that all the exotic cosmetic surgeries on seifert fibre spaces are reflective .",
    "another consequence of this technique is the fact that if a seifert fibred @xmath0 admits a pair of cosmetic surgeries yielding a seifert fibre space , it admits an infinity of such pairs .",
    "from seifert fibred cosmetic surgeries it is fairly easy to construct examples of cosmetic surgeries on graph manifolds , so the question arises as to whether there are any hyperbolic examples .",
    "such examples are unexpected because of the general theory of 1cusped hyperbolic manifolds . for example , a theorem similar to m lackenby s but for homotopically non - trivial knots and showing there can be only finitely many cosmetic surgeries on a hyperbolic knot is given below . throughout this paper hyperbolic 3manifolds are assumed to be _ complete _ and of _ finite volume_.    let @xmath0 be a @xmath38cusped , orientable hyperbolic 3manifold .",
    "then there exists a finite set of slopes @xmath39 on @xmath40 , such that if @xmath1 and @xmath2 are distinct slopes outside @xmath39 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 homeomorphic implies that there exists an orientation reversing isometry @xmath6 of @xmath0 such that @xmath41 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath0 is a classical knot complement , then the knot is amphicheiral and @xmath42 .",
    "* proof*by thurston s theory of hyperbolic dehn surgery [ t1 ] , we can choose @xmath39 so that each filling outside @xmath39 gives a hyperbolic manifold in which the surgery core circle is isotopic to the _ unique _ shortest closed geodesic .",
    "assume @xmath43 are outside @xmath39 and @xmath3 is homeomorphic to @xmath4 .",
    "then by mostow rigidity there is an isometry @xmath44 taking the core geodesic @xmath45 to core geodesic @xmath46 .",
    "this restricts to a homeomorphism of @xmath0 taking @xmath1 to @xmath2 .",
    "the following lemma then completes the proof .",
    "let @xmath0 be a @xmath38cusped , orientable hyperbolic 3manifold . if @xmath47 is a homeomorphism which changes the slope of some peripheral curve , then @xmath6 is orientation reversing .",
    "if @xmath0 is a classical knot complement , then @xmath6 takes each slope @xmath9 to @xmath48 .",
    "* proof*by poincar duality , the map induced by inclusion @xmath49 has a 1dimensional kernel @xmath36 .",
    "the hyperbolic structure on the interior of @xmath0 gives a natural euclidean metric on @xmath50 , defined up to similarity .",
    "by mostow rigidity , @xmath6 is homotopic to an isometry , hence @xmath51 is an isometry .",
    "further , @xmath36 and its orthogonal complement are preserved by @xmath52 so each is a @xmath53 or @xmath54 eigenspace for @xmath52 .",
    "it follows that if @xmath6 is orientation preserving then @xmath55 , so @xmath6 does not change the slope of any peripheral curve .",
    "if @xmath0 is a classical knot complement , then @xmath6 preserves both the longitude and meridian up to sign ( using the solution to the knot complement problem @xcite ) .",
    "hence , if @xmath6 is orientation reversing , each slope is taken to its negative .",
    "the theorem strongly suggests that finding cosmetic surgeries on hyperbolic manifolds that yield hyperbolic manifolds is hard , perhaps impossible .",
    "instead one looks to find cosmetic surgeries that yield non - hyperbolic manifolds , such as the lens spaces .",
    "another reason to look here is that there are cosmetic surgeries in the solid torus .",
    "in fact , berge @xcite and gabai ( @xcite , @xcite ) classify those knots in @xmath56 which have inequivalent slopes which fill to @xmath26 .    from their classification , these knots are certain 1bridge braids and , with a unique exception where there are three such slopes , these knots have exactly two slopes which yield a solid torus when filled .",
    "the meridian of this new solid torus , however , is quite different from the meridian of the original solid torus . indeed , as originally shown by c gordon @xcite , if one performs @xmath16surgery on a knot in a solid torus and again obtains a solid torus , the meridian of this new solid torus is given by the slope @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the winding number of the original knot in the solid torus .",
    "now , from such a knot in a solid torus it is easy to construct a torally bounded 3manifold having a pair of slopes yielding lens spaces by attaching a solid torus to the outside of the solid torus in which the knot lies .",
    "the lens spaces produced are determined by the relation of this last attaching curve to the meridians described above .",
    "this has led to a conjectural classification of the fillings on hyperbolic knot complements in the @xmath59sphere which yield lens spaces , see @xcite .",
    "of course , the purpose here is to construct examples where filling on the appropriate slopes yields homeomorphic lens spaces .",
    "this requirement produces a severe number theoretic obstruction , namely , that the outside attaching slope @xmath9 be simultaneously a @xmath60 and @xmath61 curve with @xmath62 or @xmath63 with respect to our two meridians .",
    "( see @xcite or @xcite . )",
    "the number @xmath64 is , of course , the geometric intersection number of @xmath9 and the meridians , and is commonly referred to as the _ distance _ between the two slopes .",
    "this already puts powerful restrictions on the allowable slopes as given a pair of slopes @xmath65 and @xmath66 , there are exactly two slopes equidistant from @xmath1 and @xmath2 . for this",
    "one notes that the geometric intersection number is just @xmath67 , so if @xmath68 is equidistant from @xmath1 and @xmath2 then either @xmath69 or @xmath70 . in the former case it follows that @xmath71 and in the latter that @xmath72 .",
    "the precise lens spaces produced are then determined by the following .",
    "let @xmath73 be the manifold obtained by @xmath74 and @xmath75 dehn fillings on the two boundary components of @xmath76 $ ] , where @xmath77 .",
    "let @xmath78 be integers such that @xmath79 .",
    "then @xmath73 is the lens space @xmath20 where @xmath80 .",
    "* proof*the linear automorphism of @xmath11 given by the matrix @xmath81}^{-1 } = \\left[\\matrix { b & -a \\cr -b^ * & a^ * \\cr}\\right]\\ ] ] takes the slopes @xmath82 and @xmath83 to @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "a further restriction on @xmath9 arises from hyperbolicity . considering the complements of these braids in the solid torus as link exteriors , one notes that of the six types listed in the berge  gabai classification only four are atoroidal and acylindrical , and hence by thurston ( @xcite , @xcite )",
    "correspond to 2cusped hyperbolic manifolds .",
    "if one wishes to construct hyperbolic examples by the above construction , the slope @xmath9 must lie in the hyperbolic region of the dehn surgery space of these manifolds .",
    "after filling on @xmath9 , there is also the question as to whether the slopes @xmath1 and @xmath2 are indeed inequivalent .",
    "both these points are exemplified by a family of braids for which the construction gives distinct fillings yielding homeomorphic lens spaces .",
    "these examples arise from the berge braids of  type iv \" and the pythagorean triples of the form @xmath86 . in particular , denoting by @xmath87 the product of the first @xmath88 standard braid generators , the braids @xmath89 give rise to a family of torally bounded 3manifolds each with one pair of slopes yielding oppositely oriented copies of @xmath90 and another pair of slopes yielding oppositely oriented copies of @xmath91 . however , it turns out that each of these torally bounded 3manifolds has the structure of an amphicheiral graph manifold .",
    "this was initially suggested by computer calculations via snappea [ we ] , then confirmed , after using lots of string , by a direct analysis via the montesinos trick ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "so these examples are neither hyperbolic nor surgeries on inequivalent slopes .",
    "the preceding discussion makes the following example even more striking .",
    "our construction will produce an oriented 1cusped hyperbolic manifold @xmath0 with an exotic pair of reflective cosmetic dehn fillings .",
    "the filled manifolds @xmath3 and @xmath4 will be oppositely oriented copies of the lens space @xmath5 , and the cusped manifold @xmath0 will be presented naturally as a knot exterior in @xmath28 .",
    "begin with the now infamous 1bridge braid @xmath92 in a solid torus .",
    "this braid and its mirror image are the unique 1bridge braids with three distinct slopes which yield a solid torus when filled ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "when the solid torus @xmath93 in which the braid lies is considered to be a standard torus in the 3sphere @xmath27 , these special slopes are given by @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 .",
    "filling on these slopes produces solid tori whose meridians are represented by the @xmath94 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 slopes on the boundary of @xmath93 .",
    ".5    for the pair @xmath99 and @xmath100 it follows from our discussion above that the slopes @xmath94 and @xmath101 are equidistant to @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "of course , attaching a solid torus to the @xmath16 curve on a standard solid torus in @xmath27 is the same as performing @xmath102 surgery on the core of the complementary solid torus . choosing @xmath94",
    "then , our braid becomes a knot in @xmath28 representing @xmath103 in @xmath104 .",
    "an analysis by snappea @xcite shows that the exterior of this knot is hyperbolic and that there is no homeomorphism taking the slope @xmath95 to @xmath96 .",
    "( alternatively , the montesinos trick can be used to show this knot exterior to be atoroidal and acylindrical . )",
    "so if filling on these slopes does indeed produce homeomorphic manifolds , we have the example we seek .",
    "but now an easy exercise , using lemma 3 or the kirby calculus ( see figure 4 ) , shows that filling on these slopes produces the manifolds @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    ".9    since @xmath107 and @xmath108 , the classification of lens spaces shows that one has obtained oppositely oriented copies of the lens space @xmath5 .",
    "* remark*in snappea s notation , these cosmetic surgeries are given by the @xmath109 and @xmath110 fillings on the cusped hyperbolic manifold @xmath111 .",
    "to date this is the only known example of exotic cosmetic surgery on a hyperbolic knot exterior . as it and all the seifert fibred examples are reflective , it seems appropriate to make the following conjecture , given in problem 1.81 of kirby s problem list @xcite .",
    "if @xmath112 and @xmath113 areknots in a closed , oriented 3manifold @xmath73 whose complements are homeomorphic via an orientation - preserving homeomorphism , then there exists an orientation - preserving homeomorphism of @xmath73 taking @xmath112 to @xmath113 .",
    "* remarks*(3 ) @xmath114 ( 4 ) but they are not equivalent as it may happen that the core of one of the surgeries is not isotopic to a closed geodesic . some evidence for these conjectures has been provided by a computer search : no manifold in the hodgson ",

    "weeks census of 4,815 cusped , orientable hyperbolic 3-manifolds triangulated by at most 7 ideal simplices .",
    "( all of these hyperbolic manifolds are incorporated in snappea @xcite . )",
    "one can also ask the above questions with homeomorphism replaced by homotopy equivalence or simple homotopy equivalence ( see @xcite for a version which is different because the knots are null - homotopic ) .",
    "we note that there is a hyperbolic knot exterior in a lens space with a pair of slopes which yield non - homeomorphic but orientation preserving homotopy equivalent lens spaces .",
