    "an important question in the study of evolving populations is to understand the effect of selection on the ancestry and on the genealogies @xcite . in absence of selection , for a well mixed population such as in the wright - fisher model , the statistical properties of the genealogy of a large population of constant size",
    "is described by kingman s coalescent @xcite .",
    "recent attempts to modify the wright - fisher model in order to introduce selection lead to a change of the statistical properties of genealogies : in @xcite , the study of a whole class of models indicates that the genealogies of populations evolving under selection are given by bolthausen - sznitman s coalescent @xcite rather than by kingman s ( this has been shown analytically only for one specific version of the model , the exponential model ( see below ) , but it has also been checked in numerical simulations and proved for a modified version of the model where the effect of selection is represented by a moving absorbing wall along the fitness axis @xcite ) . in the present paper , we further study these simple models of evolution with selection and we calculate how the statistical properties of the genealogies are correlated to the speed of evolution .    the models of evolution with selection we consider here have been introduced in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "they can be defined as follows : at each generation @xmath0 the population consists of a fixed number @xmath1 of individuals and each individual @xmath2 is characterized by a single number @xmath3 representing its adaptation in the environment .",
    "so @xmath3 is the position of individual @xmath2 on a fitness or adaptation axis ( very much like in the bak - sneppen model @xcite ) .",
    "this individual has several offspring at positions @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , etc .",
    ", where the @xmath7 are random numbers representing the change of adaptation due to mutations between parent @xmath2 and child @xmath8 .",
    "the total number of offspring produced this way by all individuals at a given generation @xmath0 exceeds @xmath1 ; the population at generation @xmath9 is then obtained by keeping the @xmath1 most adapted children ( i.e. the @xmath1 rightmost points along the axis ) among all these offspring , see figure  [ fig : ex ] .",
    "the model is fully specified when the distribution of the number offspring of each individual and the distribution of the random shifts @xmath10 are given .     in a model where each individual has two offspring . ]    after letting such a model evolve for a large number @xmath0 of generations , the positions @xmath3 of the individuals on the adaptation axis from a cloud of points grouped around a position @xmath11 which grows linearly with time with some velocity @xmath12 .",
    "there is some arbitrariness in the way this position @xmath13 can be defined ( one could choose for example @xmath11 to be the position of the rightmost individual , or of the leftmost individual or the center of mass of the population ) but , as the positions of all the individuals remain grouped , a change of definition modifies the value of @xmath11 by an amount which does not grow with time and therefore does not affect the velocity @xmath12 .",
    "in addition to the velocity , the position @xmath11 has fluctuations : in particular it diffuses with a variance which grows linearly in time @xcite .",
    "individuals._right : _ the coalescence times @xmath14 corresponding to the tree . ]    at each generation , one can study the genealogy of the population of this model by considering the matrix @xmath14 of the ages of the most recent common ancestors , or _ coalescence times _ , of all pairs of individuals @xmath2 and @xmath8 living at generation @xmath0 ; see figure  [ fig : coltimes ] .",
    "as the genealogy is a tree , the whole ancestry of the population can be deduced from the knowledge of this matrix .",
    "in particular the age of the most recent common ancestor of any subset of the population can be expressed in terms of this matrix : for example the age @xmath15 of the most recent common ancestor of three individuals @xmath2 , @xmath8 and @xmath16 at generation @xmath0 is simply @xmath17    one property common to the models of evolution under selection studied here and to the neutral models of evolution described by kingman s coalescent is that the heights and the shapes of the genealogical trees fluctuate with @xmath0 even when the size @xmath1 of the population becomes large .",
    "the statistical properties of these trees and their time scales are however different : for instance , the typical age of the most recent common ancestors of @xmath16 individuals grows logarithmically with the population size  @xmath1 in presence of selection ( as in the models studied here ) while it grows linearly with @xmath1 in the neutral case .",
    "there are several ways of describing the statistical properties of these trees ( see section  [ sec : poissondirichlet ] ) . in @xcite",
    "we chose to characterize them by the average coalescence times @xmath18 of @xmath16 individuals chosen at random in the population : @xmath19 ( here @xmath20 denotes an average over the individuals @xmath21 and over the generation @xmath0 ) .",
    "the @xmath1 dependence of @xmath22 gives the time scale over which coalescence events occur , while the ratios @xmath23 are a signature of the statistical properties of the shape of the trees .",
    "we found in @xcite that these ratios in presence of selection converge when @xmath24 to those of a bolthausen - snitzmann coalescent : @xmath25    our goal here is to calculate how these ratios are correlated to the speed of evolution , by weighting all the events during a long time interval @xmath26 by a factor @xmath27 .",
    "( @xmath28 favors events with a speed of evolution faster than average , while @xmath29 correponds to events with a slower speed of evolution . )",
    "our main result , derived below for the exponential model , is that the above ratios become for large  @xmath1 @xmath30 it is remarkable that these expressions interpolate between the neutral case ( kingman ) for @xmath31 ( low speed limit ) and the selection case ( bolthausen - snitzmann ) for @xmath32 . when @xmath33 ( high speed limit ) , all the ratios become @xmath34 indicating a `` star - shaped '' coalescent .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : weight ] , we explain how the weighting by the factor @xmath27 is done . in section  [ sec : exp ] , we show that in presence of the bias , one version of the model ( the exponential model ) can be solved exactly by analyzing a coalescent model , the rates of which depend on @xmath35 .",
    "this leads to ( [ beta ] ) . in section  [ sec : phenom ] we argue using the phenomenological theory developed in @xcite that should remain valid for other versions of the model up to a change of scale of @xmath35 .",
    "lastly in section  [ sec : poissondirichlet ] we compare the @xmath35-random tree structure which leads to to the statistics of the partitions in mean field spin glasses and in the poisson - dirichlet distribution .",
    "if one performs a simulation of the model described in the introduction , one can measure at each generation @xmath0 the position @xmath11 of the population ( defined in any reasonable way : as explained in the introduction , the precise definition does not matter ) and the ages @xmath36 of the most recent common ancestor of @xmath37 individuals chosen at random in the population at time  @xmath0 ( for more efficiency one can average these times @xmath38 over all the choices of the @xmath16 individuals in the population at time  @xmath0 ) .",
    "then we choose a long time interval @xmath26 and we want to determine @xmath39      as the model is a markov process and correlations decay fast enough in time , we expect that , for large  @xmath0 , @xmath40 the knowledge of @xmath41 determines all the cumulants of the position @xmath11 @xmath42 it is also related to the large deviation function @xmath43 of the velocity defined by @xmath44 through a legendre transform @xmath45.\\ ] ] for large @xmath0 , the value of @xmath46 which dominates the weighted averages in ( [ tbeta ] ) and ( [ ld ] ) is given by @xmath47 with fluctuations of order @xmath48 .",
    "therefore the weighted averages ( [ tbeta ] ) become equivalent in the @xmath49 limit to conditioning on the velocity @xmath46 given by ( [ vbeta ] ) .",
    "this is , in the present context , the analog of the well known equivalence of ensembles in statistical physics .",
    "numerically it is difficult to perform averages such as because the events which dominate both the numerator and the denominator of ( [ tbeta ] ) are rare events . in order to overcome this difficulty",
    ", we use an importance sampling method .",
    "we consider a sample periodic in time of period @xmath26 where @xmath26 is chosen large enough .",
    "this means that the random shifts @xmath7 are periodic in time ( @xmath50 for all @xmath2 , @xmath8 and @xmath0 ) . with these periodic @xmath7 ,",
    "the evolution of the system becomes also periodic in time : the shift @xmath51 of the position of the population after one period  @xmath26 can therefore be unambigously defined and depends on all the @xmath7 .",
    "then , we perform a standard monte - carlo simulation : at each step we try a new sample by changing some of the @xmath7 and we let the system evolve till it becomes periodic ( here we change all the @xmath7 at a random time @xmath0 uniformly distributed between @xmath34 and @xmath52 ) . the outcome of this change is to modify the @xmath51 to a new value @xmath53 .",
    "then , as always with a metropolis algorithm , we accept the change with a probability @xmath54 \\big]$ ] . with this procedure samples",
    "are produced with a weight @xmath55 $ ] , so that by averaging quantities such as the @xmath56 over many samples one gets an estimate of .",
    "we have simulated the exponential model ( see section  [ sec : exp ] where we give the precise definition of the exponential model and its analytic solution in the @xmath24 limit ) for @xmath57 and a value of @xmath58 which is much larger than @xmath59 @xcite . for each value of @xmath35 , we measured @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 averaged on @xmath63 monte - carlo steps .",
    "we have also simulated a more generic model where each individual has exactly two offspring with independent random shifts @xmath7 uniformly distributed between 0 and  1 .",
    "this model can not be solved exactly , but a phenomenological theory ( see @xcite and section  [ sec : phenom ] ) predicts when @xmath24 the same statistics of the genealogical trees as in the exponential model with @xmath35 replaced by @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the value which minimizes the function @xmath66/\\gamma$ ] , see section  [ sec : phenom ] .",
    "we simulated the sizes @xmath67 , @xmath57 and @xmath68 with values of @xmath69 which is much larger than @xmath22 , and again averaged over @xmath63 monte - carlo steps .",
    "we also checked for several values of @xmath35 that our results remain unchanged by choosing a value of the period @xmath26 twice as big ( results not shown ) , indicating that our monte - carlo results would be the same for an infinite time - window .",

    "the results for @xmath70 and @xmath71 are presented in figures  [ fig : t3 ] and  [ fig : t4 ] . as in @xcite , we observe that for the exponential model , the results are already very close to their asymptotic limits even for @xmath57 ; only for @xmath72 there is a discrepancy with the theoretical prediction  . as in @xcite ,",
    "the convergence is however slower in the generic case but the curves seem in both cases to converge to the prediction .",
    "in this section we consider a version of the model , the exponential model , which can be solved exactly @xcite . in the exponential model ,",
    "the shifts of the offspring of each individual are generated by a poisson process of density @xmath73 .",
    "this means that an individual at position @xmath3 has a probability @xmath74 of having an offspring in the infinitesimal interval @xmath75 .",

    "very much like in the coalescence problems discussed above , where all the individuals at a generation @xmath0 can be grouped into @xmath26-families , one can group the spin configurations of a spin glass model according to their distances @xmath176 ( or to their overlap@xmath177 ) in phase space .",

    "the parisi theory predicts also all the statistical properties of these @xmath178 . for example @xmath180 where according to the broken replica symmetry @xmath181 in ( [ spinglass ] ) all the dependence on the distance @xmath176 , on the details of the model , and on the parameters such as the temperature or the magnetic field is through the parameter @xmath122 .",
    "formula ( [ spinglass - bis ] ) follows from a very simple replica calculation : assume that one has @xmath182 replicas grouped into @xmath183 families of @xmath122 replicas , @xmath184 is simply the probability that @xmath16 replicas chosen at random among the @xmath182 replicas belong to the same family .    for typical samples",
    "one has to take the @xmath185 limit as in ( [ spinglass ] ) and the statistics of the @xmath186 coincide with those of the bolthausen - sznitman coalescent : one can check that the @xmath187 obtained in ( [ zkk ] ) coincides with ( [ spinglass ] ) by choosing @xmath188 and the @xmath161 given by .    in the spin glass case",

    "therefore , although the statistical properties of the trees in the model of evolution with selection and in the spin glass problem are the same for typical samples , they become different when one introduces a bias ( related to the free energy in the spin glass problem and to the speed of adaptation in the models of evolution with selection ) .",
    "the poisson - dirichlet distribution @xcite is a probability distribution of the partitions of a unit interval into infinitely many subintervals .",
    "it is parametrized by two parameters @xmath193 and @xmath194 .",
    "one way of defining the poisson - dirichlet distribution is to consider an infinite sequence @xmath195 , @xmath196 , ",
    ", @xmath197 ,  of independent numbers , each @xmath197 being distributed according to a distribution @xmath198 ( which is a @xmath35 distribution ) .",

    "@xmath201 ,  with @xmath202 where the @xmath203 are given by @xmath204 for such a partition",
    "one can introduce the quantities @xmath205 which represents the probability that @xmath16 points chosen at random on the unit interval fall in the same subinterval .",
    "it is easy to check that when one averages over the @xmath206 , one gets @xmath207 the solution of this recursion is @xmath208 one can notice @xcite that these expressions are identical to the replica expressions ( [ spinglass - bis ] ) of @xmath184 when one chooses @xmath209 and @xmath210 .",
    "therefore as soon as one introduces the bias @xmath211 the statistical properties @xmath26-families of our models of evolution with selection differ from those of the poisson - dirichlet distribution .",
    "in this paper we have seen that , for a family of simple models of evolution under selection , the statistics of the genalogies are modified when conditioning on the speed of evolution ( [ beta ] ) .",
    "for one particular version of these models , the exponential model , the trees can be generated by a coalescent with modified rates ( [ qbeta ] ) .",
    "numerical simulations ( figures  [ fig : t3 ] and  [ fig : t4 ] ) and a phenomenological theory ( section  [ sec : phenom ] ) indicate a similar behavior of more generic versions of the model .    despite their simplicity",
    ", there is not yet a full theoretical understanding of the models of evolution with selection we consider here .",
    "the introduction of the bias opens new questions which would be interesting to consider .",
    "for exemple , what is the effect of the bias on the steady state density profile of the population along the fitness axis , or on the distances between the rightmost points in the population ?",
    "numerically , the monte - carlo approach we developed here should give a rather powerful tool to study these questions accurately and to test more precisely the phenomenological theory developped in @xcite .",
