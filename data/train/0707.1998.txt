    "core - collapse supernovae ( sn ) provide us with an interesting laboratory for studying both neutrino properties and their interplay with astrophysical processes ( see @xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "mikheev - smirnov - wolfenstein ( msw ) effects induced on neutrinos by background matter @xcite have been widely studied as a tool to probe both neutrino masses and mixings and the sn dynamics .",
    "recent examples include the characterization , at the level of observable sn neutrino event spectra , of shock - wave evolution effects after bounce  @xcite and of it possible `` erasing '' by stochastic matter fluctuations induced by turbulence  @xcite .",
    "ordinary msw effects ( and their `` stochastic '' smearing , if any ) typically occur when @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the vacuum oscillation frequency ( in terms of the neutrino energy @xmath7 and squared mass difference @xmath8 ) , where @xmath9 .",
    "the only relevant mixing angle is then @xmath4 , governing the oscillation amplitude in the channels @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( @xmath12 or @xmath13 ) . ] while @xmath14 is the @xmath2-@xmath15 interaction energy difference in matter , @xmath16 being the net electron number density at the point @xmath17 . for typical shock - wave density profiles",
    "as used , e.g. , in @xcite , the condition @xmath5 occurs after a few hundred ( or even a few thousand ) kilometers , during the first few seconds after core bounce .",
    "significantly shallower electron density profiles ( as those adopted in @xcite in the context of models with successful @xmath17-process nucleosynthesis ) can instead trigger msw effects much earlier , around @xmath18  km .    besides electrons",
    ", neutrinos can also be a nontrivial background to themselves when their density is large enough @xcite .",
    "self - interaction effects , being inherently non - linear , are very different ( and much less intuitive ) than ordinary msw effect , and can lead to collective flavor transition phenomena in which neutrinos ( or antineutrinos ) of any energy behave similarly  @xcite .",
    "the interest of such effects for the neutrino flavor evolution in the dense sn core has long been recognized  @xcite .",
    "roughly speaking , significant self - interaction phenomena are expected when @xmath19 , where @xmath20 \\label{mu}\\ ] ] @xmath21 and @xmath22 being the total effective neutrino ( @xmath23 ) and antineutrino ( @xmath24 ) number density , respectively ( to be precisely defined later ) .    in the most general case ,",
    "systems with dense matter and dense neutrino gases are thus governed by ( at least ) three characteristic frequencies : @xmath25 ( spread over @xmath26 orders of magnitude for typical energy spectra ) ; @xmath27 ( roughly decreasing as the third power of the distance ) ; and @xmath28 ( decreasing as the fourth power of the distance @xcite ) .",
    "neutrino flavor evolution becomes then a complicated multi - scale dynamical problem with a rich phenomenology , which may involve both collective and msw effects , the latter being often assumed ( at least in older literature ) to lead to flavor transitions . in the sn neutrino context , this `` old '' paradigm ( focussing on msw effects ) has dramatically changed after the emergence of dominant collective phenomena ( such as the so - called `` bipolar oscillations '' ) studied in detailed , large - scale computer simulations @xcite as well as in simplified but analytical models @xcite .    the interaction strength between two ( anti)neutrinos is modulated by a factor @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the angle between their intersecting trajectories . if one ignores the spread of @xmath30 , and averages it out along a `` representative '' radial trajectory ( single - angle approximation ) , and",
    "if one also assumes that self - interaction effects do not interfere with the ordinary msw ones , then the following picture appears to emerge in supernovae from analytical considerations .",
    "nothing relevant occurs for normal hierarchy ( @xmath31 ) , while , for inverted mass hierarchy ( @xmath32 ) , any value of @xmath33 ( no matter how small  @xcite ) can trigger collective pair - conversions of the kind @xmath34 within the first @xmath18 km .",
    "then , as recently emphasized in  @xcite , the end of collective effects is marked by a spectral pair - conversion which is complete for @xmath35 s , while for @xmath36 s it occurs only above a characteristic energy set by lepton number conservation . such spectral `` split '' ( or `` stepwise swap '' of flavors ) would then represent an unmistakable signature of self - interaction effects  @xcite .",
    "its robustness needs , however , to be better investigated in increasingly refined sn models including , e.g. , variable neutrino crossing angles @xmath30 ( multi - angle simulations ) , which might induce kinematical decoherence effects , ( `` depolarization '' and `` smearing of oscillations '' ) , which are neither obvious nor entirely clear in the few numerical @xcite and analytical @xcite studies performed so far . in our scenario , it turns out that main results are rather robust when passing from single- to multi - angle simulations .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to explore such `` self - interaction dominated '' scenario in a realistic case characterized by : ( 1 ) an appropriate matter profile , where collective effects fully develop before msw effects ( if any ) ; ( 2 ) continuous , thermal energy spectra with significant neutrino - antineutrino ( and neutrino flavor ) asymmetry , and ( 3 ) numerical simulations in single- and multi - angle cases . in this sense ,",
    "our work is complementary to the simulations in @xcite , where the shallower adopted matter profile allows msw effects to occur within ( not beyond ) the range of collective transitions  which leads to a richer phenomenology , but also to more difficult analyses and much greater numerical challenges . in the terminology of @xcite , we study the scenario with `` thick '' rather than `` thin '' envelope .",
    "the plan of our work is as follows . in section  2",
    "we describe our supernova reference model . in section  3 we set the notation and write the neutrino evolution equations in single - angle approximation . in section  4 and 5",
    "we discuss single - angle analytical and numerical solutions , respectively . in section  5",
    "we tackle multi - angle simulations , and show that the main final effect ( the spectral split ) is robust .",
    "conclusions and perspectives are presented in section  6 .",
    "technical aspects are discussed in the appendix .",
    "our reference model is characterized by the following choices for the initial neutrino energy spectra , the geometry and intensity of neutrino emission , and the matter profile , which govern the distribution of the three basic `` frequencies '' @xmath25 , @xmath28 , and @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "we shall use such choices in the usual , simplified context of pure two - family ( @xmath37 ) evolution @xcite , where @xmath15 represents a single active flavor .",
    "it is worth noticing that , for @xmath38 , this case does not exactly represent the two - family limit ( for @xmath39 of the general three - family case , contrary to the familiar msw effects in sne .",
    "in fact , in the presence of self - interactions , the flavor evolution depends on the absolute effective neutrino densities and , thus , also on the total number of neutrino families ( either two or three ) assumed to share the total luminosity . the full @xmath40 case ( and its proper @xmath41 limit )",
    "will be studied elsewhere .",
    "we assume normalized thermal spectra with different temperatures @xmath42 for @xmath2 , @xmath43 , and @xmath15 ( the latter having the same properties as @xmath44 ) .",
    "more precisely , the initial energy spectra @xmath45 are of the form @xmath46 where @xmath47 .",
    "the average values of @xmath7 and @xmath48 are then : @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 . in numerical calculations",

    "neutrinos are assumed to be half - isotropically emitted above the neutrino - sphere , i.e. , all the outward moving modes are equally occupied as expected from a blackbody emission .",
    "the neutrino number flux @xmath57 per unit energy ( in any direction ) is then given by @xcite @xmath58 where @xmath59 @xmath60 being the neutrino - sphere radius , while @xmath61 is the total emission power for a given neutrino species .",
    "in numerical calculations , we assume reference values @xmath62  km and @xmath63 erg / s for each species @xmath64 , @xmath43 , @xmath15 , @xmath44 .    figure  [ fig1 ] shows the initial neutrino number fluxes per unit energy in arbitrary units ( all fluxes being proportional to @xmath65 through the same normalization constant ) .",
    "notice the significant difference ( asymmetry ) between neutrinos and antineutrinos , and between different neutrino flavors .",
    "however , the @xmath2 and @xmath15 fluxes happen to coincide at an energy @xmath66  mev , while for the @xmath43 and @xmath44 fluxes the equality occurs at @xmath67  mev",

    ".      the bloch equations of motion ( eom ) for each polarization vector @xmath143 read , in single - angle approximation , @xmath144 where the three terms in brackets embed vacuum , matter , and self - interaction effects .",
    "in particular , the third term couples all modes @xmath143 and @xmath129 , and is responsible for collective effects .",
    "the equations conserve each @xmath145 and thus unitarity .",
    "it is understood that @xmath146 , @xmath147 , and @xmath148 , with @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "if the continuous parameter @xmath7 is discretized through a set of @xmath151 points @xmath152 , then a set of @xmath153 coupled , first - order differential equations in @xmath154 is obtained .",
    "the equations are `` stiff , '' namely , their solutions generally involve a fast - changing combination of multi - frequency oscillations , due to the `` precession '' of @xmath143 and @xmath155 around the three terms in brackets .",
    "it is thus amazing that , through appropriate approximations , the resulting dynamics turns out to be understandable in terms of simple phenomena , as discussed below .    in",
    "a frame rotating with angular velocity @xmath156 @xcite , the time derivative acquires an extra operator @xmath157 , which cancels the matter term .",
    "moreover , the @xmath142-component of @xmath143 ( and of any other vector ) are unchanged in such co - rotating frame , and thus the survival probability @xmath158 is also unchanged . only the transverse @xmath159 components of any vector get mixed ,",

    "matter @xmath163 effects thus `` disappear '' in such co - rotating frame , as pointed out in  @xcite , leaving the other terms in the eom formally unchanged : @xmath164 the corresponding eom for integral quantities are : @xmath165 where @xmath166 with initial conditions implying @xmath167      the equation for @xmath168 implies conservation of the scalar @xmath169 corresponding to the conservation of the ( electron ) lepton number , and implying pair conversions of the kind @xmath34 @xcite .    in the special case of ( nearly ) constant neutrino density ( @xmath170 ) ,",
    "another conserved scalar is the average energy per neutrino pair , given by @xmath171 where the first ( second ) term acts as a sort of potential ( kinetic ) energy .    when @xmath17 is sufficiently large to make self - interaction effects vanish ( @xmath172 ) , the kinetic term @xmath173 also vanishes , and the `` ground state '' for @xmath174 would corresponds to the minimization of the potential @xmath175 , i.e. , to @xmath176 and @xmath177 aligned as much as possible with @xmath178 ( in any hierarchy ) , provided that lepton number is also conserved .",
    "since the vectors @xmath179 and @xmath180 always start aligned to @xmath124 , this implies that , in normal hierarchy ( @xmath181 ) they end up in the same position , trivially conserving lepton number ( i.e. , the system starts  and remains  close to the minimum of the potential energy ) .",
    "conversely , in inverted hierarchy ( @xmath182 ) the vectors @xmath179 and @xmath180 start antialigned with @xmath183 ( maximum of the potential ) , and for large @xmath17 they should reverse their direction in order to approach the potential minimum .",
    "reversal can not be complete , however , since it would maximally violate ( invert ) lepton number .",
    "consistent minimization of the potential can be achieved by complete reversal of the smallest vector @xmath177 , and by partial reversal of the largest vector @xmath179 ( note that the excess of neutrinos over antineutrinos leads to @xmath184 ) .",
    "more precisely , only a fraction @xmath185 of @xmath186 , the fraction above a certain critical ( split ) energy @xmath187 , is reversed , while the complementary fraction , @xmath188 , remains unaltered @xcite .",
    "in such final state , the critical energy is fixed by lepton number conservation , i.e. , by @xmath189 with @xmath190 the last two terms having the opposite overall sign in the initial state @xmath191 .",
    "then one gets an implicit equation for @xmath187 , @xmath192 which , in our specific sn model , is solved for @xmath193  mev .",
    "when all collective effects are terminated ( @xmath172 ) , one expects a nearly complete inversion of the polarization vectors for @xmath194 , and thus a `` stepwise swap '' between the @xmath2 and @xmath15 energy spectra .",
    "of course , such reasoning is heuristic , and does not prove that the dynamics allows the system to reach the peculiar final state discussed above .",
    "we refer the reader to  @xcite for explicit solutions constructed in adiabatic approximation ( slowly decreasing @xmath28 ) , which indeed lead to spectral split under rather broad assumptions . on the other hand , such adiabatic solutions",

    "when @xmath28 is large and thus @xmath237 is small , however , the bob spin @xmath239 dominates ( `` fast rotator '' ) , and the pendulum remains precessing in the upward position to conserve angular momentum ( `` sleeping top '' ) @xcite .",
    "this situation ( also dubbed as `` synchronization '' @xcite in the sn neutrino context ) is stable if the dominant ( spin ) kinetic term is larger than the maximum excursion of the potential energy @xcite , namely , @xmath244 for large @xmath245 ( and thus vertically aligned polarization vectors ) , this condition translates into @xmath246 , where @xmath247 in our reference sn model , it is @xmath248    conversely , when @xmath249 , any initial misalignment with the `` vertical axis '' set by @xmath250 ( i.e. , any @xmath33 , no matter how small ) triggers the first fall of the pendulum and its subsequent nutations ( also dubbed as `` bipolar oscillations '' in the sn neutrino context ) .",
    "if @xmath28 were constant , bipolar oscillations would be exactly periodic .",
    "however , the decrease of @xmath28 implies an increase of the pendulum inertia ( @xmath237 ) ; the pendulum never swings back to exactly the same uppermost position , which instead steadily decreases , together with the vertical amplitude of nutations ( roughly @xmath251 @xcite ) .",
    "bipolar oscillations are then expected to vanish when self - interaction and vacuum effects are comparable , and the `` alignment approximation '' breaks down .",
    "more precisely , one may expect this condition to occur when the @xmath28 and @xmath25 terms in the eom of @xmath222 and @xmath198 are of the same size ( @xmath252 ) , implying @xmath253 with @xmath254 in our reference sn model , it is @xmath255    the condition @xmath256 roughly marks the `` end '' of bipolar oscillations and of collective effects , but not yet of all self - interaction effects .",
    "in particular , spectral split effects continue to build up for @xmath257 , and eventually freeze out for @xmath258 .",
    "the reason is that the neutrino spectral split requires a separation of the vector @xmath176 into parts @xmath259 and @xmath260 oppositely evolving in the @xmath142-component . as far as the alignment approximation holds ( and thus bipolar oscillations occur ) , this split can not fully develop , and should therefore be complete somewhat beyond the bipolar range . of course , there is no sharp boundary between the two processes : in the range where @xmath253 , one should observe a smooth vanishing of bipolar oscillations , and a gradual build - up of the spectral split , through the polarization reversal of neutrinos with @xmath194 , with an associated non - conservation of @xmath176 ( and of @xmath222 ) . summarizing , we expect the following sequence of dominant phenomena , where the radial ranges refer to our reference sn model : @xmath261 such ranges are explictly shown in fig .  [ fig2 ] . for numerical purposes , we shall stop our investigations to 200 km in this paper .",

    "matter @xmath27 effects can alter the previous description in two ways : ( 1 ) by anticipating the msw condition @xmath264 within the first @xmath265  km in shallow matter profiles ( not our case ) , thus interfering with collective effects in the same range @xcite;(2 ) by altering the dynamics when the polarization vectors are very close to @xmath124 , which occurs just at the transition between synchronized and bipolar oscillations @xcite .",
    "when the latter transition occurs , matter ( @xmath27 ) and small mixing @xmath266 effects can not be completely co - rotated away , the @xmath141 approximation fails , and the transverse components of @xmath267 ( oscillating with amplitude @xmath118 and frequency @xmath27 ) must be taken into account . in the nontrivial case of inverted hierarchy , it turns out that their general effect is to further stabilize the `` upward '' pendulum position @xcite , elongating the period of ( at least ) the first bipolar swing .",
    "explicit analytic estimates have been presented in @xcite for the symmetric case @xmath268 , by solving the full eom with time - varying @xmath267 and for small deviations around the vertical directions .",
    "if we take these estimates as a reasonable proxy also for our asymmetric case ( @xmath90 ) , we expect that the first bipolar oscillation ( nutation ) should be a factor of @xmath269 longer than the next ones ( which are much less affected by these subtle matter effect , the uppermost pendulum position becoming increasingly tilted for decreasing @xmath28 ) .",
    "the onset of bipolar oscillations is then expected to be somewhat delayed beyond @xmath270  km in our reference sn model , by a time span equivalent to `` a few nutations . ''",

    "<S> non - linear effects on supernova neutrino oscillations , associated with neutrino - neutrino interactions , are known to induce collective flavor transformations near the supernova core for @xmath0 . in scenarios with very shallow electron density profiles , </S>",
    "<S> these transformations have been shown to couple with ordinary matter effects , jointly producing spectral distortions both in normal and inverted hierarchy . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we consider a complementary scenario , characterized by higher electron density , as indicated by shock - wave simulations during a few seconds after bounce . in this case , </S>",
    "<S> early collective flavor transitions are decoupled from later , ordinary matter effects . moreover , such transitions become more amenable to both numerical computations and analytical interpretations in inverted hierarchy , while they basically vanish in normal hierarchy . </S>",
    "<S> we numerically evolve the neutrino density matrix in the region relevant for self - interaction effects , using thermal spectra and a representative value @xmath1 . in the approximation of averaged intersection angle between neutrino trajectories , </S>",
    "<S> our simulations neatly show the collective phenomena of synchronization , bipolar oscillations , and spectral split , with analytically understandable features , as recently discussed in the literature . in the more realistic ( but computationally demanding ) case of non - averaged neutrino trajectories </S>",
    "<S> , our simulations do not show new significant qualitative features , apart from the smearing of `` fine structures '' such as bipolar nutations . </S>",
    "<S> our results seem to suggest that , at least for non - shallow matter density profiles , averaging over neutrino trajectories plays a minor role in the final outcome . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , the swap of @xmath2 and @xmath3 spectra above a critical energy may represent an unmistakable signature of the inverted neutrino hierarchy , especially for @xmath4 small enough to render further ( ordinary or even turbulent ) matter effects irrelevant .    to </S>"
