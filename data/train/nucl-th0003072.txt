    "in a previous paper we developed a relativistic plane wave model for studying medium modifications of the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction via complete sets of spin observables for quasielastic @xmath4 and @xmath1 scattering @xcite .",
    "a systematic survey of the predictive power of the latter model compared to experimental data will be presented in this paper .",
    "the main aspect of our model is the use of a general lorentz invariant representation of the nn scattering matrix referred to as the ia2 representation .",
    "this complete expansion of the interaction matrix contains 44 independent invariant amplitudes consistent with parity and time - reversal invariance as well as charge symmetry together with the on - mass - shell condition for the external nucleons @xcite .",
    "five of the 44 amplitudes are determined from free nn scattering data and are therefore identical to the amplitudes employed in the previously - used five - term parameterization of the nn scattering matrix referred to as the ia1 representation .",
    "the remaining 39 amplitudes may be obtained via solution of the bethe - salpeter equation employing a one - boson exchange model ( with pseudovector pion - nucleon coupling ) for the nn interaction @xcite .",
    "the use of a complete set of nn amplitudes eliminates ambiguities inherent in the ia1 representation .",
    "the effect of the nuclear medium on the scattering wave functions is incorporated by replacing free nucleon masses in the dirac spinors with smaller effective projectile and target nucleon masses within the context of the relativistic mean field approximation of serot and walecka @xcite .",
    "experimental data on quasielastic spin observables suggest that nuclear shell effects are unimportant , and hence the target nucleus is treated as a non - interacting fermi gas .",
    "one of the great triumphs of dirac phenomenology has been the successful prediction of the analyzing power for quasielastic @xmath5 scattering at 500 mev based on the ia1 representation of the nn interaction within the framework of a simple relativistic plane wave model @xcite .",
    "the latter success is achieved by replacing free nucleon masses with effective nucleon masses in the dirac spinors , thus enhancing the lower components of the dirac spinors and resulting in a reduction of the analyzing power relative to the value for free scattering : this reduction has been called a `` relativistic signature '' since no mechanism has been found for its explanation within the framework of the conventional nonrelativistic schrdinger equation . despite the successful prediction of the analyzing power , however , the relativistic ia1-based model yields inconsistencies in the sense that quasielastic @xmath6 and @xmath7 spin observables prefer different five - term representations of the nn scattering matrix .",
    "as already explained , a more rigorous and unambiguous approach must be based on the ia2 representation of the scattering matrix within the relativistic plane wave impulse approximation . in ref .",
    "@xcite we showed that the inclusion of effective masses within the ia2 representation fails to reproduce the large quenching effect predicted by the ia1 representation for the @xmath5 analyzing power at 500 mev .",
    "hence , we concluded that any large deviations of spin observables relative to the corresponding free values are merely artifacts of using an incorrect ia1 representation of the nn scattering matrix , and consequently other effects , such as distortions and multiple scattering , should be considered as possible candidates for reproducing the 500 mev analyzing power within the ia2 representation .",
    "the question now arises as to how ia2-based predictions compare to data at energies lower than 500 mev for a range of scattering angles , and how do they compare to the corresponding ia1-based predictions . in principle",
    "all calculations should be based on the more rigorous ia2 representation , however , for comparison to previous predictions , the ia1-based calculations are included . in addressing the above questions , we attempt to fully understand the role of effective - mass - type medium effects on spin observables before attempting to incorporate additional effects into our relativistic model .",
    "the aim of this paper , therefore , is to perform a systematic study of the predictive power of ia2-based model compared to the published quasielastic polarization data listed in table [ studied_reactions ] .",
    "the following questions will also be addressed :    * how successful is the effective mass concept , inherent to dirac phenomenology , in describing quasielastic @xmath8 and @xmath9 scattering data ? * how do numerical results based on the ia2 representation of the nn scattering matrix compare to those utilizing the incomplete ( and therefore ambiguous ) ia1 representation ?    in sec .",
    "[ section_ia1_versus_ia2_at_qep ] the sensitivity of complete sets of quasielastic @xmath8 and @xmath9 spin observables is investigated with respect to a range of different effective projectile and target nucleon masses for both ia1- and ia2-based models .",
    "in addition , calculations based on optimal combinations of effective projectile and target nucleon masses are also compared to spin observable data at the centroid of the quasielastic peak .",
    "our main conclusions are presented in sec .",
    "[ section_conclusions ] .",
    "in ref . @xcite it was shown that an ia2-based prediction fails to reproduce the @xmath2ca@xmath6 analyzing power at an incident energy of 500 mev . in order to give an initial feeling for the predictive power of our model , the latter reference employed values of the effective nucleon masses which were theoretically extracted by hillhouse and de kock @xcite .",
    "however , the question arises as to whether other combinations of physically acceptable effective projectile and target nucleon masses exist , which provide a better description of the analyzing power .",
    "furthermore , one can also ask whether the latter combination still provides a good description of all the other spin observables , and if not , whether one can find a combination of physically acceptable effective masses which reproduce a complete set of spin observables .",
    "table [ studied_reactions ] lists all the reactions for which calculations are done . in this paper",

    "the reaction @xmath2ca@xmath7 at @xmath10 mev is included since data exist at two different laboratory scattering angles and furthermore it is complementary to the reaction @xmath2ca@xmath8 at @xmath14 mev .",
    "the @xmath8 data at @xmath11 mev are complementary to the @xmath7 data at @xmath11 mev and are therefore also included .      to answer the above questions",
    ", we introduce the concept of an effective mass band in this section , which serves to demonstrate the sensitivity of spin observables to different combinations of effective masses for projectile and target nucleons for both ia1- and ia2-based models . in principle",
    "the effective masses can be calculated theoretically following a procedure similar to that outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite , however , the effective masses are now considered as free parameters which are varied , in step sizes of 0.01 , over the following range of physically acceptable values : @xmath15 @xmath16 denotes the free nucleon mass , and @xmath17 and @xmath18 the effective projectile and target nucleon masses respectively .",
    "the lower limit of 0.50 corresponds to the effective nucleon mass in infinite nuclear matter @xcite . for the purpose of this exercise we focus on values of the spin observables at an excitation energy corresponding to the centroid of the quasielastic peak in the unpolarized inclusive excitation spectrum . for different laboratory scattering angles empirical data for quasielastic spin observables",
    "are relatively constant as a function of nuclear excitation energy at the momentum transfers of interest ( @xmath19 fm @xmath20 ) .",
    "hence the trends displayed by observables at the quasielastic peak will be representative of the behavior of spin observables as a function of the energy transferred to the nucleus .",

    "even though the ia2 treatment of medium effects ( within the rpwia framework ) is the most advanced to date , it still fails to describe all observables ; the glaring example being the prediction of @xmath12 for @xmath6 scattering as the energy is lowered from 500 mev to 200 mev . in general",
    "it is seen that ia2-based effective - mass predictions are close to the corresponding free values , whereas the ambiguous ia1 representation severely overestimates the importance of effective - mass - type medium effects . despite the successes of the walecka model effective mass concept within the relativistic plane wave impulse approximation ,",
