    "a realistic model for the transition to turbulence and for the mechanisms of turbulent energy dissipation , requires not only an accurate control of the fluid equations but also a consideration of the effect of different boundary conditions and of the external forces .",
    "nevertheless , as in other fields of physics , a step towards the understanding and control of the phenomena is the identification of the universal mechanisms which are always present , independently of the particular system or the boundary conditions .",
    "one such mechanism is associated to the role of coherent structures in the generation of turbulent energy .",
    "flow visualization techniques@xcite @xcite @xcite , as well as two - point correlation measurements@xcite , have revealed that a large amount of the near wall turbulent energy is associated to coherent structures ( streamwise rolls and streaks ) and to their breakdown ( bursts ) .",
    "of particular importance for the shear stress peaks at the wall , that are associated to the bursting events , is the transfer of fast moving fluid to the near wall region ( sweeps ) and the transfer of energy to small turbulence scales at a rate faster than the normal kolmogoroff cascade .",
    "understanding and modeling these phenomena is of practical importance because , stabilizing or delaying the evolution of the coherent structures , might decrease the energy dissipation rate . for this purpose , in sect .",
    "2 , a set of simplified boundary layer equations is developed , which provides a good degree of analytical control over the coherent structure solutions . from the approximate equations and their solutions , the generation and lifting effect of the rolls - plus - streaks instability",
    "is clearly understood as well as its streamwise localized nature .",
    "another mechanism of critical importance , in the development of turbulence , is the transfer of energy from the large to the small scales .",
    "the rate of transfer may be also be affected by the time scale of destabilization of the coherent structures .",
    "the transfer of energy between different length scales is favored by the establishment of precise phase relations between the dynamical evolution of the intervening scales .",
    "this led several authors@xcite @xcite to suggest that randomizing the phases might have a strong effect either on blocking the cascade of energy transfer or on destabilizing some structures . in sect.3",
    "the effect of random phases is studied , first in the shell model and then in the boundary layer equations .",
    "the study of these two cases puts into evidence the reasons and conditions for effectiveness of random phase control techniques . in the shell model ,",
    "phase randomization of almost any mode , has an effective blocking effect on the energy transfer to the small scales .",
    "however , in the boundary layer equations , the effect is not so striking and is only observed if the phases that are randomized are those of some particular modes .",
    "the reason for this different behavior is the local ( in momentum space ) nature of the interactions in the shell model as opposed to the long - range mode interactions in the boundary layer equations .",
    "the conclusion is that for boundary layer turbulence control , phase randomization is effective only if a fine tuning of the phase - randomized modes is done .",
    "when the phase randomization is implemented by boundary conditions ( artificial roughness , for example ) the need for a fine tuning of the randomized modes may hinder the applicability of the method .    finally , in sect.4 , the prospects for active control of the coherent structures by external body forces is considered . here again , the fact that simplified boundary layer equations are used , provides a clear view of the relevant dynamical mechanisms .",
    "feasible control signals are derivatives at the wall and external forces can not be designed with complex wall - normal dependencies .",
    "taking these two facts into account the conclusion is that control by external body forces has almost no effect on the development , growth and break - up of the coherent structures .",
    "therefore the turbulence production rate is not significantly changed . however , by controlling a small layer of non - active fluid near the wall , a reduction in skin friction drag might be obtained .",
    "numerical simulations@xcite and a detailed analysis of the flow equations@xcite have uncovered a possible self - sustained mechanism for the coherent structures in the wall region .",
    "let @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 be the streamwise , the wall normal and the spanwise coordinates .",
    "the process starts from counter - rotating streamwise rolls which would decouple from the streamwise velocity component if the flow were independent of @xmath0 .",
    "however the rolls redistribute the momentum , creating fluctuations in the streamwise velocity ( streaks ) .",
    "the spanwise inflections create an instability of the streaks and this in turn leads to a nonlinear energizing of the original streamwise rolls .",
    "it is probable that this self - sustaining scheme , discussed by waleffe@xcite for a sinusoidal wall - bounded shear flow , captures the correct physical process .",
    "however , because of its fragmented mathematical description , it is difficult to use it as a basis for quantitative predictions and , for example , for the evaluation of effective control mechanisms",
    ". it would be better to obtain a single solution of the flow equations comprising all the effects ( rolls , streaks and instability growth ) .",
    "for the full navier - stokes equations such solution does not seem easy to obtain .",
    "however , for the simplified boundary layer equations , the problem is not so hard and the mechanism may be made more explicit .",
    "in particular it will be seen why it is essential to take the @xmath3dependence into account from the start .",
    "the starting point is the navier - stokes equation for an incompressible fluid @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the body force which , in the case of an ionized fluid@xcite , for example , is @xmath6 with the continuity equation @xmath7 @xmath8 being the mass density , @xmath9 the electric charge density and @xmath10 the kinematic viscosity .    in orthogonal curvilinear coordinates ,",
    "denote by @xmath11 the streamwise , the wall - normal and the spanwise components of the physical velocity field @xmath12 .",
    "consider reference quantities , of the order of typical physical parameters , and change to non - dimensional variables @xmath13 typical values for the reference quantities are    @xmath14 m s@xmath15 , @xmath16 m , @xmath17 m , @xmath18 kg m@xmath19 , @xmath20 v cm@xmath15 , @xmath22 @xmath23c cm@xmath19 , @xmath25 m@xmath26 s@xmath15 . then r@xmath27 and @xmath28 and @xmath29 are small quantities .    expressing ( [ 2.1 ] ) in the non - dimensional variables ( [ 2.3 ] ) , assuming the product @xmath30 ( airfoil curvature @xmath31 boundary layer width ) to be small and neglecting terms of order @xmath32 , @xmath33 ( and @xmath34 ) one obtains @xmath35 with @xmath36 @xmath37 and , for the ionized fluid case , @xmath38 ; @xmath39 ; @xmath40    split the variables into steady state ( @xmath41 ) and fluctuating components ( @xmath42 ) @xmath43 experimentally a sequence roll - streak - burst is a localized event in some small region of the boundary layer .",
    "therefore it is reasonable to use , for the discussion of the coherent structures in that region , a quasiparallel assumption for the steady - state solution , namely @xmath44 for example , for a scaling solution @xcite @xmath45 with @xmath46  and @xmath47    by differentiation of eqs.([2.4 ] ) the pressure terms may be eliminated .",
    "then , keeping only the linear terms in the fluctuating fields one obtains @xmath48 where @xmath49 are the fluctuating components of an eventual controlling force . without active control @xmath50 .",
    "* solutions of ( [ 2.5 ] ) ( with * @xmath51 * * ) * *    let @xmath52 with @xmath53 and boundary conditions @xmath54 @xmath55 being a wall - normal size for the coherent structure , of the order of the boundary layer width",
    ". the qualitative nature of the solution does not depend much on the form that one assumes for the steady - state solution . in the following",
    "one considers an exponential profile .",
    "@xmath56    similar results are obtained , for example , for a linear profile    # * zero - order solution * ( to be used as an initial condition for the full solution ) :    if @xmath57 is replaced by its average value @xmath58 in the boundary layer @xmath59 one would obtain @xmath60 with @xmath61 and @xmath62 this implies that for the solution to grow in time it must decrease in @xmath3space , namely @xmath63 that is , the rolls - plus - streaks instability leads to a localized turbulence spot and @xmath0-dependence is seen to be an essential ingredient to have a sustained structure .",
    "the @xmath64 and @xmath65 structure of this averaged - profile solution are shown in fig.1a , b .",
    "this approximate solution is now used as initial condition for the solutions of eqs.([2.5 ] ) .",
    "reintroducing the @xmath1-dependence of @xmath57 , using the continuity equation and ( [ 2.5 ] ) and integrating once in @xmath1 @xmath66 in sect.4 , in the discussion of active control by external body forces , these equations will be handled in a direct way .",
    "here however , a fourier mode expansion is used , which will be convenient for the phase randomization discussion of sect.3 .",
    "let @xmath67 with @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "then @xmath71 and @xmath72 for the @xmath73 initial condition use @xmath74 and the boundary conditions are @xmath75",
    ". the evolution of @xmath76 and @xmath77 ( for @xmath78 ) is obtained from ( [ 2.14 ] ) and @xmath79 and @xmath80 are fixed by the boundary conditions .",
    "the allowed time - dependence of @xmath81 and @xmath82 insures the consistency of the process .",
    "the absolute value of the coefficients in eq.([2.13 ] ) obtained after @xmath83 time steps is shown in fig.2 for the parameters ( @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 ) .",
    "fig.3 shows the @xmath87structure of this solution .",
    "one sees that , starting from the symmetric initial condition in fig.1a , as time develops , the energy of the structure moves away from the wall .",
    "even eq.([2.10 ] ) , although obtained for the averaged - profile solution , already suggests a rate of growth increasing with the local streamwise velocity .",
    "this behavior of the obtained solution matches the experimental fact that unstable streaks lift away from the wall .",
    "the solution , just studied , is sufficiently simple and well under control to serve as a basis for the study of control methods . in the following section",
    "the effect of random phases in this and other models is discussed and sect.4 reports on the perspectives for active control by external forces .",
    "turbulence generation implies a transfer of energy between structures at different length scales . any mechanism that interferes with this energy transfer may have a controlling effect on the rate of turbulence production .",
    "a mechanism of this kind was put in evidence in ref.@xcite . using a spectral code for a direct numerical simulation of a turbulent flow , it was found that randomization of the phases of some of the fourier modes have a strong effect on turbulence and leads to drag reduction .",
    "drag reduction was also obtained on a recent experiment@xcite of flow over a surface with a random arrangement of protrusions .",
    "these effects have been interpreted as originating from the destruction by the phase randomization of the coherence of the large - scale turbulence producing structures .",
    "interfering with the formation of rolls and plane waves , random phases ( or random roughness ) would delay turbulence production and bursting .",
    "another important effect that is associated to phase randomization is the blocking of energy transfer to the small scales of turbulence .",
    "this is the phenomenon that will be analyzed in this section , first in the context of the shell model and then for the boundary layer equations .",
    "the shell model is a toy model for the turbulence cascade",
    ". it may not be directly relevant for the turbulence generating phenomena in the boundary layer , nevertheless its study provides a good insight on the mechanisms of energy transfer between length scales .",
    "let @xmath88 be the fourier modes of a velocity field .",
    "then , the gledzer - yamada - ohkitani@xcite @xcite shell model is defined by the equation    @xmath89    the energy equation is @xmath90    to study the effect of random phases in the shell model , the numerical scheme used is the same as in ref.@xcite , namely @xmath91 @xmath92 with @xmath93 @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97    the system is driven at mode 4 and the other modes are energized by a cascade of energy transfer .",
    "the simulations start from a point in the attractor , the mode energy @xmath98 being the average over @xmath99 time steps .",
    "the average mode energy in the attractor is shown in fig.4 .",
    "it scales with a power law @xmath100 in the inertial region .",
    "now , starting from a point in the attractor one lets the system evolve for a time @xmath101 but , at each step , the phase of one or several of the modes is randomized .",
    "the results are shown in figs.5a - c .",
    "for fig.5a different random phases are given to the modes 10 , 11 and 12 .",
    "for fig.5b only the phase of mode 11 is randomized . for fig.5c",
    "the same random phase is given to the modes 10 , 11 and 12 .",
    "in all cases one observes a strong blocking effect in the energy flow to the small scales , stronger when several phases are randomized but also quite large when only the phase of mode 11 is randomized .",
    "by contrast if , instead of random phases , one applies a small random excitation to an intermediate mode almost no effect is observed .    in this model",
    "the blocking of energy transfer by random phases has a simple interpretation . the energy flow through mode @xmath102 is @xmath103    if @xmath104 is multiplied by a random phase @xmath105 not correlated with @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 , then @xmath109 and there is no energy flow through mode @xmath102 .",
    "one also sees , from eq.([3.5 ] ) , that the possibility of blocking the energy transfer to the small scales depends critically on the local nature of the energy flow .",
    "namely , the fact that only a few neighboring modes are involved in the energy transfer .",
    "that means that any random phase , on any mode whatsoever , will have a blocking effect . as it will be seen later , the situation in the boundary layer equations is quite different",
    ".      for the boundary layer case one evolves eqs.([2.14 ] ) , starting from the same initial conditions and for the same number of time steps as in sect.2 .",
    "fig.6 shows the result when the phase of the @xmath110 component is randomized at each step . in this case one",
    "obtains a sizable suppression of the energy transfer to the higher modes .",
    "however , for the simulation parameters that were used ( @xmath111 ) , randomizing the phase of mode 1 is the only case where any appreciable effect is observed . randomizing the phases of the higher modes",
    "does not seem to block the energy transfer .",
    "this phenomenon may be understood from the eqs.([2.14 ] ) .",
    "first , and unlike the shell model , the nature of the transfer function @xmath112 implies that there are long - range effects , each mode receiving contributions from all the others . on",
    "the other hand one sees from the diagonal terms in eqs.([2.14 ] ) that , for each set of parameters , there is a number of intrinsically growing modes up to some @xmath113 , with the other modes receiving energy from these unstable modes by the transfer function @xmath114 .",
    "it so happens that , for the simulation parameters that were used , mode 1 is the unstable mode and only if one acts on this mode does one obtain some effect .    in view of these two phenomena ( the long - range interaction and the stable versus unstable mode effect )",
    "the method of random phases will be effective , in the control of the structures , only if it is carefully designed to act on all the unstable modes .",
    "it must be designed in a case - by - case basis and might become ineffective when the kinematical parameters change .",
    "here one analyses the effect of external forces ( the @xmath115 in eq.([2.5 ] ) ) on the growth and eventual stabilization of the coherent structures in the boundary layer equations .",
    "the aim is to find out whether an active control scheme may be developed using this type of forces . if effective control is to be achieved , it is the dominant dynamical effects that have to be addressed",
    ". therefore it makes sense to use a setting as simple as possible to be able to isolate and interpret the most basic effects .",
    "in particular , one may assume that outside the boundary layer region there is a uniform constant pressure without fluctuations .",
    "then , if @xmath116 , the second equation in ( [ 2.4 ] ) implies @xmath117 and therefore , from uniformity , also @xmath118 . in this case",
    "the pressure terms may be dropped .",
    "using now the information obtained in sect.2 , namely the fact that growing coherent structures must be localized in the @xmath3variable , one writes @xmath119 and the linearized fluctuation equations become @xmath120 notice that the linearized equations do not fix the @xmath121dependence .    as",
    "before , consider an exponential profile for the steady - state flow @xmath122 eqs.([4.2 ] ) are simple enough to even allow explicit analytical solutions . for example the second equation in ( [ 4.2 ] ) reduces after a change of variable to the modified bessel equation .",
    "however , better insight is obtained by displaying its numerical solution , starting from different sets of initial conditions .",
    "for example , starting from an initial condition @xmath123 , @xmath124 and @xmath125 ( fig.7a ) , as in sect.2 , one finds once more that time evolution lifts this structure away from the wall ( fig.7b ) .    to control",
    "this structure would mean to damp it or at least to avoid its instability , growth and lifting away from the wall .",
    "instability of the structure generates small scale turbulence . on the other hand when the structure lifts away from the wall one sees a clear growth of the @xmath126component which is the mathematical equivalent of an ejection or a sweep .",
    "this exchange of boundary layer fluid with the external fast moving fluid increases the skin friction drag .",
    "mathematically it would be very simple to invent forcing terms @xmath127 and @xmath128 which stabilize or damp the structures .",
    "for example , forces proportional to the second derivative @xmath129 would be equivalent to a change of the viscosity coefficient .",
    "however it is not realistic to assume that forces with the appropriate @xmath130dependence may be obtained , nor it is in general possible to detect the corresponding @xmath130variation of the fluctuating flow components . at",
    "most one may apply a force that is essentially constant throughout the boundary layer and the signal to be detected might be the value of the derivative at @xmath131 of the velocity fluctuations . in fig.7c the result of a control experiment of this type is displayed . at each time step the derivatives @xmath132 and @xmath133 are detected and a force is applied to the fluid near the wall that is proportional to the difference between this derivative and the corresponding derivative of the initial condition .",
    "that is , the control tends to preserve the derivative at the wall .",
    "the range of the force that is applied is the same as the range of the boundary condition ( a unit interval ) .",
    "one sees that the control maintains the circulation in the wall region but does not avoid the lifting of the structure .",
    "actually a linear control , as used , has an overshooting effect because , as the structure lifts away from the wall , the derivative naturally decreases and the control , that at first counters the sweep in the @xmath126component , later causes an ejection .",
    "instead of trying to stabilize a formed roll - streak structure one might instead apply a force to kill the derivatives at the wall . in figs.8a , b one shows the results of such an experiment . starting from a small random non - zero initial condition in the interval @xmath134 $ ] , a lifted structure develops ( fig.8a ) which is qualitatively similar to those obtained from roll - streak initial conditions .",
    "applying a controlling force proportional to the derivatives at @xmath131 , one obtains the result shown in fig.8b .",
    "one sees that away from the wall the lifted structure is similar in the controlled and non - controlled cases .",
    "the difference is the vanishing of the derivatives at the wall in the controlled case .",
    "the conclusion is that , with detection of the wall derivatives and an applied force in the boundary layer region , the effect over the development , growth and eventual break - up of the coherent structures is minimal .",
    "the only non - negligible effect that can be achieved is that , by suppressing the wall derivatives , all this activity is kept away from a small near - wall region . in practical terms , the conclusion is that not much effect is be expected in the turbulence production rate .",
    "however , by keeping a non - active small layer at the wall , a reduction in the skin friction drag might be obtained .",
    "the effect is similar to one of the interpretations of a riblet structure , namely that of keeping a region of non - active fluid inside the grooves .",
    "the difference is that here no penalty would be paid for an increased contact surface .",
    "isolating the dominating terms in the near - wall flow equations , some understanding of the turbulence - generating structures is obtained . also , the simplified equations make a clear distinction between what is important and what it is not , for the flow control action .",
    "phase randomness ( introduced by surface effects , for example ) which may be very striking in particular models and for some kinematical regions , seems to lack general validity and to require fine tuning of the phases that are to be randomized .    active control by external body forces ,",
    "reacting to the measurement of the surface derivatives , have only a limited effect on the development , growth and break - up of the coherent structures .",
    "therefore the turbulence production rate is not significantly changed . however , by controlling a small layer of non - active fluid near the wall , a reduction in the skin friction drag may be obtained .",
    "the type of externally controlled body forces that have been proposed in the past@xcite @xcite may be obtained by injecting ionized fluid ( the same or another easier to ionize fluid ) in the boundary layer and acting on it by electromagnetic forces . in this",
    "setting , static fields already have an effect on the flow profile@xcite .",
    "however to act on the turbulence - generating structures active control is required .",
    "special attention has to be paid to the fact that , although the control acts on the bulk of the boundary layer , the detection of the signals is only realistic at the wall . surface stress being directly related to wall - normal velocity derivatives , this seems to be the most appropriate parameter on which to base active control .",
    "detection of field fluctuations , in an ionized fluid , would be an interesting possibility , but it seems a more remote possibility from a practical point of view ."
