    "recently , nonlinear stochastic systems with noise terms have attracted extensive investigations .",
    "the concept of noise - induced transition has got wide applications in the field of physics , chemistry and biology @xcite@xcite@xcite . in most of these theories",
    "the noise affects the dynamics through system variable , i.e. , the noise is multiplication in nature@xcite .",
    "the focal theme of these investigations is steady state properties of systems in which fluctuations , generally applied from outside , are considered independent of the system s characteristic dissipation .",
    "these studies consider only one type of fluctuations that affect system s parameters , i.e. , they drive multiplicatively .",
    "however , fluctuations due to some extrinsic factors affect the system directly , i.e. , they drive system dynamics additively . since two types of fluctuations have the common origin , they correlated with each other in the relevant timescale of the problem@xcite . on the level of a langevin - type description of a dynamical system ,",
    "the presence of correlation between noise can change the dynamics of the system@xcite@xcite .",
    "correlated noise processes have found applications in a broad range of studies such as steady state properties of a single mode laser @xcite , bistable kinetics@xcite , directed motion in spatially symmetric periodic potentials@xcite , stochastic resonance in linear systems@xcite , and steady state entropy production@xcite . in this paper",
    "we study the genotype selection model in presences of the correlated noise and discuss how noise correlation can break the balance of the gene selection and induce the phase transition .",
    "we select a haploid group as our object and suppose that each haploid may have gene @xmath3 or gene @xmath4@xcite .",
    "the number of gene @xmath3 haploid , gene @xmath4 haploid and the total are @xmath5,@xmath6 and @xmath7,respectively .",
    "because the total number is constant ( @xmath8=constant ) , we can make a transform as follow : + @xmath9 @xmath10 is the ratio of gene @xmath3 number to the total number .",
    "if gene @xmath3 haploid and gene @xmath4 haploid may have a mutation ( @xmath11 or @xmath12 ) during the process of the heredity and the ratio of @xmath11 and @xmath13 are @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively , we can get the following difference equation : + @xmath16\\ ] ] on the other hand , on account of self - sow each gene haploid has its rebirth rate : @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 is selection gene and @xmath20 is time gap between border generations . from eq.(1 ) and eq.(3 ) we can get : @xmath21   } { 1-\\frac{s_{t}}{2}+s_{t}x(t)}.\\ ] ] considering eq.(2 ) and eq.(4 ) together we can get the differential equation of @xmath22 at the case of @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath24 where @xmath25 .",
    "in order to simplify the equation , we suppose @xmath26 .",
    "so the simplified gene selection dynamic equation is shown as following @xcite @xmath27 now if due to some environmental external disturbance the gene selection rate of the haploid , it is likely to affect both @xmath28 and @xmath29 in the form of additive and multiplicatively noises that are connected through a correlation parameter . in other words",
    "the external fluctuations affect the parameter @xmath29 which fluctuates around a mean value , thus generating multiplicative noise and at the same time environmental fluctuations perturbs the dynamics directly which gives rise to additive noise .",
    "so we have + @xmath30 where @xmath31 are gaussian white noises with the following properties .",
    "@xmath32    @xmath33    @xmath34    @xmath35    where @xmath36 are the strength of noise @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "@xmath39 denotes the degree of correlation between noises @xmath37 and @xmath38 with @xmath40 .",
    "we can derive the corresponding fokker - planck equation for evolution of steady probability distribution function ( spdf)based on eq.(7)-eq.(11 ) .",
    "the equation is shown as follow .",
    "+ @xmath41 where @xmath42 @xmath43^{2}+2\\lambda\\sqrt{d\\alpha}x(1-x)+\\alpha.\\ ] ] the steady probability distribution of fokker - planck equation is given by @xcite @xmath44\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the normalization constant , using the forms of @xmath46 and @xmath47 we have the following integral forms of the spdf of eq.(12)@xcite .",
    "@xmath48^{2}+2\\lambda\\sqrt{d\\alpha}(x - x^{2})+\\alpha } } \\exp[\\int^{x}\\frac{[\\beta - x^{'}+\\mu ( x^{'}-{x^{'}}^{2})]dx^ { ' } } { d(x^{'}-{x^{'}}^{2})^{2}+2\\lambda\\sqrt{d\\alpha}(x^{'}-{x^{'}}^{2})+\\alpha}]\\ ] ] now we will give a numerical analysis for eq . ( 16 ) and the results will be presented as fig . 1-fig .",
    "4 .    [ fig1 ]    in the fig.1 , we study the effect of the selection rate @xmath29 on spdf . when the selection rate is zero ( @xmath49 ) , the curve is symmetry .",
    "it is said that gene @xmath3 haploid ( @xmath10 ) and gene @xmath4 haploid ( @xmath50 ) have the same probability distribution .",
    "if the selection rate get a negative value the peak of the curve is biased to the left .",
    "it is evident that the selection is unfair which is propitious to gene @xmath4 haploid . on the other hand ,",
    "the selection is propitious to gene @xmath3 in case of @xmath51 . in order to study the effect of the noise on the system",
    "easily we adopt the symmetrical case for the following discussion .",
    "+    [ fig2 ]    in fig.(2 ) we show the effect of multiplicative noise on spdf . for a small value of @xmath52",
    "the curve shows a single peak ( at @xmath53 ) region which indicates that environmental selection gives the same chance to both gene @xmath3 haploid and gene @xmath4 haploid and it is not easy for us to select one type haploid from the group . as the value of @xmath52 increases , the single peak region vanishes and it evolves a double peak region .",
    "the left peak is near the position @xmath54 while the right one is near the position @xmath55 , which shows that environment selection gives a absolute big chance to one of the two ( gene @xmath3 or gene @xmath4 ) . in this case",
    "it is easy to select one type haploid from the group since the other type haploid number can be neglected with regard to the selected type number . on the other hand , from the fig.2 we can know that the multiplicative noise can induce the phase transition from one peak to double peak .",
    "+    [ fig3 ]    the effect of the additive noise on spdf is shown as fig.3 .",
    "for a small value of @xmath56 the curve represents a single peak region which vanishes for larger value of @xmath56 .",
    "the position of the peak is weakly affected by the strength of @xmath56 , however , its height may be affected intensively by @xmath56 .",
    "it is said that the additive noise can not separate the single peak while it can make the peak disappear as a diffuse term .",
    "+    [ fig4 ]    the curve of the fig.4 shows the effect of correlation parameter on spdf .",
    "when @xmath39 is zero , namely no correlation , the curve gives one peak region whose peak position is at @xmath53 which shows that the selection is fair to both gene @xmath3 haploid and gene @xmath4 haploid .",
    "as the value of @xmath39 increases the peak at @xmath53 vanishes gradually and finally it becomes a concave peak . at the same time , the height of the curve at the both side becomes larger gradually . in others",
    "word , the noise correlation make the probability distribution centralize on both sides ( @xmath54 and @xmath55 ) .",
    "it is evident that the noise correlation make it possible to separate one type haploid from a haploid group .",
    "in this paper , the steady state properties of the gene selection model is investigated in presence of the correlated gaussian white noise .",
    "we study the effect of the white noise on spdf in the symmetrical case .",
    "the multiplicative noise can break the single peak state to the double peak state ( see fig.2 ) , which indicates that the selection in the case is preponderant for one of the two ( gene @xmath3 or gene @xmath4 ) .",
    "the additive noise play a diffusing role in the process , which causes the probabilities distribution to a equal distribution .",
    "the noise correlation can also break the symmetry of @xmath3@xmath4 , which induces the especial gene haploid to be selected .",
    "+ from the above , it is found that the noise can change the nature selection from a equal probability selection to a differential probability one , which benefits us to select one type haploid from the haploid group .",
    "the breaking of the symmetry and the especial gene selection are very important to produce of gene order and biology evolution . + on the other hand , the stochastic force can induce the phase transition in our system .",
    "this viewpoint is completely novel as the traditional viewpoint thinks the stochastic force disturbs the phase transition .",
