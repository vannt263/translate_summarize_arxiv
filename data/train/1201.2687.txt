    "the recent years have witnessed a rapid rise in the number of known planetary mass objects , @xmath5 , in the galaxy .",
    "searches for exoplanets from radial velocities find that @xmath6 of gk dwarf stars have planets greater than the mass of neptune within periods @xmath7 days  @xcite .",
    "transiting searches find that @xmath8 of main sequence dwarfs are orbited by short - period planets at less than four earth - radii  @xcite . direct imaging and microlensing have also now started to uncover planets bound to host stars  @xcite .",
    "much less is known about the population of @xmath5 objects that are not bound to a host star .",
    "several candidate unbound objects have been imaged in star clusters with mass possibly as small as a few times that of jupiter , @xmath9 ( e.g.  ) .",
    "however , the origin of these objects is uncertain ; they may have formed directly in the collapse of the molecular cloud  @xcite , or have been ejected from their birthplace around a host star via a dynamical interaction  @xcite .",
    "free - floating objects at the jupiter mass and below have been difficult to find via these methods .",
    "microlensing , however , does provide a way  and perhaps the only way  to detect objects below the deuterium - burning mass limit that are not bound to a host star . in a recent survey of the galactic bulge ,",
    "the moa - ii collaboration  @xcite reported the discovery of planetary - mass objects either very distant from their host star ( @xmath10 au ) or unbound from a host star entirely .",
    "this detection was obtained from analysis of the timescale distribution of the microlensing events , which showed a statistically - significant excess of events with timescale @xmath11 days as compared to a standard galactic model with a stellar mass function cut - off at the low mass end of the brown dwarf regime .",
    "the mass function of this new population of objects can be described ( for illustration ) by a @xmath12-function with a best fit near the jupiter mass .",
    "these results tell the surprising story that objects greater than about the mass of jupiter are approximately twice as numerous as both main sequence stars and planets bound to host stars .",
    "though their existence is established , the origin of these unbound objects is far from clear .",
    "do they form a continuation of the low end brown dwarf mass function near the deuterium burning mass limit , or did they form as a distinct population of objects ejected from their original host stars ? because of their uncertain origin and their present status , we prefer to refer to objects with mass @xmath13 that are not bound to a host star as _ nomads _ ; in the literature they have been also referred to as rogue or free - floating planets .",
    "the name  nomad \" is invoked to include that allusion that there may be an accompanying  flock , \" either in the form of a system of moons  @xcite or in its own ecosystem .",
    "though an interstellar object might seem an especially inhospitable habitat , if one allows for internal radioactive or tectonic heating and the development of a thick atmosphere effective at trapping infrared heat  @xcite , and recognizes that most life on earth is bacterial and highly adaptive , then the idea that interstellar ( and , given the prevalence of debris from major galaxy mergers , intergalactic ) space is a vast ecosystem , exchanging mass through chips from rare direct collisions , is intriguing with obvious implications for the instigation of life on earth .",
    "understanding the bounds on the nomad population , and the prospects for detecting them with microlensing surveys , is the focus of this paper . in particular , what is the number and mass density of nomads in the galaxy ?",
    "what are the bounds on the minimum mass of a nomad , and what is the lightest detectable nomad ? how well can we measure the nomad mass function , and how does this compare to the low mass brown dwarf mass function ? and",
    "can we independently measure the mass function of nomads in the bulge and in the disk ?",
    "we will show that a dedicated space - based survey of the inner galaxy , such as the proposed wide - field infrared survey telescope ( _ wfirst _ ) , will measure the number of nomads per main sequence star greater than the mass of jupiter to @xmath2 , and the corresponding number greater than the mass of mars to @xmath3 .",
    "we also show that large scale galaxy surveys , in particular the _ gaia _ mission and the large synoptic survey telescope ( _ lsst _ ) , will be sensitive to nomads greater than about the mass of jupiter without changing their proposed observing plan . further , the back - to - back 15 second exposures in the planned design of _ lsst _ will allow for limits at least to be placed on nomads near the mass of pluto , @xmath14 . as an extension ,",
    "we suggest that a dedicated drift scanning telescope could identify nomads as small as @xmath4 via microlensing of bright stars with characteristic lightcurve timescales of a few seconds .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [",
    "sec : population ] we estimate the number of nomads in the galaxy . in section  [ sec : event_rate ]",
    "we calculate the event rate of nomads in microlensing surveys . in section  [ sec",
    ": projections ] and section  [ sec : efficiency ] we outline methods for measuring the nomad population and simulating detection efficiencies . in section  [",
    "sec : surveys ] we present the results of these projections . in section  [ sec : drift ] we postulate a survey for short timescale nomads via a drift scanning telescope . in section",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] we summarize our conclusions .",
    "we begin by setting up the model for the nomad population . objects with mass @xmath15 are believed to originate from two distinct processes . between the jupiter mass and the deuterium - burning mass ,",
    "many of these objects may form similar to stars by gravitational fragmentation . below jupiter masses ,",
    "they likely are born in protoplanetary disks and dynamically - ejected during the evolution of the system .",
    "it is unknown from a theoretical perspective whether there is a smooth continuation of the mass function at the dividing mass that separates these populations .    in light of these uncertainties ,",
    "we choose a simple broken power - law model for the nomad mass function , @xmath16 , which is a smooth continuation of the mass function at higher masses , @xmath17 in addition to these power law slopes , we define the minimum cut - off in the nomad mass function as @xmath18 , the number of objects in the nomad mass regime as @xmath19 , and the number of main sequence stars in the mass regime of @xmath20 as @xmath21 . from the latter",
    "two quantities we define the ratio @xmath22 . for the above parameterization , empirical bounds over the entire nomad range may be motivated from several considerations .",
    "first , the mass function of the lowest mass nomads that we consider may be estimated from bounds on the population of kuiper belt objects ( kbos ) .",
    "we start from the distribution of diameters of kbos determined in  @xcite . at the high diameter end , @xmath23 km , the kbo distribution scales as @xmath24 . below the break radius of @xmath25 km , where collisional effects are believed to be important , the kbo distribution flattens , @xmath26 const . assuming that the bodies of the outer solar system have approximately constant mass density of @xmath27 g @xmath28 , the mass function scales as @xmath29 above @xmath30 , while below the mass function scales as @xmath31 .    at the highest mass end",
    ", corresponding to approximately several times the mass of jupiter , there is evidence that nomadic objects in open clusters constitute a smooth continuation of the brown dwarf mass function at higher masses with @xmath32  .",
    "further there may be a turnover in the mass function below @xmath33 times jupiter mass  , though these results are subject to systematic uncertainties on the masses of the objects and the small number of objects known .    in comparison to these results from direct imaging ,",
    "microlensing observations more strongly constrain the nomadic mass function , in particular at the high mass end . the microlensing results from  @xcite",
    "find that the equivalent best - fitting slopes and one - sigma uncertainties are @xmath34 and @xmath35 . in  @xcite the minimum mass",
    "was taken to be @xmath36 , though given the cadence of the survey they are insensitive to values of @xmath18 at this mass scale and below .",
    "taking @xmath36 and these best - fitting slopes implies @xmath37 .",
    "extrapolation down to below earth mass scales , @xmath38 , yields @xmath39 , and further extrapolation down to @xmath40 yields @xmath41 . intriguingly for a continuous power law extrapolation down to @xmath42 , the number of nomads per star approaches the bound on the abundance of interstellar comets  @xcite , and the corresponding nomad mass density is @xmath43 of the oxygen mass density in the interstellar medium  @xcite .    assuming the above parameterization of the mass function",
    ", @xmath44 is negatively correlated with @xmath45 from microlensing observations .",
    "for example , for @xmath46 , the 95% c.l .",
    "lower limit on the nomad slope is @xmath47 . for this combination of slopes , extrapolating down to @xmath40 implies that @xmath48 . on the other hand for @xmath49 , the  @xcite 95% c.l .",
    "upper limit on the slope is @xmath50 . in this case assuming @xmath51 implies @xmath52 .",
    "extrapolation down to @xmath53 implies an order of magnitude increase in @xmath54 , while extrapolation down to @xmath40 implies @xmath55 .",
    "the above estimates indicate that , when fixing to the measured abundance of nomads at @xmath56 and smoothly extrapolating to lower masses , there is several orders of magnitude uncertainty on the nomad abundance . for an appropriately large ratio of the number of nomads to main sequence stars",
    ", the nomad mass function is constrained by the limits on the number of compact objects in the galactic disk and halo . for masses",
    "@xmath57 , the abundance of compact objects in the halo is constrained by upper limits on macho dark matter  @xcite .",
    "these bounds indicate that compact objects of mass @xmath57 comprise @xmath58 of the galactic dark matter halo . for more local measurements ,",
    "a less stringent limit arises from the stellar mass density of the galactic disk , which we take to be @xmath59 pc@xmath60  @xcite . as an example",
    ", if we assume that the entire local mass distribution of the disk is comprised of objects at the mass scale @xmath4 , the bound @xmath59 pc@xmath60 corresponds to an upper limit of @xmath61 compact objects per main sequence star .",
    "masses of compact objects at these scales and below may be probed by future short cadence microlensing observations with the kepler satellite ( see * ? ? ? * and the discussion below ) .",
    "predictions for the number of nomads , in comparison to constraints on the local mass density , are summarized in figure  [ fig : mf ] .",
    "this shows the number of nomads greater than a given mass scale , @xmath62 , relative to the number of main sequence stars , @xmath21 .",
    "four different slopes for the nomad mass function are labeled , @xmath63 , which have corresponding values for the slope of the brown dwarf mass function of @xmath64 .",
    "the upper limit , indicated as the diagonal line , is determined assuming that objects at that mass scale have a density of @xmath59 pc@xmath60 . for @xmath65 , the total mass of the nomad population",
    "is dominated by the lowest mass objects .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]      as our final example we study the nomad event rate measurable by the kepler satellite .",
    "kepler monitors @xmath66 deg@xmath67 towards the cygnus region , and has a photometric precision of approximately 80 ppm for sources brighter than @xmath68 , and a few percent for sources at @xmath69 .",
    "kepler is complete down to @xmath70 .",
    "the integration time is 30 minutes for the majority of kepler sources . for @xmath50 and @xmath71 , and assuming @xmath72 down to 20th magnitude , the raw event rate is a few per year for 30 minutes @xmath73 1 day . for @xmath74",
    "we find less than one event per year .",
    "however , these predictions are for @xmath75 ; due to its precise photometry of @xmath76 ppm for bright stars with @xmath77 the event rate is proportionally larger for @xmath78",
    ". thus discovery of anomalous microlensing events in the kepler data may indicate a steep value for the nomad mass function , and warrant a dedicated analysis of the photometry of kepler stars .",
    "in the above analysis we have restricted only to events with timescales sufficiently long to be detectable according to the criteria above .",
    "what if we relax this criteria , and expand to consider events with shorter timescales , over which the lightcurves are much more sparsely sampled ?",
    "is it still possible to detect microlensing events from lighter nomads over much shorter timescales ?    as an example let us consider the planned survey strategy of  _ lsst_. in a given  _ lsst _ filter , each visit will consist of two consecutive 15  second exposures separated by a 4  second readout interval .",
    "when possible , each field will be observed twice , with visits separated by @xmath79 minutes . for stars with @xmath80 ,",
    "the single visit photometric precision of each measurement is @xmath81 mmag .",
    "though per visit the photometry is very precise and the 30 second cadence is short , two points on a lightcurve are not adequate to claim the detection of a microlensing event .",
    "however , the lack of variation of a source star over this timescale in between visits could allow us to bound the existence of nomads with characteristic timescales @xmath82 seconds . assuming both the lenses and the sources to be in the disk",
    ", this timescale corresponds to a lens of mass @xmath83",
    ".    will lenses with such a small mass cause noticeable brightness fluctuations in a star when accounting for finite source effects ?",
    "for our uniform source surface brightness model , we find that this depends on the lensing geometry .",
    "for example , with @xmath84 kpc and @xmath85 kpc , a lens of mass @xmath86 \\msun$ ] will have a peak brightness of @xmath87 $ ] . for lenses",
    "nearer to the source , @xmath88 is reduced from these values .",
    "though these are smaller brightness fluctuations than typically searched for in microlensing events , the presence of these objects may be limited given the photometric precision of _",
    "lsst_.    in perhaps more near of a term , we may entertain the prospect of a dedicated telescope that is capable of detecting short timescale microlensing events that last for as little as tens of seconds . as an example",
    ", we will consider a liquid mirror telescope similar in design to the six - meter large zenith telescope  , only in our case positioned in the southern hemisphere to cover the galactic bulge . for a @xmath89 ccd chip with @xmath90 per pixel and a 6-m aperture , in less than",
    "a day a patch of area @xmath66 square degrees could be scanned .",
    "we focus on the @xmath91-band , and take the bulge as an example with an surface brightness of @xmath92 mag arcsec@xmath93  @xcite . assuming that the signal - to - noise is dominated by the unresolved light from the bulge and shot noise , for a star with @xmath94 the signal - to - noise is @xmath95 .",
    "a 10-second exposure then gives a photometric precision of @xmath43 , and during this time a star crosses through @xmath96 pixels .",
    "this would likely be sufficient to obtain several points on a lightcurve to measure a microlensing event with @xmath97 .",
    "sec .    for a nomad mass function of @xmath98 with @xmath99 , for a 100 deg@xmath67 patch that passes through the galactic center we find @xmath100 events per year with @xmath101 seconds for source stars with @xmath102",
    ". the event rate may even be up to an order of magnitude larger for steeper values of the mass function over the range @xmath103 .",
    "it is also worthwhile to point out that a telescope designed along these lines could also be a relatively inexpensive endeavor .",
    "further , a liquid mirror telescope with mercury could extend to the near - infrared , where the reflectivity would be similar to that in the optical .",
    "we have estimated that there may be up to about @xmath104 compact objects per main sequence star in the galaxy that are greater than the mass of pluto . a dedicated high cadence survey of the inner galaxy , such as would be possible with _ wfirst",
    "_ , could measure the number of nomads greater than the mass of jupiter per main sequence star to @xmath2 , and the corresponding number greater than the mass of mars to @xmath3 .",
    "also _ wfirst _ can measure the minimum mass of the nomad population to about 30% .",
    "large - scale surveys , in particular that of _ gaia _ , could identify nomads in the galactic disk that are greater than about the mass of jupiter .",
    "observations along the lines that we discuss will constrain the nomad population of the disk relative to the bulge , and will also more generally improve the star - star microlensing event rate in the disk and the solar neighborhood , about which very little is now known  @xcite .",
    "further , they will improve our understanding of the mass function of low mass brown dwarfs and super - jupiters , and the distinction between these classes of objects  @xcite .",
    "how will these measurements compare to modern microlensing measurements of low mass brown dwarf population from disk observations ? to answer this question we can briefly consider the results from @xcite .",
    "these authors find a total of @xmath105 events in three fields in which the lenses are primarily disk sources , and in particular there are two very short timescale lenses , at @xmath106 and @xmath107 days . while the data are not sufficient at present to perform a full statistical analysis and constrain @xmath44 and @xmath45 , from an analysis of these data one may deduce that a steeper model brown dwarf mass function is favored over a more shallow model .",
    "the inclusion of the nomad population does mildly improve the statistical fit , though in order to probe this population with disk observations a survey must build up a sufficient event rate in the @xmath108 day timescale bin .",
    "how will the future microlensing measurements we discuss compare to direct measurements of the brown dwarf mass function ?",
    "@xcite find that for warm brown dwarfs the mass function may be flat , @xmath49 . for cooler",
    "brown dwarfs the recent wise observations are consistent with a wide range of @xmath45 between @xmath109 @xcite .",
    "other microlensing observations shed light on the brown dwarf mass function , though they do not clarify the picture .",
    "for example , @xcite uncover an extreme magnification microlensing event and interpret it as due to a thick disk brown dwarf . according to  @xcite",
    ", there is a very low probability to observe this event given our standard population of brown dwarfs in the galactic disk given the large velocity of the event .",
    "the existence of these events either implies that we have been lucky to observe events at all ( in particular with the large observed magnifications ) , or that the local population of low mass and low luminosity stellar remnants is larger than is presently predicted .    if a nomad is identified via the methods described in this paper , there are a number of follow - up observations that are possible .",
    "for example even though _ gaia _ will only do on average 1 - 2 one - dimensional astrometric measurements per epoch , it may be possible to confirm the photometric detection with astrometry for the brightest sources by comparing the centroid of the source during the event to the baseline centroid as determined over several epochs during the course of the mission .",
    "finally we note that an additional outcome of the observational approach discussed above , especially regarding the detection of short timescale microlensing events , is that upper limits may be set on the density of nomads .",
    "this could set very interesting constraints on the population of planetesimals in nascent planetary systems .",
