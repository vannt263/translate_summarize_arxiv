    "it seems that there are many distinct analogies between the dynamics and/or stochastics of complex physical and economical or even social systems @xcite .",
    "the methods and even algorithms that have been explored for description of physical phenomena become an effective background and inspiration for very productive methods used in analysis of economical data @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study an emerging market and more precisely , the historical warsaw stock exchange ( wse ) index wig at a daily time horizon at the closing ; we think that its dynamics is typical for an emerging financial market of small and moderate size . our concept is to consider",
    "only well developed temporal ( local ) maxima of the _ cusp_-like shape decorated with some oscillations ( cf .",
    "peaks denoted by @xmath0 in fig.[figure : wig1991 - 06_do_kwiec ] ) which cover the greater part of the whole time series .",
    "our goal is to describe the slowing down of rising and relaxation processes within these temporal maxima by assuming a retarded feedback as a principal effect ( except the rising path within the first local peak which , in principle , is exponential ; cf .",
    "fig.[figure : wiga_dud ] ) .",
    "this feedback is a reminiscence of investors activity stimulated mainly by their observations of the empirical data in the past .",
    "our analysis was inspired by the non - debye or non - exponential , fractional relaxation processes observed , for example , in stress - strain relaxation present in viscoelastic materials @xcite .",
    "the most commonly used empirical decay function for handling non - debye relaxation processes in complex systems are described either by a kohlraush - williams - watts ( kww ) or a stretched exponential decay function @xcite for short time - range @xmath1 : @xmath2 where @xmath3 , or by an asymptotic power - law ( nuttig law ) for @xmath4 : @xmath5 from expressions ( [ rown : kww ] ) and ( [ rown : nl ] ) we obtain for the change of @xmath6 per unit time @xmath7 which defines the power - law limits of the dynamics , i.e. it defines ( for @xmath8 ) a universality class ( characterized by dynamical , critical exponent @xmath9 ) which , in fact , can be viewed as the `` finger print '' of a dynamical critical phenomenon . for such a peak",
    "the derivative diverges at the extremal point ( i.e. at @xmath10 ) which justifies the name `` sharp peak '' used often in the literature in this context ( cf .",
    "@xcite and refs .",
    "therein ) . for a sufficiently wide empirical window",
    "it would be possible to observe a transition from the kww to the nutting behaviour and from one kind of power - law to another , correspondingly .",
    "note that the non - exponential relaxation introduces memory , i.e. the underlying fundamental processes are of non - markovian type .",
    "it was shown that a natural way to incorporate memory effects is fractional calculus .",
    "the power - law kernel defining the fractional relaxation equation involves a particularly long memory .",
    "the function which plays a dominating role in fractional relaxation problems is indeed the mittag - leffler ( ml ) function @xcite @xmath11 which is a natural generalisation of the exponential one .",
    "this function interpolates between cases ( [ rown : kww ] ) and ( [ rown : nl ] ) and plays a central role in our analysis .",
    "our phenomenological model of index dynamics consists of two stages :    * formulation of a linear ordinary differential equation of the first order with no feedback incorporated which describes evolution of an auxiliary , synthetic index only . * a conjecture which transforms the above mentioned equation to a more general fractional form which already models the evolution of the empirical warsaw stock exchange index .    the transition from ( i ) to ( ii ) means that the system is changed from an unrealistic to a realistic , complex one where the retarded feedback plays an essential role .",
    "by using this model we are able to describe the well developed temporal maxima present in daily time series defined by wig activity ( cf .",
    "four maxima @xmath12 and @xmath13 shown in fig.[figure : wig1991 - 06_do_kwiec ] ) .        * the instantaneous offset @xmath15 between the temporal ( total ) demand @xmath16 for stocks defining wig and their ( total ) temporal supply @xmath17 . *",
    "the instantaneous volume trade @xmath18 $ ] of stocks of the companies which consitute wig .",
    "hence , we can write the following instantaneous superposition @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are referred to as coefficients of relocation . note that paradoxally index @xmath14 is defined here relative to some reference level so it can be , in general , both positive and negative . ] can change even when the volume of trade , @xmath22 , vanishes , i.e. when the demand or supply vanishes . on the other hand , for vanishing @xmath23 ( when the demand is balanced by the supply ) volume trade , @xmath22 , can be still nonvanishing which leads to the change of wig ) defines an additive variant of our model though a multiplicative one is also possible . ] .    to consider the dynamics ( evolution ) of wig",
    ", we complete eq.([rown : xsv ] ) by the differential one which exhibits an instantaneous , therefore unrealistic , feedback to the financial market , namely @xmath24 where coefficients @xmath25 are rates while @xmath26 is again a kind of relocation coefficient . by combining eqs.([rown : xsv ] ) and ( [ rown : dtuvx ] ) we eliminate the @xmath22 variable and obtain ( after integration ) , @xmath27 ,    \\label{rown : cedt}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the definition of an inverse derivative of the first order was used ; the definition of its general @xmath28 order version ( for @xmath29 ) has a useful form given by the cauchy formula of repeated integration @xmath30 the combined coefficients @xmath31 which are valid for @xmath32 ; otherwise , instead of eq.([rown : cedt ] ) we would obtain a very special one .",
    "the integral eq.([rown : cedt ] ) defines the model which is an analog of the zener one for viscoelastic solids @xcite in which the stress ( @xmath33 ) - strain ( @xmath34 ) relationship and strain by @xmath35 . ]",
    "is given originally by the linear first order differential equation @xcite .",
    "indeed , eq.([rown : cedt ] ) is the one which we generalize to the fractional form by applying its maxwell formulation @xcite .",
    "this formulation consists of a spring ( obeying hooke s law ) and a dashpot ( obeying newton s law of viscosity ) in series ; this arrangement shows a simple spatial separation of the solid ( elastic ) and the fluid ( viscous ) aspects and it is too specific to describe real viscoelastic materials .",
    "however , the hierarchical arrangement of a number ( in general infinite ) springs and dashpots is already sufficient @xcite .",
    "note , that in our approach the spring defines a purely emotional or irrational investors activity while the dashpot defines a purely rational one .",
    "there are several definitions of fractional differentiation and integration @xcite . in what follows",
    "we are dealing strictly with the liouville - riemann ( lr ) fractional calculus .",
    "the fractional integration of arbitrary order @xmath36 of function @xmath37 is a straightforward generalisation of ( [ rown : defd1 ] ) , @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the lr fractional integral operator of order @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "the fractional generalization of eq.([rown : cedt ] ) is performed by replacing expressions @xmath41 and @xmath42 by @xmath43 and @xmath44 ones , respectively , where the fractional ( in general ) exponent @xmath40 is a free but most important shape parameter .",
    "hence , we obtain the fractional integral equation which is able to describe both independent paths ( the rising and relaxation ) of local temporary peaks of wig : @xmath45 ,    \\label{rown : fracedt}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where it was tacitly assumed that @xmath46 , while the independent variable @xmath47 as both paths of any peak are assumed as independent ones we consider all parameters present in eq.([rown : fracedt ] ) as ( in general ) different for different paths .    for relaxation the first term on the rhs of eq.([rown : fracedt ] )",
    "describes feedback where the retarded value of index influences the present one ; this value is sensitive here to the past one due to the algebraic , integral kernel . the second term on the rhs of eq.([rown : fracedt ] )",
    "desribes explicitly a financial market retarded influence on the index ( or the stock price ) ; the third term gives the instantaneous influence .",
    "however , for the rising path the situation is more complicated and eq.([rown : fracedt ] ) constitutes only a formal , convenient way to describe it .",
    "as we prove , the first and third terms constitute mainly the basis of a dynamical structure of the local ( temporal ) maximum of wig .      to make a step towards the interpretation",
    ", we define the fractional differentiation of order @xmath48 @xmath49 which is considered to be composed of a fractional integration of the order @xmath50 followed by an ordinary differentiation of order @xmath51 .",
    "now , by ordinary differentiation of the first order of eq.([rown : fracedt ] ) and by applying definition ( [ rown : fracbdt ] ) we obtain the linear inhomogeneous fractional differential equation @xmath52 which describes well both paths of the studied peaks .",
    "we found that the well developed local maxima of the index can be fitted ( except for the left - hand side of the first one and up to their oscillations and fluctuations ) by an intermediate part of the ml function . in our case",
    "we obtained several values of exponent @xmath40 for wig s maxima and almost all of them ( except one ) are smaller than @xmath53 ; note that the left - hand side of the first maximum is well fitted by the usual exponential function ( or by assuming @xmath54 in the mf function ) .",
    "in other words , the relaxation of almost all wig local maxima can be described by the fractional relaxation equation by setting in eq.([rown : dfracedt ] ) coefficient @xmath55 .",
    "such a simplified equation is , of course , a fractional generalization of the standard relaxation equation whose solution has indeed the form ( [ rown : eq1 ] ) ( where variable @xmath56 is replaced by @xmath57 and parameter @xmath58 by corresponding @xmath59 one ) .",
    "this solution is considered here only as a reference case .",
    "we solve the fractional initial value problem ( [ rown : dfracedt ] ) by assuming that @xmath60 ,   \\label{rown : expat}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( where parameters @xmath61 ) and by applying the laplace transform of a fractional integral operator .",
    "namely , the laplace transformation of eq.([rown : fracedt ] ) yields @xmath62\\ ; \\frac{s^{-1}}{1+\\tau _ 1^{-\\alpha } s^{-\\alpha } } ,    \\label{rown : translapx}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the laplace transform of the lr fractional integral operator was applied here . by introducing the laplace transform of ( [ rown : expat ] ) into eq.([rown : translapx ] ) and by using the inverse laplace transformation in the time domain",
    "we can obtain the real part of the solution .",
    "however , to compare the prediction of our model with empirical data it is sufficient to use only the lowest order terms in the exact solution , i.e. it is suficient to use the following approximate solution @xmath63 e_{\\alpha } \\left(-\\left(\\frac{y}{\\tau _ 1}\\right)^{\\alpha } \\right)+ \\nonumber \\\\ & -&a^{\\prime } \\",

    ": wiga_dud]-[figure : wigd_06_kw ] we compared the empirical data defining wig s local maxima ( denoted as @xmath65 and @xmath13 in fig.[figure : wig1991 - 06_do_kwiec ] ) with the predictions given by formula ( [ rown : approxfde ] ) .",
    "the monotonic curves ( obtained by using only the first term ) present free solutions while the oscillating curves ( obtained by using the whole expression ) the full ones , i.e. the free solutions decorated with mono - frequency oscillations ( rising and falling paths of peaks @xmath66 and @xmath21 , respectively ) or wiggles ( right - hand paths of peaks @xmath67 and @xmath66 as well as left - hand path of peak @xmath21 ) . the values of the key parameters which we obtained are shown in tables [ table : tab1]-[table : tab7 ] .        in fig.[figure :",
    "wigblanal_new ] are presented : ( i ) the mittag - leffler function fitted , for example , to the left - hand path of the empirical maximum @xmath21 ( this is the free solution taken , in fact , from fig.[figure : wigb_dud_17_01_06 ] ) , and corresponding ( ii ) kww law ( lower curve ) as well as ( iii ) the nutting law ( upper curve ) .",
    "this is a typical situation valid both for the left- and right - hand paths of all considered peaks .",
    "it is characteristic that none of the peaks reached the fully developed scaling region of the return per unit time @xmath68 ( cf .",
    "section [ section : insp ] ) . in this sense",
    "the considered peaks have a precritical character .      *",
    "both paths of any peak can be considered as independent ones and the location of turning point ( extremum ) as a random one . *",
    "the considered peaks are asymmetric since : * * the exponent @xmath40 , which characterizes the left - hand paths of any peak , is larger than the analogous one characterizing the right - hand one , * * parameter @xmath59 ( defining the time unit ) of the left - hand path is smaller than the corresponding one for the right - hand path . *",
    "the location of the extremal point @xmath69 given by expression ( [ rown : approxfde ] ) is ( in general ) different for left- and right - hand paths of each peak .",
    "moreover , a frequency modulation signal is necessary and/or the influence of the signal outside the maximum should be taken into account to describe the beginning of the left - hand paths of peaks @xmath66 and @xmath21 ( cf .",
    "figs.[figure : wigcent_dud_17_01_06 ] and [ figure : wigb_dud_17_01_06 ] ) .    concluding , we suggest that our approach can rationally decrease the risk of investment on the stock market since it is able to warn the investors before the stock market reaches a critical region .",
