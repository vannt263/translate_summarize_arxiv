    "holographic projection @xcite is a kind of laser projection .",
    "it requires two - step processing for the projection .",
    "the first step is to calculate a hologram from the image to be projected using diffraction calculation . in the second step",
    ", a spatial light modulator ( slm ) displaying the hologram reconstructs the projected image .",
    "the optical system does not need a lens because the hologram itself has the property of a lens .",
    "therefore , the system , which ultimately requires only an slm and light source , promises to be very simple .",
    "a holographic projection is especially suitable for micro- and pico - projectors due to the above - mentioned reasons , but there are problems : for example , speckle noise , long calculation time for hologram , and magnification of a projected image .    speckle noise is a common problem on laser projections . in holographic projection , many methods for speckle noise reduction have been proposed .",
    "iterative algorithms based on gerchberg - saxton ( gs ) algorithm @xcite are widely used to gradually improve the speckle noise by iterating diffraction and inverse diffraction calculations with constraints on the reconstructed and hologram planes by _ a priori _ information .",
    "speckle noise reduction by sparsely placing the pixels on a projected image has been proposed @xcite . following which , a pixel separation method @xcite has been proposed to improve the reducing resolution of the projected image using the speckle noise reduction method of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the problem of the hologram calculation time is a critical issue in holographic projection because multiple diffraction calculations are required to efficiently reduce the speckle noise .",
    "for example , fast hologram calculation algorithms have been proposed @xcite .",
    "hardware - based methods using graphics processing units ( gpus ) and field programmable gate arrays ( fpgas ) have also been proposed @xcite .",
    "a zoom function is indispensable to projectors .",
    "a zoom lens module consisting of mechanical parts and many lenses to avoid aberrations is used in general , but using it increases the system size , weight and cost .",
    "in addition , it requires manual operation of the module to adjust to the proper magnification . in holographic projection , a liquid crystal ( lc ) lens , which can magnify the projected image by displaying a fresnel lens pattern on it , was demonstrated instead of using a zoom lens @xcite .",
    "the method could control the magnification by the fresnel lens pattern without manual operation .",
    "however , this method requires an additional special device . whereas , we proposed a zoomable holographic projection without any lens or special device @xcite .",
    "the method realized the zoom function using scaled diffraction @xcite , which calculates diffraction between planes with different sampling pitches .",
    "the magnification is determined by the ratio of the sampling pitch on the projected image and that of the hologram .",
    "the structure of this zoomable holographic projection is very simple because it does not need a lens ; however , it only projects a single image to a plane parallel to the hologram .",
    "this paper numerically investigates the feasibility of lensless zoomable holographic multiple projections to tilted planes .",
    "the lensless zoomable holographic projection in this paper is capable of projecting multiple images onto multiple tilted planes simultaneously .",
    "reference @xcite has already reported a holographic projection to a tilted plane using fractional fourier transform with a lens ; however , it does not consider multiple projections to tilted planes , and could not magnify the projected images .",
    "in contrast , as shown in fig . [",
    "fig : system ] , our lensless zoomable holographic projection is considered multiple projections to tilted planes .",
    "our system does not include a lens . here",
    ", we assume that the system can simultaneously project two images : `` projected image 1 '' is parallel to the hologram and `` projected image 2 '' is off - axis and non - parallel to the hologram .",
    "in addition , each projected image is individually magnified without a zoom lens .",
    "the application of this projection system is that , for example , the system projects the image of the keyboard ( `` projected image 2 '' ) on a desk and another image ( `` projected image 1 '' ) on a screen from one slm .",
    "if we had sufficient computational power for real - time hologram calculation , we would be able to interactively operate projected image 1 on the screen by pushing the keyboard image . pushing the keyboard image",
    "would be detected by a camera and computer vision algorithms .",
    "we do not mention the real - time hologram calculation hereafter .    in our previous work @xcite , we magnified a single projected image parallel to the hologram using scaled diffraction , but could not realize a projected image on a tilted plane .",
    "this paper extends scaled diffraction so that it can project onto a tilted screen .",
    "let us begin with scaled diffraction .",
    "many scaled diffraction calculations have been proposed @xcite .",
    "scaled diffraction is commonly expressed by , @xmath0 } , \\label{eqn : scale}\\ ] ] where the operator @xmath1}$ ] indicates scaled diffraction , @xmath2 is the source plane ( an image to be projected ) with the pixel pitch of @xmath3 , @xmath4 is the complex amplitude on a hologram with the pixel pitch of @xmath5 , and @xmath6 is the propagation distance between the source and destination planes . @xmath7 and @xmath8 mean the position vector on the source and hologram .",
    "the planes @xmath2 and @xmath4 are placed in parallel to each other .",
    "there are some implementations of scaled diffraction : for example , shifted fresnel diffraction @xcite , arss fresnel diffraction @xcite , scaled angular spectrum method @xcite and so forth .    here",
    ", we use arss fresnel diffraction as the scaled diffraction .",
    "arss fresnel diffraction improves the problem of shifted fresnel diffraction for aliasing noise . in one - dimension ,",
    "it is expressed by , @xmath9 }   { \\mathcal{f } \\biggl[\\exp(i \\phi_h ) { \\rm rect}(\\frac{x_h}{2 x_{max } } )   \\biggl ] }   \\biggl ] } , \\label{eqn : arss}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the rectangular function for the band - limitation to @xmath11 and @xmath12 , @xmath11 and @xmath13 are defined by , @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the wavelength and wavenumber and we define the scale parameter @xmath17 and the offset vector @xmath18 away from the origin .",
    "the expansion to the two - dimension is straightforward .",
    "we can convert the complex amplitude @xmath4 to the amplitude hologram @xmath19 by , e.g. @xmath20 , and convert one to the kinoform @xmath21 by @xmath22 where @xmath23 takes the argument of the complex number .",
    "if we set @xmath5 larger than @xmath3 , we can obtain a magnified image on a projected plane without using a lens .",
    "however , eq.([eqn : scale ] ) does not realize the projection of an image on a tilted plane . in order to improve this issue ,",
    "we use scaled diffraction with tilted diffraction @xcite , which calculates diffraction between non - parallel planes . tilted diffraction calculation of the rotation of a complex amplitude in the frequency domain with rotation matrix @xmath24 where , @xmath25 the relation between the source plane @xmath26}$ ] and the rotated plane @xmath27}$ ] on the frequency domain is expressed by , @xmath28}=u_1'(\\alpha(u , v)-1/\\lambda , \\beta(u , v)-1/\\lambda ) , \\label{eqn : rot}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 .",
    "eq.([eqn : rot ] ) requires the interpolation .",
    "we used linear interpolation as the interpolation .",
    "we can simply obtain the scaled diffraction on a tilted plane by the combination of eq.([eqn : scale ] ) and eq.([eqn : rot ] ) : @xmath32 } = { { \\mathcal{{\\rm prop}}^{p_1,p_h}_{z } \\bigl[{\\mathcal{f}^{-1 } \\bigl[{{\\rm rot}_{\\rm m } \\bigl [ { \\mathcal{f } \\bigl [ u_1(\\bm x_1 )   \\bigr ] } \\bigl ] }   \\bigr]}\\bigl ] } } .",

    "we show multiple reconstructed images from a hologram generated by a combination of the scaled diffraction and tilted diffraction .",
    "the hologram is in fact calculated as kinoform .",
    "the setup for the hologram calculation and reconstruction is shown in fig.[fig : fig_calc ] .",
    "we assume that the wavelength of light is @xmath38 nm and the sampling pitch on the hologram is @xmath39 m . we use two images with @xmath40 pixels to be projected that are the same as `` projected image 1 '' and `` projected image 2 '' in fig.[fig : system ] . image 1 , which is denoted as @xmath41 , is parallel to the hologram and the distance of @xmath42 m from the hologram , whereas image 2 which is denoted as @xmath43 is inclined to x - axis at @xmath44 degrees and the distance of @xmath45 m from the hologram .",
    "we use the following rotation matrix , @xmath46        the complex amplitude @xmath2 on image 1 with random phase is expressed by , @xmath47 where @xmath48 means random numbers .",
    "the diffracted result of @xmath2 on the hologram is calculated by arss fresnel diffraction of eq.([eqn : arss ] ) with a different sampling pitch .",
    "the complex amplitude @xmath49 on image 2 with a different random phase is expressed by , @xmath50 where @xmath51 also means random numbers .",
    "the last term means that image 2 is placed off - axis and it travels to the hologram at the angle @xmath52 .",
    "in addition , we use the offset @xmath53 in arss fresnel diffraction .",
    "we assume @xmath54 because the sampling pitch of hologram @xmath39 m , so that we need to set the angle within the maximum angle @xmath55 .",
    "the complex amplitude of @xmath49 is first rotated by the tilted diffraction with the angle @xmath44 and then propagated by arss fresnel diffraction with different sampling pitches .",
    "the hologram is generated by taking the argument of accumulating these complex amplitudes . in the reconstruction ,",
    "image 1 is reconstructed simply by using arss fresnel diffraction , while image 2 is reconstructed by firstly calculating arss fresnel diffraction and then rotating the diffracted result by eq.([eqn : rot ] ) .",

    "we use a multi - random phase method @xcite that prepares multiple holograms with different random phases , and then reduces the speckle noise on the reconstructed image by fast switching the holograms , owing to the time averaging effect of human eyes .",
