    "x - ray observations of radio pulsars provide a powerful probe of the energetics and emission mechanisms of rotation - powered neutron stars . though pulsars have traditionally been most easily studied at radio wavelengths , that emission represents a small fraction of the neutron star energy budget , which is fed by rotational energy loss due to magnetic dipole braking .",
    "it is thought that the bulk of this `` spin - down luminosity '' emerges in the form of a relativistic wind .",
    "the interaction of the wind with the surrounding medium can lead to observable synchrotron emission in the x - ray band , as in the crab nebula .",
    "thermal x - rays are also detected from the neutron star surface in some cases , as are pulsed , non - thermal x - rays from the magnetosphere .",
    "recently the number of x - ray identified rotation - powered pulsars has grown sufficiently large that studying the properties of the population as a whole is possible ( see becker & trmper 1997 for a recent review ) .",
    "particularly important targets for x - ray observations are the youngest members of the pulsar population , because of their large spin - down luminosities .",
    "the recently discovered young radio pulsar psr  j1105@xmath06107  has a spin period 63  ms , a characteristic spin - down age @xmath10  kyr , and a spin - down luminosity @xmath1110@xmath12  erg  s@xmath8 ( kaspi et  al.1997 ) .",
    "the pulsar s dispersion measure implies that it is 7  kpc from the earth ( taylor & cordes 1993 ) .",
    "psr  j1105@xmath06107  is positionally coincident with the high - energy @xmath13-ray _",
    "cgro_/_egret _",
    "source 2eg  j1103@xmath06106 .",
    "if the two are associated , the observed @xmath13-ray flux implies an efficiency for conversion of spin - down luminosity to @xmath13-rays of @xmath143% for a beaming angle of 1  sr .",
    "the pulsar is located @xmath1425@xmath15 from the center of the supernova remnant msh 11@xmath061a , which suggests that the two may be associated . at 7  kpc , if the characteristic age is the true age ( but see kaspi et  al .",
    "1997 for a discussion ) and if the apparent geometric center of the remnant is the approximate pulsar birth location , the pulsar s implied transverse velocity is @xmath14650  km  s@xmath8 .",
    "this velocity is high , but within the range of typical young pulsar velocities ( lyne & lorimer 1994 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the large uncertainties in the age and distance estimates toward both sources and absence of independent evidence for a large velocity make an association tentative at best ( c.f .",
    "kaspi 1996 ) .",
    "we report here on _ asca",
    "_  observations of the psr  j1105@xmath06107  field , which reveal a faint x - ray source in the direction of the pulsar .",
    "a two - day - long observation of psr  j1105@xmath06107  was performed by the _ asca_observatory ( tanaka et  al .",
    "1994 ) on 1996 june 2123 .",
    "data were acquired with all four imaging spectrometers , each in the focal plane of its own foil mirror : two solid state imaging spectrometers ( sis-0 , sis-1 ) , and two gas imaging spectrometers ( gis-2 , gis-3 ) .",
    "these spectrometers offer moderate energy ( @xmath16 ) and @xmath17 imaging resolution in their @xmath18 kev energy band - passes .",
    "the gis has a higher effective area above @xmath19 kev and a greater net observation time than the sis .    to search for pulsations from psr  j1105@xmath06107 ,",
    "gis data were collected in the highest time resolution configuration ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 , or @xmath22 depending on data acquisition rate ) .",
    "sis data were acquired in 2 ccd mode , with 8 s integrations , using a combination of faint and bright modes ( see the _ asca _  data analysis guide for details ) .",
    "the target was placed @xmath23 off the corner of sis-0 ccd-0 , as close to the mean telescope optical axis as was practical , to minimize vignetting losses .",
    "the data were edited to exclude times of high background contamination using the standard `` rev2 '' screening criteria .",
    "this rejects time intervals of south atlantic anomaly passages , earth block , bright earth limb in the field - of - view , and periods of high particle activity .",
    "the resulting effective observation time is @xmath24  ks ( gis ) and @xmath25  ks ( sis ) for the two pairs of sensors .",
    "the cleansis algorithm ( gotthelf 1993 ) was used to identify and remove hot and flickering ccd pixels in the sis data .",
    "flat - fielded images were generated by aligning and co - adding exposure - corrected images from the pairs of instruments .",
    "exposure maps were generated with ascaexpo , _ asca _  software which uses the satellite aspect solution , instrument map ( gis ) , chip alignment , and hot pixel map ( sis ) to determine the exposure time for each sky image pixel .",
    "the exposure correction was highly effective in removing gis instrumental structure due to the window support grid .",
    "figure 1a displays the resultant smoothed broad - band image for the gis .",
    "the image reveals the supernova remnant towards the northern edge of the field - of - view , an unresolved , serendipitous point source close to the eastern edge , and a faint source near the pulsar position .",
    "we performed an unbiased source search on the gis data using a modified box search algorithm set for a weak source threshold . for each test cell on the sky image",
    "we fit the putative source profile to a model for the psf plus background ; the exposure map is used to compute the statistical errors of the fit .",
    "we detected both the faint source and the serendipitous object .",
    "the only other sources detected by this search were the significant flux deviations associated with parts of the remnant in the north .",
    "here we discuss the putative target detection and leave the analysis of the serendipitous source , , to a future paper .",
    "the measured x - ray  position of the faint source is @xmath26 from the radio position of psr  j1105@xmath06107  ( see table 1 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the _ asca _  error circle ( gotthelf 1996 ) , which introduces a systematic offset to the image in a random sky direction .",
    "this offset dominates over the source position measurement error of @xmath27 .",
    "we estimate that the probability of detecting a source with comparable flux by chance in the gis active area , which has a radius of @xmath28 , to be @xmath29 . for this estimate",
    "we have assumed there is @xmath30 such source per deg@xmath31 and that the spatial resolution is @xmath32 .",
    "we therefore consider this a detection of psr  j1105@xmath06107  and proceed to estimate the detection significance and source flux .    to estimate the significance of the detection , we ignore the complexities of the _ asca _  point - spread function and compare the number of counts collected from an optimal 4@xmath15 diameter aperture centered on the source with that from a @xmath33 concentric annulus .",
    "the relatively small number of counts available in the source region makes the approximation reasonable .",
    "the total number of counts in the gis source aperture is 840 , of which 616 are expected from the background , implying a @xmath34 pulsar detection .",
    "we have normalized the counts in the background annulus ( 13,400 cts ) to the source aperture by the relative exposure area ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "the source is also detected in the individual gis sensors , but at the expected lower significance ( see table 2 ) .",
    "our estimates of the detection significance ( the signal - to - noise ratio , @xmath36 ) take into account both the source and background variance : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the number of background subtracted source counts , derived from @xmath39 , the total number of counts in the aperture , and @xmath40 , the number of background counts , normalized to the source aperture by the relative exposure area @xmath41 . here",
    ", @xmath42 gives the total exposure time by summing the exposure map ( @xmath43 ) pixels covering the source or background aperture .",
    "notice that if all pixels contain the same exposure time , then @xmath44 is equivalent to the usual area ratio of the source to background aperture .",
    "we next examined the flat - fielded sis image , similarly co - added and smoothed on arcminute scales as with the gis .",
    "there is also evidence of enhanced emission around the location of the pulsar , within the expected error circle ( see fig .",
    "the detected number of counts at the putative pulsar position is too small to fully resolve the familiar cross pattern of the psf , as the morphology is dominated by poisson fluctuations ( see hwang & gotthelf 1997  2.2 for a discussion of the significance of peaks in similarly processed images ) .",
    "it is reassuring that the brightest pixel in the sis image is coincident with the gis location of psr  j1105@xmath06107 . using the same method outlined for the gis",
    "we derive a @xmath45 sis detection from 235 background subtracted source counts .",
    "thus , including data from all four telescopes aboard _",
    ", we find a total of 459 background - subtracted source counts from the direction of psr  j1105@xmath06107 , with a significance of detection of 10.8@xmath46 .",
    "we note that there is ambiguous evidence for extended emission between the pulsar and remnant .",
    "also , there is perhaps another faint point source within a few arcminutes of the pulsar .",
    "this additional flux is evidently very soft as it is not seen in the gis image and is confined to the soft - band sis image ( @xmath47 kev ) .",
    "however , it is not evident in archive _",
    "rosat_pspc data of the region .",
    "another faint point source , below the gis broad - band source detection threshold , is apparent in the soft - band sis image just south of the pulsar and does correspond to faint pspc emission .",
    "although the number of source counts from the pulsar is too small to distinguish among spectral models , we assume a simple absorbed power - law model to characterize the spectrum and extract a flux measurement .",
    "we concentrate our spectral analysis on the gis , rather than sis , as the former has greater sensitivity to photons above @xmath48 kev and has a greater field - of - view for background estimation .",
    "source counts from gis-2 and gis-3 were extracted using a @xmath49 diameter circular region and the fits were restricted to the @xmath50 kev energy range .",
    "background counts were obtained from a region @xmath51 west of the source region .",
    "this is far enough to provide a background dominated by local emission but still within the region of enhanced emission , most likely similar to the source background .",
    "we estimate the equivalent neutral hydrogen column density toward the x - ray source using the measured value toward msh 11@xmath061a , n@xmath52  @xmath5 ( rho 1995 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the value estimated using the standard `` rule - of - thumb '' of 10 neutral hydrogen atoms per free electron ( seward & wang 1988 ) , @xmath53  @xmath5 , given the pulsar dispersion measure , @xmath54  pc  @xmath55 ( kaspi et  al .",
    "radio observations of the field show that there is no large line - of - sight hii region that could contribute significantly to the dispersion measure ( b. stappers , b. gaensler , personal communication ) .",
    "a fit to the background - subtracted spectrum with a power - law model using the above column density yields a photon index of @xmath3 .",
    "the implied unabsorbed @xmath56 kev flux is ( @xmath57 ergs @xmath5 s@xmath8 .",
    "the predicted sis count rates for the above model are consistent with the sis detection .    as discussed below , the pulsar s x - ray luminosity is important for interpreting the origin of the x - ray emission . therefore , we test the robustness of our flux measurement in face of the uncertain column density . allowing both the power - law index and column density to vary , we find best fit parameters of @xmath58 and n@xmath59 @xmath5 .",
    "the implied @xmath56 kev flux of @xmath60 ergs @xmath5 s@xmath8 is statistically unchanged from the previous fit .",
    "we also held n@xmath61 fixed at half and twice the nominal value of @xmath53  @xmath5 .",
    "with half the hydrogen column , neither the implied flux ( @xmath62 ergs @xmath5 s@xmath8 ) nor the power law index ( @xmath63 ) differs significantly . with twice the column density ,",
    "the best - fit power law index is @xmath64 , implying a flux of @xmath65 ergs @xmath5 s@xmath8 , again not significantly different .",
    "we conclude that our flux measurement is insensitive above @xmath66 kev to the assumed n@xmath61 , within the reasonable range explored .",
    "we carried out a timing analysis using the events recorded by the two gis instruments .",
    "we selected events from a 4@xmath15 diameter aperture centered on the source , using data acquired at the high and medium data rates only .",
    "this produced total of @xmath67 events .",
    "we then folded the events using an ephemeris obtained from radio timing observations of psr  j1105@xmath06107  at the parkes radio telescope .",
    "the ephemeris , valid from 1996  may  10 through 1996  july  4 , consists of the following parameters : @xmath68  s@xmath8 , @xmath69  s@xmath70 , @xmath71  s@xmath72 , referred to epoch mjd  50240.0 , where @xmath73 is the rotation frequency .",
    "no pulsation was apparent in the folded light curve .",
    "to set an upper limit to the pulsed fraction , we injected an artificial pulsed signal of variable pulsed fraction and duty cycle 0.5 , until it was detected at the 90% confidence level using a standard @xmath74 test .",
    "our upper limit to the pulsed fraction determined in this way is 0.31 .",
    "because psr  j1105@xmath06107  has a characteristic age @xmath75  kyr , thermal emission from the surface should have effective temperature no higher than 100  ev ( see gelman 1995 and references therein ) .",
    "the corresponding blackbody flux , assuming the 7  kpc distance and a neutron star radius of 10  km , is 2.3@xmath76  erg  @xmath5  s@xmath8 . for this spectrum and flux , the _ asca",
    "_  gis count rate should be no more than @xmath144@xmath77  cps for reasonable values of @xmath78 .",
    "this count rate is some two orders of magnitude below the observed rate ( see table  2 ) .",
    "thus , thermal emission can not be the origin of the x - rays we detect from psr  j1105@xmath06107 .",
    "the most energetic pulsars in the known population exhibit hard - spectrum pulsations due to emission from the magnetosphere .",
    "such pulsations are characterized by large pulsed fractions ( becker & trmper 1997 and references therein ) , much larger than the upper limits we set using our _ asca_/gis data for psr  j1105@xmath06107 .",
    "this is not surprising given the characteristic age of psr  j1105@xmath06107 , which suggests it will exhibit properties like those of vela - type pulsars , which do not show strong x - ray pulsations ( e.g. gelman , finley & zimmerman 1993 ) .",
    "deeper observations could reveal pulsations due to a small magnetospheric component , but the bulk of the observed flux , being unpulsed , must have a separate origin .    the observed x - ray emission could originate from an optically thin hot gas bubble emitting thermal bremsstrahlung radiation , possibly a faint , previously unknown supernova remnant .",
    "if @xmath75  kyr is the system s true age , the hypothetical remnant would probably be in the radiative phase .",
    "then , the remnant radius , @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the supernova initial energy in units of @xmath81  erg , @xmath82 is the initial surrounding interstellar medium number density , and @xmath83 is the age of the remnant in units of @xmath84  yr ( see lozinskaya 1992 and references therein ) . for @xmath85 and taking @xmath86  pc , corresponding to the maximum size of the remnant given the _",
    "asca_/gis spatial resolution and assuming a distance of 7  kpc , @xmath87 .",
    "thus either this supernova released far less energy than is typical , or it expanded into a region of density @xmath14300  @xmath55 .",
    "neither seems likely .",
    "furthermore , there is no evidence for radio emission from a putative remnant ( b. stappers , b. gaensler , personal communication ) .",
    "it is possible that the observed x - ray emission comes from only a small part of a larger region , whose surface brightness is too faint to be observed .",
    "only a spectrum and deeper observations can decide unambiguously .",
    "the likeliest origin for the x - rays detected from psr  j1105@xmath06107  is a synchrotron nebula powered by the pulsar via a relativistic wind .",
    "the most famous pulsar wind nebula surrounds the crab pulsar ( rees & gunn 1974 ; kennel & coroniti 1984 ; emmering & chevalier 1987 ; gallant & arons 1994 ) .",
    "there the pulsar wind pressure is presumably confined by the unseen expanding shell . in pulsar wind nebulae , the wind relativistic electrons and positrons ( and possibly heavy ions , hoshino et al .",
    "1992 ) are confined , accelerated at the reverse shock , and radiate synchrotron emission . for psr  j1105@xmath06107 ,",
    "given the absence of evidence for a confining shell , the pulsar wind is probably confined by ram pressure ( cheng 1983 ; kulkarni et al .",
    "1992 ; fruchter et al .",
    "1992 ; wang , li , & begelman 1993 ; finley , srinivasan , & park 1996 ; romani , cordes & yadigaroglu 1997 ) .    here",
    "we show that a ram - pressure confined synchrotron nebula is consistent with the _ asca _  detection of psr  j1105@xmath06107 . equating the interstellar medium ram pressure with that of the pulsar wind , assuming a thin shock for simplicity , the distance of the shock apex from the pulsar is given by @xmath88 where @xmath73 is the fraction of @xmath89 channeled into the wind , @xmath90 is the ambient density , and @xmath91 is the pulsar velocity .",
    "it is reasonable to assume @xmath92 given the low efficiency for conversion to high - energy @xmath13-rays ( kaspi et al .",
    "let @xmath93  h atom  @xmath55 and @xmath94  km  s@xmath8 ) . then @xmath95  cm .",
    "the magnetic field just upstream of the shock , @xmath96 , is given by @xmath97 where @xmath46 is the ratio of the magnetic energy flux to the kinetic energy flux of the pulsar wind upstream of the shock .",
    "observations of the crab pulsar show that @xmath98 ( kennel & coroniti 1984 ) .",
    "just downstream of the shock , @xmath99 from shock jump conditions ( e.g. arons & tavani 1993 ) .",
    "we find @xmath100  g , where @xmath101 .",
    "the pulsar wind flow time scale is @xmath102  s. the time scale for synchrotron cooling is given by @xmath103  s , where @xmath13 is the post - shock pair lorentz factor ( e.g. rybicki & lightman 1979 ) .",
    "the synchrotron cooling efficiency for pairs having @xmath104 is therefore @xmath105 , where @xmath106 .",
    "the bolometric luminosity in synchrotron emission @xmath107 , which is dominated by the highest energy pairs , is given for @xmath108 pairs by @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is the fraction of pairs having @xmath111 .",
    "this predicted bolometric luminosity is 45 times smaller than the observed _",
    "asca_-band luminosity alone . relaxing the assumption that @xmath112 exacerbates the problem",
    "however , the observations can be accounted for in a number of ways : ( i ) if all of the post - shock wind pairs have lorentz factors @xmath113 or @xmath46 is significantly larger than 0.005 , implying different wind properties from those inferred from the crab pulsar ( e.g. hoshino et al .",
    "1992 ; gallant & arons 1994 ) ; ( ii ) the thin shock assumption does not apply and we have underestimated @xmath114 ; ( iii ) the pulsar resides in an overdense region having @xmath115  @xmath55 ; ( iv ) the actual space velocity is larger than assumed above , i.e. @xmath116 . case ( iv ) would be consistent with estimates of the pulsar velocity distribution ( e.g. lyne & lorimer 1994 ) , and with the velocity implied on the basis of a possible association with the supernova remnant msh 11@xmath061a  ( kaspi et al .",
    "estimates of the snr shock velocity ( p. slane , personal communication ) suggest an even higher pulsar space velocity ( c.f .",
    "frail et al .",
    "1996 ) . extrapolating the _ asca_-band flux to the _ rosat _  band assuming a power - law index of @xmath117",
    ", we find a soft x - ray luminosity of psr  j1105@xmath06107 larger by nearly an order of magnitude compared with those of other pulsars of comparable age and @xmath89 .",
    "if similar pulsars have similar wind properties , this suggests differing environments and/or space velocities .",
    "caution is of course required given the systematic uncertainties due to the distance model and poorly determined x - ray spectra",
    ".    improved spectral measurements and high spatial resolution x - ray imaging of the source may distinguish among the above possibilities .",
    "for the faint thermal remnant model or cases ( i ) and ( ii ) above , the emission should be spatially resolvable by _",
    "axaf_. for a high velocity pulsar , the shock apex distance would not be resolvable , but the swept back extended bow shock `` tail '' morphology might be apparent .",
