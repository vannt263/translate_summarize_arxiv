    "a good understanding of liquid flow in confined geometries is not only of fundamental interest , but also important for a number of industrial and technological processes , such as flow in porous media , electro - osmotic flow , particle aggregation or sedimentation , extrusion and lubrication .",
    "it is also essential for the design of micro- and nano - fluidic devices , e.  g. in lab - on - a - chip applications .",
    "however , in all these cases , an accurate quantitative description is only possible if the flow at the interface between the liquid and the solid is thoroughly understood .",
    "while for many years the so - called no - slip boundary condition ( relative velocity at the interface equal to zero ) had been successfully applied to describe macroscopic flows , more recent investigations revealed that this condition is insufficient to describe the physics when flows through channels with micro- and nano - sizes are considered @xcite . on such small scales , the relative contribution from a residual slip between liquid and solid becomes important .",
    "this is commonly described by the so - called slip boundary condition , which is characterized by a non - vanishing slip length @xmath1 , defined as the ratio of the liquid dynamic viscosity and the friction coefficient per unit area at the surface .",
    "an equivalent definition is obtained by taking the ratio of the finite surface flow velocity , the so - called slip velocity @xmath2 , and the shear rate at the surface : @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the spatial direction perpendicular to the surface , located at @xmath5 .",
    "this boundary condition is the most general one that is possible within the framework of standard hydrodynamics @xcite ; the no - slip condition is simply the special case @xmath6 .",
    "the experimental determination of the slip length , however , is challenging , since high resolution techniques are needed to gain sufficiently accurate information close to the interface .",
    "hence , the existence and the magnitude of slip in real physical systems , as well as its possible dependence on the surface properties , are highly debated in the community , and no consensus has been reached so far . clearly , a resolution of these controversies requires further improvement of the experimental techniques .    to date",
    ", two major types of experimental methods , often called direct and indirect , have been applied to study boundary slip phenomena . in the indirect approach , an atomic force microscope or a surface force apparatus",
    "is used to record the hydrodynamic drainage force necessary to push a micron - sized colloidal particle versus a flat surface as a function of their separation @xcite .",
    "the separation can be measured with sub - nanometric resolution , and the force with a resolution in the @xmath7 range .",
    "a high force is necessary to squeeze the liquid out of the gap if the mobility of the liquid is small .",
    "conversely , if the liquid close to the surface can easily slip on it , then a small force is necessary . from this empirical observation a quantitative value of the slip length",
    "can be deduced using an appropriate theoretical model @xcite .",
    "while this approach is extremely accurate at the nanoscale , it does not measure the flow profile directly .",
    "direct experimental approaches to flow profiling in microchannels are commonly based on various optical methods to monitor fluorescent tracers moving with the liquid .",
    "basically they can be divided into two sub - categories .",
    "the imaging - based methods use high - resolution optical microscopes and sensitive cameras to track the movement of individual tracer particles via a series of images .",
    "while providing a real `` picture '' of the flow , the imaging methods have also some disadvantages related mainly to the limited speed and sensitivity of the cameras : relatively big tracers are needed , the statistics is rather poor , and large tracer velocities can not be easily measured .    in the fluorescence correlation spectroscopy ( fcs ) based methods the fluctuations of the fluorescent light emitted by tracers passing through a small observation volume ( typically the focus of a confocal microscope ) are measured @xcite . using correlation analysis and an appropriate mathematical model the tracers diffusion coefficient and flow velocity can be evaluated @xcite .",
    "in particular , the so - called double - focus fluorescence cross - correlation spectroscopy ( df - fccs ) that employs two observation volumes ( laterally shifted in flow direction ) is a powerful tool for flow profiling in microchannels @xcite . due to the high sensitivity and speed of the used photo detectors ( typically avalanche photodiodes ) in the fcs",
    "based methods even single molecules can be used as tracers .",
    "furthermore , the evaluation of the velocity is based on large statistics and high tracer velocities can be measured .    during the last two decades both the imaging and the fcs methods were well developed to the current state that allows fast and accurate measurements of flow velocity profiles in microchannels .",
    "the situation , however , is different when the issue of boundary slip is considered . due to the limited optical resolution imposed by the diffraction limit , it is commonly believed that these methods are less accurate than the force methods discussed above and can not detect a slip length in the tens of nanometers range . on the other hand , the possibility to directly visualize the flow makes the optical methods still attractive and thus continuous efforts were undertaken to improve their resolution .",
    "one of the most successful approaches in this endeavor is total internal reflection microscopy ( tirm ) @xcite , which uses total internal reflection at the interface between two media with different refractive indices , like , e.  g. , glass and water .",
    "this creates an evanescent wave that extends into the liquid in a tunable region of less than @xmath8 from the interface .",
    "optical excitation of the fluorescent tracers is then possible only within this narrow region . during the last few years tirm",
    "was successfully applied to improve the resolution of particle imaging velocimetry close to liquid - solid interfaces , and slip lengths in the order of tens of nanometers were evaluated . with respect to fcs , however , tir illumination had , until recently , been limited to diffusion studies only @xcite , while there were no reports on tir - fcs based velocimetry and slip length measurements .    with this in mind ,",
    "we have recently developed a new experimental setup that combines for the first time tir illumination with df - fccs for monitoring a liquid flow in the close proximity of a solid surface @xcite .",
    "such a combination offers high normal resolution , extreme sensitivity ( down to single molecules ) , good statistics within relatively short measurement times and the possibility to study fast flows .",
    "our preliminary studies have shown , however , that the accurate quantitative evaluation of the experimental data obtained with this tir - fccs setup is not straightforward because the model functions needed to fit the auto- and cross - correlation curves ( and extract the flow velocity profile ) are not readily available .",
    "the standard analytical procedure to derive these functions is @xcite : ( i ) solve the convection - diffusion equation with respect to the concentration correlation function , ( ii ) insert the derived solution in the corresponding correlation integral and ( iii ) solve it to finally get the explicit form of the correlation functions .",
    "this procedure was successfully used by brinkmeier et al . @xcite to derive analytical expressions for the auto- and cross - correlation functions obtained with double focus confocal fccs ( i.  e. with focused laser beam illumination as opposed to the evanescent wave illumination in our case ) , where it was assumed that the flow velocity and tracer concentration are spatially constant , which simplifies the calculation substantially .",
    "such an assumption is reasonable if the observation volumes ( laser foci ) are far away from the channel walls , in the same distance . in the case of tir - fccs",
    ", however , the situation is different : the experiments are performed in the proximity of the channel wall and the distribution of the flow velocity inside the observation volume has to be considered .",
    "furthermore , the concentration of tracers may also depend on @xmath4 due to electrostatic repulsion or hydrodynamic effects .",
    "finally the presence of a boundary , which must also be taken into account in the theoretical treatment , further complicates the problem .",
    "therefore , a faithful description of the physics of tir - fccs makes the problem of calculating the correlation functions ( rather likely ) unsolvable in terms of closed analytical expressions .    for this reason ,",
    "we rather resort to numerical methods , and in the present paper describe and test the procedure that we have developed : we employ brownian dynamics techniques to simulate the tracers motion through the observation volumes and generate `` numerical '' auto- and cross - correlation curves that are consequently used to fit the corresponding experimental data .",
    "this fitting is done via monte carlo importance sampling in parameter space .",
    "the method is therefore fully quantitative , while not being hampered by any difficulties in doing analytical calculations .",
    "it should be noted that this approach also provides a substantial amount of flexibility : the details of the physical model are all encoded in the brownian dynamics simulation which specifies how the tracer particles move within the flow . in the present work",
    "we have assumed a simple couette flow with a finite slip length , while the particles are described as simple hard spheres with no rotational degree of freedom , and no interaction with the wall except impenetrability .",
    "it is fairly straightforward to improve on these limitations , by , e.  g. , including hydrodynamic and electrostatic interactions with the wall , rotational motion of the spheres , or polydispersity in the particle size distribution .",
    "moreover , the geometry of the observation volumes can be easily changed as well , and we have made use of this possibility in our present work , but only to some extent .",
    "further refinements are left for future work , in which the basic methodology would however remain unchanged .    to test the accuracy of the newly developed tir - fccs experimental setup and the numerical data evaluation procedure , we have studied aqueous flow near a smooth hydrophilic surface and evaluated the slip length to be between @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( however with a systematic error that is hard to quantify , and whose elimination would need a more sophisticated theoretical model ) .",
    "it is commonly accepted that the boundary slip should be zero ( or very small ) in this situation .",
    "thus , our results indicate that tir - fccs offers unprecedented accuracy in the @xmath0 range for the measurement of slip lengths by an optical method .",
    "we believe that our result for the slip length will be fairly robust , even if the physical model is refined further .",
    "section [ sec : exp ] outlines the experimental setup , while sec .",
    "[ sec : exp_corrfunc ] presents the experimental results and the numerical fits .",
    "we find that the measured cross - correlation functions deviate considerably from the model functions at short times , probably as a result of some optical effects which at present we do not fully understand .",

    "a scheme of the experimental setup is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tir - fccs setup ] .",
    "it is based on a commercial device ( carl zeiss , jena , germany ) that consists of the fcs module confocor2 and an inverted microscope axiovert 200 .",
    "the tir illumination is achieved by focusing the excitation laser beam ( @xmath13 , ar@xmath14 laser ) on the periphery of the back focal plane ( bfp ) of an oil immersion microscope objective with numerical aperture @xmath15 .",
    "this leads to a parallel laser beam which emerges out of the objective and then enters the rectangular flow channel through its bottom wall ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tir - fccs setup ] ) . by adjusting the angle of incidence above the critical angle ( @xmath16 for the glass - water interface )",
    "total internal reflection is achieved . in this situation",
    "only an evanescent wave extends into the liquid and can excite the fluorescent tracers suspended in it .",
    "the intensity distribution of this wave in the @xmath11-@xmath12-plane ( parallel to the interface ) is gaussian with a diameter of @xmath17 ( at @xmath18 ) . in the @xmath4 direction",
    "the intensity decays exponentially , @xmath19 .",
    "the characteristic decay length @xmath20 , also called penetration depth , depends on the laser wavelength @xmath21 , the refraction indices of both media ( @xmath22 - glass , @xmath23 - water ) and can be varied in the range @xmath24 by changing the angle of incidence . thus the evanescent wave can excite only the tracers flowing in the proximity of the channel wall .",
    "the produced fluorescence light is collected by the same microscope objective and is equally divided by passing through a neutral @xmath25 beam splitter to enter two independent detection channels . in each channel",
    "the fluorescent light passes through an emission filter and a confocal pinhole to finally reach the detectors , two single photon counting avalanche photodiodes ( apd1 , apd2 ) .",

    "the root - mean - square roughness of the glass surface was in the range of @xmath36 and the water advancing contact angle below @xmath37 ( hydrophilic surface ) .",
    "the flow was induced by a hydrostatic pressure gradient , created by two beakers of different heights , where the water level difference was kept constant by a pump .",
    "this allowed us to vary the shear rate near the wall in the range @xmath38 .",
    "carboxylate - modified quantum dots ( qdot585 itk carboxyl , molecular probes , inc . ) , with a hydrodynamic radius @xmath39 , were used as fluorescent tracers .",
    "the particles were suspended in an aqueous solution of potassium phosphate ( @xmath40 ) buffer ( @xmath41 , concentration @xmath42 ) .",
    "the concentration of the quantum dots was found from our data analysis ( see below ) as @xmath43 , corresponding to roughly @xmath44 particles per @xmath45 .",
    "the motion of the fluorescence tracers results in two time - resolved fluorescence intensities @xmath46 and @xmath47 , which were measured with the two photo detectors . for the present system",
    ", we may safely assume that it is ergodic and strictly stationary on the time scale of the experiment , such that only time differences matter @xcite .",
    "therefore , we may define the intensity fluctuations via @xmath48 where @xmath49 denotes a time average or , equivalently , an ensemble average , and evaluate the time - dependent auto- and cross - correlation functions via the definition @xmath50 it should be noted that possible small differences in the sensitivity of the photo detectors or in the illumination of the pinholes cancel out , since in eq .",

    "it should be noted that in the presence of flow @xmath55 and @xmath56 differ substantially . in the limit of the two pinholes being located at the same position ,",
    "the intensities @xmath57 and @xmath58 coincide , such that in this case all four entries of the matrix @xmath59 are identical .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     clearly , the @xmath1 values of fig .",
    "[ fig : mc slip vs shear ] could only be viewed as definitive experimental results on @xmath1 if the agreement between experiment and model were perfect , with @xmath60 , and a good fit of _ all _ correlation functions .",
    "the reasons for the observed deviations are not completely clear ; however , all our findings hint very strongly to deficiencies in the description of the observation volumes , i.  e. too inaccurate modeling of the detailed optical phenomena that finally give rise to the shape of these functions .",
    "nevertheless , one should also bear in mind that the dynamic model is also rather simple , neglecting both hydrodynamic and residual electrostatic interactions with the wall . while one must expect that further refinements of the model will change both the @xmath1 values as well as their error bars",
    ", we believe that it is not probable that such a change would be huge .",
    "given all the various systematic uncertainties of the modeling , we would , in view of our data , not exclude a vanishing slip length , while we consider a value substantially larger than , say , @xmath61 as fairly unlikely .",
    "let us conclude this section by a few more remarks concerning our choice of parameters and the systematic errors of the method . from the setup it is clear that there are three parameters that can be varied experimentally fairly easily",
    " these are the shear rate @xmath62 , the penetration depth @xmath20 , and the effective pinhole - pinhole distance in sample space , @xmath26 .",
    "the choice of parameters was governed by various experimental considerations , which we will attempt to explain in what follows .",
    "it is clear that one wants a fairly large shear rate @xmath63 , in order to ensure that the signal has a sizeable contribution from flow effects . in practice , however , increasing @xmath63 further by a substantial amount is limited by experimental constraints , such as channel construction , beaker elevation , etc .",
    "furthermore , the choice of @xmath20 is subject to similarly severe experimental constraints : increasing @xmath20 substantially would mean that we would approach the limit angle of total reflection closely , which would result in a very inaccurate a priori estimate of @xmath20 .",
    "on the other hand , an even smaller penetration depth value would be too close to the limits of the capabilities of the objective , resulting in possible optical distortion effects which we would like to avoid .",
    "finally , the choice of @xmath26 was governed by our early attempts to suppress overlap effects by simply picking a fairly large value , such that the overlap integral is small .",
    "there are however two problems about such an idea .",
    "firstly , a large value of @xmath26 decreases not only the overlap , but also the cross - correlation function as a whole @xcite , such that it ultimately becomes impossible to sample the data with sufficient statistical accuracy on the time scale on which we can confidently keep the experimental conditions stable .",
    "our value of @xmath26 should therefore be viewed as limited by such considerations .",
    "however , secondly , and more importantly , we realized in the course of our analysis that the overlap issue is _ not _ a problem of an unintelligent choice of parameters at all , but rather of our insufficient theoretical modeling of the mde functions .",
    "as we have seen above , our results for the slip length depend rather sensitively and fairly substantially on the choice of the mde function ( up to nearly a factor of two ) . in our opinion",
    ", there is no reason to assume that this dependence would go away if we had picked parameters in a regime of small or vanishing overlap .",
    "from this perspective , we view the overlap essentially as a blessing , since it shows us where the main source of systematic error is probably located .    in the light of these remarks",
    ", it would of course be interesting to systematically investigate the influence of the parameters @xmath20 and @xmath26 on our results . in terms of the correlation functions as such ,",
    "this has been done in ref .",
    "@xcite , and we refer the interested reader to that paper .",
    "however , doing the full analysis for a whole host of parameters would imply a very substantial amount of work , since all the experimental curves would have to be re - sampled again , in order to meet the rather stringent requirement of statistical accuracy that is built into our approach .",
    "we have hence not attempted to do this , but rather believe that it will be more fruitful to concentrate the efforts of future work on attempts to improve the theoretical mde modelling , even if that will be challenging .",
    "as far as the slip length is concerned , one must of course expect that the fitted value will depend on parameters such as @xmath20 and @xmath26 , but only to the extent that this reflects the systematic error  if the physics were modeled perfectly correctly , we would of course always obtain the same value .",
    "the results from the previous sections demonstrate that the method of tir - fccs in combination with the presented brownian dynamics and monte carlo based data analysis is in principle a very powerful tool for the analysis of hydrodynamic effects near solid - liquid interfaces . already within the investigated simple model of the present paper",
    ", we can conclude that the slip length at our hydrophilic surface is not more than @xmath0 .",
    "it was only the data processing via the brownian dynamics / monte carlo analysis that was able to demonstrate how highly sensitive and accurate tir - fccs is .",
    "the computational method has the advantage to be easily extensible to include more complex effects .",
    "for example , the hydrodynamic interactions of the particles with the wall would cause an anisotropy in the diffusion tensor @xcite and a @xmath4 dependence , electrostatic interactions would give rise to an additional force term in the langevin equation , while polydispersity could be investigated by randomizing the particle size and the diffusion properties according to a given distribution .",
    "while these contributions are expected to yield a further improvement of the method , this was not attempted here , and is rather left to future investigations .",
    "however , we have also identified the inaccuracies in modeling the observation volumes as ( most probably ) _ the _ main bottleneck in finding good agreement between theory and experiment , i.  e. , at present , as the main source of systematic errors , which makes it difficult to find a fully reliable error bound on the value of the slip length .",
    "conversely , the problem of dealing with statistical errors can be considered as solved . for an extensive data analysis , as it has been presented here , one may need a supercomputer in order to obtain highly accurate results in fairly short time . nevertheless , the method will yield meaningful results even if confined to just a single modern desktop computer .",
    "given the moderate amount of computer time on a high - performance machine , one should expect that quite accurate data should be obtainable within reasonable times by making use of the powerful newly emerging gpgpu cards .    in our opinion ,",
    "the presented method is a conceptually simple and widely applicable approach to process tir - fccs data , that is clearly only limited by inaccurate modeling .",
    "we believe that it has the potential to become the standard and general tool to process such data , in particular as soon as the optics is understood in better detail .",
    "the principle as such is applicable to all kinds of correlation techniques , such as fcs / tir - fcs etc . , and we think it is the method of choice whenever one investigates a system whose complexity is beyond analytical treatment .",
    "the flow profile throughout the height of the microchannel was measured by single - focus fcs under the same conditions as the tir - fccs experiments ; the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hphil flow profile ] . from a fit via a poiseuille profile ( solid line ) , we obtained an independent estimator for the shear rate near the wall , @xmath64 .",
    "the purpose of this appendix is to analyze the theoretical background of this fit in some more detail . for a pure poiseuille flow , i.  e. a simple parabolic profile ,",
    "it is clear that the shear rate at the surface does not depend on the slip length @xmath1 , because in this case a finite @xmath1 value simply shifts the profile by a constant amount .",
    "therefore , in this case @xmath1 is indeed irrelevant for the fit .",
    "a short discussion on such issues is also found in ref .",
    "@xcite , and experimentally @xcite it is also known that typically the shift is so small that a finite slip length is hard to detect by direct measurements of the profile . however , from a theoretical and quantitative point of view it is not quite clear how well it is justified to assume a strictly parabolic profile , i.  e. to assume that the flow extends infinitely in @xmath12 direction  in our experiments , @xmath66 , which is large but not infinite . for finite values of @xmath67 ,",
    "the profile is somewhat distorted , and if this distortion is sufficiently large , then also a possible effect of @xmath1 should be taken into account .",
    "these questions can be easily answered by solving the flow problem in a rectangular channel in the presence of slip exactly , and this shall be done in what follows .",
    "the result of this analysis will be that for our conditions the distortion of the profile is indeed completely negligible , and that therefore @xmath1 needs not be taken into account either .",
    "we start by considering the stokes equation @xmath68 in a rectangular channel with dimensions @xmath69 \\times [ - l_z / 2 , l_z / 2]$ ] in the @xmath70-plane , as in the experiment . here , @xmath71 is the viscosity of the liquid and @xmath72 is the driving force density or pressure gradient acting on the liquid in @xmath11-direction .",
    "we assume that all surfaces have the same slip length .    for the case of a no - slip boundary condition",
    ", the solution has been given in the textbook of spurk and aksel @xcite , however in a form that does not explicitly spell out the symmetry under exchange of @xmath12 and @xmath4 .",
    "here we give the solution in a form that shows that symmetry , and generalize it to the case of a nonvanishing slip length @xmath1 .    using the methods and notation of quantum mechanics , and allowing for some minor amount of numerics to evaluate a series , the solution is simple and straightforward .",
    "we identify a function @xmath73 with a vector @xmath74 in a hilbert space , and define the scalar product as @xmath75 defining a `` hamilton operator '' via @xmath76 the stokes equation is written as @xmath77 obviously , the functions @xmath78 with @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81^{-1/2 } \\\\ & \\times & \\left [ \\frac{l_z}{2 } + \\frac{\\sin ( k_z l_z)}{2 k_z } \\right]^{-1/2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] are normalized eigenfunctions of @xmath82 , @xmath83 with @xmath84            which , in the general case , can be found numerically . in the no - slip case ,",
    "the solutions are simply given by @xmath89 and analogously for @xmath87 .",
