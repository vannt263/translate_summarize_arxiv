    "study of unstable nuclei has been one of the major subjects in nuclear physics for a couple of decades .",
    "collective mode of excitation emerged in the response of the nucleus to an external field is a manifestation of the interaction among nucleons .",
    "thus , the spin - isospin channel of the interaction or the spin - isospin part of the energy - density functional ( edf ) , which is crusial for understanding and predicting the properties of unstable nuclei and asymmetric nuclear matter , has been much studied through especially the gamow - teller ( gt ) strength distributions  @xcite .",
    "the gt strength distribution has been extensively investigated experimentally and theoretically not only because of interests in nuclear structure but also because @xmath1-decay half lives set a time scale of the rapid - neutron - capture process ( @xmath5-process ) , and hence determine the production of heavy elements in the universe  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath5-process path is far away from the stability line , and involves neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "they are weakly bound and many of them are expected to be deformed according to the systematic skyrme - edf calculation  @xcite .",
    "collective modes of spin - isospin excitation in nuclei are described microscopically by the proton - neutron random - phase approximation ( pnrpa ) or the proton - neutron quasiparticle - rpa ( pnqrpa ) including the pairing correlations on top of the self - consistent hartree - fock ( hf ) or hf - bogoliubov ( hfb ) mean fields employing the nuclear edf .",
    "there have been many attempts to investigate the spin - isospin modes of excitation in stable and unstable nuclei  @xcite .",
    "these studies are largely restricted to spherical systems , and the collective modes in deformed nuclei remain mostly unexplored .    the spin - isospin responses of deformed nuclei have been extensively investigated by the madrid group  @xcite in connection to the studies of beta decay and double - beta decay in a skyrme - pnqrpa model .",
    "the method employed in these preceding works relies on the bcs pairing instead of the hfb pairing , and the residual interactions are treated in a separable approximation .",
    "the bcs approximation for pairing is inappropriate for describing the weakly bound nuclei due to the unphysical nucleon gas problem  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , collectivity and details of the strength distribution are sensitive to both the shell structure around the fermi levels and the residual interactions . quite recently , in ref .",

    "compared to the gtgr , the low - lying gt strength distribution is affected appreciably by the @xmath2 pairing interaction due to the following mechanism showing up from the structure of the matrix elements of the pnqrpa hamiltonian ( [ a_matrix_qrpa ] ) and ( [ b_matrix_qrpa ] ) .",
    "the proton orbitals around the fermi level are partially occupied due to the @xmath3 pairing correlations .",
    "thus , the neutrons in the hole(-like ) orbital can have a chance to decay into the proton orbitals through the p - h residual interaction and the @xmath2 p - p interaction simultaneously . similarly , when the neutrons are paired , the neutrons around the fermi level can decay to protons in the particle(-like ) orbitals through the p - h and p - p residual interactions .",

    "therefore , the the low - lying mode in @xmath94zr calculated with sly4 is dominantly a p - h type excitation and the p - p residual interaction does not play a significant role .    from this analysis , we come to the following conclusion : the number of 2qp excitations generating the low - lying mode is small in the zr isotopes under consideration .",
    "the @xmath188 state possessing an appreciable strength is generated by mainly a 2qp excitation satisfying the selection rule ( [ sele_rule ] ) .",

    "@xcite , while it overestimates the half lives of the lighter zr isotopes .",
    "a good reproduction of the half lives in the @xmath218 region may be due to the presence of the low - lying strengths .",
    "our calculations , in particular employing sly4 , reproduce well the observed half lives systematically in @xmath4zr .",
    "the low - lying gt strengths relevant to the @xmath1-decay rate are a quite delicate quantity because they emerge as a consequence of cancellation between a repulsive p - h residual interaction and an attractive @xmath2 pairing interaction , both of which are largely uncertain in a nuclear edf method .",
    "we need a more reliable edf together with the proton - neutron pairing interaction that is able to describe well the spin - isospin excitations systematically in order to make further steps toward a self - consistent and systematic description of @xmath1-decay of nuclei involved in the @xmath5-process nucleosynthesis .",
    "a virtue of our new framework developed in the present article is that it is suitable for a systematic calculation of the spin - isospin responses of nuclei because it is applicable to a nucleus with an arbitrary mass number whichever it is spherical or deformed , deeply bound or weakly bound in a reasonable calculation time with a help of the massively parallel computers , once the edf and the proton - neutron pairing interaction are given . through the systematic calculations employing several parameter sets of interaction and their comparison with available experimental data or observations , we can put constraints on the spin - isospin part of the new edf and the proton - neutron pairing interaction .",
    "then , we can proceed to a more reliable calculation .",
    "we have developed the fully - self - consistent framework to calculate the spin - isospin collective modes of excitation in nuclei using the skyrme edf .",
    "we solve the deformed hfb equations on a grid in coordinate space .",
    "this enables us to investigate the excitation modes in nuclei off the stability line with an arbitrary mass .",
    "numerical applications have been performed for the gamow - teller excitation in the deformed neutron - rich zr isotopes .",
    "we found a small amount of fragmentation due to deformation in the gt transition - strength distribution .",
    "the momentum - dependent terms in the p - h residual interaction play an important role in generating the collectivity .",
    "an attractive @xmath2 pairing interaction has little influence on the energy of the gt giant resonance , while lowers the energies and enhances the gt strengths in the low energy region .",
    "the effect of the @xmath2 pairing interaction in the low - lying mode depends sensitively on the location of the fermi level of neutrons .",
    "@xmath1-decay rates depend primarily on the @xmath127 value , the residual interactions for both the p - h and the p - p channels , and the shell structures .",
    "the framework developed in this article treats self - consistently these key ingredients on the same footing .",
    "once the strength of the @xmath2 pairing interaction is determined so as to reproduce the observed @xmath1-decay half - life of @xmath74zr , our calculation scheme produces well the isotopic dependence of the half lives up to @xmath94zr as was recently observed at riken ribf .",
    "systematic calculations with the hfb + pnqrpa for nuclei in a whole nuclear chart help us not only to understand and to predict new types of collective modes of excitation in unstable nuclei , and to provide the microscopic inputs for the astrophysical simulation but also to shed light on the nuclear edf of new generations .    the author thanks p.  sarriguren for providing him with the gt strength distributions to be compared .",
