    "the challenge of understanding the origin of high temperature superconductivity in the cuprates stems from the complicated interplay of differing orders and phenomena believed to exist .",
    "the goal of this article is to focus on one such phenomenon , the role of the lattice coupling to electronic states .",
    "though historically significant in conventional superconductivity , it has only lately been receiving attention as a potentially important player in the physics of the cuprate phase diagram . over the course of this article",
    ", we will be addressing the following areas : 1 ) how angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) can be used to probe and better understand electron self - energy effects .",
    "2 ) a brief history of the arpes `` kink '' seen in the cuprates and how both the energy scale it defines and its ubiquity in these systems open the door to continued debate over low energy excitations .",

    "4 ) recent work mapping phonon dispersion and relating it to arpes data to underscore how phonon mode nesting may relate to the observed kink .",
    "5 ) a survey of recent and ongoing work examining the role lattice strain may play in understanding electron - phonon coupling and potentially the larger phase diagram . thus",
    ", our goal in this review is not to argue how much significance the lattice has to the development of high temperature superconductivity , but rather the ways in which we find it manifesting within these systems .",
    "the use of arpes to study electron - phonon coupling could be seen as the union of two different approaches to the study of phonons .",
    "first , and perhaps most obvious , is the mapping of phonon dispersions using inelastic scattering techniques such as inelastic neutron or x - ray scattering .",
    "this momentum space perspective is generally the most intuitive manner for understanding phonon modes within the lattice .",
    "still , if we are seeking information about how electronic states interact with phonons , it is , at best , an indirect technique .",
    "historically , tunneling measurements such as those done on conventional superconductors , such as pb @xcite , have provided insight into how electron - phonon coupling directly affects electronic states near the fermi energy e@xmath0 . the previously unexpected features seen in the spectra were then able to be explained within a strong coupling form of migdal - eliashberg theory @xcite .",
    "still , to be able to have both the direct information of how phonon modes affect electronic states yet seen within a momentum space perspective , requires a different approach , an approach that arpes is well - suited to offer .      over the last decade",
    ", arpes has become a truly unique experimental probe with an ever growing number of publications in the field of correlated electronic systems .",
    "its central ability to directly probe the single particle spectral function , @xmath1 , makes its experimental insights highly sought after by condensed matter theorists . with angular resolution approaching 0.1@xmath2 , a steadily improving energy resolution exceeding 1mev , as well as numerous experimental advances involving highly localized beam spots ( nano - arpes ) , spin resolution , and laser - based pump - probe experiments",
    ", arpes continues to be and will likely remain on the cutting edge of experimental solid state physics .",
    "because of the central role that it plays in the work described in this review , we will begin with a brief overview of the theory of arpes , with an emphasis on the analytical techniques which are critical for studying systems such as the high t@xmath3 cuprates .",
    "it is customary to write the arpes photocurrent intensity , @xmath4 , as @xmath5 where @xmath1 is the crucial single particle spectral function , i.e.  the imaginary part of the single particle green s function , @xmath6 with * k * referring to the crystal momentum , while @xmath7 is energy relative to the chemical potential . modifying the spectral function",
    ", @xmath8 is the matrix element associated with the transition from the initial to final electronic state which can be affected by such things as incident photon energy and polarization as well as the brillouin zone ( bz ) of the photoemitted electrons .",
    "finally , @xmath9 is the fermi - dirac function indicating that only filled electronic states can be accessed . because of the temperature scales used for data in this review",
    ", we will not distinguish between the chemical potential and the fermi energy , @xmath10 , which should match at @xmath11 for conductors .",
    "since arpes measures the electron removal part of @xmath1 , we use high and low energy to refer to large and small negative @xmath7 value , respectively .",
    "( additionally ,  binding energy\" and ` energy ' are often used for the same axis in figures , differing by a minus sign . ) as a final point , one might find the contribution of the matrix element @xmath8 in eq .",
    "[ eq - ikw ] a serious issue to an accurate interpretation of @xmath1 from @xmath4 . in practice ,",
    "the @xmath7 dependence is small over an energy range of order 0.1 ev while the * k * dependence of @xmath8 , though important to consider , is reasonably understood by the arpes cuprate community for the range of the data presented here .    of particular importance to our exploration of bosonic mode coupling",
    "is how electron self - energy effects appear in our arpes analysis .",
    "this is nicely done by introducing the electron proper self - energy @xmath12 = re@xmath13(*k * , @xmath7 ) + @xmath14 im@xmath13(*k * , @xmath7 ) which contains all the information on electron energy renormalization and lifetime .",
    "this leads to the green s and spectral functions given in terms of the electron self energy @xmath12",
    "@xmath15    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the single electron band energy , often referred to as the bare band structure .",
    "finally , causality requires that @xmath18 and @xmath19 are connected to each other by the kramers - kronig relation .    with advancements in the late 1990 s , the unit information of an arpes experiment consists of a two dimensional intensity map of binding energy and momentum along a `` cut '' though momentum space .",
    "these two dimensional maps offer us two natural and complementary methods for analysis .",
    "first , one can hold the energy value of the electronic states studied fixed and observe the photoemission intensity as a function of momentum , a momentum distribution curve ( mdc ) .",
    "similarly , one can fix the momentum space position and observe photoemission intensity as a function of energy at that momentum value , an energy distribution curve ( edc ) .",
    "these two methods constitute the core techniques for analysis of the spectral function @xmath1 using arpes .    within our review , ``",
    "mdc analysis '' refers to the method of fitting lorentzian distributions to features in the mdcs as is commonly done in the field .",
    "this method of analysis has been very successful and can be understood based on some basic conditions , specifically the condition of `` local '' linearity in both the self energy @xmath12 and @xmath17 . in order for each mdc at a given energy @xmath7 to be described with a lorentzian function , both @xmath12 and @xmath17 need to be linear within the narrow energy and momentum range corresponding to the width of the analyzed peak .",
    "this condition is expected to generally hold since both @xmath12 and @xmath17 are able to be expanded using simple taylor expansions in the following way :    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the peak position of the mdc at @xmath7 and @xmath22_{k = k_p(\\omega)}$ ] . plugging in these expressions into eq .",
    "[ eq - akw ] , we obtain the following equations : @xmath23 \\label { eq - ims - mdc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    it is worth noting that we need not make the standard assumption of momentum independence of @xmath12 for these results to be valid . this is important since momentum dependence does exist for states away from the nodal cut ( the diagonal direction to the cu - o bonds . )",
    "it is the last two equations which provide us with a precise meaning for @xmath24 and @xmath25 as determined in the mdc analysis and , thus , our determination of @xmath12 from arpes .",
    "[ eq - res - mdc ] demonstrates that a reasonable assumption for @xmath17 is needed to determine @xmath26 while @xmath27 presents the additional challenge of requiring the derivative @xmath28 .",
    "this is further complicated since though @xmath12 is a causal function for a _ fixed _ * k * value , @xmath29 is not .",
    "thus , one can not invoke the kramers - kronig relation to relate real and imaginary parts .",
    "nevertheless , so long as these considerations are kept in mind to prevent over - interpretation , qualitatively @xmath25 and @xmath24 do offer access to the causal @xmath12 since important structures such as the arpes kink appear in both self - energies .    before the instrumental advances which pushed the unit information of arpes towards a two dimensional map ,",
    "one - dimensional data was taken , making edc analysis the more traditional method . indeed , there are many advantages of this line of analysis : 1 ) fixed momentum helps simplify the matrix element contribution to the photocurrent .",
    "2 ) momentum is a good quantum number in a single crystal approximation making the edc a more physical quantity , opening up spectral weight sum rules , as well as providing a clear physical meaning to the dispersion of edc peaks .",
    "3 ) in principle , an edc analysis should be able to provide us with the causal @xmath12 throughout in the entire two dimensional plane rather than a particular path determined by @xmath21 in the plane as with mdc analysis . however , edc analysis is uniquely complicated by contributions from the fermi function cutoff , @xmath9 , as well as both elastic and inelastic photoelectron background .",
    "this leads to a challenging lineshape to analyze in practice .",
    "still , employing a similar method of taylor expansion analysis as used earlier , we can expand the self - energy locally near the edc peak yielding    @xmath30    where @xmath31 is the @xmath7-partial derivative of @xmath12 .",
    "like before , we can insert these expressions into eq .",
    "[ eq - akw ] getting the following relations in the vicinity of the peak , @xmath32    when we compare these with our results for mdc analysis , the complementary nature of these two approaches begins to appear . unlike the lorenzian lineshape of the mdcs ,",
    "the edc lineshape is modified by an asymmetry , which makes edc analysis less favorable for extracting self energy near e@xmath0 than mdc analysis .",
    "however , the spectra at large @xmath7 is better analyzed with edcs thanks to the spectral sum - rule requiring @xmath33 , leading us to consequently expect @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "this means that the portion of the spectral function which we associate with incoherent excitations should begin approaching a lorenzian lineshape and is better explored with edcs , although inelastic background contributions at higher energy remain important .",
    "in contrast , mdc s at higher energies begin to be affected by momentum dependent matrix element contributions as well as potential deviations of @xmath17 from a locally linear behavior .",
    "thus , with both tools in our arpes arsenal , we can undertake a more complete understanding of self - energy effects as they appear in @xmath1 .",

    "the different visualization methods used for each cut are designed to enhance some key characteristics of the arpes kink phenomenon prior to a more detailed , quantitative approach involving fittings .",
    "as labeled in the figure caption , the `` mdc map '' allows us to track the mdc dispersion and width .",

    "the color scaling is chosen to give the peak maximum and half maximum distinct colors , red and blue respectively .    from these maps",

    "2 ) an abrupt deviation in the electron dispersion around 70 mev below e@xmath0 ( large black arrow ) for both cuts . in both cuts , this corresponds to slower electron dispersion at lower energy while there is faster dispersion at higher energies above the 70mev energy scale .",
    "3 ) focusing particularly on the off - nodal cut , one sees evidence , even in the raw map , of an intensity decrease forming a local minimum at the 70mev energy scale .",
    "this lineshape , further enhanced by the edc map ( panel f ) , is known as a `` peak - dip - hump '' and is associated with the presence of self - energy effects due to the coupling of electrons with a bosonic mode leading to a redistribution of the spectral weight in the edc spectra .",
    "4 ) although one would expect quasi - particles in a landau fermi liquid paradigm to become sharper ( i.e. longer living ) as one approaches e@xmath0 , it is significant that the kink energy scale also marks a sudden change in coherence .",

    "a low energy kink of approximately 40mev near the antinodal region was reported for bi2212 @xcite . the disappearance of the kink above t@xmath3 and the decrease of its strength moving away from the antinodal region has led people to interpret the onset of this kink as coupling to collective magnetic excitations @xcite , despite the absence of these excitations for more heavily doped samples @xcite .",

    "the results presented so far clearly suggest that the electron - lattice coupling could not be so easily neglected in any microscopic theory of cuprate superconductivity . as discussed in section [ visualkink ] ,",

    "but with the ubiquitous cuprate kink seen by arpes , the importance of the lattice returns to the forefront .",

    "the question naturally arises , how is the ie on the arpes data affected by a change in doping ?",
    "panel a of fig .",
    "[ fig - ie - doping ] shows angle integrated photoemission data obtained on two samples at optimal doping ( x = 0.16 ) and one at slight over doping ( x = 0.18 ) . the effect is dramatic that given such a small change of only 2% , the ie , which normally shifts the ip position by @xmath60 30mev , is substantially reduced .",
    "this work was initially inspired by a separate study claiming not to see the ie in optimally doped samples of bi2212 @xcite .",
    "however , from superstructure analysis and studying the mdc dispersions , the samples discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite were actually slightly over doped .",
    "this doping dependence is intriguing but potentially puzzling given such sensitivity .",
    "still , work in other correlated electronic systems , such as the manganites , demonstrates that such a small doping change does cause a qualitative change in the electronic structure @xcite .",
    "thus , the ie has a strong sensitivity to optimal doping and , therefore , there exists a rapid change in the electron - lattice interaction near optimal doping .",
    "although the work of @xcite had proposed that the ie was not apparent from arpes on bi2212 , there are additional explanations that one could invoke to explain the presence of this subtle effect which are important to address .",
    "as we will show , all of these conventional explanations turn out to be inadequate . indeed , the strong temperature dependence by itself rules out all of the following explanations as possible candidates .",
    "still , this position can be made stronger when we consider only the large low temperature ie in light of the following scenarios .",
    "along the @xmath36-y nodal direction as seen from the inset .",
    "the peaks correspond to the intersection of the cut with the main fermi surface band ( @xmath50 ) as well as first - order superstructure reflections ( @xmath62 ) and a second - order reflection ( @xmath63@xmath64 ) .",
    "overlaid on top of the red curve is a thin grey line representing the @xmath47o curve shifted to model a 0.01 change in doping for comparison .",
    "panel ( a ) from ref .",
    "@xcite.,width=3 ]      as the previous section discussed , establishing the doping of our samples , particularly that their optimal doping has remained unchanged after the isotope substitution , is critical to establishing the veracity of our claims .",
    "doping level was preserved during the sample growth process by annealing the two samples ( @xmath47o and @xmath48o ) in the exactly same environment save the oxygen gas .",
    "yet , arpes on the cuprates provides us with in - situ signatures of the doping level and its consistency .",
    "most notably , one can use the fermi surface size to quite precisely determine doping level , taking advantage of the well - known superstructure reflections of the main hole band structure .",
    "using the nodal cut and making use particularly of the 2nd order reflection from the opposite side of the @xmath36 point , panel b of fig .",
    "[ fig - ie - doping ] shows the associated mdcs near e@xmath0 for three samples , including the re - substituted sample .",
    "all three curves have good agreement with respect to peak positions .",
    "of particular interest is the peak @xmath65 which is due to the 2nd order superstructure fermi surface replica from the opposite side of @xmath36 .",
    "this means any doping change in the sample will affect the distance between @xmath50 and @xmath65 twice as fast as the distance between @xmath50 and @xmath36 , while the distance between @xmath62 and @xmath50 remains fixed by the superstructure wavevector .",
    "this makes the distance between @xmath50 and @xmath65 a sensitive measure of doping change .",
    "in fact , plotted on top of the red @xmath48o curve is a grey curve modeling a doping change of 0.01 based on a tight binding fit . from looking at",
    "how the @xmath48o peak positions compare to this , it is clear that the uncertainty in doping value is well below 0.01 .",
    "however , one might be initially inclined to argue that the doping values between the two isotope samples are different based on the small difference in energy gap that has been previously reported @xcite which would explain the observed ie .",
    "but this argument loses its plausibility for a few reasons .",
    "first , examining the two sets of data we report @xcite , the difference in energy gap @xmath66 actually differed in sign , with an @xmath67 mev change for figure 1 of ref .",
    "@xcite and an @xmath68 mev change for figures 2,3 of ref .",
    "clearly , a empirically consistent change of gap is not obvious from our data .",
    "secondly , this becomes more evident over the many measurements ( @xmath69 ) we ve done finding the @xmath66 gap difference averaging to zero with a less than 1 mev difference , even while each individual value of @xmath70 or @xmath71 fluctuated by as much as @xmath72 mev .",
    "this was consistent with a typical uncertainty in the gap value from other sources at the time@xcite .",
    "thirdly , even if there were a consistently measured gap difference of 5 mev and this were taken to mean the doping values were different , it still does not explain the observed crossover behavior in fig .",
    "[ fig - ie - dispersiontemp ] .",
    "more quantitatively , the doping change implied by a difference of 5 mev in gap ( @xmath73 ) is not sufficient to explain the large ie we ve seen . with",
    "the associated doping change converted into shift in peak position at high energy , it corresponds to 5 mev for the nodal cut , and only 10 mev for the near - antinodal cut .",
    "so , these numbers not only have the same sign , but are off in magnitude by a factor of 3 to 4 . thus , doping considerations do not offer a convincing explanation of the observed ie .      another conventional explanation for our observed ie could be sample alignment since even a small misalignment could create an apparent difference in the observed dispersion",
    ". a careful examination led us to focus on two particular issues : the exact location of the @xmath36 point and the relative azimuthal orientation of samples with respect to each other .",
    "for the cuts 0 - 6 discussed here , we have found some evidence of deviations from our alignment based on the fermi surfaces @xmath50 , @xmath62 and @xmath65 as described in panel b of fig .",
    "[ fig - ie - doping ] .",
    "these slightly different momentum paths are indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig - misalignment - effect ] to give a sense of magnitude .",
    "however , we have found that , as panels b , c demonstrate , the expected difference in the dispersion , based again on our tight binding fit , is none for cut 0 and roughly about 4 times too small for our cut 6 when compared to our measured ie .",
    "it is also worth noting that the ie was reproduced for data taken with analyzer slits rotated 45@xmath2 with respect to this geometry , parallel to the my direction@xcite .",
    "this geometry has the advantage of being less sensitive to azimuthal tilting .",
    "thus , alignment issues are not a likely explanation for the observed data .",
    "( b - c ) tight binding model for the nodal and off nodal cuts respectively representing the expected variation in dispersion due to the misalignment.,width=3 ]      a final concern that should be considered is that a static lattice effect may be responsible for the large ie since there are no high quality structural studies to rely on for insight .",
    "however , when we consider differences in crystal structure for isotope exchanged lsco , they are only 0.1@xmath74 . given that a static structural effect is known to be more common in the lbco and lsco systems than the bismuth based cuprates",
    ", one may reasonably assume that static lattice effects are significantly small in the bi2212 cuprates and are an unlikely explanation for the observed ie .",

    "one would initially expect me theory to offer the best theoretical model of the observed arpes kink in this doping region of the phase diagram .",
    "however , in view of the discussion at the start of this section , it is not entirely obvious that me theory can be used to describe the broader incoherent spectral weight .",
    "this is a significant concern because of the prevalent use of me theory in the context of the arpes kink in the cuprates despite many experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite works indicating an interaction strength beyond this theory .",
    "so , in light of our work , we will distinguish between those aspects which clearly go beyond me theory as well as those more consistent with the theory .    to illustrate this former point , fig .",
    "[ fig - me - not - enough ] , begins by showing edcs for two cuts , a nodal(panel a ) and a near antinodal ( panel b ) . although subtle near the nodal point , there is a significant deviation between the @xmath47o ( or the re - substituted @xmath47o@xmath75 ) and the @xmath48o which is not effectively modeled within the expected change from me theory ( panel c ) and already mentioned previously in regards to the ie on arpes width .",
    "this certainly comes as no surprise since we already knew the behavior of the dispersion near the kink energy for the cuprate data was not well modeled by me as compared to the h / w data which better follows its predictions .",
    "this is again emphasized in fig .",
    "[ fig - me - not - enough - disp ] , where the ie on the mdc dispersions near the node and antinode ( panels a - b ) is much bigger when compared to the substantially smaller expected change from the me theory ( panel c ) as well as the aforementioned localization of the change to just near the kink energy . additionally , as again illustrated in fig .  [ fig - me - not - enough - disp ] , the presence of the momentum dependent sign change in the dispersion ( panels a - b ) would defy explanation by any simple application of me theory at least in the absence of an additional ordering phenomenon .",
    "fundamentally , the failure of the me theory has its origin in the single phonon loop approximation for the electron self - energy , resulting in a small ie , particularly at higher energy .",
    "this suggests to us that we need to increase the electron - phonon coupling in our model . to accomplish this",
    ", we employ a holstein model in the strong - coupling limit as described in ref .",
    "the resulting comparison of this small polaron theory to the data can be found in fig .",
    "[ fig - polaron ] .",

    "the expected broadening due to the phonon continuum and strong electron - electron interactions , the result , modeled in panel b , successfully reproduces the weaker ie for the low energy cp as well as the larger ie for the broader ip ( @xmath6030 ) .",
    "additionally , it produces an arpes linewidth which is more realistic .",
    "these results clearly indicate that the me theory is insufficient for describing the arpes data .",
    "however , it should be noted that this strong coupling theory used is not quite the right solution either . within the strong coupling theory ,",
    "the ip is not expected to have any dispersion while the cp is expected to be nearly non - dispersive as well .",
    "furthermore , it predicts a very small quasi - particle weight ( z@xmath77 0.1 ) for the cp ( panels c - d ) which is not observed .",
    "both of these issues are better modeled by me theory , so it is important to note that these shortcomings in the theory are overcome by weakening the interaction strength .",
    "this leads us to propose that the proper paradigm for understanding self - energy in the optimally doped cuprates is an intermediate regime . in this regime",
    ", there is a significant multi - phonon contribution to electron self - energy and both the cp and ip show strong dispersions .",
    "though one may have reasonably expected the ie to also weaken with diminished coupling , some studies @xcite show anomalous _ enhancement _ of the ie at intermediate couplings .",
    "nevertheless , the key message here is that as far as modeling the electron - phonon physics seen in ie , the me theory is not sufficient and that any subsequent theory must incorporate electron - phonon coupling with a strength beyond the me paradigm .",
    "with this renewed interest regarding the role of the lattice in the superconducting cuprates as seen by arpes , a natural direction to explore is to more carefully map the phonon dispersion in addition to that of the electron .",
    "a comparison of these dispersions can reveal particularly interesting physics such as when a phonon wavevector matches 2k@xmath0 , where k@xmath0 is the fermi momentum , leading to the well - known kohn anomaly .",
    "additional , nesting of the fermi surface in systems with particularly strong electron - lattice coupling can drive the formation of charge density waves .",

    "like other bismuth superconducting cuprates , the sample surfaces are high quality for arpes experiments . these samples have never shown any evidence of magnetic resonance modes , simplifying the comparison between arpes kink and scattering by removing a potentially additional bosonic mode to couple with the electrons .",

    "there are two aspects of these dispersions we wish to focus on in the context of this review .",
    "first , in agreement with the earlier work on la - bi2201 discussed in section [ ixs - and - arpes ] , we can observe a kink around 55 - 60mev which remains at that energy , for the most part , throughout the strain spectrum .",
    "however , what appears to change with strain is the electron - coupling constant , @xmath42 associated with the renormalization of these states .",
    "in the same manner as was done for the cuprate systems described in section [ ubi - nodal - kink ] , we can estimate @xmath42 for this mode , which is plotted in panel b. we find the strength of this mode appears enhanced by the increasing strain of the lattice mismatch with a generally linear behavior .",
    "equivalently , one can plot @xmath42 as a function of sample t@xmath3 ( panel b inset ) and , as one would expect , there is a negative , linear relationship between the superconducting t@xmath3 and strength of this phonon mode .",
    "secondly , we find that although it appears linear for the la - bi2201 at energies less than the 60mev kink , the more strained compounds appear to have additional rounding of the band structure nearer to e@xmath0 , most obvious in the highly strained eu - bi2201 .",
    "this mode appears to be around 25 - 30mev which could be important since this is closer to the mode energy observed near the antinodal point ( as discussed in section [ ubi - antinode - kink ] ) from the peak - dip - hump edc lineshape .",
    "we have also observed this from the kink in the mdc analysis beyond the nestable region of the ixs softened phonon mode in section [ ixs - and - arpes ] .",
    "as with the higher energy mode , we can attempt to extract the @xmath42 from this more elusive mode independent of the 60mev kink , the result of which is seen in panel c. unlike the higher energy mode which is apparent in all strain , this lower energy feature appears to turn on at the node only as strain is introduced , leading to a broadly linear relationship similar to the higher energy mode .",
    "the origin of this feature , remains mysterious , potentially related to an apical oxygen mode particularly in light of the location of the substituted lanthanide above the cu - o plane .",
    "these results are significant for at least three reasons .",
    "first , it has been a prevailing thought that the electronic states at the nodal point are uniquely unaware of the entry into the superconducting phase . with the d - wave symmetry of the gap function ,",
    "the nodal point states are the only electronic states which still cross through e@xmath0 with no gap opening .",
    "additionally , one could argue that the continued appearance of a sharp quasi - particle at the node is merely because these states are protected from the superconducting physics .",
    "however , clearly the affect of lattice strain can be seen on these states and the weakening of the superconducting state is present in the electronic dispersion of the nodal quasi - particles .",
    "secondly , one finds still additional evidence that the @xmath6060mev kink has its origin in the physics of the lattice .",
    "even more intriguing , the appearance and potential enhancement of the lower energy kink with lattice strain would tentatively suggest its origin also is somehow connected to the lattice ( such as the aforementioned apical oxygen mode ) and not merely a magnetic mode at the nodal point .",
    "it could be pointed out that the lanthanides do carry with them magnetic moments whose effect on the cu - o plane is far from understood . while la has no magnetic moment ,",
    "pr , nd , and eu all have experimentally determined magnetic moments of around 3.5@xmath89 @xcite . whether this may be related to the sudden appearance of this mode at the node for samples beyond la",
    "requires further study . finally , at least for the 60mev mode",
    ", one finds evidence that this phonon mode is somehow connected to the formation of the superconducting phase . from its behavior",
    ", it appears to be related to a competing order , associated with the lattice , which may be affecting the formation of the superfluid .",
    "throughout this work , the re - occurring theme has been the growing importance that the lattice and its coupling with electronic states has within the still mysterious phase diagram of the hole doped cuprates .",
    "beginning with the ubiquitous nodal kink and its likely origin in the bond stretching phonon mode , we have explored the effect of the lattice on both the coherent and incoherent parts of the near e@xmath0 electronic band structure through the ie .",
    "this has confirmed that , near optimal doping , the traditional me model must give way to a stronger electron - phonon coupling , yet still shy of a polaronic picture .",
    "we have traced out the dispersion of the bs phonon mode with ixs and have found its important connection to the arpes kink near the nodal point . from this , we find the electronic states within the bz can be divided up accordingly , with those nearest to the node ( often argued to be responsible for the superfluid ) uniquely impacted by the mode wavevector s ability to nest them . finally , the potential for understanding the role of the lattice via the additional axis of pressure / strain has already produced remarkable results for the evolution of the nodal electronic states and their self - energy along this axis as well as pointing towards additional insights . in all , our work has and continues to explore how the cuprate electronic structure is affected by electron - phonon coupling as yet another pillar in our nearly 25 year quest to construct a full understanding of this unconventional superconducting phase .",
