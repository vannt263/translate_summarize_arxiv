    "the left - right symmetric theory is based on the gauge group @xmath0 @xcite , times a left - right symmetry that may be generalized parity ( @xmath1 ) or charge conjugation ( @xmath2 ) ( for reviews see @xcite ) .",
    "it introduces three new heavy gauge bosons @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and the heavy neutrino states @xmath6 . in this model ,",
    "the maximally observed parity non conservation is a low energy phenomenon , which ought to disappear at energies above the @xmath7 mass .",
    "furthermore , the smallness of neutrino masses is related to the near maximality of parity violation @xcite , through the seesaw mechanism @xcite .",
    "theoretical bounds on the left - right scale were considered in the past .",
    "the small @xmath8 mass difference gives a lower bound on the left - right - scale of around 3 tev in the minimal model @xcite .",
    "more recently in @xcite , an updated study and a complete gauge invariant computation of the @xmath9 and @xmath10 meson parameters , gives @xmath11 tev for @xmath12 .",
    "in @xcite it is claimed that for parity as the left - right symmetry , the @xmath13 parameter , together with k - meson mass difference @xmath14 , push the mass of @xmath7 up to 20 tev @xcite ; however this depends on the uv completion of the theory .",
    "direct lhc searches , on the other hand , gives in some channels a lower bound of around @xmath15 tev @xcite .",
    "it turns out that there exists @xcite an exiting decay of @xmath7 into two charged leptons and two jets ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "we refer to it as the keung - senjanovi ( ks ) process .",
    "this process has a small background and no missing energy .",
    "it gives a clean signal for the @xmath7 production at lhc , as well as probing the majorana masses of the heavy neutrinos .",
    "since there is no missing energy in the decay , the reconstruction of the @xmath7 and @xmath6 invariant masses is possible .",
    "if true , the majorana mass of @xmath6 will lead to the decay of the heavy neutrino into a charged lepton and two jets ( @xmath17 ) , with the same probability of decaying into a lepton or antilepton .",
    "recetly cms gives and excess in the ee - channel of 2.8@xmath18 for this particular process at @xmath19tev @xcite .",
    "several works have been proposed @xcite in order to explain this excess and the conclusion was that it would need a higher left - right symmetry breaking scale , or a more general mixing scenario with pseudo - dirac heavy neutrinos .",
    "next lhc run will be crucial to establish or discard this excess .",
    "the production of @xmath7 is ensured at the lhc because in the quark sector the left and right mixing matrices are related . for @xmath2 as the left - right symmetry , the mixing angles are exactly equal , therefore the production rate of @xmath7 is the same as the one of @xmath20 .",
    "for @xmath1 the situation is more subtle and needed an in - depth study . finally in @xcite",
    "a simple analytic expression valid in the entire parameter space was derived for the right - handed quark mixing matrix .",
    "it turns out that despite parity being maximally broken in nature , the right and left quark mixing matrices end up being very similar .",
    "moreover the hypothesis of equal mixing angles can be tested at the lhc by studying the hadronic decays of @xmath7 @xcite .    in the leptonic sector",
    "the connection between the left and right leptonic mixing matrices goes away , since light and heavy neutrino masses are different . for @xmath2 as the left - right symmetry",
    ", the dirac masses of neutrinos are unambiguously determined in terms of the heavy and light neutrino masses @xcite .",
    "light neutrino masses are probed by low energy experiments , whereas the ones of the heavy neutrinos can be determined at the lhc .",
    "this is why the precise determination of the right - handed leptonic mixing matrix , the main topic of this work , is of fundamental importance .",
    "we focus on the determination of the elements of the leptonic mixing matrix @xmath21 at the lhc , through the ks process and the decays of the doubly - charged scalar @xmath22 belonging to the @xmath23 triplet .",
    "we point out that these two processes are not sensitive to three of the phases appearing in @xmath21 , unlike electric dipole moments of charged leptons .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we give a brief description of the model and the main relevant interactions for our purposes . in section 3",
    "we show the determination of the three mixing angles and the  dirac \" type phase appearing in @xmath21 .",
    "we do it in terms of physical observables in the ks process .",
    "we also show for @xmath2 as the left - right symmetry , how the branching ratios of the doubly charged scalar @xmath24 into @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 can be used to determine the majorana type phases .",
    "we consider for illustration the type ii see - saw dominance and put some representative values for the  dirac \" phase , the lightest and the heaviest right - handed neutrino masses .",
    "finally , we also show that the doubly charged scalars @xmath28 and @xmath24 may be distinguished at the lhc , without measuring the polarization of the charged leptons coming from their decays .",
    "the minimal left - right symmetric model @xcite is based on the gauge group @xmath29 , with an additional discrete symmetry that may be generalized parity ( @xmath1 ) or charge conjugation ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "quarks and leptons are assigned to be doublets in the following irreducible representations of the gauge group : @xmath30    @xmath31    @xmath6 represents the new heavy neutrino states , whose presence play a crucial role in explaining the smallness of the neutrino masses on the basis of the see - saw mechanism .",
    "the higgs sector sector @xcite consists in one bidoublet @xmath32 , in the ( 2,2,0 ) representation of @xmath33 , two scalar triplets @xmath34 and @xmath35 , belonging to ( 3,1,2 ) and ( 1,3,2 ) representation respectively @xmath36    under the discrete left - right symmetry the fields transform as follows :    @xmath37    where @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) are the gamma matrices and @xmath40 is the charge conjugation operator .",
    "lepton masses are due to the following yukawa interactions ( once the higgs fields take their v.e.v along their neutral components ) @xmath41 where @xmath42 , @xmath43 being the pauli matrix .",
    "invariance of the lagrangian under the left - right symmetry requires @xmath44    the v.e.vs of the higgs fields may be written as @xcite @xmath45    @xmath46    where @xmath47 and the neutrino masses take the see - saw form @xcite @xmath48 the charged lepton mass matrix is @xmath49 @xmath50 is called the `` spontaneous '' cp phase .",
    "all the physical effects due to @xmath51 can be neglected , since this phase is always accompanied by the small @xmath52 .    as usual",
    ", the mass matrices can be diagonalized by the biunitary transformations @xmath53 where @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 are diagonal matrices with real , positive eigenvalues .    in the mass eigenstate basis",
    "the flavor changing charged current lagrangian is @xmath57 @xmath58 and @xmath21 are the left and right leptonic mixing matrices respectively @xmath59    we may use the freedom of rephasing the charge lepton fields to remove three unphysical phases from @xmath58 , which ends up having 3 mixing angles and 3 phases .",
    "as it is well known , the mixing angles of this matrix are probed by low energy experiments .",
    "instead we focus in the precise determination of the mixing angles and phases of its right - handed analog ( @xmath21 ) at hadron colliders .",
    "this matrix @xmath21 has in general 3 different angles and 6 phases .",
    "we write it in the form @xmath60 where @xmath61 , @xmath62 and    @xmath63    @xmath64 is the short - hand notation for @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "the next relevant interactions for our discussion are the ones between the charged leptons and the doubly charged scalars @xmath67    if @xmath2 is the left - right symmetry , is easy to see from eqs . and that @xcite @xmath68    for parity ( @xmath1 ) the situation is different since for a non - zero spontaneous phase the charged lepton masses are not hermitian .",
    "then after the symmetry breaking , one would expect that the left and right yukawa interactions with the doubly - charged scalar are not the same .",
    "it turns out that for right - handed neutrinos masses accessible at the lhc , the charged lepton mass matrices end up being quite hermitian @xcite .",
    "let us notice that it implies that yukawas of the doubly charge scalars must satisfy @xmath69 \\label{relacionpdeltas }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath70    where @xmath71 is a @xmath72 matrix with @xmath73 signs in the diagonal entries and zero otherwise , @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "this is obtained in analogy to the approach used for the quark mixing matrix in @xcite , where it is also shown that @xmath76 .",
    "therefore one can safely assume that @xmath77 as a leading order approximation in the most interesting scenario .",
    "notice that depends on the majorana phases .",
    "therefore the decay rates of @xmath24 into two leptons in the final state depend in a cp - even way on the dirac and majorana phases .",
    "in this section we show how the three angles @xmath78,@xmath79,@xmath80 and the dirac phase @xmath81 , appearing in @xmath21 are all expressed in term of physical observables at the lhc .",
    "more precisely , we find analytic expressions relating the elements of @xmath82 with some physical branching ratios of the ks process .",
    "for the majorana phases we point out that they can be obtained through the decays of the doubly charged scalar .",
    "moreover these measurements could serve as a cross - checking for the model .",
    "we begin our analysis by considering the ks process .",
    "it has a clean signal with almost no background that consists in two leptons and two jets in the final state .",
    "this process has the striking features of no missing energy in the final state and the amplification by the @xmath7 resonance .",
    "measuring the energy and momenta of the final particles it allows the full reconstruction of the masses of the @xmath7 and the heavy neutrino @xmath6 .",
    "studies of this process were performed in the past @xcite , with the conclusion that @xmath7 can be discovered at the lhc with a mass up to @xmath83 tev , masses for the right - handed neutrinos of the order @xmath84 for 300 @xmath85 of integrated luminosity . in @xcite completed studies of the @xmath7 production and decays at the lhc were done .",
    "they gave special emphasis to the chiral couplings of the @xmath7 with initial and final state quarks as well as the final state leptons .",
    "they showed that it is possible to determine ( by studying angular correlations and asymmetries between the participating particles ) the chiral properties of @xmath7 and the fermions .",
    "the ks process offers also the possibility of observing both the restoration of the left - right symmetry and the majorana nature of neutrinos at colliders ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the latter implies the equality between the decay rates in the same - sign and the opposite - sign leptons in the final state .",

    "notice that if the heavy neutrino masses are not degenerate , in general the ks process is sensitive only to the dirac type phase @xmath81 . in this case",
    "both lepton number conserving and lepton number violating channels give the same results .",
    "the partonic processes are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .    for degenerate heavy neutrino masses ,",
    "one may easily see from the same - sign leptons in the final state , that there is a cp - even dependence on the phases in @xmath91 .",
    "notice that this channel breaks the total lepton number , then is clear that we should have some dependence on the majorana phases . in the case of at least two",
    "degenerate heavy neutrino masses , it is in principle possible to construct cp - odd , triple - vector - product asymmetries with three momenta or any mixture of momenta and spin for the participating particles .    from eq .",
    "we find that the decay rate of @xmath92 is @xmath93 , \\label{n}\\ ] ] @xmath94 is the momentum of the right - handed neutrino @xmath86 .",

    "in what follows we consider the case when one , two or three heavy neutrinos are accessible at the lhc .",
    "* one heavy neutrino case * : it may happen that even if the @xmath7 is found at the lhc , just one of the heavy neutrino mass can be reconstructed . in this case",
    "we see from eq .",
    "( taking @xmath104 ) that there are only two independent quantities including tau leptons in the final state .",
    "if only electrons and muons are considered is easy to see that there is only one independent quantity within this analysis .    * two heavy neutrinos case * : one expect for two heavy neutrino at the lhc , that in order to probe all the elements of the mixing matrix @xmath21 the decays of the heavy neutrinos @xmath6 into electrons , muons and tau leptons must be identified .",
    "in fact , in this case analytical solutions for the three mixing angles and the dirac phase @xmath81 can be found in terms of physical quantities at the lhc , this can be seen by considering @xmath103 in eq . , namely @xmath105    there are 4 unknown parameters in @xmath82 ( @xmath78 , @xmath80 , @xmath79 and @xmath81 ) . by using the above ratios it is possible to probe 2 of them .",
    "there is just another independent quantity considering electron and muons in the final state @xmath106",
    "so we conclude that in order to probe the three mixings angles and the dirac phase with 2 heavy neutrinos on - shell , tau leptons must be included into the analysis and to this end consider the following relation @xmath107 and the mixings angles are given by    @xmath108    perhaps the more important advantage of the above expressions is that they allow a simple interpretation of the three leptonic mixing angles in terms of the final states in the ks process .",
    "for instance , from we may see that @xmath78 is maximal when @xmath109 and minimal when @xmath110 .",
    "for @xmath80 we notice that its value is maximal whenever @xmath111 or @xmath112 .",
    "instead it is minimal when the relation @xmath113 is satisfied .",
    "finally @xmath79 takes its maximal value when @xmath109 and @xmath114 and its minimal value when @xmath110 and @xmath115 .    for the sake of simplicity",
    "we show the expression for the dirac phase @xmath81 in terms of @xmath116 and the mixing angles and it is given by @xmath117    in order to see how the above results are affected once hadronization effects are taken into account , we extent the feynrules implementation of the mlrsm in @xcite to include leptonic mixing in the type ii see - saw dominance for @xmath2 as the lr symmetry , where it can be shown that @xmath118 .",
    "the events at the parton level are simulated with madgraph 5 @xcite and hadronization effects with pythia 6 @xcite .",
    "we use the same cuts applied in @xcite , namely both jets must have transverse energy grater than 100 gev and the invariant mass of the two final leptons grater than 200 gev .",
    "we take @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 in this illustrative example .",
    "furthermore , there is a proportionality between the two neutrino mass matrices @xmath123 which implies @xcite @xmath124 where the @xmath73 corresponds to normal / inverted ( nh / ih ) neutrino mass hierarchy respectively .",
    "notice that once the left - right symmetry is discovered , this possibility can be verify or falsify by the experiments .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig2n ] in the case of normal hierarchy neutrino mass spectrum and for heavy neutrino masses accessible at the lhc , the results obtained from the simulation , where it can be readily seen that our suggested strategy for measuring the right handed mixing angles is feasible at hadron colliders such as the lhc and future ones .",
    "notice that for the ih case , neutrino mass spectra accessible at the lhc would imply that only one or three neutrino masses can be reconstructed .",
    "the largest uncertainties in the production cross sections arises from the uncertainties in the proton pdf s and we assume them to be @xmath125 for @xmath126 tev as reported in @xcite , although in this paper we consider 13 tev of center of mass energy , one does not expect this result to change considerably .",
    "all this assuming 100@xmath127 identification of the tau leptons in the final state .",
    "this issue and the expected sensitivity to the leptonic mixing angles will be the subject of future work .    finally , from table [ tablei ] in appendix a we see that the smallest cross sections are the ones of the processes involving tau leptons in the final state .",
    "this can readily understood as a consequence of the smallness of the @xmath80 angle .",
    "the results obtained are encouraging , we find that for heavy neutrino masses near or below the tev range , a luminosity of @xmath128 @xmath85 is sufficient to measure all the three mixing angles at the lhc .",

    "three heavy neutrinos case * : once again in this case it is possible to find analytic expressions for the parameters in @xmath21 in terms of the physical quantities defined in eq . .",
    "the novelty is that no tau leptons must be identified in the final state , hence rendering this scenario ideal for the lhc ; to this end consider eqns .",

    "furthermore @xmath79 is nearly maximal when @xmath133 and this relation precisely corresponds to the maximal value @xmath80 when @xmath133 but its values are close to one .    as it is clear from the above expressions , the elements of @xmath82 have in this parametrization simple relations in terms of physical observables at the lhc .",
    "the precise form of the dirac phase @xmath81 is shown in .",
    "notice that for non - degenerate heavy neutrino masses and within this approach one can not distinguish @xmath81 from @xmath134 .",
    "in this respect we notice the cp - odd , triple - vector - product asymmetries in @xmath135 decay and @xmath136 conversion in nuclei @xcite may resolve this ambiguity and could even discriminate in the most interesting portion of the parameter s space , between @xmath2 or @xmath1 as the left - right symmetry .    in figs .",
    "[ fig3n_nh ] and [ fig3n_ih ] we show the theoretical values for the quantities defined above as well as the result obtained using madgraph 5 and pythia 6 indicated by the red dots with their respective error bars .",
