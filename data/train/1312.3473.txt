    "for a generic smooth hamiltonian @xmath7 with only contractible periodic orbits and standard complex structure @xmath8 we have proven the following statement .    the morse complex of the hamiltonian action @xmath3 is chain isomorphic to the floer complex of @xmath9 .    to give a short summary",
    "observe that the component of contractible loops of the free loop space of the @xmath10 - dimensional torus @xmath11 equipped with the standard symplectic structure @xmath12 can be completed to a hilbert manifold @xmath13 with respect to the @xmath14- inner product . in this case",
    "@xmath13 splits into @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is a hilbert space and each @xmath17 can be written as @xmath18 + \\sum_{k \\not = 0}e^{2\\pi j_0kt}x_k \\ , , \\quad [ x_0 ] \\in { \\mathbb{t}^{2n}}\\ , , x_k \\in { \\mathbb{r}^{2n}}\\quad \\forall \\ , k \\in { \\mathbb{z}}\\setminus\\{0\\}\\,.\\ ] ] note that @xmath19 is the complex structure on @xmath20 such that @xmath21 becomes a khler manifold with @xmath22 for given 1-periodic hamiltonian @xmath0 the hamiltonian action @xmath23 is defined by @xmath24 where @xmath25 denote the projections onto the loops all of whose frequencies are positive or negative respectively .",
    "the critical points of @xmath3 are precisely the 1-periodic contractible solutions @xmath26 of the hamiltonian flow @xmath27 determined by the equation @xmath28 now there are several possibilities to develop a morse theory for this action functional , see for instance @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we want to focus on two other ideas .",
    "the first one goes back to the results of a. abbondandolo and p. majer published in @xcite and @xcite and uses the fact that @xmath3 possesses a smooth gradient @xmath29 on @xmath13 to build up a theory directly on the loop space .",
    "the second one is known as a. floer s approach @xcite where solutions of a type of cauchy riemann pde s are considered , i.e. , the solutions @xmath30 of the floer equation @xmath31 where @xmath32 denotes the set of all smooth and 1-periodic almost complex structures on @xmath33 which are compatible with @xmath34 . in our case we have to model these equations in the @xmath35-setup , therefore we find it convenient to restrict ourselves to the case where @xmath36 is the constant standard complex structure . to achieve transversality",
    "we asssume that the hamiltonian @xmath37 was generically chosen .",
    "hence we can count the solutions with finite energy which therefore converge to critical points of @xmath3 at the asymptotics and define the floer boundary operator @xmath38 between the free abelian groups generated by the critical points of @xmath3 with conley - zehnder index @xmath39 . according to floer s fundamental theorem",
    "the above setup becomes a complex , i.e. , @xmath40 .",
    "the homology of this complex is called the * floer homology * and it is known due to floer s continuation theorem that this homology is independent of the chosen hamiltonian @xmath37 . in particular",
    "this asserts why we can assume that there are only contractible 1-periodic hamiltonian orbits and can therefore restrict ourselves to the component of contractible loops of the free loop space @xmath4 as introduced .",
    "furthermore the continuation property was used by a. floer to prove that the floer homology is chain isomorphic to the singular homology of the symplectic manifold , i.e. , in our case the torus @xmath20 .",
    "this fact is the main ingredient in floer s proof of the * arnold conjecture * in the generic situation @xcite .",
    "+ coming back to the first approach the fact that @xmath3 is strongly indefinite , i.e. , possesses infinite morse indices and co - indices for all singular points @xmath41 leads to the problem that the unstable and stable manifolds @xmath42 are infinite dimensional submanifolds of @xmath13 . nevertheless , one can hope , that the intersections @xmath43 are finite dimensional . to prove such a result a. abbondandolo and p. majer",
    "require the existence of a subbundle @xmath44 , @xmath45 which in our situation can be chosen as @xmath46 such that the morse vector field @xmath47 satisfies two conditions , namely : + * ( c1 ) * for every singular point @xmath48 , the unstable eigenspace @xmath49 of the jacobian of @xmath47 at @xmath50 is a compact perturbation of @xmath51 ; meaning that the corresponding orthogonal projections @xmath52 and @xmath53 with @xmath54 have compact difference , i.e. , @xmath55 is a compact operator . + * ( c2 ) * for all @xmath56 the operator @xmath57 $ ] is compact , where @xmath58=st - ts$ ] , @xmath59 @xmath60 denotes the commutator . + under condition * c1 * and a strengthened , global version of * c2 * , a. abbondandolo and p. majer could prove in @xcite that if the intersections @xmath61 , @xmath41 are transverse , then these are finite dimensional manifolds which are compact up to broken trajectories .",
    "furthermore a. abbondandolo and p. majer defined a relative morse index with respect to @xmath62 , which in our situation due to our special choice of @xmath62 coincides with the conley - zehnder index .",
    "therefore we are almost in the same situation as in the finite dimensional case treated in @xcite and can built up a morse complex for the action functional @xmath3 .",
    "that is to consider again the free abelian groups @xmath63 , generated by the critical points @xmath64 of @xmath3 with conley - zehnder index @xmath65 and to define the boundary operator @xmath66 in the usual way by counting the connected components of @xmath61 with @xmath67 , @xmath68 .",
    "the fact that @xmath69 is again deep and proven in @xcite .",
    "so we obtain a homology called the * morse homology * of @xmath3 . though we have to perturb the gradient of @xmath3 by a compact vector field @xmath70 to achieve transversality , the above homology is independent of the perturbation as well as of the particular choice of @xmath37 .",
    "so again the theory can be treated in the situation of contractible critical points of @xmath3 .",
    "+ after introducing both complexes we now want to give a sketch of the construction of the isomorphism .",
    "the main ingredients are the * moduli spaces of hybrid type curves*. for given critical points @xmath71 , a @xmath72- vector field @xmath73 on @xmath13 with globally defined flow that are the spaces @xmath74 where @xmath75 denotes the half cylinder .",
    "though the solutions are smooth on the interior @xmath76 the equation @xmath77 is understood in the weak sense .",
    "the fact that the evaluation at zero is a well defined smooth submersion implies that the boundary condition @xmath78 which says that the loop @xmath79 shall sit on the unstable manifold of @xmath80 with respect to @xmath73 is well posed .",
    "the new outcome of this thesis is that this non - lagrangian boundary condition leads to a well posed fredholm problem and to the fact that the moduli spaces are compact up to broken trajectories in the @xmath81-sense as long as @xmath73 is of the form @xmath82 where @xmath70 plays the role of a compact perturbation .",
    "+ both results in this robust theory use new estimates for the linearized operator and the connecting curves and again the existence of the subbundle @xmath62 which is admissible for @xmath73 in the sense of conditions * c1 * and * c2*. as an outlook one hopefully can extract these methods for the analogous problem on more general manifolds as the torus @xmath20 .",
    "+ to finish the construction of the isomorphism we define the following map on the abelian groups @xmath83 @xmath84 where @xmath85 denotes the sum of connected components of the moduli space @xmath86 . by a standard argument using the gluing method",
    "@xmath5 is a chain homomorphism .",
    "finally , we order the critical points of @xmath3 by their levels , then @xmath87 gets the form of an upper triangular matrix with @xmath88 s on the diagonal and therefore @xmath5 is an isomorphism as claimed .",
    "in this chapter we construct the morse complex for the hamiltonian action functional @xmath3 on the component of contractible loops of the free loop space @xmath89 of the torus @xmath1 . to improve the readability of this paper some proofs of already known statements adapted to our particular setting",
    "are explicitly given .",
    "this section shows how to complete the component of contractible loops of the free loop space of the torus to a hilbert manifold whose structure is induced by the special sobolev - space @xmath90 .",
    "furthermore we show that our choice of the @xmath14-setup matches perfectly for the hamiltonian action @xmath3 in the sense that its gradient with respect to the @xmath14-inner product is well defined and smooth .",
    "most facts are already discussed in @xcite .",
    "therefore we restrict ourselves to the essential statements .",
    "+ we consider the @xmath10-dimensional torus @xmath20 , @xmath91 , as the quotient @xmath1 with the standard symplectic structure @xmath92 induced by the standard symplectic basis @xmath93 on @xmath94 and denote by @xmath8 the special complex structure on @xmath20 such that @xmath21 becomes a khler manifold with @xmath22 we introduce a smooth , 1-periodic hamiltonian @xmath0 , its hamiltonian vector field @xmath95 defined by @xmath96 and the corresponding smooth flow @xmath97 , which since @xmath98 is compact , is globally defined by requiring that @xmath27 solves @xmath99 it is well - known that the search for contractible 1-periodic orbits of @xmath97 can be reformulated as a variational problem as follows .",
    "consider the * component of contractible loops of the free loop space of the torus*. that is @xmath100 = 0 \\quad \\text{in } \\quad \\pi_1({\\mathbb{t}^{2n } } ) { \\right}\\}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath101 denotes the first fundamental group . to introduce the * hamiltonian action functional * on @xmath4 we lift the contractible loop @xmath102 to a closed curve @xmath103 and lift @xmath37 to a function @xmath104 that is 1-periodic in all variables on @xmath105 and set @xmath106 now by partial integration the first term is independent of the chosen lift of @xmath50 and by the periodicity of @xmath104 so is the second .",
    "hence @xmath107 is a well defined functional and if there is no danger of confusion we will make no notational difference between @xmath50 and its lift . varying @xmath107 at @xmath108 in direction of a vector field @xmath109 along @xmath50 yields in @xmath110 = \\int_0 ^ 1 { \\left } < j_0 \\,\\dot x(t ) +   \\nabla h\\big(x(t)\\big),y(t){\\right}>dt \\,,\\ ] ] which readily shows the one to one correspondence between critical points of @xmath107 and the contractible 1-periodic orbits of @xmath97 , which we denote by @xmath26",
    ". + we complete @xmath4 to a hilbert manifold as follows .",
    "since @xmath111 each curve @xmath112 can be written as a fourier series with coefficients in @xmath94 @xmath113 furthermore the @xmath114-action acts only on the constants .",
    "therefore we obtain by identifying those curves whose image on the torus is the same @xmath115 + \\sum_{k \\not = 0 } e^{2\\pi k",

    "we set @xmath127 then @xmath13 carries the structure of a hilbert manifold with trivial tangent bundle @xmath128 .",
    "we often abuse notation slightly by still writing @xmath129 , @xmath130 for the maps @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "furthermore we can extand @xmath107 to a functional defined on @xmath13 , by setting @xmath133 before we go on we need a better understanding of the spaces @xmath118 .",
    "therefore we follow h. hofer and e. zehnder @xcite and give a brief summary of the essential properties .",
    "+ for @xmath134 the spaces decrease , @xmath135 while the norms increase : @xmath136 in particular the inclusion maps @xmath137 are continuous for @xmath138 ; if in particular @xmath139 , then as proved in @xcite they are moreover compact operators .",

    "moreover there is a constant @xmath143 such that @xmath144    since we choose the @xmath14-structure , this leads us to the borderline case of embeddings into @xmath145 .",
    "nevertheless , since @xmath20 possesses a trivial tangent bundle , provides us with a hilbert manifold structure which will be sufficient for our purpose . for manifolds with non - trivial tangent bundle one needs pointwise control on the orbits and therefore at least a @xmath146 , @xmath147 setting to equip the loop space with a banach manifold structure . + a central role in further discussions is played by the inclusion @xmath148 and its adjoint @xmath149 defined as usual by @xmath150 for all @xmath151 .",

    "we claim that there is a constant @xmath1269 such that @xmath1270 assume that holds , then by step 1 we have that the restriction of any sequence @xmath1271 to @xmath1272 is uniformly bounded in @xmath1273 .",
    "since the embedding @xmath1274 is compact due to the sobolev embedding theorem , see @xcite , and due to theorem [ compactm ] the set @xmath1275 is precompact in @xmath13 .",
    "the estimate implies that the restriction of @xmath1276 to @xmath1277 possesses an in @xmath1278 convergent subsequence which proves the claimed result .",
    "so it remains to prove .",
    "therefore let @xmath833 be a smooth function such that @xmath1279 now we apply formula of lemma [ formform ] to @xmath1280 , @xmath1268 and obtain @xmath1281 with @xmath1282 .",
    "now by the mean value theorem we compute @xmath1283 therefore we can find a constant @xmath1284 such that @xmath1285 which implies that there is @xmath1286 such that holds .",

    "let @xmath633 and let @xmath1289 be a sequence of curves and @xmath1290 , @xmath1291 be the trajectories through @xmath1292 .",

    "this would result in a curve which runs into a critical point in finite time which is therefore constant , see @xcite .",
    "of course also the morse trajectory would be constant in this case so the whole curve would converge to some critical point which contradicts the assumption that @xmath3 possesses regular values in the interior .      by the results of section [ transf ]",
    "we can choose a generic hamiltonian @xmath37 such that @xmath9 is a regular pair . furthermore due to theorem [ res ]",
    "we can choose @xmath1190 such that @xmath424 satisfies the morse - smale property up to order 2 , i.e. , the unstable and stable manifolds meet transversally and the moduli spaces @xmath736 and @xmath1224 are manifolds for all @xmath921 with @xmath1305 . in this section we show that , in this situation , there is a chain isomorphism @xmath1306 for technical reasons we reduce ourselves to the case of @xmath573-coefficients , i.e. , @xmath83 the first part is to prove that @xmath1307 is a chain homomorphism .",

    "@xmath1224 is a manifold of dimension 1 , which is @xmath81- precompact according to theorem [ compact2 ] .",
    "we claim that if @xmath1310 is non - empty , then @xmath1311 is a broken hybrid type trajectory , that is of the following form .",

    "hence the ends of @xmath1309 are half open intervals whose boundary points correspond to the broken hybrid type trajectories . to prove this result one uses",
    "the gluing methods established in @xcite and @xcite , both of which localize either at the morse part or the floer part and can therefore be applied .",
    "now we construct the isomorphism as follows : + let @xmath193 be given , then by the results of section [ transf ] we can assume that , up to a small perturbation , which leaves the periodic orbits fixed , @xmath37 is such that @xmath9 is a regular pair .",
    "we choose @xmath1190 and set for @xmath448 @xmath1320 to be the number of connected components of the corresponding moduli spaces .",
    "due to theorem [ compact2 ] , theorem [ res ] and lemma [ zero ] the above identity is well defined .",
    "observe furthermore that since the solutions @xmath1321 are half morse trajectories and half pseudo - holomorphic curves due to the carleman similarity principle , see @xcite , each solution is isolated and is therefore a connected component .",
    "consider the abelian groups @xmath83 then we define the following map @xmath1322 between the morse- and floer - complex on the generators as @xmath1323 and state the following theorem .",
    "first we show that @xmath5 is an homomorphism . for this",
    "consider the following identity @xmath1324 modulo @xmath1125 , where @xmath577 is the number of connected components of the intersection @xmath61 with respect to @xmath424 and @xmath1325 is the number of connected components of @xmath1326 . indeed",
    "the coefficient in is the number of broken hybrid type trajectories from @xmath50 to @xmath528 , which by proposition [ propf ] equals the number of boundary points of @xmath1327 . since the boundary of a compact one - dimensional manifold always consists of an even number of points , holds . in particular there",
    "holds @xmath1328 modulo @xmath1125 .",
    "hence @xmath1329 and therefore @xmath5 is an homomorphism as claimed .",
    "now we order the critical points @xmath1330 , @xmath91 with @xmath1331 , @xmath1332 by increasing action , choosing any order for subsets of solutions with identical action , i.e. , @xmath1333 .",
