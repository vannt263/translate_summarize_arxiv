    "topological insulator has received widespread attentions in recent years because of its exotic electronic properties which suggest wonderful prospects both in the fundamental study and industrial applications @xcite .",
    "its novel feature lies on the observation that when it is of a finite size it has a linearly dispersive surface states ( edge states in the two - dimensional system case ) in the bulk gap @xcite .",
    "the robustness of the surface states against disorder scattering makes topological insulator a promising new member of materials useful in the future information technology . in practical applications , electric manipulation of the carriers by voltage gates provides a basic important mechanism for the functioning of the devices .",
    "it thus becomes a crucial tasks is to learn how to control the behavior of electrons in topological insulators using electric fields .",
    "various research concerning this issue have been done in the literature @xcite .",
    "if the edges where the edges states localize can be created by electric voltage gates , namely , carriers in the system can be confined spatially by electric potential , it would greatly enhance the utilization of topological insulators as a building block of future devices .",
    "actually , such design has been proposed @xcite where the possibility of edges created by voltage gate is implicitly assumed without a serious and careful scientific justification .",
    "theoretically , the effective model put forward in reference @xcite has been widely used to describe the two - dimensional ( 2d ) topological insulator @xcite . in this model , one deals with a coupled two - component system ( more generally , when the spin - orbit interaction is considered , it is a four - component system ) .",
    "the model resembles the dirac equation describing a dirac fermion which is known to exhibit the klein tunneling phenomenon @xcite and consequently a potential barrier may be unable to confine the fermion motion spatially .",
    "therefore , it will be interesting and meaningful to examine the influence of a spatially defined potential on the 2d topological insulator , especially the confinement of electron wave functions induced by the externally applied potential .",
    "the present paper addresses this very important problem .",
    "we simplify the issue by considering a lateral potential superlattice structure made of a 2d topological insulator with spatially periodic , square shaped , electric potential barriers created by electric gate voltage . the single - electron energy dispersion and wave function will be calculated .",
    "the spatial dependence of wave function will be investigated when the lateral superlattice potential is varied .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec.theo ] , the theoretical formulation is presented .",
    "section [ sec.dis ] contains our calculated results and their discussions .",
    "finally , in the last section , a summary is provided .",
    "the 2d topological insulator is modelled by the following well - known hamiltonian @xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath2 with @xmath3 the pauli matrix .",
    "@xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 are parameters determined by the structure of the quantum well @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath10 gives the zero point of energy and in this paper we can safely set it to zero for simplicity .",
    "when there is no coupling between spins ( not the true spin , just for labeling convenience @xcite ) , the lower @xmath13 block @xmath14 and the upper block @xmath15 are decoupled .",
    "they have the same energy spectrum and the corresponding wave functions are connected via an unitary transformation of time reversal operator .",
    "thus in this paper we will limit ourselves to the analysis of upper block @xmath16 only .",
    "the topological insulator is in the @xmath17 plane , and the lateral potential superlattice is assumed to be along the @xmath18 axis and uniform in the @xmath19 direction .",
    "the hamiltonian describing the lateral superlattice is assumed to be given by @xmath20 .",
    "the potential @xmath21 is diagonal and periodic in @xmath18 . for simplicity",
    ", the square barrier potential is assumed . in one unit cell",
    "@xmath22 $ ] , @xmath23 for @xmath24 $ ] , and @xmath25 otherwise .",
    "@xmath26 is the period of the lateral superlattice and @xmath27 is the width of the potential barrier in one unit cell .",
    "the lateral superlattice could be implemented by periodically depositing metal strips on the surface of the 2d topological insulator with the help of modern lithography technology .",
    "the barrier potential height can be varied by adjusting the bias voltage applied to the metal strips .",
    "the 2d topological insulator model is derived from a multiple band envelope function model @xcite .",
    "thus the assumption of a diagonal @xmath21 is reasonable and consistent with the model , actually , similar kind of potential profile has been used in graphene @xcite .",
    "the system is translational invariant in the @xmath19 direction , and @xmath28 is a good quantum number .",
    "but because of the presence of potential @xmath21 , there is no translational invariance in the @xmath18 direction , and we follow the peierls substitution to replace @xmath29 in equation ( [ effmodel ] ) by the differential operator @xmath30 .",
    "the explicit form of the hamiltonian is thus as follows .",
    "@xmath31 with @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 .",
    "the wave function of the above hamiltonian can be written as @xmath37 with @xmath38 the system size in the @xmath19 direction and @xmath39 the mini - band wave vector . @xmath40 and",
    "@xmath41 give the upper and lower components of the periodic part of the wave function .",
    "the wave vector @xmath39 should be limited to the first brillouin zone @xmath42 $ ] . in the present paper ,",
    "the plane wave expansion approach is used and sufficient number of plane waves are used to achieve the necessary accuracy for the energy levels .",
    "the wave function @xmath43 can be written as @xmath44 where @xmath45 stands for @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively .",
    "the wave function @xmath43 is normalized to unity in one unit cell .",
    "the model for the 2d topological insulator contains many parameters . in the present paper",
    ", we will mainly consider the influence of the gap parameter @xmath12 , as its sign has a profound effect on the electronic property when the 2d topological insulator has a finite size @xcite .",
    "the numerical values of other parameters @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath11 are taken from reference @xcite .",
    "the influence of the strength of superlattice potential @xmath48 will also be studied .",
    "in the absence of periodic potential , the bulk 2d topological insulator approximately has two bands @xcite .",
    "the introduction of the lateral superlattice potential @xmath21 leads to a multiple energy band structure .",
    "the eigen energy of the hamiltonian @xmath49 becomes @xmath50 with @xmath51 the band index .",
    "extensive numerical works are carried out and qualitatively the same results are obtained . in the following",
    "we will show calculated results for a typical case of @xmath52 nm and @xmath53 .",
    "the ratio @xmath54 is chosen to avoid possible length commensurate artifact and other ratios are also used .",
    "it is found that , as @xmath48 increases ( decreases ) , each band energy @xmath50 increases ( decreases ) as a whole , roughly with an amount @xmath55 , the averaged potential energy in one unit cell .",
    "furthermore , for a given @xmath48 , if one takes the averaged potential @xmath55 as the energy zero point , then the @xmath56-th band above or below this averaged potential energy will approximately has its largest expansion coefficient @xmath57 at @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "@xmath60 is shown in figure 1 , for a typical case of @xmath61 nm@xmath62 and @xmath63 with @xmath64 mev .",
    "an almost linear dependence can be obviously seen .",
    "this shows that the bands near the averaged potential are more `` ground state '' like as it is less oscillatory compared to the bands more far away from the averaged potential .",
    "it is interesting to point out that when the sign of @xmath12 changes , the behavior shown in figure 1 is qualitatively the same , despite the fact that when @xmath65 there is no edge state when the system is of a finite size .    in this paper",
    ", we assume that the number of electrons in the 2d topological insulator will not be strongly affected by the introduction of lateral superlattice potential .",
    "this approximation is consistent with the assumption of diagonal addition of the superlattice potential .",
    "if the fermi energy is near the band gap of the bulk 2d topological insulator which is taken as the energy zero point , then in the presence of the lateral superlattice potential the fermi energy should be close to the averaged potential .",
    "thus in this paper we will focus on the bands near the averaged potential . for convenience we will label six bands near the averaged potential as @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , respectively ( see figure 1 ) .    in figure 2(a ) , we show the energy dispersion along the @xmath39 direction in the first brillouin zone ( @xmath72 $ ] ) for different values of @xmath48 and @xmath63 .    in figure 2(b ) , the energy dispersion along the @xmath73 direction is shown with @xmath74 . in each energy dispersion , the averaged potential energy @xmath75 is subtracted .",
    "the bulk bands are also shown in figure 2 as open symbols .",
    "when @xmath48 is small , the shape of bands @xmath66 and @xmath69 are close to the bulk bands as expected .",
    "we wish to point out that when the sign of @xmath12 is reversed , the energy dispersion is qualitatively unchanged .",
    "the energy dispersion changes in a rather complicated way when the barrier potential @xmath48 changes . in figure 3 , six energy levels are shown as a function of @xmath48 , with the average potential subtracted , for various values of @xmath39 and a fixed @xmath63 .",
    "one can clearly see that all bands display an oscillatory behavior .",
    "there are three critical values of the potential @xmath48 at which the @xmath66 and @xmath69 bands ( e2 and e3 , h2 and h3 ) touch each other when @xmath76",
    ". the oscillation amplitude will be smaller and no touching point exists when @xmath77 or @xmath78 .",
    "next , we study the spatial dependence of wave functions .",
    "the system considered is uniform along the @xmath19 direction , therefore we only need to investigate the probability distribution along the @xmath18 direction .",
    "the total distribution , for a specific band , can be written as @xmath79 contributed from the upper and lower components of the corresponding wave function .",
    "figure 4 shows the probability distribution for various value of @xmath39 and @xmath73 with a fixed @xmath80 ev . the well / barrier regions are indicated by two vertical lines in figure 4 .",
    "figure 4(a ) is for the @xmath66 band and figure 4(b ) for the @xmath69 band .",
    "it can be seen that , for the @xmath66 band , the amplitude of wave function in the middle well region ( @xmath81 ) is larger than that in the barrier region ( @xmath82 and @xmath83 ) .",
    "but for the @xmath69 band , the amplitude of wave function is larger in the barrier region .",
    "it is interesting to note that the energy of @xmath66 and @xmath69 bands is about @xmath84 ev , both below the barrier potential @xmath80 ev . on the other hand",
    ", the distribution shows that the @xmath66 band behaves like a state in the well , while the @xmath69 band behaves like a state in the barrier , if we view them in a traditional single band picture . in the single band case ,",
    "when the band energy is below the barrier of a superlattice potential , the wave function should be more confined in the well region .",
    "the result shown in figure 4 indicates that a state whose energy is below the barrier could become `` localized '' in the well region or in the barrier region .",
    "this resembles the case of above - barrier states in a semiconductor superlattice @xcite .",
    "this effect is not unexpected , as in the present study , we deal with a two - band model with a strong inter - band coupling .",
    "as shown in figure 4 , electronic states with @xmath63 have a symmetrical distribution about the center of the unit cell @xmath85 .",
    "this symmetry will be destroyed if @xmath78 . however , the distribution of a state with @xmath86 and the distribution of a state with @xmath87 are connected by a reflection transformation about the center of the unit cell . by making the reflection transformation ,",
    "one obtains the distribution for @xmath87 from the distribution for @xmath88 and vice versa .",
    "this symmetry about the distribution is due to the symmetry of the model hamiltonian that @xmath89 .",
    "next , we study how the probability distribution ( the wave function ) changes when the lateral superlattice potential @xmath48 changes .",
    "this task becomes easier if we introduce the notion of probability distribution integrated over the well region in an unit cell @xmath90 with @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "similarly , we also introduce @xmath93 the probability distribution integrated over the barrier region in an unit cell . in figure 5 , we show the total @xmath94 for the @xmath66 and @xmath69 bands for various values of @xmath39 , @xmath73 and @xmath12 .",
    "it is clear that , as the barrier potential @xmath48 increases , the probability distribution in the well displays an oscillatory behavior around @xmath95 the homogenous value .",
    "when @xmath74 , the oscillation of @xmath94 shows abrupt changes at several values of @xmath48 ( see figure 5(a ) and also figure 5(d ) ) . when @xmath77 , these abrupt changes becomes smoother .",
    "the integrated probability distribution for the @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 bands are shown in figure 6 for @xmath61 nm@xmath62 , @xmath63 and two values of @xmath12 .",
    "the oscillatory behavior is similar to that of @xmath66 and @xmath69 bands except that the oscillation is slightly slantwise to the homogeneous distribution .",
    "states with even higher / lower energies are also investigated and similar results are found .",
    "this result is consistent with that in reference @xcite , where the author found that the spin polarization oscillates across the boundary of a step - function electrical potential on the surface of a three dimensional topological insulator and is not confined by the potential due to the klein paradox . by examining figure 5 and 6 , one observes that the amplitude of the oscillation is not strong and this indicates that the effectiveness of gating on top of a 2d topological insulator is limited . as we have mentioned , this is due to the coupled two - band nature intrinsic to the system .",
    "moreover , it should be pointed out that the oscillatory pattern can be modified dramatically when a different set of topological insulator parameters @xcite is used .",
    "it is well - known that , when the effective model for the 2d topological insulator is applied to a stripe geometry system , the existence of the nontrivial edge states requires that the bulk bands must be inverted , i.e. , @xmath96 @xcite .",
    "when all parameters except @xmath12 are unchanged , the model with negative @xmath12 and positive @xmath12 have completely different behavior when applied to the stripe system . in figure 5 and 6",
    ", we compare @xmath94 calculated with a negative @xmath12 and a positive one .",
    "the left panels are for the negative @xmath12 case and the right panels are for the positive @xmath12 case . in the case of positive @xmath12 , one observes that the number of oscillations increases .",
    "however , it is clear that there is no significant difference between two cases .",
    "as the lateral superlattice studied in this paper is a coupled two - band system , we have evaluated the probability distribution for each component of a state . in figure 7 , the integrated probability distribution ( wave function ) is shown for the upper and lower component of wave function separately .",
    "the integral is performed either inside the potential well region ( figures 7(a ) and 7(c ) ) or in the barrier region ( figures 7(b ) and 7(d ) ) . only the results for the @xmath66 and",
    "@xmath69 bands are presented . in the left panels",
    "@xmath96 , and in the right panels @xmath65 .",
    "@xmath61 nm@xmath62 and @xmath63 . one observes that the two components both display oscillatory behavior .    in the case of @xmath96 ( figures 7(a ) and 7(b ) ) , when @xmath48 is small , @xmath94 and @xmath93 of the @xmath69 band mainly consists of the upper component , and for the @xmath66 band they are dominated by the lower component .",
    "as @xmath48 increases , the difference between two components becomes small .",
    "in contrast , when @xmath65 ( figures 7(c ) and 7(d ) ) and @xmath48 is small , the @xmath66 band is mainly contributed from the upper component and the @xmath69 band is dominated by the lower component .",
    "more calculations show that when @xmath39 and @xmath73 becomes large , the contribution to @xmath94 and @xmath93 from upper and lower components will become nearly the same , even in the region of small @xmath48 .",
    "in summary , we have investigated theoretically the properties of electronic states of a lateral superlattice made of a 2d topological insulator .",
    "the dispersion of mini - band and the electron wave function in the potential well region are found to display an oscillatory behavior as the potential strength of the lateral superlattice increases .",
    "the probability of finding an electron in the potential well region can be larger or smaller than the average as the potential strength varies .",
    "this indicates that the electrical confining effect in two - dimensional topological insulators is not high and one should be careful with the idea of creating boundaries using gate voltage in device design .",
    "these features are different from that in a single - band kronig - penney model , and can be attributed to the coupled - multiple - band nature of the 2d topological insulator model ."
