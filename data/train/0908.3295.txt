    "it is well established that early - type galaxies have mostly been built up before redshift @xmath2 ( e.g. , cirasuolo et al . 2007 ;",
    "pozzeti et al .",
    "however , recent observations have revealed that passively evolving , early - type galaxies at higher redshifts ( @xmath3 12 ) are surprisingly much more compact than the likely present - day descendants of the same stellar mass ( e.g. , longhetti et al .",
    "2007 ; trujillo et al . 2007 ; cimatti et al . 2008 ; damjanov et al .",
    "2009 , hereafter d09 ) .",
    "such compact galaxies are not found in the local universe , and they must disappear ( decrease in comoving number density by a factor @xmath45000 , taylor et al .",
    "2009 ) by structural evolution , meaning that the evolution must occur ubiquitously , rather than stochastically , for all such galaxies . in the plane of @xmath5-@xmath6 ( total stellar mass and the effective radius including half of the projected light ) , they must be `` puffed up '' with a typical size increase by a factor of 23 ( a factor of more than 10 in stellar density ) to move into the region populated by the present - day galaxies , without significant increase in stellar mass ( fig .",
    "[ fig : m - rho - r ] ) .",
    "furthermore , this evolutionary process seems to work in a broad context of galaxy formation spanning wide ranges of mass , radius , and redshifts ( d09 ) .",
    "this size evolution problem thus presents a new major challenge for the theory of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "several scenarios have been proposed , but none of them has convincingly explained it . here , a new scenario is proposed that may contribute to solve the problem .",
    "it is assumed that the dominant component of the non - baryonic cold dark matter in the universe is dark compact objects ( dcos ) , like primordial black holes ( pbhs ) or substructures in dark haloes , having a mass scale of @xmath7 .",
    "this possibility is not yet excluded by currently available observations ( see  [ section : dco - obs ] ) .    in  [ section",
    ": other - scenarios ] , previously proposed scenarios for this problem and their potential difficulties are briefly reviewed .",
    "the new scenario of this work will be described in  [ section : df ] , followed by some discussions in  [ section : dco - obs ] and  [ section : discussion ] .",
    "dissipationless `` dry '' mergers of old stellar systems can increase galaxy sizes without new star formation activity , but stellar mass should also be increased .",
    "bezanson et al .",
    "( 2009 ) argued that mass increase with a scaling of @xmath8 , which is expected in the case of major or equal - mass mergers , can not solve the problem because it would violate the constraint from the stellar mass found in present - day early - type galaxies .",
    "minor dry mergers ( @xmath9 in the limit of very large mass ratio ) may be more helpful to solve the problem , as demonstrated by a simulation of naab et al .",
    "( 2009 ) . however , their simulation is only for one galaxy , and it must be further studied whether this scenario can explain the size evolution in the general context of galaxy formation ( d09 ; williams et al .",
    "all high-@xmath10 compact galaxies must experience many minor mergers to gain substantial mass and size increase , and they would have to be all dry to keep the old stellar population , which seems somewhat contrived .",
    "it should be noted that the largest mass ( @xmath11 ) of @xmath12 galaxies in the d09 sample is already comparable with that of the local sdss sample ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : m - rho - r ] ) , and further mass increase may contradict the data even in the case of minor mergers .",
    "theoretically , minor dry mergers should be effective for massive and high redshift galaxies ( naab et al .",
    "2009 ; hopkins et al .",
    "2009a ) , but the d09 data indicate that the required degree of size evolution is similar for galaxies in the mass range of @xmath13@xmath14 , and lower mass galaxies disappear faster at higher redshifts ( fig .",
    "[ fig : m - rho - r ] ) .",
    "nipoti et al .",
    "( 2009 ) have argued that constraints from gravitational lensing do not allow size evolution by more than a factor @xmath151.8 by dry mergers , which seems too small to completely solve the size evolution problem .",
    "puff up of galaxies by mass loss is another possibility , such as stellar mass loss ( d09 ) or by quasar feedback ( fan et al .",
    "2008 ) . however , stellar mass loss is not satisfactory because of the small amount of mass loss and short time scales ( d09 ) .",
    "the physical process of quasar feedback is rather uncertain , and it seems difficult to puff up quiescent galaxies in passive evolution phase after they lost most of interstellar gas ( bezanson et al .",
    "it may require a significant fine - tuning to explain the ubiquitous size evolution by rather stochastic quasar feedback processes .",
    "various observations of nearby early - type galaxies based on stellar kinetics ( e.g. , cappellari et al . 2006 ) , x - ray emitting interstellar gas ( e.g. , fukazawa et al .",
    "2006 ) , and strong / weak gravitational lensing ( e.g. , gavazzi et al .",
    "2007 ) have shown that stellar mass is dominant at inner radii while dark matter dominates at outer radii , and the transition occurs at around the effective radius .",
    "therefore , if there is significant transfer of kinetic energy from dark matter to stars , it would puff up stars at @xmath16 resulting in a pure - size evolution of the stellar component .",
    "this energy transfer occurs by dynamical friction .",
    "when stars have a stellar mass density @xmath17 and the maxwellian velocity distribution with one - dimensional dispersion @xmath18 , the dynamical friction timescale for a dco having a velocity @xmath19 is given as ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) : @xmath20 where the function @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the coulomb logarithm @xmath23 $ ] becomes 13.74 and 7.60 if we take the maximum impact parameter @xmath24 to be 10 kpc ( the galaxy scale ) and @xmath25 ( the mean separation of dcos ) , respectively , for typical values of @xmath26 , @xmath27 km / s , and @xmath28 . in the following @xmath29",
    "is adopted .",
    "since @xmath30 is strongly dependent on @xmath19 , we should carefully take the effective mean about @xmath19 .",
    "the total kinetic energy @xmath31 of dcos will decrease by a factor of 1/2 in a time of @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the phase space distribution function of dcos .",
    "assuming that the initial velocity distribution of dcos is the same as that of stars , @xmath34 is found as : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is @xmath30 when @xmath19 is the mean value @xmath37 .    to compare with the observed data in fig .",
    "[ fig : m - rho - r ] , we convert @xmath18 into stellar mass using the direct correlation between the two ( i.e. , equivalent to the faber - jackson relation for a constant stellar mass - to - light ratio ) .",
    "the virial relation @xmath38 is another option of this conversion , but we take the former because the @xmath5-@xmath18 correlation is tight and the latter could be affected by the size evolution ( as discussed here ) and contribution from dark matter .",
    "we expect rather mild evolution of @xmath18 against the size evolution , considering the roughly flat velocity profiles of elliptical galaxies including dark matter ( e.g. , mamon & okas 2005 ) .",
    "using observed velocity dispersions has been corrected to an aperture radius of @xmath39 , and the central velocity dispersion is typically @xmath40 times higher than that around @xmath6 ( e.g. , cappellari et al .",
    "therefore @xmath41 has been adopted here . ]",
    "@xmath42 of the sdss early - type galaxies ( bernardi et al .",
    "2003 ) and the stellar mass estimates of d09 , @xmath43 is found , and hence the energy transfer time scale becomes @xmath44^{-0.247 }    \\left[\\frac{r_e}{1 \\rm \\ kpc}\\right]^3     \\left[\\frac{m_\\bullet}{10 ^ 5 m_\\odot}\\right]^{-1 } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , the stellar mass fraction of 0.42 within @xmath6 ( corresponding to the srsic index @xmath45 , e.g. , mamon & okas 2005 ) has been used to convert @xmath17 ( the mean density within @xmath6 ) into @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "this time scale is compared with the observed data of early - type galaxies in the plane of @xmath5-@xmath6 as well as @xmath17-@xmath6 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : m - rho - r ] ) . the high density galaxies ( @xmath46 ) of the d09 sample",
    "is found only in the higher redshift bin of @xmath47 ( red symbols in fig .",
    "[ fig : m - rho - r ] ) , indicating that these galaxies should disappear on a shorter time scale of a few gyr , while galaxies of lower densities ( @xmath48 , blue symbols ) seem to disappear more slowly on a time scale of @xmath49 gyr . fig .",
    "10 of d09 has shown this trend even more clearly in a @xmath17-@xmath10 plot , where galaxies having higher stellar density disappear at higher redshifts .",
    "this trend is expected in the proposed scenario , because galaxies having higher stellar density are located in the region of shorter @xmath34 , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : m - rho - r ] .    the @xmath34 of high-@xmath10 early - type galaxies with the largest mass is larger than the age of the universe .",
    "we may need a larger dco mass than the assumed @xmath50 , or some other mechanisms , for these galaxies to evolve into the location of the local galaxies .",
    "on the other hand , mancini et al .",
    "( 2009 ) has recently reported that the sizes of the most massive early - type galaxies at @xmath51 are similar to those of local galaxies , indicating a possibility that the size shift in the @xmath5-@xmath6 plane is smaller for more massive galaxies . in this case",
    "dcos with @xmath7 could be sufficient to solve the problem .",
    "it should be noted that stellar density is larger than that of dark matter at @xmath52 ( e.g. , mamon & okas 2005 ) , and we do not expect a strong structural evolution of stars at @xmath53 .",
    "this is in contrast to the change of stellar distribution by stellar remnant black holes that have the same initial density profile as that of stars ( e.g. , merritt et al .",
    "the small effect at @xmath54 is consistent with the observations indicating that the core densities of high-@xmath10 elliptical galaxies are not much different from those of local galaxies ( bezanson et al .",
    "2009 ; hopkins et al . 2009b ) .",
    "the expected mild evolution of velocity dispersion is also consistent with the observational result of cenarro & trujillo ( 2009 ) .. velocity dispersion measurements of early - type galaxies at @xmath12 are still a difficult task , and more observational studies are highly desired . ]    to conclude , the proposed scenario has several features that are good to explain the observed trends : ( 1 ) the evolution should be pure - size evolution , ( 2 ) it works ubiquitously for all galaxies in a non - stochastic manner on cosmological time scales , ( 3 ) higher density galaxies should disappear on shorter time scales , ( 4 ) stellar density at @xmath52 is not much affected , and ( 5 ) evolution of velocity dispersion should be mild .",
    "there are no strong observational constraints to exclude the possibility of @xmath50 dcos as the dominant form of dark matter ( for reviews see mack et al . 2007 ; ricotti et al .",
    "2008 , hereafter m07 and r08 ) .",
    "dcos of @xmath55 are marginally allowed by constraints from strong lensing of compact radio galaxies ( wilkinson et al .",
    "2001 ) and millilensing of gamma - ray bursts ( nemiroff et al . 2001 ) . on the other hand , anomalous flux ratios in gravitational lenses may be explained by dcos of @xmath56 rather than dark matter of particle - mass scale ( mao et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "yoo et al . ( 2004 ) declared `` the end of macho era '' by closing the window of @xmath57@xmath58 based on the existence of wide binary stars in our galaxy halo , but the robustness of their conclusion has been questioned by quinn et al .",
    "( 2009 ) using new data .",
    "dcos of @xmath59 do not affect the stellar distribution of dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( dsphs ) like draco in the milky way halo ( jin et al . 2005 ) , and @xmath56 dcos may even be helpful to solve some problems in galaxy formation such as disk heating ( lacey & ostriker 1985 ) and the core / cusp problem ( jin et al . 2005 ) .",
    "snchez - salcedo & lora ( 2007 ) has claimed that @xmath60 dcos are excluded as dark matter from the survival of the kinetically cold stellar clump found in the ursa minor ( kleyna et al .",
    "2003 , hereafter k03 ) .",
    "however , quantitative constraint on the velocity dispersion of the cold clump was not derived by k03 , making a quantitative analysis difficult .",
    "the origin and history of the clump is also still uncertain ( see , e.g. , muoz et al .",
    "2008 ; penarrubia et al . 2009 ) .",

    "( 2003 ) excluded dcos heavier than a few times @xmath61 as dark matter , using the small - scale density fluctuations inferred by ly@xmath62 forests .",

    "( 2006 ) discussed the expected number of x - ray sources in nearby galaxies considering radiatively inefficient accretion flow onto halo black holes of @xmath63 .",
    "r08 set strong constraints on pbhs as dark matter by requiring that the accretion activity onto pbhs does not affect the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background .",
    "however , these calculations include many assumptions and large uncertainties especially about accretion physics and feedback effects .",
    "r08 discussed about angular momentum estimating it from the normal cosmic density fluctuation .",
    "however , the proper mean separation of @xmath50 dark matter dcos at @xmath64 is about 10 pc , which is comparable to the bondi radius at that epoch estimated by r08 .",
    "then interaction with nearby dcos would result in significant angular momentum that should prevent efficient accretion .",
    "although dcos are less popular than elementary particles as the candidate of dark matter , several formation scenarios have been proposed ( see m07 and r08 for reviews ) .",
    "pbhs can be formed by density fluctuation of a modest amplitude or softening of equation of state , when the fluctuation scale enters the event horizon of the universe .",
    "the mass scale of @xmath50 corresponds to the horizon mass ( @xmath65 ) at a temperature of @xmath15 mev , i.e. , close to the @xmath66 annihilation era .",
    "note that only a small portion ( @xmath67 ) of the universe should be converted into pbhs to explain the dark matter density , and hence it may not necessarily affect the primordial nucleosynthesis .",
    "dcos need not to be very compact like pbhs , but substructures in dark haloes generally found in simulations of structure formation should also contribute to dynamical heating of stars .",
    "however , the mass fraction of substructure must be of order unity to explain the size evolution , which seems rather unlikely within the standard picture because less than @xmath1510% of dark mass within the virial radius ( and even smaller fraction at inner radii ) is found in substructures in recent simulations ( springel et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "the black hole masses found in active galactic nuclei are always @xmath68 .",
    "black holes heavier than @xmath69 have been discovered in quasars beyond @xmath70 ( e.g. , willott et al .",
    "2003 ) , and their existence at such high redshifts is not easy to explain by evolution starting from stellar mass black holes ( e.g. , tanaka & haiman 2009 ) . it is obvious that the explanation would become easier , if dark matter is composed of @xmath50 dcos .",
    "more realistic , numerical studies of galaxy size evolution would be required to confirm this hypothesis .",
    "observational searches for dcos by various approaches ( as discussed in  [ section : dco - obs ] ) may detect dcos in the future .",
