    "no hydromagnetic dynamo can exist driven only by differential rotation @xcite , but it is known that such dynamos can exist if the turbulence is helical in the sense that its kinetic helicity @xmath4 and/or its current helicity @xmath5 do not vanish .",
    "here @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the fluctuating parts of the flow @xmath8 and magnetic field @xmath9 .",
    "this condition of non - vanishing helicity is clearly fulfilled if the turbulence is rotating and stratified . in such turbulence a pseudo - scalar exists which allows the pseudo - scalars ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) to take finite values .",
    "the same is true for linear shear flows where the stratified turbulence in the presence of the shear also can form a kinetic helicity ( see rdiger & kitchatinov 2006 ) .",
    "the simplest pseudo - scalar is the scalar product @xmath10 with @xmath11 as the gradient vector of the turbulence ( or the fluid density ) and @xmath12 the rotation vector . in spheres",
    "the gradient vector @xmath11 is mainly radial so the pseudo - scalar @xmath10 has opposite signs in the two hemispheres , and vanishes at the equator .",
    "because of the close relationship of the helicity to the @xmath0-effect in the mean - field electrodynamics of turbulent media , @xmath13 ( the dots represent higher derivatives of @xmath14 ) the above - mentioned sign rules are also the sign rules of the @xmath0-effect i.e. @xmath15 .",
    "this sort of @xmath0-effect only exists for inhomogeneous turbulence . in planetary cores , however , and also in laboratory experiments the only inhomogeneities result from boundary conditions , as the density gradients are negligible .",
    "one can show that under the presence of magnetic background fields other inhomogeneities also form pseudo - scalars and , as a consequence , lead to new mechanisms for an @xmath0-effect ( e.g. gellert , rdiger & elstner 2008 ) . in the present study",
    "we demonstrate that instabilities due to inhomogeneous magnetic fields also lead to finite values of the helicities ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) , and in accord with ( [ 3 ] ) also to finite values of @xmath0 .",
    "indeed , in the presence of electric currents the simplest existing pseudo - scalar is @xmath16 which does not vanish for helical field geometries .",
    "we show that for such background fields the small - scale helicities obtain final values with the opposite sign as the helicity of the background field .",
    "according to the rayleigh criterion , in the absence of mhd effects an ideal flow is stable against axisymmetric perturbations whenever the specific angular momentum increases outward ( r^2)^2 > 0 , [ ray ] where @xmath17 is the angular velocity , and ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) are cylindrical coordinates in a right - handed system . in the presence of an azimuthal magnetic field",
    "@xmath21 , this criterion is modified to ( r^2)^2- ( ) ^2 > 0 , [ mich ] where @xmath22 is the permeability and @xmath23 the density @xcite .",
    "note also that this criterion is both necessary and sufficient for ( axisymmetric ) stability .",
    "in particular , _ all _ ideal flows can thus be destabilized , by azimuthal magnetic fields with the right profiles ( steeply increasing outwards ) and amplitudes .    on the other hand , for nonaxisymmetric modes one has ( r b_0,^2 ) < 0 [ tay ] as the necessary and sufficient condition for stability of an ideal fluid at rest @xcite .",
    "again , outwardly increasing fields are thus unstable .",
    "if ( [ tay ] ) is violated , the most unstable mode has azimuthal wave numbers of @xmath24 .",
    "we are interested in the stability of the background field @xmath25 , with @xmath26 , and the flow @xmath27 .",
    "the governing equations for the flow @xmath8 and the field @xmath9 are @xmath28 @xmath29 and @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the pressure , @xmath32 the kinematic viscosity and @xmath33 the magnetic diffusivity .",

    "a field of the form @xmath47 is generated by running an axial current only through the inner region @xmath48 , whereas a field of the form @xmath49 is generated by running a uniform axial current through the entire region @xmath50 , including the fluid .",
    "given the @xmath20-component of the electric current , @xmath51 , one finds for the current helicity of the background field @xmath52 which may be positive , negative , or zero .",
    "the inner value @xmath53 is normalized by the uniform vertical field , i.e. @xmath54 for our standard profile @xmath55 we have @xmath56 for the helicity of the background field . for fixed toroidal field amplitude",

    "interchanging @xmath60 simply interchanges left and right spirals , @xmath61 .",
    "as usual , the toroidal field amplitude is measured by the hartmann number and the global rotation by the reynolds number , i.e. = ,   re=. [ ha ] @xmath62 is used as the unit of length , @xmath63 as the unit of velocity and @xmath53 as the unit of the azimuthal fields .",

    "for both series , both helicities have the opposite sign as @xmath59 ( see also kpyl & brandenburg 2009 ) for comparison ) . in stating this result , it is important though to specify carefully the nature of the initial conditions used in each run . for @xmath97 ,",
    "the basic state has a sufficiently strong handedness that it forces the instabilities to have a particular parity as well , which as indicated turns out to be opposite to that of the basic state .",
    "if one then gradually increases @xmath59 , each time using the previous solution as the new initial condition , this parity of the instabilities is preserved all way to @xmath98 , where the basic state no longer has a handedness , and both left and right instabilities could exist equally well , as in fig .",
    "[ heltor ] .    that is , by the time one reaches @xmath99 , say , the basic state makes sufficiently little distinction between left and right modes that both could exist , but because of the way we have reached @xmath99 , we consistently obtain the right mode .",
    "however , suppose one does the following experiment now : take the right mode at @xmath99 , swap its parity to be left , and use that as a new initial condition for a series of runs where @xmath59 is now gradually reduced .",
    "eventually there comes a point where the basic state s handedness is sufficiently great that it no longer allows the instability to have the ` wrong ' parity , and the solution reverts back to the right mode .",
    "this feature that both left and right modes are allowed for sufficiently large @xmath59 ( where the degeneracy between the two modes is only weakly broken ) but not for smaller @xmath59 ( where the degeneracy is strongly broken ) is in many ways analogous to an imperfect pitchfork bifurcation .",
    "we have also calculated the @xmath0-effect in ( [ 3 ] ) with the same averaging procedure over the azimuth . because of the complex structure of the background field it is even possible to determine parts of the tensorial structure of the @xmath0-tensor .",
    "in particular we are interested in the signs and amplitudes of the @xmath0-effect in both azimuthal and axial directions . according to the general rule that the azimuthal @xmath0-effect is anticorrelated with the ( kinetic ) helicity we expect the azimuthal @xmath0-effect to be positive for @xmath100 .",
