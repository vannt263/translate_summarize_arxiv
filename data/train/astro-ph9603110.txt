    "rosat observations of isolated neutron stars with characteristic ages of a few @xmath4 years ( psr  0656 + 14 , psr  1055 - 52 , geminga ) have shown that the bulk of their x  ray emission is thermal in origin and may result from neutron star cooling ( see gelman 1995 for a review ) .",
    "the observed periodic modulation in the x  ray flux indicates the presence of large thermal gradients on the surface of these magnetized neutron stars . for a given surface temperature distribution ,",
    "the degree of modulation depends on the intrinsic geometry of the source and on its orientation relative to the observer , which in the case of radio pulsars can be inferred from the shape , polarization and spectrum of the radio pulses .",
    "psr  0656 + 14 , first studied in the soft x ",
    "ray range with the einstein observatory ( cordova et al .",
    "1989 ) , is the brightest  middle - aged  neutron star in this energy band .",
    "its association with a possible x  ray supernova remnant , the gemini  monoceros ring ( nousek et al .",
    "1981 ; thompson et al . 1991 ) has recently been criticized , on the basis of new results on the proper motion of the pulsar ( thompson & cordova 1994 ) .",
    "a candidate optical counterpart with v@xmath5 has been discovered by caraveo , bignami & mereghetti ( 1994 ) within 1  of the radio position of psr  0656 + 14 .",
    "three pointings of psr  0656 + 14 were carried out with the rosat pspc detector ( 1991 march 26 , 1992 march 24 and april 15 ) . while the first observation ( @xmath63200 s ) has been presented in detail by finley , gelman & kizilolu ( 1992 ) ,",
    "only the preliminary results of the two 1992 pointings have been reported ( gelman 1995 ) .    in this paper",
    "we analyze all the pspc data of psr  0656 + 14 and interpret them in the context of a simple model for its temperature distribution coupled with the geometrical configuration derived from the radio data . on the basis of the new observational results , the paper carries out an analysis similar to the one presented by page ( 1995a ) on psr  0656 + 14 and explores the effect of polar cap emission on the light curves and spectra .",
    "our spectral analysis is based on the sum of the three observations , for a total exposure time of about 17000 s. the source counts were extracted from a circular region ( 3 radius ) centered at the position of psr  0656 + 14 . the background was estimated from a concentric annular region with radii 4 and 10 ( due to the high source count rate of @xmath7 ct s@xmath8 , the results are not significantly dependent on the particular region used for the background determination ) .",
    "the selected counts ( @xmath9 , in channels 11240 ) were rebinned in order to achieve a minimum signal to noise ratio of 7 in each energy channel and then fitted to different model spectra .",
    "single component models ( power law , blackbody , thermal bremsstrahlung ) gave unacceptable results .",
    "figure 1 shows the fit residuals obtained in the case of a blackbody ( the model giving the lowest @xmath10 ) . while such a model was still compatible with the data of the first observation alone ( finley et al .",
    "1992 ) , the better statistics of the complete data set clearly require the presence of a second , harder component dominating the x  ray emission above @xmath6 1  kev .",
    "we therefore considered composite models , consisting of a `` soft '' blackbody and a `` hard tail '' in the form of either a second blackbody or a power law .",
    "for the former case ( see figure  2a ) a good fit ( @xmath10=1.07 for 74  dof ) was obtained with blackbody temperatures @xmath119.1 @xmath12 and @xmath131.9@xmath14 for the soft and hard components , respectively , and an interstellar absorption @xmath156.9@xmath16 @xmath17 figure  3 ( a , b ) gives the confidence contours for these quantities , while table  1 summarizes the best fit values of all the parameters .",
    "the flux in the soft component implies an emitting region with radius @xmath1814 km ( for a distance of 760  pc ; taylor et al .",
    "for the same distance , the total luminosity is about @xmath19erg s@xmath20 figure  2b shows the best fit with a blackbody plus power law , corresponding to a reduced @xmath10=1.05 .",
    "the best fit photon index is @xmath21 contrary to the previous case , in this spectral decomposition both components have a similar flux . in the fit of the hard tail with a power law ,",
    "one obtains values for @xmath22 and for the soft balckbody temperature significantly higher than those of the two blackbody fit ( see figures  3c and 3d ) .",
    ".results of the spectral fit of psr  0656 + 14 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the adopted parameters of reference are shown in the central column .",
    "next to them , we report a set of values spanning the reliable range of variability for each quantity .",
    "the pulsed fractions indicated below each number are those obtained by setting all the other parameters at the reference values .",
    "the observed pulsed fraction is in the range [ 810% ] .",
    "based on the above model and using the values of @xmath23 obtained from the spectral fits of @xmath24 , we have simulated various light curves . @xmath25 and @xmath26 are fixed by choosing different values of @xmath27 and the corresponding light curves are compared to the observations .",
    "if psr 0656 + 14 is in the geometrical configuration proposed by rankin ( @xmath28 ) , the calculated light curves can satisfactorily reproduce the observed degree of modulation only if 1.10@xmath291.15 .",
    "figure  4 compares the observed 0.12.4 kev light curve to that computed with the values of reference shown in the central column of table  [ tab : integ_par ] , giving a pulsed fraction @xmath30 if @xmath27 is increased , @xmath31 reduces significantly and the resulting light curves are inconsistent with the observation .",
    "as shown in table  [ tab : integ_par ] , @xmath31 is little affected by the values of the remaining parameters , except for @xmath32 ( which can not be much larger than 10@xmath33 otherwise the pulsar would not be visible in the radio band ) .",
    "the emission from the polar caps gives only a modest increase to the pulsed fraction in the 0.1  2.4 kev range , dominated by the contribution of the softer blackbody .",
    "following the same procedure , we have computed the light curves for the angles suggested by lyne & manchester ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "our model can not explain the relatively high observed modulation , even for the unacceptable value of @xmath351.00@xmath36 .",
    "using the combination of parameters which maximizes the modulation , the predicted @xmath31 would reach at most 4@xmath37 , much less than the minimum value compatible with the observations .",
    "thus , as also indicated by page ( 1995a ) , the small dipole inclination angle proposed by lyne & manchester ( 1988 ) can not account for the observed pulsed fraction ( see also possenti , mereghetti & colpi 1996 ) .",
    "the rosat spectral and timing analysis of psr  0656 + 14 indicate that its soft x  ray emission is characterized by two separate components .",
    "the blackbody temperature of the softer component ( @xmath38k ) , independent of the model used for the hard tail , is similar to that derived by finley et al .",
    "( 1992 ) .    the hard tail can be described equally well by a blackbody or by a steep power law . in the blackbody case , it is natural to attribute the hard component to localized emission from hotter regions of the star surface , e.g. the polar caps , as discussed above . in the case of a power law",
    ", the tail can be interpreted as a non - thermal emission of magnetospheric origin . the best fit power law index ( @xmath39 ) is greater than that observed in psr  105552 ( @xmath40 , gelman & finley 1993 ) and geminga ( @xmath41 , halpern & ruderman 1993 ) , the other isolated neutron stars of comparable age and with a similar two component soft x  ray emission .",
    "these two objects have also been clearly observed at @xmath42-ray energies ( e@xmath43100 mev ) , contrary to psr  0656 + 14 for which only a marginal detection , at a much lower flux , has been claimed ( ramanamurthy et al .",
    "this fact might indicate a possible connection between the level of @xmath42ray emission and the slope of the hard x  ray tail .    with a model for the anisotropic thermal cooling induced by the crustal , dipolar magnetic field ( similar to our first component ) , page ( 1995a )",
    "derived for psr  0656 + 14 pulsed fractions between 8 and 10% , smaller than that ( @xmath4414% ) reported by finley et al .",
    "this result is confirmed by our analysis of the complete pspc data set .",
    "we show that , even in the most favourable geometric configuration ( @xmath45 ) among those compatible with the radio data , the observed modulation can be reproduced only for @xmath461.15 ( corresponding to @xmath474 , where @xmath48 is the schwarzschild radius ) .",
    "these low values of @xmath49 are consistent with a stellar radius between @xmath50 and @xmath51 km and a neutron star mass @xmath52 . for m = 1.4 @xmath53",
    ", our limit on @xmath49 requires a radius @xmath54 km , a value inconsistent with the most recent neutron star models ( glendenning 1985 ; wiringa et al .",
    "masses below 1.4 @xmath53 have radii sufficiently large to account for the observed modulation in the x - ray signal , only if the equation of state is very stiff ( page 1995a ) .",
    "the presence of higher order moments in the magnetic field , or the effects of a magnetized atmosphere causing anisotropic photon transport have been proposed as solutions for increasing the light curve modulation ( page 1995a , 1995b ) .",
    "our analysis shows that the alternative possibility of obtaining a higher modulation by including the additional contribution of hot polar caps does not solve the problem .",
    "the polar cap emission has little effect on the overall modulation , if its temperature and intensity are to be consistent with the observed spectra .",
