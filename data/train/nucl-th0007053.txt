    "recently data on @xmath0 annihilation in the range 40 - 400 mev / c ( for the laboratory @xmath4 momentum @xmath5 ) have been produced by the obelix collaboration@xcite .",
    "we would like to compare these with other data on @xmath1 and @xmath6-nucleus annihilation .",
    "in particular , we are interested in : @xmath4 annihilation on nuclei from @xmath7c to @xmath8pb in the range 180 - 280 mev / c@xcite ; @xmath1 annihilation from 30 to 180 mev / c@xcite ; @xmath3d , @xmath9he and @xmath10ne at small momenta , down to 45 mev / c@xcite ; @xmath3-nucleus annihilation on intermediate nuclei at larger momenta ( over 200 mev / c , see@xcite for a recollection of these data ) ; and on the ratio between @xmath1 and @xmath2 annihilations inside nuclear targets@xcite",
    ". we will start by comparing @xmath1 and @xmath0 data , and then we will try to correlate these with the low energy nuclear data .",
    "one of our aims is simply to compare @xmath0 and @xmath1 annihilation cross sections .",
    "this comparison is a delicate operation , because it requires subtraction of coulomb effects , and comparison of data coming from different experiments with antiproton and antineutron beams . due to the difficulties in calculating a 100 % reliable flux normalization , it is preferable , as far as possible , to compare data from the same experiment .",
    "a second goal of this work is to establish which is the degree of correlation between antineutron - nucleon and antinucleon - nucleus data . indeed ,",
    "as better discussed later , @xmath1 data below 600 mev / c can be well fitted via energy independent optical potentials , while @xmath0 data show a nontrivial energy dependence that should be reflected in the energy dependence of nuclear annihilations .",
    "another interesting point is the role of the different isospin channels in the low energy nuclear shadowing .",
    "it has been demonstrated that a marked nuclear shadowing characterizes low energy @xmath6-nucleus annihilation cross sections@xcite .",
    "for this phenomenon it is possible to imagine two classes of explainations .",
    "first , general quantum mechanical processes , as described in a later section .",
    "mechanisms of this kind do not discriminate too much between different annihilation channels . on the other side we may imagine a role for peculiar properties of single nuclear species .",
    "indeed , the data are rather incomplete and impossible to organize in a systematic way . in particular a different @xmath11 composition , or a different @xmath11 distribution near the nuclear surface can be relevant , since most of the theoretical models ( for reviews see e.g. @xcite ) establish peculiar properties for the different isospin channels , properties which are normally derived either from g - parity ( or c - parity@xcite ) transformations of the better known nucleon - nucleon potentials , or from peculiar quark diagrams .",
    "so , to summarize this point , it is relevant to establish how much of the low energy nuclear shadowing of annihilation processes can be due to general mechanisms , and how much is due to the nuclear composition in terms of protons and neutrons , and to the details of the nuclear structure .",
    "we limit ourselves to a phenomenological analysis of the data , with standard methods of nuclear physics , without entering the debate about the underlying hadronic structure mechanisms governing the annihilation process . of course , it is not always possible to separate completely the two levels of the analysis , i.e. nuclear and hadronic .",
    "wide reviews on the debate concerning the annihilation mechanisms can be found in the references listed above .",
    "experimental ( scattering and annihilation ) data up to 1994 are recollected in @xcite , data on antiprotonic atoms up to 1988 in @xcite , and a very recent account of the many problems related with the antinucleon experimental techniques can be found in @xcite .",
    "we still lack a well founded method that can be properly used at low energies to link the shadowing properties ( that automatically arise from an optical potential treatment@xcite ) with the details of the nuclear structure and internal motions ( which are taken into account in impulse approximation inspired treatments ) .",
    "the main exception in this respect is deuteron , which has been considered by some authors@xcite and where it was possible to relate clearly the overall antinucleon - nucleus processes with the antinucleon - nucleon interactions . with more complex nuclei , optical potential analyses have been carried on to study antiprotonic atoms@xcite . at momenta over 200 mev",
    "/ c the kmt method@xcite has been used in @xcite and the glauber method@xcite in @xcite ( and probably in other works ) . in the present work",
    "our hope is that some interesting information can be separately extracted from a pwia and an optical potential analysis .    for the sake of brevity we will indicate total @xmath4 and @xmath3 annihilation cross sections with tna and tpa respectively , specifying the target .",
    "we will indicate as @xmath12 the ratio between @xmath2 and @xmath1 annihilations in a given nucleus with atomic number @xmath13 .    concerning the choice of an optical potential for discussing nucleon - antinucleon annihilation",
    ", it is well known that many quite different optical potentials fitted successfully pre - obelix nucleon - antinucleon data@xcite and they can probably fit the data under discussion too , since these data do not represent such a strong contraint . here and in previous papers@xcite we have relied on very simple optical potentials , with woods - saxon shape , the same parameters for each spin channel and no energy dependence in the momentum range 0 - 600 mev / c ( more indications are given in section 3 ) .",
    "although such potentials can not reproduce the full phenomenology of nucleon - antinucleon interactions , they seem sufficient for fitting the available @xmath1 low energy data . with the @xmath0",
    "annihilation data , as described in section 3 , a higher level of sophistication is perhaps necessary .",
    "comparison of annihilation data with different projectiles and targets is nonsense without subtracting coulomb effects at momenta below 200 mev / c .",
    "the traditional estimation@xcite has undercome modifications@xcite in the last years .",
    "qualitatively the effect of the coulomb forces is to focus the projectile wavefunction in the annihilation region , which is a spherical shell of thickness 0.5 - 1 fm@xcite at the target proton / nucleus surface .    in a previous work@xcite we gave analytical expressions for the correcting @xmath3-nucleus enhancement factors .",
    "e.g. , for the @xmath1 annihilation cross section the enhancement factor can be reproduced within 5 % in the range 30 - 400 mev / c by the function @xmath14 . to calculate the enhancement factor we considered some completely different optical potentials .",
    "all of them included the electrostatic potential of a spherical charge distribution and fitted the available low energy data .",
    "then we removed the electrostatic potential and calculated again the annihilation rates .",
    "the obtained coulomb enhancement factor was sufficiently independent of the choice of the strong part of the optical potential , in the considered momentum range .",
    "an observation is necessary concerning apparent `` violations '' of the isospin invariance .",
    "isospin symmetry suggests that : ( i ) @xmath0 cross sections are equal to @xmath2 ones ; ( ii ) @xmath1 and @xmath15 are equal apart from electromagnetic effects ; ( iii ) the four cross sections that one can imagine are actually combinations of two . in principle",
    "this is undoubtful , but in practice it does not work , and an example can clarify the point . normally , @xmath0 data come from collisions between free antineutrons and protons , while @xmath2 cross sections are extracted from deuteron targets , with two consequences :    \\1 ) the antiproton is attracted by the deuteron charge .",
    "the range of action of the coulomb forces is much larger than the deuteron radius , with the result that the @xmath2 annihilation rate is almost as much `` coulomb distorted '' as the @xmath1 one , so it should be expected to be larger ( much larger at very low energies ) than the @xmath0 one .",
    "this problem is not present at momenta @xmath16 100 mev / c , where coulomb focusing effects can be neglected .",
    "\\2 ) as already noticed@xcite , below 60 mev / c shadowing effects in nuclei are so strong that the @xmath3d annihilation cross section is smaller than the corresponding @xmath1 one in the laboratory frame , or approximately equal in the center of mass frame ( due to the different transformations relating laboratory with center of mass variables for the cases of proton and deuteron targets ) . in both cases",
    "@xmath17 is much smaller than @xmath18 .",
    "the previous example should clarify that , although it is very likely that one would find @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 in an experiment on @xmath22 neutrons , comparisons involving different isospin channels for @xmath5 @xmath23 100",
    "mev / c should be performed with the greatest care as far as free neutron targets , or antiproton targets , are not available .",
    "one should therefore be aware that an isospin decomposition can not be completely free from model dependence .",
    "recent experimental data@xcite show that at antinucleon momenta ( in the laboratory ) below 60 mev / c the nuclear shadowing effect is very strong . below 60 mev",
    "/ c antiproton annihilation rates on deuteron and @xmath24he are smaller than on hydrogen .",
    "the annihilation rate on @xmath25ne is larger but not that much@xcite .",
    "this and related phenomena has been discussed by us and other authors@xcite .    rather independently of the mechanism underlying the annihilation process , it had been previously demonstrated that in the framework of the multiple scattering theory@xcite , of variational methods@xcite and of optical potential treatments@xcite one can predict such shadowing effects .",
    "it has been reported@xcite that also in the coupled - channel approach one can obtain the same result .",
    "the fact that different methods lead to similar results suggested us to investigate the problem from a more general and qualitative , although less precise , point of view . in our work@xcite",
    "we have shown that due to the quantum uncertainty principle the @xmath4-nucleus cross sections should be almost @xmath13-independent , apart for fluctuations due to nuclear surface effects .",
    "consequently the @xmath3-nucleus cross sections should depend on the target because of its electric charge only .",
    "the underlying argument is that most of the existing models ( see the suggested references @xcite ) and analyses@xcite establish that the annihilation process takes place when the centers of mass of the antinucleon and of the target nucleus are at a relative distance @xmath26 such that @xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath26 @xmath28 @xmath29 , where @xmath30 @xmath31 1 fm ( or smaller , depending on the model ) does not depend too much on the target .",
    "so the annihilation is equivalent to a measurement of the projectile - target relative distance with uncertainty @xmath30 @xmath28 1 fm , and this measurement is incompatible with a relative momentum @xmath23 200 mev / c .    to see it another way , we distinguish between two classes of nuclear reactions . on one side , inelastic reactions where the entire nucleus is involved , as in compound nucleus reactions , but the underlying projectile - nucleon processes are elastic ( e.g. neutron induced nuclear reactions ) . in this case",
    "the characteristic reaction region coincides approximately with the target nucleus .",
    "then the uncertainty @xmath30 coincides approximately with the nuclear radius . on the other side , we find reactions where a strong inelasticity is present at the projectile - nucleon level . in this case",
    "reactions deep inside the nuclear volume are rare , the reaction region is a shell at the surface of the target nucleus , with thickness @xmath30 , and @xmath30 is approximately the same for all the possible targets .",
    "the consequence of the limitations imposed by the uncertainty principle is that for antinucleon momenta @xmath5 @xmath23 @xmath32 the total reaction cross section becomes much smaller than its possible unitarity limit .",
    "this is also established by the well known@xcite low energy limit for the phase shifts : @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 for @xmath5 @xmath36 0 .",
    "the unitarity limit is reached when a partial wave is completely absorbed in the reaction process , which means @xmath37 @xmath38 0 , i.e. @xmath39 @xmath38 @xmath40 , so the unitarity limit can not be attained at small enough @xmath5 .",
    "uncertainty considerations suggest that for @xmath5 @xmath16 @xmath32 it is possible , for strong enough reactions , to saturate the unitarity limit , while for @xmath5 @xmath23 @xmath32 we are in the situation where @xmath33 @xmath38 @xmath41 , whatever the strength of the reaction .",
    "a paradoxical consequence is that a smaller @xmath30 corresponds to what would be a stronger reaction at large energies , so that at low energies `` stronger '' interactions can lead to a smaller reaction rate .",
    "this fact can be verified in optical potential treatments .    on the ground that the projectile wavefunction @xmath42 is completely damped within a range @xmath30",
    "( i.e @xmath43 is large for @xmath44 @xmath45 @xmath29 and very small for @xmath44 @xmath28 @xmath27 ) it is straightforward to demonstrate that for the scattering length @xmath46 we have ( approximately ) :    @xmath47 @xmath20 @xmath48 ,    @xmath49 @xmath20 @xmath50 .",
    "indeed , the @xmath42 damping requirement implies for the logarithmic derivative @xmath51 @xmath20 @xmath32 .",
    "this is an obvious geometrical fact , but in more physical terms it is a consequence of the uncertainty principle . together with the matching condition between the logarithmic derivatives of the free motion wavefunction and of the wavefunction in the annihilation region @xmath52",
    "@xmath38 @xmath53 this leads to the previous @xmath46-values in the limit @xmath5 @xmath36 0 .",
    "these values of course are deduced from approximate equations , so they represent just estimates , however they suggest that the antineutron annihilation cross sections should not show a @xmath54 increase with the target mass number @xmath13 .",
    "such an increase could be present for antiproton annihilations , but because of coulomb effects only .",
    "when going to any specific target nucleus , non - systematic effects could be present , especially related with the structure of the nuclear surface .",
    "an example is given in ref.@xcite .",
    "there , anomalous behaviors are related with the non - sphericity of the nucleus .",
    "another exception should be represented by neutron - halo nuclei , because in this case the annihilation range could be much larger than 1 fm .",
    "also the composition of the nuclear surface in terms of protons or neutrons could be important , since all models attribute a strong isospin dependence to the antinucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "the exposed mechanism has an interesting consequence in the case of optical potential analyses : an increase of the strength of the imaginary part of the optical potential can lead to a decrease of the consequent reaction rate at small momenta@xcite . in the above language , an increase in the potential strength leads to a decrease in the size parameter @xmath30 , since the absorption of the projectile wavefunction takes place in a shorter range . also modification of other parameters ( radius , diffuseness , etc ) leads to consequences that are not necessarily the most obvious ones .",
    "an example is given in the next section .",
    "in fig . 1 we show the tna and tpa on hydrogen , together with two fits by energy - independent optical potentials . for the @xmath1 case the total interaction includes the electrostatic potential of a spherical charge distribution with radius 1.25 fm .",
    "this charge radius is @xmath56 times the charge radius of the proton , to take into account both the proton and the antiproton extended charges .",
    "details on the potential are given below .",
    "a third optical potential curve shows what would be the @xmath1 cross section in absence of electrostatic interactions , within the same optical model .",
    "what we notice first is that tna and tpa are reasonably similar for @xmath5 @xmath45 200 mev / c , but below 200 mev / c the tna falls clearly below the tpa , and this fall can not be justified in terms of coulomb interactions only , although these contribute .",
    "we could speak of `` low energy fall '' with respect to a `` background '' which is similar to the @xmath1 case .",
    "alternatively one can think that the tna sums two contributions : a monotonous background that is proportional to the @xmath1 annihilation rate ( coulomb effects apart ) but lower , and a broad peak ( resonance ? ) at @xmath5 @xmath31 200@xmath57300 mev / c .",
    "this broad peak would be hidden by the isospin-0 background and by the low energy coulomb rise in the tpa case .",
    "some of the available data at momenta @xmath45 400 mev / c ( see @xcite for a more systematic review of these data ) could support the `` peak '' idea , since at these momenta the @xmath0 annihilation rate seems to be lower than the @xmath1 one , but it is not unequivocally clear how much lower .",
    "indeed , one @xmath0 point at 700 mev / c by @xcite is clearly below the @xmath1 annihilation , while data reported in @xcite are not very different from the corresponding @xmath1 data@xcite in the region 300 - 500 mev / c . on the other side , some data at very low energy@xcite support the `` gap '' idea , since they show a rise of the @xmath0 annihilation rate @xmath58 below 50 mev / c .",
    "these data have been reported in the figure , and the one at 20 mev / c lies on the optical potential extrapolation of the @xmath1 data , once the electrostatic part of the potential has been removed .",
    "the authors of ref.@xcite also report some potential predictions@xcite that support the existence of a minimum for the @xmath0 annihilation rate @xmath59 at 50 - 100 mev / c , and a set of scattering length predictions@xcite that show no great differences between @xmath1 and @xmath0 expected scattering lengths .",
    "they also report a collection of pre - obelix @xmath4 data .",
    "we must remark that the normalization of antineutron fluxes is a delicate matter , with the consequence that both a comparison of antineutron data coming from different experiments , and a comparison of antineutron and antiproton data , must be taken with the greatest caution .",
    "so we will generically speak of a `` gap / peak structure '' of the @xmath0 annihilation rate compared to the @xmath1 one .",
    "we will show in the next section that a comparison with nuclear data supports the existence of this gap / peak structure .",
    "whatever the interpretation , there are some important remarks :    \\1 ) the strong oscillation of the tna with respect to the tpa ( see also fig.4 ) is an evidence of the fact that different physical mechanisms are dominating in the two cases in the considered momentum range .",
    "if a resonance is present this is obvious .",
    "if there is no resonance , according to the partial wave analyses presented in refs.@xcite the tna p - wave has its maximum at @xmath5 @xmath20 250",
    "mev / c where it attains the value 120 - 140 mb . our optical potential fit ( which seems good for the tpa ) fixes the tpa p - wave maximum to about 80 mb at 150 mev / c .",
    "semiclassical intuition fixes the corresponding impact parameters @xmath60 @xmath38 @xmath61 to 1.25 fm ( tpa ) and 0.8 fm ( tna ) .",
    "then , purely geometrical considerations suggest a ratio , between the size of the two p - wave outcomes at their peak momentum , tna / tpa @xmath31 @xmath62 @xmath20 0.4 instead of the found value 1.6 . the most obvious conclusion would be that the p - wave interaction is much more effective in the @xmath0 case , where it acts at smaller impact parameters ( by a factor 0.6 ) .",
    "this short range interaction does not affect the s - wave contribution , which is clearly larger in the @xmath1 case ( even after subtracting coulomb effects ) at momenta over 30 mev / c . at lower momenta ( that means longer range ) the two s - wave contributions could be equal , according to@xcite and references therein .",
    "so the geometry and strength of the isospin-1 and isospin-0 channel interactions must be different , as far as these semiclassical considerations can be trusted .",
    "\\2 ) absurd as it may sound , the fact that at small momenta tna are sensibly smaller than tpa could mean that the interactions are stronger in the @xmath0 case than in the @xmath1 one .",
    "this can be immediately seen in the choice of the optical model parameters .",
    "we used a woods - saxon form , with all parameters , but one , equal for tpa and tna .",
    "tpa : imaginary strength 8000 mev , real strength 46 mev ( attractive ) , imaginary radius 0.52 fm , real radius 1.89 fm , real and imaginary diffuseness 0.15 fm .",
    "these values fall in the ranges used by previous authors to fit elastic data@xcite , and its imaginary part is pretty similar to other previously used optical potentials ( e.g. the one of ref.@xcite ) .",
    "many other sets of parameters , and also different potential shapes , can lead to similar results for the available low - energy data . starting from this peculiar set , to obtain the tna curve it is sufficient to increase the imaginary radius to 0.75 fm .",
    "alternatively , one can obtain the tna curve by leaving the imaginary radius at 0.51 fm and increasing the imaginary strength to about 12000 - 16000 mev .",
    "so , to get a smaller cross section we need a `` stronger '' potential .",
    "this `` inversion '' behavior is another manifestation of the general shadowing mechanism discussed in section 3 . in an optical potential model at small @xmath5 an increase ,",
    "e.g. , of the imaginary strength @xmath63 produces an increase of the reaction cross section for small values of @xmath63 only . after a certain threshold , further increases of @xmath63",
    "lead to a decrease of the reaction cross section@xcite . at a qualitative level",
    "this can be explained by the uncertainty principle : an increase in the strength of the imaginary part of the potential decreases the thickness of that spherical shell , surrounding the proton / nucleus target , where annihilations are supposed to take place .",
    "this introduces larger gradients in the projectile wavefunction .",
    "these larger gradients imply a larger logarithmic derivative , and therefore a smaller ( imaginary part of the ) scattering length .",
    "\\3 ) in the case of @xmath1 annihilations below 600 mev / c many quite different choices of potential parameters can fit them@xcite ( including a pure imaginary potential ) without introducing a dependence of the parameters on energy .",
    "all these fits share some common features .",
    "they reproduce the data very well below 150 mev / c and above 300 mev / c .",
    "the fits remain satisfactory up to 600 mev / c . in the region 150 - 300 mev / c the fits stay slightly below the data .",
    "alternatively , it is possible to choose the parameters so as to reproduce the data from 150 to 600 mev / c , while at lower momenta the fits are above the data .",
    "so , we could say that an energy independent optical potential can produce a `` background '' around which a slight oscillation is present ( positive for @xmath5 in the range 150 - 300 mev / c , or negative for @xmath5 @xmath28 150",
    "mev / c ) . in the tna case",
    "the situation is qualitatively the same , but the oscillation is much stronger and more evident .",
    "so it seems that an energy - independent optical potential fit can be well related with the isospin-0 channel , which seemingly consists of the `` background '' only .",
    "a background with the same shape is also present in the isospin-1 channel , but this channel also contains an oscillation that is not reproduced by our set of optical potentials .",
    "as already remarked , we have no means to establish the nature of this oscillation .",
    "\\4 ) we have also tried to change our optical potential shape so as to produce resonances that fit the gap / peak structure which is seen in the @xmath0 annihilation .",
    "we can not exclude that more attempts can lead to a good reproduction of the data in fig.1 ( in the described `` inversion plus resonance '' regime there is no predictable relation between the changes of the potential and the shape of the output , which makes such attempts rather frustrating ) .",
    "we have not been able to reproduce satisfactorily these data , and perhaps more sophisticated potentials are necessary .",
    "it was however easy to get shapes that @xmath64 looked similar .",
    "we tried with two kinds of potential : ( i ) woods - saxon ( with attractive elastic part ) ( ii ) woods - saxon like the previous one , plus a repulsive elastic surface barreer of gaussian shape ( of the kind @xmath65 $ ] ) .",
    "in both cases to get a broad peak where it must be it was necessary to enlarge the range of the elastic part to 2.5 - 3 fm .",
    "this is probably due to the fact that , despite the smallness of the radius of the imaginary part , most of the annihilations take place at @xmath44 @xmath20 1 fm .",
    "so only a much wider attractive well can produce metastable states , within such models . perhaps in a more sophisticated potential model , where different spin channels are clearly separated , it is possible to get a resonance in a spin channel where annihilation is less effective , so without the need for such a long range for the potential .",
    "we think that these interesting data really demand for a higher level potential analysis .",
    "because of the shadowing , a complete analysis of annihilations in nuclei below 60 mev / c is pretty complicated .",
    "a simple comparison of different sets of data reveals interesting features , however , and we can also hope to understand something by a pwia analysis , especially at momenta over 100 mev / c . in particular , the energy dependences of the @xmath0 annihilation cross section , of the @xmath4-nucleus one , and of the ratio of @xmath2 to the @xmath1 annihilation in nuclei , show evident correlations .",
    "of course nuclear shadowing effects are completely absent in pwia , and this must be taken into account , taking with great care the calculations below 100 mev / c . at larger momenta the main missed effect is the eclipse effect@xcite which implies an almost energy independent surface absorption factor @xmath20 0.5 .",
    "we take this factor into account by renormalizing our pwia predictions with one datum at a specified momentum value over 200 mev / c .    at small momenta however ( below @xmath31 200",
    "mev / c ) shadowing is something more complicated than a mere eclipse effect .",
    "the eclipse effect could never bring @xmath3 annihilation rates to decrease with increasing @xmath13 .",
    "so we may only @xmath66 as `` shadowing '' the departures from pwia predictions , and remark that they are consistent . as we show later , anyway ,",
    "a certain part of the smallness of the low energy @xmath3-deuteron annihilation rate with respect to the @xmath1 one is not a shadowing effect , but just due to the smallness of the @xmath2 annihilation rate below 150 mev / c .    in fig.2 we show the @xmath4-nucleus data , relative to momenta between 180 and 280 mev / c , for several nuclear species from @xmath7c to @xmath8pb ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "these data are consistent with an @xmath67 law , expressing dominant surface absorption , @xmath68 @xmath69 .",
    "however the @xmath67 law found in these data can not be generalized to @xmath0 or @xmath1 ( coulomb subtracted ) data in the laboratory frame , while this generalization is only approximately possible in the center of mass frame . at 180 mev / c ,",
    "the @xmath7c or the @xmath8 pb tna , divided by @xmath67 , give about 150 mb .",
    "the corresponding @xmath0 and ( coulomb subtracted ) @xmath1 cross sections are @xmath20 200 mb at the same laboratory momentum . at the same center of mass momentum , which corresponds to 360 mev / c in the laboratory ,",
    "the @xmath0 total annihilation cross section is about 130 mb , and the @xmath1 one is slightly smaller than the @xmath0 one .",
    "so , in both cases we find deviations from the @xmath67 law at @xmath70 @xmath20 100 mev / c , but these deviations are of opposite sign if the data are compared at the same laboratory or center of mass momentum .",
    "it is difficult to establish whether it is more proper to compare data relative to different nuclear species at the same laboratory or center of mass momentum .",
    "impulse approximation based models suggest the same laboratory momentum , compound nucleus inspired models prefer the opposite choice .",
    "indeed , in the former case direct momentum exchange is between the projectile and one of the target nucleons only , whose average initial momentum is zero in the laboratory . in the latter , the projectile momentum is given directly to the entire target nucleus .",
    "an analogous , systematic comparison of all the available @xmath3-nucleus data has been presented elsewhere@xcite .",
    "very recently a new series of @xmath4-nucleus data down to 70 mev / c has been presented@xcite , which show a respected @xmath67 law between different nuclear species .",
    "since these data have been presented as `` preliminary '' , we ca nt discuss them in detail .",
    "considering the energy behavior of the tna on nuclei shown in fig.2 , the most interesting feature is the systematic presence of a shoulder .",
    "however this phenomenon seems less evident in the just quoted preliminary data .",
    "tpa data in this region are not enough to to give us shape information . however , the optical potential calculations that we have reported in @xcite suggest that the coulomb enhancement at low energies can easily hide such details in the energy dependence of the annihilation data .",
    "different relevant mechanisms must be taken into account in the momentum range 100 - 300 mev / c :    \\1 ) the tail of the low energy shadowing phenomenon .",
    "presently we have no knowledge of tpa and tna on heavy nuclei at @xmath5 @xmath23 100 mev / c , so we do not know whether the discussed shadowing is a systematic phenomenon ( as we suggest in the previous section 2 ) or is simply peculiar of some light nucleus . and in light nuclei we do not have enough tpa data in the region 100 - 300 mev / c to understand completely the transition between large and low energy regimes .",
    "there are several sets of data , but regretfully we do not have a satisfactorily continuous set of data relative to the same projectile on the same target ( with the exception of the @xmath1 and @xmath0 cases ) .",
    "\\3 ) the nuclear fermi motion .",
    "the fermi momentum , which represents a rough cutoff of the nuclear momentum distribution , is @xmath20 200 mev / c .",
    "this means that for @xmath5 @xmath28 200 mev / c the statistical distribution of the relative @xmath4-nucleon motion contains the zero - energy point , and that it is easy for a target nucleon to be faster than the projectile .",
    "so the projectile momentum 200 mev / c represents a kind of special borderline in the physics of annihilations on nuclei .",
    "\\4 ) the @xmath0 annihilation cross section presents the above discussed gap / peak structure below 300 mev / c .",
    "the nuclear fermi motion will soften this structure , but perhaps not enough to make it completely disappear .",
    "a pwia calculation can give some qualitative understanding about the roles of the gap / peak structure and of the fermi motion in the nuclear tna , and also about the relative role of neutrons and protons in the target .",
    "in fig.3 we present a pwia calculation of the tna on @xmath71ca . in fig.4",
    "we show a pwia calculation of the @xmath12 ratio on deuteron and @xmath24he .",
    "we recall that we have defined @xmath12 as the ratio between @xmath3 annihilations on neutrons and protons inside a nucleus with mass number @xmath13 . in figs . 5 and 6 we show pwia calculations of @xmath3 annihilations on deuteron and @xmath24he .",
    "as a starting point we have used an equation contained in @xmath72 .",
    "although this equation has been justified there by a long series of mathematical passages , its meaning is quite simple and can stand without demonstration : at pwia level , any event rate on a nuclear target , leading to a well defined final state , is an incoherent sum of the rates of all the possible @xmath15 and @xmath0 events leading to the same final state , weighted by the nuclear momentum distribution of the target nucleon . by `` rate '' we mean a cross section divided by the corresponding flux of colliding particles . under the simplifying assumption that different final states sum incoherently we simply have :    @xmath73    where @xmath74 is the relative velocity between two colliding particles with momenta @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "this nuclear pwia average of the antinucleon - nucleon processes clearly misses any eclipse or shadowing effect ( which , e.g. , produces a tna proportional to @xmath67 at large energies ) .",
    "so , the rise of the pwia curve in fig.3 below 150 mev / c is unreliable ( it is just proportional to the average rise of antiproton and antineutron annihilation cross sections on a proton ) . at momenta larger than 150 mev",
    "/ c the pwia should be more reliable , apart for a slowly energy dependent eclipse factor , and could clarify the effects of the fermi motion and the different role of protons and neutrons in the target .    for the @xmath71ca shells we have used harmonic oscillator eigenfunctions .",
    "some attempts with different kinds of states have shown no qualitative differences , unless the nuclear size is changed to unphysical values .",
    "in addition , the most external wavefunctions do not show great differences ( in the energy dependence of the outcome ) with respect to the s - wave ground state .",
    "this is important , because in a more proper dwia ( distorted wave impulse approximation ) treatment the internal shells would be scarcely involved in the annihilation process . for deuteron and @xmath24he ( in fig.4 ) experimental single particle momentum distributions@xcite have been used . again , within this simple model we did not find a great sensitivity of the results on the peculiarities of the momentum distribution , taking into account that many details that could be present in the numerator and in the denominator are lost in the ratios of fig.4 . with deuteron , we surely missed the angular dependence of the large momentum ( d - wave dominated ) part of the distribution .    to calculate the pwia curves of figure 3 we need @xmath0 and @xmath15 annihilation rates .",
    "for fig.4 we need @xmath1 and @xmath2 annihilation rates , both subject to the effect of the deuteron or @xmath24he charge .",
    "the @xmath15 annihilation rate has been assumed to be equal to the coulomb subtracted @xmath1 one ( i.e. the continuous curve of fig.1 ) . in fig.4",
    "we use the same cross sections , so we neglect the effects of the nuclear electrostatic attraction . on the basis of the discussion in section 2",
    "we assume that they do not affect the @xmath12 ratio , although they surely enhance both the @xmath77 and the @xmath78 rates .",
    "actually a look at the data in fig.4 shows that ( with large error bars ) @xmath79 @xmath80 0.48/0.78 @xmath80 0.61 at zero energy , and 0.54/0.82 @xmath80 0.66 at about 600 mev / c . in the case of a different action of the nuclear electrostatic potential on the @xmath1 and @xmath2",
    "cross sections , this effect would be practically absent at 600 mev / c and would depress the @xmath81 ratio with respect to the @xmath82 one at momenta @xmath23 100 mev / c .",
    "the large error bars and data fluctuations do not allow for easy conclusions , however there are no special reasons to assume a different coulomb effect on @xmath1 and @xmath2 reactions , if both the proton and the neutron are bound in the same nucleus .",
    "the obelix @xmath0 data cover the range 60 - 400 mev / c , and the @xmath1 ones start at 30 mev / c .",
    "we therefore had to assume values for these cross sections for momenta outside these ranges . with @xmath1 data at momenta over 200",
    "mev / c we have relied on the data in ref.@xcite , and at momenta below 30 mev / c on our optical potential fit ( after subtraction of coulomb forces as in fig.1 ) . for the @xmath0 case , in the region @xmath5 @xmath45 400 mev / c",
    "the @xmath0 data have been assumed to be equal to the @xmath1 ones , as suggested by the measurements in ref.@xcite and @xcite for momenta over 300 mev / c ( see e.g. @xcite , fig.9 , for a comparison of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 data in that momentum range ) . a look at fig.4 does not help too much .",
    "indeed , we may say that the nuclear fermi motion approximately averages the `` free '' annihilation rates within a 200 mev / c range .",
    "then the point of view of equal `` free '' @xmath1 and @xmath2 annihilation rates at momenta in the range 300 - 600 mev / c can be supported by the absence of a clear decreasing trend in the set of deuteron points over 300 mev / c . on the contrary ,",
    "the helium point at 600 mev / c supports the possibility of a decrease of the free @xmath83 ratio , as suggested by the measurement in ref.@xcite .",
    "anyway , the scatter of data in the deuteron case , and the lack of data in the @xmath24he case prevent us from precise conclusions . in the limit of zero energy",
    ", we have adopted the low energy parametrization of the @xmath0 cross section contained in references@xcite .",
    "it implies a decrease of the @xmath12 ratios at very low energies , which is more suitable for fitting the zero - energy @xmath24he point . adopting the low energy parameters suggested by refs.@xcite would on the contrary rise the zero energy @xmath12 value , which is more coherent with the two zero - energy deuteron points .",
    "the upper curve in fig.3 can be taken as a qualitative confirmation of the effect of the @xmath0 gap / peak structure in producing a very soft shoulder in the @xmath84nucleus annihilations at 150 - 300 mev / c in fig.3 we also show the separate contributions of the @xmath0 and @xmath15 reactions .",
    "evidently the @xmath15 reaction alone would not interrupt the trend of a positive second derivative that characterizes expectance and data at both lower and larger momenta . within pwia",
    "the shoulder is a direct consequence of the gap / peak structure of the @xmath0 cross section .",
    "the fermi motion , as predictable , softens this gap / peak structure , but not completely .",
    "we must also observe that the produced shoulder is much less pronounced than most of the ones seen in fig.2 .",
    "our attempts with different shapes for the nuclear shells show that the shoulder evidence is enhanced by a larger radius of each nuclear shell ( i.e. a narrower momentum distribution ) , however one must arrive at slightly unrealistic nuclear dimensions in order to obtain more evident shoulders .",
    "the strength of the rise of the pwia cross sections below 100 mev / c is probably unphysical , since we know that shadowing could be very active in that region ( although the quoted recent preliminary data @xcite confine shadowing to @xmath5 @xmath28 70 mev / c and with good approximation reproduce the predictions of fig.3 ) . in ref.@xcite some optical potential shapes possibly corresponding to low energy @xmath4-nucleus annihilations are reported , and they are almost energy - independent in the region 100 - 300 mev / c . these optical potentials were based on coulomb - subtracted @xmath1 data and on nuclear cross sections at momenta over 200 mev / c and so have no relation with that gap / peak structure that is peculiar of the @xmath0 interaction .",
    "the data reported in @xcite confirm the ia behavior reported in fig.3 down to 70 mev / c , rather than the these optical potential predictions .",
    "the systematic presence of the gap / peak structure in the tna / tpa ratio is much more evident in fig.4 , where we report the @xmath12 ratio for @xmath13 @xmath38 1 ( @xmath0 data coming from the obelix experiment@xcite divided by the coulomb subtracted @xmath1 annihilation cross section represented by the continuous line in fig.1 ) , for @xmath13 @xmath38 2 ( deuteron ) and @xmath13 @xmath38 4 ( @xmath24he ) .",
    "these deuteron and @xmath24he data come from several experiments and are reviewed in ref.@xcite .",
    "looking at fig.4 one immediately notices that all deuteron points lie above any of the @xmath24he points , and the proton target data are , in the average , clearly over the nuclear target data ( we remark that , although the proton target ratios have been calculated using the `` coulomb subtracted '' @xmath1 annihilation cross section , the effect of the coulomb subtraction is negligible above 100 mev / c ) .",
    "the second observation concerning the data reported in fig.4 is that a certain degree of correlation between the shapes of the three groups of data is present .",
    "since @xmath85 @xmath38 1 both in deuteron and @xmath24he , and the average value of the free @xmath86 ratio is about 1 , clearly pwia can not reproduce the average value of these nuclear @xmath12 distributions . for producing the fits contained in fig.3 we have multiplied the @xmath0 total annihilation cross section by a constant factor @xmath46 , which is 0.8 for deuteron target , and 0.6 for @xmath24he target .",
    "at the largest energies of the considered range the pwia ratio should be reliable .",
    "the known eclipse effect should more or less cancel between numerator and denominator .",
    "anomalous shadowing of the kind discussed in section 3 is not strong over 100 mev / c .",
    "so the reason for @xmath87 @xmath28 @xmath88 @xmath28 @xmath89 @xmath90 1 is unexplained .",
    "a possibility is final state rescattering .",
    "this should not be very effective in total annihilation cross sections , but in the @xmath12 case it can modify the number of charged particles that is used to decide whether the annihilation was on a proton or on a neutron .",
    "it is not unlikely that this @xmath13-dependent renormalization effect has this origin , however one should analyze carefully how each experimental point has been measured .",
    "in the case of @xmath24he the pwia fit reproduces satisfactorily the behavior of the data .",
    "we may say that the gap / peak structure of the free @xmath91 ratio is reproduced by the @xmath81 ratio . in the deuteron case at zero - energy",
    "the fit is not satisfactory , while over 200 mev / c some correlation seems to be present .",
    "somehow the presence of the pwia peak at 280 mev / c ( which is a consequence of the gap / peak structure of the free ratio ) is reflected in the presence of a maximum in the data at 300 mev / c , but the large error bars and the spread of the data do not allow for more quantitative conclusions .    in the last two figures we show some pwia fits of the @xmath3 annihilation cross sections on deuteron and @xmath24he . to obtain these curves the same above method has been used , but the final result has been multiplied , to take the nuclear charge into account in agreement with ref.@xcite , by the factor @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the nuclear charge , @xmath94 is the @xmath3-nucleus relative velocity and the constant @xmath95 is characteristic of the target nucleus .",
    "the exponent ( @xmath571.4 ) has no special physical meaning , since the above @xmath92 factor is only a fitting relation that reproduces within some percent the coulomb enhancement factor in the range 40 - 400 mev / c .",
    "the constant @xmath95 is 0.0060 for deuteron , and 0.0040 for @xmath96 . to take surface absorption into account",
    ", the two pwia fits have been renormalized by a constant factor , the best to reproduce the data ( or some data ) over 200 mev / c .",
    "we remark that : ( i ) this coulomb factor is not relevant from 100 mev / c onward , ( ii ) it is not very different between light nuclei at the same @xmath3 momentum in the laboratory frame , ( iii ) in hydrogen , deuteron and @xmath24he it is near 1.5 at 50 mev / c and 2 at 25 mev / c ( laboratory frame ) .    in the two figures we also report what would be the pwia distribution if the target nucleus were composed by neutrons only or by protons only ( without touching the deuteron and @xmath24he charges , which are taken into account by the @xmath92 factor in any case ) .",
    "the first evident observation is that the effect of the @xmath0 gap / peak structure is much more evident in the deuteron case .",
    "this is due to the compactness of the @xmath24he structure , and to the exactly opposite peculiarity of the deuteron structure .",
    "a more compact space structure implies a broader momentum distribution .",
    "the fermi motion tends to average out the details of the momentum dependence of the nucleon - antinucleon annihilation rates .",
    "this mechanism is more effective with broader nuclear momentum distributions .",
    "another observation is that , if we define shadowing as the departure between the observed data and impulse approximation predictions , this departure becomes evident in both cases below 100 mev / c , but more evident in the @xmath24he case . in the deuteron case",
    "the shadowing phenomenon is less dramatic , but would be overestimated by not taking into account that one of the two nucleons composing this nucleus is a neutron .    concluding this section",
    ", we may say that some evident correlation exists between nuclear data and the behavior of the @xmath0 annihilation rate .",
    "in particular , it would be difficult to justify the shape of the @xmath81 and @xmath82 ratios in absence of the gap / peak structure of the free @xmath91 ratio .",
    "there is some chance that the shoulder found in the @xmath4-nucleus annihilation cross sections is related with the same gap / peak structure , however in this case the situation is much less clear .",
    "still to be clarified is the fact that the energy - averaged value of the @xmath12 ratio decreases at increasing @xmath13 .",
    "the last two figures also show that the energy dependence of the nuclear annihilation rates can be partly explained in terms of the energy dependence of the @xmath3 annihilation cross section on a free neutron .",
    "a consistent part of this energy dependence , however , can not be explained in these terms and we may say that a strong energy - dependent shadowing is present .",
    "we have presented an analysis comparing low energy @xmath0 annihilation data with other available data on antinucleon - nucleon and antinucleon - nucleus annihilation .",
    "the different sets are all consistent with a gap / peak structure in the isospin-1 channel , over a regular `` background '' which can be reproduced by energy - independent optical potentials of simple form .",
    "this structure is not too pronounced but evident , and we have also shown that it affects the nuclear annihilation rates , whose behavior can be @xmath97 explained in terms of the behavior of the antiproton - neutron annihilation rate .",
    "we have also discussed the shadowing phenomena related with antinucleon - nucleus annihilation , and reported an interpretation in terms of the quantum uncertainty principle .",
    "the comparison of impulse approximation predictions with the nuclear data suggests that a strong energy - dependent shadowing is present at low energies : also after including absorption corrections , the data can not be fully explained in terms of individual antinucleon - nucleon annihilations .",
