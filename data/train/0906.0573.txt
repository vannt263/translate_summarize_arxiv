    "large n - body cosmological simulations have been carried out for a decade , with the goal of making statistical predictions on dark matter ( dm ) halo properties .",
    "because of numerical issues , most of these large cosmological simulations contain dark matter particles only .",
    "they all reliably predict that the 3d density profile @xmath11 should fall as @xmath12 at large radii ( but within the virial radius ) .",
    "observations have confirmed these predictions for cluster sized haloes ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this agreement is likely to be connected with the fact that at large radius , the density profile of a galaxy cluster is dark matter dominated and the influence of baryons can be neglected . on smaller scales , parameterizing the 3d density profile of the dm using a cuspy profile @xmath13 ; dark matter only simulations predict a logarithmic slope @xmath14 1 - 1.5 for @xmath15 0 .",
    "the exact value of the central slope and its universality is debated @xcite .",
    "theoretical efforts indicate that the inner logarithmic slope of dm halos should be @xmath14 0.8 @xcite .",
    "although clearly of interest , these dark matter only studies and their predictions do not help much to make comparison with observations .",
    "indeed , observing the central part ( i.e. the inner @xmath16 500kpc ) of a galaxy cluster at any wavelength reveals the presence of baryons ( in the forms of stars and x - ray emitting hot gas ) .",
    "thus any attempt to compare observations to simulations in the center of galaxy clusters has to be made with numerical simulations ( or calculations ) taking into account the baryonic component and its associated physics .    on the numerical side",
    ", efforts are currently being made to include effects of baryons in a realistic way in the simulations ( see below ) .",
    "problems remain , however : for example , due to the so - called `` over - cooling problem '' , numerical simulations tend to predict central brightest cluster galaxies which are too blue and too massive relative to observations .",
    "different effects do compete when it comes to the central slope of the density profile : the cooling of gas in the central regions of galaxies and clusters is expected to lead to a more concentrated dark matter distribution ( the so - called adiabatic contraction , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . on the other hand , dynamical friction heating of massive galaxies against the diffuse cluster dark matter could in principle flatten the slope of the dm density profile @xcite .",
    "also , the properties of the inner part of simulated galaxy clusters ( even in dark matter only simulations ) can depend significantly on initial conditions as demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "consequently , no coherent picture has yet emerged from n - body simulations when it comes to the shape of the inner density profile of structures .    on the observational side ,",
    "efforts have been put on probing the central slope @xmath6 of the underlying dark matter distribution .",
    "these analyzes have led to wide - ranging results , whatever the method used : x - ray @xcite ; lensing @xcite or dynamics @xcite .",
    "this highlight the difficulty of such studies and the possible large scatter in the value of @xmath6 from one cluster to another .    in summary , one needs to probe observationally and numerically the behavior of the _ underlying _ dark matter distribution ( i.e. after the baryonic component has been separated from the dark matter component ) in the central parts of galaxy clusters . the main difficulties are : i ) observationally , to be able to disentangle the baryonic component and the underlying dark matter distribution ; ii ) numerically , to implement the baryonic physics into the simulations ; iii ) then to compare both approaches in a consistent way .",
    "@xcite carried out lensing analyzes aiming to probe the central mass distribution in six galaxy clusters , using the measured velocity dispersion profile of the cd galaxy as an extra constrain .",
    "they found central density slopes smaller than 1 .",
    "recently , there have been a growing interest on abell  1703 , a massive @xmath17 @xcite x - ray cluster with a luminosity l@xmath18 = 8.7@xmath19 ergs@xmath20 @xcite .",
    "it contains a large number of gravitational arcs , enabling a very detailed lensing analysis .",
    "moreover , although it displays an intriguing filamentary structure along the north - south direction , it looks rather circular from the geometrical configuration of its multiply imaged systems , in particular its giant arc , located at large angular separation ( @xmath21kpc ) .",
    "it is a uni - modal cluster , likely to be relaxed and characterized by a central dominant elliptical cd galaxy .",
    "this makes it much easier to interpret the results of the modeling compared to bimodal clusters such as abell  1689 @xcite , abell  2218 @xcite , abell  68 @xcite or ms2053.7 - 0449 ( verdugo et  al . , 2007 ) .",
    "in fact , regular relaxed clusters are rare at such redshifts @xcite .",
    "finally , it displays a remarkable lensing configuration , forming a central `` ring '' composed of four bright images that represent a rare example of lensing by a hyperbolic umbilic catastrophe @xcite .",
    "this ring is located close to the central cd galaxy ( 4 - 9 @xmath22 , corresponding to 17 - 38kpc ) , providing a robust constraint in the very central part of the cluster .",
    "this motivated several lensing works on abell  1703 aimed to probe the dark matter density slope of the central region ( @xmath23kpc ) , modeling the dark matter distribution of abell  1703 by a generalized nfw profile , viz .",
    "@xmath24 where @xmath25 is the scale radius .",
    "these works @xcite determined the inner slope @xmath26 to be consistent with the universal profile ( @xmath27 ) . the more recent strong lensing analysis by @xcite , based on the identification of 16 multiply imaged systems ,",
    "of which 10 are spectroscopically confirmed , found @xmath26=0.92@xmath280.04 ( 1@xmath29 confidence level ) .",
    "note that the scale radius derived by @xcite is found in agreement with that found by @xcite when combining strong and weak lensing .",
    "since the scale radius needs weak lensing data to be properly constrained , this is important given the degeneracies arising between the scale radius and the inner slope .    assuming that pure dark matter haloes are well described by the standard nfw profile with @xmath26=1 , the indication of the above results on abell  1703 is that the baryonic pinching of the dark matter halo , probably mainly caused by the central dominant cd galaxy , does not substantially affect the dark matter density slope in the central region of the cluster .    on the theoretical / numerical front",
    "it has only recently been possible to carry out fully cosmological gas - dynamical / n - body simulations of the formation and evolution of galaxy clusters at a sufficient level of numerical resolution and physical sophistication that the cool - out of gas , star - formation , chemical evolution and gas inflows and outflows related to individual cluster galaxies can be modeled to a reasonable degree of realism ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "et al .  was included with a diffusion coefficient @xmath35 derived from models of the expansion of individual supernova remnants .",
    "a much more important effect in the present simulations , however , is the redistribution of metals ( and gas ) by means of star - burst driven `` galactic super  winds '' ( see point 5 ) .",

    "( 5 ) star - burst driven , galactic super - winds are incorporated in the simulations .",
    "this is required to expel metals from the galaxies and get the abundance of the icm to the observed level of about 1/3 solar in iron .",
    "a burst of star formation is modeled in the same way as the `` early bursts '' of @xcite , i.e.  by halting cooling in the surrounding gas particles , to mimic the initial heating and subsequent adiabatic expansion phase of the super - shell powered by the star - burst ; this scheme ensures effective energy coupling and feedback between the bursting star particle and the surrounding gas .",
    "the strength of the super - winds is modeled through a free parameter @xmath36 which determines how large a fraction of the new  born stars partake in such bursting , super - wind driving star formation .",
    "we find that in order to get an iron abundance in the icm comparable to observations , @xmath37 and at the same time a fairly top - heavy initial mass function ( imf ) has to be used .",

    "as discussed in @xcite , this results in the cds becoming too blue over time , with central b - r colours of @xmath161.0 at @xmath30=0 , rather than 1.4 - 1.5 observed for real cds ( note though that some star - formation is observed in many cds at the base of the cooling flow  e.g. , mcnamara 2004 ) . given the significant gas cool - out rates , the increase in the stellar masses of the cds since @xmath602 is considerable : for the virgo cd @xmath61=0.42 , 1.0 and 1.4 in units of @xmath62 , at @xmath30=2,1,0 , respectively ( inside of 20 kpc ) . for coma , the corresponding masses are 0.95 , 1.9 and 4.2 . in real cds , the late time cooling flows will be counteracted , most likely by the energy release related to the accretion of mass onto super - massive black holes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this will lead to a strong suppression of the late time star formation rate , such that the simulated cds become too massive . as will be shown in the next section , the gravitational force of this excess mass influences the central dark matter profile , and must be corrected for .",
    "assuming that the excess mass has been added adiabatically , i.e. on a timescale large compared to the stellar orbital timescale in the cd , the `` correct '' dark matter distribution can be recovered by slowly removing the excess stellar mass .",

    "all the cds display a negative colour gradient , qualitatively consistent with what is observed for large early type galaxies .",
    "as the mean stellar age is approximately constant with projected radius @xmath92 , the reason for the gradient in colour is the metallicity gradient seen in fig .",

    "we hence find that the rz1 and rz2 cds have very similar u - v colours , and that these are slightly bluer than the observed average .",
    "this is , at least partly , due to the large , somewhat bluer stellar envelope surrounding the cds , cf .",

    ", the rz2 cd core densities appear the most reasonable , although no strong conclusions can be made on the basis of the available data .",
    "based on the results given in the previous subsection , it is clear that the cds formed in the rz2 re - simulations give a much better match to reality than the ones formed in the rz1 simulations , and in fact , in general , meet all observational constraints . we shall hence in the following focus on the rz2 re - simulations , and the comparison of these to the dark matter only simulations .",
    "the coma dark matter only simulation has @xmath54=2.8 @xmath41kpc , and the gravity force of the central dark matter particles is hence purely newtonian ( i.e. un - softened ) at @xmath1028 kpc . at @xmath30=0.28 , @xmath103 for the coma cluster is 1820 kpc , which means that the simulation result is affected by resolution effects inside of @xmath1040.004 .",
    "the coma simulation with baryons has @xmath54=5.4 @xmath41kpc , so although the star and gas particle softening lengths are considerably smaller , the resulting dark matter profile may be affected by gravity softening inside of @xmath1040.008 .",

    "again , the rz2 re - simulation only leads to a very moderate steepening , @xmath50.1 , relative to the dark matter only simulation .",
    "so for realistic cds , the steepening of the dark matter profile in galaxy clusters is very moderate , @xmath50.1 .",
    "this is the most important result presented in this work .      as gravitational lensing probes",
    "the total matter ( surface ) density , in order to deduce dark matter profiles observationally , one has to do a dark matter vs. baryonic matter decomposition .",
    "this obviously adds some uncertainty ( statistical as well as possibly systematic ) to the estimate of the dark matter density profile . to bypass this",
    ", it is clearly also of interest to calculate total matter density profiles from the simulations .",
    "these can then more directly be compared to observational finding , based on lensing . in fig .",
    "[ fig : dlnrhodlnr_all ] is shown the result for the rz2 simulations .",

    "it is hence important to show , that neglecting the hot gas ( icm ) component , for which the mass distribution is much more uncertain , does not significantly bias the estimate of the dm distribution . in fig .",
    "[ fig : dlnrhodlnr_dm+gas ] is shown , for the rz2 simulations , @xmath69 for the dark matter alone , as well as for dark matter and hot icm gas combined .",

    "[ fig : res ] is shown @xmath69 for the sets of virgo simulations as well as virgolr simulations .",
    "statistical uncertainties on the virgolr results are @xmath50.05 , and on the virgo results about a factor @xmath107 less .",
    "note that the virgolr results are affected by gravity softening at about @xmath1040.014 .",
    "outside of this region , there is reasonably good agreement between the two sets of simulations , indicating that the results presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : dlnrhodlnr ] are not seriously affected by numerical resolution limitations outside of @xmath1040.007 - 0.008 .",

    "although we in this paper are analyzing simulations of just two clusters , and although other observational values of @xmath70 have previously been reported in the literature , it is obviously interesting that we for the two clusters simulated , including the effects of the central cd on the dark matter halo , find @xmath1091.0 - 1.2 .",
    "given that lcdm haloes undoubtedly have a range of inner slopes , and given that we are probing only two haloes , an even more interesting result is that for both clusters , the steepening of the inner slopes is both moderate and consistent , @xmath50.1 . for milky way sized galaxies , as well as smaller galaxies , @xcite found much larger effects of baryonic pinching of the dark matter haloes , @xmath50.6 . to understand the reason for this difference",
    ", we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : mcumall ] , for the rz2 re - simulations at @xmath30=0.28 , the cumulative masses of dark matter , stars and stars+gas . as can be seen ,",
    "the cumulative masses of baryons and dark matter are equal at @xmath1107 and 9 kpc , for virgo and coma respectively . in both cases",
    "this is well inside of the effective radius , i.e. the characteristic scale of the galaxy .",
    "in contrast , @xcite found @xmath11110 kpc for the individual ( field ) galaxies considered .",
    "these galaxies have characteristic scales of @xmath162 - 4 kpc , so the chief difference is that the cd galaxies considered in this paper are much less baryon dominated than normal ( substantially smaller ) field galaxies .",
    "in addition , one should note that the present simulations can only probe the increase in dark matter inner profile steepening outside of @xmath168 and 16 kpc , for virgo and coma respectively ( whereas the innermost , baryon dominated regions are about twice as well resolved due to the shorter gravitational softening lengths of the star and gas particles ) .",
    "it is also worth noting that @xcite found a consideably larger steepning of galaxy cluster inner dm profiles due to baryonic pinching , on the basis of their simulations invoking baryonic physics .",
    "this , however ( as acknowledged by these authors ) , is due to the spurious effects of `` over - cooling '' , discussed and corrected for in the present work .",
    "an underlying assumption in the rz1 and rz2 re - simulations is that the rate of change of cd gravitational potential , caused by stars either being formed _ in situ _ or being added through accretion since @xmath86=1 or 2 , is slow ( adiabatic ) , compared to the dynamical rate .",
    "although this is true for the stars forming _ in situ _ at the base of the cooling flows , in the coma simulation @xmath161:3 and 1:4 mergers take place at @xmath1121.4 and @xmath1120.7 , respectively , and in the virgo simulation @xmath161:4 mergers take place , at @xmath1121.5 and 1.0 , respectively . in such mergers ,",
    "the adiabatic approximation is not fulfilled , and more realistic simulations , including effects of super - massive black hole growth and agn feedback , would have to be undertaken to check whether the results we find from the adiabatic stellar mass removal re - simulations are in fact fully correct .",
    "however , the fact that the rz2 cds appear to be realistic in terms of stellar mass , linear extent , metallicity , etc . can be considered very strong evidence that the inner dark matter profile steepening found for the rz2 simulations are entirely reasonable .",
    "it is obvious that the primary drivers of the baryonic pinching are a ) cd stellar mass , and , to a lesser extent , b ) the cd linear extent .",
    "= 0.28 , are shown cumulative mass of dark matter ( solid curves ; coma : thick , virgo : thin ) , stars ( dotted curves ; coma : blue , virgo : red ) and stars+gas ( dashed curves ; coma : blue , virgo : red).,width=317 ]",
    "we have in this paper presented results of cosmological ( @xmath0cdm ) treesph simulations of the formation and evolution of two galaxy clusters . in order to quantify the effect of baryonic `` pinching '' of galaxy cluster dark matter haloes ,",
    "we have simulated _ the same _ clusters with and without baryons included .",
    "the hydrodynamical simulations include a number of important physical processes , such as star formation , chemical evolution with non - instantaneous recycling , metallicity dependent radiative cooling , strong star - burst , driven galactic super - winds and the effects of a meta - galactic uv field , including simplified radiative transfer .",
    "the two clusters have @xmath1@xmath1133 and 6 kev , respectively , and both host at @xmath3 a prominent , central cd galaxy .    comparing the simulations without and with baryons",
    ", it is found that for the latter , the inner dm density profiles , @xmath4 50 - 100 kpc , steepen considerably : @xmath50.5 - 0.6 , where -@xmath6 is the logarithmic dm density gradient .",
    "this is primarily due to the central stellar cds becoming very massive , as a consequence of the onset of late time cooling flows and related star formation .",
    "once these spurious cooling flows have been corrected for , and the cluster gravitational potentials dynamically adjusted , much smaller pinching effects are found : @xmath50.1 .    the main result of the paper is hence that our work strongly supports the notion that the steepening of the inner dark matter density profile , due to baryonic pinching , is very moderate .",
    "this finding is at stark variance with findings for individual field galaxies .",
    "the main reason for this is that galaxy clusters , even in the presence of central dominant cd galaxies , are dark matter dominated outside of @xmath167 - 8 kpc . as the effective radii of the two cds considered",
    "are 11 and 16 kpc , this result indicates that cd galaxies are dark matter dominated at the effective radius .    including the effects of baryonic pinching , central slopes of @xmath1141.0 and 1.2 are found for the dm in the two clusters , interestingly close to recent observational findings for abell  1703 based on gravitational lensing studies .    for the simulations with baryons , the inner density profile of dm+icm combined",
    "is found to be only very marginally steeper than that of the dm .",
    "the total matter inner density profiles , however , are found to be @xmath10 steeper than the inner profiles in the dark matter only simulations .",
    "the total matter density profiles are not well described by generalized nfw models .    given that we have presented results for just two simulated clusters in this paper , it is clearly of importance to increase the sample size .",
