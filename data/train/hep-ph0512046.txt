    "even though the standard model ( sm ) has proved to offer a very successful description of strong and electroweak interactions , it fails in providing an explanation to issues such as the gauge group , the number of families , the dynamics of flavour and the mechanism of mass generation , among others .",
    "a particularly puzzling topic is that of the number of quark and lepton generations . from a phenomenological and experimental point of view",
    ", we have strong reasons to accept that there are indeed only three copies of up- and down - type quarks , as well of charged leptons and active neutrinos .",
    "however , on the theoretical side , there is little hint to the origin of this three - fold replication .",
    "the cancellation of anomalies requires identical number of quark and lepton families , but adds no information to the total number .",
    "extensions of the sm , such as supersymmetry ( susy ) , or grand unified theories ( gut ) , remedy several deficiencies of the sm , but they also fail in explaining the number of fermion families .    given the existence of three families of quarks and leptons , and since neither theory nor experiment impose any constraints on the number of higgs families , one could wonder whether the same family replication takes place in the higgs sector .",
    "in addition to being very aesthetic , this scenario is not unexpected from a theoretical point of view . in some susy models from strings , as is the case of the compactification of the 10 dimensional @xmath0 heterotic superstring to 4 dimensions , the low - energy theory thus obtained is associated with a subgroup of the gauge group @xmath1 . under @xmath1 , fermions and higgses are assigned to the same representation , and the requirement of three families of fermions imposes replication of the higgs content @xcite .",
    "in fact , many string constructions that contain three fermion families also include higgs family replication , as is the case of @xmath2 orbifold compactifications of the heterotic superstring , which also exhibit a low - energy spectrum composed of three supersymmetric higgs families  @xcite , and that of some d - brane models @xcite .",
    "other models that include a non - minimal higgs content have also been extensively addressed in the literature  @xcite .",
    "the consequences of extending the higgs sector are abundant , and have implications which range from the theoretical to the experimental level .",
    "for instance , and if the extra higgses are light , the addition of these states in a minimal susy scenario will spoil the unification of gauge couplings around 10@xmath3 gev .",
    "nevertheless , in models from the heterotic string , the high energy scale is different ( @xmath4 gev ) , and the new states can even be helpful regarding unification  @xcite . since ours is a low - energy oriented analysis , we will not consider the ( more speculative ) high - energy implications of the extended higgs sector .",
    "the most challenging implication of an extended higgs sector is perhaps the potential occurrence of tree - level flavour changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) , mediated by the exchange of neutral higgs states . in the sm and the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , these effects are absent at the tree - level , since the coupling of the quark - quark - higgs mass eigenstates is flavour conserving .",
    "this arises from having the yukawa couplings proportional to the quark mass matrices , so that diagonalising the mass matrices also diagonalises the yukawas . since experimental data",
    "is in good agreement with the sm predictions , the potentially large contributions arising from the tree - level interactions must be suppressed in order to have a model which is experimentally viable . in general , the most stringent limit on the flavour - changing processes emerges from the small value of the @xmath5 mass difference  @xcite .    avoiding the fcncs induced by the tree - level exchange of neutral higgs bosons can be achieved by several distinct approaches , each involving a different sector of the model .",
    "\\(i ) discrete symmetries . imposing a discrete symmetry on the model",
    "ensures that only one generation of higgs couples to quark and leptons , and completely eliminates tree level fcncs from the predictions of the model  @xcite . naturally , one attempts to motivate such an assumption via topological and/or geometrical arguments .",
    "for instance , in  @xcite , adding four extra higgs doublets to the mssm content , and assuming that the fcncs thus induced are suppressed via some symmetry , then the extra generations ( labelled `` pseudo - higgs bosons '' ) do not acquire vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) , do not mix with the two mssm - like doublets , nor couple to fermions .",
    "still , the lightest of the new states is stable so that it becomes a candidate for dark matter .",
    "\\(ii ) suppression of yukawa couplings . in this case , fcncs are not eliminated , but the yukawa interaction responsible for the tree - level flavour violation is made small enough to render the new contributions negligible . since the most stringent bounds are usually associated with tree level contributions to the neutral kaon mass difference ( @xmath6 ) , the yukawa couplings of down and strange quarks are forced to be very small .",
    "for example , in @xcite , a @xmath7 flavour symmetry was considered as the candidate symmetry to suppress fcncs .",
    "although this second possibility is more appealing in the sense that it does not require excluding part of the higgs content from higgs - matter interactions , its major shortcoming lies in the fact that in general one lacks a full theory of flavour , which would predict the yukawa couplings , as would be the case of string theory .",
    "\\(iii ) decoupling of extra higgses . if one does not wish ( or is not allowed ) to impose a symmetry , or",
    "if the yukawa couplings are not free parameters of the model , a third possibility lies in making the new higgs states heavy enough , so that the contributions they mediate are suppressed  @xcite .",
    "the new states are thus decoupled , and the effective low - energy theory is very similar to the usual mssm / sm .",
    "this possibility is sometimes the only `` degree of freedom '' remaining , especially in highly predictive models , where the yukawas arise from some high - energy formulation , as is the case of string models .",
    "nevertheless , it is important to stress that the decoupling scenario is in general achieved by enforcing very large values for some of the higgs soft - breaking masses .",
    "this may lead to a fine - tuning scenario in association with electroweak ( ew ) symmetry breaking .",
    "when the decoupling approach is taken together with the suppression of yukawa couplings ( ii ) , it is possible to obtain higgs spectra which manage to comply with experiment without excessively heavy higgses  @xcite .    from the above discussion",
    ", it is clear that a correct evaluation of the fcnc problem associated to multi - higgs doublet models is indeed instrumental . in what follows",
    ", we propose to analyse the most general scenario of the mssm extended to include three families of higgs doublets .",
    "we do not impose any symmetry on the model , allowing for the most general formulation of both the superpotential and the susy soft breaking lagrangian .",
    "we provide a generic overview of the extended higgs sector , and discuss the minimisation of the scalar potential . in this work , we also compute the most general expression for the contribution of tree - level neutral higgs exchange to neutral meson mass difference .",
    "contrary to previous analyses  @xcite , we include the contributions from all physical ( rather than interaction ) higgs states , scalar and pseudoscalar .",
    "moreover , we take into account the mixing in the higgs sector . finally , as an example of how to apply our general formulation , we consider an ansatz for the yukawa couplings along the lines of previous analyses ( namely the `` simple fritzsch scheme ''  @xcite ) , and evaluate the specific contributions to the neutral mesons mass differences .",
    "our findings turn out to be more severe than those of previous works .",
    "the work is organised as follows . in section  [ higgsphenom ] ,",
    "we analyse the extended higgs sector , paying special attention to the minimisation of the higgs potential and addressing potential fine - tuning issues .",
    "we compute the tree level mass matrices in section  [ higgsspectrum ] and discuss the associated spectra .",
    "section  [ yukint ] is devoted to the analysis of higgs - matter interactions , and in section  [ fcnc ] we derive a model independent computation of the tree - level contributions to the neutral meson mass differences .",
    "assuming an illustrative example for the yukawa couplings , we present in section  [ flavour : res ] a numerical study of the fcnc contributions , investigating how the higgs spectrum must be constrained in order to have compatibility with experimental data .",
    "finally we summarise the most relevant points in section  [ conc ] .",
    "we begin our analysis by addressing the higgs sector of a susy model where three generations of @xmath8 doublet superfields are comprised . in each generation , one finds hypercharge @xmath9 and @xmath10 fields , coupling to down- and up - quarks , respectively : @xmath11      the most general superpotential of a model with three families of higgs doublets can be written as follows : @xmath12 above , @xmath13 and @xmath14 denote the quark and lepton @xmath15 doublet superfields , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are quark singlets , @xmath18 the lepton singlet , and @xmath19 are the yukawa matrices associated with each higgs superfield . regarding the @xmath20-terms ,",
    "these are now extended in order to include all possible bilinear higgs terms .",
    "calling upon some specific model that would be responsible for generating the latter terms , it would be possible to reduce the number of free parameters .",
    "it is also important to recall that one could also impose a ( discrete ) symmetry acting on the superpotential , whose effect would be the suppression of some of the couplings in @xmath21 .",
    "however , in our discussion , we consider the most generic form for @xmath21 , thus taking the several bilinear parameters in @xmath21 as effective @xmath20-terms .    from the above one can derive the @xmath22- and @xmath23-terms , writing the latter in doublet component for simplicity : @xmath24 ^ 2 + \\",

    "although the problem appears to be a simple generalisation of the two - higgs doublet model ( mssm ) , it will prove to be much more involved .",
    "it happens that in the presence of six non - vanishing vevs , finding a solution to the minima equations is a rather cumbersome task . as an illustration , we present the equations obtained from minimising with respect to the down - type higgs : @xmath33   w_i   -\\sum_{l=2,4,6 } ( b\\mu)_{jl } \\,w_l + w_j\\ , \\frac{1}{2}\\ , m_z^2\\ , \\frac{v_d^2-v_u^2}{v_d^2+v_u^2 } = 0\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 and we have defined @xmath35 in addition to eq .",
    "( [ min : downs ] ) , which only ensure that we are in the presence of an extremum , we have to further impose the conditions for a minimum with respect to the several variables .",
    "therefore , and for the down - type higgs fields , having positive second derivatives is equivalent to the following inequalities : @xmath36 provided that at the minimum the determinant of the six - dimensional matrix is positive , or equivalently , @xmath37 .    the equations for the remaining cases ( minimising with respect to the up - type higgs fields ) can be obtained from eqs .",

    "( [ min : downs ] ) ) and @xmath41 ( cf .",
    "( [ min : downs:2 ] ) ) . the only choice of parameters that would render the solution of the minima equations straightforward is to call upon the diagonal soft breaking masses ( @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) to be fixed by the minima equations .",
    "for @xmath44 the minimum equation would read @xmath45 naturally , the equations can be solved for a distinct set of parameters , but then finding an analytical solution is in general not possible .",
    "analytical relations are very useful when writing down the mass matrices for the several higgs sectors , since one can directly replace the parameters .",
    "in fact , the major handicap when relying on the diagonal soft masses as the minimum parameters is that then one loses control of the leading contributions to the higgs boson mass eigenvalues .",
    "this will be made clear in a forthcoming section .",
    "another shortcoming is that , even though we can define a generalised expression for @xmath46 as @xmath47 , writing the minimisation equations as a function of @xmath48 , @xmath49 ( in an mssm - like fashion ) , is impossible .",
    "so far we have been working in the basis that naturally emerges from both the superpotential and soft - breaking lagrangian formulation . to simplify the discussion , we will henceforth label this natural basis as the superpotential basis .",
    "however , this need not be the unique approach when addressing the minimisation of the potential .",
    "as it has been shown , one can work in a basis where only two of the new six neutral fields have non - vanishing vevs , the so - called higgs basis  @xcite .",
    "for the down - type higgses , the new fields , @xmath50 , are related to the original ones by means of the following unitary transformation , @xmath51 : @xmath52\\ , , \\\\ & \\phi^0_5 \\equiv \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{w_3 ^",

    "let us introduce the following global parametrisation for the transformations @xmath51 and @xmath53 : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is a @xmath58 matrix whose entries are defined from @xmath51 and @xmath53 as @xmath59 from the above , it is clear that in the new basis only two of the fields do have a vev @xmath60 with @xmath61 defined in eq .",

    "in this basis one has the additional advantage that , similar to what occurs in the mssm case , one can clearly define @xmath46 : @xmath65 we can now write @xmath66 thus , one can now understand the three higgs family model as an mssm - like model , extended by 4 additional doublets , which do not directly interfere with the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking . in the higgs basis , the potential preserves its original structure with respect to the dependence on the field combination , but the parameters associated with the @xmath22- and soft breaking terms are now redefined as @xmath67\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath68 in the new basis , the problem of minimising the scalar potential is quite simplified , and one is able to derive the six minimisation conditions in a compact form .",
    "the conditions for the down - type sector read @xmath69 while those related to the up - type higgses are given by @xmath70 in the above , and for simplicity , we have introduced the short - hand notation @xmath71 where we stress that both parameters @xmath72 , and @xmath73 , as well as @xmath74 have dimensions ( mass@xmath75 ) . throughout the paper we will be often using the above short - hand notation , even though this implies that the rotated @xmath20-terms and higgs soft breaking masses loose their individual character , becoming merged into the quantities @xmath76 . as a final comment ,",
    "let us notice that the minima equations ( [ minima : d],[minima : u ] ) are , in structure , very similar to those of the mssm , namely the first in each set of three .",
    "it is worth referring that the ew scale is only explicitly present in two equations ( those derived with respect to @xmath77 , the vev - acquiring fields ) .",
    "notice however , that this is a mere consequence of working in a different basis .",
    "in addition to the minima conditions eqs .",
    "( [ minima : d],[minima : u ] ) , one can also derive other conditions , which are useful in constraining the allowed parameter space .",
    "as an example , and from direct comparison of the minima equations for @xmath78 and @xmath79 , we find the following inequality : @xmath80 strongly resembling the analogous mssm condition .",
    "in what follows , our goal is to conduct a short analysis of the issues discussed in the previous subsections .",
    "the phenomenological analysis of the higgs sector ( masses and mixings ) will be carried in detail in section  [ higgsspectrum ] , working in the higgs basis .",
    "nevertheless , we find it interesting to evaluate how the minimisation of the scalar potential constrains the soft breaking terms . to do so",
    ", we consider several numerical examples for the minimisation of the scalar potential for distinct vev regimes .",
    "in addition , we also discuss whether or not a specific choice of soft breaking terms may translate into a fine - tuning problem .",
    "although the minima conditions are cast in a much more compact and appealing way in the higgs basis , since only two of them explicitly involve the ew scale , a possible fine tuning problem may be unapparent in this case .",
    "therefore , for this specific discussion , we will stick to the original superpotential basis . in this case , and since we make no assumptions regarding the mechanism of susy breaking associated with this generic multi - higgs doublet model , we take the input parameters @xmath81 to be free at the electroweak scale . regarding the higgs vevs ( @xmath82 ) , we impose no constraint other than satisfying the ew breaking conditions for a given value of @xmath46 . in order to further simplify the approach",
    ", we will fix , in each separate analysis , the value of @xmath83 , and assume a common overall scale for the off - diagonal masses @xmath84 and @xmath85 , and for @xmath86 . more specifically ,",
    "we take universal @xmath29 terms , @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is a `` typical soft - susy breaking scale '' . for the off - diagonal masses",
    "@xmath84 and @xmath85 , the common scale is taken to be @xmath89 , values of @xmath90 are not compatible with viable solutions .",
    "this is evident from the minimisation conditions of eq .",
    "( [ md11:min ] ) , using @xmath91 .",
    "furthermore , the limit @xmath92 occurs in well motivated models  @xcite . ] .    as discussed in the previous subsection ,",
    "the parameters which are ( trivially ) fixed by the six minima equations are the diagonal higgs soft - breaking masses , @xmath93 and @xmath94 . clearly , from eq .",
    "( [ md11:min ] ) , the minima values for @xmath95 , and in particular those of the down - type higgs sector , will be very dependent of the values of the vevs considered , most specifically on whether one chooses a degenerate or hierarchical regime .",
    "therefore , each case has to be separately investigated , and in each situation , one must analyse the impact of the other free parameters , namely that of the overall scale chosen for the soft - breaking parameters .    in addition , one has to investigate whether or not the parameters taken lead to a potential fine tuning ( ft ) problem for the parameters . in doing so",
    ", our approach will be the following .",
    "for a specific scenario defined by the parameters in eq .",
    "( [ min : free : para ] ) , together with @xmath82 and @xmath46 , we compute the values of the diagonal soft breaking masses , as imposed from complying with the minima equations .",
    "we then impose a tiny perturbation on the solutions , @xmath96 where @xmath97 is taken to be around a few percent . finally , we compute the new value of @xmath63 derived from perturbing the correct ( true minima ) solution for @xmath95 , @xmath98 . to evaluate the amount of ft , we follow  @xcite , and introduce the parameter @xmath99 , defined as @xmath100 identifying @xmath101 with @xmath95 .",
    "a rough measure of the fine - tuning can be derived from @xmath102 , since the latter can be identified with the probability of a cancellation between terms of a given size to obtain a final result @xmath103 times smaller .    in what follows",
    "we take , as illustrative examples , two distinct cases for the higgs vevs : degenerate and hierarchical @xmath82 .",
    "we stress here that at this point we are only investigating the constraints on the soft breaking terms arising from the minima conditions . a study of the spectrum is far simplified when moving to higgs basis , as will be done in the following section .",
    "+ @xmath104 degenerate vevs : @xmath105 , @xmath106    in this case , the minima equations become much simpler , since in each sector the vevs factor out .",
    "therefore , having fixed the free parameters as above described , the six original equations essentially reduce to two independent ones : one for the down - type higgs ( e.g. @xmath44 ) and another for the up - type sector ( e.g. @xmath107 ) .    in fig .",

    "cc    from fig .",
    "[ fig : mh2out.msusy.k1 ] , several properties of this model become apparent .",
    "first of all , it becomes clear that in this basis ( the superpotential basis ) finding minima can be a challenging task .",
    "notice that although one can find solutions for the down - type sector associated with low @xmath88 , in this range we are in the presence of maxima ( rather than minima ) for the up - type soft masses .",
    "the situation slightly worsens with increasing @xmath46 .",
    "taking other ( higher ) values of @xmath20 would lead to the displacement of the vertical line further to the right of the parameter space parametrised by @xmath88 .",
    "this behaviour can be confirmed by inspection of eqs .",

    "let us now evaluate how fine - tuned these solutions are . in fig .",
    "[ fig : dpout.msusy.k1 ] we investigate @xmath99 for the up and down sectors , by studying in each case the effect of perturbing the minima solutions @xmath111 and @xmath112 by @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "we again consider @xmath115 gev , and take @xmath116 .    from eqs .",

    "the situation is reversed .",

    "first of all , it is widely recognised that , in models with tree - level fcnc , the most stringent bounds are usually associated with @xmath6 . regarding the @xmath148 sector , it has also been argued that in the absence of a predictive theory for the yukawa couplings , the bounds associated with @xmath163 should be considered as a more reliable constraint , since they do not involve the mixing between the first two generations  @xcite . although we include it in our analysis , the @xmath149 mass difference is not expected to add any new information . in the sm ,",
    "this mixing is already maximal , and the addition of a new contribution would have little effect , the only exception occurring if new contributions matched exactly those of the sm , but had opposite sign , in which case a cancellation could take place .",
    "still , this is a very fine - tuned scenario , and hardly significant , given the uncertainties associated with the computation .",
    "finally , we turn our attention to the @xmath150 mass difference . as pointed out in  @xcite and  @xcite , models allowing for fcnc at the tree - level may present the possibility of very large contributions to @xmath164 , thus emerging as an excellent probe of new physics effects .",
    "the latter contributions are often harder to control than those associated with , for example , @xmath165 . in fact , and as discussed in  @xcite , the contribution of tree - level fcncs to @xmath164 could even exceed by a factor 20 those to @xmath6 . on the other hand , mixing in the @xmath150 sector",
    "is very sensitive to the hadronic model used to estimate the transition amplitudes , and there is still a very large uncertainty in deriving its decay constants , etc .",
    "therefore , the constraints on a given model arising from @xmath164 should not be over - emphasised .",
    "another interesting issue is that of rare decays .",
    "it has been argued that , again when no theory for the full yukawas is available , some rare decays become very sensitive to flavour changing contributions induced by higgs exchange at the tree - level . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors have identified that the most promising decay modes involve the leptonic sector , together with the @xmath151-mesons , and are @xmath166 , @xmath167 and @xmath168 .",
    "we will not pursue this issue in the present work , reserving some of the above modes ( namely @xmath166 ) for a forthcoming analysis  @xcite .",
    "we have carried out in the previous section a general analysis of fcnc contributions .",
    "this can be applied to any particular model with three higgs families , provided that the yukawa couplings are known .",
    "lead by simplicity , and following the analysis of  @xcite , we take as an illustrative example the so - called `` simple fritzsch scheme ''  @xcite . taking this ansatz for each of the yukawa couplings",
    "presents two main advantages : it leads to mass matrices with a fairly hierarchical structure , and allows to fit experimental data on quark masses and mixings for a reasonable number of free parameters .",
    "the `` simple fritzsch scheme '' essentially consists in having all the weak quark eigenstates adopt identically structured couplings , which display suppressed flavour - changing elements for the first two generations in each family .",
    "more explicitly one has @xmath169 where @xmath170 , and the entries are given by @xmath171 with @xmath172 , @xmath173 and @xmath174 coefficients of order one , and @xmath175 the quark masses of the @xmath176 generation and @xmath177 for @xmath178 .",
    "one further advantage of this choice , which will become more evident in the subsequent discussion , is that under the above ansatz , the quark masses and mixings are independent of the chosen vev regime ( although the yukawas are not ) .",
    "this means that for a given successful choice of the parameters @xmath172 , @xmath173 and @xmath174 , one can study a number of distinct vev schemes , corresponding to different @xmath46 scenarios .",
    "let us now present a specific numerical example . taking the values for the input quark masses , @xmath179 entering in the ansatz of eq .",
    "( [ fritzsch : abc ] ) as @xmath180 mev , @xmath181 mev , @xmath182 gev , @xmath183 gev , @xmath184 gev , @xmath1854.5 gev , and using the following choice of coefficients @xmath186 one obtains the following set of output quark masses @xmath187 and the associated mixing matrix @xmath188 which is in good agreement with experimental data .",
    "having the relevant data ( yukawa couplings and ckm matrix ) , we can now proceed to estimate the contributions to neutral meson mass differences . as stressed before",
    ", we are considering a general multi - higgs model , so that we have no definite scheme for the @xmath20-terms and soft susy breaking masses . therefore , and as done in section  [ higgsphenom ] , we will assume simple textures for the higgs sector .",
    "the first step in evaluating the contributions to tree - level fcnc is to parameterise the higgs sector , and thus obtain the mixing matrices and mass eigenstates entering in eqs .",
    "( [ mk12:sigma],[mk12:phi ] ) .",
    "as discussed in section  [ higgsphenom ] , the higgs basis is far more intuitive to work in than the original superpotential basis . working in higgs - basis notation ( see eqs .",
    "( [ higgs : ptransf]-[mij : bij : def ] ) ) , let us assume that the free parameters @xmath76 and @xmath74 obey the following simple patterns : @xmath189 where the @xmath190 denotes an entry which is fixed by the minimisation conditions ( cf .",
    "( [ minima : d],[minima : u ] ) ) .",
    "the above parametrisation can be further simplified by taking @xmath191 and @xmath192 .",
    "therefore , we have the following free parameters associated with the higgs sector : @xmath193 and the pattern of vevs , namely whether they are degenerate or hierarchical . in the numerical examples we will thus consider the following textures for @xmath76 and @xmath74 .",
    "@xmath194 in each case , we will consider several values for @xmath46 , taking it to lie in the range @xmath195 .",
    "moreover , for every @xmath46 we take to very distinct schemes of vevs , that while respecting the ew symmetry breaking conditions and being in agreement with the chosen @xmath46 value , exhibit either a degenerate pattern ( @xmath105 , @xmath106 ) or a strongly hierarchical one ( @xmath196 , @xmath197 ) .    for the above range of @xmath46 , the higgs spectra ( lightest and heaviest scalar , pseudoscalar and charged states ) is within the following ranges : and the masses of the heaviest states grow monotonically with @xmath46",
    ". however , in the case of texture ( a ) , since the mixing induced by @xmath198 and the diagonal mass @xmath199 are of comparable magnitude , as @xmath46 grows , so does the mixing between the states , and thus , as pointed out in section  [ higgsspectrum ] , the states @xmath200 and @xmath201 can become lighter with increasing @xmath46 . ] @xmath202    let us begin by addressing the observable which is associated to most stringent constraints for this class of models : @xmath165 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fs.dmk ] , we plot ratio @xmath203 as a function of @xmath46 for textures ( a ) and ( b ) , considering in each case a pattern of degenerate ( deg ) or non - degenerate ( ndeg ) vevs .",
    "[ fig : fs.dmk ] clearly reflects the most problematic aspect of this class of multi - higgs doublet models . without a symmetry forbidding some of the yukawa couplings , and",
    "if the yukawas themselves do not exhibit a strong hierarchical character , the contributions to the neutral kaon mass difference can only be brought down to the experimental value via a set of very heavy higgses , as those of texture ( b ) .",
    "a higgs spectrum closer to the ew scale , with a typical mass scale of 500 gev , would generate , for the case of degenerate ( non - degenerate ) vevs , contributions to @xmath165 of around 30 ( @xmath204 ) @xmath205 .",
    "it is also manifest that smaller values of @xmath46 favour smaller contributions .",
    "this is due to having the yukawa couplings for the down quarks proportional to @xmath206 .",
    "the relevance of the vev regime should also be emphasised , since the latter plays a very important role .",
    "even though the yukawas enter in the contribution to @xmath207 already rotated by the matrices that diagonalise the quark mass matrices , it is clear that the smaller the vevs associated to the first and second quark generations , the more enhanced will be the ( 12 ) matrix elements . in the case of degenerate vevs ,",
    "all the yukawas are identically suppressed / enhanced . naturally , assuming such a large scale for the soft - breaking terms potentially leads to a fine tuning problem .",
    "as pointed out in section  [ numv ] , and even though the discussion was conducted for a distinct basis , masses above the few tev scale are in principle within range of a more than 1% fine tuning .    when compared to some previous studies , our results are more severe .",
    "however , let us stress that in our analysis we have taken a few distinct steps .",
    "firstly , and in comparison to the anstze used in  @xcite , our yukawa couplings are quite different , since accommodating the current ckm matrix data leads to values of @xmath208 and @xmath174 quite smaller than those previously considered .",
    "this implies that the present yukawas are less hierarchic .",
    "moreover , we have explicitly taken into account the values of the vevs , and considered the contributions from the exchange of all physical scalar and pseudoscalar higgses ( not weak interaction eigenstates ) , taking into account not only their masses , but also their mixings .",
    "it is also important to mention that the values of the hadronic matrix elements have been revised in the past years .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fs.dmb ] , we present the contributions to the mass difference of the @xmath148 mesons .",
    "as expected , in this case it is far easier to comply with the experimental bounds .    for the case of degenerate vevs , even the `` lightest '' texture ( a )",
    "succeeds in complying with the experimental bounds throughout the whole range of @xmath46 considered , while for the heavier higgs set ( b ) , with non - degenerate vevs .",
    "compatibility is obtained for the low @xmath46 regime ( @xmath209 ) .    to complete our study , we display in fig .  [",
    "fig : fs.dmbs ] the same analysis for the case of the @xmath149 meson system . in this case , the experimental bound is a lower ( rather than upper bound ) .    as discussed in section  [ fcnc ]",
    ", the sm already has maximal mixing in the @xmath149 system , and even though the new contributions may be of identical magnitude , there is no reason to expect a cancellation between sm and tree - level contributions , which would be associated to an extremely fine tuned scenario for all the parameters involved .    from the meson systems",
    "so far discussed , the most severe constraints arise , as expected , from the @xmath210 mass difference . as a final remark , and following the discussion of section  [ fcnc ] , we briefly comment on the predicted scenario involving the @xmath150 mesons .",
    "a study similar to those conducted for the @xmath152 and @xmath151 sectors is of less interest , since there is little dependence of @xmath211 on @xmath46 .",
    "this is due to having the up - type quarks yukawa couplings associated to @xmath212 , as seen from eq .",
    "( [ fritzsch : def ] ) .    rather than presenting a plot , we will briefly summarise the situation . with the exception of texture ( a ) , with non - degenerate vevs , which induces contributions to @xmath213 around 10 times its experimental value , all other cases predict contributions below the experimental bound , ranging from @xmath214 to @xmath215 @xmath216 .    to summarise , anstze for the yukawa couplings of the `` simple fritzsch '' type , when generalised to multi - higgs doublet models , typically induce tree - level fcnc s , and require a higgs spectrum at least of order 10 tev , in order to ensure compatibility with experiment .",
    "notice however that the results presented here are very dependent on the assumed scheme for the yukawa couplings , and are only to be taken as an illustrative example , in the absence of a full theory for the higgs - quark - quark interactions .",
    "predictive models for yukawa interactions of extended higgs sector are likely to account for distinct , and hopefully less severe , bounds  @xcite .",
    "models that predict family replication in the higgs sector offer a very aesthetic and phenomenologically interesting scenarios .",
    "although there is abundant motivation for extending the higgs sector ( from string constructions , for example ) , in most cases the viability of these models is challenged by the occurrence of potentially dangerous fcncs at the tree - level .",
    "we have analysed the most general form of the susy potential with three higgs families , studying its minimisation , and deriving the tree - level expressions for the neutral ( scalar and pseudoscalar ) and charged higgses mass matrices .",
    "the main goal of our work was to derive a model - independent evaluation of the tree - level contributions to neutral meson mass differences .",
    "we have computed the most general expression for the tree - level neutral higgs mediated contributions to the mass difference of the neutral mesons .",
    "we took into account the exchange of all higgs states , included the effects of mixing in the higgs sector , and made no approximation with respect to dominant / sub - dominant contributions .",
    "this analysis is completely general , and can be applied to any given model with three higgs families , independently of its yukawa structure . as an example , in section  [ flavour : res ] we have assumed a simple ansatz for the yukawa couplings ( in analogy to what had previously been done ) , and have considered the contributions of two distinct higgs spectra to the @xmath152 , @xmath148 , @xmath149 and @xmath150 mass differences , finding that the strongest bound - which as expected arises from @xmath165 - requires a spectrum of order 10 tev .",
    "we again remark that the results for the higgs masses are strongly dependent on the specific ansatz for the yukawa couplings .",
    "other anstze , that account for a stronger hierarchy in the quark sector and still accommodate experimental data on quark masses and mixings , may generate quite smaller contributions to @xmath165 , and thus require a lighter higgs spectrum .",
    "this possibility is the subject of a forthcoming work @xcite , where it is shown that a higgs spectra of order 1 tev can be accommodated . on the other hand ,",
    "it is also possible that while generating smaller contributions to @xmath165 , the different anstze induce larger @xmath217 , or @xmath164 .",
    "in addition to the contributions to neutral meson mass difference , within the quark sector there are other processes that also deserve further investigation .",
    "for example , let us mention , at the one loop level , the very suppressed sm and mssm @xmath149 decays .",
    "processes involving the lepton sector also offer an even wider field for testing the new contributions induced by the additional higgses ( neutral and charged ) @xcite .",
    "cp violation , given the potential tree - level contributions to @xmath142 , may also become a stringent bound .",
