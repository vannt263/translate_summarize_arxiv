    "the central mathematical principle underlying ads / cft duality is the fact that the group @xmath0 of poincar and conformal transformations of physical @xmath1 space - time has an elegant mathematical representation on @xmath2 space where the fifth dimension has the anti - de sitter warped metric . the group of conformal transformations @xmath0 in 3 + 1 space is isomorphic to the group of isometries of ads space , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 represents the coordinate in the fifth dimension .",
    "the dynamics at @xmath6 in 3 + 1 space thus matches the behavior of the theory at the boundary @xmath7 this allows one to map the physics of quantum field theories with conformal symmetry to an equivalent description in which scale transformations have an explicit representation in ads space .",
    "even though quantum chromodynamics is a broken conformal theory , the ads / cft correspondence has led to important insights into the properties of qcd .",
    "for example , as shown by polchinski and strassler,@xcite the ads / cft duality , modified to give a mass scale , provides a nonperturbative derivation of the empirically successful dimensional counting rules@xcite for the leading power - law fall - off of the hard exclusive scattering amplitudes of the bound states of the gauge theory .",
    "the modified theory generates the hard behavior expected from qcd instead of the soft behavior characteristic of strings .",
    "other important applications include the description of spacelike hadron form factors at large transverse momentum@xcite and deep inelastic scattering structure functions at small @xmath8.@xcite the power falloff of hadronic light - front wave functions ( lfwf ) including states with nonzero orbital angular momentum is also predicted.@xcite    in the original formulation by maldacena,@xcite a correspondence was established between a supergravity string theory on a curved background and a conformally invariant @xmath9 super yang - mills theory in four - dimensional space - time .",
    "the higher dimensional theory is @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the radius of ads and the radius of the five - sphere and @xmath12 is the string scale .",
    "the extra dimensions of the five - dimensional sphere @xmath13 correspond to the @xmath14 global symmetry which rotates the particles present in the sym supermultiplet in the adjoint representation of @xmath15 . in our application to qcd ,",
    "baryon number in qcd is represented as a casimir constant on @xmath16    the reason why ads / cft duality can have at least approximate applicability to physical qcd is based on the fact that the underlying classical qcd lagrangian with massless quarks is scale - invariant.@xcite one can thus take conformal symmetry as an initial approximation to qcd , and then systematically correct for its nonzero @xmath17 function and quark masses.@xcite this  conformal template \" approach underlies the banks - zak method@xcite for expansions of qcd expressions near the conformal limit and the blm method@xcite for setting the renormalization scale in perturbative qcd applications . in the blm method",
    "the corrections to a perturbative series from the @xmath17-function are systematically absorbed into the scale of the qcd running coupling .",
    "an important example is the ",
    "generalized crewther relation\"@xcite which relates the bjorken and gross - llewellyn sum rules at the deep inelastic scale @xmath18 to the @xmath19 annihilation cross sections at specific commensurate scales @xmath20 .",
    "the crewther relation@xcite was originally derived in conformal theory ; however , after blm scale setting , it becomes a fundamental test of physical qcd , with no uncertainties from the choice of renormalization scale or scheme .",
    "qcd is nearly conformal at large momentum transfers where asymptotic freedom is applicable .",
    "nevertheless , it is remarkable that dimensional scaling for exclusive processes is observed even at relatively low momentum transfer where gluon exchanges involve relatively soft momenta.@xcite the observed scaling of hadron scattering amplitudes at moderate momentum transfers can be understood if the qcd coupling has an infrared fixed point.@xcite in this sense , qcd resembles a strongly - coupled conformal theory .",
    "the duality between a gravity theory on @xmath21 space and a conformal gauge theory at its @xmath22-dimensional boundary requires one to match the partition functions at the @xmath23 boundary , @xmath24 .",
    "the physical string modes @xmath25 , are plane waves along the poincar coordinates with four - momentum @xmath26 and hadronic invariant mass states @xmath27 . for large-@xmath5 or small-@xmath28 , @xmath29 , where the dimension @xmath30 of the string mode must be the same dimension as that of the interpolating operator @xmath31 which creates a specific hadron out of the vacuum : @xmath32 .",
    "the physics of color confinement in qcd can be described in the ads / cft approach by truncating the ads space to the domain @xmath33 where @xmath34 .",
    "the cutoff at @xmath35 is dual to the introduction of a mass gap @xmath36 ; it breaks conformal invariance and is responsible for the generation of a spectrum of color - singlet hadronic states .",
    "the truncation of the ads space insures that the distance between the colored quarks and gluons as they stream into the fifth dimension is limited to @xmath37 .",
    "the resulting @xmath1 theory has both color confinement at long distances and conformal behavior at short distances .",
    "the latter property allows one to derive dimensional counting rules for form factors and other hard exclusive processes at high momentum transfer .",
    "this approach , which can be described as a  bottom - up \" approach , has been successful in obtaining general properties of the low - lying hadron spectra , chiral symmetry breaking , and hadron couplings in ads / qcd,@xcite in addition to the hard scattering predictions.@xcite    in this  classical holographic model \" , the quarks and gluons propagate into the truncated ads interior according to the ads metric without interactions . in effect , their wilson lines , which are represented by open strings in the fifth dimension , are rigid .",
    "the resulting equations for spin 0 , @xmath38 , 1 and @xmath39 hadrons on @xmath10 lead to color - singlet states with dimension @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "consequently , only the hadronic states ( dimension-@xmath42 ) @xmath43 pseudoscalar and vector mesons , the ( dimension-@xmath41 ) @xmath44 baryons , and the ( dimension-@xmath45 ) @xmath46 glueball states , can be derived in the classical holographic limit.@xcite this description corresponds to the valence fock state as represented by the light - front fock expansion .",
    "hadrons also fluctuate in particle number , in their color representations ( such as the hidden - color states@xcite of the deuteron ) , as well as in internal orbital angular momentum .",
    "the higher fock components of the hadrons are manifestations of the quantum fluctuations of qcd ; these correspond to the fluctuations of the bulk geometry about the fixed ads metric .",
    "similarly , the orbital excitations of hadronic states correspond to quantum fluctuations about the ads metric.@xcite we thus can consistently identify higher - spin hadrons with the fluctuations around the spin 0 , @xmath38 , 1 and @xmath39 classical string solutions of the @xmath47 sector.@xcite    as a specific example , consider the twist - two ( dimension minus spin ) glueball interpolating operator @xmath48 with total internal space - time orbital momentum @xmath49 and conformal dimension @xmath50 .",
    "we match the large @xmath5 asymptotic behavior of each string mode to the corresponding conformal dimension of the boundary operators of each hadronic state while maintaining conformal invariance . in the conformal limit",
    ", an @xmath51 quantum , which is identified with a quantum fluctuation about the ads geometry , corresponds to an effective five - dimensional mass @xmath52 in the bulk side .",
    "the allowed values of @xmath52 are uniquely determined by requiring that asymptotically the dimensions become spaced by integers , according to the spectral relation @xmath53.@xcite the four - dimensional mass spectrum follows from the dirichlet boundary condition @xmath54 , @xmath55 , on the ads string amplitudes for each wave functions with spin @xmath56 2 .",
    "the eigen - spectrum is then determined from the zeros of bessel functions , @xmath57 .",
    "the predicted spectra @xcite of mesons and baryons with zero mass quarks is shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : mesonspec ] and [ fig : baryonspec ] .",
    "the only parameter is @xmath58 gev , and @xmath59 gev for mesons and baryons , respectively .",
    "current matrix elements in ads / qcd are computed from the overlap of the normalizable modes dual to the incoming and outgoing hadron @xmath60 and @xmath61 and the non - normalizable mode @xmath62 , dual to the external source @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the spin of the interpolating operator @xmath65 , which creates an @xmath66-fock state @xmath67 at the ads boundary .",
    "@xmath62 has the value 1 at zero momentum transfer , and as boundary limit the external current , thus @xmath68 .",
    "the solution to the ads wave equation subject to boundary conditions at @xmath69 and @xmath70 is@xcite @xmath71 . at large enough @xmath72 ,",
    "the important contribution to ( [ eq : ff ] ) is from the region near @xmath73 . at small @xmath28 ,",
    "the @xmath66-mode @xmath74 scales as @xmath75 , and we recover the power law scaling,@xcite @xmath76^{\\tau - 1}$ ] , where the twist @xmath77 , is equal to the number of partons , @xmath78 .",
    "a numerical computation for the pion form factor gives the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ff ] , where the resonant structure in the time - like region from the ads cavity modes is apparent .",
    "the ads / qcd correspondence provides a simple description of hadrons at the amplitude level by mapping string modes to the impact space representation of lfwfs .",
    "it is useful to define the partonic variables @xmath79 , where @xmath80 are the physical position coordinates , @xmath81 are frame - independent internal coordinates , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 is the hadron transverse center of momentum @xmath84 , @xmath85 .",
    "we find for a two - parton lfwf the lorentz - invariant form @xmath86 the @xmath87 are the zeroes of the bessel functions reflecting the dirichlet boundary condition .",
    "the variable @xmath88 @xmath89 , represents the invariant separation between quarks . in the case of a two - parton state",
    ", it gives a direct relation between the scale of the invariant separation between quarks , @xmath90 , and the holographic coordinate in ads space : @xmath91 .",
    "the ground state and first orbital eigenmode are depicted in the figure below .",
    "the holographic model is quite successful in describing the known light hadron spectrum .",
    "the only mass scale is @xmath92 .",
    "the model incorporates confinement and conformal symmetry . only dimension-@xmath93 and 4 states @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 appear in the duality at the classical level .",
    "as we have described , non - zero orbital angular momentum and higher fock - states require the introduction of quantum fluctuations .",
    "the model gives a simple description of the structure of hadronic form factors and lfwfs , which can be used as an initial approximation to the actual eigensolutions of the light - front hamiltonian for qcd .",
    "it also explains the suppression of the odderon .",
    "the dominance of the quark - interchange mechanism in hard exclusive processes also emerges naturally from the classical duality of the holographic model .",
