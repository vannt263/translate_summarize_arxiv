    "it is also quite interesting that , depending on how one chooses the path of the gauge link that makes the gtmd correlator gauge invariant  @xcite , @xmath0 provides either the ( canonical ) oam of jaffe - manohar  @xcite or the oam in the definition of ji  @xcite .",

    "it has been argued that , based on parity arguments in a two - body scattering picture , the functions @xmath0 and @xmath1 should not be included in a twist-2 parametrization .",

    "@xcite and the results obtained in explicit model calculations  @xcite . in the following , we will go along the arguments developed in refs .",
    "@xcite and explain why they actually do not hold .",
    "we note essentially three claims in refs .",
    "@xcite :    1 .",
    "the lorentz structure associated with the function @xmath0 and appearing in the parametrization of the correlator @xmath74}_{\\lambda'\\lambda}$ ] in ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath75 is parity - odd . in the center - of - mass ( cm ) frame , or equivalently in the `` lab '' frame , with the @xmath76-direction chosen as the @xmath29-direction , the net longitudinal polarization defined in eq .",
    "is clearly a parity violating term ( pseudoscalar ) under space inversion .",
    "this implies that a measurement of single longitudinal polarization asymmetries would violate parity conservation in an ordinary two - body scattering process corresponding to tree - level , twist-2 amplitudes .",
    "2 .   as one can see from eqs .   and",
    ", the functions @xmath0 and @xmath1 can be nonzero only when the corresponding helicity amplitude combinations are imaginary . hence",
    ", these functions can not have a straightforward partonic interpretation .",
    "moreover , integrating e.g.  eq .",
    "over @xmath77 gives zero , meaning that this term decouples from partonic angular momentum sum rules .",
    "3 .   in the cm frame , where the hadron and quark momenta are coplanar , there must be another independent direction for the helicity amplitude combinations associated with @xmath0 and @xmath1 to be non - zero . that is provided by twist-3 amplitudes and corresponding gtmds .",
    "let us first discuss the parity property of the lorentz structure in eq .  .",
    "parity is a frame - independent symmetry , and so does not depend on any particular frame .",
    "under an ordinary parity transformation , see for instance chapter 3.6 of ref .",
    "@xcite , the structure in eq .   becomes @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the parity - transformed helicity and momentum .",
    "clearly , the structure does not change sign under a parity transformation , and so is parity - even and @xmath81 ) is involved , the structure is automatically parity - even . ] .",
    "this is consistent with the light - front helicity amplitudes given in eq .  , where the structure contributes in the form @xmath82 which is invariant under light - front parity transformation .",
    "while it is true that the net longitudinal polarization @xmath83 is parity - odd and therefore can not generate by itself a parity - conserving single - spin asymmetry , it is actually multiplied in eq .   by @xmath84 , another parity - odd quantity which is related to the quark oam",
    "therefore , the parity argument can not be used to exclude the possible connection between a single - spin asymmetry and the function @xmath0 .",
    "the same is true for @xmath1 using a similar argument where the nucleon polarization is basically replaced by the quark polarization .",
    "we agree that longitudinal single - spin effects for elastic two - body scattering are necessarily parity - violating , but the two - body picture in general can not be used for the counting of gtmds as we explain in more detail below .",
    "now we move to the second claim .",
    "contrary to tmds and gpds , the gtmds are complex - valued functions .",
    "the two - body scattering picture does not incorporate any initial or final - state interactions which , in particular , generate ( naive ) @xmath57-odd effects described by the imaginary parts of the gtmds .",
    "this already shows that two - body scattering could at best be applied to the real part of the gtmds which is ( naive ) @xmath57-even .",
    "the fact that the real parts of @xmath0 and @xmath1 are related to imaginary helicity amplitude combinations does not necessarily mean that these gtmds can not have a straightforward partonic interpretation .",
    "the same occurs in the gpd case , for instance , where complex - valued helicity amplitudes do not spoil a partonic interpretation of gpds ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "this can also be understood from the partonic interpretation of the distributions in impact - parameter space . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , which generalizes the work of burkardt  @xcite to phase - space , the gtmds in impact - parameter space are obtained from the momentum - transfer space through the following two - dimensional fourier transform @xmath85 the hermiticity property of the gtmd correlator guarantees that the two - dimensional fourier transform is real  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the impact - parameter space versions of @xmath0 and @xmath1 follow from the two - dimensional fourier transform of eqs .   and",
    ", @xmath86,\\\\ \\tfrac{(\\bar{{\\boldsymbol{k}}}_\\perp\\times\\partial_{{\\boldsymbol{b}}_\\perp})_z}{m^2}\\,\\mathcal g_{1,1}&=\\tfrac{1}{2}\\left[\\mathcal h_{++,++}-\\mathcal h_{+-,+-}+\\mathcal h_{-+,-+}-\\mathcal h_{--,--}\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in impact - parameter space , the helicity amplitude combinations associated with @xmath87 and @xmath88 are real , and so are suitable for a partonic interpretation .",
    "also , since the gtmds are functions of the transverse momenta _ via _ the scalar combinations @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 , eqs .   and give automatically zero in the limit @xmath92 or by integration over @xmath77 , implying that @xmath0 and @xmath1 do not reduce to any gpd or tmd .",
    "however , this does not mean that @xmath0 decouples from partonic angular momentum sum rules , since it has been shown independently in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite that the ( gauge - invariant ) quark canonical oam of jaffe - manohar  @xcite is actually given by the expression @xmath93\\nonumber\\\\ & = \\int{\\mathrm{d}}x\\,{\\mathrm{d}}^2\\bar { { \\boldsymbol{k}}}_\\perp\\,\\,(\\bar{{\\boldsymbol{k}}}_\\perp\\times i\\partial_{{\\boldsymbol{\\delta}}_\\perp})_z\\left[\\tfrac{i(\\bar{{\\boldsymbol{k}}}_\\perp\\times{\\boldsymbol{\\delta}}_\\perp)_z}{m^2}\\,f_{1,4}\\right]_{|{\\boldsymbol{\\delta}}_\\perp|=0}\\nonumber\\\\ & = -\\int{\\mathrm{d}}x\\,{\\mathrm{d}}^2\\bar { { \\boldsymbol{k}}}_\\perp\\,\\tfrac{\\bar{{\\boldsymbol{k}}}_\\perp^2}{m^2}\\,f_{1,4}(x,0,\\bar{{\\boldsymbol{k}}}^2_\\perp,0,0;\\eta),\\label{oamformula}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which _ a priori _ has no reason to vanish .",
    "similarly , the amplitude associated with the gpd @xmath94 vanishes in the limit @xmath92 , but this does not mean that @xmath94 should disappear from the ji relation for angular momentum  @xcite .",
    "[ fig1 ]    finally , we address the third claim .",
    "the helicity amplitudes have been used several times in the literature for the counting of independent functions associated with a particular parton - parton correlator , see for instance refs .",
    "it is often considered convenient to think of the correlator in eq .   as representing a two - body elastic scattering amplitude , see fig .",
    "the gauge link is excluded from this picture , and so are initial and final - state interactions , which eliminates also the @xmath95 dependence .",
    "the light - front parity constraint ( [ eq : parity - hel ] ) can then be rewritten in the form @xmath96 so , from the 16 possible helicity amplitudes only 8 are independent , in agreement with our general discussion in sect .",
    "[ subs : gtmdcounting ] .",
    "although the counting is frame - independent , the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite chose to work for convenience in the cm frame , or equivalently the lab frame , where all momenta are coplanar . if one chooses the @xmath29-axis to lie in the scattering plane like in refs .",
    "@xcite , one would then conclude that there is only one frame - independent or intrinsic transverse vector , and so the cross product @xmath97 would simply give zero .",
    "for chiral - even , non - flip amplitudes , instead of the four functions @xmath98 , @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath99 introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , only @xmath98 and @xmath99 would survive .",
    "however , as stressed by diehl in ref .",
    "@xcite , the two - body scattering formulation is somewhat imprecise .",
    "the @xmath100 are not helicity amplitudes in the strict sense .",
    "they contain , in particular , an explicit dependence on the light - front vector @xmath101 which already defines the @xmath29-direction can be defined in terms of the physically relevant four - vectors .",
    "this vector is independent of the three four - vectors one has in the quark - nucleon scattering picture . in the case of deep - inelastic scattering , for instance , it is the four - momentum of the exchanged virtual gauge boson which provides another independent four - vector .",
    "after factorization , even ordinary forward parton distributions still know about @xmath18 . ] .",
    "one can not perform an arbitrary lorentz transformation that modifies this direction without changing at the same time the definition of the gtmds , and hence the canonical twist expansion . in the most general configuration",
    ", @xmath101 does not belong to the cm scattering plane ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "therefore , there are _ two _ independent intrinsic transverse vectors at leading twist , namely @xmath62 and @xmath63 , allowing one to form the cross - product @xmath102 which reduces to @xmath97 in the symmetric frame used for the parametrization of ref .",
    "one does not need to invoke higher - twist to provide the missing direction .",
    "it is essential to keep the explicit @xmath18 dependence , since otherwise one would miss half of the allowed gtmds , just like one would obtain two chiral - odd gpds  @xcite instead of four  @xcite .",
    "note also that applying the two - body scattering picture without @xmath18 dependence to the tmd correlator , one would find only three independent ( naive ) @xmath103-even functions @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 instead of six , since @xmath107 in the cm frame with @xmath108 .",
    "after the model - independent considerations in the previous two sections we now proceed to discuss the calculation of @xmath0 and @xmath1 in two spectator models  the scalar diquark model and the quark - target model .",
    "in fact , in the ( parity - conserving ) scalar diquark model nonzero results for those two gtmds were already presented in ref .",
    "@xcite  using a diagrammatic approach , but in view of the doubts raised in  @xcite we reconsider the calculation here also in the context of light - front quantization .",
    "moreover , a set of gtmds including @xmath0 and @xmath1 was calculated in two different relativistic light - front quark models in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it also turned out that both @xmath0 and @xmath1 are non - vanishing . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is argued that `` these nonzero results are coming about from the kinematics or from effective higher - twist components arising from quarks confinement '' .",
    "we disagree with this statement .",
    "first , kinematics can not be invoked to explain nonzero results of existing calculations  @xcite , since they were performed using the representation of the gtmds in terms of lfwfs which are by definition / construction frame - independent . moreover , using light - front quantization , the quark correlation functions   entering the calculation of @xmath0 and @xmath1 have a decomposition which involve only the `` good '' light - front components of the fields , and therefore correspond to pure twist - two contributions ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in this context note also that in spectator models the active partons are ( space - like ) off - shell .",
    "however , this feature , which is not specific to the calculation of gtmds but rather holds even for ordinary forward parton distributions , does not increase the counting of independent twist-2 functions .",
    "second , as we discuss in this section , not only the scalar diquark model but also the quark - target model predicts nonzero results for @xmath0 and @xmath1 . both models being purely perturbative",
    ", this means that `` effective higher twist components arising from quarks confinement '' can not be invoked to explain these results .    that @xmath0 and @xmath1 are nonzero is a generic feature .",
    "they are directly related to the amount of oam and spin - orbit correlations inside the target @xcite .",
    "vanishing @xmath0 and @xmath1 would therefore imply vanishing ( canonical ) oam and spin - orbit correlations . in order to further solidify the relation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 and the spin / orbital structure of the nucleon , we compute the canonical oam and spin - orbit correlations from the operator definition in both the scalar diquark model and the quark - target model .",
    "they are nonzero and satisfy the model - independent relations of refs .",
    "@xcite    for convenience , we will restrict the discussions in the following to the case @xmath69 .",
    "we calculate the matrix element in eq .   in the scalar diquark model , i.e. , a yukawa theory defined by the lagrangian ( see also app .",

    "this re - confirms in a model - independent way that these functions have to be included in the leading - twist parametrization of gtmds .",
    "in hadronic physics , gtmds have already attracted considerable attention .",
    "often they are denoted as _ mother functions _ because many gtmds reduce to gpds or tmds in certain kinematical limits . in this work",
    "we have focussed on two particular twist-2 gtmds  denoted by @xmath0 and @xmath1 in ref .",
    "@xcite  which neither survive the gpd - limit nor the tmd - limit since in the decomposition of the gtmd correlator they are accompanied by a factor that is linear in both the transverse parton momentum and the transverse - momentum transfer to the nucleon . in some sense",
    "this makes these two functions actually unique .",
    "the particular role played by @xmath0 and @xmath1 is nicely reflected by their intimate connection to the orbital angular momentum of partons in a longitudinally polarized nucleon and in an unpolarized nucleon , respectively  @xcite .",
    "those relations open up new opportunities to study the spin / orbital structure of the nucleon .",
    "for instance , new insights in this area could now be obtained through lattice qcd , given the related pioneering and encouraging studies of tmds and other parton correlation functions in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "our main intention in this paper has been to address recent criticism according to which even the mere existence of @xmath0 and @xmath1 is questionable  @xcite . to this end",
    "we have shown in a model - independent way why the criticism of  @xcite does not hold .",
    "we have also computed @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the scalar diquark model of the nucleon , in the quark - target model , and in perturbative qcd for large transverse parton momenta , and we generally have found nonzero results in lowest nontrivial order in perturbation theory .",
    "moreover , in the two spectator models we have verified explicitly the relation between the two gtmds and the oam of partons . in summary",
    ", we hope that our work helps to resolve any potential doubt / confusion with regard to the status of the gtmds @xmath0 and @xmath1 and their relation to the spin / orbital structure of the nucleon .",
