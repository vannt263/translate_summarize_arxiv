    "one key requirement for a starburst is the presence of a reservoir of dense , cold gas that can be efficiently converted to stars . for galaxies entering rich clusters",
    "this is especially important , because they are expected to be affected by mechanisms that can remove cold gas from the haloes and discs of infalling galaxies ( e.g.ram-pressure stripping , gunn & gott  1972 ) or prevent further cooling of gas within galaxies dark matter halos ( starvation or strangulation , e.g.  larson , tinsley & caldwell  1980 ; bekki , couch & shioya  2002 ) .",
    "this environmental dependence has a profound influence on cluster galaxies evolutionary histories , the net effect of which is the eventual termination of star formation ( there is virtually no residual star formation in the cores of local clusters ) . the observational evidence for the gradual truncation of star formation in clusters is the conspicuous disappearance of star - forming disc galaxies in the cores of rich clusters since @xmath42 . it has been proposed that the spiral galaxies in distant clusters must be transforming into passive lenticular ( s0 ) galaxies , since the fraction of s0s in rich clusters is believed to increase at the same time that the spirals begin to vanish ( dressler et al.1997 ) .",
    "however , the detailed nature of the physics controlling this evolution is still poorly understood .",
    "for example , what process is responsible for the transformation of the bulge - to - disc ratio of the spiral population ? ( kodama & smail 2001 ) .",
    "a growing body of observational evidence suggests that distant clusters contain significant populations of dust obscured starburst galaxies in their peripheral regions ( e.g.  duc et al .",

    "( 2009 ) proposed that the population of luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs ) residing in the ` infall ' population of @xmath43 clusters could be examples of spiral galaxies undergoing an episode of bulge growth via circumnuclear starburst , and therefore excellent candidates for the progenitors of local massive s0s .",
    "geach et al .",
    "( 2009 ) estimate that , given the cluster lirgs current sfrs , 10@xmath44 of stars could be built up within a few 100myr .",
    "although this simple model suggests that these galaxies could evolve onto the bright end of the local cluster s0 luminosity function by @xmath45 , we still lack crucial observational constraints , such as the likely duration of the starburst , where it occurs in the cluster , and limits on the final stellar mass of the bulge .    in this letter",
    "we refine our model by asking a simple question : what is the mass of the cold molecular gas reservoir in these starbursts ? using the iram plateau de bure interferometer",
    "we have conducted a pilot study of the cold gas properties of two dusty starburst galaxies in the distant cluster cl0024 + 16 .",
    "the initial results are presented here . throughout",
    "we assume @xmath46 in units of 100kms@xmath7mpc@xmath7 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "the projected scale at @xmath4 in this model is 5.3kpc/@xmath25 , and the luminosity distance is @xmath49mpc .",
    "the two galaxies chosen for this pilot study were selected as two of the brightest in our _ spitzer space telescope _ infrared spectrograph ( irs ) survey of 24@xmath1m - selected members of cl0024 + 16 ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "full details of the mid - infrared observations can be found in geach et al .",
    "( 2006 & 2009 ) .",
    "both galaxies have @xmath50mjy , and implied far - infrared luminosities @xmath51 ; they are in the lirg class .",
    "the far - infrared luminosity is estimated from the luminosity of the 7.7@xmath1 m polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) emission line , extrapolating from the tight correlation between pah strength and total infrared luminosity observed in local star forming galaxies ( smith et al.2007 ; geach et al .",
    "both galaxies are in the outskirts , or infall region , of the cluster : they large clustocentric radius , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the virial radius , @xmath2@xmath55mpc ( treu et al .",
    "further details of the two galaxies is provided in table  1 .",
    "the observations were conducted using the iram plateau de bure interferometer on 31 july 2008 ( mipsj002621.7 ) and 25 august 2008 ( mipsj002721.0 ) as part of program s035 .",
    "the exposure times were 9.5hr and 8.2hr for each source respectively using 5 antennae .",
    "the observing conditions were excellent in terms of atmospheric phase stability , however any anomalous and high phase - noise visibilities were flagged .",
    "data were calibrated , mapped and analysed using the iram gildas software ( guilloteau & lucas  2000 ) .",
    "phase and flux calibration was performed using 3c454.3 and 0007 + 106 .",
    "secondary flux calibrators also included the sources mwc349 , 3c454.3 , 0119 + 115 , 3c84 , 2145 + 067 .",
    "we targeted the co(10 ) 115.27ghz rotational transition , which at @xmath56 is redshifted into the 3 mm band , with @xmath57ghz .",
    "the central frequency of the 3 mm receiver was set to the frequency of the redshifted co(10 ) line at the systemic redshift of each galaxy derived from optical spectroscopy ( table1 ) .",
    "the correlator was set - up with 2.5mhz spacing ( 2@xmath5864 channels , 320mhz bandwidth ) to comfortably cover the co line should it be offset from the systemic redshift , and to take into account a broad velocity profile .",
    "the noise per 18kms@xmath7 channel for the two observations is 1.4mjy  beam@xmath7 and 1.3mjy  beam@xmath7 .",
    "we detect co(10 ) emission in both galaxies with significances of @xmath60 and @xmath61 respectively .",
    "note that these observations represent the highest redshift co detection in un - lensed lirgs yet achieved ( see melchior & combes  2008 ) .",
    "in figure1 we present velocity integrated emission maps , and the spectra extracted from the peak pixel of these are shown in figure2 .",
    "we estimate the line luminosities by fitting the spectra with gaussian profiles , although in the case of mipsj002721.0 , the broad line is better fit with a double gaussian ( there is a marginal improvement on the @xmath62 fit ) .",
    "we discuss the physical interpretation of the line profiles in  3.2 .",
    "we calculate @xmath21 ( in the usual units of kkms@xmath7pc@xmath28 ) from the integrated line emission according to e.g. solomon & vanden  bout  ( 2005 ) : @xmath63 .",
    "the line luminosities are given in table1 with 1-@xmath64 errors estimated by repeatedly re - evaluating the line fits after adding noise to the spectra .",
    "the ` noise ' is randomly drawn from a gaussian distribution with a width equivalent to the variance in the data sampled in the extreme wings ( @xmath65kms@xmath7 ) of the line .",
    "we take the standard deviation in the resulting @xmath21 values from 1000 of these ` bootstrap ' realisations as the 1@xmath64 uncertainty in the measured value .",
    "it is assumed that the co luminosity linearly traces the molecular gas mass : @xmath66 ( e.g.  young & scoville 1991 ; solomon & vanden bout  2005 ) with the conversion factor @xmath67 typically taken as either @xmath68 for ` normal ' spirals ( the galactic conversion factor ) , or @xmath69 for ultraluminous infrared galaxies",
    "( ulirgs , @xmath70 ) . the cluster starbursts are not quite in the ulirg class , but are at the extreme end of what would be considered a ` normal ' ir - bright galaxy ( see gao & solomon2004 ) .",
    "we therefore adopt the more conservative ulirg conversion when estimating the h@xmath59 gas mass ( table  1 ) , and we discuss the implications of this in  3.4 . in this sense ,",
    "the estimated h@xmath59 masses could be considered lower limits .",
    "deep , high - resolution ( fwhm@xmath20.8@xmath25 ) optical imaging of these galaxies ( fig .  1 ,",
    "inset ) allows us to constrain their orientation .",
    "mipsj002621.7 appears to be nearly face - on to the line of sight , with a bright core and distinctive arms .",
    "mipsj002721.0 is slightly more complicated ; an un - sharp masked _",
    "r_-band image reveals a ring of bright knots and a bright core or bar that appears to be slightly extended to the north - east .",
    "it could also be orientated close to face - on .",
    "the co(10 ) spectrum for mipsj002721.0 exhibits a double peaked line profile ( fig .",
    "2 ) , and we show in figure  3 that the peak of the co emission traced by this velocity shear describes a locus that runs @xmath210kpc across the direction of the extended optical emission .",
    "this could be interpreted as a rotating disc , with an angular separation between the velocity peaks of @xmath71 or @xmath72kpc .",
    "note that the peak of the co emission at the [ o  ii ] redshift is centred on the bright central core .",
    "an alternative situation is that this galaxy is in the process of a merger along the line - of - sight , and the co(10 ) emission profile originates from emission from two gas - rich clumps .",
    "@xmath733727 emission line is indicated by the vertical dashed lines , and expected to be accurate to @xmath230kms@xmath7 .",
    "the systemic co redshifts agree with the optical redshifts ( czoske et al .",
    "2001 ; moran et al .",
    "2006 ) , although in the case of mipsj002721.0 the broad blue - shifted profile is best fit by a double gaussian with a peak separation of @xmath74kms@xmath7 .",
    "this could be evidence of a rotating disc , or could also be interpreted as a merger .",

    "this could be evidence of a rotating disc , or could also be interpreted as a merger .",
    "note that redshifts have been corrected for heliocentric velocity ( see table  1).,scaledwidth=49.0% ]    finally , we can use the co line widths to estimate the galaxies dynamical masses . for a rotating disc of radius @xmath75 ,",
    "the dynamical mass enclosed within @xmath75 is @xmath76 ( neri  et al .",
    "2003 ) . one way of estimating the likely size of the molecular disc is to force these galaxies to fall on the global schmidt - kennicutt relation , connecting star formation surface density to the gas surface density : @xmath77 ( schmidt  1959 ; kennicutt  1998 ) .",
    "assuming the gas masses and sfrs given in table1 , this implies discs of radius @xmath20.4kpc and @xmath21kpc for mipsj002621.7 and mipsj002721.0 respectively .",
    "these values are not unreasonable , given that observations of local lirgs indicate large concentrations of gas in their inner few kpc ( sanders & mirabel  1996 ) . however",
    ", clearly the latter value is at odds with the @xmath210kpc separation of the velocity peaks in mipsj002721.0 , and of course , these radii would further increase if we had adopted a higher co - to - h@xmath59 mass conversion .",
    "assuming @xmath78 for mipsj002621.7 , we find @xmath79 .",
    "this ignores the systematic uncertainty on the inclination angle , which would clearly affect these mass estimates .",
    "the orientation of mipsj002721.0 is similarly uncertain  it could be a face - on merger , or an inclined disc . assuming it is a disc of radius 5kpc , with @xmath80 ( appropriate for a random orientation ) , this yields @xmath81 . in a merger model",
    "this estimate would increase by a factor @xmath22 ( neri et al .",
    "2003 ; genzel et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "if we assume that the far - infrared luminosity is dominated by dusty star - formation , then the star formation efficiency can be represented by @xmath82 . for these galaxies , we have @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "this is in the range observed in local ( @xmath85 ) spirals , which have @xmath86 ( solomon & vanden bout2005 ) .",
    "in contrast , much larger values of @xmath87 are observed in ulirgs and smgs over a wide range of redshift ( @xmath88 ) implying higher sfes , perhaps driven by more violent mergers and interactions ( downes , solomon , & radford  1993 ; tacconi et al .",
    "2008 ; coppin et al .  2008 ) .",
    "recently , daddi et al .  ( 2008 ) have presented evidence for similar ` low - efficiency ' star formation in two _ bzk_-selected galaxies at @xmath89 .",
    "those authors argue that while the most luminous galaxies such as ulirgs and smgs are indeed special cases of intense , high - efficiency star - formation , the _ general _ case could be a less efficient ( yet still vigorous ) mode of star - formation fuelled by a large reservoir of gas .",
    "unfortunately a lack of co observations of lirgs at intermediate redshift makes such comparisons challenging .",
    "more extensive surveys in the alma era will no - doubt dramatically improve our understanding of this issue .",
    "given our measured gas mass , we can estimate the gas depletion timescale from the galaxies current sfrs ( table  1 ) . assuming the activity continues at the observed rate , and that all the gas is converted to stars , the lifetime of the starbursts are @xmath2100myr and @xmath2160myr for mipsj002621.7 and mipsj002721.0 respectively .",
    "note that this is much shorter than the time it takes for a galaxy on a radial orbit to traverse the distance from the outskirts of the cluster to the core , which is of order 25gyr for cl0024 + 16 ( treu  et  al .",
    "the implication of these short time - scales is that self - exhaustion of the gas - reservoirs dominates these galaxies star formation histories .",
    "moreover it is only the environment within a few 100kpc of the cluster core that can ram - pressure strip the disc gas ( and thus truncate star formation ) .",
    "the major episode of star - formation for these very active galaxies will be long - since over by the time the galaxies reach the core .",
    "note that this may not be true of the ` general ' star forming population , where lower sfrs mean that gas is not exhausted in such a dramatic way , and allows star - formation in less active systems to endure further into the cluster environment ( e.g.  moran et al.2007 ) .",
    "we have treated these galaxies as ulirgs in terms of h@xmath59 mass estimation , but how would our conclusions change if we applied the galactic conversion of @xmath90 ?",
    "the obvious implication is that our derived gas masses would increase by a factor 6@xmath58 , and so the galaxies descendants could have stellar masses of order @xmath210@xmath91 .",
    "if the majority of this additional mass is built in the bulge region , then this further supports a model where spiral galaxies in distant clusters can evolve into some of the most massive s0 galaxies in the cores of local clusters .",
    "the longer gas - depletion timescales ( @xmath2500myr and @xmath2900myr ) are still shorter than the time it takes the galaxies to reach the virial radius in cl0024 + 16 ; our conclusion that the majority of the bulge growth occurs in the outskirts of the cluster still holds .",
    "these galaxies are clearly different in nature to the milky way  they are forming stars at @xmath215@xmath58 the galactic rate for example .",
    "although these galaxies are not as extreme as ulirgs , it is likely that their mode of star formation is more similar to ulirgs than the ` quiescent ' mode of star formation that occurs in the discs of local spirals .",
    "it could be driven by a circumnuclear mode where cold gas is being funnelled into the central regions for example .",
    "taking this into account , we assume that the ulirg conversion factor is most appropriate here .     _",
    "r_-band images of mipsj002721.0 .",
    "the main morphological details are a ring of knots and a central bright core which is extended to the north - east .",
    "the four images are overlaid with the co(10 ) emission slices taken at 70kms@xmath7 intervals .",
    "the change in peak position represents the velocity shear across the galaxy .",
    "the contours are taken from the cleaned map , and are at integer multiples of the noise , @xmath20.65mjybeam@xmath7 .",
    "the separation of the velocity peaks correspond to @xmath72kpc.,scaledwidth=49.0% ]      this pilot study is not extensive enough to make strong conclusions about the potential role of the cluster environment on the gas properties of these galaxies ; a more complete survey is needed .",
    "however we can make some comments about the possible mechanisms that might be operating , the likely fate of these galaxies , and the implications this has for models of galaxy evolution in rich clusters .    at their large clustocentric radii ,",
    "these galaxies are not affected by ram - pressure stripping ( although weak pressure of the icm on the discs of the galaxies could promote star formation in the disc ; see bekki & couch  2003 and the discussion in geach  et  al .",
    "loosely bound gas in the halos of the galaxies could be gradually removed ( moran et al .",
    "2007 ) , but the additional mass such a reservoir could supply in the short - term is probably insignificant compared to the large masses already in the discs and cores .",
    "so , provided the molecular reservoirs are securely bound to the galaxy , the cold gas mass we measure now is likely to contribute to their final stellar masses .",
    "their current stellar masses ( estimated from their @xmath92-band luminosities , see geach et al .",
    "2009 ) are likely to be in the range @xmath93@xmath94 , implying that the current episode of star formation could double their stellar mass ( if the bursts are half - way through their lifetime ) . assuming most of the current star formation occurs in the central regions , then relative fading of the disc component compared to the maturing bulge will contribute to the morphological transformation necessary for them to evolve into a massive s0 ( kodama & smail  2001 ) .",
    "these galaxies appear to be undergoing significant evolution in the outskirts of the cluster , with their activity potentially driven by mergers and interactions .",
    "so how important is the central cluster environment in transforming spirals to s0s , and maintaining the evolution of the morphology - density relationship ?",
    "our observations suggest that the cluster environment is not required to terminate star formation in the progenitors of s0s ; the key environmental effect might be more subtle .",
    "one can speculate on the likely processes that the galaxies will experience as they are virialised ( long after they have used up their gas ) .",
    "first , the lack of accretion of additional gas from a cooling halo will prevent additional star formation .",
    "it is unlikely that the galaxies will experience further mergers , and so they can not acquire cold gas that way ; all that remains is morphological transformation .",
    "if the galaxies are on radial orbits , then high speed passes in the cluster potential and close encounters could promote tidal disruptions or even removal of any remaining spiral disc ( moore , lake  & katz  1998 ; gnedin  2003 ) , completing the transformation to s0 .",
    "we have presented new iram co detections of two lirgs in the outskirts of the rich cluster cl0024 + 16 at @xmath4 . from the co(10 )",
    "line luminosities , we measure h@xmath59 gas masses of @xmath95@xmath6 and @xmath96@xmath6 in the two galaxies .",
    "this assumes a conversion between co luminosity and h@xmath59 mass that is applied in ulirgs ; if we adopt the galactic conversion factor , these estimates would increase by a factor @xmath26@xmath58 .",
    "the infrared - derived sfrs are @xmath260@xmath6yr@xmath7 , and so they will exhaust their reservoirs in as little as @xmath2150myr .",
    "our observations hint that dusty starbursts in the outskirts of cl0024 + 16 can assemble @xmath97 of stellar mass long before they reach the cluster core , implying that the cluster environment is unlikely to have a significant influence on the burst .",
    "however , it is interesting to note that one of the galaxies shows evidence of dynamic disturbance , potentially linked to a merger . if the galaxies are destined to evolve into s0s , then the main transformation required after the gas reservoirs have been exhausted is fading of the disc relative to the bulge .",
    "potentially this could be accompanied by some morphological disturbance when the galaxies reach the high density core .    on a final note ,",
    "we highlight the fact that if the critical epoch of star formation occurs @xmath212gyr before the galaxies reach the virial radius , and these starbursts are feeding the local s0 population , then there should be a sizable population of post - starburst ( k+a ) galaxies at @xmath2@xmath98 in rich clusters at @xmath990.3 ( couch & sharples  1987 ) .",
    "detection of such an ` intermediate ' population would be a key piece of evidence in the model where starbursts triggered early during cluster infall at high - redshift are rapidly exhausting their gas reservoirs and sinking to the bottom of the cluster potential well where they are destined to complete their evolution into local massive s0s .",
