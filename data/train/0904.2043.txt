    "branching patterns are widely spread in the nature @xcite .",
    "some patterns appear to be quite similar to each other even if their generation process are different .",

    "a property based on graph - theoretic structure ( and not on spatial extent ) is called topological . connectivity and degree distributions of complex networks",
    "are typical and important topological structures .",
    "in particular , the topological structure of a branching pattern can be expressed by a binary - tree graph .    a _ full binary tree _",
    "is a tree graph ( i.e. , a connected graph without loops ) where every node has exactly zero or two ` children ' ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : binary ] for reference ) . for simplicity",
    ", we use the term ` binary tree ' instead of ` full binary tree ' hereafter , since we focus on only full binary trees throughout the paper . a node without any children",
    "is called _ leaf _ , the node without ` parents ' is called _ root _ , and the number of leaves is called _",
    "magnitude_. binary trees have been mainly investigated in computer science , and frequently used in order to represent some types of data structures such as binary search tree , binary heap , and expression tree @xcite .    in order to derive topological characteristics of branching patterns , a method of branch ordering",
    "has been introduced by horton @xcite and strahler @xcite . with this method , ramification complexity and a hierarchical structure of branching patterns",

    "@xmath2 is defined recursively as @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the kronecker delta .",
    "we define a _ branch _ of order @xmath5 as a maximal path connecting nodes of order @xmath5 .",
    "the ratio of the number of branches of two subsequent orders is called the _ bifurcation ratio _ , and it has been found in many branching patterns that the bifurcation ratio takes almost constant value for different orders , which is known as `` horton s law of stream numbers '' especially in river networks @xcite . horton - strahler analysis has been applied to a wide range of branching patterns @xcite .    a simple model called _ random model _ or _ equiprobable model",
    "_ , formulated by shreve @xcite , is a finite probability space @xmath6 , where @xmath7 denotes the sample space consisting of topologically distinct binary trees of magnitude @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is the uniform probability measure on @xmath7 . we also introduce a random variable @xmath10 such that @xmath11 represents the number of branches of order @xmath5 in a binary tree @xmath12 .",
