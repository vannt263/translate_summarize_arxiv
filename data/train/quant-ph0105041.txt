    "it is well known that the jaynes - cummings model @xcite plays an important role in investigation of interaction between atoms and quantum radiation field ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "the point is that the model describes fairly well the physical processes in the system and , at the same time , allows an exact solution .    in the usual formulation of the jaynes - cummings model @xcite ,",
    "the atom is considered as though it consists of two or very few non - degenerated levels .",
    "in fact , the radiative transitions in real atoms occur between the states with given angular momentum @xmath0 and its projection @xmath1 ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "this means that even in the case of only two levels , the degeneration with respect to the quantum number @xmath2 taking @xmath3 different values should be taken into account .",
    "the simplest example is provided by a dipole transition between the states @xmath4 and @xmath5 when the excited atomic state is a triply degenerate one ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "let us stress one more important difference .",
    "the radiation field in conventional jaynes - cummings model is represented by the plane waves of photons with given linear momentum and polarization . at the same time , the multipole transitions in real atoms emit the multipole photons represented by the quantized spherical waves with given angular momentum and parity @xcite . although there is no principle difference between the plane and spherical waves within the classical domain since both represent the complete orthogonal sets of solutions of the homogeneous wave equation @xcite and can be re - expanded with respect to each other , the quantum counterparts of these two representations are non - equivalent because they describe the physical quantities ( the linear and angular momenta respectively ) which can not be measured at once .",
    "moreover , the multipole field is characterized by more quantum degrees of freedom than the plane waves of photons .",
    "in fact , the monochromatic pure @xmath6-pole multipole radiation of a given type ( either electric or magnetic ) is specified by the @xmath3 different values of the quantum number @xmath2 . since @xmath0 ,",
    "the total number of degrees of freedom here is not less than three . at the same time , the monochromatic plane waves of photons are described by only two different polarizations .",
    "in particular , the increase of the number of degrees of freedom can lead to an increase of the zero - point oscillations @xcite .",
    "the multipole generalization of the jaynes - cummings model has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "let us stress that similar models have been considered in different problems of interaction of quantum light with matter ( e.g. , see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the main objective of this paper is to examine the quantum properties of light emitted by a dipole atom at any distance from the source , depending on the boundary conditions .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows . in section 2",
    "we review the properties of quantum multipole field in comparison with these of plane waves of photons . in section 3",
    "we briefly discuss the multipole generalization of the jaynes - cummings model .",
    "then , in section 4 we consider the polarization of multipole radiation and introduce a novel general polarization matrix .",
    "this object permits us to take into account the spatial anisotrophy of both the electric and magnetic fields at once . in section 5",
    "we examine the spatial properties of multipole photons emitted by an atom in an ideal cavity as well as in empty space . in particular , we show that the polarization properties of quantum multipole radiation changes with distance from the atom . in section 6",
    "we briefly discuss the obtained results .",
    "following @xcite , we list below some important formulas describing the quantum multipole field . it is usually considered in the so - called helicity basis @xcite @xmath7 it is clear that @xmath8 formally coincides with the three eigenstates of spin @xmath9 of a photon . since the polarization is defined to be the spin state of photons @xcite , one can choose to interpret @xmath10 as the unit vector of circular polarization with either positive or negative helicity , while @xmath11 gives the linear polarization in the @xmath12-direction .",
    "to within the sign at @xmath10 the helicity basis ( 1 ) coincides with the so - called polarization basis usually used in optics @xcite . in the basis",
    "( 1 ) , the positive - frequency part of the operator vector potential of multipole field can be expanded as follows @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the photon annihilation operator which obeys the following commutation relations @xmath15= \\delta_{\\lambda \\lambda ' } \\delta_{kk ' } \\delta_{jj ' } \\delta_{mm'}. \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath16 is the wave vector , @xmath17 denotes the type of radiation ( parity ) , index @xmath0 gives the angular momentum , index @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is the annihilation operator of the corresponding photon .",
    "the mode functions @xmath20 in ( 2 ) are represented in the following way @xmath21 , \\nonumber \\\\",
    "v_{mkjm \\mu } & = & \\gamma_{mkj } f_j(kr ) \\langle 1,j , \\mu , m- \\mu |jm \\rangle y_{j , m- \\mu } ( \\theta , \\phi ) \\label{3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the electric and magnetic radiation respectively",
    ". here @xmath22 are the normalization constants , @xmath23 is the volume of quantization , @xmath24 denotes the clebsch - gordon coefficient of vector addition of the spin and orbital parts of the angular momentum of a multipole photon , and @xmath25 is the spherical harmonics .",
    "the radial contribution into the mode function ( 3 ) depends on the boundary conditions . in the standard case of quantization in terms of standing spherical waves in a spherical cavity @xcite",
    ", we have @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the spherical bessel function .",
    "the positive frequency parts of the operator field strengths obey the following relations @xmath28 it can be easily seen from ( 2 ) and ( 5 ) that the electric multipole field always has longitudinal component of the electric field strength in addition to the two transversal components , while it is completely transversal with respect to magnetic induction . at the same time , the magnetic multipole field has all three components of magnetic induction and only two transversal components of the electric field strength .",
    "the position dependence of the mode functions ( 3 ) is not an unusual fact . in reality",
    ", the mode functions of the plane waves also depend on position : @xmath29 here we choose the basis ( 1 ) with @xmath30 and @xmath31 denotes the photon annihilation operator , corresponding to the states with given linear momentum ( direction of propagation ) and transversal polarization with either helicity .",
    "the third projection of the photon spin is forbidden in this case @xcite .    to complete the discussion of the quantum multipole field , consider now the zero - point or vacuum oscillations . since the free - field hamiltonian has the form @xcite @xmath32 for the energy of the vacuum state in the whole volume of quantization we get @xmath33 for comparison , we show here well known expressions valid in the case of plane waves of photons ( 6 ) : @xmath34 due to the definition of @xmath16 , both expressions ( 7 ) and ( 8) give an infinite energy and , at first sight , can not be compared with each other . in fact , this infinity is inessential because of the following reason . the contribution of zero - point oscillations can be observed only via measurement which implies an averaging of physical quantities over a finite `` volume of detection '' and exposition time of detector @xcite .",
    "such an averaging plays a part of filtration leading to a selection of a certain finite transmission frequency band .",
    "it is therefore seen from ( 7 ) and ( 8) that , even if the filtration process leads to selection of the electric dipole photons only , the ratio of contributions of the zero - point oscillations of the multipole field and plane waves is equal to @xmath35 . from the physical point of view , this result is caused by the more number of quantum degrees of freedom in the case of multipole photons @xcite .",
    "much more interesting and important result can be obtained from consideration of the spatial properties of the zero - point oscillations . the energy density of the field is represented as follows @xmath36= \\frac{1}{16 \\pi } \\left\\ { [ { \\vec e}^+({\\vec r})+{\\vec e}({\\vec r})]^2+[{\\vec b}^+({\\vec r})+{\\vec b}({\\vec r})]^2 \\right\\ }",
    ". \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then , the zero - point contribution is @xmath37 consider first the case of plane waves . in view of ( 6 ) and",
    "symmetry relations @xmath38 , we get @xmath39 thus , the zero - point oscillations of the energy density of the plane waves of photons are homogeneous in the space of quantization in spite of the position dependence of the mode functions in ( 6 ) .    in turn , employing the relations ( 5 ) , we get @xmath40 in view of ( 3 ) , we obtain @xmath41 .",
    "\\label{12}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] taking into account that @xmath42 it is straightforward to show that the zero - point energy density of the multipole field is independent of the angular variables @xmath43 and @xmath44 , while depends on the distance from the origin ( the singular point corresponding to the source location ) : @xmath45 thus , the density of the zero - point oscillations of multipole field has the spherical symmetry with respect to the singular point ( atom ) , while manifests the radial dependence .",
    "taking into account the radial dependence ( 4 ) and making use of the following formula @xcite @xmath46 it is easy to prove that the multipole zero - point oscillations ( 12 ) vanish at far distance .",
    "thus , the vacuum fluctuations of the multipole field are concentrated near the atom .    further employing the properties of spherical bessel functions",
    "shows that the principal contribution into ( 12 ) at @xmath47 comes from the term with @xmath48 , corresponding to the electric dipole radiation .",
    "the radial dependence of ( 12 ) at fixed @xmath16 and @xmath49 is shown in figure 2 .",
    "it is seen that the zero - point oscillations of the multipole field are concentrated in some vicinity of the singular point where they strongly exceed the level ( 10 ) predicted within the framework of the representation of plane waves of photons . from the figure 2",
    ", the radius of the region of concentration of the zero - point oscillations can be estimated as follows : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the wavelength .",
    "thus , the atom condenses the zero - point oscillations in the near and intermediate zones .",
    "let us stress that in the number of modern experiments on engineered entanglement in the systems of trapped rydberg atoms , the interatomic distances are of the same order @xcite .",
    "the above result ( 13 ) should be considered as an estimation from below because it corresponds to the first term in ( 12 ) .",
    "successive taking into account of further terms leads to a certain shift of @xmath52 into the intermediate zone .",
    "the main aim of this section is to emphasize that the interaction between the photons and electrons on atomic sub - levels with the same @xmath6 and different @xmath2 is specified by a certain coupling constant independent of @xmath2 .",
    "consider a two - level atom with the electric dipole transition @xmath53 .",
    "the coupling constant of the atom - field interaction can be found by calculating the matrix element @xcite @xmath54 obtained from the expression @xmath55 describing the interaction between the atomic electron with linear momentum @xmath56 , charge @xmath57 , and mass @xmath58 and radiation field specified by the vector potential @xmath59 .",
    "here @xmath60 is the dipole moment of the atomic transition with the resonance frequency @xmath61 . assuming the central symmetry of atomic field and taking into account the fact that the spin state of an atom does not change under the electric dipole transition",
    ", we can represent the atomic states in ( 14 ) as follows @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the radial part of the atomic wave function of either excited ( @xmath57 ) or ground ( @xmath64 ) state .",
    "expanding the dipole moment @xmath65 over the helicity basis ( 1 ) , substituting ( 2 ) , and carrying out the calculations of integrals in ( 14 ) over a small volume occupied by the atom , for the coupling constant ( 14 ) we get @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the effective dipole factor which , by construction , is independent of the quantum number @xmath2 .",
    "taking into account the properties of the clebsch - gordon coefficients and spherical harmonics , for the position - dependent mode function in ( 2 ) we get @xmath68 this means that the electric dipole transition @xmath69 at any given @xmath2 creates a photon with helicity ( polarization ) @xmath70 .",
    "finally , the jaynes - cummings hamiltonian of the electric dipole transition in the rotating - wave approximation @xcite takes the form @xcite @xmath71 to simplify the notation , hereafter we omit insignificant indices . here",
    "the atomic operators are defined as usually @xcite in terms of the projections on the atomic states : @xmath72 the hamiltonian ( 16 ) describes the creation and absorption of the single cavity - mode photons _ at the atom location_. everywhere in the surrounding space , we have to take into account the spatial dependence of the radiation field described by the vector potential ( 2 ) .",
    "similar model can be constructed in the case of magnetic dipole radiation as well as in the case of other high - order atomic multipoles .",
    "it is known that the polarization defines the direction of oscillations of the field strengths . within the classical picture based on the consideration of plane waves ,",
    "the polarization is defined to be the measure of _ transversal _ anisotrophy of the electric field strength @xcite . in turn , the quantum mechanics interprets the polarization as given spin state of photons @xcite . in the usual approach ,",
    "the quantitative description of polarization is based either on the hermitian polarization matrix or on the equivalent set of real stokes parameters . in the standard case of plane waves ,",
    "we get the @xmath73 polarization matrix and four stokes parameters @xcite , while the description of multipole radiation requires for the @xmath74 polarization matrix and nine stokes parameters @xcite .",
    "moreover , the electric- and magnetic - type radiation fields are usually described in terms of different polarization matrices , taking into account the spatial anisotrophy @xcite .    here",
    "we construct a more general novel object , describing in a unique way the polarization properties of multipole radiation of either type both classical and quantum as well as these of the plane waves and other forms of electromagnetic radiation ( e.g. , of the cylindrical waves ) .",
    "in general , the field can be described in terms of the field - strength tensor which can be chosen as follows @xcite @xmath75 it seems to be tempting to introduce the general quantitative description of polarization using ( 17 ) .",
    "since the polarization is specified by the intensities of different spatial components of the radiation field and by the phase differences between these components @xcite , it should be described in terms of bilinear forms in the field strengths .",
    "the simplest bilinear form in the field - strength tensor is @xmath76 which differs from the energy - momentum tensor by a scalar . in some sense it is similar to the ricci tensor considered in the general relativity @xcite .",
    "it is easily seen that ( 18 ) has the following structure @xmath77 where @xmath78 is a scalar , @xmath79 , apart from an unimportant factor , coincides with the poynting vector , and @xmath80 is the hermitian @xmath81 matrix of the form @xmath82 here @xmath83 and @xmath84 we note here that ( 20 ) has been proposed in @xcite in order to describe the spatial anisotrophy of the electric dipole radiation , while ( 21 ) is similar to the object has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "we choose to interpret ( 19 ) as the general polarization matrix , while the terms ( 20 ) and ( 21 ) give the electric and magnetic field contributions respectively .    to justify this statement , consider first the case of plane waves propagating in the @xmath12-direction when @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "then , the matrix(20 ) takes the form @xmath87 it is seen that the non - zero submatrix in ( 22 ) coincides with conventional @xmath73 polarization matrix of plane waves @xcite . in turn ,",
    "( 21 ) takes the form @xmath88 where corresponding @xmath73 submatrix in the top left corner coincides with ( 22 ) .",
    "thus , the general polarization matrix ( 19 ) describes the polarization of plane waves adequately .",
    "consider now the multipole radiation . in the case of electric - type radiation",
    "when @xmath89 everywhere , the matrix @xmath90 has the general form ( 20 ) , while the magnetic polarization matrix ( 21 ) is reduced to @xmath91 the polarization of magnetic - type radiation is described by ( 20 ) with @xmath92 which coincides with ( 22 ) and by the general form ( 21 ) with @xmath93 . in this case , ( 21 ) coincides , within the transposition of lines and columns , with the polarization matrix considered in @xcite .",
    "it is natural that the general polarization matrix ( 19 ) reflects the three - dimensional structure of the radiation field .",
    "the diagonal terms in ( 20 ) and ( 21 ) give the radiation intensities .",
    "their angular and radial dependence corresponds to the radiation patterns of the multipole field .",
    "the off - diagonal terms give the phase information as in the case of plane waves @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the standard case of plane waves , there are the two independent phase differences @xmath94 instead of only one phase difference because @xmath95 since @xmath96 at any point , the magnetic part ( 21 ) of the general polarization matrix ( 19 ) contains the same phase differences as ( 20 ) .",
    "similar expressions for the polarization matrix ( 19 ) can also be obtained in the helicity basis ( 1 ) .",
    "for example , the matrix ( 20 ) takes the form @xmath97 the quantum counterpart of ( 19 ) can be obtained by formal substitution of the operators instead of the classical field strengths ( compare with @xcite ) .",
    "averaging of the corresponding operator matrix over a given state of the radiation field gives the polarization matrix . by construction , the operator matrices ( 19)-(24 )",
    "correspond to the normal ordering in the creation and annihilation operators : @xmath98 in addition , one can define the anti - normal polarization matrix @xmath99 by a simple change of order of product of the field strengths in all elements of the matrices ( 19)-(24 ) .",
    "it is then clear that the matrix @xmath100)= \\langle 0|p^{(an)}|0 \\rangle \\equiv p_{vac } \\label{26}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] determines the zero - point ( vacuum ) contribution into the polarization .",
    "following the ideas and results of section 2 , it is a straightforward matter to show that the vacuum polarization of plane waves of photons is uniform in the space , while the multipole vacuum polarization concentrates near the atom and exceeds the level predicted by the representation of plane waves .",
    "it was shown in section 3 that an atomic electric dipole transition with given @xmath2 emits the photon with given polarization @xmath101 .",
    "we now show that the polarization changes with the distance from the source .",
    "in other words , the polarization is not a global property of the field , while changes from point to point , at least in the case of multipole radiation .",
    "assume , for example , that the atom emits the electric dipole photon with @xmath102 , i.e. circularly polarized with positive helicity .",
    "consider the polar direction @xmath103 , corresponding to the maximum of the radiation pattern in this case @xcite .",
    "then , the matrix ( 25 ) averaged over the photon state @xmath104 takes the form @xmath105 ^ 2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{array } \\right ) \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , there is only one polarization @xmath106 in the polar direction . in the less probable case of the equatorial direction @xmath107 , from ( 25 )",
    "we get @xmath108 ^ 2 & 0 & \\frac{-3}{4 } j_{2}(kr ) [ \\frac{1}{4 } j_{2}(kr)+j_{0}(kr)]e^{2i \\phi } \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ \\frac{-3}{4 } j_{2}(kr ) [ \\frac{1}{4 } j_{2}(kr)+j_{0}(kr)]e^{-2i \\phi } & 0 & \\frac{9}{16 } [ j_{2}(kr)]^2 \\end{array } \\right ) \\label{27}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so that there are the two circularly polarized components with opposite helicities .",
    "comparison of intensities of the two components shows that the positive helicity dominates at short distances ( @xmath109 ) , while both components contribute equally at far distances ( @xmath110 ) ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "it is clear that any deviation from the polar direction leads to creation of polarizations additional to @xmath106 .",
    "thus , the polarization o radiation under consideration strongly depends on the direction and distance from the source .",
    "similar picture can be obtained for polarization of photons with @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "the above results were obtained in the case of standing waves in an ideal spherical cavity when the radial dependence of the mode functions ( 3 ) is specified by equation ( 4 ) . in this case , the radiation field is subjected to the rabi oscillations which can be described through the use of the steady - state time dependent wave function for the system with hamiltonian ( 16 ) : @xmath113 where we choose the initial state as the vacuum state of the cavity field and excited state of the atom is specified by given @xmath2 .",
    "then , the elements of the polarization matrix ( 19 ) obtained by averaging or corresponding operator matrix over the state ( 28 ) should be multiplied by an additional factor of @xmath114 , describing the steady - state time dependence of polarization .",
    "consider now the radiation by a dipole atom in empty space .",
    "then , the hamiltonian ( 16 ) should be generalized as follows @xmath115 to take into account the @xmath16-dependence of the radiation field .",
    "let us again choose the initial state as the vacuum state of photons and excited atomic state with given @xmath2 @xmath116 .",
    "\\label{30}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is then clear that the radiation field is represented by the outgoing spherical waves of photons which stipulates the choice of the radial dependence in ( 3 ) in terms of the spherical hankel function of the first kind @xmath117 instead of ( 4 ) @xcite .",
    "this choice assumes that the atom occupies a small but finite spherical volume of radius @xmath118 at the origin to avoid the divergence at @xmath119 .",
    "the elements of the polarization matrix ( 25 ) of the electric dipole radiation in the equatorial direction take the form @xmath120 ^ 2 + [ \\gamma_- ( kr ) ] ^2 \\right\\ } , \\nonumber \\\\ e_-^+e_- & = & \\frac { \\hbar \\omega}{3v } \\frac{9}{16 } \\left\\ { [ j_{2}(kr)]^2+[j_{-3}(kr)]^2 \\right\\ } , \\nonumber \\\\ e^+_+e_- & = & \\frac{-\\hbar \\omega}{4v } \\ { [ j_2(kr)\\gamma_+ ( kr)+ j_{-3}(kr)\\gamma_- ( kr)]^2 \\nonumber \\\\ & + & [ j_{2}(kr)\\gamma_-(kr)-j_{-3}(kr)\\gamma_+(kr)]^2\\}^{1/2 } e^{i \\varphi } , \\label{32}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath121 and @xmath122 all elements containing @xmath123 are equal to zero .",
    "unlike the case of radiation in an ideal cavity ( 27 ) , the phase difference @xmath124 between the components with opposite helicity depends here on the distance from the source .",
    "other cases can be examined in the same way .    for the polarization matrix ( 25 ) in the polar direction , we again get only one non - zero element @xmath125 ^ 2 + [ \\xi_- ( kr)]^2 \\right\\ } , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath126 the time evolution can be described with the aid of approach proposed in @xcite .",
    "then , the matrix elements of the polarization matrix should be multiplied by the following factor @xmath127 + e^{- \\eta t } , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath128 and @xmath129 denotes the principle value of corresponding integral .",
    "again , any deviation from the polar direction changes the picture of polarization at intermediate and far distances with respect to that at the atom location .",
    "let us briefly discuss the obtained results . in this paper",
    "we have concentrated on the description of the spatial properties of multipole radiation by a single atom .",
    "the consideration is based on sequential use of the representation of multipole photons corresponding to the radiation of real atoms .",
    "it is shown that the zero - point oscillations of the multipole field are concentrated near the atom , while exceed the level predicted by the model of plane waves of photons everywhere . in a certain neighborhood of the atom ,",
    "the effect is strong enough .",
    "although the effect can be observed at the relatively short distances , it seems to be important for the near- and intermediate - field quantum optics as well as for the experiments with trapped rydberg atoms when the typical interatomic distances are of the same order @xcite . in particular",
    ", it can be important for engineered entanglement in the system of two atoms in a cavity proposed in @xcite , for experiments with single - atom laser as well as for the estimation of casimir effect in atomic systems .",
    "let us note in this connection that possible influence of an atom on the electromagnetic vacuum state in the absence of radiation has been discussed in quantum electrodynamics for a long time ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "the new element here is the spatial inhomogeneity of the vacuum noise . unlike the effects discussed in @xcite , the specific distance dependence of the zero - point oscillations in the presence of atom has the geometrical nature and is independent of the atom - field interaction .    to describe the polarization of multipole field",
    ", we proposed in section 4 a new definition of the polarization matrix based on the bilinear form in the field - strength tensor .",
    "the generalized polarization matrix ( 19 ) is additive with respect to the contributions coming from the electric field and magnetic induction .",
    "it reflects the three - dimensional nature of polarization connected with the three possible states of spin of photon .",
    "in special case of plane waves , when the third spin state is forbidden , it reduces to the conventional @xmath73 hermitian polarization matrix . in the case of multipole radiation",
    ", it combines together the objects considered earlier in @xcite .    by construction ,",
    "the generalized operator polarization matrix is a local object in spite of the global nature of the photon operators of creation and annihilation .",
    "the spatial properties of polarization are caused by the mode functions and changes with distance and direction from the source .",
    "for example , the electric dipole radiation from the excited atomic level with @xmath102 , corresponding to the creation of a circularly polarized photon with positive helicity , is transformed , at far distances , into the radiation with both helicities . in the case of radiation in empty space , the phase difference between the modes with opposite helicities is also a function of distance and direction from the source .",
    "both the distance and direction dependence of the polarization seems to be very important .",
    "in fact , any real measurement of intensity assumes the finite aperture of a detecting device @xcite .",
    "this means that , in the case of radiation by the atomic transition @xmath130 considered in section 5 , the precision of measurement of the polarization @xmath106 in the polar direction would be influenced by the zero - point oscillations of all three polarizations .",
    "let us stress that locality of polarization discussed in this paper can also be interpreted in terms of the photon localization .",
    "it is well known that , while the photon operators of creation and annihilation are defined in the whole space at once , the notion of photon localization is not deprived of physical meaning @xcite .",
    "the photodetection process provides a quite certain example of the photon localization @xcite .",
    "there are also known attempts to interpret the photon localization as the specific fall - off of the photon energy density @xcite .",
    "it is also clear that emission and absorption of radiation by atoms can also be interpreted as the photon localization @xcite .",
    "our results based on consideration of the representation of multipole photons shows the rapid fall - off of the density of zero - point oscillations and of the vacuum noise of polarization with the distance from atom as well as the spatial dependence of a certain characteristics of the radiation field ( e.g. , polarization ) .",
