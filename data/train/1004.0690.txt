    "it is believed that all forms of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are variations of the same phenomenon , namely accreting supermassive black holes @xcite .",
    "the most basic observational description of agn is their bolometric luminosity , @xmath5 , and the obscuring column density , @xmath6 , through which they are observed .",
    "agn are known to radiate at luminosities @xmath7 10@xmath810@xmath9 erg s@xmath10 , but this is more physically described by the eddington ratio , defined as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the eddington luminosity of a black hole with mass @xmath13 . observed eddington ratios range roughly ten orders of magnitude with a maximum of @xmath141 @xcite .",
    "there is a similarly wide range of observed column densities ( @xmath15 ; e.g. , tueller et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "the most widely accepted theory to explain the observed range of obscuration is known as the unified model and claims that the obscuration of an agn is dependent solely on the orientation of the agn with respect to the line of sight to the observer ( e.g. , antonucci 1993 ) .",
    "however , there is evidence that suggests that compton thick ( ct ) obscuration , when @xmath16 , is linked to an evolutionary phase during which the black hole and the host stellar spheroid accrete rapidly ( e.g. , fabian 1999 ; page et al . 2004 ; rigopoulou et al .",
    "as the black hole grows , the outflow from the black hole strengthens and ejects the obscuring material , revealing an unobscured quasar .",
    "this outflow also halts the growth of the host spheroid causing the observed proportionality between black hole mass and host spheroid mass ( e.g. , crenshaw et al .",
    "2003 ; page et al . 2004",
    "; alexander et al . 2010 ) .",
    "galaxy merger simulations show that mergers between gas rich galaxies will cause gas to flow into the nuclear region , igniting a nuclear starburst and highly obscured , high eddington ratio quasar activity ( e.g. , hopkins et al .",
    "@xcite also show that if an agn is accreting at close to eddington , radiation pressure on dust will blow out any column density with @xmath17 . therefore , if an agn is obscured and has a high eddington ratio , it must be ct .",
    "observational evidence also supports this evolutionary scenario .",
    "@xcite found that star formation in the hosts of unobscured quasars has already peaked , whereas the hosts of obscured quasars are still undergoing massive amounts of star formation indicating that their galactic spheroids are still forming .",
    "@xcite found that the space density of luminous ct agn candidates evolves strongly at @xmath18 1.52.5 , so that the ct quasar population seems to peak at a slightly higher redshift than the population of unobscured quasars .",
    "this evolutionary theory is difficult to observationally test since the high levels of obscuration found in ct agn make them nearly invisible below 10 kev in their rest - frame .",
    "if being ct is an early evolutionary phase of powerful quasars , ct agn should be very rare at @xmath19 ; however , _",
    "swift_/bat and _ integral _ have detected several ct agn at @xmath20 ( tueller et al .",
    "2008 ; malizia et al .",
    "according to black hole masses and x - ray luminosities reported by @xcite , the two brightest ct agn , the circinus galaxy and ngc 4945 , have @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively , where @xmath23 .",
    "therefore the scenario where ct agn are high eddington ratio quasars does not completely describe the entire ct agn population .    as the majority of the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) @xmath24 10 kev has been resolved into agn by deep observations by _ rosat _ , _ chandra _ , and xmm-_newton _ ( see brandt & hasinger 2005 ) , the cxb provides a complete census of agn . due to the observational constraints of highly obscured sources , ct agn are difficult to study even in the local universe ; thus , historically ct agn have been invoked to augment the observed agn population in population synthesis models to make these models properly fit the observed , but not resolved , peak of the cxb around 30 kev . as there is a dearth of observational information about ct agn",
    ", previous population synthesis models have treated ct agn as a simple extension of type 2 agn ( e.g. , ueda et al . 2003 ; treister & urry 2005 ; ballantyne et al .",
    "2006 ; gilli et al .",
    "2007 ) ; however , if ct agn are part of an evolutionary sequence , then they would not evolve in the same manner as the less extremely obscured type 2 agn .",
    "indeed , fitting the cxb in that manner seems to overpredict the local observed space density of ct agn ( see treister et al .",
    "2009a ) .    in this letter , we compute the contributions of agn with various eddington ratios to the cxb and model ct agn using a physically motivated eddington ratio distribution .",
    "we then compare our model predictions with observed cumulative and decadal space densities and the _ swift_/bat ct @xmath0@xmath1 relation .",
    "we find that ct agn are a composite population of agn accreting at both very high eddington ratios and very low eddington ratios .",
    "when necessary , a @xmath25cdm cosmology is assumed with @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 .",
    "following the method of @xcite and @xcite , with minor modifications described below , we calculate the eddington ratio space density , @xmath29 , in mpc@xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the 210 kev luminosity .",
    "the bolometric correction from @xcite , @xmath32 where @xmath33 , is used to transform x - ray luminosities to bolometric luminosities . @xcite derive this bolometric correction using an average intrinsic spectral energy distribution template for radio quiet agn .",
    "the scatter in the bolometric correction is @xmath140.1 dex , which is negligible in our analysis .",
    "the black hole mass function ( bhmf ) is derived from a gaussian curve fit to the combined type 1 and type 2 agn bhmf observed by @xcite at @xmath34 . as the @xcite bhmf is fractional ,",
    "the @xcite and @xcite method was modified to use only the space density from the @xcite hard x - ray luminosity function ( hxlf ) , instead of depending equally on the space density from the bhmf and the hxlf .",
    "@xcite argue that black hole mergers will only have a perturbative effect on black hole growth as the uncertainties in the agn bolometric luminosity function are larger than the impact of black hole mergers on the local bhmf .",
    "therefore , the evolution of the bhmf must satisfy the conservation equation ( small & blandford 1992 ) : @xmath35}{\\partial m}=0 , \\label{eq : coneq}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the bhmf and @xmath37 is the average accretion rate at time @xmath38 .",
    "thus the bhmf is evolved by integrating this conservation equation forward and backward in time , using the observed bhmf at z  0.15 as the boundary condition .",
    "the critical eddington ratio where the transition from radiatively efficient thin disk accretion to radiatively inefficient geometrically thick accretion is taken as @xmath39 @xcite . for @xmath40 the radiative efficiency",
    "is assumed to be @xmath41 and for @xmath42 , @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "the cxb model closely follows that described by @xcite with differences in the spectra of ct sources and low eddington ratio sources , and @xmath44 is input in place of a luminosity function . a torus reflection component , calculated using `` reflion '' @xcite , is added to the ct agn spectrum ( cf .",
    ", gilli et al . 2007 ) . for agn with @xmath45 , the reflection component",
    "is included only if the source is ct . in order to properly fit the cxb at higher energies , the power - law component of the @xmath45 spectrum is assumed to have a cut - off energy of 200 kev , otherwise a cut - off energy of 250 kev is used1@xmath3 . ] .",
    "most importantly , ct agn are added at specific eddington ratios which are chosen based on a physically motivated scenario instead of adjusting the normalization of the luminosity function to account for ct agn as done with previous cxb models .",
    "in previous population synthesis models the number of ct agn was assumed to be proportional to the number of type 2 agn . in this original model",
    "we find 44@xmath3 of all type 2 agn are ct , where the normalization is fixed by fitting the peak of the cxb ( @xmath46 44.2 kev @xmath47 s@xmath10 str@xmath10 at 30 kev ) . in figure",

    "the red circle shows the local _ swift_/bat and integral data originally reported by @xcite and here has been corrected to account for the flux - luminosity relation for ct agn described by @xcite .",
    "the original model significantly overpredicts the observed space density of ct agn with @xmath48 at all redshifts",
    ". the original model also overpredicts the observed space density of ct agn with @xmath49 at @xmath50 , while underpredicting the @xmath51 data points .",
    "the decadal ct agn space density is shown in figure [ fig : dec ] where data and predictions for ct agn with @xmath52 = 4445 are colored blue , and data and predictions for ct agn with @xmath52 = 4546 are colored green .",
    "the dashed lines again show the predictions of the original model .",
    "this model agrees fairly well with the @xmath52 = 4445 and @xmath52 = 4546 data at low redshift , but underpredicts the density of high redshift sources .",
    "as seen in figure [ fig : bat ] , the original model agrees fairly well with the _",
    "swift_/bat @xmath0@xmath1 relation , where red lines denote the transmission dominated ct agn number counts and dashed lines denote the original model .",
    "this model overpredicts the bat number counts at the lowest flux levels but is in decent agreement with observations at the higher flux levels .",
    "a @xmath53 test was performed using the cumulative ct space density data points , the decadal ct space density data points which are not lower limits , and the bat ct agn number counts data points , giving 32 degrees of freedom .",
    "the original model was found to have a reduced @xmath53 of @xmath54 .",
    "we then attempted to model the ct population as only including sources with @xmath55 independent of the fraction of type 2 agn at any @xmath31 and @xmath56 . in order to match the peak of the cxb , @xmath1491@xmath3 of these agn at any time",
    "must be ct . as seen in figures [ fig : cum ] , [ fig : dec ] , and [ fig : bat ] , where the predictions from this model are shown as the dot - dashed lines , this scenario underpredicted the observed local ct agn space densities , overpredicted the _",
    "swift_/bat @xmath0@xmath1 relation by a factor of 2.0 to 3.5 , and resulted in @xmath57 .",
    "thus , the ct population can not be modeled as only including sources with very high eddington ratios .",
    "the scenario where all ct agn have @xmath55 failed to agree with local observations , and as local agn are known to have low eddington ratios @xcite , low eddington ratio sources were then added to the ct agn population model . in order to fit the peak of the cxb , while not overestimating the cxb in the 100200 kev range , this composite model predicts @xmath1460@xmath3 of agn with @xmath58 and @xmath1486@xmath3 of agn with @xmath55 , at any time and independent of the fraction of type 2 agn , are ct .",
    "the cxb fit found using this composite model is shown in figure [ fig : edd ] with the contribution made by agn accreting at different eddington ratios plotted as separate lines . in this model",
    "the cxb is still dominated by obscured sources accreting at moderate eddington ratios , i.e. type 2 seyferts .",
    "the composite model predictions are shown as the colored solid lines in figures [ fig : cum ] , [ fig : dec ] , and [ fig : bat ] .",
    "this model is in fairly good agreement with the observed space densities for ct agn with @xmath48 and @xmath49 , except for overpredicting the observed space density of ct agn with @xmath49 at @xmath50 .",
    "the composite model predictions match the observed cumulative space densities better than the original model predictions . at @xmath59 , the composite model",
    "slightly overpredicts the space density of ct agn with @xmath52 = 4445 and underpredicts the observed densities at @xmath60 . for ct agn with @xmath52 = 4546",
    ", this scenario agrees fairly well with observations . in general , the composite model is a better fit to the high luminosity , high redshift data than the original model .",
    "this scenario does overpredict the bat number counts at the lowest flux levels , but is in decent agreement with observations at the higher flux levels .",
    "we find @xmath61 , indicating that the composite model is in better overall agreement with the observed ct agn space densities and the _ swift_/bat @xmath0@xmath1 relation when compared to the original model , or one where all ct agn have @xmath55 .",
    "other models were investigated in which the ct population was assumed to be accreting at only low or moderate eddington ratios .",
    "when the ct population was assumed to all be accreting at @xmath45 the model underpredicted the observed high luminosity ct space densities and slightly underpredicted the _",
    "swift_/bat @xmath0@xmath1 relation . when @xmath62 accretion was assumed for the ct population the model overpredicted the observed local space density by a factor of 3.2 and",
    "significantly overpredicted the _",
    "swift_/bat @xmath0@xmath1 relation . in conclusion",
    ", it is necessary to include both sources with @xmath45 and @xmath55 to model the ct agn population .",
    "we find that current data suggests that the majority of agn accreting at close to the eddington limit are ct , in agreement with galaxy merger simulations ( e.g. , hopkins et al .",
    "2006 ) that show that mergers funnel gas into the central regions of galaxies igniting both starbursts and high eddington ratio accretion onto the central black hole .",
    "these agn are able to accrete rapidly because of a large abundance of gas and dust in the central region of the host bulge .",
    "this abundance of gas and dust naturally leads to a very high obscuring column density @xcite .",
    "furthermore , radiation pressure from a rapidly accreting agn will blow out any dusty gas with @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "thus , in accordance with our findings , the vast majority of rapidly accreting , obscured agn must be ct .",
    "a new result is that the ct agn population , in addition to including sources with @xmath55 , also includes sources with @xmath63 .",
    "while @xcite explains that most observed low eddington ratio sources tend to be unobscured , @xcite find evidence for a population of highly obscured low eddington ratio agn .",
    "indeed @xcite find an obscuration - luminosity relation in their sample of _ integral _ sources which claims that lower luminosity sources tend to be more obscured . as these observed lower luminosity sources are local , these agn are likely to have low eddington ratios .",
    "since low eddington ratio agn are only weakly accreting , they will have very little effect on their environment .",
    "therefore molecular clouds would be able to come deep into the core of the bulge without being affected .",
    "indeed @xcite find that the highly obscured low eddington ratio sources in their sample might exhibit variable obscuration , as would be expected if the obscuration were due to molecular clouds near the black hole .",
    "several studies have been conducted on so called changing - look agn ( see bianchi et al . 2005 and references therein ) , which are agn whose spectrum changes from compton thin to reflection dominated on the time scale of years .",
    "it is believed that the changes in the spectrum of these local , low luminosity agn is due to either the nucleus being obstructed by a cloud with a ct column density or the nucleus switching off , so that the reflection dominated state is actually the echo of a previous accretion episode .",
    "@xcite find that it is most likely that the four agn in their sample are in ct states . in a study of 82 liners ,",
    "@xcite find about half of the liners in their sample appear to be ct and that there is a higher percentage of ct liners than ct seyferts .",
    "the average eddington ratio of the ct liners in the sample used by @xcite is @xmath64 -4.7 .",
    "this finding is consistent with the composite model for ct agn discussed here which finds that @xmath1460@xmath3 of agn with @xmath65 are ct .",
    "it is clear that previous attempts to model the elusive ct agn population as an extension of the compton thin type 2 population fail to explain the observed ct agn space density and @xmath0@xmath1 relation .",
    "@xcite suggest that ct agn only contribute @xmath1410@xmath3 of the cxb and that the normalization of the cxb is overestimated by population synthesis models which predict a large population of ct agn .",
    "however , changing the normalization of the cxb does not account for the strong evolution of ct agn at @xmath18 1.52.5 found by @xcite . here",
    "we assume that ct agn contribute @xmath1420@xmath3 of the cxb based on the findings of @xcite , but the composite model presented here does account for the strong evolution of ct agn at high redshift while not overestimating the local ct agn space density .",
    "additionally , models which include ct sources with @xmath62 overpredict locally observed ct agn space density .",
    "models which only include ct sources with @xmath45 underpredict the density of high luminosity ct sources . if ct sources are assumed to only have @xmath66 , the model overpredicts the observed @xmath0@xmath1 relation . a composite model , where the ct agn population includes both sources accreting at close to eddington and sources accreting at @xmath41@xmath3 of eddington , best explains observations .    as ct agn are rare and difficult to observe due to high obscuration , it is difficult to use observations to directly decipher the physical phenomenon which gives rise to the extreme levels of obscuration found in ct agn ( e.g. , triester et al .",
    "2009b ; rigby et al .",
    "thus physical models of ct agn must use indirect observational constraints , like observed space densities and number counts , to uncover the nature of the extreme obscuration of these sources .",
    "this letter presents a model which constrains the physical parameter of the eddington ratios of ct agn to @xmath6790@xmath3 and @xmath241@xmath3 . in the future",
    "the understanding of ct agn will be expanded through ir and sub - mm studies of the reprocessed radiation from ct agn and very hard x - ray imaging with missions like _",
