    "in @xcite lott , sturm and villani proposed a definition of ricci curvature lower bounds in metric measure spaces .",
    "the definitions were in terms of convexity properties of functionals in the space of probability measures .",
    "the most relevant definition in the context of this paper is the @xmath8 condition , with @xmath9 taking the place of a lower bound on the curvature , which is usually denoted by @xmath0 in the more general definition ( @xmath10 here means non negative ricci curvature ) , and @xmath11 being the upper bound on the dimension of the space .",
    "the @xmath8 condition on a metric measure space @xmath12 requires that between any two probability measures on the space there exists at least one geodesic along which the entropy @xmath13 is convex for all @xmath14 .",
    "( see section [ sec : preli ] for more details . )",
    "soon after the definition of @xmath8 had been introduced it was noticed that @xmath15 equipped with any norm and with the lebesgue measure satisfies @xmath16 .",
    "see the end of villani s book @xcite for an outline of the proof of this fact .",
    "in particular we have :    [ thm : cd02maps ] the space @xmath17 satisfies @xmath18 .",
    "a problematic feature of spaces like @xmath17 is that between most of the points there exist a huge number of geodesics joining them .",
    "in particular , there are a lot of branching geodesics .",
    "initially many results for @xmath3 spaces were proven under the assumption that there are no branching geodesics . later some of these results have been proven without such assumption ( for instance local poincar inequalities @xcite ) . in some results",
    "the general case with branching geodesics remains open .",
    "branching geodesics are also known to exist , for example , in some positively curved @xmath3 spaces , see the recent paper by ohta @xcite .    until now",
    "one of the basic open questions for general @xmath3 spaces was the local - to - global property of the @xmath3 condition .",
    "it is known that under the non branching assumption assuming @xmath8 ( or @xmath19 or @xmath20 ) to hold locally ( i.e. in a neighbourhood of any point ) is the same as assuming it to hold globally . for @xmath19",
    "this was proven by sturm @xcite , for @xmath8 by villani @xcite , and for @xmath21 by bacher and sturm @xcite .",
    "such property is natural to expect from an abstract notion of ricci curvature lower bounds - after all , the classical definition is local .",
    "the notion @xmath20 refers to the reduced curvature - dimension condition .",
    "it is not ( at least a priori ) as restrictive as the @xmath3 condition , but it is more natural in the local - to - global questions .    -norm . on the right",
    "we have the extremal case when we go around a corner . in this case",
    "we have to squeeze the measure a bit.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    in this paper we show that not even @xmath8 does , in general , have the local - to - global property .",
    "the idea of our example showing that local @xmath8 does not imply global @xmath8 is surprisingly simple .",
    "one starts with the observation , which we already mentioned , that @xmath22 has lots of geodesics .",
    "there are even so many geodesics that one can go around some euclidean corners with them .",
    "therefore we at least have domains in @xmath4 that are not convex in the euclidean sense but still ( weakly ) geodesically convex with the @xmath5-norm .",
    "next we observe that we can locally move two identical objects around a corner , see the left picture in figure [ fig : idea ] .",
    "this roughly means that moving measures that are approximately the same should not be a problem in view of the local @xmath18 condition .    for more general sets the @xmath23 degree angle gives the extremal case when going around a corner .",
    "see the right picture in figure [ fig : idea ] for the extremal case .",
    "there we have to shrink the measure in the vertical direction when we move it around the corner .",
    "this suggests that we have to give up our hope on @xmath18 .",
    "still the particular transport seems to satisfy @xmath2 , for instance .",
    "however , when we take thinner and thinner strips closer and closer to the corner we notice that the estimates do not scale property .",
    "an obvious idea to correct this is to smoothen the corner , and in fact replacing the corner with a piece of a circle will do :    [ ex:1 ] let @xmath0 and @xmath1 $ ] .",
    "there exists a compact geodesic metric measure space @xmath12 satisfying @xmath2 locally , but failing to satisfy @xmath20 ( and @xmath3 ) globally .",
    "take @xmath24 to be the closed subset of @xmath4 shown in figure [ fig : example ] .",
    "( we shall specify it more carefully in section [ sec : verify ] . ) as the distance take @xmath25 and as the reference measure the restriction of the lebesgue measure @xmath26 .     of example [ ex:1 ] as a compact subset of @xmath4 with the @xmath5-norm .",
    "the space satisfies @xmath2 locally , but not globally.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    we note that if in example [ ex:1 ] we were to drop either the requirement that @xmath27 is complete or the requirement that it is geodesic the example would be close to trivial .",
    "however , with both of these assumptions in place , if we want to get the example as a subset of @xmath4 , we are forced to consider optimal transport at and near the boundary of a non convex set . verifying the @xmath2 condition at the boundary turned out to require some calculations .",
    "indeed , proving that @xmath12 locally satisfies @xmath2 takes most of this paper whereas the failure of global @xmath20 follows immediately by considering optimal transport between measures with large supports on the opposite sides of the neck. gluing together infinitely many spaces of the type shown in example [ ex:1 ] gives a ( non compact ) complete geodesic metric measure space satisfying @xmath2 locally but failing the global @xmath3 for any @xmath0 and @xmath1 $ ] .",
    "although @xmath3 ( and @xmath20 ) fails to have the local - to - global property , the more recent definition of riemannian ricci curvature bounds by ambrosio , gigli and savar @xcite ( see also @xcite for some generalization and simplifications and @xcite for the finite dimensional definitions ) , @xmath28 for short , could still have the local - to - global property .",
    "the fact that @xmath28 spaces are essentially non branching and there exist optimal maps from absolutely continuous measures @xcite strongly supports this conjecture",

    "the author also acknowledges the financial support of the academy of finland project no .",
    "in this paper the norm we mostly use is the @xmath5-norm and hence we sometimes abbreviate @xmath29 .",
    "we denote the euclidean norm in @xmath30 by @xmath31 .",
    "we will give here only a few facts about optimal mass transportation .",
    "for a more detailed introduction we refer to the books by villani @xcite and by ambrosio and gigli @xcite .",

    "our example @xmath24 is compact and thus for it we have @xmath34 .",
    "however , in general the measures with finite second moment are considered in order to have finite @xmath35-distance between the measures ( see below for the definition of the distance @xmath35 ) .    given two probability measures @xmath36 and a borel cost function @xmath37 $ ] the optimal mass transportation problem is to minimize @xmath38 among all @xmath39 with @xmath40 and @xmath41 as the first and the second marginal .    in the definition of the ricci curvature",
    "lower bounds we will use the quadratic transportation distance @xmath42 , which is given by the cost function @xmath43 . in other words , for @xmath44 it is defined by @xmath45 where again the infimum is taken over all @xmath39 with @xmath40 and @xmath41 as the first and the second marginal . assuming the space @xmath27 to be geodesic , also the space @xmath46 is geodesic .",
    "we denote by @xmath47 the space of ( constant speed minimizing ) geodesics on @xmath27 .",
    "the notation @xmath48 , @xmath49 $ ] is used for the evaluation maps defined by @xmath50 .",
    "a useful fact is that any geodesic @xmath51 can be lifted to a measure @xmath52 , so that @xmath53 for all @xmath54 $ ] .",

    "a property of optimal transport plans that we will frequently use is cyclical monotonicity .",
    "it holds in a great generality , and in particular in the minimization problems we are considering in this paper .",
    "a set @xmath58 is called @xmath59-cyclically monotone if for any @xmath60 and @xmath61 we have @xmath62 with the identification @xmath63 .",
    "now , given @xmath64 and an optimal transport plan @xmath65 minimizing there exists a @xmath59-cyclically monotone subset @xmath66 with full @xmath65-measure .",
    "we will define here the @xmath20 condition , coming from the paper by bacher and sturm @xcite , and not the @xmath3 condition .",
    "the reason for this is that in the non branching case the @xmath20 condition has the local - to - global property .",
    "moreover , for @xmath67 and @xmath68 we have @xmath69 for the proof of this and for a more detailed discussion of the relation with @xmath20 and @xmath3 we refer to @xcite ( see also the papers by cavalletti and sturm @xcite and by cavalletti @xcite ) .",
    "since we show that our example fails @xmath19 , it will also fail @xmath3 and @xmath20 for all @xmath7 .",

    "we say that a complete geodesic metric measure space @xmath12 satisfies the @xmath20 condition if for any two measures @xmath74 with support bounded and contained in @xmath75 there exists a measure @xmath76 such that for every @xmath54 $ ] and @xmath77 we have @xmath78 where for any @xmath49 $ ] we have written @xmath79 with @xmath80 .",
    "what is different in the @xmath3 definition is the choice of the weights @xmath81 . in the particular case @xmath10 the @xmath82 condition is the same as the @xmath8 one .",
    "we will in fact only need to show that our example fails the @xmath19 condition . for defining the @xmath19 condition we will need the entropy @xmath83 if @xmath84 is absolutely continuous with respect to @xmath85 and @xmath86 otherwise .",
    "we say that a metric measure space @xmath12 satisfies the @xmath19 condition if for any two measures @xmath74 with support bounded and contained in @xmath75 there exists a measure @xmath76 such that for every @xmath54 $ ] we have @xmath87 where we have written @xmath88 .",
    "a complete geodesic metric measure space @xmath12 is said to satisfy @xmath20 locally if for any @xmath89 there exists a radius @xmath90 so that for any @xmath74 with supports in @xmath91 there is a measure @xmath76 such that for every @xmath54 $ ] and @xmath77 we have .      given two absolutely continuous measures @xmath92 and an optimal map @xmath93 pushing @xmath40 to @xmath41 , our aim is to express the density @xmath94 of @xmath41 using the density @xmath95 of @xmath40 and the mapping @xmath96 .",
    "assuming @xmath96 to be one - to - one and smooth , this expression is the standard jacobian equation @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the absolute value of the jacobian determinant of @xmath96 .",
    "a way to relax the assumptions on @xmath96 to be one - to - one and smooth is to require it to be one - to - one almost everywhere and approximately differentiable , see for instance the book by ambrosio , gigli and savar ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 5.5.3 ) for a precise statement .",
    "recall that a mapping @xmath99 , @xmath100 open , is called _ approximately differentiable at _",
    "@xmath101 if there exists a measurable function @xmath102 which is differentiable at @xmath103 and for which @xmath104 the approximate differential of @xmath105 at @xmath103 is defined to be that of @xmath106 at @xmath103",
    ". correspondingly we define the approximate partial derivatives ( of the components ) , denoted simply by @xmath107 .",
    "approximate differentiability for @xmath96 would follow from the almost everywhere existence of approximate partial derivatives , see federer s book ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.1.4 ) .",
    "however , our mapping will not in general have approximate partial derivatives in all the directions .",
    "due to the special structure of our optimal maps the following easy version will suffice . in the proposition below , and later on , we write the components of a map @xmath108 as @xmath109 and @xmath110 . in other words",
    "@xmath111 .",
    "[ prop : appjac ] let @xmath92 be absolutely continuous with respect to @xmath112 with densities @xmath95 and @xmath94 , respectively , and let @xmath108 be a map such that @xmath113 and @xmath105 is one - to - one outside a set of measure zero .",
    "suppose that @xmath114 , i.e. @xmath109 does not depend on @xmath115 .",
    "suppose also that @xmath109 is increasing in @xmath103 and that @xmath116 is increasing in @xmath115 for almost every @xmath117",
    ". then holds with @xmath118 .    because @xmath119 is increasing in @xmath103 and @xmath116 is increasing in @xmath115 for almost every @xmath103",
    ", @xmath109 is almost everywhere approximately differentiable and @xmath110 has an approximate partial derivative in the @xmath115-direction at almost every point .    take a measurable @xmath120 and write @xmath121 .",
    "since @xmath40 and @xmath41 are absolutely continuous with respect to @xmath112 and @xmath105 is one - to - one outside a set of measure zero , we have @xmath122 the claim follows from this .",
    "most of this section is devoted to verifying the local @xmath2 condition in example [ ex:1 ] .",
    "the plan is to use the jacobian equation to estimate the density along a chosen geodesic in @xmath123 . before arriving at this",
    "we will first show that we have an optimal map @xmath96 between two absolutely continuous measures @xmath40 and @xmath41 , that this map is essentially one - to - one and that it can be used in a jacobian equation . using the optimal map @xmath96 we will then select a midpoint measure whose support is still inside our domain . here",
    "we also have to make sure that the map sending an initial point to the midpoint is essentially one - to - one .",
    "finally we will verify that this midpoint measure satisfies @xmath2 . at the very end",
    "we will also indicate why the global @xmath19 condition fails .      since theorem [ thm : cd02maps ]",
    "is proven by approximating the norm @xmath124 with strictly convex norms , the @xmath2 condition ( in fact the @xmath18 condition ) holds inside any domain that is convex in the euclidean sense .",
    "what needs to be done is to verify the @xmath2 condition inside domains of the type shown in figure [ fig:2 ] .",

    "notice that @xmath133 only depends on @xmath103 .",
    "our assumption guarantees @xmath134.\\ ] ]      let us now mention two simplifications that we can always make when checking the @xmath20 condition .",
    "we will return to both of them in more detail at the end of the paper when we finally prove the @xmath2 condition .",
    "the first standard reduction in checking the @xmath20 condition is to assume the measures to be absolutely continuous with respect to the reference measure .",
    "this reduction is possible because we can approximate any probability measure in the @xmath35-distance by an absolutely continuous measure without increasing the entropy .",
    "the second standard simplification we make is that we only define the midpoint between any two given measures .",
    "this has been used for example by bacher and sturm @xcite and the author @xcite .",
    "we can then iterate the procedure of taking midpoints and use the lower semi - continuity of the entropy to have the correct entropy bound along the whole geodesic .",
    "let us then turn to the notation and definitions that are less standard than the ones we recalled in section [ sec : preli ] .",
    "given a metric space @xmath27 , for @xmath135 we denote the set of all the midpoints between @xmath136 and @xmath137 by @xmath138 we will not make the distance @xmath139 visible in the notation because @xmath140 will only be used for @xmath141 and @xmath142 , and for those no confusion should arise .    in the following",
    "we will often consider separately the part of the transport that moves more in the horizontal ( or vertical ) direction . to set some notation",
    "define the set of horizontal transportation @xmath143 the set of vertical transportation @xmath144 and the set of diagonal transportation @xmath145 given any @xmath146 , the restricted measure @xmath147 moves every infinitesimal mass more in the horizontal direction than the vertical , @xmath148 the other way around , and @xmath149 moves mass in the diagonal directions .",
    "one possible way of trying to obtain the needed optimal maps could be to analyse the proof of theorem [ thm : cd02maps ] , or the @xmath18 condition in @xmath17 .",
    "however , we chose a more direct approach of first selecting a suitable optimal transport plan via three consecutive minimizations and then showing that this plan has all the desired properties .",
    "the idea behind the three minimizations is that the @xmath5-norm allows locally a lot of freedom for the coordinate in which the mass is transported less . by doing extra minimization on the two directions separately after the main minimization",
    ", we will increase the monotonicity properties of the optimal transport .",
    "the idea of using consecutive minimizations to choose a better optimal transport plan goes back to @xcite where the existence of optimal maps from absolutely continuous measures in @xmath15 for cost functions of the form @xmath150 was proven - first with any crystalline norm @xmath151 by ambrosio , kirchheim and pratelli in @xcite and then with any norm @xmath151 by champion and de pascale in @xcite .",
    "let us also note that the existence of an optimal map in our case with @xmath152 has been proven by carlier , de pascale and santambrogio in @xcite .",
    "we will prove here the existence of a specific optimal transport map using the consecutive minimizations in order to keep the paper reasonably self - contained and , more importantly , in order to guarantee that the chosen optimal plan has all the needed cyclical monotonicity properties .",
    "let us give the three minimizations .",
    "suppose that @xmath92 are given .",
    "let @xmath153 be the set of those @xmath154 that minimize @xmath155 and satisfy @xmath156 and @xmath157 .",
    "the set @xmath158 is a nonempty closed and convex subset of @xmath159 .",
    "next let @xmath160 be the set of those @xmath154 that minimize @xmath161 again @xmath162 is a nonempty closed and convex subset of @xmath159 .",
    "finally let @xmath163 be the set of those @xmath154 that minimize @xmath164 clearly also @xmath165 is nonempty .",
    "we will see in proposition [ prop : exmap ] that in the case @xmath166 the set @xmath165 consists of only one optimal plan which is given by a map . before this , let us list the cyclical monotonicity properties we immediately get from the three minimizations .",
    "let us then prove that in the case @xmath166 the optimal plan in @xmath165 is given by a map .",
    "this is a fairly standard consequence of lemma [ lma : cycmon ] , so we present only parts of the proof to give the idea .",
    "the fact that @xmath165 is a singleton follows once we know that any element in @xmath165 is induced by an optimal map . indeed , if there were two different measures @xmath175 , then by convexity also @xmath176 .",
    "however , the measure @xmath177 would not be induced by a map .",
    "suppose now that there exists @xmath168 that is not induced by a map .",
    "then the disintegration @xmath178 of @xmath65 with respect to @xmath179 is not a dirac mass for a @xmath180-positive set of points @xmath181 .",
    "now there are several cases to check .",
    "we use different cyclical monotonicities to arrive at a contradiction in each of the cases .",
    "the different cases are :    1 .",
    "@xmath182 and @xmath183 for a @xmath40-positive set of @xmath184 .",

    "we may assume that @xmath201 .",
    "let @xmath202 and @xmath203 be such that @xmath204 @xmath205 but now @xmath206 contradicting the cyclical monotonicity of @xmath207 .",
    "this proves the claim in the case ( i ) .    in the case",
    "( ii ) we argue similarly and use the cyclical monotonicities and if @xmath185 is not dirac , and if @xmath186 is not , and if @xmath187 is not . in the case ( iii )",
    "we use if @xmath188 and @xmath182 , and if @xmath188 and @xmath208 .",
    "suppose that does not hold for some @xmath213 .",
    "we may assume that @xmath214 so that @xmath215 . by the cyclical monotonicity we have @xmath216 and @xmath217 .",
    "therefore @xmath218 but now @xmath219 violating the cyclical monotonicity of .",
    "this proves .",
    "the inequality follows similarly from the cyclical monotonicities and .    in estimating the densities at the midpoints we will also need an infinitesimal version of lemma [ lma : monotone ] . recalling the discussion from section [ sec : appdif ] we would like to use a jacobian equation @xmath220    here a few comments are in order . as we mentioned in section",
    "[ sec : appdif ] , usually in writing the jacobian equation the mapping is assumed to be at least approximately differentiable almost everywhere . however , the optimal map @xmath96 is not in general approximately differentiable . to see this ,",

    "nevertheless , because locally in @xmath223 we are sending vertical lines to vertical lines by cyclical monotonicity the first coordinate function @xmath224 is approximately differentiable almost everywhere .",
    "then , because of cyclical monotonicity the second coordinate function @xmath225 is approximately differentiable in the variable @xmath115 for almost every @xmath103 .",
    "now , since @xmath224 was locally ( approximately ) constant in @xmath115 , we get in @xmath223 using proposition [ prop : appjac ] .",
    "similarly we get it also in @xmath226 and @xmath227 .      in proving assume first that @xmath231 . then by the cyclical monotonicity we have @xmath232 .",

    "a geodesic going in the 45 degree direction has to remain the same geodesic and a geodesic going in the horizontal direction can deviate the most .",
    "the idea behind defining the midpoint the way we do here is that we want to keep the height of the transport right for a ( vertical ) @xmath18 condition .",
    "if the height is exactly the correct one for the condition between vertical strips with their base on the sphere bounding our domain , it will also be infinitesimally correct .",
    "naturally the correction for the midpoints needs to be done only in the horizontal part @xmath223 of the transport . for the vertical part @xmath226 and the diagonal part @xmath227 we can use the euclidean midpoints ( who will respectively give a @xmath18 and @xmath235 condition for those parts of the transport ) .",
