    "one of the most significant theoretical advances in recent years has been the application of ads / cft correspondence  @xcite between string theories defined on the 5-dimensional anti - de sitter(ads ) space - time and conformal field theories(cft ) in physical space - time .",
    "although qcd is not itself a conformal theory , it may possess an approximate conformal symmetry in the domain where the qcd coupling is approximately constant and quark masses can be neglected .",
    "based on the premise that qcd belongs to this class , theoretical development of ads / cft to qcd , often referred as  ads / qcd \" or  holographic qcd \" , has been very popular in recent years .",
    "the resulting ads / qcd model gives predictions for hadron spectroscopy  @xcite and a description of the quark structure of hadrons  @xcite which has scale invariance and dimensional counting  @xcite at short distances , together with color confinement at large distances .",
    "the ads / qcd correspondence is particularly relevant for the description of hadronic form factors and also provides a convenient framework for analytically continuing the space - like results to the time - like region .",
    "the form factors have been studied within the holographic approach  @xcite , and the connection between the ads / qcd approach  @xcite and the usual light - front formalism for hadronic form factors was proposed in  @xcite and discussed in  @xcite .",
    "some other recent applications of different ads / qcd models(hard - wall or soft - wall models)to the form factors of hadrons can be found in  @xcite . in ads",
    "/ qcd one breaks the conformal symmetry by impeding the ability of the field @xmath0 to penetrate deeply into the bulk , which leads to an explanation of confinement and more generally constrains the model s infrared(ir ) behavior .",
    "this may be accomplished by imposing a hard cutoff and appropriate boundary conditions on @xmath0 at some finite value of fifth dimension @xmath1  @xcite(hard - wall model ) or by imposing a soft ir cutoff with an oscillator - type potential in the action for large @xmath2  @xcite(soft - wall model ) .",
    "the connection between the ads / qcd and the light - front approaches allows one to compute the analytic form of frame - independent light - front wavefunctions @xmath3 of hadrons in physical space - time  @xcite , thus providing a relativistic description of hadrons in qcd at the amplitude level .",
    "the pion electromagnetic form factor has been exemplified by ads / qcd , in particular , the power - law behavior of the form factor @xmath4 is well reproduced by the soft - wall ads / qcd model(or gaussian model )  @xcite .",
    "the key ingredient in this correspondence is the conformal symmetry valid in the negligible quark mass . using the connection between the ads / qcd and the light - front approaches in the calculation of the hadronic form factors  @xcite",
    ", we calculated  @xcite the pion form factor in our light - front quark model(lfqm ) taking into account a momentum - dependent dynamical quark mass .",
    "we confirmed that the power - law behavior of the pion form factor is indeed attained by taking into account a momentum - dependent dynamical quark mass which becomes negligible at large momentum region .",
    "our result  @xcite was consistent with an important point of ads / qcd prediction , namely , the holographic wavefunction contains the contribution from all scales up to the confining scale .",
    "we also have shown that the broader shape of the pion distribution amplitude increases the magnitude of the leading twist perturbative qcd(pqcd ) predictions for the pion form factor by a factor of 16/9 compared to the prediction based on the asymptotic form . very recently , brodsky and de teramond  @xcite extended their ads / qcd model to obtain the time - like pion form factor by doing analytic continuation of the space - like result to the time - like region .",
    "however , the dispersion relation of the time - like form factor @xmath5 has not yet been analyzed explicitly .",
    "we thus show in this work that the time - like form factor obtained by the analytic continuation of the space - like form factor correctly satisfies the dispersion relation .",
    "working in the framework of the lfqm that takes into account a momentum - dependent dynamical quark mass  @xcite , we further extend our previous analysis of the space - like pion form factor to the time - like region and compare with the result obtained from the ads / qcd model  @xcite .",
    "our comparative analysis reveals the effects from the quark spin and dynamical mass .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we present the soft contribution to the pion form factor using the lfqm . in sec .",
    "iii , we present the space- and time - like pion form factor in the conformal symmetry limit .",
    "we also compare our lfqm results with the soft - wall ads / qcd model calculation  @xcite to investigate the quark spin structure inside the pion . in sec .",
    "iv , we show our numerical results of both space- and time - like pion form factor .",
    "the direct calculation of the pion form factor is shown to be in excellent agreement with the result obtained from the dispersion relation .",
    "summary and conclusion follow in sec . v.",
    "the elastic pion form factor is related to pion electromagnetic current by the following equation : [ pion_ma ] p|j^(0)|p= ( p + p)^f_(q^2 ) . as usual , our calculation will be carried out using the drell - yan - west frame(@xmath6=@xmath7=0 ) where @xmath8 , i.e. @xmath9 is the space - like momentum transfer . in this frame , the matrix element of the current can be expressed as convolution integral in terms of the light - front wavefunction and the pion form factor can be written for the  + \" -component of the current @xmath10 as follows(see  @xcite for more detailed calculation ) : [ soft_ff ] f_(q^2)&= & ^1_0 dxd^2*k*__r(x,*k * _ ) _ r(x,*k * _ ) + & & , where @xmath11 and the factors @xmath12 and @xmath13 in the numerator come from the ordinary helicity(@xmath14 ) and the higher helicity(@xmath15 ) components of the spin - orbit wave function @xmath16 , respectively . here",
    ", the explicit form of @xmath16 is obtained by the interaction - independent melosh transformation  @xcite from the ordinary equal - time static spin - orbit wave function assigned by the quantum numbers @xmath17 .",
    "the radial wave function is given by [ radial ] _",
    "r(x,*k*_)= ( -k^2/2 ^ 2 ) , where the gaussian parameter @xmath18 is related with the size of pion and the three momentum squared @xmath19 can be represented by the light - front ( lf ) variables , i.e. [ ksquare ] k^2 = -m^2 , for the quark mass @xmath20 . for additional factor @xmath21 to the radial wavefunction @xmath22 ( similarly @xmath23 to @xmath24 ) ) is the jacobian of the variable transformation @xmath25 due to the normalization of the radial wavefunction  @xcite . for the low momentum transfer phenomenology in lfqm , it is customary to take a constant constituent quark mass @xmath26 as a mean value of the momentum dependent dynamical quark mass at low momentum region .",
    "the momentum dependence of the dynamical quark mass in the spacelike momentum region has been discussed in lattice qcd  @xcite as well as in other approaches such as dyson - schwinger  @xcite and instanton  @xcite models .",
    "also , the difference between spacelike and timelike meson form factors at large momentum transfer was discussed in the framework of pqcd with sudakov effects included  @xcite .",
    "matching between the low momentum lfqm prediction and the large momentum pqcd prediction is a highly nontrivial task which goes beyond the scope of our present work . nevertheless ,",
    "as we discussed in  @xcite , one should understand @xmath26 as a function of @xmath27 in principle although in practice @xmath28 for the low @xmath27 phenomenology can be taken as a constant constituent quark mass . in our previous analysis  @xcite , we took the simple parametrization of the quark mass evolution @xmath28 in space - like momentum region as @xmath29 $ ] , where @xmath30 mev and @xmath31 mev represent the current(at high @xmath27 ) and constituent(at low @xmath27 ) quark mass , respectively . in this work ,",

    "we note  @xcite that @xmath32 in eq .",
    "( [ soft_ff ] ) provides a mass - dependent weighting factor @xmath33 which severely suppresses the contribution from the endpoint region of @xmath34 and 1 unless @xmath35 .",
    "this weighting factor leads to the gaussian fall - off of @xmath36 at high @xmath27 region for the constant constituent quark mass which breaks the conformal symmetry . when the conformal symmetry limit ( @xmath35 ) is taken , however , there is no such suppression of the endpoint region and the high @xmath27 behavior of the form factor dramatically changes from a gaussian fall - off to a power - law reduction . in the next section , we shall elaborate the pion form factor to explain why the power - law behavior attained in our eq .",
    "( [ soft_ff ] ) is not accidental but a consequence of the constraint taken from the conformal symmetry .",
    "in order to facilitate our calculation , we change the momentum variables as @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",

    "this is the reason why the pion form factor is complex in time - like region(@xmath69 ) but real in space - like region .",
