    "is often used to mitigate fading in wireless communication systems and selection combining ( sc ) is one of the simplest diversity combining methods [ 1 ] .",
    "the outage probability ( op ) is the first - order statistical measure of a diversity system and its typical performance measure .",
    "the op of sc systems in an interference - limited environment ( such as that of cellular mobile systems ) for various fading channels presented a challenge that was successfully tackled by the studies of more then a few researchers , for example , for the rayleigh channel in [ 2 ] , for the nakagami channel in [ 3]-[5 ] , and for the correlated nakagami channels in [ 6 ] .",
    "the op is also essential to determine other system s performance measures , such as the probabilities of bit ( symbol ) error that are also already determined for various modulation techniques and corresponding sc receiver structures and fading channels [ 5],[6 ] .",
    "the average level crossing rate ( lcr ) and the average fade duration ( afd ) are the system second - order statistical measures [ 7]-[9 ] , which reflect the correlation properties of its input / output signals .",
    "the expressions for the average lcr and the afd are known for the signal envelope at the output of an sc system for independent branch ( rayleigh , rician or nakagami fading ) signals in presence of the thermal noise ( awgn ) but in absence of the cochannel interference ( cci ) [ 10 ] . in",
    "[ 11 ] , explicit closed - form expressions are derived for the average lcr and the afd of a dual diversity sc system subject to cci and rayleigh fading only . in this letter",
    ", we derive the expressions for the average lcr and the afd for the dual diversity sc system that employs the desired signal power algorithm and is exposed to both the awgn and the cci in generalized nakagami fading channels .",
    "the dual diversity sc communication receiver is exposed to the awgn and independent and identically distributed ( iid ) single desired signal and multiple cci signals transmitted over nakagami flat fading channels .",
    "the desired signal is received over two diversity branches ( paths ) with same set of average fading power @xmath0 and fading severity parameter @xmath1 , whose envelopes @xmath2 follow the nakagami probability distribution function ( pdf ) [ 12 ] , @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the gamma function , defined by @xmath5 [ 14 ] .",
    "the cochannel interference consists of @xmath6 nakagami - faded iid transmissions ( each received over the two diversity branches ) .",
    "they are assumed to have same set of average fading power @xmath7 and fading severity parameter @xmath8 , so the envelope of some interference signal @xmath9 received in branch @xmath10 , @xmath11 , is a nakagami random variable ( rv ) whose pdf is given by [ 12 ] @xmath12    both @xmath1 and @xmath8 are assumed to be positive integers .    in presence of the cci , the branch selection of the selective combiners can rely on three somewhat different decision algorithms that already received sufficient attention in the literature [ 3 , section iv ] and [ 11 ] : the desired signal power algorithm , the total power algorithm and the signal - to - interference power ratio ( sir ) algorithm .",
    "the desired signal power algorithm is the most difficult to implement in practice as it requires identification and separation of the desired signal and the cci .",
    "however , the known performance analysis of the desired signal power algorithm for an interference - limited sc system ( the outage probability [ 3 ] and the lcr and afd in rayleigh fading [ 11 ] ) indicates almost identical performance to that of the total power algorithm , which is the easiest to implement in practice .",
    "for the purpose of analytical tractability , we adopt the desired signal power algorithm and reasonably assume that the obtained results may also closely indicate the performance of the total power algorithm .",
    "note that the presence of the awgn does not significantly influence the operation of the desired signal power algorithm and its decisions .",
    "this assumption is appropriate only if , in measuring the largest desired signal power , the average awgn power is taken over a sufficiently long time such that it may be considered as a constant across all branches . in this case , choosing the signal with the largest desired signal power is actually equivalent to choosing the branch with the largest signal - to - noise power ratio ( snr ) .",
    "thus , the receiver is assumed to use the sc algorithm that selects the branch with the largest short - term desired signal power , @xmath13 , or , equivalently , the desired branch signal with the largest short - term envelope level , @xmath14 .",
    "then , the short - term interference power at the output of the sc receiver is consisted of the powers of the individual interference signals @xmath15 received in the selected branch , and is given by @xmath16 [ 3 , eqs .",
    "( 19)-(22 ) ] where the pdf of @xmath15 is determined by ( 2 ) .",
    "considering also the presence of the awgn , the short - term signal - to - interference - plus - noise power ratio ( sinr ) at the output of the dual diversity sc system is given by [ 6 ]    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the awgn power ( being constant over the short - term measurement and equal for the two diversity branches ) and @xmath19 is the interference - plus - noise power .",
    "for an interference - limited system , @xmath20 , and ( 3 ) reduces to @xmath21 , denoting the short - term sir .",
    "to arrive at the desired result , we define the ratio of the selected desired signal envelope @xmath22 and the interference - plus - noise envelope @xmath23 , @xmath24 which will be denoted as the _ envelope ratio_. in absence of the awgn , the envelope ratio is represented as @xmath25 , denoting the signal - to - interference envelope ratio",
    ".    we will first establish the average lcr of the envelope ratio .",
    "the average lcr of the envelope ratio at threshold @xmath26 represents the average number of times , per time unit , the stationary fading process @xmath27 crosses threshold @xmath26 in the positive direction , and is mathematically defined by rice s formula [ 7 ] @xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes the time derivative of @xmath26 , and @xmath30 is the joint pdf of rvs @xmath26(@xmath31 ) and @xmath32 in an arbitrary moment @xmath31 .",
    "the afd is defined as the average time that the envelope ratio remains below the threshold @xmath26 , and is defined by @xmath33 where @xmath34 denotes the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) of the envelope ratio . by introducing ( 4 ) into ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) ,",
    "the average lcr and the afd for the sinr at threshold @xmath35 are found as @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively .",

    "the cdf of the sinr at threshold @xmath35 is obtained by introducing ( 11 ) into @xmath55 , which actually represents the op of the sc system .",
    "it is possible to determine the closed - form solution of the cdf of the sinr , because the first arguments of the incomplete gamma function appearing in ( 11 ) are positive integers and are expandable as finite series according to ( [ rava1.1 ] ) .",

    "the closed - form solution of the cdf of the sinr involves five - fold summations and will not be presented here due to its length .",
    "alternatively , it is possible to numerically integrate ( 11 ) by using standard numerical techniques and to determine the cdf of the sinr for the given set of values for @xmath35 , @xmath52 and @xmath60 .    for an interference - limited system , ( 11 ) specializes into a closed - form representing the pdf of the signal - to - interference envelope ratio , @xmath61 which is also derived in appendix a. in ( 13 ) , @xmath62 is the beta function @xmath63 , and @xmath64 is the regularized beta function defined by @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the incomplete beta function defined by @xmath67 [ 14 ] .    when @xmath1 is a positive integer , a closed - form solution for the respective cdf is obtainable in terms of the beta functions as given in appendix a by ( [ rava1.7 ] ) .",
    "consequently , the cdf of the sir at threshold @xmath35 is given by @xmath68 in case of rayleigh fading ( @xmath69 ) , using the general identity @xmath70 , it is readily verified that ( 14 ) specializes into a previously obtained result [ 11 , eq .",

    ", one needs to establish the joint pdf of random processes @xmath27 and @xmath32 at any given moment @xmath31 .",
