    "in this talk , we are going to summarize a few models that have been suggested to explain the newly observed particle of about 125 gev at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite .",
    "it is of very high expectation that the observed particle is the long - sought higgs boson , which was proposed in 1960s @xcite .    before the lhc era",
    "there have been many speculations of the breaking of electroweak symmetry ( ewsb ) .",
    "there are two known scales in particle physics  the electroweak scale and the planck scale .",
    "the fundamental higgs boson of order 100 gev is unstable against the radiative corrections .",
    "the so - called gauge hierarchy problem requires new physics has to come in around tev scale in order that the unnatural cancellation between the bare mass term and the higher - order terms of the higgs boson mass is under control . historically , there are two categories of models : one with a strongly - coupled ewsb sector and one with a weakly - coupled ewsb sector .",
    "the most studied model for strong ewsb is the technicolor - type model @xcite while that for weakly - coupled ewsb model is the supersymmetry @xcite . in technicolor models ,",
    "the standard model ( sm ) is simply an effective model below tev scale , at which the theory is replaced by another strong dynamics .",
    "therefore , the cutoff scale now becomes just tev . on the other hand ,",
    "supersymmetric models predict another set of particles , which differ from their sm counter parts by a half - integral spin .",
    "quadratically divergent contributions to the higgs boson radiative corrections are cancelled among the sm particles and the corresponding supersymmetric particles .",
    "if the superconducting super collider ( ssc ) were built the higgs boson could have been discovered in early 2000s with perhaps a short running of the machine .",
    "since the higgs boson has been hiding for such a long time , many interesting alternatives were proposed in the last 1015 years . around the turn of the century extra dimension models",
    "became very popular , not to mention there have been a large number of varieties large extra dimension @xcite , universal extra dimension @xcite , randall - sundrum models @xcite , etc .",
    "there are also the little higgs type models @xcite .",
    "in contrast to supersymmetry the new particles have the spin as their sm counter parts .",
    "contributions to the higgs boson radiative corrections are cancelled among the sm particles and the corresponding new particles .",
    "perhaps , more and more models would have been proposed if the higgs boson kept hiding .",
    "would nt it be more fascinating for theorists ?",
    "the past few years the high energy community has been very excited with a number of experimental anomalies from the tevatron , lhc , and dark matter ( dm ) experiments .",
    "the long - time inconsistency among the dama results @xcite ( also the cogent @xcite ) and the other direct detection experiments has motivated a number of unconventional dark matter models @xcite , such as inelastic dm @xcite , isospin - violating dm @xcite , multi - component dm @xcite , etc .",
    "the top - quark forward - backward asymmetry observed by the cdf and d  collaborations is rather puzzling too @xcite .",
    "many models such as flavor - changing @xmath0 , unusual @xmath1 , axigluon , etc @xcite were proposed , but the new lhc results seem ruled out almost all of these models @xcite .",
    "the cdf @xmath2 anomaly in 2011 @xcite also stimulated a large number of theoretical or phenomenological models to account for the observation @xcite .",
    "however , with non - observation of the resonance from d  and cms @xcite the excitement gradually died out .    at the end of 2011 , both the atlas and cms @xcite experiments at the lhc have seen some excess of events of a possible higgs candidate in the decays of @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 channels .",
    "finally , the discovery was jointly announced in july 2012 by atlas @xcite and cms @xcite .",
    "all the observed channels , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are consistent with the predictions of the sm higgs boson , except that the @xmath8 rate is somewhat higher than expectation .",
    "the @xmath9 and @xmath10 channels are not confirmed yet , because of large uncertainties .",
    "the diphoton production rate is about a factor of @xmath11 higher than that of the standard model higgs boson , while the @xmath12 and @xmath13 rates are consistent with the sm higgs boson within uncertainties . nevertheless , the observed rates are consistent with either the sm higgs boson or some other higgs models . a large number of models have been put forward to account for the observed particle at 125 gev , including the sm , mssm , nmssm , umssm and other mssm - extended models , fermiophobic higgs , 2hdm , rs radion , inert - higgs doublet , triplet higgs models , etc .",
    "the @xmath14 events collected by cms and atlas can be divided into two categories : _ inclusive _ @xmath15 and _ exclusive _ @xmath16 ( though both experiments have more refined sub - divisions among various classes of events ) .",
    "presumably , the inclusive @xmath15 events include all production channels such as gluon fusion , vector - boson fusion , associated production , etc , among which gluon fusion dominates for production of the sm higgs boson and most of the models considered in this talk , except for the fermiophobic higgs boson .",
    "on the other hand , exclusive @xmath16 events mainly come from vector - boson fusion and associated production , which can be further disentangled by jet - tagging techniques .",
    "the vector - boson fusion produces energetic forward jets while associated production with a @xmath17 or @xmath18 produces jets with @xmath19 to @xmath20 .",
    "the current evidence of the higgs boson in the diphoton channel comes mainly from inclusive @xmath15 events , simply because the inclusive event rate is much higher than the exclusive @xmath21 event rate .",
    "the main goal of this talk is to summarize all the models and find the parameter space of each model that have been proposed to explain the excess in the inclusive higgs diphoton events , and attempt in distinguishing the models using the exclusive @xmath21 channel in vector - boson fusion ( vbf ) @xcite .",
    "the exclusive vbf events with @xmath21 in the final state are selected using the forward jet - tagging techniques which will be explained shortly .",
    "we will first choose the parameter - space region of each model that can account for the excess in the inclusive diphoton rate , and then in that region of parameter space we calculate the exclusive @xmath22 vbf production rates .",
    "we found that the exclusive @xmath21 production rate in vbf channel can give more information to help in distinguishing a number of popular models .",
    "we summarize a number of models that have been used to account for the excess in the inclusive @xmath15 data as follows .    1 .   the sm higgs boson @xcite is still believed to be the most desirable candidate .",
    "it is still consistent with the data within uncertainty .",
    "2 .   the lighter higgs boson of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) can acquire a large radiative correction from the top - stop sector to achieve a mass of 125 gev , though it has been shown rather difficult to achieve an enhanced diphoton rate @xcite .",
    "however , it is possible when one of the staus is light enough , just above the lep limit , and so the diphoton branching ratio is enhanced @xcite .",
    "3 .   one of cp - even higgs bosons in the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) can account for the observed 125 gev boson with an enhanced diphoton rate @xcite .",
    "it could be the lightest or the second lightest one .",
    "the @xmath23-extended mssm ( umssm ) @xcite and other extensions @xcite are also possible to account for the observed boson .",
    "the analyses for these extended mssm models are much more involved and deserve dedicated studies .",
    "the lighter cp - even higgs boson of various types of the two - higgs - doublet models ( 2hdm ) @xcite , which has enough free parameters in the model that allows one to achieve a large branching ratio into @xmath8 .",
    "5 .   in the fermiophobic ( fp )",
    "higgs boson model , the higgs boson is only responsible to generate the masses to @xmath17 and @xmath18 bosons while the fermion masses are generated by some other means . since",
    "the fp higgs boson does not couple to the quarks , it can not be produced via gluon fusion at hadronic colliders , but only through the vbf and the associated production with a vector - boson .",
    "nevertheless , the fp higgs boson lighter than 130 gev has a much larger branching ratio into diphoton , such that it can still account for the observed inclusive diphoton rate at the lhc @xcite .",
    "6 .   in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was pointed out that the randall - sundrum ( rs ) radion , with enhanced couplings to @xmath24 and @xmath8 due to trace anomaly , can explain the excess in the inclusive diphoton production rate and suppressed @xmath6 and @xmath7 rates , which provides the most economical alternative solution to explain the observed data .",
    "the inert - higgs - doublet model ( ihdm ) @xcite , which is a special case of 2hdm , in which one of the doublets entirely decouples from the leptons , quarks , and gauge bosons while the other one takes on the role of the sm higgs doublet .",
    "the production rate of the higgs boson is the same as the sm one .",
    "however , the decay width of @xmath25 can be enhanced by the presence of the charged higgs boson in the loop .",
    "it was shown @xcite that the diphoton production rate can be enhanced by a factor of about @xmath26 .",
    "there may also be some possibilities that the sm - like higgs boson first decays into two light scalar or pseudoscalar bosons , followed by subsequent decays into collimated pairs of photons , which appear as two photons in the final state @xcite . on the other hand , instead of top - down approaches",
    ", it would also be useful to reversely determine the couplings and the nature of the observed 125 gev particle by studying all the available data @xcite .",
    "the disadvantage of gluon fusion is that it is not clear what particles and their masses running in the triangle loop . in some models ,",
    "the contribution from a particular charged particle can increase or decrease the diphoton decay width , depending on the relative signs .",
    "for example , in the supersymmetric models , there are additional sfermions , charginos , charged higgs bosons running in the loop , and therefore resulting in complicated dependence on the model parameters . on the other hand ,",
    "the advantage of using @xmath6 fusion or associated production with a @xmath17 or a @xmath18 boson is that the production diagram is clean and directly testing the couplings of @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath6 fusion has a cross section at least a factor of 2 larger than the associated production .",
    "we therefore focus on @xmath6 fusion .",
    "the @xmath6 fusion can be extracted by the presence of two energetic forward jets .",
    "we can impose selection cuts to select jets in forward rapidity and high energy region @xcite . by combining the production rates in the inclusive @xmath15 and exclusive @xmath21 channels , one can obtain useful information about the nature of the 125 gev new particle recently observed at the lhc .",
    "we calculate the event rates in the @xmath6 fusion channel for a number of models that have been used to interpret the current lhc data of the 125 gev `` higgs boson '' .",
    "the theoretical cleanliness of @xmath6 fusion has been explained in the last paragraph .",
    "we believe that the @xmath6 fusion channel can provide useful information to discriminate various models .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows .",
    "we briefly highlight a number of models in the next section , and the @xmath6 fusion and selection cuts in sec .",
    "we give the decay branching ratios in sec .",
    "iv and production rates in sec .",
    "v. we conclude in sec . vi .",
    "the sm higgs boson @xcite is still the most favorable candidate to interpret the observed boson , though the experimental data showed slightly excess in inclusive @xmath29 events over the prediction of the sm higgs boson @xcite .",
    "production of the sm higgs boson is dominated by gluon fusion , which is an order of magnitude larger than the next important mechanism ",
    "there are two higgs doublets instead of just one in the 2hdm . in order to avoid dangerous tree level flavor - changing neutral currents ,",
    "the popular 2hdms are imposed a discrete symmetry . in the type",
    "i , all of the fermions couple to a single higgs doublet , and do not couple to the second doublet ; while in the type ii , one doublet couples only to down - type quarks and another doublet couples to the up - type quarks .",
    "in this talk , we focus on the type ii , which has the same higgs sector as the mssm .",
    "the higgs sector consists of two higgs doublets @xmath30 where the subscripts @xmath31 denote the right - handed quark singlet field that the higgs doublet couples to .",
    "the electroweak symmetry is broken when the higgs doublet fields develop the following vevs : @xmath32 physically , there are two cp - even , one cp - odd , and a pair of charged higgs bosons after electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) , and the @xmath17 and @xmath18 bosons as well as the sm fermions , except for neutrinos , acquire masses .",
    "the yukawa couplings and masses for fermions can be obtained from the following yukawa interactions after ewsb @xmath33 where @xmath34 .",
    "the parameters of the model in the cp - conserving case include @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the mixing angle between the two cp - even higgs bosons .",
    "there are enough free parameters in the higgs potential such that all the above parameters are free inputs to the model , in contrast to the mssm where the higgs potential is highly restricted by supersymmetry in addition to gauge symmetry .    the couplings of the two lighter and heavier cp - even higgs bosons @xmath37 and @xmath38 respectively and the cp - odd higgs boson @xmath39 to the top , bottom quarks , and taus are given by , with a common factor of @xmath40 being suppressed , @xmath41 while the charged higgs @xmath42 couples to @xmath43 and @xmath44 via @xmath45 \\;.\\ ] ] other relevant couplings in @xmath6 fusion are those to gauge bosons are given by , @xmath46    dominant production of the light cp - even higgs boson @xmath37 at the lhc is via gluon fusion , similar to the sm higgs boson with the top quark running in the loop ; however , in the large @xmath47 region the bottom - quark contribution can also be substantial .",
    "since the bottom - yukawa coupling can be substantially enhanced , the gluon fusion cross section can be larger than the sm .",
    "on the other hand , since the couplings of the @xmath37 to the @xmath6 and @xmath7 are simply the sm values multiplied by @xmath48 , @xmath6 fusion cross sections are in general smaller than the sm .",
    "the decay into two photons is somewhat more complicated than the sm .",
    "besides the couplings @xmath27 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 are different , there are also the charged higgs bosons running in the loop .",
    "the charged higgs boson couples to the light cp - even higgs with the coupling @xcite @xmath51 however , the @xmath52 and b meson mixing constraints require the charged higgs boson mass @xmath53 gev for intermediate to large values of @xmath47 @xcite",
    ". we will choose @xmath54 gev in our analysis below .",
    "the overall diphoton production rate @xmath55 in gluon fusion can easily vary between @xmath56 of the sm prediction depending on parameters @xcite .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the enhancement in branching ratio can be obtained roughly along @xmath57 near zero for all @xmath47 in the type ii model .",
    "we choose parameter space points there to illustrate .      in order to achieve a mass of 125 gev for the lighter cp - even higgs boson ,",
    "a very large radiative correction is needed , which essentially comes from top - stop loop .",
    "the approximate formula for the lighter cp - even higgs boson is given by @xcite @xmath58\\ ] ] where @xmath59 and @xmath60 tev is the susy scale .",
    "a large @xmath61 is needed to generate a large correction . here",
    "we follow the findings in ref .",
    "@xcite for the parameter space : we choose @xmath62 gev , @xmath63 tev , @xmath64 tev , and @xmath65 .",
    "a detailed analysis of the mssm parameter space based on bayesian statistical analysis in light of the new observation of the 125 gev higgs candidate is also presented recently in ref .",
    "the reason behind such a large @xmath47 is the stau contribution to the diphoton branching ratio explained below @xcite .    in the production part via gluon fusion , the difference between the sm and supersymmetric models is that squarks also run in the triangle loop . as the experimental data have pushed the squark masses of the first two generations to be quite heavy but not the third generation ( stop and sbottom ) the change in production rates could be substantial , especially in large @xmath47 . on the other hand , the decay into diphoton is more involved in susy models .",
    "all charged particles , including squarks , sleptons , charginos , charged higgs boson can flow in the triangle loop . with the present constraints from experiments ,",
    "the production rate into diphoton ( equal to production cross section times the branching ratio into diphoton ) in the mssm is shown to be very similar to the sm one and that the diphoton production rate can hardly be enhanced by more than a factor of @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "the formulas for the decay of the higgs boson into two photons as well as production via gluon fusion can be found in ref .",
    "the couplings of the lighter cp - even higgs boson to the @xmath6 or @xmath7 are given by the sm ones multiplied by @xmath67 .",
    "therefore , the production rate in the @xmath6 fusion is in general similar to or smaller than the sm prediction .",
    "we look at the parameter space in which the diphoton production rate would be larger than the sm value in the mssm .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that diphoton production rate can be larger than the sm one if one pushes the stau to be very light , just above the lep limit .",
    "in addition to the above mentioned soft parameters , the other parameters are @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and the @xmath70 . without loss of generality",
    "we choose @xcite @xmath71 in which we can scan for the diphoton production rate @xmath72 to be larger than the sm rate .",
    "the region essentially gives a light stau , which can enhance the @xmath73 .",
    "we will scan the region according to eq .",
    "( [ stau ] ) and require the mass of the lighter cp - even higgs boson around 125 gev and the diphoton production rate larger than the sm value .      with the name `` fermiophobic '' ( fp ) the higgs boson only couples to the vector bosons at tree level , though higher - loop corrections can induce small couplings to fermions .",
    "in this case , the yukawa couplings and masses of fermions are generated by some other mechanisms , which are not of concern in this talk .",
    "the coupling strength of the fp higgs boson to vector bosons is the same as that of the sm higgs boson .",
    "we write the interactions as @xmath74 since the fp higgs boson does not couple to quarks , it can not be produced dominantly by gluon fusion at hadronic colliders , but only through the vector - boson fusion and the associated production with a @xmath75 boson .",
    "the corresponding production cross sections are the same as the vbf of the sm higgs boson .",
    "nevertheless , the fp higgs boson lighter than 130 gev has a much larger branching ratio into diphoton , such that it can still account for the observed diphoton rate at the lhc @xcite .",
    "there are two reasons : ( i ) the fp higgs boson decay into fermions is highly suppressed with only the loop - induced couplings , and ( ii ) the decay into photons is via a loop of @xmath17 boson without the negative interference from the top quark . thus , the branching ratio into diphoton can be enhanced by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "overall , the diphoton production rate at the lhc is comparable to the sm higgs boson , as was used to account for the observed boson @xcite",
    ". an earlier study of fp higgs boson at the lhc can be found in ref .",
    "there is basically no free parameters in this model .      the rs model @xcite used a warped 5d space - time , a slice of the symmetric space @xmath76 , to explain the gauge hierarchy problem .",
    "the extra dimension @xmath77 is a single @xmath78 orbifold with one hidden and one visible 3-brane localized at @xmath79 and @xmath80 , respectively .",
    "it was pointed out by goldberger and wise @xcite that the original rs model has a four - dimensional massless scalar ( the modulus or radion ) which does not have a potential and therefore the extra dimension can not be stabilized .",
    "a stabilization mechanism was proposed in @xcite by adding a bulk scalar field propagating in the background solution which can generate a potential to stabilize the modulus field .",
    "the minimum of the potential can be arranged to give the desired value of @xmath81 to solve the gauge hierarchy problem without extreme fine tuning of parameters . as a consequence ,",
    "the lightest excitation mode of the modulus field is the radion , which has a mass of the order of 100 gev to a tev , and the strength of its coupling to the sm fields is of the order of @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "phenomenology of the stabilized radion and its effects on the background geometry were studied in @xcite .",
    "the interactions of the stabilized modulus ( radion ) @xmath83 with the sm particles on the visible brane are completely determined by 4-dimensional general covariance .",
    "thus the radion lagrangian is given by @xmath84 where @xmath85 is of the order of tev and @xmath86 is the trace of the sm energy - momentum stress tensor , which has the following lowest order terms @xmath87 the coupling of the radion to a pair of gluons ( photons ) is induced at one loop level , with the dominated contributions coming from the heavy top quark ( top quark and @xmath17 ) as well as from the trace anomaly in qcd ( qed ) .",
    "the expressions of the induced couplings can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "similar to the sm higgs boson , the dominant production channel for the radion is via @xmath24 fusion , followed by vbf @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xmath88 gets substantial enhancement from the trace anomaly . for the decay of the radion",
    ", it is dominated by the @xmath24 mode instead of @xmath9 at the low mass region , while its diphoton branching ratio is merely a fraction of the sm value of @xmath89 .",
    "overall , the diphoton production rate @xmath90 can be larger than the sm rate if the scale @xmath91 is small enough , and as long as it is consistent with the search for rs graviton . if we do not concern about naturalness , the scale @xmath91 can be as small as 0.8 tev .",
    "here we fix the scale @xmath91 to be @xmath92 tev , which can enhance the diphoton production rate in gluon fusion by a factor of @xmath93 @xcite relative to the sm rate .",
    "note that the branching ratios of the radion is independent of @xmath91 .",
    "ihdm is a special case of 2hdm , in which one of the doublets takes on the role of the sm higgs doublet , while the other one is inert which means that it entirely decouples from the sm leptons , quarks , and gauge bosons .",
    "the model also has an additional @xmath94 symmetry , for which all sm particles are even , except for the particle content of the second inert higgs doublet . the lightest @xmath94-odd particle of the second doublet can work as a candidate of dark matter .",

    "the @xmath37 plays the role of the sm higgs boson while the others are inert .",
    "a list of parameters of the model includes @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "production via gluon fusion and via @xmath6 fusion are the same as the sm higgs boson .",
    "however , the decay into @xmath8 receives additional contributions from the @xmath103 running in the loop .",
    "if kinematically allowed the higgs boson @xmath37 can also decay into @xmath104 and @xmath105 . for simplicity and to achieve a large enough branching ratio into @xmath8 we set the masses of @xmath106 to be above the threshold @xmath107 . in this model , the coupling between the charged higgs boson and the sm higgs boson @xmath37 is given by @xmath108 it is clear that from this equation the sign of the charged higgs contribution to the triangular loop can be positive or negative , depending on the sizes of @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "thus , if we set @xmath111 , the charged higgs contribution vanishes and so the diphoton branching ratio becomes the same as the sm one .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that in gluon fusion the diphoton production rate is determined by the product of gluon - fusion cross section and the @xmath8 branching ratio @xmath112 which can be varied from about @xmath113 to @xmath114 .",

    "the most distinguished feature of vbf at hadronic colliders is the appearance of two energetic forward jets separated by a large @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is the pseudo - rapidity and @xmath83 is the azimuth angle . the feynman diagram is shown in fig .  [ feyn ] .",
    "each of the initial quarks radiates a @xmath75 boson , which further annihilates into the higgs boson or some other particles under consideration .",
    "the unique feature of this process is that the @xmath75 bosons participating in the fusion process are close to on - shell @xcite , and irrespecive whether the @xmath75 is longitudinal or transverse , the scattered quark carries almost all the energy of the incoming quark and goes in the forward direction . \" @xcite",
    "this fact justifies the use of effective @xmath17 approximation in all calculations for vbf in the early days .",

    "these reconstructed objects are generally referred to as fake photons .",
    "isolation is a very useful tool to reject the non - prompt background coming from electromagnetic showers originating in jets , because these fake photons are often accompanied by single and multiple @xmath143s .    the dijet tag , as defined in eqs .",

    ". a signal - to - background ratio of order 1 can be achieved @xcite .",
    "the signal from @xmath25 will be identified as a sharp peak in the @xmath144 distribution , where the background is in continuum . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the background model is derived from data . in the new run at 8 tev , we expect the same treatment is applied to the background .",
    "the estimation of significance of each signal is beyond the scope of the present paper .    given that we have obtained the event rates of each model in the tables , which have been under experimental cuts and simulations ( pgs ) , it is straight - forward to estimate the required luminosity to probe various scenarios . the continuum background at the 7 tev and 8 tev lhc in vbf channel has been obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "since the sm higgs boson has been seen above the background with some significance level in the vbf channel in the current lhc runs ( about 5 fb@xmath145 at 7 tev and about 5 fb@xmath145 at 8 tev ) , the scenarios with higher event rates than the sm higgs boson should be detectable .",
    "the projected integrated luminosity at the end of 2012 is about @xmath146 fb@xmath145 for each experiment , it would not be a problem to investigate the scenarios in the vbf channel .",
    "lhc is expected to confirm if there is a new particle at 125 gev by the end of this year .",
    "the likelihood for a new discovery is rather high .",
    "nevertheless , whether this new particle is the sm higgs boson is not an easy question to answer .    here",
    "the scenario of this 125 gev particle produced by vector - boson fusion , instead of gluon fusion as the dominant production mechanism for the standard model higgs boson , is studied in details . by using the forward dijet tagging technique , one can single out the vector - boson fusion mechanism .",
    "we studied a number of popular new physics models that have been employed to interpret the observed particle at 125 gev , including fermiophobic higgs boson , the randall - sundrum radion , inert - higgs - doublet model , two - higgs - doublet model , and the mssm . since the inclusive diphoton channel showed an excess over the sm predictions , we first selected the parameter space of each model that can give an inclusive diphoton rate larger than or equal to the sm rate",
    ". then , we calculate the exclusive @xmath22 diphoton production rate in vbf for that parameter space .",
    "if the diphoton mode excess seen at lhc-7 can be firmly established by the new lhc-8 data , it will be the utmost task to identify the nature of this particle . perhaps , it is simply the sm higgs boson with some level of statistical fluctuation , but it could also be the rs radion @xcite , fermiophobic higgs boson @xcite , the light cp - even higgs boson of the 2hdm @xcite , the higgs boson of the ihdm @xcite , or one of the cp - even higgs bosons in other extensions of the mssm @xcite , all of which can allow an enhancement to the @xmath8 production rate . on the other hand , the vector - boson fusion ,",
    "as singled out by the dijet tag , provides useful information in helping to differentiate among various models .",
    "it is not hard by browsing through fig .",
    "[ ratio ] to conclude the following    * if a similar rate is seen in inclusive production but no large excess is seen in the exclusive vbf production it would unlikely be a fermiophobic higgs boson . *",
    "if a similar rate or excess is seen in inclusive production but some events are seen in exclusive vbf production rate , it would unlikely be the rs radion . *",
    "if moderate excess is seen in both inclusive production and exclusive vbf production , it could be the higgs boson of the ihdm , 2hdm , or the mssm .",
    "however , if the excess is over 60% it will pose severe challenge to the mssm .",
    "it seems easy to rule out either fermiophobic higgs boson or rs radion , providing that we see no large excess or some events in vbf channel , respectively .",
    "however , it is still difficult to distinguish the other models when the inclusive and exclusive rates are similar to or slightly larger than the sm values . if the production rate of the diphoton mode at 125 gev lines up with the sm prediction eventually , it is still premature to conclude this is coming from the sm higgs boson .",
    "other alternatives in mssm , nmssm , or other susy models can also be mimicking the sm higgs boson , depending on the parameter space of the new physics model . in any case , once the signals at 125 gev are confirmed further studies including all possible decay modes are to be taken into account in order to discriminate these many alternatives beyond the standard model .",
    "vector - boson fusion is the next most important production mechanism that must be taken into account to fully identify the newly discovered particle .",

    "<S> this review is based on the talk presented at the susy 2012 ( beijing ) . </S>",
    "<S> the new particle around 125 gev observed at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) is almost consistent with the standard model higgs boson , except that the diphoton decay mode may be excessive . </S>",
    "<S> we summarize a number of possibilities . while at the lhc the dominant production mechanism for the higgs boson of the standard model and some other extensions is via the gluon fusion process </S>",
    "<S> , the alternative vector - boson fusion is more sensitive to electroweak symmetry breaking . using the well known dijet - tagging technique to single out the vector - boson fusion mechanism , we investigate potential of vector - boson fusion to discriminate a number of models suggested to give an enhanced inclusive diphoton production rate . </S>"
