    "as is well known , an inflationary scenario @xcite resolves issues of the standard big - bang model such as the horizon problem and , more importantly , gives rise to explanation of the origin of the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) and large scale structures of the universe .",
    "however , there exists no conclusive model for inflation based on particle physics .",
    "the difficulty stems from the fact that we need fine tunings of the inflaton potential to realize slow roll inflation and reconcile resultant predictions with observations .",
    "in fact , from particle physics point of view , it is difficult to keep these fine tunings against radiative corrections .",
    "especially , the mass of a scalar field is quite sensitive to the quantum loop corrections .",
    "thus , we need some symmetry to protect the potential from radiative corrections .    natural inflation  @xcite is proposed as a solution of the fine - tuning problem . there , the shift symmetry of the axion protect the mass from radiative corrections .",
    "this symmetry slightly breaks down due to the non - perturbative quantum effect and consequently an appropriate periodic potential is generated @xcite .",
    "provided a super - planckian axion decay constant , it turned out that natural inflation can explain the cmb observations such as the spectral index  @xcite .",
    "however , it would be difficult to realize the super - planckian axion decay constant in the context of superstring theory or any other fundamental theory  @xcite . to resolve the issue , we need models where the effective axion decay constant is super - planckian although the actual axion decay constant is sub - planckian .",
    "so far , all of the models proposed to achieve this aim resorted to multi - field generalization of natural inflation .",
    "for example , aligned inflation  @xcite , monodromy inflation  @xcite , and n - flation  @xcite ( see also a related work @xcite ) can be categorized into natural inflation with multiple scalar fields .",
    "extra natural inflation utilize a component of gauge fields  @xcite .",
    "moreover , chromo - natural inflation @xcite is natural inflation with a su(2 ) gauge field where slow - roll inflation is realized by the coupling between the axion and the gauge field .",
    "this is also a kind of multi - field extension of natural inflation .",
    "interestingly , apparently different gauge - flation model and non - canonical single field inflation model also belong to this class  @xcite ( see also a review @xcite ) . similar idea is also proposed for ablelian models  @xcite .",
    "remarkably , chromo - natural inflation has a peculiar feature that sizable chiral gravitational waves can be produced during inflation .",
    "this happens because of the transient tachyonic instability due to the cp violating axion coupling to the gauge field .",
    "note that the instability occurs only for one of the helicity modes because of cp violation .",
    "note that this phenomenon appears in inflation models which have an axion coupling not only with non - abelian but also with abelian gauge fields  @xcite .",
    "however , in the framework of chromo - natural inflation , either too much gravitational waves are produced or large non - gaussianity of curvature perturbations are created during inflation .",
    "indeed , there is no phenomenologically allowed region in the parameter space  @xcite .",
    "hence , it is legitimate to say chromo - natural inflation with a single axion is not viable from phenomenological point of view .    in the spirit of multi - field extension , however , it is natural to consider chromo - natural inflation with multiple axions . indeed , there appear many axions with various decay constants and coupling constants in view of the superstring theory landscape , which is dubbed axiverse  @xcite .",
    "recently , multi - natural inflation has been intensively studied  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the effect of gauge fields is ignored in the setup of the multi - natural inflation . in this paper , we study chromo - natural inflation with two axions and investigate if sizable chiral gravitational waves can be produced without conflicting with cmb observations .",
    "in fact , we find that conventional natural inflation occurs on cmb scales , which enables us to circumvent large non - gaussianity and overproduction of gravitational waves on these scales .",
    "moreover , we show that chromo - natural inflation commences after tens of e - foldings , which implies that chiral primordial gravitational waves become sizable in the interesting frequency range where pulsar timing observation and interferometer detectors are available for detection of them .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we present a chromo - natural inflation model with two axion fields and derive equations of motions for the homogeneous fields . in section 3 , we investigate the inflationary dynamics .",
    "we find that natural inflation occurs first and chromo - natural inflation takes over from natural inflation for a class of initial conditions . in section 4 , we evaluate chiral primordial gravitational waves produced during inflation .",
    "it turns out that the amplitude of chiral gravitational waves is enhanced on small scales , which might be detectable by future observations .",
    "the final section is devoted to conclusion .",
    "in this section , we present an inflationary model in the axiverse and derive equations of background motions .",
    "specifically , we consider two axionic fields @xmath1 and @xmath2 which couple with a su(2 ) gauge field @xmath3 . the field strength of the gauge field @xmath4 is defined by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is its gauge coupling constant and @xmath7 is the levi - civita symbol whose components are structure constants of su(2 ) gauge field .",
    "the action reads @xmath8 \\ , \\ ] ] where we used unites @xmath9 and  @xmath10 . here",
    ", @xmath6 is a determinant of a metric @xmath11 ( note that it is not related with the gauge coupling constant ) , @xmath12 is a ricci scalar , and @xmath13 are decay constants of axions .",
    "the dual field strength tensor @xmath14 is defined by @xmath15 we introduced coupling constants of axions to the gauge field  @xmath16 . here",
    ", we assume that there exists a hierarchy between  @xmath17  and  @xmath18 value : @xmath19",
    ". then we can practically set @xmath20 the potential for axions @xmath21 is given by @xmath22+\\mu_2 ^ 4\\left[1-\\cos{\\left(\\dfrac{\\omega}{h}\\right)}\\right ] \\notag \\\\ & \\equiv u(\\chi ) + w(\\omega ) \\",
    ", \\label{eq : potential}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 are dynamically generated energy scales .",
    "we assume that the energy scales of two axions are the same : @xmath24 we verified that there is no qualitative difference even in the presence of the difference in energy scales as long as its hierarchy is not so large .",
    "let us consider homogeneous background dynamics in this set - up . as to the metric , we use a spatially flat metric @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the lapse function . after taking the variation of the action , we set @xmath27 in order to regard the time function @xmath28 as the proper time of hyper surface .",
    "the axions are homogeneous @xmath29 . as a gauge condition",
    ", we choose the temporal gauge @xmath30 we also take an ansatz @xmath31 which is invariant under the diagonal transformation of the spatial rotation so(3 ) and the su(2 ) gauge symmetry .",
    "it is known that this configuration is dynamically stable  @xcite .",
    "thus , their field strength  @xmath4  can be deduced as @xmath32 substituting these configurations into the action , we obtain the following background action @xmath33 \\ , \\ ] ] where a dot denotes a derivative with respect to the cosmic time @xmath28 . taking the variation with respect to  @xmath26 and setting @xmath27 after the variation , we obtain the hamiltonian constraint @xmath34 where  @xmath35  is the hubble parameter .",
    "the equations for inflatons and gauge fields read @xmath36 here , we defined @xmath37 the equation for the scale factor  @xmath38   is given by @xmath39 we can expect that  @xmath1  plays a role of inflaton for natural inflation ,  @xmath2  becomes an inflaton for chromo - natural inflation .",
    "we will see that both types of inflation can occur for appropriate initial conditions .",
    "in this section , we discuss an inflationary trajectory of this two - field inflation .",
    "we perform numerical calculations with the following sets of parameters : @xmath40 .",
    "note that this example is not the only way to realize our set - up .",
    "we recall the property of each inflation at first . from the slow - roll equation for",
    "@xmath1  reads @xmath41 this is a conventional single field slow - roll equation .",
    "if natural inflation is dominant , slow - roll parameters in terms of the potential are defined by @xmath42 where  @xmath43  is the second order derivative of  @xmath44  with respect to  @xmath1 . on the other hand , from eqs .",
    "and , slow - roll equations for @xmath2 and the gauge field read @xmath45 chromo - natural inflation happens when the `` magnetic drift '' term ( the coupling term of axion to the gauge sector ) is sufficiently large :  @xmath46  ( note that  @xmath47  during inflation ) .",
    "then diagonalising and for  @xmath48  and  @xmath49 , we obtain the slow - roll equations @xmath50 since  @xmath51  is almost constant during chromo - natural inflation , its value becomes @xmath52 substituting the above value into the first term in the right hand side of eq .",
    ", we can deduce the slow - roll equation for @xmath2 as @xmath53 where we defined the following parameter @xmath54 we show that this parameter is relevant to the chiral instability of gauge fluctuations and plays a crucial role for determining the amount of gravitational waves generated by gauge fields . from these slow - roll conditions , if chromo - natural inflation is dominant , slow - roll parameters defined by the hubble parameter are written by @xmath55 where  @xmath56  is the second order derivative of  @xmath57  with respect to  @xmath2 .",
    "then we find that  @xmath48  can be very small compared to  @xmath58  due to the magnetic drift factor .",
    "in fact , we can approximate @xmath59 where the factor  @xmath60  must be small in order for chromo - natural inflation to occur . when the rate is sufficiently small , the inflationary trajectory of this dynamics is almost along @xmath1 direction .",
    "once the slow - roll conditions for @xmath1 break down , the trajectory goes along @xmath2 direction and chromo - natural inflation occurs . from this feature",
    ", we can roughly estimate the number of e - foldings @xmath61 as a sum of the number of e - foldings for each trajectory : @xmath62 where we defined @xmath63 note that natural inflation becomes dominant during @xmath64 and chromo - natural inflation occurs until @xmath65 .",
    "unfortunately , it is difficult to evaluate @xmath66 analytically because both the dynamics of @xmath1 and @xmath2 are relevant in general .",
    "however , we can estimate @xmath67 from the attractor value and the slow roll equation @xmath68 where  @xmath69 .    here",
    ", we focus on the solutions which realize a natural inflation on cmb scales and a chromo - natural inflation on scales smaller than cmb scales . in general ,",
    "cmb constraints are determined by the dynamics of fluctuations which cross the horizon at 50 - 60 e - folds before the end of inflation , @xmath70 .",
    "so , if adiabatic scalar fluctuation or its non - gaussianity are almost derived from natural inflation at @xmath70 , that is , @xmath1 is dominant contribution of the potential energy at first , we can choose appropriate background values to suppress chiral gravitational waves without overproducing scalar fluctuations @xcite .",
    "in order to realize such a condition , we consider the inflationary trajectory where @xmath67 is smaller than @xmath70 ; @xmath71 .",
    "practically , we can set @xmath72 zero .",
    "thus , from , we can numerically deduce the condition @xmath73 for the parameters @xmath40 .",
    "fortunately , for small @xmath74 , the number of e - foldings @xmath67 can be estimated as @xmath75^{1/3}}{[\\lambda_{\\omega}\\mu^4\\tilde{\\omega}^3]^{2/3}+[12g^2]^{2/3}}d\\tilde{\\omega } \\notag \\\\                        & = \\dfrac{1}{4}\\left(\\dfrac{12g^{2}\\lambda_{\\omega}^{2}}{\\mu^{4 } } \\right)^{1/3}\\left.\\left[\\log\\left ( 1 + \\left(\\dfrac{\\lambda_{\\omega}\\mu^{4}}{12g^{2}}\\right)^{2/3 } \\tilde{\\omega}(t)^2 \\right ) \\right ] \\right |_{\\tilde{\\omega}_f}^{\\tilde{\\omega}_m } \\notag \\\\                        & = \\dfrac{1}{4}\\left(\\dfrac{12g^{2}\\lambda_{\\omega}^{2}}{\\mu^{4 } } \\right)^{1/3}\\log\\left ( 1 + \\left(\\dfrac{\\lambda_{\\omega}\\mu^{4}}{12g^{2}}\\right)^{2/3 } \\tilde{\\omega}(t_m)^2 \\right ) \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] substituting the parameters into above formula , we actually see inequality @xmath73 holds for achieving the condition @xmath76 .    as to the initial conditions for @xmath1 and @xmath2 , we numerically find that there are many cases for which the inequality @xmath76 holds and natural inflation becomes dominant on cmb scales . in fig.[fig : ini ] , we plotted the region in the space of initial conditions where the conditions @xmath77 and @xmath76 are satisfied .     and @xmath76 under a restriction @xmath78 .",
    "the top blue line represents @xmath79 and bottom blue line is the lower bound which satisfies both @xmath80 and @xmath77 .",
    "hence in the middle white band we can find phenomenologically viable solutions with chiral gravitational waves .",
    ", width=302,height=302 ]    for these cases , we expect that chiral gravitational waves on cmb scales are suppressed and all other observational constraints are satisfied .",
    "in the previous section , we found chromo - natural inflation can take over from the conventional natural inflation .",
    "hence , we expect that sizable chiral gravitational waves are produced in the interesting range of frequencies , which might be detectable by interferometer detectors such as advanced ligo @xcite or kagra @xcite . in this section ,",

    "@xmath122   has no instability and its affect to the metric perturbation is negligible as we show later .",

    "@xmath129   is close to that with no gauge contribution . on the other hand , on smaller scales ,",
    "@xmath129 gets enhanced .",

    "one may worry the stability of scalar fluctuations in chromo - natural inflation @xcite .",
    "however , natural inflation occurs for the first tens of e - foldings in typical cases , hence we would not need to worry about the instability .",
    "remarkably , we can see that @xmath118 gets large value after the end of natural inflation because hubble parameter gets smaller .",
    "therefore , sizable chiral primordial gravitational waves will be produced , which implies the possibility of detecting chiral gravitational waves on small scales .",
    "we can see these features in fig.[fig : metricpert ] . in fig.[fig :",
    "metricpert ] , we plot the time evolution of the amplitude of metric fluctuations at horizon crossing in natural phase and chromo - natural phase , respectively .",
    "note that @xmath117 represents e - folds .",
    "we can see that the amplitude of @xmath131 is nearly the same as the vacuum fluctuation with no contribution of gauge fields , while the amplitude of @xmath129 starts to appear in chromo - natural stage due to the chiral enhancement of gauge fields ( @xmath132 ) .",
    "moreover , we verify that the solution of a metric fluctuation @xmath133 satisfying an equation , where gauge fluctuations @xmath128 satisfy a free equation , is an excellent approximation to the solution of the full equations .",
    "finally , we roughly estimate the density parameter of gravitational waves @xmath134 . in the case of fig . [",
    "fig : metricpert ] , the chiral primordial gravitational waves are produced in the frequency range higher than @xmath0 hz . in the conventional quasi - de sitter inflation , @xmath135 is given by @xcite : @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the dimensionless hubble parameter . in our model ,",
    "the hubble parameter @xmath138 is approximately @xmath139 on small scales .",
    "hence , @xmath140 is about @xmath141 . on the other hand ,",
    "the amplitude of chiral gravitational wave is enhanced by the factor @xmath142 compared to the conventional models ( see fig.3 ) . since @xmath134 is proportional to the square of amplitude of fluctuations , it can be estimated as @xmath143 .",

    "moreover , the density parameter @xmath145 becomes more large in the high frequency region from mhz to khz , which can be observed by various detectors  @xcite such as the space interferometer detector decigo @xcite ( @xmath146 ) , elisa @xcite ( @xmath147 ) , advanced ligo , kagra ( @xmath148 ) , and possibly even by the pulsar timing array ska @xcite ( @xmath149 ) .",
    "it should be stressed that there is a chance to observe chiral primordial gravitational waves  @xcite .",
    "we studied chromo - natural inflation in the axiverse and discussed generation of chiral primordial gravitational waves . concretely speaking , we investigated natural inflation with two axions coupled with a su(2 ) gauge field .",
    "we assumed hierarchy between the axion coupling constants to gauge fields .",
    "note that the coupling constants need not be small , rather one of them should be large so that chromo - natural inflation occurs .",
    "we assumed the axion which has strong coupling constant to the gauge field is energetically sub - dominant initially .",
    "this is natural because there are many axions except for the one with strongly coupled axion .",
    "then , we found that conventional natural inflation commences , continues for tens of e - foldings , and subsequently , chromo - natural inflation takes over from natural inflation .",
    "since the role of gauge fields in the early stage is negligible , we expect that the predictions are in agreement with observations on cmb scales .",
    "thus , we concluded that overproduction of chiral gravitational waves in chromo - natural inflation model can be circumvented in the axiverse .",
    "this is because the parameter of the gauge field @xmath118 is sufficiently small during natural inflation .",
    "we also found that @xmath118 increases in the course of chromo - natural inflation , which implies that chiral gravitational waves are enhanced on small scales .",
    "remarkably , the chiral primordial gravitational waves are produced in an interesting frequency range higher than @xmath0hz , which might be detectable in future gravitational wave observations such as pulsar timing experiment using ska , advanced ligo , elisa , and kagra .",
    "although other mechanisms can also produce chiral primordial gravitational waves  @xcite , since the spectrum of primordial gravitational waves in chromo - natural inflation is distinctive , the observations at several different frequencies will be able to discriminate the chromo - natural inflation with two axions from others .",
    "note that we treated natural inflation with super - planckian decay constant .",
    "however , by using the mechanism in @xcite where a combination of two axions is used , we are able to get an `` effective '' super - planckian decay constant from two sub - planckian decay constants . hence ,",
    "in the context of multi - field extension of natural inflation , our model is phenomenologically viable .    for future work , we need to analyze the spectrum of chiral gravitational waves in detail to compare the predictions with observations .",
    "we should also study scalar perturbations and explicitly check stability of natural inflation with two axions  @xcite .",
    "moreover , we will seek a way to embed the current model into fundamental theory .",
    "we leave these issues for future work .",

    "<S> , we find that for certain initial conditions , conventional natural inflation commences and continues for tens of e - foldings , and subsequently chromo - natural inflation takes over from natural inflation . </S>",
    "<S> for these solutions , we expect that the predictions are in agreement with observations on cmb scales . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , since chromo - natural inflation occurs in the latter part of the inflationary stage , chiral primordial gravitational waves are produced in the interesting frequency range higher than @xmath0hz , which might be detectable by future gravitational wave observations . </S>"
