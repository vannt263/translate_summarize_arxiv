    "even though in the framework of a minimal extended standard model ( sm ) with non - zero neutrino masses the leptonic flavor violation ( lfv ) process is negligible for the smallness of neutrino masses which are experimentally confirmed  @xcite . therefore ,",
    "a direct search for the lfv processes would provide an ideal probe for new physics beyond sm , or in other words any observational anomaly may hint us its existence . besides the @xmath3-factory , since its high energy and luminosity , lhc is definitely the machinery for the exploration .",
    "a search for lfv has been performed by the cms collaboration via two channels @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and a 2.4@xmath6 excess of the branching fraction br@xmath7)@xcite is reported .",
    "if one could account such an excess as an anomaly , there should be some mechanisms which are obviously beyond sm , to be responsible for it .",
    "the type - iii two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) is one of them , because in the model a flavor - violating yukawa interaction exists which may contribute to the lfv at tree level .",
    "the model has been explored extensively  @xcite to study this phenomenological observation .",
    "furthermore , the yukawa interaction contributes to the muon @xmath8 via one loop diagrams and thus would provide a possibility to explain the @xmath9 discrepancy  @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , the flavor - changing yukawa interaction would induce a substantial contribution to the radiative decay @xmath2 , thus the flavor - changing yukawa interaction might be rigorously constrained by the available experimental data  @xcite .",
    "one of the main characteristics of the 21st century is that the cosmology has already become an accurate science and the corresponding observation must be combined with the precise measurements and new discoveries at the facilities on the earth to testify the standing theories .",
    "the identity of dark matter ( dm ) and the interaction which determines the behavior of dm particles are the key point and searching for them is the most challenging job for both experimentalists and theorists of high energy physics and cosmologists .",
    "recently , the fermi large area telescope data show an excess of gamma - ray at energy of a few gev coming from galactic center ( gce )  @xcite . to explain the observation , it is suggested that annihilation of dm particles weighing 30@xmath10 70 gev into @xmath11 is responsible for the gce  @xcite . even though there exist other proposals to explain the excess , such as a population of millisecond pulsars ( msp )  @xcite which might be responsible for gce , it is not easy to explain the energy spectrum and spatial distribution of the gce  @xcite .",
    "thus in this work we discard the astrophysical source explanation  @xcite and focus on the dm scenario .",
    "the dwarf galaxies are considered to be the cleanest sources for detecting gamma rays produced by dm annihilations , thus the data on gamma ray observed at reticulum ii  @xcite may imply existence of abundant dm at our galaxy . to be sure , we need to compute the cross section of dm annihilation in a model of particle physics .",
    "meanwhile other cosmological phenomena must also be concerned , namely the dm annihilation cross section required by the new data should be of the same order as that determined by the thermal dm relic abundance .",
    "however , the original type - iii 2hdm does not provide a natural explanation to the dm particle annihilation cross section .",
    "thus we need to extend the model which can also accommodate the dm annihilation .",
    "it is note that a pseudoscalar could mediate the annihilation of dark matter(dm ) pair , meanwhile due to the small momentum transfer at t - channel , the interaction between the dm particles coming from the outer space and the nuclei in the detector is not affected by the existence of the new pseudoscalar , so that the dm particles may evade the direct search at not - much sensitive detectors .",
    "this idea has been implemented in various models  @xcite .",
    "it further motivates us to consider the dm explanation to the gce , and introduce a dirac fermion field serving as the dm candidate . in this work ,",
    "we introduce a pseudoscalar @xmath12 into the type - iii 2hdm .",
    "the pseudoscalar does not directly couple to the sm particles , but it slightly mixes with the cp - odd higgs which exists in the original type - iii 2hdm , thus it would effectively couple to sm via this mixing . therefore the pseudoscalar can mediate an effective interaction between the dm @xmath13 and the sm fermions @xmath11 .",
    "moreover , its introduction may bring up two more advantages as following :    \\1 .",
    "an extra pseudoscalar would open a new decay channel for the higgs and thus affect the @xmath14 excess .",
    "there could be a mixing of the newly introduced pseudoscalar with the cp - odd scalar @xmath15 in the original type - iii 2hdm , and hence induces a new contribution to the value of @xmath1 .",
    "with increase of the mixing , the contribution of the new pseudoscalar would cancel that of the heavy higgs , thus in this extended model the theoretical prediction on @xmath1 can be decreased to a tolerable level .    in this work",
    "the pseudoscalar also plays a role to explain the @xmath14 excess and the discrepancy between theoretical prediction and data of @xmath1 .",

    "the constraint on @xmath162 is found to be compatible with the parameter space obtained by accounting for the @xmath16 excess .",

    "+ for the not - yet - detected channel @xmath265 , the pseudoscalar primarily decays into @xmath266 , then there should be an additional contribution of the process @xmath267 in the @xmath268 searches @xcite , and the data of the cms experiment @xcite would definitely constrain the coupling between @xmath269 as long as @xmath270 .",
    "the upper bound on the undetected decay of higgs will be further improved as the @xmath11 pair production is measured at the 13 ( 14)tev .",

    "the discovered anomalies by the lhc experiments and observations of the dark matter greatly excite the curiosity of human beings and inspire enthusiasm of searching for new physics beyond standard model .",
    "however , so far , the trend is not very successful . even though we know new physics must be around , but do not know its scale .",
    "direct and indirect search for dark matter , lhc experiments , long - baseline and short - baseline neutrino experiments and numerous lower energy experiments including belle , bes and many others provide hints towards new physics beyond standard model , however at the same time , set more and more rigorous constraints on those models which have been proposed to explain the anomalies observed in astronomy and high energy experiments .",
    "some of the models survive the so - far measurements and many have been ruled out .    in this work , we have extended the type - iii 2hdm by introducing a pseudoscalar @xmath48 which can mediate the dm pair annihilation process . in a recent paper , han",
    "et al.@xcite also extended the 2hdm with an aligned yukawa sector to explain the @xmath1 excess , in comparison , our scheme is somewhat different from theirs .",
    "we not only consider the @xmath1 excess , but also many other constraints from both earth experiments and cosmology . in this framework ,",
    "the lfv process @xmath0 observed at lhc is addressed , the possibility of explaining the muon @xmath8 anomaly , dark matter relic abundance and gce have also been investigated , the role played by the newly introduced @xmath48 is studied in some details .",
    "it is found that there indeed exist certain parameter spaces which can tolerate @xmath16 excess , muon @xmath8 discrepancy and dark matter relic abundance .",
    "with the flavor violating coupling @xmath288 and a tiny mixing between @xmath37 and @xmath38 around @xmath289 , the observation of the @xmath14 excess could be easily accommodated .",
    "the pseudoscalar @xmath48 opens an important undetected decay channel for the sm - like higgs ( @xmath265 ) as @xmath290 , thus affects the branching ratio of @xmath291 .",
    "it also plays a role to explain the discrepancy between theoretical prediction and data of @xmath1 . a smaller @xmath146 and a slightly larger cp - odd @xmath97 mixing @xmath53 helps to interpret the muon @xmath8 anomaly .",
    "increasing the cp - odd higgs mixing angle and @xmath292 increases br@xmath293 , thus would further constrain the parameters space of our model .",
    "the measurement of the branching ratio of @xmath2 sets a stringent bound on the flavor conserving yukawa couplings @xmath184 and @xmath181 , moreover , it determines an opposite sign between the two couplings .",
    "there are parameter regions in our model allowed by the current experimental data of @xmath294 where both the measured @xmath14 excess and the muon g-2 anomaly can be explained .    to account for the dark matter relic density ,",
    "the @xmath97 mixing angle should be of order @xmath295 and @xmath244 is required , however this parameter region does not coincide with that favored by the gce observation if it is postulated that the gce is fully coming from the @xmath13 dm pair annihilation .",
    "this inconsistency may imply that there are other sources to result in the gce besides the pure @xmath13 dm annihilation mechanism .",
    "the lfv process @xmath14 is studied in terms of our model and our prediction on br@xmath296 is qualitatively consistent with that observed by cms and atlas at 8 tev , however to make a decisive conclusion , more data are needed and the lhc run ii of 14 tev should help . a synthesis of data accumulated by high energy collider lhc , the future sppc of 100 tev and maybe some lower energy experiments as well as the new astronomical observation would make the whole picture clearer , then we will be able to judge whether this model indeed works or needs to be further modified . for the case of @xmath287 , the mono - higgs search provide one possible probe of the pseudoscalar .",

    "<S> in this work , we introduce an extra singlet pseudoscalar into the type - iii two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) which is supposed to solve a series of problems in the modern particle - cosmology . with existence of a light pseudoscalar , the @xmath0 excess measured at cms and as well as the @xmath1 anomaly could be simultaneously explained within certain parameter spaces that can also tolerate the data on the flavor - violating processes @xmath2 and higgs decay gained at lhc . within the same parameter spaces , </S>",
    "<S> the dm relic abundance is well accounted . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the recently observed galactic center gamma ray excess(gce ) is proposed to realize through dark matter(dm ) pair annihilations , and in this work , the scenario of the annihilation being mediated by the pseudoscalar is also addressed . </S>"
