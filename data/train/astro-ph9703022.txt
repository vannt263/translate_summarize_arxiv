    "knowledge of the space density of dwarf galaxies in the local universe is of great importance both in its own right , for example to constrain models of galaxy formation and to understand the local distribution of matter , and also in order to interpret observations of faint galaxies .",
    "for quite some time now ( see , for example , the review by ) , galaxy number counts , particularly in blue passbands , have been found to increase faster with apparent magnitude than predicted by simple no - evolution models , whereas the redshift distribution of galaxies in faint surveys _ is _ compatible with no evolution .",
    "various models have been proposed to account for this discrepancy , including a disappearing or fading population of dwarf galaxies ( , , ) , non - conservation of galaxy numbers through merging ( , , ) or adoption of a non - zero cosmological constant ( ) . the automated plate measurement ( apm ) galaxy number counts of show a factor of two higher counts at @xmath3 than expected from a no - evolution model , thus further exacerbating the discrepancy between observed number counts and redshift distributions .",
    "other authors , however , ( , , ) , have suggested that modifying the assumptions going into the no - evolution models can help reconcile the observed number counts and redshift distributions , without resorting to exotic evolution models or non - standard cosmologies . in particular , no - evolution models have traditionally assumed a form for the luminosity function with moderate faint - end slope , eg .",

    ", there have been few measurements of the shape of the local field galaxy luminosity function at such low luminosities . measured an apparent upturn in the luminosity function ( lf ) at @xmath9 for galaxies at @xmath11 . however , he used the @xmath12 method to compute the lf , and so it is subject to bias due to an inhomogeneous distribution of a very small number of galaxies .",
    "a similar caution should be applied to the results of , whose lowest - luminosity measurement is anyway consistent with a flat faint - end schechter function due to poisson statistics alone .",
    "the analysis by of the cfa redshift survey shows evidence for an upturn in the lf at low luminosities , although the possibility of a scale error in the zwicky magnitude system makes the amplitude of the faint - end excess uncertain ( but see ) .",
    "probably the best evidence for an upturn in the lf at low luminosities comes from a recent measurement of the galaxy luminosity function from the eso slice project ( ) , who find an excess of galaxies fainter than @xmath13 above their best - fit schechter function .    in this paper",
    "we push the measurement of the field galaxy luminosity function to fainter limits than previous work by counting the statistical excess of faint ( @xmath14 ) galaxies in the apm galaxy survey seen in projection around local galaxies at known distance in the stromlo - apm redshift survey .",
    "the method by which we estimate the luminosity function is described in the following section .",
    "the galaxy samples and the application of the method are described in  [ sec : samples ] and in  [ sec : just ] we justify the use of nearby centre galaxies to measure the faint - end of the galaxy lf .",
    "results are presented in  [ sec : results ] and several tests of our procedure are described in  [ sec : tests ] .",
    "we conclude in  [ sec : concs ] .",
    "given a catalogue containing positions and magnitudes for a large number of galaxies of unknown redshift and a smaller redshift survey in the same area of sky , one can measure the galaxy luminosity function to fainter luminosities than using the redshift survey alone .",
    "the technique used here to measure the abundance of dwarf galaxies relies on the assumption that correlated galaxies seen close in projection on the sky to a galaxy of known distance are also at the same distance .",
    "although we do not know individually which galaxies are correlated , we can statistically determine the numbers of associated galaxies as a function of apparent magnitude , and hence absolute magnitude . repeating this for a large number of centre galaxies",
    ", we can measure a luminosity function with good statistical accuracy at the faint end .",
    "perhaps the most straightforward approach is to count the excess number of galaxies in bins of absolute magnitude out to a fixed projected separation around each centre galaxy , and to sum over centre galaxies .",
    "this approach was employed by , who counted the numbers of galaxies down to @xmath3 from cosmos scans of united kingdom schmidt telescope ( ukst ) plates about centre galaxies taken from various durham redshift surveys , to measure the field galaxy lf over the magnitude range @xmath15 . however , as pointed out by in a slightly different context , such an approach is not very efficient as centre galaxies at small distances contribute little signal but a large number of galaxies to the sum , since nearby a fixed projected separation corresponds to a large solid angle , and so the excess neighbours are dominated by projection effects . for this reason , phillipps and",

    "for centre galaxies , we use the stromlo - apm redshift survey ( ) , which consists of 1787 galaxies with @xmath56 selected randomly at a rate of 1 in 20 from the apm galaxy survey ( maddox  1990a , b ) .",
    "we count apm galaxies around each redshift survey galaxy in five linearly spaced bins of projected separation @xmath17 up to @xmath57 and in 22 evenly spaced bins in apparent magnitude from @xmath58 to 20.5 .",
    "there are a total of 2,389,032 apm galaxies in this magnitude range . in order to correct for survey boundaries and holes",
    "drilled out around bright stars and large galaxies , we use a random catalogue of 3,476,477 random points uniformly distributed over the area of the apm survey .",

    "this is to avoid three biases that might otherwise be caused by a large foreground galaxy : ( 1 ) obscuration of faint galaxies directly behind it , ( 2 ) lensing of background galaxies and ( 3 ) break - up of a large galaxy by the apm machine into spurious sub - images , artificially boosting the apparent number of projected neighbours .",
    "the worst of these latter cases have already been removed by the `` holes '' drilled around large images during the construction of the apm survey ( , maddox  1990a ) .",
    "the majority of galaxies in the stromlo - apm survey have @xmath59 isophotal major diameters of 20 - 100 arcsec .",
    "we assume a power - law form for the spatial correlation function , @xmath60 , with @xmath61 and @xmath62 ( ) .",

    "we store the @xmath54 calculated for each centre galaxy by projected separation bin and _ apparent _ magnitude bin in order to avoid incompleteness effects which would otherwise result if we used _",

    "the consistency of the estimates @xmath21 for a range of projected separations will provide important confirmation of our results .",
    "before we present the results of this analysis , we first justify our assumption that excess faint galaxies seen close in projection to nearby redshift survey galaxies really are physically correlated .",
    "the apm galaxy survey has a magnitude limit of @xmath3 , corresponding to a limiting depth for @xmath65 galaxies of @xmath66 , whereas galaxies of absolute magnitude @xmath67 can only be seen out to a distance of @xmath68 .",
    "one might therefore wonder whether fluctuations in the number of uncorrelated background galaxies might swamp the contribution from genuinely correlated dwarf galaxies for nearby centres .",
    "we therefore perform a simple experiment to show that the number of apm galaxies counted to various magnitude limits is systematically larger close to a nearby centre galaxy than in a random control field .    taking in turn those @xmath69 galaxies in the stromlo - apm survey that are closer than @xmath16 as centres , we count the number of apm galaxies ( @xmath70 ) within a projected separation of @xmath71 and also the number of background galaxies ( @xmath72 ) within the same solid angle at a randomly chosen location .",

    "there is a statistical excess of apm galaxies near centre galaxies .",

    "is the probability from the kolmogorov test that the quantities @xmath70 and @xmath72 come from the same distribution .",
    "we see , particularly for the brighter magnitude cuts , that the distributions @xmath70 and @xmath72 are significantly different , and that the ratio @xmath74 is systematically larger than unity at at least the 4-@xmath17 level . from this test",
    "we conclude that we are justified in assuming that the excess apm galaxies seen close to stromlo - apm centre galaxies are physically correlated , even for centre galaxies much closer than the characteristic depth of the apm galaxy survey .",

    "this plot also shows ( as the continuous line ) our earlier schechter function fit to @xmath21 using the redshift survey galaxies alone ( ) plus its extrapolation to lower luminosities ( dotted line ) . comparing with the earlier result , we see three regimes .",
    "( 1 ) for @xmath82 , we see good agreement with the schechter function . ( 2 ) for @xmath83 we see that the new determination of @xmath21 lies @xmath84 _ below _ the schechter function .",
    "( 3 ) at the faintest luminosities , @xmath85 , we see a sharp rise in @xmath21 , rising well above the schechter function . thus there appears to be a significant excess of faint galaxies above a flat faint - end power - law , but we first need to understand why we disagree with our earlier estimate of @xmath21 over the magnitude range @xmath83 .    we believe that this apparent discrepancy is due to the fact that we are really estimating the product @xmath50 and we are assuming that @xmath18 , and therefore @xmath19 , is fixed , ie . _ independent of galaxy luminosity_. in fact , as we showed in an earlier paper ( ) , there is evidence that low - luminosity galaxies are less strongly clustered than @xmath65 ( @xmath86 ) galaxies , and thus we would expect our estimate of @xmath50 to be biased low at low luminosities , as we indeed observe in figure  [ fig : phi](a ) over the magnitude range @xmath83 . this effect was also noted by in their analysis of the distribution of satellite galaxies .",
    "the variation of clustering strength with luminosity is too poorly known to attempt to correct the @xmath21 estimate shown here .",
    "in fact , the present data provides probably our best constraints on how @xmath19 varies with luminosity .    by absolute magnitude",
    "@xmath87 another effect is dominating : either the luminosity segregation reverses ( such that @xmath88 galaxies are _ more _ strongly clustered about @xmath65 galaxies than other @xmath65 galaxies ) and/or the intrinsic space density of dwarf galaxies is significantly higher than predicted by extrapolation of a flat faint - end schechter function . as we will see below",
    ", the latter seems a more likely explanation for the observed excess of faint galaxies near @xmath89 galaxies .",
    "it also has the attractive feature of helping to explain the observed steep number counts of faint galaxies compared with traditional no - evolution models .",
    "figure  [ fig : phi](a ) showed our estimate of @xmath21 after just one iteration , ie . assuming that the true luminosity function is a flat faint - end schechter function .",
    "thus the steep faint - end is not due to an instability in our iteration procedure .",
    "figure  [ fig : phi](b ) shows our estimate of @xmath21 after ten iterations , by which time the solution has converged .",
    "we see that the faint - end slope has steepened slightly further . to model the observed @xmath21 ,",
    "we have fitted a modified form of the schechter function , with an additional faint - end power law : ( l ) = ^ * ( ) ^ ( ) .",
    "[ eqn : dpschec ] in this formulation @xmath90 , @xmath65 and @xmath91 are the standard schechter parameters , @xmath92 is a transition luminosity between the two power - laws and @xmath93 is the power - law slope of the very faint - end .",
    "no physical interpretation is intended by this choice of formula , it is merely a convenient way of modeling the observed @xmath94 over this extended range of luminosity and for estimating the faint - end slope .",
    "the line in figure  [ fig : phi](b ) shows our best - fit `` double power - law '' luminosity function , which has parameters : @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 . although this fit is poor over the range @xmath100 , our @xmath21 estimate is almost certainly biased low over this range by the weaker clustering of galaxies fainter than @xmath65 . clearly , the faint - end slope @xmath99 can not extend to indefinitely low luminosities , but it shows no obvious signs of flattening brightward of @xmath101 .",
    "in the preceding section we presented results based only on counts of neighbouring galaxies at a projected separation of @xmath81 . by increasing @xmath17 one decreases shot - noise errors by increasing the total number of neighbours , although now a smaller fraction of these neighbours will be genuinely correlated with the centre galaxy .",
    "figure  [ fig : sigtest ] shows our estimate of @xmath21 if we count galaxies to a projected separation @xmath102 ( solid symbols ) and @xmath103 ( open symbols ) .",
    "we see that the estimated @xmath21 is insensitive to the limiting @xmath17 used , except that the deficit at @xmath104 worsens as the maximum projected separation increases , and the error bars increase .",
    "this is to be expected from our earlier results on luminosity segregation , since figure  6 of loveday  ( 1995 ) shows that the weaker clustering of sub-@xmath65 galaxies is more pronounced at scales larger than @xmath71 .",
    "the error bars also increase if we decrease the limiting projected separation to values of less than @xmath105 .",
    "counting neighbours to @xmath106 , as shown in figure  [ fig : phi ] , thus appears to be about optimal for this analysis .",
    "the second test we have performed is to cut back on the magnitude limit to which we count apm galaxies .",
    "there are two reasons for doing this .",
    "the first is that there is some indication that star - galaxy separation is slightly less reliable in the faintest half - magnitude slice of the apm survey than for brighter objects ( ) .",
    "the second is to show that the poor match between volumes sampled by the bright redshift survey and the faint photometric survey does not lead to a systematic bias in the estimated luminosity function . in figure",
    "[ fig : magtest ] we plot the lf estimated by counting apm galaxies to 20th , 19th , 18th and 17th magnitude respectively . in each case",
    ", we see that the estimated lf is consistent with that estimated from the full @xmath14 sample . even cutting back the `` faint '' survey to @xmath107 ( actually slightly shallower than the redshift survey )",
    ", we still see evidence for a steep faint end to the luminosity function .",
    "one should note that the signal contributing to the faint - end of the lf is coming from decreasingly smaller volumes as one cuts back on the magnitude limit .",
    "a galaxy of absolute magnitude @xmath67 can only be seen to distances of 93 , 60 , 39 and 25 @xmath35 respectively for galaxy samples cut to @xmath73 , 19.0 , 18.0 and 17.0 .",
    "the consistency of estimated faint - end slopes using galaxies over this range of volumes argues strongly against the observed steep faint - end slope being due to a `` sampling '' or `` volume '' effect .      as a further test of our methods ,",
    "we have generated two sets of mock - apm surveys with known luminosity function and two - point correlation function , thus allowing us to check that we indeed are measuring the `` true '' luminosity function .",
    "the first set of simulations ( `` sch '' ) has galaxy luminosities drawn from a flat faint - end schechter function ( @xmath108 , @xmath109 ) .",
    "the second set ( `` dp '' ) has a `` double power - law '' function of the form ( [ eqn : dpschec ] ) with parameters @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 . the idea is to check that our method for estimating @xmath21 can reliably distinguish between these two models .    for each model we generated five hierarchical clustering simulations , each containing 2.4 million galaxies in the area of the apm survey .",
    "from each of these mock apm surveys , we formed mock stromlo - apm redshift surveys by sampling one galaxy in 40 brighter than @xmath112 at random .",
    "note that the sparser sampling rate compared with the real data ( 1 in 20 ) is required to match the numbers of galaxies in the faint apm galaxy survey and the brighter redshift survey sample .",
    "this reflects the steep slope seen in the apm number counts by maddox et al ( 1990c ) but not modeled in the simulations .",
    "the mock redshift surveys contained on average 1648 galaxies each , and the measured real space galaxy correlation function was well described on scales 120 @xmath35 by a power - law with parameters @xmath113 and @xmath114 for the `` double power - law '' simulations , and with @xmath113 and @xmath115 for the schechter function simulations , thus providing an excellent match to the observed real - space clustering of stromlo - apm galaxies ( loveday  1995 ) .",
    "we analysed the simulations in the same way as the real data ; counting galaxies in the mock - apm survey about centre galaxies in the respective mock - stromlo survey . in figure",
    "[ fig : phi_sim](a ) we plot the mean @xmath21 measured from the five `` dp '' simulations as the symbols ; the error bars show the one - sigma scatter between the realizations .",
    "these error bars are in good agreement with the errors estimated from equation  ( [ eqn : phi_errs ] ) . also shown",
    "are the individual estimates ( dashed lines ) and the true luminosity function ( continuous line ) .",
    "we see that the mean estimated @xmath21 is in reasonable agreement with the true lf : if anything we tend to _ underestimate _ the slope of the faint - end of the luminosity function .",
    "we also see that estimates from the individual simulations can differ significantly from the true lf : two of the estimates show a _ decrease _ in @xmath21 faintward of @xmath116 .",
    "this lack of robustness in the individual estimates of the lf is also apparent in figure  [ fig : phi_sim](b ) , where we plot the results from the `` sch '' simulations .",
    "although the mean @xmath21 is consistent with a flat faint - end , and inconsistent with the double power - law function shown , two of the estimates do show an apparent rise above the expected flat faint - end slope . neither",
    ", however , maintains the rise as faint as @xmath101 .",
    "overall , although individual simulations can show a wide deviation from the expected behaviour , it seems that we are more likely to underestimate rather than overestimate the faint - end slope of the luminosity function , and hence the space density of dwarf galaxies .",
    "our estimated errors are in good agreement with the scatter between simulations .",
    "we have seen that the number of dwarf ( @xmath85 ) galaxies seen close in projection on the sky to @xmath89 galaxies ( @xmath117 ) is much larger than expected for a flat faint - end schechter function and for the standard galaxy correlation function ( @xmath118 , @xmath119 ) .",
    "we may thus infer that the space density of galaxies rises sharply above a flat faint - end schechter function for @xmath85 and/or that the clustering of dwarf galaxies around @xmath89 galaxies is much stronger than the auto - correlation function of @xmath89 galaxies .",
    "an extreme case of the latter explanation might be that dwarf galaxies _ only _ exist close to @xmath89 galaxies .",
    "it is no easy matter to determine which ( or both ) of these explanations is correct .",
    "since all of the @xmath85 dwarf galaxies must lie within @xmath120 to be visible in the apm survey , even if there is a generally higher space density of dwarfs , they have a relatively minor ( @xmath121 ) effect on total predicted number - counts in the survey .",
    "however , one can place a lower limit on the space density of dwarf galaxies by making the extreme assumption that they only exist close to @xmath89 galaxies . in fact , in figure  [ fig : sigtest ] , we see an excess of dwarf galaxies up to a projected separation of at least @xmath57 from @xmath89 galaxies . thus a lower limit may be estimated by assuming that they occur with the measured space density only within @xmath57 of an @xmath89 galaxy",
    ". the lower limit on the average mean density of dwarf galaxies is then given by multiplying their measured space density by the fraction of space within @xmath57 of an @xmath89 galaxy . in order to estimate the filling factor of @xmath89 galaxies in the local universe ,",
    "we have generated another set of five soneira - peebles simulations within a cubic volume @xmath16 on a side and without applying a selection function .",
    "these simulations contain 47,000 galaxies each , and thus their space density is @xmath122 , as measured for @xmath89 galaxies in the stromlo - apm survey ( loveday  1992 ) .",
    "additionally , the two - point correlation function of galaxies in these simulations is set to be well fit by a power - law with @xmath123 and @xmath124 , in good agreement with the clustering measured by loveday  ( 1995 ) .",
    "given these simulations , it is then simple to perform a monte - carlo calculation of the volume inside each cube within @xmath57 of an @xmath89 galaxy .",
    "we find that this factor lies in the range 0.570.62 , ie . a randomly chosen point in space",
    "has a 60% chance of lying within @xmath57 of one or more @xmath89 galaxies .",
    "now , integrating the luminosity function plotted in figure  [ fig : phi](b ) between @xmath125 and @xmath126 yields a measured density of dwarf galaxies of @xmath127 . correcting this by the extreme assumption that dwarf galaxies are only found within @xmath57 of an @xmath89 galaxy results in a _ lower limit _ on the space density of dwarf galaxies of @xmath128 .",
    "this is a factor of two higher than the density @xmath129 inferred from the @xmath130 schechter function fit by loveday  ( 1992 ) .",
    "in fact , the true space density of dwarf galaxies is likely to be significantly higher than this , for a number of reasons .",
    "first , our estimator assumes that galaxy clustering is independent of luminosity , whereas we know that sub-@xmath65 galaxies are less strongly clustered than more luminous galaxies ( eg . loveday  1995 ) .",
    "if this luminosity segregation extends to dwarf galaxies , then we will have underestimated their space density .",
    "second , analysis of simulations (  [ sec : sims ] ) shows that our estimator tends to underestimate the faint - end slope of @xmath21 slightly , possibly due to a malmquist - type bias .",
    "third , as discussed by numerous authors , most galaxy surveys are likely to be missing a substantial fraction of low surface brightness galaxies , many of which will be dwarfs .",
    "for example , find a pronounced upturn in the luminosity function for their sample of low surface - brightness galaxies .",
    "thus we regard our above estimate of the space density of dwarf galaxies , @xmath128 , as a _ lower limit _ on the true value .",
    "a high space density of dwarf galaxies , assuming that they are predominantly late - type , blue galaxies , which suffer smaller @xmath6-correction dimming than redder , early - type galaxies , provides a natural explanation for the steep observed number counts of faint galaxies .",
    "evidence for a large contribution from late - type galaxies to the faint galaxy counts in the hst medium deep survey has been presented by .",
    "zucca  ( 1997 ) have found that the luminosity function for emission - line galaxies ( elgs ) is significantly steeper at the faint end than the lf for non - elgs , also supporting the hypothesis that the faint - end of the galaxy lf is dominated by late - type galaxies .",
    "gronwall and koo ( 1995 ) were able to match observations of galaxy number counts in the @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 bands , as well as colour and redshift distributions , for a mild evolution model by assuming that the faint end of the galaxy luminosity function is dominated by blue galaxies ( @xmath10 ) , and rises significantly above a schechter function with flat faint - end slope .",
    "we plot the gronwall & koo model total luminosity function in figure  [ fig : phi](b ) , and see remarkably good agreement with our observations .",
    "our results thus support the model of gronwall & koo ; there is no need to invoke exotic forms of galaxy evolution to explain observed galaxy number counts at faint magnitudes .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank my colleagues george efstathiou , steve maddox , bruce peterson and will sutherland , who made the apm and stromlo - apm surveys possible . the simulations used in this paper",
    "were carried out using computing facilities at the fermi national accelerator laboratory .",
    "the referee , chris impey , is thanked for his comments which have ( hopefully ) helped make these results more convincing .",
