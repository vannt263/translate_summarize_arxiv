    "there has been much success in modeling the medium created in collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) as a fluid .",
    "first the equations of ideal hydrodynamics were used with surprising success , indicating that the collision fireball appeared to behave like a nearly perfect liquid @xcite .",
    "more recently , this ideal hydrodynamical description has been generalized to viscous hydrodynamics in an effort to quantify dissipative corrections to perfect fluid behavior@xcite ]    the results of these simulations are , of course , sensitive to the initial conditions that are implemented for hydrodynamic evolution , which are a topic of much study .",
    "however , the results can also be sensitive to the prescription used to describe the cessation of hydrodynamic behavior once the system has become dilute ( `` freeze out '' ) .",
    "this freeze out prescription must describe the spectrum of particles that comes from a particular piece of fluid when it decouples . in principle",
    "this distribution is obtained from a kinetic description of the system at freeze out , which for a viscous fluid is of the form @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the equilibrium distribution and @xmath4 is a small correction .",
    "the exact form of @xmath4 , however , depends on the particle system in question . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , until recently ( at least in the case of vanishing bulk viscosity ) , all groups have made the assumption that @xmath5 .",
    "however , there is no particular reason to believe that this is the correct momentum dependence for the system of hadrons and resonances at freeze out in a relativistic heavy ion collision .    in this article",
    "we use viscous hydrodynamic simulations to investigate the effect of using different forms for @xmath4 on calculated observables in the absence of bulk viscosity and baryon chemical potential .",
    "we find that experimental data , especially @xmath0 , can be used to constrain @xmath4 , in principle giving information about the dynamics of the hadron resonance gas present at freeze out .",
    "if a system is near thermal equilibrium , it is useful to write its energy - momentum tensor as a sum of a locally isotropic ( ideal fluid ) part @xmath6 , and a viscous correction @xmath7 .",
    "if , following landau , we define the local rest frame as the zero momentum frame @xmath8 , we can write the result in terms of the four - velocity @xmath9 of this local rest frame with respect to some fixed lab frame : @xmath10 here @xmath11 is a projector onto the space orthogonal to @xmath9 , while @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the energy density and pressure in the local rest frame .",
    "the viscous tensor @xmath7 is symmetric and transverse to the fluid velocity : @xmath14 .",
    "it is typically broken into a traceless shear tensor @xmath15 and a term proportional to the trace , the bulk pressure @xmath16 . to first order these terms are proportional to the shear viscosity @xmath17 and bulk viscosity @xmath18 , respectively",
    ": @xmath19 the equations of viscous hydrodynamics then follow from the local conservation of energy and momentum @xmath20 any other conserved quantity  such as baryon number  will have its own conservation equation and transport coefficients , but will be neglected here .",
    "along with the equation of state of the particular system in question @xmath21 and the specified form of the viscous tensor ( in principle including the temperature dependence of the transport coefficients ) , this uniquely specifies the evolution of a viscous fluid .",
    "to model the breakdown of hydrodynamic behavior once a system has become cool and dilute , one must define a freeze out process .",
    "this is done by taking a given fluid cell ( once it meets some predefined criteria such as reaching a certain temperature @xmath22 ) and converting it into a distribution of particles @xmath3 given by kinetic theory . in the standard cooper - frye prescription ,",
    "these particles undergo no further interaction , and the finally observed particle spectrum is given by integrating this distribution over the freeze out surface @xmath23 : @xmath24 where we have summed over the contribution from different particle species @xmath25 with degeneracy @xmath26 .",

    "gives yet another constraint .",
    "recall that in the local rest frame we must also have @xmath38 .",
    "in particular , when we demand the landau matching condition to be satisfied @xmath39 , we find @xmath40 which puts a nontrivial constraint on @xmath41 when @xmath42 .",

    "investigating @xmath41 is left to future work . in the following",
    "we will only concern ourselves with the case of vanishing bulk pressure , where @xmath41 plays no role .",
    "in contrast to @xmath41 , there is no constraint on the functional form of @xmath44 , which is related to the more standard notation @xmath45 by  @xcite @xmath46\\chi(p ) .",

    "the relevant cross sections here are hadronic cross sections , since freeze out occurs in the hadronic phase .",
    "let us estimate the typical energy of a hadronic collision at freeze out , which will indicate the relevant energy regime of these hadronic cross sections . in the above equation",
    ", @xmath13 denotes the momentum of the hadron in the rest frame of the fluid . if the hadron momentum is parallel to the fluid momentum , @xmath58 , where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the transverse momentum and transverse mass in the lab frame , and @xmath61 .",
    "the fluid velocity in realistic hydrodynamic simulations reaches values as large as @xmath62 .",
    "an observed pion with @xmath59 in the range 14  gev comes from a part of the freeze out surface that has a fluid velocity that is parallel to its momentum and is near this maximum @xmath63 .",
    "the momentum in the fluid frame @xmath13 is significantly smaller  it is in the range 0.41.7  gev ; a collision with a thermal pion at @xmath64  gev then occurs at @xmath65 in the range 0.41  gev .",
    "hadronic cross sections have a nontrivial dependence on @xmath65 in this range .",
    "ultimately , a consistent description of heavy - ion collisions using viscous hydrodynamics should implement realistic hadronic cross sections , but this is beyond the scope of the present paper ; the linearized boltzmann equation is an integral equation that is nontrivial to solve even for relatively simple systems .",
    "however , one can gain insight on how @xmath45 depends on the cross section by studying the limit where the momentum @xmath13 is much larger than the temperature @xmath66 .",
    "this limit is relevant to the study of anisotropic flow ( @xmath67 and @xmath68 ) at large transverse momentum @xmath59 ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : results ] ) . in this limit ,",
    "outgoing momenta @xmath69 and @xmath70 are essentially parallel to @xmath71 , so that @xmath72 , and eq .",
    "( [ linboltz2 ] ) simplifies to @xmath73 if @xmath45 is a power law at large momentum @xmath13 , @xmath74 with @xmath75 , one can neglect @xmath76 in the right - hand side .",
    "the energy of the collision in the center of mass is of order @xmath77 . by simple power counting , eq .",
    "( [ linboltz3 ] ) then implies that the cross section varies with @xmath78 like @xmath79 .",
    "the quadratic ansatz @xmath80 solves the boltzmann equation at large momentum only if the cross section decreases like @xmath81 .",
    "this is the case for , e.g , @xmath82 theory  @xcite , but not for hadrons in the relevant range of @xmath65 , where hadronic cross sections rather _ increase _ with @xmath65 .",
    "we would like to investigate the effect of using various forms for @xmath4 at freeze out . to do this ,",
    "we implement a 2 + 1 dimensional conformal viscous hydrodynamic model with both glauber- and cgc - type initial conditions , a constant value of @xmath83 , a realistic equation of state , and a cooper - frye freeze out prescription including resonance feed down .",
    "all parameters are taken from the best fit results from ref .",
    "@xcite , to which we refer the reader for all relevant details .",
    "the only change here is to replace the quadratic ansatz for @xmath4 ( @xmath84 ) with two other simple choices : a linear ansatz ( @xmath85 ) , and a power law in between linear and quadratic ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "it has been argued @xcite that the correct momentum dependence for @xmath4 is expected to lie somewhere within this range . for each case , the same form of @xmath4 is used for all particles at freeze out ( using a boltzmann equilibrium distribution , ignoring quantum statistics ) , with the overall temperature dependent normalization @xmath87 then fixed by the generalization of eq .",
    ": @xmath88 note that , in principle , even with the same momentum dependence , different particle species in a particular system could have different size contributions to the shear tensor ( see , e.g. , sec .",
    "iv of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , but this possibility is not investigated here .    all hadrons and resonances up to @xmath892 gev are calculated , with unstable resonances then allowed to decay after freeze out .",
    "+   +    given the restriction of eq .  , any observable that is integrated over transverse momentum will be largely insensitive to the choice for @xmath4 .",
    "we found this to be true in our calculations for , e.g. , @xmath90 and multiplicity .",
    "however , the momentum dependence of differential quantities such as @xmath1 and @xmath91 can strongly depend on this choice .",
    "figure [ v4 ] shows differential @xmath67 and @xmath0 for charged hadrons from our viscous hydrodynamic calculations as compared to experimental data from phenix at rhic . as was found previously  @xcite , @xmath67 below @xmath92 gev is largely unchanged for a range of reasonable choices for @xmath4 . at larger @xmath59 , however , it can change the shape of the curve significantly . a stronger momentum dependence results in a larger viscous correction  and thus a larger deviation from ideal hydrodynamic behavior  at larger momentum .",
    "in contrast , @xmath0 depends strongly on the choice for @xmath4 even at smaller momentum .    as can be seen in the plots for @xmath67 in fig .",
    "[ v4 ] , the shape of the @xmath67 curve depends on a combination of viscosity and the choice for @xmath4 , while the normalization depends mostly on initial eccentricity and viscosity .",
    "experimental data appear to favor a comparatively large initial eccentricity , such as can accommodate a viscosity of order @xmath93 , while the favored @xmath4 depends on this viscosity value .",
    "a linear ansatz seems unlikely , while a stronger momentum dependence works well .",
    "the curve for @xmath0 , on the other hand , favors a weak momentum dependence .",
    "the quadratic ansatz in particular is quite difficult to reconcile with the very flat experimental data  at least for @xmath94 and/or for more peripheral collisions .",
    "a @xmath4 with a stronger momentum dependence also results in a strong impact parameter dependence , which is not seen in data ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , while a linear ansatz results in a dependence on impact parameter that is even smaller than is seen from ideal hydrodynamics . note that for any choice of @xmath4 , the magnitude of @xmath0 is somewhat smaller than the experimental data , even after correcting for the estimated effect of eccentricity fluctuations and especially for cgc - type initial conditions .",
    "this could be due to the presence of additional fluctuations or differences in the initial energy density profile , and this is not yet fully understood .",
    "the shape of the curve as a function of @xmath59 , however , is not sensitive to these aspects of the calculation and is largely determined by the viscous correction ( in conjunction with the freeze out temperature )  @xcite . in addition , both star and phenix find a flat @xmath59 dependence , though at different values .",
    "it therefore appears that systematic errors in the experimental data may affect the magnitude of @xmath0 , but are unlikely to strongly affect the shape .",
    "thus , it is mostly the shape of the curve that matters here , and this is what provides the constraint on the viscous correction , clearly showing a preference for a momentum dependence that is weaker than quadratic .",
    "thus , data as well as theoretical considerations point to something between the linear and quadratic ansatz .",
    "one should refrain from trying to extract a precise value from the finer details of fig .",
    "[ v4 ] , however , since certain details could change with an improved treatment . for example , our model uses a simple cooper - frye freeze out prescription with simultaneous chemical and kinetic freeze out , and the initial conditions are still quite uncertain ( hence the use of two different types of initial conditions ) , and so not all the physics is perfectly captured . even within our model , an interplay with freeze out",
    "temperature could change which exact @xmath4 is most favored by @xmath0 data @xcite .",
    "in addition , hydrodynamic results in general have uncertain applicability at large @xmath59 . as @xmath59 increases",
    ", there is an increased probability that other physics is coming into play and one should have less confidence in hydrodynamic calculations .",
    "nevertheless , it is clear that the uncertainty involved in the correct form for @xmath4 has potentially measurable effects .",
    "further improvements in hydrodynamic calculations could therefore potentially give valuable information about the microscopic dynamics at freeze out by comparing to data .",
    "conversely , theoretical progress from the microscopic side could give information about where the validity of the hydrodynamic description starts to break down .",
    "it has been thus far unclear what is the correct form for the viscous correction to the equilibrium distribution function used at freeze out in viscous hydrodynamic calculations of heavy ion collisions .",
    "we investigated the effect of various reasonable choices for @xmath4 in addition to the standard quadratic ansatz on the resulting differential elliptic flow @xmath95 as well as the higher - order harmonic @xmath96 and compared to experimental data .",
    "the quadratic ansatz is strongly disfavored by rhic data , with the most likely form lying somewhere between linear and quadratic .",
    "specifically , data for @xmath0 favor a weak momentum dependence in @xmath4 both from the shape of the curve as a function of @xmath59 , as well as the centrality dependence .",
    "data for @xmath1 favor a stronger - than - linear momentum dependence in @xmath4 , but the precise best - fit choice is viscosity dependent .",
