    "coherent electron transport through nanostructures in cryogenic two - dimensional electron gas systems is inherently a quantum mechanical phenomenon .",
    "several experiments have demonstrated certain aspects of this quantum behavior , whether it relies directly on the wave nature of the electron and can be probed through a current or conductance measurement ( _ e.g. _ , quantized resistance in the quantum hall effect @xcite , conduction modes of a quantum point contact @xcite ) , or on the particle nature and quantum statistics of the electrons and can be probed through a noise measurement ( _ e.g. _ , hanbury brown and twiss - type experiment @xcite , electron collision @xcite , observation of the fractional charge in the fractional quantum hall effect @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , 2d electron gases could be used to study the fundamental non - local features of quantum mechanics through electron entanglement @xcite .",
    "all these experiments can be successfully explained within the coherent scattering formalism @xcite , a theoretical tool describing coherent and non - interacting electron transport .",
    "this formalism relies on spin - independent stationary states in the leads of the device and , therefore , describes spin - independent transport .",
    "although it is possible to add a local spin - dependent effect directly in the scattering matrix , it is not possible in general to take into account spin effects occurring over the whole system .",
    "one potentially important spin effect occurring in the leads of the conductor is spin - orbit coupling .",
    "any electric field in the reference frame of the laboratory generates a magnetic field in the moving electron reference frame , coupling the electron s orbital degrees of freedom with its spin .",
    "one can find several sources of electric fields in semiconductors .",
    "in three dimensional crystals , the periodic crystal potential generates the dresselhaus effect @xcite , which induces a spin - splitting of the conduction band that is proportional to @xmath0 . in two - dimensional systems , the dominant term results from the asymmetry of the in - plane confining potential .",
    "first introduced by rashba @xcite , this effect causes a spin - splitting @xcite proportional to @xmath1 , and it depends on the strength of the applied electric field .",
    "recently , there has been a growing interest in electronic devices which rely on the spin properties of the electrons .",
    "these spin - dependent devices may be influenced by spin - orbit coupling effects , or may even rely on it as , for example , in a coherent version of a spin - polarized field effect transistor @xcite .",
    "therefore , it may be useful to include spin - orbit coupling in the coherent scattering formalism .",
    "the spin - orbit coupling is governed by the following spin - orbit hamiltonian @xcite , which is obtained using an expansion in @xmath2 of the dirac equation @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the free electron mass , @xmath5 is the momentum operator , @xmath6 are the pauli spin matrices , @xmath7 is the electrostatic potential , and @xmath8 is the gradient operator so that @xmath9 is the electric field .",
    "electron transport in the presence of an electric field results in a spin - orbit effect which couples the electron spin and orbital degrees of freedom through the @xmath10 term . here",
    ", we will neglect the bulk effect arising from the periodic crystal potential ( dresselhaus effect ) and consider only the effect caused by the asymmetry of the confining quantum well ( rashba effect ) , as it is stronger than the dresselhaus effect in most two - dimensional heterostructures @xcite .",
    "let z be the direction of confinement , perpendicular to the plane of motion .",
    "the asymmetry of the confining potential along the z - direction results in a non - zero electric field along the z - axis ( @xmath11 throughout the article , where @xmath12 represents a unit vector in the z - direction ) .",
    "the spin - orbit coupling term of the hamiltonian can be written @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the spin - orbit coupling constant and depends on the strength of the electric field .",
    "it takes values in the range @xmath15 to @xmath16 ev cm for a large variety of systems ( inas / gasb @xcite , inas / alsb @xcite , in@xmath17ga@xmath18as / in@xmath17al@xmath18as @xcite and gaas / al@xmath17ga@xmath18as @xcite ) depending on the shape of the confining well . using the standard effective mass approximation",

    "the final formula for the current operator was found to be identical to the one derived in the spin - independent transport case , but with the spin replaced by the so coupling label , indicating the alignment of the spin on the virtual magnetic field caused by the so coupling .",
    "the main differences introduced by the so coupling then arise in the calculation of the scattering matrix relating the stationary states of so coupling in different leads with different orientations .",
    "the direction of the virtual magnetic field ( and , consequently , the direction of the spin ) depends on the direction of propagation which is different for each lead in general .",
    "therefore , the scattering matrix is shown to mix states with different so coupling labels , and the strength of this mixing depends on the angle between the leads .",
    "the effect of so coupling on the current noise was then investigated in two examples of electron collision . in the unpolarized electron collision example",
    ", it is shown that the so coupling does not modify the noise ; this case is entirely determined by the pauli exclusion principle . in contrast , the polarized case exhibits a contribution to the noise caused by so coupling , which is proportional to the so coupling constant @xmath14 and depends on the angle between the leads .",
    "a polarized electron collision experiment provides , in principle , another way to measure the strength of the rashba splitting energy .",
    "finally , this new formulation of the current operator can be applied to other coherent scattering experiments in which one wants to investigate or incorporate the effects of so coupling .",

    "w. d. o. gratefully acknowledges additional support from muri and the ndseg fellowship program .",
    "in this appendix , we calculate the density of states and show that it does not depend on the so coupling label @xmath90 , as is suggested by the symmetry between the @xmath50 and @xmath51 states in the energy dispersion diagram ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , @xmath216 from eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) we deduce @xmath217 which is independent of @xmath90 .",
    "here , we determine the scattering matrix for the four - port beamsplitter described in fig .",
    "the beamsplitter is very simply approximated by a potential barrier at @xmath218 of length @xmath219 .",
    "the plane is then divided into three areas of different potential ( see fig .  [ fig7 ] ) in which the solution of the schrdinger equation is known .    starting with an incident wave in lead number one , for example",
    ", we can calculate the reflected , refracted , and transmitted waves in lead 3 and 4 , using the continuity of the wavefunction and its derivatives at the beamsplitter interface ( x=0 and x=@xmath219 ) .",
    "for example , let us start with an incident state at energy @xmath106 with momentum @xmath220 in the so coupling state @xmath221",
    ". by the conservation of energy , the reflected wave in lead 3 is a superposition of the states @xmath222 and @xmath223 with @xmath224 the translational invariance of the beamsplitter along the y - axis leads to the conservation of the y - component of the momentum @xmath225 we deduce that @xmath226 , but @xmath227 .",
    "there is dispersion due to the so coupling , leading to an angular separation between the @xmath50 and @xmath51 states after reflection at the beamsplitter ( see fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) .",
    "this angular separation is given by @xmath228 \\neq \\theta_{r + } .\\ ] ] starting with an incident state with so coupling label @xmath51 , the angular separation is @xmath229 \\neq \\theta_{r - } .\\ ] ] in analogy with the the total reflection for incident angles below the critical angle in classical optics , we can even have @xmath230 , leading to a suppression of the reflection in the @xmath50 state for a small enough incident angle .",
    "we note that starting with a mixture of @xmath50 and @xmath51 states in the incident beam of electrons , one could suppress the reflection of the @xmath50 state , thus achieving a polarization of the beam .",
    "although interesting , we will neglect this effect of angular dispersion by considering only non - equilibrium electrons above the fermi energy for which @xmath231 ( as so coupling is small compared to the kinetic energy ) , and important incident angles @xmath232 . in this case",
    "the angular separation is very small ( @xmath233 ) .",
    "the equations of continuity of the wavefunction and its derivative are then much easier to solve , and one can find that the incident , refracted , and reflected waves have the same spin at x=0 , and the refracted and transmitted waves have the same spin at x=@xmath219 . using eq.([eq2 ] ) to find the spin overlap between different leads we find , starting with a @xmath50 incident state , @xmath234\\ ] ] where @xmath235 is the transmitted wave ( into lead 4 ) and @xmath236 the reflected wave ( into lead 3 ) .",
    "as the transmitted wave has the same direction of propagation as the incident wave , there is no mixing of the so coupling states , and we have only the usual transmission coefficient @xmath237 . for the reflected wave ,",
    "the direction is changed and we have to mix the different so coupling states to obtain the same spin as the incident wave on the interface with the beamsplitter . if we start now with a @xmath51 incident state , we find @xmath238 .\\ ] ] the same analysis can be done for an incident state in lead 2 with @xmath239 replaced by @xmath240 .",
