    "furthermore in the considered experiments the detectors and the beam are aligned in the same plane which we account for by the choice of our parametrization of the momentum vectors of the detected particles . since neither the scattered hadron nor the scattered electron will be detected in the experiments , as long as the electrons are treated as distinguishable particles , the dependence of the cross section on their four - momenta has to be eliminated . therefore the three - momentum conserving @xmath100-function is used to eliminate the three - momentum of the final hadron state @xmath101 and energy conservation",
