    "under conditions of high energy density and temperature , produced in ultra - relativistic high energy heavy - ion collisions , lattice qcd calculations predicts the transition from ordinary matter to a de - confined state of quarks and gluons called quark gluon plasma ( qgp )  @xcite .",
    "heavy - flavor quarks , differently from light quarks and gluons , are produced at the early stage of the collision in high - virtuality scattering processes .",
    "they traverse the medium and are expected to be sensitive to its density through the mechanism of in - medium partonic energy loss .",
    "heavy flavours should loose less energy than light - quarks and gluons as a consequence of a mass - dependent restriction in the phase space into which gluon can occur  @xcite .",
    "the nuclear modification factor ( @xmath8 ) of d mesons , obtained by comparing their production in proton - proton and heavy ion collisions , allows to probe the properties of the formed high density qdc medium and the mechanism of in - medium energy loss .",
    "the @xmath9 is defined as : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the yield in a  a collisions , @xmath12 , in a given centrality class , is the average nuclear overlap function calculated via glauber model and @xmath13 is the production cross section of d mesons in pp collisions . in absence of medium effects @xmath14",

    "a comparison with @xmath20 and with shadowing  @xcite calculations is made .",
    "in the following the relevant detectors for the d meson reconstruction are discussed ; a detailed description of the alice apparatus is available in reference  @xcite .",
    "the central barrel detectors are contained in a large solenoid magnet , which provides a field of 0.5  t. the closest detector to the beam axis is the inner tracking system ( its ) .",
    "it is made of six cylindrical layers of silicon detectors with radii between 3.9 and 43.0  cm .",
    "the total material budget for radial tracks in the transverse plane amounts to @xmath21 7.7@xmath22 of the radiation length  @xcite .",
    "its location close to the interaction point together with the low magnetic field of the experiment allow the its to track low @xmath23 hadrons and to improve the momentum resolution of the alice tracking system .",
    "the its is surrounded by the main alice tracking detector , a 510  cm long cylindrical time projection chamber ( tpc ) .",
    "it provides track reconstruction with up to 159 three - dimensional space - points as well as particle identification via specific energy deposit @xmath24 .",
    "the time - of - flight detector ( tof ) , is positioned in the region 377 to 399  cm from the beam axis .",
    "the tof complements the hadron identification capability of the tpc , ensuring an efficient track by track kaon / pion separation up to a momentum of about 1.5 gev/@xmath25 . with the present level of calibration ,",
    "the intrinsic timing resolution is better than 100 ps .",
    "the analyses presented in this paper are based on the pb  pb data sample at centre - of - mass energy @xmath26 tev collected in november 2010 during the first run with heavy - ions at the lhc .",
    "the events were collected with a minimum - bias trigger based on the information of the silicon pixel detector ( spd , @xmath27 ) and the vzero scintillator hodoscopes ( @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) .",
    "the efficiency for triggering hadronic interactions was 100@xmath22 for pb ",
    "pb collisions in the centrality range considered in the analyses .",
    "beam background collisions were removed offline on the basis of the timing information provided by the vzero and the neutron zdc detectors ( located near the beam pipe at @xmath30  m from the interaction point ) .",
    "only events with a vertex found within 10  cm from the centre of the detector along the beam line were used , for a total of @xmath31 collisions .",
    "pb collisions were classified based on their centrality defined in terms of percentiles of the hadronic pb ",
    "pb cross section and determined from the distribution of the summed amplitudes in the vzero scintillator hodoscopes .",

    "the cuts were optimized in intervals of @xmath23 . to further suppress the combinatorial background ,",
    "a particle identification ( pid ) selection based on the specific energy loss in the tpc and on the time - of - flight information provided by the tof detector was developed .",
    "this selection provides a strong reduction of the combinatorial background in the low-@xmath23 region , while preserving most of the d@xmath15 and d@xmath16 signal ( @xmath43 ) . in the d@xmath17 case , for the centrality class 020@xmath22 , in order to cope with the large combinatorial background , a tighter pid cut of @xmath44 level in the tpc was applied .",
