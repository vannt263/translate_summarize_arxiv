    "the main theoretical obstacle in determining the amount of cp - violation that comes from the standard model is related to uncertainties in computing various hadronic quantities .",
    "recent advances in lattice qcd promise very accurate predictions for a wide variety of non - perturbative processes @xcite .",
    "however , substantially improved data are needed to confront these predictions .",
    "the long - lived @xmath8 states are especially well suited for establishing the accuracy of lattice qcd calculations @xcite as well as testing effective theories of the strong interactions , such as potential models @xcite , in the heavy quark sector .",
    "the large data sample of about @xmath9 fb@xmath3 collected recently by the cleo detector in the vicinity of the @xmath0(ns ) ( @xmath10 ) resonances enables us to determine the @xmath8 resonance parameters , such as the leptonic and total decay widths , with unprecedented precision .",
    "the total widths of the narrow @xmath0 resonances below the open - bottom threshold can not be measured directly since their natural widths ( @xmath11 kev ) are much narrower than the collider beam energy spread ( @xmath12 mev ) .",
    "the common indirect method to determine the total decay width ( @xmath13 ) is to combine the leptonic branching fraction ( @xmath14 ) with the leptonic decay width ( @xmath15 ) : @xmath16 @xcite . in practice , assuming lepton universality , the leptonic decay width is replaced by @xmath17 , which can be extracted from the energy - integrated resonant hadron production cross section in @xmath4 collisions , while the leptonic branching fraction is replaced by the muonic branching fraction , @xmath18 ) , which can be measured more accurately than @xmath19 or @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , it is very important to measure @xmath21 precisely in order to determine the total decay widths of the narrow @xmath0 resonances .",
    "the leptonic branching fraction is also interesting in its own right since it represents the strength of the @xmath0 decay to lepton pairs via annihilation to a virtual photon relative to the decay into @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath21 is generally used in determinations of the branching fractions of hadronic and electromagnetic transitions among the @xmath0 states since these decays are often measured by observing the decay of the lower lying resonances to lepton pairs .",
    "in addition , comparing @xmath21 to @xmath19 as well as @xmath20 can provide a check of lepton universality and test the possible existence of new physics beyond the standard model @xcite .    based on previous measurements ,",
    "@xmath21 is established with a 2.4% accuracy for the @xmath0(1s ) @xcite , and a modest 16% and 9% accuracy for the @xmath0(2s ) @xcite and @xmath0(3s ) @xcite , respectively",
    ". this paper reports the measurement of @xmath21 for all three narrow resonances with a much larger data set and a more advanced detector .",
    "the new results enable us to determine the total decay widths of the @xmath0(2s ) and @xmath0(3s ) with better precision .",
    "the data used in this analysis were collected by the cleo iii detector during 2001 - 2002 at the cornell electron storage ring , a symmetric @xmath24 collider .",
    "the analysis relies on the excellent charged particle tracking , electromagnetic calorimetry , and muon identification of cleo iii .",
    "the upgraded tracking system consists of a new 4-layer double - sided silicon vertex detector and a new 47-layer drift chamber @xcite residing in a 1.5 t solenoidal magnetic field .",
    "the csi(tl ) crystal calorimeter and the muon detector system inherited from cleo ii @xcite can identify muons with momentum above 1.0 gev/@xmath25 with high efficiency .    to determine @xmath21 , we measure the @xmath26 decay rate relative to the @xmath27 rate @xmath28 where @xmath29 includes all decay modes of the resonances other than @xmath4 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 .",
    "assuming lepton universality , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath32 , we have @xmath33    the major source of background is non - resonant ( continuum ) production of @xmath30 and hadrons via @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) , respectively , which can not be distinguished experimentally from the corresponding resonance decays . hence , we use continuum data collected at energies just below each resonance to subtract these backgrounds",
    ". then the number of @xmath0 decays to @xmath30 ( or hadron ) is @xmath37 , where @xmath38 scales the luminosity of the off - resonance data to that of the on - resonance data and accounts for the @xmath39 dependence of the cross section .",
    "background contributions from non - resonant @xmath40 , two - photon fusion ( @xmath41 ) , or from radiative return to the lower resonances are less than 0.2% after the off - resonance subtraction .",
    "the remaining backgrounds ( to @xmath30 ) are mainly from cosmic rays , and more importantly from @xmath0(3s ) and @xmath0(2s ) decays to a lower @xmath0 state , in which the lower resonance decays to @xmath30 and the extra particles escape detection .",
    "the decay @xmath42 can also contribute to both the @xmath30 and hadron measurements .",
    "our results are based upon 1.1 fb@xmath3 ( 1s ) , 1.2 fb@xmath3 ( 2s ) , and 1.2 fb@xmath3 ( 3s ) data collected within 2 - 3 mev at the peak of each resonance ( `` on - resonance samples '' ) as well as off - resonance samples which were collected 20 - 30 mev below the resonances and represent 0.19 fb@xmath3 ( below 1s ) , 0.44 fb@xmath3 ( below 2s ) , and 0.16 fb@xmath3 ( below 3s ) .",
    "the scale factors , @xmath38 , between the on - resonance and the corresponding off - resonance samples are calculated from the luminosity measured with @xmath43 process @xcite which , unlike the @xmath24 final state , is not contaminated by resonance decays .",
    "we select @xmath30 events by requiring exactly two oppositely charged tracks , each with momentum between 70% and 115% of the beam energy ( @xmath44 ) , with polar angle @xmath45 , and with opening angle of the tracks grater than 170@xmath46 .",
    "muon identification requires each track to deposit @xmath47 gev in the electromagnetic calorimeter , characteristic of a minimum ionizing particle , and at least one track to penetrate deeper than five interaction lengths into the muon chambers .",
    "we control the cosmic - ray background using the track impact parameters with respect to the @xmath4 interaction point ( beam spot ) . from the location of the point",
    "nearest to the beam spot ( as seen in the @xmath48 plane ) on both tracks we calculate the separation between the two tracks along the beam axis ( @xmath49 ) and in the perpendicular plane ( @xmath50 ) as well as their average distance from the beam spot along the beam axis ( @xmath51 ) and in the perpendicular plane ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "we require @xmath53 cm , @xmath54 mm and @xmath55 .",
    "cosmic events are uniformly distributed in the @xmath51 and @xmath52 variables while the events from @xmath4 collision populate a small area around @xmath56 .",
    "we use a two - dimensional sideband around the signal region to estimate the remaining cosmic - ray background ( fig .",

    "this requirement significantly suppresses the background while the direct muon efficiency changes by less than 1% ( fig .",

    "qed backgrounds ( @xmath65 ) are suppressed by requiring @xmath66 charged particles . in addition , for low multiplicity events with @xmath67 charged tracks , we require the total energy detected in the electromagnetic calorimeter to be more than 15% of the center of mass energy ( @xmath68 ) , and either the total calorimeter energy to be less than 75% of @xmath68 or the most energetic shower to be less than 75% of @xmath44 . to suppress beam - gas and beam - wall interactions we reject events in which the total energy visible in the calorimeter and in the tracking system is less than 20% of @xmath68 .",
    "we also use the event vertex position to reject the beam - related background as well as cosmic rays and to estimate the residual background from these sources .",
    "background to the hadrons from @xmath42 decay is estimated to be ( @xmath69)% , ( @xmath70)% , and ( @xmath71)% for the @xmath0(1s ) , @xmath0(2s ) , and @xmath0(3s ) , respectively , where the uncertainty is dominated by the inaccuracy in the leptonic branching fractions and in themonte carlo detection efficiency .",
    "we determine the hadron selection efficiency for @xmath27 decays from monte carlo simulation of the detector using event generators based on jetset 7.3 and 7.4 @xcite .",
    "the two simulations result in a slightly different selection efficiency and a comparison of the distributions of the selection variables in data and monte carlo suggests that the real acceptance is apparently in between .",
    "hence , we average the two monte carlo efficiencies and assign a relative systematic uncertainty to cover the difference between the two simulations : 1.6% ( 1s ) , 1.2% ( 2s ) and 1.3% ( 3s ) .",
    "uncertainties in the cascade and leptonic branching fractions of the @xmath0 resonances contribute with an additional 0.3% added in quadrature to the total efficiency uncertainty in case of the @xmath0(2s ) and @xmath0(3s ) .",
