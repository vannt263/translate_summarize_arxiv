    "progress in the development of low - temperature detectors has led to breakthroughs in various fields of radiowave detection including radio astronomy  @xcite and submillimeter - wave imaging for geo - environmental assessment  @xcite .",
    "in particular , large detector arrays in a large - aperture system enable faint signals to be detected because the total amount of detected light is large .",
    "this has led to greater scientific achievements in various fields , such as cosmic microwave background radiation measurements  @xcite .",
    "a major challenge in radiowave receiver systems is keeping detectors cool .",
    "various techniques have been developed , e.g. , shading the inside of the aperture using absorptive - type filters with dielectric materials  @xcite , reflective - type filters ( e.g. , metal mesh filters  @xcite ) , or combinations of these . these filters are kept cold using thermal links from the cold stages of a cryocooler or from a general cooling medium .",
    "however , enlargement of the aperture leads to new difficulties , such as in fabricating large - diameter metal mesh filters and in maintaining uniformly cold temperature conditions over absorptive - type filter surfaces .",
    "thermal re - emission from a warm filter then becomes a serious issue .",
    "therefore , a technology that enables large - aperture systems to maintain a cold condition is required .    in this paper",
    ", we propose radio - transparent multi - layer insulation  ( rt - mli ) composed of a set of stacked insulating layers .",
    "the insulating material is transparent to radiowaves but blocks infrared radiation .",
    "the rt - mli leads to a reduction in thermal loads while maintaining a uniform surface temperature .",
    "we measured the basic performance of rt - mli in terms of reduction in thermal load and transmittance .",
    "we also demonstrated its cooling abilities in combination with absorptive - type filters .",
    "a multi - layer insulation  ( mli )  @xcite is a thermal insulation system composed of multiple layers of thin insulating sheets .",
    "mli is a major concept in thermal design and is primarily intended to reduce the heat contributed by thermal radiation .",
    "this technology is commonly used for applications in vacuum conditions , where conduction and convection are significantly reduced and heat radiation dominates .",
    "the principle behind mli is to balance the thermal radiation between layers .",
    "more layers can be added to further reduce radiation losses .",
    ".physical properties of styroace - ii styrofoam at room temperature  .",
    "[ tab : styroace ] [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     we confirmed a significant reduction in the thermal loads passing into the absorbers ( fig .",
    "[ fig : loads_phi200 ] ) .",
    "the lower temperatures achieved in the cryocooler also indicated a reduction in thermal load of the system .",
    "this cryocooler achieved temperatures of 26.5  k and 5.5  k for each stage without any additional load from outside the radiation shield .",
    "the typical heat capacity curve of the cryocooler indicates a significant load reduction of @xmath0  w ( @xmath1  w ) for the first ( second ) stage .",
    "we confirmed that rt - mli is useful to shield the aperture from outside thermal radiation .    :",
    "temperatures attained at each layer as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : layout_of_setup_phi200 ] and table  [ tab : phi200 ] .",
    "[ bottom ] : thermal loads passing into absorbers measured using temperature differences between c and d in fig .",
    "[ fig : layout_of_setup_phi200 ] and table  [ tab : phi200 ] . estimated thermal radiation from the nylon filter",
    "is also shown .",
    "the difference between the measured load and the estimated radiation ( @xmath2  w ) indicates that effects of reflected radiations from the upper layers . a setup that has tight shielding to prevent reflection",
    "is expected to reduce the difference .",
    "[ fig : loads_phi200 ] ]",
    "we developed rt - mli composed of a set of stacked layers of polystyrene foam .",
    "rt - mli reduces thermal radiation while maintaining transparency to radiowaves .",
    "we confirmed both surface temperature uniformity and a reduction in thermal loads .",
    "no anti - reflection coating is necessary .",
    "we also confirmed that rt - mli has high transmittance for radiowaves but blocks infrared radiation .",
    "another advantage of the rt - mli compared with other filter types is that no thermal links are necessary .",
    "we demonstrated the effects of rt - mli in combination with absorptive - type filters in a large - aperture setup ( where the aperture diameter of each filter was 200  mm ) ; low filter temperatures were successfully maintained .",
    "the principle of rt - mli also guarantees application to significantly larger aperture systems , e.g. , those with diameters of a few meters .",
    "we conclude that rt - mli is a useful technology in the cooling of radiowave receiver systems and particularly for the enlargement of a system aperture while maintaining a uniform surface temperature and high - transmittance conditions .",
    "rt - mli can possibly be applied in various fields including radio astronomy , geo - environmental assessment , and radio detection and ranging ( radar ) systems .",
