    "maxwell s demon ( md ) has been a notorious being since its existence could violate the second law of thermodynamics ( slot ) @xcite : the md distinguishes the velocities of the gas molecules , and then controls the motions of molecules to create a difference of temperatures between the two domains . in 1929 , leo szilard proposed the `` one molecular heat engine''(we call szilard heat engine(she ) ) @xcite as an alternative version of heat engine assisted by md .",
    "the md firstly measures which domain , the single molecule stays in and then gives a command to the system for extracting work according to the measurement results . in a thermodynamic cycle",
    ", the molecule seems to extract heat from a single heat bath at temperature @xmath0 , and thus do work @xmath1 without evoking other changes .",
    "this consequence obviously violates the slot .",
    "the first revival of the studies of md is due to the recognition about the trade - off between information and entropy in the md - controlled thermodynamic cycles .",
    "the milestone discovery is the `` landauer principle '' @xcite , which reveals that erasing one bit information from the memory in computing process would inevitably accompany an increasing entropy of the environment . in the she , the erasing needs work @xmath1 done by the external agent .",
    "it gives a conceptual solution for the md paradox @xcite by considering the md as a part of the whole work substance , thus the erasing information stored in the demon s memory is necessary to restart a new thermodynamic cycle .",
    "this observation about erasing the information of the md finally saves the slot .",
    "the recent revival of the studies of md is due to the development of quantum information science .",
    "the corresponding quantum thermodynamics concerns the quantum heat engines ( qhes ) @xcite utilizing quantum coherent system serving as the work substance .",
    "a quantum work substance is a quantum system off the thermodynamic limit , which perseveres its quantum coherence @xcite to some extent , and obviously has tremendous influence on the properties of qhes .",
    "especially , when quantum md is included in the thermodynamical cycle @xcite , the whole work substance formed by the work substance plus md would be off the thermodynamic limit and possesses some quantum coherence .",
    "there are many attempts to generalize the she by quantum mechanically approaching the measurement process @xcite , the motion control @xcite , the insertion and the expansion process @xcite .",
    "however , to our best knowledge , a fully quantum approach for all actions in the she integrated with a quantum md intrinsically is still lack . the quantum - classical hybrid description of the she may result in some notorious observations about md assisted thermodynamic process , which seems to challenge the common senses in physics .",
    "therefore , we need a fully quantum theory for the md - assisted thermodynamics .    in this paper , we propose a quantum she assisted by md with a finite temperature different from that of the system . in this model",
    ", we give a consistent quantum approach to the measurement process without using the von neumann projection @xcite .",
    "then we calculate the works done by the insertion of the movable wall in the framework of quantum mechanics .",
    "the controlled gas expansion is treated with the quantum conditional dynamics .",
    "furthermore , we also consider the process of removing wall to complete a thermodynamic cycles . with these necessary subtle considerations , the quantum approach for the md - assisted thermodynamic cycle will go much beyond the conventional theories about the she .",
    "we show that the system off the thermodynamic limit exhibits uncommon observable quantum effects due to the finite size of system , which results in the discrete energy levels that could be washed out by the heat fluctuation .",
    "quantum coherence can assist the md to extract more work by reducing effective temperature , while thermal excitation of the md at a finite temperature would reduce its abilities for quantum measurement and conditional control of the expansion .",
    "it means that , only cooled to the absolute zero temperature , could the md help the molecule to do maximum work outside .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we firstly give a brief review of classical version of she , and then present our model in quantum version with md included intrinsically .",
    "the role of quantum coherence of md is emphasized with the definition of the effective temperature for arbitrary two level system . in the sec .",
    "iii of main part , we consider the quantum she with a quantum md at finite temperature , doing measurement for the position of the particle confined in a one dimensional infinite deep well .",
    "the whole cycle consists four steps : insertion , measurement , expansion and removing .",
    "detailed descriptions are performed subsequently in the whole cycle of she .",
    "we calculate the work done and heat exchange in every sub - step . in sec .",
    "iv , we discuss quantum she s operation efficiency in comparison with the carnot heat engine .",
    "we restore the well - known results in the classical case by tuning the parameters in the quantum version , such as the width of the potential well .",

    "the demon inserts a piston isothermally in the center of the chamber .",
    "then , it finds which domain , the single molecule stays in and changes its own state to register the information of the system . without losing generality , we assume the demon initially is in the state @xmath2 . finding the molecule is on the right , namely @xmath3 ,",
    "the demon changes its own memory to state @xmath4 , while it does not change if the molecule is on the left @xmath5 . according to the information acquired in the measurement process",
    ", the demon controls the expansion of the domain with the single molecule : allowing the isothermal expansion with the piston moving from @xmath6 to @xmath7 if its memory registers @xmath2 , and moving from @xmath6 to @xmath2 , if the register is on the state @xmath4 . in each thermodynamic cycle , the system does work @xmath8 to the outside agent in the isothermal expansion . in an overall looking , the system extracts heat from a single heat bath to do work , thus it would violate the slot if the md were not treated as a part of the work substance in the she .",
    "however , after the cycle , md stores one bit information as its final state and is in the mixture of @xmath2 and @xmath4 states with equal probability . thus it does not return to its initial state .",
    "landauer s principle states that to erase such a bit of information at temperature @xmath0 requires the dissipation of energy at least @xmath1 .",
    "the work extracted by the system just compensates the energy for erasing the information .",
    "therefore , the slot is saved . in this sense , the classical version of md paradox is only a misunderstanding , due to the ignorance of some roles of the md @xcite .     and @xmath9 and energy spacing @xmath10 .",

    "( i - ii ) an impenetrable wall is inserted at arbitrary position in the potential .",
    "( ii - iii ) the demon measures the state of the system and then record the results in its memory by flipping its own state or no action taken .",

    "( iv - v ) the wall is removed from the potential .",
    ", width=264 ]    in the most of previous investigations about the md paradox , it is usually assumed the system and the md possess the same heat bath .",
    "thus the whole work substance formed by the system plus the md is in equilibrium , and no quantum coherence exists .",
    "if the demon is in contact with a lower temperature heat bath while the system s environment possesses higher temperature @xmath0 , the work needed in the erasing process is smaller than @xmath11 @xcite . under this circumstance",
    ", we actually construct a quantum heat engine with non - equilibrium or an equilibrium working substance work between two different heat baths .",
    "furthermore , when the md is initially prepared with quantum coherence , the quantum nature of the whole work substance results in many exotic functions for qhe .    to tackle this problem , we study here a quantum version of szilard s model with an md accompanying it . in this model ,",
    "the chamber is modeled as an infinite square potential well with the width @xmath7 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : cycle](b ) . and the demon is realized by a single two - level atom with energy levels @xmath12 , @xmath13 and level spacing @xmath10 .",

    "the demon has been in contact with the low temperature bath at the inverse temperature @xmath15 .",

    "for an environment being a mesoscopic system , the number of its degrees of freedom is not so large . under this circumstance , the strong coupling to the md leaves finite off - diagonal elements in the reduced density matrix@xcite .",
    "this remnant of coherence can be utilized to improve the apparent efficiency of the heat engine @xcite . for the demon with coherence",
    ", the density matrix usually reads as @xmath19,\\label{eq : cohe}\\ ] ] where the off - diagonal element @xmath20 measures the quantum coherence .",
    "the eigen - values of the above reduced density matrix represent two effective population probabilities as@xmath21 we can define an effective inverse temperature @xmath22 for the two - level md , namely , @xmath23 the effective temperature @xmath24 here is lower than the bath temperature @xmath25 . as shown",
    "as follows , it is the lowing of the effective temperature of the md that results in an increasing of the heat engine efficiency .    as for the modeling of the chamber as an infinite square potential",

    "the work extracted is not a symmetric function of the insertion piston @xmath48 , namely @xmath171 , as illustrated in fig .",

    "the maximum work can be extracted for a given md s inverse temperature is reached , when @xmath173 where @xmath174 and @xmath175 .",

    "the efficiency of qhe reaches the well - known carnot efficiency @xmath177 , when @xmath178 . at the same time , the total work extracted approaches to zero , namely @xmath179 .",
    "we meet this dilemma , since the measurement results in an imperfect correlation between md and the system .    before concluding this paper",
    ", we draw our attention to two limit processes@xcite again @xmath180 note that taking the two limits in different orders leads to completely different results , the latter being a reflection of the spontaneous symmetry breaking phenomenon .",
    "this difference for the md s initial state results in the different work extracted , namely , @xmath181 the former one means that md actually gets no information about the position of molecule and extracts no work , while the latter one show that md obtains the exact information on the position of the molecule and enables the system to perform maximum work to the outside agent .",
    "the same phenomenon has also been revealed in the process of dynamic thermalization@xcite .",
    "in summary , we have studied a quantum version of she with a quantum md with lower finite temperature than that of the system .",
    "we overall simplified the md as a two - level system , which carries out measurement in quantum fashion and controlling the system to do work to the out - side agent . in this sense ,",
    "the md assisted thermodynamic cycle are clarified as the four steps , insertion , measurement , expansion and removing , which are all described in the framework of quantum mechanics . in each step",
    ", we also consider the special case to restore the well - known results in classical version of she .",
    "we explicitly analyzed the total work extracted and the corresponding efficiency . to resolve the md paradox , we compared the obtained efficiency of the heat engine with that of carnot heat engine .",
    "it is found the efficiency is always below that of carnot since the quantum md is included as the a part of the the whole work substance and its functions are also correctly `` quantized '' .",
    "thus nothing violates the slot .    in comparison with the classical version of she",
    ", the following quantum natures were discovered in the quantum thermodynamic cycles : ( 1 ) the finite size effect of the potential well was found as reason for the non - vanishing work required in the insertion and removing of the middle walls , while the corresponding manipulations could be achieved freely in the classical case ; ( 2 ) the quantum coherence is allowed to exist in the md s density matrix .",
    "it is the decrease of effective temperature caused by this coherence that actually improves the efficiency of she ; ( 3 ) in the measurement process , the finite temperature of md actually results in the incorrect decision to control the single molecule s motion .",
    "this incorrectness decreased the md s ability to extract work . to our best knowledge , even for in the classical case ,",
    "the similar investigation has never been carried out ; ( 4 ) in the whole thermodynamic cycle , the removing process is necessary in returning to the initial state for the whole work substance .",
    "this fact is neglected in the previous studies even for the classical she .",
    "finally , we should stress that the model studied here could help to resolve many paradoxical observations due to heuristic arguments with hybridization of classical - quantum points of views about thermodynamics .",
    "for instance , it could be recognized that the conventional argument about the md paradox only concerns a classical version of md at the same temperature as that of the system .",
