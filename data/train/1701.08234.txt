    "quantum geometrical phase  @xcite , which is proportional to the area spanned in the parameter space but is insensitive to the trajectory followed by the system , has inspired more and more efforts in circuit - based quantum computation and quantum control protocols  @xcite .",
    "an appealing modern application of quantum geometrical phase is non - abelian holonomic quantum computation ( hqc )  @xcite , in which one performs a universal set of unitary transformations , i.e. , quantum logic gates operations via cyclic evolution in a degenerate subspace .",
    "more generally , hqc belongs to the field of quantum state engineering  @xcite .",
    "it is argued that the implementation of quantum gates encoded in a degenerate subspace suppresses the effect of dynamical phase around the given loops in the parameter space .",
    "thus it is not surprising to see that the conventional hqc schemes are based on adiabatic evolution due to its resilience against local fluctuations .",

    "suffer from a dilemma between a long runtime and a good coherence , noting that a loss of coherence can occur due to fluctuations in the control parameters .",
    "non - abelian geometric - phase - based holonomic transformation  @xcite has been recently proposed to demonstrate universal operations for quantum computation in both theory and experiment . as an all - geometric scheme",
    ", it still retains the advantages of the conventional hqc but the evolution speed can be greatly accelerated .",

    "the robustness of hqc , in particular the performance of the unitary transformation over general input states , against classical noise ( fluctuations ) in the control hamiltonian parameters is still under investigation  @xcite . and that would be the focus in this work .",
    "classical noise characterizing small system perturbations can have a dramatic impact on the cyclic time evolution of system as well as the performance of quantum gates which require precisely controlled external driving . in this work ,",
    "we introduce classical noises in the form of stochastic fluctuations in the control parameters  @xcite of a driven hamiltonian of a three - level atom or ion forming a @xmath0-configuration for realizing universal holonomic single - qubit and two - qubit gates .",
    "such fluctuations are often due to imprecise system controls and other unknown environmental influences .",
    "they can be introduced during gate operations or during reading of the results .",
    "then , the output ( resulting ) quantum state under the operation by the perturbed holonomic quantum gate will in general deviate from that under the noise - free unitary transformation .",
    "we study a transformation fidelity for a general input state , which quantitatively measures these deviations .",
    "in particular , we estimate the robustness of the nonadiabatic holonomic transformation and determine the conditions in which the desired state passage can be reliably realized in the presence of classical noise .",
