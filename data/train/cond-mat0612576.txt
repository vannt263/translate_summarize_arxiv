    "we have recently proposed _ _",
    "_ _ @xcite _ _  _ _ to use the dynamical bifurcation of a rf - biased josephson junction as a basis for the amplification of quantum signals .",
    "a bifurcation phenomenon offers the advantage of displaying a diverging susceptibility which can be exploited to maximize the amplifier gain without necessarily sacrifying its bandwidth . among all very low noise and fast solid - state microwave devices ,",
    "the josephson junction distinguishes itself by offering strongest non - linearity combined with weakest dissipation .",
    "however , these characteristics are not by themselves sufficient .",
    "the electrodynamic environment of the junction must also satisfy a certain number of conditions in order for a controllable and minimally noisy operation to be possible . in the recent josephson bifurcation amplifier experiments@xcite ,",
    "the junction was shunted by a lumped element capacitor .",
    "a large capacitance had to be fabricated very close to the junction to minimize parasitic circuit elements , at the cost of severe complexity of patterning and thin - film deposition .",
    "it would be very beneficial experimentally to simply embed the josephson junction in a planar superconducting microwave resonator .",
    "the aim of this article is to establish theoretically the requirements that need to be imposed on the embedding impedance of the junction in order to obtain a bifurcation whose characteristics are suitable for amplification .",
    "the article is organized as follows : after having briefly indicated the connection between a bifurcating dynamical system and amplication , we review the simplest non - linear dynamical system exhibiting the type of bifurcation we exploit , namely the duffing oscillator .",
    "we then describe the parameter space of the oscillator , focussing on the neighborhood of the first bifurcation and discussing why this is the most useful region . having laid the general framework for the analysis of our problem , we then consider the simplest practical electrical implementation of the duffing oscillator , a josephson junction biased by an rf source through an arbitrary microwave circuit .",
    "the notion of embedding impedance is introduced . for concreteness",
    ", we first examine the particular cases where the embedding impedance corresponds to simple series or parallel lcr circuits .",
    "this allows us to formulate the conditions under which the resulting non - linear electrical system can be mapped into the duffing model .",
    "we then examine the arbitrary impedance case , finding that it must correspond to that of a resonator with an adequate quality factor .",
    "we end the article by discussing possible detailed experimental implementations of resonators and a concluding summary .",
    "amplification using a laser , a maser or a transistor is based on energizing many microscopic systems , like atoms in a cavity or conduction electrons in a channel , each one being weakly coupled to the input signal .",
    "the overall power gain of the system , which is determined by the product of the number of active microscopic systems and their individual response to the input parameter , can be quite substantial .",
    "however , noise can result from the lack of control of each individual microscopic system .",
    "this article explores another strategy for amplification which involves a single system with only one very well controlled collective degree of freedom , which is driven to a high level of excitation . here ,",
    "the input signal is coupled parametrically to this system and influences its dynamics .",
    "the best known device exploiting this strategy is the squid@xcite but other devices of the same type have been proposed @xcite .",
    "let us discuss the general question of the gain ( ratio of output to input ) in such a system .",
    "a driven dynamical system such as a squid is governed by a force equation which , quite generally , can be written as    @xmath5    where @xmath6 is the system coordinate , @xmath7 is a periodic external drive pumping energy in the system , @xmath8 a parameter of the system and @xmath9 a function describing its dynamics which is necessarily dissipative since information is flowing away to the next stage of amplification .",
    "we are interested in steady state solution of eq .",
    "( general_amplification ) , in which the energy flowing in from the source is balanced by the energy losses . in the example of the rf squid",
    ", @xmath6 is the total flux through the squid loop , @xmath8 the signal flux , and @xmath10 the external driving flux with a frequency in the mhz range . for the dc squidrf_squid ,",
    "the frequency of the external drive current is @xmath11 and @xmath6 is the common mode phase difference while @xmath8 is the flux through the loop formed by the junctions . in this article",
    "we also consider a josephson - junction - based device like a squid , but it is driven by a rf signal at microwave frequencies to increase speed and does not have intrinsic dissipation .",
    "when we use the dynamical system as an amplifier , we are linking the input and output signals to the parameters @xmath8 and variable @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "specifically , the signal @xmath12 at the input of the amplifier induces a variation @xmath13 . for a small input",
    ", the output @xmath14 of the amplifier will depend linearly on the modification of @xmath6 : @xmath15 .",
    "since we are looking for a maximal signal gain @xmath16 , it is natural to find an operating point where a small change in the parameter @xmath8 is going to induce a large change in the dynamics of the system , provided we can keep all other parameters constant .",
    "the largest susceptibility is found at a saddle - node bifurcation point and it is in the neighborhood of such points that we will operate the amplifier .",
    "the saddle - node bifurcation occurs when the drive parameters exceed certain critical values .",
    "previously , yurke _",
    "et al_. @xcite have studied josephson systems mostly in the regime beneath these critical values . here",
    ", we consider similar systems , but we exploit instead the bistable regime _ beyond _ the critical values and the large susceptibilities accompanying it . in the next section , we examine a simple model exhibiting such a saddle - node bifurcation phenomenon .",
    "one of the most minimal model displaying the bifurcation phenomenon needed for amplification is a damped , driven mechanical oscillator with a restoring force displaying cubic non - linearity .",
    "the equation of this model , often called the duffing linear+cubic oscillator  @xcite , is    @xmath17    where @xmath6 is the position coordinate of the mechanical degree of freedom , @xmath18 its mass , @xmath19 its damping constant , @xmath20 the stiffness constant of the restoring force , @xmath21 the non - linearity parameter . the right handside parameters @xmath10 and",
    "@xmath22 are the amplitude and angular frequency of the driving force , respectively . for completeness",
    ", we have also added on the right handside a noise force term @xmath23 whose presence is imposed by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "it defines , through its correlation function , a thermal energy scale for the problem , but in the following sections , we are going to assume that this scale can be made much smaller than all the other scales in the problem .",
    "the effect of fluctuations will be treated in a latter article .",
    "this simplification made , we can rescale the problem , changing the position and time coordinates , obtaining in the end a three - parameter model    @xmath24    where the dot now refers to differentiation with respect to the rescaled time @xmath25 .",
    "the following equations express the rescaled quantities in terms of the original ones : @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 .    for reasons which will become clear later , we want to consider the low damping limit of such a model and we suppose that the quality factor satisfies @xmath32",

    "the bifurcation phenomenon can be described crudely as follows : if we drive the system below the small oscillation resonance frequency , increasing the drive amplitude slowly , the resulting oscillation will be very small at first .",
    "however , at a certain drive strength , the system becomes unstable and tends to switch to a high amplitude oscillation where it can better meet the resonance condition .    in a quantitative treatment of the weak non - linear regime",

    "its operation as an amplifier has been studied @xcite and used to measure a superconducting qubit jba_and_qubit , lupascu .",
    "the amplification near a bifurcation point is limited by a stochastic dynamical escape process similar to the one observed in dc biased jj .",
    "this process is well studied theoretically in the classical regime where the fluctuations stem from thermal noise dykman_krivoglaz79,dykman_krivoglaz80 .",
    "the quantum regime is not as well understood but important results can be found in @xcite .",
    "the circuit of ref .",
    "@xcite is based on the simplest realization of such an rf biased junction , namely , a parallel lcr circuit .",
    "the resistance was provided by the @xmath190 rf environment , the capacitance was constructed lithographically on chip , and the inductance came entirely from the junction itself .",
    "another approach is to use continuous circuit elements instead of discreet ones such as l s , r s and c s . a resonator structure with low internal loss",
    "can be used to bias the junction .",
    "examples of these can range from a waveguide resonator , a lithographic resonator ( see for _ e.g. _ wallraff ) , or any other resonator geometry . any harmonic of such structure can be used to bias the jj .",
    "the key lies in finding the correct way to couple the jj .",
    "let us discuss briefly a particular implementation , namely , using a coplanar waveguide cavity resonator such as the ones recently used to observe cqed in a solid state system @xcite .",
    "there , a junction can be placed at the center of the transmission line , interrupting its central conductor .",
    "the circuit analysis shows that this corresponds to the case discussed above of a jj biased by a series lcr circuit .",
    "we have successfully fabricated and tested such devices and will discuss the results in a later paper .",
    "in this paper we have presented and discussed the idea of harnessing , for amplification purposes , the bifurcation phenomenon of a driven josephson junction embedded in a resonating circuit .",
    "we have first reviewed the basic mathematics associated with the general saddle - node bifurcation phenomenon using the simplest example of the mechanical duffing oscillator .",
    "we have then applied the corresponding formalism to a simple rf driven lcr electrical oscillator incorporating a josephson junction and found the conditions for observing bistability and a diverging susceptibility .",
    "there are two relevant parameters : the quality factor @xmath1 and the participation ratio .",
    "the latter quantity is necessarily smaller than unity and is a measure of the strength of the nonlinearity provided by the jj , relative to the embedding circuit .",
    "we have found that the product of these two parameters need to be much greater than one in order to provide a convenient operating conditions for amplification .",
    "we have then shown that the same condition applies to a more general resonating structure , with a simple adaptation of the definition of the quality factor and participation ratio to the vicinity of a resonance .",
    "our prescription involves a relatively precise analysis of the microwave circuit of the resonator but can easily be followed with a varieties of geometries since microwave resonators can easily be made to have large quality factors .",
    "later generations of amplifiers or detectors based on the bifurcation of superconducting resonators should therefore benefit from the analysis presented in this article .",
    "we would like to thank d. esteve , d. vion and r. schoelkopf for useful discussions .",
    "in this appendix we would like to examine the behavior of a driven nonlinear oscillator beyond the simple framework developed in the main body of the paper which considers that the circuit only responds at the frequency of the driving force .",

    "this would lead to the breakdown of the validity of our linear analysis , or is at least an indication that the form for the solution given in eq .",

    "@xmath208 , where @xmath209 is an integer and @xmath210 is a lyapunov exponent .",
    "the instability of this type corresponds to the switching of the oscillation amplitude from one stationary state to another at frequency @xmath211 .",
