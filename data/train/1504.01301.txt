    "one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems of interacting fermions served as toy models for theorists since more than fifty years .",
    "@xcite the advances in technology and fabrication during last two decades propelled these models into the forefront of current research in physics at nanoscale .",
    "examples of such systems include carbon nanotubes , @xcite 1d edge states in quantum hall regime @xcite and in topological insulators .",
    "@xcite one dimensional conductors and junctions between them should be important ingredients of any future electronic devices . @xcite it is well known , that the transparency ( conductance ) of such junctions to the electric current is subject to renormalization due to interaction between fermions within the wire . for physical case of electronic repulsion",
    "this conductance tends to zero at low temperatures and applied voltages according to power law , with the exponent defined by the interaction strength .",
    "there are two approaches developed for the description of this conductance renormalization .",
    "one approach uses the so - called bosonization technique , which treats the interaction between electrons in the bulk of the wire exactly , and considers the junction as a boundary .",
    "@xcite the system is described in terms of chiral fermionic densities ( currents ) , and the boundary conditions are imposed onto these currents .",
    "fixed points of the boundary action are determined and perturbations around them are classified according to their scaling dimensions",
    ". @xcite this way one judges about ( in)stability of various fixed points , i.e. the limiting values of conductance obtained during renormalization procedure .",
    "another approach to renormalization of conductance was first formulated in the limit of weak interaction in the bulk . in this approach",
    "one describes an arbitrary junction via its unitary s - matrix , defined in the absence of interaction . @xcite for @xmath1 semi - wires met at one junction this matrix belongs to @xmath2 group .",
    "the fermion wave function are given in a scattering state formalism , and corrections to s - matrix are subsequently calculated .",
    "@xcite these corrections are logarithmically divergent which eventually leads to the renormalization group ( rg ) equation for the s - matrix and conductance .",
    "this approach was essentially improved in @xcite by taking into account higher orders of interaction and subleading logarithms in perturbation theory for conductance . by summing up the appearing series one obtains the non - pertrubative rg equation for the conductance , whose solutions nicely reproduce those scaling exponents which are known exactly from the bosonization approach .    up to now",
    "the main focus of theoretical analysis concerned the simpler cases @xmath3 and @xmath4 , which describe an impurity in one wire and y - junction with three leads , respectively .",
    "the case of four - lead junction with @xmath5 received less attention , partly because of the difficulties in the description of @xmath6-matrix and ensuing analysis of rg equation even in the lowest order of perturbation theory .",
    "we mention her recent studies for a special model cases of @xmath6-matrix with @xmath5 while discussing regular networks of luttinger liquids @xcite , superconducting hybrid junctions @xcite , and tunneling between two helical edge states of the topological insulators @xcite .",
    "we notice that in all previous studies of two - lead and three - lead junctions the rg equations written in terms of @xmath6-matrix and in terms of conductance matrix ( defined by squares of matrix elements @xmath7 ) were equivalent .",
    "the same equivalence held in the considered simpler model cases of four - lead junctions as well . however , there is no one - to - one correspondence for @xmath8 between the matrix of conductances and the @xmath6-matrix , even after removal of trivial phase factors .",
    "mathematically , it is known as an ambiguity in restoring the unitary matrices from the unistochastic ones .",
    "@xcite in general , this ambiguity can even be continuous and three - dimensional , while in our model below we only find a double discrete ambiguity which is a proven minimum for symmetric @xmath6-matrix in @xmath9 group .",
    "@xcite    the main goal of our paper is to demonstrate this ambiguity already in the first order rg equations .",
    "we show for a particular physically motivated class of @xmath6-matrices the description of the junction in terms of conductances is incomplete .",
    "we find two possible rg flows starting from any point in the conductances space .",
    "the rg fixed points and the scaling exponents are not influenced by this ambiguity .",

    "the attempt to write the right - hand side of the rg equations in terms of @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 faces the ambiguity problem in the term @xmath100 .",

    "notice , that the values of conductances @xmath105 and @xmath106 are not affected by the change of sign @xmath107 and @xmath108 , respectively .",
    "this change of sign corresponds to complex conjugation of some elements of @xmath6-matrix , namely , @xmath109 and @xmath110 , which can not be compensated by `` rephasing '' operations .",
    "one may ask what is the internal discrete symmetry , manifesting itself at the level of rg equations ? to answer this , we consider two decoupled ( @xmath111 ) luttinger liquids with impurities .",
    "standard calculations @xcite show that ( at least in the lowest born approximation ) the phase @xmath112 is equal to @xmath113 , with @xmath114 the backscattering amplitude off the impurity in @xmath11th wire .",
    "the sign of @xmath114 is unimportant , as only the square @xmath115 defines the conductance @xcite .",
    "when allowing hopping between the wires , we start to feel the difference between two cases : i ) the scattering potentials in both wires are of the same sign , i.e. both bumps or both pits , or ii ) scattering potentials in the wires are of different sign , i.e. a pit in one wire and a bump in another .",
    "another explanation of the sign question in eq .",
    "concerns the particle - hole symmetry of the hamiltonian . at the level of decoupled wires",
    "the sign of @xmath114 ( and @xmath112 ) is changed when passing to hole description , @xmath116 , etc .",
    "one may then regard the above sign question as arising from the possibility to perform the particle - hole transformation in one wire .",
    "we see that the rg equations _ can not _ be defined in terms of conductances only .",
    "generally , we have two different rg flows for conductances , and the choice between them should be done on the base the initial phases of @xmath6-matrix , @xmath88 , @xmath89 .",
    "further analysis of rg equations shows that the ambiguity does nt influence the position of fixed points ( fps ) .",
    "we have four fps parametrized by @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 , which reads as @xmath120 , @xmath111 in terms of angles .",
    "these fps correspond to simple cases of two separated wires with absolute transmission or reflection in each of them .",
    "the fifth fp is defined by @xmath121 and discussed below .",
    "to clarify the character of different fps we generalize our consideration and allow for different interaction constants in two wires : @xmath122 the representation of the rg equations purely in terms of conductances is cumbersome and we rewrite them in terms of the angles @xcite @xmath123 the same ambiguity of rg equations in terms of conductance is seen again in .",
    "one can change , e.g. @xmath124 , without changing the conductance but altering the rg flows .",
    "as before , we observe four universal fps , @xmath120 , @xmath111 ( i.e.  @xmath125 , @xmath119 ) .",
    "only one of these four is a stable fp and it is defined by the sign of the interaction in individual wires .",
    "according to usual expectations @xcite we have for the stable fp : @xmath126 .",
    "in addition we find a fifth non - universal fp , which is never stable , and whose position attains a compact form in terms of conductance : @xmath127 this fp is in physical domain at @xmath128 , which happens for @xmath129 .",
    "we illustrate our findings in fig .",
    "[ fig : fpandrg ] , where we show the body of conductances , i.e. the set of allowed conductances values @xmath130 and possible rg trajectories , starting from the same parametric point @xmath130 for different values of @xmath131 .",
    "we see that the stable fp depends on the quarter in the plane of @xmath132 , similar to the situation with y - junction @xcite .",
    "we also demonstrate the existence of two possible rg flows , leading to _ the same _ stable fp ( darker one is for plus sign in ambiguity term , lighter - for minus ) .",
    "one can verify that the scaling exponents near the fps are not affected by the discussed sign ambiguity .",
    "two possible rg flows result only in a different prefactors in the scaling dependence of the conductances .",
    "for instance , for the repulsive interaction in both wires , @xmath133 , if the rg flow starts in the vicinity of fp @xmath134 then we have @xmath135 starting far away from such vicinity , two possible rg trajectories will end at the different points @xmath136 in but the scaling law is the same .",

    "in this paper we study four - lead junction of spinless luttinger liquid wires by fermionic representation in scattering state formalism .",
    "the interaction in wires leads to the renormalization of the conductances of the system , expressed via the absolute values of the @xmath6-matrix elements . the rg equation for the conductances",
    "can usually be formulated entirely in terms of conductances , which was explicitly checked for general two - lead and three - lead junctions . in this paper",
    "we demonstrate that in case of four - lead junctions the rg equations possess the sign ambiguity unresolved in terms of conductances . from a mathematical viewpoint ,",
    "this ambiguity is an intrinsic property of @xmath9 group , and is most easily seen in the sign choice , which defines the left- and right - isoclinic subgroups of @xmath141 . from a physical viewpoint ,",
    "the ambiguity may be traced back to the particle - hole symmetry of our hamiltonian .",
    "this results in two possible non - monotonous dependences of the renormalized conductances as functions of the scaling variable .",
    "we note that should we use the bosonization approach in our analysis , we would not observe the ambiguity in question .",
    "this is because the bosonization starts with the fps of rg equations and analyzes the scaling dimensions of perturbations around it .",
