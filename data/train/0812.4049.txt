    "it is a challenge , theoretically , to devise relevant and accurate models to accompany the increasing number of physical phenomena currently being reported .",

    "recent experimental interest @xcite has shifted to focus on becs in toroidal trapping potentials which are now more experimentally accessible .",
    "a bec in a toroidal trap will form a ring shaped condensate .",
    "the first experimental observation of spontaneous vortex formation as the alkali gas is cooled through the transition temperature to create a bec has been reported in @xcite for both a toroidal and a harmonic trap . in previous studies vortex formation through the transition temperature",
    "could be attributed to a number of different factors such as stirring of the condensate by a laser beam .",
    "the conditions under which a ring condensate exists and the manipulation of a condensate in a toroidal trap has recently been considered by @xcite and the generation of solitary waves have been studied in @xcite .",
    "experimental interest in the dynamics of superfluids in a ring is not new .",
    "donnelly & fetter @xcite noted that , in superfluid @xmath0he , vortices appear in the ring at a particular angular velocity when vortices can first compensate for the difference in irrotational velocity between the inner and outer boundaries of the ring .",
    "experimentally , rotation of the condensate will create instabilities around the edge of the condensate .",
    "as the rotation velocity is increased the instabilities continue to grow and form vortices ( see @xcite ) .",
    "a three - dimensional toroidal trapping potential , which creates a ring shaped condensate , might provide the necessary energy requirements to ensure stationary solitary wave solutions exist .",
    "solitary wave sequences have previously been considered in both two- and three - dimensional homogeneous condensates @xcite , a three - dimensional cigar shaped condensate @xcite and also a two - dimensional channel condensate @xcite .",

    "the observation of persistent flow in a toroidal trap and the existence of vortices , has been reported in @xcite .",
    "persistent flow in a bec is the persistent circulation facilitated by the frictionless flow of a superfluid system .",
    "a useful way to view persistent flow is to consider a single vortex pinned to the centre of the ring shaped condensate .",
    "the energy at the centre is a ( local ) minimum and as such it will cost too much energy for the vortex to drift away from the centre .",
    "the vortex creates a constant circulation around itself : a persistent flow .",
    "a persistent flow in a bec is also referred to as a supercurrent .",
    "the properties of a persistent flow in a toroidal trap have been theoretically considered in @xcite .",
    "it is thought that studies on persistent flows in a bec held under a toroidal trap could lead to crucial insights into the features of the critical velocity in superfluid @xmath0he and to the fundamental relationship between superfluidity and bose - einstein condensation @xcite .",

    "reduction to a two - dimensional condensate is equivalent to a tightly trapped , or confined , condensate in the axial coordinate .",
    "such a confinement is experimentally achievable and reduction to two - dimensional condensates has been theoretically considered in @xcite .",

    "their analysis uses established point vortex model techniques from classical hydrodynamics and has shown that the motion of vortices is similar to the motion of classical vortices in an annular shaped domain @xcite .",
    "the trapping potential ( [ 3dtor_trap ] ) creates an inhomogeneous condensate that is markedly different to a ` boxlike ' condensate .",
    "this paper will focus solely on the dynamics of solitary wave solutions in a two - dimensional condensate held under a toroidal trapping potential .",

    "iv , the stability of the solitary wave sequences are numerically investigated and in sect .  v the evolution and collisions of vortex - vortex pairs and vortex - antivortex pairs are considered .",

    "conversely , at larger values of @xmath15 the harmonic term will dominate causing the condensate to form an outer boundary .",
    "note that the toroidal trap can also be modelled by an external potential trap of the form @xmath16 for @xmath17 as has been considered by many authors ( see for example @xcite ) for oscillator length @xmath18 and relative strength of the quartic term @xmath19 .",

    "iv and this section to find the evolution of vortices considers the depletion of the density gradient .",
    "however , the point vortex model does not take into account the density gradient .",
    "the two models give the same trajectories but different velocities for each trajectory for both type i and ii solutions .",
    "the point vortex model therefore provides a qualitative but not quantitative representation of the dynamics of the elastic collisions .",
    "furthermore the point vortex model will not be able to capture any of the inelastic collisions .",
    "a persistent flow ( supercurrent ) has been observed to occur in a toroidal trap by @xcite , where the creation of vortices was also seen .",
    "the dynamics of solitary waves in a toroidal trap with a persistent flow present are readily obtained by a simple adaptation of the theory presented in sect .",
    "as noted before , a persistent flow can be characterised by the existence of a vortex at the origin .",
    "therefore take the non - dimensional gp equation ( [ gp_tor3 ] ) with the same trapping potential ( [ trap_toroidal ] ) .",
    "now consider the transformation of the wave function @xmath202 which is equivalent to placing a singly quantized vortex at the origin .",
    "then , the modified gp equation now reads @xmath203 transfer to the rotating frame using @xmath57 , so that @xmath58 , and such that ( [ gp_tor1_sc ] ) becomes @xmath204 where the hat ( @xmath205 ) notation for @xmath76 and the dash ( @xmath206 ) notation for @xmath44 has been dropped for convenience of notation . from now on @xmath76 will refer to the wave function in the condensate with a persistent flow .",
    "equation ( [ gp_tor_sc ] ) describes the dynamics of solitary wave solutions in a toroidal trap with a persistent flow .",
    "solitary wave solutions that move with a constant angular velocity @xmath56 at constant @xmath15 are sought by the same numerical procedure introduced in sect .",
    "the normalisation condition ( [ tor_norm ] ) is unchanged ; @xmath207 where @xmath33 is the entire spatial domain .",
    "the thomas - fermi approximation is now updated to be given by @xmath208 while the modified energy functional is @xmath209 which can be obtained from the transformation @xmath210 in ( [ e_tor ] ) .",
    "the energy is then obtained from @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the ground state energy and is evaluated as @xmath211 . note that as expected @xmath212    the form of the angular momentum",
    ", however , is not so clear . applying the transformation @xmath210 to ( [ p_tor ] ) will give @xmath213 for ground state @xmath42 .",
    "however this particular form of the angular momentum will be rejected and instead the following form ( note its similarity to ( [ p_tor ] ) ) of angular momentum will be used @xmath214 the reason for the rejection of ( [ p1_tor_sc ] ) is to ensure that the angular momentum of the elementary excitations are found and not the angular momentum of the elementary excitations plus the angular momentum caused by the persistent flow .",
    "additionally it allows the group relationship @xmath215 to be satisfied for energy given by ( [ e_tor_sc ] ) and angular momentum given by ( [ p_tor_sc ] ) .",
    "finally , an alternative form for the energy can be obtained by taking @xmath72 for constant @xmath73 in the expressions for energy and angular momentum ( [ e_tor_sc ] ) and ( [ p_tor_sc ] ) and considering the variational relationship ( [ grp ] ) to give @xmath216\\ , drd\\theta.\\ ] ]    the dynamics of solitary wave solutions in a toroidal trap with a persistent flow have been simulated for a range of values of interaction strength @xmath217 and parameters @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",

    "if the energy and angular momentum are increased ( to positive values ) then a rarefaction wave develops along @xmath135 and exists in the range of angular velocity @xmath225 . at @xmath226",
    "the rarefaction wave develops vorticity such that the solution is now a single vortex of positive circulation .",
    "the single vortex solution exists until @xmath227 at which point @xmath228 and the solution terminates . the rarefaction wave and the single vortex solution just described form the first branch of the dispersion curve .",
    "a cusp develops at @xmath228 and a new , second , branch is formed epitomised by the onset of two vortices of opposite circulation at the edge of the condensate , one along @xmath135 and the other along @xmath130 creating an anti - symmetric two vortex solution .",
    "the dynamics over the cusp are continuous ( see fig .",
    "[ tor_sc_150_ud ] ) .",
    "the new branch that is formed exists for @xmath229 and is subdivided into two regions ; the first region where the two vortex solution exists ( @xmath230 ) and the second region where the two vortices lose circulation and become a pair of rarefaction waves ( @xmath231 ) .",
    "the second branch terminates at @xmath232 at which point a cusp develops over which the dynamics are again continuous .",
    "note that the continuity of the dynamics can not be seen in fig .",
    "[ tor_sc_150_ud ] since at the cusp the solutions are rarefaction waves .",
    "tracing out the new third branch in the dispersion curve gives a system that contains a single rarefaction wave that exists in the range @xmath233 . at @xmath234",
    "the rarefaction wave develops vorticity and the solution is thus a single vortex which is present all the way until the branch terminates at @xmath224 .",
    "the dispersion curve for the parameter range chosen here therefore contains two distinct single solitary wave solutions ( thick black and thin black curves in fig .",
    "[ tor_sc_150_ep ] ) as was previously seen in annular condensates with no persistent flow present ( sect .",
    "note however that at @xmath224 where the branches of the two single solitary wave solutions meet the dynamics are not continuous , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ tor_sc_150_ep ] where the first branch contains a rarefaction wave ( thick black dashed line ) and the third branch which contains a single vortex solution ( thin black solid line ) .",
    "the two case studies ( @xmath219 and @xmath235 ) have concentrated on low - to - mid range interaction strengths . for higher @xmath24 the energy - angular momentum dispersion curves become too complicated to be described in a detailed yet concise fashion .",
    "however it can be appreciated that the net result of increasing @xmath24 will be to produce new distinct solitary wave solutions and thus many branches in the dispersion curve .",
    "a further result of increasing @xmath24 will be in the decrease in the range of angular velocities for which the rarefaction waves exist .",
    "this paper has investigated the dynamics of a two - dimensional condensate held under a toroidal trapping potential .",
    "a toroidal trapping potential creates an annular condensate with richer and broader range of the solitary waves in comparison with the semi - infinite channel geometries @xcite .",
    "the toroidal condensate is dependent on three independent parameters ( that can be set experimentally ) @xmath176 , of which the interaction strength @xmath24 is the dominant parameter .",
    "changing the value of @xmath24 determines the number of different types of solutions on the dispersion curve . for low values of @xmath24",
    "there are two fundamental branches of solutions ( see fig .",
    "[ tor_150_ep ] for @xmath151 ) . for a larger value of @xmath24",
    ", the number of fundamental branches of solutions increases .",
    "the parameter set @xmath152 has been detailed extensively in this paper .",
    "there are seven fundamental branches of solutions ( see fig.[tor_500_ep ] ) which contain up to four vortices in the condensate .",
    "an interesting scenario arises in which there exists two different branches each of which contains a single vortex with the vortices of opposite circulation .",
    "there is a solution where the two branches possess a vortex with the same angular velocity and are at the same distance from the origin .",
    "since the vortices have opposite circulation , such a result seems rather surprising .",
    "one of the solutions was determined to contain not just the vortex , but in addition rarefaction waves embedded in the background of the condensate which resulted from the decay of a vortex from a different branch on the dispersion curve .",
    "the stability of the seven fundamental branches of the parameter set @xmath236 was also investigated by evolving the solitary wave solutions forward in time .",
    "the solutions were evolved until three of four complete revolutions were completed , or the solutions decayed into sound waves .",
    "it was determined numerically that , if the solitary wave sequence contains more than one vortex for any given angle , then the branch is unstable .",
    "all the other branches were determined to be stable .    by isolating the solitary waves from type i and type ii solutions it is possible to investigate the possible range of collisional effects and compare them with a point vortex model .",
    "the solutions in this paper are all obtained by numerically simulating the gross - pitaevskii equation for the inhomogeneous condensate , whereas point vortex models consider a ` box - like ' condensate where the density is uniform in the annular region and is zero outside this region .",
    "it is seen in this paper that collision of the vortices result in two distinct behaviours : either the vortices collide elastically or collide inelastically .",
    "elastic collisions occur for low angular velocities where the vortices repel each other or for high angular velocities where the vortices pass through one another . for intermediate angular velocities ,",
    "the vortices collide inelastically and decay into sound waves . point vortex models are only able to capture the collisions for low angular velocities .",
    "finally , a separate condensate is considered where now a persistent flow is included into the condensate .",
    "it is interesting to note the similarities and differences between the annular condensate without a persistent flow ( sect .",
