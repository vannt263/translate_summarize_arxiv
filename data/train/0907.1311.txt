    "with the advent of the five - year wmap data @xcite the inflationary paradigm @xcite ( henceforth called _ canonical inflation _ ) has been confirmed as the most successful candidate for explaining the physics of the very early universe @xcite .",
    "the very rapid acceleration period generated by canonical inflation has solved some of the puzzles of the standard cosmological model , such as the horizon , flatness and entropy problems . however , existing models for inflation are phenomenological in character , and a fundamental explanation of inflation is still missing . also , the scalar field responsible for the inflationary expansion - the _ inflaton _ - is generically highly fine - tuned .    over the past few years developments in string theory have shed new light on these two problems of canonical inflation .",
    "string theory predicts a broad class of scalar fields associated with the compactification of extra dimensions and the configuration of lower - dimensional branes moving in a higher - dimensional bulk space .",
    "this fact gave rise to some phenomenologically viable inflation models , such as the kklmmt scenario @xcite , racetrack inflation @xcite , roulette inflation @xcite , and the dirac - born - infeld ( dbi ) scenario @xcite .",
    "in particular , from a phenomenological point of view , the dbi scenario has a very interesting and far - reaching feature : being a special case of a larger class of inflationary models with non - canonical lagrangians called _ k - inflation _",
    "@xcite , the dbi model possesses a varying speed of sound .",
    "this is a far - reaching feature because , in this case , slow - roll can be achieved via a low sound speed instead of from dynamical friction due to expansion which , in turn , leads to substantial non - gaussianity @xcite .",
    "also , dbi inflation admits several exact solutions to the flow equations ( first introduced in @xcite for the canonical case , and generalized in @xcite for dbi inflation ) , as discussed in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we derive a family of non - canonical models characterized by a power - law in the inflaton field @xmath4 for the speed of sound @xmath5 and the flow parameter @xmath6 .",
    "we then derive the forms of the associated inflationary potentials , and group them according to the classification scheme introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , in order to have a better physical picture of the solutions obtained .",
    "we later show that some particular cases possess spectral indices in agreement with the current observational values , and establish the limits for the speed of sound in order that their tensor - to - scalar ratio correspond to the observed values .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in section [ sec : dbiinflation ] we review the dbi inflation and the flow formalism for non - canonical inflation with time - varying speed of sound . in section [ sec : powerspec ] we review the tools needed to calculate the scalar and tensor spectral indices for slow - roll . in section [ sec : powerlawmodel ] we introduce the main features of our model and derive general solutions , postponing the discussion of their physical properties to section [ sec : inflpotentials ] , where we extend the concept of large - field , small - field , hybrid and exponential potentials of canonical inflation to the non - canonical case . in section [ sec : application ] we compare the observational predictions of a set of non - canonical large - field models with wmap5 data , and show that there is a generic correlation between small sound speed ( and therefore significant non - gaussianity ) and a low tensor / scalar ratio .",
    "we present conclusions in [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in warped d - brane inflation ( see @xcite and @xcite for a review ) , inflation is regarded as the motion of a d3-brane in a six - dimensional  throat \" characterized by the metric @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the warp factor , @xmath9 is a sasaki - einstein five - manifold which forms the base of the cone , and @xmath10 is the radial coordinate along the throat . in this case , the inflaton field @xmath4 is identified with @xmath10 as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the brane tension .",
    "the dynamics of the d3-brane in the warped background ( [ eq : dbimetric ] ) is then dictated by the dbi lagrangian @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the background spacetime metric , @xmath15 is the inverse brane tension , @xmath16 is an arbitrary potential , and @xmath17 is the kinetic term .",
    "we assume that the background cosmological model is described by the flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric , @xmath18 .",
    "dbi inflation is a special case of _ k - inflation _ , characterized by a varying speed of sound @xmath19 , whose expression is given by @xmath20 where the subscript  @xmath21 \" indicates a derivative with respect to the kinetic term .",
    "it is straightforward to see that in the model ( [ dbilagrangian ] ) the speed of sound is given by @xmath22 in those models it is convenient to introduce an analog of the lorentz factor , related to @xmath23 by : @xmath24    we next introduce the generalization of the inflationary flow hierarchy for k - inflation models @xcite .",
    "the two fundamental flow parameters are    @xmath25    where the prime indicates a derivative with respect to @xmath4 .",
    "an infinite hierarchy of additional flow parameters can be generated by differentiation , and are defined as follows : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is an integer index .",
    "it is convenient to express the flow parameters ( [ eq : flowparams ] ) in terms of the number of e - folds before the end of inflation , which is defined in the following way : @xmath28 where @xmath29 indicates the value of the inflaton field at the end of inflation .",
    "the definition above indicates that the number of e - folds increases as we go backward in time , so that it is zero at the end of inflation .",
    "we can also determine the scale factor , @xmath30 , in terms of @xmath31 in a straightforward way : since @xmath32 , we simply have @xmath33    in terms of @xmath31 , it is easy to see that the key flow parameters @xmath6 and @xmath34 , as defined in ( [ defepsilon1 ] ) and ( [ defs1 ] ) , assume the following equivalent form    @xmath35    so that we may derive a set of first - order differential equations @xmath36 + { } ^{\\ell + 1}\\lambda , \\cr \\frac{d s}{d",

    "we briefly review the generation of perturbations in non - canonical inflation models .",
    "scalar and tensor perturbations in k - inflation were first studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was shown that the quantum mode function @xmath45 obeys the equation of motion @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the comoving wave number , a prime denotes a derivative with respect to conformal time @xmath48 , and @xmath49 is a variable given by @xmath50 it is convenient to change the conformal time , @xmath51 , to @xmath52 so that @xmath53,\\ ] ] where @xmath54 we can also show that @xmath55 where @xcite @xmath56 substituting ( [ dery ] ) and ( [ zf ] ) into ( [ modeeq ] ) , we find @xmath57 u_k = 0,\\ ] ] which is an exact equation , without any assumption of slow - roll .    we now proceed to solve equation ( [ exactmode ] ) to first - order in slow - roll . in this case , this equation takes the form @xmath58 u_k = 0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] whose solution is @xcite @xmath59 where @xmath60 is a hankel function , and @xmath61    the power spectra for scalar and tensor perturbations are given respectively by @xmath62 so that , for the solution ( [ uksolsr ] ) , @xmath63\\left.\\frac{h^2}{2\\pi \\dot\\phi}\\right|_{k=\\gamma a h}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 is euler s constant . from the definitions of the scalar and tensor spectral indices ,",
    "@xmath65 we find @xmath66 valid to first - order in the slow - roll limit .",
    "the tensor - to - scalar ratio is given by @xcite @xmath67 which , to first - order in slow - roll , gives the well - known result @xmath68 since in this paper we will work only to the first - order in slow - roll approximation , we make use of expression ( [ stratio ] ) to compute the tensor / scalar ratio .",
    "it is immediately clear from this expression that small @xmath19 has the generic effect of suppressing the tensor / scalar ratio .",
    "the usual approach to the construction of a model of inflation normally starts with a choice of the inflaton potential , @xmath16 ; then , all the flow parameters are derived , and the dynamical analysis is performed . in this work we adopt the reverse procedure : we first look for the solutions to the differential equation satisfied by the hubble parameter @xmath69 , @xmath70 and only afterwards derive the form of the potential",
    ". equation ( [ eqhubble ] ) can be easily derived from the definition of the flow parameter @xmath6 , given by ( [ defepsilon1 ] ) , and the sign ambiguity indicates in which direction the field is rolling .",
    "notice that in order to solve equation ( [ eqhubble ] ) we must know the form of the functions @xmath71 and @xmath72 ; we choose them to be power - law functions of the inflaton field ,    @xmath73    where @xmath74 is the value of the lorentz factor at the end of inflation , and @xmath2 and @xmath3 are constants .",
    "another case worth studying appears when @xmath6 is _ constant _ , so that @xmath75 with the same parametrization for @xmath76 .",
    "we have kept @xmath29 for the following reason : in the @xmath77 dbi model the inflaton field rolls down from the tip of the throat toward the bulk of the manifold with increasing speed of sound ; then , when the field enters the bulk @xmath19 becomes equal to @xmath78 , and then inflation  ends \" . in the @xmath79 case the behavior is the opposite , that is , the field evolves away from the bulk and reaches the tip when @xmath80 . to reproduce both cases",
    "we could have set @xmath81 from the onset , so that @xmath82 , as required ; also , @xmath83 in the canonical limit , that is , when @xmath84 .",
    "however , by taking @xmath74 arbitrary , we also reproduce the non - canonical models with constant speed of sound introduced by spalinski @xcite .",
    "it is clear that in the latter case @xmath74 does not refer necessarily to the end of inflation , so that if we take @xmath85 it does not mean a superluminal propagation ( as would be the case if @xmath86 ) .",
    "bearing this distinction in mind we can use the same notation unambiguously .",
    "when @xmath87 , substituting ( [ powerepsilon ] ) and ( [ powercs ] ) into ( [ eqhubble ] ) , we see that the hubble parameter takes the form @xmath88,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have defined @xmath89 and @xmath90 accounts for the sign ambiguity appearing in ( [ eqhubble ] ) .",
    "when @xmath6 is constant , the solution to ( [ eqhubble ] ) reads @xmath91,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the integral @xmath92 is the same as in ( [ eqhubble2 ] ) .",
    "it is clear that the integral ( [ eqhubble2 ] ) admits two distinct solutions : a logarithmic one when @xmath93 , and power - law for @xmath94 .",
    "these two solutions will give rise to different classes of inflationary potentials , which we shall address in the next subsections .    to conclude this section we derive the general formula for the number of e - folds . for @xmath87",
    "this expression can be determined by equations ( [ eq : numefolds ] ) , ( [ powerepsilon ] ) , and ( [ powercs ] ) , so that @xmath95 where @xmath96 if @xmath97 we must use the parametrization ( [ powerepsilonrep ] ) , so that expression ( [ efolds1 ] ) changes to @xmath98 where @xmath99    in the next section , we discuss particular cases of this general class of solutions .      for this class of solutions ,",
    "the parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 are related by @xmath100 notice that the case @xmath97 implies @xmath101 , which corresponds to the case where the flow parameters @xmath6 and @xmath34 are constant @xcite .",
    "evaluating the integral ( [ eqhubble2 ] ) and substituting it into ( [ eqhubble1 ] ) , we find @xmath102 where the exponent @xmath103 is determined by @xmath104 let us now analyze the sign ambiguity appearing in ( [ sol1defp ] ) .",
    "we first write the expression ( [ sol1hubpar ] ) as @xmath105 then , for @xmath106 , we have , from ( [ powerepsilon ] ) , in the slow - roll limit , @xmath107 which implies @xmath108 and @xmath109 for @xmath110 ( _ large - field limit _ ) , so that @xmath111 . since the weak - energy condition implies that @xmath112 , we have @xmath113 , and then @xmath114 . therefore , from ( [ sol1defp1 ] ) , @xmath106 implies @xmath115 . from definition ( [ sol1defp ] )",
    "we see that @xmath115 implies @xmath116 if @xmath117 , and @xmath118 if @xmath110 .",
    "conversely , if @xmath119 , we have , from ( [ powerepsilon ] ) , in the slow - roll limit , @xmath120 which implies @xmath121 and @xmath122 for @xmath110 ( _ small - field limit _ ) , so that @xmath123 .",
    "again , @xmath114 , so that , from ( [ sol1defp1 ] ) , @xmath119 implies @xmath124 . from definition ( [ sol1defp ] )",
    "we see that @xmath124 implies @xmath116 if @xmath110 , and @xmath118 if @xmath117 .",
    "therefore , what really distinguishes the models is the sign of the exponent of @xmath2 ; the sign of @xmath90 simply dictates which direction the field is rolling in , exactly as in canonical inflation .",
    "we are left with two distinct models , whose properties are summarized in table [ t1 ] .",
    ".the sign rule for models with @xmath93 and @xmath110 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this section we study some applications of the large - field models derived in section [ subsec : largefield ] .",
    "we choose this class of non - canonical potentials because the expressions for the scalar spectral index , the tensor / scalar ratio and the level of non - gaussianity are particularly simple , depending on two parameters solely , @xmath103 and @xmath3 .",
    "let us first derive an expression for the flow parameter @xmath6 in terms of @xmath31 . from ( [ lfieldeps ] ) and ( [ lfieldefolds ] ) we find @xmath125 the other two flow parameters @xmath34 and @xmath126",
    "are given by @xmath127 @xmath128 where we have used ( [ defs1 ] ) , the first expression of ( [ eq : flowparams ] ) , plus ( [ powercs ] ) , ( [ lfieldhub ] ) and ( [ aplfieldepsn ] ) .",
    "inserting ( [ aplfieldepsn ] ) , ( [ aplfields ] ) and ( [ aplfieldeta ] ) into ( [ scalarspecindex ] ) , we find , in the slow - roll limit , @xmath129    the expression for the speed of sound in terms of @xmath31 can be calculated in the same way : we use ( [ powerepsilon ] ) , ( [ powercs ] ) and ( [ lfieldefolds ] ) , so that @xmath130^{\\beta/(\\beta+2)}.\\ ] ] through the use of ( [ stratio ] ) , ( [ aplfieldepsn ] ) and ( [ aplfieldcsn ] ) we can derive a general expression for the tensor / scalar ratio , which is given by @xmath131^{2(\\beta+1)/(\\beta+2)}.\\ ] ]    the expression for the level of non - gaussianity @xmath132 is given by @xcite @xmath133 which can be easily evaluated by using expression ( [ aplfieldcsn ] ) .",
    "therefore , the tensor / scalar ratio will have a power - law dependence as well , with exponent @xmath134 , which means that , for a given value of @xmath103 , a larger @xmath3 corresponds to a smaller @xmath10 . since @xmath135 for non - canonical large - field models , we have , from ( [ gammafac ] ) and ( [ powercs ] ) , that @xmath136 ; then , fields rolling with _ slower _ speed of sound would produce _ lower _ tensor / scalar ratios .",
    "however , from ( [ aplfieldfnl ] ) , we see that @xmath132 depends on @xmath137 , and then a low speed of sound would produce a _ larger _ level of non - gaussianity ; then , for large - field models low-@xmath10 tensor modes are strongly correlated with the amplitude of non - gaussianity , as has been discussed in the reference @xcite for isokinetic inflation .",
    "then , the suppression of tensor modes by a large amount of non - gaussianity is a feature shared by all non - canonical models with large - field polynomial potentials .",
    "let us next make some predictions on the values of @xmath138 , @xmath10 and @xmath132 through expressions ( [ aplfieldns ] ) , ( [ aplfieldr ] ) and ( [ aplfieldfnl ] ) respectively , when the modes cross the horizon @xmath139 or @xmath140 e - folds before the end of inflation .",
    "as we have discussed in section [ subsec : gensetting ] , we have set @xmath81 , which characterizes the end of inflation ; the results are depicted in figures [ fig : nsrfnln46 ] and [ fig : nsrfnln60 ] . in both figures , the top left plots refer to the variation of the scalar index in terms of @xmath3 for each value of @xmath103 .",
    "the top right plots in figs . [ fig : nsrfnln46 ] and [ fig : nsrfnln60 ] show the corresponding tensor / scalar ratio . in these plots",
    "we see that for larger values of @xmath103 and small @xmath3 the modes have large values of @xmath10 ( the observable lower bound is @xmath141 ) ; then , as @xmath3 increases , the speed of sound gets lower and , in consequence , the tensor / scalar ratio as well .",
    "however , as shown in ( [ aplfieldfnl ] ) , a field rolling very slowly produces a large amount of non - gaussianity , as can be seen in the bottom left plots of figures [ fig : nsrfnln46 ] and [ fig : nsrfnln60 ] .",
    "therefore , as was first discussed in the particular case of isokinetic inflation @xcite , the production of large non - gaussianity is strictly correlated with low tensor amplitudes , and this is a feature common to all large - field polynomial potentials .",
    "this behavior is shown in the bottom right plots of figures [ fig : nsrfnln46 ] and [ fig : nsrfnln60 ] .",
    "we next compare the results obtained with the current wmap5 data @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the results are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : nrplot ] for different values of @xmath103 .",
    "straight lines indicate the different values of @xmath3 , with the left ( right ) extremity indicating the value of @xmath142 evaluated at @xmath143 ( @xmath144 ) .",
    "as shown in @xcite , all canonical models with @xmath145 are ruled out by wmap5 data alone ; however , in the non - canonical case , figure [ fig : nrplot ] shows that the models with @xmath146 are also consistent with the observable data .",
    "a field evolving with slow - varying speed of sound produces low - amplitude tensors , then pushing the values @xmath142 inwards the observable region .",
    "however , a large amount of non - gaussianity is produced , which is a distinct signature of non - canonical large - field polynomial models and can be a powerful observable to discriminate among inflationary models .",
    "in this paper we propose a general dbi model characterized by a power - law flow - parameter power - law flow parameter @xmath0 and speed of sound @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are constants .",
    "we show that this general model has distinct classes of solutions depending on the relation between @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and on the time evolution of the inflaton field .",
    "these classes of solutions are summarized in tables [ t1 ] , [ t2 ] and [ t3 ] . in particular , we show that in the slow - roll limit the four well - known canonical potentials arise naturally in this general dbi model , having similar properties to their canonical counterparts , except that the speed of sound in general varies with time .",
    "we also show that this general dbi model encompasses not only all the canonical models with the mentioned potentials , but other d - brane scenarios as well : the dbi model with constant speed of sound @xcite , with constant flow parameters @xcite , and isokinetic inflation @xcite .",
    "the four non - canonical models are summarized in table [ t4 ] .",
    "we also derive the expressions for the spectral index , tensor / scalar ratio and the amplitude of non - gaussianity for large - field potentials in the slow - roll limit .",
    "we show that a low speed of sound suppresses the tensor / scalar ratio @xmath10 and produces a large amount of non - gaussianity , a feature already explored in the case of isokinetic inflation , and shown to be a general property of all large - field dbi models with polynomial potentials . unlike canonical inflation , where all polynomial models with @xmath145 are ruled out , the suppression of tensor modes in the non - canonical version allows a larger class of polynomial potentials to lie within the observable range ; also , the production of large amount of non - gaussianity is a distinct signature of these dbi large - field models , which can be a powerful observable to discriminate among inflationary models .",

    "<S> these models also show a correlation between large non - gaussianity with low tensor amplitudes , which is a distinct signature of dbi inflation with large - field polynomial potentials . </S>"
