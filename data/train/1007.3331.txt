    "entanglement plays a pivotal role in quantum information | it is a resource for various computational tasks such as quantum communication and teleportation .",
    "it is believed that investigation of the entanglement in a relativistic framework is not only helpful in understanding some of the key questions in quantum information theory , but also plays an important role in the study of entropy and the information paradox of black holes @xcite .",
    "thus , much attention has been focused on the relativistic effects in the context of the quantum information theory @xcite .",
    "recently , we investigated the effect of the hawking radiation @xcite on the entanglement and teleportation in a general static and asymptotically flat black hole with spherical symmetry @xcite , and found that the entanglement degraded as the increase of the hawking temperature both for the scalar and dirac fields .",
    "however , we now face a intriguing question : where has the lost entanglement gone ?    in this paper we will investigate the redistribution of entanglement for the dirac fields in the background of a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "the loss of entanglement will be explained by the redistribution of the entanglement among all accessible and unaccessible modes .",
    "we use some methods of the quantum information to quantify and identify the property of the correlations ( both quantum and classical ) from the perspective of physical observers who can access field modes only outside the event horizon .",
    "our scheme proposes that two observers , alice and bob , share a generically entangled state at the same initial point in flat region .",
    "after their coincidence , alice remains at the asymptotically flat region but bob freely falls in toward the black hole and locates near the event horizon . due to",
    "the presence of a horizon , an observer in each side of the horizon has no access to field modes in the causally disconnected region .",
    "therefore , the observer must trace over the inaccessible region and lose some information about the state .",
    "thus we must calculate the entanglement in all possible bipartite divisions of the system :",
    "( i ) the mode @xmath0 described by alice , ( ii ) the mode @xmath2 in exterior region of the black hole ( described by bob ) , and ( iii ) the complimentary mode @xmath1 in the interior region of the black hole .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we recall the vacuum structure and hawking radiation for the dirac fields . in sec .",
    "iii we discuss the essential features of the background spacetime and the redistribution of entanglement .",
    "we will summarize and discuss our conclusions in the last section .",
    "the line element for the schwarzschild spacetime is @xmath3 where the parameter @xmath4 represents the mass of the black hole .    solving the dirac equation @xcite near the event horizon",
    ", we obtain the positive ( fermions ) frequency outgoing solutions outside and inside regions of the event horizon @xmath5 @xcite @xmath6 @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a 4-component dirac spinor @xcite , @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the tortoise coordinate .",
    "hereafter we will use the wavevector @xmath11 labels the modes .",
    "particles and antiparticles will be classified with respect to the future - directed timelike killing vector in each region .    making a analytic continuation for eqs .",
    "( [ outside mode ] ) and ( [ inside mode ] ) , we find a complete basis for positive energy modes according to domour - ruffini s suggestion @xcite .",
    "then we can quantize the dirac fields in the schwarzschild and kruskal modes respectively , from which we can easily get the bogoliubov transformations @xcite between the creation and annihilation operators in the schwarzschild and kruskal coordinates .",
    "after properly normalizing the state vector , the vacuum state of the kruskal particle for mode @xmath11 is found to be @xmath12|0_{\\mathbf{k}}\\rangle^{+}_{i}|0_{-\\mathbf{k}}\\rangle ^{-}_{ii}\\\\ \\nonumber&=&\\bigg[(e^{-\\omega_\\mathbf{k}/t}+1)^{-\\frac{1}{2}}+(e^{\\omega_\\mathbf{k}/t}+1)^{-\\frac{1}{2 } } a^{i\\dag}_{\\mathbf{k}}b^{ii\\dag}_{\\mathbf{-k}}\\bigg]|0_{\\mathbf{k}}\\rangle^{+}_{i}|0_{-\\mathbf{k}}\\rangle ^{-}_{ii}\\\\ & = & ( e^{-\\omega_\\mathbf{k}/t}+1)^{-\\frac{1}{2}}|0_{\\mathbf{k}}\\rangle^{+}_{i}|0_{-\\mathbf{k}}\\rangle ^{-}_{ii}+(e^{\\omega_\\mathbf{k}/t}+1)^{-\\frac{1}{2}}|1_{\\mathbf{k}}\\rangle^{+}_{i}|1_{-\\mathbf{k}}\\rangle ^{-}_{ii}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the orthonormal bases for the inside and outside regions of the event horizon respectively , the superscript @xmath15 on the kets is used to indicate the particle and antiparticle vacua , and @xmath16 is the hawking temperature @xcite .",
    "the only excited state is latexmath:[\\ ] ] again , we find that the mutual information vanishes for zero hawking temperature , and increases to a finite value as the hawking temperature goes to infinity .    in figs .",
    "( [ c ] ) and ( [ ef ] ) we plot the behavior of the concurrence and the entanglement of formation with the fixed @xmath66 and @xmath23 which show how the hawking temperature would change the properties of all the bipartite entanglement .",
    "when the hawking temperature is lower , modes @xmath0 and @xmath2 remain almost maximally entangled while there is little entanglement between modes @xmath2 and @xmath1 and between modes @xmath0 and @xmath1 . as the hawking temperature grows , the unaccessible entanglement between modes @xmath2 and @xmath1 and between modes @xmath0 and @xmath1 increases , while the accessible entanglement between modes @xmath0 and @xmath2 degrades .",
    "we arrive at the conclusion that the original entanglement in the state eq .",
    "( [ initial ] ) which is described by the inertial observers is now redistributed among the mode @xmath0 described by alice , the mode @xmath2 in exterior region of the black hole described by bob , and the complimentary mode @xmath1 in the interior region of the black hole .",
    "therefore , as a consequence of the conservation of entanglement , the physically accessible entanglement between the two modes described by alice and bob is degraded .",
    "the properties of the mutual information are shown in fig .",
    "( [ muin ] ) .",
    "it demonstrates that the mutual information of @xmath76 decreases while the mutual information of @xmath49 and @xmath77 increases as the hawking temperature increases .",
    "it is interesting to note that when black hole evaporates completely , the mutual information between modes @xmath0 and @xmath2 equals to just half of the its initial value and @xmath78 in this limit , which are independent of the state parameter @xmath23 .",
    "mutual information @xmath79 of the dirac modes versus hawking temperature @xmath30 with the fixed @xmath66 and @xmath23 . ]    in ref .",
    "@xcite we found that the entanglement and mutual information of the mode @xmath76 is degraded as the increase of the hawking temperature ( or acceleration @xcite ) .",
    "the open question should be addressed in this paper is whether the lost correlations are destroyed or transferred to somewhere .",
    "here we presented a complete description of the information behavior across an event horizon by discussing the redistribution of the entanglement and mutual information .",
    "we find that the correlations lost from the mode described by alice and the field mode outside the event horizon is gained by other subsystems , especially between mode a and the mode @xmath1 inside the event horizon .",
    "the results obtained here not only interpreted the lose of entanglement and mutual information in the presence of a horizon but also gave a better insight into the entanglement entropy and information paradox of the black holes .",
    "the effect of hawking radiation on the redistribution of entanglement in the schwarzschild spacetime is investigated .",
    "it is shown that the entanglement between modes @xmath2 and @xmath1 and between modes @xmath0 and @xmath1 increases , while the entanglement between modes @xmath0 and @xmath2 is degraded as the hawking temperature grows",
    ". the original two - mode entanglement , which is described by alice and bob from an inertial perspective , is now redistributed among the mode @xmath0 described by alice , the mode @xmath2 in exterior region of the event horizon described by bob , and the complimentary mode @xmath1 in the interior region of the horizon .",
    "this is a good explanation of physically accessible entanglement between the two modes described by alice and bob is degraded as the hawking temperature grows .",
    "it is also found that the mutual information of @xmath76 decreases while mutual information of @xmath49 and @xmath77 increases as the hawking temperature increases .",
    "it is interesting to note that , in limit case that the temperature tends to infinity , the accessible mutual information equals to just half of its initial value , and the unaccessible mutual information between mode @xmath0 and @xmath1 also equals to the same value .",
    "the results obtained here not only interpreted the lose of entanglement and mutual information in the presence of a horizon but also gave a better insight into the entanglement entropy and information paradox of the black holes .",
