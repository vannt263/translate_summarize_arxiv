    "it is now a well accepted fact that in high energy heavy ion collisions a deconfined medium is created : the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) @xcite .",
    "indeed , a significant part of the rhic and lhc physics program is devoted to determine and understand the properties of the qgp . in another frontier of hadron physics",
    ", we find the @xmath11 factories belle @xcite and bes @xcite , which have produced a wealth of data on new hadronic states @xcite .",
    "particularly interesting are the data on the so called exotic charmonium states @xcite .",
    "one member of this family , the @xmath0 ( from now on simply @xmath4 ) , was measured by many experimental groups and its existence is now established beyond any doubt .    the first measurement of the @xmath4 meson was reported about a decade ago by the belle collaboration  @xcite in the decay @xmath12 and it was subsequently confirmed by several other collaborations @xcite , but only very recently the spin - parity quantum numbers of @xmath4 have been confirmed to be @xmath13  @xcite . in this past decade since the discovery of the @xmath4 , several theoretical models have been proposed for the structure of this new state , describing it as a charmonium state , a tetraquark , a @xmath14 hadron molecule and a mixture between a charmonium and a molecular component  @xcite . in spite of the effort of these numerous groups ,",
    "the properties of this particle are not yet well understood and represent a challenge both for theorists and experimentalists .",
    "the exhic collaboration @xcite was created as a task force to investigate the fascinating possibility of learning more about exotic charmonium states in heavy ion collisions . in many aspects",
    "this program is a revival of the study of @xmath15 production in heavy ion collisions carried out fifteen years ago .",
    "the main difference is that in those days the @xmath15 , a very well known charmonium state , was considered as a probe to understand the qgp .",
    "now , in a remarkable inversion of strategy , we use the qgp to try to understand the new charmonium ! in a high energy heavy ion collision the qgp is formed , expands , cools , hadronizes and is converted into a hadron gas , which lives up to @xmath16 fm / c and then freezes out .",
    "now as before , the most important part of this evolution is the qgp , where an increasing ( with the reaction energy ) number of charm quarks and anti - quarks move freely .",
    "the initially formed charmonium bound states are dissolved ( the famous  charmonium suppression \" ) but @xmath17 s and @xmath18 s , coming now from different parent gluons , can pick up light quarks and anti - quarks from the rich environment and form multiquark bound states . this is called quark coalescence and it happens during the phase transition to the hadronic gas @xcite .",
    "quark coalescence has proven to give a very successful description of particle production during the hadronization and can be applied to @xmath4 production from the plasma .",
    "the formation of the quark gluon plasma phase increases the number of produced @xmath4 s @xcite .",
    "this fact alone is already stimulating for the study of the exotic charmonium .",
    "but there is more .",
    "the coalescence formalism is based on the overlap of the wigner functions of the quarks and of the bound state , being thus sensitive to the spatial configuration of the charmonium state and hence being able to distinguish between a compact , @xmath19 fm long , tetraquark configuration and a large @xmath20 fm long , molecular configuration . a big difference between the predicted abundancies",
    "could be used as a tool to discriminate between different @xmath4 structures and to help us to decide whether it is a molecule or a tetraquark @xcite .",
    "however ( as before in the case of the @xmath15 ) the long lasting hadron gas phase can change the yield coming from the plasma . the @xmath4 s can be destroyed in collisions with ordinary hadrons , such as @xmath21 , and can also be produced through the inverse reactions , such as @xmath22 .",
    "we must then be able to calculate the cross sections of these processes .",
    "the theory of the interactions between charmonium and ordinary hadrons was developed to give a precise estimate of how strongly the charmonium is absorbed by a hadronic medium .",
    "hadronic absorption was considered as a background for the most important suppression , which happened in the qgp , as a result of the color screening effect .",
    "this theory was based on effective lagrangians with @xmath23 symmetry and it started to be developed in 1998 , with the pioneering work of matinyan and mller @xcite .",
    "this work was followed by successive improvements @xcite , until 2003 , when @xmath15 absorption cross sections were derived from qcd sum rules @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that interaction terms with anomalous parity couplings have a strong impact on the interaction cross section . very recently in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors revisited the subject , using this theory of charm meson interactions and including vertices with the @xmath4 .",
    "the interaction of the @xmath4 with other hadrons is essentially unknown .",
    "the @xmath4 decays into @xmath24 and into @xmath25 and also into @xmath26 . in the first theoretical works @xcite addressing these decays ,",
    "the required interaction lagrangians were proposed for the @xmath4-vector - vector ( @xmath4vv ) and @xmath4-pseudoscalar - vector ( @xmath4pv ) vertices .",
    "they were used in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the hadronic absorption cross section of the @xmath4 by mesons like @xmath27 and @xmath28 was evaluated for the processes @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 . using these cross sections , the variation of the @xmath4 meson abundance during the expansion of the hadronic matter",
    "was computed with the help of a kinetic equation with gain and loss terms .",
    "the results turned out to be strongly dependent on the quantum numbers of the @xmath4 and on its structure .",
    "the present work is devoted to introduce two improvements in the calculation of cross sections performed in ref .",
    "the first and most important one is the inclusion of the anomalous vertices @xmath34 and @xmath35 , which were neglected before . with these vertices new reaction channels",
    "become possible , such as @xmath36 , and the inverse process @xmath37 . as will be seen",
    ", this reaction is the most important one for @xmath4 in the hadron gas .",
    "the relevance of anomalous couplings has also been shown earlier in different contexts , for example in the @xmath15 absorption cross sections by @xmath27 and @xmath28 mesons  @xcite , radiative decays of scalar resonances and axial vector mesons  @xcite and in kaon photoproduction  @xcite .",
    "the second improvement is the inclusions of the charged components of the @xmath38 and @xmath8 mesons which couple to the @xmath4 .",
    "the fact that the mass of @xmath4 is very close to the @xmath39 threshold ( @xmath40 mev below it ) , while the charged components @xmath41 are bound by roughly 8 mev , could make us think that the charged components might not play an important role in the description of the properties of @xmath4 .",
    "this is so because if a wave function is obtained for the neutral and charged components , the one associated with the neutral component , due to the small binding energy of the system , will extend much further away in space than the one related to the charged components .",
    "thus , the former one has a larger probability to be found than the latter .",
    "this has often motivated an omission of the contribution of the charged components .",
    "see , for example , refs .",
    "however , it was shown in refs .",
    "@xcite that the coupling of @xmath4 to the neutral and charged components is very similar . as argued in refs .",
    "@xcite , in strong processes , the relevant interactions are short ranged and it is the wave function at the origin that matters in the description of such processes .",
    "it was also shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that , for a molecular state formed due to the interaction of two hadrons , the wave function of the state at the origin is related to the coupling of this state with the hadrons constituting it . in the case of @xmath4 , since the couplings to the neutral and charged open charm channels are found to be practically the same  @xcite , a good description of any short ranged process in which this state is involved would imply the contribution of both neutral and charged components .",
    "this fact is not incompatible with having a larger probability of finding the neutral components for @xmath4 when integrating the wave function over a large range  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the importance of the consideration of the neutral as well as the charged channels to describe the properties of @xmath4 has already been shown in calculations of decay widths of this state into @xmath42 , @xmath25 and @xmath43 , where differences of the order of a factor 20 - 30 were found for several branching ratios when the charged components were not included .",
    "having in this case results not compatible with the experimental data on these branching ratios  @xcite .",
    "we shall calculate the production cross sections of @xmath4 in the processes ( a ) @xmath44 , ( b ) @xmath45 and ( c ) @xmath46 .",
    "the determination of the latter two involves diagrams with the @xmath47 anomalous vertex . as will be seen , the consideration of this anomalous vertex is important and can not be neglected in the evaluation of the cross section of the processes ( b ) and ( c ) . in order to calculate the cross sections , we consider the model of refs .",
    "@xcite in which @xmath4 is generated from the interaction of @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , thus , taking into account the neutral as well as the charged components . to determine the cross section for the reaction ( b ) we consider triangular loops motivated by the molecular nature of @xmath4 .",
    "having done this , we determine the amplitude for the same reaction considering @xmath4 as an effective field and estimate the @xmath9 coupling such that it reproduces the results obtained by calculating the triangular loops . using this coupling",
    ", we determine the production cross section for the process @xmath46 .",
    "although this last quantity had already been calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite , our result is more complete because it contains the anomalous couplings .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we describe the formalism used to calculate the production cross section for the different reactions studied here considering triangular loops and with an effective lagrangian to describe the @xmath9 vertex . in sec .",
    "[ res ] , we show the importance of the charged components of @xmath4 as well as the anomalous vertex @xmath9 and the results found for the cross sections @xmath51 .",

    "we calculate the production cross section for @xmath46 . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sum ] we draw some conclusions .",
