    "ions or molecules with degenerate electronic orbitals coupled to local vibrations can display a rich variety of phenomena.@xcite the most notable of these phenomena is the so - called static jahn - teller ( jt ) effect , i.e. , the system gains energy by lowering the symmetry through a static distortion , thereby removing the electronic degeneracy . for finite systems , like a molecule , quantum mechanics can play an important role in that , if the frequency of the relevant vibronic modes is high enough , it can dynamically restore the original symmetry through a quantum superposition of `` degenerate '' distorted configurations ( dynamical jt effect ) .",
    "many systems containing jt ions or molecules are found to be insulators with quite a rich variety of spin and orbital ordering effects .",
    "such a richness of exchange effects is due to the interplay between the spin and orbital degrees of freedom.@xcite    the simplest cases can be modeled by the so - called @xmath1 jt - coupling , i.e. , at each site @xmath2 a two - fold degenerate electronic orbital is coupled to a two - fold degenerate local vibron.@xcite although conceived as the simplest workable model , such a situation is not totally unrealistic , as higher molecular degeneracies can often be reduced , by the crystal field of the solid state environment , to residual doublets .",
    "( if the crystal field symmetry is very low , the degeneracy will be completely removed ) .",
    "if exactly one electron sits on each jt site , and if the coulomb repulsion is very large , the system will have an insulating gap , due to mott - hubbard correlations , and the low - energy spectrum will consist of spin and orbital excitations . for the @xmath1 case , which we are going to consider , the physics of the insulating state is governed by an exchange hamiltonian involving , besides the actual spin @xmath3 , also a pseudo - spin-1/2 variable @xmath4 , representing the orbital degrees of freedom . unlike the case of a non - degenerate orbital , where antiferromagnetism is favored , one finds here a rich phase diagram , depending on the energy of the two - particle intermediate states available for virtual hopping.@xcite if hund s rule coupling is the dominant effect , the lowest doubly occupied site is a spin triplet , and spin ferromagnetism turns out to be favored.@xcite many experimental systems,@xcite including possibly the case of tdae - c@xmath5,@xcite may fit into such a scenario . in the present paper we are going to consider a different regime , i.e. , when the coupling to vibrons is strong enough that an inter - orbital singlet state becomes the lowest - energy doubly - occupied virtual state .",
    "we are going to argue that new interesting phases can show up in this case .",
    "the exchange hamiltonian for this case can be shown to be related to the following spin - model:@xcite @xmath6 we will show that , in this case , valence bond ( vb ) states tend to be favored , at least in low enough spatial dimensions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ intro_model : sec ] introduces the hopping model that we will consider . in section [ spin_ham : sec ] we will discuss in detail the hamiltonian @xmath7 in eq .",
    "( [ hst_intro : eqn ] ) . in section [ tst : sec ] we study the behavior of the model upon introduction of holes , in one dimension . finally , section [ conclusion : sec ] contains our conclusions , and some open issues .",
    "suppose that at each site @xmath2 of the lattice we have two degenerate electronic orbitals and two degenerate phonon modes , of frequency @xmath8 , both labeled by an orbital quantum number @xmath9 .",
    "let @xmath10 be the creation operator for an electron with spin @xmath11 and orbital quantum number @xmath12 at site @xmath2 , and @xmath13 the phonon operator . in a standard @xmath1 jahn - teller problem , the on site",

    "we will also consider electron - electron terms , which include a hubbard intra - orbital repulsion @xmath17 , an inter - orbital repulsion @xmath18 , and an exchange ( hund s ) coupling @xmath19 , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the spin operator for the @xmath12orbital .",
    "assume now that there are ( small ) electronic hopping processes between the different sites described by a standard tight - binding hamiltonian .",

    "spin ferromagnetism is the natural outcome of such a scenario.@xcite the jahn - teller coupling can change this picture considerably .",
    "first of all , standard polaronic effects lead to a decrease of the energy of the singlet states , primarily the inter - orbital singlet @xmath46 , with respect to the triplet states @xmath47.@xcite second , the effective hopping matrix element @xmath39 turns out to be larger for the singlet @xmath46 than for the other states .",
    "@xcite gives the results for the @xmath48 s obtained from perturbation theory in @xmath49 , accurate to order @xmath50 : @xmath51 in the opposite strong electron - phonon coupling case , @xmath52 , it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that , again , the most important doubly - occupied state is the inter - orbital singlet @xmath46 , and the model can be mapped into a single - band hamiltonian with a spin-1 variable attached to each site.@xcite this also leads to a situation in which , effectively , @xmath32 is the only coupling left in the problem.@xcite    the mean field phase diagram of the model ( [ general_h : eqn ] ) has been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , together with a few special points where exact solutions can be obtained in @xmath53 . as it turns out , there is a region of the phase diagram , not considered so far , where , as we will argue below , valence bonds ( vb ) are favored .",
    "the physical regime in which this region is of relevance is precisely the jt limit in which @xmath32 is the largest coupling in the problem , i.e. , the two - particle inter - orbital singlet has lower energy than the corresponding triplet .",
    "more in detail , let us assume that @xmath54 and define @xmath55 . in a bipartite lattice the effective hamiltonian , after performing the canonical transformation @xmath56 , can be written as : @xmath57 where @xmath58 \\;,\\ ] ] and @xmath59 \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\,+ 4j_{\\pm } \\sum_{<rr ' > } ( 2 { \\bf s}_r \\cdot { \\bf s}_{r ' } -1/2 )   ( t^z_r t^z_{r ' } + 1/4 ) \\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the next section we will concentrate on @xmath60 , showing first of all that it certainly has a vb - solid ground state in @xmath53 , and suggesting that the same might be true in @xmath61 . the presence of a gap in the excitation spectrum implies the robustness of such a phase with respect to a small enough perturbation @xmath62 .",
    "next , we will consider the question of the behavior of a valence bond state upon doping .",
    "the resulting generalization of the @xmath63 model will be discussed , for the @xmath53 case , in section [ tst : sec ] .",
    "as previously discussed , when there is exactly one electron per site ( @xmath28 ) and one assumes the inter - orbital singlet @xmath46 to be the only important intermediate two - particle state , the exchange hamiltonian governing the spin and orbital degrees of freedom can be written as @xmath64 where @xmath65 is a permutator between the spins at sites @xmath2 and @xmath66 , and similarly @xmath67 for the pseudo - spins .",
    "this form will be particularly useful in the following .",
    "this model shows an obvious spin and pseudospin rotation invariance described by the @xmath68 group .",
    "however , the full symmetry group displayed by ( [ st_2:eqn ] ) is much larger and includes @xmath69 .",
    "indeed , one can show that , in a bipartite lattice , @xmath7 commutes with the 15 operators @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 which generate the lie algebra @xmath73 @xcite . due to the staggering in the @xmath74 operators , these generators _",
    "do not _ commute with the spatial symmetries which interchange the two sublattices .",
    "therefore , the full symmetry group is even larger than the aforementioned @xmath69 .",
    "finally , we notice that this hamiltonian differs from the exactly soluble @xmath69 sutherland model @xmath75 obtained by a natural generalization of the heisenberg hamiltonian .",
    "rather , it is possible to show that the @xmath76-invariant model introduced by affleck @xcite @xmath77 is unitarily equivalent to @xmath78 for @xmath79 . here",
    "@xmath80 and @xmath81 generate , respectively , the fundamental and anti - fundamental representations of @xmath76.@xcite    in @xmath53 , affleck has shown that @xmath82 , in the limit @xmath83 , has two simple vb - solid ground states , illustrated in fig .  [",
    "vbgs : fig ] .",
    "moreover , the @xmath84 case has also been shown to have a dimerized ground state , although with a large spin - spin correlation length.@xcite as the tendency to dimerization is likely to increase with @xmath0,@xcite we expect that the @xmath79 case , of interest to us , will also have a vb - solid type of ground state .",
    "this expectation will be explicitly shown to be correct in @xmath53 .",
    "let us first show that singlet bonds between @xmath85 and @xmath86 variables are very natural objects to introduce in our problem , for any @xmath87 .",
    "if we denote by @xmath88 a singlet bond formed between the spins at @xmath2 and @xmath66 , it is easy to show that @xcite @xmath89 similar results apply to @xmath90 when acting on valence bonds formed from the pseudo - spin variables , @xmath91 . if we denote by @xmath92 the product of singlet bonds between @xmath2 and @xmath66 for both @xmath85 and @xmath86 , and by @xmath93 [ p^{(t)}_{rr'}-1]$ ] , we find that @xmath94 and @xmath95 first observation : the subspace of valence bond states in which bonds are simultaneously s- and t - singlets is left invariant by the hamiltonian .",
    "( in all figures , we will denote by a line such simultaneous s- and t - singlets . )",
    "such a subspace is , however , still overcomplete.@xcite in @xmath53 , nevertheless , if we apply @xmath7 any number of times to the valence bond solid in fig .  [ vbgs : fig ] , we generate a subset of valence bond configurations which are linearly independent ( although not orthogonal ) .",
    "these are the valence bond configurations associated to non - crossing lewis diagrams.@xcite it is known that such a basis can be conveniently used to work out efficient exact diagonalization algorithms in small chains.@xcite the ground state wave function for a chain of @xmath96 sites , for instance , can be easily obtained by solving a simple @xmath97 problem .",
    "[ 8siti : fig ] shows the result obtained for the ground state wave function , and the lowest excited state of momentum @xmath98 , in terms of vb configurations .",
    "second observation : as is apparent from eq .",
    "[ qaction : eqn ] , a nearest - neighbor bond contributes a diagonal energy of @xmath99 , whereas the off - diagonal matrix elements connecting different vb configurations are smaller by a factor @xmath100 , i.e. , @xmath101 . for the @xmath76-model of affleck , the off - diagonal matrix element are smaller by a factor @xmath102 , which implies that only diagonal energies are retained in the limit @xmath83 .",
    "the ground states , for @xmath103 , are therefore the vb configurations with the maximum number ( @xmath104 ) of nearest - neighbor bonds connected by vbs . in @xmath53 , there are only two such states , i.e. , the vb - solids in fig .",
    "[ vbgs : fig ] .    to check",
    "if the vb scenario remains correct for our @xmath79 case , we resort to exact lanczos diagonalizations of chains up to @xmath105 sites , and to green function monte carlo for longer chains . fig .",
    "[ gap1d : fig ] shows the finite - size value of the gap between the ground state and the first excited state both in the @xmath106 ( @xmath107 ) and in the @xmath108 sectors ( @xmath109 ) .",
    "the full symbols refer to @xmath7 , whereas the open symbols refer to two decoupled heisenberg chains ( no quartic term in eq .  [ st_1:eqn ] ) .",
    "all these excited states have momentum @xmath98 relative to the ground state . for the heisenberg case ,",
    "the excited state is a triplet and the model has gapless excitations with gaps decreasing as @xmath110 for @xmath111.@xcite for @xmath7 , the situation is different : the lowest excited state is a singlet , with a finite size gap @xmath112 decreasing faster than @xmath110 for @xmath111 .",
    "the triplet , instead , lies above with a gap @xmath113 extrapolating to a finite value as @xmath111 .",
    "this is a clear signal of a _ degenerate _ infinite volume ground state with a _",
    "spontaneous breaking of translational symmetry _ and a gap to all excitations , consistent with a vb phase",
    ". further support to this interpretation can be gained by direct inspection of the spin - spin correlations , @xmath114 , the dimer - dimer correlations along a chain @xmath115 , and on different chains @xmath116 .",
    "[ sq1d : fig ] shows a log - log plot of the size scaling of the peak of the different structure factors , located at momentum @xmath98 . while the dimer - dimer structure factor peaks , @xmath117 and @xmath118 , tend to diverge linearly with the length @xmath119 of the chain , the usual spin - spin structure factor tends to a finite value in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "finally , simple variational arguments also point to a vb ground state in @xmath53 , while being , we believe , not conclusive in @xmath61 . a vb phase benefits",
    "highly from the large values of @xmath120 on the singlet bonds , due to the presence of the `` square '' of the singlet contribution in the quartic term of @xmath7 , which enters with a factor @xmath100 .",
    "let us compare , for instance , the energy of the following two states : ( i ) the product of two independent heisenberg ground states , @xmath121 , and ( ii ) the product of two vb states , @xmath122 where each vb state has the simple form of a product of dimers on adjacent sites . in @xmath53 we take @xmath123 where @xmath124 denotes a singlet between sites @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "in @xmath61 we consider the simplest short range vb state : a columnar dimer state , or , equivalently , any state with nearest - neighbor pairs coupled into singlets in an arbitrary manner ( there is a huge degeneracy ) .",
    "the energy per site of the two states are : @xmath127 here @xmath128 ( @xmath2 and @xmath66 nearest neighbors ) and @xmath129 are the energy per site of the heisenberg ground state and of the vb state , respectively . for the heisenberg model we have @xmath130 ( in @xmath53 ) and @xmath131 ( in @xmath61 ) , whereas for the crude vb state considered here , the expression for @xmath132 turns out to be independent of @xmath87 .",
    "the factor @xmath133 in the expression for @xmath132 is due to the fact that only half of the bonds in the vb state enjoy the large singlet - singlet pairing @xmath134 . in spite of this reduction ,",
    "the coefficient of the quartic term is substantially larger for the vb state than for the heisenberg state in both @xmath53 and @xmath61 ( @xmath135 for the vb state , to be compared to @xmath136 and @xmath137 for the @xmath53 and @xmath61 heisenberg , respectively ) . in @xmath53",
    "the vb state wins over the heisenberg state . generally speaking , an increase in",
    "the coordination number tends to stabilize a nel - like antiferromagnet with respect to vb states . in @xmath61 ,",
    "the previous crude variational estimate would indeed give the heisenberg state as favored .",
    "the vb state considered here is , however , very poor : for instance , its energy per site , neglecting the quartic term , is only @xmath138 , whereas it is well known that short - range rvb states close in energy to the heisenberg ground state can be constructed.@xcite as a consequence , we believe the present variational estimate to be not conclusive in @xmath61 .    in case the vb picture",
    "should be energetically favored , we face the problem of determining the possible orderings of the dimers in the lattice . in principle , either a vb crystal with broken translational symmetry or a homogeneous spin liquid may occur .",
    "following affleck s @xmath53 approach , @xcite a possible way of tackling this problem , in @xmath61 , is from the @xmath83 limit . for @xmath103 , once again , all the states made up of the maximum possible number ( @xmath104 ) of nearest - neighbor s- and t - vbs  we refer to them as nnvb configurations ",
    "are degenerate , linearly independent ( although not orthogonal ) ground states .",
    "contrary to the @xmath53 case , where only two such states exist ( see fig .",
    "[ vbgs : fig ] ) , in @xmath61 this implies a huge degeneracy . for @xmath83",
    ", however , there are off - diagonal matrix elements connecting different nnvb states ( smaller by a factor @xmath102 , as previously discussed ) , which lift this degeneracy to first order .",
    "it is straightforward to verify , using eq .",
    "[ qaction : eqn ] , that the effective hamiltonian within the subspace of nnvb states ( to first order in @xmath102 ) is just the quantum dimer model ( qdm ) first introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath139 for the particular case of @xmath140 .",
    "( here @xmath141 and @xmath142 schematically indicate adjacent s- and t - vbs in the y and x direction . )",
    "the qdm is known to have a _",
    "columnar solid _ phase in a region of parameter space close to @xmath140.@xcite recently , an exact diagonalization study of the qdm has revealed that such a columnar solid phase has , more precisely , the features of a plaquette rvb , i.e.  translational invariance in one direction is spontaneously broken , but the spin - peierls `` columns '' are disordered as a consequence of a resonance of parallel bonds in each plaquette.@xcite this picture would yield a fourfold degenerate ground state in two dimensions .",
    "we conclude that , for @xmath83 , our model has a columnar vb phase in @xmath61 .",
    "given the fact that our crude variational calculation appears to favor a nel state in @xmath61 , we believe that the issue of the actual behavior of our @xmath79-case , @xmath7 , in @xmath61 is still open .",
    "this issue will be addressed in a future numerical study.@xcite",
    "the motion of holes in a vb state has been the subject of considerable research starting from the early works on high temperature superconductivity @xcite .",
    "now , we are able to investigate this problem on the basis of a consistent microscopic model which does have a vb solid as a ground state . this study may shed light on the issue whether holons and spinons decouple in vb states and whether the vb spin background favors effective hole - hole attraction .",
    "therefore , we analyze in some detail the case of filling @xmath143 in one dimension . for large repulsive interactions",
    "( small @xmath48 ) the effective hamiltonian describing the system is simply the analog of the @xmath63 model @xmath144 where @xmath145 is the hopping part of the original hamiltonian ( eq .  [ model : eqn ] ) , @xmath146 is the projector onto states without double occupancy , and @xmath147 is the occupation number operator . in @xmath53 ,",
    "analogously to the hubbard case , @xcite the ( real - space ) wavefunction _ factorizes _ , for @xmath148 , into a spinless fermion part times the wavefunction of a suitable spin hamiltonian @xmath149 on the _ squeezed chain _",
    "@xcite @xmath150 the position of the electrons is determined by the spinless fermion wavefunction @xmath151 , while the spin and orbital ordering is governed by a spin hamiltonian which is obtained by taking the average of @xmath152 over the spinless fermion state .",
    "the result is simply related , by an overall change of energy scale and a canonical transformation , to the previous spin model @xmath7 ( eq .  [ st_2:eqn ] ) : @xmath153 \\sum_{<ij > }   ( { \\bf s}_i \\cdot { \\bf s}_{j } - \\frac{1}{4 } )   ( -{\\bf t}_i \\cdot { \\bf t}_{j } + 2 t^z_i t^z_j - \\frac{1}{4 } ) \\;.\\ ] ] the physical origin of this factorization relies on a general feature of one dimensional models with nearest neighbor hopping : in the @xmath154 limit , the spatial ordering of the particles is conserved by the dynamical evolution , irrespectively of the spin configuration .",
    "therefore , the hamiltonian can be diagonalized in each subspace defined by a given spin ordering and the result does not depend on the chosen spin configuration .",
    "the effective hamiltonian governing the charge degrees of freedom is that of a free spinless fermion gas ( with suitable boundary conditions which do depend on the spin wavefunction @xcite ) whose eigenfunctions are @xmath155 .",
    "the degeneracy among different spin configurations is lifted to @xmath156 by the magnetic term in @xmath152 ( [ htst : eqn ] ) , leading to the complete classification ( [ factor ] ) of the eigenstates of @xmath152 to lowest order in @xmath48 .",
    "the spin hamiltonian in eq .",
    "[ hspin : eqn ] , we argued before , has a spin gap .",
    "therefore , we conclude that , while the charge sector is gapless ( metallic ) for large positive @xmath157 and @xmath158 , _ the spin sector is gapped at all densities _ and has a doubly degenerate ground state in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "however , such a spin gap is not related to the formation of bound electron pairs .",
    "in fact , the charge degrees of freedom behave as free particles with no tendency towards pairing : the superconductive correlations are not enhanced in the ground state and decay as @xmath159 .",
    "this state can be rather interpreted as the one dimensional realization of an `` itinerant '' valence bond state where spinons bind , leaving holons in a luttinger liquid state .",
    "( the situation is quite similar to the strong coupling phase of the @xmath160 hubbard model in @xmath53 , for @xmath161.@xcite ) the very presence of such a phase is then a remarkable consequence of one dimensional spin  charge decoupling .",
    "the factorization of the wavefunction at @xmath148 can be used to calculate various physical quantities of this spin - gapped metallic phase , following analogous calculations in the hubbard case.@xcite in particular , density correlation functions just coincide with those of a spinless fermion gas , showing power law decay at large distances ( @xmath159 ) while the spin - spin ( and pseudospin ) correlation still decays exponentially , similarly to the half filled case .",
    "another interesting property which can be evaluated is the one - hole green s function providing a quantitative description of the motion of one hole in a short range vb state .",
    "the picture of a static vb crystal would yield an exponentially decaying green s function in real space , but 1d fluctuations severely affect the asymptotic form of the green s function .",
    "the calculation can be carried out exactly in the @xmath148 limit , where the factorization property of all eigenfunctions holds .",
    "in fact , in this limit , the energy levels of a single hole in a vb state coincide with those of a free particle in vacuum plus @xmath156 corrections depending on the energy of the spin background .",
    "moreover , the energy , to lowest order , just depends on the _ holon momentum _ , i.e. on the momentum @xmath162 of the spinless fermion part of the wavefunction @xmath155 : @xmath163 . on the other hand ,",
    "the holon momentum is related to the total momentum @xmath164 of the state by the conservation law : @xmath165 . here",
    "@xmath166 is the momentum of the spin part of the wavefunction @xmath167 and is quantized in units of @xmath168 , the spin model being defined on the squeezed chain of @xmath169 sites .",
    "therefore , for @xmath148 , the one - hole energy levels of the model , at a given total momentum @xmath164 , can be written in terms of the spinon momentum : @xmath170 , i.e. , of the momentum of the spin part of the factorized wavefunction .",
    "the corresponding density of states coincides with that of a single free fermion : @xmath171 with singularities at the band edges @xmath172 .",
    "these singularities are due to the quadratic dependence of the energy spectrum on the holon momentum which will be probably cut - off by the presence of spin excitations to @xmath156 .",
    "the calculation of the single hole green s function @xmath173 is conveniently carried out by use of the lehmann representation of the corresponding spectral function : @xmath174 where , in the last equation , use has been made of the special form of the energy spectrum as @xmath148 .",
    "the usefulness of this representation rests on the knowledge of the weight function @xmath175 which , following ref .",
    "@xcite , can be written in terms of a non - local correlation function involving only spin ( and pseudospin ) variables : @xmath176 such a correlation function can be evaluated on the ground state of the @xmath7 hamiltonian by lanczos diagonalization and , similarly to the heisenberg model case , shows negligible size dependence .",
    "calculations have been carried out up to @xmath177 sites , and the results are shown in fig .  [ z : fig ] . a clear singularity in the quasiparticle weight @xmath175 is visible at the spinon fermi momentum @xmath178 .",
    "the analysis of lanczos data suggests a power law divergence as @xmath179 , in close similarity to the analogous behavior encountered in the _ gapless _ heisenberg model .",
    "a quantitative determination of the critical exponent is however precluded by the severe limitation in system size associated to the lanczos method . in the thermodynamic limit , this singularity gives rise to branch cuts in the analytic structure of the spectral function ( [ spectral ] ) : @xmath180 n(\\omega)\\ ] ] along the lines defined by @xmath181 , where @xmath182 i.e. at @xmath183 .",
    "the form of this dispersion relation suggests nearest neighbor hopping processes of the hole across the lattice .",
    "the overall picture of hole motion in a valence bond state is therefore quite similar to the case of holes in one dimensional quantum antiferromagnets , being characterized by power law tails in the single particle green s function at the dispersion energy @xmath184 .",
    "this behavior can be traced back to the presence of branches of _ gapless _ collective modes above the spin gap which allow the decay of the spin @xmath185 excitation created by the hole motion .",
    "these features of hole propagation should be contrasted to the properties of charges in ising antiferromagnets , where the excitation spectrum is discrete and the band is dispersionless .",
    "in this paper we have discussed in some detail a hopping model of strongly repelling electrons in the presence of local orbital degeneracies not removed by crystal field effects .    for the insulating case ( one electron per site and large coulomb repulsions ) we have studied a particular exchange hamiltonian , eq .",
    "( [ hst_intro : eqn ] ) .",
    "it describes the low - energy physics of this system in the regime in which the inter - orbital singlet is the lowest - energy intermediate state available to hopping .",
    "this regime tends to be further favored by a relatively strong electron - phonon coupling . at variance with the standard hund s rule case ( the high spin two - particle state has lowest energy ) , which would instead favor spin ferromagnetism",
    ", we find in our case a strong tendency to the formation of a statically ordered valence bond ( vb ) phase . in @xmath53 ,",
    "this has been firmly established by using variational arguments , a large-@xmath0 limit , and exact diagonalization results .",
    "given the presence of a sizeable spin - gap , weakly coupled chains should also have a vb ground state .",
    "more uncertain is , instead , the outcome in the isotropic @xmath61 case , where a large-@xmath0 approach would predict a columnar vb phase , whereas a crude variational calculation rather points to a nel - like antiferromagnet .",
    "a numerical study , presently under way , will clarify , we hope , this matter .",
    "finally , we have considered the behavior of the system upon hole doping in the @xmath53 case .",
    "the factorization of the wavefunctions , valid in the strong repulsive limit and peculiar to the @xmath53 case , is the crucial ingredient used to tackle the problem .",
    "the outcome is a kind of `` itinerant '' vb state , where charge degrees of freedom are gapless , but the spin and orbital degrees of freedom are gapped and vb - like .",
    "the motivation for our study has been primarily theoretical .",
    "originally inspired by dynamical jahn - teller molecular lattices , such as @xmath186 compounds , the ingredients used are , admittedly , extremely idealized , and not easily applicable to an existing realistic situation . in a real jt lattice , both the crystal field effect , and the intermolecular elastic coupling can not normally be neglected , and may favor a cooperative static jt distortion of all molecules.@xcite second , intermolecular electron hopping tends to be comparable , or even larger in comparison with relevant vibron energies . apart from this , realistic hopping matrix elements have a strong orientational dependence in more than one dimension , and , in general , there is no reason for neglecting overlap integrals between orbitals with different orbital quantum numbers ( see eq .",
    "( [ model : eqn ] ) ) .",
    "third , a detailed description of the structure of the doubly occupied states at each site brings in correction terms to the exchange hamiltonian which turns out to be , in general , strongly asymmetric in orbital space ( see eq .",
    "( [ delta_h : eqn ] ) ) .    on the opposite side ,",
    "the exchange hamiltonian we have studied is elegant , parameter - free and prototypical of strong correlations in an orbitally degenerate lattice .",
    "the physics uncovered has a definite robustness against `` small '' perturbations , due to the gap present in the excitation spectrum .",
    "the vb gapped state has a clear resemblance to a spin - peierls state in @xmath53 .",
    "the spin - gapped metal found upon doping is interesting .",
    "the basic ingredients needed for a realistic system to be a candidate vb described in this work are : i ) orbital degeneracy not trivially removed by cooperative jt and/or crystal field effects ; ii ) relatively large molecules with a strong electron - phonon coupling , so as to make the inter - orbital singlet favored as compared to the hund s rule triplet ; iii ) narrow bands with relatively large on - site hubbard @xmath17 , so as to stabilize a mott - hubbard insulator at exactly one electron per site ; iv ) reduced dimensionality .",
    "@xmath186 charge transfer compounds , based on @xmath187 ions,@xcite are potential candidates to the realization of such a scenario .",
    "@xmath186 has a triply degenerate @xmath188 molecular orbital , coupled to several intramolecular vibrations , resulting in an important dynamical jt effect.@xcite the electron - phonon coupling leads to a substantial pairing energy @xmath189 which is , however , overwon by a substantially larger hubbard @xmath190,@xcite resulting in a mott insulating behavior .",
    "the lattices tend to have anisotropic lattice constants , with a pronounced quasi - one - dimensional character.@xcite as for the virtual intermediate states of @xmath191 , singlets and triplet are close in energy , at least in solutions.@xcite if the triplet prevails , as is possibly the case in tdae-@xmath186,@xcite there can be spin ferromagnetism .",
    "we believe , however , there is room in some future system for the alternative possibility of a spin gap , and the formation of the spin - orbital vb state described here .",

    "the case of tdae - c@xmath5 is still quite controversial .",
    "first , the weak ferromagnetism observed reveals a strong anisotropy ; suggestions have been put forward that the actual exchange mechanism might be of antiferromagnetic nature ( dzyaloshinsky - moriya type ) with an overall canting , responsible for the observed ferromagnetism ( see r. blinc _ et al .  _ , , 523 ( 1996 ) ) .",
