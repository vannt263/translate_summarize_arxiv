    "according to standard solar models , the solar luminosity increased from about 70% of the present solar luminosity at 4.5 gyr before present ( bp ) to its present value .",
    "if earth were a black body , its temperature would have been @xmath1k lower , enough to have kept large parts of it frozen until about 1 - 2 gyr bp . besides however the past eon , and the eon between 2 and 3 gyr bp",
    ", it appears that glaciations were altogether absent from the global surface .",
    "this is the crux of the faint sun paradox [ _ sagan & mullen _ , 1972 ; _ pollack _ , 1991 ; _ sagan & chyba _ , 1997 ] .",
    "a common solution to this apparent paradox is that larger amounts of the greenhouse gas ( ghg ) co@xmath2 compensated for the cooler sun [ _ kuhn & kasting _ , 1983 ; _ kasting _ , 1993 ] .",
    "however , some upper limits on the atmospheric partial pressure of co@xmath2 ( @xmath3co@xmath2 ) suggest that it was at most modest . for example , _ rye et al . _ [ 1995 ] find @xmath3co@xmath4  bar between 2.2 and 2.7 gyr bp , with indications that it could not have been much higher earlier [ _ sleep & zahnle _ , 2001 ] . at these levels , the ghg warming could at most compensate for about half the reduction in the solar flux in the global radiation budget corresponds to the same global temperature change irrespective of whether it is due to extra solar flux in optical and near - ir or the blocking of far - ir due to a higher level of @xmath3co@xmath2 .",
    "this assumption is reasonable but not necessary . ] .",
    "thus , it appears that co@xmath2 could have been important for warming the early earth , but not sufficient to resolve the faint sun paradox by itself .",
    "note however that theoretical considerations do suggest that @xmath3co@xmath2 was higher in the early terrestrial atmosphere [ _ kasting _ , 1987 ] , such that it is likely that it did contribute at least some ghg warming .",
    "because of these problems , it was suggested that other ghgs could have been important for warming the young earth . in particular , it was suggested that small amounts of nh@xmath5 could have supplied the required ghg warming [ sagan & mullen , 1972 ; _ sagan & chyba _ , 1997 ] . although not impossible , it is not easy to keep nh@xmath5 from irreversibly photolyzing into h@xmath2 and n@xmath2 .",
    "another suggestion was that ch@xmath6 played the major ghg warmer [ _ pavlov et al .",
    "_ , 2000 ] .",
    "this solution requires a long residency time of methane in the atmosphere , and probably dominance of methanogenic bacteria .",
    "unfortunately , there are currently no reasonable bounds on the amounts of methane or ammonia in the early atmosphere .",
    "thus , this type of solutions can neither be ruled out , nor proven at his point .",
    "other effects are more certain but probably not large enough to solve the faint sun paradox .",
    "in particular , the young earth rotated faster than today and it may have had less land mass . employing a typical general circulation model ( gcm ) , it was found that removing the land mass altogether could increase the temperature by 4@xmath7k , while a 14 hr day would further increase the temperature by @xmath8k [ _ jenkins _ , 1993 ] .",
    "another solution to the faint sun paradox involves strong solar winds , such that the earlier solar mass was higher .",
    "a 10% more massive sun would have had a larger luminosity , enough to more than compensate for the early faint sun and also explain the observed lithium and beryllium depletion [ _ graedel et al .",
    "_ , 1991 ] .",
    "however , solutions with a relatively _ gradual _ loss of mass from the sun , with a typical time scale of @xmath9gyr ( as opposed to a mass loss time scale of a few 100 myr ) are inconsistent with helioseismology , rendering this solution less probable [ _ guzik & cox _ , 1995 ] .",
    "moreover , a solar wind history can be reasonably reconstructed if the sun is compared to similar nearby stars at various ages .",
    "this gives a benign mass loss which is insufficient to resolve the paradox at any time of the terrestrial history [ _ wood et al .",
    "_ , 2002 ] .",
    "nevertheless , even a modest mass loss could potentially have interesting implications .",
    "the stronger wind was more effective at lowering the galactic cosmic ray flux ( crf ) .",
    "this , as we shall soon see , can present yet another possibility for helping resolve the faint sun paradox .",
    "it should however be stressed that it is not unlikely that the true solution is a combination of several of the above factors .    various empirical evidence [ _ tinsley & deen _ , 1991 ; _ svensmark _ , 1998 ; _ egorova et al .",

    "link cosmic rays ( crs ) to climate on earth",
    ". the apparent crf / climate link could originate through an effect that atmospheric ionization , which is governed by the crf , may have on cloud formation . the empirical evidence is based on several significant correlations between the crf and climate on earth over times scales ranging from days to geological time scales .",
    "the theoretical and experimental evidence describe various elements of an emerging physical picture relating atmospheric ionization , through the formation of condensation nuclei by charged ion clusters , to the formation of clouds .",
    "even with the above evidence , this crf / climate link is still a highly debated topic .",
    "this is primarily because a robust physical picture is still missing . for an objective review ,",
    "the reader is encouraged to read _ carslaw et al . _  [ 2002 ] . it should be emphasized that the analysis which follows rests on the assumption that this link indeed exists  an issue which we will address again in list of caveats in  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "irrespective of the outcome of this debate , since there is now enough evidence to seriously consider the possibility of crs as a variable affecting the climate , we should consider the various implications of this link while bearing in mind that the underlying basis deserves extensive study .",
    "we begin in  [ sec : estimate ] with an estimate of the total warming effect that the strong early solar wind has had , and compare it to the cooling induced by the fainter sun . in  [ sec : evolution ] , we use the actual solar wind evolution ( as deduced from nearby stars ) combined with the variable star formation rate ( sfr ) in the milky way ( mw ) to calculate the evolution of the terrestrial temperature .",
    "we summarize our results in  [ sec : results ] and discuss them in  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we assume henceforth that cosmic rays do have a cooling effect .",
    "thus , the positive crf / low altitude cloud cover correlation [ _ svensmark _ , 1998 ) implies that a higher crf will have a net cooling effect under the suspected crf / climate link .",
    "second , the long term _",
    "positive _ correlation between crf variations and ice - age epochs suggests that there is a _ negative _ correlation between crf and temperature [ _ shaviv _ , 2002a , _ shaviv & veizer _ , 2003 ] . ] . under this assumption , the stronger wind of the young sun had a warming effect .",
    "this is because the stronger wind necessarily lowered the galactic crf reaching the inner solar system .",
    "a lower crf would in turn translate into higher temperatures through the crf / climate link .",
    "thus , a stonger solar wind should have had a warming effect that acted to compensate the solar dimness .    to quantify this effect ,",
    "two basic numbers are required .",
    "first , it is necessary to know the ratio between changes in the crf and changes in the global temperature .",
    "this will allow us to translate solar wind variations into temperature change on earth .",
    "second , if we wish to compare this effect with the lower temperature associated with the faint sun , and also with possible ghg warming , we need to know how changes in the radiation budget translate into a global temperature change .",
    "the relation between radiative forcing and temperature change is still an open and highly discussed question in climatology . for a blackbody earth , this number is 0.30@xmath7k/(w",
    "/ m@xmath10 ) .",
    "earth however does not behave as a black body , and various positive and negative feedbacks act to either amplify or decrease this number by a factor @xmath11 .",
    "values obtained in gcms [ _ ipcc _ , 1995 ] range between @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "there are however debated claims that various negative feedbacks should be considered , yielding a much smaller @xmath11 of @xmath14 [ _ lindzen et al .",
    "_ , 2001 ] , or even @xmath15 [ _ ou _ , 2001 ]",
    ". this number was also obtained from analyses of actual temperature variations .",
    "for example , from the rather quick return of the global temperature to its  average \" after a series of volcanic erruptions , it was deduced that @xmath16 with @xmath17 being inconsistent with the effects of volcanic driving [ _ lindzen & giannitsis _ , 1998 ] . on the other hand , _ gregory et al . _ [ 2002 ] find that a lower limit of @xmath18 ( at 95% confidence ) can be placed by considering the increase of ocean heat content .",
    "another constraint was obtained by _",
    "covey et al . _",
    "[ 1996 ] who compared @xmath3co@xmath2 changes to temperature variations over geological time scales ( in particular , the last glacial maximum , the crataceous and early eocene ) .",
    "the authors of this study found that @xmath11 is consistent with the range of values obtained in gcms .",
    "however , the latter two constraints were obtained while neglecting the possible forcing of the crf and the nonthermal solar activity .",
    "thus , if crf / climate link is real , these two constraints are not applicable anymore .    once crf variations are considered over geological time scales , a markable correlation is obtained between crf as a driver and temperature change .",
    "this correlation , combined with the lack of correlation with @xmath3co@xmath2 variations , yields @xmath19 ( or @xmath20 at 90% confidence and @xmath21 at 99% confidence ) [ _ shaviv & veizer _ , 2003 ] .",
    "thus , _ if the crf / climate connection is valid _",
    ", which we assume here to be the case , we should consider @xmath19 as the most probable value , but also @xmath22 as an extreme upper limit .",
    "the same combined geological and astronomical analysis [ _ shaviv & veizer _ , 2003 ] could also measure the relation between temperature change and relative crf variations , which was parameterized through the form @xmath23,\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the energy flux reaching the troposphere ( to which the ionization is proportional ) , and @xmath25 is the flux reaching today .",
    "the power @xmath26 relates changes in the ionization rate to changes in global temperature .",
    "since the expected route is most likely through the effect that atmospheric ionization has on the formation of condensation nuclei , we should have @xmath27 [ _ yu _ , 2002 ; _ harrison & aplin _ , 2001 ] .",
    "it was also found that @xmath28c , where most of the uncertainty is due to the inaccurate determination of the crf variations from meteorites .",
    "we reduced here the upper range .",
    "although a larger @xmath29 is consistent with the meteoritic data , it is physically inconsistent as it requires too large an albedo variation of earth to be physically reasonable , as will soon be evident .    when the solar system was young , the solar wind is expected to have been significantly stronger .",
    "this implies that most of the crf responsible for tropospheric ionization was blocked ( i.e. , the energy flux satisfied @xmath30 ) . today , for comparison",
    ", the flux variations are only @xmath31 .",
    "thus , we should expect an average global surface temperature increase of @xmath32k , when the wind was significantly stronger than today .",
    "next , the decrease in solar luminosity as we go back to the end of the heavy bombardment era ( at about 4 gyr bp ) , is about @xmath925% .",
    "this is an inevitable result of all standard models .",
    "the only astrophysical remedy is having a heavier younger sun .",
    "however , as mentioned in the introduction , a strong and slowly decaying wind that would allow the young sun to be bright for a long enough duration , is inconsistent with the winds of nearby stars [ _ wood et al .",
    "_ , 2002 ] .",
    "the @xmath33 reduction in solar flux corresponds to a decrease of @xmath960  w  m@xmath34 relative to the @xmath35  w  m@xmath34 reaching the surface today . for @xmath36 or",
    "@xmath37 , the average global surface temperature decrease @xmath38 associated with the fainter sun is @xmath39k , @xmath40k or @xmath41k respectively .",
    "thus , for climate sensitivities consistent with the crf / climate link ( @xmath42 ) , we find that the solar dimness can in principle be completely compensated for .    nevertheless , to actually obtain @xmath43",
    ", we require values of @xmath11 and @xmath29 which are consistent with observations but are theoretically uncomfortable .",
    "for example , @xmath44k with @xmath45 implies that crs change the albedo by 28% , which is nearly impossible .",
    "the more reasonable values of @xmath46k and @xmath47 yield a more realistic albedo change of 12.5% . in this case",
    "however , @xmath48k relative to today .",
    "this implies that the average hadean and archean temperatures would have been well above freezing .",
    "however , a full resolution of the faint sun paradox requires the temperatures at these epochs to have been higher than today , since current day earth has glaciations , while glaciations where absent from the young earth ( e.g. , _ crowell _ [ 1999 ] ) .    with @xmath49 ,",
    "the missing @xmath50k can be compensated with @xmath51  w  m@xmath34 .",
    "this could arise from a  modest \" ghg warming .",
    "for example , @xmath52  bar of co@xmath2 , which is about half of the present upper limits at @xmath53 gyr bp [ _ rye et al .",

    "_ , 1998 ] ] , ensuring that the early climate was warm enough to inhibit the appearance of glaciations .",
    "to estimate the secular change in the solar wind modulation of the crf , we first require the evolution of the solar wind parameters ( i.e. , mass loss rate and velocity ) .",
    "we will then translate this evolution to variations in the crf reaching earth .    for the evolution of the mass loss rate @xmath57",
    ", we use the observational results of _ wood et al . _",
    "[ 2002 ] who found that the mass loss rate of nearby solar - like stars ( main sequence stars of spectral type g and k ) evolves as : @xmath58 with @xmath59 .",
    "next , we take the velocity of the wind to be constant .",
    "this is because the terminal wind velocity depends primarily on the escape velocity from the sonic radius of the wind , which is expected to change only logarithmically with the mass loss rate ( e.g. , _ lamers & cassinelli _ [ 1999 ] ) .",
    "this implies that to first approximation we can take @xmath60 in a relation of the form @xmath61 , but we leave @xmath62 as a free parameter for generality .",
    "the energy loss suffered by crs as they journey from the heliopause to earth is through multiple scattering off the magnetic field of the solar wind .",
    "the average energy lost , for crs with energies significantly larger than their rest mass , can be approximated with @xmath63 [ _ perko _ , 1987 ] , where @xmath64 is the radius of the heliopause and @xmath65 is a constant proportional to @xmath66 , the diffusion coefficient of crs in the solar wind .",
    "this expression is valid _ only if _ @xmath67",
    ", @xmath68 and @xmath69 . thus , for the calculation of the energy loss we further require the scaling of both @xmath64 and @xmath66 with @xmath57",
    ".    the value of @xmath64 can be obtained by equilibrating the solar wind ram pressure at its termination @xmath70 with the average pressure of the interstellar medium ( ism ) , which we assume to remain constant on average .",
    "this yields @xmath71 .",
    "the diffusion coefficient @xmath66 depends on the effective mean free path @xmath72 arising from the larmour gyration of the crs in the disordered magnetic field of the solar wind . since @xmath73",
    ", we have @xmath74 .",
    "thus , the last scaling we seek is in the form @xmath75 . it would allow us to relate @xmath57 to changes in @xmath76 .    at the radius of earth s orbit ,",
    "the magnetic field energy density in the solar wind is typically 50 times smaller than the kinetic energy density of the wind .",
    "however , magnetic field fluctuations should decay as @xmath77 [ _ jokipii_,1973 ] , ( whether frozen - in or alfvnic wave fluctuations ) , implying that at a few solar radii , where the solar wind is accelerated , the magnetic field energy density ( @xmath78 ) is comparable to the kinetic energy density ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "although the current mass loss is probably not unique , we find equipartition between the two energy densities at the acceleration region of the wind .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to assume that this tendency for equipartition remains also for different @xmath57 s .",
    "in such a case , @xmath80 at any given radius .",
    "this implies that @xmath81 if equipartition remains .    the combination of these scalings yields @xmath82 , with @xmath83 . with nominal mass loss evolution ( @xmath84 ) , constant wind velocity ( @xmath85 ) and aforementioned equipartition ( @xmath86 )",
    ", we have @xmath87 .    the crf spectrum ( i.e. , the differential number flux ) in the ism can be written as @xmath88 for energies greater than about @xmath89  gev , where @xmath90 is the cr number flux",
    ", @xmath91 is a normalization constant , and @xmath92 .",
    "furthermore , the differential number flux @xmath93 reaching earth is related to @xmath94 through @xmath95 . since only crs with an energy larger than the cutoff energy @xmath96  gev",
    "can actually reach the troposphere , we find that the total energy @xmath97 deposited in the troposphere is @xmath98 more interesting is the energy flux at a time @xmath99 ( after the formation of the solar system ) relative to the flux today , at @xmath100 .",
    "we define @xmath101 .",
    "since @xmath102  gev [ _ perko _ , 1987 ] , we have @xmath103 , and also @xmath104    eq .  [ eq : crft ] for the temperature change induced by the wind evolution now becomes : @xmath105 d,\\ ] ] where @xmath106 is the nearby sfr to which the crf is proportional myr .",
    "because this time scale is practically instantaneous ( relative to 4 gyrs ) and because crs ( at 10 gev ) originate from supernova explosions , the crf will be proportional to the sfr ( see references in _ shaviv _ [ 2002b ] ) . ] .",
    "for the sfr , we take the results of _ rocha pinto et al . _",
    "[ 2000 ] who derived the mw sfr by analyzing the chromospheric ages of hundreds of late type dwarfs .",
    "the results of this comprehensive study are consistent with previous analyses , such as _ barry _ [ 1988 ] who too used chromospheric ages , or _ scalo _ [ 1987 ] who studied the mass distribution of nearby stars . in particular",
    ", it appears that the sfr was higher than average between 2 and 3 gyr before present , while it was below average between 1 and 2 gyr bp .",
    "interestingly , the mw sfr activity is correlated with sfr activity in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) .",
    "it appears that there was a significant increase in the sfr in the lmc around 2 gyr bp [ _ gallagher et al .",
    "_ , 1996 ; _ vallenari et al . _ , 1996 ; _ dopita et al .",
    "_ , 1997 ] and that between 0.7 to 2 gyr bp , the sfr in the lmc was below its average [ _ westerlund_,1990 ]",
    ". this correlation could be coincidental , but may reflect the tidal interactions between the two galaxies , during their perigalactica sometime around 0.2 - 0.5 gyr bp and around 1.6 - 2.6 gyr bp [ _ gardiner et al .",
    "_ , 1994 ; _ lin et al .",
    "_ , 1995 ] .",
    "irrespective of the origin of the sfr variability , it modulated the crf reaching the solar system , and presumably also climate on earth .",
    "the fact that the moon was closer to earth , and both were rotating faster [ _ zharkov _ , 2000 ] and that earth probably had a smaller land mass are not large effects by themselves [ _ jenkins _ , 1993 ] .",
    "we will not try to model them accurately . nevertheless , _",
    "jenkins _ [ 1993 ] has shown that no land mass and a 14 hr day will correspond to an average global temperature increase of typically 5.5@xmath7k .",
    "this however was obtained with gcm models which typically have @xmath107 .",
    "if , on the other hand , negative feedbacks exist to reduce @xmath11 , the increase in temperature will be smaller accordingly . for @xmath108",
    ", we should expect that the whole effect of no land mass and a faster rotation would contribute only a @xmath109k warming that gradually decreases with time between the formation of earth and today .    to mimic these two effects ,",
    "we approximate the temperature correction using @xmath110   2.2^\\circ$]k where @xmath111  gyr is the time today .",
    "this is not a large correction at all , but unlike effects such as ghg warming by nh@xmath5 or ch@xmath6 , which can potentially be much larger , the effects of land mass and rotation can be considered somewhat more quantitatively .",
    "using the above physical components , we proceed to calculate the evolution of the average terrestrial temperature .",
    "the results are depicted in fig .  1 for various models which either include or exclude the solar wind / crf effect using nominal values for the parameters , the effects of radiative forcing , and also the possibility of ghg warming by modest levels of @xmath3co@xmath2",
    ".        the figure recapitulates the main conclusion of  [ sec : estimate ] .",
    "namely , coupling the crf / climate effect to the stronger wind of the young sun , results with a higher temperature .",
    "the effect is large , but if the nominal values are used it compensates only @xmath112 s of the temperature reduction associated with the dim sun .",
    "thus , either the crf effect is larger than inferred from the nominal parameters , or more likely , there is some ghg warming .    by estimating the actual evolution of the temperature",
    ", we find additional conclusions to those obtained in  [ sec : estimate ] .",
    "first , the effects of sfr variability , spiral arm passages and ghg warming are all comparable in amplitude .",
    "second , because of the different time scales associated with the slowly varying sfr and the  fast \" oscillations associated with spiral arm passages ( over @xmath113  yr ) , we find that at any epoch with a given sfr , a range of temperatures should exist from spiral arm variability .",
    "in other words , in addition to the statistical error on the average sfr [ _ rochapinto et al .",
    "_ , 2000 ] , we should consider that the location within the mw gives rise to additional variability of the current crf [ _ lavielle et al .",
    "_ , 1999 ; _ shaviv _ , 2002b ] but periods during which the solar system spent near spiral arms , the solar system was bathed with a flux higher than today , which presumably reduced the global temperatures enough to allow glaciations . ] .",
    "thus , not only is the _ average _ important , but also the expected lower limit of the temperature range if we wish to compare with geological evidence for the presence of glaciations . on the other hand ,",
    "if we had a good record for the presence of extremely high temperatures , then the expected upper limit of the temperature range would have been the important variable .    if we study fig .  1 and consider models with the nominal parameters of @xmath108 and @xmath114k , we find that only during the past eon ( neo - proterozoic  phanerozoic period ) , and the period of 2 - 3 gyr bp ( late - archean ",
    "huronian ) could there have been climatic periods during which it was cold enough as to produce temperatures lower than today and explain glaciations .",
    "this is consistent with the actual geological evidence , which indicates that only during the neo - proterozoic and phanerozoic ( past eon ) , during the huronean ( 2.2 - 2.4 gyr bp ) and late archean ( 2.9 - 3.0 gyr bp ) were glaciations present on earth ( e.g. , _",
    "crowell _ [ 1999 ] ) .",
    "the exception is the first eon , which for the nominal parameters should have been cold enough to have had glaciations ( though not as cold as 2.5 gyr bp ) .",
    "since there is no evidence to support their existence , we return back to the point that even a modest ghg contribution , for example , by a modest 0.01  bar co@xmath2 atmosphere , can raise the temperature of the very young earth such that with the reduced crf , the temperature is kept above today s values .",
    "the solid line is the nominal model with @xmath3co@xmath2 kept at todays value while the dashed line has a saturation @xmath3co@xmath2 of 0.02 bar before 3 gyr bp .",

    "_ panel ( f ) _ describes the effect of a changed climatic sensitivity to crf changes .",
    "the normalization is such that for today s flux , which is about @xmath117 higher than the average over the past eon , the temperature is @xmath118c . ]",
    "2 is a parameter study showing the effects of changing various model parameters from their nominal values .",
    "it is apparent from the figure that there are two types of parameters .",
    "the first type are those which affect the total crf / solar wind effect when the solar wind is completely switched off , or affect the way in which the effect of the dim sun translates into a temperature change .",
    "these parameters determine the gross temperature behavior .",
    "for example , @xmath11 , @xmath29 and maximum level of @xmath3co@xmath2 determine the temperature on the very young earth . the second type of parameters are secondary in the sense that they only affect the evolution of the temperature between the young earth and today .",
    "a good example is the power @xmath115 determining the temporal evolution of @xmath57 .",
    "it does not affect the temperature in the extremely young atmosphere nor the temperature today , since the former is obtained in the limit of a very strong wind ( irrespective of how strong it actually is ) , and the latter is simply given by the current @xmath57 .    among the secondary parameters ,",
    "the most important is the power @xmath26 which relates the ionization rate to temperature fluctuations .",
    "the value @xmath119 is theoretically preferred [ _ harrison & aplin _",
    ", 2001 ; _ yu _ , 2002 ] .",
    "a higher @xmath26 would imply that crf variability arising from a variable sfr and passages through spiral arms becomes more prominent .",
    "nevertheless , all the secondary parameters are not particularly important .",
    "although future variability of the mw sfr can not be predicted , we can predict the future evolution of the solar luminosity and the decrease in strength of the solar wind . since the solar wind currently filters out only about 10% of the cosmic rays responsible for tropospheric ionization ( with energies @xmath120  gev ) , the cooling effect of the solar - wind / crf coupling is almost at its fullest .",
    "this implies that from now on , in the coming few billion years , the global temperature is expected only to increase on average .",
    "this is exemplified in the fig .",
    "this is not to say that bursts of star formation could reduce the temperature  temporarily \" , for example , when the lmc will be swallowed by the mw .",
    "we expect that within about 1.5 gyr , the long term average global temperature will increase to values higher than anytime previously ( i.e. , @xmath121c ) , at which point the negative temperature excursions arising from spiral arm passages and a higher sfr will not cool earth down to current day temperatures , and no more ice - age epochs will ever appear . from about 2 gyr into the future , even spiral arm passages and a higher sfr will not be able to reduce the global temperature to below the warmest temperature experienced in the past 4 gyr .",
    "we combined here the proposition that crf variations affect the global climate with the prediction that the early solar wind should have been stronger than today .",
    "this was shown to result with the following conclusions :    1 .",
    "the stronger wind of the young sun was more effective at blocking the crf reaching earth such that the crf was significantly reduced when compared with the current flux .",
    "when coupled to the suggested crf / temperature link , the lower crf reaching earth should have translated into a higher global temperature .",
    "3 .   using the apparent correlation between crf variability and global temperature over the past 550 myr [ _ shaviv & veizer _ , 2003 ] , it is possible to quantify this effect .",
    "it was found that the associated warming was enough to significantly compensate for the _ faint sun _ and explain about @xmath122 to @xmath123 s of the temperature increase required to warm the young earth to above the average temperature today .",
    "the remaining @xmath124 to @xmath125 could come from one of the previously suggested factors , such as ghg warming by _ modest levels _ of co@xmath2 ( @xmath3co@xmath2 of order 0.01 bar ) , which are consistent with the geological constraints .",
    "besides explaining the secular climate trend , the evolution of the solar wind also reproduces , essentially without any free parameters , long term temperature trends on earth once the variable sfr in the mw is considered . in particular , the crf evolution explains why earth has had glaciations in the past eon and between 2 and 3 gyr bp .",
    "although the  fine \" details of a variable sfr and the passage through spiral arms can not be predicted to more than several 100 myr into the future , it is possible to extrapolate the decrease in solar wind and the increase in solar flux . it is found that from about 1.5 billion years into the future , earth is expected to be warmer on average than anytime in its previous history .",
    "this is because the crf reaching earth is currently about as large as it can be .      1 .",
    "first and foremost , the aforementioned conclusions rest on the assumption that the crf / climate connection is indeed real .",
    "since this link still lacks a robust physical picture to support it ( and is therefore still a subject of debate ) , it clearly deserves extensive study , especially in view of the repercussions that it has .",
    "for example , it bears consequences on the value of the radiative forcing , since only a low value is consistent with the crf / climate link .",
    "2 .   even if we were safe to assume that the crf climate connection is real , since the process is not fully understood , it is not trivial to guaranty that it also operated before the past eon , during which periodic ice - age epochs existed . in particular , the crf / climate link could depend on a biogenic agent which may have been absent during the archean or early proterozoic earth . the link could also depend on atmospheric composition which undergone a few notable changes over the eons .",
    "we have neglected in the present analysis additional effects that may be important but hard to quantify .",
    "these include for example effects of atmospheric composition , land mass characteristics ( area and albedo ) , and even galactic migration of the solar system",
