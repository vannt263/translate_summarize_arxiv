    "dynamics of social networks are receiving increasing attention in multiple research domains @xcite .",
    "theoretical developments posit that dynamics are influenced by network @xcite and social processes @xcite ; with recent theory suggesting that the two co - evolve @xcite . methods to explore dynamics of networks traditionally implement evolving graph models , using inferential statistics to assert the likelihoods of the creation , maintenance or dissolution of edges .",
    "two distinct classes of modeling exist : 1 ) exclusively modeling the effect of network structures on dynamics @xcite , and 2 ) modeling effects of social parameters and network effects for small networks ( @xmath0 1000 nodes ) @xcite . both types of models prove that network processes affect the dynamics of networks .",
    "network models have been able to accurately predict a small percentage of edges , suggesting that dynamics may also be fed by other processes .",
    "social - parameter models have proved social attributes , in combination with network structures , play a role in network dynamics .    despite this growing knowledge from both model classes , these models have limitations .",
    "the main limitation relates to using an evolving graph model which calculates statistical probabilities of individual nodes .",
    "this approach generally leads to a super - linear growth in computational load as the network size increases , partly caused by the quadratic growth in the number of links that need to be considered .",
    "both models attempt to overcome this through different means .",
    "one is limited to either testing the effect of a few parameters on a large network , or a number of parameters on small networks .",
    "consequently , neither provide a terrain to empirically confirm the effect of both network and social parameters in large social networks .    in order to better understand the dynamics of large social networks , a different computational approach must be taken to overcome the issue of scalability in present models . in this paper",
    "we review the two existing model classes used to investigate dynamic social networks , and present a model for overcoming a number of acknowledged limitations . using a mean - field model approach we are able to overcome scalability issues in previous models through aggregation of individual nodes .",
    "parameters are developed using a data - aware approach which combines empirical research from social science and standard inferential statistics to develop a population - specific model for exploring the dynamics of collaboration in science .",
    "we consider the question whether mean - field modelling allows us to describe the behavior of a social system , considering a number of network and social parameters . in this first application of the mean - field model to large social networks",
    ", we aim to explain the effect of a set of parameters governing networking patterns of collaboration in dutch computer science ( cs ) .",
    "four parameters are considered in this research : institutional affiliation , scientific age , cosmopolitanism of knowledge production , and visibility of the scientists .",
    "we prove that mean - field models expand the empirical testing ground of dynamic network models through increased scalability .",
    "this allows us to better understand dynamics of large social networks , covering space that has not been investigated in the past using a mean - field approach .",
    "the paper is set up as follows . in section  [ sec : models ] we review the state of social network models , specifically highlighting the limitations of present models . in section  [ sec : model ]",
    "we explain the mean - field model , discussing in detail the computational advantages of the model as well as the steps taken to implement a data - aware approach for improved specifications . in section  [ sec : application ] , we test the model on the coauthorship networks of papers from the conference proceedings for dutch computer scientists , collected from the dblp data set for 2006  2010 . finally , we conclude with the results and implications for scalable , data - aware modeling solutions for explaining dynamics of social networks .",
    "the evolution of a network is driven by the addition , maintenance , and dissolution of interactions ( edges ) between nodes over time .",
    "evolving graph models are the most commonly implemented models to explain the dynamics of networks  @xcite .",
    "these models assume that nodes are added one - by - one to the network , in discrete time .",
    "they infer the probability of a link emerging given a node - transition rate using a markovian model of simulation . within this model type",
    "two distinct approaches exist investigating social network dynamics : 1 ) global network - structure link - prediction models , and 2 ) social - parameter models integrating social factors into link prediction .",
    "models with pure network - structure prediction assumptions derive from the vast research on global network structures .",
    "studies on network properties confirm that many real - world networks display small - world properties in which high node clustering is combined with short average internode distances  @xcite .",
    "networks have also been found to behave according to a power - law scale - free phenomenon where a relatively small number of nodes have numerous connections  @xcite .",
    "additionally , networks have properties of clustering hierarchies  @xcite , and tendencies of transitivity or `` triangles of interaction '' describing the manner in which ties between node @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and between node @xmath2 and @xmath3 facilitate a likely tie between @xmath1 and @xmath3 .    from this knowledge on network properties",
    "a second generation of studies emerged addressing how a social network can be modeled using properties intrinsic to the network .",
    "these global network - structure link - prediction models provide insight into not yet identified or observed linkages @xcite , as well as to infer not directly observed likely links @xcite . within these studies two approaches are taken to predict links : ( 1 ) computing node - level measures from greater network structures and , ( 2 ) meta - level analyses . in this study",
    "we consider only node - level measures ( which are comparable to the gap we aim to fill in this research ) , while still maintaining the network structure .",
    "several approaches for predicting social network linkages have been proposed , for a complete list see @xcite . despite the extensive research of different measures used to model the network dynamics ,",
    "all of these models suffer from low fitness , with random link prediction performing just as well as katz s model of path collection-",
    "predicting links by the sum of collected path lengths per individual @xcite . this has led informaticians to explore the effects of additional parameters in understanding network dynamics .",
    "a second model type works to address the effect(s ) of social parameters on the dynamics of social networks .",
    "the justification for these models arose from research on social networks which proved that social selection plays a key role in relation formation  @xcite .",
    "models of this type allow us to question how a social network can be modeled using both network and social properties of nodes .",
    "these models also infer edges through evolving graph models but consider state spaces with both network and social parameters .",
    "two model types are commonly used to investigate the inference of these dual parameters : stochastic actor models ( siena )  @xcite and exponential random graph models ( ergm )  @xcite .    the key distinction in these models , from the network - only models , is the combination of link prediction based on both local effects , as well as on `` social circuits '' that capture the influence of more distant ties on behavior @xcite .",
    "this leads to an exponential growth of the state space due to the consideration of more parameters , requiring extensive computing power in prediction .",
    "given the computational complexity of calculating this for every node these models are not easy to develop in a way that convergence emerges in large networks @xcite .",
    "consequently , these classes often limit the size of networks through a theoretical boundary of inferring statistics for a bounded network .",
    "this reduces the burden of having to perform computations on potentially very large graphs , but also effectively limits application to small networks ( @xmath0 1000 nodes ) .    in summary",
    ", these two model classes provide a testing ground to explore dynamics , but are both not without limitations .",
    "both network and social parameters have scalability problems .",
    "as we discuss next , in order to empirically explore the effect of both network and social parameters on large social network dynamics a scalable solution is required .",
    "we propose a _ mean - field approach _ for studying social networks ; ( equally behaving ) individual nodes are grouped according to their _",
    "states_. this approach is used for an optimized analysis of large - scale systems , allowing for a prediction of the average behavior of the system .",
    "the mean - field theory has been applied previously , e.g. , to large - scale gossip systems in  @xcite .",
    "concisely , the state of the system is represented by a distribution , or a vector of fractions of nodes @xmath4 in each state @xmath5 at time unit @xmath6 .",
    "the evolution of the stochastic system is governed by a so - called master equation of the form : @xmath7@xmath8 is the matrix , each entry of which is a transition probability from a state @xmath5 at time @xmath6 to state @xmath9 at time @xmath10 .",
    "thus , we are effectively reducing the global state space , thereby increasing the computational efficiency of the model , and in turn , allowing us to consider more parameters as well as more nodes .",
    "moreover , we use the notion of _ classes _ , introduced in  @xcite , to distinguish between equally behaving nodes affiliated to different categories . to this end",
    ", the mean - field model predicts average behavior of sets of nodes of each class given a number of social and network parameters .",
    "we highlight the modelling steps :    [ [ forming - a - model ] ] forming a model + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    in order to model the network , first we need to define the system in the form of its parameters .",
    "this will form a state of the system . given the type of network under study ,",
    "the effects of system parameters are considered using either manual classification or statistical classification ( e.g. , @xcite ) to identify the set of significant parameters to form states and classes .",
    "for example , some parameter @xmath11 can be a theoretically informed organizational constraint ( e.g. an organization , a background , etc ) .",
    "[ [ applying - abstraction - refinement ] ] applying abstraction refinement + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the theory underlying the mean - field model requires also the population of each state to be large enough to be approximated by the law of large numbers .",
    "the size of the population in a sampled data set may force one to consider further abstraction for the ranges of the parameters , thereby reducing the size of the system state space .",
    "for instance , if chosen parameters for the system are the number of papers per author @xmath12 and the number of an author s coauthors @xmath13 , the number of possible states of the system will simply be a product @xmath14 .",
    "some parameters can be restricted in their value ranges without loss of the accuracy of the model itself .",

    "the input distributions for the mean - field model include three categories : ( 1 ) communication , ( 2 ) idle , and ( 3 ) collision .",
    "communication describes the interaction between nodes , and idle is a state of no interaction .",
    "collision is the disappearance or decay of an interaction .",
    "the distributions of interaction ( links , from a graph - theoretical perspective ) are estimated for each class , which determines the nonuniform behavior by different classes for the model .",

    "we repeat the earlier steps until all parameters are included for a time period covered by the data set .",
    "we use the resulting mean - field model to make average link predictions on the system given the parameters under consideration .",
    "the model provides a number of advantages over models discussed in section  [ sec : models ] , such as greater flexibility in modeling behavior of nodes through a number of processes .",
    "the use of hmms provides an additional round of probability in node interactions , to compensate for the aggregation .",
    "moreover , such a model allows us to consider both social parameters as well as network structures . unlike simulation or deployed models , the model is flexible given a theoretical knowledge of the interactions under study . in analyzing the system under question we set the formal specifications which provide detailed processes of specification .",

    "a data - aware approach implies that both classes and parameters are informed through an intense , robust knowledge of the system under study , as well as the content of edges in the network data .",
    "it is a requirement that this is approachable through a theoretically or empirically grounded conceptual scheme on both the system under study and the mechanisms that inform the parameters considered in simulation models .",
    "consequently , not all social networks and or systems can be analyzed using such an approach .    additionally , we argue for an interdisciplinary approach in development of the model as data needs to be intensely explored to inform parameters by both a data engineer and validated by social scientists or informed experts of the system under study .",
    "this implies , unlike other models , that the data - aware approach is essential to determining accurate results , which can be compared in model - fit tests .",
    "this results in a model that specifically fits the needs of the system under study , and which can be adapted per population given the basic set of rules for abstraction we describe . in the next section we lay out the general steps for the application of a mean - field model .",
    "as discussed in the previous section a set of requirements are necessary for implementing a mean - field model to investigate the effect of social and network factors on network dynamics : network data , parameter data , and knowledge from empirical studies of the system under study .",
    "we explain the case studied here and detail the abstraction steps undertaken to model the effect of network and social parameters on network dynamics .",
    "a majority of computational analyses of large social networks implement coauthor or similar co - occurrence networks to examine network dynamics @xcite .",
    "coauthorship networks , via publication data , provide a representation of a specific social interaction- successful collaboration , in producing an output- dissemination of knowledge through publication .",
    "moreover , publication data is readily accessible on the web providing large , reliable , and scalable data sets to model network dynamics .",
    "in addition to the use of coauthorship data to study network dynamics , empirical studies on coauthorship provide a framework to develop measures to consider in the model testing . in science studies ,",
    "coauthorship is a standard measure for collaboration in science .",
    "collaboration is increasingly common in science ; from the near disappearance of single - authored papers to the growth in prevalence of an increasing numbers of coauthors on academic publications @xcite .",
    "a decade of studies on collaboration in science have proved the effect of different social variables on collaborative behavior of scientists @xcite .",
    "recent studies have found that task types and a number of external factors influence collaborative behavior of scientific processes @xcite . both institutional and short geographical distances play a key role in the collaborative behavior of scientists @xcite .",
    "given these studies we have a basis at which to both test informed parameters and link findings to knowledge on collaborative tendencies of scientists .    in this paper",

    "dutch computer scientists , to investigate dynamics as to limit known exogenous effects of different knowledge production practices between disciplines and nations . effectively , we comment only on the average behavior of the system of dutch cs .",
    "the field of cs was chosen for three reasons : the traditions of the field with a diversity of subfields within the discipline ; the known tendency for collaboration through coauthorship ; the validity and reliability of online sources documenting publications .",
    "the dutch context provides a diversity of cases at which to examine different institutional processes .",
    "a source list of 434 tenured dutch computer scientists in 2010 was acquired from the nederlands onderzoekdatabank , an official body that keeps records on research in the netherlands . to identify a valid and reliable set of coauthorship data for the dutch computer scientists a snapshot of dblp database",

    "the use of web data as the source of meta data is integral in this first model development as it reduces the burden of data collection of social variables ( compared to traditional social science data of surveys or interviews ) .",
    "this allows us to quickly test the effect of social parameters on behavior with a considerable amount of reliability from merging meta - data from additional online databases .",
    "the parameters  scientific age , cosmopolitanism of knowledge production , and visibility are calculated from within the dblp data set .",
    "scientific age was selected because tenure and rank are both said to play a role in collaborative behavior of scientists , with scientists of a higher tenure more likely to collaborate than mid - range , tenure - seeking colleagues @xcite .",
    "we first noted publication per author in the dblp data set for which we compute per year per author as his or her scientific age . a second parameter , cosmopolitanism , relates to the socio - technical acquired capabilities of scientists suggesting that access to potential coauthors in a field plays a key role in collaboration  @xcite .",

    "we test the following social science hypothesis : institutions effect the patterns of collaborative behavior ( by behavior we mean average number of coauthors , and average number of papers ) .",
    "in addition to these social parameters we also include the network parameter of transitivity .",
    "as discussed in section 1 , social networks have tendencies of transitivity @xcite .",
    "we consider the social parameters in predicting the triadic interactions between nodes .      in principle , any of our parameters could be considered a class .",

    "we investigate the four possible parameters under consideration in this model .",
    "we first consider known effects .",
    "our system is already bounded by the selection of one national science structure and one scientific discipline .",
    "the effect of the institution provides a valid and logical boundary at which to explore aggregation .",
    "additionally , we know that geographical location also plays a key role in collaboration , which we aim to consider in the abstraction . consequently , we employ institutions as classes in our mean - field model , and as one of the parameters @xmath11 contributing to a state @xmath20 of a collaboration network . due to limitation of the data - mining techniques to automatically extract full history of scientific employment , we assume that a scientist has one affiliation during the four year period .    the data set for our model consist of 3639 dutch authors with 749 different institutions .",
    "however , the theory underlying our mean - field model requires that the population of each class should be large enough to be approximated by the law of large numbers . to this end",
    ", we applied an abstraction on classes ( institutions ) based on statistical metrics for the given distribution @xmath21 of computer scientists among institutions .",
    "since both our data set and results are focused on the system of dutch computer scientists , we distinguish ( 1 ) institutions in the netherlands , and ( 2 ) institutions in other countries .",
    "for each of these categories we estimate a statistical threshold of the significance of the institution .",
    "this threshold depends on the dispersion of the distribution @xmath22 of scientists sampled for each of the categories of institutions .",
    "if values are highly dispersed , then we set the threshold to be the average number of affiliated scientists .    to measure the statistical dispersion for the scientists distribution @xmath23 , we compute _ a sample covariance _ , which is the average distance to the mean value between any two values in the distribution @xmath23 . to allow for some dispersion",
    ", we compare the arithmetic mean for @xmath23 and its sample covariance : if the sample covariance for a subset @xmath24 is higher than the mean , then the values of the sampled @xmath22 are highly dispersed .",
    "in addition to estimation of the significance threshold , this simple test is applied in two steps : ( 1 ) for the continental abstraction , and ( 2 ) the country - wide abstraction . in case 1 , we sample data for all universities per continent ( using the un list of countries per continent and gps coordinates ) . in the case of high dispersion in the number of scientists in institutions in one continent , we proceed to test the dispersion of the number of scientists affiliated with institutions in one country .",
    "we merge only those institutions that have a number of scientists below the mean of the entire distribution @xmath21 .",
    "the histogram in fig .",
    "[ fig : histo ] shows the number of scientists in each class , before and after the classes abstraction .",

    "considering our sampled data set with only 3639 scientists , the distribution of the population in such a state space is very sparse .",
    "thus , we identify five main groups of scientific age , categorizing age into ten - year periods as to generalize about generations of scientists : @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 . in general , scientific careers require substantial investments to establish tenure .",

    "a high number of coauthors on a paper generally indicates a participation in a large research project .",
    "this results in an unnecessary large state - space size of the model , given the sampled authors in this sample .",
    "to tackle this , we distinguish five categories of coauthor count per paper : `` non cooperative '' ( @xmath31 ) for the papers with one author , `` regular '' ( @xmath32 ) for the papers with up to @xmath33 coauthors , `` high '' ( @xmath34 ) with up to @xmath35 coauthors on the paper , `` team '' ( @xmath33 ) with up to @xmath36 coauthors , and a `` large project '' ( @xmath37 ) for papers with more than @xmath36 coauthors .",
