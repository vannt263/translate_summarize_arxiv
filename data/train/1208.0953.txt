    "there are four basic theoretical scenarios for the formation of the progenitors of type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) .",
    "the goal of these scenarios is to form a carbon - oxygen ( co ) white dwarf ( wd ) with a mass close to and above the chandrasekhar mass limit @xmath0 .",
    "such wds will go through a thermonuclear detonation @xcite that is observed as an sn ia .",
    "( @xmath1 ) in the single degenerate ( sd ) scenario ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) a wd grows in mass through accretion from a non - degenerate stellar companion .",
    "however , it seems that the wd - mass increase is very limited , e.g. , @xcite for a recent paper and references therein .",
    "ruiter et al .",
    "( 2011 ) consider the helium - rich donor scenario ( hers ) to be in a category separate from the canonical sd scenario . in the hers a he - rich star , degenerate or",
    "not degenerate , transfers mass to a co white dwarf which explodes as it approaches the chandrasekhar mass ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "like the sd scenario , the delay time is strongly dependent on evolutionary timescales of the stars .",
    "( @xmath2 ) in the double degenerate ( dd ) scenario ( @xcite ; see @xcite for a paper on sub - chandrasekhar mass remnants ) two wds merge after losing energy and angular momentum through the radiation of gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "( @xmath3 ) in the core - degenerate ( cd ) scenario for the formation of sn ia the chandrasekhar or super - chandrasekhar mass wd is formed at the termination of the common envelope ( ce ) phase or during the planetary nebula phase , from a merger of a wd companion with the hot core of a massive asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) star @xcite .",
    "observations and theoretical studies can not teach us yet whether all scenario , or only one or two of these can work ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "( @xmath4 ) it is likely that a sub - chandrasekhar mass wd can explode as a sn ia via the ` double - detonation ' mechanism @xcite . in this model ,",
    "a sub - chandrasekhar mass wd accumulates a layer of helium - rich material on the surface , which under the right conditions can detonate , leading to a detonation near the center of the co wd @xcite .",
    "ruiter et al .",
    "( 2011 ) performed a population synthesis study of the double - detonation scenario considering helium - rich donors , and found a bimodal delay time distribution , the shape depending on whether non - degenerate donors ( @xmath5 ) or degenerate donors ( @xmath6 ) dominate . regarding both the dd and the double - detonation scenarios",
    ", we note that sub - chandrasekhar sn ia explosions are supported also by the population of wd binaries in the solar neighborhood @xcite .",
    "in this paper we focus on the cd scenario , and to some extend we refer to the dd scenario .",
    "the merger of a wd with the core of an agb star was studied in the past ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite suggested that the merger of the wd with the agb core leads to a sn ia that occurs at the end of the ce phase or shortly after , and can explain the presence of hydrogen lines .",
    "this idea was further studied recently by @xcite . in the cd scenario",
    "the possibility of a very long time delay ( up to @xmath7  yr ) is considered as well @xcite . however",
    ", if that delay mechanism does not work , then the cd scenario can explain sn ia only in star forming galaxies .",
    "@xcite and @xcite find in their population synthesis calculations that many systems end in a core - wd merger process , but they did not consider these to be sn ia . because of its rapid rotation ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and possibly very strong central magnetic fields ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the super - chandrasekhar wd does not explode .",
    "there are two key ingredients in the cd scenario , in addition to the common condition that the remnant mass be @xmath8 .",
    "( 1 ) the merger should occur while the core is still large , hence hot .",
    "this limits the merger to occur within @xmath9 after the common envelope phase .",
    "@xcite showed that this condition can be met when the agb star is massive , and some of the ejected ce gas might fall back ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "( 2 ) the delay between merger and explosion should be up to @xmath10 if this scenario is to account for sne ia in old - stellar populations , in addition to sne ia in young stellar populations .",
    "wds with delay times have masses in the range @xmath11 , and indeed can have a long delay ( jorge rueda , 2012 , private communication ) . in previous papers",
    "another ingredient was used .",
    "it asserted that the hot core is more massive than the companion cold wd .",
    "this is true in most cases , but not in all . in some rare cases",
    "this not need be the case @xcite , and there is a short delay to explosion .",
    "these ingredients involve physical processes much different from those in the dd scenario , and hence make the cd a distinguished scenario , rather than a branch of the dd scenario .",
    "the merger of the core while it is still hot might prevent an early ignition of carbon @xcite , which is one of the theoretical problems of the dd scenario ( e.g. , @xcite ) . as for the delay time",
    ", in the cd scenario it is due to the spinning - down time of the wd set by magneto - dipole radiation @xcite , while in the dd scenario the delay is due to the spiraling - in time due to gravitational radiation .",
    "stabilizing rapidly rotating super - chandrasekhar wds is a delicate matter ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite in the sd degenerate scenario ) .",
    "the strong magnetic fields required in the present model most likely will enforce a rigid rotation within a short time scale due the wd being a perfect conductor .",
    "the critical mass of rigidly rotating wds is @xmath12 ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this implies that wds more massive than @xmath12 will explode in a relatively short time .",
    "the similarity of most sn ia suggests that their progenitors indeed come from a narrow mass range .",
    "this is @xmath13 in the cd scenario .",
    "this property of the magneto - dipole radiation torque spinning - down mechanism , that only wds with @xmath14 can slow down on a very long time scale ( e.g. , jorge rueda , 2012 , private communication ) , explains the finding that sne ia in older populations are less luminous ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and that very massive sn ia progenitors occur in galaxies where star formation is expected , i.e. , spirals and irregulars @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we estimate the number of sne ia from the cd scenario . because of several large uncertainties",
    ", we perform a crude estimate of the sn ia progenitor formation rate . in section [ sec : coincident ] we point to an interesting coincident of the chandrasekhar mass with another mass in the cd and dd scenarios . the assumptions and",
    "set up of the population synthesis are given in section [ sec : assumptions ] .",
    "the results on the formation rate are given section [ sec : results ] , together with a comparison with observations , including with core - collapse supernovae ( ccsne ) rate .",
    "our summary is in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the electron degeneracy pressure operating in two different stellar phases leads to an interesting coincidence in the frame of the scenario discussed here .",
    "relativistic electron degeneracy pressure sets the chandrasekhar mass limit of @xmath16 .",
    "non - relativistic electron degeneracy pressure operates in the core of low mass red giant branch ( rgb ) stars .",
    "these stars reach a relatively large radius on the rgb .",
    "the combined mass of the two wd remnants of a binary system where both stars develop a degenerate core on the rgb is limited by @xmath17 . when evolutionary considerations are added ( see below )",
    "this mass is very close to @xmath0 .",
    "stars that have a main sequence ( ms ) mass of @xmath18 develop a degenerate core and reach a relatively large radius on the rgb , not much smaller than the maximum radius they achieve on the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) .",
    "stars with @xmath19 , on the other hand , reach a much larger radius on the agb relative to the radius they achieve on the rgb . the following approximation ( up to @xmath20 )",
    "can be fitted to the results of @xcite(their fig .",
    "31 ) for the ratio of the maximum radius on the agb to that on the rgb as function of the ms mass @xmath21 and @xmath22 the results of @xcite together with the fitting formula are plotted in figure [ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "this implies that for stars with @xmath23 in binary systems there is a large range of orbital separations where strong binary interaction occurs during the agb phase but not during the rgb phase of the star .",
    "this condition is required to form a co wd merger remnant .     on the red giant branch ( rgb ) and the one @xmath24 on asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) attained by starts as function of their main sequence ( ms ) mass , as calculated by @xcite .",
    "we added two thick dashed - dotted lines that are the quantity @xmath25 as given by our approximate equations ( [ eq : rarr1 ] ) and ( [ eq : rarr2 ] ) for the two mass ranges , respectively . ]",
    "it so happens that a star of ms mass of @xmath26 that evolves without any disturbances forms a wd of mass @xmath27 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this leads to the following argument .",
    "consider binary systems where for both stars there is a large range of the binary orbital separation for a strong binary interaction to occur on the agb , but not on the rgb .",
    "namely , both stars have @xmath28 when they leave the ms .",
    "the secondary can start the ms with @xmath29 , but then accretes mass from the primary star to the point where its mass is @xmath30 .",
    "we use the condition that after mass transfer the secondary mass is @xmath31 .",
    "we also use the condition @xmath32 on the initial mass of the secondary star .",
    "this ensures that in most cases the binary system does not reach the darwin instability during the agb phase of the primary star , and so there is no ce phase at this stage .",
    "namely , we consider systems where the secondary ( initially less massive star ) is massive enough to bring the primary envelope to synchronization with the orbital motion , and a ce phase before the secondary has developed a co core is prevented .",
    "the primary forms a wd of mass @xmath33 .    later in the evolution the secondary evolves and interaction takes place only at late agb phases .",
    "the wd remnant of the primary star can not bring the secondary envelope to synchronization , and the binary system enters a ce phase .",
    "however , as this occurs late on the agb when the core is a co core and is massive enough , @xmath34 . despite the large uncertainties in the binary interaction , systems where the combined remnants mass is @xmath35 are very likely to be descendant of two stars that each left the main sequence with a mass of @xmath36 .",
    "on the other hand , wd binary systems with @xmath37 are likely to be descendant of systems where at least one of the two stars had a mass of @xmath38 and a strong tidal interaction took place on the rgb .",
    "this would further prevent the wd from achieving a high mass .",
    "the wds remnants , or a wd and the core of the secondary , of two stars in a binary system that are likely to have strong interaction on the agb but not on the rgb , is about equal to the chandrasekhar mass limit .",
    "the condition is that both stars have @xmath28 when they leave the ms , and the orbital separation be in the right range . the orbital separation range for forming a sn ia progenitor is not simple to estimate , as it requires knowledge of the tidal interaction . in any case , in the next section we will use the logarithmic range @xmath39 in estimating the number of systems that potentially can lead to sne ia .",
    "when a low mass secondary star , i.e. , @xmath40 , evolves , it has a lower envelope mass . a wd companion ( the remnant of the primary ) is more likely to survive the ce phase .",
    "the remnant is a close wd binary system with a total mass of @xmath41 .",
    "those wd binaries with @xmath42 are likely to come from systems where the secondary had @xmath28 , and the ce is more likely to end with a merger @xcite .",
    "this is because the outcome of a ce phase is sensitive to the envelope mass . a small increase in the envelope mass above the combined masses of the core and wd companion can lead to a merger event at the termination of the ce phase @xcite .",
    "to have a core mass of @xmath43 the secondary ms mass should be @xmath44 .",
    "the envelope mass is then @xmath45 which is 3 times and more the companion wd mass .",
    "this general discussion might explain the finding of @xcite that the super - chandrasekhar merger rate of wd binary systems in the solar neighborhood , @xmath46 , is only @xmath47 of the sn ia rate found by @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggest that the explanation is that sub - chandrasekhar mergers lead to sne ia . to account for the observed rate they require sne ia to occur in merger of wd with a total mass of as low as @xmath48 .",
    "@xcite find in their population synthesis that theoretically there are potentially enough sub - chandrasekhar progenitors to account for the rates of sne ia .",
    "instead , we suggest that many single compact - magnetic super - chandrasekhar wds explode as sne ia .",
    "they are the remnants of core - wd merger at the termination of the ce phase .",
    "the recent population synthesis of @xcite show that many more mergers occur during the agb phase than of two wds ( about a factor of 8) .",
    "in this section we list the assumptions and set up of the population synthesis calculations . because of",
    "the large uncertainties in the ce evolution and the controversial @xmath49-ce prescription @xcite , we limit our goal to show that the number of sn ia can be explained with the cd and dd scenario . previous population synthesis of the the dd scenario ( e.g. , @xcite ) are summarized by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the more recent population synthesis study conducted by @xcite shows that the expected total number sn ia progenitors in the dd scenario is a factor of @xmath50 times lower than observed .",
    "even if the fraction of binary is taken to be @xmath51 instead of @xmath52 , the contribution of the dd scenario is @xmath53 .",
    "this is compatible with the observational finding of @xcite . with the ce prescription used in the context of the dd scenario , and for @xmath52 of systems in binaries ,",
    "the results span the range of @xmath54  sn ia per @xmath55 star formation , which is below half the observed value .",
    "as we will show below , the cd scenario does much better and can account for the observed value .",
    "there are three basic differences between our calculations and those summarized by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "( @xmath1 ) we consider the merger of the wd companion with the core , in particular in cases where the wd mass is less than the core mass , to be of very high probability @xcite .",
    "( @xmath2 ) we use a simple prescription for the relevant binary orbital separation that might allow stronger interaction on the agb ( see more in section [ sec : summary ] ) .",
    "( @xmath3 ) our usage of a high efficiency mass transfer ( @xmath56 below ) is more than what other population synthesis codes use / find .",
    "this effect might be the largest of the three effects listed here . in that",
    "regards we note that our results disagree with those of @xcite regarding the cd scenario , both quantitatively and qualitatively .",
    "it is possible that most of the differences result from our usage of this efficient mass transfer process .",
    "the ingredients of the population synthesis code are as follows .",

    "( see section [ sec : coincident ] ) .",

    "we assumed that most ce processes where the mass of the white dwarf remnant of the primary ( initially more massive ) star is less that the mass of the core , @xmath121 , end in mergers .",
    "these systems have a large envelope to wd mass ratio , @xmath122 , as can be seen in the upper panel of figure [ fig : figxi1 ] .",
    "such systems have a high probability for wd - core merger @xcite .",
    "this approach avoids using the highly uncertain and controversial @xmath49-ce parameter in estimating the final orbital separation .",
    "we required that the binary interaction is strong during the late agb phase of the secondary star , but not during its rgb phase .",
    "we then used the ratio of maximum radii on these two phases , as presented in figure [ fig : fig1 ] , to find the probability for each binary system to be in the relevant orbital separation range .",

    "one is the mass transfer parameter from the primary to the secondary , @xmath73 , as given by equation [ eq : eta1 ] , and the other is the binary fraction @xmath108 .",

    "these numbers should be taken very cautiously at this preliminary stage .",
    "as can be seen from table [ tab : table1 ] , our very simple approach matches rate of sn ia deduced from observations . in section [ subsec : number ] we also list processes we have neglected , some that will increase and other that will decrease the numbers found here .",
    "overall , despite the large uncertainties and crude estimate , we find it very satisfactory that the simplest population synthesis we could think of yields sn ia average rate in the cd scenario very close to observations .",

    "some systems in their calculations end at a too large orbital separation to become a sn ia .",
    "the second one has to do with the treatment of the tidal interaction and mass transfer during the rgb and agb phases .",
    "the tidal interaction and the formation of a ce phase when the secondary reach the upper agb might be more significant than what is usually assumed in population synthesis studies .",
    "this is because of the unstable nature of massive agb stars , as all secondaries are in our calculations .",
    "such instabilities are likely to increase the number of wd that enter the ce phase with the secondary .",
    "we call for people who follow the rgb and agb phases in the simulations to reconsider the tidal interaction when the agb reaches the upper agb , and alow for stronger interaction due to instabilities",
    ". such instabilities might increase the orbital separation from where the wd remnant of the primary star enters the ce phase .",
    "we intend to study the effects of agb instabilities in a future paper .",
    "future studies of the cd scenario will have to explore the exact nature and outcome of the merger process of a hot core with a cooler wd with a similar mass @xmath126 , as this is a major open question in the cd scenario .",

    "if the cd scenario does indeed account for a substantial fraction of sn ia , then rapidly rotating super - chandrasekhar wds should be found .",
    "claims for massive rapidly rotating and strongly magnetized wds have already been made , e.g. see discussion by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "out of the 16 magnetic wds with well determined mass reported by @xcite , two have masses close to the chandrasekhar limit , @xmath127 .",
    "recent studies also show that magnetic wds on average are more massive than non - magnetic wds ( e.g. , @xcite ) , in particular for @xmath128 @xcite .",
