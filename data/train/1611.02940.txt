    "the very sharp leftmost peak in the figure located at about channel  80 is the pedestal or zero - energy bin in the qdc . just to the right of the pedestal",
    "is the edge corresponding to our hardware threshold located at about channel  140 .",

    "separation of fission fragments and @xmath2 particles is not completely clean , as seen in the grey shaded area of fig .",
    "[ figure : cell_histogram ] between channels  230 and 540 .",
    "this could result from non - uniform scintillation - light collection , different energy losses of different particle types in the source as well as the thin au source window , non - linearity of the scintillation , or even fission fragments striking the source holder .",
    "this will be examined in more detail in a future publication .",
    "recall that the average @xmath2-particle energy is @xmath66.1  mev , while the average heavy fission - fragment energy is 80  mev and the average light fission - fragment energy is 104  mev .",
    "if we calibrate our qdc based upon the average energy deposition of the two types of fission fragments and then apply this calibration to the @xmath2-particle distribution , we reconstruct the @xmath2 peak at @xmath612  mev .",
    "@xmath1he is often assumed to be a linear scintillator , while this preliminary analysis suggests an apparent non - linearity .",
    "however , as outlined above , there are several factors which will affect the apparent scintillation - pulse height . the degree of non - linearity in the scintillation ( if any ) requires an in - depth study .",
    "note that for the data presented subsquently in this paper , a software fission - fragment cut located at channel  520 was employed .",
    "figure  [ figure : tof ] shows a fission - neutron tof spectrum obtained using the signal in the @xmath18he scintillator detector to start a tdc and a signal from the ne-213 detector to stop it .",
    "note that the spectrum shown corresponds to events lying above the software fission - fragment cut at channel  520 shown in fig .",
    "[ figure : cell_histogram ] .",
    "after this cut , interpretation of the resulting tof spectrum is straightforward .",
    "the sharp peak to the left of the spectrum centered at about 5  ns and labeled  gamma - flash \" corresponds to the detection of a fission fragment in the @xmath18he scintillator detector and a correlated fission - event gamma - ray in the ne-213 detector .",
    "the @xmath61.8  ns fwhm of the gamma - flash distribution is consistent with the observed timing jitter on our pmt signals and the slight tail in the distribution is possibly due to time walk in the electronics .",
    "note that @xmath18he scintillator is highly insensitive to gamma - rays  @xcite and any electrons produced via compton scattering or pair production will result in only a very small scintillation signal .",
    "these events will be entirely suppressed by the relatively high software cut we have applied on the signals from the @xmath18he scintillator detector .",
    "thus , the present apparatus is almost completely insensitive to fission - associated multiple gamma - ray events .",
    "the broad bump centered at about 55  ns corresponds to the fission - neutron distribution .",
    "the underlying background distribution corresponds to random coincidences .",
    "it was measured to be flat as expected by breaking the line - of - sight between the @xmath18he scintillator detector and the ne-213 detector using a stack of lead ( @xmath615  cm ) and polyethylene ( @xmath610  cm ) .",
    "figure  [ figure : ekin ] shows the fission - neutron tof spectrum from fig .",
    "[ figure : tof ] converted to a neutron kinetic - energy spectrum .",
    "to convert from tof to neutron kinetic energy , we used the 5  ns position of the gamma - flash shown in fig .",
    "[ figure : tof ] and the 106  cm distance between the @xmath0cf source and the center of the ne-213 liquid - scintillator cell .",
    "the data were then rebinned linearly in kinetic energy .",
    "also shown are three representations of the neutron - kinetic energy distribution constructed using the information presented by thomas in ref .",
    "we note that there are small differences between the representations , so a normalization factor has been applied to each so that they coincide with our data at 1.5  mev .",
    "it should be emphasized that the present data have not been corrected for neutron - detection efficiency and that , with the present hardware neutron - detector threshold , neutron energies below 1  mev can not be corrected for reliably . at 1  mev ,",
    "the agreement between all three representations is essentially exact .",
    "between 1  mev and 4  mev , the maxwellian approximation and the iso  8529 - 1 representation both lie below the endf / b - vii suggestion by 2% and 1% , respectively . by 5  mev ,",
    "the agreement between all three is again essentially exact . above 6  mev ,",
    "a divergence between the representations begins and by 8  mev , both the maxwellian and the iso  8529 - 1 representations lie above the endf / b - vii suggestion by about 9% and 4% , respectively .",
    "the @xmath191% level of agreement between all three representations of the @xmath0cf fission - neutron energy spectrum over the energy region from 1 to 6  mev is well within any systematic uncertainty that we are likely to obtain in measurements of neutron - detection efficiency using the tagging technique presented here .",
    "thus , they provide an excellent benchmark from which it will be possible to evaluate the neutron - detection efficiency .",
    "as a first step towards the development of an apparatus for the measurement of neutron - detection efficiency at our source - based fast - neutron irradiation facility , we have employed coincidence and time - of - flight measurement techniques to  tag \" neutrons emitted by a @xmath0cf source .",
    "the spontaneous - fission fragments are detected in a gaseous @xmath1he scintillator detector .",
    "the neutrons are detected in a ne-213 liquid - scintillator detector .",
    "the resulting continuous polychromatic beam of tagged neutrons has a measured energy dependence that agrees qualitatively with expectations .",
    "this preliminary study strongly suggests that the method of neutron - energy tagging will work well and future investigations will concentrate on quantifying systematic effects in order to optimize the performance .",
