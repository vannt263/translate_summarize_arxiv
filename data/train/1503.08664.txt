    "two - particle irreducible ( 2pi ) effective actions and approximation schemes based on them are often touted as useful techniques when it is necessary to go beyond the standard perturbative field theory , with applications to thermal and non - equilibrium plasmas / fluids , strongly coupled quantum field theories and systems dominated by many - body collective effects .",
    "the technique was originally developed by lee and yang @xcite , luttinger and ward @xcite , baym @xcite and others in the context of many - body theory , then extended by cornwall , jackiw and tomboulis @xcite to relativistic field theory where it found its natural formulation in terms of functional integrals . since",
    "then a broad literature has developed surrounding 2pi effective actions and their generalizations ( see @xcite for a good introductory review ) .",
    "approximations based on 2pi effective actions are often justified as a selective re - summation of perturbation theory ( some recent examples : @xcite ; interestingly though , this point of view is not found in the cornwall , jackiw and tomboulis paper @xcite ) , however they are not really a summation method in the same sense as , for example , borel summation . rather , this interpretation comes in a rather roundabout way .",
    "first , a set of self - consistent equations of motion is derived for the mean field @xmath1 and connected correlation function @xmath2 , starting directly from the non - perturbative definition of the theory through the path integral . only after formally solving the equations of motion by repeatedly iterating them",
    "does one obtain the usual perturbative expansion for these quantities or , if the equations of motion are truncated , a selective re - summation of perturbation theory appears .    in this work we attempt to clarify the connection between 2pi approximations , traditional perturbation theory and re - summation methods with a special emphasis on what analytic features of the 2pi formalism allow improved approximations to be obtained in the presence of a divergent feynman diagram series .",
    "unfortunately robust comparisons are difficult because the large order behaviour of perturbation theory is known , at best , in a sketchy form for most field theories of interest . to that end",
    "we restrict attention to a genuinely trivial model `` field theory '' in zero spacetime dimensions ( i.e. probability theory ) for which exact results are easily obtainable and all complications due to renormalization etc .",
    "this model nevertheless accurately represents the typical combinatoric structure of large order perturbation theory , at least in those cases where the behaviour is known in more interesting field theories .",
    "we also introduce a `` spectral function '' representation of the green function ( similar to the one first introduced by bender and wu @xcite ) to capture the non - analyticity of the solutions in the various methods .",
    "the existence of the spectral representation is connected to the branch cut of physical amplitudes on the negative coupling ( @xmath3 ) axis .",
    "this branch cut is due to the non - existence of the theory at negative couplings : the path integral diverges due to a potential unbounded from below . in a higher dimensional field theory",
    "this has a simple physical interpretation : the vacuum is unstable and , after tunneling through a barrier , the system rolls down the potential @xcite . for weak coupling",
    "the semi - classical approximation is valid and the tunneling is exponentially suppressed , giving an imaginary contribution @xmath4 to the vacuum persistence amplitude which is inherited by the green function .",
    "this exponential behaviour can be seen in the spectral function we obtain .",
    "dyson @xcite argued that a very similar phenomenon occurs in quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) .",
    "we briefly reiterate this argument . in qed physical observables",
    "are calculated in a perturbation series of the form @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the charge of the electron .",
    "now if one imagines a world where @xmath7 , i.e. like charges attract , it is easy to see that the ordinary vacuum is unstable to the production of many electron - positron pairs which separate into clouds of like - charged particles . at weak coupling",
    "there is a large tunneling barrier to overcome because one must pay for the rest mass of the pairs and separate them far enough for the wrong - sign coulomb potential to compensate .",
    "thus there is a finite but exponentially suppressed rate of vacuum decay .",
    "a taylor series expansion in @xmath8 can not capture this non - analyticity so the perturbation series must be divergent .",
    "similarly , the perturbation series in @xmath3 diverges for the toy model considered here .",
    "pad approximants are more effective because they can develop isolated poles in the complex @xmath3 plane , however they struggle to capture the strong coupling behaviour at any fixed order in the approximation .",
    "pad approximants are better able to capture the non - analyticities of the borel transform , however , and the widely used combination borel - pad approximants give a better global approximation .",
    "this occurs because the pad approximated bore transform has poles in the borel plane , which lead to branch cuts when the laplace transform is taken to return to physical variables .",
    "similarly , the self - consistent 2pi approximations develop branch point non - analyticities and approximate the exact green function rather well in the entire complex @xmath3 plane already at the leading non - trivial truncation . however , the branch cuts in the 2pi case arise because the 2pi green function obeys self - consistent equations of motion , and is connected to the existence of unphysical solution branches .",
    "a question that naturally arises is : how do these methods compare ?",
    "both 2pi and borel - pad methods have the ability to accurately represent non - analyticities of the exact theory and so out - perform other methods .",
    "however , we conjecture that self - consistently derived equations of motion `` know more '' about the analytic structure of the underlying theory than do the generic borel - pad approximants",
    ". hence we test the hypothesis that the 2pi methods should be more accurate that borel - pad and , indeed , find this to be the case , at least in certain regimes .",
    "the theory discussed here , although admittedly a toy model , also has physical relevance .",
    "independent from us , beneke and moch found this toy model as the theory governing the zero mode of scalar fields in euclidean de sitter space @xcite .",
    "they performed an analysis very similar to ours , finding that a non - perturbative treatment is necessary and comparing 2pi and ( borel-)pad resummed approximations .",
    "however , they present this analysis very briefly as part of a larger discussion of scalar fields in de sitter space .",
    "further , their comparison of the 2pi and resummed techniques , while correct as far as we can tell , is not very detailed . here",
    "we present detailed discussion of the interplay between 2pi effective actions and various resummation techniques .",
    "our use of the spectral function to quantify the non - analyticities present in the green function in aid of this comparison is , as far as we are aware , a new aspect .",
    "this paper has a somewhat pedagogical flavour , and readers familiar with field theory , borel summation and pad approximants can skim through sections [ sec : exact - solution - of ] and [ sec : perturbation - theory - and - resummations ] where these topics are discussed , pausing only to pick up our notation and our derivation of the spectral function for the exact theory ( section [ sec : exact - solution - of ] ) and the pad resummed theory ( section [ sub : pade - approximation ] ) . in section [ sec:2pi - approximations ] we compute the 2pi effective action , green function and corresponding spectral function for the theory . in section [ sec : hybrid-2pi - pade ] we introduce , for the first time to our knowledge , a hybrid 2pi - pad scheme and show that it accelerates convergence at weak coupling while having the correct behaviour at strong coupling , like 2pi approximations but not the usual pad method .",
    "finally in section [ sec : discussion ] we draw our conclusions .",
    "we consider a euclidean qft in zero dimensions , i.e. a probability theory for a single real variable @xmath9 given by the partition function @xmath10=n\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\mathrm{d}q\\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}m^{2}q^{2}-\\frac{1}{4!}\\lambda q^{4}-\\frac{1}{2}kq^{2}\\right)\\label{eq : partition - function}\\ ] ] in the presence of a source @xmath11 for the two point function .",

    "this theory has been discussed before in the context of exact and non - perturbative methods in field theory ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) because , despite the absence of spacetime , the theory possesses a perturbative expansion in terms of feynman diagrams with the same combinatorial structure as more realistic theories .",
    "it was also discussed in @xcite as an effective field theory for scalar field zero modes in euclidean de sitter space .",

    "physically , this signals the instability of the negative @xmath3 vacuum due to tunneling away from the local minimum at @xmath21 to @xmath22 followed by rolling down the inverted quartic potential which is unbounded from below .",
    "the branch point at @xmath23 means that the weak coupling perturbation series has zero radius of convergence .",

    "the terms of the series start to increase when @xmath79 , i.e. @xmath80 , meaning the series is useful for @xmath17 but fails immediately for a moderately strong coupling @xmath81 .",
    "this is typical asymptotic series behaviour as shown in figure [ fig : gpert - asymptotic - series ] .",

    "this is typical of perturbation series and usually signals some singularity of the exact solution for unphysical values of @xmath3 . in our case , indeed , the theory does not exist for @xmath19 and the exact solution possesses a branch cut on the negative @xmath3 axis , a feature which can not be reproduced in any order of perturbation theory .",
    "however , the perturbation series is asymptotic and does contain true information about the exact solution , even if @xmath3 is large enough that the series is not useful practically .",
    "because of the ubiquity of this phenomenon , mathematicians have invented a number of series summation techniques which assign a finite value to certain types of divergent series and which obey certain consistency properties ( e.g. the value assigned to a convergent series is just its nave sum ) .",
    "here we investigate borel summation , which is capable of summing factorially divergent series like .",
    "suppose that @xmath89 is a divergent series but that the _ borel transform _ of the series , defined as @xmath90 converges for sufficiently small @xmath91 .",

    "however , one may use pad approximants as discussed in the next section to recast the borel transform in a useful way .",

    "is connected to a non - perturbative finite action solution of the field equations , i.e. an instanton or soliton , and a correct evaluation of the path integral which sums over _ all _ saddle points ( not just perturbative ones ) removes the ambiguity .",
    "key to the practical application of borel summation is the location and classification of all renormalons in a given theory @xcite .",
    "sophisticated techniques have been developed to deal with this situation which are beyond the scope of this paper @xcite .",
    "borel summation on its own has limited usefulness in practice because one often only knows a few low order terms of perturbation theory , and the potential existence of renormalon singularities .",
    "there exists another technique which often improves perturbation series and is far more useful in practice ( and is often combined with borel summation ) .",
    "pad approximation approximates a function by rational polynomials which generally converge rapidly , are very useful for numerical computation and help to estimate the location of singularities of the function in the complex plane .",
    "many software packages include standard routines for evaluating pad approximants , for instance the padeapproximant function in mathematica . in this section",
    "we apply pad approximants directly to the green function and then to the borel transform .",

    "however , after the first few terms the coefficients seem to be well approximated by @xmath163 , the same as for the perturbation series .",

    "like perturbation theory , the 2pi series does not converge .",

    "however , unlike perturbation theory , the strong coupling limit @xmath52 exists and gives @xmath172 this series has the correct form in powers of @xmath173 , though the leading coefficient is incorrect by @xmath174 , and the sub - leading coefficients are incorrect by @xmath175 , @xmath176 and @xmath177 etc .",

    "the best approximation overall is the 2pi , though it has an unphysical cusp where the branch cut starts ( @xmath184 in figure [ fig : gbar - all - first - order - approxs ] ) .",
    "it appears the 2pi approximation trades sensitivity to the exponentially small portion of @xmath134 in exchange for a better global approximation .",
    "the pad approximation is good at small negative @xmath3 but hits a pole at @xmath185 and there loses all validity .",
    "the borel - pad approximation is smooth and more accurate than the 2pi near the peak of @xmath41 , but eventually becomes invalid , even negative , at sufficiently large negative @xmath3 ( @xmath186 ) .",

    "there are analytical expressions for the roots , though they are very bulky , and for @xmath189 must be solved numerically . picking out the correct root for a given value of @xmath3 is tricky in general and we leave this exercise to the reader .",
    "however , one can see on general grounds that truncations of give a singular perturbation theory in @xmath3 : at @xmath23 the physical solution starts at @xmath155 and the spurious solutions flow in from infinity as inverse powers of @xmath3 as @xmath3 increases to finite values . at strong coupling",
    "the roots generically approach each other and one must carefully track them through the complex plane .",
    "we suspect that a resummation of the 2pi series would remove some or all of these spurious solutions , though we do not have a proof of this .",
    "we examine two potential methods to achieve this in the next section and find mixed results .",
    "since the series of 2pi diagrams is asymptotic , we may consider using a series summation method to improve convergence .",
    "note that this is logically independent of the resummations embodied in the 2pi approximation itself .",
    "we may perform pad summation of the action term @xmath156 or the equation of motion term @xmath190 .",

    "this equation will have @xmath194 spurious solutions as does the ordinary 2pi approximation of matching order .    to take a specific example ,",
    "consider @xmath156 up to @xmath195 and the matching @xmath196- and @xmath197-pad approximants : @xmath198 the solution resulting from any of these versions of @xmath156 can not be written in closed form , however numerical solutions are shown in figure [ fig : hybrid - solution ] for moderately small @xmath3 ( for @xmath3 outside of this range , different roots become relevant ) .",
    "we see that the hybrid solutions are more accurate than the fourth order 2pi solution , although the level of improvement depends strongly on the type of pad approximant employed .",
    "the trade - off is a loss of accuracy at large @xmath3 , as shown in figure [ fig : hybrid - solution - large - lambda ] for the best roots we can find .",
    "each approximation decays with the correct leading @xmath173 power , however they differ by @xmath199 factors which are not negligible .",
    "remarkably , the best approximation of those shown is the @xmath200 2pi approximation . for the greater computational expense",
    "the @xmath196-hybrid approximation is not noticeably an improvement at large coupling .",
    "the apparent clustering of the @xmath195 2pi and @xmath197-hybrid approximations away from the exact value as @xmath52 probably stems from the minus sign of the leading term in @xmath190 in these approximations , suggesting that one should not use approximations with this property .",

    "now we try pad summing the equation of motion : @xmath201 where the explicit factor of @xmath202 on the right hand side simply ensures the self - energy is an odd function of @xmath142 as it must be .",
    "this equation of motion is of degree @xmath203 , which for typical choices of @xmath12 and @xmath204 results in a rough halving of the number of spurious solutions . to obtain an analytic result",
    "we consider the first non - trivial approximant , i.e. @xmath205 . the resulting equation of motion is @xmath206 which agrees with the usual 2pi equation of motion up to terms of order @xmath207 , however it only has two spurious solutions instead of three .",
    "the physical solution obtained by matching at small @xmath3 is @xmath208 where @xmath209    indeed , this matches perturbation theory up to @xmath207 terms .",
    "however , the large @xmath3 behaviour in this approximation is pathological : @xmath210 as @xmath52 .",
    "this reflects the existence of an unphysical branch cut on the positive @xmath3 axis starting at @xmath211 , which @xmath212 has in addition to the expected cuts on the negative axis .",
    "the existence of this cut also renders the derivation of the spectral function invalid , meaning that @xmath212 can not be written in the form .",
    "it is not clear at this stage whether other forms of pad summed equations of motion lack these pathologies .",
    "we leave further investigation of hybrid approximation schemes to future work .",
    "two - particle irreducible effective actions are the subject of a rich literature and have found applications in diverse areas from early universe cosmology to nano - electronics ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the virtues of approximation schemes built on 2pi effective actions are often explained in terms of a resummation of an infinite series of perturbative feynman diagrams which are encapsulated in the non - perturbative green function @xmath142 , from which the 2pi diagram series is built .",
    "however , the 2pi effective action is not a resummation scheme : it is a self - consistent variational principle .",
    "the definition of the 2pi effective action in terms of the legendre transform is crucial for the self - consistency of the scheme .",
    "the immediate practical consequence is that any modification of the 2pi effective action which does not derive from a consistent modified variational principle is very likely to be inconsistent .",
    "so for instance , the consistency of recent attempts to improve the symmetry properties of 2pi effective actions @xcite is guaranteed by the existence of a suitable constrained variational principle , however , ad hoc attempts to modify the equations of motion to satisfy symmetries will fail .    in this work",
    "we have pointed out the distinction between resummation and self - consistent approximations using an exactly solvable zero dimensional `` field '' theory .",
    "the perturbation theory has zero radius of convergence due to a branch cut on the negative coupling ( @xmath3 ) axis , a fact which is invisible to perturbation theory .",
    "the theory is borel summable , with the borel sum giving the exact answer .",
    "however , borel summation alone is not usually this helpful in practice .",
    "pad approximants well describe the green function at weak coupling , though not at strong coupling . however , the combination of borel and pad approximation yields an effective global approximation scheme for the green function .",
    "the two point green function of this theory admits a nice integral representation in terms of the spectral function ( i.e. discontinuity of the branch cut ) which allows us to see that the pad approximants improve perturbation theory by allowing the spectral function to be approximated as a sum of delta functions and the borel - pad method gives a continuous , albeit erratic and inaccurate , approximation to the spectral function .",
    "the 2pi approximation scheme surpasses perturbation theory , pad and borel - pad approximants already at the leading non - trivial truncation . like the borel - pad method",
    ", 2pi approximations can develop branch points and represent the spectral function by a continuous distribution .",
    "however , the 2pi approximation is quantitatively superior at the leading truncation .",
    "we speculate that this is because the borel - pad method is a widely applicable general `` black box '' method , however the self - consistent 2pi equations of motion are derived within a _ particular _ field theory of interest .",
    "this gives the 2pi method `` insider information , '' from which it should be able to construct a better approximation .",
    "this comes at the cost of spurious solutions which must be eliminated and the added difficulty of finding the 2pi effective action in the first place .",
    "finally we introduced ( for the first time , to our knowledge ) a hybrid 2pi - pad scheme , using pad approximants to partially resum the 2pi diagram series .",
    "the quality of the result depends strongly on the type of pad approximant used , with the best result in our case for the diagonal approximant .",
    "this hybrid approximation performs considerably better than the comparable 2pi approximation at weak coupling , though not noticeably better at strong coupling .    during proofing we became aware of a work by kleinert @xcite in some ways similar to our own .",
    "in @xcite , kleinert generalizes and reformulates the feynman - kleinert _ variational perturbation theory _ and compares it to the 2pi effective action ( called by the non - standard name `` bilocal legendre transform '' ) for the toy model discussed here .",
    "he finds that the variational perturbation theory out - performs the 2pi method and notes especially the failure of the 2pi series to converge uniformly for all couplings ( this is not a surprise in light of the fact that the 2pi series is asymptotic ) .",
    "our work differs in scope from his in two major ways .",
    "first , we compare the 2pi method to traditional resummation methods and not to other variational methods .",
    "second , kleinert focuses on the value of the effective action itself evaluated at its extremum , while we focus on the correlation function . in particular ,",
    "we have focused on the analytic structure of the correlation function in the complex coupling plane , and introduced the spectral representation to aid this discussion .",
    "a study of the behaviour of these quantities in variational perturbation theory is an intriguing prospect for future work .",
    "( an intermediate result of kleinert s work is directly applicable to our discussion around : equation 110 of @xcite gives a non - linear recurrence relation for the coefficients of the 2pi self - energy . )",
    "there are several other natural directions for extension of this work .",
    "one would be the calculation and comparison of higher orders in the 2pi and ( borel-)pad approximations , although it is doubtful what new insights might come from this .",
    "it would be straightforward to extend this work to consider 4pi effective actions , which depend on a self - consistent vertex function @xmath42 in addition to @xmath142 . in and performing the legendre",
    "transform with respect to both @xmath213 and @xmath11 .",
    "] however , the extension to higher order @xmath86pi effective actions requires the introduction of new terms in the exponent of which makes the problem no longer exactly solvable .",
    "a natural direction to pursue is borel - pad summation of the 2pi generating functional itself .",
    "this opens the possibility of eliminating spurious solutions to the 2pi equations of motion and enhancing the sensitivity of the 2pi method to the exponentially small regions of the spectral function , hence eliminating unphysical cusps .",
    "we are planning an investigation of these themes for the quantum anharmonic oscillator as a stepping stone to more physically interesting field theories .",

    "<S> here we show that , at least in the context of a toy model where exact results are available , the true strength of 2pi approximations derives from their self - consistency rather than any resummation . </S>",
    "<S> this self - consistency allows truncated 2pi approximations to capture the branch points of physical amplitudes where adjustments of coupling constants can trigger an instability of the vacuum . this , in effect , turns dyson s argument for the failure of perturbation theory on its head . as a result </S>",
    "<S> we find that 2pi approximations perform better than pad approximation and are competitive with borel - pad resummation . </S>",
