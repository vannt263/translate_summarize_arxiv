    "gravitational waves ( gws ) are one of the promising tools to probe the early universe .",
    "they provide a unique way to search for inflationary quantum fluctuations  @xcite , preheating  @xcite , topological defects  @xcite , and cosmic phase transitions ( pts )  @xcite . especially , first - order pts in the early universe have been attracted us because of their relation to high - energy physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) , and in fact various extensions of the sm have been shown to predict first - order pts with a large amount of gws  @xcite . on the observational side , ground - based gw experiments like kagra  @xcite ,",
    "virgo  @xcite and advanced ligo  @xcite are now in operation , and space interferometers such as elisa  @xcite , bbo  @xcite and decigo  @xcite have been proposed .",
    "given that there is a growing possibility of their detecting gws from cosmological sources in the near future , it would be worth reconsidering the theoretical predictions of gws from first - order pts .",
    "first - order pts proceed via the nucleation of bubbles , their expansion , collision and thermalization into light particles , and gws are produced during this process . in the transition process , some of the released energy goes into heating up the plasma , while the rest is carried by the scalar field configuration ( bubble wall ) and/or the bulk motion of the surrounding fluid .",
    "gravitational wave production by such localized structure of energy around the walls has been calculated by numerical simulations in the literature with so - called thin - wall and envelope approximations  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that these approximations are valid especially when the energy of bubbles is dominated by the scalar field configuration  @xcite , and the latest result along this approach is found in ref .",
    "analytic approaches have also been taken with some ansatz for correlator functions  @xcite .    in this paper , we take an approach based on the evaluation of the correlation function of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath2  @xcite , which is the only ingredient to obtain the spectrum .",
    "we point out that , under thin - wall and envelope approximations and in a flat background , this two - point correlator has a rather simple analytic expression and , as a result , the gw spectrum can also be expressed analytically .",
    "though the final expression for the spectrum contains two remaining integrations , they can easily be estimated numerically .",
    "our approach is not only free from statistical errors inherent to numerical simulations , but also enables us to specify the most effective bubble - wall configuration to the gw spectrum . at the current stage ,",
    "our results are most relevant to strong phase transitions like near - vacuum ones , since the neglected effects such as the finite width of the bubble walls and/or the localized structure of the energy - momentum tensor remaining after collisions can be important when the scalar field is strongly coupled to the thermal plasma  @xcite  . however , our method is extendable to the calculations without the envelope approximation  @xcite , and such studies would be important in understanding how the localized structure after bubble collisions sources gws .",

    "in this section we summarize basic ingredients for the calculation of gw spectrum .",
    "we first make clear the assumption and approximations used in the paper .",
    "we also explain the gw power spectrum around the time of sourcing from bubble collisions , and then show how to obtain the present spectrum .        in this subsection",
    ", we introduce the key assumptions to characterize the energy momentum tensor around the bubble wall , namely thin - wall and envelope approximations .",
    "first , we introduce the thin - wall approximation , where all the energy of the bubble is assumed to be concentrated on the bubble wall with an infinitesimal width .",
    "we introduce the infinitesimal wall width @xmath3 for computational simplicity .",
    "the energy momentum tensor @xmath4 of the uncollided wall of a single bubble nucleated at @xmath5 can be written as @xmath6 with @xmath7 and @xmath8 here @xmath9 , the hat on the vector @xmath10 indicates the unit vector in the direction of @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the bubble wall velocity , and @xmath13 represents the energy density released by the transition .",
    "also , @xmath14 indicates the efficiency factor , which determines the fraction of the released energy density which is transformed into the energy density localized around the wall introduced later  @xcite . ]  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the latin indices run over @xmath15 throughout the paper .",
    "second , we assume that the energy momentum tensor of the bubble walls vanishes once they collide with others . in the literature",
    "this is called envelope approximation , whose validity in bubble collisions is confirmed in _",
    "e.g. _ ref .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : envelope ] for a rough sketch of this approximation .",
    "these two assumptions make the calculation of the gw spectrum rather simple , as we will see later . also ,",
    "we regard the model - dependent quantities @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 as free parameters constant in time .",
    "we assume that the bubble nucleation rate per unit time and volume can be written in the following form : @xmath16 where @xmath17 indicates some fixed time typically around the transition time , @xmath18 is the nucleation rate at @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is assumed to be a constant .",
    "this parameter @xmath20 is often calculated with the instanton method from underlying models  @xcite , and the typical time span of the phase transition is given by @xmath21 .",
    "we also assume that the phase transition completes in a short period compared to the hubble time , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath22 , which typically holds for thermal phase transitions  @xcite .      in the following",
    "we express the gw spectrum in terms of the correlator of the energy - momentum tensor , following ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in this paper we consider gws sourced by the first order phase transition completed in a short period compared to the hubble time . in such cases the background metric",
    "is well approximated by the minkowski one .",
    "including tensor perturbations , we write the metric as @xmath23 the tensor perturbations satisfy the transverse and traceless condition @xmath24 and obey the following evolution equation @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the newton constant and @xmath27 indicates a fourier mode of the corresponding object with @xmath28 being the wave vector .",
    "we take the convention for fourier transformation to be @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",

    "( [ eq : heom ] ) is formally written in terms of the green function @xmath39 satisfying @xmath40 and @xmath41 as @xmath42 where @xmath43 .",
    "for @xmath44 , matching condition at @xmath45 gives @xmath46 with coefficients @xmath47      next we express the gw spectrum using eq .",
    "( [ eq : hsol ] ) .",
    "we define the equal - time correlator of the gws by @xmath48 and also define the unequal - time correlator of the source term by @xmath49 here the angular bracket denotes taking an ensemble average .",
    "note that the @xmath50 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pipi ] ) appears due to the spacial homogeneity of the system . in terms",
    "the original energy - momentum tensor , the correlator @xmath51 is written as @xmath52 where @xmath53 with @xmath54 .",
    "the l.h.s . depends only on @xmath55 because of the spacial homogeneity .",
    "now let us consider the time @xmath44 . since the gws and the source term are related with each other through eq .",
    "( [ eq : hsol ] ) , the power spectrum of @xmath56 is written in terms of the source as @xmath57 though we put the argument @xmath58 in the l.h.s .",
    ", the r.h.s . does not depend on it because there is no source term for @xmath44 and because we neglect the cosmic expansion .",
    "since the total energy density of gws is given by @xmath59 with @xmath60 being the oscillation and ensemble average , gw energy density per logarithmic frequency becomes @xmath61 with @xmath62 being the total energy density of the universe .",
    "now all we have to do is to estimate @xmath51 , or the two - point function of the energy momentum tensor @xmath63 .",
    "once the setup is defined , we can estimate this quantity analytically in principle .",
    "in fact , as shown later , this correlator @xmath63 can be expressed in an an analytical way under the thin - wall and envelope approximations ( see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : kktt_single ] ) and ( [ eq : kktt_double ] ) ) .    for later convenience , we rewrite the expression for the gw spectrum as follows .",
    "we define the parameter @xmath64 as @xmath65 which characterizes the fraction of the released energy density to that of radiation . here",
    "@xmath62 and @xmath66 are the total and radiation energy density , respectively . using @xmath64 thus defined , we have @xmath67 where @xmath68 is given by @xmath69 in deriving eq .",
    "( [ eq : omega_delta ] ) we have used the friedmann equation @xmath70 with @xmath71 being the hubble parameter at the transition time .",
    "note that the function @xmath68 depends only on the combination @xmath72 and the wall velocity @xmath12 , because the definition ( [ eq : omega_delta ] ) factors out @xmath14 , @xmath13 and @xmath62 dependence , and because @xmath68 is a dimensionless quantity .",
    "after produced , gws are redshifted during propagation towards the present time .",
    "the relation between the scale factor just after the phase transition @xmath73 and at present @xmath74 is given by @xmath75 where @xmath76 denotes the temperature just after the phase transition , and @xmath77 indicates the total number of the relativistic degrees of freedom in the thermal bath at temperature @xmath76 .",
    "the present frequency is obtained by redshifting as @xmath78 and the present gw amplitude is obtained from the fact that gws are non - interacting radiation as @xmath79",
    "the following sections are mainly devoted to the calculation of @xmath68 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : delta ] ) ) .",
    "we first focus on the case where the wall velocity is luminal , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath80 , since the final explanations become relatively simple in this case . generalization to @xmath81 is straightforward and done in sec .",
    "[ sec : vel ] .    in the expression of the gw spectrum ( [ eq : delta ] ) , the only nontrivial quantity is the two - point correlator @xmath82 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : pi ] ) .",
    "if we can calculate this quantity , or equivalently the average of the product of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath83 with given @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 , then we obtain the gw spectrum . in the following",
    "we show that this is indeed possible . for the energy momentum tensor to be nonzero at @xmath87 and @xmath88 with @xmath89 , the following two conditions are necessary and sufficient :    * no bubbles are nucleated inside the past light cones of @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "* bubble(s ) are nucleated on the past light cones of @xmath90 and @xmath91 , so that bubble walls are passing through the spacial points @xmath92 at time @xmath84 and @xmath93 at time @xmath85 .",
    "in order to understand the former condition , one needs to notice that any spacial point is passed by bubble walls only once in the envelope approximation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : envelope ] ) .",
    "then , if bubble(s ) nucleate inside the past light cone of @xmath90 or @xmath91 , either of the spacial points @xmath92 or @xmath93 is already passed by bubble walls before the evaluation time @xmath84 or @xmath85 .",
    "this makes it impossible for the energy - momentum tensor to be nonvanishing both at @xmath90 and @xmath91 , and therefore we need the former condition . on the other hand ,",
    "the latter condition is necessary for bubble walls to be just passing through @xmath92 and @xmath93 at the evaluation time @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "there are two possibilities for this condition : the bubble walls passing through @xmath90 and @xmath91 belong to one single nucleation point , or to two different nucleation points .",
    "we refer to these two as  single - bubble \" and ",
    "double - bubble \" contributions , respectively .",
    "[ fig : singledouble ] shows a schematic picture of these two contributions to the correlator @xmath2 . here one may wonder why we consider the single - bubble contribution , since it is well known that a spherical object do not radiate gws .",
    "the answer is that the single - bubble contribution takes into account the breaking of the original spherical symmetry of a bubble by collisions with others : see appendix  [ app : saru ] on this point .    in the following discussion ,",
    "we first make our notation clear .",
    "then , after discussing the condition for no bubble nucleation inside the past light cones , we consider single- and double - bubble contributions separately . the final expressions are eqs .",
