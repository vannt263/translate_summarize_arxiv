    "a significant feature of the physics of unconventional superconductors such as the cuprates is the constraint imposed on the motion of the charge carriers by the background degrees of freedom , i.e. the spins in the case of the cuprate superconductors .    in this paper",
    "we focus attention on a new class of constraints imposed on the motion of conduction electrons by the berry phase@xcite , or molecular aharonov - bohm phase @xcite , which can arise in molecular crystals with large on  site degeneracies . in general , for this to be the case the symmetries of electron and vibron states must match appropriately and , moreover , the number of electrons needs to be odd .    as an explicit example",
    ", we have demonstrated elsewhere @xcite the presence of a berry phase in negatively charged fullerene ions c@xmath3 , c@xmath4 , c@xmath5 ensuing from a dynamic jahn  teller ( djt ) effect arising from coupling between the partly occupied @xmath6 orbital and the @xmath7 vibron modes .",
    "in such a situation a physical electron ( or hole ) may be regarded as a composite particle , made up of the bare electron plus the geometrical phase which accompanies it when sitting , unpaired , ( or more generally in a state with an odd number of electrons ) on a given molecule . by contrast , either the absence of electrons or presence of a pair of electrons will eliminate the berry phase on that molecule .",
    "we argue below that the kinematical constraints imposed by the berry phase can be a factor capable of tilting the balance in favor of pairing , even in the presence of repulsive interactions @xcite .",
    "the way this works is for a pair of electrons on one molecule to gain energy by each tunnelling off onto neighbors with accompanying vibron excitations before coming together again",
    ". a single electron on the other hand will tunnel accompanied by its vibron excitations , so the electrons will gain less energy by tunnelling as individuals than will be gained by tunnelling as pairs .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a class of simple coupled electron  rotor models which we believe capture the essential physics introduced by the berry phase constraint .",
    "omitting at this stage the complications of real c@xmath8 anions , our model lattice hamiltonian is instead directly inspired by the simpler and well known @xcite strong  coupling berry phase molecule na@xmath1 .",
    "in general there are an infinite number of rotor states on each molecular site . to simplify further",
    ", we shall truncate to a 3state model for the rotors .",
    "the resulting many ",
    "site hamiltonian will be shown to take the form @xmath9 where @xmath10 are raising and lowering operators for a spin1 vibron manifold for each molecule , and @xmath11 denote first neighbors .    to test the pairing properties of ( [ spin1 ] ) , we include a hubbard repulsion term @xmath12 we then study the half  filled state of the model numerically for small systems ( 4 to 8 site rings ) , and also by a mean field bcs  type calculation for the 1d chain .",
    "the final conclusion is that the berry phase coupling is found to be greatly beneficial to electron pairing , at least within the simple 1d lattice studied so far .",
    "pairing , in particular , appears to prevail and to survive even in presence of a repulsive hubbard @xmath13 , up to values @xmath14 .    in section [ model ] we will introduce the main concepts and build our working hamiltonian , representing an idealized lattice of berry phase molecules .",
    "section [ numeric ] is devoted to a numerical study of the 4 , 6 and 8site 1d chain clusters , where correlations can be studied exactly , and the presence of pairing is demonstrated .    section [ meanf ] discusses a mean field bcs  type formulation for the infinite 1-d chain .",
    "we close with a discussion section , where a number of interesting open issues are also briefly presented .",
    "our model system is a regular lattice of molecules .",
    "each molecule possesses initially a degenerate orbital , an odd number of electrons , and a dynamical jahn - teller ( djt ) coupling ( with berry phase ) to a local vibration , also degenerate , of pseudorotational type . for simplicity",
    ", we stick to the case of one electron in a doubly degenerate orbital and one rotor , which provides the simplest case of berry phase coupling .",
    "the electron can hop from a molecule to the next one in the usual fashion , conserving ordinary spin .",
    "we will generally also include an on - site ( `` intra - molecular '' ) electron - electron repulsion @xmath13 , so that , for a nondegenerate level and no rotor coupling , we would have just an ordinary hubbard model .",
    "berry phase coupling to the rotors is the new ingredient giving rise to peculiar selection rules for electron hopping between two molecules in different rotor states . in the following ,",
    "we describe successively the on - site hamiltonian , and the full lattice hamiltonian inclusive of electron hopping .",
    "we consider at each site a molecule with a partly occupied doubly degenerate electronic state .",
    "suppose this orbital interacts via linear djt coupling with a doubly degenerate vibration . a practical example ( not relevant for superconductivity ) of such a situation is the na@xmath1 molecule . a single unpaired electron occupies the doubly degenerate electronic molecular orbital @xmath15 , and the doubly degenerate vibron is a pseudorotation of the na@xmath1 triangular structure .",
    "direct spectroscopical evidence has been found @xcite , showing that the formalism we present here ( supplemented by quadratic couplings which are omitted here for simplicity ) correctly describes the dynamics of this system .",
    "the single - molecule , one - electron , linear coupling case , is a classic jahn - teller textbook problem @xcite .",
    "when only one electron occupies the degenerate state , the lowest order electron - vibron hamiltonian can be written : @xmath16      \\pmatrix { 1 & 0 \\cr 0 & 1 }      + g { { \\hbar \\omega } \\over 2 } \\pmatrix { -q_1 & q_2 \\cr q_2 & q_1 } \\label{ham1}\\ ] ] where the @xmath17 matrices span the twofold @xmath18 electronic level , and @xmath19 are the vibrational normal coordinates in the vibron space ; the second term is the coupling between vibron and electron , of dimensionless strength @xmath20 .",
    "the problem is rotationally invariant in the ( @xmath21,@xmath22 ) space .",
    "it is therefore conveniently rewritten by introducing polar coordinates @xmath23 in the vibron space and a pseudospin @xmath24 representation in the electron space : @xmath25    in terms of these quantities the hamiltonian is expressed as : @xmath26+{{g\\hbar \\omega } \\over 2}\\left ( { \\matrix{0&{qe^{+i\\phi } } \\cr { qe^{-i\\phi } } & 0\\cr } } \\right ) \\label{ham2}\\ ] ]    a new total angular momentum @xmath27 , defined as @xmath28 is found to commute with @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath30 is only a _",
    "@xmath24 spanning in reality the twofold _ orbital _ state , and should not be confused with the _ true _ spin , which is ignored at this stage .",
    "because of this pseudospin @xmath24 term , the eigenvalues of @xmath27 are half - odd integer , an amusing anomaly first pointed out by herzberg and longuet - higgins @xcite for the case of the triangular molecule .",
    "this fractionalization can be seen as a manifestation of a berry phase @xcite of @xmath31 , which the vibrons pick up from the electron degeneracy @xcite .",
    "diagonalization of ( [ ham2 ] ) must in general be done numerically @xcite . in the limit of strong coupling ( @xmath32 ) , however , the massive radial @xmath33-motion can be approximately separated from the @xmath34-pseudorotation quantized by @xmath27 , and both can be solved analytically in the form of an oscillator and a free rotor respectively .    the resulting spectrum is classified according to @xmath27 and @xmath35 , the quantum number coming from the quantization of the radial massive motion motion : @xmath36 since we shall be concerned only with the low lying rotor states , we can forget the massive boson ladder .",
    "furthermore , we will express all energies in units of the pseudorotational quantum @xmath37 .",
    "the corresponding wavefunctions in the strong coupling limit are : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the appropriate harmonic oscillator wavefunction , and @xmath40 is a pseudospin mixing angle @xmath41    in the @xmath42 ( strong coupling ) limit @xmath40 tends to @xmath43 .",
    "the energy can be expanded as @xmath44    at low energies , we consider only the rotor states @xmath45 with energy : @xmath46 where we have omitted as usual the @xmath47 offset contribution ( polaron energy shift ) , but also the extra zero point energy 1/4 required by the berry phase @xcite .",
    "this is our simplified model for the one - electron berry molecule .    to study electron hopping among different molecules",
    ", we also need an equivalent description for molecular occupancy different from one .",
    "when two electrons occupy the molecular orbital in a singlet state , the djt distortion is still present .",
    "however , the orbital phases for the two electrons cancel each other and a berry phase is no longer present .    for uniformity with the one - electron case , we will still label for @xmath48=2 the pseudorotational levels with @xmath27 .",
    "cancellation of the geometrical phase now requires @xmath27 to be integer .",
    "the assumed spectrum is simply that of a standard free pseudorotor : @xmath49 with wavefunctions @xmath50 in the energy eigenvalue ( [ eni ] ) we are again omitting the polaron energy gain @xmath51 , ( units of @xmath52 ) .    in the @xmath48=0 case where no electron is present , no jahn - teller effect and thus no pseudorotor",
    "however we really would like to mimic an electron - hole symmetric situation , like for example going c@xmath53 or c@xmath54 with respect to c@xmath4 .",
    "for this reason we assume even for zero electrons a pseudorotation ( [ eni],[psii ] ) identical to that of the two electron case .",
    "we finally discard occupancies higher than two ; for instance , we may suppose that , if the average occupancy is one , states with @xmath55 are strongly suppressed by coulomb repulsions .",
    "to summarize , if @xmath48 is the number of electrons present in the degenerate orbital , @xmath56 assumes even or odd values according to whether @xmath48 is even or odd .",
    "the @xmath27-dependence of the energy eigenvalues is quadratic , like in a free ( pseudo-)rotor .",
    "the full quantum state of such a molecule , in the limit considered , is described by a set of three quantum numbers which for convenience we define as integers : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the z component of true electron spin .",
    "their allowed values are constrained in the form : @xmath59    with reference to the physics of c@xmath8 , discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the similarity with the present model should be clear .",
    "in that case , in particular , the ground state has even @xmath60 for even @xmath48 , and odd @xmath60 for odd @xmath48 .      to allow electrons to move among sites , we need to specify how the hopping process is affected by the @xmath27 quantum numbers on each site .",
    "therefore we begin considering one electron hopping between two neighbouring molecules . with sufficiently high point symmetry , such as",
    "one has for the linear chain , we will have hopping between @xmath62 and @xmath63 and between @xmath64 and @xmath65 only , with amplitude @xmath66 and @xmath67 respectively @xcite .",
    "if for instance the twofold degenerate state is associated to a p - orbital , then @xmath68 , @xmath69 , in slater - koster s notation@xcite .",
    "the hopping hamiltonian then is @xmath70 \\label{hhop}\\ ] ]    to characterize its behaviour , suppose we have on site 2 a spin up electron , with @xmath71 ( odd ) molecular pseudospin , and we want the hopping amplitude of this electron to site 1 with final spin up , and pseudospin @xmath72 ( also odd ) .",
    "we need to invert relation ( [ baschange ] ) to express the fermionic operators in the pseudospin basis :    @xmath73    the matrix element we compute depends also on the ( even ) pseudospin of the empty sites @xmath74 ( final state ) and @xmath75 ( initial state ) in the following way : @xmath76    the deltas here originate through trivial orthogonality of angular momentum wavefunctions ( [ psih],[psii ] ) , while the overall @xmath77 factors originate from the @xmath78 factors in ( [ cxy ] ) and in ( [ psih ] ) .",
    "if we limit ourselves to the special case of intermolecular interaction with @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) , then we have an additional conservation @xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) of the total pseudospin , as shown by eq .",
    "( [ kinel ] ) . in this cases",
    ", the spectrum separates into different independent manifolds . for @xmath79 ,",
    "they correspond to different values of total pseudospin .",
    "even if somewhat unrealistic ( for a real p state , @xmath66 is larger and positive , @xmath67 smaller and negative ) this is a very convenient choice and we shall adopt it in the following .",
    "we have made a check , to be described in sec .",
    "[ numeric ] , releasing this restriction , which have satisfied us that the physics is not fundamentally different in the more general case @xmath83 .",
    "accordingly , we define a single effective hopping @xmath84 which in the absence of direct electron - electron interactions is the only independent parameter of our model , the rotor energy quantum @xmath52 being unity .",
    "similar considerations and selection rules to those discussed above for the process @xmath85 apply to the case involving doubly occupied sites , namely @xmath86 , or @xmath87 .",
    "now we have all the ingredients to place these `` berry molecules '' on a lattice to see the effect of local rotor coupling on electron hopping .      as a first attempt to study this model on a lattice we consider a linear chain of @xmath2 sites , with @xmath88 electrons moving on them .",
    "the basis we consider is labelled by the set of all the @xmath89 , for @xmath90 , so that an arbitrary state is expandable on states : @xmath91 these basis states are obtained by ordered applications of @xmath88 local fermionic creation operators @xmath92 on a vacuum state where no electrons are present , and setting the @xmath93 rotational quantum numbers to values allowed by the berry constraint ( [ const ] ) .",
    "hopping of an electron between site @xmath94 and site @xmath27 is , in this space , a composite operation , since it implies @xmath95 , @xmath96 , but also @xmath97 , @xmath98 ( [ const],[kinel ] ) .",
    "hence , we write a general hopping hamiltonian in second quantized language as : @xmath99 where the action of the operator @xmath100 is to raise ( lower ) the pseudospin @xmath101 ( really an orbital angular momentum ) by one unit : @xmath102    to the hopping hamiltonian @xmath103 , we add an on - site rotor hamiltonian @xmath104 , as well as an additional on - site electron - electron hubbard interaction term @xmath105 @xmath106 the rotor energy contribution is at site @xmath27 due in the rotor state @xmath101 being @xmath107 as in eq .",
    "( [ enh],[eni ] ) , and having introduced a third operator @xmath108 the commutation relations for these operators are @xmath109=0 $ ] , @xmath110=\\pm l^\\pm$ ] .",
    "we stress here that the kinetic term @xmath111 alone in eq .",
    "( [ gen_model ] ) is the relevant part of the new hamiltonian we want to study .",
    "the new electron operators @xmath112 are diffrent from the original ones , @xmath113 , @xmath114 of eq .",
    "( [ hhop ] ) .",
    "in particular , we have now a single band , instead of the original double band problem .",
    "however , with the exclusion of all site occupancies higher than 2 , all matrix elements are the same in the two descriptions .    by construction ,",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ gen_model ] ) conserves the constraints ( [ const ] ) among the quantum numbers , and can therefore be diagonalized in the hilbert space of states defined in ( [ basis ] ) .",
    "the matrix elements of the kinetic term @xmath111 ( off diagonal ) and of @xmath115 ( diagonal ) on the basis ( [ basis ] ) are trivial , once periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) are applied to indexes",
    ". in some cases we shall however need antiperiodic boundary conditions ( abc ) , replacing @xmath116 with @xmath117 in the kinetic term involving sites 1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the hilbert space of the problem is infinite - dimensional even for finite @xmath2 , due to the @xmath93 rotor quantum numbers , which are boundless . in the numerical computations",
    ", we shall truncate the basis ( [ basis ] ) by choosing a cutoff energy @xmath118 , including only states having some local energy smaller than this @xmath118 .",
    "unfortunately , the choice @xmath119 is unfair with respect to singly occupied states , having larger energy ( at least by 1/4 ) than the unoccupied and doubly occupied lowest-@xmath27 ones . to achieve better convergence",
    "even at relatively small @xmath118 , we subtract this contribution and retain those states satisfying : @xmath120    the special case @xmath121 is of very strong interest .",
    "physically , this corresponds to the limiting case @xmath122 , where the intramolecular rotor energy is much larger than the hopping energy . in this limit ,",
    "the only allowed values for @xmath101 are 0 ( even occupancy ) and @xmath123 ( odd occupancy ) .",
    "the resulting model has six states per site , two corresponding to even ( 0 and 2 ) occupancies , and four to the @xmath124 combinations of spin @xmath125 and pseudospin @xmath101 values allowed for one electron .",
    "it is possible and convenient to rewrite this simplified version of the model in terms of fictitious spin-1 states , the @xmath101 quantum number becoming the @xmath126 projection of a pseudospin @xmath127 . for this simplified version we can rewrite the hamiltonian ( [ gen_model ] ) replacing the free rotor operators @xmath128 with the generators of the spin 1 algebra @xcite @xmath129",
    "respectively @xmath130    the full ladder of rotational states ( [ psih],[psii ] ) has now disappeared , being replaced just by the double degeneracy of the @xmath48=1 sites ( @xmath131=@xmath1321 ) , with @xmath133 for all @xmath48 .    the extra terms ( [ hloc ] ) would still need to be added to @xmath134 .",
    "however , @xmath104 has the simple effect of giving a energy shift of @xmath135 per each singly occupied site .",
    "as suggested above , this has the same effect of an operator such as : @xmath136 i.e. it is the same as a positive hubbard @xmath13 term with @xmath137 , apart from a chemical potential .",
    "for @xmath138 , this term amounts to a divergent shift of the hubbard @xmath13 .",
    "such a diverging term has no physical origin ( the jt energy gains we have neglected in ( [ enh ] ) and ( [ eni ] ) are also infinite and have opposite sign ) .",
    "therefore we will omit it , and simply work with hamiltonian ( [ spin1again ] ) , with the only _ caveat _ that we need to remember the shift in hubbard @xmath13 when comparing the results of this low - cutoff model ( [ spin1again ] ) with the fully converged one .    both hamiltonians ( [ gen_model ] ) and ( [ spin1again ] )",
    "show a significant degree of symmetry which we can take advantage of .",
    "each of them conserves the number of electrons @xmath88 , the total pseudo - angular momentum @xmath139 ( i. e. the total @xmath131 in the @xmath140=1 pseudospin version ) , and total electron spin . for a linear chain ,",
    "the lattice translational symmetry is also obvious .",
    "pseudospin conservation is a result of our approximation @xmath141 .",
    "the others are exact .",
    "we choose to study the problem ( [ gen_model ] ) in the manifold at half filling ( @xmath142 ) and at @xmath143 ( even @xmath144 ) , because of the higher symmetry present in this case , which includes electron - hole symmetry .",
    "although we have not yet carried out a complete study of the model away from half filling , we believe that the basic physics will be ( at least for @xmath13=0 ) the same , due to a suggestive analogy with the negative @xmath13 hubbard model which will finally emerge .    at this point , we are set with two alternative working models .",
    "the electron  rotor ( er ) model @xmath145 where @xmath111 , @xmath104 and @xmath146 are given by ( [ gen_model ] ) , ( [ hloc ] ) , is more realistic , and is characterized by two parameters , the hopping energy @xmath116 and the rotor energy @xmath52 .",
    "this latter quantity , in turn , contains the ionic mass , and will therefore make the model sensitive to isotopic changes .",
    "the second , electron ",
    "pseudospin one ( ep ) model @xmath147 where @xmath134 is given by ( [ spin1again ] ) , represents the extreme molecular limit and is more idealized , the hopping energy @xmath116 being the only parameter .",
    "clearly , there will be no isotope effect in this model .",
    "although the important terms are @xmath111 and @xmath134 , both models are endowed with the hubbard term @xmath105 , which can describe additional repulsive interactions , and is also convenient as a gauge of the effective attractions which will arise .",
    "having taken @xmath52 as the energy unit , the physical results in the er model will depend on the two dimensionless ratios @xmath148 , @xmath149 .",
    "those in the ep model will depend only upon @xmath150 , making direct comparison with the simple hubbard model particularly straightforward .",
    "as it will be shown , there is numerical evidence that the two models , er and ep , lead to qualitatively similar effects , at least when @xmath116 is not too large .",
    "hence , it will be possible for many purposes to focus on the simpler ep model .    in the next two sections , we propose to study these models on a 1d linear chain , as follows .",
    "first , we will study numerically some very small clusters , by direct diagonalization .",
    "this will permit a first crude comparison between er and ep , and also between them and the simple hubbard model .",
    "next , we will introduce a mean - field theory for model ep on the infinite 1d linear chain . here",
    ", the @xmath140=1 pseudospin variables can be approximately integrated out , giving rise to negative effective electron - electron forward and backward couplings , again suggesting singlet pairing .",
    "we consider here small @xmath2-site linear chain clusters ( rings ) , in particular @xmath2=4,6,8 , accessible to numerical diagonalization using conventional lanczos method . while these sizes are admittedly small",
    ", we find that the qualitative results for small @xmath2 are clear enough at this initial stage @xcite .",
    "we define useful equal  time correlation functions for singlet superconductivity ( sc ) and spin density wave ( sdw ) in the standard form of @xmath33-space  structure factors  : @xmath151    we ignore alternative channels , such as charge density waves ( cdw ) or triplet superconductivity @xcite , which can also be probed , but whose behaviour is not relevant at this stage .",
    "in particular , a cdw will be definitely disfavoured in the more general case away from half filling .",
    "the property of correlations ( [ sc ] ) and ( [ sdw ] ) is that they transform into one another under the transformation @xmath152 , @xmath153 , which , remarkably , amounts simply to the transformation @xmath154 @xcite in the hubbard model .",
    "hence in that model @xmath155 and @xmath156 are perfectly symmetric around @xmath13=0 , where their values must cross , the sc instability prevailing for @xmath1570 , the sdw for @xmath1580 .",

    "we choose pbc , so that the free system ( @xmath159 ) is in a closed shell configuration of 6 electrons . in the lower panel",

    "open shell and closed shell calculations must finally converge to the same answer for @xmath161 , and their systematic comparison at finite @xmath2 provides a rough but useful measure of finite - size corrections .    our strategy is therefore to calculate @xmath162 and @xmath163 for our hamiltonian @xmath164 and @xmath165 , as a function of @xmath150 , and to _ find the value of _",

    "the condensation wavevector @xmath33 is correspondingly zero with pbc and @xmath174 for abc .",
    "these results show , strikingly , that _ in the ep model , a finite positive _ @xmath175 _ is needed to suppress superconductivity in favor of sdws_. roughly , the ep model ( [ spin1again ] ) behaves therefore like a negative @xmath13 hubbard model , with @xmath176 for small @xmath2 , the value of @xmath177 varies with @xmath2 , and also depends on whether the shell is closed / open .",
    "although we have not tried a systematic finite - size scaling extrapolation for @xmath177 to the @xmath178 limit , the result up to @xmath2=8 suggests that @xmath179 in particular at @xmath2=6 both abc and pbc yield @xmath180 , which may therefore be a likely value .    we have also studied the full er model ( [ her ] ) . for this model",

    "hence , model er also leads to superconductive pairing for @xmath148 not too large .",
    "this fully confirms our expectations that kinematical restrictions imposed by the switching of orbital states are important in that regime . for larger values of @xmath116 ,",
    "these restrictions gradually become irrelevant , until , for @xmath183 we recover the value @xmath184 . in other words , when the hopping energy is too large , the djt effect does not work any more , and fig .",
    "[ uefffig ] describes how its `` phase '' part is quenched ( the jt distortion magnitude is held constant in our model ) .",

    "the two quantities are negative and coincide . in terms of the luttinger model phase diagram @xcite , this corresponds to a spin singlet superconducting state , which is therefore found to prevail .",
    "this is in very good agreement with the effective negative @xmath13 of the previous section , with the additional remark that the alternative possibility of charge - density waves is now explicitly ruled out .",
    "actually , the zero frequency limit is singular at zero temperature , when the fermi functions become step functions and the @xmath160 integration diverges logarithmically for vanishing frequency around @xmath250 , the fermi momentum for the berryons . in other words , in this approximation @xmath251 diverge as @xmath252 , at small @xmath126 .",

    "[ diagram ] .",
    "higher order diagrams will modify that .",
    "more importantly , in presence of a finite pairing amplitude , for example , this divergence will disappear , due to a pairing gap in the berryon spectrum .",
    "there is in fact an exact symmetry between fermions and pseudofermions , and the two cooper channels are also identical .",
    "a very important property of our berry phase  constrained tunnelling hamiltonian is the fact that the constraint operates at the energy scale of the tunnelling matrix element @xmath116 . thus the pairing tendency induced by the constraints is not dictated directly by the strength of the intra  molecular electron  vibron coupling , but rather by the indirect effect of this coupling in the semi  classical limit on the relative phase space available for single electron tunnelling versus that for pair tunnelling .",
    "thus the enforcing of the berry phase constraint effectively separates the energy scale of the tunnelling , @xmath116 , from that of the internal degrees of freedom of the constituent molecules .    in the case of c@xmath0 itself , the model is in too extreme a semi  classical limit to give a reasonable representation of the physics of k@xmath1c@xmath0 since , in that case , the dimensionless electron ",
    "vibron coupling strength @xmath20 is of order @xmath253 , whereas the strong coupling limit where the berry phase representation becomes useful is for @xmath254 .",
    "nevertheless , the model does illustrate a new physical principle for superconductivity in strongly constrained systems .",
    "it is tempting to make an analogy with the physics of the @xmath255 model of interest for describing the physics of doped mott insulators . in that case",
    "the hopping hamiltonian my be re - written as @xmath256 where @xmath257 are spin raising and lowering operators .",
    "a number of recent studies @xcite suggest that pairing of holes close to the half - full insulating state occurs as a result of kinematical constraints in this model .",
    "although the present model does not have the ordered or quasi  ordered background of the antiferromagnetic state in the @xmath255 model , it does have the feature that pair tunnelling proceeds by each partner causing a vibron excitation when executing a tunnelling step , which then annihilate when the pair of carriers come together again on the same site .",
    "similarly , in the @xmath255 model case , individual hole hopping is accompanied by a spin  flip , which can the be cancelled by the hopping of its partner .",
    "it is of interest to consider whether our berry phase considerations could also apply to the chevrel ",
    "phase class of superconductors such as lamo@xmath258se@xmath259 or pbmo@xmath258s@xmath260se@xmath261 @xcite . in these materials the mo@xmath258se@xmath259 cluster has a set of degenerate lumo orbitals analogous to those in c@xmath0 .",
    "measurements of the doping dependence of @xmath262 indicate a sharp maximum as a function of doping in the unfilled lumo shell . thus there is the possibility of a general class of constraint  driven superconductors with distinctly different dependence of @xmath262 on material parameters than those of the conventional bcs ",
    "type electron ",
    "phonon superconductors @xcite .",
    "although , as stated above , we do not expect our model to be a realistic representation of the physics of k@xmath1c@xmath0 , it would nevertheless be interesting to test experimentally whether the kind of electron  vibron coupling we have proposed could be observed in this compound .",
    "one way to do this would be through the two  vibron raman spectrum .",
    "our coupling mechanism would naturally lead to a direct electron ",
    "hole pair channel coupling to a pair of vibron modes .",
    "this channel would open up a gap of @xmath263 , in the vibron spectrum where @xmath264 is the superconducting gap , on lowering the temperature of the material below @xmath262 .",
    "more generally , we observe that the pseudorotor berry phase mechanism sketched here , ties together electron hopping with the hopping of quanta of _ orbital _ molecular angular momentum , which is unquenched in the free - molecule limit we start from . in the paired state",
    "orbital quanta are also paired , whereby the _",
    "orbital excitation branch will also develop a gap at _ @xmath265 .",
    "the gap will follow identically the superconducting gap at @xmath266",
    ". the staggered orbital susceptibility should therefore be maximum at @xmath267 . in turn , the uniform @xmath268 orbital susceptibility may also develop a maximum , although weaker , via momentum nonconserving or local field effects .",
    "it is possible that orbital effects of this kind , even if weaker than suggested by this extreme picture , could be detectable , e.g. , by nmr . in particular",
    ", the relaxation time @xmath269 could be enhanced at low temperature , and peak up around @xmath262 due to large susceptibility fluctuations @xcite .",
    "it would be of considerable interest to see if these new effect could be observed in k@xmath1c@xmath0 , and rb@xmath1c@xmath0 .",
    "encouragingly , in this latter compound , very recent nmr data @xcite seem to indicate a behavior of the relaxation time which is anomalous precisely in the way suggested above .",
    "the anomaly at @xmath262 , in particular , is seen in the rb ion , but not on the carbon , as we would expect for a c@xmath0 orbital effect .    finally , it is of interest to speculate that @xmath262 would be enhanced by doping our model system away from half  filling . because of the nature of our pairing mechanism , the carriers would have more phase space for pairing if each partner in a pair could find many empty neighboring sites to hop on to before re  pairing .",
    "thus the doping dependence of @xmath262 might be expected to have a maximum away from half  filling in systems for which this mechanism is driving the superconductivity . in this sense",
    "the case of half filling is probably the least favorable .",
    "there are indications from an exact solution for the 2electron state that in model ep , @xmath177 is one order of magnitude more attractive near zero filling @xcite .    in the fullerides , exact half filling appears to be required by chemical stability @xcite . in the chevrel systems , however , where continuous doping is feasible , one indeed finds a maximum of @xmath262 for a hole density close to one per molecular unit @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to only 1/6 filling of the narrow @xmath270 molecular band in that case @xcite .",
    "a second observation is that the correlation length should tend to be short , of the order of the intermolecular distance @xmath271 , since this is the scale where the energy gain takes place . in k@xmath1c@xmath0 , this expectation",
    "is well borne out , with a correlation length of order @xmath272 .    experimentally , it would be of interest to consider building new molecular solids where high - symmetry jahn - teller molecules can exchange electrons .",
    "larger molecules may be better ones because of a weaker intramolecular coulomb repulsion @xmath13 .",
    "relatively weak jt coupling may provide an additional favourable circumstance , since in that case the effective @xmath52 is larger ( although our treatment does not strictly apply there ) and djt quantum effects are more important .",
    "both these conditions are met in the fullerides , but it might be possible to find other systems where they apply .",
    "we have proposed a model for constrained tunnelling of charge carriers in a lattice of berry phase molecules , inspired by the physics of the fullerides .    the general model ( eq . [ gen_model ] )",
    "is based on an electron  quantum rotor hamiltonian which includes a ( in principle infinite ) manifold of vibron states on each site .",
    "although we have been able to investigate the effects of a large number of vibron states on the pairing tendency , it is clear that the effect is strongest when only the lowest are important . for the extreme case where only the lowest vibron state is important ( @xmath127 pseudospin model ) , both our numerical studies on small clusters ( section [ numeric ] ) and our bcs ",
    "type mean field treatment ( section [ meanf ] ) indicate a strong pairing tendency for a half  filled band .",
    "the fact that the model exhibits intrinsic pairing even in the presence of hubbard repulsion @xmath13 of order the tunnelling matrix element @xmath116 is understood readily from the form of the model hamiltonian ( eq . [ spin1 ] , [ gen_model ] ) .",
    "on integrating out the vibron degrees of freedom , we obtain an effective bcs attraction of order @xmath273 , where @xmath274 is a vibron bandwidth of order @xmath116 .",
    "thus the berry phase constraint leads to an electron  electron attraction whose energy scale is not directly related to the strength of the intra  molecular electron ",
    "vibron coupling in the semi  classical limit .    in physical terms , our model is based on the entanglement of orbital angular momentum of the individual molecules with electron hopping between molecules .",
    "pairing of electrons is generated by an accompanying ( `` singlet '' ) pairing of orbital momenta on neighbouring molecules , suggesting short correlation lengths in the order of the intermolecular spacing .",
    "it has been argued that this mechanism might be relevant also in such other molecular superconductors , such as the chevrel compounds .",
