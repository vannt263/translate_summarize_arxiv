    "( @xmath1 ) opened new and interesting questions on the unified model of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , the development of relativistic jets and the evolution of radio - loud agn ( abdo et al",
    ". 2009a , foschini et al .",
    "indeed , before _",
    "fermi_/lat ( large area telescope ) it was known that @xmath0 rays from agn are produced in blazars and radio galaxies , but we have to add also rl - nls1s .",
    "nls1s are active nuclei similar to seyferts , where the optical permitted lines emitted from the broad - line region ( blr ) are narrower than usual , with fwhm(h@xmath4)@xmath5  km  s@xmath6 ( see pogge 2000 , for a review ) .",
    "other characteristics are [ oiii]/h@xmath7 and a bump of feii , making them a peculiar class of agn .",
    "nls1s are different from seyfert 2s , whose optical spectra typically display fwhm(h@xmath4)@xmath8  km  s@xmath6 , [ oiii]/h@xmath9 and no bump of feii .",
    "nls1s are also different from the naked agn discovered by hawkins ( 2004 ) , a peculiar class of seyferts without the blr , which have [ oiii]/h@xmath10 . indeed , nls1s do have both blr and the narrow - line region ( nlr ) , but the blr emits only permitted lines narrower than in seyfert 1s ( rodrguez - ardila et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "nls1s are generally radio - quiet , but a small fraction of them ( @xmath11% , according to komossa et al .",
    "2006 ) , are radio - loud .",
    "it is not clear how these sources fit into the framework of radio - loud agn .",
    "some studies of the average non - simultaneous multiwavelength properties ( from radio to x - rays ) of rl - nls1s suggested some possibilities .",
    "komossa et al .",
    "( 2006 ) argued that rl - nls1s could be some young stage of quasars , while yuan et al .",
    "( 2008 ) found some similarities to tev bl lacs , but having strong emission lines they would represent the so - called `` high - frequency peaked flat - spectrum radio quasars '' conjectured by padovani ( 2007 ) .",
    "foschini et al .",
    "( 2009b ) found instead that there is no one - to - one correlation of rl - nls1s properties with any specific type of blazar or radio galaxy . in some cases , there are similarities with flat - spectrum radio quasars , while others are like bl lacs .",
    "now , the first detection by _ fermi_/lat of @xmath0 rays from one rl - nls1 - namely pmn j0948 + 0022 - sets the definitive confirmation of the presence of a relativistic jet in these sources . the discovery of @xmath2ray emission from other sources of this type ( abdo et al .",
    ", in preparation ) raise rl - nls1s to the rank of @xmath2ray emitting agn .",
    "however , any average spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of a @xmath2ray loud agn leaves open several important questions on the mechanisms of radiation emission , such as whether the synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) or the external compton ( ec ) production mechanism is dominant at high - energies and where the zone is where most of the dissipation occurs . because pmn j0948 + 0022 is the first object of this new class of @xmath2ray agn , it is important to observe it for a long time , in order to understand if there is something unexpected and if its behavior is very different from blazars and radio galaxies or not .    with these aims in mind , we decided to set up a multiwavelength campaign on this source .",
    "the campaign involved several space and ground - based facilities across the whole electromagnetic spectrum , from radio to @xmath0 rays ( in alphabetical order ) : atom ( landessternwarte ) , f - gamma ( effelsberg ) , e - vlbi ( evn , lba ) , _ fermi _ , g. haro telescope ( inaoe ) , metshovi , ovro , ratan-600 , _ swift _ , smarts , mojave ( vlba ) , wiro .",
    "the period covered was between 2009 march 24 and july 5 .",
    "we measured variability at multiple wavebands , modelled the resulting seds , and compared the results to those for more typical @xmath2ray blazars in the fsrq and bl lac classes .    throughout this work",

    "[ fig : rspec ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : uvotspec ] ) , except for x - rays , which show no variability in the photon index , despite showing the strongest flux variations .    to check for the presence of variability , we fitted the light curves at different frequencies with a constant flux light curve , but we got high values of reduced @xmath37 , thus confirming that the source displayed some activity at all the wavelengths ( table  [ tab : variability ] ) .",
    "the most dramatic flux changes are in x - rays ( factor 3.9 ) , radio 37 ghz ( factor 3.2 ) and optical v and r filters ( factor 2.7 and 2.9 , respectively ) , the latter with day timescales ( table  [ tab : variability ] ) .",
    "interestingly , a clear decreasing trend from x - rays to optical wavelengths is visible at the beginning of may and corresponds to a period with decreasing @xmath0 rays ( table  [ tab : latsummary ] ) .",
    "although only a few observations are available between may 5 and 15 , the drop in flux is consistent with an exponential decay of the form @xmath112 $ ] , with a decay constant @xmath113 days .",
    "the opposite occurs at radio and nir frequencies , reaching a peak at 15 ghz about 20 days after the beginning of the x - ray - to - optical flux decrease .",
    "this coordinated trend is the typical behavior expected from the electromagnetic emission of a relativistic jet . at the radio , optical and x - ray frequencies ,",
    "there is a dominance of the synchrotron and synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) processes , while @xmath0 rays are generated by external compton ( ec ) .",
    "this is also clear by looking at the change in the optical / uv spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : uvotspec ] ) .",
    "indeed , it is known that these frequencies sample the rising part of the accretion disk bump , but before may 5 the optical / uv spectrum was flatter ( @xmath114 ) and at high fluxes ( , where @xmath115 and @xmath116 are the fluxes at frequencies @xmath117 and @xmath118 . ] ) .",
    "this is likely due to a higher synchrotron emission , while the accretion disk had relatively small change . in the following @xmath119  days , the synchrotron emission decreased to its minimum , and",
    "the shape of the optical / uv emission returned to being hard ( @xmath120 ) and mainly due to the rising part of the accretion disk bump .",
    "the x - ray emission followed this behavior , being due to ssc , i.e. it was high on may 5 and decreased to its minimum on may 15 .",
    "the radio emission , coming from zones farther away from the optical - to-@xmath0 rays dissipation region , reached its peak about 20 days after the optical - to - x - ray drop , as shown in the light curves at 15 and 37  ghz ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ovro ] ) .",
    "however , the spectral index @xmath121 , as measured between 4.85 and 14.6  ghz , changed well before , from a rather flat value ( @xmath122 ) on april 13 ( mjd 54934.98 ) and earlier , to an inverted spectrum ( @xmath123 ) already on april 30 ( mjd 54951.75 ) ( about two weeks , see fig .  [",
    "fig : rspec ] ) . on may 27 ( mjd 54978.79 ) , close to the maximum flux , the spectral inversion was at its maximum too ( @xmath124 ) and then , on june 27 ( mjd 55009.53 )",
    ", the spectral index was already returning to a flatter shape ( @xmath125 ) .",
    "this is in agreement with the findings by kovalev et al .",
    "( 2009 ) with reference to the general radio vs @xmath2ray properties of the blazars detected by _",
    "fermi_/lat during the first three months of operation ( abdo et al .",

    "2008 , larionov et al . 2008 , villata et al . 2009 ) . in the present case ,",
    "if we adopt as references the peak of the @xmath2ray emission that occurred in the first two weeks of 2009 april and the peak of the radio flux at 15 ghz that occurred in the second half of 2009 may , we can roughly estimate a delay of 1.5 - 2 months .",
    "the modeling of the sed ( fig .",
    "[ fig : combo ] , table  [ tab : ghisellini ] , see also the evolution of the model parameters in fig .",
    "[ fig : model1 ] and [ fig : model2 ] ) confirmed this phenomenological view . during this campaign , the modelled values of the magnetic field , injected power , and the radius at which dissipation of energy occurs varied by factors of 2.4 , 4.1 and 2.4 , respectively .",
    "at the same time , the power in radiation , electrons , protons , and the magnetic field varied by 4.4 , 3 , 4.2 and 1.2 , respectively .",
    "the dissipation radius was @xmath126  cm , roughly @xmath127  light years or @xmath128  pc from the central supermassive black hole . at the beginning of may , when the synchrotron and ssc emission dominate the optical - to - x - ray emission ,",
    "the dissipation region is very compact and the magnetic field is high .",
    "the trend of the injected power ( flagged by the @xmath2ray emission ) is decreasing .",
    "then , on may 15 , the dissipation radius is larger together with a smaller value of the magnetic field .",
    "we note that the accretion remained almost constant , at about 40 - 50% of the eddington value .",
    "the fit from the `` overall '' sed ( table  [ tab : ghisellini ] ) had the following values : the dissipation radius is @xmath129  cm , @xmath130 times the eddington luminosity , the injected power is @xmath131  erg  s@xmath6 , while the power carried out by the jet is @xmath132  erg  s@xmath6 in protons , @xmath133  erg  s@xmath6 in electrons , @xmath134  erg  s@xmath6 in radiation , and @xmath135  erg  s@xmath6 in the magnetic field .",
    "these values are well within the range of typical values for other @xmath2ray blazars ( cf celotti & ghisellini 2008 , ghisellini et al .",
    "we thus confirm that pmn j0948 + 0022  despite being a radio - loud narrow - line seyfert 1  hosts a relativistic @xmath2ray emitting jet , similar to those of fsrqs , and confirms all the hypotheses adopted to model the non - simultaneous sed in abdo et al .",
    "( 2009a ) .",
    "this type of source can develop a relativistic jet like blazars and radio galaxies , even though the conditions of the environment close to its central spacetime singularity are quite different .",
    "this is indeed a new class of @xmath2ray emitting agn .",
    "we have shown that the variability at multiple wavebands and the physical parameters resulting from modelling the seds are typical of a source midway between fsrqs and bl lacs .",
    "the calculated powers carried by the various components of the jet are low compared to the distributions of values for fsrq , but above those of bl lacs ( cf celotti & ghisellini 2008 , ghisellini et al .",
    "2009 ) , and therefore within the average range of blazar powers , despite the relatively low mass of its black hole , @xmath136 ( abdo et al .",
    "the @xmath2ray observations performed to date have not revealed very high fluxes , i.e. above the usual threshold adopted to define an outburst in normal blazars ( @xmath137  ph  @xmath21  s@xmath6 ) . however , it is not clear yet if this is due to the duty cycle of this source  and hence if we have just observed a minor event  or if the different environmental conditions in the core of rl - nls1s hampers the development of a high power jet",
