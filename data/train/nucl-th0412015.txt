    "the latter is due to the greater variation of the friction and diffusion coefficients with momentum which makes the approximation of momentum - independent coefficients , underlying the derivation of the fluctuation - dissipation relation ( [ diss - fluct ] ) , less accurate .",
    "for this reason , in the next section we shall use the renormalization scheme without form factor to investigate the time evolution of @xmath4 spectra . for the heavier bottom",
    "quarks the fluctuation - dissipation theorem is satisfied to high accuracy .",
    "let us finally address the time evolution of charm - quark @xmath4-spectra including the temperature dependence of drag and diffusion coefficients . to obtain the time evolution of the temperature we use a simple expanding fireball model  @xcite .",
    "in reminiscence to hydrodynamic simulations  @xcite of central au - au collisions at rhic , the fireball volume is parameterized by @xmath148 where @xmath149  fm and @xmath150  fm are the initial transverse and longitudinal size ( the latter corresponding to a formation time of @xmath151  fm/@xmath2 ) .",
    "the longitudinal and transverse expansion are characterized by @xmath152 ( covering a thermal width of about 1.8 units in rapidity ) and @xmath153  @xmath154/fm ( yielding a total fireball lifetime of about 14  fm/@xmath2 with a thermal freezeout temperature of @xmath14110  mev ) .",
    "assuming isentropic expansion , the temperature at each instant is calculated from the total entropy of produced particles , @xmath155 ( within @xmath156=1.8 ) , with the entropy density in the qgp given by @xmath157 ( @xmath158 is the effective number of quark flavors , taken to be 2.5 ) .    with these parameters ,",
    "the initial qgp temperature is @xmath159  mev , decreasing to the critical temperature of @xmath160  mev after about @xmath161  fm/@xmath2 , with further evolution in a hadron - qgp mixed phase for another @xmath161  fm/@xmath2 . for simplicity",
    ", we treat the latter phase as a qgp at constant @xmath162  mev , but accounting for lower parton densities as estimated from the temperature dependence of the fokker - planck coefficients ( from the lower panel of fig .",

    "one finds that , when allowing for pqcd rescattering only , the initial spectra from @xmath128-@xmath128 collisions are affected rather little . on the contrary , when augmenting the interactions with @xmath0-meson resonances in the @xmath0-meson resonance propagator . in principle , this would lead to a slight renormalization of the resonance mass and width , which , however , is well inside the range of uncertainties of the in - medium resonance parameters . ] , the @xmath4-spectra undergo a marked reshaping , essentially a redistribution from high to low @xmath4 .",
    "the final spectra ( _ i.e. _ , at the end of the mixed phase after 6  fm/@xmath2 ) , with a peak position at @xmath176  gev , indeed closely resemble a thermal distribution with a temperature of about @xmath177  mev . even though this indicates that the spectra are not fully thermalized at @xmath27 ,",
    "the change from an initial average @xmath178  gev ( corresponding to a  temperature \" of @xmath14920  mev ) is appreciable .",
    "the fact that most of rescattering occurs in the early evolution phase ( the first 3  fm/@xmath2 or so , cf .",
    "right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_tevo ] ) should provide favorable conditions for the build - up of _ elliptic _ flow .",
    "we recall that our treatment becomes unreliable toward high @xmath4 , since ( i ) we have neglected the momentum dependence of the drag and diffusion coefficients ( _ i.e. _ , used their values at zero momentum ) , whereas in reality they decrease with @xmath4 ( cf .",
    "[ fig_coeff ] ) , and ( ii ) we have not accounted for induced gluon emission which is expected to be the main mechanism for energy loss of high-@xmath4 partons within pqcd  @xcite . also note that transverse - flow effects , _",
    "i.e. _ , lorentz boosts of the ( partially ) thermalized @xmath2-quarks from the comoving ( thermal ) frame into the lab frame , are not included in fig .",
    "[ fig_tevo ] .",
    "finally , the ( possibly gradual ) disappearance of resonance states toward high temperatures has not been incorporated ( whether this happens under rhic conditions with initial temperatures of 2  @xmath27 is not clear at present ; _",
    "e.g. _ , in the lattice calculations of refs .",
    "@xcite resonance signals are still observed around these temperatures ) .",
    "in the present work we have studied the role of resonant rescattering for heavy quarks in a quark - gluon plasma at moderate temperatures . our main assumption has been the existence of @xmath0-meson - like resonance states above @xmath27 which finds support in both effective quark models and recent qcd lattice calculations .",
    "the underlying lagrangian embodied both chiral and heavy - quark symmetry , where the latter has been essential to ensure conserved vector currents ( for @xmath26 resonances ) .",
    "bare masses and coupling constants of the model have been adjusted to render one - loop resummed @xmath0-meson spectral functions reminiscent to more microscopic calculations .",
    "pertinent cross sections for resonant @xmath2-quark rescattering on light antiquarks in the heat bath have been applied within a fokker - planck equation to evaluate kinetic thermalization .",
    "our main finding is that the introduction of resonances in the qgp leads to a substantial reduction of the equilibration - time scales ( by a factor of @xmath143 ) as compared to estimates based on perturbative interactions . to a large extent",
    ", this difference originates from the isotropy of the angular distributions for resonant scattering , as opposed to mostly forward scattering in pqcd , which importantly enters into the ( angular - weighted ) transport cross section .",
    "the reduced timescales are very reminiscent to expected qgp lifetimes in central au - au collisions at rhic .",
    "consequently , time - evolved @xmath2-quark @xmath4-spectra exhibit a marked tendency toward thermalization in the resonance picture , whereas they are only little affected by pqcd rescattering alone .",
    "this should have important consequences for the build - up of elliptic flow of charmed hadrons .",
    "let us briefly discuss further ramifications and directions for future work . clearly , the three - momentum dependence of the drag and diffusion coefficients , the effects of transverse flow and the evaluation of elliptic flow need to be addressed .",
    "quasiparticle masses for light quarks and gluons should be introduced to make a closer connection to the qgp equation of state .",
    "the disappearance of the bound states needs to be accounted for , especially for applications at lhc with larger anticipated initial temperatures than at rhic .",
    "indeed , a key question that may eventually be answered by lattice qcd is whether @xmath0-meson ( and other ) resonances in the qgp exist , and , if so , whether they are located _ above _ the two - quark threshold , which renders them accessible for direct ( @xmath2+@xmath179@xmath180@xmath2+@xmath21 ) scattering processes .",
    "clearly , if this is not the case , other processes , such as @xmath2+@xmath21@xmath180@xmath0+@xmath134 , need to be evaluated .",
    "the effects on secondary @xmath181 production should also be checked  @xcite . _ e.g. _ , according to recent transport calculations  @xcite , upscaling pqcd cross sections by a factor of 3 ( to generate a significant elliptic flow ) entails an increase in open - charm pairs by 40 - 50% over primordial production in central au - au collisions at rhic , which is not supported by current phenix data  @xcite .",
    "resonance cross sections , due to the larger @xmath0-meson mass in the crossed channel , may not have this feature ( or , at least , to a less extent ) .",
    "finally , we recall the important impact that heavy - quark momentum distributions have on secondary production ( `` coalescence '' ) of charmonium and bottomonium states .",
    "obviously , the combined theoretical and experimental study of heavy - flavor probes promises a rich potential for the understanding of the complex nature of qgp at moderate temperatures .",
