    "affine toda field theory @xcite is one of the most successful examples of the two - dimensional quantum field theory since it can be solved exactly .",
    "this theory possesses remarkable properties including classical and quantum integrability .",
    "an interesting review of the recent developments in affine toda field theory is presented in ref.@xcite .",
    "the classical affine toda field theories remain integrable in the presence of certain boundary conditions restricting them to a half - line , or to an interval @xcite . indeed , corrigan et.al @xcite have classified the boundary conditions which preserve classical integrability",
    ". however , quantum integrability are hardly explored in the presence of a boundary although there has been progress for models based on @xmath0 class of theories @xcite .",
    "the simplest of these ( n=1 ) is the sinh - gordon model .",
    "in fact , this model is the only example in the @xmath1 series of affine toda field theory which allows continuous boundary parameters .",
    "although the sinh - gordon model has been studied much more than other models in the integrable quantum field theories there still remains much to be studied in connection with the quantum integrability of the model with a boundary .",
    "in particular , one of the interesting problems is to see how the boundary parameters could relate to the quantum reflection factor of the theory .    in 1993",
    "ghoshal and zamolodchikov @xcite studied the behaviour of the sine - gordon model restricted to a half - line .",
    "they found the soliton reflection factors in the model and discovered a two parameter family of boundary conditions which preserved integrability .",
    "then , ghoshal @xcite computed the reflection factors of the soliton - antisoliton bound states ( the breathers ) of the model .",
    "the pioneering ideas of ghoshal and zamolodchikov motivated many researchers to investigate integrable quantum field theory with a boundary .",
    "corrigan @xcite was the first to discover that the lightest breather reflection factor of the sine - gordon model is identical to the reflection factor of the sinh - gordon model followed by an analytic continuation in the coupling constant .",
    "recently , corrigan and delius @xcite calculated the bound - state spectrum of the sinh - gordon model on a half - line in two different ways , firstly by using a boundary bootstrap principal , and secondly by quantizing the classical boundary breather states using a wkb technique ( for further discussion see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "comparing these two calculations provides a relationship between the boundary parameters , the bulk coupling constant and the parameters in ghoshal s formula .",
    "they performed the calculations in the special case where the bulk @xmath2 symmetry is conserved at the boundary , by requiring the two boundary parameters to be equal .",
    "then , corrigan and taormina @xcite studied and extended the idea of @xcite in the intricate case where the two boundary parameters are different and the bulk symmetry is violated .",
    "their calculations lead to a determination of the relationship between the lagrangian boundary parameters and the two parameters appearing in the reflection factor of the sinh - gordon particle .",
    "moreover , their results clarify the weak - strong coupling duality of the sinh - gordon model with integrable boundary conditions .",
    "the one loop quantum corrections to the classical reflection factor of the sinh - gordon model have been found @xcite when the boundary parameters are equal .",
    "if the two boundary parameters are different and the bulk @xmath2 symmetry of the model is broken then , the lowest energy static background configuration will not be a trivial solution ( @xmath3 ) . in this intricate case",
    ", the perturbation theory must be developed within a complicated background .",
    "meanwhile , the corresponding calculations involve a significantly more difficult propagator as well as intricate coupling constants . in a recent",
    "paper @xcite the quantum reflection factor has been found in one loop order up to the first order in the difference of the boundary parameters .",
    "the calculations provide a further verification of ghoshal s formula up to the first order .",
    "the quantum reflection factor up to the second order in the difference of the boundary data is treated in this article .",
    "the result could test more deeply the expression for the sinh - gordon model reflection factor given in ref .",
    "the sinh - gordon theory describes a real massive scalar quantum field theory in 1 + 1 dimensions with exponential self - interaction .",
    "the lagrangian density of the theory in the presence of a boundary is @xmath4 where the bulk lagrangian density of the model is @xmath5 and the boundary potential @xmath6 has the following generic form @xcite @xmath7 note , in the above expressions @xmath8 and @xmath9 are a mass scale and a coupling constant of the theory and we have used normalizations customary in affine toda field theory .",
    "the two real coefficients @xmath10 and @xmath11 are essentially free which indicate @xcite the extra parameters permitted at the boundary @xmath12",
    ". meanwhile , the boundary potential is required to satisfy the following equation as a consequence of maintaining integrability on the half - line : @xmath13 or @xmath14 where we have rescaled the mass scale to unity in the integrable boundary condition .",
    "it is also convenient to use an alternative expression for the boundary parameters , i.e. @xmath15 .",
    "the sinh - gordon model is integrable classically which implies there are infinitely many mutually commuting , independent conserved charges @xmath16 , where s is an arbitrary odd integer . on the other hand ,",
    "the model is integrable in the context of quantum field theory which means the s - matrix describing the n - particles scattering factorises into a product of two - particles scattering amplitudes .",
    "the s - matrix describing the elastic scattering of two sinh - gordon particles with relative rapidity @xmath17 is conjectured to be given by @xcite @xmath18 where we have used the hyperbolic building block notation @xmath19 and the quantity b is related to the coupling constant @xmath9 by @xmath20 .    for the boundary sinh - gordon model",
    ", the most important physical quantity is the boundary s - matrix or the reflection factor which describes the reflection of a single particle from the boundary .",
    "firstly , ghoshal and zamolodchikov @xcite calculated the soliton reflection factors for the sine - gordon model by solving the boundary yang - baxter equation and using general constraints implementing unitarity and a form of crossing symmetry .",
    "then , ghoshal @xcite calculated the soliton - antisoliton bound states reflection factor by using the boundary bootstrap equation . finally , following the idea discovered by corrigan @xcite , the quantum reflection factor for the lightest breather in the sine - gordon model is supposed to be identical with the quantum reflection factor of the sinh - gordon particle after doing analytic continuation in the coupling constant to derive    @xmath21    when the bulk reflection symmetry is preserved which means @xmath22 , then one of two parameters @xmath23 or @xmath24 vanishes .",
    "recently , on the basis of a perturbative calculation , the form of the @xmath23 and @xmath24 was conjectured to be @xcite , @xmath25 in fact , corrigan and taormina @xcite gave further evidence for these formulae .",
    "they computed the energy spectrum of the quantized boundary states , firstly by using a bootstrap technique and , secondly using a wkb approximation .",
    "requiring that the two methods agree with each other provides further support to the above conjecture .",
    "meanwhile , they did the non - perturbative calculations in the significantly more difficult case when @xmath26 .",
    "since perturbative expansion will be developed around an @xmath27-dependent static background field configuration , it is possible to use standard feynman rules in configuration space .",
    "we will find that the theory needs three- and four - point couplings which depend upon the @xmath27-dependent static background .",
    "in other words , the interaction vertices in the feynman diagrams will be position dependent . in order to derive the three and four - point couplings , we need to expand the bulk and boundary potentials in terms of the coupling constant @xmath9 around the background solution .",
    "we obtain the bulk three- and four - point couplings :    @xmath28    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the background solution to the equation of motion of the model .",
    "similarly , the boundary three and four point couplings may be found as : @xmath31 @xmath32 meanwhile , we may consider the linear perturbation of the equation of the motion and the boundary condition around the background field @xcite to yield @xmath33 where @xmath34 is related to the boundary data and satisfies @xmath35 so , after some manipulation , the bulk three- and four - point couplings become @xmath36    @xmath37    and similarly , @xmath38",
    "@xmath39    we also need to find the green s function for the theory .",
    "the two - point propagator for the boundary sinh - gordon model is known @xcite to have the form @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 represent the classical reflection factor of the model which is given by @xmath43 indeed , the quantum reflection factor ( 2.8 ) reduces @xcite to the classical reflection ( 3.13 ) in the classical limit @xmath44 provided @xmath45 and @xmath46 .    in this paper",
    "it is intended to calculate the quantum corrections to the classical reflection factor of the sinh - gordon model at one loop order and up to the second order in the difference of the boundary parameters .",
    "hence , it is necessary to expand the bulk and the boundary couplings .",
    "in fact , @xmath47    @xmath48    where @xmath49 .",
    "similarly , @xmath50 and @xmath51 now let us find the expansions of @xmath52 and the classical reflection factor @xmath42 , both of them appear in the green s function ( 3.11 ) . these can be shown to be @xmath53 and @xmath54 or in a compact form @xmath55 here , @xmath56 is the classical reflection factor when the two boundary parameters are equal . to calculate the one loop ( @xmath57 ) quantum corrections to the classical reflection factor",
    ", we use the idea introduced by kim @xcite and developed by corrigan @xcite . in other words , after perturbative calculation of the propagator the @xmath57 corrections to the classical reflection factor can be made by looking at the coefficient of @xmath58 in the residue of the on - shell pole in the asymptotic region @xmath59 .",
    "the computations corresponding to the one loop quantum corrections to the classical reflection factor may be performed by the standard perturbation theory which has been generalised to the affine toda field theory@xcite in the presence of an integrable boundary .",
    "there are three basic types of feynman diagrams which contribute to the two - point green s function of affine toda field theory in one loop order .",
    "these are shown in figure 1 .",
    "now by looking at the three - point and four - point couplings , we realize that all types of these diagrams are concerned in our problem ( up to the second order in the difference of the boundary data ) . in what follows",
    "we calculate the contributions of types i and iii feynman diagrams to the reflection factor .",
    "the remaining diagrams will be treated elsewhere .",
    "i ii iii    figure 1 : three basic feynman diagrams in one loop order .",
    "clearly , the type iii feynman diagram includes four different configurations depending on the fact that the interaction vertices to be located in the bulk region or at the boundary .",
    "this section deals with the calculations corresponding to the contribution of the type iii feynman diagram to the reflection factor when both vertices are placed at the boundary .",
    "the associated contribution may be given by @xmath60 here , the related three point couplings and the combinatorial factor have been considered .",
    "it is evident that in this case the two - point green function has the simplest form as @xmath61 where @xmath62 moreover , the loop propagator has been found in ref.@xcite and so , @xmath63 now it is convenient to calculate the time integral of the other middle propagator in ( 4.1 ) , i.e. @xmath64 which is equal to @xmath65 integrating over @xmath66 gives us a dirac delta function so , the above relation reduces to    @xmath67    hence , @xmath68    therefore , up to now the contribution ( 4.1 ) has the form @xmath69 first of all , it is understood to perform the transformation @xmath70 in the first term of the first propagator . secondly , after integration over @xmath71 which ensures energy conservation at the interaction vertex",
    ", the result will be a dirac delta function which immediately gives rise to the substitution @xmath72 . finally , the momenta of the two propagator can be integrated out by taking the contours to be closed in the upper half - plane and considering the pole at @xmath73 and ignoring the other pole i.e. @xmath74 ( when @xmath75 due to the fact that its residue will vanish in the limit @xmath76 .",
    "thus the type iii ( boundary - boundary ) contribution becomes @xmath77 where @xmath78 .",
    "now let us calculate the contribution of the type iii feynman diagram to the reflection factor when the interaction vertex corresponding to the loop is placed inside the bulk region and the other vertex is at the boundary . as before , the combinatorial factor of the diagram should be considered as a coefficient factor .",
    "moreover , in this case we must take into account the bulk three - point coupling in the loop vertex as well as the boundary three - point coupling in the other vertex . the contribution",
    "this time is @xmath79 in fact , in the previous section we found the following relation which is some part of the contribution ( 5.1 ) : @xmath80 clearly , in the boundary - bulk contribution ( 5.1 ) , it is seen that the @xmath66 dependence is involved only in the propagator @xmath81 .",
    "so , it is convenient to compute the following relation @xmath82 integrating over @xmath66 generates a dirac delta function which allows the substitution @xmath83 and hence , @xmath84 therefore , we obtain @xmath85    now let us calculate the loop propagator which has the form @xmath86 in fact , the above integral is divergent",
    ". however , this divergence can be removed by an infinite renormalization of the mass parameter in the bulk potential . in other words , a minimal subtraction of the divergent part can be made by adding an appropriate counterterm to the bulk potential . meanwhile ,",
    "if we integrate over @xmath87 then , we will find    @xmath88    hence , the remaining part of the contribution ( 5.1 ) is simplified as ( apart from the coefficients ) @xmath89 in order to integrate over @xmath90 , one may use the following formula @xmath91 where the quantity @xmath92 must be positive .",
    "the @xmath93 integration can be evaluated by closing the contour in the upper ( lower ) half - plane depending on whether @xmath94 ( @xmath95 ) . however , due to the branch cut the contour has to run around the cut line .",
    "note , the cut line stretches from @xmath96 to infinity along the imaginary axis when @xmath94 . otherwise , the cut line run from @xmath97 to @xmath98 along the imaginary axis when @xmath99 .",
    "so , after performing the required integrations @xmath100 therefore , the contribution of the type iii ( boundary - bulk ) diagram to the reflection factor is @xmath101",
    "let us consider the type iii feynman diagram when the loop vertex is at the boundary and the other interaction vertex is inside the bulk region .",
    "so , in this case the contribution is @xmath102    in fact , we have obtained the two middle propagators in the previous sections .",
    "hence ,    @xmath103    and @xmath104 so , the contribution ( 6.1 ) can be shown in detail as ( after doing the integration over @xmath71 )    @xmath105    the integration over @xmath27 may be done by using the device ( 5.9 )",
    ". meanwhile , it is necessary to perform a transformation @xmath70 in the first term of the first propagator .",
    "therefore , the above expression becomes @xmath106 clearly , all that remains is to integrate over the momenta @xmath107 , @xmath108 .",
    "this can be achieved by completing the contours in the upper half - plane and picking up the pole at @xmath73 and regarding the fact that all the other poles have no contributions because their residues yield exponentially damped terms in the asymptotic region @xmath109 .",
    "hence , the contribution of the type iii ( bulk - boundary ) feynman diagram to the reflection factor is @xmath110",
    "in this section we study the type iii ( bulk - bulk ) feynman diagram which contribute to the quantum correction to the classical reflection factor .",
    "it is evident that in this case both interaction vertices are located inside the bulk region .",
    "so , in this configuration the corresponding contribution is given by @xmath111 as it was shown in the type iii ( boundary - bulk ) case , the loop propagator can be simplified to obtain    @xmath112    moreover , the time variable @xmath66 appears only in the other middle propagator .",
    "therefore , it is appropriate to calculate the following relation    @xmath113    the integration over @xmath66 gives us a dirac delta function which replaces @xmath87 by zero and hence , @xmath114    let us rewrite the contribution ( 7.1 ) in the expanded form in order to find how we may carry out the required integrations ( first setting @xmath115 in the first term of the first propagator )    @xmath116    the starting point is to perform the @xmath71 integration which immediately removes the energy variable @xmath117 .",
    "moreover , by multiplying the first and the third propagator then we obtain four pole pieces . if we perform the calculations corresponding to one of them ( for example the first one which involves @xmath118 term ) , then the calculations for the remaining three pole pieces may be done in the same manner , except that @xmath119 is replaced by one of @xmath120 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "so , in what follows we continue the computations in detail only for one pole piece .",
    "now , the integration over @xmath90 is achieved by means of the device ( 5.9 ) and gives @xmath123 similarly , the @xmath27 integration can be done and yields @xmath124    so , we find that we must solve the following integral @xmath125 it turns out to be more convenient to integrate over @xmath93 then afterwards over @xmath126 .",
    "hence , first of all , we need to evaluate @xmath127 the above integral may be solved by closing the contours in the upper or lower half - plane in order to become free of all extra poles except @xmath128 .",
    "therefore , after some manipulation we obtain @xmath129    next , we need to calculate the integration over @xmath126 . in order to calculate the loop momentum",
    "@xmath126 integral , we will have different kinds of integrals however , all of them can be solved similarly . for example , consider the integral @xmath130 let us close the contour in the upper half - plane and due to the branch cut which extends from @xmath131 to infinity along the imaginary axis , the contour has to turn around the cut line .",
    "therefore , the integral ( 7.11 ) reduces to @xmath132 and the above integral gives the following result @xmath133    now we can write down the solution of the @xmath126 integration as @xmath134 finally , regarding the type iii ( bulk - bulk ) contribution ( 7.5 ) , all that remains is to integrate over the momenta @xmath135 .",
    "this can be achieved by means of the contours in the upper half - plane and considering the pole at @xmath73 and ignoring all the other extra poles because their contributions will vanish when @xmath136 .",
    "hence , the relation ( 7.5 ) has the solution    @xmath137    notice that the above relation depends on the @xmath138 terms in a manner which is very inconvenient for a comparison with ghoshal s formula .",
    "fortunately , these terms will be cancelled by matching terms in the contribution corresponding to the type i ( bulk ) feynman diagram .",
    "this is one of the interesting results which may be found in this paper .",
    "so , the type iii ( bulk - bulk ) contribution takes the simple form    @xmath139",
    "in fact in the case of the type i feynman diagram , there are two possible configurations depending on the fact that whether the interaction vertex is located at the boundary or inside the bulk region . from now on we call these two configurations the type i ( boundary ) and the type i ( bulk ) respectively . considering the boundary four point coupling ( 3.17 ) and the associated combinatorial factor as well ,",
    "the contribution corresponding to the type i ( boundary ) diagram is described by @xmath140    let us find the appropriate form of the two - point green function which will be used many times throughout this and next sections .",
    "now by looking at the general form of the propagator ( 3.11 ) and considering the expansions of the classical reflection factor ( 3.20 ) and the function @xmath52 i.e. ( 3.18 ) as well , the required form of the two - point green function will be    @xmath141    so , in our problem the loop propagator takes the following form @xmath142 first of all it is necessary to perform a minimal subtraction in order to remove the divergence of the above integral .",
    "secondly , we have solved the integral in ref .",
    "@xcite up to the first order in @xmath143 .",
    "hence , what we need to do is to solve the part which is proportional to @xmath144 including four terms .",
    "indeed , three of them can be simply manipulated and because of this reason we solve the first one in detail which is given by @xmath145 or @xmath146    fortunately , we have already calculated these kinds of integrals in ref .",
    "@xcite except the last one which is ( apart from the coefficients ) @xmath147 the above integral can be converted to a complex one and regarding the branch cut , it reduces to @xmath148 and after some manipulation we obtain @xmath149    now using the above formula and the required formulae in ref .",
    "@xcite , we may find the following result @xmath150 finally after doing the necessary computations and simplifications in connection with ( 8.3 ) , we obtain the loop propagator as @xmath151    let us consider the boundary contribution ( 8.1 ) .",
    "the integration over @xmath152 creates a dirac delta function which means we must set @xmath153 . as before in previous sections , the remaining integral over the momenta @xmath107 and @xmath108 can be achieved by closing the contours in the upper half - plane and taking into account the pole at @xmath154 .",
    "note , all the other poles will give damped contributions in the asymptotic region @xmath155 .",
    "so , the type i ( boundary ) contribution is @xmath156",
    "now let us evaluate the contribution of the type i ( bulk ) feynman diagram to the classical reflection factor when the interaction vertex is placed inside the bulk region .",
    "it is clear that in this case we have to consider the bulk four point coupling ( 3.15 ) in the interaction vertex however , the related combinatorial factor is the same as the boundary case .",
    "the corresponding contribution may be written as @xmath157    as it was shown in the previous section , the loop propagator is given by @xmath158 the above integral is logarithmically divergent .",
    "nevertheless , the divergence of the loop integral can be removed by performing a minimal subtraction . moreover , doing the integration over @xmath87 then , we obtain @xmath159    now regarding the bulk contribution ( 9.1 ) , the next step is to set @xmath115 in the first term of the first propagator . secondly , the integration over @xmath152 leads to the fact that the energy variables of the first and the third propagators are equal .",
    "hence , the type i ( bulk ) contribution takes the following form : @xmath160 the integration over @xmath161 may be performed by the formula ( 5.9 ) and therefore , ( 9.4 ) converts to @xmath162 meanwhile , there is another term which is the remaining part of the contribution i.e. : @xmath163    next , we need to integrate over @xmath93 however , the corresponding calculations are tedious .",
    "we will discover two important facts during the computations .",
    "firstly , all the terms involving the following kind of integral @xmath164 which is proportional to @xmath17 ( after doing the integrations over @xmath107 and @xmath108 and using the fact that @xmath165 ) will be cancelled .",
    "this is consistent for a comparison with ghoshal s formula .",
    "secondly , there are many other terms which contain this type of integral @xmath166 and all of them ( after assembling ) will be canceled with the counterpart terms in the type iii ( bulk - bulk ) feynman diagram as we mentioned in section seven .",
    "this result is also compatible with ghoshal s formula .",
    "meanwhile , further simplification can be made by using the values of @xmath107 and @xmath108 given by their poles and simplifying the integrand .",
    "so the type i ( bulk ) feynman diagram has the following contribution @xmath167",
    "ghoshal s formula ( 2.8 ) for the sinh - gordon quantum reflection factor up to one loop order is given by : @xmath168 where @xmath169 in calculating ( 10.2 ) we have made use of the expansions of @xmath23 and @xmath24 to @xmath170 : @xmath171 where @xmath172 since @xmath173 , we find that @xmath174 hence , expanding to @xmath175 , we obtain @xmath176 where @xcite @xmath177 and @xmath178 is proportional to @xmath143 .    on the other hand , the relative correction to the classical reflection factor @xmath42 is given by ( using ( 3.20 ) ) @xmath179 in fact , the corrections to @xmath180 and @xmath181 have been calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite , respectively .",
    "clearly , all the contributions that have been obtained in this paper are involved in the correction to @xmath182 i.e. @xmath183 .",
    "it is seen that the functional form of the second order quantum corrections to the classical reflection factor corresponding to the type i and type iii feynman diagrams are consistent with ghoshal s formula .",
    "in this paper we studied the sinh - gordon model restricted to a half - line by boundary conditions which are compatible with integrability .",
    "we calculated the second order quantum corrections to the classical reflection factor of the model .",
    "the principal purpose of the perturbative calculation is to test the quantum reflection factor of the sinh - gordon particle given by ghoshal up to the second order in the difference of the two boundary parameters .",
    "in fact , ghoshal found the general form of the quantum reflection factor of the sinh - gordon model . however ,",
    "apart from two special cases ( neumann and dirichlet boundary conditions ) ghoshal s formula could not provide a complete relationship between the reflection factor and the boundary data . as we mentioned before , on the basis of a perturbative calculation , the relationship between the various parameters was conjectured to be @xcite    @xmath184    corrigan et.al @xcite tried to give further support for these formulae .",
    "they used two different technique i.e. the boundary bootstrap method and the wkb semi - classical approximation approach .",
    "their non - perturbative calculations have been performed for the complicated case of the general boundary conditions in which the bulk symmetry is violated .",
    "alternatively , the conjecture ( 11.1 ) may be checked on the basis of perturbative calculations up to the second order .",
    "it is understood that this paper provides most part of the collection of ingredients one need .",
    "the computations associated with the type ii feynman diagram have not been performed in this article .",
    "in fact , in this diagram the middle momenta will be related to each other in an intricate manner due to the double green functions .",
    "nevertheless , it is expected that the same procedure will be applicable to the remaining diagram as well . moreover",
    ", many formulae of this paper will be helpful .",
    "all the affine toda field theories whose corresponding lie algebras are simply laced or non - simply laced algebras have known exact quantum s - matrices . however , in the presence of a boundary the boundary s - matrices or the reflection factors of the theories are largely unknown . in other words ,",
