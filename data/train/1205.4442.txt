    "this means that their difference vanishes at @xmath0 , @xmath28 and @xmath2 , and is harmonic as well .",
    "then the maximum principle guarantees that it is identically equal to zero .",
    "this allows us to define @xmath60 on @xmath78 , and the above calculation gives us an explicit recurrence relation to compute it in any point .",

    "however , they have a drawback : it is difficult to study one of this functions independently from others , because forces us to change the values of @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "this leads us to introduce the function @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is the canonical basis of @xmath103 .",

    "( if @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 are real , it is simply the linear form with matrix @xmath107 . )",

    "thus we see that the function @xmath29 that we have defined in the beginning is just a shorter notation ( that we shall adopt from now on ) for @xmath101 .",
    "its existence and unicity follow from the proof of proposition - definition [ definition of fabc ] .",
    "note that all that we shall say in this section can very easily be generalized to all of @xmath55 , that is to @xmath108 . to do this",
    ", it is enough to introduce the matrix @xmath109 , analogous to @xmath110 and @xmath111 , and to see that a generic point of @xmath55 can be described by an infinite sequence of symbols @xmath0 , @xmath28 or @xmath2 , by analogy with the binary expansion .    we will need to diagonalise the @xmath112 .",
    "any of these matrices has eigenvalues @xmath28 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 , with respective eigenvectors @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 , where : @xmath118    note that @xmath119 which shows that our picture is in fact only two - dimensionnal : all the values of @xmath108 , hence also all the values of @xmath29 , actually lie in the affine plane @xmath120 of course , it is stable by the maps @xmath112 , and the latter induce some affine maps on the former ( see figure [ fig : mi ] ) .",
    "in fact , this is why we have chosen to write @xmath115 instead of @xmath121 : the @xmath115 are elements of the affine plane @xmath122 , namely  under this interpretation  fixed points of the affine maps @xmath112 .    ; the plane of the sheet of paper corresponds to the affine plane @xmath122 .",
    "thus the origin of @xmath103 lies beneath the centre of the figure .",
    "the triangle @xmath123 is defined a little bit further ; it is added here to better illustrate the action of the @xmath112 on @xmath122 . ]",
    "let us now try to write down an explicit formula for @xmath124 .",
    "we first need to express @xmath27 in terms of @xmath0 , of @xmath28 and of the @xmath125 , which may be done by writing : @xmath126 where @xmath127 is a ( lower or upper ) binary expansion of @xmath27 . using the above relations , we get the following :    [ u general formula ] let @xmath128 be the ( full ) triangle with the canonical coordinate vectors as vertices . then for all @xmath129 $ ] and for any initial value @xmath130 , we have @xmath131 where @xmath132 is its ( lower or upper ) binary expansion .",

    "let us first rewrite this formula in such a way as to make it clear that the result does not depend on the initial value .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath123 is stable by both @xmath110 and @xmath111 : thus the sequence @xmath133 is decreasing . in the proof of proposition - definition [ definition of fabc ]",

    "it is clear that they are closed .",
    "thus their intersection contains a single point : @xmath134 on the other hand , a trivial induction shows that for any finite word @xmath135 on the alphabet @xmath136 , @xmath137 , where @xmath138 is seen as a binary fraction , and that @xmath139 .",

    "then the following statements are equivalent ( remember that the @xmath112 are bijective ) : @xmath147 on the last line , each side is a subset of the respective @xmath148 .",
    "but a quick calculation ( or a quick look at figure [ fig : ut ] ) shows that the two images of the triangle intersect at a single point : @xmath149 thus the previous equality holds if and only if @xmath150 which is true if and only if for all @xmath151 , @xmath152 and @xmath153 . in other words ,",

    "that lemma [ reduction to periodic case ] is interesting in itself , even outside the case @xmath336 : it shows that changing a finite number of bits in the binary expansion of @xmath27 does not change its hlder exponent . for completeness sake ,",

    "this means that @xmath364 is positively bounded in norm , so that it takes values in a compact space .",
    "hence from @xmath354 we can extract yet another subsequence , that we shall call @xmath365 , such that @xmath366 converges ; let us call @xmath367 its limit .",
    "note that , though we used a particular value of @xmath350 to prove that this construction was possible , the actual objects that we have constructed do not depend on it .",

    "the claim can then be reformulated as follows : there exists some linear form @xmath238 such that the ratio @xmath374 is constant .",
    "the interval @xmath375 contains infinitely many dyadic rational points ; by corollary [ properties of du ] , we may find in this interval a dyadic rational value @xmath376 such that @xmath377 .",
    "but example [ dyadic rational ] together with lemma [ link between u and uacb ] tell us that in this case , @xmath378 as a function of @xmath85 has an infinite derivative in @xmath376 .",

    "hence @xmath383 , and @xmath384 .",

    "let @xmath238 be a linear form whose kernel does not meet @xmath161 ; then from corollary [ properties of du ] , it is easy to deduce that the function @xmath389 is monotonic .",
    "but it is a well - known result ( see for example @xcite , theorem 8.19 ) that a monotonic function is differentiable ( in its usual sense of `` has a finite derivative '' ) almost everywhere .",
    "since by lemma [ link between u and uacb ] , @xmath389 behaves in the same way as @xmath29 itself , the result follows .",
    "when we look at this table , it becomes apparent that globally , numbers whose binary expansions contain long clusters of equal consecutive bits tend to have smaller hlder exponents , while those whose binary expansions are more `` mixed '' tend to have bigger hlder exponents .",
    "the exponent is lowest when the binary expansion ends in an unbroken string of zeroes or ones ( that is , for dyadic rational numbers  see below ) , and seems highest when zeroes and ones strictly alternate ( that is , for @xmath390 and its dyadic - rational multiples ; the author does not know how to prove this ) .",
    "the author was able to prove the following statement , that partly confirms this intuition :      informally , @xmath393 and @xmath394 give bounds for the asymptotic proportion of places where the bit changes value ; the latter can also be understood as the reciprocal of the asymptotic average length of blocs of consecutive equal bits .",
    "let us first express @xmath161 in the bases that diagonalise @xmath159 .",
