    "disk gravity acts on the stars and slightly affects the binary orbit . in post",

    "are taken from the radial bin centered on radius @xmath53 .",
    "this is similar to the method used in papers i and ii , except now we average the properties over one binary orbit to smooth out the fluctuations on the binary orbital timescale .",
    "note that the initial disk eccentricity is non - zero ( @xmath54 ) in the upper row , even though the disk is initially set up to be circular .",
    "this non - zero eccentricity value is a consequence of the way we calculate the particle eccentricity and inclination ( equations [ 7 ] and [ 8 ] in paper ii ) that treats particles as ballistic , i.e. , assuming particles only feel the gravitational force of the central object , whereas particles actually are also influenced by the disk pressure force .",
    "therefore , the non - zero initial disk eccentricities we see here are purely an artifact of our ignoring the disk pressure in the orbital elements calculation .",
    "the effect is more prominent here than in the simulations shown in papers i and ii because here the disk has higher temperature , @xmath22 ( compared with @xmath55 ) .",
    "however , it is still small enough not to affect our general interpretation , since we are focused on the major changes of the disk properties during kl oscillations .",
    "as seen in the left column of figure [ fig : fig1 ] , where disk self - gravity is not included , increasing the disk mass does not significantly affect the disk orbital elements during the kl cycle .",
    "the period and amplitude of the oscillations are similar , although there is some variation in the time of the first peak .",
    "the difference in the onset of the initial kl cycle is due to the fact that disk mass slightly affects the companion s orbit .",
    "the timing of the onset is sensitive to the initial conditions .",
    "even with @xmath56 , the peak eccentricity value of @xmath57 is almost the same as that for the simulations with @xmath58 and @xmath59 with a peak @xmath60 .",
    "as seen in the right column of the figure , for the lower mass disks , self - gravity generally has little effect on disk eccentricity and inclination .",
    "however , the effects of the kl cycle are significantly reduced at the highest disk mass of @xmath61 , which has an initial disk minimum toomre q @xmath62 .",
    "the peak eccentricity in that case is @xmath63 compared to @xmath57 with @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the bottom row shows that by the end of the simulation at time @xmath64 , the disk in general has lost more than half of its initial mass .",
    "the majority of the lost mass is accreted on to the central object .",
    "a small fraction of the mass is ejected from the disk , mostly ending up around the companion binary star . comparing simulations with the same initial disk mass ,",
    "the run with self - gravity has more mass remaining at the end of the simulation than the one without self - gravity .",
    "this effect may be a consequence of the disk self - gravity helping to retain particles , and also reducing the particle loss at inner disk boundary , since the kl cycle is weakened .",

    "the middle and right panels are edge - on views after the disks have undergone nodal precession by @xmath66 .",
    "the middle panel is from the run without disk self - gravity ( the blue curves in the left column of figure [ fig : fig1 ] ) at a time of @xmath69 , while the right panel is from the run that includes disk self - gravity ( the blue curves in the right column of figure [ fig : fig1 ] ) at a time of @xmath70 .",
    "these runs have different disk nodal precession rates and as a result the middle and right panels are shown at slightly different epochs . without self - gravity ,",
    "the middle panel shows a substantially lopsided disk due to the kl - driven eccentricity growth . in the right panel , with disk self - gravity , the disk is still eccentric , but not as eccentric as in the middle panel .",
    "although at an earlier time ( @xmath71 ) the disk has a slightly higher eccentricity , the average disk eccentricity is clearly lower when self - gravity is included ( see comparison of the blue curves in the top two panels of figure [ fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "the main point here is that in both panels , the disk remains fairly flat ( no significant warping ) due to the efficient radial communication ( provided mainly by pressure in these cases ; see discussions in paper ii ) .",
    "figure [ fig : fig3 ] is similar to figure [ fig : fig1 ] except for a different disk aspect ratio , @xmath24 , and viscosity , @xmath72 .",
    "when disk self - gravity is not included , we see again that the disk mass has only a minor effect on the disk kl cycle ( left column ) .",
    "the oscillation timescales and amplitudes are similar .",
    "as we discussed in figure [ fig : fig1 ] , the reason why the disk mass plays a role in the absence of self - gravity is that the disk mass slightly affects the orbit of the companion , which in turn affects the onset of the disk kl cycle . with self - gravity",
    "included , we see a greater suppression of the disk kl cycle by self - gravity than that in figure [ fig : fig1 ] . with @xmath56 ,",
    "the kl mechanism barely operates . for the disk mass of @xmath73",
    ", there is a significant reduction .",
    "the lowest mass disk remains relatively unaffected by self - gravity .",
    "note that for the highest disk mass , the initial disk has a minimum toomre q @xmath74 , which puts the disk on the verge of becoming gravitationally unstable to non - axisymmetric disturbances . in this paper , we have restricted our attention to simulations in which we do not see any sign of gravitational instability , such as fragmentation or clump formation .",

    "self - gravity introduces a source of disk apsidal precession , in addition to that due to the binary companion that causes the kl oscillations .",
    "if the self - gravity induced apsidal disk precession rate is faster than the binary induced precession rate , then the disk kl cycle can be suppressed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we estimate the magnitude of the local self - gravity induced disk apsidal precession rate @xmath75 from equation ( 1 ) of @xcite , which is consistent with the rate given in @xcite . we determine the binary companion induced disk local precession rate @xmath76 by approximating the companion s potential as arising from a uniform ring of mass @xmath6 and radius @xmath19 , where @xmath77 is binary separation .",
    "since the disk maintains its coherence , its global precession rate is crudely estimated as the angular - momentum - weighted average of the local rates ( see equation ( 9 ) of paper ii ) .",
    "for the equal mass binary system we consider , we take @xmath78 , @xmath79 ( due to disk expansion from the initial @xmath80 ) .",
    "the global disk precession rate caused by a binary companion is @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the binary orbital frequency .",
    "this precession rate is similar in value to the nodal precession rate implied by figure [ fig : fig2 ] that shows that the disks undergo half the nodal precession period at a time of about @xmath83 .",
    "the global disk precession rate due to self - gravity is @xmath84 .",
    "requiring @xmath85 provides an estimate of the minimum disk mass to suppress kl oscillations as @xmath86 . according to figure 7 of @xcite , the critical disk mass for suppressing kl oscillations is generally somewhat larger than this value , depending on the disk inclination .",
    "based on that work , for the initial disk inclination we have used , the estimated disk mass for kl suppression is about a factor of 5 times larger , that is @xmath87 .    in the case of @xmath22 , the blue curve in the right column of figure [ fig : fig1 ]",
    "clearly shows that the disk kl cycle is weakened for the case of an initial disk mass of @xmath88 . in spite of the reduced oscillation amplitude , the disk still undergoes kl cycles .",
    "there is an eccentricity peak and inclination valley at a time @xmath89 when the disk has a mass of about @xmath90 which we adopt as a crude estimate for the minimum mass for kl suppression . in the case of @xmath24 , the blue curve in the right column of figure [ fig : fig3 ]",
    "shows that the kl cycle is suppressed , for the case of an initial disk mass of @xmath91 . in the case of the lower initial disk mass of @xmath30 , the kl oscillation appears to be present , but weakened .",
    "a reasonable estimate of the critical disk mass suppression of kl oscillations is similar to our estimate for the other disk model , @xmath92 .",
    "therefore , the simulations show that the critical disk mass for suppressing kl oscillations is in the range of @xmath93 ( 4% of the mass of the central star ) that is about a factor of 5 larger than the value based on equating the self - gravity induced precession rate with the binary induced precession rate .",
    "it is in agreement with the value implied by @xcite that is discussed above .",
    "papers i and ii showed that global disk kl oscillations damp . after damping , the disk inclination is at or below critical kl angle . if a planet forms after this stage , then its initial orbital tilt is not large enough to trigger the kl mechanism .",
    "this reduced tilt poses a challenge to the kl model of planets which assumes initially highly inclined planet orbits .",
    "the tilt evolution of such planet  disk configurations requires further study .",
    "suppression of the kl cycle by means of self - gravity requires substantial disk masses . at the critical disk mass we found ,",
    "the disk is quite close to being gravitationally unstable . in other words ,",
    "we find a relatively narrow window of disk masses where the disk kl oscillation is significantly subdued , while the disk is still stable to gravitational instability .",
    "the highest initial disk mass we consider in this paper , @xmath56 , shows more warping with self  gravity included than in cases without self  gravity .",
    "initially , the inclination of the inner parts of the disk increases , while that of the outer parts decreases . in paper ii",
    ", we found that the critical ( minimum ) tilt angle for kl oscillations to operate in a disk is about @xmath3 , somewhat higher than the critical angle for free particles ( @xmath94 ) . in this paper , we have limited our analysis to an initial disk tilt of @xmath95 that is just @xmath96 above the minimum value for kl oscillations .",
    "such initial conditions produce much more moderate kl effects on a disk than occurs at higher tilt angles .",
    "we also reported in paper ii that strong density enhancements are found during kl oscillations of a non - self - gravitating disk with a larger initial tilt .",
    "these density enhancements appear to involve shocks . with larger initial tilts than we have considered here ,",
    "a self - gravitating disk that undergoes kl oscillations may undergo disk fragmentation .",
    "fragmentation of a disk is a possible mechanism for planet formation and may be aided by binary perturbations @xcite .",
    "the disk kl cycle may then provide an alternative means by which a binary companion can promote disk fragmentation / clumping .",
    "such effects should be explored in the future .",
