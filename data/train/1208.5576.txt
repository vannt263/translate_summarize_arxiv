    "the influence of intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution ( ivr ) on the control of quantum dynamics has been a subject of some debate ever since the first lasers gave hope to the dream of doing mode - specific chemistry@xcite .",
    "in fact , arguing that the energy flow process is typically faster than the reaction timescales@xcite and essentially statistical , researchers identified ivr as the main culprit which spoils the idea of mode - specific control@xcite . consequently , most of the quantum control methods shifted their focus away from explicitly controlling or beating the ivr process . instead , the various control strategies @xcite concentrated on manipulating the quantum interferences , for which a prior knowledge of the field - free ivr mechanism is supposedly not required .",
    "the observations above , however , need to be reappraised in light of the recent developments in our understanding of ivr . both experimental@xcite and theoretical@xcite studies",
    "indicate that ivr at intermediate times is nonstatistical even in moderately sized molecules . specifically , from a molecular state - space perspective@xcite , ivr is anisotropic with local , as opposed to global , density of states playing a crucial role and significant deviations from the fermi golden rule regime in the form of power law decays are to be expected@xcite .",
    "these studies certainly give rise to new hopes for controlling the ivr process itself and there has been some promising work@xcite in this direction .",
    "however , in light of the recent advances , there is also a case to be made for reopening the old debate - can mechanistic insights into the energy flow dynamics lead to better control strategies ?",
    "it is not entirely unreasonable to expect that a subtle interplay between the ivr dynamics and the controlling field must occur in many of the quantum control studies@xcite .",
    "hence , is it possible to envisage situations wherein ivr might actually aid , rather than thwart , the control process ?",
    "an interesting  inverse \" question can be asked at this stage .",
    "what features of a control field , as obtained through optimal@xcite control theory , are a direct consequence of the ivr dynamics ? there is a striking parallel here to the more contemporary issue of the search for decoherence - free subspaces in quantum control of open systems@xcite . a mechanistic understanding of the interplay between decoherence and control of a system is proving to be invaluable in a wide range of areas .",
    "therefore , although answering the inverse question posed above is far from easy , one hopes that a careful study of model systems can lead to a finer understanding of the role of ivr in quantum control of molecular processes .    in order to uncover the mechanism and influence of ivr on quantum control",
    "one can adopt a purely quantum , purely classical , or a semiclassical approach . however , there is little doubt that detailed insights come from studying and comparing all of the approaches . in particular , although quantum studies of fairly high dimensional systems are now possible , a key reason for taking the classical - quantum correspondence perspective has to do with the fact that classical dynamics provides the correct baseline to gauge the extent to which quantum effects like interference and tunneling are important for control .",
    "such a classical - quantum correspondence perspective has proved useful not only in the context of ivr and control but also in many other areas like driven atomic systems@xcite , mesoscopic systems@xcite and trapped cold atoms@xcite .",
    "various studies on systems with two or fewer degrees of freedom ( @xmath0 ) have led to the identification of key phase space structures that regulate ivr and , more importantly , their quantum fingerprints .",
    "thus , the role of chaos , kolmogorov - arnold - moser ( kam ) barriers , partial barriers like broken separatrices@xcite and cantori@xcite , and phase space bifurcations@xcite have been extensively studied@xcite",
    ".    nevertheless , there are two major obstacles in extending the correspondence approach to systems with more than two degrees of freedom .",
    "the first obstacle is the difficulty in visualizing the global dynamics in high dimensional phase spaces .",
    "the second obstacle has to do with the fact that the nature of phase space transport changes dramatically in going from two to three degrees of freedom .",
    "for example , kam tori are no longer true barriers in the phase space and there are no obvious generalizations of the notion of cantori in @xmath1 .",
    "in addition , hamiltonian systems typically exhibit  stickiness\"@xcite _",
    "i.e. , _ classically chaotic trajectories spending significant amount of time near regular structures or their remnants in the classical phase space .",
    "stickiness leads to long time dynamical correlations and is key to understanding the nature of phase space transport .",
    "important insights into the universality of stickiness in hamiltonian systems are starting to emerge@xcite but their quantum manifestations , if any , are mostly unexplored .",
    "these obstacles , technical as well as conceptual , have been largely responsible for a waning of interest among researchers in studying and utilizing the insights afforded by a classical - quantum correspondence approach .    in the last few years , however , there has been a rapid progress in our ability to investigate phase space transport in such high dimensional systems .",
    "partly , this has to do with the recent exciting work@xcite in transition state theory - construction of locally recrossing free dividing surfaces in phase space and dynamics near saddles on potential surfaces for @xmath1 systems . in turn",
    ", such studies have led to researchers extending the concept of a transition state for driven systems@xcite with obvious relevance to quantum control .",
    "on the other hand , attempts are also being made@xcite to connect the nature of global phase space transport with the structure of the nonlinear resonance networks , also known as the arnold web .",
    "in particular , the arnold web is central for a classical description of the ivr dynamics .",
    "although a precise correspondence between the classical dynamics on the arnold web and the quantum dynamics in the molecular state space is lacking , there is sufficient reason to expect that the classical insights will prove crucial in unearthing the mechanisms of ivr in a molecule .",
    "will the classical insights also help in controlling the intramolecular energy flow itself or quantum control of processes influenced by ivr ? at present",
    "this question remains unanswered .",
    "these recent advances combined with some of the early pioneering work collectively motivate the present study , which is a first step in answering the question posed above .    in this work",
    "we take a minimal model of two kinetically coupled morse oscillators , describing two local modes , driven by a monochromatic field to understand the interplay of ivr and control in molecular dissociation dynamics . more specifically",
    ", we consider parameters appropriate for the hcn ( hydrogen cyanide ) molecule .",
    "hcn has been a benchmark `` small '' molecular system for several quantum control studies@xcite whose primary , and rather challenging , aim is to dissociate the stronger c@xmath2n bond while keeping the weaker c@xmath3h mode `` quiet '' .",
    "however , in the current study we do not attempt the selective breaking of the c@xmath2n bond and instead study the c@xmath3h bond dissociation .",
    "the focus here , in this @xmath4 degrees of freedom system , is on identifying the main classical phase space structures that regulate the dissociation dynamics . in sec .",
    "[ modham ] we give a brief description of the model hamiltonian .",
    "the details of the construction of the arnold web are discussed in sec .",
    "[ arweb ] and the important features in phase space are identified .",
    "interestingly , it is observed that the crucial regions in the web correspond to classical phase space structures with highly irrational frequency ratios .",
    "these results are reminiscent of the early work by martens , davis , and ezra@xcite wherein the importance of pairwise noble barriers to ivr in the ocs molecule ( @xmath5 ) was highlighted . in sec .",
    "[ hubsrole ] we study the role of two important regions (  hubs \" ) in the resonance network .",
    "one of them , the  dissociation hub \" , acts as a gateway for dissociating trajectories and possibly of some interest in the context of transition state theory . in the other hub ,",
    "the  noble hub \" , we establish the extensive stickiness of the dynamics with significant implications for transport in the phase space . section  [ conclusions ] concludes .",
    "we consider two kinetically coupled morse oscillators being driven by a monochromatic field .",
    "the corresponding classical hamiltonian , considered in an earlier work@xcite as well , is given by @xmath6 where the matter part of the hamiltonian is    [ full_ham ] @xmath7    and the matter - radiation interaction in the dipole limit is taken to be @xmath8 the form of the dipole function@xcite is given by the expression @xmath9 and the values of the various parameters can be found in the earlier work@xcite .    as indicated in eqn .",
    "[ copmorse ] , the various parameters of @xmath10 are appropriate for the hcn molecule .",
    "thus , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are morse oscillator hamiltonians for the anharmonic vibrational displacements of the c@xmath3h ( @xmath13 ) and c@xmath2n ( @xmath14 ) bonds respectively with @xmath15 being the equilibrium bond length of the ch mode .",
    "the reduced masses of the ch and the cn modes are denoted by @xmath16 and @xmath17 respectively and @xmath18 denotes the mass of the carbon atom .",
    "note that the number of bound states of the ch and the cn oscillators are about @xmath19 and @xmath20 respectively for the given parameters .",
    "the vibrational local modes are directly coupled to each other via the kinetic coupling @xmath21 and is responsible for ivr in the system . in addition , an indirect coupling is also present between the two modes due to the interaction with the laser field via @xmath22 .    throughout this work",
    "the various parameters corresponding to the morse oscillators and the driving field are all in atomic units . the driving field strength @xmath23 ( @xmath24 tw/@xmath25 ) and frequency @xmath26 ( @xmath27 fs@xmath28 ) are chosen to avoid any significant excitation of cn bond , since we are interested in studying the effect of driving field only on the ch mode .    a few comments on the choice of the model hamiltonian and the form of the matter - field coupling is appropriate at this stage .",
    "firstly , the form of @xmath10 has a long history in chemical physics starting with the beautiful work by thiele and wilson@xcite and the extensive studies by oxtoby and rice@xcite on the connection between nonlinear resonance overlaps and ivr .",
    "this choice is simple enough to use the analytically known action - angle variables for a morse oscillator but has the basic features of interest to us - ivr , bifurcations , and a mixed regular - chaotic phase space .",
    "secondly , as mentioned in the introduction , our goal here is to mechanistically understand the role of ivr in regulating the dissociation dynamics and identify the key phase space structures . in this initial study , therefore , we choose to avoid complications from other competing processes that may hinder a clear interpretation .",
    "thus , we choose a simple monochromatic form for the driving field and it is important to note that this model already has a five - dimensional phase space . for the same reason we choose to couple only the ch mode to the field .",
    "for the weak driving fields ( the ionization threshold for hcn is around @xmath29 tw/@xmath25 ) and the specific initial states considered here ( see next section ) this is reasonable .",
    "moreover , even upon coupling the cn mode to the field , our study indicates no significant change in the qualitative nature of the phase space structures discussed later .",
    "this minimal model , therefore , has the basic ingredients _",
    "i.e. , _ ivr , a field attempting to dissociate a bond , and an essential degree of dynamical complexity .",
    "in addition , such a model represents the next level of difficulty in extending the insights gained from studies on one dimensional driven morse oscillator system@xcite to systems with higher degrees of freedom .",
    "note that the parameters are representative of hcn but the model is still a reduced dimensional one since the bending mode is not taken into account .",
    "it is known from a recent work@xcite that the bend mode is important to the dissociation dynamics .",
    "however , understanding the phase space transport in the current reduced dimensional model is a prerequisite for attempting the more challenging case of including all three modes of the molecule .          in order to motivate the current study and connect to the discussion in the introduction we start by investigating the dissociation dynamics of the zeroth order state @xmath30 .",
    "this specific choice of state has to do with the fact that in the absence of laser field the classical phase space exhibits several interesting structures at the corresponding zeroth - order energy .",
    "indeed , the poincar surface of section shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) exhibits mixed regular - chaotic regions with prominent @xmath31:@xmath32 and @xmath33:@xmath34 nonlinear resonances interspersed in the chaotic sea .",
    "in addition , the husimi distribution@xcite of @xmath35 superimposed on the surface of section in fig .  [ fig1](a ) shows that the state is mostly localized in the @xmath31:@xmath32 resonance region in the phase space . note that @xmath36 is not an eigenstate of the matter hamiltonian @xmath10 and",
    "thus the husimi distribution does spread across the border between the main 1@xmath371 island and the chaotic sea . for this typical @xmath38 kam system",
    ", the regular - chaos border has a hierarchical structure which is expected to result in sticky dynamics .",
    "in particular , a very high order resonance island is visible in the border region in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) which suggests the existence of cantori in the phase space . such barriers ,",
    "partial or otherwise , limit the extent of classical ivr in the system . specifically , in the undriven subsystem @xmath39 , an analysis along the lines of the earlier work@xcite by oxtoby and rice reveals that the overlap of low order resonance zones is not extensive enough at the energy of interest to result in dissociation .",
    "thus , ivr alone is incapable of dissociating the ch bond .",
    "this is confirmed in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) where the classical dissociation probability is zero for the entire time duration of interest .",
    "we stress at this juncture that any other initial state is equally a good choice as long as the generic criteria of a mixed phase space and partially localized husimi distribution are satisfied . for instance",
    "other states such as @xmath40 and @xmath41 yield similar qualitative insights as the one chosen here .",
    "we now introduce the driving field with parameters mentioned above and note that @xmath42 is chosen so as to be off - resonant with respect to the zeroth order state of interest . to begin , we decouple the ch and cn modes by turning off the kinetic coupling term @xmath21 in eq .",
    "[ cop ] and drive the ch mode .",
    "classical trajectories are propagated by integrating the hamilton s equations of motion up to a final time @xmath43 with @xmath44 fs being the field period .",
    "trajectories are considered@xcite to be dissociated if the displacement of the bond of interest exceeds a certain threshold , set here to be @xmath45 a.u . for the ch bond dissociation . for the chosen driving field strength it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) that again there is negligible dissociation of the ch bond@xcite .",
    "hence , the mode - mode coupling _ i.e. , _ ivr in the absence of the field or the field in the absence of ivr are incapable of dissociating the ch bond . however , and this is the key observation , the weak driving field with nonzero mode - mode coupling does lead to large dissociation probability , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) ( triangles ) and poses an interesting question . what is the precise mechanism , undoubtedly involving a subtle interplay between ivr and the driving field , by which the initial state @xmath36 undergoes dissociation ? in the following section we construct the arnold web@xcite and attempt to answer the question from the perspective of transport in the classical phase space .",
    "the example summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] motivates us to understand the phase space transport in the system of interest . however , the phase space in this case is five dimensional and not easily visualized . on the other hand , recent studies on ivr from time dependent perspective@xcite",
    "have established the importance of the resonance network or arnold web _ i.e. , _ the various resonances and their disposition in the phase space .",
    "therefore , following the dynamics of an initial state on the resonance network should reveal the dominant frequency lockings experienced by the state as a function of time .",
    "consequently , one can obtain valuable information regarding the local structures in the phase space which regulate the dissociation dynamics in the presence of laser field .",
    "our interest here is to test if such an approach would indeed provide the mechanistic insights .    to begin with one needs to construct the arnold web and then interpret the dynamics of the system .",
    "the implementation aspect has been dealt with by several studies over the last decade or so . starting with the early pioneering work by martens , davis , and",
    "ezra@xcite on the use of windowed fourier - transforms and a little later by laskar@xcite , several methods like fast lyapunov indicators@xcite , mean exponential growth of nearby orbits@xcite , and frequency modulation indicator@xcite have been proposed . however , the interpretation of the classical dynamics is not so straightforward for nonintegrable systems for reasons mentioned in the introduction . in the next subsection",
    "we utilize a wavelet based technique , proposed by arevalo and wiggins@xcite , to construct the resonance network for the system of interest .",
    "subsequently , we attempt to provide an interpretation of the dynamics based on the network and highlight the role of ivr in presence of an external driving field .      since the exact action - angle variables @xmath46 for a morse oscillator",

    "a similar expression for the cn oscillator can be written down .",
    "the general resonance condition involving the two oscillators and the driving field frequency can be expressed as @xmath49 with @xmath50 being a set of mutually prime integers .",
    "the order of a given resonance is @xmath51 and the set of all resonances up to a given order forms the arnold web at that order .",
    "figure  [ fig1p ] shows the web of resonances up to a total order of five .",
    "pure mode - mode ( binary , @xmath52 ) resonances appear on the web as lines with positive slopes and do not involve the field .",
    "in contrast , ternary resonances ( @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) involve both the modes and the field and appear as lines with negative slopes .",
    "intersection of the binary and ternary resonances result in mode - field resonances ( vertical and horizontal lines ) and such intersections form resonance junctions . some of the resonance junctions , for example at @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 in fig .",
    "[ fig1p ] are clearly visible .",
    "the resonance junctions are expected to be important for the phase space transport .",
    "however , such a `` static '' construction can not _ a priori _ highlight the dynamically significant regions of the web except in the limit of small perturbations@xcite .",
    "the system of interest here is certainly far from near - integrability ( cf .",

    "[ wavelet ] yields the frequency content of @xmath68 over a time window around @xmath69 .",
    "typically , for an integrable or regular motion there is a single dominant frequency characterizing the phase space structure over the entire time .",

    "it is important to take into consideration all the frequency components of the time evolved classical trajectories .",

    "the frequency ratio space is divided into cells and the number of times that a cell is visited by all the trajectories is presented as a density plot .",
    "we further normalize the highest density to one for convenience .",
    "for the sake of clarity the resulting network is shown on a logarithmic scale in order to highlight the significant regions .      the resulting density plot for the state @xmath35 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] in the frequency ratio space @xmath74 . comparing this dynamical frequency ratio space to the static construction shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1p ] reveals several crucial aspects of the dissociation dynamics .",
    "first and foremost , the heterogeneous nature of the dynamical frequency ratio space indicates that the phase space dynamics is nonuniform .",
    "thus , there exist dynamically significant regions in the phase space which , based on the earlier work@xcite by shojiguchi _",
    "_ on a different model system , are expected to strongly influence the dissociation dynamics .",
    "it is worth mentioning that several regions of the static web are not dynamically relevant for the specific initial state and timescale of interest .",
    "similar observations have been made@xcite earlier in the context of coupled standard maps .",
    "secondly , a relatively narrow region of the frequency ratio space around @xmath75 corresponds to the dissociation of the ch mode ( characterized by low values of @xmath76 ) .",
    "thirdly , a careful look at the web in fig .  [ fig2 ] indicates the presence of three distinct regions in the phase space and below we focus on the nature of these regions .",
    "the first prominent region in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] corresponds to the @xmath77 nonlinear resonance .",
    "note that the husimi distribution of @xmath35 in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) does exhibit substantial localization in the large @xmath32:@xmath32 island .",
    "however , the enhanced density observed in fig .  [ fig2 ] is nontrivial since the invariant tori associated with the @xmath32:@xmath32 resonance are no longer true barriers in presence of the driving . as seen later",
    ", the classical trajectories do leave the resonance zone but repeatedly get captured into the resonance with large residence times .",
    "consequently , the enhanced density near the @xmath32:@xmath32 resonance has serious implications for the nature of the phase space transport .",
    "a second important region of the frequency ratio space is marked as `` nh '' ( noble hub ) in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] with most of the activity occurring around a hub consisting of several mode - mode irrational ( noble ) frequency ratios and high - order resonances .",
    "the noble numbers are highly irrational numbers of the form @xmath78 with @xmath79 and @xmath80 being the golden ratio .",
    "high density around @xmath81 resonance and the noble hub indicates continuous interaction between ch and cn modes via ivr that seems to regulate the dissociation dynamics of the ch bond in the presence of the driving laser field .",
    "an equally important region of the frequency ratio space , marked as `` dh '' ( dissociation hub ) in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , is in the vicinity of the @xmath82 irrational ratio .",
    "interestingly , the narrow dissociation zone mentioned above lies mainly to the left of this dh region .",
    "the enhanced density at the nh and dh hubs suggests an intriguing possibility - regions with pairwise noble frequency ratios seem to be acting as barriers to transport in higher degrees of freedom systems . at this stage",
    ", it is worth recalling an earlier classic study by martens , davis and ezra@xcite on the ocs molecule wherein it was conjectured that pairwise noble barriers in phase space might play a crucial role in the dynamics of systems with more than two degrees of freedom .",
    "a recent detailed study@xcite by paskauskas , chandre , and uzer clearly establishes that two - dimensional invariant tori can act as phase space bottlenecks to intramolecular energy flow in ocs .",
    "therefore , the observation of the dh and nh hubs in the current work lends further support to the notion that lower dimensional phase space structures may act as traps and barriers for the classical dynamics in systems with high degrees of freedom .",
    "we now turn to a closer analysis of the nature of these dynamically significant regions of the web .    , constructed via time - frequency analysis of an ensemble of @xmath83 trajectories propagated from @xmath84 to @xmath85 @xmath86 .",
    "note that the normalized density is plotted on the logarithmic scale in order to highlight the sparse yet key regions in the phase space .",

    "[ fig2 ] involves an ensemble of trajectories with constant actions but varying angles . in order to understand the role of the dh and nh hubs it is useful to distinguish between various dynamical classes of trajectories .",
    "specifically , the classification in terms of regular , chaotic but nondissociating , and chaotic dissociating trajectories can be obtained from the computed nonlinear frequencies .        in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) , a representative chaotic trajectory with a very large dissociation time is shown in the frequency ratio space .",
    "it is evident from the figure that the trajectory jumps between the important hubs and resonances in the web . however , interestingly , at a specific time the trajectory crosses the dh hub and promptly dissociates .",
    "we observed this to be a feature that is common to several such trajectories which dissociate over long timescales .",
    "in contrast , a rapidly dissociating chaotic trajectory shown in fig .  [ fig3](b ) , undergoes very different dynamics enroute to dissociation . on comparing with the dynamics in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) , there is a marked decrease in the jumps between the @xmath77 region and the nh region .",
    "nevertheless , prompt dissociation again seems to occur once the trajectory crosses the dh region at a specific time . on the other hand , a regular trajectory ( not shown here ) remains locked in the @xmath77 resonance and a chaotic but non - dissociating trajectory jumps between the @xmath77 resonance and the noble hub over the entire time duration .",
    "more importantly , the nondissociating trajectories , regular and chaotic , do not cross the specific dh region in the frequency ratio space",
    ".    is crossing of the dissociation hub a generic feature of all the dissociating trajectories ? in order to answer this question , in fig .",
    "[ fig3](c ) we show the frequency ratio space from a data set containing only non - dissociating trajectories .",
    "interestingly , fig .",
    "[ fig3](c ) shows that the density in the vicinity of the dh hub diminishes whereas the density around the nh region remains unchanged .",
    "this clearly indicates that the high density at the dissociation hub in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] is a specific characteristic of dissociating trajectories .",
    "therefore , the dh region is like a  gateway \" for dissociation since the frequency ratio space is also rather sparse to the left of the dh region .",
    "it is clear from the web shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] that @xmath32:@xmath32 mode - mode resonance and the noble hub consisting of several irrational frequency ratios , and their rational approximants in terms of high order resonances , are dynamically the most visited regions of the web",
    ". the enhanced density in the nh region could be due to two main reasons .",
    "firstly , this might be because of frequent visits of every trajectory in the specific region of the frequency ratio space resulting in the observed enhanced density .",
    "secondly , the trajectories could be genuinely sticky and upon entering the region could be trapped for a considerable time",
    ". such stickiness of individual trajectories can also lead to enhanced density . establishing whether the nh region is sticky or not is crucial since the existence of sticky regions in phase space imply long time dynamical correlations which , in turn , have important implications for the transport mechanism@xcite .",
    "note that fig .",
    "[ fig3](c ) already hints at the possibility of nh being a sticky region .",
    "in addition , our calculations ( not shown here ) of the mean square displacement of the action @xmath87 @xmath88 ^ 2 \\rangle \\sim \\tau^{\\beta}\\ ] ] with the average being done over nondissociating trajectories , show @xmath89 and hence subdiffusive behaviour .",
    "further understanding into the nature of the nh region can be obtained by analysing the residence times of trajectories entering the region .",
    "the approach employed to obtain the residence time distribution is as follows .",
    "we define boxes in the high density regions of the frequency ratio space as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . during the dynamics",
    "the time at which the trajectory enters and then leaves this region are denoted by @xmath90 and @xmath91 respectively .",
    "the residence time @xmath92 for one such event of the trajectory residing in the nh region is noted .",
    "there may be several events of such kind for a trajectory and out of all such events we pick the longest @xmath93 in the region of interest .",
    "we then construct the distribution of the longest @xmath93 for the entire ensemble of trajectories for fixed initial actions ( corresponding to the initial state of interest ) and varying initial angles .    the distribution of the longest residence times in the nh , @xmath81 resonance and dh regions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . clearly , the resonant and the nh regions do support trajectories with fairly long residence times .",
    "therefore , the enhanced density in the nh region of the web in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] arises due to extensive stickiness and supports the subdiffusive behaviour of @xmath94 mentioned above . in comparison ,",
    "the dh region is far less sticky and hence in agreement with it being interpreted as the dissociation gateway . although not shown here , studies on other initial states do highlight similar regions in the frequency ratio space .",
    "the differences in the dissociation dynamics , however , arise from the relative extent of trapping in the various regions .",
    "the results in this section imply that at least on the classical level it is not appropriate to describe the dissociation as being statistical .",
    "the three main hubs in the classical phase space play a crucial role in the dissociation mechanism .",
    "as the key regions in the phase space have been identified , the next logical question is whether we can discover the mechanism of dissociation . in order to answer this question",
    "we also need the precise mechanisms , in terms of appropriate phase space structures , by which trajectories are transported from one region to the other .",
    "in particular , one needs to understand the transport near resonance junctions - a demanding@xcite but important task for the future .",
    "nevertheless , an idea of the different mechanisms can be obtained from the dynamical frequency ratio space .",
    "the jumps in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) happen to be along lines with negative slopes .",
    "on comparing to the static web in fig .",
    "[ fig1p ] it seems that the ternary resonances are playing a crucial role .",
    "although there are several high order mode - mode resonances in the vicinity of the nh region , it is useful to remember that the ch mode does not dissociate in the absence of the field .",
    "clearly , significant excitations in the cn mode are required in order to cause extensive ivr and evidence for the same can be observed in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] as visitations of the trajectory to regions with low values of @xmath95 . as a rough estimate",
    ", a value of @xmath96 corresponds to the unperturbed action value of @xmath97 .",
    "thus , the ternary resonances along with the @xmath32:@xmath32 resonance must be enhancing the ivr between the two modes , ultimately resulting in dissociation",
    ". however , fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] unequivocally shows that the pathways of the short and long time dissociation trajectories are different .",
    "in this work we have studied the classical dynamics of a system with @xmath98 degrees of freedom to gain insights into the dissociation dynamics in presence of ivr .",
    "our work emphasizes the utility of time - frequency analysis in understanding the nature of phase space transport in such high dimensional phase spaces .",
    "in particular , we have constructed and identified regions in the resonance web _ i.e. , _ in the full phase space , which control and regulate the classical dissociation dynamics of a model triatomic molecule .",
    "three key regions in the web regulate the dynamics .",
    "of these , a region called as the dissociation hub acts as a gateway to dissociation and the region called as the noble hub , corresponding to the overlap of several high order mode - mode nonlinear resonances and pairwise irrational frequency ratios , leads to extensive stickiness . the combined influence of the dissociation and noble hubs in the phase space results in the phase space transport being anomalous .",
    "thus , despite being chaotic , certain trajectories survive for very long time without undergoing dissociation .",
    "moreover , the frequency ratio space dynamics clearly shows the existence of different dissociation pathways for prompt and late dissociating class of trajectories .",
    "however , the present study represents only a start towards , what we believe , are important questions that need to be answered in order to understand and influence the mechanism of dissociation .",
    "we conclude by mentioning a few of these issues .    1 .   what is the precise mechanistic difference between the fast and slow dissociating trajectories ?",
    "some hints do emerge from the present work . however , a systematic study of the role of the various resonance junctions and the phase space structures which mediate transport between them is necessary to make further progress . in this regard",
    "it is imperative to construct@xcite the full arnold web and study the time evolution of the web .",
    "is it possible to relate the notion of the dissociation hub as a gateway to the concept of transition states in driven systems@xcite ?",
    "this requires one to determine the invariant manifolds in phase space using the technique of time - dependent normal forms and thereby distinguish between long time chaotic dissociating and nondissociating trajectories .",
    "such a study would provide the much needed connection between the dynamics in the frequency ratio space and the powerful approach of transition state theory .",
    "do the classical phase space structures and the resulting mechanisms survive quantization ? this is an important issue and the studies reported here provide a firm baseline for establishing a clear classical - quantum correspondence perspective into the role of ivr in quantum control .",
    "preliminary computations of the quantum dissociation probabilities suggest that changes in the phase space dynamics caused by external driving fields , especially stickiness , do influence the quantum transport as well .",
    "in particular , there are indications that the various hubs are more restrictive in the quantum case .",
    "4 .   given that the key phase space structures regulating the dissociation dynamics have been identified , is it indeed possible to design control schemes by interfering with the specific phase space structures ?",
    "such a local phase space approach towards control has been explored recently for systems with lower degrees of freedom@xcite .",
    "it remains to be seen if the insights gained from the current work can be utilized for controlling the dissociation dynamics by locally rebuilding appropriate phase space barriers .",
    "furthermore , we hope that understanding the phase space dynamics of such higher dimensional systems might provide a useful way of gaining insights into the nature of the fields coming out of an optimal control theory calculation .",
    "a recent work@xcite addresses this issue in the context of a driven one degree of freedom system and the work presented in this paper is a first step towards generalizing to driven systems with higher degrees of freedom .",
    "one aspect of the problem that we have been silent about is that of the phenomenon of arnold diffusion . in principle",
    ", the system considered here can undergo arnold diffusion .",
    "however , in practice , the timescale for arnold diffusion might be too long compared to the dissociation timescale and hence play no role in the mechanism of slow dissociating trajectories .",
    "nevertheless , from a fundamental perspective , the current system provides another model , apart from the driven coupled quartic oscillator model@xcite considered by chirikov in his seminal work , for studying arnold diffusion and its quantum manifestations@xcite .",
    "this work was supported by a fellowship to as from indian institute of technology , kanpur , india .",
    "we would also like to thank amber jain for useful discussions during early stages of this work ."
