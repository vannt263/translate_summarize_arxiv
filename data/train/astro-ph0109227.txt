    "absorption in the far infrared due to collision - induced absorption ( cia ) by h@xmath1 and the lack of absorption in the near infrared at the classic steam opacity windows together result in a redistribution of gliese 229b s emergent flux from the mid- and far - ir to the @xmath2 ( @xmath01.05 ) , @xmath3 ( @xmath01.25 ) , @xmath4 ( @xmath01.6 ) , and @xmath5 ( @xmath02.2 ) bands in the near - infrared .",
    "these band fluxes exceed the corresponding black body values for a given by as much as two to three orders of magnitude . given the importance of the near - infrared bands , it is only natural that they be used to help establish the associated new spectral types ( burgasser et al .",

    "this new progression of m@xmath6l@xmath6 t from stars to brown dwarfs is one of the most exciting recent developments in  stellar \" astronomy .",
    "while the use of the near - infrared to characterize and type l and t dwarfs may be natural for low - temperature objects ( most of which are substellar ) , this ignores their many interesting spectral features and unique behavior shortward of 1.0 micron , the classic realm of stellar classification .",
    "it has recently been shown that the potassium resonance doublet near 7700   and the sodium d line(s ) around 5890  , along with their broad wings , dominate t dwarf spectra between 0.5 and 1.0 microns ( burrows , marley , and sharp 2000 ( bms ) ; tsuji , ohnaka , and aoki 1999 ; liebert et al .",
    "it was also shown by bms that the i - band magnitude of gliese 229b measured by golimowski et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and by matthews et al .",
    "( 1996 ) is fully consistent with the potassium wing hypothesis .",
    "the resulting red / purple / magenta  visual \" appearance and the diagnostic ( and at times , counterintuitive ; see  [ system ] ) gravity , , and metallicity dependences of the short - wavelength spectra make the optical ( loosely defined by the  ccd \" cutoff ) from @xmath00.4 to @xmath01.0 an intriguing subject of study and theoretical inquiry .",
    "hence , in this paper we focus on the spectra of t dwarfs below 1.0 .",
    "we have calculated a new series of self - consistent spectra , colors , and spectral indices for theoretical brown dwarf atmospheres with  from 600 k to 1300 k. the low  of these models and the fact that they do not incorporate clouds / grains in their atmospheres exclude the l dwarfs from this inquiry ( burrows et al . 2001 ; ackerman and marley 2001 ) .",

    ", we summarize some of the recent t dwarf measurements shortward of 1.0 micron , which we interpret with the new theoretical models . in  [ theory ] , we present a full suite of new theoretical spectra .",
    "these spectra will be used later in  [ modelfits][comparisons ] to extract information from the new t dwarf data at short wavelengths .",
    "section [ uncertain ] summarizes the major techniques , assumptions , and uncertainties in modeling of t dwarf spectra and includes an aside on the treatment of the alkali line profiles . in  [ profbright ] , we give example t / p profiles and representative plots of the @xmath7 temperature , t@xmath8 .",
    "next , in  [ define ] we define the spectral indices and colors we use throughout , particularly in  [ comparisons ] .",
    "note that  [ profbright ] and  [ define ] describe diagnostics by which one can better understand the observational trends . then in  [ modelfits",
    "] , we provide representative fits to the spectra of gliese 229b and gliese 570d and continue in  [ rainout ] with what can be learned with the new data at short wavelengths concerning the rainout of refractories ( burrows and sharp 1999 ; lodders 1999 ) and the line profiles of the alkali metals .",
    "after this , in  [ system ] we describe the systematic dependences of the optical and near - infrared spectra on , gravity , and metallicity and in  [ comparisons ] we compare the theoretical spectral indices with those obtained using t dwarf spectra . finally , in  [ clouds ] we list several hints of the residual influence of clouds in early t dwarf atmospheres ( see also marley et al .",
    "2001 ) and in  [ conclusion ] we summarize our general results and conclusions . given the remaining ambiguities in both the gas - phase opacities ( e.g. , of methane , the alkali metals , water ) and in the proper treatment of clouds and given the possible effects of non - equilibrium chemistry ( griffith and yelle 1999,2000 ; saumon et al .",
    "2000 ; lodders 1999 ) , we are less interested in obtaining detailed fits than we are in the overall systematics of the class of t dwarfs .",
    "hence , our focus in this paper is on the generic behavior at short wavelengths of the t dwarf _ family _ as a whole .",
    "this is the first paper in which theoretical models and optical data for a large collection of t dwarfs , not just individual t dwarfs such as gliese 229b ( marley et al .",

    "it lists objects in order of assigned spectral subtype ( kirkpatrick et al . 1999 ; burgasser et al . 2001a ) and provides the associated references and short - hand names we employ .",
    "more detailed discussions on the keck lris ( oke et al .",
    "1995 ) optical spectra of these t dwarfs and the associated signal - to - noise ratios can be found in kirkpatrick et al .",

    "figures [ fig:1 ] and [ fig:2 ] depict spectra for the objects listed in table 1 ( except for 2mass-1237 ) from 0.6 to 1.0 .",
    "to facilitate intercomparison , these spectra have been normalized to a value of one at 1.0 .",
    "normalization also serves to emphasize that we still do nt know the parallaxes for most of these t dwarfs and , hence , can not assign absolute flux levels .",
    "the data shortward of @xmath00.8 have a signal - to - noise ratio per pixel as low as @xmath01 ( burgasser 2001b ; kirkpatrick et al .",
    "therefore , below 0.8 we have used boxcar smoothing for the noisiest spectra to help discriminate between the relative flux levels of these t dwarfs in the @xmath00.7 region .    as is clear from figs .",
    "[ fig:1 ] and [ fig:2 ] , the spectral slopes shortward of 1.0 cover a broad range of values and the spectra themselves fan out into a family that no doubt reflects variations in the underlying physical properties . ignoring the two l dwarfs , the salient features are the water feature near 0.93 , the spectral slope in the 0.8 to 0.95 region , and the relative height of the bump between the ki resonance lines ( @xmath07700 ) and the na d lines ( @xmath05890  ) .",
    "these features inform our choice of the spectral indices we define for this study (  [ define ] ) . indeed , as was demonstrated by liebert et al .",
    "( 2000 ) with their optical spectrum of sdss-1624 ( t6 ) , it is clear from figs .",
    "[ fig:1 ] and [ fig:2 ] that the k i doublet at @xmath07700   and its wings dominate the region from 0.7 to 1.0 ( see  [ theory ] ) . also , as is clearest for the early t dwarfs and 2mass-0559 ( t5 , green in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) , absorption by the na d lines is a natural explanation for the suppression of flux shortward of 0.7 . in principle , the equivalent widths of the cs features at 8523   and 8946   and of the rb features at 7802   and 7949",
    "  are additional diagnostics ( basri et al . 1999 ; griffith and yelle 2000 ) .",
    "a useful index in this spectral region is the i@xmath9-z@xmath9 ( sloan ab ; fukugita et al .",
    "1996 ) color , where i@xmath9 peaks in the region from @xmath00.7 to @xmath00.8 and z@xmath9 extends from approximately @xmath00.8 to @xmath01.0 .",
    "the fact that the behavior of the spectra depicted in figs .",
    "[ fig:1 ] and [ fig:2 ] is not completely monotonic with the infrared - determined spectral subtypes indicates to us that the t dwarf spectral subtypes are not determined solely by .",
    "gravity and , perhaps , metallicity also play a role .",
    "in particular , the 2mass-0559 ( t5 ) ( green curve in fig . [ fig:1 ] ) spectrum shortward of 0.9 is  redder \" than that of sdss-1624 ( t6 ) ( blue curve in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) , despite the former s earlier spectral subtype . as we argue in  [ comparisons ] , this implies that the surface gravity of sdss-1624 ( t6 ) is lower than that of 2mass-0559 ( t5 ) .",
    "in addition , even though the spectral subtype of sdss-1021 is t3 , while that of sdss-1254 is t2 , the relative flux level of sdss-1021 is generally above ( at both 0.73 and 0.83 ) that of sdss-1254 . since in  [ theory ] and  [ system ] we demonstrate in the likely range of sdss-1021 and sdss-1254 that decreases in and increases in gravity increase the redness of the spectrum shortward of 0.9 , we conclude that the gravity ( and presumably the mass ) of sdss-1021 is lower than that of sdss-1254 . though is the major determinant , a sufficiently large gravity difference can reverse the apparent dependence of subtype on changes in .    the optical data depicted in figs .",
    "[ fig:1 ] and [ fig:2 ] are state - of - the - art , but , in particular for the later t dwarfs and shortward of 0.8 , they are of fairly low resolution . nevertheless , these spectra can help guide us in this exploration of the dependence of optical spectra on t dwarf physical properties and in discerning the range of gravities and represented by the objects in table 1 .",
    "the near absence of parallaxes is an impediment to detailed fits , as is the noise in the observed spectra at shorter optical wavelengths .",
    "however , the optical colors and spectral indices (  [ define ] and  [ comparisons ] ) that can be calculated for the growing list of t dwarfs with measured spectra shortward of 1.0 still provide useful physical diagnostics with which our suite of theoretical models can be used to determine the possible range of their , gravities , and metallicities .",
    "as a prelude to the discussions in  [ modelfits][comparisons ] , we present a collection of new theoretical spectra that span the t dwarf regime .",
    "figure [ fig:3 ] portrays the absolute flux ( @xmath10 ) in millijanskys versus wavelength from 0.4 to 1.5  for solar - metallicity models for the two gravities and the full range of ( see  [ uncertain ] ) . the higher curves in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] are for models with the higher .",
    "prominent are the na d and k i resonance doublets at @xmath05890   and @xmath07700  , the water bands around 0.93 , 1.15 , and 1.4 , the cs i lines at 8523   and 8946  , the li i line at 6708  , the rb i lines at 7802   and 7949  , and ( for the hottest models ) the tio and vo features near @xmath00.45 and 0.9@xmath61.05 . at 1.2432/1.2522",
    "the k i doublet is seen for at 700 k and above .",
    "it was assumed in these models that clouds / grains / dust that may form at depth nevertheless have no effect on an object s t / p profile , nor on its spectrum . as we argue in  [ clouds ] , this may not be true for the earliest t dwarfs . in determining molecular abundances , unless otherwise stated we employed the rainout prescription for the refractory silicates described in burrows and sharp ( 1999 ) . as explained in that reference and in burrows , marley , and sharp ( 2000 )",
    ", rainout depletes the atmospheres of the refractory elements ca , al , mg , fe , and si .",
    "this affects the abundance profiles of not only the nascent alkali metals , but tio , vo , feh , and crh .",
    "in particular , rainout suppresses the formation of alkali feldspars and enables atomic na and k to survive to lower temperatures and pressures , at which point they form na@xmath1s(c ) and kcl(c ) ( lodders 1999 ) . as a consequence , their influence on the emergent spectrum in the  optical \" between 0.5 and 1.1 is enhanced .",
    "rainout also restricts the range of lower temperatures and pressures where tio , vo , fe(l , c ) , crh , and feh can be found .",
    "however , since the crh opacities are soon to be updated significantly , feh and crh bands were not incorporated into this model set and we defer a discussion of their role to a later work ( see also  [ uncertain ] ) .    the normalized observed spectra shortward of 1.0 were presented in figs .",
    "[ fig:1 ] and [ fig:2 ] .",
    "the corresponding normalized theoretical spectra at solar - metallicity and for gravities of 10@xmath11 cm s@xmath12 and 10@xmath13 cm s@xmath12 are displayed in fig .",
    "[ normal ] .",
    "a comparison of figs .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , [ fig:2 ] , and [ normal ] is illuminating and reveals that the theoretical family nicely spans the observations .",
    "furthermore , the general overall spectral shapes , particularly from 0.8 to 0.9 , are reproduced .",
    "we compare these model spectra with data in  [ modelfits]-[system ] .",
    "however , we first discuss some of the major uncertainties in the models and a variety of physical diagnostics that are useful in interpreting measurements .",
    "to construct new atmosphere / spectral models of brown dwarfs , we employ the complete linearization / accelerated-@xmath14-iteration method of hubeny and lanz ( 1995 ) , molecular and atomic opacities as described in burrows et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , and the equation of state of saumon , chabrier , and van horn ( 1995 ) .",
    "we explore both rainout , using the prescription of burrows and sharp ( 1999 ) ( see also lodders 1999 ) , and non - rainout composition assumptions , though when not explicitly stated rainout has been incorporated .",
    "the t / p profiles at depth obtained using the lodders ( 1999 ) and the burrows and sharp ( 1999 ) rainout prescriptions are the same ( all else being equal ) to better than 2% ( m. marley , private communication ) .    the depletion of refractories into silicate clouds is an intrinsically non - equilibrium and dynamical process .",
    "hence , any prescription that purports to address this can do so only crudely .",
    "fortunately , it is the clouds at depth into which settle / rain the refractory elements that would have been in the upper atmospheres that are the most problematically handled ; the upper atmospheric depletions of mg , si , fe , al , and ca themselves and the resultant metal - depleted molecular compositions are better handled , yielding compositions that are probably good to better than 10% .",
    "since our modeling is focussed on t dwarfs in which clouds play no central role ( however , see  [ clouds ] ) , our rainout prescriptions are as good as current practice allows .",
    "however , at the higher in the l dwarf regime , the actual physics of clouds ( and their particle sizes , spatial extent , optical properties , and degree of patchiness ) assumes a greater importance .",
    "furthermore , the possible effects of non - equilibrium chemistry and rapid transport of spectroscopically - active species may also be important ( lodders 1999 ; griffith and yelle 1999,2000 ; saumon et al .",
    "2000 ) . in particular",
    ", though co and nh@xmath15 have no strong bands short of 1.0 micron and play only a very minor role in setting the t / p profile of a t dwarf , the suggestion that their abundances may be out of equilibrium due to dynamic convective transport deserves further attention ( saumon et al .",
    "2000 ; noll , geballe , and marley 1997 ) .",
    "quite obviously , no current prescription for cloud opacities or for dynamic transport and their effects on emergent spectra can be beyond reproach or improvement . in this paper ,",
    "given our focus on t dwarfs we ignore both .",
    "our models are produced using the opacity sampling technique to arrive at converged and consistent temperature / pressure profiles , from which higher - resolution spectra are then calculated for a given spectral interval . for the t / p profile calculation ,",
    "no more than 2000 wavelengths are needed , which range from 0.4 to 300 .",
    "each model was converged in temperature and flux to better than 0.1% in typically a few minutes on a standard workstation .",
    "the speed of our code is a direct consequence of the complete linearization approach .",
    "marley et al . ( 2001 ) and burrows et al . (",
    "1997 ) use the k - coefficient method with the equivalent of @xmath0800 wavelengths .",
    "similar to the odf method , their implementation avoids its major pitfall by combining the abundance - weighted opacities of all the relevant molecules and atoms before creating the distribution function that is at the heart of the odf approach .",
    "we use a mixing - length prescription to handle convection , with a mixing - length parameter of 1.0 .",
    "marley et al . ( 2001 ) flatten the entropy gradient in convective regions .",
    "saumon et al . ( 2000 ) use the t / p profiles generated by marley , as in marley et al .",
    "allard et al . ( 2001 ) use mixing - length theory , with a mixing - length parameter of 1.0 .",
    "at low , the actual mixing length parameter is irrelevant ; changing the mixing - length parameter from 0.5 to 2.0 changes the t / p profile by no more than @xmath020 k. however , above @xmath01500 k , the actual value of this parameter is an issue of modest interest .",
    "nevertheless , the theoretical t / p profiles in grainless atmospheres below = 1500 k are similar , differing by no more than 10% ( usually less ) at atmospheric levels from 800 k to 2000 k ( cf . this work ; marley , unpublished ; allard et al .",
    "2001 ) .    for",
    "the spectra we display here , 5000 wavelengths , logarithmically spaced from 0.4 to 1.5 , were used and then the spectrum was boxcar - smoothed to an effective resolution , r ( @xmath16 ) , of 1000 at each wavelength .",
    "models were generated with from 600 k to 1300 k , in steps of 100k ( plus at a few extra , when needed ) , at two gravities ( @xmath17 = @xmath18 cm s@xmath12 and @xmath19 cm s@xmath12 ) , and for three metallicities ( z ) ( @xmath20solar , solar , and @xmath21solar ) .",
    "the anders and grevesse ( 1989 ) abundance data were used to represent / define the solar pattern .",
    "this -gravity - z parameter set was chosen to allow us to span the model space in which it is reasonable to assume the newly - discovered t dwarfs reside , as well as to gauge the systematic behavior of the observables with , gravity , and metallicity .",
    "the brown dwarf radii ( @xmath22 ) assumed were derived from the analytic formula found in burrows et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and marley et al .",
    "( 1996 ) : @xmath23 where @xmath17 is in cm s@xmath12 and is in kelvin .",
    "this procedure is not perfectly consistent , since the evolutionary models upon which this equation for the radius is based incorporate slightly different atmosphere models as boundary conditions . nevertheless , the error in the radius is small ( @xmath2410% ) and the derived colors and spectral indices are independent of radius .",
    "the major differences between theoretical models arise from the different opacity databases employed . for substellar dwarfs ,",
    "the major gas - phase opacities are due to h@xmath1o , h@xmath1 , ch@xmath25 , co , nh@xmath15 , the neutral alkali metals , tio , vo , feh , and crh .",
    "a subsidiary role is played by ph@xmath15 , mgh , caoh , cah , sio , and h@xmath1s .",
    "importantly , the _ equilibrium _ abundances of the dominant molecules ( in particular , h@xmath1o , h@xmath1 , ch@xmath25 , co , n@xmath1 , and nh@xmath15 ) are easily calculated ( burrows and sharp 1999 ) .",
    "most researchers use the same h@xmath1 ( borysow and frommhold 1990 ; zheng and borysow 1995 ; borysow , jrgensen , and zheng 1997 ) and h@xmath1o ( partridge and schwenke 1997 ) opacities .",
    "we calculate our tio and vo opacities using plez ( 1998,1999 ) and jrgensen ( 1997 ) , including the effects of isotope shifts , and believe them to be state - of - the - art . as stated in ",
    "[ theory ] , we omit feh and crh from this t dwarf model set .",
    "their omission affects predominantly l dwarfs in the spectral regions around 0.86 and 0.99 ( feh , the wing - ford band ) , but does not change to any significant degree t - dwarf t / p profiles , nor the vast majority of the spectrum where feh / crh features do not contribute . note",
    "that , as do most researchers in this field ( saumon et al .",
    "2000 ; marley et al . 2001 ; allard et al .",
    "2001 ) , we currently use the 52-million line subset of the 308-million line partridge and schwenke ( 1997 ) water database .",
    "though recently questions have been raised concerning its accuracy in some wavelength regimes ( jones et al .",
    "2002 ) , the partridge and schwenke compilation remains the best available .",
    "methane opacities are an important wildcard , with the  hot bands \" and the red side of the @xmath4 photometric band being the most problematic ( burrows et al .",
    "however , apart from a minor band near 0.89 , methane plays only a very modest role in  optical \" t dwarf spectra , though its effects in the infrared help to define the t dwarfs and the l@xmath6 t transition ( burgasser et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the methane feature that has the most effect on a t / p profile is the strong @xmath26 band at 3.3 , but its opacity seems to be well in hand . not unexpectedly , most researchers use much the same methane opacity data ( cf .",
    "burrows et al .",
    "2001 ; saumon et al .",
    "2000 ; marley et al .",
    "2001 ) . nevertheless , it is in the different implementations of the extant line lists and opacity databases , in the different collisional broadening prescriptions , and in the inaccuracies in these various databases that one is likely to find the origin of most of the differences between the various theoretical models ( burrows et al .",
    "1997 ; allard et al .",
    "2001 ; tsuji et al . 1999 ; saumon et al 2000 ; geballe et al .",
    "2001 ; marley et al .",
    "2001 ) and between theory and data .",
    "however , the alkali lines and their wing profiles are a special case to which we now turn .",
    "as emphasized in burrows , marley , and sharp ( 2000 ) , it is not strictly correct to use lorentzian profiles for the na d ( @xmath05890  ) and k i ( @xmath07700  ) doublets in their far wings , as we do for this paper and as is the standard practice in most stellar atmospheres work .",
    "in fact , the dominance of these doublets is a central feature of brown - dwarf / t - dwarf spectra and colors at wavelengths from 0.4 through 1.0 . while the line core behavior and oscillator strengths for these transitions are well in hand ( piskunov et al .",
    "1995 ) , there remain ambiguities in the treatment of these lines at large detunings ( @xmath27 ) and the as - yet - unknown shapes of their wings will have a bearing on the viability of spectral fits .",
    "for this study , we have used the default lorentzian out to a transition wavelength redward of the line cores ( 7700   for na d and 9800 for the k i doublet ) , after which we allow the strength to decay as a gaussian in wavelength with a width of 0.075@xmath28 .",
    "the latter merely results in a smooth cutoff at a large detuning , but is otherwise arbitrary .",
    "this prescription for the alkali wings is different from that suggested by burrows , marley , and sharp ( 2000 ) because in this paper we want to make only minimal alterations to the standard lorentzian until better estimates of the wing shapes are available .",
    "the bms prescription has an ad hoc parameter @xmath29 whose value affects the far wing line shape and introduces an  effective \" cutoff , but is in fact unconstrained . a choice of @xmath30 for k and @xmath31 for na provides as good a fit to t dwarf spectra as the simpler prescription we employ here , given the noise in the optical data ( liebert et al .",
    "however , the use of a bms @xmath29 parameter implies a certain functional form that is not motivated by the proper physical chemistry , only by the need for a cutoff (  [ rainout ] ) .    though the general overall spectral shapes seen in fig .",
    "[ normal ] , particularly from 0.8 to 0.9 , are reproduced ( liebert et al . 2000 ) with either the bms or our modified lorentzian prescriptions , there are two features that are problematic in the comparision of figs . 1 , 2 , and 4 .",
    "one is that the theoretical peak between the k i and na d troughs is shifted by @xmath00.02 to shorter wavelengths than the observed average . this could easily be a consequence of the all - too - simple alkali line profile algorithms used .",
    "the other is that for the earlier t dwarfs the k i trough at 7700   is a bit narrower than derived using either the bms or the current theory .",
    "both prescriptions yield equally discrepant spectral shapes , though the fractional deviations in the flux densities or  equivalent widths \" derived using either prescription are at most a few tens of percent .",
    "it should be noted that the prescriptions for the alkali line shapes used in the literature have included a pure lorentzian with a sharp cutoff at an arbitrary wavelength at a large detuning ( allard et al .",
    "2001 ) , a pure lorentzian with a sharp cutoff at an arbitrary wavelength at a small detuning ( tsuji et al .",
    "1999 ) , and the burrows , marley , and sharp ( 2000 ) prescription ( marley et al . 2001 ; saumon et al .",
    "2000 ; geballe et al .",
    "frequently , however , the alkali - line - shape prescription employed in a paper is unexplained and sometimes the na / k alkali metals have been omitted ( griffith , yelle , and marley 1998 ) .",
    "the data shortward of 0.8 are indeed noisy , so this might be a major factor in any discrepancies between our theoretical spectra and observation , but as the comparison of figs .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , [ fig:2 ] , and [ normal ] nevetheless demonstrates , the remaining @xmath010 - 50% ambiguity in the flux densities is much smaller than the factors of @xmath0210 deviations previously seen in the literature shortward of 0.8 ( cf .",
    "tsuji et al . 1999 ) .",
    "hence , our current approach to the na / k alkali - line shapes is as reasonable as any , but the reader should bear in mind the need for significant further improvement .",
    "the dependence of the theoretical spectra on , gravity , and metallicity is a major focus of this paper .",
    "effects such as the general reddening in the optical with decreasing ( at a given gravity ) , which reverses at lower effective temperatures ( particularly noticeable in fig .",

    "the result is that t@xmath8 in the water absorption troughs near 0.93 , and between the @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath5 bands ( for instance ) , as well as those at the emission peaks themselves , decreases .",
    "however , since the near - ir is not on the rayleigh - jeans tail , these decreases in t@xmath8 lead to an increase in the flux contrast from peak to valley , as well as to an overall decrease in the fluxes .",
    "hence , the water troughs deepen with decreasing and , as table 2 demonstrates , @xmath40 gets _ bluer _ with decreasing ( burrows et al . 1997 ; allard et al .",

    "2001a ) and in figs .",
    "[ fig:1 ] and [ fig:2 ] . at the higher ( in the ls and early to mid ts ) , the systematics with decreasing described above for water can also be seen in the spectral region shortward of 1.0 micron dominated by the alkali metal lines and wings .",
    "in addition , increasing pressure with decreasing leads to greater pressure - broadening , enhancing the influence of the alkali metal wings .",
    "both effects lead to a _ reddening _ of the spectrum below @xmath01.0 with decreasing which has been identified in previous theoretical explorations ( e.g. , bms ; marley et al .",

    "in particular , we discover that the relative depth of the water feature near 0.93 ( measured by x23 ) decreases with increasing gravity .",
    "this is opposite to the effect of decreasing .",
    "one consequence is that any indices constructed from the contrasts between peak and water trough are not a one - parameter family in alone .",

    "overall , the solar and 2.0@xmath42solar models are very similar shortward of 1.0 . unless the metallicity is significantly subsolar ( griffith and yelle 1999 ) , the metallicity dependence of t dwarf spectra in the optical is weak ( except perhaps shortward of 0.6 ) .",
    "note that our lower - metallicity model has a more rounded @xmath2 band peak .",
    "such a shape is not in evidence in the t dwarf data .",
    "the differences in the near - ir at @xmath4 and @xmath5 are more pronounced , with lower - metallicity models being generically more blue in @xmath40 and @xmath57 .",
    "for instance , from 600 to 1300 k , the differences between the solar - metallicity and the 0.3@xmath42solar - metallicity models vary from 0.1 to 0.5 magnitudes in @xmath40 ( cf . table 2 and fig .",
    "[ fig:12 ] ) .",
    "the higher pressures in the low - metallicity atmospheres increase the cia opacity and suppress the @xmath5 band flux .",
    "we find that decreasing the metallicity by a factor of three has a greater effect on the @xmath5 band than increasing the gravity by the same factor .",
    "this behavior with metallicity requires that if gliese 229b has a low metallicity ( griffith and yelle 1999 ) it must also have a low gravity .",
    "high - gravity models for gliese 229b can not simultaneously be low - metallicity ( allard et al . 2001 ) .",
    "it would be very useful for the determination of the physical parameters of the t dwarf gliese 229b to obtain its spectrum from @xmath00.6 to 0.8 and its x97 and i@xmath9-z@xmath9 indices ( consistently calibrated ) .",
    "figures [ fig:10 ] , [ fig:11 ] , [ fig:12 ] , and [ fig:13 ] are  color - color \" diagrams that summarize the numerical data in table 2 .",
    "the upper - case letters on the figures represent the positions in these index plots of the measured t dwarfs .",
    "the letter that corresponds to a given t dwarf is indicated in table 2 and in the figure caption to fig .",
    "[ fig:10 ] .",
    "errors of @xmath480.1 dex in the x indices and @xmath00.25 in i@xmath9-z@xmath9 and @xmath40 ( bessell / cousins ) colors have been suppressed on these figures to avoid further clutter and to allow the basic collective gestalt to emerge .",
    "the lines on the plots are families as a function of at given gravities and metallicities .",
    "each point represents an from 600 k to 1300 k , in steps of 100  k. the basic success of the models is clear from the correspondence between the regions occupied by the observed t dwarfs and where the theory points reside . in principle , a comparison of the observed positions on these plots with those for the theoretical models would allow one to determine , gravity , and metallicity .",
    "however , the errors in the indices and the overlaps of the model families make such a determination a bit less straightforward . in fact , such errors make it difficult to determine and gravity for most of the t dwarfs listed in table 1 to better than @xmath49150 k in and 0.25 dex in gravity .",
    "fits to most of the measured spectra can be obtained , but without parallaxes and given the remaining errors in the data they tell us very little we can use .",
    "hence , we prefer not to provide specific object - by - object and gravity estimates , unless parallaxes are available or the object is an outlier in its spectrum or indices .",
    "nevertheless , from table 2 , fig .",
    "[ normal ] , the new optical data , and our theoretical models we can infer that the of the listed t dwarfs , except for the three early ts , are 900@xmath49150 k. the corresponding gravity range could in principle span our model set from 10@xmath47 cm s@xmath12 to 10@xmath13 cm s@xmath12 .",
    "note that values for the of the early t dwarfs are approximately bracketed by 1100 k and 1300 k ( see table 2 , figs .",

    "[ fig:10 ] , we see that our theory successfully provides the correct general overall x97/x98 slope and distinguishes the l dwarf region from the t dwarf region .",

    "2001a ) is a bit more rounded than average , reminiscent of the behavior of the low - metallicity model depicted in fig .",

    "we do not draw any conclusions from the lonely position of 2mass-1237 ( k ) on this figure and on figs .",

    "better data are clearly needed .",
    "figure [ fig:11 ] demonstrates once again that our basic theoretical treatment shortward of 1.0 micron is not far wrong .",
    "we also see that the of modest- to high - gravity models of the early t dwarfs must be @xmath581300 k and that 2mass-0937 ( i ) is best fit with a low - metallicity model , though not definitively so . however , the proximity of the model lines , their overlap , and the errors in the data together make it difficult to draw detailed conclusions concerning the  central \" t dwarfs .",
    "figure [ fig:12 ] is a color - color diagram that demonstrates the non - monotonic behavior of i@xmath9-z@xmath9 with (  [ system ] ) and the outlier status of 2mass-0937 .",
    "it also makes the case that the early t dwarfs are not fit well in the near infrared by this grainless model set .",
    "no doubt , part of the problem lies with the incomplete methane opacity database in the @xmath4 and @xmath5 bands , notably the absence of the  hot \" bands of methane .",
    "however , this can not account for the full discrepancy .",
    "the theoretical models are too blue in @xmath40 and the best explanation for this is the influence of residual dust / grains / clouds even in the early t dwarfs sdss-0837 ( t1,c ) , sdss-1254 ( t2,d ) , and sdss-1021 ( t3,e ) .",
    "the possible presence of grains is also suggested in fig .",
    "[ fig:13 ] , which portrays both the behavior of x98 with x23 ( h@xmath1o jump ) and the non - monotonic behavior with discussed previously .",
    "figure [ fig:13 ] shows that the depth of the water feature near 0.93 is not well reproduced by the models , unless many of the observed t dwarfs are of low metallicity ( griffith and yelle 1999,2000 ) .",
    "we surmise that extra opacity due to dust may be shallowing the water trough near 0.93 by 0.1 to 0.15 dex .",
    "such dust may also be contributing to the general reddening shortward of 1.0 micron ( tsuji , ohnaka , and aoki 1999 ) , still dominated by the wings of the k i ( 7700  ) doublet .",
    "the index figures and table 2 allow one to draw some qualitative conclusions concerning specific t dwarfs . as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fittwo ] , gliese 229b can be fit by a low - g / low - or a high - g / high - model .",
    "however , its value of x23 ( j on fig .",
    "[ fig:13 ] , one of the highest for the observed t dwarfs ) implies that the low - gravity solution is preferred .",
    "it is probable from their values of i@xmath9-z@xmath9 , x97 , and x23 that sdss-1624 s gravity is lower than that of 2mass-0559 .",
    "furthermore , a direct comparision of sdss-1624 s spectrum with that of gliese 229b leads one to conclude that its gravity is greater than that of gliese 229b .",
    "in addition , a comparison of the i@xmath9-z@xmath9 , x98 , and x97 indices for sdss-1021 ( t3 ) and sdss-1254 ( t2 ) leads one to conclude that sdss-1021 has the lower gravity .",
    "this is also the conclusion arrived at in ",
    "[ data ] directly from the spectra .",
    "sdss-1021 could also have a higher .",
    "the discussion in  [ rainout ] points to a quite interesting fact . at near the early edge of the t dwarf family ( @xmath01300 k ) , t@xmath8 in the @xmath2 and @xmath3 bands reaches 1700 - 1800 k for atmospheres without the opacity effects of clouds .",
    "this suggests that the silicate / iron clouds expected to reside above 1500 - 1700 k might significantly affect the shape and strength of the @xmath3 and @xmath2 emission peaks , even at such low .",
    "a very similar conclusion was reached by marley et al .",
    "this is not unreasonable , since the l to t transition is thought to coincide with the settling to depth of the clouds that dominate the l dwarf spectral type ( ackerman and marley 2001 ; burrows et al .",
    "the spectra of the early t dwarfs should show the residual influence of such clouds .",
    "indeed , as we argue in  [ comparisons ] , the ( i@xmath9-z@xmath9)/(@xmath40 ) color - color diagram suggests that clouds are required to fit the early t dwarfs sdss-0837 ( t1 ) , sdss-1254 ( t2 ) , and sdss-1021 ( t3 ) .",
    "as the t@xmath8 temperature argument suggests , it is in the @xmath2 and @xmath3 bands where the effects of clouds are primarily expected .",
    "our spectral models at @xmath01300 k ( fig . [ fig:3 ] ) manifest tio and vo features in these bands because we have not included the effects of clouds .",
    "clouds should not only mute the effects of tio and vo on the @xmath2 and @xmath3 bands of the = 1200/1300 k models in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] , but should also help reduce the contrast between the emission peaks at @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath5 and the water troughs at 1.15 and 1.4 ( jones and tsuji 1997 ) . furthermore , because the subordinate k i absorptions at 1.2432/1.2522 are from a thermally - excited state , they are formed only at high atmospheric temperatures .",
    "coincidently , they reside in the middle of the @xmath3 band where one is probing higher temperatures , as indicated by the higher t@xmath8s there ( fig . [ bright ] ) . however , the strengths we derive for these subordinate lines ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ) are generally greater than observed ( mclean et al .",
    "2000 ; saumon et al .",
    "this too may point to a mitigating role of veiling clouds / dust / grains . hence",
    ", there are numerous spectral regions that speak to the potential influence of clouds on t dwarf spectra .",
    "however , there remains a puzzle that may not be so easily explained by dust .",
    "the classic li feature at 6708   is included in our model set and can be seen on the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] . observations ( kirkpatrick et al . 1999 ) suggest that the strength of this feature peaks in the mid - l spectral range and then drops monotonically .",
    "currently , there is little indication of this line in the observed late l dwarfs , nor in the t dwarfs .",
    "however , in both our rainout and no - rainout ( unpublished ) models the li line survives to below = 600 k. allard et al .",
    "( 2001 ) also obtain this feature at low and pavlenko ( 2001 ) has an extensive theoretical discussion concerning its formation in late l dwarfs .",
    "since lithium burning in objects that currently have t dwarf occurs only for a narrow range of masses and gravities ( @xmath59 cm s@xmath12 ) , nuclear burning seems to be excluded as a generic explanation .",
    "chemistry would be the natural culprit , but both the burrows and sharp ( 1999 ) and lodders ( 1999 ) rainout prescriptions and the no - rainout prescription ( true equilibrium ) give qualitatively the same result .",
    "since atomic li should exist in abundance to temperatures around 1300 k ( lodders 1999 ) and should trail off below that and since t@xmath8s around 6700 are 1000 k to 1350 k for from 700 to 1300 k ( see fig .",
    "[ bright ] for 700@xmath61100 k ) , there is no obvious reason the 6708 li line should disappear before the l / t boundary .",
    "therefore , we suspect there is an interesting story to be told about real brown dwarf atmospheres in the resolution of this li - line problem .",
    "we have generated spectral models for the temperature range 600 k to 1300 k thought to encompass the t dwarfs .",
    "comparing these models with the new t dwarf data shortward of 1.0 micron , we find that the models can explain in qualitative and semi - quantitative fashion , the new observations and their systematic trends .",
    "furthermore , we demonstrate that untruncated lorentzian line profiles for the na d and k i ( 7700  ) resonance doublets are disfavored , that the atmospheric abundances of sodium and potassium have indeed been enhanced by the rainout of silicates ( bms ; lodders 1999 ) , that water bands weaken with increasing gravity , that modest decreases in metallicity enhance the effect of the alkali lines in the optical , and that at low the behavior of the optical spectra with reverses and becomes bluer with further decreases in ( as predicted by bms ) . moreover , we find that the upper edge of the t dwarf range is near @xmath01300 k.    we determine that the optical range is rich in diagnostics that are complementary to those in the near - infrared now used for spectroscopic classification .",
    "an important conclusion is that the t dwarf subtype is not a function of alone ; subtype is also a non - trivial function of gravity and metallicity .",
    "even if the range of metallicities represented by the known t dwarfs is small , gravity will play an important role in the near - ir and shortward of 1.0 micron in determining spectral shape , colors , and spectral subtype .    from the shallowness of the water feature near 0.93 , from the weaker than predicted k i features in the @xmath3 band , from the failure of the models to fit the @xmath40 colors of the early t dwarfs , and from the presence in the hotter models of tio and vo features in the @xmath2 and @xmath3 bands ( not seen in the observations of the earlier t dwarfs ) , we find evidence of residual dust / grains / clouds in early t dwarf atmospheres .",
    "a similar conclusion was recently reached by marley et al .",
    "the l dwarfs are known to be dominated by clouds ( burrows et al .",
    "2001 , and references therein ) , and the transition from the l dwarfs to the t dwarfs is predominantly due to the depletion and rainout of heavy metals ( ackerman and marley 2001 ; burrows and sharp 1999 ; marley et al .",
    "1996 ; allard et al .",
    "however , the continuing effect of clouds in the early t dwarfs seems to be indicated by the data .",
    "clouds in t dwarf atmospheres do not explain the redness of the spectrum shortward of 1.0 ( though they might contribute to it ) ; this is mostly explained by the k i line at 7700   and its wing ( burrows , marley , and sharp 2000 ) .",
    "however , the l and t transition is not as abrupt as earlier inferred by the sharp swing to the blue of @xmath40 .",
    "one can still see deeply into the atmosphere , even for low , into regions occupied by silicate ( and other ? ) clouds .",
    "the opacity spectrum of clouds is much more continuous and featureless than that of gas . as a consequence ,",
    "the influence of clouds is manifest by broad shape changes in the optical and near - ir spectra and by the suppression of gas - phase spectral features , not by specific and distinct spectral features , until one gets to @xmath010 and the classical silicate band appears . certainly , good models of the particle size spectrum , spatial extent , and composition of the grains or droplets are required to reproduce the measured spectra of the early t dwarfs in detail .",
    "the later t dwarfs are easier to fit , but the residual effect of clouds at depth on the emergent spectra can not yet be discounted .",
    "the t dwarfs are all brown dwarfs and the number of such substellar objects known to astronomy is growing fast .",
    "their spectra hold the key to their physical characterization and shortward of 1.0 micron these spectra have great diagnostic potential .",
    "we have attempted to make only a preliminary stab at comparing the new data at short wavelengths with theory and look forward to the creation of better opacity databases and cloud models , more precise spectral measurements , and the measurement of parallaxes that together will enable the final , detailed determination of the masses , gravities , , and compositions of the objects that inhabit this fascinating new spectral class .",
