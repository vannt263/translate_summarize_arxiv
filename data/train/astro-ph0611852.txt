    "within the currently - favoured cosmological framework , large spiral galaxies are thought to be assembled from the mergers and accretion of smaller building blocks and from the smooth accretion of gas . under the assumption",
    "that at least some of the accreted satellites contain significant stellar components , signatures of this hierarchical assembly process are expected in the form of tidal debris and other stellar inhomogeneities .",
    "bullock & johnston ( 2005 ) have shown that such substructure is expected to be most readily visible in the far outer regions of galaxies .",
    "the milky way ( mw ) halo shows at least one unambiguous case of ongoing accretion ( i.e. the sagittarius dwarf , ibata et al .",
    "1994 ) . observing the mw halo",
    "is , however , not trivial ; our location within the disk makes the identification and interpretation of halo structures through a dominant foreground disk population a challenge ( e.g. newberg et al .",
    "2002 ; juric et al .",
    "furthermore , depending on how membership is determined , various selection biases can enter into the construction of halo samples .",
    "studying halo populations in other galaxies is therefore an attractive alternative for testing ideas about galaxy assembly .",
    "the andromeda galaxy ( m31 ) has proven to be an excellent target for such studies . at a distance modulus of ( @xmath7)@xmath8 magnitudes ( mcconnachie et al .",
    "2005 ) , the m31 halo is well within reach for both photometric and spectroscopic investigations .",
    "although the morphological type of m31 ( sb ) is similar to that of the mw ( sbbc ) , it has often been pointed out that many differences exist between the two systems .",
    "for example , m31 appears to have less gas than the mw ( van den bergh 2000 ) and shows a larger population of globular clusters , some of which are possibly younger than their mw counterparts ( fusi pecci et al .",
    "2005 ) ( but see also cohen et al .",
    ". the recent discovery of a number of extended globular cluster - like objects in m31 ( huxor et al .",
    "2005 ) further adds to the list of differences since similar such objects have not yet been found around the milky way .",
    "one of the first photometric studies of the resolved stellar populations in the outer regions of m31 was made by mould & kristian ( 1986 ) .",
    "based on the colour of the brightest red giant branch stars , they found a more metal rich population than that of the mw halo . since these first results ,",
    "several subsequent studies have confirmed the presence of a population with a photometrically - determined metallicity peaking at [ fe / h ] @xmath1 0.6 dex ( e.g. durrell et al .",
    "1994 , 2001 ; holland et al .",
    "1996 ; bellazzini et al .  2003 ; brown et al .",
    "2003 , 2006 ) and with a significant spread in metallicity . in comparison , the metallicity distribution of the mw halo population peaks at [ fe / h ] @xmath1 1.6 dex ( laird et al .",
    "1988 ) .",
    "wide - field surveys of resolved populations provide the optimal means to probe the structure of nearby galaxies .",
    "the isaac newton telescope wide field camera survey has mapped m31 out to a radius of 55  kpc and beyond using resolved star counts that reach 23 magnitudes below the tip of the red giant branch ( ibata et al .",
    "2001 ; ferguson et al .  2002",
    "; irwin et al .  2005 ) . a similar survey with megacam on cfht is now mapping the south - eastern quadrant of the galaxy from 50150  kpc ( e.g. martin et al .  2006 ) .",
    "the resolved star count technique allows effective surface brightnesses as faint as @xmath9 magnitudes per square arcsecond to be reached and has uncovered a wealth of substructure at large radius in m31 .",
    "in particular , ferguson et al .",
    "( 2002 ) found evidence for large - scale spatial and colour inhomogeneities in the galaxy outskirts , including a giant stellar stream ( ibata et al .",
    "while the stream is almost certainly due to an ongoing accretion event , the nature of the other substructures around m31 is currently much less clear .",
    "recent studies of the stellar populations in the far outer regions of m31 have revealed what may be the m31 counterpart to the milky way halo",
    ". both star counts and spectroscopy indicate that a metal - poor , pressure - supported power - law halo component begins to dominate at distances @xmath10 30 kpc from the centre of m31 ( irwin et al .  2005 ,",
    "chapman et al .  2006 , kalirai et al .  2006 ) , whereas the photometric studies described above all lie within this radius .",
    "the origin of this outer halo population , and its relationship to the inner halo population as well as the discrete substructures , has yet to be established .",
    "one of the most prominent features identified in ferguson et al .",
    "( 2002 ) is the g1 clump stellar overdensity shown in figure  [ fig : pointing ] . named for its proximity to the g1 globular cluster , the feature is centered at ra(2000)@xmath11 , dec(2000)@xmath12 which corresponds to a projected radius of 29.6  kpc from the nucleus , almost directly along the south - western major axis .",
    "the feature spans more than @xmath1 10 kpc and has an estimated absolute magnitude of m@xmath13 ( ferguson et al .",
    "the close proximity to the g1 globular cluster ( @xmath14 projected separation ) has fueled speculation that the two might be physically related and motivated several recent studies .",
    "rich et al .",
    "( 1996 , 2004 ) present hst / wfpc2 observations of the field population near g1 ( though quite far from the center of the g1 clump , see figure  [ fig : pointing ] ) and find that the cluster and neighbouring field exhibit rather different colour - magnitude diagram ( hereafter , cmd ) morphologies .",
    "this argues against the overdensity being simply due to stars tidally - stripped from the cluster . more evidence against such an association comes from examining the kinematics of the stars in the g1 clump overdensity and in the cluster ( reitzel et al .",
    "2004 ; ibata et al .",
    "red giant stars in the g1 clump have radial velocities concentrated around @xmath15 , which differs considerably from the velocity of the g1 globular cluster itself ( 331 km s@xmath16 ( meylan et al .",
    "2001 ) ) .    to further investigate the nature and origin of the various substructures around m31 ,",
    "we have obtained deep photometry of ten fields using the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) on board the hst during cycles 11 and 13 .",
    "preliminary results for six of these fields ( including the g1 clump ) are presented in ferguson et al .",
    "our analysis revealed distinct morphological variations between many of the cmds , indicating age and metallicity variations within the substructure .",
    "this finding strongly suggests that not all stellar overdensities in the outskirts of m31 are derived from a single accretion event . in this paper",
    ", we present a detailed analysis of the g1 clump field , deriving new constraints on the origin of this feature and exploring its possible relation to the m31 outer disk .",
    "the g1 clump field is one of eight fields in the outer regions of m31 observed during cycle 11 with the acs wide field camera as part of go#9458 ( pi ferguson ) .",
    "another two substructure fields were observed in cycle 13 ( go#10128 ) .",
    "the acs wide field camera covers 202@xmath17202 arcsec on the sky which is equivalent to @xmath10.8@xmath170.8 kpc at the distance of m31 .",
    "the position of our acs g1 clump field was selected to coincide with the peak of the stellar overdensity ( see figure  [ fig : pointing ] ) .",
    "the field was observed for one orbit in the f606w filter ( broad @xmath18 ) and two orbits in the f814w filter ( @xmath19 ) , all within a single visit .",
    "integer pixel dithers were executed between multiple sub - exposures to aid warm pixel and cosmic ray rejection .",
    "final exposure times were 2430 s in f606w and 5150 s in f814w .",
    "we note that previous hst studies of this region have been based on fields lying at the very periphery of the stellar overdensity ( rich et al .",
    "1996 , 2004 ) .",
    "the images were first processed through the acs pipeline and then combined per passband using multidrizzle ( koekemoer et al .",
    "2002 ) within pyraf .",
    "we used the default mode of multidrizzle which calculates the offsets between dithered exposures using the information in the image header world coordinate system .",
    "we checked the accuracy of this method by measuring the alignment of the individual drizzled frames before the final combine operation .",
    "we found images taken in a given filter to be registered to better than 0.1 pixel .",
    "we also checked that the centers of stars were not being misidentified as cosmic rays , and no problems were noted . for the final drizzle , we used the lanczos3 kernel with ` pixfrac ` and ` scale ` set to unity .",
    "photometry was obtained using the iraf implementation of daophot ( stetson 1987 ) .",
    "the stellar density in the g1 field is low enough to allow precise results from aperture photometry alone .",
    "an aperture radius of 2 pixels was found to give the best results ( i.e. the tightest cmd ) .",
    "psf - fitting photometry was also carried out in order to reject non - stellar objects such as background galaxies , and cosmic rays which were not previously eliminated .",
    "a spatially - invariant psf was created for each filter using the @xmath1150 brightest stars on the combined images .",
    "after psf - fitting , sources were retained in the final photometry list if their magnitude errors , sharpness and @xmath20 values all lay within 3-sigma of the average value at their magnitude .",
    "final aperture photometry was then re - run on the cleaned star list .",
    "aperture corrections were derived as follow .",
    "the corrections from 2 to 4 pixel aperture radii were found from the average of several tens of bright stars on each frame .",
    "no significant variation in the aperture correction over the frame was found . in order to get good signal - to - noise , the aperture correction from 4 to 8 pixels",
    "was found using the psf template star .",
    "finally the photometry was corrected from 8 pixel to ` infinite ' aperture using the tabulated values given in table 3 in sirianni et al .",
    "table  [ tab : photcal ] summarises the aperture correction values used . as a further test that there was no systematic variation of the photometry across the acs field , we produced colour magnitude diagrams in different sub - regions of the chip .",
    "we found that these were identical , with no detectable variation in position or colour of the morphological features observed .",
    "the photometry was placed on the vegamag system using the values given in table 10 of sirianni et al .",
    "we adopted a reddening in the g1 clump field of e(@xmath21 ) = 0.06 ( schlegel et al .",

    "at a few points in the analysis , we require johnson - cousins magnitudes ( referred to as @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) in order to be able to compare to models in the literature .",
    "these are obtained using the calibration presented in sirianni et al .",
    "the transformation equations have the following form for ( @xmath28 ) @xmath10 0.4 :    @xmath29    @xmath30    where m@xmath31 = @xmath22 26.398 and m@xmath32 = @xmath23 25.501 ( i.e. zero point subtracted magnitudes ) .",
    "@xmath18 and @xmath19 are obtained by iterating the equation above until convergence is reached ( @xmath1 10 iterations ) .",
    "an initial estimate of ( @xmath28 ) = @xmath22 @xmath23was used . as discussed in sirianni et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , errors of a few percent can be introduced by making this transformation .",
    "completeness tests were carried out separately for each filter .",
    "the artificial stars used in the completeness tests were created using the psfs described above .",
    "the completeness value for a given magnitude was calculated by adding approximately 1500 artificial stars with that magnitude to the image , and then running the same photometric pipeline as used for the data ( e.g.  detection , aperture photometry , psf fitting and pruning , and final aperture photometry ) .",
    "the final completeness value is then the percentage of the input stars which are recovered .",
    "completeness tests were carried out at a number of magnitudes spanning the entire magnitude range in the data .",

    ".aperture corrections and zeropoints used in photometric calibration [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     our final model of the g1 clump field is a combination of the bp model in figure  [ fig : bpiso ] and the rgb model with a pure age spread shown in figure  [ fig : rcmultiplot]d and in figure  [ fig : rgb_models]b .",
    "this model contains populations of ages 0.2510  gyr at a uniform metallicity of [ m / h]@xmath33 .",
    "we stress again that our aim has not been to produce a high precision star formation history of the g1 clump , but rather to come up with a simple model that can reproduce the detailed morphology of the cmd and thus yield insight into the nature of the constituent populations .",
    "we have previously commented on the fact that a small metallicity range could be present and still be consistent with the observed cmd .",
    "likewise , we have no way to constrain the presence of an additional component with ages @xmath34  gyr .",
    "figure 11 shows that our model cmd is in very good qualitative and quantitative agreement with the observations .",
    "table  [ tab : model ] shows the ages and masses in each component of the model ; the bulk of the stars have ages @xmath5  gyr , however @xmath35% of the mass is contained in a population younger than 2  gyr .",
    "figure  [ fig : lffinalmodel ] shows the corresponding lf for the model compared to that observed for the g1 clump .",
    "the model lf is in excellent agreement with the data along the entire rgb .",
    "a small deviation can be seen at @xmath23@xmath36 @xmath1 23 where the model fails to reproduce in detail the agb bump . when more stars are added into the model , an agb bump is produced at the correct position .",
    "the problem therefore is that the model agb bump is weaker than the observed bump .",
    "this problem was also seen in the modelling of gallart ( 1998 )    for simplicity the analysis presented here has assumed no @xmath37-enhancement .",
    "the effect of @xmath37-enhancement has however been thoroughly investigated using the isochrones described in salasnich et al .",
    "introducing @xmath37-enhancement has the effect of increasing the derived metallicity from [ m / h ] @xmath10.4 ( non @xmath37-enhanced ) to [ m / h ] @xmath10.0 ( @xmath37-enhanced ) , but does not alter the derived age spread .",
    "our deep cmd analysis of the g1 clump suggests a constituent population characterised by a relatively high mean metallicity ( [ m / h]@xmath38 ) and an age range of at least 0.2510 gyr . in our model ,",
    "the bulk of the stellar mass is of age @xmath5  gyr .",
    "such a population represents a continuous , albeit declining , star formation history over at least 10  gyr with only a mild amount of associated chemical evolution .",
    "the presence of a young - to - intermediate age component in the vicinity of g1 was suggested in the wfpc2 studies of rich et al .",
    "our deeper acs cmd has provided conclusive evidence for this population and quantified its significance .",
    "the metallicity we derive for the bulk population in the g1 clump is significantly higher than values found in earlier studies .",
    "rich et al . ( 2004 ) find a metallicity of [ fe / h ] @xmath1 0.7 dex , which can be taken as [ m / h ] on the assumption of [ @xmath37/fe]@xmath39 .",
    "we believe this difference can largely be explained by the presence of an age range within the g1 clump field .",
    "if the metallicity is derived assuming a uniformly old stellar population ( i.e. by comparison with galactic globular cluster fiducials or old isochrones ) , a lower metallicity will be found .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : cmdiso ] where it can be seen that a change in age from 12 gyr to 4 gyr will change the derived metallicity by @xmath1 0.3 dex , or roughly the same difference between our value and that of rich et al .",
    "( 2004 ) .        the bp model in figure  [ fig : bpmodel ] can be used to estimate the total mass of the young population in the g1 clump field . assuming a salpeter imf with the exponent = and mass cut - off = 0.1 m@xmath40 , the total mass of our bp population in figure  [ fig : bpmodel ] is approximately 3 @xmath17 10@xmath41 m@xmath40 .",
    "the 1800 myr component comprises @xmath165% of the total mass .",
    "this translates to an average star formation rate of approximately 10@xmath42 m@xmath40/yr over the last 1.8 gyr .",
    "the morphology of the g1 clump ",
    "i.e. an irregular lump distinct from the main disk ( see figure 1 )  suggests it could be the remnant of an accreted dwarf galaxy .",
    "recent studies of rgb kinematics in this region have shown the g1 clump stars to have radial velocities similar but not identical to those of the rotating hi disk in m31 ( reitzel et al .",
    "2004 ; ibata et al .",
    "although this fact has been used to argue against the idea that the g1 clump is an accreted dwarf , it is possible that some satellites could be accreted on prograde coplanar orbits .",
    "indeed , some argue that the stellar overdensity seen in the milky way towards canis major may be an example of such an accretion event ( e.g. martin et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "it is therefore worthwhile investigating whether the stellar populations of the g1 clump could be consistent with a low mass satellite . at first glance",
    ", the g1 clump appears rather different to present - day dwarf spheroidal galaxies around the milky way and m31 , most of which show evidence for dominant old and metal - poor populations ( see e.g. dolphin et al .",
    "2005 ; da costa et al .",
    "the estimated absolute magnitude of the g1 clump is @xmath43 @xmath44 12.6 ( ferguson et al .",
    "local group dwarfs of this magnitude typically have 2 @xmath45 [ fe / h ] @xmath45 1.5 ( mateo 1998 ) , much more metal - poor than the g1 clump for which we find metallicity [ m / h ] @xmath1 0.4 dex .",
    "there are , however , a few examples of dsph galaxies which contain both young - to - intermediate age stars as well as stars with moderate metallicities . one of these is the fornax dwarf which contains a stellar population of mean age 5.4  gyr ( including stars as young as 0.2  gyr ) and with metallicities reaching to almost solar ( e.g. savianne et al .  2000 ; tolstoy et al .",
    "the other system is the sagittarius dwarf galaxy , which the milky way is currently in the process of accreting .",
    "analysis of the stellar content in the core of this galaxy reveals a dominant population of age @xmath46  gyr ( but lacking any very young stars ) and metallicity [ m / h]@xmath47 ( e.g. bellazzini et al .",
    "1999 ; monaco et al .",
    "2005 ) . in spite of the similarities in stellar",
    "content , the g1 clump remains distinct from these systems in terms of its size and surface brightness . at @xmath48  kpc , it is many times larger than the core diameters of either fornax or sagittarius and roughly 4 magnitudes fainter in peak surface brightness .",
    "it thus does not easily fit into the sequence of properties which characterize known dwarf galaxies .",
    "an additional argument against the dwarf galaxy hypothesis has been raised by ibata et al .",
    "they point out that the extent ( @xmath48  kpc ) and velocity dispersion of 30 km / s of the g1 clump would require a very considerable associated dark mass ( @xmath49  m@xmath50 ) in order to be bound .",
    "although we can not completely exclude this hypothesis with existing data , we conclude that the g1 clump is unlikely to be an accreted dwarf galaxy .",
    "another hypothesis for the g1 clump is that it is a perturbation of the m31 outer disk .",
    "our analysis of stellar populations in the g1 clump supports this idea on several grounds .",
    "first of all , we have demonstrated that the g1 clump has experienced continuous low - level star formation for most of the last 10  gyr .",
    "this implies a constant supply of gas , consistent with a location in the outer disk of m31 .",
    "indeed , carignan et al .",
    "( 2006 ) have shown that m31 s hi disk extends out to at least 35  kpc , well beyond the location of the g1 clump .",
    "the recent average star formation rate of 10@xmath42 m@xmath40/yr compares favourably with that determined for a location at 24  kpc in the outer disk by williams ( 2002)(see his figure 5(a ) ) .",
    "in addition , williams ( 2002 ) finds that the outer disk is characterised by a declining star formation rate , consistent with what we have found for the g1 clump .",
    "further support for this picture comes from comparing the metallicity of the m31 gas disk with the metallicity of stars in the g1 clump .",
    "the mean metallicity inferred for the g1 clump , [ m / h]@xmath38 dex , is rather high compared to that typically found in the outer regions of present - day gas disks ( e.g. ferguson et al .",
    "1998 ) . at face value",
    ", this might suggest that the g1 clump can not have formed from the gas disk in m31 .",
    "m31 is unusual , however , in having a high mean gas - phase metallicity and a rather flat gradient ( e.g. trundle et al .",
    "2002 ) . at a radius of 26  kpc ,",
    "the mean oxygen abundance in the disk as determined from hii regions is 40% solar ( ferguson & urquhart , in preparation ) . in order to compare the gas - phase",
    "[ o / h ] and the stellar [ fe / h ] abundances , we need to a adopt a value for [ o / fe ] .",
    "trundle et al .",
    "( 2002 ) have compiled [ o / fe ] and [ @xmath37/fe ] for supergiant stars in m31 and find that , within the errors , these values are consistent with being zero across the disk .",
    "this implies that [ m / h]@xmath51[fe / h]@xmath1[o / h]@xmath38 in the outer disk , and hence that stellar metallicity of the g1 clump is in excellent agreement with the extrapolation of the m31 disk abundance gradient .",
    "while it may not strictly be correct to compare the present - day metallicity of the gas disk with that of stars which formed several gyr ago , the low star formation rate inferred for the g1 clump implies that , in the absence of gas flows , little chemical evolution will have taken place in this region , even over long periods .",
    "this is supported by the small spread in metallicities inferred from our modelling .",
    "we note that the high mean metallicity inferred for this region indicates a significant amount of pre - enrichment before the onset of star formation .",
    "finally , the overall morphology of the g1 clump shows some similarities ( e.g. rgb and rc morphology ) to several other fields that lie at large radius along the major axis in m31 ( e.g. ferguson & johnson 2001 ; ferguson et al .  2005 ) suggesting that all may sample the same structure .",
    "although the strength of the bp is observed to vary between some of these fields , this may simply reflect local variations in the recent star formation rate .",
    "for example , the field observed by ferguson & johnson ( 2001 ) shows a fainter and sparser bp than the g1 clump field despite lying at a similar distance along the major axis .",
    "on the other hand , the ferguson & johnson ( 2001 ) field lies along the north - eastern major axis in a region where the gas disk severely warps away from the disk plane . as a result",
    ", the recent star formation history of this field may well be different from outer disk fields which lie within the main gas disk .",
    "on the other hand , the fact that the old and intermediate - age populations in these two fields share similar properties may provide further evidence that the outer regions of the m31 disk have been in place for a significant time , contrary to some theoretical expectations ( e.g. abadi et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "if the g1 clump does represent the outer disk , we require an explanation for its appearance as a distinct overdensity detached from the main body of m31 .",
    "n - body simulations indicate that the outer regions of disks can suffer significant damage during minor mergers ( e.g. quinn et al .",
    "1993 ; walker et al .",
    "1996 ) . in these simulations ,",
    "the final disk possesses distinct lumpiness at large radius , consisting of stars which existed in the initial stellar disk as well as stars stripped off the accreted satellite .",
    "another possible scenario is a large merger , similar to that studied by springel & hernquist ( 2005 ) .",
    "they show that the remnant of a major merger between similar - sized gas disks could still retain some disk structure . in this scenario ,",
    "the outer disk will consist of stars formed after the merger in the resettled gas disk .",
    "the oldest stars in the outer disk would therefore date the merger event .",
    "in the case of the g1 clump , we have shown the oldest stars are at least 8 - 10 gyr and hence any significant merger of this sort must have happened a long time ago .",
    "the existence of copious substructure in the outskirts of m31 strongly supports the idea m31 has experienced at least one significant accretion event ( ferguson et al .",
    "2002 ) and hence the hypothesis that the g1 clump represents torn off disk appears viable . given the stellar population constraints derived here and the kinematical constraints derived elsewhere ( reitzel et al .",
    "2004 ; ibata et al .",
    "2005 ) , we strongly favour this hypothesis for the origin of the g1 clump .",

    "<S> if this interpretation is correct , our analysis of the stellar content provides further evidence that the outskirts of large disk galaxies have been in place for a significant time . </S>"
