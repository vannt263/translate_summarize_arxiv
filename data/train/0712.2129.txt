    "many graph models have been recently introduced for representing the structure and dynamics of real - life networks ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "their adequacy to data can be measured by comparing some properties of graphs , especially the degree distribution of the vertices , which is related to scale - free properties , and properties related to the `` small world '' effect , such as distance between pairs of vertices and grouping in clusters .",
    "the random apollonian networks ( ran ) proposed by @xcite provides a very interesting model , with a power - law degree distribution , a mean distance of logarithmic order and a large clustering coefficient .",
    "we introduced in @xcite a modified version , random apollonian network structures ( rans ) , which preserves the interesting properties of real graphs concerning degree distribution ( a power - law with an exponential cut - off ) and large clustering .",
    "this paper is devoted to the analysis of distances in rans , which is showed to be of square root order : we first characterize the distances from one special vertex to all the other vertices of the graph , and then work on the distances between pairs of vertices .",
    "a rans can be seen as a certain type of triangulation of a triangle , and the study of rans relies on the bijection with planar ternary trees ( see figure  [ fig : rans ] ) . from this bijection",
    "we can express the enumerative generating function for rans , and use multivariate functions for marking several distance parameters .",
    "moreover the asymptotic values of the quantities under consideration can be dealt with using singularity analysis ( according to methods developed in @xcite ) .",
    "we are interested in two types of parameters measuring distance , and develop two methods to handle them .",
    "we first attack the distances between a special vertex ( an outermost vertex a of the rans ) and all the other vertices .",
    "the method is built on computing a generating function with infinitely many variables , that contains all informations concerning distances from a to the other vertices .",
    "distribution analysis is based on the study of partial derivatives of this multivariate series , which correspond to the series counting the number of vertices at a certain distance from a. these series all express in terms of the generating function for rans and asymptotic analysis gives a distribution with a mean value of order @xmath2 .",
    "the second study addresses the total distance between all pairs of vertices .",
    "we exhibit a generating function in four variables that expresses simultaneously distances from one , two or three outermost vertices .",
    "this generating function has a nice recursive definition , due to the symmetries of the problem .",
    "it contains all information to compute the total distance between pairs of vertices .",
    "geometrical considerations splits this total distance in two parts , depending on whether a path between two vertices spans over disjoints sub - rans or not .",
    "the resulting mean distance between two vertices is of order @xmath3 .",
    "this paper divides in four sections : this introduction , followed by a section that recalls the definition of random apollonian network structures , the bijection with ternary trees , and the result for degree distribution .",
    "section 3 describes the distribution of distances from an outermost vertex and section 4 is dedicated to the study of the total distance between all pairs of vertices .",
    "the recursive definition of rans shows a one - to - one correspondence with ternary trees .",
    "the degree distribution , which is a power law with an exponential cut - off , was studied in @xcite by considering bivariate series marking the corresponding parameter in trees .      a random apollonian network structure ( rans ) @xmath4",
    "is recursively defined as : either an empty triangle or a triangle @xmath5 split in three parts , by placing a vertex @xmath6 inside @xmath5 and connect it to the three vertices of the triangle ; each sub - triangle being substituted by a rans ( see figure  [ fig : rans ] ) .",
    "the vertices of @xmath5 will be called the _ outermost vertices _ of @xmath4 ( noted @xmath7 ) ; and vertex @xmath6 will be called the _ center _ of @xmath4 .",
    "we will note @xmath8 the class of all rans .",
    "the _ order _ of the empty rans is zero and the order of a non - empty rans is one plus the sum of the orders of the three sub - rans .",
    "[ prop : bij ] @xcite there is a bijection between random apollonian network structures of order @xmath9 and rooted plane ternary trees of size @xmath9 ( with @xmath9 internal nodes ) .    in planar ternary trees ,",
    "the linear ordering of siblings is relevant .",
    "this order is carried over to triangles : naming @xmath10 the vertices of @xmath7 , imposes a linear ordering on the sub - rans ( @xmath11 ) : @xmath12 will be the one not containing @xmath13 . recursively replacing the missing outermost vertex by the center of @xmath4",
    "preserves the order in sub - rans .    the generating function for ternary trees @xmath14 satisfies the functional equation @xmath15",
    ", whose solution can be analysed locally through singularity analysis .",
    "@xmath16 has radius of convergence @xmath17 and singular value @xmath18 ; and the singular expansion of @xmath19 near @xmath20 is @xmath21 thus the asymptotic form of the coefficients : @xmath22 , with @xmath23 .",
    "the derivative @xmath24 will also appear in the computations below .",
    "the leading term in its singular expansion is @xmath25 , thus a coefficient @xmath26 of asymptotic order @xmath27 .",
    "the degree distribution in random apollonian network structures follows a power law with an exponential cutoff .",
    "this is obtained by analysing the degree of the center of a rans ( which corresponds to the size of a binary subtree at the root of the corresponding ternary tree ) , and propagating this study to the whole of the sub - rans .",
    "the bivariate generating function marking the degree of the center is @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the bivariate generating function for ternary trees with @xmath30 marking the size of the underlying binary subtree , which is also the degree of an outermost vertex : @xmath31    [ th : degree ] @xcite the degree distribution in random apollonian network structures follows a power law with an exponential cutoff : @xmath32 , with @xmath33 .",
    "this section is devoted to computing the distribution of the distances from a fixed specific outermost vertex .",
    "we introduce a generating function with infinitely many variables , each variable @xmath34 marking the number of vertices at distance @xmath35 from the outermost vertex .",
    "relying on the symmetries of the problem and the recursive nature of rans , we are able to express and study this generating function .",
    "the interest of this analysis is not only to find , with a different method , some results of the following section ; but moreover this study can be adapted to compute the distribution of distances to _ any distinguished vertex _ in a rans , which may be considered as a more realistic parameter .      due to the recursive nature of rans , we often have to consider a rans @xmath4 as having an _ environment _ , that is a bigger rans containing @xmath4 .",
    "given a rans @xmath4 , the distance of any of its vertices to a vertex @xmath6 in the environment of @xmath4 is determined by the three distances of the elements of @xmath7 to @xmath6 .",
    "since the outermost vertices of @xmath4 form a clique , their distances to any vertex can not differ by more than one .",
    "this observation allows us to reduce our study to a few cases .",
    "first we work modulo a translation and restrict ourselves to the case when the three distances to @xmath7 are either @xmath36 or @xmath37 .",
    "second we can work modulo a permutation and restrict ourselves to only three cases : @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , illustrated in figure  [ fig : types ] .",
    "these three cases actually correspond to labelling the internal vertices of @xmath4 by their distances either to one ( out of three ) , or to two ( out of three ) or to all three outermost vertices .",
    "[ def : label ] the _ @xmath41-labeling _ of @xmath42 consists in putting on each vertex a label corresponding to its distance from @xmath43 ( or equivalently to one of any @xmath44 ) :    @xmath45    the outermost vertices @xmath46 respectively receive labels @xmath37 , @xmath36 and @xmath36 ;    the center of @xmath47 is labeled by 1 plus the minimum of the labels of @xmath48 .",
    "[ def : type ] let s define the _ type of @xmath42 _ as the set of labels of @xmath7 .",
    "we say that    @xmath45    two rans types are _ equivalent _ iff they have the same type up to a permutation .",
    "two rans types are _ translated _ by @xmath49 iff their labellings are the same up to a translation @xmath49 .     and their sub - rans . ]    in a rans @xmath4 of type @xmath38 the center gets label 1 .",
    "thus @xmath4 is equivalent to @xmath50 and @xmath51 , but it is not equivalent to @xmath52 , which is of type @xmath53 : if a vertex is at distance @xmath54 from @xmath55 , its distance from @xmath43 is @xmath56 .",
    "this remark leads to the bivariate generating function for rans marked with vertices at distance 1 from @xmath43 : @xmath57 this follows the recursive definition of rans , noticing first that the center is at distance @xmath36 from @xmath43 and second that the configuration is the same in @xmath50 and @xmath51 , whereas in @xmath52 there is no vertex at distance @xmath36 from @xmath43 .",
    "note that ( [ eqn : t1biv ] ) is obviously the same generating function as ( [ eqn : tdegbiv ] ) , the degree of a vertex being exactly the number of vertices at distance @xmath36 from this vertex .    the problem of marking _ both _ vertices at distance 1 and 2 from @xmath43 is treated in the same way : the configuration of @xmath4 , of type @xmath38 , recursively occurs in @xmath50 and @xmath51 , which are of the same type .",
    "but the case of @xmath52 , of type @xmath53 , is a little more tricky and requires a deeper decomposition .",
    "if @xmath52 is not empty , its center is at distance 2 from @xmath43 , and its three sub - rans @xmath58 are equivalent , of type @xmath59 : either they are empty , or their center is at distance 2 from @xmath43 , one sub - rans is of type @xmath59 , equivalent to @xmath58 and the two others are of type @xmath60 , translated by 1 with @xmath4 , which means that the number of their vertices at distance 2 from @xmath43 in is the same as the number of vertices at distance 1 from @xmath43 in @xmath4 .",
    "this decomposition leads to the following functional equations , with @xmath61 marking vertices at distance @xmath62 from @xmath43 : @xmath63    it is easy to show that the same equations hold for @xmath64 , when considering multivariate generating functions @xmath65 , with @xmath61 marking vertices at distance @xmath62 from @xmath43 , and we get the following result .",
    "[ proposition : recursg ] let @xmath66 be the number of rans of order @xmath0 with @xmath67 vertices at distance @xmath62 from @xmath68 . then @xmath69 is the coefficient of @xmath70 in the multivariate series @xmath71 , where the series @xmath72 satisfy the recurrence relations : @xmath73 and for @xmath74 , @xmath75    the sequence @xmath76 converges to a function @xmath77 which contains all information concerning distances from vertex @xmath68 :    @xmath45    the enumerative series for the number of vertices at distance @xmath35 from @xmath68 , over all rans , is @xmath78    the asymptotic of the total distance from @xmath68 expresses as @xmath79    the aim of the next paragraph is to evaluate these quantities .",
    "generating functions counting the number of vertices at distance @xmath35 from @xmath80 express as rational functions in @xmath81 and @xmath16 , and have a singular behaviour similar to @xmath16 : radius of convergence @xmath20 , and singular expansion of the square - root type .",

    "however we did nt use it since it usually hides the combinatorial interpretation of the generating functions under consideration .",

    "the singular expansions only differ on their second term .",
    "we first consider the pairs @xmath106 such that there exists a sub - rans @xmath109 of @xmath4 with @xmath6 an outermost and @xmath110 an internal vertex of @xmath109 .",
