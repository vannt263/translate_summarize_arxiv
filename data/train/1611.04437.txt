    "is purely imaginary , so that the relative phase is @xmath157 , and the total br amounts to ( ) _ imaginary= ( 163)10 ^ -5 . in summary , our main result is the definition of the procedure to compute the imaginary part of the amplitude .",
    "it relies in the possibility of relating the @xmath158 decay rate , @xmath21 stands for a hadronic state , to the rates of the `` intermediate '' radiative decays @xmath54 and @xmath159 , where @xmath51 ( @xmath160 , @xmath161 ,  ) are pseudoscalar light mesons .",
    "in such a way , using as input the experimental brs of the intermediate processes , the procedure automatically provides a phenomenological explanation for the validity of the @xmath162-dominance hypothesis .",
    "if , for a particular -violating decay @xmath158 , there exists a set @xmath163 of pseudoscalar mesons with sizable rates @xmath164 and @xmath165 , then the amplitude @xmath166 will be of the same order of @xmath167 , i.e. , there will be a violation of the @xmath28-dominance rule . + for instance , in the studied case with @xmath168 , we have considered two mesons @xmath57 and @xmath58 , because the intermediate processes have large couplings , as indeed , can be verified by considering the products of the corresponding brs  @xcite ( ) ( ) & & 210 ^ -4 , + ( )( ) & & 310 ^ -4 .",
    "it appears quite evident that , in the case of @xmath169 , the @xmath170 will be largely suppressed having ( )(2 ( ) ) & & 10 ^ -5 , the case @xmath57 is not considered because , being @xmath171 , the radiative decay @xmath172 is forbidden . + in principle",
    "the proposed procedure could be used to compute the amplitude  of all quarkonium decays in which  is violated . however , at higher masses , like those of bottomonia , the contribution  becomes almost negligible because @xmath173 and  is proportional to the cross section @xmath5 which vanishes like @xmath174 as @xmath97 diverges .",
