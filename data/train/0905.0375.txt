    "the assembly of protein building blocks into a shell or ` capsid ' is essential for viral replication and thus understanding the mechanisms by which assembly proceeds could identify targets or opportunities for novel antiviral therapies .",

    "the kinetics for spontaneous capsid assembly in vitro have been measured with size exclusion chromatography ( sec ) and dynamic light scattering ( e.g. @xcite ) , but extracting mechanistic information such as the critical nucleus size or the time to assemble an individual capsid has been challenging . in this article , we theoretically examine two models for capsid assembly kinetics to show that these properties can be determined from the concentration dependence of median assembly times and the lag phase .",

    "zlotnick and coworkers @xcite showed that partial capsid intermediates assemble during the lag phase , but it has often been assumed that the duration of the lag phase corresponds to the time required for the concentration of critical nuclei to reach steady state , in analogy to models of actin nucleation . however ,",
    "in this work we show that because light scatter signal measures the mass - averaged molecular weight of assemblages @xcite and sec usually monitors complete capsids , the length of the lag phase is related to the elongation time , or the time required for a nucleated partial capsid to grow to completion .",
    "similarly , the critical nucleus size can not be reliably determined from the concentration dependence of initial or maximum growth rates @xcite , and a method to do so using the extent of assembly @xcite is data - intensive .",
    "we demonstrate that the critical nucleus size can be identified in a straightforward manner from the concentration dependence of the median assembly time .",

    "nucleation is usually assumed to correspond to completion of a polygon ( e.g. a pentamer of dimers for ccmv @xcite or a trimer of dimers for turnip crinkle virus @xcite ) and could include intertwining of flexible terminal arms as well as subunit conformation changes . in this work we use @xmath15 . in zlotnick and coworkers formulation ,",

    "[ fig : timeplots]b , the calculated light scatter closely tracks the completion fraction for initial subunit concentrations below @xmath63 m , since the majority of assembled subunits are found in complete capsids once the lag phase is complete .",

    "[ fig : lagtime ] , lag times are extracted from numerical solutions for each parameter set with a linear fit to the assembly trace at the point of maximal assembly rate ( @xmath64 or @xmath65 ) . the lag time is given by the intersection of the linear fit with the baseline value , which is 0 for the completion fraction and roughly @xmath66 for calculated light scatter .",
    "note that for initial subunit concentrations below @xmath49 , lag times for both the completion fraction and calculated light scatter are inversely proportional to @xmath25 , and the mean first passage time estimate ( eq .",
    "[ eq : mfpt ] ) for the capsid elongation phase @xmath29 closely predicts the lag time for completion fractions .",
    "the lag time for light scatter is shorter than for the completion fraction because signal is integrated over all of assemblages , but demonstrates the same scaling .",
    "hence , for this model , lag times measured for @xmath59 ( sec ) or light scattering are associated with the elongation phase , or the time required to build a complete capsid . this correspondence begins to break down at the crossover concentration @xmath49 ( eq .  [ eq : ckt ] ) , when the concentration of free subunits is depleted before the first capsids finish assembling . above this point ,",
    "the molecular weight average growth rate becomes dominated by dimerization and hence varies inversely with the square of initial subunit concentration .",
    "the relationship between the lag time and the elongation phase of capsid assembly discovered here explains the observation of endres and zlotnick @xcite that the duration of lag time is proportional to the elongation forward rate constant .",

    "the fact that assembly times can be predicted from nucleation kinetics alone can be understood by noting that the elongation time is negligible compared to the overall assembly time below @xmath49 .",
    "the close correspondence between the theoretical and numerical median assembly times below @xmath49 suggests that this quantity may provide a simple alternative to the critical nucleus estimator presented in the appendix of ref .",

    "as anticipated , the kinetic trap point @xmath50 roughly corresponds to the point at which the time to build the capsid becomes longer than the average nucleation time ( eq .",

    "assembly eventually occurs above @xmath50 as large partial capsids scavenge subunits from smaller intermediates .",
    "however , we caution that alternative capsid morphologies @xcite and/or malformed capsids @xcite , which are not considered in these models , may occur at binding free energies and subunit concentrations above @xmath50 .    as evident from eq .",
    "[ eq : halftime ] , the critical nucleus size can also be identified by evaluating @xmath69 as a function of the subunit - subunit association free energy @xmath70 .",

    "[ fig : cnuccscaling ] the lag phase for both quantities lies close to the random walk estimate for the elongation time ( eq .  [ eq : mfpt ] ) .",

    "in this work we examine two theoretical models for capsid assembly , for which we find that the duration of the lag phase measured by sec or dynamic light scatter is related to the time for a nucleated capsid to grow to completion , and hence scales inversely with initial subunit concentration . when nucleation of new partial capsids is faster than this growth time , the system becomes kinetically trapped due to starvation of free subunits , meaning that capsid formation rates decreases with increasing initial subunit concentration .",
    "if there is a well - defined critical nucleus size , it can be identified from the scaling of the median assembly time with respect to initial subunit concentration .",
    "although highly simplified , the nucleation and growth model we consider here has been shown to closely resemble experimental capsid assembly data @xcite and our findings therefore suggest new approaches to analyzing and interpreting experimental data to characterize assembly mechanisms .",
    "these predictions have important implications for obtaining mechanistic information about capsid elongation ( growth after nucleation ) from bulk in vitro assembly kinetics experiments .",
    "the fact that overall reaction times are closely predicted by an expression based solely on nucleation kinetics ( eq .  [ eq : halftime ] , fig .",

    "in fact , the preceding analysis demonstrates that the average elongation time and hence the average growth velocity during elongation are directly related to the duration of the lag phase .",
    "additional mechanistic information about the elongation process could be obtained if the distribution of growth times could be deconvolved from the distribution of nucleation times .",

    "this constraint could potentially be overcome in several ways .",
    "the distribution of elongation times can be directly measured in experiments that monitor the assembly of individual capsids , since the elongation and nucleation phases can be separated @xcite .",

    "thus , experimental systems in which capsid assembly is induced by nucleic acids @xcite , synthetic polymers @xcite , nanoparticles @xcite , and portal or scaffolding proteins @xcite could be used to elucidate elongation mechanisms ( although assembly mechanisms can be influenced by the heterogeneous component @xcite ) .",
    "finally , we note that processes not considered in this work , such as transitions between assembly active and assembly inactive conformations of free subunits @xcite or hierarchical assembly @xcite would add additional complexity to analysis of the lag phase .",
