    "<S> we present results from comprehensive event - driven ( ed ) simulations of nonlinear pattern formation in freely - evolving granular gases . in particular , we focus on the the morphologies of density and velocity fields in the inhomogeneous cooling state ( ics ) . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize the strong analogy between the ics morphologies and pattern formation in phase ordering systems with a globally conserved order parameter .    </S>",
    "<S> there has been much recent interest in the properties of powders or granular materials @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these materials are of great scientific and technological relevance and display properties intermediate to those of solids and fluids . </S>",
    "<S> perhaps the most relevant feature of powders is that the grains dissipate energy on collision . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , granular materials exhibit interesting dynamical properties only when the collisional energy loss is compensated by a continuous input of energy @xcite .    it is also relevant to investigate the dynamical evolution of a freely - evolving homogeneous system of inelastic granular particles . in the initial stages , the system continuously loses energy in a homogeneous cooling state ( hcs ) , where the density field is approximately uniform @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the hcs is unstable to density fluctuations , and the system evolves into an inhomogeneous cooling state ( ics ) , where particle - rich clusters are formed and grow @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there is a good understanding of the hcs and the instabilities which result in the ics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , there is only a limited understanding of the nonlinear evolution of the ics @xcite . in this letter , we study nonlinear domain growth processes for the granular density and velocity fields in the asymptotic time - regime . </S>",
    "<S> we present results from comprehensive event - driven ( ed ) simulations for a wide range of inelasticity and density parameters . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we invoke analogies from studies of phase ordering dynamics @xcite to obtain a _ quantitative _ characterization of the evolving morphologies in the ics . </S>",
    "<S> the similarities between freely - evolving granular gases and phase ordering systems have been briefly discussed by van noije , ernst and co - authors @xcite , and baldassari _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> of course , we stress that the mechanisms driving pattern evolution are very different in both cases .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider a system of identical inelastic hard spheres ( with mass @xmath0 and diameter @xmath1 ) in a @xmath2 box of size @xmath3 , with periodic boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> there is no external input of energy in our simulations . </S>",

    "<S> , we have the coefficient of restitution @xmath10 . for granular materials , @xmath11 in general .    </S>",
    "<S> the initial condition for each run consisted of @xmath12 particles with a homogeneous spatial distribution and a maxwellian velocity distribution . </S>",

    "<S> numerical data are obtained for the following parameter sets : ( i ) @xmath16 ( or @xmath17 ) , and @xmath18 ranging from 0.80 to 0.975 in steps of 0.025 ; ( ii ) @xmath19 , and @xmath12 ranging from 10000 to 40000 in steps of 5000 , i.e. , @xmath20 to 0.61 . </S>",
    "<S> we characterize the dynamical evolution of the granular gas using various statistical quantities , which are calculated as an average over 5 independent runs , i.e. , correlation functions , structure factors , and domain growth laws for the density and velocity fields .    for early times </S>",
    "<S> , inelastic collisions result in cooling as @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the temperature at time @xmath23 ; @xmath24 ; and @xmath25 is the collision frequency at temperature @xmath26 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the form of @xmath25 is approximately determined from the enskog theory for elastic hard spheres as @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the granular temperature at @xmath29 . this yields haff s cooling law for the hcs @xcite as @xmath30^{-2 } = t_0 e^{-\\frac{\\epsilon}{d } \\tau}$ ] , where @xmath31 is the average number of collisions per particle upto time @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> our subsequent results are presented in terms of @xmath32 , as this constitutes a reasonable measure of time in the present context . </S>",
    "<S> the values of @xmath32 are obtained directly from the ed simulations . </S>",
    "<S> we should stress that @xmath31 vs. @xmath23 fluctuates considerably for individual runs in the ics regime .    in fig . 1 </S>",
    "<S> , we show evolution snapshots for the @xmath2 granular gas with @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> the lhs and rhs frames refer to the coarse - grained velocity field @xmath34 and density field @xmath35 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the coarse - grained fields at a lattice point are obtained by averaging over boxes of size @xmath36 centered at that point . to clarify the nature of pattern formation </S>",
    "<S> , we have `` hardened '' the velocity field in fig . 1 , i.e. </S>",
    "<S> , the length of all vectors has been set to unity . </S>",
    "<S> points where the velocity field is zero , due to the absence of particles in the coarse - graining box , are unmarked in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 . the density field on the rhs of fig . 1 is depicted in a binary representation . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce the order parameter @xmath37 with values @xmath38 at points where the number density is larger ( less ) than the average number density .    the upper frames in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 correspond to @xmath39 and @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> the velocity field is characterized by the emergence and diffusive coarsening of vortices . </S>",
    "<S> there is a progressive parallelization of the local velocity field due to inelastic dissipation of the normal velocity components . </S>",
    "<S> however , as the total momentum is fixed at zero and the system is doubly - periodic , defects will be present in the velocity field for all times . </S>",
    "<S> typically , pattern evolution in the density field is slower than that for the velocity field @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , well - defined clusters corresponding to the ics are already seen at @xmath41 ( not shown here ) . </S>",
    "<S> these clusters grow with time in a manner reminiscent of phase ordering systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the vortex centers in the velocity field are also shown ( as black circles ) in the frame on the rhs . </S>",
    "<S> the vortex density diminishes with time , and vortices are primarily confined to regions of low density , as there is a rapid parallelization of velocities in the high - density ( solid - like ) region due to multiple collision processes . </S>",
    "<S> there is no strong correlation between the location of defects in the velocity field ( i.e. , vortices ) and defects in the density field ( i.e. , interfaces or domain boundaries ) . </S>",
    "<S> the middle frames in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 correspond to @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> the broad features are the same as those for @xmath39 , though the time - scales are slower . all time - scales for pattern formation diverge as @xmath42 , i.e. , the clustering instability is delayed for more elastic systems . </S>",
    "<S> the perfectly elastic case ( @xmath10 ) is singular , and does not exhibit clustering .    a coarse - grained description of the granular fluid is provided by nonlinear hydrodynamic equations for the density , velocity and temperature fields , in conjunction with an energy loss term @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> wakou _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ @xcite have shown that fluctuations in these quantities obey tdgl - like equations of phase ordering dynamics with a nonconserved order parameter @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> typically , these equations are obtained as the overdamped limit of a hamiltonian formulation . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we clarify the tdgl - description of granular dynamics .    </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of the density field is analogous to phase ordering dynamics in two - component ( ab ) mixtures , which is described by the equation @xcite : @xmath43,\\ ] ] where @xmath44 differentiates between @xmath45-rich ( @xmath46 ) and @xmath47-rich ( @xmath48 ) regions . </S>",
    "<S> eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ che ] ) with @xmath49 is the tdgl equation , and describes nonconserved systems . in this case , the coarsening system is characterized by a diffusive growth law , @xmath50 @xcite , where @xmath51 is the characteristic domain size at time @xmath23 . on the other hand , eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ che ] ) with @xmath0 is the cahn - hilliard ( ch ) equation , and describes conserved systems . in this case , the domain growth process obeys the lifshitz - slyozov ( ls ) law , @xmath52 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , there have also been studies of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ che ] ) with @xmath53 , which is referred to as the globally - conserved ( gc ) tdgl equation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this model is known to be in the same dynamical universality class as the nonconserved tdgl equation @xcite , with the difference that the initial composition is preserved in the gc - tdgl equation .    </S>",
    "<S> similarly , the evolution of the velocity field in the ics is comparable to ordering dynamics in the xy model , which is the vector version of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ che ] ) : @xmath54,\\ ] ] where @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ xym ] ) parallelizes @xmath56 locally via the annihilation of vortices and anti - vortices , driven by a surface - tension reduction mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ xym ] ) with @xmath49 corresponds to the case with nonconserved order parameter . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding domain growth law @xcite is @xmath57 . on the other hand , eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ xym ] ) with @xmath0 corresponds to the conserved xy model , where the dynamics locally conserves @xmath58 .    </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of the granular fluid conserves both the density and velocity fields . </S>",
    "<S> intuitively , one may expect that the analogous phase ordering models would be the conserved ( @xmath0 ) versions of eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ che])-([xym ] ) . however , the evolution morphologies in the upper and middle frames of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 are comparable to those for the case with nonconserved order parameter @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is a consequence of the non - diffusive dynamics of granular particles , which move in straight lines until they collide with other particles . in this collision , </S>",
    "<S> the density and momentum are conserved quantities , of course . however , depending on the density of the fluid , the distance traveled by particles prior to collision may be considerable . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the variables are conserved on the macroscopic length - scale of the mean - free path , and not on the microscopic length - scale of the lattice spacing . </S>",
    "<S> now , the ics consists of regions of high density and low density . </S>",
    "<S> granular particles stream relatively unhindered through the low - density regions and deposit on distant clusters . typically , the conservation length scale is comparable to the length scale of the coarsening clusters , which diverges in time . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the density and velocity fields are globally conserved ( gc ) , rather than locally conserved . to elucidate this analogy , the lower lhs frame in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 shows the velocity field from the gc - xy model with @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> the lower rhs frame in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 shows the density field for the gc - tdgl model with @xmath60 , corresponding to an average density of @xmath61 .    before we quantify the morphologies in fig . 1 </S>",
    "<S> , we would like to study the hcs @xmath62 ics crossover time . </S>",
    "<S> brito and ernst @xcite use mode - coupling techniques to obtain the asymptotic energy decay ( in the ics ) as @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 , with @xmath66 being the time - independent mean - free path . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison of haff s law and eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ mode ] ) yields the crossover time @xmath67 as the solution of @xmath68 where @xmath69 , and @xmath70 is the @xmath71-dimensional solid angle . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the case @xmath72 , so that @xmath73 . for @xmath2 , </S>",
    "<S> eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ tauc ] ) simplifies as @xmath74 , where we ignore prefactors . </S>",
    "<S> we use the verlet - levesque approximation for the @xmath2 hard - sphere correlation function at contact , viz . , @xmath75 . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) , we plot @xmath76 vs. @xmath67 for @xmath77 and a range of @xmath18-values . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(b ) , we plot @xmath78 vs. @xmath79 for @xmath19 and a range of @xmath80-values . </S>",
    "<S> these approximately linear plots confirm the validity of the scaling behavior of @xmath81 , as expected from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ tauc ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> next , we examine the time - dependent structure factors of the density and velocity fields in the ics . the evolving morphologies are characterized by unique length scales , and we expect the structure factors to exhibit dynamical scaling , i.e. , @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the relevant length scale and @xmath84 is a scaling function @xcite . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(a ) , we plot the scaled structure factors of the density field for @xmath85 , i.e. , @xmath86 $ ] vs. @xmath87 from three different times ( @xmath88 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the quantity @xmath89 is the first moment of the structure factor , and is related to the length scale as @xmath90 . </S>",
    "<S> the reasonable data collapse confirms the validity of dynamical scaling . the dashed line in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(a ) denotes the fourier transform of the analytic result due to ohta _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ ( ojk ) @xcite for the correlation function of the nonconserved tdgl equation : @xmath91 , where @xmath92 . </S>",
    "<S> the ojk function provides an excellent description of our numerical data . the dot - dashed line in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(a ) is obtained from a numerical simulation of the ch equation with @xmath93 . </S>",
    "<S> the ch result is at variance with our numerical results except for the tail region . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the local conservation law dictates that @xmath94 as @xmath95 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the ics structure factor appears to decay almost monotonically from @xmath96 , as is usual for structure factors in ordering problems characterized by a nonconserved order parameter . </S>",
    "<S> ( of course , global density conservation dictates that @xmath97 . ) </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(b ) is analogous to 3(a ) , but corresponds to the case with @xmath98 .    </S>",
    "<S> we have confirmed numerically that the scaled structure factor for the density field in the ics has only a weak dependence on the off - criticality @xmath99 , which measures the average density . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it is numerically comparable to the ojk function for a broad range of @xmath99-values . </S>",
    "<S> the nature of defects in the ordering field dictates some general properties of the structure factor . </S>",
    "<S> for example , scattering off interfaces in the density field gives rise to a power - law ( or porod ) decay in the structure factor tail , @xmath100 for large @xmath101 @xcite , which is seen clearly in figs . </S>",
    "<S> 3(a)-(b ) .    </S>",
    "<S> in figs . </S>",
    "<S> 4(a)-(b ) , we plot scaled structure factors , @xmath102 $ ] vs. @xmath87 , for the velocity field in the ics . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed line denotes the fourier transform of the bray - puri - toyoki ( bpt ) function for ordering in the nonconserved xy model @xcite : @xmath103 ^ 2 f\\left(\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2};\\frac{n+2}{2};\\gamma^2\\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath104 ; @xmath105 is the beta function ; and @xmath106 is the hypergeometric function . </S>",
    "<S> the bpt result corresponds to defects with @xmath107 symmetry , and the case with @xmath108 is relevant here . </S>",
    "<S> again , we see that our numerical data is described well by the bpt function , and is completely different from the result for the conserved xy model ( obtained numerically , and denoted as a dot - dashed line in figs . </S>",
    "<S> 4(a)-(b ) ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we have seen that vortex defects characterize the morphology of the ics velocity field . </S>",
    "<S> these vortices give rise to a power - law decay for the structure factor tail , @xmath109 for large @xmath101 . </S>",
    "<S> the general bpt result in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ bpt ] ) exhibits a power - law tail , @xmath110 , and is relevant for the ics in granular systems with @xmath111 .    for the time - regimes considered here , </S>",
    "<S> a description in terms of two uncoupled order parameters is reasonable . </S>",
    "<S> a more complete description of the asymptotic ordering dynamics should account for _ holes _ in the velocity field due to absence of particles in some regions of space . </S>",
    "<S> this is provided by a model with spin - vacancy phase separation in conjunction with xy - like ordering of the spin variable . in the current context </S>",
    "<S> , the relevant model has coupled nonconserved ( or globally conserved ) dynamics for the two ordering fields . at a later stage </S>",
    "<S> , we will discuss in detail the applicability of this model to the ics .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we would like to briefly discuss domain growth laws in the ics . we should stress that late - stage dynamics is affected by inelastic collapse , where a group of particles undergo an infinite number of collisions in a finite time @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the results discussed here correspond to the regime prior to inelastic collapse . </S>",
    "<S> subsequent to the hcs @xmath62 ics crossover , our numerical results ( not shown here ) are consistent with diffusive growth , @xmath112 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , our numerical data is consistent with an asymptotic power - law behavior , @xmath113 , for a wide range of parameter values . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in real time , the length scales behave as @xmath114 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the domain growth law for the ics density field is the same as the ls growth law for phase separation of binary mixtures .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have undertaken comprehensive ed simulations of nonlinear pattern formation in the density and velocity fields of an inelastic granular gas . </S>",
    "<S> we find that there is a close analogy between ics morphologies and phase ordering systems with globally conserved order parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the nature of defects in the ordering fields dictates general properties of the relevant structure factors and correlation functions . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , our numerical results for the structure factors of the ics density and velocity fields are described well by analytic results for nonconserved phase ordering systems . clearly , the general formalism of phase ordering dynamics is of great utility in diverse problems of pattern formation as many features of evolution morphologies are determined by general principles , e.g. , defect structures , conservation laws , etc . </S>",
