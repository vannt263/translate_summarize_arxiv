    "this observation allows us to apply the `` low - weight cusp form trick '' of gritsenko , hulek and sankaran (  [ ss : lowweightcusp ] ) , and thus reduce theorem  [ thm : mainthm ] to finding a single cusp form of weight @xmath79 and character @xmath80 , with respect to the group @xmath77 , that vanishes along the ramification divisor of the modular projection @xmath81 .",
    "there is a strategy , originating in work of kond  @xcite and brought to maturity in  @xcite , to find the needed low - weight cusp form .",

    "there is a lattice isomorphism @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is the rank three lattice of signature @xmath110 with intersection pairing given by @xmath111 ( see   [ s : thelattice ] ) .",
    "results of nikulin reduce problem  [ prod : embedding ] to embedding @xmath112 with image orthogonal to only a few vectors of length @xmath113 in @xmath114 .",
    "this task is more strenuous than the analogous embedding problem in  @xcite , for several reasons .    1 .",
    "the lattice @xmath115 is indefinite , so there is no _ a priori _ bound , independent of @xmath41 , for the number of vectors of length @xmath113 in @xmath114 orthogonal to the image of @xmath109 ( signature considerations do imply that the number of such vectors is finite ) .",
    "the calculations in ",
    "[ s : latticeeng ] give rise to a class of embeddings for which we can certify an upper bound that is independent of @xmath41 , at least for sufficiently large @xmath41 .",
    "when @xmath2 , we reduce the embedding problem to the positivity of the coefficients of a difference of theta series , as in  @xcite .",
    "two difficulties arise in our case :    1 .",
    "we must consider some lattices of odd rank , making the problem of estimating the size of the coefficients of their theta functions a difficult one .",
    "fortunately , the odd - rank lattices we consider are unique in their genus , so later work of gritsenko , hulek and sankaran  @xcite , and yang  @xcite can be applied to control these coefficients .",
    "we lack explicit _ closed - form _",
    "bases for the spaces of modular forms containing the theta series we consider .",
    "this forces a delicate asymptotic analysis (   [ ss : m1bound][ss : proofthm1.1 ] ) to prove that @xmath0 is of general type for @xmath116 , leaving a tractable linear algebra problem that a computer can handle for the remaining smaller values of @xmath41 .",
    "a new feature in the case @xmath117 is the prominent use of dual @xmath55-lattices to home in on good embeddings @xmath106 .",
    "see , for example , the statement of problem  [ prob : lattices ] and the types of lattices involved in theorem  [ thm : reduction ] .",
    "dual @xmath55-lattices give us theoretical and computational leverage in proving theorem  [ thm : mainthm ] .",
    "theoretically , we use them to refine estimates for the size of coefficients of the theta functions that we need (   [ ss : m1bound][ss : proofthm1.1 ] ) .",
    "computationally , they allow us to efficiently search for embeddings when @xmath118 ; the required calculations are feasible on a single desktop machine over the course of a few days .",
    "+ the case @xmath119 has a purely lattice - theoretic proof , i.e. , no theta functions are involved , but it presents a different set of challenges , the most important of which is akin to that in  @xcite : the modular group @xmath77 in this case contains @xmath101 as a _ subgroup of index @xmath52 _ , so the cusp form @xmath103 is not _ a priori _ modular with respect to the correct group .",
    "our solution to this problem for large @xmath8 requires exhibiting a vector @xmath120 with certain properties ( see lemmas  [ lem : modularforbiggergroup ] and  [ lem : pexists ] ) , whose length can be expressed as the sum of three _ nonzero _ squares . to this end",
    ", we use a strengthening of legendre s three - squares theorem .",
    "this strengthening , however , requires the generalized riemann hypothesis ( grh ) .",
    "we circumvent grh by keeping small the number of @xmath0 whose kodaira dimension we must calculate using a computer ; see the proof of theorem  [ thm : dis0mod6 ] .",
    "besides results of hassett , lai , and nuer already mentioned , and results implied by work of gritsenko , hulek , and sankaran , it is worth mentioning a recent remarkable result of ma  @xcite .",
    "using gritsenko s method of jacobi lifting  @xcite , ma shows that all but finitely many stable orthogonal modular varieties are of general type .",
    "in particular , his result implies that @xmath0 is of general type for @xmath121 when @xmath33 .",
    "ma asserts that `` with a huge amount of computation '' his result could be made effective .",
    "we have not attempted to do this because the case @xmath119 is not covered by his proof .",
    "one might have hoped that theorem  [ thm : mainthm ] could shed light on the kodaira dimension of the moduli of polarized k3 surfaces @xmath38 for some values of @xmath8 not covered by  @xcite , because our proof does not rely on the specific embeddings used in  @xcite .",
    "alas , our results are compatible on the nose with those of  @xcite .",
    "in  [ s : preliminaries ] , we set up notation and review tools necessary for the proof of theorem  [ thm : mainthm ] .",
    "after fixing some terminology in  [ ss : lattices ] , we use  [ ss : reps ] to review some results in  @xcite and  @xcite on the representation of integers by quadratic forms needed for the case @xmath33 . in   [ ss : perioddomains][ss : modulispecialfourfolds ] we discuss moduli of cubic fourfolds and the birational map @xmath122 mentioned in   [ ss : modvars ] . in   [ ss : lowweightcusp ] we explain the low - weight cusp form trick that reduces theorem  [ thm : mainthm ] to problem  [ prod : embedding ] .    in  [ s : thelattice ] we show that @xmath99 is isomorphic to the lattice @xmath123 , and in  [ s : latticeeng ] we explain some natural constraints on the embedding @xmath124 that allow us to control the type and total number of @xmath125-vectors orthogonal to the image of @xmath109 .",
    "we treat the case @xmath2 in   [ s:2mod6 ] . after introducing certain dual @xmath55-lattices that make tractable the problem of embedding @xmath126 into @xmath89 , we prove theorem  [ thm : reduction ] , a result in the spirit of  ( * ? ? ? * theorem  7.1 ) , which reduces the problem for large @xmath8 to an inequality of coefficients of certain theta functions . the asymptotic analysis in   [ ss : m1bound][ss : proofthm1.1 ] is then used to show this inequality is satisfied for @xmath116 in theorem  [ thm : dis2mod6 ] . in the proof of theorem  [ thm : dis2mod6 ] we also outline the computation that exhibits the necessary embedding for the values @xmath118 appearing in theorem  [ thm : mainthm ] .",
    "finally , we treat the case @xmath42 in  [ s:0mod6 ] . in   [ ss : embeddinglwithprops ] we give a criterion ensuring the modular form @xmath103 is modular with respect the correct monodromy group ( lemma  [ lem : modularforbiggergroup ] ) .",
    "we also give a flexible criterion meant to ensure that the embedding @xmath127 is primitive when @xmath42 ( lemma  [ lem : primitivity ] ) ; this criterion is essential to handle small values of @xmath41 in theorem  [ thm : mainthm ] , particularly @xmath128 .",
    "lemma  [ lemma : lessthan14 ] shows that the criterion ensuring @xmath103 is modular with respect",
    "the correct group also ensures that the image of @xmath99 in @xmath89 is orthogonal to only a few @xmath125-vectors .",
    "this allows us to complete the embedding analysis in theorem  [ thm : dis0mod6 ] . in  [ ss : ramification ]",

    "next , if @xmath878 , then by lemma  [ lem : dets ] the determinant of @xmath925 is @xmath53 , @xmath52 , or @xmath453 .",
    "lattices of rank @xmath926 with these possible determinants contain one of the following root systems @xmath927 see  @xcite .",
    "it follows that @xmath928 contains at least 112 roots , and since @xmath929 , we conclude that @xmath282 vanishes along @xmath922 with order at least 50 .",
    "suppose now that @xmath930",
    ". then @xmath931 and @xmath932 or @xmath778 , by lemma  [ lemma : caseofinvolution ] .",
    "the lattice @xmath64 contains two orthogonal hyperbolic planes ( see  ( * ? ? ? * corollary a.5 ) ) , so that by the eichler criterion  ( * ? ? ? * lemma  3.5 ) , the @xmath73-orbit of a primitive vector @xmath933 is determined by two invariants : its length @xmath934 and the image of @xmath935 in the discriminant group @xmath876 .",
    "suppose that @xmath936 . then , as in the proof of lemma  [ lemma : caseofinvolution ] , we have @xmath937 , and hence @xmath938 . viewing @xmath939 as an element of @xmath940 , we have @xmath941 for some integer @xmath527 and some @xmath942 .",
    "the containment @xmath938 shows that @xmath527 must be divisible by @xmath616 , and hence @xmath943 .",
    "thus a representative of the @xmath73-orbit of @xmath155 is @xmath944 where @xmath945 is the standard basis for @xmath313 .",
    "the generator @xmath377 for @xmath678 is mapped into a direct sum of @xmath83 and @xmath84 in @xmath89 , and the direct summand of @xmath377 in @xmath84 is a linear combination of three mutually orthogonal roots @xmath946 which are orthogonal to @xmath947 . using magma  @xcite , it is easy to verify that @xmath948 contains only two roots , but on the other hand , @xmath949 contains more than two roots .",
    "this implies that there is a root in @xmath89 which is orthogonal to @xmath864 but not @xmath64 .",
    "this implies that our quasi - pullback of the borcherds form vanishes along @xmath922 .",
    "assume that @xmath950 .",
    "in this case , we have @xmath931 , and @xmath951 first let us assume that @xmath952 .",
