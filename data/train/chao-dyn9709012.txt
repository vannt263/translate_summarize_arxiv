    "semiconductor lasers have a wide range of applications because they are of relatively small size , they can be massively produced at low cost , and they are easy to operate .",
    "applications of semiconductor lasers appear in many areas such as optical communication and high speed modulation and detection . despite their successful technology ,",
    "semiconductor lasers are quite sensitive to any external perturbation which may destabilize their normal output .",
    "a small amount of optical feedback resulting from the reflection from an optical disk or from the end of an optical fiber is sufficient to generate pulsating instabilities .",
    "these oscillations are typically accompanied by higher intensity of frequency noise and affect the normal efficiency of the laser .",
    "systematic experimental studies of semiconductor lasers , in particular long time series analysis of the intensity are not available because the time scale of the intensity pulsations is typically in the picosecond regime .",
    "fourier spectra measurements show a gradual increase of oscillatory instabilities as parameters are changed but do not reveal what are the bifurcation mechanisms .",
    "most of the progress on our understanding of these bifurcations comes from extensive numerical studies of simple models and their comparison to the experimentally obtained fourier spectra . specifically , these are the lang and kobayashi equations @xcite for a single mode laser subject to optical feedback @xcite , the equations for two coupled lasers @xcite , and the equations for a laser subject to external optical injection @xcite .",
    "the latter is presumably the simplest system which allows a study of instabilities induced by an external perturbation .    the rate equations in normalized form for this system consist of two equations for the complex electrical field @xmath0 and the excess carrier number @xmath1 given by : @xmath2 @xmath3 where prime means differentiation with respect to time @xmath4 measured in units of the photon lifetime @xmath5 . the term @xmath6@xmath7 models the electrical field of the injected signal which is controlled by changing either its amplitude @xmath6 or its detuning @xmath8@xmath9 the equations are the same for a laser subject to optical feedback or for each laser in arrays of coupled lasers .",
    "they differ only by the last term in eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "the fixed parameters @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are defined as follows : @xmath10 is the linewidth enhancement factor ( @xmath13 ) which measures the amount of amplitude - phase coupling ; @xmath14 is the ratio of the carrier and photon lifetimes ( @xmath15 and @xmath12 is the dimensionless pumping current above threshold ( @xmath16 @xmath17 a series of recent experiments have explored a large variety of dynamical instabilities at high injection levels and have been simulated successfully by using eqs .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "the comparison is particularly remarkable knowing the high simplicity of these equations .",
    "they correctly describe the observed period doubling cascade to chaos @xcite , the period 2 bubbles @xcite , as well as the details of the experimental map of all the instability regions in the detuning versus injection amplitude parameter space @xcite .    of particular interest are the conditions for locking which corresponds to a steady phase of the laser field and occurs if the detuning is sufficiently low .",

    "( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) and by studying the conditions for a steady phase @xmath19 if the injection level is very weak , it is reasonable to assume that the laser amplitude and the carrier number will approach their steady state values in the absence of injection ( i.e. , @xmath20 and @xmath21 and that the long time behavior of the laser is first described by the phase @xmath19 from the equations for @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath1 , it is then straightforward to find that @xmath23 satisfies adler equation @xmath24 locking now implies the condition @xmath25@xmath26 in addition to locking , eq .",

    "the effect of @xmath11 large can be first analyzed from eqs .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) with @xmath32 we find that small perturbations from the steady state @xmath33 slowly decays on an @xmath34 time interval with rapid oscillations characterized by period @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the laser relaxation oscillations frequency .",

    "it explains the locking phenomenon and the entrainement of the laser in the four wave mixing regime but can not lead to the multiple instabilities observed experimentally and numerically .",
    "in particular , we show in figures 1a and 1b experimentally obtained spectra of a semiconductor laser subject to injection operating at very low detunings between the frequencies of the slave and master laser .",
    "the spectra were taken at constant injection and detuning .",
    "they show the characteristic sidebands at the relaxation oscillations frequency indicating that a hopf bifurcation has taken place from the locked steady state .",
    "the laser exhibited the two spectra at various times .",
    "the transition from one spectrum to another was abrupt strongly suggesting that the laser was visiting two different periodic states assisted by the intrinsic noise in the system .",
    "this implies that another stable periodic state may coexist with the hopf bifurcation periodic state for the same values of the parameters .",
    "figures 2a and 2b show spectra obtained from solving numerically the single mode rate equations ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "the parameters used for these simulations were @xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",

    "these lasers were also used in this set of experiments @xcite .",
    "gain saturation , known to shift bifurcation points , did not alter our conclusions , producing only minor modifications of the spectra .",
    "_  _ figure 3 shows the bifurcation diagram of the periodic states .",
    "in addition to the periodic states emerging from the hopf bifurcation , there is an isolated branch of periodic states emerging from a limit point .",
    "the spectra shown in figures 2a and 2b were computed at the points denoted by a and b in figure 3 , respectively .",
    "they compare well with the experimental spectra shown in figures 1a and 1b .",
    "bifurcation diagrams exhibiting coexisting bifurcation and isolated branches of periodic attractors are not common for nonlinear bifurcation problems .",
    "similar diagrams have been found numerically for the laser subject to optical feedback @xcite suggesting that the emergence of coexisting branches of periodic attractors is a general feature of semiconductor laser instabilities .",

    "we analyze this equation and determine approximations for the steady and time - periodic solutions .",
    "intensive numerical studies of the first period doubling bifurcation in the simplest case of zero detuning @xcite showed that the linewidth enhancement factor plays a key role in the problem .",

    "we have shown analytically that the single mode equations admit multiple periodic states emerging from limit points in addition to periodic solutions that appear as the result of a hopf bifurcation from the steady state .",
    "in general , the spectra of two of the limit cycles might appear very similar if they are taken at an injection level at which the amplitude saturates and approaches constant values .",
    "however for low injection levels and away from saturation the spectra can exhibit dramatic differences .",
    "this is clearly demonstrated by the computed spectra shown in figure 2 . in particular small perturbations in the phase of the field can induce dramatic changes in the optical spectra .",
    "this is precisely the reason that the multiple instabilities exhibited by the phase of the field can be clearly observed in the spectra .",
    "such effects include center line suppression , in which the center line of the laser is almost devoid of energy most of which is carried by the sidebands at the relaxation frequency .",
    "this is a typical feature of a laser with a large value of the linewidth enhancement factor .",
    "the effect of gain saturation can also be incorporated in the context of the phase equation formalism .",
    "its main contribution is to shift hopf bifurcation and limit points but it would not modify the qualitative properties of the bifurcation diagram .",
    "we note that the period doubling bifurcation point can also be captured analytically from eq .",

    "furthermore , experimental evidence of quasiperiodic oscillations is still lacking .",
    "this is partly because the laser is not stable at this injection region and frequently mode hops to a different cavity line . in addition",
