    "if dark matter annihilates , the byproducts of the annihilation ( positrons , neutrinos , gamma - rays , etc . ) can leave non - gravitational signatures that , if observed , would be crucial for clarifying the nature of dark matter .    in recent years",
    ", a number of observations have highlighted anomalies that might be explained by invoking dark matter annihilation in our galactic halo . among them",
    "are : ( i ) an anomalous abundance of positrons in cosmic rays above @xmath2  gev according to the pamela experiment @xcite confirming and extending previous measurements by experiments such as ams-01 @xcite ; ( ii ) an excess of microwave emission from the galactic center as measured by the wmap experiment , known as the `` wmap haze '' @xcite ( iii ) the apparent excess of diffuse galactic gamma - rays with energies above 1gev inferred from observations by the egret satellite @xcite ; ( iv ) analyses on the balloon experiments atic and ppb - bets @xcite have reported an excess in the total flux of electrons and positrons in cosmic rays . for the last two anomalies , we note that recent observations by fermi seem inconsistent with the claimed gamma - ray excess in the egret data @xcite , and that the excess in the electron and positron flux is smaller than previously thought @xcite .",
    "the latter is actually consistent with a modified cosmic ray propagation model that does not require additional primary sources of electrons and positrons @xcite .",
    "although other astrophysical sources could explain these anomalies ( see for example @xcite for an explanation for the pamela excess based on particle acceleration by pulsars , and @xcite for one based on supernova remnants ) , dark matter annihilation offers an attractive solution .",
    "large annihilation rates are needed , however , to explain the observations .",
    "in particular for the pamela data , the required annihilation rate is typically a few orders of magnitude larger than the value obtained by assuming the standard cross section inferred from the observed abundance of dark matter together with a smooth local distribution of dark matter @xcite .",
    "thus , an additional hypothesis is needed to boost the annihilation rate to the required levels and this must not change the present - day abundance of dark matter .",
    "such a boost is difficult to obtain from the effects of substructures in the local dark matter distribution .",
    "recent numerical simulations predict this to be remarkably smooth @xcite .",
    "a detailed analysis of the impact of substructure on the production of positrons by @xcite came to a similar conclusion .",
    "the possibility of a nearby `` spike '' of dark matter produced by an intermediate mass black hole seems also a priori implausible @xcite .",
    "an alternative that has produced a plethora of papers in recent years is that of a sommerfeld enhancement to the cross section produced by the mutual interaction of the annihilating dark matter particles .",
    "such an interaction could be produced by a force carrier which might be any of the standard model weak force gauge bosons @xcite or a new force carrier @xcite . for certain values of the parameters of these models ,",
    "the enhancement is easily large enough to boost the cross section to the required values .",
    "however , a large cross section has a significant impact on other observables and may violate other constraints .",
    "for instance , @xcite showed that for the case where the cross section increases as @xmath3 ( a particular case of sommerfeld - enhancement models ) , where @xmath4 is the relative velocity of the annihilating particles , there are severe constraints from measurements of the diffuse extragalactic gamma - ray background radiation and from cmb constraints on ionization and heating of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) by annihilation in the first generation of halos . in this scenario ,",
    "the boost factors required to fit the above anomalies would be inconsistent with current constraints .",
    "this problem is avoided , however , by more general cases of the sommerfeld enhancement where the effect saturates at low velocities @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite analyzed constraints on the annihilation cross section from perturbations to the cmb angular power spectra resulting from heating and ionization of the photon - baryon plasma at recombination .",
    "they found interesting upper limits to models with sommerfeld enhancement ( see fig .",
    "5 of @xcite ) that already rule out some extreme cases .    at higher redshifts ,",
    "the effects of the sommerfeld enhancement have scarcely been treated .",
    "for example , the annihilation of dark matter impacts the predictions from big - bang nucleosynthesis on the abundance of light elements ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this could put constraints on certain models with sommerfeld enhancement .",
    "however , this has only been studied in passing @xcite .",
    "also , the abundance of dark matter today is commonly assumed to be unaltered by this effect , apparently because the typical dark matter particle velocities at freeze - out are very large making the enhancement very close to one at that epoch @xcite .",
    "as we will show , this reasoning is flawed .",
    "the thermodynamic equilibrium between matter and radiation in the early universe would be perturbed by energy released during a certain process , dark matter annihilation for example .",
    "this equilibrium tends to be restored by different interaction mechanisms : compton scattering , double compton emission and bremsstrahlung radiation .",
    "the efficiency of these to fully restore equilibrium varies with redshift .",
    "for @xmath5 they are efficient enough to restore distortions in the energy spectrum and thus , the photon distribution is that of a black body with a slightly higher temperature than the one in the case of no energy injection . for lower redshifts these mechanisms can not restore the black body spectrum . in particular , for @xmath6 , the spectrum is perturbed into a bose - einstein distribution with a chemical potential @xmath7 @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we revisit the impact of the sommerfeld enhancement on the relic particle abundance and we show that its effect is not negligible .",
    "we also study , for the first time , @xmath0type distortions of the cmb spectrum due to energy deposition by dark matter annihilation in models with sommerfeld enhancement .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we summarize the sommerfeld enhancement and describe how we include it in our calculations .",
    "the relic density calculation is set out in detail in section 3 . in section 4 , the @xmath0type distortion to the cmb from annihilation with sommerfeld enhancement",
    "is calculated .",
    "finally we present a summary and our conclusions in section 5 .",
    "the sommerfeld enhancement of dark matter annihilation is a nonrelativistic quantum effect occurring when annihilating particles interact through a potential of some sort .",
    "if their kinetic energy is low enough , their wave function is distorted , and a significant enhancement ( or suppression if the force is repulsive ) to the annihilation cross section occurs @xcite .",
    "the product of the relative velocity times the annihilation cross section will therefore be boosted : @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the standard product of the tree level cross section times the relative velocity and @xmath10 is the so called sommerfeld boost .",
    "the simplest interaction is that for an attractive yukawa potential with coupling strength @xmath11 mediated by a scalar boson of mass @xmath12 ( more complicated models exist where there are multiple force carriers @xcite ) . in this case , the sommerfeld enhancement can be computed by solving the radial schrdinger equation for s - wave annihilation in the non - relativistic limit ( we use natural units @xmath13 ) : @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the mass and velocity of the dark matter particle , respectively , and @xmath17 is the reduced two - body wave function .",
    "( [ sch ] ) should be solved with the boundary condition : @xmath18 as @xmath19 .",
    "the sommerfeld boost @xmath10 is simply given by : @xmath20 in the limit of a massless force carrier ( @xmath21 ) , the potential reduces to a coulomb interaction and eq .",
    "( [ sch ] ) can be solved analytically yielding a value of @xmath10 that is independent of the dark matter particle mass : @xmath22 in this limit , and for small velocities ( @xmath23 ) : @xmath24 .",
    "this is the reason why the sommerfeld enhancement is usually associated with a `` @xmath3 '' enhancement .    in the more general case , where @xmath25 , the `` @xmath3 '' behavior is no longer valid for very small velocities because the yukawa interaction has a finite range",
    "this can also be shown by expanding the exponential term in eq .",
    "( [ sch ] ) in powers of @xmath26 , then the necessary condition to recover the coulomb - like interaction solution ( eq .  [ s_1 ] ) is @xmath27 @xcite , which , for fixed values of @xmath11 and @xmath28 , will not be fulfilled for arbitrarily low velocities . in the opposite regime , for @xmath29 , a series of resonances appear for specific values of @xmath30 . these resonances are associated with bound states , the so - called wimponium @xcite . in them ,",
    "the enhancement greatly increases with smaller relative velocity , as @xmath31 . for even lower velocities and for fixed values of @xmath11 and @xmath28",
    ", the enhancement saturates reaching a value that can be estimated by solving eq .",
    "( [ sch ] ) with @xmath32 .",
    "away from the resonances , an order of magnitude estimate of this value is @xmath33 , reached for a threshold velocity of @xmath34 @xcite .    on the other hand , for large velocities ( @xmath35 ) ,",
    "the coulomb approximation is valid and the enhancement is effectively reduced to values very close to 1 .",
    "to include in detail the influence of the sommerfeld enhancement in our study we need to to solve numerically the schrdinger equation .",
    "the evolution of the phase space distribution per particle of a given species is given by the boltzmann equation .",
    "for majorana fermions that are stable , for example , neutralinos if they are the lightest supersymmetric particle , the boltzmann equation is ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the hubble parameter , @xmath38 is the thermally averaged product of the total pair annihilation cross section times the mller velocity and @xmath39 is the equilibrium dark matter number density . in the remainder of the paper",
    "we assume that dark matter is made of neutralinos .",
    "we solve eq .",
    "( [ boltzmann ] ) by using the standard freeze - out approximation ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the freeze - out epoch is defined as the time where the annihilation rate is equal to the expansion rate of the universe ( @xmath40 ) . in the standard case where @xmath38 is velocity",
    "independent , the annihilation process becomes subdominant after freeze - out(chemical decoupling ) and the `` relic '' abundance of particles is roughly fixed .",
    "we define @xmath41 , where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the comoving number density out of and at equilibrium , then we can write eq .",
    "( [ boltzmann ] ) as : @xmath44 since before freeze - out the number density follows closely the equilibrium solution then : @xmath45 , and at freeze - out : @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is a constant of order unity influences the results found on this paper .",
    "however , for a reasonable range of values : @xmath48 , the changes are in the percent level .",
    "we have adopted @xmath49 in the results reported here . ] . under these approximations ,",
    "the value of the freeze - out time can be found by solving the following equation : @xmath50    it is convenient to change the variable @xmath42 to the ratio @xmath51 of the number density to the total entropy density of the universe .",
    "the entropy is dominated by the contribution of relativistic particles @xmath52 , where @xmath53 are the effective degrees of freedom for the entropy density , and @xmath54 is the radiation temperature . in thermal equilibrium",
    ", the entropy per comoving volume is conserved @xmath55 ( taking @xmath56k and @xmath57 ) .",
    "it is also useful to change the time variable to @xmath58 using the equation : @xmath59 , where @xmath60gev is the planck mass and @xmath61 are the effective degrees of freedom for the total energy density of the universe , which are generally a function of temperature .",
    "we have taken into account the temperature dependence of @xmath61 in our calculations , whose values vary from @xmath62 at @xmath63  gev to @xmath64 at @xmath65  kev .",
    "this equation is valid during the radiation - dominated era .",
    "if we neglect the variations in @xmath66 around the freeze - out temperature , the function @xmath61 is roughly in a constant plateau , see for example fig . 1 of @xcite .",
    "this expected range is motivated by the values obtained in the standard calculations where @xmath67cte . ] , we can finally write eq .",
    "( [ freeze_out ] ) as : @xmath68 in the non - relativistic limit , the equilibrium solution takes a simple form : @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the degeneracy factor for the particle species ( @xmath71 for neutralinos ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath72 is simply given by the solution to the implicit equation : @xmath73 where we have used the approximation @xmath74 , since we expect @xmath75 .",
    "in the non - relativistic limit , the thermal average @xmath38 reduces to an average over a maxwell - boltzmann distribution function @xcite : @xmath76 where @xmath4 is the relative velocity of the annihilating particles .",
    "the expansion of @xmath77 in powers of @xmath78 leads to the usual expansion of the non - relativistic thermal average in powers of @xmath79 , where the first term of the expansion corresponds to the constant s - wave annihilation term @xmath80 . for the case when the cross section is enhanced by the sommerfeld mechanism",
    "the s - wave annihilation thermal average is given by : @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the thermally averaged sommerfeld enhancement .",
    "the thermal average maintains the qualitative behavior of @xmath10 with velocity .",
    "for example , when @xmath83 , @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the velocity dispersion of the dark matter particles @xcite .",
    "we have omitted in the notation of @xmath82 the dependence on the parameters of the yukawa interaction ; in general @xmath86 .    at freeze - out , although the dark matter particles are already non - relativistic , the typical velocities are still very large , and we can safely assume @xmath87 , i.e. , @xmath88 .",
    "we have checked that this is indeed a good approximation by solving fully the schrdinger equation , there is no significant change in the results that follow .",
    "the dark matter relic density can be calculated by solving the boltzmann equation in the late times regime ( @xmath89 ) where the number density at equilibrium @xmath39 is considerably lower than the out - of equilibrium solution and can therefore be dropped from the boltzmann equation .",
    "eq .  ( [ boltzmann ] ) can be written in terms of the ratio @xmath90 and the variable @xmath91 as ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath92 where we have used eq .",
    "( [ cross_nr_2 ] ) , and the limits of integration corresponding to freeze - out @xmath93 and present - day values @xmath94 .",
    "the value of @xmath95 is connected to the value of the ratio of the dark matter density to the critical density today ( @xmath96 ) : @xmath97    the integral in the r.h.s of eq .",
    "( [ boltzmann_late ] ) can be divided in two . before kinetic decoupling , the dark matter particles are still coupled to the photon - baryon plasma through scattering with standard model particles and therefore we can treat the temperatures of the radiation and of the neutralinos interchangeably ( @xmath98 ) for @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the temperature at kinetic decoupling .",
    "after kinetic decoupling , the temperature of the dark matter particles drops as @xmath101 instead of @xmath102 , as the temperature of radiation does .",
    "thus , for this second part of the integral in eq .",
    "( [ boltzmann_late ] ) , one must be careful in the definition of the variable @xmath79 in the thermal average ( eq .  [ cross_nr_2 ] ) and in the boltzmann equation ( eq .  [ boltzmann_late ] ) .",
    "the thermal average uses a maxwell - boltzmann distribution function with the temperature of the dark matter `` gas '' , whereas eq .",
    "( [ boltzmann_late ] ) was written as a function of @xmath91 , where @xmath54 is the radiation temperature .",
    "we can easily account for this by evaluating @xmath103 in eq .",
    "( [ cross_nr_2 ] ) as a function of the radiation temperature by using the relation : @xmath104 .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite , in this regime ( @xmath105 ) , for the case where @xmath106 , the relic density decays logarithmically : @xmath107 . in section 2",
    "we mentioned that for particular values of @xmath11 and @xmath28 , the sommerfeld enhancement has resonances that for very low velocities produce very large values of @xmath10 , in these cases , @xmath108 , thus , the relic density decreases as @xmath109 .",
    "however , these large suppressions of the relic density are eventually cut - off by the saturation of @xmath10 , which occurs before matter - radiation equality .",
    "consider , for example , a @xmath110 gev neutralino .",
    "since @xmath111 , and because @xmath112 with @xmath113 ( the exact value of @xmath114 depends on the specific supersymmetric model , this is a typical value for a neutralino of this mass ) , we have a dark matter velocity dispersion of the order of @xmath115 by @xmath116 , which is sufficiently low to reach saturation , unless the combination of @xmath11 and @xmath28 is fine - tuned to be close to a resonance .    in summary ,",
    "a proper calculation of the relic density needs to include the effects of kinetic decoupling .",
    "we do so by choosing a model with neutralino dark matter , and by using the results of @xcite , who made a scan of the parameter space in msugra ( minimal supergravity ) and more general mssm models , and give a range for the values of the kinetic decoupling temperature as a function of neutralino mass ( see fig . 2 of their paper ) .",

    "( [ boltzmann_late ] ) at @xmath130 , the relic density calculation would depend only in the strength of the coupling @xmath11 .",
    "this dependence can be seen in the overall trend from left to right in fig .",
    "[ cross_section ] .",

    "particularly near resonances , the cross section at freeze - out needs to be lower for a higher kinetic decoupling temperature to produce the correct relic density . from the figure",
    "we see that uncertainties in the kinetic decoupling temperature introduce changes to @xmath134 at the most of order @xmath135 for a @xmath110 gev neutralino .    since current uncertainties on the abundance of dark matter are in the percent level , the impact of the particular value of @xmath123 on fig .  [ cross_section ] is not so large . by exploring changes in @xmath123 within the @xmath125 bounds we found changes in the values of @xmath134 of @xmath136 at the most .",
    "these results are also not very sensitive to changes in the neutralino mass , because the relic density is nearly independent of it .",
    "this can be seen by looking at eqs.([boltzmann_late]-[omega_y0 ] ) .",
    "if we neglect the term @xmath137 , then , for a fixed value of @xmath134 , @xmath123 depends on the neutralino mass just through the integral in the r.h.s of eq .",
    "( [ boltzmann_late ] ) .",
    "moreover , since the sommerfeld enhancement only depends on the neutralino mass through the ratio @xmath28 , a change on @xmath15 can always be compensated by choosing a different mass for the force carrier .",
    "the remaining dependence is through the values of @xmath72 and @xmath129 .",
    "of course , to get the precise impact on the value of the cross section required for a particular particle model , it is necessary to do the calculation for that model .",
    "uncertainties on the kinetic decoupling temperature and on the abundance of dark matter will have a minor - to - mild impact on the quantitative results . however , the general behavior and order of magnitude of the expected values of @xmath134 can be directly read off from fig .",
    "[ cross_section ] .    in summary",
    ", the relevant difference between the relic density calculation for the standard case where @xmath138 is constant and the case we study here is given by the onset of the sommerfeld enhancement after kinetic decoupling . before this phase , the velocities of dark matter particles are too large for the enhancement to be relevant , but once the decoupling happens the typical velocities decrease quickly since the temperature of the dark matter fluid drops as @xmath101 .",
    "this causes a rapid increase on the enhancement values and the annihilation process takes a relevant role once more decreasing the dark matter density . on the contrary ,",
    "the comoving density remains constant after freeze - out for the standard case .",
    "the aforementioned effect continues to be important until the enhancement saturates fixing the value of @xmath138 to a maximum .",
    "afterwards , the annihilation rate becomes subdominant compared to the expansion rate of the universe and thus , the comoving dark matter density remains fixed .",
    "owing to this difference , the value of the annihilation cross section before the freeze - out epoch needs to be smaller for the case with sommerfeld enhancement than for the standard one in order to produce the observed dark matter density . with a lower annihilation rate ,",
    "the dark matter particles go through chemical decoupling at earlier times , and therefore the dark matter density is higher at these epoch than in the standard case .",

    "care is needed very close to the resonances since the simple scaling @xmath182 is no longer valid there .",
    "finally , we show in fig .",
    "[ mu_coulomb ] the analogous result for the values of @xmath7 in the case where the interaction responsible of the sommerfeld enhancement is coulomb - like ( @xmath21 ) . in this case",

    "values above the black solid horizontal line are excluded by the current limits of @xmath7 according to the cobe / firas experiment.,width=321,height=321 ]",
    "the prospects for dark matter detection have increased considerably in recent years .",
    "there is a continual advance in the sensitivity of detectors on earth that look for direct dark matter elastic scattering with nuclei , and in experiments that search indirectly for dark mater by looking for non - gravitational signatures of the byproducts of its hypothetical annihilation .",
    "such technological improvements may lead , in the near future , to a definite proof of the existence of dark matter .",
    "perhaps dark matter has produced non - gravitational signals that have already been detected .",
    "the recently reported excesses of positrons in cosmic rays by pamela and of electrons+positrons by fermi / atic / ppb - bets can be explained by dark matter annihilation .",
    "although other explanations with a different astrophysical origin are also possible , a solution based on dark matter is an attractive possibility .",
    "however , such solution seems to require an attractive force between the dark matter particles to enhance their annihilation through the sommerfeld mechanism . for a yukawa interaction via a single scalar , the magnitude of the enhancement depends on the coupling strength of the interaction @xmath11 , on the mass ratio of the force carrier to the dark matter particle @xmath28 and on the relative velocities of the annihilation particles @xmath16 .",
    "several recent papers have computed the boost to the annihilation due to a sommerfeld enhancement ( in the galactic halo and/or in its subhalos ) @xcite .",
    "one of the main aims of these works is to show that for certain values of @xmath11 and @xmath28 , this mechanism is able to produce large enough boosts to explain the cosmic ray anomalies .",
    "only a handful of studies have addressed in detail the impact that such an enhancement has in the early universe . in @xcite",
    ", the authors found that if the cross section increases with decreasing relative velocity as @xmath185 ( which is valid in a certain regime for general sommerfeld enhancement models ) , dark matter annihilation in the first halos would heat and ionize the igm , violating current constraints from the cmb .",
    "as was later pointed out by @xcite and @xcite , this problem is alleviated in more general models where the enhancement saturates at low velocities . in @xcite and @xcite , a constraint on the annihilation cross section",
    "was obtained by considering limits on the energy deposition by annihilation at recombination .",
    "the constraint reported by @xcite is @xmath186 , where @xmath187 is an average efficiency of energy injection into the igm by annihilation at recombination .    in the present paper , we have analyzed the impact of dark matter annihilation with sommerfeld enhancement at higher redshift .    in the first place ,",
    "we have revisited the calculation of the dark matter particle abundance by solving the boltzmann equation from freeze - out through the epoch of kinetic decoupling , including a full solution to the schrdinger equation .",
    "contrary to previous claims @xcite , we have found a significant suppression of the relic density , in agreement with a recent work by @xcite .",
    "this suppression is particularly important near resonances , which are typically invoked to explain the cosmic ray anomalies .",
    "we found that to fit the observed dark matter abundance , the normalization of the cross section needs to be lowered by up to a factor of 10 compared to the case without enhancement ( see fig .  [ cross_section ] ) .",
    "the result depends on the coupling strength and the proximity to a resonance . exploring a broad range of dark matter particle masses and kinetic decoupling temperatures",
    ", we found a minor - to - medium impact of these parameters on our results ; variations on @xmath100 have the strongest impact .",
    "secondly , we have calculated the amount of energy deposited by dark matter annihilation into the radiation plasma in the redshift range @xmath188 .",
    "energy injection at this epoch would create a distortion in the cmb energy spectrum first pointed out by @xcite .",
    "the cobe / firas experiment has put constraints on this bose - einstein @xmath0type distortion .",
    "the upper limit on the chemical potential associated to the distortion is @xmath1 at the @xmath125 level @xcite .",
    "we have found that very near resonances , annihilation with sommerfeld enhancement is already ruled out by this constraint on @xmath7 ( see fig  [ mu ] ) .",
    "quantitatively , the `` safe '' range of proximity to a resonance depends on the particular model , higher values of dark matter mass and kinetic decoupling temperature allow a closer proximity to the resonance ( see fig .",
    "[ mu_resonance ] ) . in the case where the force carrier is massless",
    ", the yukawa interaction reduces to a coulomb one .",
    "our findings are much more stringent in this case with values of @xmath189 already ruled out ( see fig .",
    "[ mu_coulomb ] ) .    improved upper limits on the @xmath7 parameter by a null distortion detection in the cmb spectrum would rule out a larger region of the parameter space for the yukawa interaction . in @xcite , it was pointed out that an improvement close to two orders of magnitude has already been possible for a number of years , and @xcite suggests that another order of magnitude is perhaps within reach .",
    "an upper limit on @xmath172 of the order of @xmath190 would certainly exclude large regions of the parameter space .",
    "it would exclude to a large extent near - resonance regions , which are the ones that produce the largest boosts to the annihilation .",
    "on the other hand , the detection of a distortion could possibly tell us something about the parameters of the yukawa interaction and the nature of the force carrier @xmath191 .    in summary , our results indicate that for a given set of parameters @xmath192 , it is necessary to compute in detail the relic density to obtain the range of values for the normalization to the cross section that are compatible with current estimates of the dark matter abundance .",
    "once this normalization is known , the energy input producing a @xmath0type distortion in the cmb spectrum can be computed to check whether the particular model violates current constraints . only for allowed models",
    "can a boost factor for local dark matter annihilation be computed and advocated .",
    "our findings show that the local boosts reported in the literature need to be renormalized to the proper value of @xmath134 implied by the observed relic density .",
    "this renormalization can exceed a factor of 10 in extreme cases .",
    "for the parameter scan of the yukawa interaction .",
    "these values are obtained according to the cross section values of fig .",
    "[ cross_section ] , which are consistent with @xmath119 .",
    "a maxwell - boltzmann velocity distribution with @xmath193 for a neutralino with @xmath133gev and @xmath194gev was used .",
    "the values are color - coded logarithmically according to the scale on the right.,width=377,height=321 ]    a recent analysis of the pamela and fermi data by @xcite suggests that boost factors , over a standard value of @xmath195 , of order 1000 or higher are required to explain both datasets simultaneously . we note that smaller boost factors ( @xmath196 ) can still fit the pamela data , but not the fermi one , for a 100  gev neutralino , which is the standard case we have considered here .",
    "these large boosts are also found in the analysis by @xcite .",
    "it has been argued in the past that these boosts can be achieved only by invoking sommerfeld - enhanced annihilation .",
    "for instance , @xcite and @xcite obtain maximum boost factors @xmath197 by assuming a local maxwell - boltzmann velocity distribution with a velocity dispersion of @xmath198 ( @xmath199 ) , which roughly corresponds to the estimated local dark matter velocity dispersion .",
    "we find that these boosts are modified once the proper cross section is used .    in fig .",
    "[ boost_factor ] we show the boost factors , i.e. , the multiplicative factor to @xmath200 , that we find for a maxwell - boltzmann velocity distribution with @xmath193 for the parameter space of the yukawa interaction .",
    "the figure is for @xmath133gev , @xmath194gev and is consistent with a relic abundance @xmath119 .",
    "keep in mind , however , that changes in the neutralino mass have almost no impact on the normalization of the cross section .",
    "different kinetic decoupling temperatures and variations on @xmath123 have also only a small effect ( @xmath201 in combination ) .",
    "thus , fig .",
    "[ boost_factor ] is approximately correct for all the cases considered in this paper .",
    "the figure shows that even in extreme cases , for resonances in the upper right of the figure , the boost factors are @xmath202 . in more favored regions of the parameter space @xmath203 , @xmath204 ( see for example @xcite ) , the boost factors are @xmath205 .",
    "this result suggests that additional assumptions are needed to account for the boost needed to explain the cosmic ray anomalies by dark matter annihilation alone .",
    "the inclusion of colder substructures to the overall smooth component with higher densities and lower velocity dispersions and thus , higher boost factors , could perhaps solve the issue .",
    "however , as found in recent high - resolution n - body simulations , the local dark matter distribution is rather smooth @xcite .",
    "typical estimates on such an additional boost factor due to substructure in the galactic halo ( albeit without sommerfeld enhancement ) are of the order of 1.4 , unless a subhalo happens to be very close to earth , in which case this boost could be larger than 10 @xcite .",
    "these estimates do not include a possible further amplification due to the scaling of the sommerfeld enhancement with velocity dispersion .",
    "however , the constraints found by @xcite based on energy deposition at recombination suggest that the enhancement must be already close to saturation for @xmath206 , thus such a further amplification seems implausible . therefore , is not clear that the inclusion of colder substructures can account for the additional boost .",
    "finally , we mention that we have created a web application that solves the relevant equations described in this paper .",
    "it allows the user to compute individual sommerfeld boosts , thermally averaged enhancements , cross section and @xmath7 values , among other quantities .",
