    "soon after fukushima daiichi reactor accident , one of the authors ( k.n . ) proposed that it would be possible to inspect damaged reactors using cosmic rays .",
    "some pioneering works@xcite have already used cosmic muons for the study of the inner structure of big objects such as volcanoes and hot melting furnaces : this method is often referred to as muon imaging or muon radiography . by accumulating millions of muon tracks traversing through such heavy and big objects , one can image their inner structure , much like medical x - ray imaging .",
    "a team was formed by the people of kek , the university of tsukuba , and the university of tokyo to consider the possible applications of muon imaging technology to troubled nuclear reactors .",
    "it became immediately clear that the situation surrounding the reactors , for example the radiation level , would not allow an individual to bring the detector system inside the reactor building .",
    "the radiation levels just outside of the fukushima daiichi building were so high that even some protection of the detector against radiation needed to be carefully considered .",
    "the accuracy of the track position measurement was re - evaluated so that the detector system could provide a clear image of the inner structure even if placed outside of the reactor building .",
    "an attempt to image the fuel in a reactor using emulsion plates located directly underneath the reactor has been reported @xcite .",
    "setting a detector at the same place would be difficult in view of accessibility required for data collection . in light of these conditions ,",
    "the kek - tsukuba team built a detector system using finely segmented hodoscopes consisting of 1 cm ( wide ) by 100 cm ( long ) scintillator bars .",
    "wavelength shifting fibers were embedded in the bars and coupled with mppcs ( multi - pixel photon counters or silicon pmts ) for readout .",
    "the signal readout and trigger processing was performed using an fpga ( field programmable gate array ) based system .",
    "these detector technologies , each of which had been developed originally for various individual physics experiment , were integrated into a muon radiography system that could be adoptable to evaluate , otherwise very difficult , the inner structure of the huge nuclear plant .    in order to evaluate the performance of the detector",
    ", we carried out a test measurement by imaging a gm mk - ii type nuclear reactor at the japan atomic power company ( the japc ) .",
    "the system was installed in march 2012 about 64 m away from the reactor center , and this report describes the design of the detector system , operational experience , and outcome of the test measurements carried out at the japc .",
    "the detector system illustrated in fig . [ fig : system ] consisted of four x - y units with a 61-cm long 1.4-t permanent magnet located between the second and third x - y units .",
    "each x - y plane was constructed from two detector planes arranged at 90@xmath0 , each plane consisted of 100 scintillating strips of width 1  cm .",
    "the distance between unit-1 and unit-2 ( composing the front tracker ) was 1.5 m , whilst the distance between unit-3 and unit-4 was 0.75 m ( compromising between the acceptance of cosmic muons and the momentum resolution ) .",
    "the elevations of the four x - y units were adjustable with respect to the toroidal magnet .    each x - y unit ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : xyunit ] ) was equipped with a data - acquisition ( daq ) box that collected 200 mppc signals ; 100 each of x and y. the x - y coincidences ( after applying thresholds to the signals in a given time window ) were transferred via a lan to a pc where the trigger decision was made .",
    "the timing of the four daq boxes was reset every 1  @xmath1s using a common clock generator that provided nim - logic signals to all four of the daq boxes .",
    "the whole system was housed in a 20-ft shipping container , reinforced with steel bars , equipped with air conditioning , and which weighed 3.5 t. the total weight of the system amounted to 10  t including the toroidal magnet ( 5.3 t ) and four x - y units ( each 50 kg ) .     1 m x - y ( scintillator bar ) units and a toroidal magnet .",
    "the daq box looks for a coincidence in the x - y unit and sends the data to the pc .",
    "the clocks of the four daq boxes were synchronized by a clock generator module .",
    ", width=566 ]          the eight detector planes , each consisting of 100 scintillating bars , were identical in design .",
    "the base element consisted of scintillator@xcite bars of width 9.7 mm , height 6 mm ( nominal ) , and length 1000 mm .",
    "we machined a 2 mm deep straight groove where a 1 mm @xmath2 wavelength shifting fiber ( kuraray y11 200 ppm doped double clad plastic fiber@xcite ) was embedded .",
    "after cutting to a length of 1010 mm , both ends of the fiber were polished and one end was aluminized .",
    "the aluminum mirror was reinforced with white paint@xcite , and the three sides of the bar were also painted white .",
    "twenty such bars were placed with the grooved faces set against a jig plate ( where 20 ridges were machined at a spacing of 10 mm ) , such that the bars were arranged at a spacing of precisely 10 mm .",
    "five sets of such 20-bar arrangements were put in a light - tight tray , made of 8 mm thick , black pmma bars at three sides , with a 0.5 mm thick aluminum sheet screwed to the pmma bars .",
    "a 0.02 mm thick white pet sheet and a 0.1 mm thick black vinyl sheet were used for light reflection and light shielding , respectively . in order to keep the shape and flatness of the tray , four 20 @xmath3 30 mm rectangular aluminum tubes",
    "were screwed in a direction perpendicular to the scintillator bars ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : xyunit ] ) .",
    "for the fiber end - plate , one hundred holes were machined at a spacing of 10  mm to a 10 mm thick black pmma end - plate , where wave - shifting fibers were inserted and glued . after placing the fibers into the scintillator grooves and setting the white pet and vinyl sheets ,",
    "a 2 mm thick foam sheet was inserted , after which the tray was covered with another 0.5 mm thick aluminum sheet .",
    "the foam was inserted for the purpose of absorbing any thickness variation of the scintillator bars .",
    "the open side of the tray box was enclosed by screwing the fiber end - plate against a pair of enforcement bars .",
    "the end - plates were machined with screw holes and five dowel pins , to which an mppc array plate was then positioned and screwed .",
    "the multi - pixel photon counter ( mppc ) is a product of hamamatsu photonics@xcite that has 667 pixels covering a 1.3 mm square area and a typical gain of 7.5 @xmath310@xmath4 at 71 v bias .",

    "[ fig : mppc ] shows the bias voltage distribution at a gain of 7.5 @xmath310@xmath4 , and the dark count rates for a 0.5 photoelectron ( pe ) threshold for all of the 840 mppcs used here .",
    "the devices showed quite uniform characteristics .",
    "the dark count rates decreased to 38 - 86 khz at a threshold of 1.2  pes .",
    "the mppcs were packaged in 6 mm @xmath2 ceramics with the photo - coupling face covered by a 0.3 mm thick silicon resin .",
    "each of the wave - shifting fibers was coupled to one mppc so that 100 mppcs were aligned at spacing of 10 mm along the 5 mm thick black pmma plate .",
    "the mppc array plate was assembled by first placing each mppc in drilled holes ( see fig  [ fig : mppcpl ] ) .",
    "the mppc anode and cathode leads were then soldered onto a printed circuit board .",
    "one circuit board , serving for 10 mppcs , was mounted with 10 2-pin headers ( hirose electric co. , ltd . , hnc series ) , see the inset of fig  [ fig : xyunit ] .",
    "the signal was transferred via coaxial cables coupled individually to the two leads of the mppc , hence the signal pulse was overlaid on a typical bias voltage of 71  v.     at a gain of 7.5 @xmath3 10@xmath4 , and ( right ) dark count rates above a threshold of 0.5 pes .",
    "data were taken at 25@xmath0c for all 840 delivered pieces.,width=566 ]          the mppcs data acquisition ( daq ) system was fabricated by bee - beans technology@xcite .",
    "each system dealt with 200 analog signals for the two planes of one x - y unit , and also provided bias voltages to the mppcs themselves .",
    "a block diagram of this system is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : daq ] . after decoupling the dc bias voltage ,",
    "the pulse signal was transferred to an ltc6409 fast differential amplifier with its gain set to 100 .",
    "the amplified signal was then discriminated using an lt1720 functioning in zero - crossing mode , where the baseline ( i.e. , threshold adjustment ) is provided by an individual digital - to - analog converter ( dac ) .",
    "twenty amplifier and discriminator stages were grouped , and assembled on a sub - board .",
    "ten such sub - boards were plugged into a motherboard furnished with fpgas ( for coincidence logic generation and sitcp communication ) .",
    "the motherboard also controls udp commands to the dacs via the lan port .",
    "the system ran on a 125  mhz clock cycle , providing a shortest coincidence window of 8  ns .",
    "the fpga looks for a single cluster in both the x and y planes in a given time window ( adjustable in units of 8 ns up to 1  @xmath1s ) .",
    "this cluster is defined as hits in consecutive channels from ` one ' up to ` one to four ' ( selectable ) and we chose ` one to three ' consecutive hits in order to allow for inclined tracks .",
    "once this coincidence condition was met , the hit positions ( in x and y ) and the timestamps were buffered whilst waiting to be transferred .",
    "the timestamp clock was reset and the four daq boxes in use were synchronized by external pulses , provided by the clock distributor@xcite which was operated at 1  khz .",
    "the signal line lengths in the daq box were designed to be identical so that the propagation inside did not bias the coincidence judgment .",
    "the propagation time difference from the scintillator to the daq box input was 10  ns at maximum and we verified that a coincidence window of 16  ns was appropriate for the x - y units .",
    "the unit coincidence data ( x and y hit positions , and timestamps ) were transferred to a pc , where they were examined for coincidence in unit-1 and unit-2 over a 32  ns time window .",
    "if the event was judged acceptable , these unit coincidence data were stored together with those from unit-3 and unit-4 that had the closest timestamps .",
    "the light yield of the scintillator / fiber - mppc system was typically 15 photoelectrons for @xmath5 rays penetrating near the scintillator end opposite to the readout end , which is comfortably high to detect muons .",
    "the threshold voltages of all 800 channels were at first adjusted to discriminate the noise contribution .",
    "the response uniformity in a plane was then examined using muons recorded as coincidence in the x - y unit placed horizontally .",
    "we accumulated about 10k events per channel where events with only one hit in each plane were accepted .",
    "the rms variation of the counting uniformity ranged from 16% to 19% .",
    "the obtained non - uniformity includes the effects of cross talk to neighboring scintillators .",
    "measurement of the muon momentum provides additional information on the remote mass distribution and should help improve the radiography image by choosing tracks in an appropriate momentum range .",
    "also , the muon momentum information was indispensable in simulations to predict the obtained image . in light of this",
    "we constructed a permanent toroidal magnet with a magnetic field of 1.4  t in collaboration with neomax engineering@xcite .",
    "as the results using the measured momentum information are beyond the context of this paper and are to be reported in a separate paper ; we will not discuss this issue further here .",
    "the system was transported to the japc on february 24@xmath6 , 2012 and installed outside the reactor building at a distance to the reactor center of 64 m at an angle of 22@xmath7 with respect to one of the building s walls .",
    "although the detector started data acquisition on the same day , some detector threshold adjustments were carried out for the first few days . in the period up to june 18@xmath6 , 2012 (",
    "referred to here as period-1 ) , the detector system was aimed at the center of the fuel loading zone by adjusting the relative heights of unit-1 and unit-2 . in the period from june 28@xmath6 to october 5@xmath6 ( referred to here as period-2 ) , the elevation of unit-1 was raised , thus aiming the detector at the fuel storage pool .",
    "the time window to judge an x - y coincidence inside the same unit was fixed to 16 ns .",
    "the time difference between unit-1 and unit-2 was then used to judge whether the event was to be recorded or not . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : dtime ] where the time difference , t(unit-1)@xmath8t(unit-2 ) , is plotted , the mean of the time difference distribution was shifted from zero , reflecting that tracks coming from the front were dominant in this configuration .",
    "this asymmetry was caused by the different zenith angle coverage for the tracks coming from the front and back ( unit-1 was elevated by 20 cm in period-1 ) , and by the magnet behind .",
    "events within a 32  ns time window were retained .",
    "[ fig : accum ] summarizes the number of recorded events and the trigger rates during period-1 and period-2 . in total ,",
    "6.3 million events and 7.1  million events were accumulated in period-1 ( over 114 days ) and period-2 ( over 99 days ) , respectively . in both periods",
    "the accumulated number of events increased linearly with days ( except for initial threshold adjustments period in period-1 ) , verifying that the detector was operated stably in the period over 7 months .",
    "each data acquisition run lasted 30 min and the trigger rate in fig .",
    "[ fig : accum ] is calculated for each run . in period-1",
    ", the trigger rate showed a peak at 0.85 hz , and a tail in the lower frequencies .",
    "the mppc gain is temperature dependent and decreases typically by 2.2% per degree .",
    "the tail was a result of this gain variation against fixed threshold , which happened to be unexpectedly wide due to a large variation of the room temperature from 10@xmath0c to 28@xmath0c caused by a lack of thermal insulation against the container walls . towards the end of period-1 , thermal insulation of the container",
    "was accomplished . also at the beginning of each data acquisition run",
    ", the room temperature was used to scale the threshold values for the mppcs . as evident , the trigger rate was very stable in period-2 , averaging at 0.9  hz .    the reduced trigger rate in period-1 was associated with non - uniform detector efficiency additionally to the response non - uniformity described in [ nonuniform ] .",
    "such non - uniformity , though , has little impact on the image of the reactor 64  m away .",
    "this is understandable since the track projections with the same differences of hit scintillator numbers in the two tracking units are localized within 1  m , therefore the reactor image where we employed a bin size of 40  cm is obtained essentially integrating over the local non - uniformity of the detector response .",
    "the above estimate was verified by examining the projected image using tracks coming from behind ; no structure other than the acceptance was created since no massive structure was present .",
    "we also have verified that these low trigger rate runs did not introduce any spurious projections of tracks .",
    "after these studies , we only selected runs with a trigger rate above 0.5 hz for further analysis .",
    "since the daq system selected only events with a single cluster of hits per plane , tracking was straightforward .",
