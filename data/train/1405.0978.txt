    "these difficulties are overcome by using the domb - joyce model for a particular value of @xmath207 @xcite , @xmath211 . for this value of the repulsion parameter ,",
    "the leading scaling corrections have a negligible amplitude @xcite , so that scaling corrections decay faster , approximately as @xmath212 . as a consequence ,",
    "scaling results are obtained by using significantly shorter chains .",
    "unfortunately , in the presence of a repulsive surface , new renormalization - group operators arise , which are associated with the surface @xcite .",
    "the leading one gives rise to corrections that scale as @xmath213 @xcite , where @xmath214 is the flory exponent ( an explicit test of this prediction is presented in the supplementary material ) , hence it spoils somewhat the nice scaling behavior observed in the absence of colloids . nonetheless , the domb - joyce model is still very convenient from a computational point of view . since interactions are soft ,",
    "the monte carlo dynamics for domb - joyce chains is much faster than for saws .",
    "we shall use the algorithm described in ref .",
    "@xcite , which allows one to obtain precise results for quite long chains ( @xmath215 ) deep in the semidilute regime .",
    "the domb - joyce model can also be used to derive the crossover functions that parametrize the crossover between the good - solvent and @xmath0-point regimes , at least not too close to the @xmath0 point , see refs .",
    "@xcite for a discussion . indeed ,",
    "if one neglects tricritical effects , which are only relevant close to the @xmath0 point @xcite , this crossover can be parametrized by using the two - parameter model @xcite .",
    "two - parameter - model results are obtained @xcite by taking the limit @xmath216 , @xmath217 at fixed @xmath218 .",
    "the variable @xmath219 interpolates between the ideal - chain limit ( @xmath220 ) and the good - solvent limit ( @xmath221 ) . indeed , for @xmath222",
    "the domb - joyce model is simply the random - walk model , while for any @xmath223 and @xmath217 one always obtains the good - solvent scaling behavior .",
    "the variable @xmath219 is proportional to the variable @xmath192 that is used in the context of the two - parameter model .",
    "we normalize @xmath192 as in refs .",
    "@xcite , setting @xmath224 note that the crossover can be equivalently parametrized @xcite by using the second - virial combination @xmath225 ( @xmath9 is the zero - density radius of gyration ) , which varies between the good - solvent value @xcite @xmath226 and @xmath227 at the @xmath0 point . with normalization ( [ zdef - dj ] )",
    "we have @xmath228 for small @xmath192 @xcite .",
    "the correspondence between @xmath15 and @xmath192 in the whole crossover region is given in ref .",
    "@xcite .    as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the two - parameter - model results can be obtained from monte carlo simulations of the domb - joyce model by properly extrapolating the numerical results to @xmath229 . for each @xmath192",
    "we consider several chain lengths @xmath230 .",
    "for each of them we determine the interaction parameter @xmath231 by using eq .",
    "( [ zdef - dj ] ) , that is we set @xmath232 .",
    "simulations of chains of @xmath230 monomers are then performed setting @xmath233 .",
    "simulation results are then extrapolated to @xmath217 , taking into account that corrections are of order @xmath234 @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we have performed a detailed study of the depletion for two values of @xmath192 : @xmath235 and @xmath236 , which correspond to @xcite @xmath237 and @xmath238 .",
    "they correspond to polymer solutions of intermediate quality .",
    "since @xmath239 @xcite under good - solvent conditions , we have @xmath240 and 0.54 for @xmath241 and @xmath242 , respectively .",
    "hence , for @xmath241 we are quite close to the @xmath0 point , while @xmath243 is intermediate between the good - solvent and @xmath0 regimes .    in this paper",
    "we discuss depletion effects close to neutral colloids , which are modelled as hard spheres that can move everywhere in space : their centers are not constrained to belong to a lattice point .",
    "this choice is particularly convenient since it drastically reduces lattice oscillations in colloid - polymer correlation functions .",
    "such oscillations are instead present if colloids are required to sit on lattice points , as was done in ref .",
    "colloids and monomers interact by means of a simple exclusion potential .",
    "if @xmath244 and @xmath245 are the coordinates of a monomer and of a colloid , we take as interaction potential @xmath246",
    "as we have seen in sec .",
    "[ sec2.3 ] , the low - density behavior of the surface tension or , equivalently , of the depletion thickness can be obtained by computing the virial coefficients @xmath247 and @xmath248 .",
    "we will thus report the computation of these two quantities and also of @xmath249 , which would be relevant to characterize the effective interaction between two colloids in a dilute solution of polymers .",
    "then , we shall discuss the depletion thickness @xmath78 for @xmath250 and its first density correction ."
