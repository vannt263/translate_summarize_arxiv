    "454 is a powerful flat - spectrum radio quasar located at a redshift @xmath3 .",
    "this source is very bright in the gev energy range ; during strong flares , its apparent ( isotropic ) luminosity can reach @xmath4  erg  s@xmath5 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the mass of the central black hole ( bh ) in 454 is estimated in the range @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "this implies an eddington luminosity @xmath7 , which is several orders of magnitude below @xmath8 .",
    "although the large gap within @xmath9 and @xmath8 is naturally explained by relativistic doppler boosting , the estimates of the jet power during these flares appear , in any realistic scenario , close to or even larger than the eddington luminosity @xcite .",
    "the gev emission from 454 is highly erratic , with variability timescales as short as 3  hr , as reported , in particular , for the december 2009 flare @xcite .",
    "the most spectacular flare regarding both variability and gamma - ray luminosity was observed in november 2010 by and @xcite telescopes . during this high state , with the most active phase lasting for 5 days ,",
    "the apparent luminosity in gev achieved @xmath10 . around the flare maximum ,",
    "the rising time was @xmath11  hr , and the decay time , @xmath12  hr .",
    "the detection of photons with energies up to @xmath13  gev , the short variability , and the contemporaneous x - ray flux constrain the doppler boosting of the emitter to @xmath14 to avoid severe internal @xmath15 absorption in the x - ray radiation field @xcite .",
    "a remarkable feature of the gamma - ray emission from 454 is the so - called plateau phase revealed during the bright flare in 2010 .",
    "it is characterized by a long - term brightening of the source , a few weeks before the appearance of the main flare .",
    "such plateau states have been observed by for three flares ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with the plateau emission being about an order of magnitude fainter than that of the main flare .    remarkably , the rapid gamma - ray variability of 454 is accompanied by an activity at lower energies .",
    "the simultaneous multiwavelength observations of the source during flares have revealed a strong correlation with optical and x - rays .",
    "it has been interpreted as evidence that the gamma - ray source is located upstream from the core of the 43  ghz radio source , which is at a distance @xmath16  few  pc from the central bh ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    over the recent years",
    ", several works have attempted to explain the flaring gamma - ray activity of 454 within the framework of the standard synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) or external inverse - compton ( eic ) models @xcite . in the ssc scenario , it is possible to reproduce the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) from optical wavelengths to gamma - rays . in these models",
    "most of the jet power is ( unavoidably ) carried by protons , and only a small fraction is contained in relativistic electrons and the magnetic field .",
    "the required proton - to - poynting flux ratio of @xmath17 is quite large .",
    "such a configuration would be hard to reconcile , at least in the gamma - ray emitting region close to the central bh , with an undisturbed jet which is launched by the blandford - znajek @xcite type ( bz ) process , in which the luminosity of the jet is dominated by poynting flux and the jet consists of @xmath18-pairs . in this regard",
    "we should mention that recent relativistic magnetohydrodynamical ( mhd ) simulations of jet acceleration yield much less efficiency of conversion of the magnetic energy into bulk motion kinetic energy ; these calculations @xcite predict a quite modest ratio @xmath19 .",
    "the jet - rg interaction ( jrgi ) scenario has been invoked to explain the day - scale flares in the nearby non - blazar type agn m87 @xcite , it has been applied also to the tev blazar   @xcite to demonstrate that the jet - driven acceleration of debris from the rg atmosphere can explain ultra - fast variability of very high - energy gamma - ray emission on timescales as short as @xmath20  s. a distinct feature of the jrgi scenario is the high magnetization ( @xmath21 ) of the relativistic flows located at sub - parsec distances , where the gamma - ray production supposedly takes place . although the strong magnetic field ,",
    "@xmath22  g , dramatically reduces the efficiency of the inverse compton scattering of electrons , it opens an alternative channel of gamma - ray production through synchrotron radiation of protons @xcite .",
    "the latter can be effectively realized only in the case of acceleration of protons to the highest possible energies , up to @xmath23ev .",
    "thus the second ( somewhat  hidden \" ) requirement of this model is a very effective acceleration of protons with a rate close to the theoretical limit dictated by the classical electrodynamics @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that also inverse compton models can be accommodated , at least in principle , in the jrgi scenario .",
    "moreover , unlike most of the leptonic models of powerful blazars , in which the requirement of a very low magnetic field , implying a deviation from the equipartition condition by orders of magnitude , generally is not addressed and explained , the jrgi scenario can offer a natural way for leptonic models to be effective assuming that the gamma - ray emission is produced through the inverse compton scattering in shocked clouds originally weakly magnetized ( see * ? ? ? * ) .    in this work , we show that the jrgi scenario gives a viable mechanism for the explanation of the flares seen in 454 .",
    "we also argue that within this model the plateau state can form due to the interaction of the jet with a stellar wind excited by nonthermal ( accelerated ) particles that penetrate into the red giant atmosphere .",
    "in the _ fast cooling regime _ , the proper intensity of the nonthermal emission , i.e. the intensity in the blob co - moving reference frame , is proportional to the energy released at the jet - blob interface .",
    "this energy release can be characterized by a simple dynamical model , which describes the acceleration of the blob by the jet ram pressure . in this model",
    "there are just a few relevant parameters that describe the basic properties of the jet and the blob : the jet ram pressure ( @xmath24 ) and bulk lorentz factor ( @xmath25 ) , and the blob mass ( @xmath26 ) and radius ( @xmath27 ; or , equivalently , its cross - section : @xmath28 ) ( for details , see * ? ? ?",
    "the time dependence of the intensity of the jet / blob interaction corrected for the doppler boosting can be treated as a first - order approximation for the radiation lightcurve .",
    "the mass of the cloud @xmath29 formed at the initial stage can be estimated by comparing the jet ram pressure , @xmath30 with the gravitational force . here , @xmath31 is the jet cross - section at the star crossing height .",
    "this gives the following estimate : @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the rg mass and radius , respectively .    since the initial size of the expelled cloud should be comparable to the size of the star , it is possible to estimate the cloud expansion time as @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the sound speed of the shocked material : @xmath37^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "the cloud expansion time is @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the plasma adiabatic coefficient , and according to the rhd simulation by @xcite , a value of @xmath40 can be adopted for @xmath41 .",
    "the blob acceleration occurs on a timescale of @xcite @xmath42 the @xmath43parameter that will be often used in the paper has a simple meaning .",
    "it is a dimensionless inverse mass of the blob : @xmath44 the above timescale corresponds to the blob acceleration in the laboratory reference frame .",
    "however , since the blob gets accelerated towards the observer , the emission delay , as seen by the observer , should be approximately corrected by a factor of @xmath45 .",
    "thus , the observed peak of the emission should be delayed by a time interval of @xmath46    the emission produced by lighter clouds allows an estimation of the time required for the star to cross the jet .",
    "once the star enters into the jet , the process of jet - star interaction should proceed steadily , with the production of these lighter clouds being roughly constant on average .",
    "thus , the whole duration of the light cloud - associated emission , if observed , can be taken as a direct measurement of the jet crossing time @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the star velocity . adopting the paradigm of magnetically - accelerated jets ,",
    "it is possible to derive a very simple expression for this timescale : @xmath49 in this way , the duration of the jet - star interaction is determined by the interaction distance from the central bh .    assuming a fixed efficiency @xmath50 in the blob reference frame for the transfer of jet power to nonthermal gamma rays ( where @xmath51 ) , and correcting for doppler boosting",
    ", one can estimate the luminosity of a blob : @xmath52 where the correction function @xmath53 depends on time ; or , equivalently , on the blob location in the jet .",
    "we note that the structure of the jet , i.e. , the dependence of the jet lorentz factor on @xmath54 , determines the actual dependence of @xmath53 on @xmath54 .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath53 monotonically depends on the @xmath43 parameter , approaching a value of @xmath55 if @xmath56 and being @xmath57 for @xmath58 .",
    "this relatively weak dependence allows us to derive the maximum blob luminosity .",
    "also it is possible to obtain an estimate of the total energy emitted by a blob or an ensemble of sub - blobs as a result of the fragmentation of the original cloud ( @xmath59 ) , @xmath60 which accounts for the total energy transferred by the jet to a blob during the acceleration process , @xmath61 , and for the anisotropy of the emission due to relativistic effects represented by the factor @xmath62 .",
    "the total apparent energy of the gev gamma - ray radiation detected during the flare observed from 454 in november 2010 was about @xmath63 .",
    "the exceptionally high flux during this period allows the derivation of a very detailed lightcurve , as seen from figure  1 in @xcite .",
    "the nonthermal activity lasted for @xmath64  days .",
    "the onset of the activity period was characterized by a plateau stage . during the first @xmath65  days ,",
    "a rather steady flux was detected , with an apparent luminosity @xmath66  erg  s@xmath5 .",
    "the plateau stage was followed by an exceptionally bright flare , the total duration which was @xmath67  days , with a rise time of @xmath68  h. the maximum flux reached was @xmath69 , which corresponds to a luminosity of @xmath70 .",
    "the final stage of the flare phase was characterized by variable emission with a flux approximately a factor of @xmath71 weaker than the main flare , but still a factor of @xmath72 above the plateau level .",
    "the observed luminosity of the plateau phase allow us to determine a lower limit on the star mass - loss rate , which can be derived by differentiating equation  ( [ eq_toten ] ) : @xmath73 where @xmath74 .    to evaluate the feasibility of the jrgi scenario for the 454 main flare , it is necessary to check whether the flux , the total energy release , and the flare delay with respect to the onset of the plateau , are well described by equations  [ eq_delay ] , [ eq_lum ] , and [ eq_toten ] for a reasonable choice of jet / star properties .",
    "a total energy budget of the flare of @xmath75 is feasible , according to equation  ( [ eq_toten ] ) , if @xmath76 where @xmath77  g is the mass of the blown up rg envelop ( i.e. the initially formed cloud ) .",
    "this requirement appears to be very close to the one provided by equation  [ dms ] : @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath80 , respectively .",
    "the second term in equation  [ eq_delay ] is expected to be short compared to the duration of the plateau phase , even for @xmath81 , and thus the duration of the initial plateau phase constrains the expansion time ( see equation  ( [ eq_expansion ] ) ) : @xmath82 @xmath83    @xcite found that the emission of the main flare consisted of 5 components ( see figure  2 in that work ) : a nearly steady contribution , like a smooth continuation of the plateau emission , and 4 sub - flares of similar duration and energetics . in the framework of the jrgi scenario ,",
    "such a description is very natural .",
    "the steady component would be attributed to light clouds , continuously ejected by the star , and the four sub - flares would correspond to much heavier blobs formed out of the blown - up stellar envelop during the initial stage . on the other hand , the decomposition of the main flare in four sub - flares implies a strict limitation on the variability timescale .",
    "the flare rise / decay timescales should be longer than the blob light crossing time corrected for the doppler boosting .",
    "since the shortest variability scale was @xmath84  s , the maximum possible size of the emitting blobs can be estimated as : @xmath85    if the jet is magnetically driven , this size constraint can be expressed through the mass of the central bh : @xmath86 which is restrictive only in the case of @xmath87 . for @xmath88 , the blobs can cover the entire jet without violating the causality constraint .    in summary ,",
    "if the flare detected with was produced by an rg entering into the jet , the jet properties should satisfy to the restrictions imposed by the flux level , total energy release , and the duration of the plateau stage , respectively .",
    "interestingly , this set of equations allows the derivation of a _",
    "unique _ solution , which can constrain all the key parameters through the value of the @xmath43 parameter :    @xmath89    @xmath90    @xmath91    and @xmath92 the lower limit on the jet luminosity is @xmath93 which exceeds the eddington limit for the mass of the central bh @xmath94 . to assess the feasibility of such a strongly super - eddington jet remains out of the scope of this paper , although we note that @xcite have presented observational evidence indicating that such jets may not be uncommon .",
    "the coherent picture emanating from the jet properties derived above suggests that the jrgi scenario can be responsible for the flare detected from 454 for a solution of the problem with a reasonable set of model parameters .",
    "this solution is designed to satisfy the requirements for ( i ) the total energy ; ( ii ) the peak luminosity ; and ( iii ) the duration of the plateau phase .",
    "therefore , some additional observational tests are required to prove the feasibility of the suggested scenario .",
    "finally , the flare raise time , which is related to the blob acceleration timescale ( see equation  [ dtpeak ] ) , can be calculated for the obtained solution .",
    "interestingly , in the limit of small @xmath43-values , this timescale appears to be independent on @xmath43 , the only remaining free parameter , and matches closely the detected raise time of @xmath95 : @xmath96 this agreement can be treated as a cross - check that shows the feasibility of the proposed scenario .",
    "to check whether jrgi plus synchrotron radiation can explain the observations in the case of magnetically dominated jets ( i.e. , @xmath97 ) , we have computed the lightcurve of the november 2010 flare and the sed for one of its subflares .",
    "the radiation output was assumed to be dominated by proton synchrotron , being external or synchrotron self - compton neglected due to the strong magnetic field .    to derive the lightcurve ,",
    "equation  [ eq_lum ] has been used . in figure",
    "[ lc ] , a computed lightcurve that approximately mimics the november 2010 flare is presented .",
    "the lightcurve has been obtained assuming four subflares of total ( apparent ) energy of @xmath98  erg each , plus a plateau component with luminosity of @xmath99  erg  s@xmath5 . for each subflare ,",
    "we have adopted @xmath58 .",
    "the normalization of the lightcurve has been determined adopting the following values : the lorentz factor @xmath100 , the ram pressure @xmath101  erg  @xmath102 , blob radius @xmath103  cm and @xmath104 .",
    "these parameters imply a minimum jet luminosity of @xmath105  erg  s@xmath5 .",
    "the remaining parameters for the emitter are @xmath106  cm and @xmath107  g. the corresponding mass of the matter lost by the rg to explain the four subflares is @xmath108  g , not far from the upper - limit given in equation  [ dms ] .    to calculate the sed ,",
    "we have adopted a spectrum for the injected protons @xmath109 , and an homogeneous ( one - zone ) emitter moving towards the observer with lorentz factor @xmath110 .",
    "the minimum proton lorentz factor has been taken equal to the shock lorentz factor in the blob frame , i.e. @xmath111 . the cutoff energy , @xmath112 , has been obtained fixing @xmath113 , i.e. , a relatively modest acceleration efficiency . for the maximum proton energy , i.e.",
    "how far beyond the cutoff the proton energy is considered , we adopted two values : @xmath114 and @xmath115 . regarding the latter case , we note that assuming a sharp high - energy cut is very natural .",
    "the injection spectrum was selected to be hard , @xmath116 , to optimize the required energetics .    in figure",
    "[ sed ] , the sed of a subflare is shown .",
    "the impact of the internal absorption on the gamma - ray spectrum is negligible , although the emission of the secondary pairs appears in the energy band constrained by optical measurements @xcite . for the chosen model parameters , the synchrotron secondary component goes right through the optical observational constraints , and for slightly higher @xmath117-values",
    ", the secondary emission will be well below the optical points . also , we note that the obtained spectrum does not violate the x - ray upper - limits obtained by _",
    "swift_.    to illustrate the impact of external @xmath15 absorption , we have introduced a photon field peaking at 40  ev with a luminosity @xmath118  erg  s@xmath5 , produced in a ring with radius @xmath119  cm at @xmath120 around the jet base .",
    "two photon fields have been adopted , a black body and one represented by a @xmath121-function , to simulate the impact of a dominant spectroscopic line . as seen in figure  [",
    "sed ] , the impact of such an external field can be important .",
    "the treatment of the secondary emission of the produced pairs is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "in addition to optical photons , radio emission was also detected at the flare epoch and thought to be linked to the gamma - ray activity @xcite .",
    "this radiation is strongly sensitive to the details of the flow dynamics , and at this stage we will not try to interpret radio observations .",
    "however , we note that the energetics involved in gamma - ray production is very large , and jrgi comprehends complex magnetohydrodynamical and radiative processes , so it could easily accommodate the presence of a population of radio - emitting electrons at @xmath122 .",
    "_ swift _ x - rays could be also linked to the jrgi activity .",
    "x - rays may come from secondary pairs produced via pair creation , or from a primary population of electrons(/positrons ) .",
    "however , as with radio data , given the complexity of the problem we have not tried at this stage to explain the x - ray emission contemporaneous to the gev flare .",
    "erg  s@xmath5 , @xmath123  cm @xmath124 , @xmath125  g , @xmath126  cm , and @xmath104 .",
    "we show 4 subflares ( dashed lines ) , plateau background ( dot - dashed line ) , and the sum of all of them ( solid line ) .",
    "the observational data points and error bars are obtained from the 3h binned count rates and photon index using luminosity distance of @xmath127 and assuming a pure powerlaw spectrum between 0.1 and 5  gev.,scaledwidth=43.0% ]    . dotted and dot - dot - dashed line shows gamma - ray spectra corrected for internal absorption only for @xmath114 and @xmath115 , respectively .",
    "the thin solid and the dot - dashed lines correspond to the cases when absorption is dominated by a black body and a monoenergetic photon field , respectively .",
    "the computed synchrotron sed of the secondary pairs produced via internal pair creation is also shown ( dotted line ) .",
    "the parameters of the flare are the same as in figure  [ lc ] .",
    "the shown observational data are from , swift @xcite , and the flux in the r band @xcite.,scaledwidth=43.0% ]",
    "the observations of 454 with _ fermi",
    "_ revealed several quite puzzling features , in particular the peculiar lightcurve , with a nearly steady plateau phase that was interrupted by an exceptionally bright flare .",
    "the detected flux corresponds to an apparent luminosity of @xmath128 , which almost unavoidably implies a presence of a very powerful jet ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the case of powerful jets , the jrgi scenario should proceed in a quite specific way as compared to other cases already considered in the literature @xcite . in particular , the mass of the material initially removed from the star might be very large , resulting in rather long cloud expansion and acceleration timescales , the main flare being significantly delayed with respect to the moment of the star entrance into the jet .",
    "the plateau emission would otherwise start just after the jet penetration , and come from the jet crushing of lighter clouds ejected from the stellar surface while the star travels through the jet .",
    "the duration of the plateau phase would be determined by the time required by the main cloud to expand and accelerate .",
    "we have studied the lightcurve obtained with _",
    "fermi _ in the context of the jrgi scenario aiming to satisfy three main properties of the flare : total energy , maximum luminosity and duration of the plateau stage .",
    "it was shown that the key properties of the jet , i.e. the jet ram pressure ( linked to its luminosity ) and lorentz factor , as well as the cloud / blob characteristics , i.e. mass and cross section , can be reconstructed as functions of the dimensionless parameter @xmath43 .",
    "it was also shown that in the limit of small @xmath43-values , the parameter space is less demanding concerning the jet luminosity , and the key characteristics of the model saturate at values independent of @xmath43 , which allows conclusive cross - checks of the scenario .",
    "in particular , the flare raise time appeared to be an independent parameter , with its value of @xmath129h closely matching the rising time of of @xmath130h obtained observationally .",
    "furthermore , it was shown ( see @xcite ) that for the inferred jet properties the jet - induced stellar wind can provide a mass - loss rate large enough to generate a steady emission component with a luminosity comparable to that of the plateau .",
    "although the analysis of different radiation channels involves additional assumptions regarding the spectrum of the nonthermal particles and density of the target fields , it was possible to show that for magnetic fields not far below equipartition ( as expected in a magnetically launched jet ) all the conventional radiation channels can be discarded , and the emission detected with _",
    "fermi _ can be produced through proton synchrotron emission ( unless @xmath131 , making electron synchrotron also feasible ) .",
    "we note that in this case the emission from pairs created within the blob may also explain the reported optical enhancement at the flare epoch .    since the duration of the expansion phase determines the delay between the onset of the plateau phase and the flare itself , it is important to check whether the suggested scenario is consistent with other flares registered with _",
    "fermi _ from the source , e.g. , in december 2009 and april 2010 @xcite .",
    "this issue can be addressed through a simple scaling that relates the duration of the plateau phase to the total energy released during the active phase : @xmath132 .",
    "therefore , for the previous events , with energy releases 1 - 2 orders of magnitude smaller than that of the november 2010 flare , a rough estimation of the plateau duration gives plateau durations between @xmath133 and @xmath134 days , consistent with observations .",
