    "the @xmath80 gate can be performed in parallel on all the required qubits and computation will be speed up .",
    "for example , when inversion - on - equality gate was implemented in a 3-qubit systems ( section - ii ) , the implementation was parallel and faster because two of the j - couplings were identical . unlike other systems where",
    "qubits are identified and addressed in space , in nmr , the qubits are identified and addressed in frequency - space .",
    "hence , it is mandatory that the spectrum be well resolved in nmr .",
    "when systems with same j - couplings are used , the transitions between the states overlap and resolution is lost , causing problems with identification of states .",
    "nevertheless , the present work validates the efficiency of quantum shallow circuits which will be a useful experience when such circuits are implemented in other physical systems where qubits are addressed in space , like solid - state devices @xcite , quantum dots @xcite , photons @xcite and trapped - ions @xcite .",
