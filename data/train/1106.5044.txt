    "recently , in @xcite it is proved that an integrable @xmath0 planar differential system is roughly speaking @xmath0equivalent to the linear differential system @xmath7 .",

    "we show that such a system can always be realized as a hamilton - poisson dynamical system on a full measure open subset of @xmath1 with respect to a rank 2 poisson structure . in the third section a new time transformation",
    "will be explicitly constructed in order to bring the system to a linear differential system of the type @xmath6 . in the last section",
    "we illustrate the main results in the case of two concrete dynamical systems , namely the three dimensional lotka - volterra system , and respectively the euler equations from the free rigid body dynamics",
    ".    for details on poisson geometry and hamiltonian dynamics , see , e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "in this section we give a method to construct a hamilton - poisson divergence free vector field , naturally associated with a given hamilton - poisson realization of a @xmath8 dimensional differential system admitting @xmath2 independent conservation laws .",
    "first step in this approach is to construct a hamilton - poisson realization of a given @xmath8 dimensional differential system admitting @xmath2 independent integrals of motion .",
    "let us consider a @xmath0 differential system on @xmath1 : @xmath9 where @xmath10 are arbitrary real functions .",
    "suppose that @xmath11 are @xmath2 independent @xmath3 integrals of motion of defined on a nonempty open subset @xmath4 .",
    "since @xmath11 are integrals of motion of the vector field @xmath12 , we obtain that for each @xmath13 @xmath14 for every @xmath15 , where @xmath16 stand for the canonical inner product on @xmath1 , and respectively @xmath17 stand for the gradient with respect to @xmath16 .    hence , by a standard multilinear algebra argument , the @xmath18 vector field @xmath19 is given as the @xmath18 vector field @xmath20 multiplied by a @xmath18 real function ( rescaling function ) , where @xmath21 stand for the hodge star operator for multivector fields ( see for details e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it may happen that the domain of definition for the rescaling function to be a proper subset of @xmath5 . in the following",
    "we will consider the generic case when the rescaling function is defined on an open and dense subset of @xmath5 . in order to simplify the notations",
    ", we will also denote this set by @xmath5 .",
    "consequently , the vector field @xmath19 can be realized on the open set @xmath4 as the hamilton - poisson vector field @xmath22 with respect to the hamiltonian function @xmath23 and respectively the poisson bracket of class @xmath18 defined by : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a given real function ( rescaling ) . for @xmath26 , the associated poisson bracket in the smooth category , it is exactly the flaschka - raiu bracket . for similar hamilton - poisson formulations of completely integrable systems",
    "see also @xcite , @xcite .    in coordinates ,",
    "the bracket @xmath27 is given by : @xmath28    note that @xmath29 is a complete set of casimirs for the poisson bracket @xmath30 .",
    "recall that the hamiltonian vector field @xmath31 is acting on an arbitrary real function @xmath32 , @xmath33 as : @xmath34    hence , the differential system can be locally written in @xmath5 as a hamilton - poisson dynamical system of the type : @xmath35 or equivalently @xmath36    consequently , the components of the vector field @xmath37 which generates the differential system , are given in @xmath5 as follows : @xmath38 for @xmath39 .    next result gives a method to construct a divergence free vector field out of the vector field @xmath19 .",
    "the divergence operator we will use in this approach is the divergence associated with the standard lebesgue measure on @xmath1 , namely @xmath40 , where @xmath41 stand for the lie derivative along the vector field @xmath19 .",

    "the vector field @xmath47 is a hamilton - poisson vector field with respect to the flaschka - raiu bracket , and having the same hamiltonian @xmath48 as the vector field @xmath19 .",
    "hence , the divergence of @xmath47 is given by : @xmath49 where the notation `` @xmath50 '' means that `` @xmath51 '' is omitted .",
    "let us now analyze the general term in the above sum . by using the derivative of a determinant",
    "we obtain the following : @xmath52 hence , @xmath53 next we prove that each of the above sums vanishes . in order to do that ,",
    "it is enough to show that the general sum @xmath54 vanishes , where @xmath55 indeed , we obtain that : @xmath56\\cdot\\dfrac{\\partial(c_1,\\dots,\\widehat{c}_k,\\dots , c_{n-2},h)}{\\partial(x_1,\\dots,\\widehat{x}_j,\\dots,\\widehat{x}_i,\\dots , x_n)}\\\\ & = 0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the symplectic case , each hamiltonian vector field is divergence free with respect to the divergence operator defined by the liouville volume form .",
    "in this section we give a unified linear formulation for the @xmath8 dimensional differential systems admitting a set of @xmath2 independent conservation laws .",
    "the construction of this linear formulation makes use explicitly of the hamilton - poisson realization of a differential system of type .",
    "let us now state the main result of this article .",

    "then , the change of variables @xmath61 given by @xmath62 in the open and dense subset @xmath63 of @xmath58 , transforms the system restricted to @xmath64 into the linear differential system @xmath6 , where `` prime '' stand for the derivative with respect to the new time `` @xmath65 '' .",

    "recall by theorem that the vector filed @xmath69 is a divergence free vector field on @xmath64 .",
    "since @xmath70 and @xmath71 , we obtain that : @xmath72 after the change of variables in @xmath64 , the system becomes : @xmath73 where we used the relation and the fact that @xmath74 are conservation laws for the vector field @xmath19 , and consequently @xmath75 now using the new time transformation @xmath76 on @xmath64 , the system becomes : @xmath77 where @xmath78 , for @xmath39 .",
    "[ okrem ] if the rescaling function @xmath79 is a constant function , then the lebesgue measure of the set @xmath80 is nonzero in @xmath58 , and hence the assumptions of the theorem do not hold . in this case ,",

    "the transformation between the differential system and the differential system generated by the vector field @xmath82 is done by using the new time transformation @xmath89 .",
    "more exactly , the differential system generated by @xmath19 , namely : @xmath90 is transformed via the new time transformation @xmath89 into the system : @xmath91 the differential system can also be realized as a hamilton - poisson dynamical system with respect to the poisson bracket @xmath92 and respectively the same hamiltonian @xmath48 as for the hamilton - poisson realization of the vector field @xmath19 .",
    "in this section we will apply the main result of this article in the case of two concrete dynamical systems , namely a 3d lotka - volterra system and respectively euler s equations of the free rigid body dynamics .",
    "let us start with the lotka - volterra system .",
