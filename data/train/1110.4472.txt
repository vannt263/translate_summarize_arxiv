    "in recent years , the kolmogorov postulate on local isotropy ( pli ) has been examined by means of laboratory and numerical experiments ( @xcite@xcite ) .",
    "the current phenomenological interpretation of real turbulent flows is based on this postulate , which maintains that turbulence in fluids can achieve a universal state at small scales where fluctuations are supposed to become statistically isotropic , and as a consequence universal .",
    "the contravention of this postulate implies that small scales in a turbulent system interact directly with larger scales .",
    "thus , a sort of long - term interaction occurs and is able to induce anisotropy on the small scales , according to the symmetry properties of the system .",
    "direct communication between large and small scales at the same time undermines the concept of small - scale universality and that of energy cascade .",
    "the problem remains on how to examine the effects of large - scale anisotropy on small scales .",
    "the answer is to examine statistics that are sensitive to flow anisotropy .",
    "the main way of verifying the pli is based on turbulence studies at very high reynolds numbers ( @xmath0 and greater ) .",

    "the set - up often used to test the return to isotropy is a homogeneous shear flow in which the large - scale mean velocity has a linear profile . in many previous works ( e.g. @xcite )",
    ", researchers looked at the increments in the streamwise ( @xmath32 direction ) fluctuating velocity , @xmath33 , in the direction of the mean shear @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the transverse direction and @xmath36 is the mean velocity .    the effect of the reynolds number on turbulence small - scale anisotropy and intermittency is considered in an attempt to separate large and small scales , with respect to their size and energy , in order to reduce the probability of mutual communication , although taylor scale reynolds numbers of @xmath37 ( equivalent to a turbulence reynolds number based on the integral scale of @xmath38 ) can be achieved in the laboratory , it is argued @xcite that there is still a need to conduct experiments and computations at even higher reynolds numbers to resolve the outstanding basic and applied issues in turbulence .    in our opinion , this is not the only approach that can be used to test the pli .",
    "another approach is to focus on flows at a given taylor scale reynolds number and to slightly perturb the state of homogeneity and isotropy to see how and to what extent the perturbation is felt by the small scales during the transient .",
    "this method is inspired by the initial value problem in stability theory @xcite , where the basic laminar flow is arbitrarily perturbed by an infinitesimal perturbation with a given wavenumber .",
    "the mildest perturbation that can be conceived without forcing the turbulence ( i.e.  without introducing a production of kinetic energy in the system ) is that of varying the correlation length of the turbulence in the space , while avoiding the generation of a mean shear .",
    "as known , the coupling of shear with fluctuation is a source of kinetic energy .    in order to achieve this situation",
    ", we consider a numerical experiment in which we follow the time decay of a turbulent flow with an initially uniform distribution of turbulent kinetic energy , but where the integral scale has been varied slightly in two adjacent regions .",

    "this simple configuration allows us to investigate the generation of large - scale and small - scale anisotropy arising from the different decay rates of the two interacting isotropic fields , @xcite@xcite .",
    "the different decay exponents shown by the two fields generate an energy step , and thus a layer where the flow is neither homogeneous nor isotropic .",

    "the turbulent field @xmath19 has a taylor microscale reynolds number equal to 150 and is the same in all the simulations , which differ according to the smaller - scale flow @xmath20 .",
    "the three - dimensional spectra of the initial conditions are shown in figure [ fig.schema](c ) .",
    "the flows have the same global energy and the different slopes of the large - scale range of the spectra generate different integral scales .",
    "due to the use of periodic boundary conditions , there are two matching layers in the computational domain , see again part _ a _ of figure [ fig.schema ] .",
    "directions @xmath9 and @xmath10 in this flow configuration remain statistically homogeneous during the decay , so that all the statistics can be computed using plane averages in these homogeneous directions .",
    "in this experiment , we have a situation in which it can be observed that the introduction of an inhomogeneity of the correlation length in an otherwise homogeneous turbulence is sufficient to induce an inhomogeneity in the kinetic energy during the decay .",
    "this is a general feature that can be observed in all the present simulations . in figure [ fig.schema ] ( b ) , it is possible to see the gradual time differentiation of the portions of two flows in the central region of the simulation . in this case , the integral scale ratio is 2.8 .",
    "the flows with smaller integral scales decay faster and show higher decay exponents , see figure [ fig.decay-ratio ] .",
    "the decay exponent of the larger - scale flow , whose low wavenumber spectrum has a @xmath39 slope , is -1.15 , a result which is close to saffman s prediction @xcite .",
    "the other decay exponents are -1.3 , when the integral scale is reduced by 1.5 , -1.46 when it is reduced by 2.1 and -1.65 when is reduced by 2.8 , a situation where the low wavenumber spectrum approaches a @xmath40 slope ; see [ fig.schema](b ) and the inset in figure [ fig.decay-ratio ] ( _ a _ ) . as a consequence , the ratio between the energies in the two regions , initially equal to 1 , increases during the whole simulation ( figure [ fig.decay-ratio ] ( _ b _ ) ) . during the decay",
    ", the large correlation length scale flow also becomes the most energetic one , and an energy gradient , always concurrent with the integral scale gradient , soon emerges , as shown in figure [ fig.gradient-width ] .",
    "the concurrent presence of the gradients , the kinetic energy and the integral scale , in the absence of a mean shear , leads to intermittency and enhances turbulent transport @xcite , as discussed in the next section .",
    "the time evolution of the kinetic energy gradient is plotted in figure [ fig.gradient-width ] ( _ a _ ) .",
    "this gradient is maximum after about one initial eddy turnover time @xmath60 , which is defined on the initial scales of the field that has the largest correlation length ( @xmath43 is the initial turbulent kinetic energy and @xmath21 the correlation length ) .",
    "this gradient then gradually decays because the difference between energy levels 1 and 2 also decays in time , see [ fig.decay-ratio ] ( _ a _ ) .",
    "furthermore , the interaction length increases , see [ fig.gradient-width ] ( _ b _ ) .",
    "it can be noticed that the morphology of this transient is very similar to a pattern that is often encountered when observing three - dimensional asymptotically stable linear perturbations in sheared steady flows @xcite .",
    "here , however , the lifetime is much shorter than the typical lifetime of hydrodynamic stability , where this kind of transient can last hundreds , even thousands , of base flow timescales .",
    "however , at the basic level , the generation - growth - decay - extinction cycle of intermittency can be considered common in real turbulent flows and representative at a local ( zonal ) regional level .",
    "local perturbations , associated with more or less intense spatial and temporal variations of the correlation length , are in fact standard features in turbulence . in our opinion , they can be considered analogous to arbitrary perturbations in the hydrodynamic stability theory .",
    "the interaction that we consider can be interpreted as a long - term interaction , since the two isotropic fields are initially separated by a layer which is as thick as the larger correlation length @xmath21 .",
    "the first thing which should be noticed is the onset of a step variation of the turbulent energy from the initial flat distribution .",
    "one is therefore tempted to derive a general notion of dynamics : a sufficient condition for producing gradients of energy by nonlinear interaction is the presence of variations of the correlation lengths .",
    "the mechanism is associated with the different decay exponents that the turbulence shows in the first decade of eddy turnover times on the basis of different correlation lengths .",
    "we should recall that the larger the correlation length , the smaller the decay exponent @xmath61 , @xmath62 .",
    "a synthesis of the decay properties is presented in figure 3(a ) as a function of time and of the correlation scale @xmath63 . the inverse relationship between @xmath61 and the taylor microscale reynolds number",
    "is shown in the inset .",
    "the increase in the energy ratio across the interaction layer with time and with the gradient of the initial correlation length is presented in figure 3(b ) .",
    "it should be mentioned that , at a constant instant , for instance @xmath64 , a doubling of this scale gradient produces a quadrupling of the energy ratio , see the inset .",
    "the effect of this phenomenology is therefore very pronounced , and should be observable and measurable in the laboratory .",
    "the interaction lifetime is finite and can be better described in terms of the energy gradient that starts to be generated at the beginning of the interaction , see figure 4 _ a _ and _ b_. the gradient intensity is proportional to the ratio ( gradient ) of the correlation length and the maximum value is reached in a range of time which is inversely proportional to the gradient intensity .",
    "after the peak of the transient evolution is reached , a long decay phase appears , which is due , on one hand , to the growth in the width of the layer , and on the other , to the self - decay of the energy of the two isotropic fields . by extrapolating the instants in which the energy gradient becomes zero , on the basis of the results produced over the first 10 simulation timescales ( see in particular the log - linear version of the decay in figure 4(b ) )",
    ", it is possible to see that the lifetime increases almost proportionally to the initial scale ratio ; see the inset in figure 4(a ) .    this result can be understood and verified by observing the evolution in the diffusion thickness @xmath65 of the interaction layer . in figure 4 _ b _ , data from the present simulations are compared with data from a 3d reference simulation over the same computational domain ( the energy ratio is here 6.6 , with the two isotropic fields sharing the same integral scale @xcite ) , with data from one 2d simulation , with an energy ratio equal to 6.7 and a uniform integral scale @xcite , and with data from a wind tunnel laboratory experiments @xcite of shearfree turbulent mixings with a ratio of 6.7 .",
    "the mixing self - diffusion thickness @xmath65 is conventionally defined as the distance between the points where @xmath42 has values of 0.75 and 0.25 .",
    "@xmath43 and @xmath44 are the energy in the two homogeneous regions .",
    "the time has been normalized to the average eddy turnover time @xmath45 .",
    "we can observe that the diffusion lengths of the present simulations collapse very well with this normalization and grow in a slower manner ( @xmath66 ) than in the case where the initial energy gradient is nonzero .",
    "data related to a case with an energy gradient of about 0.45 j/(kg m ) , that is , @xmath67 , are shown in figure 4 _",
    "b_. @xmath68 and a good agreement between the simulation and laboratory results are observed in three dimensions .",
    "there is therefore an evident damping of the turbulent self - diffusion when passing from two - dimensional to three - dimensional dynamics . in the latter case ,",
    "an efficient driving is the initial presence of the energy gradient ; if this is lacking , the mild nonhomogeneity associated with the presence of an integral scale gradient still promotes diffusion , though at a lower rate . during the transient ,",
    "the two isotropic flows interact under both the initial macroscale gradient and the newly developed energy gradient , and develop an intermittent sublayer which shows lineaments similar to those found in shearless mixings , with an initially imposed energy gradient that has already been discussed in @xcite . in two dimensions , where the inverse cascade is active , @xmath69 . it should be noted , that , at present , a comparison with laboratory results is not yet available for either the present or the 2d numerical experiment .",
    "large - scale intermittency can be observed , looking at the velocity fluctuation @xmath33 in the @xmath32 direction , which is the component of the velocity vector that is responsible for the energy transport across the mixing .",
    "one can observe that the position of this peak moves , with respect to the centre of @xmath65 , towards the small correlation length side , see @xcite .",
    "the simulations start from a situation in which the statistics are closer to the isotropic ones , that is , a skewness 0 and a kurtosis close to 3 .",
    "it is possible to observe the gradual generation of intermittency in fig.[fig.sk - vel ] .",
    "it is interesting to note that , when the skewness and kurtosis values are plotted in the @xmath70 plane ( figure [ fig.sk-vel](c ) ) , all the three - dimensional simulations in part follow the same path , even through they individually present different growth rates and consequently tend to reach different levels of intermittency .",
    "we observe a quadratic relationship @xmath71 in this plane . in the case in which the energy gradient drives the interaction from the very beginning , we can observe an accumulation point ( @xmath72 ) , which can be interpreted as an asymptotic temporal condition .",
    "the intermittent behaviour is not limited to the large scales , i.e. the velocity moments .",
    "in fact , after a few initial eddy turnover times , the longitudinal derivative skewness , which is a normalized dimensionless measure of the average rate of enstrophy generation by vortex stretching , is also increased beyond the typical isotropic turbulence range of values .",
    "figure [ fig.sk-der ] shows an example of the spatial distribution of the longitudinal derivative skewness and kurtosis of the velocity component @xmath33 along the inhomogeneous direction @xmath32 , that is , @xmath73 and @xmath74 , in the most intermittent configuration , that is , the one in which the initial integral scale ratio is equal to 2.8 .",
    "the most noticeable feature is that the negative value of the longitudinal derivative skewness , whose magnitude is linked to the spectral energy transfer towards small scales , reaches a magnitude above 0.5 , that is , a value which would only be present in isotropic turbulence at much higher reynolds numbers @xcite .",
    "this occurs together with the increase in intermittency that is visible in the kurtosis distribution .",
    "the longitudinal derivative moments in the directions normal to the interaction layer are also modified .",
    "it should be noted that these directions are directions along which the field remains homogeneous .",
    "if we look at @xmath75 and @xmath76 ( directions @xmath9 and @xmath10 are statistically equivalent ) , both the skewness and kurtosis show a moderate departure from the values of the neighbouring isotropic regions .",
    "we can observe a moderate reduction in the magnitude of the skewness and an increase in the kurtosis ( figure [ fig.sk-der ] ) .",
    "such variations of skewness and the derivative are not constant , as could be expected , because the large - scale features that generate the layer are time evolving .",
    "their extreme values are an indication of the departure of the small scale turbulence from the isotropic state , which is observable even in this very mild instance of nonhomogeneity .",
    "figures [ fig.peaks-der](a-c ) shows the time evolution of these peaks after the fluctuations in the statistics distributions visible in [ fig.sk-der ] have been filtered out .",
    "it is evident that , in all the configurations , the variation in the derivative skewness in the inhomogeneous ( @xmath32 ) and homogeneous @xmath77 ) directions has an opposite sign : the modulus of @xmath78 increases , while the modulus of @xmath79 decreases .",
    "the ratio between these two skewness factors increases with time and with the imposed initial scale ratio . for instance",
    ", it can be observed that , within about a lapse of about 6 - 7 timescales , the ratio between the thickness of the longitudinal derivative in the inhomogeneous direction and those in the normal directions ( directions along which the field remains homogeneous ) increases from 1 to 1.35 , when the scale ratio is close to 2 , and to 1.64 , when the scale ratio is close to 3 ( see figure [ fig.peaks-der](b ) ) .",
    "this differentiation of the behaviour of the longitudinal derivative , in the energy gradient direction and in the directions normal to it , is qualitatively the same as in the case of the interaction of two isotropic turbulent flows with an imposed energy gradient @xcite , and seems to be a general feature of an interaction layer in the absence of shear . at the same time",
    ", the kurtosis levels also differentiate , but even through the inhomogeneous direction shows a slightly higher level of intermittency , the difference is much less marked and never exceeds 30% .",
    "it can be noted that the maximum kurtosis variation is about 25% of the isotropic value , while the maximum skewness is about 50% of its isotropic value .",
    "the interaction between the two decaying isotropic turbulent flows has a greater impact on the third moment than on the fourth order moment .",
    "we can conclude that the anisotropy exists at small scales as well as at large scales in the interaction layer between these two flows ; the large - scale anisotropy introduced by the initial conditions gradually spreads to the small scales .",
    "however , this kind of anisotropy is different from the kind that can be observed in shear flows , see for example @xcite . here",
    ", the main effect is the differentiation of the behaviour of the transverse derivative skewness compared to the longitudinal skewness in the direction of the mean shear ( it should be pointed out that those in the normal directions were not been discussed in the previously cited papers ) . here",
    ", on the contrary , the transport has a negligible effect on the transverse derivative moments , which always remain close to their isotropic values .",
    "the conclusion that the postulate of local isotropy is untenable ( pli ) , both at dissipation and inertial scales , was also reached in @xcite .",
    "this is because the odd order moments of the increments of @xmath80 are nonzero , exhibiting scaling ranges , and the skewness structure function has a value @xmath81 , indicating that in the inertial subrange significant anisotropy is evident even at the third - moment level .",
    "moreover , the fifth - order and seventh - order inertial subrange skewness structure functions are of the order of 10 and 100 , respectively , at least to @xmath82 .",
    "the approach is usually therefore to check the pli at various moments with an increase in the control parameter , @xmath83 . in the present work , we approach the pli question from a different perspective .",
    "we consider the effect of milder and milder nonhomogeneity on turbulence anisotropy . for third - order and fourth - order order velocity and velocity derivative moments , we always observe that a substantial degree of anisotropy can be measured .",
    "as a synthesis for the anisotropy structure for the small scales , one can consider the best fitting relations in figure 7_e _ that link the maxima of the kurtosis and skewness of the velocity derivatives across and along the self - interaction region ( note the opposite slopes ) .",
    "in conclusion , the numerical experiment that we have performed shows three main results .",
    "first , nonlinear interaction is a powerful process that is able to transform a slight inhomogeneity in the correlation length into a kinetic energy step .",
    "the interaction can be considered as a long - range one because , initially , the two isotropic fields are separated by a matching distance which is of the order of the largest integral scale .",
    "second , the interaction builds a sublayer of high intermittency .",
    "in fact , the layer which is produced at the interface between the two initial fields is preceded by this sublayer , which involves not only large scales , but also small scales , and , in particular , their anisotropy .",
    "third , the structure of the anisotropy , in this flow configuration , is rather particular .",
    "it is easy to observe third - order and fourth - order one - point statistical moments , for either the velocity or velocity derivatives statistics , which follow the structure of the initial condition .",
    "the longitudinal derivative skewness gradually departs from the values that can be expected in an isotropic situation .",
    "an appreciable differentiation can also be observed between the different directions : the skewness in the direction crossing the interaction layer ( the direction of inhomogeneity , @xmath32 ) increases in magnitude , while it decreases in the direction parallel to the layer .",
    "for the kurtosis , the peak value across the layer is higher for the longitudinal derivative along the inhomogeneous direction .",
    "it should be noted that the anisotropy described here is different from that of most anisotropic turbulent flows investigated , that is , homogeneous sheared turbulence . in those flows the mean shear creates anisotropy at both large and small scales , which is visible on the generation of large odd transverse moments of the velocity derivative .",
    "however , shear has little impact on longitudinal derivatives . in the present situation ,",
    "the mean velocity is uniform and thus there is no production of turbulent kinetic energy .",
    "departure from local isotropy can be indicated by remarkable difference between the values taken by the longitudinal derivative moments in the directions normal and parallel to the shearfree mixing .",
    "finally , in this work we have obtained quantitative data on the lifetime and formation timescale of the transients , maximum energy gradient and interaction layer width as a function of the correlation length ratio .",
