    "coronal bright fronts ( cbfs ; commonly called `` eit waves '' ) in extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) observations of the low solar corona were first noted by @xcite and characterised by @xcite .",

    "cbfs are usually observed as diffuse bright fronts propagating isotropically when unimpeded at typical velocities of 200400  km  s@xmath1 across the solar disk @xcite .",
    "they are best observed using the 195    passband , at a temperature of 12  mk and height of @xmath07090  mm above the photosphere @xcite .",
    "however , they have also been observed in other passbands , including 171    @xcite , 284    @xcite , 304    @xcite and the 94 , 131 , 211 , and 335    passbands monitored by the atmospheric imaging assembly ( aia ) onboard _ sdo _ @xcite .    despite more than 15 years of study using observations from ground - based @xcite and space - based @xcite instruments ,",
    "cbfs remain an enigma with many competing theories attempting to explain this phenomenon .",
    "they have been alternatively interpreted as magnetohydrodynamic waves @xcite , solitons @xcite and in terms of magnetic field restructuring during the eruption of an associated cme @xcite . for a detailed description of cbfs ,",
    "see the recent reviews by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "traditional analysis of cbfs has produced kinematics that are inconsistent with mhd wave theory , implying a pseudo - wave interpretation .",
    "however , recent observations of decelerating cbfs combined with the effects of low observing cadence @xcite suggest that this may not be the case .",
    "there have also been indications of cbf dispersion with propagation @xcite , although this has been difficult to quantify .",

    ", the semi - automated cbf algorithm outlined by @xcite is applied to _",
    "sdo _ and _ stereo _ observations of the 2010  august  14 cbf and used to determine its physical characteristics .",
    "the 2010  august  14 cbf event erupted from noaa active region ( ar ) 11093 , with an associated coronal mass ejection ( cme ) and goes c4.4 flare which started at 09:38  ut . the ar location ( n11w65 ) meant that the on - disk cbf evolution was visible from _ stereo_-a and _ sdo _ but not _",

    "stereo_/euvi - a had an observing cadence of 300  s and 600  s in the 195    and 304    passbands respectively , with the 171    and 284    passbands both taking synoptic data ( i.e. ,  one image every two hours ) .",
    "_ sdo_/aia was taking observations with 12  s cadence in all seven euv passbands ( 94 , 131 , 171 , 193 , 211 , 304 , and 335   ) over the same time period .",
    "the event is shown in the accompanying movies , with windowed running difference ( rd ) movies used for the 193 ( @xmath10 ; movie_1.mov ) and 304    ( @xmath11 ; movie_2.mov ) passbands from _ sdo _ due to the very small relative intensity change between consecutive images .",
    "a normal rd movie was used to show the _ stereo _ 195    passbands ( @xmath12 ; movie_3.mov ) .    the semi - automated detection algorithm used to identify and track the cbf in both euvi and aia data works in several steps",
    "( see * ? ? ? * for more details ) .",
    "the cbf source location was first defined using the mean centre of ellipses fitted to the first three observations of the cbf in both 193    ( aia ) and 195    ( euvi ) data , giving a source unique to both spacecraft ( although both sources are comparable when transformed between spacecraft ) .",
    "percentage base difference ( pbd ) images @xcite were used for this analysis , with each image de - rotated to the same time ( 09:20:30  ut ) to compensate for solar rotation and a pre - event time @xmath009:25:00  ut used to define the base image in each passband ( see figure  [ fig : image_panel ] ) .",
    "an arc sector was then positioned to allow comparison of both aia and euvi observations .",
    "the pbd intensity of a given image was averaged across the position angle of the arc sector in annuli of increasing radii and 0.5@xmath13 width on the spherical surface , with the standard deviation giving the associated error .",
    "the resulting intensity profile was fitted using a gaussian function , with the centroid and full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) giving the pulse position and width respectively .",
    "each parameter has an associated error , quantifying the ability of the algorithm to detect the pulse . although the source point position and orientation of the arc sector is determined by the user ,",
    "the actual pulse detection is automated , allowing unbiased identification of the cbf .",
    "once the intensity profiles for each image have been processed and fitted , the cbf is identified as a moving pulse , with any stationary bright features ignored .",
    "pulse identification was found to be strongly influenced by passband rather than instrument , with the pulse observed in the 195    and 304    passbands from _ stereo_/euvi ( although only the 195    data was used here due to the low 304    cadence ) . in _",
    "sdo_/aia , the pulse was tracked in four of seven passbands ( 193 , 211 , 304 , and 335   ) with the nature of the 94    and 131    passbands making identification difficult .",
    "although a slight intensity decrease was visually identified in the 171    passband , this could not be tracked using the algorithm .",
    "the pulse kinematics were determined by measuring the temporal variation in pulse centroid distance from the source point . the bootstrapping technique discussed by @xcite",
    "was then used to fit a model of the form , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the initial distance of the pulse from the source point , @xmath16 is the initial velocity and @xmath17 is the constant acceleration .",
    "the kinematics of the individual _ sdo _ passbands are shown in the top - left panel of figure  [ fig : kinematics ] to be comparable , although they do tend to separate with propagation .",
    "similarly , the _ sdo _ 193    and _ stereo _ 195    measurements ( top - right panel of figure  [ fig : kinematics ] ) appear homologous , with a slight positional offset due to the different spacecraft positions .",
    "the kinematics given in table  [ tbl : kinematics ] show a lower initial velocity and much weaker acceleration in the 195    passband relative to the comparable 193    passband .",
    "the kinematic estimates from _ stereo _ 195    are consistent with previous results derived using _",
    "soho_/eit and _ stereo_/euvi , while the higher initial velocity and acceleration from _ sdo _ 193    for the same event suggests a strong influence from the cadence of the observing instrument ( cf .",
    "the larger uncertainties associated with the kinematics analysis of the 304    passband may be explained by the nature of the passband and also by a data gap , which complicated detection of the pulse .",
    "the temporal variation in fwhm was examined for evidence of pulse broadening .",
    "the bottom - left panel in figure  [ fig : kinematics ] shows that the pulse width changes from @xmath040  mm to @xmath0270  mm over a time period of @xmath0900  s. the data prior to @xmath009:52  ut has been corrected to remove the effects of a stationary bright feature close behind the cbf .",
    "this feature initially exerts a strong influence on the gaussian fit , but was negated by subtracting a constant offset value for each passband from the fwhm measurements . from @xmath009:52",
    "ut onward , the cbf is sufficiently far from this feature that the fit to the data is no longer affected .",
    "the effects of this bright feature can also be seen in the bottom - right panel in figure  [ fig : kinematics ] , which shows the peak % intensity variation with distance .",
    "while the bright feature does initially influence the pulse width and peak intensity variation , a general increase and decrease is apparent for the pulse width and peak intensity respectively .",
    "the dispersion was examined by treating the cbf as a linear superposition of sinusoidal waves within a gaussian envelope , giving the equation , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the wavenumber , @xmath20 is the angular frequency , @xmath21 is the characteristic width and @xmath22 is the pulse group velocity ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "the pulse extends in fourier space from @xmath24 to @xmath25 ( @xmath26 where @xmath27 ) , so that the velocity varies from @xmath28 to @xmath29 across the pulse .",
    "the pulse therefore broadens with propagation , with a spatial extent ( fwhm ) defined as , @xmath30t\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the initial pulse width .",
    "this can be rewritten in terms of the change in group velocity @xmath22 as , @xmath32 as the group velocity @xmath23 , the width of a dispersive pulse at any time @xmath33 is given by , @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the rate of change of the group velocity of the pulse with respect to @xmath36 .",
    "[ eqn : delta_r ] can then be fitted to the fwhm measurements , allowing @xmath35 to be determined for each passband .",
    "the expansion rate and the resulting value of @xmath35 from the bottom - left panel of figure  [ fig : kinematics ] are given in table  [ tbl : kinematics ] for each passband .",
    "the general expansion rate in each case is positive within error , indicating statistically significant pulse broadening .",
    "this implies that cbfs are dispersive pulses , confirming the results of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the kinematics of the cbf could be derived for individual passbands at different peak emission temperatures due to the very high cadence of _ sdo _ ( see table  [ tbl : kinematics ] ) .",
    "a spread is apparent in both the initial velocity and acceleration of the pulse , from @xmath0380 to @xmath0460  km  s@xmath1 and @xmath37 to @xmath38  m  s@xmath3 respectively .",
    "this variation was studied by making a comparison with the peak emission temperatures ( @xmath39 ) of the different aia passbands ( as given in table  [ tbl : kinematics ] and discussed by * ? ? ?",
    "it was found that the cbf kinematics and @xmath39 for each passband are inversely related .",
    "as temperature tends to increase while density and magnetic field strength decrease with height in the quiet sun , this implies that in cooler , more dense plasma the cbf has a higher velocity .",
    "this is characteristic of a compressive pulse and combined with the dispersion and deceleration indicates that the cbf is best described as a magnetohydrodynamic wave pulse .",
    "the randomly structured nature of the quiet corona suggests that any globally - propagating pulse must traverse magnetic field lines , indicating a fast - mode rather than slow - mode cbf interpretation .",
    "the cbf morphology across different passbands shows some discrepancies that invite further investigation , particularly the simultaneous intensity decrease at 171    and increase in the cooler 304    passband .",
    "the 171    emission drop ( visually identified here but not tracked ) has been characterised as evidence of plasma heating from 171    into the 193 , 211 , and 335    passbands @xcite .",
    "this heating implies that the cbf pulse is coronal , an observation consistent with the height measurements made by @xcite and @xcite , but complicated by the increase in 304    emission ( dominated by two chromospheric lines at 303.781 and 303.786   ) .",
    "although there is also a coronal emission line at 303.33   , @xcite have noted that this line does not make a notable contribution to aia quiet sun observations , suggesting that the observed intensity increase must be due to emission .",
    "the formation mechanism of emission has been the subject of detailed investigation ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) due to its complex nature , with results suggesting that it is formed by collisional excitation from thermal electrons in the quiet corona .",
    "the increased temperature gradient caused by passage of a compressive coronal pulse could enhance this effect , producing the observed 304    intensity increase .",
    "the cbf would therefore be coronal , as predicted by the observed drop in 171    intensity .",
    "the passband - dependent kinematics indicate that the pulse morphology is significantly influenced by the plasma through which it propagates . by examining how the plasma affects the kinematics for each passband",
    ", it is possible to directly quantify the characteristics of the quiet coronal plasma . for example , the fast - mode wave speed is defined as , @xmath40 where the alfvn speed and sound speed are @xmath41 and @xmath42 respectively .",
    "here @xmath43 is the magnetic field strength , @xmath44 is the particle density , @xmath45 is the proton mass , @xmath46 is the adiabatic index ( typically @xmath47 ) , @xmath36 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath48 is the peak emission temperature ( @xmath39 ; the values used are given in table  [ tbl : kinematics ] ) .",
    "if the cbf pulse is treated as a fast - mode wave then the final pulse velocity ( i.e. ,  the velocity of the pulse when it can no longer be detected by the algorithm ) must be the fast - mode velocity of the given passband , since the pulse can not propagate below this velocity . these values are given in table  [ tbl : kinematics ] for each _ sdo _ passband studied .    by taking the peak emission temperature of each passband as the temperature , only the magnetic field strength and density are unknown in the above equations .",
    "coronal magnetic field strength estimates typically involve extrapolating photospheric magnetic field measurements into the corona and are not very well constrained ( particularly in the quiet sun ) .",
    "in contrast , coronal densities can be estimated using density sensitive line ratios @xcite and are well - constrained .",
    "the above equations can be rearranged to give , @xmath49 implying that the quiet coronal magnetic field strength may be estimated using the derived cbf kinematics .",
    "the final velocity values given in table  [ tbl : kinematics ] were combined with a range of typical quiet coronal densities ( @xmath026@xmath50  @xmath51 ; see * ? ? ? * for more details ) to produce an estimated quiet coronal magnetic field strength range of @xmath012  g. this is comparable to the value derived by @xcite from detailed _ stereo_/euvi kinematic estimates and _ hinode_/eis density measurements .",
    "the good agreement of the range estimated here with the work of @xcite indicates that our assumptions are correct and cbfs can be used to probe the physical characteristics of the plasma through which they propagate .",
    "comparing euvi and high cadence aia observations of the 2010  august  14 cbf event allowed an examination of the accuracy of previous cbf kinematics estimates , which involved combining distance - time measurements from different passbands due to a paucity of data ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . while this was necessary to derive kinematics from the small data - sets available ,",
    "our results indicate that this approach underestimated the general kinematics of the cbf .",
    "it may have also masked the pulse acceleration and did not detail the effect of the plasma on the pulse .",
    "the presence of deceleration in both euvi and aia data ( despite the different cadence and spacecraft positions ) , also suggests that it is characteristic of the phenomenon .",
    "the clear dispersion apparent in both euvi and aia data confirms the observations of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these repeated measurements of significant pulse broadening strongly indicate that cbfs have a dispersive nature which , allied to the traditional point - and - click techniques for identifying them , may have contributed to the uncertainty surrounding their acceleration .",
    "when both the dispersion and deceleration are considered , cbfs may be best described using a wave interpretation .",
    "although this behavior is not predicted by ideal mhd wave theory , it is consistent with the results of @xcite and @xcite , and the randomly structured nature of the corona .",
    "the dispersion relation of the pulse was determined by treating it as a linear superposition of sinusoidal waves within a gaussian envelope , allowing an insight into its physical nature .",
    "the cbf pulse was observed to display kinematics that were dependent on the passband studied ; a unique result that supports the wave interpretation of cbfs . in particular , the pulse exhibited a compressive nature , appearing to propagate at a higher velocity with stronger deceleration in cooler , denser plasma .",
    "this is the first observation of this property of cbfs , and is a result of the very high cadence capabilities of _ sdo_/aia .",
    "this kinematic variation also provides a simple diagnostic of the emitting plasma in each passband , allowing coronal seismology to be used to determine the physical parameters of the corona directly .",
    "even though cbf propagation has previously been proposed as a way of directly probing the structure of the solar corona , this has been complicated by their uncertain physical nature .",
    "the results presented here , in addition to recent work by @xcite and @xcite indicate that cbfs are fast - mode mhd waves , allowing them to be used to examine the environment through which they propagate .",
    "alternative techniques can be used to determine typical densities and the temperature of the different passbands , allowing the magnetic field strength to be estimated using the cbf .",
    "the range of values derived here ( @xmath012  g ) are comparable to those estimated by @xcite ( and typically assumed for the quiet corona , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , indicating that cbfs can be used to directly probe the plasma through which they propagate .    these results are most compatible with the wave interpretation of a cbf pulse .",
    "the observed dispersion implies that cbfs are not accurately described by the soliton model proposed by @xcite , while the cbf height range ( on - disk near the limb over an extended time period in both _ sdo _ and _ stereo _ observations ) is inconsistent with the progressively higher emission predicted by @xcite .",
    "the multi - temperature emission does not match the low foot - point signature predicted by @xcite and there was no indication of the additional coronal moreton wave predicted by @xcite .",
    "although the initial driver is uncertain , the cbf could be a product of the rapid over - expansion of the erupting cme bubble ( cf .",
    "* ) before decoupling and propagating freely .",
    "the high cadence observations available from _ sdo _ will allow this issue to be resolved .",
