    "the investigation of rotating gases or liquids is a central issue in the theory of superfluidity since they give rise to quantized vortices @xcite . during recent years",
    ", several experiments using rotating atomic bose einstein condensates have led to the observation of vortices .",
    "these condensates are usually confined in a harmonic potential with cylindrical symmetry around the rotation axis @xmath2 .",
    "two limiting regimes occur depending on the ratio of the rotation frequency @xmath0 and the trap frequency @xmath1 in the @xmath3 plane .",
    "when @xmath0 is notably smaller than @xmath1 , only one or a few vortices are present at equilibrium @xcite .",
    "a thomas fermi analysis can be performed to analyze this regime because the coupling constant describing the interactions is often large in the experiments @xcite .",
    "when @xmath0 approaches @xmath1 , since the centrifugal force nearly balances the trapping force , the radius of the rotating gas increases , and the vortices arrange themselves on a triangular lattice @xcite .",
    "a new class of phenomena in this regime of fast rotation is predicted in relation with quantum hall physics @xcite .",
    "indeed the one - body hamiltonian written in the rotating frame is similar to that of a charged particle in a uniform magnetic field and one can use the landau levels structure to analyze the ground state of the condensate and describe the properties of the lattice .    in order to analyze the regime of fast rotation ,",
    "one approach consists in adding a quartic potential to the harmonic potential . for this type of potential ,",
    "the trapping force is always greater than the centrifugal force so that the regime @xmath4 can be explored .",
    "the condensate is then seen to exhibit a more complex structure with regards to its density distribution and the arrangement of vortices @xcite .",
    "in particular , a multiply quantized vortex , or giant vortex , appears for large values of the rotational frequency @xmath0 and the condensate is located within a thin annulus @xcite .",
    "when @xmath0 is decreased from this situation , a circle of vortices exists inside the condensate @xcite .",
    "a number of experiments have been performed in which a laser beam is shone into an otherwise harmonically trapped condensate @xcite , thus creating a trapping potential of the form harmonic plus gaussian .",
    "often in experiments , the laser beam is weak , hence the gaussian term is small and for the purpose of analysis can be expanded so that the resulting potential can be approximated by a harmonic plus quartic potential .",
    "a different approach to analyze these experiments is to consider the full harmonic plus gaussian trapping potential .",
    "the aim of this paper is to perform a numerical and analytical study of a rotating condensate placed in a harmonic plus gaussian trap as in the experiment @xcite .",
    "the specific feature of the gaussian potential with respect to the quartic one is that the rotation frequency @xmath0 can not get arbitrarily large but stays below @xmath1 , the trapping frequency of the harmonic potential .",
    "we will show that according to the parameters of the system , the condensate can either be a disk or an annulus .",
    "furthermore we will show that as @xmath0 approaches @xmath1 , the condensate always expands to become a large annulus with a vortex lattice inside the condensate and a large circulation within the central hole .",
    "this is in contrast to the harmonic plus quartic trap , which develops a giant vortex and a thin annulus .",
    "using the lowest landau level ( lll ) states , we will give an analytical description of the phenomena seen numerically .",
    "we estimate the radii @xmath5 , @xmath6 of the condensate and the circulation around the inside hole , of order @xmath7 , thus much bigger than that given by a uniform lattice ( which would be @xmath8 ) .",

    "finally , section v is devoted to extra computations in the thomas - fermi regime .",
    "a two - dimensional bose - einstein condensate trapped at absolute zero temperature can be described by a macroscopic condensate wave function ( order parameter ) @xmath9 .",

    "the energy functional , in the frame rotating with angular velocity @xmath0 is then @xmath13 and where the integral is carried out over the spatial domain @xmath14 .",
    "the trapping potential is composed of a harmonic plus gaussian term @xmath15 when the atoms are assumed to occupy the ground state of the harmonic oscillator in the @xmath2 direction , with energy @xmath16 and extension @xmath17 , suppression of the condensate in the @xmath2 direction is allowed provided the characteristic energy @xmath18 is very large in comparison with the other energy scales .",
