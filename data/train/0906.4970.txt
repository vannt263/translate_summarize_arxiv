    "our understanding of the highest - energy cosmic rays , studied in detail with the pierre auger observatory @xcite , is still rather limited .",
    "one of the reasons is that their event rates are extremely low  less than one particle per km@xmath1 and century at the highest energies .",
    "the pierre auger observatory , currently comprising the southern site in argentina , observes these highest energy cosmic rays with a combination of surface particle detectors ( sd ) and fluorescence telescopes ( fd ) .",
    "this `` hybrid '' mode of observation provides a wealth of information on each single measured cosmic ray event and is the key for the successful interpretation of the measured cosmic ray data .",
    "it is , however , limited to a duty cycle of @xmath2% by the fluorescence technique , which can only be applied during clear , moonless nights .",
    "a long - forgotten detection technique based on the measurement of pulsed radio emission emanating from cosmic ray air showers has great potential to complement the existing techniques of particle and air fluorescence detection .",
    "radio detection of cosmic ray air showers was originally discovered in the 1960s @xcite , but was nearly forgotten after the 1970s and only revived with great success in the last few years .",
    "radio pulses with a length of a few tens of nanoseconds are emitted by relativistic secondary electrons and positrons in the air shower cascade which ensues the interaction of high - energy cosmic rays with atmospheric nuclei .",
    "the acceleration of these electrons and positrons in the earth s magnetic field is by now known to contribute the dominant fraction of the radio emission .",
    "this geomagnetic effect has been modeled with a number of approaches ( for a review see @xcite ) , most prominently the geosynchrotron model @xcite and the macroscopic transverse current model @xcite .",
    "one of the main advantages of the technique is that radio detection of cosmic ray air showers can be carried out with nearly 100% duty cycle  allowing hybrid observations of radio and surface particle detectors with statistics larger by nearly a factor of ten as compared to hybrid measurements of particle and air fluorescence detectors .    in recent years",
    ", radio detection has matured and shown promising results achieved by the codalema @xcite and lopes @xcite experiments .",
    "we now know ( see @xcite and references therein ) that the radio signal field strength increases linearly with the energy of the primary particle in the frequency regime of coherent emission ( below @xmath0100  mhz ) , falls off approximately exponentially with lateral distance from the shower axis and correlates strongly with the angle between shower axis and geomagnetic field",
    ". due to the relatively small area of these first - generation experiments , covering less than 0.5  km@xmath1 each , radio emission of cosmic rays has only been studied up to energies of below 10@xmath3  ev .",
    "the true potential of the radio technique , however , lies in its large scale application for the measurement of ultra - high energy cosmic rays .",
    "the combination of almost 100@xmath4 duty cycle , calorimetric measurement of the air shower energy @xcite and sensitivity on the depth of the air shower maximum ( and thus mass of the primary cosmic ray ) @xcite makes it an ideal complement for the auger surface particle detectors .",
    "in addition , radio detection can provide a very high angular resolution , and is believed to be cost - effective for instrumentation of large areas .",
    "the potential of the radio detection technique for application on large scales is being evaluated in the framework of the pierre auger observatory .",
    "this allows direct comparisons of radio measurements with high - quality measurements of the sd and fd detectors , which are extremely helpful in the research and development phase .",
    "in addition , the argentinian pampa provides a very good environment for radio detection , as the radio - noise levels are very low .",
    "a number of technological challenges have to be solved for the application of radio detection on large scales . a large array , in contrast to the smaller first - generation experiments , needs in particular :    * autonomous , self - powered detector stations * communication between stations through wireless data links * ability to self - trigger on the radio signal * stations withstanding roaming animals and strong winds * long - term operational stability with minimal maintenance    in a first phase of research and development , a number of concepts for detector stations have been studied with small prototype installations of a handful of antennas each . with installations near the auger balloon launching station ( bls , see fig .

    "a cabled installation near the bls has taken radio data trigger externally by a pair of scintillators @xcite . over a year of operation , @xmath5 events have been coincidently detected in all three radio antennas , for which a direction reconstruction confirms that they correspond to events seen by the auger surface particle detectors at the same time and from the same arrival direction ( see fig .",
    "[ angulardistance ] ) .",
    "in addition , a full radio event and radio detector simulation has been carried out , confirming that the field strengths measured are compatible with those expected within the relatively large uncertainties @xcite .",
    "it has also been demonstrated that the radio detector system is sensitive to galactic noise and in fact sees the passage of the galactic centre ( cf .",

    "based on the promising results of the initial prototype installations , the pierre auger collaboration has decided to set up a larger scale auger engineering radio array ( aera ) @xcite . in its final form , aera will cover an area of @xmath7  km@xmath1 with approximately 150 detector stations , and will detect about 5000 cosmic ray radio events per year .",
