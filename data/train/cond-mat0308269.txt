    "we summarize the numerical results for the extracted xc energy densities . because of the high contribution of self - interaction in the two - electron system",
    "only the four - electron @xmath159-qhd can be used for the derivation of vorticity - dependent xc energy densities . after solving the deq ( [ deq ] ) for different confinement energies @xmath54 we get a set of @xmath196 for different @xmath2 , @xmath72 , and @xmath197 ( no polarization ) .",

    "[ xc_energy ] as a function of @xmath2 together with the pure tc@xcite parameterization , tc combined with lwm@xcite , and tc combined with fo@xcite .",
    "whereas the lwm and fo parameterizations do not deviate very much from the pure tc data which does not consider any current - induced effects , the extracted xc energy densities exhibit a pronounced dependence on the vorticity .",
    "in particular , the curve of extracted @xmath198 starts for small @xmath2 below the reference curves , crosses it and finally lies above it .",
    "moreover , the crossing wanders to larger @xmath2 if we decrease the vorticity ( see fig .",
    "[ xc_energy](a)-(f ) ) .",
    "although the interpretation of these large deviations from the standard parameterizations is difficult as the data set is very small our results give rise to the question if the vorticity dependence of xc energy densities can be treated in the frame of lvsda .",
    "there might be also non - local effects from paramagnetic currents which can not be considered in this approach .",
    "however , in any case it is necessary to reexamine the vorticity - dependence of @xmath196 with focus on landau level mixing and arbitrary densities .",
    "in this paper we presented a new approach to study scalar xc potentials and xc vector potentials of current - carrying ground states in axially symmetric , parabolic quantum dots .",
    "starting from exact ground states densities and paramagnetic current densities we analytically calculated the xc potentials of the two - electron @xmath107-droplet and the four - electron @xmath159-droplet and studied them as a function of the strength of the confinement potential . in both systems",
    "the xc vector potentials are of the same order of magnitude which shows the importance of this current - induced effect even for higher filling factors .",
    "this result is not taken into account in the interpolation introduced by rasolt and perrot@xcite .",
    "the second step involved the extraction of vorticity - dependent xc energy densities .",
    "the effect of the vorticity is far more pronounced than predicted by rasolt and perrot@xcite , levesque , weis , and macdonald@xcite and fano and ortolani@xcite .",
    "a possible reason for this behavior is the assumption that the influence of current densities is only relevant for strong magnetic fields when the local filling factor @xmath5 is less than one .",
    "this is the restriction which enters the derivations of the parameterizations in literature .",
    "however , our results point out that a new approach to current- or vorticity - dependent xc energy densities is required which also comprise the effects of landau level mixing .",
