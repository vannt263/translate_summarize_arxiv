    "this paper concerns the @xmath0 semiclassical schrdinger operator @xmath2 where the potential @xmath3 ( which is always assumed to be independent of @xmath4 ) satisfies : @xmath5 for any @xmath6 , the spectrum of @xmath7 on @xmath8 is discrete and simple , and we write it as @xmath9 each @xmath10 depends on @xmath4 , but we do not include this in the notation .",
    "we denote by @xmath11 the corresponding eigenfunctions ( which also depend on @xmath4 ) , so that @xmath12 our main result , which was conjectured by colin de verdire in @xcite , is :    [ theorem ] there exists a pair of potentials @xmath13 with @xmath14 such that the operators @xmath15 satisfy@xmath16 up to @xmath1 \" ( so in particular they have the same semiclassical trace invariants ) and such that the ground state eigenvalues @xmath17 and @xmath18 are different for all @xmath6 except possibly for a sequence @xmath19 .    here by `` @xmath16 up to @xmath1 '' we mean that for every @xmath20 and @xmath21 there exists a constant @xmath22 such that @xmath23 the inverse spectral problem for @xmath0 semiclassical schrdinger operators asks whether @xmath24 determines @xmath3 uniquely up to a translation @xmath25 or reflection @xmath26 .",
    "the main tools in studying inverse spectral problems are trace invariants such as heat , wave or schrdinger trace invariants .",
    "we recommend the surveys @xcite by zelditch , and @xcite by datchev and the second author for applications of different kinds of trace formulas in inverse spectral results .",
    "however the theorem above shows the limitations of semiclassical trace invariants meaning that two schrdinger operators can have the same semiclassical invariants but have different spectra .     and @xmath27 with @xmath28 , but @xmath29 .",
    ", width=453 ]    an analogous result in the case of bounded plane domains was proved by fulling and kuchment in @xcite where they find two bounded plane domains ( called penrose - lifshits mushrooms ) for which all the wave trace invariants agree but the ground state eigenvalues disagree .",
    "a penrose - lifshits domain @xmath30 is a semi - ellipse with asymmetrical bumps @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath22 attached to its boundary as in figure [ mushrooms ] . if one detaches the bump @xmath22 , reflects it about the axis of the ellipse and reattaches it , one gets a non - congruent domain @xmath27 which has the same heat and wave trace invariants as @xmath30 , i.e. is indistinguishable from @xmath30 by standard inverse spectral techniques . in @xcite , fulling and kuchment",
    "prove zelditch s conjecture ( see @xcite ) that these domains are not isospectral . in @xcite , colin",
    "de verdire constructs an analogue of the penrose - lifshits example for the @xmath0 semiclassical schrdinger operator ( see figure [ penrosepotentials ] ) .",
    "namely he attaches two small bump functions to the harmonic oscillator potential @xmath33 . by detaching one of these functions , reflecting it about the @xmath34-axis and then reattaching it , he is able to construct two non - isomorphic potentials that are isospectral modulo @xmath35 .",
    "our goal in this paper is to prove a fulling - kuchment theorem for this example and verify colin de verdir s conjecture that these `` isospectral modulo @xmath35 '' potentials are not isospectral .     up to @xmath1 but @xmath36,width=453 ]    to our knowledge",
    "there are no counterexamples to spectral uniqueness of smooth semiclassical schrdinger operators .",
    "there are in fact many recent positive results in this area which use trace invariants but make strong assumptions of analyticity or symmetry on the potential . in @xcite , the first author and uribe",
    "show that any real analytic potential @xmath3 on @xmath37 , symmetric with respect to all coordinate axes and with a unique global minimum , is determined within the class of all such potentials by the spectrum at the bottom of the well of its semiclassical schrdinger operator . in @xcite , the second author and in @xcite , colin de verdire and the first author remove the symmetry assumption in dimension @xmath38 , but keep the assumption of analyticity ( see also @xcite for the higher dimensional case ) . in @xcite ,",
    "colin de verdire removes both the symmetry and analyticity assumptions in the one dimensional case , but adds a genericity assumption and uses all eigenvalues instead of only the low lying ones . in @xcite ,",
    "the first author and wang give a new proof of colin de verdire s result with slightly different generic conditions . in @xcite ,",
    "datchev , ventura and the second author show that radially symmetric potentials in @xmath37 are spectrally determined among all smooth potentials .",
    "we close the introduction by listing some remarks and related problems :    * our method can not eliminate the possibility of the existence of a sequence @xmath19 where the ground state eigenvalues agree .",
    "we believe that such a sequence does not exist and we actually expect a much stronger statement to hold : @xmath39 * we can also ask the same question for semiclassical resonances .",
    "can we find two smooth compactly supported potentials @xmath40 and @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 have different resonances but where the resonances agree up to @xmath1 ? * it would be interesting to study the analogous problem in the case of compact riemannian manifolds . to be more precise , can one find a pair of riemannian manifolds @xmath44 and @xmath45 where @xmath46 but all the wave trace invariants are the same , that is to say @xmath47 ?",
    "we are grateful to daniel stroock for bringing to our attention a reference for the kato - rellich theorem .",
    "we are also thankful to kiril datchev for his useful comments on the earlier version of the paper .",
    "the second author would also like to ramis movassagh for helping us to find a graph of the weber function using _",
    "we will show the existence of the potentials @xmath48 in theorem [ theorem ] by choosing suitable perturbations of the harmonic oscillator @xmath33 .",
    "suppose @xmath49 such that supp@xmath50 and supp@xmath51 and they are not identically zero .",
    "we put @xmath52 @xmath53 we denote by @xmath54 the ground state eigenvalue of @xmath55 .",
    "we will show that there exist @xmath56 and @xmath57 small enough such that the pair @xmath58 has the properties asserted in the theorem . from the beginning",
    "we assume that @xmath59 and @xmath60 are small enough that @xmath58 do not have any critical points beside @xmath61 .",
    "we first show that `` @xmath16 up to @xmath1 '' in the sense of .",
    "this is claimed and proved in @xcite using the method of `` bohr - sommerfeld quantization conditions to all orders '' .",
    "it can also be proved using quantum birkhoff normal forms and their equivalence with trace invariants as in @xcite . in that paper",
    "the first author and wang consider the spectral density measure @xmath62 defined by @xmath63 and they show that it satisfies an asymptotic expansion of the form : @xmath64 where @xmath65 are called _ semiclassical trace invariants_. they show that these invariants are of the form : @xmath66 where @xmath67 are universal polynomials .",
    "they also give an algorithm to compute @xmath65 .",
    "then they show that @xmath62 determines the global birkhoff normal form ( whose existence they also prove in this setting ) of @xmath68 up to @xmath1 and thus determines the eigenvalues up to @xmath1 .",
    "however for our potentials @xmath40 and @xmath41 , the trace invariants @xmath65 in are identical and hence their @xmath62 are the same up to @xmath1 which proves the claim .    to show that the ground state eigenvalues @xmath69 and @xmath70 are different we use hadamard s variational formula ( lemma [ hadamard ] below ) which implies that @xmath71 where @xmath72 is an @xmath73 normalized eigenfunction of @xmath74 with the ground state eigenvalue @xmath75 . then in lemma [ nonevenness ] we show that for @xmath76 and @xmath60 small enough @xmath77 is not an even function in @xmath78 .",
    "thus by ( [ hdm ] ) we can find a @xmath79 such that : @xmath80 this implies that for @xmath59 small enough ( and @xmath60 small enough ) we have : @xmath81 finally by the kato - rellich theorem ( see @xcite theorem xii.8 . ) the eigenvalues @xmath82 are analytic functions of @xmath4 for all @xmath83 , therefore @xmath84 for all @xmath6 , except possibly for a sequence @xmath19 .",
    "this finishes the proof of the theorem .",
    "it now remains only to prove lemmas [ hadamard ] and [ nonevenness ] below . before doing this",
    "we makes some remarks regarding the proof above .",
    "we note that the kato - rellich theorem is very important in our proof .",
    "we could not follow our argument with a variable @xmath4 because @xmath59 would depend on @xmath4 .",
    "we choose and fix an @xmath59 for @xmath76 and then use the analyticity in @xmath4 to argue that , except for a sequence @xmath19 , for all @xmath6 we have @xmath84 .",
    "[ gs ] we also point out that the eigenvalues @xmath85 are not analytic at @xmath86 .",
    "we can see this using the theory of quantum birkhoff normal forms at the bottom of the well of a potential which was developed by sjstrand in @xcite .",
    "since @xmath87 and @xmath33 have the same taylor coefficients at @xmath61 , the bottom of of their wells , they have the same qbnfs at @xmath88 and therefore the low lying eigenvalues ( in particular the ground states ) of their schrdinger operators @xmath55 and @xmath89 must have the same asymptotic expansion of the form @xmath90 as @xmath91 . however the ground state eigenvalue of @xmath92 is @xmath4 hence if @xmath85 was analytic at @xmath86 then we would have @xmath93 .",
    "but this is not the case if for example we choose @xmath94 and @xmath79 nonnegative and not identically zero .",
    "in fact under this assumption we have @xmath95 . to see this we recall that @xmath96 where @xmath97 and by assumption @xmath98 .",
    "let @xmath99 be an @xmath73 normalized ground state eigenfunction of @xmath100 .",
    "then in ( [ groundstate ] ) the minimum is attained by @xmath99 and @xmath101 the first term is greater than or equal to @xmath4 with equality only if @xmath99 is a ground state eigenfunction of the harmonic oscillator in which case the second term is not zero .",
    "so @xmath102 .",
    "we now state hadamard s variational formula for schrdinger operators .",
    "it is a formula for the first variation of the eigenvalues of a perturbed operator in terms of the eigenfunctions of the unperturbed operator . since in this case",
    "( unlike for example in the case of bounded domains ) the argument is simple we give its proof .",
    "[ hadamard ] let @xmath103 with @xmath104 .",
    "let @xmath105 .",
    "suppose @xmath106 is the @xmath107-th eigenvalue of @xmath108 and suppose @xmath109 is an @xmath73 normalized eigenfunction of @xmath110 with eigenvalue @xmath111 . then @xmath112    since in dimension one the eigenvalues are simple , for a given @xmath107 we can choose a smooth one parameter family @xmath113 of @xmath73 normalized real eigenfunctions of @xmath108 with eigenvalues @xmath106 .",
    "so by our notation @xmath114 .",
    "we now write @xmath115 because @xmath3 is real valued the operator @xmath110 is symmetric and therefore the last two terms are identical .",
    "in fact each one is zero .",
    "this follows from @xmath116 which in turn follows by applying @xmath117 to the equation @xmath118 .    in the next lemma we put @xmath76 .",
    "[ nonevenness ] let @xmath119 be nonnegative and not identically zero and let @xmath120 .",
    "suppose @xmath72 is a ground state eigenfunction of @xmath121 with the ground state eigenvalue @xmath122 .",
    "then there exists @xmath123 small enough such that @xmath77 is not an even function on @xmath78 .",
    "first of all since away from supp@xmath124 the potential @xmath125 is real analytic , if @xmath77 is even on @xmath126 then by analytic continuation it is even on @xmath127 .",
    "we also note that @xmath128 being even implies @xmath72 is even .",
    "this is because a ground state eigenfunction never vanishes .",
    "therefore @xmath72 can not change sign and in particular can not be odd anywhere .",
    "to prove @xmath72 is not even on @xmath127 we introduce the parabolic cylinder functions below and review some of their basic properties in  [ weberfunction ] .",
    "let @xmath129 be the unique solution to @xmath130 with @xmath131 the function @xmath129 is called a weber function .",
    "an argument using , similar to that in remark [ gs ] , shows that for @xmath60 small enough we have @xmath132 .",
    "in fact we can make @xmath122 arbitrary close to @xmath38 . by the wkb method",
    "we see that @xmath133 either grows or decays exponentially as @xmath134 , but exponential decay is ruled out by the fact that it would make @xmath135 an eigenfunction of the harmonic oscillator with eigenvalue @xmath136 . thus @xmath129 is exponentially decaying near @xmath137 with @xmath138 and exponentially growing ( in absolute value ) near @xmath139 .",
    "in fact we will see in  [ weberfunction ] that @xmath140 , and that @xmath135 has a unique critical point ( which is a global maximum ) at @xmath141 , @xmath142 , and vanishes only once for a large positive value of @xmath143 .",
    "in particular , @xmath144 is positive for @xmath145 and negative for @xmath146 .",
    "see figure [ weberfigure ] for a graph of @xmath135 .",
    "we will prove these claims about @xmath135 in  [ weberfunction ] .",
    "since @xmath99 satisfies the same equation as @xmath135 on @xmath147 , using @xmath148 we have @xmath149 and using @xmath150 we have @xmath151 for a positive constant @xmath152 .",
    "in particular @xmath153 .",
    "we claim that @xmath154 which will show that @xmath99 is not even on @xmath155 , completing the proof of the lemma .    the proof that @xmath154 uses sturm - liouville theory .",
    "let @xmath156 and @xmath157 .",
    "then @xmath158 and @xmath159 we rewrite and as a first order system using the prfer substitution : @xmath160 where we choose the branches of @xmath161 and @xmath162 such that @xmath163 ( this is possible because @xmath164 and @xmath165 , see  [ weberfunction ] ) .",
    "then ( see @xcite section 5 , chapter 10 ) : @xmath166 and by @xmath167 because @xmath168 and because @xmath169 , by applying an elementary comparison theorem to ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 7 , chapter 1 ) ) we get @xmath170 moreover since @xmath129 and @xmath144 are positive on @xmath145 ( see  [ weberfunction ] ) we have @xmath171 for @xmath145 and thus @xmath172 for @xmath173 .",
    "in fact , because @xmath99 never vanishes , @xmath174 is never zero and @xmath175 using this and , by applying an elementary comparison theorem to and because @xmath176 we obtain @xmath177 this is the key point : is an inequality for @xmath99 and @xmath135 in the region where they solve different equations . on the other hand @xmath178 for @xmath179 so @xmath180 and in particular @xmath181 . if @xmath182 then @xmath183 by and therefore @xmath184 .",
    "but @xmath135 has only one critical point which is at @xmath141 .",
    "hence @xmath185 . then by @xmath186 and thus @xmath187 .",
    "this shows that @xmath188 must be positive because if @xmath189 then the point @xmath188 is on the left of the critical point @xmath190 of @xmath135 but @xmath135 is increasing for @xmath145 .",
    "finally @xmath135 is decreasing on @xmath191 and by @xmath99 is increasing on @xmath191 .",
    "so by @xmath192 and therefore @xmath154 .",
    "let @xmath129 be a weber function with small frequency which was defined in .",
    "here we prove the properties of @xmath135 which are needed in the proof of lemma [ nonevenness ] .",
    "that @xmath129 decays exponentially near @xmath137 and grows exponentially near @xmath139 follows from the classical wkb method for odes ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "in fact the exact decay and growth rates ( see @xcite , section 16.5 . ) are given by @xmath193 @xmath194 where @xmath22 is a positive constant which depends on our normalization @xmath195 .",
    "note that for @xmath196 very close to @xmath38 we have @xmath197 which shows that @xmath198 .        to prove the other properties of @xmath135 we first show that @xmath135 is positive on @xmath199 $ ] . to do this we choose @xmath200 nonnegative and consider the operator @xmath201 we represent its ground state eigenvalue by @xmath202 and an associated smooth family of @xmath73 normalized eigenfunctions by @xmath203 .",
    "then by hadamard s variational formula @xmath204 similarly @xmath205 this implies that @xmath202 and @xmath206 are increasing functions in @xmath207 and @xmath60 respectively .",
    "thus because @xmath208 , we can find @xmath207 and @xmath60 positive so that @xmath209 .",
    "this is the value @xmath60 that we choose in lemma [ nonevenness ] . because @xmath210 satisfies the same equation as @xmath135 for @xmath211 we have @xmath212 on @xmath213 $ ] . on the other hand",
    "since @xmath210 is a ground state eigenfunction it does not vanish on @xmath214 so the weber function @xmath135 has no zeros in @xmath213 $ ] and must be positive there .",
    "we can use this fact to show that there is only one critical point which is at the maximum @xmath141 .",
    "first of all in the forbidden region @xmath215 we have @xmath216 and therefore by we have @xmath217 there .",
    "this implies that @xmath218 will increase on @xmath219 and in particular will never vanish .",
    "the maximum @xmath141 must be in the classical region @xmath220 where @xmath221 and @xmath135 have different signs .",
    "there can not be two critical points in the classical region because then by rolle s theorem @xmath221 would vanish in between them , and @xmath135 would vanish there as well by the equation , contradicting @xmath222 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath135 can not have any critical points in the forbidden region @xmath223 .",
    "assume @xmath224 is such a critical point",
    ". then @xmath225 because if it were zero then by @xmath226 which together with would @xmath227 imply that @xmath135 is a trivial solution . if @xmath228 then by @xmath229 and the graph of @xmath135 should stay concave up for all @xmath230 which implies that @xmath231 which is a contradiction . finally if @xmath232 then @xmath233 but because @xmath234 we should have a zero of @xmath135 between @xmath235 and @xmath224 which shows that @xmath236 .",
    "now if @xmath237 is the smallest zero with @xmath238 then @xmath239 .",
