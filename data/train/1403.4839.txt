    "inferring the underlying topology of a complex system from observed data is currently the object of intense research .",
    "however , the limits for the exact inference of direct links in real - world systems composed by interacting dynamical units are still not fully understood .",
    "understanding this limitations is often crucial in many applications in social and natural sciences . in order to infer the underlying network , usually ,",
    "the observed data comes from time - series recorded at the different units .",
    "then , a direct link between units is assumed depending on how interdependent these observations are .",
    "for example , by recording the activity of different brain regions , one wishes to infer which are the relevant structural or functional brain connections by comparing similarity patterns @xcite . in general",
    ", the outcome is a complex network @xcite that interconnects the individual units and allows for a better understanding of the overall system behavior .",
    "the main statistical tools used to determine the interdependence of the units have been the cross - correlation ( cc ) and the mutual information ( mi ) between their dynamical trajectories @xcite . depending on the field of application , the choice of similarity estimators is wider and includes partial correlations , graphical models , and adapted estimators , such as event synchronization @xcite ( recently used to analyze the summer monsoon rainfall over the indian peninsula @xcite ) or response dynamics @xcite . however , any similarity measure used to compare two time - series usually results in a non - zero value @xcite .",
    "a reason for this is that , in finite data sets , the presence of persistent trends and/or deterministic recurrent oscillations results in spurious correlations @xcite",
    ". therefore , network reconstruction methods use fixed link densities ( where only the strongest similarity estimates are retained as links , e.g. in @xcite ) , link weights ( where links are weighted based on the similarity @xcite ) or pairwise significance tests @xcite to ensure the link representativeness .",
    "another reason , which is the focus of our work , is the network connectivity .",
    "in particular , the existence of teleconnections @xcite ( name given in paleoecology to the long - range connections ) in systems with multiple / continuous coupling structures result in high similarity estimates between distant nodes .",
    "moreover , even after detrending a data set , the connectivity of the underlying network topology still plays a major role in the non - zero values of the similarity measures between nodes if the network is connected .",
    "indeed , in undirected connected complex networks , which are the focus of this work , every pair of units is joined by some path .",
    "consequently , any pair of units will exchange some level of correlation or information due to the overall connecting topology . therefore , the ability to detect a _",
    "direct _ link between any two units is hindered within the similarity measured value .",
    "nevertheless , when the links are homogeneous , one expects that directly connected units have larger values of the similarity measure than indirectly connected ones @xcite .",
    "then , the existence of a certain threshold , @xmath0 , that can split the similarity values into two sets can be expected .",
    "if a similarity value between two units is larger than @xmath0 , it is considered to be significant and a consequence of a direct link between the two units .",
    "otherwise , it is less significant and a consequence of the lack of a direct link between the two units . a similar method is used in paleoecology to select good modern analog samples for climate and environmental reconstruction @xcite .",
    "when the strengths of the links are heterogeneous , the weak links are further hindered within the similarity measure values and a bivariate analysis can be insufficient @xcite .",
    "moreover , in the presence of strong coupling , global patterns in the system s behavior emerge , creating an effective topology which makes the underlying network inference process unfeasible",
    ". similarly , inference fails for very weak couplings , where the system is hard to distinguish from being composed of uncoupled units .",
    "we find that avoiding such fully coherent ( large coupling strengths ) or incoherent ( small coupling strengths ) behavior is critical for the detection of the direct links ( as it was also found in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "since different topologies are inferred for different @xmath0 values , the problem of finding the optimal @xmath0 value which recovers the largest portion of the underlying network is far from trivial .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite the presence of dynamical noise in the individual units was shown to enable the identification of an optimal threshold giving an accurate prediction of a network topology , based solely on the measurement of dynamical correlations .",
    "however , the method requires computing the inverse matrix of the dynamical correlation matrix , which can be computationally demanding , and also the influence of non - additive noise and/or observational noise remains an open question .",
    "other methods for link identification are based on perturbing the individual units .",
    "for example , the method proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite requires performing independent , simultaneous , and random phase resettings in all the units , which can be impractical in many real - world systems ( such as in @xcite ) .    in this work",
    ", we show that , when the ordered values of cc ( computed in absolute value , i.e. , the pearson coefficient ) and/or mi ( computed via ordinal pattern analysis @xcite ) exhibit a discontinuous curve , an adequate @xmath0 value permits _ inference of underlying topologies without errors_. the exact link detection is demonstrated by considering various discrete - time dynamical units ( logistic maps , circle maps , tent maps , and novel maps modelling laser arrays referred to as optical maps ) that mutually interact in different coupling topologies , including random networks .",
    "this means that , when the discontinuity is observed , both methods are able to infer the exact underlying network topology that interconnects the units from the local time - series measurements . as a result , the topology of the interacting system is directly related to its function .",
    "we find that the existence of this @xmath0 occurs even when observational noise and heterogeneities ( in the links and/or in the units ) are present .",
    "our results are based on a critical comparison of the cc and mi inference methods _ effectiveness _",
    "( what is the portion of the underlying topology that is reconstructed correctly ) , _ robustness _ ( how the effectiveness is affected when parameters are changed , namely , the heterogeneity in the map s dynamics or network weights , the coupling strength between maps , and the network size or connectivity ) , and _ reliability _ ( results yield consistent inferred networks , even when including observational noise and reducing the time - series lengths ) .",
    "we conclude that mi outperforms cc as the most robust , in particular , is the least sensitive to the choice of @xmath0 value , and reliable measure . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "such reliable reconstruction of network topologies without errors from time - series measurements of discrete - time dynamical units has not been previously obtained .",
    "we consider logistic maps , tent maps , circle maps , and novel maps recently proposed @xcite for representing non - linear optical elements ( in the following , referred to as _ optical maps _ ) .",
    "we observe that our method of network inference is not restricted to maps , but it is demonstrated with maps mainly because of two reasons .",
    "first , maps are computationally cost - efficient , allowing long time - series simulations , performing robust statistical analysis , and have been widely used to study complex networks of coupled units @xcite .",
    "second , continuous systems can be represented by maps ( for example , there are many maps that represent various types of neurons @xcite ) or transformed into maps by means of a poincar section or a stroboscopic sampling ( time - poincar ) . here , we let the units have a degree of heterogeneity by using non - identical parameters . for the underlying topology ,",
    "we use random networks ( rn ) @xcite and small - world networks ( sw ) @xcite with homogeneous and heterogeneous weights .",
    "these networks are characterized by the number of nodes , @xmath1 , the connectivity parameter , @xmath2 , and the weights heterogeneity degree , @xmath3 ( details are provided in the supplemental material @xcite ) .",
