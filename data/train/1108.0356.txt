    "potassium currents across nerve membranes have been longly studied ( see , for instance , @xcite and the reviews  @xcite ) . it is now known that ionic channels selecting potassium currents are present in almost all types of cells in all organisms and that they play many important and different functional roles .",
    "an important improvement in experiments was the appearing of the _ patch clamp _ technique , see for instance  @xcite , which permitted the measurement of the ionic current flowing through a single channel on the cell membrane .",
    "different types of measurements , see for instance @xcite , provide a very detailed description of the behavior of potassium channels .",
    "less is known on their structure  @xcite ; something has been inferred starting from functional behavior and some has been deduced via direct inspection .    despite the large variety of ionic channel types , they all form selective pores in the cell membrane which open and close stochastically and , when in the open state , allow permeation of a selected ionic species ( potassium in k@xmath0channels ) .",
    "gating , i.e. , their ability to open and close , and selectivity , i.e. , their ability to allow the flux of a particular ionic species in the cytoplasm , are not yet completely understood . the way in which gating and selection are achieved can be different from channel to channel  @xcite .    on theoretical grounds",
    "this problem has been approached with a large variety of methods .",
    "molecular dynamics studies @xcite give a very detailed description of the phenomenon and their results can also be compared with structural experimental information , but they are usually not able to provide macroscopic currents estimates due to the too small involved time scale .",
    "a different approach is that of kinetic models @xcite which give very useful information since electro  physiological experiments are performed over time scales much longer than the atomic one .",
    "the drawback is represented by the extreme simplifications on the structure of the channel .",
    "models such as the ones in @xcite describe to some extent the dynamics of ion permeation through the selectivity filter , see also @xcite . in this paper , following @xcite , we introduce a model where the channel is lumped to a two state stochastic point system .",
    "a remarkable feature of our model is the interaction between the dynamics of the ions inside the cell and that of the selectivity filter itself .    in this spirit , in  @xcite a very simplified model for the pore behavior has been proposed .",
    "the main idea is that the pore can be in two states , _ high _ and _ low_affinity . in the former potassium ions",
    "can bind to molecules inside the pore , while smaller sodium ions can not . in the latter ,",
    "on the other hand , no ion can bind to the pore .",
    "we then have that , when the pore is in the low ",
    "affinity state , the two ionic species permeate in the same way . on the contrary ,",
    "when the pore is the high  affinity state , sodium particles are reflected by the pore , while potassium ions bind to it and , eventually , when the pore comes back to the low - affinity state , dissociate and possibly exit the cell .",
    "this selectivity mechanism controls the potassium flux through the cell membrane and , hence , yields gating . in",
    "@xcite it was proven that it is possible to obtain gating via selection , but it was also noted that a pronounced reduction in the potassium flux is observed when the fraction of time the pore spends in the high  affinity state is large ; indeed in this case for long period of times no permeation is allowed .",
    "think for instance of the kcv from chlorella virus pbcv1  @xcite , which have no long cytosolic regions able to close and open in response to membrane voltage .",
    "for this kind of channels it is attractive to think that gating is indeed realized via selection  @xcite ; in other words researchers were led to suppose that different current levels are indeed obtained through the selection mechanism .",
    "the basic motivation of this paper is studying the way in which the ion dynamics in cytosol affects the pore behavior and exploring the possibility to reduce the potassium flux loss due to selection . in our model",
    "we assume that the ionic species diffuse in the cytosol through independent random walks on a two  dimensional lattice and , for the potassium and sodium flux ratio , we find results comparable to those in  @xcite , where the motion of ions in cytosol was assumed to be uniform ( constant velocity ) . as already noted in  @xcite , good selection is obtained when the time fraction spent in the high  affinity state is chosen long enough . in this case",
    ", the potassium flux through the channel is remarkably reduced .",
    "our results suggest that , by modelling the cytosolic dynamics as a diffusive rather than uniform motion , the potassium flux loss is less important .",
    "moreover , we prove that it is possible to compensate this effect just allowing the pore to stuff more than one particle at a time . for realistic concentrations of potassium inside the cell",
    "it is seen that , allowing three ( in rare occurencese four ) potassium ions to be packed in the pore , when it is in the high  affinity state , is enough to compensate the potassium flux reduction due to the selectivity filter .",
    "this hypothesis is compatible with what is known about the structure of potassium channels @xcite .",
    "we also perform an extensive study of the dependence of fluxes on the two main physiological parameters , namely , the fraction of time the pore spends in the high  affinity state and the concentration of the ions in the cell . as it is easy to guess the sodium flux is directly proportional to the ionic density in the cell . for potassium ions , on the other hand ,",
    "this linear behavior is found only for small values of the time fraction spent in the high  affinity state ( in this case the two ionic species behave similarly ) , while for large values of such a time fraction a sub  linear behavior is found .",
    "we studied the behavior of fluxes as a function of the time fraction spent in the low ",
    "affinity state at fixed ionic concentration ; we found a sub  linear increasing behavior both for sodium and potassium .",
    "since the pore is modeled in a very simple way ( a two state random variable independent by the random walk dynamics inside the cell ) , it is possible to study analytically the model .",
    "we perform an approximate study in the two  dimensional case and we are able to explain the results found via the monte carlo simulation .",
    "the most interesting effect that is pointed out by this analysis is that the sub  linear behavior discussed above is due to a sort of depletion of the region close to the pore , which is observed when the typical time spent by the pore in the low ",
    "affinity state is large .",
    "the one dimensional model has been studied to some extent exactly in order to support our approximate two  dimensional analysis and to test the reliability of our monte carlo computation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ s : modello ]",
    "we introduce the model , describe the quantities that are measured with the monte carlo procedure , and give their physical interpretation .",
    "sections  [ s : risultati][s : discussione ] are devoted to the discussion of our numerical results : we first focus on the possibility of realizing gating via selection and on the way in which the potassium flux loss can be reduced ; then we discuss the dependence of the fluxes on the physiological parameters of the model . in section  [",
    "s : toy ] we give an approximate analytical study of the two  dimensional model and in section  [ s : conclusioni ] we summarize our conclusions .",
    "appendices are devoted to the detailed algorithmic definition of the model and to the exact one  dimensional study .",
    "( 200,220 ) ( -100,-20 )     \\1 .",
    "the model that we study in this paper is inspired to the two  dimensional one proposed in  @xcite .",
    "we give now a quick glance to the model and postpone the precise description of the algorithm to the appendix  [ s : bold ] .",
    "the cytosolic region of the cell is modeled via a finite two  dimensional square lattice @xmath1 with @xmath2 sites , where @xmath3 is an odd integer ( see figure  [ f : reticolo ] ( left ) ) .",
    "we consider a two dimensional model for simplicity , but as it will be discussed in the sequel , the model is able to capture the main features of the real behavior .",
    "two ionic species perform independent symmetric random walks on the lattice with reflectivity conditions on the boundary @xmath4 of the volume @xmath1 .",
    "one of the site of the boundary is special and it is called _ pore _ ; its behavior , that will be described below , makes the potassium walkers not independent . the number of potassium and sodium walkers are respectively denoted by @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the fact that the walkers are independent on @xmath1 means that the position of a particle does not affect the motion of the others , in particular no constraint to the number of particles on each site is prescribed .",
    "the pore is modeled by the site in the middle of one of the four sides of the boundary @xmath4 .",
    "two states are allowed for the pore : _ high  affinity _ and _ low ",
    "affinity_. the pore switches between the two states randomly ; the probability that the pore is in the low  affinity state is denoted by @xmath7 .",
    "the behavior of the particles on the site neighboring the pore depends on the state of the pore itself as it is precisely stated in figure  [ f : reticolo ] .",
    "the idea is the following : if the pore site is in the low ",
    "affinity state , both potassium and sodium ions can enter it ; when they enter the pore they immediately dissociate so that , with probability @xmath8 , they reenter @xmath1 and with the same probability exit the system . if the pore is in the high  affinity state , sodium ions are reflected by the pore site and potassium ions are reflected by the pore if it is occupied , while they can enter it if it is free . in this last case",
    "the ion does not dissociate immediately , but it remains bounded to the pore until its state is changed to the low ",
    "affinity one .",
    "as noted above , due to the pore rule , the sodium walkers are independent while the potassium ones are not .    whenever an ion exits the system a particle of the same species is put at random with uniform probability @xmath9 on one of the @xmath2 sites in @xmath1 so that the number of sodium and potassium ions in the system remains constant .",
    "the model described above is implemented with the monte carlo algorithm which will be described in detail in the appendix  [ s : bold ] .",
    "iteration _ or _ sweep _ of the monte carlo is the collection of the steps that are performed at each time @xmath10 .",
    "the number of iterations that are performed in a simulation is @xmath11 .",
    "the particles that exit the system model the outgoing ionic flux .",
    "this is precisely what we want to measure . for a single numerical experiment",
    "we let @xmath12 ( resp .",
    "@xmath13 ) be the number of sodium ( resp .",

    "@xmath18 ) .",
    "since we defined the monte carlo algorithm in such a way that the number of sodium and potassium ions keep constant in the volume @xmath1 , both @xmath15 and @xmath16 approach a constant value for @xmath19 . to estimate these limiting values , which are denoted by @xmath20 and @xmath21",
    ", we perform different numerical experiments with number of iterations @xmath11 sufficiently large , we then average the experimental measures @xmath22 and @xmath23 and compute the associated statistical errors .",
    "our aim is to measure @xmath20 and @xmath21 and to prove that the model provides selection in an efficient way .",
    "the two ionic species interact in the same way with the pore in the low ",
    "affinity state , see the rules in figure  [ f : reticolo ] ; hence , when @xmath7 is close to one , no difference should be observed in the potassium and sodium fluxes .",
    "a different behavior should be observed at smaller @xmath7 , indeed when the pore is in the high  affinity state the sodium flux is blocked while some residual potassium flux should be recorded .",
    "we shall then compute the ratio @xmath24 and prove that it becomes large for @xmath7 small .",
    "moreover we shall discuss if this selection mechanism is efficient , namely , we shall see that selection is provided with a potassium flux comparable with the flux measured when the pore is constantly in the low ",
    "affinity state .",
    "in particular in the sequel we shall discuss a slightly different model which will provide selection without flux reduction .",
    "we first describe how the physiological parameters of the model have been chosen .",
    "we have considered different values of the number of potassium ( @xmath5 ) and sodium ( @xmath6 ) particles .",
    "although cytosol is typically much richer in potassium than in sodium , in order to check the efficiency of the selectivity filter , we have always taken @xmath25 . in all the simulations discussed in this section we have chosen @xmath26 , while we considered the cases @xmath27 and @xmath28 note that the total time fraction the pore spends in the low ",
    "affinity state is essentially equal to @xmath29 .    it is worth noting that , provided @xmath26 , the most physiologically reasonable choice for the number of potassium ions among those listed above seems to be @xmath30",
    "this is supported by the following very rough computation .",
    "the concentration of potassium ions in cytosol is approximatively equal to @xmath31  mm ( millimolar ) , that is @xmath32 mole per cubic meter .",
    "the radius of the potassium ion is @xmath33  m ; assuming that each site of the lattice can accommodate at most @xmath34 ions , we can ascribe the volume @xmath35 to each site of the lattice .",
    "the number of potassium ions that must be put on the lattice is then @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the avogadro number , i.e. , the number of ions in a mole . assuming that reasonable values of @xmath34 ranges between 1 and 10 , we have that realistic values of the number of potassium ions on the lattices ranges from 25 to 250 .",
    "the sole monte carlo parameter to be fixed is the number of sweeps @xmath11 . as explained above it",
    "must be taken large enough in order to get a good estimate of the outgoing fluxes .",
    "in all the cases that we considered it was sufficient to take @xmath38 .",
    "( 200,180 ) ( -35,170 )",
    "as it has already been stated our first purpose is checking the behavior of the ratio @xmath24 as a function of the probability @xmath7 .",
    "results are shown in figure  [ f : ratio ] : from the bottom to the top the ratio @xmath24 for @xmath39 has been plotted as a function of @xmath7 .",
    "we have that the ratio between the potassium and the sodium outgoing fluxes increases when the probability for the pore to be in the low  affinity state is decreased .",
    "this is precisely the result in  @xcite ; in particular for @xmath40 our data are not only qualitatively but also quantitatively close to those in  @xcite , although a different ion dynamics in the cytoplasm has been considered .",
    "as noted in  @xcite it is then possible to imagine a potassium channel in which gating is realized via the selectivity filter .",
    "the log  log plots in figure  [ f : ratio ] shows a straight line behavior for @xmath7 large , say @xmath41 . note that the threshold where the linear behavior starts is smaller for smaller values of the ionic density in cytosol .",
    "this means that in this regime , say @xmath41 , the ratio @xmath24 can be well approximated by a power law @xmath42 the coefficient @xmath43 and @xmath44 can be computed by fitting the data plotted in figure  [ f : ratio ] ; we obtain @xmath45 and @xmath46 respectively for @xmath47 .",
    "it is worth noting that , if the density of ions in the cytosolic region is not too high , good selection ratios are reached at not too small @xmath7 ; this is good news , since too low values of @xmath7 would imply very small ionic currents . in particular ,",
    "good results are found for the physiologically reasonable parameters @xmath40 . when the number of particles in the system is raised the selection effects",
    "are widely reduced .",
    "this is quite intuitive , indeed , when the density is large , the average number of particles trying to enter the pore is large , as well ; in other words the time between two consecutive attempts to enter the pore is small .",
    "if the typical duration of the intervals in which the pore stays in the high  affinity state is larger than this  knocking \" time , a lot of attempts to enter the pore will abort since the filter is occupied by another particle .",
    "it is then clear that the selection mechanisms does not work in the optimal regime . in the sequel",
    "we shall propose a modified version of the model which will take care of this problem .",
    "( 200,180 ) ( -35,170 )    we have seen that the algorithm provides good selection for @xmath7 small enough ; at physiological concentrations , in order to get a ratio @xmath24 larger than @xmath48 , the low ",
    "affinity state probability @xmath7 must be chosen smaller than @xmath49 . in this regime",
    "we expect a potassium flux reduction with respect to the case @xmath50 .",
    "we estimate , now , this loss by plotting in figure  [ f : normalizzo ] the normalized potassium and sodium fluxes , namely , the ratio between fluxes at any @xmath7 with the corresponding fluxes at @xmath50 .",
    "we first note that the flux reduction is more effective for the sodium ions rather than for the potassium ones ; this is obvious , since the selectivity filter favors potassium particles . moreover ,",
    "in the case of sodium particles , the reduction does not depend on the number of particles on the lattice and this is due to the fact that all the sodium related measured quantities are directly proportional to the sodium density in cytosol .",
    "potassium flux , on the other hand , experiences a remarkable loss at small low  affinity state probability @xmath7 .",
    "this reduction gets more and more important as the density is increased . at physiological potassium density",
    "the flux reduction is about the 40% at very small low  affinity state probability . in respect to this point",
    "it seems that our algorithm is more efficient than the one proposed in  @xcite , indeed , in that paper , with a similar selection ability , larger potassium flux losses were found . in other words",
    "the importance of potassium flux loss depends on how the cytosol dynamics is modeled , indeed in our model ions move inside the cell according to a symmetric random walk , while in @xcite they perform a uniform motion until the boundary is reached . in the next section",
    "we propose a modified version of the model aiming to reduce potassium losses .",
    "as it has been discussed above , the model which has been proposed before is able to describe the gating attitude of a potassium channel via a suitable selectivity filter .",
    "the main problem with this approach is that the presence of the filter reduces the amount of the permeating potassium ions . to be more precise , in order to obtain a remarkable selection one has to assume that the time fraction in which the pore is in the low ",
    "affinity state is very small . from the data in figure",
    "[ f : ratio ] , it follows that , at physiological concentrations , in order to get the ratio @xmath24 larger or equal to 100 one has to assume @xmath51 . as shown in figure  [",
    "f : normalizzo ] , at these values of the low ",
    "affinity state probability an important reduction of the potassium flux is observed .",
    "this phenomenon has a simple explanation : at small @xmath7 many attempts performed by k@xmath0 ions to exit the cell abort since it often happens that the pore is in the high  affinity state and occupied by another potassium particle .",
    "this problem can be bypassed by assuming that more than one ion at time can be accommodated in the pore .",
    "we test this idea in the simplest possible way : we do not model the pore structure or any possible interaction between ions in the pore as it has been done in  @xcite ( this is obviously a very interesting question deserving future investigation ) .",
    "we simply assume that there is no upper bound to the number of ions that can be accommodated in the pore ( see below ) .",
    "in other words when the filter is in the high  affinity state , a potassium particle can enter it even if the pore is currently occupied by one or more potassium ions .",
    "this modified version of our model will assure no potassium flux reduction since all the potassium ions trying to enter the pore in the high  affinity state will be accepted and then will be released when the state of the filter will switch to the low ",
    "affinity one .",
    "this model will not be physiologically reasonable if the typical number of potassium ions stuffed inside the pore is large . from",
    "what it is known on the structure of ionic channels ( see , for instance , @xcite ) , a potassium channel is about @xmath52    long and @xmath53    in diameter .",
    "this means , recalling that the radius of a potassium ion is approximatively @xmath54   , that at most four or five potassium particles can coexist inside the pore .",
    "we stress that in this simple model we do not take into account any interaction , for instance electrostatic repulsion , between ions in the pore .",
    "as we shall see , at physiological densities , i.e. , @xmath40 and for @xmath55 , the average number of potassium ions in the pore will be very low and at most four particles ( in very rare cases ) will be simultaneously accommodated inside the pore .",
    "we shall then conclude that in this regime our simple model is reasonable on physiological grounds .",

    "we then conclude that gating can be achieved via a selectivity filter in an efficient way .",
    "we have also studied extensively the model discussing the behavior of potassium and sodium fluxes as functions of the interesting physiological parameters , i.e. , the ionic cytosolic density and the time fraction the filter spends in the low  affinity state .",
    "it is remarkable to notice that the flux of the ionic species which is not affected by the selectivity filter , sodium in our model , is directly proportional to the cytosolic density .",
    "a sub  linear behavior is found for potassium    in conclusion we think that lattice models provide essential and tunable tools to investigate efficiently the properties of ionic channels by analyzing the wealth of experimental data available on this subject .",

    "this model is defined as the basic one with a single difference : the rule for a potassium ion in the site neighboring the pore when the pore is occupied and in the high  affinity state ( see the right top part of figure  [ f : reticolo ] ) is the same experienced when the pore is free in the high  affinity state .",
    "the basic model introduced in section  [ s : modello ] can be easily specialized to the one  dimensional case .",

    "the computation of @xmath70 is more difficult , since the interaction between the potassium ions and the pore is not as trivial as for sodium .",
    "in particular , due to the possibility that a potassium ion is trapped in the pore , the potassium walkers can not be considered independent .",
    "we shall treat this case by assuming that in the stationary state the probability for the pore to be occupied by one of the @xmath5 potassium ions is @xmath76 .",
