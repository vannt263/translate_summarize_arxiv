    "although classical electromagnetism forbids electrostatic fields inside empty conducting shells , quantum mechanics suggests that small fields might exist . in the spirit of yukawa s particle - exchange theory of forces @xcite , a modified version of maxwell s equations",
    "was derived to account for a possible non - zero rest mass of the photon , the exchange particle of the coulomb force @xcite . because a finite photon mass would limit the range of the coulomb force , these equations violate gauss s law and make these fields possible .    the experimental search for deviations from coulomb s inverse - square law goes back as early as 1769 @xcite .",
    "although no field has been found at the sensitivity level of these experiments , based on the predicted sensitivity of the experiments an upper limit on the photon rest mass has been determined .",
    "the most recent tests of coulomb s law were limited by the sensitivity of the voltage - measurement electronics and possible back - action of the measurement process on the potentials being measured @xcite .",
    "progress on these experiments has been slow  the limit on the rest mass of a photon from these types of experiments has decreased by only a factor of 2.5 in the last 35 years .",
    "we recently proposed to use ion interferometry to improve this measurement by _ several orders of magnitude _ @xcite . in this experiment ,",
    "a voltage would be applied across a concentric pair of conducting cylindrical shells .",
    "a beam of ions traveling through the inner shell would be split and recombined using either physical gratings or laser beams .",
    "a non - zero electric field in the shell would induce a phase shift between the arms of the interferometer , resulting in a shift in the interference pattern .",
    "while investigating the feasibility of the experiment , we performed several numerical calculations of classical and non - classical electrostatic potentials in the proposed apparatus . in this paper",
    "we discuss the methods and results of these calculations .",
    "in the proposed experiment , a non - zero electric field will be searched for inside the inner of two concentric cylindrical conductors held at different voltages . the inner conductor s end caps would have several small holes to allow passage of the ions and to allow laser beams and/or wires to enter . for the experiment to work , the fringing fields  \" leaking  \" through these holes must be small compared to the non - classical field under study . in addition , the calculations in @xcite assume that the non - classical part of the potential between the interferometer gratings is approximately that of an infinite cylinder . to verify that these conditions are met , we performed several numerical calculations .",
    "the setup assumed for these calculations is illustrated in fig.[cap : layout - of - conductors . ] .",
    "the inner conducting shell was assumed to be a thin - walled 2.6 m long cylinder , 27 cm in radius .",
    "it is capped on either end with conducting disks , also 27 cm in radius .",
    "these disks are 20 cm long to reduce fringing fields through the holes .",
    "this inner shell is surrounded by a second conducting tube with end caps .",
    "the outer tube is 3.06 m long with an inner radius of 30 cm , giving a 3 cm clearance between the inner and outer shells on all sides .",
    "the inner shell was assumed to be at a voltage @xmath0 relative to the outer shell , which was assumed to be grounded . in an actual experiment",
    ", @xmath0 will likely be hundreds of kv .",
    "but because all of the potentials we calculated scale linearly with @xmath0 , we set @xmath1 for our calculations , and then scaled the results .    for simplicity we performed our calculations for a cylindrically - symmetric geometry , replacing the holes in the inner conductor s end caps with radial slices generated by rotating a 1 cm hole about the axis at a radius of 25 cm .",
    "as such , the fringing fields that we calculate will be significantly larger than the actual fields in the real apparatus , and the calculation should be considered a `` worst case '' estimate .",
    "to find the classical fringing - field potential @xmath2 from a given set of static boundary conditions we use laplace s equation .",
    "for the non - classical field , we use the counterpart to laplace s equation for massive photons : @xmath3 the constant @xmath4 in this equation is related to the photon rest mass @xmath5 by the relation @xmath6 .    for the non - classical calculation , instead of solving for @xmath7 , we solved for the deviation from the classical potential @xmath8 . with this definition , eq .",
    "[ eq : proca ] becomes@xmath9 laplace s equation states that @xmath10 , so the first term in the above equation is zero .",
    "also , since @xmath4 is known to be very small , we expect @xmath7 to be approximately equal to @xmath2 .",
    "this implies that @xmath11 will be very small compared to @xmath2 . as such",
    ", we can drop the last term . and",
    "since we do nt know a - priori what @xmath4 is equal to , we will normalize our equation by defining a new parameter @xmath12 .",
    "making this substitution and cancelling out the @xmath13 in both terms we get @xmath14    equation [ eq : phi_s ] is simply poisson s equation with @xmath2 playing the part of the charge distribution . as such , our simulation need only to be able to solve one equation , @xmath15 to calculate the classical potential @xmath2 , we simply replace @xmath16 with @xmath2 and insert @xmath17 into this equation .",
    "to calculate the non - classical part of the potential , we first calculate @xmath2 .",
    "then we then replace @xmath16 with @xmath18 , and insert our previously calculated values for @xmath2 as the source term @xmath19 . for an axially - symmetric system , eq .",
    "[ eq : poisson ] can be written as a two - dimensional equation in cylindrical coordinates:@xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the radial and axial coordinates .",
    "note that if @xmath23 , a constant potential is not a solution to eq .",
    "[ eq : proca ] , and we are not free to arbitrarily define the outer conductor to be at @xmath24 .",
    "but if this conductor is earth grounded , due to the huge capacitance of the earth it is reasonable to assume that @xmath25 will remain fairly constant as the voltage on the inner conductor is changed . in the proposed experiment the inner conductor s voltage relative to the outer conductor would be periodically reversed .",
    "rather than measuring the field inside the conductor , the _ difference _ between the field before and after the reversal would be measured . in this measurement",
    "the the unknown voltage offset @xmath25 will cancel .",
    "as such , setting @xmath24 in our calculations still gives us meaningful results .",
    "we did our calculations using a finite difference method , in which the potential is calculated at points on a grid .",
    "derivatives are approximated to second order from adjacent points on the grid .",
    "our grid was evenly spaced in both dimensions , with points separated by a distance @xmath26 .",
    "the potential @xmath16 at each point on the grid will be written as @xmath27 and the source term @xmath19 at each point as @xmath28 , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are integers labeling the point .",
    "we will define @xmath31 at the center of the conducting shells , such that the actual coordinates of each grid point are equal to @xmath32 and @xmath33 . using these definitions , eq .",
    "[ eq : poissonaxial ] can be approximated by the equation@xmath34 this can be solved for @xmath27 in terms of the known quantity @xmath28 and the value of @xmath16 at adjacent grid points:@xmath35.\\label{eq : phiij}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we began our simulation with an arbitrary value of @xmath27 at each grid point . then using gauss - seidel iteration @xcite , this equation was evaluated at each point to produce an updated value of @xmath27 .",
    "after many iterations , @xmath27 eventually converged to the correct values to solve eq .",
    "[ eq : poissonfinite ] .",
    "to accelerate convergence , we used the successive over - relaxation method @xcite .",
    "one group of points which requires attention are the points for which @xmath36 . because @xmath21 is always positive in cylindrical coordinates ,",
    "@xmath27 is not defined for negative values of @xmath29 .",
    "but there is effectively no difference between cylindrical and cartesian coordinates for the row of points along the axis .",
    "so for these points we calculated derivatives using cartesian coordinates knowing that the points directly below the axis and just into or out of the two - dimensional grid should have the same value as the point directly above each point on the axis .",
    "this gives the equation@xmath37    in addition to axial symmetry , the conductors have mirrored symmetry about their center .",
    "this allows us to throw away all of the grid points with @xmath38 , cutting the number of grid points in half .",
    "doing this requires us to treat the @xmath39 points differently , because our grid no longer contain values for @xmath40 . by symmetry",
    "we know that @xmath41 .",
    "this allows us to replace @xmath40 with @xmath42 in eq .",
    "[ eq : phiij ] .",
    "the point @xmath43 is a special point , being both a member of the @xmath44 and @xmath45 groups of points .",
    "for this point we use eq .",
    "[ eq : phi0j ] , but substitute @xmath46 for @xmath47 .",
    "after every 100 iterations , the program calculated an estimated error at each point by evaluating eq .",
    "[ eq : phiij ] at each point without changing any values on the grid .",
    "we defined the estimated fractional error to be@xmath48 where @xmath27 is the actual value at grid point ( @xmath29,@xmath30 ) and @xmath49 is the value calculated from eq .",
    "[ eq : phiij ] . if there were no points on the grid with a fractional error larger than @xmath50 , the simulation terminated .",
    "while experimenting with different conductor geometries , we significantly decreased the required computation time by successively reducing the size of the grid in the axial direction .",
    "this was done by finding columns which had already converged near their final value and then using these values as the new boundary conditions for a problem involving a smaller grid . to do this",
    "the program used a variable @xmath51 , initialized to the largest @xmath30 index on the grid , and only updated points with @xmath52 .",
    "after each set of 100 iterations the program stopped and calculated the fractional error for each of the points with @xmath53 . if the fractional error at every point in this column was smaller than @xmath50 , the program would reduce @xmath51 by one , thereby reducing the effective size of the grid .",
    "the program then repeated this process until it found a column which contained at least one point who s fractional error was larger than the specified value .",
    "then the over - relaxation parameter was re - calculated and the next set of 100 iterations was performed .",
    "this process is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ cap : reducing - the - grid ] .",
    "the error introduced by stepping in should be negligible ; if a column has converged to within a factor @xmath54 of its final value , the error introduced onto other points by `` freezing '' this column should be of order @xmath54 .",
    "therefore , for a grid with @xmath55 columns , the largest fractional error introduced anywhere on the grid by this method should be on the order of @xmath56 if the errors are assumed to be random , and on the order of @xmath57 or smaller otherwise .    because we have not done a rigorous theoretical study of this method , once we had decided on the final geometry for our conductors we verified our calculations by performing additional computations which did not use this `` stepping in '' method .",
    "the result of these calculations were identical to those done with the stepping - in technique to the seven digits of precision saved at the end of the calculations .",
    "for the classical fringing - field calculation we are mainly interested in how the potential inside the inner conductor varies from @xmath0 , the voltage of the inner conductor . to keep round - off error from completely masking these variations",
    ", we made use of the fact that classical electromagnetism allows us to arbitrarily add a constant potential .",
    "so rather than solving laplace s equation for @xmath2 , we instead solved for @xmath58 using the same equation but different boundary conditions  @xmath59 on the outer conductor and @xmath60 on the inner conductor .",
    "this way we found small deviations from zero rather than a finite potential .    the results of this calculation are shown in fig .",
    "[ cap : fields](a ) .",
    "we have verified that the errors due to a finite grid are negligible by performing this calculation with other grid spacings .",
    "if the grid spacing @xmath26 is increased by a factor of 3 , @xmath61 at the center of the conductors changes by 9% .",
    "if @xmath26 is increased by a factor of 1.5 , it changes by only 1.3% .",
    "we fit these three results to a power law , and found that the fit is in good agreement with a fourth data set data in which @xmath26 is increased by a factor of 6 . from this fit",
    "we estimate an error on the order of 0.3% .    to verify the validity of our results we used a series solution to calculate the field inside of the inner conductor assuming that the inner conductor was grounded , and that the potential inside of the radial slices in the end caps was a fixed constant .",
    "this calculation showed that the potential at the center of the tube would be @xmath62 times the potential inside the radial slices , in good agreement with our numerical calculation .",
    "we also found a series solution for the field between two grounded cylinders with a fixed potential applied to the gap at the ends .",
    "the length of the cylinders was assumed to be equal to the sum of the lengths of the two end caps , with a gap between them equal in size to the radial slice in the end caps .",
    "the field in the center of the gap turned out to be @xmath63 times smaller than the potential at the end , also in agreement with our numerical calculation .",
    "to calculate @xmath18 , we set @xmath64 in eq .",
    "[ eq : phi_s ] and used the same methods discussed above .",
    "since the potential on the conducting surfaces is given , the deviation from the classical potential should be zero on these surfaces .",
    "so the boundary conditions for the @xmath18 calculation were that @xmath65 on both of the conductors .",
    "the source term @xmath19 in this calculation is equal to @xmath2 .",
    "we can obtain this by adding @xmath0 to our already completed calculation of @xmath61 . inside the inner conductor , where @xmath61 is very small , this results in values accurate to the total precision allowed by the double - precision floating - point format .",
    "but between the two conductors , adding @xmath0 to @xmath61 results in _ lost _ precision .",
    "we are only interested in the fields inside the inner conductor , which should not be affected by this lost precision  the non - classical potential is predominantly generated by the local source term @xmath19 rather than from fringing fields generated outside the inner conductor . but to be extra careful we also calculated @xmath2 directly using the correct boundary conditions ( the inner conductor at @xmath0 and the outer one at @xmath60 ) , and used these values wherever @xmath2 was less than @xmath66 .    the results of this calculation are shown in fig .",
    "[ cap : fields](b ) .",
    "figure [ cap : fields](c ) shows the results of a similar calculation in which additional conductors were added to simulate optics and other objects inside the inner shell .",
    "these conductors consisted of a ring and a cylinder at the three locations where gratings would be positioned in the interferometer .",
    "the rings were assumed to be 6 cm wide and 1.5 cm thick , just touching the inner shell , and the cylinders to be 6 cm long and 1.5 cm in radius , centered on the axis of the inner shell , as shown in fig .",
    "[ cap : layout - of - conductors . ] .",
    "these conductors were assumed to be at the same potential as the inner shell .",
    "we estimate the error in these calculation to be very small  to the seven digits output by our program there was no change in @xmath18 when we increased the grid spacing by a factor of 3 .",

    "while this figure shows the _ potential _ at _ each point _ moving radially from the axis , for the proposed ion interferometer experiment , all that is important is the _ field _ _ at _ _ the location of the ion beam_. as such , the most important information in this figure is the radial slope of the potential at @xmath67 .    in fig .",

    "[ cap : comparing - potentials](b ) we see that although the effect of small objects inside the shell on the non - classical potential is not negligible , it should not greatly change the sensitivity of the experiment as long as care is taken . because axial symmetry is assumed",
