    "the high @xmath6 transition metal oxides have been intensely studied , with the focus of most researchers directed towards the physics of the cuo@xmath7 planes .",
    "undoped , these planes are composed of s = @xmath8 spins at each cu site , and it has been shown that a simple heisenberg hamiltonian with a near  neighbour exchange of the order of 1500 k provides an excellent representation of the antiferromagnetic ( afm ) interactions between the spins over a wide temperature range @xcite .",
    "having confidence in a good model of the undoped state , a theory must be developed dealing with the motion of carriers in a cu ",
    "spin background . upon doping the planes mobile holes are produced , and these holes are known to predominantly occupy the oxygen sites in the cuo@xmath9 planes . however , anderson first proposed that one  band models are sufficient to represent the important low  energy physics of such carrier motion @xcite .",
    "this proposition was formalized in work by zhang and rice @xcite , and later by shastry @xcite : starting from a three  band hubbard model they delineated how it is possible to map the oxygen hole motion onto a one  band @xmath10 model ( in fact , in shastry s formulation , hopping processes connecting sites that are further than next ",
    "nearest  neighbour are allowed ) .",
    "it is to be emphasized that at the end of this renormalization , the spin degree of freedom of the oxygen carrier described by the three  band hubbard model is quenched , and the carrier described by the @xmath10 model is a _",
    "spinless _ vacancy .",
    "while this renormalization has been the subject of some debate , no definitive experimental data have allowed for one to say that the one  band model is indeed a viable representation of carrier motion . instead , one  band model researchers",
    "are forced to adopt something similar to the following posture : the physics of the @xmath10 model is sufficiently difficult to warrant the attention of a high @xmath6 theorist , and hopefully the physics of the superconducting instability and the anomalous normal state will be contained in this model .",
    "fortunately , recent experimental work does allow for careful qualitative and quantitative scrutiny of this assumption . to be specific , angle  resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) of insulating @xmath1",
    "was recently completed @xcite .",
    "this experiment presents theorists with , for the first time , data for the spectral function of a _ single _ hole propagating in a @xmath11 plane .",
    "in fact , @xmath1 is an ideal model system to obtain such data since complications associated with the orthorhombicity of many high @xmath6 materials can be avoided  @xmath1 does not undergo such a structural phase transition until about 10 k and reliable arpes data were collected at 350 k.    subsequent to this work , a comparison of the @xmath10 model s @xmath0 results to the arpes data of ref .",
    "@xcite displayed that the one  band model did not reproduce the bandstructure everywhere in the afm brillouin zone @xcite .",
    "instead , in this same paper @xcite , we summarized our results showing that the three  band model in the strong  coupling limit did a superb job of reproducing the @xmath12 arpes data for all wave vectors . here",
    "we elaborate on that work and also display a new , more detailed comparison to experiment .",
    "in this paper we focus on a model of oxygen holes moving in a @xmath11 plane .",
    "a new variational wave function for this problem is introduced and applied to the @xmath1 arpes data .",
    "this variational wave function is similar in spirit to the successful semi  classical variational wave functions introduced by shraiman and siggia for the one  band model @xcite and later generalized to the three  band model @xcite .",
    "however , unlike the variational wave function of ref .",
    "@xcite , here we include the lowest  order quantum fluctuations of the occupied cu ",
    "o  cu bond , thus allowing for the so  called trion quasiparticle @xcite to be accounted for .",
    "these quantum fluctuations permit , in principle , for the spin of the oxygen hole to be quenched to zero , an essential ingredient in the zhang  rice renormalization @xcite of the three  band hubbard model to the one  band @xmath13 model .",
    "we show that our new variational wave function for a single oxygen hole provides an excellent representation of the @xmath0 relation measured in ref .",
    "@xcite for physically reasonable exchange and hopping parameters .",
    "we then analyze these wave functions and show that unlike the result of the renormalization of the three  band to the one  band model , the spin of the carrier is not quenched to zero everywhere in the brillouin zone .",
    "this thus provides us with an understanding of the inability of the @xmath10 model to reproduce the @xmath0 data at all wave vectors @xcite .",
    "further analysis has allowed us to reduce this quasiparticle to that of a doublet ( the ground state of three s=@xmath8 spins antiferromagnetically coupled , as in the occupied cu  o  cu bond ) moving in a distorted nel background of cu spins , _ viz .",
    "_ , the trion quasiparticle of ref .",

    "our paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 we describe the components of the three  band model in the strong  coupling limit . in  3 we present our new variational wave function , a description particular to the three  band model and one that contains some quantum fluctuations of the propagating oxygen hole .",
    "this section also contains a comparison of our results to the arpes data of ref .",
    "section 4 presents an analysis of the wave function that results from the fit to the arpes data , including the nature and spin of the quasiparticle . finally , ",
    "5 summarizes our main findings and describes future work on this problem .",
    "the application of the extended three  band hubbard model to a description of the @xmath11 planes of the high @xmath6 oxides was first discussed by emery @xcite and varma _ et al _ @xcite .",
    "the parameters that are believed to enter this model have been evaluated elsewhere @xcite .",
    "here we simply note that if one takes a @xmath14 configuration as the vacuum state , then in the strong  coupling limit one can derive the following hamiltonian as representative of the motion of oxygen holes in a cu ",

    "the primed summation indicates that the superexchange is not calculated for the bond containing the oxygen hole .",
    "the @xmath22 hopping process corresponds to the oxygen hole passing through a cu site without affecting the cu hole , whereas the @xmath23 hopping exchanges the carrier with the hole of a cu site  a more detailed description of the hopping processes and notation for this hamiltonian are provided in ref .",
    "implicit in eq .",
    "( [ eq:3tj ] ) is the reduction of all oxygen @xmath24 and cu @xmath25 orbitals to one s having an effective s  wave character  _",
    "e.g. _ , see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "cu superexchange parameter has been measured to be 0.125 ev @xcite , and here we fix @xmath26 ev .",
    "further , it has been argued @xcite that @xmath27 , and thus we fix @xmath28 ev @xcite . to estimate the hopping energies , perturbation theory @xcite and electronic structure work @xcite may be used .",
    "( in the perturbation theory we have used a reduced @xmath29 energy overlap integral @xmath30 ev to account , in a first  order fashion , for the larger lattice constant of @xmath1  this value , when employed with perturbation theory , accurately predicts the cu  cu superexchange . )",
    "we find @xmath31 these numbers are similar to other published sets of estimates .",
    "we have chosen to fix both the experimentally determined @xmath32 , as well as our value of @xmath33 = 0.63 ev ( varying @xmath33 by @xmath34 per cent does not affect our results ) . however , the other parameters we allow to become fitting parameters , and we choose them by fitting to the @xmath35  arpes data . of course , if our fitted parameters are too far from those expressed in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hybert 3tj energies ] ) then it is not at all clear that our fits are in any way physically reasonable .",
    "fortunately , we find reasonably close agreement with these numbers .",
    "one successful approach @xcite to the problem of a vacancy moving in an afm background described by the @xmath36 model was proposed by shraiman and siggia . in their formalism",
    "the undoped state corresponds to a classical afm , a state which has as its wave function a simple product of spinors .",
    "then they suggested that one way to determine the symmetry and spin texture of the singly  doped ground state involved taking a semiclassical variational wave function based on a product state of spinors representing ( again ) a classical cu ",
    "spin background that included a single vacancy .",
    "bloch states can be formed from this product state , and then the direction of each individual spin ( relative to the position of the vacancy ) was determined by the variational principle , namely ( figuratively speaking ) by allowing for the delocalization of the hole without costing too much magnetic exchange energy .",
    "it is to be stressed that even though the exchange interactions are treated using classical spins , the vacancy is placed in a bloch state and as it moves throughout the lattice the quantum ",
    "mechanical overlaps of the spins are fully accounted for . a detailed account and summary of the results and predictions of the field theory that results from this work",
    "can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    the extrapolation of this idea to the strong  coupling three  band hamiltonian of eq .  ( [ eq:3tj ] )",
    "was carried out by frenkel , one of the present authors , and shraiman and siggia @xcite . however , when we applied the type of variational wave function developed in ref .",
    "@xcite to the @xmath35  arpes data of ref .",
    "@xcite , we found that our fits led to ridiculous hopping energies @xcite .",
    "thus , we have produced a new variational wave function which we feel better approximates the physics of the carrier motion of an oxygen hole in a @xmath11 plane .    to introduce our wave function",
    "it is instructive to first state the wave function that was developed and studied in ref .",
    "the shraiman - siggia  type wave functions incorporate the broken symmetry of the afm lattice ; thus , referring to fig .",
    "1 , for a model that includes both the cu and oxygen sites there are two cu basis sites ( the spin up and spin down sublattices of the afm ) and four oxygen basis sites per primitive unit cell . labeling the cu sites by their position with respect to the unit cell in which the oxygen hole resides , _ viz .",
    "_ , the unit cell denoted by @xmath37 , one may write the wave function in the following form : @xmath38 in this equation , @xmath16 labels the primitive unit cells and @xmath39 is the origin of the @xmath16th unit cell .",
    "the product is over pairs of spinors , the pairs corresponding to the up and down sublattice cu spins in each unit cell , where , say , the up sublattice cu site is at @xmath39 and then the down sublattice cu site is at @xmath40 .",
    "the four basis sites at which the oxygen hole may be found are denoted by @xmath41 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , and the state of each cu spinor can depend on which of the four sites the oxygen hole is found at . finally , these states are put into bloch states labeled by some wave vector @xmath42 .",
    "the minimum energy state at each wave vector is found by minimizing the variational parameters in this wave function .",
    "the variational parameters can be understood as follows : consider one oxygen hole location in a lattice with n unit cells .",
    "there are 2n cu sites implying that 4n angles fully specify the cu spinors .",
    "since there are four possible oxygen hole locations per unit cell and there is a complex amplitude @xmath43 associated with each oxygen position , there are a total of 16n + 16 variational parameters .",
    "however , since the absolute orientation of the spins and the overall phase of the wave function are arbitrary , there are only 16n + 12 variational parameters in this normalized wave function that are physically meaningful to change .",
    "we have numerically obtained converged results as a function of increasing n.    as mentioned above , we previously found @xcite that the hopping parameters that are required to make the dispersion relation of this variational wave function best approximate the arpes data of ref .",
    "@xcite , _ viz .",
    "_ , @xmath44  ev , and @xmath45  ev , are physically unreasonable  see eq .",
    "( [ eq : hybert 3tj energies ] ) .",
    "also , the bandstructure produced from this wave function does not agree with the experimentally observed flat band from @xmath46 .",
    "thus , we now present the formalism and motivating ideas behind our new variational wave function .",
    "one possible reason for the failure of the three  band semiclassical wave function follows from the analysis of zhang and rice @xcite : quite simply , these authors showed how local hopping processes tended to quench the spin of the oxygen hole to zero _ at each oxygen site _ , thus producing spinless vacancies . in their formalism , this can only happen if the oxygen hole is allowed to execute quantum fluctuations between its up and down spin states at each site  clearly , eq .  ( [ eq:3 band sc ] )",
    "does not include the possibility of such fluctuations .",
    "assuming that the reduction of the oxygen hole s spin is indeed physically important ( though not necessarily conceding that this spin is quenched to zero ) we introduce the following class of variational wave functions .",
    "we have generalized the variational wave function of ref .",
    "@xcite ( presented in eq .",
    "( [ eq:3 band sc ] ) ) by including oxygen spin fluctuations . as we show below",
    ", the effect of this is to allow for quantum fluctuations of the occupied cu ",
    "o  cu bond , thus allowing for the quasiparticle to approximate the trion of ref .",
    "the new variational wave function that we consider in this paper is @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 the angles specifying the cu spinors @xmath50 and @xmath51 for the same cu site are allowed to be completely independent of one another .",
    "however , by enforcing the structure of the spinors of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : sup],[eq : sdown ] ) we ensure that the @xmath52 and @xmath53 components of this variational wave function are orthogonal to one another , and thus each product of spinors in this wave function is orthogonal to every other product of spinors .",
    "armed with this wave function we attempted to find hopping parameters that were close to those of eq .",
    "( [ eq : hybert 3tj energies ] ) such that the measured dispersion relation agreed with that produced by this new variational wave function .",
    "our results are shown in fig .",
    "2 ; clearly , the agreement that we find is superb . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "no other theory agrees with the arpes data so accurately .",
    "the energy parameters that enter eq .",
    "( [ eq:3tj ] ) that correspond to our fitted @xmath0 data are @xmath54 the comparison between the fitted hopping parameter values that we find and those obtained from perturbation theory / electronic structure work , _ viz . _",
    "( [ eq : hybert 3tj energies ] ) , is very pleasing except for the direct oxygen ",
    "oxygen hopping ( @xmath55 )  we find a value which is about half of that predicted using other techniques .",
    "it is possible that the 10 % larger lattice constant of @xmath1 in comparison to that used in the electronic structure work is responsible for part of this difference .    in fig .",
    "2 we have also shown a solid curve which is a fit to the energies obtained from our variational wave function . the fit was done using @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 ( n is an integer ) . only terms up to and including n = 4 have been included in the calculation of this curve .",
    "it is clear that eq .",
    "( [ eq : parametere ] ) preserves the afm symmetry ( @xmath59 ) and also the reflections and rotations of the @xmath60 point group .",
    "the coefficients that produce this curve are listed in table i.",
    "in this section we discuss the properties of the variational wave functions that were produced from fits to the arpes data , and focus on two issues : ( i ) if the one  band @xmath10 model does not lead to a fit with arpes whereas the three  band model does , what s the problem with the one  band model ? here",
    "we display results showing that the spin of the oxygen hole is not quenched to zero , and thus the mobile carrier does not have a spin that is quenched to zero as it is ( by definition ) for the spinless vacancies of the one  band @xmath10 model .",
    "( ii ) if the three  band to one  band ( spinless vacancy ) renormalization is not adequate for all wave vectors in the first brillouin zone , then zhang  rice quasiparticles are not a good description of the carriers everywhere in the first brillouin zone  so , what is a good description of the quasiparticles ? here",
    "we display our quantitative data verifying that the trion quasiparticle of ref .",
    "@xcite is an excellent representation of mobile carriers .    to indirectly evaluate the validity of the one  band model in describing the quasiparticles propagating in @xmath1 ,",
    "we have determined the magnitude of the spin of the oxygen hole as a function of wave vector using the variational wave functions determined in the last section . to this end , we have computed the expectation value of the oxygen spin operator : @xmath61 where the sum over @xmath62 refers to the four oxygen basis sites .",
    "our results for the magnitude of the quantity defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : oxygenspin ] ) are shown in fig .",
    "we see that along the afm brillouin zone the oxygen hole s spin is essentially quenched to zero and thus we would expect the one  band model to be a good representation of the quasiparticles along the afm brillouin zone  the one  band @xmath10 model of ref .",
    "@xcite indeed agrees with the arpes data along this branch .",
    "however , along the other high  symmetry branches of the first brillouin zone we find that the spin of the oxygen hole is not quenched to zero and is in fact quite large .",
    "concomitantly , it is along @xmath63 that the one  band @xmath10 model has difficulties fitting the arpes data .",
    "thus , if these three  band variational wave functions are indeed a good representation of the true wave functions of this system , any renormalization that attempts to quench this spin and describe the motion in terms of spinless vacancies is not necessarily justified and not necessarily going to work .",
    "if the spin of the carrier is not quenched to zero , then the spinless vacancy quasiparticles which are the biproduct of the zhang ",
    "rice renormalization @xcite can not be adequate .",
    "the question then remains : what is the best representation of the quasiparticles ?",
    "an answer first put forward by emery and reiter , _ viz .",
    "_ so  called trions , can best be understood by considering the case of a single oxygen hole localized on a cu ",
    "o  cu bond . from eq .",
    "( [ eq:3tj ] ) we have that the hamiltonian for this bond is nothing more than @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the respective spins of the two cu spins that are neighbours to the oxygen hole . letting the components of each ket refer to a cu@xmath67-o - cu@xmath7 labeling of the sites , the ground state of this problem is a doublet , with the @xmath68 wave function being given by @xmath69 emery and reiter @xcite surmised that this and its time  reversed state were the quasiparticles , so  called trions , that moved through the lattice when the oxygen hole was delocalized .",
    "in fact , if the spin distortions of the afm background were prohibited ( unlike our eq .",
    "( [ eq : vwf ] ) ) , these quasiparticles were found by klein and aharony @xcite to best describe carrier motion in @xmath11 planes .    as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , an excellent representation of the true ground state of this hamiltonian follows from a 3spin version of the variational wave function given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vwf ] ) of this paper .",
    "in fact , the success of this kind of problem in solving the above hamiltonian was one of the motivations for our consideration of eq .",
    "( [ eq : vwf ] )  to be specific , if we could ably represent the trions and they were indeed the appropriate quasiparticles of the mobile hole problem , then these should be excellent variational wave functions .",
    "we formed the density matrix for the possible states of the occupied cu ",
    "o  cu bond and calculated the trion occupation for our variational wave functions found from fitting to the arpes data ; our results are shown in fig .",
    "4 . independent of the wave vector we find that our wave functions have an occupation of at least 92 % in the trion states . note that for the high symmetry wave vectors the occupation is between 97 per cent and 98 per cent .",
    "therefore , we find that the trion doublet state is an excellent representation of the quasiparticle for these planes .",
    "we have presented our formalism for the extension of the shraiman ",
    "siggia semiclassical variational wave functions to the strong  coupling three - band model including the quantum fluctuations of the occupied cu - o - cu bond . for reasonable hopping parameters",
    "we find superb agreement with the @xmath0 dispersion relation that is measured experimentally in antiferromagnetically aligned @xmath1 . since it was found that the single ",
    "band @xmath10 model was not able to fit the quasiparticle dispersion throughout the entire first brillouin zone , perhaps the three - band model discussed in this paper will be necessary to describe the normal  state properties of these planes .",
    "however , we can not determine the full spectral function using this approach , and thus a more complete comparison of the measured @xmath70 to our three - band model is still lacking .",
    "theories of related spectral functions do indeed exist , but are unfortunately inadequate to treat the task at hand : one of the most popular analytical theories of the @xmath36 model is the self ",
    "consistent born approximation ( scba ) @xcite .",
    "it was argued in ref .",
    "@xcite that vertex corrections of the so",
    " called spin polaron model version of the @xmath36 model were absent ( _ viz _ , those of the two ",
    "loop crossing diagram ) to second  order in perturbation theory , and thus it was expected that this theory should be very successful .",
    "this forecast was indeed verified in a recent _ exact _ , unbiased numerical determination of the spectral function for a single hole propagating in the largest square cluster yet doped , _ viz . _",
    "a 32site cluster , as described by the @xmath36 model @xcite  the comparison of the exact @xmath0 dispersion relation to that predicted by the scba led to an impressive agreement .",
    "unfortunately , if one includes either a next  nearest  neighbour hopping @xmath71 in the one  band model , or applies this same formalism to the three - band model @xcite , the same cancellation of low  order vertex corrections does not occur .",
    "consequently , such approximate theories are much more speculative .",
    "thus , vertex corrections must be examined and understood before an analytical theory of the spectral function is available , and only when it is available will a full comparison of the spectral function of eq .",
