    "the origin of the low - redshift ly@xmath0  absorption clouds discovered by the _ hubble space telescope _ ( bahcall et al . 1991",
    "; morris et al . 1991 ; stocke et al . 1995 ) remains a mystery , made more tantalizing by the possibility that they may contain significant mass .",
    "are they remnants of the high - redshift ly@xmath0 forest , or are they associated with past episodes of star formation , galactic outflows , and galaxy interactions ? based on their frequency , estimated size , and an ionization correction , they appear to contain a substantial amount ( @xmath20 ) of dark baryons ( shull et al .",
    "1996 ; shull 1997 ) .",
    "there are also strong indications that some of these absorbers are associated with galaxies ( lanzetta et al .",
    "1995 ; stocke et al .",
    "1995 ; van gorkom et al .",
    "1996 ) , although the distances to the nearest bright galaxies are often quite large ( morris et al . 1993 ; stocke et al . 1995 ; shull et al . 1996",
    "; grogin & geller 1998 ) .    from numerical models , it now appears that the high-@xmath21 ly@xmath0 forest is part of a complicated gaseous structure , formed by the gravitational fluctuations of dark - matter potentials ( cen et al .",
    "1994 ; hernquist et al .",
    "1996 ; zhang et al . 1997 ) and at least partially `` polluted '' by heavy element nucleosynthesis during the epoch of galaxy formation . at high redshift , heavy elements ( c  iv ,",
    "si  iv , c  ii ) have been detected at @xmath22 times solar metallicity in 5075% of the ly@xmath0 forest clouds above @xmath23 @xmath6 column density ( cowie et al .",
    "1995 ; tytler 1995 ) . from x - ray measurements of fe - line strengths in galaxy clusters , mushotzky & loewenstein ( 1997 ) suggest that intragroup gas might be enriched to levels of 10% solar metallicity at @xmath24 .",
    "however , extrapolating these ideas to low redshift or to all ly@xmath0  clouds is difficult .",
    "although a few metal - line absorption systems have been detected at moderate redshift , no low - redshift ly@xmath0-only absorber has yet been examined for the presence of heavy elements , which would indicate contamination by star formation . to investigate this possibility in the ly@xmath0  forest",
    "requires finding absorbers of sufficient column density to detect metals [ n(h  i ) @xmath25 @xmath6 ] and located appropriately distant @xmath27 kpc ) from neighboring galaxies to suggest primordial gas .",
    "we now believe to have found an ideal target and absorbers , based on our newly analyzed ultraviolet spectra of pks  2155 - 304from the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) and 21-cm emission images from the _ very large array _ ( vla ) . toward this bright , variable ( @xmath28 ) bl  lac object , a strong ly@xmath0  line at @xmath29 km  s@xmath2",
    "was initially identified by the iue satellite ( maraschi et al .",
    "this and other ly@xmath0  lines were confirmed by low - resolution hst spectra with the faint object spectrograph ( fos / g130h ) ( allen et al . 1993 ) and with the goddard high resolution spectrograph ( ghrs / g140l ) ( bruhweiler et al . 1993 ) .",

    "( 1995 ) claimed that the 17,000 km  s@xmath2  absorbers had a combined column n(h  i ) @xmath30 @xmath6 . from our hst / ghrs measurements of the corresponding ly@xmath0  absorption",

    "previously , our group observed the pks  2155 - 304  field with the vla ( van gorkom et al .",
    "1996 ) and found evidence for three h  i galaxies corresponding to ly@xmath0  absorbers at @xmath31 , 16,500 , and 17,000 km  s@xmath2 . we associated the 17,000 km  s@xmath2  absorbers with a small group of galaxies offset from the pks  2155 - 304  sightline by @xmath32 kpc for a hubble constant @xmath33  km  s@xmath2  mpc@xmath34 . in this paper",
    ", we combine new hst and vla observations with theoretical interpretation of the pks  2155 - 304  sightline , which is unusual in the large number of strong ly@xmath0absorbers and their association with four large galaxies located within @xmath35 mpc",
    ". this number of galaxies would be high by chance , based upon the observed two - point correlation function .",
    "the average space density of galaxies in this local region , @xmath36 mpc@xmath37 , is @xmath38 times the large - scale average density of @xmath39 galaxies ( marzke , huchra & geller 1994 ) .",
    "this suggests the presence of a small group that has recently turned around from the hubble flow , much like our local group .",
    "these galaxies probably have not undergone significant mergers , but the presence of strong , broad ly@xmath0  absorption from extended gas may indicate some dynamical interaction .    in   2.1 ,",

    "the new vla data provide accurate correspondence with the ly@xmath0  absorbers , suggesting that the absorption might arise from extended halos or intragroup gas over a region 1 mpc in diameter that could total @xmath43 in mass , if bound .",

    "4 we summarize our conclusions and give suggestions for further study .",
    "somewhat contrary to the kinematic evidence , the low metallicities , [ si / h ] @xmath44 solar and [ c / h ] @xmath45 solar , would suggest that some primordial gas may still reside amidst the large - scale filaments of galaxies .",

    "based on the bell labs 21-cm survey ( stark et al .",

    "our goal is to understand the physical structure of these clouds and their possible connections with galaxy halos , large - scale structure , and voids .",
    "our data reduction method was described in these earlier papers .",
    "complete results on the seven targets in our hst cycle 6 observations , together with calibration , are described in penton et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .",
    "the ghrs spectra were taken through the @xmath63 large science aperture , using the standard quarter - diode sub - stepping pattern to yield pixels of 0.018   in fp - split mode .",
    "we recalibrated our spectra using iraf / stsdas / calhrs and the final ghrs reference files ( sherbert & hulbert 1997 ) with polynomial background subraction .",
    "one noteworthy point concerns our treatment of the hst / ghrs error vectors , which affect how we gauge the statistical significance of weak features .",
    "we found that the error vectors produced by the iraf / stsdas program * specalign * in the hst data handbook do not agree with those obtained by standard propagation of errors from individual subexposures .",
    "we have therefore chosen to perform our own error propagation and spectral coaddition using the idl software package .",
    "spectral coaddition was weighted by exposure time on a quarter - stepped , pixel - by - pixel basis , removing blemished pixels .",
    "this procedure gives some pixels less exposure time than others , but it prevents photocathode blemishes from being erronously flagged as absorption features . in some cases , this procedure results in no exposure time being available for some pixels ; straight lines between the last known good flux values are then used in figures 1 and 2 .",
    "the significance of the detected lines ( in @xmath64 ) is defined as the integrated s / n per resolution element of the fitted absorption feature .",
    "the status of `` definite absorber '' is given to features greater than @xmath13 significance ( penton et al .",
    "table 1 lists the identified absorption features and their equivalent widths .",
    "we see the expected galactic interstellar lines of s  ii @xmath65 and si  ii @xmath66 , as well as a high - velocity cloud in si  ii at @xmath67 km  s@xmath2 , which was also seen in c  iv at @xmath68 km  s@xmath2   by sembach et al .",
    "we also confirm the strong intergalactic ly@xmath0  absorbers near 17,000 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "a blowup of the 12781292   region shows that many of the ly@xmath0  lines have velocity substructure , which we model as separate gaussian components .",
    "we included these additional components to reduce the @xmath69 per degree of freedom whenever the resulting components were above @xmath13 significance . in no case",
    "did we allow more than two components per blended absorption feature , although we occasionally tested for three .",
    "in addition to the definite ly@xmath0  absorbers , we found a number of features at the @xmath70 level that might be verified with future stis data .",
    "examples of these `` possible features '' occur at 1229.0 , 1243.2 , 1249.5 , 1264.8 , 1286.45 , and 1290.58  .",
    "the local continua are uncertain near these features , and some of the features are too broad ( @xmath71 km  s@xmath2 ) to be discrete ly@xmath0  absorbers by our criteria . in these cases , we have decided to be conservative and not classify them as definite .",
    "we also analyzed an archival spectrum ( fig .",
    "2 ) taken with the ghrs / g160 m using pre - costar optics .",
    "this spectrum was reduced and analyzed in a manner identical to that in figure 1 , with the wavelength scale zero point set to the lsr using the galactic interstellar s  ii lines at 1250.584 and 1253.811  .",
    "between 1223 and 1258  , we detect 7 definite ly@xmath0  lines and three galactic interstellar lines : the two s  ii resonance lines and the weak mg  ii doublet .",
    "the strong ly@xmath0  feature at 1236   is easily detected and is resolved into two subcomponents separated by @xmath72 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "this pair of lines , at @xmath73 and 5121 km  s@xmath2 , lies at the same velocity as the h  i detected galaxy at @xmath74 , @xmath75 just off the eastern edge of figure 3 and discussed in detail by van gorkom et al .",

    "we identify this line as ly@xmath0  because of the slight wavelength offset and what would be an unusual strength for n  v. based on the absence of the weaker line of the n  v doublet at 1242.804   , we believe that n  v @xmath77 contributes at most 30% ( at the @xmath13 level ) to the equivalent width of the ly@xmath0  feature at 1238.744  .",
    "the pks  2155 - 304  sightline appears to be unusual , both in the number of ly@xmath0   absorbers and in their strength . in total , from 1223  1293  , we identify 14 ly@xmath0  absorbers with significance greater than @xmath78 . with a correction for regions blocked by galactic s  ii and",
    "si  ii , these 14 ly@xmath0  absorbers correspond to an uncorrected frequency @xmath79 above 21 m  ( n@xmath80 @xmath6 ) , for n@xmath81 @xmath6 .",
    "this frequency is somewhat higher than the mean value , to similar absorption strength , in sightlines studied with the ghrs during cycles 2 and 4 ( shull et al .",
    "1996 ) . probably the most unusual aspect of this sightline , however , is the large number of strong ly@xmath0  absorbers near 17,000 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "the strong correspondence in recession velocity between these ly@xmath0  absorbers and the surrounding galaxies argues that these clouds are not ejected from the bl  lac object .",
    "rather , they appear to be intervening clouds at distances given by the hubble law , @xmath82 , as we assume throughout this paper .      our previous results ( van gorkom et al .",
    "1996 ) showed that two of the strongest ly@xmath0 absorbers found toward pks  2155 - 304 at 17,100 km  s@xmath2   are located within a loose group of galaxies .",
    "three galaxies were detected in h  i , two at the velocities of the absorbers , but no individual galaxy could be identified as being _ associated _ with the absorber .",
    "the high column densities observed in the absorbers suggested that there may be an extended component of intergalactic neutral gas .",
    "column densities n(h  i ) @xmath83 @xmath6 are rarely detected in emission ( van gorkom 1993 ) , and common lore suggests that it may be ionized by the intergalactic uv background .",
    "the ly@xmath0 results suggested that this group may be the ideal place to look for diffuse h  i at very low column densities .",
    "we therefore reobserved the group in hope of detecting a low surface brightness diffuse h  i component .",
    "the observations were made in 1996 may with the vla in the 1  km ( d ) array with an extended north arm ( 3  km ) to compensate for the low declination of the source .",
    "the total integration time was 40 hrs spread over 8 different runs .",
    "all observations were centered at the radio position of pks  2155 - 304 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 ( b1950 ) .",
    "we used a total bandwidth of 6.25 mhz centered at 16,880 km  s@xmath2 ; the usable velocity range is about 1300 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "on - line hanning smoothing was employed , after which every other channel was discarded , leaving a set of 31 independent channels and resulting in a velocity resolution of 46 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "the bl  lac object is a radio continuum source with a variable flux density .",
    "we measured a flux density of 0.45 jy at 1.4 ghz .",
    "extreme care was taken to properly calibrate the bandpass .",
    "every 25 minutes a bandpass calibration was done , and the bandpass solution for these individual scans was interpolated to do the correction . as a result ,",
    "our observations are limited by noise rather than by spectral dynamic range , which is better than 3000:1 .",
    "the u - v data for each of the 8 days were calibrated independently and inspected for interference and residual calibration errors .",
    "subsequently , the u - v data of all runs were combined .",
    "the continuum was subtracted by making a linear fit in frequency to the calibrated complex visibilities of the line free channels ( 2 - 5 and 23 - 25 ) .",
    "the resulting data were clipped at a level of 0.7 jy to remove man - made and solar interference .",
    "images were made using a taper that compromised between optimal surface brightness sensitivity and maximal sidelobe suppression ( using the task imagr in aips , with robustness factor 1 ) , resulting in a synthesized beam of @xmath86 .",
    "the rms noise in the channel images is 0.15 mjy beam@xmath2 .",
    "the instrumental parameters are summarized in table 2 .    to search for h  i , we imaged the entire primary beam ( @xmath87 ) . to calculate h  i masses",
    ", we use the luminosity distance ( sandage 1975 ) assuming that the group is at @xmath88 and using @xmath89 km  s@xmath2  mpc@xmath2 and @xmath90 .",
    "our 6 @xmath64 h  i mass limit in the center of the field is @xmath91 . at full resolution",
    ", the column density sensitivity is @xmath92 @xmath6 ( @xmath93 over 57 kpc @xmath94 34 kpc @xmath94 46 km  s@xmath2 ) .",
    "the data were smoothed spatially and in velocity down to a resolution @xmath95 , resulting in a detection limit of @xmath96 @xmath6 ( 5 @xmath64 over 126 kpc @xmath94 189 kpc @xmath94 92 km  s@xmath2 ) . owing to a lack of short spacings , the observations are much less sensitive to h  i emission that is completely smooth on scales larger than @xmath97 in a single 46 km  s@xmath2  velocity channel .",
    "these values are valid for the center of the field .",
    "farther from the center , they have to be corrected for the change in primary beam response .",
    "the primary beam pattern is roughly gaussian with a fwhm of @xmath98 , and the limits are a factor two worse @xmath97 from the field center .    the properties of the five galaxies detected in h  i are summarized in table 3 and shown in figure 3 .",
    "perhaps the most interesting result of these observations is what we do not find .",
    "we do not detect a faint intergalactic component in h  i , nor do we detect any diffuse extended h  i associated with the galaxies .",
    "compared to van gorkom et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , our new data are of much better quality and only show more clearly that the h  i emission is confined to the galaxies at column densities well above @xmath99 @xmath6 .",
    "in addition to the 3 galaxies detected in the previous observations , we detect to the southwest an s0 galaxy cataloged in the apm catalog ( loveday 1996 ) with a velocity range partly outside our band . we see h  i to the northwest at 16,375 km  s@xmath2 , moving toward the center of the galaxy at lower velocities .",
    "the lowest velocity where we have usable , though very noisy data , is at 16237 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "since this emission peaks only slightly to the northwest of the center , we infer that the systemic velocity of the galaxy must be about 16200 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "this galaxy was not detected in our previous observations , because in those data that velocity range was seriously affected by interference .",
    "the other new detection is a tiny dwarf galaxy to the east at 17,156 km  s@xmath2 . in the current data ,",
    "the galaxy only shows up in one channel , but at the 8 @xmath64 level .",
    "going back to our previous data , we found the dwarf just above the noise in our oldest data set ( and at the edge of the band there ) .",
    "those data were taken with 11 km  s@xmath2  velocity resolution , and the emission seems to cover about 60 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "an overlay of just the dwarf on the digitized poss is shown in figure 4 .",
    "a hint of some faint light ( @xmath100 ) can be seen on the blue poss image , but it is clear from the image that similar dwarfs could easily be missed optically . in h",
    "i the dwarf is just above our detection limit .",
    "although somewhat brighter galaxies with larger h  i masses could have been detected closer to the sightline , in fact none was seen ( fig .",
    "are we getting any closer to identifying galaxies associated with the ly@xmath0  absorption ?",
    "there are 3 galaxies with h  i emission in the range 16,900  17,100 km  s@xmath2 , the velocity of the deepest ly@xmath0  absorption .",
    "thus , in the first instance , it is not obvious that the absorption would be _ associated _ with any one of the galaxies . in our previous work ( van gorkom et al .",
    "1996 ) we noticed a curious phenomenon : in all cases , the ly@xmath0  absorption was at the systemic velocity of the closest galaxy . in the current , much improved , ly@xmath0  data we notice something even more curious : the two strong features at 17,100 km  s@xmath2and at 16,200 km",
    "s@xmath2  cover exactly the same velocity range as the h  i emission in the two nearest galaxies . in figure 3",
    "we show the total h  i emission contours overlaid on an optical image ( greyscale ) , and we also indicate for each galaxy the sense of rotation and velocity extent of the h  i emission . as in our previous data , there is no evidence for ly@xmath0corotating with the h  i disks .",
    "the broad widths of the ly@xmath0  absorbers in the current data is intriguing .",
    "it seems unlikely that the two strong absorbers are associated with their nearest galaxies only .",
    "if the width of the ly@xmath0  lines were to reflect the potential of the nearest galaxies , each would have a halo characterized by a flat rotation curve extending out to 400 and 500 kpc respectively .",
    "perhaps more likely , the widths could indicate that the clouds probe a group potential . in that scenario we may be viewing two groups along the line of sight , one centered at 17,100 km  s@xmath2 , the other at 16,200 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "the detection of 3 galaxies with systemic velocities close to 17,100 km  s@xmath2  makes it plausible that there is indeed a loose group at this velocity .",
    "our velocity coverage does not extend to sufficiently low velocities to make any statements about the presence of a group at 16,200 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "the combined hst and vla data suggest that the 17,000 km  s@xmath2   ly@xmath0  absorption lines arise in a group environment . between 16,100 and 18,100 km",
    "s@xmath2 , we observe 6 ly@xmath0  absorbers and four large ( vla ) galaxies at similar velocities .",
    "the velocity centroid and radial velocity dispersion of the four galaxies are @xmath101 km  s@xmath2  and @xmath102 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "the equivalent statistics for the 6 ly@xmath0  absorbers are @xmath103 km  s@xmath2  and @xmath104 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "the fact that the strongest ly@xmath0   absorbers ( 1284.484   and 1285.097  ) lie close to @xmath105 suggests that the center of the gravitational potential well may be centered at @xmath106 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "before we interpret the larger velocity dispersion of ly@xmath0  lines , it is worth noting that this galaxy group was observed in h  i emission with the vla over a more limited velocity range ( 16,283  17,571 km  s@xmath2 ) than the ly@xmath0  lines .",
    "the simplest interpretation of the data is that the absorbing gas arises in intragroup material stripped or blown out of the gas - rich galaxies .",
    "however , there is no direct evidence for this interpretation in the h  i emission data . nor are galaxy h  i halos expected to be this dense at such enormous radii ( dove & shull 1994 ) . combining the 740 km  s@xmath2  velocity dispersion of the 6 definite ly@xmath0  absorbers with the mean projected separation , @xmath107 mpc between the four galaxies , we obtain a virial mass estimate , @xmath108 the estimated velocity dispersion and size / mass scale are those of a modest group , less than the size of the virgo cluster .",
    "the mean distance of these galaxies at @xmath109 km  s@xmath2  is @xmath110 mpc or @xmath111 .",
    "the break in the standard luminosity function is @xmath112 or @xmath113 ( marzke et al . 1994 ) in the zwicky ( blue ) magnitude system .",
    "thus , an @xmath39 galaxy in this group would lie at @xmath114 . using two slightly brighter galaxies in the field for calibration of the src - j plate magnitudes ( lauberts & valentijn 1989 )",
    ", we have estimated b@xmath115 magnitudes for the five galaxies around pks  2155 - 304 . in terms of @xmath39 , they are : north ( @xmath116 ) , east ( @xmath117 ) , south ( @xmath118 ) , southwest ( @xmath119 ) , and dwarf ( @xmath120 ) .",
    "thus , three of the h  i galaxies have luminosities essentially at or above @xmath39 .",

    "1993 ) . since bl lac objects are routinely found in poor clusters ( wurtz et al .",
    "1997 ) , these five excess galaxies are likely to be associated with pks  2155 - 304 .    if we integrate a schechter luminosity function , @xmath127 , down to @xmath128 ( @xmath123 ) , we would expect between 3 and 10 times more galaxies , compared to those above @xmath129 and @xmath117 , respectively . scaling from the observed h  i galaxies above those limits",

    "we conclude that the 600 ev absorption must be produced elsewhere , probably within pks  2155 - 304 .    because the four bright galaxies are h  i - rich spirals , it is also possible that these galaxies are not bound , based upon recent spectroscopic work on similar galaxy groups ( mulchaey & zabludoff 1998 ; zabludoff & mulchaey 1998 ) .",
