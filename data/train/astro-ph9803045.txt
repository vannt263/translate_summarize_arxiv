    "consider an initially poisson distribution of particles that clusters gravitationally as the universe expands . in this paper , the initial poisson distribution",
    "will also be called the initial lagrangian distribution .",
    "as time passes , the particle distribution evolves , as , for example , tightly bound virialized clusters ( called halos , or dark matter halos , in this paper ) form .",
    "thus , the evolved distribution is different from the initial lagrangian distribution . in what follows",
    ", the evolved distribution will be called the eulerian distribution .",
    "the goal of this paper is to use the properties of the initial lagrangian distribution to derive a reasonable approximation to the form of the evolved eulerian distribution . in the absence of a model relating the two distributions",
    ", the only constraint is that required by mass conservation : the number of particles in the initial and evolved distributions is the same , so the average density , @xmath0 , in the two distributions must be the same . in",
    "what follows , quantities measured in the lagrangian space will have a subscript ` 0 ' , while those in eulerian space will not . in this notation",
    ", mass conservation implies that @xmath1 .",
    "studies of clustering from poisson initial conditions ( itoh , inagaki & saslaw 1993 and references therein ) show that when the initial , lagrangian distribution is poisson , then the evolved eulerian distribution is generalized poisson .",
    "this paper presents a model in which this is so .",
    "the model is consistent with three general hypotheses about the evolution of clustering .",
    "the first is the hypothesis that , in comoving coordinates , initially denser regions contract more rapidly than less dense regions , and that sufficiently underdense regions expand .",
    "the second assumption is that , as the universe evolves , the number of such expanding and contracting regions is conserved  only their comoving size changes .",
    "the third is that the influence of external tides on the evolution of such comoving regions can be neglected , if one is only interested in computing statistics such as the mass function of collapsed halos , or the distribution of counts in eulerian cells .",
    "there are no compelling physical arguments for any of these assumptions , and initial particle configurations which violate some or all of these assumptions are relatively easy to construct . that the model predicts a counts - in - cells distribution which is a reasonable approximation to that measured in the numerical simulations suggests that , at least for clustering from poisson initial conditions , these simple assumptions may also be reasonably accurate .",
    "since it plays a central role in this paper , various known properties of the generalized poisson distribution are summarized below .",
    "the generalized poisson distribution ( consul 1989 ) has the form @xmath2^{n-1 } { \\rm e}^{-\\bar n(1-b ) - nb}\\!. \\label{gpdf}\\ ] ] here @xmath3 is the probability that a cell of size @xmath4 placed randomly within a particle distribution contains exactly @xmath5 particles . if @xmath0 denotes the average density , then @xmath6 . in this paper @xmath7 , and , for reasons discussed below , it will be supposed that @xmath8 is not a function of @xmath4 .",
    "the case @xmath9 is the poisson distribution .",
    "equation  ( [ gpdf ] ) is a compound poisson distribution ( e.g. saslaw 1989 ) ; it arises if point sized clusters , called halos in the following , have a poisson spatial distribution , and the probability a randomly chosen halo contains exactly @xmath10 particles is @xmath11 this is the borel@xmath12 distribution ( borel 1942 ) . in this paper , equation  ( [ borel ] ) will be called the halo mass function .",
    "the generalized poisson distribution was first discovered in the astrophysical context by saslaw & hamilton ( 1984 ) ( also see sheth 1995a ) .",
    "it provides a good fit to the distribution of particle counts in randomly placed cells , provided the particle distributions have evolved , as a result of gravitational clustering , from an initially poisson distribution ( itoh , inagaki & saslaw 1993 and references therein ) .",
    "in fact , the fits are significantly improved if @xmath8 is allowed to increase to an asymptotic value as @xmath4 increases .",
    "this scale dependence is simply a consequence of relaxing the assumption that borel clusters are point sized , but still requiring that they have some finite size .",
    "the asymptotic value of @xmath8 is that which would have characterized the distribution , had the clusters been point sized ( sheth & saslaw 1994 ) .",
    "for this reason , the asymptotic value of @xmath8 is fundamental , and the point sized idealization useful .",
    "this paper is mainly concerned with the point sized idealization , so that , in what follows , @xmath8 is independent of @xmath4 .",
    "the point sized idealization is also motivated by the following observation . to a good approximation",
    ", the distribution of bound virialized halos in the numerical simulations is borel@xmath12 .",
    "thus , to a good approximation , clustering from poisson initial conditions evolves in such a way that , at all times , particles are bound up in borel@xmath12 halos , and , at the time when they first virialize , these halos have a poisson distribution .",
    "the evolution of clustering is parameterized by the time dependence of @xmath8 ; it is zero initially , and it increases as the universe expands ( zhan 1989 ; sheth 1995b and references therein ) .",
    "therefore , in the remainder of this paper , @xmath8 will be treated as a pseudo - time variable , and the borel@xmath12 distribution will often be called the halo mass function at the epoch @xmath8 .    as @xmath13 , most cells in the lagrangian and eulerian distributions will be empty .",
    "equation  ( [ gpdf ] ) shows that , in this limit , the probability that a cell is not empty is @xmath14 , and the probability that a non - empty cell contains exactly @xmath5 particles is given by the borel@xmath12 distribution . in other words , at the epoch @xmath8 , the halo mass function is the same as the vanishing - cell - size limit of the eulerian counts in cells distribution ( sheth 1996a ) .",
    "this fact will be useful later .",
    "the borel@xmath12 distribution can be derived from a number of different constructions , all of which are related to the poisson distribution ( epstein 1983 ; sheth 1995b ; sheth 1996b ; sheth & pitman 1997 ) . in the context of this paper , all these constructions",
    "can be thought of as providing models that allow one to compute the eulerian space distribution , in the limit of vanishing cell size , given that the lagrangian space distribution is poisson .",
    "one of these constructions , based on the statistics of random walk barrier crossings associated with the poisson distribution , is the excursion set model ( epstein 1983 ; sheth 1995b ) .",
    "this paper shows how to derive the generalized poisson distribution from a simple generalization of this excursion set model .",
    "the generalization shows how to derive the eulerian space generalized poisson distribution from the lagrangian space poisson distribution , for all cell sizes , and all times .",
    "section  [ const ] summarizes the random walk , excursion set model which leads to the borel@xmath12 distribution .",
    "sections  [ shift ] and  [ expdf ] describe a generalization of this model which leads to a new derivation of the generalized poisson distribution .",
    "section  [ halos ] shows how to describe the spatial distribution of virialized halos within the context of this model .",
    "it shows that the model is consistent with the compound poisson interpretation of the generalized poisson distribution  in the model , borel@xmath12 halos have a poisson distribution at the time when they first virialize .",
    "moreover , in the model , the @xmath13 limit of the counts - in - cells distribution is , indeed , the halo mass function .",
    "this shows explicitly that the excursion set approach developed here is able to reproduce the known properties of the generalized poisson distribution .",
    "the relation between this model and the well - studied spherical collapse model ( outlined in appendix  [ scoll ] ) is discussed in section  [ scm ] .",

    "section  [ twobar ] discusses the associated two barrier problem .",
    "the solution of this problem may provide useful diagnostics in assessing the rate of evolution of the eulerian statistics computed earlier in the paper .",
    "clustering from more general initial conditions , using the techniques developed here , is treated in a forthcoming paper .",
    "this section presents a new derivation of the generalized poisson distribution .",
    "the derivation uses a simple generalization of the excursion set model studied by epstein ( 1983 ) and sheth ( 1995b ) .",
    "suppose that the initial lagrangian distribution is poisson , with mean density @xmath0 .",
    "this means that a volume of size @xmath15 placed at a random position in this distribution will contain exactly @xmath5 particles with probability @xmath16 now choose a random particle of this distribution , and compute the density within concentric spheres centred on this position .",
    "call the curve @xmath17 traced out by the number of particles contained within a sphere @xmath15 centred on this particle , as a function of the sphere size @xmath15 , a trajectory . then each particle in the poisson distribution",
    "has its associated lagrangian trajectory . given @xmath18 , epstein ( 1983 ) derived an expression for the fraction of lagrangian trajectories for which @xmath19 , and for which @xmath20 for all @xmath21 ( also see sheth 1995b ; sheth & lemson 1998 ) .",
    "epstein argued that a given value of @xmath22 defines a series of volumes @xmath23 for which @xmath24 the final equality defines @xmath25 .",
    "the evolution of clustering enters through the time dependence of @xmath18 , which decreases as time increases .",
    "it is in this sense that @xmath8 is a pseudo - time variable ; it is 0 initially , and increases as the universe expands ( sheth 1995b ) .",
    "epstein showed that the fraction of trajectories @xmath26 for which @xmath27 is the largest value of @xmath15 at which @xmath28 is @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the borel@xmath12 distribution defined earlier .",
    "the mean of the borel@xmath12 distribution is @xmath31 , a fact which will be useful later .    since @xmath26 is a statement about the last crossing of the barrier ( the dashed line that intersects the origin in fig .",
    "[ trajec ] ) by the random walk , excursion set trajectories , it will sometimes be referred to as the barrier crossing distribution .",
    "the subscript ` c ' here denotes the fact that this is the distribution of last crossings of a constant boundary ; that is , @xmath18 is independent of @xmath15 .",
    "let @xmath32 denote the fraction of trajectories for which @xmath27 is the largest value of @xmath15 at which @xmath33 , given that , at some @xmath34 they have value @xmath35 , with @xmath36 , and that all @xmath37 are less dense than @xmath38",
    ". then @xmath39 ( sheth 1995b ) .",
    "it is usual to associate these expressions about the statistics of trajectories crossing a constant barrier with statements about the number density of collapsed ( point  sized ) halos .",
    "thus , the average number density of @xmath40-halos that contain exactly @xmath41 particles is @xmath42 this assignment comes from assuming that the fraction of trajectories @xmath26 can be equated to the fraction of the lagrangian space associated with regions containing @xmath41 particles with overdensity @xmath40 .",
    "the final equality comes from equation  ( [ fjb ] ) and using the fact that @xmath43 .",
    "similarly , the average number of @xmath44-halos that are within an @xmath45-halo is @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath36 .",
    "if the trajectories are not centred on particles , then the barrier crossing distribution is @xmath48 and @xmath49 however , the number density of associated regions is the same as before ( sheth & lemson 1998 ) .",
    "consider an @xmath45-halo that is known to contain @xmath50 @xmath40 subhalos , of which @xmath51 are singles , @xmath52 are doubles and so on .",
    "thus , @xmath53 , and mass conservation requires that @xmath54 . of course , @xmath55 . let @xmath56 $ ] denote one particular partition of @xmath5 , where @xmath57 denotes the vector @xmath58 , and let @xmath59 denote the probability that the partition @xmath56 $ ] occured",
    ". sheth ( 1996b ) shows that @xmath60 where @xmath61 , and @xmath62 , is consistent with the excursion set model described above ( also see sheth & pitman 1997 , sheth & lemson 1998 ) .",
    "for example , the average number of @xmath44-halos that are within @xmath45-halos is @xmath63}\\!\\ !",
    "n_j\\,p({\\bmath n};b_1|n;b_2 ) =   { \\cal n}(j , b_1|n , b_2 ) , \\label{meanj}\\ ] ] and the sum is over the set of all distinct ordered partitions of @xmath5 .",
    "the final expression is the same as equation  ( [ nj1k2 ] ) as required ; the algebra leading to it is given in appendix b of sheth ( 1996b ) .",
    "the correlation between @xmath64- and @xmath44-halos that are within the same @xmath45-halo is computed by a similar average over all partitions of @xmath5 .",
    "thus , @xmath65 where @xmath66 ( sheth 1996b ) .",
    "this expression reflects the fact that , in the lagrangian poisson distribution , non - overlapping volumes are mutually independent ( sheth & lemson 1998 ) .",
    "these expressions will be useful later .",
    "this subsection shows how the statistics of the initial lagrangian distribution can be used to derive some useful information about the statistics of collapsed halos , and of the distribution of halos within halos . while the language of halos is useful , it is important to remember that an @xmath45-halo can also be thought of as a lagrangian region of size @xmath67 ( mo & white 1996 ) .",
    "thus , expressions like  ( [ ninj ] ) are related to the average number of @xmath64- and @xmath44-halos that are both within the same lagrangian region of size @xmath38 .",
    "it is in this sense that many of the expressions above will be interpretted later in this paper .",
    "the previous subsection considered the distribution of last crossings , by random walk trajectories associated with the poisson distribution , of a barrier which had shape @xmath68 . instead , suppose that @xmath69 and we seek an expression for the fraction of trajectories @xmath70 for which @xmath27 is the largest value of @xmath15 at which @xmath71 .",
    "this is equivalent to considering the same problem as before , but with the barrier shifted to the right by a constant @xmath72 ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "to compute @xmath70 , start with an arbitrarily small sphere centred on a particle . since the distribution is poisson , counts in different volumes are independent , so @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the poisson distribution of equation  ( [ pois ] ) , with @xmath27 given by equation  ( [ newvj ] ) , and @xmath75 denotes the probability that no sphere larger than and concentric to @xmath27 is denser than the threshold value",
    "now , @xmath75 is the same as one minus the probability that @xmath38 is the largest volume denser than the threshold value , summed over all @xmath47 . as a consequence of the poisson assumption ,",
    "@xmath76 is independent of @xmath5 , so it can be written as @xmath77 ( e.g. epstein 1983 ) .",
    "this means that @xmath78 since @xmath79=(n - j)b$ ] , setting @xmath80 means that the sum above is simply @xmath81 the final expression follows from recognizing that the term in the sum is @xmath82 times the borel@xmath12 distribution .",
    "this implies that @xmath83 so that @xmath84 this is the barrier crossing distribution associated with the shifted barrier .",
    "following equation  ( [ njfj ] ) , this barrier crossing distribution can be associated with a number density of lagrangian regions which contain @xmath5 particles : @xmath85    let @xmath86 denote the barrier crossing distribution if the trajectory is centred on a random position , not necessarily on a particle .",
    "then @xmath87 the number density of associated regions , @xmath88 , is related to this fraction analogously to how it is related to @xmath89 .",
    "namely , the barrier crossing distribution should be weighted by the number of trajectories associated with it , so @xmath88 is @xmath86 times the ratio of the average density @xmath0 to @xmath90 , so it is given by equation  ( [ nlgrng ] ) .",
    "imagine partitioning the eulerian space @xmath91 containing @xmath92 particles into a large number of cells , each of size @xmath4 .",
    "then the total number of such cells is @xmath93",
    ". we will be interested in the limit in which @xmath94 as both @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "let @xmath97 denote the fraction of these cells that contain exactly @xmath5 particles .",
    "if @xmath98 denotes the number of cells containing exactly @xmath5 particles , then @xmath99 is said to be the eulerian counts - in - cells distribution .",
    "suppose that @xmath0 and @xmath91 in the lagrangian and eulerian spaces are the same",
    ". then @xmath100 .",
    "further , suppose that the number of regions which contain a specified number of particles is the same in both the lagrangian and the eulerian spaces .",
    "finally , suppose that the parameter @xmath72 , which controlled the shape of the barrier of the previous subsection , can be related to the eulerian cell size @xmath4 .",
    "then equation  ( [ nlgrng ] ) requires that @xmath101 so that @xmath102 equation  ( [ fspd ] ) provides a relation between the barrier crossing distribution @xmath103 , which itself depends on the shape of the boundary and the initial lagrangian field , and the eulerian counts - in - cells distribution . by hypothesis , the shape of the boundary depends on the eulerian scale @xmath4 , so a given relation between @xmath72 and @xmath4 implies a specific form for the evolution of the comoving sizes of regions .",
    "this is discussed in more detail in section  [ scm ] .",
    "physically , equation  ( [ fspd ] ) is consistent with the assumption that the difference between the particle distribution in the initial ( lagrangian ) and final ( eulerian ) spaces arises solely as a consequence of the fact that , although the comoving sizes of regions may change , the number of expanding and contracting regions in the two spaces is conserved .",
    "let @xmath104 .",
    "then , @xmath105 is the probability distribution function of the density in eulerian space , and @xmath106    following equation  ( [ fspd ] ) , equation  ( [ fnb ] ) has an associated eulerian counts in cells distribution : @xmath107 where @xmath108 .",
    "this is the generalized poisson distribution ( equation  [ gpdf ] ) .",
    "normalization to unity requires that @xmath109 so the variance is @xmath110 , and this distribution is the same as that in equation  ( [ gpdf ] ) .",
    "equation  ( [ betab ] ) shows how the parameter @xmath72 is related to the eulerian cell size @xmath4 . in particular , notice that as @xmath13 , then the barrier is shifted by @xmath111 , so , in this limit , the barrier shape is the same as that in section  [ const ] .",
    "this shows explicitly that , as @xmath13 , the eulerian counts in cells distribution is the same as the halo mass function .",
    "recall that the generalized poisson distribution with parameter @xmath8 can be interpretted as arising from a poisson distribution of borel@xmath12 halos .",
    "this subsection shows that the derivation of the generalized poisson distribution presented earlier is consistent with this interpretation .",
    "[ trajec ] shows that the fraction of trajectories which last cross the constant barrier , parameterized by @xmath40 , at @xmath41 is equal to the fraction of those trajectories which last crossed the shifted barrier ( associated with the eulerian scale @xmath4 and parameter @xmath112 ) at @xmath47 , that had their last crossing of the constant barrier at @xmath41 , summed over all @xmath47 .",
    "a little algebra shows that @xmath113 where @xmath26 and @xmath114 are given by equations  ( [ fjb ] ) and  ( [ fjk ] ) , and @xmath115 , as required by equation  ( [ newvj ] ) .",
    "this relation implies that @xmath116 where the final expression is @xmath4 times equation  ( [ njfj ] ) , and follows from setting @xmath117 .",
    "there are two reasons for writing this calculation out in detail .",
    "the first is simply to show explicitly that the mean number density of @xmath44-halos in the eulerian space is the same as in the lagrangian space , as required .",
    "the second is that it shows how statistics in the lagrangian space can be used to compute statistics in the eulerian space .",
    "recall that the number of regions containing @xmath5 particles is the same in both spaces , though the sizes @xmath15 and @xmath4 of the regions may be different . in particular , the lagrangian scale associated with an eulerian region of size @xmath4",
    "depends on the number of particles @xmath5 within it : @xmath118 ( equation  [ newvj ] ) .",
    "so , to compute averages over eulerian cells @xmath4 , one simply needs to sum over the relevant lagrangian regions @xmath38 that now have eulerian scale @xmath4 , and weight by the eulerian probability @xmath97 that the eulerian region @xmath4 contains @xmath5 particles .",
    "thus , the cross - correlation between halos and mass , averaged over eulerian cells @xmath4 , can be computed as follows .",
    "define @xmath119 this is the number of @xmath44-halos that are within lagrangian regions of size @xmath120 and which contain exactly @xmath5 particles , divided by the average number of @xmath44-halos that are within eulerian volumes of size @xmath4 , minus one . by hypothesis , the number of such lagrangian regions is constant , only their size has changed .",
    "however , if we now require that @xmath121 , then this means that the eulerian size of such a lagrangian region is @xmath4 .",
    "so , if we require that @xmath121 , then equation  ( [ dhmow ] ) is the number of @xmath44-halos in eulerian cells @xmath4 that contain exactly @xmath5 particles , relative to the average number of @xmath44-halos in eulerian cells @xmath4 , minus one .",
    "the cross correlation function between @xmath44-halos and mass , averaged over all eulerian cells @xmath4 , is @xmath122 , with @xmath123 , times @xmath124 times the probability that an eulerian region @xmath4 contains exactly @xmath5 particles , summed over all @xmath5 .",
    "thus , @xmath125 where @xmath126 is given by equation  ( [ nj1k2 ] ) , @xmath127 by equation  ( [ same ] ) , and @xmath128 by equation  ( [ gpd ] ) .",
    "the second line follows from equation  ( [ dhmow ] ) , and the fact that @xmath129 ( equation  [ norm ] ) , so @xmath130 .",
    "the third line follows from equations  ( [ njfj ] ) , ( [ nj1k2 ] ) and  ( [ fspd ] ) , and the last line from doing the sum , after using the fact that @xmath131 . notice that when @xmath132 then @xmath133 .",
    "the correlation between @xmath40-halos of mass @xmath134 and @xmath41 , averaged over eulerian cells @xmath4 , arises as a result of two averages .",
    "the first is over all possible ways the @xmath5 particles in an eulerian cell @xmath4 could have been partitioned into @xmath40-halos , and the second is over all possible values of @xmath5 .",
    "the assumption that an eulerian cell @xmath4 is simply a lagrangian region that has changed size allows us to assume that the first average ( over all partitions of @xmath5 ) is the same in the two spaces .",
    "so , the result of this average is @xmath135 of equation  ( [ ninj ] ) , provided we set @xmath121 .",
    "all that remains is to average this quantity over @xmath5 , and then divide out the factors expected on average .",
    "thus , @xmath136 where @xmath137 this sum can be solved analytically : @xmath138    when @xmath132 , @xmath139 , for all @xmath140 , and @xmath4 , which implies that the halos have a poisson distribution .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that equation  ( [ gpd ] ) is a compound poisson distribution which arises if borel@xmath12 clusters have a poisson spatial distribution ( saslaw 1989 ; sheth & saslaw 1994 ) .",
    "when @xmath141 , then all halos are single particles , so @xmath142 , and this expression gives the second factorial moment of the single particle distribution .",
    "simple algebra shows that , in this limit , it is equal to the second factorial moment of equation  ( [ gpd ] ) . further , notice that when @xmath143 , then correlations between halos only depend on the sum of the halo masses , not on the masses of the individual halos themselves .",
    "this suggests that , in this model , halo - halo correlations arise because of volume exclusion effects only .",
    "that is , halo - halo correlations arise only because , initially , a @xmath44-halo occupies a region @xmath144 , so no other halos can occupy this region . as time passes , such an object collapses to a region of zero eulerian size , so the volume excluded by it becomes negligibly small .      in the spherical poisson model , @xmath8",
    "is related to the critical overdensity required for collapse : @xmath25 ( equation  [ vj ] ) .",
    "this relation for @xmath8 , with equation  ( [ betab ] ) for @xmath72 and equation  ( [ newvj ] ) , imply that , as @xmath5 changes , the height relative to the average density of the shifted barrier considered here is @xmath145 when @xmath146 , and @xmath147 , then @xmath148 and @xmath149 , so @xmath150 in this limit , the relation between @xmath151 and @xmath152 is independent of @xmath4 .",
    "this relation should be compared with that for the spherical collapse model given in appendix  [ scoll ] .    in the limits @xmath148 and @xmath147 , equation  ( [ linbar ] ) suggests the following model for the collapse of objects .",
    "let @xmath153 denote the comoving size of an object at the epoch @xmath154 .",
    "then @xmath155 initially .",
    "if the object is in an underdense region , then its comoving size will increase , else it will decrease . trajectories with extrapolated linear overdensity @xmath151 greater than @xmath18 are associated with collapsed objects .",
    "collapsed objects have @xmath156 . until collapse @xmath157",
    "the radius of an object in proper , physical coordinates is @xmath158 .",
    "objects which collapse have a turnaround radius  the maximum value that @xmath159 attains .",
    "this occurs at @xmath160 at which time @xmath161 figure  [ rphys ] shows that , for overdense perturbations , turnaround in this model ( dashed lines ) occurs later , and at a larger radius , than in the spherical model ( solid lines ) .",
    "in contrast , underdense regions expand less rapidly in this model than in the spherical model .",
    "the excursion set problem studied above can be understood in terms of a simple queue system . a single server queue with deterministic service time @xmath162 and poisson arrivals with unit mean , which starts with one customer at the initial time ,",
    "can be expressed in terms of the random walk problem studied by epstein ( 1983 ) and sheth ( 1995b ) .",
    "the time parameter in the queue system is like the cell size parameter in the excursion set model .",
    "consider the probability @xmath163 that , after exactly @xmath41 customers have been served , the queue is empty for the first time",
    ". then @xmath164 of equation  ( [ fjb ] ) is @xmath41 times this probability times @xmath165 .",
    "the @xmath165 factor simply comes from the additional constraint in the excursion problem on the number of particles within volumes larger than the critical volume @xmath27 .",
    "this constraint is not present in the queue model , since we have made no assumption about what happens in the queue after the end of the first busy period .",
    "figure  [ trajec ] shows clearly that the same queue system , started with @xmath50 customers at the initial time , is related to the excursion set problem studied in the previous section .",
    "let @xmath166 denote the probability that exactly @xmath5 customers were served in the first busy period , given that there were exactly @xmath50 customers in the queue initially .",

    "the excursion set probability @xmath89 of equation  ( [ fnb ] ) is the same as the probability that there were exactly @xmath50 customers at the start , times @xmath170 , times @xmath165 , summed over all possible values of @xmath50 . in the excursion set problem ,",
    "the probability that there are exactly @xmath50 customers at the start is simply @xmath171 ( figure  [ trajec ] ) , so that @xmath172 appendix  d of sheth ( 1996b ) shows that the right hand side of this expression is the same as that on the right hand side equation  ( [ fnb ] ) .",
    "the corresponding expression for trajectories not necessarily centred on a particle , @xmath86 , can also be derived in this context .",

    "sheth ( 1996b ) discusses a branching process derivation of this formula .",

    "this subsection extends the results of sheth ( 1995b ) , section  3 , for a constant barrier to the shifted barrier considered in this paper . in particular",
    ", it shows that the shifted barrier problem has a scaling solution that is analogous to the one associated with the constant barrier .",

    "the second term is obtained by noting that the argument leading to equation  ( [ fext ] ) holds here also .",
    "therefore , when @xmath178 is the generalized poisson distribution with parameter @xmath179 , and @xmath177 is given by equation  ( [ newvj ] ) , i.e. , @xmath180 then @xmath181 is given by an expression like  ( [ fe ] ) but with @xmath182 replaced by @xmath183 .",

    "recall that the generalized poisson distribution with parameter @xmath179 can be understood as describing a poisson distribution of point ",
    "sized clusters , where @xmath189 , the probability that a randomly chosen cluster contains exactly @xmath50 particles is the borel@xmath190 distribution .",

    "since @xmath8 is a pseudo - time variable , the new definition of @xmath198 simply means that the time parameter in this model is slightly different from that in the case of poisson initial conditions . in other words , if the initial lagrangian distribution is generalized poisson , rather than poisson , then , except for the appropriate rescalings of the time - dependent parameters , none of the results of section  2 are changed .",

    "that are not necessarily centred on particles , the expression corresponding to equation  ( [ fj1k0 ] ) is @xmath220 when @xmath202 , and @xmath221 is related to @xmath222 similarly .",
    "these expressions follow from arguments given in sheth & lemson ( 1998 ) .",
    "identities associated with abel s generalization of the binomial theorem show that all these expressions are normalized to unity .",
    "this last expression is related to the following problem .",

    "this paper presents a new derivation of the generalized poisson distribution .",
    "the derivation allows one to construct a useful model of hierarchical clustering from poisson initial conditions .",
    "the resulting model is useful because the poisson assumption allows one to solve many problems that , at present , have no solution if more realistic initial conditions are used .",
    "the model is a simple generalization of the excursion set model developed by bond et al .",
    "their approach allows one to estimate the mass function of collapsed halos ; the generalization presented here allows one to describe the spatial distribution of these halos as well .",
    "the model can also be thought of as a simple variant of the spherical collapse model . in the model ,",
    "initially denser regions contract more rapidly than less dense regions , sufficiently underdense regions expand , the influence of external tides on the evolution of such regions is ignored , and the number of expanding and contracting regions is assumed to be conserved . strictly speaking , none of these assumptions can be justified physically .",
    "however , these simplifications mean that the model can be worked out relatively easily . moreover , the generalized poisson distribution , derived after making these assumptions , is a reasonably accurate fit to the eulerian counts - in - cells distribution measured in numerical simulations of clustering from poisson initial conditions .",
    "this suggests that , at least for estimating the evolution of the counts - in - cells statistic from such initial conditions , these simplifications are justified .    in the model ,",
    "a collapsed halo occupies a vanishingly small volume . in the simulations ,",
    "collapsed halos have non - zero sizes  any given halo virializes at some fraction , typically about one half , of its turnaround radius .",
    "this means that on scales smaller than that of a typical halo , the counts - in - cells distribution computed here will cease to be a good approximation to that measured in the simulations . as discussed in the introduction",
    ", the fact that halos have non - trivial density profiles means that the @xmath8 parameter in equation  ( [ gpdf ] ) depends on scale . a reasonable approximation to the effects of this scale dependence can be computed from models , such as those proposed by navarro , frenk & white ( 1996 ) , of the density profiles of collapsed halos ( see sheth & saslaw 1994 for details ) . as poisson initial conditions are not realistic anyway",
    ", this seems an unnecessary refinement to an already idealized model .    as the basic model has worked out",
    "so easily , as it allows one to estimate the extent to which halos are biased tracers of the mass , and , most importantly , as it provides a reasonably accurate description of the evolution of clustering measured in numerical simulations , it seems worth extending it to describe clustering from more general initial conditions .",
