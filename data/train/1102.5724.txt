    "in recent years , the number of wireless devices has skyrocketed and , to handle the demands of ever richer multimedia applications , these devices have required higher and higher data rates .",
    "these trends , coupled with the scarcity of spectrum , imply that interference between devices will be one of the dominant bottlenecks in wireless networking for many years to come . in some cases ,",
    "this interference is purely an obstacle to reliable communication .",
    "however , in many scenarios , it is actually possible to harness interference to enable more efficient communication over a network . in this survey",
    ", we examine a set of novel strategies geared at exploiting wireless interference for reliable network coding .",
    "nodes in a network occupy one or more of the following roles : sources transmit information packets into the network , destinations are interested in recovering a set of information packets , and relays help move information between sources and destinations . in a wired network , he classical approach is to have relays forward a subset of their observed packets towards the intended destinations . for a wired network with a single source , multiple relays , and a single destination ,",
    "this routing strategy is optimal @xcite .",
    "more generally , routing can not attain the maximum throughput and relays may need to send out functions of the packets they observe , rather than just repeating them .",
    "this _ network coding _",
    "strategy was originally developed by ahlswede _",
    "et al . _ for optimal multicasting over wired networks",
    "@xcite and has turned out to be quite useful for a wide array of networking scenarios .",
    "much of this research has focused on _ linear _ network coding strategies , where the functions are assumed to be linear combinations of the packets , taken over an appropriate finite field @xcite .    in a wireless setting , transmitting a packet from one node to another",
    "naturally causes interference to all nearby nodes .",
    "if multiple nodes transmit concurrently , their waveforms are linearly superimposed which makes it harder for a receiver to recover its desired packets . yet , for network coding , relays do not need to recover the contents of individual packets , only an appropriate functions thereof . in this overview",
    ", we will look at physical layer modulation and coding techniques that can harness the linear nature of wireless interference for linear network coding . if the relays can transmit in a fully analog fashion",
    ", one possible approach is to have them repeat their observed noisy linear combinations directly .",
    "while this has favorable properties when the signal - to - noise ratio is high enough , it is clear that the ensuing end - to - end noise accumulation is highly undesirable .",
    "a more interesting question is thus whether the noise can be removed at each stage by appropriate error - correcting codes .",
    "this is what we will refer to as _ reliable physical layer network coding _ in this paper .",
    "interestingly , an initial information - theoretic analysis might suggest that such coding is not feasible and instead , relays must first decode the individual packets .",
    "in other words , attempting to directly decode only a linear combination of the messages will implicitly also reveal the individual messages , and thus , not be any more efficient than the standard approach .",
    "fortunately , this initial attempt is too pessimistic .",
    "the key insight is that the modulation and coding strategies should share a common _ algebraic structure _ across transmitters .",
    "more precisely , if the transmitted waveforms are points of a lattice , then every integer combination of these waveforms is itself a point of the same lattice .",
    "therefore , receivers can efficiently decode these linear combinations with the same framework used to decode individual packets .",
    "how efficiently , depends on how closely the coefficients of the desired linear combination match the observed channel strengths and phases .",
    "reliable physical layer network coding thus involves two complementary questions : _",
    "( i ) , _ how to enable encoders and decoders to exploit interfering signals for efficient function computation , and _ ( ii ) , _ at the network level , which functions to select in order to enable efficient overall information transfer .",
    "as we will demonstrate , existing modulation techniques and linear error - correcting codes can serve as building blocks for these new encoders and decoders .",
    "information can be encoded digitally into packets at the transmitter side and decoded directly into a linear combination of packets at the receiver side .",
    "we will illustrate the basic ideas behind this new approach starting with very simple examples and gradually incorporating many of the aspects of wireless channels . in keeping with the survey nature of this paper",
    ", we will point to relevant papers in the literature along the way .",
    "consider a network of several nodes , some of which are linked together by wired connections .",
    "if one node wishes to send a message to another node in the network , then it is optimal to simply route the information towards its destination : intermediate nodes should simply retransmit their received packets .",
    "this strategy can achieve the _ unicast capacity _ of a network which is given by the max - flow min - cut theorem , as shown independently by ford and fulkerson @xcite and elias , feinstein , and shannon @xcite . now",
    ", suppose that more than one destination wants the transmitted message .",
    "the seminal paper of ahlswede _ et al . _ demonstrated that routing is insufficient for this problem and network coding is , in general , required to achieve the _ multicast capacity _ @xcite .",
    "the key principle underlying network coding is that intermediate nodes should send out functions of their received packets , instead of the packets themselves .",
    "subsequent work by li , cai , and yeung @xcite and ktter and mdard @xcite made the important observation that , for multicasting , intermediate nodes can simply send out a linear combination of their received packets .",
    "there is now a wealth of literature on the myriad applications of network coding to sending information over networks and beyond .",
    "a comprehensive literature survey is beyond the scope of this paper and we refer the interested reader to the other papers in this issue as well as to several books on the subject @xcite .",
    "for the purpose of our exposition and to make the ideas behind physical layer network coding apparent , we need to develop network coding slightly more formally here .",
    "in particular , we will consider operations on a finite field , i.e. , a set of @xmath0 elements that we will denote without loss of generality by @xmath1 for ease of exposition , we will assume that @xmath0 is a prime number so that addition and multiplication over the finite field can be written as modulo addition and multiplication over the reals .",
    "for any two integers @xmath2 and @xmath3 in this set , we will denote addition and multiplication modulo-@xmath0 as @xmath4 \\modq \\\\ a \\otimes b & = [ a b ] \\modq \\ . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we will work with the algebraic network coding framework introduced in @xcite .",
    "the transmitting terminal has a message which can be represented as a string of bits .",
    "this message can be broken up into several packets each of which can be written as a length-@xmath5 vector of elements from the finite field which we will denote by @xmath6 .",
    "say an intermediate node ( or relay ) in a network has received some of these packets @xmath7 .",
    "the node s role in a network coding solution is to send a linear combination @xmath8 of these packets towards the destination : @xmath9 where @xmath10 are coefficients over the finite field .",
    "the goal is for each destination to collect enough linear combinations to infer the original packets .",
    "assume that a destination has successfully received linear combinations @xmath11 where @xmath12 then , it can solve for the original packets if the matrix of coefficients @xmath13\\end{aligned}\\]]has rank @xmath14 . since we would like all destinations to recover the message , we must choose the network coding coefficients at each relay so that the matrix of coefficients at each receiver is full rank .",
    "_ developed an efficient algorithm that can find a feasible set of coefficients in polynomial time so long as the field size @xmath0 is larger than the number of receivers @xcite .",
    "another powerful approach advocated by ktter and mdard as well as ho _",
    "is to generate the coefficients randomly at each relay @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that the probability that this yields a valid solution increases with the field size .",
    "it is also instructive to note that within this framework , the routing solution corresponds to having the intermediate node retransmit one of its received packets , @xmath15 during each time slot .",
    "we now introduce a simple network , _ the two - way relay channel _ , that will serve as a guiding example and benchmark for all of the strategies in the sequel . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", this example first appeared in a paper by wu , chou , and kung in 2004 @xcite .",
    "as shown in figure [ f : twowayrelay ] , there are two users that wish to exchange messages with each other . however , in this model , we assume that each user can not hear the other user s transmission . instead , the users must communicate with the help of a relay node `` in the middle '' that can receive from and transmit to both users .",
    "the users share the same frequency band so , if both users transmit simultaneously , the relay will observe a superposition of the two signals corrupted by noise .",
    "this interference effect can be modeled by a _",
    "multiple - access channel _ with inputs @xmath16 and @xmath17 and output @xmath18 .",
    "each user @xmath19 generates its channel input @xmath20 from its message @xmath21 and the channel output @xmath22 is observed by the relay ( see figure [ f : twowaychanmodel ] ) .",
    "conversely , any transmission by the relay will be heard by both users .",
    "this broadcast effect can be modeled by a _ broadcast channel _ with input @xmath23 and outputs @xmath22 and @xmath24 .",
    "these two channel models have been studied in depth over the past few decades . from an information - theoretic perspective , the capacity region for sending messages over a multiple - access channel has been completely characterized @xcite .",
    "the capacity region of the broadcast channel is also known if the channel is `` stochastically degraded '' @xcite .",
    "this condition holds for the wireless channel models considered in this paper .",
    "we will not delve into the subtleties of these capacity results and refer the interested reader to @xcite for more details . roughly speaking , these results tell us that for wireless multiple - access and broadcast channels at symmetric operating points , each user can attain a rate inversely proportional to the number of active users .",
    "for the two - way relay channel , this means that sending two messages to the relay takes approximately twice as much time as sending one message .",
    "similarly , sending two different messages from the relay to two destinations takes twice as much time as sending one message to one destination .",
    "we make the natural assumption that each terminal must operate in half - duplex mode ( i.e. it can either send or receive during a single time slot but not both ) . from this",
    ", we get that combining standard physical layer coding ideas with routing allows both users to exchange messages over the two - way relay channel in @xmath25 time slots .",
    "we illustrate how this can be done in figure [ f : twowayrouting ] .",
    "each user takes a time slot to send its message to the relay and the relay takes two time slots to send these messages to their destinations .",
    "time slots .",
    "( a ) during the first time slot , user @xmath26 sends its message @xmath27 to the relay .",
    "( b ) during the second time slot , user @xmath28 sends its message @xmath29 to the relay .",
    "( c ) during the third time slot , the relay sends the message @xmath27 to user @xmath28 .",
    "( d ) during the fourth time slot , the relay sends the message @xmath29 to user @xmath26 .",
    ", width=312 ]    this performance can be significantly improved through the use of network coding @xcite . once the relay has collected @xmath27 and @xmath29 ( after two time slots )",
    "it can easily compute the modulo-@xmath28 sum of the messages @xmath30 . in the next time slot",
    ", it can broadcast the sum to both users .",
    "each user can then infer its desired message from the sum and its original message .",
    "this network coding strategy thus allows the users to exchange messages in only @xmath31 time slots as shown in figure [ f : twowaynetcod ] .",
    "this gain is not in conflict with the capacity region of the broadcast channel as the relay only needs to send out one common message rather than two distinct messages .",
    "broadcasting a common message is limited by the weakest channel from the relay to a single user .",
    "we also note that in general , it is not optimal to send a common message comprised of the _ sum _ of the bits @xcite , but , for the channel models we will consider , it will suffice .",
    "time slots .",
    "( a ) during the first time slot , user @xmath26 sends its message @xmath27 to the relay .",
    "( b ) during the second time slot , user @xmath28 sends its message @xmath29 to the relay .",
    "( c ) during the third time slot , the relay sends the sum of the messages @xmath30 to both users . , width=312 ]    the two - way relay channel is just one of the many scenarios where the broadcast property of the wireless medium can be exploited via network coding .",
    "this behavior has been thoroughly investigated theoretically @xcite and demonstrated in practice @xcite .",
    "now that we know it is more efficient for the relay to send the sum of the messages during the broadcast phase , it is natural to ask whether savings are also possible during the multiple - access phase .",
    "since the relay only needs the sum , we could do even better by conveying the sum to the relay without identifying the individual messages .",
    "simultaneously transmitted signals are added up on the wireless channel and , as we will show , this property can be exploited to send the sum ( or another linear function ) to the relay in a single time slot .",
    "figure [ f : twowaycomp ] illustrates how this scheme allows users to exchange messages in just @xmath28 time slots .",
    "the remainder of this paper is devoted to showing how this is possible and characterizing the exact gains .",
    "we will start with some rudimentary examples and gradually build up a toolkit for general networks .",
    "time slots .",
    "( a ) during the first time slot , the users send the sum of their messages @xmath30 to the relay using a nested lattice scheme .",
    "( b ) during the second time slot , the relay sends the sum of the messages back to both users .",
    ", width=312 ]    note we did not take into consideration the distributed scheduling problems that arise in wireless networks .",
    "for instance , in the backoff protocol of the ieee 802.11 standard , users listen to see if the channel is free before they transmit .",
    "if the channel is in use , they remain silent for a random interval before listening again .",
    "we are primarily interested in the gains due to novel signaling schemes and will assume ideal scheduling .",
    "the interaction between these new schemes and practical scheduling algorithms is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we start our discussion by considering a hypothetical physical layer that is particularly well - suited to the standard linear network coding , yet serves to illustrate some of the key properties and effects that can be exploited over more realistic physical layers , such as the wireless case discussed in the second part of this paper .",
    "this finite field model will help build intuition for the more intricate strategies used later on .",
    "specifically , let us first consider a channel model that is completely noise - free , and where the transmitted signals interfere in a modulo - additive way .",
    "that is , each transmitted symbol takes values in @xmath32 where we assume that @xmath0 is a prime number .",
    "let @xmath33 $ ] denote the symbol transmitted by the @xmath34 user in time slot @xmath35 .",
    "separately for each time slot , the physical layer provides , as its channel output , the modulo-@xmath0 sum of all the input signals from all @xmath14 transmitters during that time slot : @xmath36 = x_1[t ] \\oplus x_2[t ] \\oplus \\cdots \\oplus x_l[t ] \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we find it convenient to consider blocks of @xmath37 time slots jointly , which we represent in vector notation : @xmath38~x_\\ell[2]~\\cdots~x_\\ell[n ] \\big]^t\\\\ \\mathbf{y } & = \\big [ y[1]~y[2]~\\cdots~y[n ] \\big]^t\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the transpose operator .",
    "thus , the channel output can be expressed as @xmath40 it is quite simple to exploit this channel for linear network coding .",
    "each transmitter should just pre - multiply its packet by an appropriately chosen coefficient @xmath41 out of the set @xmath32 where multiplication is again modulo-@xmath42 and transmit the resulting signal on the physical layer , @xmath43 the channel output is then exactly equal to our desired linear combination @xmath44 in one shot , the receiver learned exactly what it needed to make the network code work and not one bit more .",
    "this should be contrasted to the standard approach in which the transmitters would take turns , each sending its entire packet to the receiver , who would then compute the desired linear combination ( and forward it ) . clearly , the latter would take @xmath14 times longer to complete . therefore , for this very particular `` physical '' layer , the described ( simple and obvious ) scheme attains a speedup of a factor of @xmath45 which can also be shown to be the optimal attainable performance ( see section [ s : optimality ] )",
    ". it will be convenient to capture the performance of the computation scheme by what we will refer to as the _ computation rate , _ namely , the number of bits of the linear function successfully recovered per channel use .",
    "for the present example , this evaluates to @xmath46 whereas sending the data separately can only attain @xmath47          let us now bring this model one step closer to physical reality . in particular , we will add _ noise _ into the picture and show that in some interesting cases , exactly the same speedup is possible .",
    "we begin with an erasure channel .",
    "say that out of every block of three symbols put into the channel , one is chosen at random and erased .",
    "if we just transmit uncoded , some of the symbols will be lost and we will fail to achieve our goal of error - free network coding .",
    "we can overcome this problem with an error - correcting code that adds a parity - check to every two symbols .",
    "let @xmath48 and @xmath49 be symbols taking values in @xmath50 .",
    "the code maps these two information symbols into three symbols @xmath51\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which can then be transmitted over the channel .",
    "if one of these three symbols is missing , it can be recovered from the other two so we can reliably transmit symbols over the channel .",
    "now , consider a two - user channel like that shown in figure [ f : modadder ] .",
    "the output is the mod-@xmath0 sum of the two users transmissions , except that one out of three symbols is randomly erased . in figure",
    "[ f : erasuresep ] , we illustrate a standard approach to error control over a noisy multiple - access channel : each user encodes its own symbols and is allocated its own time slots for transmission .",
    "our ultimate goal is to reconstruct the linear combinations @xmath52 and @xmath53 at the decoder .",
    "transmitting all the symbols reliably to the receiver requires a total of @xmath54 channel uses as we need one parity symbol per user to recover from the erasure .",
    "however , as shown in figure [ f : erasurecomp ] , if both users transmit their coded symbols simultaneously , this can be accomplished in @xmath31 channel uses .",
    "the parity checks @xmath55 and @xmath56 will be added up by the channel .",
    "therefore , the receiver will observe @xmath57 , which serves as a parity check on the desired linear combinations . in other words ,",
    "the channel combines the original parity checks in exactly the right way .",
    "in fact , if all the information was available at a single transmitter , we would pre - compute the linear combinations and use the same parity check to protect them . in summary ,",
    "the key observation is a speedup ( or , equivalently , capacity gain ) proportional to the number of transmitting terminals ( two , in the example just discussed ) .",
    "more explicitly , the computation rate for this scheme is @xmath58 and the computation rate resulting from sending all of the data is @xmath59              the key idea in the example above is that not only does the channel naturally compute the linear combinations of the information symbols , it also computes the parity checks for them .",
    "as it turns out , this idea can take us quite far for noisy modulo - adder channels .",
    "we find it instructive to start the discussion by considering classical algebraic error - correction codes . to this end , let @xmath60 be an @xmath61 generator matrix for a linear code that can correct up to @xmath62 errors .",
    "both users in figure [ f : modadder ] encode their respective messages using this generator matrix , meaning that they will choose channel inputs @xmath63 and @xmath64 , respectively .",
    "now , the the channel output can be expressed as @xmath65 where the last step follows from the distributive property of matrix multiplication .",
    "the key observation is that the generator matrix @xmath60 directly protects the modulo - sum of the two messages .",
    "therefore , as long as there are no more than @xmath62 errors , i.e. , as long as the hamming weight of the error vector @xmath66 is no more than @xmath67 the modulo - sum of the messages can be perfectly recovered .",
    "it is important to note that this again represents a speedup of a factor proportional to the number of users ( two , in this example ) over the standard approach of sending the full messages to the decoder .",
    "next , we discuss how this idea naturally extends beyond the fixed error model of classical error - correction codes to models with random errors . to begin , it is insightful to consider the standard connection between such codes and classical information theory .",
    "the standard information - theoretic approach for showing the achievability of a certain rate of transmission is via the so - called random coding argument , a version of the probabilistic method .",
    "first , codewords are drawn element - by - element independently from a fixed probability distribution . then , it is shown that the decoding error probability at the receiver is very small as long as the number of codewords is small enough .",
    "this involves a union bound over all codewords .",
    "finally , it can be argued that since the probability of error is small on average over the random codebook , there must be at least one good fixed codebook ( see ( * ? ? ? *",
    "theorem 7.7.1 ) for more details ) .",
    "clearly , the resulting randomly chosen codebook used in this argument has no algebraic structure whatsoever ( with probability one ) .",
    "however , there is an alternative argument that also permits to establish achievable rates of communication and that does involve algebraic structure . here",
    ", one starts by randomly drawing each element a generator matrix @xmath60 independently from the uniform distribution over @xmath68 we note that by this construction , the elements of all codewords will be uniformly distributed over the entire @xmath0-ary alphabet .",
    "it can be shown with a little more work that the resulting code has pairwise independent codewords ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 6.2 ) ) so one can still take a union bound as above .",
    "the main trick is to let each transmitter employ this same code : @xmath69 the channel output then looks as if the desired function @xmath8 was directly encoded with @xmath60 : @xmath70 since the codewords are pairwise independent , standard information - theoretic arguments can be applied .",
    "it can be shown that the probability of decoding error can be made arbitrarily small ( by increasing the coding blocklength ) so long as the rate is smaller than the mutual information between the sum of the inputs @xmath71 and the output @xmath72 which can be calculated as follows : @xmath73 for this random linear code construction , the channel inputs are uniformly distributed over all @xmath0 letters , and thus , @xmath74 is also uniformly distributed over all @xmath0 letters , meaning that @xmath75 thus , any rate up to @xmath76 bits per channel use is achievable .",
    "for comparison , sending all of the data separately and then evaluating the function requires @xmath14 times more channel uses , resulting in a rate @xmath77 bits per channel use .",
    "the idea of using the _ same linear code _ at each encoder for this setting was introduced by us in a 2005 paper @xcite ( see @xcite for the journal version ) .",
    "our inspiration came from a paper by krner and marton which uses this technique for the distributed compression of the parity of two dependent binary sources @xcite .",
    "the gains in their setting come from the degree of dependence between the two binary random variables . in our case , the gains come from eliminating the need to send all the data to the receiver .",
    "we now briefly discuss the information - theoretic optimality of the proposed coding technique for the special case of linear modulo - additive channel models .",
    "for such channels , the rate can not exceed @xmath78 as this is the best performance attainable if all transmitters could fully cooperate .",
    "note that the maximization is over the probability distribution of the channel inputs @xmath79 rewriting this mutual information expression in terms of entropies yields @xmath80 where the inequality is due to the fact that the entropy can not be larger than the logarithm of the alphabet size .",
    "this means that in the special case of the modulo - additive channel , the proposed code attains the best possible computation rate , i.e. the computation capacity .",
    "this coding strategy can certainly be employed in channels that can not be represented as a noisy finite field sum of their inputs .",
    "although it may not always attain the capacity , it often provides a superior performance than sending all of the data to the receiver .",
    "assume each channel input takes values on @xmath50 ( otherwise relabel the symbols appropriately ) .",
    "we use the same encoding procedure as before by having each transmitter send @xmath81 .",
    "it can be shown that the receiver can reliably decode the function @xmath82 so long as the rate is less than the mutual information between this desired function and the channel output : @xmath83 where @xmath84 are uniformly distributed .",
    "see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 7 ) for more details .",
    "another possible strategy is to have each transmitter send its data uncoded simultaneously and then take turns sending parity checks while avoiding collisions . in some cases ,",
    "this does better than using the same linear code at each transmitter .",
    "we studied this strategy in more depth in @xcite under the moniker of `` systematic computation coding . ''",
    "while channels that operate over the finite field may seem a bit contrived , they can be quite useful to model certain wireless scenarios .",
    "for instance , in section [ s : uncodedfinite ] , we will explore a scheme in which the receiver makes a hard decision on the modulo-@xmath28 sum of the transmitted bits .",
    "there is some probability , depending on the signal - to - noise ratio , that this estimate of the sum is in error .",
    "thus , after the hard decision , the channel is precisely a noisy modulo-@xmath28 adder channel and the coding techniques developed above can be used to denoise the modulo-@xmath28 sum of the bits .",
    "finite field models can also be used to create accurate approximations of certain classes of wireless networks as shown by avestimehr , diggavi , and tse @xcite .",
    "several groups have studied network coding strategies in the context of finite field physical layer models including @xcite .",
    "the structure and interpretation of the physical layer is of key importance for the ideas presented in this paper . for example , in section  [ s : finitefield ] , we considered a finite field `` physical '' layer that could be easily incorporated into the network code construction , leading to significant speedup ( or , equivalently , capacity gains ) .",
    "much of the remainder of this paper is devoted to a physical layer that is of particular current interest , namely , the wireless medium .",
    "therefore , we first briefly revisit its standard models and properties .",
    "we will refrain from a deep discussion of this , referring the reader instead to a host of textbooks and monographs on the topic , including  @xcite . however , there are three key observations that are important for the techniques discussed in this paper , and we here review them in turn .      between the transmitter and a receiver , an electromagnetic signal undergoes a ( potentially time - varying ) _ linear _ transformation .",
    "this transformation is primarily induced by reflections and multi - path propagation . assuming band - limited communication , the respective signals can be represented uniquely by complex - valued discrete - time samples .",
    "then , the received signal at any point in space can be expressed as the convolution of the transmitted signal with an impulse - response function that characterizes the signal propagation .",
    "short of modeling exactly the physical surroundings , a popular approach is to model this impulse - response function in a statistical fashion .",
    "assuming flat ( meaning frequency non - selective ) fading , as would be appropriate for narrow - band communication , this impulse - response function reduces to a delta function whose height characterizes the signal propagation . in this particularly simple and commonly studied model ,",
    "the induced signal at any point in space can be expressed as @xmath85,$ ] where @xmath86 $ ] is the signal transmitted in time slot @xmath87 the random fading @xmath88 is often modeled as a ( circularly symmetric complex ) gaussian random variable , though this is not fundamental for the exposition here . more importantly , however , it is usually assumed that the fading @xmath88 is known exactly to the receiver , which is motivated by signal measurements that can be acquired at the receiver .",
    "we will also make this assumption throughout this paper . a natural follow - up",
    "question concerns whether @xmath88 is also known to the transmitter . in this paper",
    ", we will generally assume that the transmitter is _ ignorant _ of @xmath89      this second point is a direct extension of the first one .",
    "namely , consider now that @xmath14 transmitters are active simultaneously . then , along the same lines described above , the induced signal at any point in space can be expressed as @xmath90}.$ ] it is commonly assumed that the respective fading coefficients @xmath91 are independent of each other , each following a gaussian law , and we will follow this assumption throughout , although it is not fundamental for our main arguments .      more particularly , in line with the standard models , we will assume that the noise distribution is described by a ( circularly symmetric complex ) gaussian law , although again this is not fundamental for the ideas laid out here .    these three key observations , together with several more detailed considerations , lead to the following commonly used model for the signal at a particular receiver when @xmath14 transmitters are simultaneously active : @xmath92 = \\sum_{\\ell = 1}^{l } { h_{\\ell } x_\\ell[t ] } + z[t ] \\ .",
    "\\label{e : wireless}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as this model shows , the undesirable element for linear network coding on the physical layer is the noise : generally , it will add up over the various stages of the network , and thus , suitable reliable coding is necessary .",
    "consider the special case of the model above where there is only one active transmitter .",
    "this is the classical gaussian channel : @xmath92 = hx[t ] + z[t]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if @xmath93 $ ] is taken to be independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "circularly symmetric complex gaussian noise with variance @xmath94 . to model the fact that the transmitter has a limited power budget ,",

    "specifically , both the wireless channel and random linear network coding output a linear combination of their inputs , with the coefficients generated randomly according to some distribution .",
    "however , the wireless channel exhibits two key differences :    1 .",

    "our goal , for the remainder of this paper , is to show that by using appropriate modulation and coding techniques we can exploit the wireless medium for reliable network coding over a finite field . in this section , we will see how much is already possible using _ uncoded _ modulation strategies . in other words ,",
    "we will try to map the complex field into the finite field but we will ignore the effects of the noise .",
    "the most intuitive physical layer network coding strategy is to have the users transmit their message bits directly on the wireless channel .",
    "if the channel gains are equal , then the receiver will get the noisy sum of the bits from which it can make an estimate of its desired modulo-@xmath28 sum . to the best of our understanding ,",

    "the relay could then broadcast the sum back to the users and complete the entire exchange in only two time slots .",
    "of course , the channel does not output the mod-@xmath28 sum so we will have to be a bit more clever .",

    "the relay therefore sees the noisy sum of the transmitted signals and we can consider the real and imaginary parts of the channel separately . the real part of the signal observed at the relay at time @xmath35 is @xmath98 = x_1[t ] + x_2[t ] + \\zr[t]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath99 $ ] is the real - valued symbol transmitted by user @xmath100 at time @xmath35 and @xmath101 $ ] is gaussian noise with variance @xmath94 .",

    "the same scheme can be applied to the imaginary part .    for ease of analysis ,",
    "assume that the total power per channel use is @xmath102 which means that we can allocate one unit of power to the real part and one unit to the imaginary part .",

    "similarly , if @xmath107 is @xmath108 , then @xmath109 is either @xmath28 or @xmath110 , depending on the original bits .",
    "we would like to design a decoding rule for the delay to make an estimate @xmath111 of the mod-@xmath28 sum @xmath107 from its noisy observed sum @xmath74 .",
    "for simplicity , we assume that each user s bit is generated from a fair coin toss .",
    "the maximum a posteriori ( map ) rule to minimize the probability that @xmath111 is in error is given by : @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the conditional probability distribution of the channel output given the mod-@xmath28 sum .",

    ", errors can also be left uncorrected and dealt with using the end - to - end network error correction framework proposed in @xcite .      instead of mapping the complex - valued output of the wireless channel into a finite field , the linear network coding framework can be modified to operate directly in the complex field .",
    "this can result in significant performance gains as the desired linear combinations are identical to the operation performed by the channel , ignoring the noise .",

    "in general , the wireless channel may be subject to fading and the users and relay may have more than one antenna . this scenario has been studied in detail in the literature @xcite . for larger networks ,",
    "the approach remains the same : each relay scales and retransmits its observation @xcite .",
    "however , the noise build ups with each retransmission so the @xmath121 requirement increases as the network grows @xcite .",
    "we also note that , in some scenarios , it is advantageous to use the compress - and - forward framework from @xcite instead of amplify - and - forward .      while analog network coding presents clear benefits in terms of end - to - end throughput , these seem to come at an _ architectural _ price . today",
    "s wireless networks use a layered architecture @xcite ( often referred to as the network protocol stack ) that separates wireless signaling schemes from flow control , scheduling , and information contents . in order to make this decoupling possible , the physical layer employs error - correcting codes to lower the raw error probabilities , and on top of that , an acknowledgment feedback process ( often expressed as ack / nack ) is used according to which a transmitter repeats a certain packet until it receives an acknowledgment signal from the receiver .",
    "higher layers then rely on an error - free transmission of a certain capacity .",
    "indeed , this capacity limitation is the only way in which higher layers are aware of the underlying physical reality . with analog network coding",
    ", it is not possible to enable this . here ,",
    "intermediate nodes will forward erroneous packets ( or functions thereof ) , and there is no way for an intermediate node to tell whether it is forwarding something useful or not . for reliable communication , additional error correction has to be implemented end - to - end .",
    "this may be acceptable for small networks ( such as the two - way relay channel example ) , but it will prevent a layered architecture for larger networks , instead requiring cross - layer design . by this , we mean that higher layers have to take into account a detailed description of the physical reality of the communications medium , beyond simple capacity figures . kawadia and",
    "kumar argued that the benefits of cross - layer design may be offset by the loss of robustness and modularity in @xcite .    in sections [",
    "s : reliablepnc ] and [ s : fading ] , we suggest a framework for reliable physical layer network coding across wireless links .",
    "this framework can be implemented in a completely modular fashion since each receiver can reliably decode a linear function of the transmitted bits .",
    "standard acknowledgment feedback protocols can be employed in this scenario , as well as novel feedback protocols developed with network coding in mind @xcite .",
    "network layer protocols can be built around state - of - the - art wired network coding algorithms .",
    "this framework has shown promise in several theoretical studies but much work remains to show that it can be successfully adapted to practice .",
    "the framework developed in section [ s : finitefield ] is able to protect linear combinations of codewords against noise .",
    "however , the tools seem to only be a natural fit for channels that can be written as a noisy operation over a finite field . while this behavior can be mimicked on a wireless channel by using appropriate hard decision rules ( as in section [ s : uncodedfinite ] ) , this approach does not , in general , lead to the best performance . in this section , we describe a principled approach to wireless channels with equal channel gains .",
    "ultimately , this approach will enable us to build a digital interface for physical layer network coding over channels with arbitrary gains .",
    "a natural starting point is to find a capacity - achieving code for the gaussian channel with a _",
    "linear structure_. specifically , we would like a good code over the reals such that the sum of any two codewords is itself a codeword .",
    "it turns out that this matches the definition of a _",

    "a lattice code is usually constructed by carving out a portion of a lattice and designating the selected points as codewords .",
    "several such constructions have been proposed that can achieve the capacity of a gaussian channel ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "the lattice code should also obey some form of modulo arithmetic so that we can map between the linear combination taken by the channel and our desired linear combination over the messages .",
    "one elegant solution is to employ the capacity - achieving _ nested lattice codes _ developed by erez and zamir @xcite .",
    "if a lattice @xmath137 is a subset of another lattice @xmath144 , @xmath145 , then @xmath137 is said to be nested in @xmath144 . in this nested lattice pair , @xmath137",

    "erez and zamir s nested lattice codes have three key properties that make them ideally suited for reliable physical layer network coding :    1 .   as the dimension ( or blocklength )",
    "increases , the fundamental voronoi region of the coarse lattice becomes more spherical , which means that it is appropriate for guaranteeing the power constraint .",
    "2 .   as the dimension increases",

    "unfortunately , this does not take us all the way to the channel capacity , only to @xmath167 .",
    "erez and zamir showed that to reach capacity , it is crucial that the channel observation be scaled by the minimum - mean squared error ( mmse ) coefficient , @xmath168 ( see @xcite for an in - depth discussion of the mmse scaling ) .",
    "now , the effective noise variance is @xmath169 where the second to last step is , roughly speaking , due to the fact that capacity - achieving codes have codewords that look like i.i.d .",

    "these guidelines are drawn from @xcite and we refer interested readers to these works for more detail .",
    "first , the coarse lattice can simply be taken to be integers multiplied by the field size @xmath0 , @xmath171 .",
    "this reduces quantization onto the coarse lattice to rounding each element of the received vector to the nearest multiple of @xmath0 .",
    "the cost is the shaping gain , which is at most @xmath172 bits per complex channel symbol ( see @xcite ) .",

    "this nested lattice scheme was proposed by narayanan , wilson , and sprintson for the two - way relay channel in 2007 @xcite .",

    "this effect becomes negligible and the optimal limiting slope of @xmath194 is attained .",
    "the curve labeled `` netcod '' is the performance attained by the wireless broadcast network coding scheme in section [ s : twoway ] , depicted in figure [ f : twowaynetcod ] .",
    "each user takes a turn sending its message to the relay and the relay sends the mod-@xmath28 sum back to the users .",
    "this scheme loses out at high transmit power due to the fact that three channel uses are needed for each exchange , making for a limiting slope of @xmath195    the curve labeled `` routing '' is the scheme in section [ s : twoway ] , depicted in figure [ f : twowayrouting ] .",
    "each user takes a turn sending its message to the relay and the relay sends these back to the users . at high transmit power",
    ", one can verify that this leads to a limiting slope of @xmath196        the final curve , labeled `` bpsk , '' is the binary scheme in section [ s : uncodedfinite ] , according to which each user transmits its bits uncoded and the relay makes a hard decision about the modulo-@xmath28 sum .",
    "the broadcast phase is abstracted as a bit pipe simultaneously to both users with a rate corresponding to the capacity of the broadcast channel from the relay to the users ( which thus depends on the transmit power @xmath97 ) .",
    "error - correcting codes are then used end - to - end .",
    "note that due to the fact that bpsk is used , this scheme plateaus at @xmath26 bit per channel use ; if a larger constellation were used , this plateau effect would be higher ( but the performance at low snr might suffer ) .    as a final caveat , we note that some of the achievable schemes can be slightly improved by optimizing the ratio of time spent in the different phases . for the present figure , it is assumed that all these phases are of the same length , as in the descriptions provided in section [ s : twoway ] .",
    "if the channel simply outputs a noisy sum of the transmitted signals , then it is intuitive that this can be exploited for adding up the messages . yet ,",
    "in general , the channel output will be some linear combination according to complex - valued coefficients and it is not immediately clear that this will be a good match for network coding over a finite field . here",
    ", we demonstrate how to overcome this obstacle using the compute - and - forward framework we proposed in @xcite .",
    "first , we show how to reliably compute over real - valued channels and then we use this scheme as a building block for complex - valued channels .",
    "consider a real - valued channel whose output vector is just a linear function of the transmitted vectors plus some gaussian noise , @xmath197 assume that each user selects and transmits a point from a nested lattice code .",
    "the key idea is that , instead of trying to decode the sum , the receiver should aim to decode an _ integer combination _ of the codewords ( modulo the coarse lattice ) , @xmath198 \\modl.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this integer combination is itself a codeword , due to the linear structure of the nested lattice code , and is therefore afforded protection against noise .",
    "if these integer coefficients are close enough to the real - valued coefficients of the channel , then it seems plausible that the receiver can decode the function successfully .",
    "more precisely , the receiver makes the following estimate of @xmath199 : @xmath200 \\modl \\\\ & = \\left [ q_{\\lambda_{\\text{fine}}}([\\alpha \\yb ] \\modl ) \\right ] \\modl \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the second line is due to the commutative property .",
    "prior to quantization onto the fine lattice , this is just the desired function @xmath199 plus some noise : @xmath201 \\modl \\\\ & = [ \\alpha ( h_1 \\mathbf{x}_1 + \\cdots + h_l \\mathbf{x}_l + \\zb ) ] \\modl \\\\ & = [ a_1\\mathbf{x}_1 + \\cdots + a_l\\mathbf{x}_l ~\\cdots \\\\ & ~~\\cdots~ + ( \\alpha h_1 - a_1 ) \\mathbf{x}_1 + \\cdots   + ( \\alpha h_l - a_l ) \\mathbf{x}_l + \\alpha \\zb ] \\modl \\nonumber \\\\ & = [ \\mathbf{v } + ( \\alpha h_1 - a_1 ) \\mathbf{x}_1 + \\cdots   ( \\alpha h_l - a_l ) \\mathbf{x}_l + \\alpha \\zb ] \\modl \\nonumber.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the effective noise comes from both the non - integer part of the channel and the gaussian noise .",
    "the effective noise variance is @xmath202 this means that the receiver can recover the integer combination of codewords so long as the rate of the nested lattice code is at most @xmath203 again , it can be shown that the optimal @xmath161 is the mmse coefficient , @xmath204 here , the role of @xmath161 can be thought of as trying to move the channel coefficients towards integers .",
    "for instance , if the channel coefficients are @xmath205 and @xmath206 , then choosing @xmath207 converts the channel into a noisy adder ( like that studied in section [ s : equalgains ] ) at the price of quadrupling the noise variance . substituting @xmath208 into the rate expression simplifies it down to @xmath209 finally , the recovered integer combination of the codewords can be mapped to a modulo-@xmath0 linear combination of the messages , @xmath210        therefore , this channel model can be exploited to reliably compute linear functions over a finite field .",
    "we now draw attention to the fact that the encoding function does not depend on the channel coefficients : the transmitters just send out their nested lattice point .",
    "this implies that even if the channel coefficients are completely unknown to the transmitters , this scheme can still be used .",
    "( clearly , the receiver needs to know the channel coefficients so it can choose the integer coefficients appropriately and determine the optimal @xmath161 . )",
    "thus , if multiple receivers with different channel coefficients all receive signals from the same transmitters , each receiver can decode its own particular linear combination at a rate as given in ( [ e : compopt ] ) .",
    "see figure [ f : multirec ] for an illustration .",
    "note that the receiver is not limited to decoding a single function .",
    "it can run the decoding step on its observed vector several times to extract several different functions . as a special case",
    ", the receiver can recover a single message @xmath21 by setting the associated coefficient to one , @xmath211 , and all others to zero .",
    "it can be shown that the rate for this special case is @xmath212 which corresponds exactly to the rate attainable by treating other simultaneous transmissions as undesirable interference .",
    "taking this idea a bit further , it can be demonstrated that the nested lattice framework can attain any point in the gaussian multiple - access rate region @xcite .",
    "thus , it can only help to use this nested lattice scheme for decoding functions since , as a backup , the receiver can just decode the messages individually with no rate penalty whatsoever .    unlike the finite field strategies considered in section [ s : finitefield ] , different coefficients result in different rates .",
    "in many scenarios , the receiver can simply search for the coefficients that offer the highest possible rate and then target that equation . if the channel coefficients are sufficiently independent , then there is a good chance that each receiver will decode a linearly independent equation and the end - to - end linear transformation between the sources and the destinations will be invertible . in some cases , there are benefits to imposing some restrictions on the coefficients that can be selected .",
    "overall , this strategy is especially useful in networks with concurrent transmissions as receivers must cope with interference in one way or another .",
    "as an example , in figure [ f : m3compute ] , there are three transmitters that simultaneously transmit their messages to a single receiver which tries to reliably decode a linear function .",
    "note that recovering a single message corresponds to recovering a function with a single non - zero coefficient .",
    "each fading coefficient is drawn i.i.d . from a gaussian distribution and the fading realization",
    "is only known to the transmitter . in figure",
    "[ f : geteqm3 ] , we compare three different strategies for this network .",
    "the `` decode an equation '' strategy is just the nested lattice scheme discussed in this section , whose performance is given by ( [ e : compopt ] ) .",
    "the `` decode a message '' strategy is the rate attainable if the receiver only tries to get a single message , not an equation .",
    "this curve corresponds to the information - theoretic optimum for the special case of decoding a single message . finally , the `` interference as noise '' is a suboptimal strategy for decoding one message that treats the other two messages as noise .",
    "the performance is given by ( [ e : interferenceasnoise ] ) .    .",
    "in figure [ f : geteqm3 ] , three strategies for this scenario are plotted.,width=264 ]          as mentioned in section [ s : wireless ] , the baseband representation , @xmath213of a narrowband wireless channel is complex - valued . with a few simple modifications , the nested lattice scheme for real - valued channels can be applied here as well .",
    "each encoder breaks its message @xmath123 into two messages of equal length , @xmath214 and @xmath215 .",
    "the resulting messages are mapped onto nested lattice points ( using @xmath185 ) and sent as the real and imaginary parts of the transmitted codeword , @xmath216 the decoder deals with the real and imaginary parts of the received signal separately .",
    "the real part is @xmath217 which can be treated like the received signal from a real - valued channel with @xmath218 transmitters . from this",
    ", the receiver can decode a linear function of the form @xmath219\\modq.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] similarly , the imaginary part is @xmath220 from which the receiver recovers the complementary linear function @xmath221\\modq.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in @xcite , we showed that the effective noise variance is always the same for real and imaginary received signals and the computation rate @xmath222 bits per channel use is achievable .",
    "if a destination is given several of these equations , it can infer the original messages as long as the matrix of complex integer coefficients @xmath223 \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is full rank .",
    "this scheme is studied in detail in @xcite as well as in the first author s phd thesis @xcite .",
    "one interesting extension is to use multiple antennas at the receiver to steer the channel coefficients towards integer values , thus increasing the rate at which an equation can be recovered @xcite .",
    "the above analysis shows that , for sufficiently large blocklengths , there exist encoders and decoders that can efficiently harness the interference property of the wireless medium for network coding .",
    "while we have chosen codebooks with a linear structure , this does not , by itself , imply they can be implemented with low complexity , especially on the decoder side .",
    "this is similar to the classical channel coding problem where the capacity gives the ultimate performance limit and one then attempts to design practically realizable codes that can approach this limit .",
    "very recently , several groups have proposed practical coding schemes that are designed with reliable physical layer network coding in mind .",
    "we briefly describe three of these schemes below .    in @xcite ,",
    "feng , silva , and kschischang take an algebraic approach and propose a set of lattice partitions whose properties make them appealing for physical layer network coding . for instance , their nested lattice construction attains a field size of @xmath224 for the same complexity it takes the basic scheme to attain a field size of @xmath0 . through simulations",
    ", they also show that their framework works quite well for blocklengths as small as @xmath225 .",
    "the basic compute - and - forward framework employs constellations and codes over a prime - sized finite field to ensure a match between the linear combinations taken by the channel and the linear combinations over the codewords .",
    "unfortunately , the implementation complexity of a coding scheme increases with the characteristic where @xmath0 is a prime and @xmath226 is a positive integer .",
    "usually , @xmath0 is referred to as the characteristic of the finite field . ] of the finite field",
    "therefore , in practice , it is desirable to have constellations of size @xmath227 for some positive integer @xmath226 . with an appropriate mapping ,",
    "these constellations can be coupled with binary linear codes to significantly reduce the implementation complexity .",
    "the main difficulty is that the mapping from constellation points to codeword symbols must preserve the interference structure of the channel . to overcome this issue , hern and",
    "narayanan proposed using multilevel codes and allowing the receiver to decode to a larger class of functions @xcite .",
    "specifically , each constellation symbol is specified by a block of @xmath226 bits .",
    "different coefficients are allowed for each of these bits but are constant from symbol to symbol .",
    "this allows the receiver more freedom in mapping the channel operation to something useful over the finite field .",
    "independently , ordentlich and erez have developed a framework @xcite that uses mapping by set partitioning to go from binary codewords to higher order constellations .",
    "their preliminary simulations have shown that this constellation mapping in conjuction with an ldpc code can perform quite well .",
    "in the context of a larger network , what does reliable physical layer network coding mean for the overall network code ?",
    "network codes are usually designed over networks of bit pipes and the relays are therefore free to select any coefficients for their linear combinations that maximize the end - to - end throughput . however , in this new framework , the rate at which a particular linear combination can be decoded by a relay hinges on the match between the desired coefficients and the fading coefficients of the wireless channel .",
    "relays must choose function coefficients that balance between maximizing the local computation rate and the end - to - end throughput .",
    "for instance , in the two - way relay channel with fading , the relay can recover any equation @xmath228 so long as both @xmath229 and @xmath230 are non - zero .",
    "otherwise , at least one of the users will not receive any novel information .    for a multi - stage relay network , selecting the optimal function coefficients corresponds to an integer program if we are given access to the full channel state information . yet , in many cases , nodes will only have access to some subset of the channel state , most likely just that of their immediate neighbors @xcite . for this scenario ,",
    "new algorithms and heuristics are needed to enable distributed coefficient selection .",
    "more research is also needed to elucidate how much of an advantage , in terms of end - to - end throughput , is offered by reliable physical layer network coding over realistic wireless network topologies .",
    "one preliminary theoretical analysis is developed in  @xcite , where it is assumed that any node receives the modulo-2 sum of the packets transmitted by the nearest - neighbor transmitters .",
    "this situation is compared to the case where nodes can receive full packets from neighboring nodes , but at an appropriately lower rate . in terms of transport capacity and for a network of nodes located on a regular lattice in two dimensions",
    ", it is shown that the former more than doubles the capacity of the latter .",
    "physical layer network coding is an intuitively pleasing enhancement to network coding . in network coding ,",
    "intermediate nodes forward linear combinations of information packets ( or more general functions of them ) and destination nodes collect a sufficient number of linearly independent functions so as to be able to recover their desired information packets .",
    "physical layer network coding starts from the insight that it can be much more efficient for a node to directly learn the linear function of several packets , rather than having to first learn each packet separately and then evaluating the function .",
    "this is particularly tempting in the case of the wireless medium since there , transmitted signals naturally interfere in a linear fashion .",
    "one approach reviewed in this paper , dubbed analog network coding , uses this effect in an uncoded fashion , dealing separately ( end - to - end ) with the accumulating noise . in this paper",
    ", we particularly emphasized a way to circumvent this problem and instead enforce _ reliable _ physical layer network coding even inside of the network .",
    "the main idea underlying this framework is that each transmitter should employ the same linear code . through examples",
    ", we have illustrated the superiority of this approach in a capacity sense .",
    "a second superiority concerns the resulting overall layered system architecture : in reliable physical layer network coding , the physical layer can be made essentially transparent to the end - to - end communication process .",
    "systems are currently being designed to determine to what extent the promised performance gains are attainable over the real wireless medium , but much of this exciting path still lays ahead .",
