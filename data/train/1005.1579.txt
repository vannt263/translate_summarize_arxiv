    "such a near constancy could only arise if an organism produces new viruses ( by bursts ) and clears viruses at similar overall rates  @xcite .    with the constraint that the number of virus particles remains fixed , on average , the respective probabilities of making a single step to the right and to the left",

    "while the exit probabilities can be obtained by enumerating all random walk trajectories to the exit point and computing the probabilities for all these paths , the above recursions provide the same results much more easily  @xcite .",
    "we will use different methods to solve eqs .   for short and large burst lengths , and therefore study these cases separately .",
