    "asteroids and comets are probes of the primordial solar system .",
    "their weak gravitational attraction enables the study of a range of physical processes that are not possible to detect on larger moons and planets . in recent years",
    ", the traditional astronomical distinction between rocky asteroids and ice - rich comets has been replaced by the recognition of a continuous distribution in both composition and volatility ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "some objects that were initially identified as asteroids have been seen to exhibit cometary outbursts @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "some known comets have become dormant as they apparently exhausted their volatile - rich outer layers @xcite .",

    "@xcite has shown that dusty mass loss may occur even when virtually no icy material is left .",
    "when small solid bodies approach the sun , there are strong radiative and thermal effects that release gas molecules , dust particles , and larger pieces of regolith ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at small heliocentric distances ",
    "e.g . , for sungrazing comets  the dust dissociates rapidly and the gas becomes ionized @xcite and often the entire object is destroyed @xcite .",
    "mass loss from comets in the inner heliosphere remains a useful , albeit indirect , probe of the solar wind @xcite and the hot solar corona @xcite .",
    "many similar ablative processes may also be occurring in the environments of extrasolar planets that orbit close to their host stars @xcite .",
    "active asteroids in the innermost heliosphere have not yet been explored by planetary spacecraft . however , _ solar probe plus _ ( _ spp _ ) will spend several years inside the orbit of venus @xcite with a minimum perihelion distance of 0.0459  au ( i.e. , 9.86 solar radii ) .",

    "the dynamical properties of 97 mercury - crossing asteroids were obtained from the nasa / jpl horizons on - line ephemeris system @xcite in july 2015 . the horizons system was used to convert the tabulated orbital elements into cartesian @xmath2 positions , which we saved at 12  hour intervals during the calendar years 2018 to 2026 . in order to compare directly with the _ spp _ trajectory data , each asteroid s coordinates",
    "were interpolated to the denser ( 0.1  day ) time grid obtained from the spacecraft spice kernel .",
    "the specific asteroids appropriate for this study were selected with the following criteria .",
    "first , we included all 63 known asteroids with perihelia less than 0.2  au .",
    "the asteroid that approaches closest to the sun is 2005  hc@xmath4 , with perihelion @xmath5  au ( i.e. , 15.2  @xmath6 ) .",
    "there are six others with perihelia less than 0.1  au .",
    "second , the database was extended to asteroids with perihelia between 0.2 and 0.3  au . however , out of the 159 known asteroids in this region , many of them are extremely small and dim . the results of sections  [ sec : massloss][sec : tail ] below show that only the largest asteroids at @xmath7  au are expected to display substantial mass loss .",
    "thus , we selected the brightest 34 of that group , with the criterion that their @xmath8-band absolute magnitudes @xmath9 must be @xmath10 .",

    "* ) to the case of near - sun active asteroids .    before proceeding with such modeling ,",
    "it is important to note that the loss of both silicate - rich gas and dust from rocky objects ( heated to @xmath67  k ) has not been studied as extensively as the standard cometary scenario of sublimating ice molecules that drag along the larger dust grains .",
    "however , the idea of a simultaneous ejection of multiple phases of the _ same _ type of material has been studied for comets . water ice and other volatile compounds appear to be ejected in both the gas phase and in the form of `` snow '' particles with sizes ranging from microns to meters ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "in addition to the analogy with comet ice loss , there are three other comparable situations that appear to have some resemblance and relevance to the case of active asteroids :    1",
    ".   meteors entering a planetary atmosphere undergo rapid deceleration and thermal ablation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "although the source of heating for meteors is different ( atmospheric drag versus solar radiation ) , the mass loss is often treated by replacing the latent heat of sublimation with a comparable heat of ablation @xcite . the size distribution of resulting fragments appears to be quite broad , from nanometer - scale `` smoke '' to micron - scale dust to macroscopic meteoroids @xcite .",
    "sungrazing comets have perihelia within a few solar radii of the sun s surface @xcite , and observations of their evolution upon close approach provide valuable information about the composition and thermal properties of primordial bodies in the solar system .",
    "@xcite was able to model the light curves of a number of sungrazing comets by assuming a continuous distribution of silicate erosion products ( i.e. , from large fragments to individual sublimated molecules ) .",
    "these comets have also been observed to emit metallic ",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "possible formation channels for the dust include condensation from sublimated gas , direct ejection via volcanism , or comet - like entrainment of grains along with escaping gas molecules .",
    "thus , there appear to be multiple ways that silicate - rich gas can be removed from the surfaces of solid objects near the sun , together with larger dust grains , when they experience strong solar irradiation .",
    "it should also be mentioned that the minerals left on the surfaces of these bodies may be irradiated sufficiently to induce various types of chemical and tensile metamorphosis @xcite .",
    "the thermal energy balance at the surface of a solid body can be solved to compute the mass loss rate @xmath68 and equilibrium temperature @xmath69 of molecules leaving the surface . ignoring heat conduction , the short - wave radiative energy gained",
    "must be balanced by losses due to long - wave radiation and sublimation , with @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the asteroid s bond albedo , @xmath72 is the solar constant , @xmath73 is the angle between rays from the sun and the asteroid surface normal , @xmath74 is the stefan - boltzmann constant , @xmath75 is the emissivity of the asteroid surface , @xmath76 is the atomic mass unit , @xmath77 is the latent heat of sublimation of the escaping gas , specified here as an energy per mole , and @xmath78 is the surface sublimation rate ( particles lost per unit area per unit time ) . for simplicity ,",

    "these observations could fill in a large gap between the properties of two heretofore distinct populations  active asteroids and sungrazing comets  and thus help complete the census of primordial solar system material .",
    "because of several ongoing uncertainties , many of the quantitative predictions made above may not remain valid for the actual _ spp _ mission to commence in 2018 . specifically , the following four factors will need to be re - evaluated over the coming few years :    1 .   as noted in section [ sec : orb ] , if the spacecraft launch slips from its nominal date of july 31 , 2018 , the predicted time - dependent distances between _ spp _ and the asteroids will be incorrect .",

    "thus , there may still be substantial uncertainties in their ephemeris parameters .",
    "such errors would necessarily propagate into our predictions of the relative times and distances of encounters with _",
    "_ whether the improvement of these parameters would give rise to a larger or smaller number of favorable encounters remains to be seen .",
    "nevertheless , the pace of asteroid discovery is likely to continue , and there may be dozens more possible targets discovered between now and 2018 .",
    "the predictions made above did not take into account that the wispr instrument has a finite field of view and can not see the entire sky .",
    "some fraction of favorable encounters with asteroids may end up being hidden behind the _ spp _ heat shield or other parts of the spacecraft .",
    "thus , not every asteroid in listed tables 1 and 3 will be observable at all times .",
    "these details need to be considered when constructing detailed observation plans , but they are beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the observability of any given asteroid and its surrounding dust cloud was computed using a threshold sky background of @xmath215 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it is possible that wispr may contain sufficient improvements in photon counting or flat - fielding , relative to the secchi package on _ stereo , _ that could allow even weaker signals to be extracted from the raw images .",

    "in addition to refining the positional and temporal accuracy of the above predictions , there are also several ways that the mass loss modeling can be improved .",
    "our assumption of constant values for @xmath77 and @xmath88 should be replaced by a more self - consistent ( i.e. , temperature dependent ) description of specific ejected materials .",
    "this is particularly important because the computed rates are often in the exponentially dropping part of the sublimation curve ( figure [ fig05 ] ) , where small variations in the input parameters could change @xmath78 by several orders of magnitude .",
    "also , the spherically symmetric @xcite model should be replaced by a full three - dimensional dynamical simulation of the ejected dust grains .",
