    "the recent discovery of a tight correlation between stellar bulge velocity dispersion and central black hole ( bh ) mass ( the @xmath5relation ) strongly indicates that bhs coevolve with their host galaxies ( gebhardt et al .",
    "2000a ; ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; tremaine et al .",
    "the growth and accretion histories of bhs appear to be inextricably linked with the mass assembly of galaxies .",
    "thus , the evolution of bh mass density over cosmic time provides observational constraints on galaxy evolution .",
    "the @xmath5  relation allows us to track bh mass density with time , provided we can measure a velocity dispersion for a given system .",
    "unfortunately , the bulge stellar velocity disperion is often difficult to measure directly . in active galaxies",
    "the stellar absorption features are quickly swamped by nonstellar emission from the nucleus .",
    "there is consequently a disconnect between the methods used to obtain bh masses for active galactic nuclei ( agns ) and quiescent galaxies . while locally it is possible to infer a bh mass function based on the distribution of stellar velocity dispersion ( e.g. ,  yu & tremaine 2002 ) , at significant distances we must rely on agns , which are significantly brighter than stellar light .",
    "the challenge remains to develop secondary estimators of bh masses in agns and assure ourselves that agns follow the same @xmath5  relation .",
    "luckily , there are a number of secondary techniques in development .",
    "reverberation mapping provides a virial estimate of bh mass to within a factor that depends on the geometry of the broad - line region ( blr ) ( e.g. ,  kaspi et al .",
    "2000 ; peterson et al .",
    "this factor can be empirically determined through comparison of @xmath6  inferred from @xmath1  and the reverberation mapping mass ( gebhardt et al .",
    "2000b ; ferrarese et al .",
    "2001 ; nelson et al . 2004 ; onken et al .  2004 ) .",
    "reverberation mapping also provides an empirical calibration between agn luminosity and blr radius , which may be combined with a blr velocity to yield a virial mass estimate ( e.g. ,  kaspi et al .",
    "this technique has been used widely in the literature ( e.g. ,  mclure & dunlop 2004 ) to study the cosmic evolution of bh mass density .",
    "in addition to secondary mass estimates for the bh , there is a secondary technique to estimate @xmath1  using the velocity dispersion of the ionized gas ( @xmath4 ) from the narrow - line region ( nlr ) .",
    "the nlr is in a privileged position in the galaxy : compact enough to be illuminated by the active nucleus and yet large enough to feel the gravitational forces of the bulge .",
    "early studies of integrated line profiles determined that gravity , not nuclear activity , dominates the global kinematics of the nlr ( wilson & heckman 1985 ; whittle  1992a , b ) .",
    "most recently , nelson & whittle ( 1996 ) find @xmath4  @xmath7 @xmath1  for a sample of 66 seyfert galaxies .",
    "these studies all measure the width of [ ]  @xmath8 because it is a strong and ubiquitous line .",
    "it seems that neither rotational support nor nuclear activity is important compared to pressure support for the nlr , so that @xmath4  can be used as a proxy for @xmath1 .",
    "of course , nlr gas velocity dispersion , particularly of the [ ]  line , is easier to measure for both active and distant objects .",
    "many subsequent studies have used the full - width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of [ ]  as a proxy for @xmath1 .",
    "nelson ( 2000 ) compares @xmath6  inferred from @xmath4  to reverberation - mapped masses , while boroson ( 2002 ) compares @xmath4  to virial masses estimated using the line width - luminosity relation .",
    "shields et al.(2003 ) compare the cosmic evolution of bh mass to the evolution of bulge velocity dispersion as inferred from @xmath4 , while both grupe & mathur ( 2004 ) and wang & lu ( 2001 ) investigate the bh mass distribution of narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies ( nls1s ) using @xmath4 .    despite the widespread use of @xmath4 , caution",
    "is in order . while , to first order , the nlr kinematics seem to be determined by gravity , the effects of the agn are also apparent .",
    "first of all , the [ ] line often has a broad blue wing ( heckman et al .",
    "1981 ; de robertis & osterbrock 1984 ; whittle 1985a ; wilson & heckman 1985 and references therein ) and whittle ( 1992b ) finds that powerful , compact linear radio sources have anomalously broad [ ]  lines . at least in some cases",
    "nuclear activity directly affects the nlr kinematics , and perhaps for these systems a different emission line , one originating farther from the central source , would be a better tracer of @xmath1 .",
    "it is also conceivable that rotation provides a significant source of support for the gas in some fraction of nlrs , thus lowering @xmath4relative to @xmath1 . in short ,",
    "it remains to be demonstrated with a large and homogenous data set that @xmath4  truly traces @xmath1 .",
    "the data for such a study are now readily available from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "2000 ; stoughton et al.2002 ) . using the database presented by brinchmann et al .",
    "( 2004a ) we directly compare @xmath4  and @xmath1  for a large sample of narrow - line agns from the sdss .",
    "in addition to the conventional [ ]  line , we consider the [ ]  @xmath9 and [ ]  @xmath10 doublets . while these lines are problematic due to blending , and are typically weaker than the [ ] line ,",
    "they are less contaminated by strong asymmetries ( as we show below ) .",
    "in addition , the [ ]  line is observable to higher redshift .",
    "ionized gas kinematics in the centers of galaxies is of broader interest than simply as a bh mass indicator .",
    "the structure and kinematics of the gas relative to the stars may provide clues about the dynamical history of the galaxy ( e.g. ,  sofue & rubin 2001 ) .",
    "in many cases , it seems that the gas rotates more slowly than the stars , in both elliptical ( e.g. , caldwell , kirshner , & richstone 1986 ; cinzano & van der marel 1994 ) and spiral galaxies ( fillmore , boroson , & dressler 1986 ; kent 1988 ; kormendy & westpfahl 1989 ; bertola et al.1995 ; fisher 1997 ; cinzano et al .",
    "1999 ) . as noted by many of these authors",
    ", this may indicate significant pressure support for the gas . on the other hand , vega beltrn et al .",
    "( 2001 ) find the gas in the centers of @xmath11 disk galaxies is moving on circular orbits in a cold disk .",
    "presumably , a variety of dynamical states are possible for the nuclear gas",
    ". it would be interesting to examine this question with a statistical sample such as sdss .",
    "in particular , is there anything special about the dynamical state of the ionized gas in agns ?",
    "we note that we are by no means the first to perform an analysis of this type .",
    "earlier studies have looked in detail at both the [ ] line shape as an indicator of the kinematics of the nlr and at the correlation of the line width with other nuclear and host properties ( for a review , see wilson & heckman 1985 and references therein ; nelson & whittle 1996 ) .",
    "the new aspect of this work is the large , homogenous sample considered .",
    "it is also , to our knowledge , the first systematic investigation of the behavior of the [ ]  and [ ]  line profiles .",
    "furthermore , this is the first systematic investigation of nlr kinematics since the discovery of the @xmath5  relation .",
    "not only does this provide new motivation for a better understanding of the @xmath4@xmath12@xmath1  relation , but it enables us to examine the kinematics of the nlr in relation to the physical properties of the agn .",
    "in particular , we find that the accretion rate of material onto the bh partially determines the kinematics of the nlr .",
    "the second data release ( dr2 ) of the sdss ( abazajian et al .",
    "2004 ) , with 375,000 galaxy spectra , enables us to compare nuclear gas and stellar kinematics with a large , homogeneous sample .",
    "the reader is referred to the project website for more details , as well as a complete bibliography for the survey .",
    "briefly , spectroscopic candidates are selected based on imaging in the @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 bands ( fukugita et al .  1996 ; smith et al.2002 ; strauss et al .",
    "2002 ) with a drift - scan camera ( gunn et al.1998 ) .",
    "spectra are acquired with a pair of fiber - fed spectrographs .",
    "each fiber subtends a diameter of @xmath18 , corresponding to @xmath19  kpc at @xmath20 .",
    "the spectra have an instrumental resolution of @xmath21 ( @xmath22 km s@xmath23 ) .",
    "integration times are determined for a minimum signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) of 4 at @xmath24 mag .",
    "the spectroscopic pipeline performs basic image calibrations , as well as spectral extraction , sky subtraction , removal of atmospheric absorption bands , and wavelength and spectrophotometric calibration ( stoughton et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "recently , the sdss team at mpa / jhu made publicly available their database of galaxy properties for 211,894 galaxies , including 33,589 narrow - line ( type 2 ) agns from dr2 .",
    "the sample selection and spectral treatment are discussed in detail in kauffmann et  al .",
    "( 2003a ) . like the main galaxy sample",
    ", the redshift distribution is strongly peaked at @xmath25 , and h@xmath26 is always present in the band .",
    "agns are selected based on their location in line intensity ratio diagnostic diagrams ( baldwin , phillips , & terlevich 1981 ; veilleux & osterbrock 1987 ; kauffmann et al .",
    "2003c ) after the stellar continuum is modeled and removed using stellar population synthesis models .",
    "their definition of agns is very inclusive .",
    "only objects solidly on the stellar locus are excluded , while low - ionization nuclear emission - line regions ( liners ; heckman 1980 ) and transition objects ( ho , filippenko , & sargent 1993 ) are included .",
    "the database includes the line intensities used to make the selection .",
    "they also make available stellar velocity dispersions , measured using a direct - fitting algorithm that assumes gaussian velocity profiles ( heckman et  al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "we selected our sample from this set of narrow - line agns . using the tabulated emission - line ratios",
    ", we use the line - ratio diagnostics outlined in ho , filippenko , & sargent ( 1997a ) to explicitly include only type 2 seyferts , excluding both liners and transition objects .",
    "this guarantees that the emission lines are dominated by agn light . as discussed in ho ( 2004 ) , the large physical scales subtended by the sdss fibers very likely includes substantial host galaxy emission , which presents a source of confusion for interpreting liners and transition objects .",
    "we further require [ ] , [ ] , and [ ]  to have a s / n per pixel greater than at least 3 in the line , and a measured stellar velocity dispersion .",
    "the mean equivalent widths ( ews ) for the resulting sample are 18 for [ ] , 20 for [ ] , and 4 for [ ] , the weakest line . in ",
    "3.4 we limit our sample to objects having only the highest - ew lines to examine how the s / n affects our results .",
    "we exclude all objects with @xmath1  below the nominal sdss instrumental resolution of @xmath27  km s@xmath23  ( as in heckman et al .",
    "we further exclude a handful of objects with @xmath1  @xmath28  km s@xmath23  as most likely unphysical ( 10 objects had @xmath1  @xmath29  km s@xmath23 )  @xmath28  km s@xmath23  ( sheth et al . 2003 ) . ] and 13 objects for which one of the line detections appeared marginal after manual inspection .",
    "this left a sample of 2050 objects .",
    "as described below , we also remove objects with double - peaked or unresolved line profiles , leaving a final sample of 1749 objects .",
    "the median redshift of the sample is @xmath25 , the same as the sdss in general .    throughout",
    "we assume the following cosmological parameters to derive distances : @xmath30  km s@xmath23  mpc@xmath23 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 .",
    "-5 mm -5 mm    -0.1 mm    we wish to compare the stellar and gas line widths for the entire agn sample .",
    "since the stellar velocity dispersions have been measured , we need only remove the stellar continuum and then measure the gas line widths . below we describe each of those steps .      in order to measure reliable line widths , the underlying stellar continuum must be removed .",
    "continuum variations can hide or mimic broad line wings and skew relative line intensity measurements . since the mpa / jhu database does not provide continuum - subtracted spectra",
    ", we have to repeat this step of the analysis .",
    "fortunately , the sdss survey provides a large and homogeneous library of pure absorption - line galaxies for use in continuum subtraction .",
    "we use a code that employs principal component analysis , kindly provided by lei hao ( hao et al .",
    "a library of hundreds of spectra is projected onto an orthogonal basis of eigenspectra .",
    "typically eight eigen - components are sufficient to provide an adequate model of the stellar spectrum . a power - law continuum and an a star spectrum",
    "may be included if necessary .",
    "there are many possible ways to parameterize emission - line profiles .",
    "some of the most common include the fwhm and the second moment of the line , defined to be    @xmath33    the line centroid is @xmath34 , @xmath35 is the flux density in the continuum - subtracted spectrum , and @xmath36 is in units of km s@xmath23 . for a pure gaussian",
    "the second moment is equal to @xmath36 and fwhm @xmath37 .",
    "( the second moment is directly comparable to the stellar velocity dispersion measurements , which assume a gaussian broadening function . )",
    "if to this original gaussian we added a broad , low - contrast gaussian to represent the line wings , the fwhm would increase slightly , by an amount depending on the contrast between the core and the wings .",
    "the second moment , on the other hand , is more sensitive to the presence of wings , and becomes significantly broader .",
    "for this reason , we get more information on the full line profile from the second moment .",
    "unfortunately , measurements of the second moment can be very sensitive to the s / n of the spectrum .",
    "therefore , we first fit a multi - component gaussian to the line profile , and then measure the second moment from the model profile , as described below .",
    "this technique has the further benefit of providing a decomposition of the core and wing components , so that we can examine the distribution of core and wing widths independently .",
    "after much experimentation , we find that the most reliable method , applicable to the majority of objects , is to fit each profile with two gaussians , one representing the line core and the other representing the line wing . the second component is fixed initially to be blueward of the central component , although in a subset of cases ( @xmath38 ) , a redshifted component was required for an acceptable fit .",
    "if the fit with a second component improves significantly ( at least @xmath39 increase in @xmath40 ) over the single - component fit , it is kept .",
    "we use this model to simultaneously fit the [ ]  @xmath414959 , 5007 lines , with their separation fixed and their relative strength constrained to the theoretical ratio of 3:1 .",
    "likewise , the [ ]  @xmath426716 , 6731 lines are fixed to the same profile , with their separation fixed to the laboratory value ; the ratio of the line intensities varies with density , and is allowed to vary in the fit . the [ ]  @xmath413726 , 3729 lines behave similarly , but the decomposition is more difficult because the expected line widths are comparable to the pair separation ( 2.8   or 225 km s@xmath23 ) . for this reason , we allow the line ratio to vary between 0.2 and 1.4 , the expected range for the typical densities observed in the nlr ( e.g. ,  osterbrock 1989 ) .",
    "sample fits are shown in figure 1 .",
    "as in previous studies , the majority of the line profiles are smooth , but a small percentage are lumpy , and some have two distinct peaks with comparable flux and line width .",
    "we find 31 of the 2050 ( @xmath43 ) objects with clearly defined double peaks ( fig .",
    "while we show below that in general the nlr is not rotationally dominated , we suspect that in these cases the nlr gas is predominantly organized into a disk . of course",
    ", bipolar outflows may also be responsible for the double - peaked lines . in any case , these objects are such clear outliers that we exclude them from further consideration .",
    "the observed @xmath36 is the convolution of the true line width and the instrumental response . to first order , the intrinsic line width can be approximated by @xmath44 . in the case of the sdss data ,",
    "@xmath45 varies not only as a function of wavelength , but also the location of the object on the plate and the temperature on the night of the observations .",
    "for this reason , the sdss pipeline measures the instrumental response using an arc lamp spectrum , and returns the resolution at every pixel .",
    "the mean values for this sample are @xmath46 km s@xmath23  for [ ] , @xmath47 km s@xmath23  for [ ] , and @xmath48 km s@xmath23for [ ] .",
    "when we remove the effects of instrumental resolution , some of the objects become unresolved .",
    "measurements below the resolution limit are not reliable , and so we remove all objects for which one or more of the lines in question is unresolved , leaving a total of 1749 objects .      the average formal error in @xmath4  is @xmath49 .",
    "however , this estimate neglects systematic effects , the two most serious of which are uncertainties in the continuum subtraction and component decomposition .",
    "the latter is only a concern in the case of [ ] , the only line that often requires a two - component fit . in some cases ,",
    "there is ambiguity as to the exact decomposition between these two .",
    "however , we do not believe errors in decomposition introduce any systematic bias .",
    "there are publicly available error estimates for the stellar velocity dispersions we are using .",
    "the median error is @xmath50 , or @xmath51 km s@xmath23  at the median @xmath1  @xmath52 km s@xmath23 .",
    "these uncertainties are small compared to the scatter in @xmath53 , the quantity central to our analysis in this paper .",
    "we can investigate the extent to which the scatter is due to measurement error by limiting the sample to a subset of high - ew objects for which the formal measurement errors are small .",
    "we limit the sample to the strongest @xmath54 objects for each line .",
    "we find no significant difference in either the mean value or the scatter around @xmath4  ( see entries in table 1 ) .",
    "this suggests that the scatter is dominated by intrinsic variations , rather than measurement errors . in the appendix",
    "we specifically examine the scatter introduced by rotational broadening .",
    "we find that it is also insufficient to account for the observed scatter .",
    "our findings are summarized in table 1 , which shows @xmath53  for each transition .",
    "our primary result is that the line widths of [ ]  and [ ]  track the stellar velocity dispersion in the mean , albeit with substantial scatter .",
    "the width of [ ] , on the other hand , is on average significantly broader than @xmath1 ; @xmath55}}$ ] can not be used directly as a tracer of @xmath1 . however , as we discuss below , the core of [ ]  does track @xmath1 .    the different behavior of the low - ionization lines compared to [ ] can be understood in terms of well - known variations in line shape as a function of critical density and ionization potential within the nlr ( e.g. ,  pelat , alloin , & fosbury 1981 ; filippenko & halpern 1984 ; filippenko 1985 ; de robertis & osterbrock 1986 ) .",
    "the nlr is stratified in density such that lines of higher critical density originate from closer to the nucleus . since the critical density of [ ]",
    "@xmath0 is higher than those of [ ]  @xmath2 and [ ]  @xmath56 ( osterbrock 1989 ) , in a density - stratified nlr we expect [ ]  to be broader than [ ]  and [ ] , whereas [ ]  and [ ]  should share similar line widths . as expected , we find that @xmath57}}/\\sigma_{\\mathrm{[o { \\tiny ii } ] } } \\rangle$ ] and @xmath58}}/ \\sigma_{\\mathrm{[s { \\tiny ii } ] } } \\rangle \\approx 1.2 \\pm 0.5 $ ] , while @xmath59}}/\\sigma_{\\mathrm{[o { \\tiny ii } ] } } \\rangle \\approx 1.0 \\pm 0.3 $ ] .",
    "this suggests that the [ ]  emission originates from closer to the nucleus than the other lines .",
    "as noted , our results suggest that the kinematics of low - ionization gas in the nlr is dominated by gravity , such that the velocity dispersion in the gas and stars are comparable . on the other hand , the [ ]",
    "line width is significantly broader than @xmath1 , suggesting that the active nucleus plays a significant role in governing the kinematics of the [ ] -emitting gas .",
    "taken at face value , this finding seems to contradict the conclusions of nelson & whittle ( 1996 ) , who have argued that the [ ]  line width is largely dominated by gravity .",
    "since the [ ]  profile is invariably asymmetric , characterized by a central core component plus a high - velocity blue wing , it is reasonable to suppose that the line core should have the closest affinity to any gravitationally dominated component .",
    "using our two - component gaussian fits to the [ ] profiles , we can directly compare the core velocity dispersion with @xmath1 .",
    "the result of this test is shown in the last column of table 1 .",
    "indeed , we find that when the blue wing is removed , the core of the [ ]  line statistically traces @xmath1 , again with significant scatter .",
    "this suggests that the low - velocity gas in the line core is gravitationally dominated , while the wing is more strongly influenced by the active nucleus .",
    "-0.1 mm -5 mm    we now look for secondary parameters to explain the deviations of @xmath4  for the [ ]  line compared to @xmath1 , which are plausibly related to either the active nucleus or the environment . looking at the correlation of these deviations with various indicators of nuclear activity may reveal useful information about the interaction of the nucleus with the nlr .",
    "we consider host galaxy morphology , local environment , star formation rate , and bulge stellar velocity dispersion as global variables . in terms of nuclear effects , we look at radio power , agn luminosity , and eddington ratio [ @xmath60 , where @xmath61  erg  s@xmath23  ( @xmath6/@xmath62 ) ] .",

    "the large , binned points represent the mean and standard deviation in the mean plotted at the bin center .    of additional interest is whether the characteristics of the blue wing correlate with any of the properties listed above . in order to investigate this question we looked at three wing diagnostics : the width of the blue wing , the flux ratio between the core and the wing , and the wavelength shift between the core and the wing .",
    "we found no strong correlations between any of the above quantities with either the nuclear or global variables .",
    "both gas and stellar kinematics in the central regions of galaxies may depend on hubble type .",
    "we can not derive robust morphologies directly from the sdss data because the resolution and depth are insufficient . however , shimasaku et al .  ( 2001 ) and strateva et al .",

    "if we allow each component to independently assume its maximum error , and examine the case where @xmath4  = @xmath1  = 150 km s@xmath23 , we infer that the observed @xmath4/@xmath1  may vary from 0.9 to 1.1 .",
    "we therefore conclude that rotational broadening contributes to , but can not fully account for , the observed scatter ."
