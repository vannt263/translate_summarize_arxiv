    "a first estimate comes from the bound @xcite @xmath76 when these two bounds coincide linear marginal stability holds .",

    "then , the bounds read @xmath86 the upper and lower bounds are identical to those for the speed of fronts of the parabolic equation parabolic equation ; the speed is given by @xmath87 the speed of the front is determined in terms of the speed of the parabolic front with the same reaction term , therefore the transition from linear to nonlinear marginal stability occurs at the same parameter values as for the parabolic case . the speed itself , however , is lower than the speed of the front of the parabolic equation , @xmath88      as a second example , which shows that substantially different behavior may occur , take the reaction function @xmath89 .",
    "the front of minimal speed for the parabolic equation is given by @xmath90 if we now consider the hyperbolic equation with @xmath91 , the upper and lower bounds coincide and the speed @xmath92 effectively we obtain @xmath93 the minimal speed is the linear marginal stability value , no transition from linear to nonlinear marginal stability occurs .",
    "a significant slowdown of the speed takes place .      in systems with time delayed diffusion",

    "so we have recovered the result that for concave functions with @xmath22 , linear marginal stability holds . as it occurs for the parabolic case .",
    "it may hold for noncave functions as well , fact which can be determined by use of the variational principle .",
    "consider again the reation term @xmath108 as in subsection * b*. in the parabolic equation transition from linear to nonlinear marginal stability occurs at @xmath109 .",

    "we chose as a trial function @xmath114 .",
    "the dot - dash line shows the lower bound imposed by the linear marginal stability value , the solid line the lower bound from the variational principle .",
    "the transition occurs at at @xmath113 as low as 1.6 at least .",
    "the precise transition value can be found by using a better trial function .",
    "the dashed line shows the upper bound , which guarantees that linear marginal stability holds for @xmath115 , values for which @xmath14 is concave .      the variational principle and the bounds obtained above hold for positive and bistable reaction systems , no assumption on the sign of @xmath14 is made in the derivations .",
    "we may therefore apply them to a bistable reaction term .",
    "we take as an example a case for the speed of the parabolic front can be determined exactly , @xmath116 the unique value of the speed for which a front exists is @xmath117 if @xmath83 a constant , the speed of the front is given by eq([constfi2 ] ) , and the exact speed is known with @xmath75 given above .    for this bistable reaction term , with @xmath118 , which is positive for @xmath119 , with a simple trial function @xmath120 , all integrals are elementary , we obtain , using eq.([var ] ) , @xmath121 numerical determination of the speed can be made with any desired accuracy by use of improved trial functions .",

    "bistable reaction terms , by definition , are not positive throughout the whole interval , so the hypothesis of their derivation is violated .",
    "we attribute the nearly perfect agreement between the speed of the front obtained from their ( nonapplicable ) variational principle to that obtained from direct numerical integration to a coincidence for the specific trial function chosen .",
    "it is not difficult to find an acceptable trial function , sharply peaked at the origin , for which the integrand of their variational expression , and so the speed , becomes complex .",
    "we have studied the speed of travelling fronts of hyperbolic reaction diffusion equations ( [ hypereq ] ) for reaction terms for which the parabolic reaction diffusion equation ( [ parab ] ) admits fronts . a variational principle for",
    "the speed of the fronts has been obtained for a wide class of systems .",
    "explicit upper and lower bounds , obtained from the variational expression allow one to characterize sytems for which marginal stability holds .",
    "we have seen that depending on the nonlinearities of the equation the range of validity of linear marginal stability , can be increased or decreased , compared to the comparable range for a parabolic equation with the same reaction term .",
    "the stability of the fronts has been proved for a limited class of such equations @xcite , numerical solutions have been explored for systems with memory effect .",
