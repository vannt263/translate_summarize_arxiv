    "in many cases , the nucleation of spatio - temporal patterns is associated with continuous symmetry breaking , and these patterns are thus very sensitive even to small perturbations or external fields .",
    "perturbations may be induced by imperfections of the system itself ( e.g. impurities ) , of the geometrical set - up ( e.g. the boundary conditions ) , of the control parameters , etc .",
    "in addition , external fields may induce spatial or temporal modulations of the control or bifurcation parameters .",
    "in fact , spatially or temporally modulated systems are very common in nature , and the effect of external fields on these systems has been studied for a long time . as a way of example , the forcing of a large variety of nonlinear oscillators , from the pendulum to van der pol or duffing oscillators , has led to detailed studies of the different temporal behaviors that can be obtained . it has been shown that resonant couplings between the forcing and the oscillatory modes may lead to several types of complex dynamical behaviors , including quasi - periodicity , frequency lockings , devil s staircases , chaos and intermittency @xcite .    in equilibrium systems , the importance of spatial modulations has been known for a long time .",
    "for example , in the case of spatial modulations occurring in equilibrium crystals , such as spin or charge density waves , the constraint imposed by the periodic structure of the host lattice leads to the now commonly known commensurate - incommensurate phase transitions .",
    "the transition from the commensurate phase , where the wavelength of the modulated structure is a multiple of the lattice constant , to the incommensurate one occurs via the nucleation of domain walls separating domains which are commensurate with the host lattice @xcite .    in nonequilibrium systems ,",
    "the systematic study of the influence of external fields on pattern forming instabilities is more recent .",
    "it has been first devoted to instabilities leading to spatial patterns .",
    "for example , the lowe - gollub experiment @xcite showed that , in the case of the electrohydrodynamic instability of liquid crystals , a spatial modulation of the bifurcation parameter may induce dis - commensurations , incommensurate wavelengths and domain walls . the similarities with",
    "analogous equilibrium phenomena rely on the fact that , close to this instability , the asymptotic dynamics is described by the minimization of a potential @xcite .    in the case of self - oscillatory systems , however , original effects occur as a consequence of the nonrelaxational character of the dynamics . in particular , for wave bifurcations , unstable standing waves or two - dimensional wave patterns may be stabilized by pure spatial or temporal modulations of suitable wavelengths or frequencies @xcite .",
    "the case of pure temporal modulations in oscillating extended systems has been considered theoretically @xcite and in experiments on chemical systems forced by periodic illumination @xcite .",
    "the study by coullet and emilsson of forced hopf bifurcations is based on amplitude equations of the scalar ginzburg - landau type .",
    "they considered periodic temporal modulations of frequency @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is an irreducible integer fraction , @xmath2 is the critical frequency of the hopf bifurcation , and @xmath3 is a small frequency shift .",
    "such forcings break the continuous time translation down to discrete time translations , and the corresponding amplitude equations become :    @xmath4    ( @xmath5 stands for the complex conjugate of @xmath6 ) . in the non forced case ( @xmath7 ) and for zero frequency shift ( @xmath8 ) this dynamical system is of the relaxational type for @xmath9 . in more general situations",

    "one of them is of phase type and occurs when @xmath14 is sufficiently negative . in this case ,",
    "competition between phase instability and forcing leads to the formation of stripes or hexagonal patterns , with their associated topological defects .",
    "if the forcing is decreased , these structures break down through spatio - temporal intermittency @xcite . on the other hand , in the phase stable regime",
    ", frequency locked solutions may undergo a variety of bifurcations when forcing is decreased , leading to oscillation , quasi - periodicity or chaos @xcite .",
    "the equivalence between the different frequency locked states makes possible the formation of stable inhomogeneous structures .",
    "these structures are composed of domains of the locked states separated by abrupt interfaces .",
    "nonrelaxational dynamics may induce interface motion and , in particular , the formation of @xmath11-armed spirals , each arm corresponding to a different frequency locked solution .",
    "these phenomena were studied in great detail by coullet and emilsson , for @xmath15 and @xmath16 , in one- and two - dimensional systems @xcite . the case @xmath17 has been considered theoretically in @xcite .",
    "experimentally , resonant phase patterns associated with frequency locking have been described for a periodic forcing of the belousov - zhabotinsky chemical reaction for @xmath16 @xcite and @xmath17 @xcite . for @xmath18 ,",
    "the existence of three armed rotating spirals in two - dimensional systems is only briefly mentioned in @xcite .",
    "experimental observations of frequency locking for @xmath18 are also briefly discussed in @xcite . in these experiments patterns with three - phase domains shifted by @xmath19",
    "are observed @xcite .",
    "it is the aim of this paper to study the case of resonant forcing for @xmath18 in more detail , and specially the transition from phase spirals to amplitude spirals .",

    "second , it presents original dynamical behavior in the excitable regime .",
    "this behavior presents interesting analogies with rayleigh - bnard convection in a rotating cell , described by three - mode dynamical models @xcite .",
    "third , it could be a useful framework for the interpretation of detailed experiments on the 3:1 resonant forcing of a chemical system @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the dynamical model and its uniform asymptotic solutions are presented in section [ sec : uniform ] .",
    "section [ sec : phaseapprox ] is devoted to the description of the dynamics in terms of phase equations .",
    "the properties and possible development of front and spiral solutions are discussed in section [ sec : fronts_spirals ] .",
    "numerical results , for one- and two - dimensional systems , are presented in section [ sec : numerical ] and conclusions are drawn in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "consider an extended system undergoing a hopf bifurcation at zero wavenumber , and subjected to a periodic temporal modulation of frequency @xmath20 . sufficiently close to the bifurcation , its dynamics may be reduced to the following complex ginzburg - landau equation @xcite : @xmath21 where @xmath22 ( the case @xmath23 follows by changing @xmath24 ) is proportional to the external field intensity .",
    "the other parameters are standard @xcite .",
    "we will restrict ourselves to this case of resonant forcing ( @xmath8 ) . a slightly off - resonant forcing",
    "is known to induce a richer dynamical behavior @xcite whose characterization for a spatially extended system is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we look now for uniform solutions . by dropping the spatial derivative terms ,",
    "the corresponding uniform equations are , in phase and amplitude variables ( @xmath25 ) :    @xmath26    if we look at the stationary solutions ( fixed points ) , eqs .",
    "( [ null ] ) give @xmath27 from where the amplitudes of the uniform solutions are given by : @xmath28.\\ ] ] such solutions exist provided that @xmath29 , with @xmath30 note that for @xmath31 these solutions exist for any nonvanishing forcing .",
    "we will consider the case of @xmath32 for which these solutions appear at a finite value of the forcing .",
    "once the amplitude is determined by ( [ rmm ] ) , the phase can be obtained from the stationary version of ( [ null ] ) : @xmath33 each value of @xmath34 gives rise to three solutions for the phase @xmath35 which only differ by a phase shift of @xmath19 .",
    "hence , for @xmath36 the system has six uniform solutions : @xmath37 corresponding to @xmath38 and @xmath39 corresponding to @xmath40 .",
    "a linear stability analysis shows that the @xmath41 are always linearly unstable whereas the @xmath42 are stable for @xmath43 .",
    "the three @xmath42 solutions are called the frequency locked solutions .",
    "these become oscillatory unstable ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 ) for @xmath46 in the range of forcing amplitudes @xmath47 where @xmath48 }     \\nonumber",
    "\\\\ \\gamma_2 & = & \\sqrt{\\mu(1+\\beta^2)/2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the case where the frequency locked solutions are stable , we can show that the system behaves as an excitable one : let us construct the nullclines of the dynamical system ( [ null ] ) , defined as the curves @xmath49 and @xmath50 , and represent them in figure [ fig : nulla ] , for @xmath51 , @xmath52 , or in figure [ fig : nullb ] , for @xmath53 , @xmath52 . in both figures , it is easy to see that the @xmath38 states ( labeled @xmath54 ) are unstable , while the @xmath40 states ( labeled @xmath55 ) are stable for small perturbations .",
    "however , for perturbations larger than a well defined threshold , the latter are unstable and the system makes an excursion in the phase space , before reaching another , equivalent , steady state . it is a form of excitability . for @xmath56 there are no fixed points of ( [ null ] ) and asymptotic solutions correspond to temporal oscillations of the limit cycle type . for @xmath57",
    "the limit cycle is a circle that becomes deformed for @xmath58 ( see figure [ fig : uniform ] ) . on increasing @xmath59 ,",
    "the period of the oscillations increases and diverges for @xmath60 .",
    "the stability of these oscillatory solutions can be better analyzed in the framework of phase equations that we will develop in the next section .",
    "the transition between locked and oscillatory states is similar to the andronov - van der pol bifurcation@xcite , that appears in several types of excitable systems@xcite .",
    "in fact , on decreasing the amplitude of the forcing , stable and unstable locked states merge via inverse saddle - node bifurcations which give rise to the birth of limit cycle oscillations .",
    "note that we have here three pairs of fixed points merging , instead of just one pair in classical cases .",
    "when @xmath59 approaches @xmath61 from below , the period of the oscillations diverges as @xmath62 showing some kind of critical slowing down . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath63 , small perturbations around the stable states decay , while sufficiently large perturbations put the system on an heteroclinic trajectory that goes from an stable fixed point to a different , but equivalent fixed stable point through the excitability threshold .",
    "the intensity of the perturbations leading to an heteroclinic trajectory decreases when @xmath59 approaches @xmath61 , and this phenomenon reflects a type of excitable regime .",
    "all these features can be analytically shown in the limiting case @xmath64 . in this limit , and taking into account that @xmath65 , the adiabatic elimination of the amplitude in ( [ null ] ) leads to the phase equation    @xmath66    from where the excitable stable steady states are given by @xmath67 and @xmath68 , and the three unstable steady states satisfy @xmath69 and @xmath70 , @xmath71 . in this case",
    "the threshold of the perturbation leading to excitability is thus given by :    @xmath72    equation ( [ eq10 ] ) describes a relaxational motion of a fictitious test particle in a potential @xmath73 where the potential is @xmath74 this potential picture gives a framework to describe the bifurcation at @xmath75 in the language of phase transitions . in the case",
    "@xmath56 the potential is unbounded and has no local minima . as a consequence ,",
    "the motion is such that the phase @xmath76 decreases monotonically and the test particle does not stop in any selected value of the angle . when considered modulus @xmath77 , the trajectory is a periodic one @xmath78 with a period @xmath79 which diverges as @xmath80 when @xmath81 with @xmath82 . as in mechanical problems",
    ", it is possible to define a probability density function , @xmath83 , for the angle variable as proportional to the time the particle spends in the neighborhood of any value of the angle ( in other words , the probability is inversely proportional to @xmath84 ) .",
    "this probability density function @xmath85 ) develops three peaks which sharpen as @xmath59 increases , indicating three preferred values for the angle .",
    "this shows that the characteristic time around each minimum increases for @xmath86 and actually it diverges as @xmath87 .",
    "however , for all values of @xmath56 , the dynamics is such that none of the preferred values for the angle is actually selected since the system moves continuously from one to another . in that sense",
    ", we can say that there is a dynamical restoring of the angular symmetry .",
    "the situation is quite different for @xmath63 . in this case",
    ", the potential @xmath88 develops local minima which , at lower order in @xmath89 are @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 .",
    "these minima correspond to the three frequency locked solutions .",
    "the relaxational motion in the potential is such that for each trajectory , and depending on the initial condition , the test particle selects asymptotically one of the local minima and the angular symmetry is now broken .",
    "the probability density function for that particular trajectory becomes a delta function centered around the selected value of the angle .",
    "for an ensemble of different initial conditions , the probability density function is a sum of three deltas , @xmath93 .    as usual ,",
    "the transition between the symmetric and the symmetry - broken phases can be characterized by an order parameter .",
    "for an angular variable , the order parameter should be some periodic function , such as the mean value of the sine , @xmath94 ( other periodic functions give similar results ) .",
    "for @xmath95 it is @xmath96 whereas for @xmath29 that average sets into one of three possible values corresponding to the selected phase .",
    "since its value in any phase is different from zero at @xmath75 , the order parameter changes discontinuously at the transition point and , following the standard notation , the transition can be classified as a first - order one . in this mean - field description , and according to the discussion above , the transition implies a critical slowing down with a characteristic time diverging with a exponent @xmath97 both below and above the transition point .",
    "equivalently , one can characterize the transition point @xmath75 by the fact that the frequency of the motion tends to zero continuously at that point and stays equal to zero for @xmath98 . in an extended system",
    ", one could observe coexistence of the three phases at different locations in space , as described later in figure [ fig : snapscasei ] .",
    "furthermore , in any finite system , there is no true phase transition and the sharp behavior predicted by this simple mean - field analysis gets smeared out and the delta - type probability density functions for @xmath63 have a finite width .",
    "evidence of this fact is given later from our numerical simulations ( see the lower row of figure [ fig : phaseportrait ] ) .",
    "in this section we present several phase equations each one valid in a different region of parameters .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , phase equations can be used to analyze the stability of the uniform patterns .      in the oscillatory regime ( @xmath56 ) , the phase dynamics can be obtained by perturbing the uniform solution @xmath99 , and writing @xmath100 , @xmath101 . following hagan @xcite , the adiabatic elimination of the amplitude perturbations in the regime @xmath102 leads to the following phase dynamics : @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the period of the oscillations , and @xmath105    for @xmath106 , one recovers the usual burgers equation    @xmath107    with @xmath108 .",
    "hence , in the regime where @xmath109 , stable ( phase ) spiral waves may be expected , with wavenumber proportional to @xmath110 , and thus depending on the characteristics of the oscillations @xcite . in this regime , the qualitative behavior and interaction between these topological defects should thus be almost insensitive to the forcing @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in the regime where @xmath111 , defect mediated turbulence should also be expected @xcite . in the oscillatory regime ,",
    "the system presents thus qualitatively the same complexity and the same spatio - temporal behaviors than self - oscillating systems .",
    "only quantitative aspects are affected by the forcing .      in the excitable regime @xmath63 , and the phase dynamics",
    "can be obtained in the limit @xmath112 , @xmath113 by eliminating adiabatically the amplitude of the field .",
    "taking into account that , in this regime , @xmath114 and @xmath115 , we are left with the following phase equation :    @xmath116    besides the homogeneous solutions discussed in the previous section , this equation admits front solutions connecting stable states asymptotically at @xmath117 . in the case @xmath118 the phase equation is relaxational and the fronts connect two states with the same value of the potential and are , therefore , stationary . in the case",
    "@xmath119 , the phase equation is still relaxational but now the steady states have different value of the potential and the front moves .",
    "moreover , when @xmath120 there is a purely nonpotential induced front motion .",
    "equation ( [ phasedyn ] ) will be used in the next section as the starting point to compute the velocity of the front solution .    in order to study pattern forming instabilities , we can use ( [ phasedyn ] ) in the limit of small @xmath121 . expanding the @xmath122 up to linear order in @xmath121 , we are led to a damped kuramoto - sivashinsky phase equation  @xcite .",
    "it follows that frequency locked solutions are stable for @xmath123 .",
    "if @xmath124 , a pattern forming instability of the locked states would occur for  @xcite and @xmath125 after eq .",
    "( 28 ) . ]",
    "@xmath126    since , in this regime , @xmath63 , a necessary condition for this instability is thus    @xmath127    and this condition can not be realized in the @xmath128 domain .",
    "therefore , the frequency locked solutions are stable so that pattern forming instabilities are ruled out within the phase approximation .",
    "it is also possible to prove that the locked solutions are always stable in the limit of large forcings  @xcite .",
    "for @xmath29 , the forced ginzburg - landau equation possesses three equivalent excitable steady states . the excitability mechanism described in the previous section provides a natural way of building fronts between these steady states . despite the equivalence of the fixed points , such fronts are expected to move , as a result of the nonpotential character of the dynamics .",
    "consider a front solution of eq .",
    "( [ phasedyn ] ) , e.g. @xmath129 , joining the states 1 ( at @xmath130 ) and 2 ( at @xmath131 ) , such that @xmath132 .",
    "its velocity may be computed along the standard procedures , and is such that ( at leading order in perturbation )    @xmath133    hence , for @xmath134 , the fronts @xmath135 , @xmath136 and @xmath137 move to the right , while the fronts @xmath138 , @xmath139 and @xmath140 move to the left .",
    "hence , any domain of one steady state , embedded in a domain of another one , either expands or shrinks , leaving the system in one steady state ( domains of 2 embedded into 1 , 3 into 2 and 1 into 3 shrink while domains of 1 into 2 , 2 into 3 and 3 into 1 expand ) . however , a succession ( from left to right ) of domains with states in the order 1 , 2 , 3 , 1 , etc .",
    "moves as a whole to the right . when it is in the order 1 , 3 , 2 , 1 , etc .",
    ", it moves as a whole to the left ( see figure [ fig : phase1d ] ) .      in two - dimensional systems ,",
    "straight linear fronts have the same behavior as in one - dimensional systems .",
    "furthermore , sets of two inclined fronts separating domains with different steady states also move away or annihilate , leaving the system in one steady state only ( see figure [ fig:2dfronts ] ) .    new phenomena",
    "may arise when the three steady states coexist in the system . in this case , three fronts , which separate the respective domains , coalesce in one point ( a vertex ) .",
    "the three fronts are expected to rotate around this point .",
    "the result is a rotating spiral whose angular velocity increases with the forcing amplitude .",
    "spirals corresponding to sequences of states in the order @xmath141 or @xmath142 around the center have opposite senses of rotation .",
    "isolated vertices remain immobile , but non - isolated ones have a dynamical evolution induced by mutual interactions , which may even lead to the annihilation of counter - rotating spirals .",
    "this dynamical behavior is illustrated by the results of the numerical analysis presented in the next section .",
    "the situation is similar to that observed in system with competing fields .",
    "for example , in the context of fluid dynamics , a three mode model has been proposed to study rayleigh - bnard convection in a rotating cell  @xcite .",
    "the fields represent the amplitudes of three set of convection rolls oriented @xmath143 at each other . in the two - dimensional system",
    ", vertices may form when the three different types of roll domains meet at one point ( notice that this is not possible in one dimensional systems  @xcite ) .",
    "then , the nonpotential dynamics induces the rotation of the interfaces around the vertices preventing the system from coarsening . at long time scales ,",
    "the vertices diffuse throughout the system .",
    "in this section , we present numerical results in two spatial dimensions which illustrate the various dynamical regimes described in the preceding sections .",
    "we have solved numerically the forced cgle in two spatial dimensions by using a pseudospectral method with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we discretize the system in a square mesh of @xmath144 points .",

    "[ numericalcases ] we summarize the parameters chosen for each of the cases studied .",

    "as expected  @xcite , spiral defects surrounded by shock lines occur when there is no forcing .",
    "when the strength of the forcing @xmath59 is increased , but still being below the critical value @xmath61 ( oscillatory regime ) , the phase dynamics does not change significantly .",
    "however , amplitude spirals appear in the modulus of the field .",
    "the splitting of the phase into three locked states is observed approximately at the predicted theoretical value of the forcing @xmath61 . for a value of the forcing parameter",
    "slightly greater than @xmath61 , we observe annihilation of vertices until an homogeneous state is reached . for values of @xmath59 close to @xmath61 the motion of the walls can be very slow with patterns that might look stationary in short time scales of observation . for larger values of the forcing parameter ,",
    "the nonrelaxational dynamics is able to stop vertex annihilation and therefore the coarsening process .",
    "the system remains in a self - sustained dynamical state dominated by three - armed rotating spirals .",
    "motivated by the way in which experimental data for 2:1 or 4:1 resonant forcing is presented in @xcite , we show in figure [ fig : phaseportrait ] a phase portrait in the complex plane of @xmath6 , obtained from the snapshots shown in figure [ fig : snapscasei ] .",
    "we also include the corresponding histograms for the values of the phase of @xmath6 .",

    "effectively , at @xmath57 , one observes typical phase spirals associated with the monotonic phase variations . in this case",

    "when @xmath59 increases , the phase variable spends an increasing amount of time around the precursors of the locked states , as reflected in the histograms of fig .",

    "this manifests itself in the appearance of fuzzy three armed patterns around vertices of the modulus of the field @xmath6 ( see for example fig.[fig : snapscasevi ] ) . for @xmath59",
    "slightly larger than @xmath61 the system has undergone the transition form oscillatory to locked behavior and one may observe spirals generated by fronts between different stable steady states of the system .",

    "the bifurcation occurring at @xmath75 can be described , in a mena field approximation , as a first order phase transition between a motion in which the temporal average of the phase is zero ( @xmath56 ) to one with a nonzero average phase ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "we have given a phase approximation description of both regimes for a spatially extended system .",
    "like in the @xmath15 and @xmath16 cases of strongly resonant forcings , a form of excitability may also be observed .",
    "however , contrary to the @xmath15 and @xmath16 cases , no pattern forming instability of the frequency locked states occurs , in this case , for parameter values for which the phase approximation is valid . due to the nonrelaxational character of the dynamics , fronts between equivalent steady states move .",
    "the result is that , when the three equivalent steady states coexist in the system , three armed rotating spirals are generated around vertices where the fronts separating each domain meet .",
    "hence , we predict a transition from one - armed phase spirals to three - armed excitable amplitude spirals , which occurs when the forcing amplitude passes through a critical value @xmath61 . we have confirmed and described this transition by numerical analysis of the corresponding complex ginzburg landau equation for different parameter values which correspond to qualitatively different regimes of the phase diagram of this equation when there is no forcing .",
    "there are a number of analogies of our results for @xmath63 and the spatiotemporal patterns observed in a model of rotating rayleigh - bnard convection @xcite . in the latter case",
    "the domains correspond to sets of paralell convection rolls with a certain orientation and the vertices to points at which fronts separating domains of three preferred orientatons meet . as in the case studied here , the rotation of interfaces around vertices , due to nonrelaxational dynamics , produce rotating three armed spirals .",
