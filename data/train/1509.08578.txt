    "the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking ( s@xmath4sb ) is one of the most important features of the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) in the low - energy region . in the vacuum",
    "the s@xmath4sb is driven by the non - vanishing chiral condensate , @xmath5 , which is expected to change at non - vanishing temperature and/or density .",
    "studying hadron properties in such an extreme environment will provide some clues to understand more about qcd .",
    "several literatures  @xcite showed that , in the high density region , there emerges a phase in which the chiral symmetry is broken by the inhomogeneous chiral condensate , i.e. the value of the @xmath6 depends on the position such as in the dual chiral density wave ( dcdw ) or the chiral density wave ( cdw ) .",
    "recently , ref .",
    "@xcite showed that , using a hadronic effective model , the cdw is realized at the hadron level in the density region about @xmath7 times of the normal nuclear matter density .",
    "furthermore , using a model of the skyrme - crystal type , ref .",
    "@xcite pointed a similarity between the dcdw and the half - skyrmion phase , where the chiral symmetry is broken by an inhomogeneous condensates , and that the phase transition occurs at about twice of the normal matter density .",
    "the inhomogeneous condensate in the density region about twice of the normal nuclear matter density , if exists , could be checked by the risp experiment planned in korea .",
    "so it is very interesting to study the changes of the hadron properties caused by such an inhomogeneous condensate .    in refs .",
    "@xcite , we proposed to use the heavy - light mesons such as @xmath8 mesons composed of one anti - charm quark @xmath9 and one light quark @xmath10 ( up quark or down quark ) as probes to explore the phase with an inhomogeneous condensate such as the dcdw .",
    "there are several works which study the properties of the heavy - light mesons in the nuclear matter by using hadronic models based on , e.g. , a heavy meson effective model based on the heavy quark symmetry  @xcite , and a model with @xmath11 symmetry  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we pointed out that the existence of spin - isospin correlation in nuclear matter causes the mixing among heavy - light mesons having different spins .",
    "then , by using an effective hadron model based on the heavy quark symmetry and the chiral symmetry , it was shown that @xmath12 and @xmath13 mesons mix with each other in spin - isospin correlated nuclear matter such as in the dcdw . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the analysis was extended to include the @xmath14 and @xmath15 mesons as chiral partners to @xmath16 and @xmath13 mesons  @xcite , and the mass spectra of the charmed mesons in the half - skyrmion phase were studied .    in this paper , we study the dispersion relations for @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , which we collectively call `` @xmath17 mesons '' , in the dcdw by regarding @xmath18 and @xmath19 as the chiral partners to each other .",
    "it should be noted that we do not use `` @xmath20 mesons '' but use `` @xmath17 mesons '' in the present work , since `` @xmath20 mesons '' include anti - light quarks which provide annihilation processes .",
    "then , we assume that the `` @xmath17 mesons '' pick up the effect of nuclear matter only mediated by the exchange of mesons made of light quarks . here",
    "we introduce interactions of the `` @xmath17 mesons '' with a matrix field @xmath21 ( @xmath22 is the pauli matrix ) including a scalar meson ( @xmath23 ) and pions ( @xmath24 ) , which transforms linearly under the chiral symmetry .",
    "we replace the field @xmath25 with its classical configuration in the dcdw , and regard the configuration as a potential for the `` @xmath17 mesons '' .",
    "since the potential in the dcdw is periodic in a space direction , we employ the bloch s theorem in order to obtain the dispersion relations for `` @xmath17 mesons '' .",
    "our results show that all the modes have a group velocity opposite to the momentum in the low - momentum region .",
    "furthermore , the minimum of the energy is realized when the magnitude of the momentum is equal to the wave number of the density wave .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec  [ sec : lagrangianwithpion ] , we introduce an effective lagrangian for the `` @xmath17 mesons '' interacting with pions in the relativistic form . in sec  [ sec : eoms ] , we derive the equation of motions of `` @xmath17 mesons '' in the presence of the dcdw background in the matrix form . in sec  [ sec : dispersions ] , we show the dispersion relations for `` @xmath17 mesons '' . in sec  [ sec : discussionandsummary ] , we give a summary and discussions .",
