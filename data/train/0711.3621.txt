    "during a stochastic evolution of gibbs measures for spin systems various things can happen . in @xcite the authors considered ising - spin systems starting from an initial gibbs measure @xmath2 and evolving under a spin - flip dynamics ( high - temperature glauber dynamics ) towards a reversible gibbs measure @xmath8 , both having a finite - range interaction .",
    "they show that in this transient regime the evolved measure @xmath9 stays gibbsian if either @xmath4 is small , or if both @xmath2 and @xmath10 are at high or infinite temperature .",
    "it can lose the gibbs property after some time @xmath4 if the initial measure is at low temperature and zero or small magnetic field and @xmath10 is at high or infinite temperature .",
    "the gibbs measure property is also shown to be recovered after some time if the initial measure @xmath2 has a non - zero magnetic field . in some sense",
    "the initial external field will be compensated by a dynamic field , causing a hidden phase transition which makes the evolved measure non - gibbs . for large enough time when the dynamic field is too weak to do this ,",
    "there is re - entrance into the gibbsian regime again .",
    "thus in that case the evolved measure is gibbsian if the time is either small or large enough .",
    "le ny and redig generalized in @xcite the result for small times @xmath4 to more general dynamics . they consider spin systems with spins in @xmath11 and prove that gibbsianness stays conserved when the system evolves under a more general local stochastic dynamics such as kawasaki or mixtures of glauber and kawasaki dynamics .",
    "the case of an infinite - temperature dynamics leads to the question of whether an effective temperature can be defined @xcite in the transient regime , or , in a different interpretation , how reliable noisy observations are , see e.g. @xcite or @xcite .",
    "the last type of questions lead to the study of so - called `` hidden markov fields '' .",
    "another gibbsian question of interest for discrete spins with discrete - time dynamics is the study of pca s ( probabilistic cellular automata ) in @xmath12 dimensions .",
    "their stationary measures are projections of space - time gibbs measures for a hamiltonian obtained by the pca in @xmath13 dimensions in the stationary case . in @xcite",
    "the authors prove the converse direction that all translation invariant or periodic stationary measures correspond to gibbs measures on space - time histories for the pca on a space @xmath14 .",
    "what is known about the situation for continuous spins ?",
    "deuschel in @xcite and later roelly , zessin and coauthors investigated in @xcite and @xcite gibbs measures of interacting diffusions indexed by lattice sites on @xmath0 .",
    "first deuschel described the law @xmath15 of the entire infinite - dimensional unbounded process @xmath16 as a space - time gibbs measure with state space @xmath17)^{{\\mathbb{z}}^d}$ ] when the initial distribution @xmath2 is gibbsian .",
    "then roelly , zessin and coauthors showed a bijection between the set of initial gibbs measures associated to an initial interaction on @xmath18 and the set of gibbs measures on the path space describing the full dynamics , see @xcite . in @xcite dereudre and",
    "roelly considered a problem which is close to the one we study , namely the gibbsianness in the transient regime for the time evolution of unbounded continuous spins under high - temperature dynamics with bounded interactions .",
    "they start with the gibbs representation of @xmath15 on the path level and look at the projections at time @xmath4 of the law @xmath15 .",
    "then they prove that if the initial measure obeys a strong uniqueness condition , then either for small times or if the dynamical interaction is weak enough , gibbsianness propagates for bounded initial and dynamical interaction .",
    "that means that the time - evolved measure is again a gibbs measure for continuous spins and an absolutely summable interaction .",
    "another case of unbounded continuous spins was treated by klske and redig in @xcite where the authors also consider the time evolution of continuous unbounded spin models under infinite - temperature dynamics and _ unbounded _ interaction ( compared to roelly and dereudre who consider a bounded one ) .",
    "they prove that ( similar to the result of @xcite for discrete spins ) for continuous unbounded spins the time - evolved measure stays gibbsian for small times but loses this property for @xmath4 large if the initial measure is a low - temperature measure .",
    "in contrast to the discrete - spin situation the gibbsian property can not be recovered again .",
    "the initial gibbs measure is gibbsian for a hamiltonian with a quadratic nearest neighbour interaction and an a priori single - site double well potential that has a specific form .",
    "this particular form of the interaction term allows an explicit analysis .",
    "their definition of a gibbsian measure is weaker than the dlr definition imposing an absolutely summability condition on the interaction like @xcite . in the case of unbounded spins",
    "it seems more natural to weaken the assumptions on the interaction since absolutely summability does not even allow gaussian fields .",
    "in this paper we consider continuous but compact spins living on a circle @xmath19 .",
    "we investigate the gibbsian property of the system first for small times @xmath4 and arbitrary initial gibbs measures @xmath2 under different dynamics and then for small inverse initial temperature and arbitrary times .",
    "the purpose of the third section will be to show that the time - evolved measure @xmath5 is gibbsian for small @xmath4 under infinite- or high - temperature dynamics and arbitrary - temperature initial gibbs measure , and for any @xmath4 for high- or infinite - temperature dynamics starting in a high- or infinite - temperature initial measure .",
    "we follow and in our case can simplify the approach of @xcite . like in their approach",
    "we will get the time - evolved measure from projecting the path - space measure @xmath15 at time @xmath4 . in the fourth section we prove that the gibbs property will be lost after some time @xmath4 for a low - temperature initial measure and infinite - temperature dynamics , somewhat similarly to the situation in @xcite for the classical nearest neighbour plane rotor in @xmath7 with zero external initial field .",
    "this may seem slightly surprising , since the ( translation - invariant ) gibbs measure is unique at all temperatures ( and in all homogeneous external fields ) . in our opinion",
    "the advantage of working with compact spins , next to the technical simplifications , is that the notion of gibbsianness for a `` reasonable '' class of interaction is much less ambiguous .",
    "see e.g. the discussion in @xcite .",
    "closely related results have been obtained by klske and opoku @xcite via a different approach using dobrushin uniqueness techniques .",
    "the authors investigate short - time behaviour of spins moving on @xmath20 and evolving with infinite - temperature dynamics .",
    "we introduce some definitions and notations .",
    "the state space of one continuous spin is the circle , @xmath19 .",
    "we identify the circle with the interval @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are considered to be the same points .",
    "thus the configuration space @xmath24 of all spins is isomorphic to @xmath25 .",
    "we endow @xmath24 with the product topology and natural product measure @xmath26 . in our case",
    "we take @xmath27 .",
    "an interaction @xmath28 is a collection of @xmath29-measurable functions @xmath30 from @xmath31 to @xmath32 where @xmath33 is finite .",
    "@xmath29 is the @xmath34-algebra generated by the canonical projection on @xmath35 .",
    "the interaction @xmath28 is said to be of * finite range * if there exists a @xmath36 s.t .",
    "@xmath37 implies @xmath38 and it is called * absolutely summable * if for all @xmath39 , @xmath40 .",
    "we call @xmath10 a * gibbs measure * associated to a reference measure @xmath41 and interaction @xmath28 if the series @xmath42 converges ( @xmath28 is absolutely summable ) and @xmath10 satisfies the dlr equations for all @xmath39 :    @xmath43    where @xmath44 is the partition function .",
    "we omit the inverse temperature @xmath45 here , because in this section we deal with arbitrary initial inverse temperature .",
    "the set of all gibbs measures associated to @xmath28 and @xmath41 is denoted by @xmath46 ( resp .",
    "@xmath47 if we want to make the @xmath45 dependence clear ) .",
    "furthermore we say an interaction @xmath28 satisfies * a high - temperature dobrushin condition * if it is absolutely summable and @xmath48 we will also refer to such an interaction as a _ high - temperature interaction _ and use the fact that if an interaction satisfies the condition above it follows that @xmath49 , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "now , instead of working with gibbs measures on @xmath25 we will first investigate gibbs measures as space - time measures on the path space @xmath50 . in @xcite deuschel introduced and descibed infinite - dimensional diffusions as gibbs measures on the path space @xmath17)^{{\\mathbb{z}}^d}$ ] when the initial distribution is gibbsian .",
    "this approach was later generalized by @xmath51 who showed that there exists a one - to - one correspondence between the set of initial gibbs measures and the set of path - space measures @xmath15 .",
    "+ more precisely , let @xmath52 be the solution of the following stochastic differential equation ( sde ) @xmath53 where @xmath2 will be the initial gibbs measure , @xmath54 associated to some initial interaction @xmath55 which is supposed to be of finite range and at least @xmath56 .",

    "basically @xmath60 describes the position of the rotor spin at site @xmath39 at time @xmath4 , it takes values in @xmath61 for every event @xmath62 .",
    "+ the interaction part of the stochastic dynamics of this process is hidden in the drift term of the sde , namely in the gradient of the hamiltonian @xmath63 .",
    "the underlying dynamical interaction @xmath28 is also assumed to be of finite range and at least @xmath56 so that the gibbs measures for it are transient and reversible .",
    "we will refer to different temperatures for the dynamics .",
    "what we mean by that is the following : let the gibbs measure @xmath2 converge towards a reversible gibbs measure @xmath10 .",
    "then we say the dynamics is low , high or infinite temperature if the corresponding infinite - time measure @xmath10 is a low- , high- or infinite - temperature gibbs measure .",
    "since the spins are compact , this implies that the derivatives are automatically bounded .",
    "the assumptions on @xmath2 and @xmath28 provide the existence of a strong markovian solution @xmath64 of the above system @xmath65 .",
    "let furthermore @xmath15 denote the law of the solution @xmath64 on @xmath66 with initial distribution @xmath2 .",
    "+ we first note that the initial gibbs measure @xmath2 is a mixture of extremal gibbs measures from the set @xmath67 , see also the representation theorem ( theorems 7.12 and 7.26 in @xcite ) .",
    "note that in general the mixture of @xmath68 under a measure @xmath69 is given by @xmath70 .",
    "this means that if @xmath10 is an extremal element of @xmath71 , then there exists a @xmath72 such that    @xmath73    where @xmath74 is the finite - volume gibbs measure with fixed boundary condition @xmath75 .",

    "the term @xmath99 can also be viewed as the single - site drift term of the brownian motions moving on the circle .",
    "the system will be defined as follows @xmath100 and for @xmath101 @xmath102 for long times the role of the inverse temperature @xmath45 will be important , so we include it into the definition of the process .",

    "let @xmath455 and let us look at the set @xmath516 .",
    "this is the set of all configurations which correspond to a raise of energy by the amount of @xmath456 away from the ground state .",
    "clearly this set splits into two disjoint measurable sets @xmath510 and @xmath511 , since we have exactly two ground states @xmath454 and @xmath453 .",
    "this splitting is also * stable * in the sense of georgii , because two elements can only coincide on an edge of @xmath490 if they come from one of the sets @xmath510 or @xmath511 ( spins in @xmath510 point to the right and those in @xmath511 point to the left ) .",
    "let @xmath517 , for @xmath518 or @xmath519 , be the reflections of @xmath490 with respect to the hyperplanes @xmath520 .",
    "let @xmath136 be a configuration on @xmath521 and let @xmath522 .",
    "georgii constructs a graph @xmath523 in the following way .",
    "the vertices @xmath524 are those sites for which @xmath525 the set @xmath526 ( resp .",
    "@xmath527 ) is the reflected set @xmath184 through the vertical ( resp .",
    "horizontal ) line at @xmath468 .",
    "similarly , @xmath528 denotes the set @xmath184 after being reflected first horizontally and then vertically . for a graph built on @xmath510 ,",
    "it means we collect @xmath219 for which @xmath529 and for @xmath511 the graph is the same up to an @xmath530-reflection .",
    "this implies that each cluster @xmath475 of the graph @xmath476 is a cluster @xmath531 of @xmath532 or @xmath533 .",
    "therefore the event that there exists a unique infinite cluster splits into a disjoint union of events that this infinite cluster appears in either @xmath510 or @xmath511 , namely @xmath534 where @xmath535 denotes the disjoint union .",
    "the splitting is also symmetric because of the simple relation @xmath536 ( we have defined @xmath530 as the reflection w.r.t . the horizontal line at @xmath537 ) .",
    "thus it follows that for @xmath538 @xmath539 and in particular that @xmath540 . since we know from the previous lemma that for @xmath45 large enough @xmath541 we have a fortiori @xmath542 which allows us to build conditional probabilities @xmath543 resp .",
    "@xmath544 which are orthogonal since @xmath545 and @xmath546 are disjoint .",
    "the gibbsianness of @xmath547 and @xmath515 follows from the fact that @xmath545 ( resp .",
    "@xmath546 ) belongs to the tail @xmath34-field @xmath548 .",
    "this is because the sets @xmath545 ( resp .",
    "@xmath546 ) are invariant under translations @xmath549 , @xmath550 , where @xmath549 denotes the translation by @xmath39 .",
    "we have proved that the discrete symmetry @xmath530 is broken since there are at least two distinct gibbs measures @xmath547 and @xmath515 .",
    "@xmath217    * remark : * the above transition is one of the so - called spin - flop type .",
    "in this section we d like to discuss what kind of generalizations of our results will hold . in our first class of results , the conservation of gibbsianness , the restriction to finite - range potentials could be weakened , and also one could obtain results for @xmath210-component spins for general @xmath551 . for some developments in this direction , using dobrushin uniqueness techniques , see @xcite .",
    "a more sensitive question is about the loss of the gibbsian property . although we have given the proof for the loss of gibbsianness for the standard interaction in 2 dimensions , where the initial gibbs state is presumably unique at all temperatures , the same arguments apply for other models , such as the nearest - neighbour polynomial nonlinear models in 2 dimensions considered in @xcite .",
    "an extension to the three - dimensional lattice is also immediate .",
    "in fact , because there is long - range order for any strength of the alternating magnetic field including zero , the non - gibbsianness holds for all times larger than a certain @xmath552 in that case .",
    "also the statement is true for any initial translation - invariant ( pure or not ) gibbs measure , of which there are known to be infinitely many @xcite .",
    "increasing the spin - dimension , and considering @xmath210-component spins is less immediate . in @xmath7 ,",
    "our proof breaks down . in @xmath553",
    "however , a ferromagnet in a small alternating field displays continuous symmetry - breaking in the plane perpendicular to the field @xcite . a slight modification of our argument",
    "then will lead to non - gibbsian behaviour .",
    "a more serious limitation in our proof is that we used reflection positivity in our proof of the phase transition .",
    "this restricts the initial interactions quite severely ( it should be a c - potential ( generalized nearest - neighbor potential ) , or a pair interaction of very specific form , and the dynamics needs to be an infinite - temperature one .",
    "to get rid of this limitation , one might hope to apply a pirogov - sinai type of approach .",
    "dobrushin and zahradnik @xcite have obtained pirogov - sinai results for continuous spins . however",
    ", their conditions ( quadratic interactions with general single - site potentials having gaussian minima ) do not directly apply .",
    "one might hope that their ideas could be modified to include our set - up ; however , till now this has not been done .",
