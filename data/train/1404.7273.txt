    "the early stages of evolution of low - mass stars are relatively well characterised by the formation of a system with a central protostar , accreting material from a rotating accretion disk at scales of a few hundreds of astronomical units ( au ) , and simultaneously ejecting a collimated outflow with the presence and crucial role of magnetic fields .",
    "accretion and mass - loss processes , two closely related mechanisms , govern the formation of low - mass stars ( e.g. , girart , rao & marrone 2006 ; mckee & ostriker 2007 ; machida , inutsuka & matsumoto 2008 ; armitage 2011 ; williams & cieza 2011 ) .",
    "spatio - kinematical studies of jets and herbig - haro ( hh ) objects show that outflows from low - mass young stellar objects ( ysos ) are non - steady , but presenting variability in the ejection velocity as well as pulsed events , probably related to recurrent instabilities in the accretion disks ( e.g. , zinnecker , mccaughrean & rayner 1998 ; reipurth & bally 2001 ; estalella et al . 2012 ) . with respect to the formation of massive stars ( @xmath10 10  m@xmath7 ) , there are several examples showing the presence of massive disk - protostar - jet systems at scales of thousand au ( in some cases with magnetic fields oriented parallel to the collimated outflows ) , indicating that stars at least up to @xmath220  m@xmath7 form via an accretion disk as low - mass do ( e.g. , patel et al . 2005 ; jimnez - serra et al . 2007 ; torrelles et al . 2007 ; davies et al . 2010 ; carrasco - gonzlez et al .",

    "furthermore , variation in the ejection velocity of outflows as well as remarkable short - lived episodic ejection events ( few tens of years ) have been reported towards massive ysos through radio continuum ( e.g. , mart et al 1995 ; curiel et al .",
    "2006 ) and h@xmath0o maser spatio - kinematical observations ( e.g. , torrelles et al . 2001 , 2003 ; surcis et al .",

    "; sanna et al . 2012 ; kim et al . 2013 ; trinidad et al .",
    "this indicates that outflows in massive ysos are also non - steady , probably due to instabilities in the accretion processes as in the case of low - mass ysos .",
    "mainly because most of the observational efforts have been concentrated in low- and high - mass ysos , little is known on what happens in intermediate - mass protostars , with only a few examples showing clear disk - yso - jet systems at scales of a few hundred au ( e.g. , palau et al .",

    "2012b ) , but up to now without any observational information on the magnetic field and outflow kinematical behaviour at these small scales .",
    "observations of the first stages of the evolution of intermediate - mass ysos at small scales are therefore important to fill that gap , and thus to have a more complete vision about the processes of star formation throughout a more continuous range of masses . in this paper",
    ", we present multi - epoch very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) h@xmath0o maser observations towards intermediate - mass ysos to study the spatio - kinematical distribution of their masers with @xmath20.5  mas resolution .",
    "this kind of study has previously been very useful in massive star - forming regions to detect outflow activity through the presence of h@xmath0o maser emission , allowing the identification of new centres of star formation , some of them associated , as mentioned before , with short - lived episodic ejection events with kinematic ages of a few tens of years . with the present work , we now extend this study to intermediate - mass star - forming regions .",
