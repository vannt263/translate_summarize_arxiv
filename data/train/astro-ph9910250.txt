    "the measurement of the evolution of galaxy clustering is a direct test of theories of the evolution of structure and galaxy formation in the universe .",
    "clustering is predicted to change with increasing redshift in a manner that depends on the background cosmology , the spectrum of primordial density fluctuations out of which clustering grows , and the relation of galaxies to dark matter halos .",
    "specific predictions of clustering growth are available for a range of cdm - style cosmological models and galaxy identification algorithms . as a result of biasing @xcite",
    "there is a physically important generic prediction that the clustering of normal galaxies should not be identical to dark matter clustering and their clustering should evolve slowly at low redshifts . more generally , clustering evolution is of interest for its impact on galaxies , since clustering leads to galaxy - galaxy merging and creates the groups and clusters in which galaxies are subject to high gas densities and temperatures not found in the general field .",
    "the theoretical groundwork to interpret the quantitative evolution of dark matter clustering and the trends of galaxy clustering evolution is largely in place for hierarchical structure models .",
    "although the details of the mass buildup of galaxies and the evolution of their emitted light are far from certain at this time , clustering of galaxies depends primarily on the distribution of initial density fluctuations on the mass scale of galaxies .",
    "n - body simulations of ever growing precision along with their theoretical analysis @xcite have led to a good semi - analytic understanding of dark matter clustering into the nonlinear regime .",
    "one result is a remarkable , convenient , theoretically motivated , empirical equation that relates the linear power spectrum and its nonlinear outcome @xcite .",
    "this allows an analytic prediction of the clustering evolution of the dark matter density field .",
    "normal galaxies , which are known to exist near the centers of dark matter halos with velocity dispersions in the approximate range of 50 to 250 @xmath18 , can not have a clustering evolution identical to the full dark matter density field .",
    "kaiser ( 1984 ) showed that the dense `` peaks '' in the initial density field that ultimately collapse to form halos are usually more correlated than the full density field . for high peaks , the peak - peak correlation , @xmath19 ,",
    "is approximately @xmath20 ^ 2 $ ] times the correlation of the full dark matter density field , @xmath21 , ( see mo & white 1996 for a more general expression ) where @xmath22 measures the minimal `` peak height '' for formation of a halo , in units of the variance on that mass scale , @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "both @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( in co - moving co - ordinates ) grow approximately as @xmath26 ( exactly so in the linear regime ) , where @xmath27 is the growth factor for density perturbations in the cosmology of interest .",
    "the result is that @xmath19 stays nearly constant in co - moving co - ordinates .",
    "this result is approximately verified in n - body experiments @xcite which can be accurately modeled with a theoretically motivated analytic function @xcite .",
    "an implication is that dark matter halo clustering evolution will have little sensitivity to the background cosmology @xcite .",
    "these results formally apply to low density `` just virialized '' halos , whereas galaxies are found in the dense central regions of dark matter halos .",
    "therefore the clustering of galaxies needs to take into account their dissipation relative to the ( presumed ) dissipationless dark matter .",
    "dissipationless n - body simulations which resolve sub - halos within larger virialized units provide the basic dynamical information but still require a theory of galaxy formation to associate them with luminous objects , as guided by observations such as we report here .    at low redshift",
    "there have been several substantial clustering surveys , deriving information from both angular correlations , which can be de - projected with non - evolving luminosity functions , and redshift surveys , where the kinematics of the galaxies provides additional information about clustering dynamics .",
    "the observational measurement of clustering at higher redshifts has yet to reach the size , scale coverage , or redshift precision of the pioneering low redshift cfa survey @xcite .",
    "angular correlations of galaxies at higher redshifts provide some insights , but inevitably mix different galaxy populations at different redshifts and require an accurate @xmath28 to break the degeneracy between an evolving luminosity function and an evolving clustering amplitude @xcite .",
    "there are two redshift surveys extending out to @xmath29 , the canada france redshift survey @xcite and the hawaii k survey @xcite .",
    "measurement of the correlation evolution of the galaxies in these surveys found a fairly rapid decline in clustering with redshift @xcite .",
    "neither analysis took into account the evolution of the luminosity function or was able to quantify the effects of the small sky areas containing the samples . recently",
    "two relatively large sky area samples , a preliminary analysis of the survey reported in this paper @xcite and a shallower limiting magnitude survey @xcite , have indicated much stronger correlations at about redshift @xmath30 than the earlier small area surveys .",
    "this is the first in a series of papers which discusses the clustering and kinematic properties of the canadian network for observational cosmology field galaxy redshift survey . @xcite .",
    "the cnoc2 survey is designed to be comparable in size and precision to the first cfa redshift survey @xcite but covering galaxies out to redshift 0.7 . in this paper",
    "we restrict our analysis to measurements of the correlation amplitude of the high - luminosity galaxies in the cnoc2 redshift survey , which are a particularly simple and interesting subsample .",
    "the cnoc2 luminosity function is known in considerable detail @xcite which allows us to define an evolution - compensated volume limited sample thereby creating a straightforward sample to analyze .",
    "the next section of the paper briefly discusses the cnoc2 sample and the volume limited subsample of high - luminosity galaxies .",
    "section 3 describes in detail our estimate of the projected correlation function and its errors , along with its sensitivity to various possible systematic errors .",
    "section 4 reports our best estimates of the evolution of high - luminosity galaxy clustering in a variety of cosmologies .",
    "the results are discussed and conclusions drawn in section 5 . throughout this paper",
    "we use @xmath31 as various cosmologies as specified .",
    "the canadian network for observational cosmology ( cnoc ) field galaxy redshift survey is designed to investigate nonlinear clustering dynamics and its relation to galaxy evolution on scales smaller than approximately 20  over the @xmath32 range .",
    "there is substantial galaxy evolution over this redshift range @xcite for which the physical cause is unclear .",
    "the issues in designing a dynamically useful redshift survey are centered around efficiently and economically obtaining sufficient data to conclusively answer the questions posed about the evolution of clustering in galaxies and the dark matter . at these relatively modest redshifts",
    "the galaxies have spectra whose lines are within the range where efficient multi - object spectrographs allow velocities with a precision comparable to local surveys can be obtained .",
    "the observational procedures build on those for the cnoc1 cluster redshift survey @xcite , although there are considerable differences of detail . the strategy and procedures",
    "are discussed in greater detail in the cnoc2 methods paper @xcite .",
    "a representative volume in the universe must contain a reasonable number of low richness clusters and a good sampling of 50  voids , or equivalently the `` cosmic '' variance from one sample to another of equivalent design , but different sky positions , should not be too large . taking a cdm spectrum ( with @xmath33 and @xmath34 ; see efstathiou , bond & white 1992 ) as a guide we find that even a @xmath35 sphere , with enclosed volume of about @xmath36 , has an expected dispersion in galaxy numbers of approximately 17% .",
    "however , a spherical geometry is an ideal not available to relatively narrow angle surveys . the best available option is to spread the area of the survey over several independent patches on the sky .",
    "each patch should subtend an angle exceeding the correlation length . at @xmath37 a patch 0.5 degree across subtends 8.8  ( co - moving , for @xmath38 ) which turns out to be about two correlation lengths .",
    "we can crudely approximate the survey as a set of cylinders or spheres arranged in a row .",
    "a sphere of radius the correlation length ( whatever that happens to be ) has an expected variance of about @xmath39 in the numbers of galaxies @xcite , where @xmath40 is the approximate slope of the power law portion of the correlation function . over our redshift range",
    "there will be about 200 of these spheres in our sample , which if we divide into bins of 50 , statistically reduces the variance in binned counts to about 30% .",
    "the observational practicalities of always having a field accessible at modest airmass , control over patch to patch variations , and the constraint of not unduly fragmenting the survey area , indicate that we need a minimum of four and no more than about eight of these patches .",
    "we choose four .",
    "the resulting survey is well suited to measuring the evolution of correlations .",
    "the cnoc2 survey is contained in four patches on the sky .",
    "each patch consists of a central block , roughly 30 arcminutes on a side , with two `` legs '' , 10 arcminutes wide and about 40 arcminutes in extent , to provide an estimate of the effects of structure on larger scales .",
    "the resulting total sky area is about 1.55 square degrees .",
    "the sampled volume is about @xmath41 , roughly comparable to the low redshift cfa survey used for similar measurements at low redshift @xcite which had 1230 galaxies in the `` semi - volume limited '' northern sample from which the correlation length was derived .",
    "the redshift range targeted , 0.1 to about 0.7 , suggests we set the limiting magnitude at @xmath42 magnitude , which gives a median redshift of about 0.4 . at this limit",
    "the sky density is about 6000 galaxies per square degree yielding a photometric sample of about 10,000 galaxies to the spectroscopic limit .",
    "photometry is obtained in the ubvri bands , with the r - band fixing the sample limit at 21.5 mag .",
    "the r filter has the important feature of always being redward of the 4000  break over our redshift range .",
    "the other bands provide information useful for determining appropriate k - corrections and separating galaxies into types of different evolutionary state ( an issue not considered in this paper ) .",
    "the spectra are band - limited with a filter that restricts the range to 4390 - 6293 . the s / n and spectral resolution give an observed frame velocity error of about 100 @xmath18 , as determined by comparison of independent spectra of the same objects . in total",
    "there are about 6000 galaxies with redshifts in our sample .    at low redshift",
    "we will use the las campanas redshift survey ( lcrs ) to provide a directly comparable sample .",
    "the lcrs is an r - band selected survey @xcite that covers the redshift range 0.033 to 0.15 , with r magnitudes restricted to 15.0 and 17.7 mag .",
    "the bright magnitude limit leads to higher luminosity galaxies being depleted at low redshifts .",
    "the lcrs s selection function varies from field to field and under samples galaxies with separations less than about 100 .",
    "we compute both magnitude and geometric weights using the approach adopted in the cnoc cluster redshift survey @xcite but smoothing over a circle of 0.4 degree .",
    "the same procedures are used for the cnoc2 data , using a smoothing radius of 2 arcminutes .",
    "the same correlation analysis programs were used for the lcrs and cnoc2 data .",
    "the only differences are that the lcrs data are not k - corrected and are analyzed for a single cosmological model , @xmath38 .      in order to determine how clustering evolves",
    "we must measure the correlations of a statistically identical population of galaxies at increasing redshifts , which demands a secure statistical knowledge of the evolution of the galaxy luminosity function .",
    "individual galaxy luminosities change through stellar evolution , new star formation and merging with other galaxies .",
    "all of this would have no effect if galaxy correlations were independent of their mass and luminosity .",
    "however , there is a strong theoretical expectation that galaxy clustering will increase with mass and hence luminosity @xcite and there is growing evidence that the effect is observationally present at both low @xcite and intermediate redshifts @xcite .",
    "the practical issue is to define samples at different redshifts which can be sensibly compared .",
    "if the evolution is purely in luminosity , then we would want to compensate for the luminosity evolution so that the sample limit brings in galaxies of the same intrinsic luminosity at all redshifts .",
    "this would identify the same galaxies at all times .",
    "if evolution was pure merging , with no star formation , then it is particular interest to compare the clustering of galaxies of the same total stellar mass at different redshifts . as a currently practical stand - in for stellar mass we use",
    "the k - corrected and evolution compensated r - band absolute luminosity .",
    "our study of the cnoc2 luminosity function evolution @xcite found that the r - band evolution of the k - corrected galaxy luminosity function could be approximated as pure luminosity evolution at a rate , @xmath43 with a mean @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "equation  [ eq : q ] defines the k - corrected and evolution - compensated r absolute magnitudes that we use to select the sample for analysis .",
    "figure  [ fig : lza ] plots @xmath0 as a function of redshift for the entire flux limited , @xmath45 mag , cnoc2 sample .",
    "it is not necessary to know the fractional completeness for a correlation measurement .",
    "our correlation analysis will use galaxies with @xmath46 mag , which defines a volume limited sample over the @xmath47 range .",
    "our resulting subsample ( for @xmath38 ) contains 2285 galaxies .",
    "the alternate cosmological models considered below lead to slightly different absolute magnitudes and sample sizes .    beyond @xmath48",
    "the limited cnoc2 spectral band pass leads to a lower probability that a redshift will be obtained for redder galaxies @xcite .",
    "this may lead to an erroneously low correlation in this redshift range .",
    "however , as far as we can tell from the correlation statistics , the high - luminosity galaxies for which we do have redshifts in this range have correlations statistically consistent with a smooth continuation of those at lower redshift .",
    "the lcrs data are evolution - compensated with the same @xmath49 as the cnoc2 data , although at a mean redshift of about 0.1 , this makes very little difference .",
    "the resulting low - redshift subsample derived from lcrs contains 12467 galaxies for the correlation analysis .",
    "the goal of this paper is to estimate the evolution of the clustering of a well defined population of galaxies .",
    "the cnoc2 sample is designed to measure nonlinear clustering on scales of 10  and less , where clustering is quite naturally measured in terms of the two - point correlation function , @xmath50 .",
    "this function measures the galaxy density excess above the mean background density , @xmath51 , at distance @xmath52 from a galaxy , @xmath53 $ ] @xcite .",
    "measurement of the real space correlation function @xmath50 is not straightforward with redshift space data .",
    "the projected real space correlation function , @xmath54 , removes the peculiar velocities of redshift space at the cost of making a choice for the length of the redshift column over which the integration is done .",
    "the correlation function is a measure of the variation in galaxy numbers from one volume to another . the measurement technique can easily and fairly subtly either artificially increase or decrease the variation around the estimated mean .",
    "our survey was designed to have enough redundancy to explicitly test for a number of these effects .",
    "we will represent the evolving correlations with a double power law model .",
    "that is , over the range of scales that we are investigating the two point correlation is well represented as a power law @xmath55^\\gamma$ ] .",
    "furthermore , the evolution of @xmath56 is accurately described , over the redshift range we investigate , with the `` @xmath57 '' model , @xmath58 , if lengths are measured in physical co - ordinates @xcite . in this equation",
    "the factor of @xmath59 allows for the change in the mean density of galaxies due to expansion .",
    "consequently , if the universe consists of a set of physically invariant clusters in a smooth background , then @xmath60 . a clustering pattern that is fixed in co - moving co - ordinates would have @xmath61 , approximately @xmath62 for our mean @xmath63 .",
    "a positive @xmath57 indicates a decline of the physical clustered density with increasing redshift , as might be expected if clustering is growing .",
    "combining these two power law equations gives the double power law @xmath57 model , @xmath64 , in physical co - ordinates , or , rewritten in co - moving co - ordinates , @xmath65    the following sections discuss the steps leading up to our measurement and modeling of the co - moving @xmath66 .",
    "first we measure the unclustered distribution @xmath28 , then the projected real space correlation function @xmath67 ( after choosing the appropriate redshift space integration limit @xmath68 ) , fit those values to the projection of @xmath69 , estimate random errors , do a @xmath70 fit to determine the evolution parameter @xmath57 and finally discuss the systematic errors .",
    "a crucial operational detail of correlation measurements is to accurately assess the mean unclustered density as a function of redshift .",
    "once the smooth @xmath28 is known , then we follow the usual procedure and generate a random sample which follows the redshift distribution of the data as if they were unclustered .",
    "we generate uniform random positions in the sky area occupied by the galaxies , as approximated by a series of rectangles .",
    "correlations are then readily measured as the ratio of the number of galaxy - galaxy pairs to galaxy - random pairs .",
    "the use of a sample uniformly distributed on the sky assumes that there are no angular selection effects .",
    "for instance , crowding of spectrographic fibres causes the lcrs to be strongly under - sampled for pairs closer than 100 .",
    "the cnoc2 spectroscopic sample was double masked to try to fairly sample all pair separations .",
    "slit crowding still leads to some under sampling in cnoc2 @xcite .",
    "consequently we leave these small scales out of all our fits . to minimizes other geometric effects ,",
    "we apply to both samples an explicit geometric weight , calculated following the procedures of yee , ellingson & carlberg ( 1996 ) .",
    "comparison with unweighted correlations shows that this makes little practical difference to the resulting cnoc2 correlations , since the corrections are 10% or so in the mean .",
    "one approach to generating an unclustered distribution in redshift is to use the luminosity function , which can be estimated using maximum - likelihood techniques that are insensitive to the clustering .",
    "the complication here is that the luminosity functions need to be generated taking into account the magnitude selection function , in which only about half of the galaxies within the photometric limit have redshifts .",
    "moreover , the selection function is magnitude dependent .",
    "a more direct approach is to model directly the redshift distribution of the selected subsample .",
    "we chose a model function having sufficiently few parameters that it is not very sensitive to the details of the clustering that are present .",
    "as our fitting function we adopt a maxwellian form , @xmath71 } , \\label{eq : nz}\\ ] ] where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are fitting parameters . this function",
    "was arrived at after trying various combinations of exponential cutoffs and power law rises at low redshifts , including log - normal types of distributions .",
    "the resulting form is both simple and adequately describes the data .",
    "we use a maximum likelihood approach to find the parameters of this function .",
    "the logarithm of the likelihood is @xmath74 , where the individual likelihoods are , @xmath75 the redshift range @xmath76 to @xmath77 for the fit is taken as 0.05 to 0.70 for the cnoc2 sample , although we only use the data between redshift 0.10 and 0.65 .",
    "the redshift limits are 0.033 and 0.15 for the lcrs .",
    "the cnoc2 redshift distribution in bins of @xmath78 for all four patches and the resulting fit is shown in figure  [ fig : cnz ] in bins of @xmath78 .",
    "the best overall fit has @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "if the strong clustering feature at @xmath81 in the 2148 - 05 patch is not included , then the fits to the individual fields are all consistent with the global fit .    inserted into the figure  [ fig : cnz ] is a panel showing the 68 , 90 and 99% confidence contours from the maximum likelihood fit .",
    "the error is about 10% in the @xmath73 parameter and 5% in @xmath72 . given these well defined parameters we find that the 68% confidence @xmath28 range is about 10% at any redshift we use in the analysis .",
    "this is sufficient to measure correlations to 20% precision with respect to the background out to about 2 correlation lengths .",
    "a small systematic effect visible in a @xmath82 version of the @xmath28 plot is that there are small redshift `` notches '' at 0.496 and 0.581 when the [ oii ]",
    "line falls on the 5577  or 5892  night sky line , respectively .",
    "this leads to an underestimate of the true mean density in the 0.45 - 0.55 and 0.55 - 0.65 redshift bins",
    ". this will bias the derived @xmath83 upwards in these two redshift bins about 2% and 5% respectively , which is within our random errors .",
    "the correlation function is a real space quantity , whereas the redshift space separation of two galaxies depends on their peculiar velocities as well as the physical separation .",
    "although the peculiar velocities contain much useful information about clustering dynamics , they are an unwanted complication for the study of configuration space correlations .",
    "the peculiar velocities are eliminated by integrating over the redshift direction to give the projected correlation function , @xmath84 @xcite . if we take a power law correlation @xmath69 and integrate to @xmath85 we find , @xmath86 @xcite . however , in a practical survey , summing over ever increasing distances leads to little increase in the signal and growing noise from fluctuations in the field density .",
    "the signal - to - noise considerations in the choice of @xmath68 are straightforward . to capture the bulk of the correlation signal",
    ", @xmath68 should be significantly larger than the local @xmath83 and the length corresponding to the pairwise velocity dispersion , @xmath87 .",
    "these are both about 3 or 4 .",
    "large values , say @xmath88 , might more completely integrate the correlation signal but they do so at the considerable cost of increased noise .",
    "exactly where to terminate the integration depends greatly on the range of correlations of interest .",
    "here we are focussed on the non - linear correlations , @xmath89 . before we evaluate an appropriate choice for @xmath68 we must choose a correlation function estimator .",
    "the optimal choice of a statistical estimator of the correlation function depends on the application . with point data the basic procedure is to determine the average number of neighboring galaxies within some projected radius , @xmath90 , and redshift distance @xmath68 .",
    "the @xmath91 pair is weighted as @xmath92 and the sum over all sample pairs is @xmath93 @xcite . a random sample of redshifts following the fitted @xmath28 is generated along with @xmath94 co - ordinates in the visible sky area of the catalogue .",
    "we then compute the average number of random sample galaxies within precisely the same volume , assigning the random points unit weight . this average",
    "is known as dr .",
    "then , we estimate @xmath67 using the simplest and computationally inexpensive estimator , @xmath95 which is accurate for the nonlinear clustering examined here and faster than methods which include the rr ,  random - random pairs .. we have verified that the @xmath96 and @xmath97 estimators give virtually identical results over the range of pairwise separations that we use in the fits , @xmath98 .",
    "these alternate estimators are known to be superior when @xmath99 , which only occurs at the outer separation limit of our measurements .",
    "we use 100,000 random objects per patch , distributed over the redshift range 0.10 to 0.65 using the fitted @xmath28 .",
    "the dd and dr sums extend over all four patches , so that patch to patch variations in the mean volume density become part of the correlation signal .",
    "this procedure assumes that there are no significant patch - to - patch variations in the mean photometric selection function , which is supported by the absence of any significant differences in the number - magnitude relation from patch to patch .",
    "we use geometric weights alone for the results presented here .",
    "magnitude weights give statistically identical results for the same sample of galaxies , but , as might be anticipated , the errors in the resulting determination of the correlation evolution are nearly a factor of two larger .    estimated projected correlation functions , in co - moving co - ordinates using @xmath100 ,",
    "are displayed for the lcrs galaxies bounded by redshifts [ 0.033 , 0.15 ] and seven somewhat arbitrary redshift bins for the cnoc2 data , [ 0.10 , 0.20 , 0.26 , 0.35 , 0.40 , 0.45 , 0.55 , 0.65 ] in figure  [ fig : xi_2 ] .",
    "these boundaries make the end bins bigger than the middle ones to reduce the variation in numbers between the bins . for the open model we found the summed geometric weights in the bins to be [ 151.8 , 264.4 , 267.3 , 471.6 , 301.2 , 496.7 , 286.2 ] , and [ 172.2 , 305.0 , 321.1 , 595.6 , 368.3 , 600.3 , 315.4 ] for the @xmath17 cosmology , showing the sample differences due to cosmology are quite small .",
    "extensive testing found that provided the bins are not made significantly narrower than the adopted limits , the bin sizes make no significant difference to the results .",
    "adjusting the bins to have nearly constant numbers makes no difference to our result .",
    "of course the lcrs data is very important for providing a solid measurement at low redshift .",

    "the results displayed in figure  [ fig : xi_2 ] are derived assuming a background cosmology of @xmath109 .",
    "the problem of error estimates for correlation measurements remains a topic of active research .",
    "the shot noise estimate of the fractional error as @xmath104 is appropriate for weak clustering , but a substantial underestimate for strongly nonlinear clustering , where the clustering itself reduces the effective number of independent pairs .",
    "a formal error expression in terms of the three- and four - point correlation function is available @xcite but cumbersome and computationally expensive .",
    "resampling techniques , such as the bootstrap and jackknife @xcite , produce substantial over - estimates of the error .    a straightforward approach to error estimates",
    "is to take advantage of our sample being distributed over a number of separate patches .",
    "we separately fit each of the four cnoc2 and six lcrs patches , to obtain an @xmath83 for each patch or slice . the estimated error in any correlation length , @xmath83 ,",

    "[ eq : err ] is computed from the individual patches and is not equal to the correlation of the four fields combined , which is generally larger than the average since it includes the patch to patch variation in mean counts as part of the signal . because we have only four cnoc2 patches and six lcrs strips the estimated errors will themselves have substantial fluctuations .",
    "the resulting co - moving correlation lengths for a power law model are displayed for a range of @xmath68 in figure  [ fig : xir ] .",

    "the most conservative choice for @xmath68 is 10 , the one with the largest error in the stable range .",
    "figure  [ fig : rr ] weakly suggests that somewhat larger @xmath68 would lead to a small increase in the correlation length , to @xmath122 .",
    "we will adopt the @xmath100 fits as our standard results , noting that the inferred @xmath57 have essentially no dependence on @xmath68 .    for small survey volumes",
    "the derived correlation length tends to systematically underestimate the result from a very large area .",
    "that is , clustering is known to be significant on scales of at least 100 , hence surveys smaller than that in any dimension are likely to be measuring the range of clustering about either a local valley or plateau , and not seeing the full range of clustered density .",
    "the effect of increasing survey size on correlations can be seen in figure  [ fig : cr0z ] , in that the combined analysis ( filled circles ) generally gives correlations higher than the mean of the individual patches ( other symbols ) .",
    "quantitatively , the straight mean of the cnoc2 @xmath83 is 3.2 ; the median is 3.4 .",
    "it is more appropriate to average together the pair counts , which is equivalent to taking the average @xmath123 leading to an average correlation length of 3.5 .",
    "performing a joint correlation analysis of all four patches together gives an @xmath83 of 4.0 .",
    "this raises the question as to whether the correlations have converged within the current survey .",
    "the expected variation from patch to patch for the given volumes with narrow redshift bins is about 45% , which is consistent with the difference between a correlation length of 3.5 and 4.3 . in the combined sample with larger bins",
    "we expect that there could be as much as about 10% of the variance missing , which would boost the correlation lengths by another 5% .",
    "the correlation lengths for cnoc2 and lcrs , derived from fitting @xmath67 as discussed in  3.3 and analyzed in precisely the same way for our standard @xmath100 and @xmath124 , are shown in figure  [ fig : cr0z ] and reported in table  [ tab : r0z ] .",
    "it is immediately clear that there is relatively little correlation evolution for high - luminosity galaxies .",
    "it must be borne in mind that the sample is defined to be a similar set of galaxies with @xmath125 , with luminosity evolution - compensated , that approximates a sample of fixed stellar mass with redshift .",
    "samples which admit lower luminosity galaxies , or do not correct for evolution , or are selected in bluer pass - bands where evolutionary effects are larger and less certainly corrected , will all tend to have lower correlation amplitudes .",
    "the @xmath70 contours of the @xmath126 model fits to the measured correlations of  3 are shown in figure  [ fig : r00e ] . at redshifts beyond 0.1 or so , the choice of cosmological model has a substantial effect on the correlation estimates .",
    "relative to a high matter density cosmological model , low density and @xmath17 models have larger distances and volumes , which cause the correlations to be enhanced .",
    "the lcrs data are analyzed only within the @xmath38 model .",
    "the correlations for three cosmologies , flat matter dominated , open , and low - density @xmath17 , are shown in figure  [ fig : r0z ] .",
    "the @xmath70 contours at the 68% , 90% and 99% contours are shown in figure  [ fig : r00e ] .",
    "the best fit @xmath57 value is @xmath127 for @xmath128 with @xmath5 .",
    "the evolution rates for the flat matter dominated and flat low - density models are @xmath129 and @xmath130 , respectively , with @xmath14 of @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "these are marked with plus signs in figure  [ fig : r00e ] .",
    "the effects of alternate values for the luminosity evolution are shown in figure  [ fig : r00e ] with crosses indicating the results for @xmath131 and @xmath132 , with the adopted value being @xmath124 .",
    "the absolute magnitude limit remains @xmath133 mag in all cases and we use the @xmath109 cosmology . for @xmath131 the summed bin weights are [ 176.1,329.2,347.7,659.7,417.7,673.6,318.4 ] and for @xmath132 they are [ 128.7,203.7,190.2,317.6,191.2,296.0,159.3 ] .",
    "the effect is that less ( more ) evolution compensation gives rise to a more ( less ) rapid decline in the correlations with increasing redshift . in the absence of any allowance for luminosity evolution , @xmath131 , galaxies of lower luminosity",
    "are included with increasing numbers at higher redshift .",
    "galaxy correlations tend to decline slightly with decreasing luminosity with the strongest declines being at high - luminosity @xcite although the details of this important effect remain controversial .",
    "a preliminary investigation finds a small effect in the cnoc2 sample @xcite .",
    "if we do not correct for luminosity evolution , then intrinsically lower luminosity galaxies are included in increasing numbers at higher redshifts , which will leads to an increased rate of decline of correlations with redshift , as we have empirically demonstrated here .",
    "the observed effect over the 0.0 to 0.65 redshift range is approximately @xmath134 .",
    "this effect is partially responsible for the difference between the results here and those of lefvre  ( 1996 ) .",
    "we now can compare our measurements of clustering evolution to the various simple theoretical models and analytic fits to n - body simulation results .",
    "we will cast these predictions into the form of an equivalent theoretical @xmath135 using , @xmath136 where we have assumed that the correlation function will always be of the form @xmath137 .",
    "linear growth is the simplest case , @xmath138 where @xmath27 is the linear perturbation growth factor @xcite . for the @xmath10 , @xmath139 ,",
    "@xmath140 is simply the expansion factor , @xmath141 , which gives the result that @xmath142 .",
    "for other @xmath143 values we approximate the redshift dependence as a power law in @xmath144 by evaluating the growth factor at @xmath145 and @xmath146 , as is appropriate for this survey .",
    "the results are presented in table  [ tab : eps ] .",
    "an alternate clustering model is to allow for some bias , @xmath147 , of galaxies clustering with respect to the dark matter , @xmath148 .",
    "there are two simple forms which describe the bias , @xmath147 , @xcite , @xmath149 where @xmath150 is the tophat mass variance @xcite in a sphere of radius @xmath151 and the critical linear overdensity , @xmath152 .",
    "a refinement to this formula based on fitting to n - body results is @xcite , @xmath153 where @xmath154 is the effective index of the perturbation spectrum .",
    "we use the fit to cdm spectrum of efstathiou , bond & white ( 1992 ) to evaluate our tophat variances .",
    "one possibility of relevance only in an @xmath10 cosmology , is that clustering obeys a scaling law @xcite , @xmath155 , with @xmath156 cdm has such a large negative effective index , @xmath157 on galaxy scales , that it gives rise to a very large theoretical value of @xmath158 , as was seen in the early cdm simulations @xcite .",
    "an @xmath135 this large is completely excluded by clustering evolution studies .",
    "the observations and theoretical predictions in table  [ tab : eps ] allow us to draw a number of conclusions .",
    "linear theory is not a very good model because of both biasing and nonlinearities , given that the range of scales fit in the power law spans overdensities ranging from @xmath159 to @xmath160 , but it is a useful reference point .",
    "the open and @xmath10 cosmologies are consistent with linear theory growth but the low density @xmath17 model is marginally excluded at 3.4 standard deviations ( s.d . ) . a comparison to n - body experiments",
    "@xcite shows the same approximate consistency with low density mass - traces - light cosmologies .",
    "mo & white biasing in an open cosmology is marginally excluded at 3.8  s.d .  and jing biasing more conclusively at 4.7 s.d .",
    "biased clustering in an @xmath10 cosmology is excluded at more than 6  s.d .",
    "the low density flat model is acceptable under all biasing models .",
    "bearing in mind that the evolution of correlations is a test of both a galaxy formation and evolution model and the cosmology , these results mainly exclude models where galaxies are closely identified via the biasing mechanism with dark matter halos in an @xmath38 , cosmology or in an @xmath10 cosmology .",
    "the problem in both cases is that they predict almost no correlation evolution , whereas we observed a small but significant decrease of the co - moving correlation length with redshift .",
    "the cnoc2 redshift survey has measured precision velocities for more than 6000 galaxies in the redshift 0.1 to 0.7 range .",
    "the sky area of about 1.55 square degrees therefore covers a volume of about @xmath161 .",
    "we have defined a volume limited subsample of those galaxies with k - corrected and evolution corrected r - band absolute magnitudes of @xmath46 mag , where @xmath162 mag in the r - band .",
    "this subset contains about 2300 galaxies in the 0.1 to 0.65 redshift range . at low redshift",
    "we add about 13000 identically selected galaxies from the lcrs .",
    "the correlation measurements from this paper are contained in figure  [ fig : cr0z ] and the associated table  [ tab : r0z ] . over",
    "the redshift range examined , the correlation evolution can be described with the double power law model , @xmath163 , in co - moving co - ordinates .",
    "we measure a @xmath7 and set @xmath40 for fitting purposes .",
    "our results for various cosmologies and evolution corrections are shown in figure  [ fig : r00e ] .",
    "the primary conclusion is that correlations show a weak decline with redshift .",
    "furthermore , there is no evidence in the current data for a change in the slope of the correlation function with redshift .",
    "these observations test both the amplitude and redshift evolution of clustering predictions .",
    "they jointly constrain the cosmology and the galaxy formation history , and do not provide any strong constraints on the background cosmology by themselves . the comparison of our measurements and analytic fits",
    "is presented in table  [ tab : eps ] .",
    "the correlation amplitude and slope are in quite good agreement with appropriately selected dark matter halos in a cdm simulation @xcite , however the agreement depends fairly sensitively on the mass range selected @xcite .",
    "the rate decline of clustering with redshift is slow but significant in all cosmologies examined here .",
    "that is , @xmath57 is always greater than @xmath62 , the value for a fixed co - moving clustering length .",
    "the prediction of a slower clustering evolution in a biased @xmath10 cosmology is completely excluded by the more rapid decline measured here and somewhat marginally excluded in an @xmath109 cosmology .",
