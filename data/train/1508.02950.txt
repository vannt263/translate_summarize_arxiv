    "in young supernova remnants ( snrs ) , both shocked thermal plasma emission and non - thermal emission from accelerated particles typically peak in the 0.5 - 10  kev x - ray band ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the x - ray properties of these emission components often show clear spatial variations . therefore , spatially resolved x - ray observations of young snrs play important roles in our understanding of many scientific issues , such as the explosion mechanisms and progenitors of supernova ( sn ) , the microphysics involved in particle acceleration and magnetic field amplification , the heating of electrons and ions at the shock , as well as the abundances and the distribution of fresh nucleosynthesis products ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "current facilities ( in particular , x - ray ccds ) on board space x - ray telescopes such as _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ have the ability to simultaneously record the spatial and spectral information of the collected photons .",
    "they could thus be used for spatially resolved spectroscopy analysis to study the spatial distribution of x - ray properties across young snrs .",
    "however , methods commonly used in x - ray data analysis , such as spectral analysis of individual interesting regions ( e.g. , @xcite ) and equivalent width ( ew ) map of strong emission lines ( e.g. , @xcite ) , usually do not make full use of the information contained in the x - ray ccd data . what we want",
    ", and are often contained in the x - ray data , are the spatial distributions of various physical properties of the thermal and non - thermal x - ray emission across the snrs .    in this paper",
    ", we will introduce new techniques to conduct spatially resolved spectroscopy analysis .",
    "the basic idea is to map out the spectral parameters in small tessellated regions which individually contain enough photons for spectral analysis .",
    "such techniques have initially been developed for optical integral field observations @xcite , and have later been applied to x - ray observations @xcite , especially in resolving interesting features in the temperature / metallicity maps of massive galaxy clusters ( e.g. , @xcite ) or interacting galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "snrs typically have more complicated x - ray spectra which often include ionization non - equilibrium thermal plasma ( e.g. , @xcite ) and/or non - thermal emission with varying spectral shapes ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is therefore more difficult to automatically decompose different spectral components and model the spectra extracted from a large number of tessellated regions .",
    "furthermore , existing spatially resolved spectroscopy analysis of snrs often adopt _ equal - sized _",
    "( e.g. , @xcite ) or adaptively - binned _ box - shaped _ meshes ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which are less efficient in resolving fine structures on physical parameter maps .",
    "the remnant of the supernova ad1006 ( sn1006 ) is one of the few historical snrs with human records of its exact birth date ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is widely accepted that sn1006 is the remnant of a type  ia supernova event , based on its high galactic latitude location [ @xmath8 , apparently isolated from any star formation regions ] , the lack of any visible central compact sources ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the detection of iron absorption lines from the ultraviolet ( uv ) spectra of background sources ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the metal abundances inferred from the soft x - ray emission lines @xcite , the lack of time variation due to the clumpy of the surrounding medium @xcite , and the historical records that it remains visible for several years ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "proper motion measurements in optical ( e.g. , @xcite ) , radio ( e.g. , @xcite ) , or x - ray @xcite , combined with the shock velocity as inferred from the measurements of the width and ratio of some optical / uv emission lines ( e.g. , @xcite ) , or the expanding velocity inferred from the broadening of some uv absorption lines of background sources ( e.g. , @xcite ) , place this remnant at a distance of @xmath9 @xcite , well consistent with the distance obtained from observations @xcite .",
    "the apparent radio / x - ray diameter of sn1006 is @xmath10 , or @xmath11 at this distance .",
    "similar as other young snrs , the multi - wavelength properties of sn1006 also show clear spatial variations . _",
    "first _ , sn1006 can be apparently divided into two distinguishable parts .",
    "the northeast ( ne ) and southwest ( sw ) lobes are radio ( e.g. , @xcite ) , hard x - ray ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and tev ( @xcite ) bright , and the axis connecting the bright non - thermal regions is roughly aligned with the galactic plane ( @xcite ) .",
    "they are thought to be dominated by synchrotron emission of relativistic electrons accelerated at the snr blast wave ( e.g. , @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "most of the snr interior , including the northwest ( nw ) shell , are dominated by thermal emission characterized by strong emission lines of heavy elements ( e.g. , @xcite ) . _",
    "second _ , not only the relative contribution of the two major components , but also the spectral properties of the non - thermal emission within the ne / sw lobes and the thermal emission within the snr interior , show significant variations .",
    "these variations indicate the spatial variation of particle acceleration conditions ( e.g. , @xcite ) , as well as the thermal and chemical properties across the entire remnant ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which await better characterizations .",
    "_ third _ , the multi - wavelength properties of sn1006 also show noticeable spatial variations .",
    "in addition to the two prominent non - thermal lobes , the spatial variation of h@xmath5 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , infra - red ( ir ; @xcite ) , and 21-cm line emissions ( @xcite ) on both large ( comparable to the size of the snr ) and small ( comparable to the size of some prominent features ) scales further indicates the considerable spatial variation of the density of the ambient interstellar medium ( ism ) , although sn1006 is believed to evolve in a relatively low - density and uniform environment .",
    "we herein study sn1006 with our newly developed spatially resolved spectroscopy analysis method .",
    "we have obtained high quality x - ray data of sn1006 through our _ xmm - newton _ large program ( lp ) and some archival observations . the high sensitivity and large field of view ( fov ) of _",
    "xmm - newton _ help us to collect enough photons over the entire remnant , thus make sn1006 the best candidate to test how the spatially resolved spectroscopy analysis with our new techniques could improve our understanding of young snrs .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in  [ paperisec : datareduction ] , we briefly introduce our _ xmm - newton _ lp and also the archival data used in this project .",
    "basic data calibration is also detailed in this section . in  [ paperisec : methods ] , we describe our new methods developed to conduct spatially resolved spectroscopy analysis . the parameter maps and other products of this analysis are presented and further discussed in  [ paperisec : results ] .",
    "we summarize the main results and conclusions in  [ paperisec : summary ] .",
    "more discussions on the thermal and non - thermal emissions of this remnant will be presented in companion papers .",
    "in this work , we analyze the data obtained from the _ xmm - newton _ lp of sn1006 ( pi : a. decourchelle , @xmath12 of total exposure time ) . these observations were all performed with the `` medium '' filter by using the full - frame ( ff ) mode for the mos ( metal oxide semi - conductor ) cameras and the extended full - frame ( eff ) mode for the pn cameras .",
    "we also select archival _ xmm - newton _ epic ( the european photon imaging camera ) observations with pointing positions within @xmath13 from the center of sn1006 . only observations with at least one of the epic cameras operating in either ff or eff mode are considered .",
    "all these observations are also carried out with the `` medium '' filter .",
    "information of all the selected observations is summarized in table  [ paperitable : observations ] .",
    "some analysis of these lp data have already been published in @xcite .",
    "we reduce the data based on _ xmm - newton _ science analysis software ( sas ) v12.0.1 . for each observation",
    "listed in table  [ paperitable : observations ] , the observation data files ( odf ) for each of the epic instruments ( mos-1 , mos-2 and pn ) are reprocessed using the sas tasks _ emchain _ and _ epproc_. we identify and tag the low - energy noise in the mos ccds in anomalous states , i.e. , with an elevated event rates between 0 and 1  kev , using the sas task _ emtaglenoise _ , following the algorithm described in @xcite .",
    "all events in all ccds tagged as noisy are then filtered out .",
    "ccds in anomalous states with this low - energy noise are also summarized in table  [ paperitable : observations ] .",
    "each dataset is further screened for periods of soft proton flaring through the creation of full - field ( but remove brightest point - like sources which may be time variable ) light curves in broad band ( 0.3 - 12  kev for mos and 0.3 - 14  kev for pn ) .",
    "good time interval ( gti ) selections are made by setting a threshold with @xmath14 clipping for each instrument .",
    "the resulting effective exposure times for each instrument after this background flare filtering are listed in table  [ paperitable : observations ] .",
    "the total effective exposure times of all the observations for mos-1 , mos-2 , and pn are 683 , 710 and 439  ks , respectively . out - of - time ( oot )",
    "events have a non - negligible impact on the pn data and are also reprocessed with the sas task _ epchain _ and filtered in an identical way to the primary pn datasets .",
    "this oot events are further subtracted in the following imaging and spectral analyses .",

    "we apply the sas task _ evigweight _ to both the oot and the primary events lists , weighting each epic events with inverse effective area over one exposure , so that the derived event list is equivalent to what one would get for a flat instrument .",
    "this allows the use of single on - axis ancillary response files ( arf ) for each instrument , and does not require further effective area corrections in the following imaging and spectral analyses .",
    "the source event maps and the instrument exposure maps from each observation and each camera are constructed in several bands . in order to correct for the oot events in pn observations",
    ", we also construct oot images and scale them to the expected oot event fraction ( 6.3% in ff and 2.2% in eff modes respectively , according to _ xmm - newton _ users handbook : http://xmm.esac.esa.int/external/xmm_user_support/documentation/uhb/index.html ) .",
    "these oot images are then subtracted from the raw pn images .",
    "a subtraction of the instrumental background is applied to images from all instruments by making use of the epic filter wheel closed ( fwc ) data obtained from the _ xmm - newton _ background analysis website ( http://xmm2.esac.esa.int/external/xmm_sw_cal/background/filter_closed/index.shtml ) .",
    "these fwc data are reprocessed and renormalized to match the 10 - 12/12 - 14  kev ( for mos / pn ) counts number of the source images before subtraction .",
    "the source , exposure , and background maps from different observations are then combined together using the sas task _ emosaic_.",

    "the exposure map is smoothed according to the same template as the event map .",
    "we then produce final background - subtracted and exposure - corrected flux images with these smoothed images ( e.g. , fig .",
    "[ paperifig : tricolorregions ] ) .",
    "because there exist a lot of soft x - ray knots in sn1006 , which may be mis - identified as point sources in usual source detection tools , we conduct point - source detection only in the hard x - ray band ( 2 - 8  kev ) . we create a constant psf map of @xmath17 for the mosaiced images , which is good enough for a simple detection and removal of them for the study of diffuse emission .",
    "we then adopt this psf map to a standard wave detection tool _",
    "wavdetect_. we finally inspect the detected point - like sources visually to remove obvious false detections .",
    "the point sources are only removed in extracting the background spectra ( appendix  [ paperiappendix : skybackground ] ) .",
    "there are many faint point - like sources projected inside the snr .",
    "the x - ray emission of most of these sources peak at hard x - ray so do not contribute significantly at @xmath18 which we most concern in this paper .",
    "therefore , we do not remove these point sources from the source spectra .",
    "we caution that some peculiar features on the parameter maps shown in the following sections may be caused by foreground or background point sources instead of the emission from the snr itself .",
    "this contamination is in general not significant , but could be important when the truly diffuse emission is faint ( e.g. , close to the two point sources at @xmath19 outside the southeast rim of the snr ; fig .",
    "[ paperifig:2dspec_meshes ] ) .",
    "x - ray observations typically provide us with multi - dimensional data , i.e. , by recording the ( x , y ) position on the focal plane , the arrival time , and the energy of the photons .",
    "this multi - dimensional data allows us to study the spatial distribution of many physical parameters , in addition to simply constructing broad- or narrow - band intensity images .",
    "spatially - resolved spectroscopy represent such techniques to map out the physical parameters of x - ray bright extended sources .",
    "different from previous studies which often extract spectra from several interesting regions of an extended source , we herein introduce a new method to directly map out the spectral analysis parameters in many tessellated regions .",
    "similar techniques have been discussed in several literatures .",
    "for example , @xcite used two different methods ( the over - sampling of the image at each pixel or the tessellated mesh ) to map out the temperature distribution around the virgo cluster galaxy m86 .",
    "we adopt a new algorithm in order to construct tessellated meshes adaptively .",
    "we first find the brightest unbinned pixel in the original point - source - removed broad - band ( 0.3 - 8  kev ) counts image and put this pixel into a new mesh .",
    "if the pixels already included in the mesh contain total ( mos-1+mos-2+pn ) counts number above our threshold of @xmath20 , we create one polygon region containing all the pixels in the mesh .",
    "if the pixels contain less counts , we then add the brightest pixel surrounding the previous added pixel to the mesh and compare the total counts to the threshold again .",
    "this process is repeated until the mesh contains more counts than the threshold or no surrounding pixel is unbinned .",
    "isolated pixels between different meshes are leaving unbinned during the creation of the meshes .",
    "these unbinned pixels are finally individually merged into the neighboring meshes with the smallest average distance to them .",
    "this algorithm creates tessellated polygon regions each has at least a counts number of the input threshold , while each pixel only belongs to one single region ( the meshes ) .",
    "an example of the created meshes ( 3596 tessellated regions ) , as will be adopted in the following analysis , is shown in fig .",
    "[ paperifig:2dspec_meshes ] .",
    "the smallest meshes have typical diameter of 4  pixel , or @xmath21 , larger than the fwhm of the psf",
    ". therefore , the tail of the psf should have little effect on the spectral analysis .",
    "we extract spectra of mos-1 , mos-2 , and pn from each of the polygon regions of each observations containing positive counts numbers .",
    "we then weight these spectra as well as the corresponding background and response files and stack them together for mos-1 , mos-2 , and pn , respectively .",
    "typically , the spectrum of each instrument from a single region contains several thousand net counts , enough for the purpose of roughly characterizing the soft x - ray spectral energy distribution . to save computer time and space",
    ", we do not create response files [ the redistribution matrix file ( rmf ) and the arf ] for all the spectra extracted for the three instruments of the 15 observations from the 3596 regions ( @xmath22 spectra and the corresponding rmf ; hereafter referred as the high resolution run ) .",
    "instead , we create lower resolution meshes ( with 182 regions in total , hereafter referred as the low resolution run ) , thus with higher counting statistic , and create rmfs for the spectra extracted from each regions of the three instruments of all the observations .",
    "the rmfs are then weighted according to the effective exposure time of individual spectra and merged together to create single weighted rmf for each region .",
    "these rmfs are taken as templates in the high resolution run . in the high resolution run , for each region , we find the nearest region from it in the low resolution run and directly use the existing rmf from this region . because we have already corrected the vignetting in the calibration (  [ paperisubsec : calibration ] ) , we use identical on - axis arf of each instrument for all the regions . in both low and high resolution runs",
    ", we still extract the source and background spectra separately for individual regions , instruments , and observations , and stack them according to their effective exposure time and area scale , similar as the standard way typically taken by many other authors .",
    "the use of template rmf may cause some biases in the spectral analysis , but we have double checked all the prominent features in the spectra extracted from the tessellated meshes , by examining the spectra extracted from larger regions with the response files individually generated (  [ paperisubsec : reliabilityparamap ] ) .",
    "analysis of the sky background is presented in appendix  [ paperiappendix : skybackground ] .",
    "we add the sky background components ( with all the parameters fixed ) to the model of the source spectra . in order to do this , the normalization of the three sky background components ( vmekal , power law , and mekal ) are rescaled according to the ratio of the effective areas of the source and sky background regions . in the analysis of both source and sky background spectra",
    ", we adopt the fwc data as the instrumental background and have subtracted them before spectral analysis .",
    "we fit the source spectra with a `` vnei+srcut '' model .",
    "the vnei component ( non - equilibrium ionization collisional plasma model , with parameters describing the relative abundances between different elements ) describes the thermal plasma contribution , assuming a constant temperature and single ionization parameter .",
    "the srcut component describes the synchrotron emission from an exponentially cutoff power - law distribution of electrons in a homogeneous magnetic field ( @xcite ) .",
    "both the vnei and srcut components are subjected to foreground absorption described with a wabs model ( photo - electric absorption using wisconsin cross - sections ) .",
    "it is possible that the distribution of the ambient ism is inhomogenous , which could affect the absorption and thus the shape of the soft x - ray spectra .",
    "however , based on @xcite s column density map in the surrounding region of sn1006 , the variation of absorbing column density ( @xmath23 ) is at most @xmath24 ( also see @xcite ) . because @xmath23 in the direction of sn1006 is quite low , such small variations on @xmath23 does not significantly affect the spectral fitting results .",
    "we therefore fix the absorption column density at the foreground value of @xmath25 @xcite .    for the vnei component",
    ", we adopt the atomic data for astrophysicists ( atomdb ; @xcite ) .",
    "we caution that the vnei model only has a single ionization parameter ( @xmath3 ) , so does not take account the possibly different ionization age of different elements or a distribution of ionization age in the post - shock region .",
    "the ionization age distribution of the post - shock plasma , and/or the different temperatures of the ions and electrons , are better described with a plane - parallel shock plasma model ( vpshock ) or an x - ray spectral model describing snrs in the sedov - taylor phase ( sedov model ; @xcite ) . however , spectral fitting with such models take too long computer time for the 3596 regions , so are not adopted here .",
    "our single temperature ( 1-t ) vnei model may also fail to describe the possible multi - temperature structure of the plasma ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , most of the spectra from individual meshes have poor counting statistic at high energy ( e.g. , at the si line band ) , so have poor constraint on the properties of some possible high - temperature components .",
    "therefore , the spectral model adopted in the present paper is only aimed at roughly decomposing the thermal and non - thermal contributions , as well as characterizing the average thermal and ionization states of the plasma .",
    "we will briefly discuss the thermal structure of the plasma in ",
    "[ paperisubsubsec:2dspec_kt ] .",
    "further discussions on modeling the thermal spectra of sn1006 based on higher - quality spectra but lower - resolution meshes will be presented in companion papers .",
    "we set the o , ne , mg , si , and fe abundances free , the s abundance equal to si , and ni abundance equal to fe .",
    "all these elements produce strong emission lines in soft x - ray , but fe and ni do not have well separated emission line bumps at @xmath18 , in which our spectra typically have enough counts ( e.g. , fig .  [ paperifig : spec_mesh ] ) .",
    "we further add into our models three narrow gaussian lines ( line width fixed at @xmath26 ) at 0.714  kev , 0.723  kev , and 0.730  kev to account for the higher level transitions ( k@xmath27 , k@xmath28 , k@xmath29 ) of lines which are not included in the vnei code ( e.g. , fig .  [",
    "paperifig : spec_mesh]a , d ) . following @xcite",

    "the lines are typically weak compared to the lines . at lower temperatures where the line is dominant",
    ", the line flux decreases rapidly along the k - shell transition series , so in most cases only k@xmath31 transitions are important .",
    "however , sn1006 has a low ionization age and fairly high temperature (  [ paperisec : results ] ) .",
    "it is thus possible that these high level transitions are fairly strong in some regions , the spectra of which show clear residual at 0.7 - 0.75  kev without adding these gaussian lines .",
    "alternatively , the spectral fitting residual at 0.7 - 0.75  kev could also be explained as the fe  l shell transitions from low ionization ions ( less than fe@xmath32 ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we will further discuss this possibility in ",
    "[ paperisubsubsec : metal_fek ] . nevertheless , for the convenience of presentation , we will call these added gaussian lines the  @xmath33 lines throughout the paper , regardless of its real origin from oxygen or iron .    in the srcut model , we fit the radio - to - x - ray photon index @xmath5 and the cutoff frequency @xmath6 , but fix the normalization using the radio flux obtained from @xcite .",
    "we assume a constant radio spectral slope of 0.5 ( @xmath34 ; @xcite ) , in order to convert to the flux at 1.4  ghz in @xcite to the flux at 1  ghz adopted in the srcut model .",
    "small variation of the assumed @xmath5 does not significantly affect our spectral analysis results .",
    "the spectra of the three epic camera ( mos-1 , mos-2 , and pn ) are jointly fitted with all the parameters linked , except for a constant normalization factor subjected to all the model components .",
    "this normalization factor is used to account for the possible difference in area scale and calibration bias of the spectra extracted from different instruments . as shown in fig .",
    "[ paperifig : fitgoodness]a , b , it is close to 1 over the entire remnant , with slightly larger bias appears near the gaps between different ccd chips .",
    "this bias will not significantly affect our results , however .",
    "therefore , in the following analyses and discussions of this paper , we will directly use the parameters from jointly fitting the mos-1 , mos-2 , and pn spectra , without considering the normalization factor .",
    "we also add a gain correction to the response file of the pn spectrum ( adopting the `` gain '' model in xspec ) .",

    "the ew maps are then constructed by subtracting the _ total _ continuum images from the original narrow band images , and then being divided by the _",
    "thermal _ continuum images .",
    "the ew maps constructed with this spatially - resolved spectroscopy method have relatively high spatial resolution comparable to the original narrow band images , and are related to the thermal component only .",
    "since we have reset the abundances of all the elements to zero , small residuals in spectral fitting of the line band will not affect the ew calculation significantly , as long as other parameters of the thermal component ( e.g. , the normalization , temperature , and ionization parameter ) are well constrained .",
    "we caution that the presence of heavy elements will not only affect the emission lines , but also the thermal continuum . when the metal abundances are high , the thermal continuum could even be dominated by the heavy elements instead of hydrogen and helium .",
    "therefore , the thermal - to - non - thermal continuum ratio may change significantly by setting the abundances of heavy elements to zero and the line images could be largely contaminated by the underlying thermal continuum from heavy elements .",
    "therefore , the ew map constructed this way should contain the contributions from both emission lines and the thermal continuum produced by heavy elements , and should be adopted as an upper limit of the true ew .",
    "in order to check the reliability of parameter maps presented in the following sections , we extract spectra from larger regions ( than the tessellated meshes ) enclosing some interesting features .",
    "these regions are denoted in fig .",

    "we caution that there is generally a poor fitting of these high - counting - statistic spectra with this simple 1-t thermal plasma model , and the fitted parameters are only valid for a general comparison of the trend among different regions .",

    "the fitted parameters are typically lower than the averaged parameters , especially for @xmath99 , and the o , ne , mg , si abundances .",

    "as shown on the parameter maps ( e.g. , fig .",
    "[ paperifig:2dspec_paraimg ] ) , these extreme values are just in a few isolated meshes , but could significantly bias the average value of certain parameters in a large region .",

    "we use three different ways to describe the spatial distribution of emission lines from different ions : ( 1 ) the abundance map constructed with spatially resolved spectroscopy ( hereafter 2-d spec method ) ; ( 2 ) the ew map constructed with either linear interpolation of the continuum ( hereafter linear ew method ) or ( 3 ) the continuum measured from the thermal component of the spatially resolved spectral modeling ( hereafter 2-d spec ew method ) . in principle",

    "after removing all the bright point - like sources , we extract the spectra of sky background in an annulus with radii of @xmath152 and centered at ( @xmath153 , @xmath154 ) ( fig .  [ paperifig : tricolorregions ] ) .",
    "we fit the spectra with a `` vmekal+power law '' model subjected to the foreground absorption plus a second mekal model with solar abundance and no foreground absorption . here",
    "the vmekal and mekal models represent thermal plasma in an equilibrium ionization state with or without relative abundances set . the first thermal component ( vmekal )",
    "characterize the combined contribution from the possibly scattered light from the remnant as well as the background radiation from the galactic corona .",
    "the abundances of some key elements , for example , o , ne , fe , are set free in order to account for some prominent emission line features .",
    "the power law component , on the other hand , is used to characterize the possible contribution from the scattered light of the non - thermal arcs and the cosmic background mainly consists of unresolved active galactic nuclei ( agn ) ( e.g. , @xcite ) . the second thermal plasma component ( mekal )",
    "represents the contribution from the local hot bubble , which is a structure in the solar neighbourhood , and is assumed to have solar abundance and no foreground absorption .",
    "the temperature of this component is fixed at 0.1  kev @xcite .",
    "such a background analysis is not aimed at well describing the sky background physically , but at roughly characterizing different components of the sky background for subtraction from the source spectra .",
    "a similar double subtraction procedure is often used in the study of extended sources ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "fitting the background spectra with the above model results in a temperature of the vmekal component of @xmath155 and subsolar abundances .",
    "these are consistent with the vmekal component of mainly galactic halo in origin ( e.g. , @xcite ) and a negligible contribution from the scattered light of the snr .",
    "the power law component has a photon index of @xmath156 ( slightly different for different instruments ) , significantly smaller than that of the synchrotron emission from the non - thermal arcs ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but roughly consistent with primarily cosmic in origin ( from distant agn ) in both photon index and intensity ( fig .",
    "[ paperifig : bkgspec ] ; @xcite ) .",
    "this also indicates a negligible contribution from the scattered light of the non - thermal arcs of the snr .",
    "the above spectral analysis indicates a negligible contribution of the scattered light of the snr to the sky background .",
    "the reason for this low scattering is that the foreground ( and so dust ) column density toward sn1006 is low ( @xmath25 ; @xcite ) , given that sn1006 lies high above the galactic plane .",
    "we further examine the azimuthal variation of the sky background to confirm this conclusion .",
    "x - ray emission of sn1006 shows significant azimuthal variation in both spectral shape and total intensity .",
    "therefore , the sky background may have non - negligible azimuthal variations if the scattered light is important .",
    "we examine this possibility by extracting background spectra from each of the four quadrants of the annulus as shown in fig .",
    "[ paperifig : tricolorregions ] , with azimuthal angles of @xmath157 , @xmath158 , @xmath159 , and @xmath160 from west . as shown in fig .",
    "[ paperifig : bkgspec ] , the flux variation in different quadrants is small , and could be largely attributed to the variation of the effective area scale of different regions . the scatter of the intrinsic intensity of the sky background is @xmath161 ( at @xmath162 confidence level ) . since the sky background only contributes a small fraction of the flux in the source regions ( e.g. , fig .",
    "[ paperifig : spec_mesh ] ) , this fluctuation in background flux should have negligible effect on spectral modeling . furthermore , we do not find any significant spectral variation in the four quadrants .",
    "in fact , the models of the four quadrants shown in fig .",
    "[ paperifig : bkgspec ] are exactly the same as that of the integrated spectra of the whole annulus , except for a constant normalization factor multiplied to all the model components . in conclusion",

    "<S> we construct equivalent width ( ew ) maps based on continuum interpolation with the spectral model of each regions . </S>",
    "<S> we then compare the ew maps of , ,  k@xmath7 , ne , mg , , , and s lines constructed with this method to those constructed with linear interpolation . </S>",
    "<S> we further extract spectra from larger regions to confirm the features revealed by parameter and ew maps , which are often not directly detectable on x - ray intensity images . </S>",
    "<S> for example , o abundance is consistent with solar across the snr , except for a low - abundance hole in the center . </S>",
    "<S> this `` o hole '' has enhanced k@xmath7 and fe emissions , indicating recently reverse shocked ejecta , but also has the highest @xmath3 , indicating forward shocked ism . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , a multi - temperature model is needed to decompose these components . </S>",
    "<S> the asymmetric metal distributions suggest there is either an asymmetric explosion of the sn or an asymmetric distribution of the ism . </S>"
