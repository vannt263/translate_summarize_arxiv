    "control and optimization of quantum systems have been recognized as important issues for many years  @xcite and control theory for quantum systems has been developed since the 1980s  @xcite .",
    "there has been considerable recent progress in both theory and experiment  @xcite . however , despite this progress , there are still many challenges .",
    "most quantum control schemes rely on open - loop control design based on mathematical models of the system to be controlled . however , accurate models are not often not available , especially for manufactured quantum systems such as artificial quantum dot atoms or molecules .",
    "therefore , system identification  @xcite is a crucial prerequisite for quantum control .    in the quantum information domain ,",
    "procedures for characterization of quantum dynamical maps are often known as quantum - process tomography ( qpt )  @xcite and many schemes have been proposed to identify the unitary ( or completely positive ) processes , for example , standard quantum - process tomography ( sqpt )  @xcite , ancilla - assisted process tomography ( aapt )  @xcite and direct characterization of quantum dynamics ( dcqd )  @xcite . however ,",
    "if control of the system s dynamics is the objective , what we really need to characterize is not a global process but the generators of the dynamical evolution such as the hamiltonian and dissipation operators .",
    "the problem of hamiltonian tomography ( ht ) , though less well - understood , has also begun to be considered recently by a few authors  @xcite .",
    "although qpt and ht differ in various regards , both try to infer information about the quantum dynamics from experiments performed on systems , and both can be studied from the point of view of system identification with broad tasks including ( 1 ) experimental design and data gathering , ( 2 ) choice of model sets and model calculation , and ( 3 ) model validation .",
    "recently the quantum system identification problem has been briefly explored from cybernetical point of view , and underlining the important role of experimental design  @xcite . in this article",
    "we follow this line of inquiry . throughout the paper , we make the following basic assumptions : ( 1 ) the quantum system can be repeatedly initialized in a ( limited ) set of known states ; ( 2 ) that we can let the system evolve for a desired time @xmath0 ; and ( 3 ) that some projective measurements can be performed on the quantum system .",
    "the main question we are interested in in this context is how the choice of the initialization and measurement affect the amount of information we can acquire about the dynamics of the system . given any a limited range of options for the experimental design , e.g. , a range of measurements we could perform , different choices for the initial states , or different control hamiltonians , how to choose the best experimental design , and what are the theoretical limitations ?",
    "finally , we are interested in efficient ways to extracting the relevant information from noisy experimental data .    the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we discuss the model and basic design assumptions .",
    "sec iii deals with the general question of model identifiability in various settings , and in sec iv we compare several different stategies for parameter estimation from a limited set of noisy data from simulated experiments see how they measure up .",
    "to keep the analysis tractable we consider a simple model of a qubit subject to a hamiltonian @xmath1 and a system - bath interaction modelled by a single lindblad operator @xmath2 , i.e. , with system dynamics governed by the master equation @xmath3+\\d[v](\\rho),\\ ] ] where the lindbladian dissipation term is given by @xmath4(\\rho ) = v \\rho v^\\dag - \\tfrac{1}{2}(v^\\dag v + v v^\\dag).\\ ] ] we shall further simplify the problem by assuming that @xmath2 is a hermitian operator representing a depolarizing channel or pure phase relaxation in some basis . without loss of generality we can choose the basis so that @xmath2 is diagonal , in fact we can choose @xmath5 with @xmath6 and @xmath7 . under these assumptions",
    "the master equation simplifies @xmath8(\\rho ) = \\tfrac{\\gamma}{2}(\\sz\\rho\\sz-\\rho).\\ ] ] the control hamiltonian can be expanded with respect to the pauli basis @xmath9 @xmath10 with possibly time - dependent coefficients @xmath11 .",
    "it is convenient to consider a real representation of the system . following the approach in @xcite",
    "we expand @xmath12 with respect to the standard pauli basis for the @xmath13 hermitian matrices @xmath14 where the coefficients are @xmath15 .",
    "similarly expanding the dynamical operators allows us to recast eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) in following bloch equation ( @xmath16 ) @xmath17    using this simple model for illustration we subsequently consider the experimental design from three aspects : ( 1 ) initialization procedures , ( 2 ) measurement choice and ( 3 ) hamiltonian design .    * ( 1 ) initialization .",
    "* we assume the ability to prepare the system in some initial state @xmath18 with respect to the basis @xmath19 , which coincides with the eigenbasis of @xmath2 .",
    "we can formally represent the initialization procedure by the operator @xmath20 , which is the projector onto the state @xmath21 , with @xmath22 indicating initialization . with these restrictions",
    "the design of the initialization procedure is reduced to the selection of parameter @xmath23 .",
    "note that we assume that we can only prepare one fixed initial state , not a full set of basis states .    *",
    "( 2 ) measurement .",
    "* we assume the ability to perform a two - outcome projective measurement @xmath24 where the measurement basis states can be written as    [ m+- ] @xmath25    so that the choice of the measurement can be reduced to suitable choice of the parameter @xmath26 , and we shall indicate this by writing @xmath27 .    * ( 3 ) hamiltonian . * in practice we may or may not have the freedom to choose the type of hamiltonian but it will be instructive to consider the identification problem for the following three cases :    * @xmath28 and @xmath29 . * @xmath30 and @xmath31 . *",
    "@xmath32 and @xmath33 .    in this context",
    "the experimental design problem can be reduced to the problem of choosing suitable values @xmath23 and @xmath34 to identify the system parameters @xmath35 and @xmath36 in each of the three cases above .",
    "the problem considered here is similar to that considered in @xcite , in particular we still only allow a single initial state and single fixed measurement , but unlike in @xcite the initial state and the measurement are not assumed to commute with the dephasing operator .",
    "we now consider the identification problem for the dephasing qubit system , concentrating on _ experimental design _",
    "issues for simultaneously discriminating dephasing parameter and hamiltonian parameter of two - level dephasing systems .",
    "in this special case @xmath1 commutes with the dephasing operator @xmath2 . solving the equation @xmath38 with the initial state ( [ iv ] )",
    "gives @xmath39 and applying the binary - outcome projective measurement @xmath27 yields the measurement traces @xmath40 $ ] .",
    "defining @xmath41 , we have @xmath42 from which we can see that we can obtain information about the system parameters @xmath43 and @xmath35 if and only if @xmath44 and @xmath45 , i.e. , if neither the initial state preparation @xmath20 nor the measurement @xmath46 commutes with @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the measurement traces also yield information about @xmath47 and @xmath26 , i.e. , we can determine the relative angles between the initialization and measurement axis and the fixed hamiltonian / dephasing axis , if they are not known a - priori .",
    "we also see that the visibility is maximized if @xmath48 , which will be the case if the initialization and measurement axis are orthogonal to the joint hamiltonian and dephasing axis .",
    "these results make physical sense . as @xmath49=0 $ ] ,",
    "if the initial state preparation @xmath20 commutes with @xmath1 and @xmath2 then the initial state is a stationary state of the dynamics and the measurement outcome is constant in time @xmath50 . if @xmath51 then the initial state is not stationary and the state follows a spiral path towards the joint hamiltonian and dephasing axis but as both @xmath1 and @xmath2 are proportional to @xmath52 , @xmath53 $ ] is a conserved quantity of the dynamics . if @xmath54 then the measurement commutes with @xmath52 , and as @xmath55 $ ] is a conserved quantity , we again obtain no information about the dynamics from which to identify the system parameters .      in this case",
    ", the equation  ( [ 7 ] ) is reduced into the following equation @xmath57 and the solution of eq .",

    "if @xmath63 , the expression @xmath64 must be analytically continued .",
    "( [ 5 - 8c ] ) implies that we can obtain the estimated value of the following probabilities @xmath65 noting that @xmath66 depends on both @xmath67 and @xmath35 this shows that we can obtain full information about the system parameters if and only if @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "if @xmath70 or @xmath71 then we can still identify @xmath35 but not @xmath67 .",
    "again this makes sense .",
    "@xmath72 for @xmath73 , i.e. , if the initial state is an eigenstate of the hamiltonian . since @xmath49\\neq 0 $ ] in this case , eigenstates of @xmath1 are not stationary .",
    "however , since the hamiltonian and dephasing axis are _ orthogonal _ , the initial state remains in a plane orthogonal to the dephasing axis , the @xmath74 plane in our case , following the path @xmath75 .",
    "thus we have @xmath76=0 $ ] for all times , and we can therefore not obtain any information about the hamiltonian parameter @xmath67 , but we can still obtain information about the dephasing parameter @xmath35 . if the hamiltonian and dephasing axis were not orthogonal then we would expect to be able to identify both the hamiltonian and dephasing parameters even if the initial state was an eigenstate of @xmath1 as in this case it would not remain an eigenstate of @xmath1 under the evolution .    if @xmath77 but @xmath78 then the measurement commutes with the hamiltonian . transforming to the heisenberg picture , @xmath79 -\\tfrac{\\gamma}{2 } \\d[\\sz]m_{\\pm}(t ) , \\ ] ] and again one can show that @xmath80 remains orthogonal to the dephasing axis and @xmath81=\\tr[m_{\\pm}\\rho(t)]$ ] is independent of the hamiltonian @xmath1 , explaining why we can not obtain any information about @xmath1 in this case .      in this case equation ( [ 7 ] ) is reduced into the following equation @xmath83 whose solution for the initial state ( [ iv ] ) is @xmath84 where @xmath85 and    @xmath86\\\\   \\phi_{33}^y(t ) & = e^{-\\tfrac{\\gamma}{2}{t } }   [ \\cos\\widehat{\\omega}_{y}t+\\tfrac{\\gamma}{2\\widehat{\\omega}_{y } }    \\sin\\widehat{\\omega}_{y}t]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this implies that we can obtain the estimated value of the probabilities @xmath87 where the coefficient functions are    [ eq : modelc : coeff ] @xmath88    as before , if @xmath89 then @xmath62 will be purely imaginary and the sine and cosine terms above turn into their respective hyperbolic sine and cosine equivalents , and if @xmath90 , the expression @xmath91 must be analytically continued .    in this case",
    "it is quite interesting to notice that it is impossible to find such @xmath23 and @xmath34 that @xmath92 and thus that we can identify both model parameters for any choice of the initial state and measurement .",
    "this also makes sense because regardless of the choice of @xmath47 and @xmath26 the initial state in this case is always orthgonal to the hamiltonian axis , and the measurement @xmath46 is always orthogonal to @xmath1 , @xmath93\\neq 0 $ ] , there are no conserved quantities and the only stationary state of the system is the completely mixed state .",
    "in this section we explore how to estimate dephasing and hamiltonian parameters from limited noisy measurement data . in an actual experiment we can only estimate the probabilities @xmath94 at a finite number of times @xmath95 by repeatedly initializing the system in some fixed state @xmath96 , and letting it evolve for time @xmath95 before performing the projective measurement @xmath46 .",
    "each single repetition of the experiment yields a binary outcome @xmath97 or @xmath98 and we can estimate the probability @xmath99 by repeating the experiment @xmath100 times and computing the relative frequencies of the respective measurement outcomes @xmath101 , e.g. , @xmath102 .    to model noisy experimental data",
    "we could generate @xmath103 by adding a zero - mean white - gaussian noise signal @xmath104 to @xmath105 , i.e. , @xmath106 . by the law of large numbers and iterated - logarithm law  @xcite this",
    "gives a gaussian distribution @xmath107 with mean @xmath105 and variance @xmath108 for @xmath109 .",
    "for @xmath100 large this should be a good error model , but for small @xmath100 it may not accurately capture the nature of the projection noise , which follows a poisson distribution .",
    "to more accurately model noisy experimental data when the number of measurement repetitions is relatively small we can simulate the actual experiment by generating @xmath100 random numbers @xmath110 between @xmath111 and @xmath112 , drawn from a uniform distribution , and setting @xmath113 , where @xmath114 is the number of @xmath115 .",
    "one commonly used technique to find frequency components in a noisy time - domain signal is the fourier transform or its discrete version , the discrete or fast fourier transform ( fft ) . in principle",
    ", this allows us to estimate the hamiltonian parameters ( frequencies ) @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath118  @xcite , and the damping rate @xmath35 can be estimated from the lorentzian broadening of the fourier peak  @xcite .",
    "when the signal is sparse , i.e. , we only have a relatively small number of sample points , and noisy , however , this approach becomes problematic .",
    "[ fig : exp1 ] shows that we can still identify a peak in the spectrum for sparse noisy signals but the accuracy of the estimate is limited , and accurately estimating the dephasing rate @xmath35 from the broadening of the peak , given the distortion , is very challenging .",
    "alternatively , once an estimated value for @xmath116 has been obtained , @xmath35 can be deduced in other ways . in the simplest case",
    "a , where the evolution is given by eq .",
    "( [ 5 - 10b ] ) , we have @xmath119 which we can rewrite as @xmath120 given @xmath121 , if @xmath47 , @xmath26 and @xmath43 are known , we can therefore in principle calculate @xmath122 and thus @xmath123 .",
    "however , in practice the problem is that @xmath124 and all the other parameters are not known precisely . in this case",
    "we could estimate @xmath35 using the least square method  @xcite and the principle of sequential analysis@xcite .    to explore this approach we generated simulated noisy data signals @xmath125 with standard deviation @xmath126 according to the procedure above , assuming @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 and the sampled period @xmath130s .",
    "if the number of measurements @xmath100 at each time @xmath0 is @xmath131 then the standard deviation of estimated error is @xmath132 .",
    "the original noiseless probability @xmath121 , the noisy signal with standard deviation @xmath133 and the power spectral density are shown in fig.[figp ] . again",
    "the frequency @xmath116 can be easily determined by the peak value in fig .",
    "[ figp](right ) .",
    "we attempt to determine @xmath123 based on @xmath125 using simulated time - series . for a single time series @xmath125 the distribution of @xmath123 around the true value of @xmath134 is shown in fig .",
    "[ figm](left ) .",
    "the estimation is unsatisfactory even if the signal is sampled densely at a high time resolution .",
    "the results can be noticeably improved by averaging over multiple time - series of @xmath125 .",
    "if the mean value of the @xmath35-estimates over several time series is used as the final estimate for @xmath35 , the estimated error of @xmath123 can be remarkably reduced as shown in fig .",
    "[ figm ] ( right ) , which indicates the mean value of @xmath123 with @xmath135 time - series respectively .",
    "the number of simulated time - series of @xmath125 required is determined by the desired estimation accuracy . to achieve a mean value of the distribution of ca .",
    "@xmath134 with standard deviation less than @xmath136 simulations suggest that at least @xmath137 time - series with @xmath131 are necessary , i.e. , about @xmath138 measurements have to be performed at each sample time @xmath0 to ensure that the standard deviation of the estimated error is less than @xmath136 . instead of five time series with @xmath131",
    "we could choose four times series with @xmath139 or two with @xmath140 to reach the nearly same estimation accuracy , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figh ] . in the actual experiment",
    "one can obtain the mean - value sequence of @xmath123 by continually updating @xmath141 at each sampled time @xmath0 .",
    "if the mean - value sequence is found to converge to a certain fixed value and its standard deviation satisfies the requirement , the experiment measurement should be stopped .                to estimate @xmath35 by finite measurement data",
    "one will have to identify a suitable time @xmath142 when to terminate the experiment , ideally when the true value of @xmath143 is almost @xmath111 .",
    "a @xmath144 is almost equal to @xmath145 for @xmath146 , the signal after this time will be effectively a pure noise signal . therefore increasing the signal length beyond a certain critical time @xmath147",
    "will not improve the estimation accuracy .",
    "furthermore , we consider the effect of different @xmath116 and @xmath35 on the estimation accuracy .",
    "if the true value of @xmath35 is less than the value of @xmath134 above , the estimation of @xmath116 and @xmath35 will be more accurate ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ figa ] ) as the exponential @xmath148 decays more slowly .",
    "if the value of @xmath116 is reduced , i.e. , the oscillation period is increased while its envelope remains unchanged the accuracy of the estimation is not influenced ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fige ] ) .",
    "the previous section shows that we can in principle simultaneously identify both dephasing parameter and hamiltonian parameters for simple open systems using fourier and time - series analysis . both fourier and",
    "time - series analysis can deal with very noisy signals but they require rather dense sampling of the signal with is both time - consuming and resource - intensive .",
    "ideally we would like to be able to estimate the parameters by sparse sampling the signal .",
    "one promising approach in this regard is bayesian estimation .",
    "the main idea behind the bayesian approach is to choose the parameters to be determined , here @xmath149 and @xmath35 , to maximize a certain likelihood function @xmath150.\\ ] ] where @xmath151 is the measured data and the @xmath152 are the probabilities predicted by the model , which depend on the parameters to be determined , and @xmath153 is the error variance .",
    "following the same approach as in @xcite , we write the signals as a linear combination a small number of basis functions determined by the functional form of the signals . here",
    "the measurement signals @xmath154 can be written as a linear combination of two basis functions @xmath155 the values of the basis functions and the coefficients are given in table  [ table1 ]    .chosen basis functions and coefficients for bayesian estimation . @xmath156 .",
    "@xmath157 . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     figs  [ fig : bayesiana][fig : bayesianc ] show that bayesian analysis allows us to estimate the model parameters not only for case a but for all cases , even if the signal is very noisy , the sampling is sparse and the measurement and initialization choices are not ideal to maximize the visibility or signal - to - noise ratio such as @xmath158 and @xmath159 .",
    "the squeezed peaks indicate that the accuracy of the frequency estimation is much higher than the accuracy of the @xmath35-estimates .",
    "an additional advantage of the bayesian estimation does not require a - priori knowledge of the initialization or measurement angles @xmath47 and @xmath26 .",
    "rather , the estimation procedure provides values for the coefficients of the basis functions , which are related to the parameters @xmath47 and @xmath26 .",
    "we have studied the issue of model identifiability and experiment design for open system dynamics for a dephasing qubit . from the examples in sec .",
    "iii we can derive some general insights about the limits of identifiability and the role of experiment design .",
    "unlike for process tomography , where we require the ability to prepare the system in many different input states , and the ability to measure a complete set of observables , we can in general extract information about both the hamiltonian and the dephasing parameters by repeating a single experiment , initializing the system in single fixed initial state and measuring a fixed basis .",
    "there are certain limitations , however .",
    "we gain no information about the value of the system parameters if the initial state is a _ stationary state _ of the system , or if the measurement is a _ conserved quantity _ , although knowledge of the stationary states or conserved quantities restricts the dynamics and thus provides indirect information about the system",
    ". even if the initial state is not stationary or the measurement is not a conserved quantity , we may fail to obtain information about the hamiltonian parameters is if the operators @xmath1 and @xmath2 are orthogonal and @xmath46 commutes with @xmath1 , for instance .",
    "these limitations also apply to higher dimensional systems , although for such systems additional restrictions on the identifiability of model parameters may arise .    if the experiment design is such that the model parameters are identifiable there are various ways to extract the relevant parameters from a set of noisy samples ( time series ) , including fourier analysis , time series analysis and bayesian estimation .",
    "although all of these approaches are in principle able to provide the required information , bayesian estimation appears to be superior to the alternatives , in particular when we are dealing with a limited number of noisy data points .",
    "one reason the bayesian estimation is capable of providing far more accurate estimates for the parameters given the same input data is that it utilizes information about the structure of the signal in the form of the choice of the basis functions we are projecting onto .",
    "this allows us to overcome restrictions on the uncertainties of the parameter estimates imposed by nyquist s law .",

    "we would like to acknowledge daniel k. l. oi . for helpful comments and suggestions .",

    "we are interested in its absolute value @xmath169[\\gamma^2+(\\omega+\\omega_0)^2]}\\ ] ] differentiating with respect to @xmath149 and setting the numerator to @xmath111 shows that @xmath170 has extrema for @xmath171 , and in particular we have a maximum at @xmath172 with peak value @xmath173 .",
