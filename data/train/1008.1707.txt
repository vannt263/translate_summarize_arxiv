    "in this article we consider planar channeling of 855 mev electrons in silicon crystal using a new monte - carlo code .    channeling takes place if charged particles enter a single crystal at small angle with respect to crystallographic planes or axes @xcite .",
    "the particles get confined by the interplanar or axial potential and move preferably along the corresponding crystallographic planes or axes following their shape .",
    "recent revival of the interest to this phenomenon is due to its growing practical application . in particular , the crystals with bent crystallographic planes",
    "are used to steer high - energy charged particle beams replacing huge dipole magnets . since its appearance @xcite and first experimental verification @xcite",
    "this idea has been attracting a lot of interest worldwide .",
    "bent crystal have been routinely used for beam extraction in the institute for high energy physics , russia @xcite .",
    "series of experiment on the bent crystal deflection of proton and heavy ion beams were performed at different accelerators @xcite throughout the world .",
    "the bent crystal method has been proposed to extract particles from the beam halo at cern large hadron collider @xcite . the possibility to deflect",
    "positron @xcite and electron @xcite beams has been studied as well .",
    "another very promising application of the channeling phenomenon is a novel source of hard electromagnetic radiation .",
    "a single crystal with periodically bent crystallographic planes can force channeling particles to move along nearly sinusoidal trajectories and radiate in hard x and gamma ray frequency range .",
    "the feasibility of such a device , known as the crystalline undulator  , was demonstrated theoretically a decade ago @xcite ( further developments as well as historical references are reviewed in @xcite ) .",
    "the advantage of the crystalline undulator is in extremely strong electrostatic fields inside a crystal , which are able to steer the particles much more effectively than even the most advanced superconductive magnets .",
    "this fact allows to make the period @xmath0 of the crystalline undulator in the hundred or even ten micron range , which is two to three orders of magnitude smaller than that of conventional undulator .",
    "therefore the wavelength of the produced radiation @xmath1 ( @xmath2@xmath3 being the lorentz factor of the particle ) can reach the ( sub)picometer range , where conventional sources with comparable intensity are unavailable @xcite .",
    "initially , it was proposed to use positron beams in the crystalline undulator .",
    "positively charged particles are repelled by the crystal nuclei and , therefore , they move between the crystal planes , where there are no atomic nuclei and the electron density is less then average .",
    "this reduces the probability of random collisions with the crystal constituents .",
    "hence , the transverse momentum of the particle increases slowly and the particle travels a longer distance in the channeling regime .",
    "more recently , an electron based crystalline undulator has been proposed @xcite . on one hand , electrons are less preferable than positrons . due to their negative charge ,",
    "the electrons are attracted by the lattice ions and , therefore , are forced to oscillate around the crystal plane in the process of channeling .",
    "the probability of collisions with crystal constituents is enhanced .",
    "thus , the dechanneling length is smaller by about two orders of magnitude in comparison to that of positrons at the same conditions . on the other hand ,",
    "the electron beams are easier available and are usually of higher intensity and quality .",
    "therefore , from the practical point of view , electron based crystalline undulator has its own advantages and deserves a thorough investigation .",
    "there is another reason why electron channeling needs a thorough analysis .",
    "this is the disagreement between theory and experimental data .",
    "for example , the baier - katkov - strakhovenko formula for the dechanneling length ( equation ( 10.1 ) in @xcite ) , @xmath4 , predicts @xmath5 m for @xmath6 gev electrons in si ( 110 ) planar channel , while the measured value is @xmath7 m @xcite .    for lower energies ,",
    "the discrepancy is much more dramatic : @xmath8 m calculated vs. @xmath9 m measured @xcite and @xmath10 m calculated vs. @xmath11 m measured @xcite for electron energies @xmath12 mev and @xmath13 mev , respectively .    clearly ,",
    "further theoretical and experimental investigations of the electron channeling are necessary ( see also @xcite ) . no accurate theoretical description of the electron deflection by bent crystals or the electron - based crystalline undulator is possible until an adequate and experimentally verified theoretical or numerical model of electron channeling is available .    to build such a model , we developed a new monte - carlo code that allows to simulate the particle channeling and calculate the emitted radiation .",
    "in contrast to other channeling codes @xcite , our algorithm does not use the continuous potential approximation .",
    "this novel feature is especially beneficial in the case of negatively charged projectiles , which channel in the vicinity of the atomic nuclei , where the continuous potential approximation becomes less accurate .    in this paper",
    "we present the first results obtained with our code .",
    "we have studied the channeling of 855 mev electrons in a straight single crystal of silicon along three different crystallographic planes : ( 100 ) , ( 110 ) and ( 111 ) .",
    "the parameters of the simulation correspond to the conditions of the channeling experiments at mainz microtron ( germany ) @xcite . to verify our results",
    ", we calculated the dependence of the intensity of the channeling radiation on the crystal dimension along the beam direction and compared to the experimental data .",
    "our model is intended for studying the interaction of ultrarelativistic projectiles with single crystals .",
    "it is best suited for light projectiles : electrons and positrons , but it can be also used for ultrarelativistic heavy projectiles .    due to the high speed of the projectile ,",
    "its interaction time with a crystal atom is very short .",
    "the atomic electrons have no time to move during the interaction . as a result ,",
    "the projectile ` sees ' a ` snapshot ' of the atom : the atomic electrons are seen as point - like charges at fixed positions around the nucleus ( see figure [ atom ] ) .",
    "the larger and smaller circles represent the nucleus and the electrons , respectively .",
    "the dashed line shows the thomas - fermi radius of the atom.,width=453 ]    the probability density to see the atomic electrons at positions @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 ( @xmath18 is the atomic number ) is given by squared absolute value of the wave function of the atom : @xmath19 and initial speed @xmath20 along @xmath21-axis attains after interaction with a static charge @xmath22 a transverse momentum @xmath23 @xmath24 is the vector connecting the projections of the projectile and the static charge onto the @xmath25-plane .",
    "the total transverse momentum attained by the projectile in the collision with the atom is a vector sum of ( [ pperp ] ) over all atom constituents .",
    "the absolute value of the projectile momentum remains unchanged .",
    "this means that the projectile energy losses for ionisation or excitation of the atom are neglected .",
    "indeed , the ionization losses of high energy electrons or positrons in matter are very small ( see , for example , figure 27.10 in @xcite ) .",
    "the above procedure is approximate .",
    "it is valid if the scattering angle @xmath26 is small . in the opposite case , not only formula ( [ pperp ] ) but also",
    "the representation of the atom as a collection of static charges become wrong . however , accurate description of the large angle scattering is not important for modelling of the channeling processes",
    ". first , such processes are rare .",
    "second , if the projectile is scattered by an angle that is much larger than the critical ( lindhard s ) angle @xmath27 @xcite , its probability to return to the channeling regime is negligible",
    ". therefore the trajectory of a projectile after a large - angle scattering is out of our interest and the precise value of the large scattering angle does not matter .    on the other hand ,",
    "the scattering by @xmath28 is important for a proper modelling of the channeling phenomenon .",
    "lindhard s angle for ultrarelativistic projectiles is typically of submiliradian range .",
    "the described procedure as well as formula ( [ pperp ] ) are valid for such small scattering angles .",
    "the ` snapshot ' model is applied not only to each atom but also to the crystal as a whole .",
    "the thermal motion of the atoms is even slower than the motion of atomic electrons .",
    "therefore , the projectile sees the atomic nuclei ` frozen ' at random positions in the vicinity of nodes of the crystal lattice .",
    "the probability distribution of the position of the nucleus relative to the node can be approximated by a three dimensional normal distribution with the variance equal to the squared amplitude of thermal vibrations of the crystal atoms .",
    "although the crystal constituents are considered as static point - like charges , and the model looks like completely classical construction at the first sight , the quantum properties of the crystal are properly taken into account : the probability distributions of electrons and nuclei are found from the quantum theory .",
    "in contrast , the quantum aspects of the projectile motion are indeed completely ignored .",
    "our code performs calculation of trajectories of the projectiles in the crystal .",
    "calculation of a particle trajectory implies that its coordinate and momentum can be measured simultaneously .",
    "let us estimate the validity domain of this approximation .",
    "the notion of trajectory makes sense in the case of a channeling particle if one is able to determine the particle coordinate @xmath29 and the transverse momentum @xmath30 with accuracies @xmath31 and @xmath32 that are much smaller than the channel width @xmath33 and typical value @xmath34 of the transverse momentum of a channeling particle . on the other hand",
    ", the product @xmath35 can not be smaller than @xmath36 due to the heisenberg s uncertainty principle .",
    "we obtain , therefore , the following inequality : @xmath37 the transverse motion of the projectile can be described by the laws of dynamics of a nonrelativistic particle with the mass @xmath38 .",
    "here @xmath39 is the projectile energy and @xmath40 is the speed of light .",
    "the transverse kinetic energy of the channeling particle can not exceed the depth of the interplanar potential well @xmath41 : @xmath42 combining ( [ heisenberg ] ) and ( [ kinenergy ] ) one sees that projectile can be considered classically if its energy @xmath39 is sufficiently large : @xmath43 putting @xmath44 ev and @xmath45    one obtains @xmath46 mev .",
    "however , the sign @xmath47 in this inequality has to be understood as at least three orders of magnitude larger. to show this , let us consider a simple example of a parabolic potential well of depth @xmath41 and width @xmath33 : @xmath48 the oscillation frequency in such potential for a particle with the mass @xmath38 is @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the second derivative of the potential energy with respect to @xmath29 . from ( [ parabola ] )",
    "one finds @xmath51 .",
    "the number of quantum levels in the potential well is @xmath52 solving ( [ nlevels ] ) for @xmath39 yields @xmath53 the right hand sides of ( [ totenergy_qq ] ) and ( [ totenergy_approx ] ) coincide up to the factor of @xmath54 .",
    "the classical description is valid if the number of levels is sufficiently large .",
    "taking @xmath55 one obtains @xmath56 .",
    "hence , our model can be always applied to ultrarelativistic heavy projectiles .",
    "it is applicable in the case of light projectiles if their energy is in hundred mev range or higher .",
    "the applicability conditions for electron projectile may be somewhat stricter than for positrons , because the planar potential well is narrower in the case of negative particles . in the present paper",
    "we apply the model to electron projectiles at energy @xmath57 mev . in this case",
    "the classical approximation is expected to be satisfactory .",
    "the process of radiation emission by the projectile is also treated classically .",

    "the integration over the time @xmath68 is taken from the moment @xmath69 of entering to the moment @xmath70 of existing the crystal by the projectile .",
    "the classical approach is valid for relatively soft radiation : the photon energy has to be much smaller than the energy of the projectile : @xmath71 .",
    "the code performs 3d simulation of the motion of ultrarelativistic charged particles in a single crystal .",
    "the crystal lattice is modelled as a collection of nodes .",
    "each node is represented by the radius vector of its position and a few vectors , called ` bonds ' , connecting the node to all its nearest neighbours .    in the case of diamond - type lattice",

    "the lattice is built as follows .",
    "a node is placed at the origin of the coordinate system .",
    "the ` bonds ' of this node are oriented as described below .",
    "then the lattice is ` grown ' by placing new nodes at free ends of the ` bonds ' until the necessary space region is filled with the lattice .    to study the channeling along the crystallographic plane defined by the miller indices",
    "@xmath78 the lattice has to be oriented in such a way that its @xmath78 plane is parallel to the coordinate plane @xmath79 , where @xmath21 is the beam direction .",
    "this is accomplished by the proper orientation of the ` bonds ' of the initial node . at the beginning ,",

    "all four ` bonds ' ( [ b1])([b4 ] ) are multiplied by this matrix : @xmath86 , @xmath87 .",

    "the angle @xmath89 has to be carefully chosen to avoid collinearity of major crystal axes with the coordinate axis @xmath21 .    in a similar way",
    ", a crystal axis can be oriented along the beam direction @xmath21 to simulate axial channeling .",
    "there is also a possibility of a random orientation of the crystal avoiding incidental orientation of major crystal directions along the beam axis . in this case",
    "the crystal scatters particles as an amorphous medium . this regime can be used to calculate the incoherent bremsstrahlung .",
    "once the lattice is constructed , the atoms are placed in its nodes .",
    "each atom is a collection of electric charges : a nucleus with the charge @xmath90 and @xmath18 electrons with charges @xmath91 , @xmath92 in the case of silicon .",

    "the transverse position of the projectile at the entrance of the crystal was chosen randomly , homogeneously distributed along the channel width .",
    "then the trajectory of the particle was simulated as it is described in the previous section .",
    "the simulation of the trajectory was terminated if the particle went through the crystal : @xmath124 , or if the deviation of the projectile from its initial direction became too large : @xmath125 ( here @xmath126 and @xmath127 are respectively the transverse and the longitudinal momenta and @xmath128 is the lorentz factor of the projectile . )",
    "each simulated trajectory was analysed to determine the segments of the trajectory corresponding to the channeling and dechanneling regime .",
    "the particle was considered to be in the channeling regime if it changed the direction of the @xmath29 component of its velocity two or more times without crossing the channel boundaries , i.e. if it made at least one complete channeling oscillation . after crossing the boundary of the channel ,",
    "the particle was considered to be dechanneled until it performed another full channeling oscillation or until terminating the simulation of the trajectory .",
    "the number of the simulated trajectories for the analysis of dechanneling was 40000 , 30000 and about 28000 for planar channels ( 111 ) , ( 110 ) and ( 100 ) , respectively .",

    "to make a quantitative assessment of the particle dechanneling process , one needs a definition of the dechanneling length that would be suitable for the monte carlo approach .",

    "we define the quantity @xmath134 as the number of projectile particles for which @xmath135 , i.e. this is the number of particles that passed the distance from the crystal entrance to the point @xmath21 in the channeling regime and dechannel at some further point .",

    ", @xmath136 depends not only on @xmath21 , but also on the angular distribution of the particles at the crystal entrance .",

    "the corresponding term dominates the asymptotic behaviour at @xmath141 : @xmath142    the expression ( [ lz ] ) for @xmath136 has the following counterpart in the kinetic theory @xmath143 substituting ( [ nch0_diff_asymp ] ) into ( [ lz_diff ] ) demonstrates that , indeed , the coefficient @xmath144 cancels out and l(z ) becomes equal to @xmath4 in the asymptotic region .    although the diffusion equation was solved in @xcite for positively charged projectile in harmonic potential approximation , the exponential asymptotic behaviour of @xmath134 , and , consequently , a constant asymptotic value of @xmath136 is a more general result . as it will be shown in the next section ,",
    "our simulations demonstrate that it is also valid for electrons .",
    "hence , in our monte carlo procedure the dechanneling length @xmath4 is defined as the asymptotic value of @xmath136 in the region where it cease to depend on @xmath21 .",

    ", width=453 ]    rechanneling occurs more often for electrons than for positively charged particles .",
    "this is due to the fact that the random scattering is more intense in the vicinity of the crystal plane . for positively charged particles",
    "this means that the scattering is most probable at the top of the potential barrier , i.e. near the maximum of the potential energy @xmath150 . even if a collision happens to reduce the component @xmath151 of the projectile momentum to zero",
    ", the transverse energy @xmath152 still remains in the vicinity of the top of the potential barrier .",
    "the range of @xmath151 at which the particle returns to the channeling regime is zero at the maximum of the potential and is small in the vicinity of it .",
    "therefore , probability of the rechanneling is small .",
    "in contrast , the potential minimum for negatively charged particles is located near the crystal planes .",
    "this means that the random collisions are most probable near the minimum of the potential energy , where there is a wider range of @xmath151 at which @xmath152 drops below the potential barrier .",
    "hence , the probability of rechanneling is higher for negative than for positive particles .",
    "typical trajectories of electrons are shown in figure [ traj ] , where     @xmath131 m are plotted .",

    "the asymptotic behaviour of the curves in figure [ ich ] can be explained in the following way . at sufficiently large @xmath21 ,",
    "the distribution of the dechanneled particles with respect to the transverse momentum @xmath151 is similar to that in an amorphous medium and can be approximated by the gaussian function : @xmath153 \\label{gauss}\\ ] ] with the variance proportional to @xmath21 : @xmath154 .",
    "the rechanneling is dominated by the phase space density the vicinity of the point @xmath155 .",
    "it decreases as @xmath156 and governs the asymptotic behaviour of the fraction of the channeling particles shown in fig .",

    "similarly to @xmath172 , this quantity decreases fast with @xmath159 and has an exponential asymptote .",
    "it is possible to introduce the quantity @xmath173 , which is a counterpart of ( [ lz ] ) for rechanneled particles : @xmath174 the first sum in the numerator runs over all particles that rechanneled at least once .",

    ", width=453 ]    the behaviour of @xmath173 and @xmath136 ( see figure [ ld ] ) at small values of @xmath159 and @xmath21 is different , because the transverse momentum distribution of the rechanneling particles is quite different from that of the ideally parallel initial beam .",
    "but asymptotic behaviour of both quantities is essentially the same : they both reach a constant value , which is , by definition , the dechanneling length @xmath4 . in table",
    "[ ld_table ] , the values of @xmath4 obtained from the analysis of rechanneled particles is compared to those obtained for the initial beam .",
    "they coincide within the statistical errors .",
    "this confirms that the dechanneling length calculated according to our definition does not depend on the initial transverse momentum distribution of the projectiles .",
    "the dechanneling length can not be measured directly in an experiment because it is not possible to separate the particles that were in the channeling regime from the entrance point and the rechanneled particles .",
    "only signals related to the total number of channeling particles can be measured . extracting",
    "the dechanneling length from these data involves a model - dependent procedure .",
    "therefore , comparing the values of @xmath4 obtained by monte carlo simulations to estimations found in the experimental publications would be a comparison of two theoretical models rather than an experimental verification of the code .    a correct way to check a physical model and",
    "the corresponding computer code is to use it for calculation of those quantities that can be directly measured in an experiment .",
    "then these results should be compared to the experimental data .    in the experiment at mainz microtron @xcite the intensity of the channeling radiation",
    "was measured for crystal samples of different dimensions @xmath129 along the beam axis . to make a comparison with these data , we modelled the mainz experiment with our code .",
    "we calculated the average number of photons in the energy interval @xmath175 mev @xmath176 mev emitted by a 855 mev electron moving trough a silicon crystal with plane ( 110 ) parallel to the beam direction .",
    "then we subtracted the background , i.e. the same quantity but calculated in the case of a randomly oriented silicon crystal .",
    "the photons were taken into account if the angle @xmath177 between their wave vector and the beam direction , does not exceed @xmath178 mrad , which corresponds to the aperture of the gamma spectrometer in the experimental setup of the mainz experiment .",
    "the calculation were done for different values of @xmath129 .",
    "the intensity of the channeling radiation is presented in @xcite in arbitrary units .",
    "we equated @xmath179 arbitrary unit to @xmath166 photon per projectile to adjust the overall scale .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ chan_rad ] .",
    "as is seen , our results demonstrate reasonable agreement with the experiment , which proves the reliability of the code .",
    "mev @xmath176 mev .",
    "the right vertical axis is calibrated in arbitrary units used in the experimental paper.,width=453 ]",
    "we presented first result obtained with a new monte - carlo code for modelling of channeling of ultrarelativistic charged particles in a crystal .",
    "the calculation were done for 855 mev electrons channeling in a single crystal of silicon along ( 100 ) , ( 110 ) and ( 111 ) crystallographic planes .    according to our simulation ,",
    "if rechanneling is disregarded , the number of channeling electrons decreases fast with the penetration depth @xmath21 and quickly approaches an exponential asymptote .",
    "similar behaviour was previously seen in the kinetic theory of channeling in the case of positively charged projectile .",
    "we formulated a definition of the dechanneling length @xmath4 that is suitable for application within the monte carlo approach .",
    "our definition is consistent with the one previously used in the kinetic theory of channeling .",
    "applying this definition to the initial beam and to rechanneled particles gives essentially the same result .",
    "this demonstrates that @xmath4 is a universal quantity and does not depend on the initial transverse momentum distribution of projectiles .",
    "we calculated the dechanneling length for the studied planar channels .",
    "it appeared to be in the @xmath180 @xmath131 m range .",
    "our simulations show that the rechanneling of electrons is a notable phenomenon .",
    "it dominates the number of channeling particles already at the penetration depth of a few tens of microns . due to rechanneling ,",
    "the total number of channeling particles , included the rechanneled fraction , decreases slowly following the @xmath181 asymptote .    to verify our code , we calculated the intensity of the channeling radiation and compared it with the experimental data obtained at mainz microtron @xcite . a good agreement has been observed .",
    "this confirms that our code is a reliable tool for modeling the electron channeling if the projectile energy is around @xmath166 gev .",
    "there is no obstacle for successful application of the code also to positrons of the same energy range or to electrons and positrons of higher energy up to several tens of gev .",
    "extending the applicability domain of the code to much lower or to much higher projectile energies requires further improvements of the underlying physical model and the computation algorithm .    at low projectile energies ( around @xmath182 mev or lower ) the splitting of the transverse energy levels of a channeling electron or positron can be as large as a few electron - volts , which is comparable with the depth of the potential well .",
    "because only discrete transverse energy levels allowed , scattering from the crystal constituents will lead to an increase of the transverse energy only when the energy transfer in the collision is equal to the splitting .",
    "hence , only collisions with large scattering angles can contribute to the increase of transverse energy .",
    "due to smaller probability of such collisions , the dechanneling length may become noticeably larger than it is predicted by classical calculations . for these reasons ,",
    "a study of low energy electron and positron channeling would require taking into account quantum properties of the projectile .    at high electron or positron energies ( hundreds of gev or higher ) ,",
    "the radiation energy losses become essential and can not be ignored . therefore",
    ", our model has to be further developed to take these into account .    in the case of heavy projectiles ,",
    "the radiation energy losses are much less important .",
    "therefore , in principle , our model can be applied to heavy projectiles of tev energy range or even higher .",
    "however , calculations of heavy projectile channeling may involve very long crystals because of a large dechanneling length .",
    "this could require a prohibitive amount of computer time .",
    "therefore , further refinement and optimisation of the algorithm may be necessary in this case .",
