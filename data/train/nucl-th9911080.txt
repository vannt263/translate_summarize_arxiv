    "the experimental and theoretical investigation of the baryon spectrum helps to improve our knowledge of qcd in the nonperturbative regime  especially of the confining mechanism , which is most important for binding a system of quarks into a hadron .",
    "experimental information about the mass , width and decay of baryon resonances serves as a testing ground for several models of the internal structure of the nucleon and its excited states .",
    "most of this information is extracted from partial wave analyses of @xmath8 scattering data @xcite , sometimes in combination with transition amplitudes to inelastic channels such as @xmath9@xcite or @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "in addition there is information available form photo- and electro - production of @xmath11 resonances @xcite or , as recently proposed , from the @xmath12 decay channel of the @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the mass spectrum of excited baryon states has been calculated within several quark models ( qm ) .",
    "the nonrelativistic qm of isgur and karl @xcite , for example , leads to a good qualitative understanding of the negative parity resonances by assuming a structure of three constituent quarks that are confined by a harmonic oscillator potential and interact through a residual interaction inspired by one gluon exchange . in order to describe the positive parity states",
    ", however they had to introduce an additional anharmonicity into the confining oscillator potential that lowers the mass of the first positive parity resonance ( @xmath0 ) @xcite .",
    "the relativized qm @xcite gives a good qualitative picture of the baryonic spectrum by using an interaction which , in the nonrelativistic limit , can be decomposed into a color coulomb part , a confining interaction , a hyperfine interaction and a spin - orbit interaction between quarks . the confinement is provided by a y - type string interaction between all three quarks .",
    "one ( of several ) difficulties with this model is that the low lying positive parity resonances are systematically overestimated by at least 100 mev .",
    "a rather different interaction mechanism was used by glozman and riska @xcite . in their model ,",
    "two quarks interact via pion exchange .",
    "this flavor - dependent force is responsible for the low mass of the roper resonance ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "confinement is achieved by an oscillator potential .",
    "thus the interaction mechanisms of the glozman / riska model and the isgur / karl / capstick model are quite different and it is not clear whether the mass spectrum should be described by either one of these interactions or a mixture of both @xcite .    the photo- and electro - excitation of baryon resonances have been studied by several groups using several different models .",
    "li and collaborators @xcite found the @xmath14 dependence of the @xmath15 helicity amplitudes to be very sensitive to the structure of the roper resonance .",
    "while the nonrelativistic @xmath16 model is not able to describe the @xmath14 behavior , a hybrid @xmath17 model is in agreement with the available experimental data .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached by capstick @xcite , who found large disagreement in the photo - production amplitude of the roper between a theoretical calculation in a nonrelativistic @xmath16 model  including relativistic corrections  and the experimental data .",
    "however capstick and keister @xcite pointed out that relativistic effects are very important in these amplitudes .",
    "they were able to describe the helicity amplitudes using a `` relativized '' @xmath16 qm .",
    "cardarelli et al .",
    "also investigated the electro - production of the roper resonance and concluded that this resonance can hardly be interpreted as a simple radial excitation of the nucleon @xcite .",
    "recently the tbingen group @xcite found large contributions from meson - baryon intermediate states in the transition amplitudes @xmath18 .",
    "thus even the study of its electromagnetic excitation does not clearly reveal the structure of the roper resonance .",
    "the decay widths of baryons have been calculated using several approaches by combining a qm with a model for the decay of the three quark system into a meson baryon state , such as the @xmath19 model@xcite , or the string breaking mechanism of the flux tube model @xcite .",
    "the @xmath8 decay width of the roper resonance as calculated by capstick and roberts @xcite is in agreement with the analysis of cutkosky and wang @xcite but , compared to the partial wave analysis of the karlsruhe @xcite and the vpi @xcite groups , the decay width of the roper should be much smaller .",
    "in addition , none of the decay models include any kind of meson - baryon final state interaction or coupled - channel effects @xcite , although there are indications that these could lead to large shifts of the energy levels and mixing effects between states @xcite . a consistent investigation of higher fock states , such as @xmath20 , is missing @xcite , although there are investigations of @xmath21 systems , where @xmath22 @xcite or @xmath23 @xcite .    at this stage",
    "a closer look at the different partial wave analyses may help us to understand the problem in more detail . in table",
    "[ tabp11 ] we have listed the mass , width and pole position of the roper resonance as extracted from several partial wave analyses of @xmath8 scattering data .",
    "the first five lines correspond to models that either get the mass , @xmath24 , and width , @xmath25 , of the roper resonance by fitting a breit - wigner - like resonance to the @xmath8 data or derive the position of the resonance pole in the complex energy plane .",
    "this pole position can be related to the mass and width of the resonance by @xmath26 which , in fact , is the origin of the denominator in a breit - wigner parameterization of a resonance . by comparing the mass and width parameters of the analyses",

    "something similar can be seen by comparing the widths : here a ratio @xmath28 is found instead of the expected value of 2 . for an undistorted resonance , such as the @xmath29 , the mass and width from the breit - wigner parameterization and the pole position",
    "are essentially the same within a few mev @xcite .",
    "this observation shows already that the roper resonance is substantially influenced by strong meson - baryon background interactions and/or effects from nearby thresholds .",
    "hhler suggested the use of the pole position as source of information on the mass and width of a resonance , since the pole has a well - defined meaning in @xmath30-matrix theory @xcite .",
    "if we do so , the qms use the wrong values for the mass and width of the roper resonance . compared to the pole position values of @xmath24 and @xmath25",

    "( [ poleq ] ) ) , the relativized qm @xcite overestimates the mass of the roper by about 200 mev and the @xmath8 decay width of the roper resonance is overpredicted too .",
    "another remarkable difference between the @xmath31 and the @xmath0 is seen in examination of the partial wave amplitudes ( displayed as phase shift @xmath32 and inelasticity @xmath33 ) in fig .",
    "[ phasep11 ] .",
    "the @xmath31 causes a nice change in the phase shift of the partial wave @xmath34 up to @xmath35 and crosses @xmath36 at @xmath27 1520 mev .",
    "this is also the position of the maximum in the inelasticity . after passing the resonant phase of @xmath36",
    ", the amplitude goes back to being almost elastic .",
    "the situation is completely different for the @xmath0 . here",
    "the phase shift in the @xmath37 increases slowly , which corresponds to a very broad resonance , but the inelasticity opens very rapidly ( almost as fast as in the @xmath34 ) and remains inelastic over a very large energy range .",
    "furthermore , the suggested resonance position of @xmath38 mev does not correspond to @xmath39 .",
    "the shape of the @xmath37 partial wave amplitude in the region of the roper resonance also looks very different from a typical breit - wigner resonance .",
    "to summarize , the roper appears not to fit into our picture of breit - wigner - like resonances .",
    "a series of different methods can be found in the literature that try to extract information on the roper resonance from @xmath8 scattering .",
    "the ones displayed in table [ tabp11 ] can be summarized as follows :    * analyses a ) and b ) are combined analyses of all available @xmath8 scattering data .",
    "two methods are used in order to extract parameters of resonances .",
    "first , a coupled - channel @xmath40-matrix approach , additionally constrained by fixed @xmath41 dispersion relations , allows a continuation of the partial wave amplitudes into the complex energy plane , where the poles of the resonances can be found .",
    "second , fits to single - energy partial wave solutions using generalized breit - wigner parameterizations are performed , which lead to the values of @xmath24 and @xmath25 . *",
    "manley and saleski ( c ) use a combination of breit - wigner resonances and a phenomenological parameterization of the background , which is unitarized in a @xmath40-matrix approximation .",
    "they included experimental data of the reaction @xmath42 into their fitting procedure .",
    "* the group of cutkosky ( d ) used a separable coupled - channels resonance model .",
    "the dressed propagator of the intermediate resonances is a solution of the dyson equation and the vertices are generalized breit - wigner vertex functions .",
    "backgrounds are parameterized as resonance contributions with a resonance position below threshold . *",
    "analysis ( e ) is an extended version of the model used in ( d ) .",
    "input data are the partial wave solutions of the vpi group @xcite and the transition cross sections @xmath9 and @xmath42 .",
    "* in f ) , g ) , and h ) hhler and schulte use the speed plot method for determining resonance parameters .",
    "we describe this method in more detail in sec .",
    "[ secroper ] .",
    "the speed plot analysis uses other partial wave solutions as input and therefore is not a partial wave analysis of @xmath8 scattering , but an alternative way of extracting resonance parameters .",
    "* line ( i ) represents our results , which will be discussed in detail in sec .",
    "[ secroper ] .",
    "all of these analyses agree in the need for a pole in the partial wave @xmath37 and all of them but our work assume a small background interaction .",
    "however the aim of analysis a ) ",
    "h ) is _ not _ to determine the structure of a resonance .",
    "this was pointed out in a recent extension of the cmb model by vrana , dytman , and lee @xcite .",
    "rather , these analyses seek to discover whether there is a resonance or not .",
    "they do so by providing the poles demanded by data as input .",
    "the number of poles as well as their parameters are then obtained by means of a @xmath43 fit .",
    "in addition to these analyses there are many theoretical models for @xmath8 scattering up to the energies of the first @xmath11 resonances .",
    "they can be divided into two classes :    separable potential models : :    such as @xcite . in these models",
    "the potential @xmath44    of a coupled - channel lippmann - schwinger equation ( lse ) is assumed to    be of the separable form @xmath45 ,    where k ( k ) is the relative momentum of the initial ( final ) state .",
    "the form factor @xmath46 is parameterized differently for each    partial wave , and the strength factor @xmath47 , together    with the parameters of the form factor , is adjusted to fit data .",
    "since    the parameters of the form factors do not have a clear physical    meaning , the interpretation of these parameters in terms of resonances    and backgrounds is not possible .",
    "nevertheless , one can still learn    about effects of opening thresholds of coupled - channels .",
    "@xmath40-matrix approximations , : :    such as the models introduced in refs .",
    "these use a    microscopic potential , @xmath44 , as input to a lse , which is    solved in the @xmath40-matrix approximation . in general , a lse    ( written in a symbolic notation ) @xmath48 can be decomposed into a set of    equations @xmath49 where we have    introduced the @xmath40-matrix @xcite and    @xmath50 denotes the principal value .",
    "the    @xmath40-matrix approximation now simplifies this set of    equations by setting @xmath51 .",
    "this reduces the integral    equation ( [ lse ] ) to an algebraic equations ( [ tgl ] ) .",
    "the    @xmath40-matrix approximation does not allow for virtual    intermediate states .",
    "one consequence of this is , that the different    channels only contribute above their production threshold .",
    "of course    this truncates the strength of the virtual states and ,    consequentially , the strength of the multiple scattering    contributions .",
    "this can also be found in a slightly more formal way :    the heitler equation , eq .",
    "( [ tgl ] ) , introduces the unitary cut to the    @xmath40-matrix so that the @xmath52-matrix contains    this unitary cut and the poles present in @xmath40 .",
    "the    rescattering of virtual states is described completely by the    @xmath40-matrix eq .",
    "( [ kgl ] ) .",
    "since this is a fredholm type of    integral equation , it can be solved by iteration    @xmath53 this series may be divergent , which introduces ( besides the poles in @xmath44 )    additional poles due to rescattering .",
    "these poles are not present if    the @xmath40-matrix equation is approximated by cutting off the    series ( [ reihe ] ) at a finite order .",
    "even if no pole is generated by    the infinite sum , there may still be much strength in higher order    iterations , which are eliminated in approximating @xmath51 .    with this in mind",
    ", it is clear , that the @xmath40-matrix    approximations discussed above do not find dynamical poles such as    bound states .",
    "it has long been known that the poles of the two - body @xmath30-matrix ( as a function of a complex energy variable ) are not only resonance poles , but can also be bound state poles or coupled - channel poles @xcite .",
    "a bound state is generated by a strongly attractive interaction between two particles , whereas a coupled - channel pole can be realized by a coupling between two reaction channels .",
    "prominent examples of bound states of two hadrons are the @xmath54 , which is found to be a @xmath55 molecule in the @xmath56 system @xcite and the @xmath57 as @xmath58 bound state in the @xmath59 system @xcite .",
    "an example of a coupled - channel pole can be found in the @xmath60 system , where the @xmath61 can be generated by the coupling between these two channels @xcite .",
    "it is , however , not always easy to distinguish between these two types of poles .",
    "the situation we have presented so far can be summarized as follows : the qm calculations do not give us a clear picture of the structure of the roper resonance , even by studying electromagnetic processes or decay widths .",
    "yet we know that in many analyses of @xmath8 scattering the need of a resonance has been found .",
    "the aim of these analyses was not to determine the structure of the resonance , but to determine resonance parameters , such as masses , widths and branching ratios .",
    "the coupled - channel models of @xmath8 scattering for energies under consideration work in the @xmath40-matrix approximation , in which part of the strength due to virtual intermediate states is truncated . furthermore the @xmath1 states in these models are not treated consistently ; rather , the mass of some effective @xmath1 channel is adjusted differently in each partial wave @xcite , or an unphysical scalar - isovector @xmath62 state is used @xcite .    a model for @xmath8 partial wave amplitudes as solution of a full lse up to energies of 1.9 gev is missing .",
    "our aim is therefore to construct such a model in order to investigate whether or not it is possible to describe the roper resonance as a dynamically generated resonance .",
    "we use the model of ref .",
    "@xcite as a starting point .",
    "this model is able to describe the @xmath8 partial waves up to energies of 1.6 gev by coupling the channels @xmath63 , and @xmath64 and has proven its ability to analyze the structure of a resonance in the partial wave @xmath65 and @xmath37 .",
    "we have improved this model in several significant ways :    * we have included the @xmath4 reaction channel into the coupled - channel calculation in order to complete the effective description of @xmath1 states .",
    "this channel improves the description in the partial waves @xmath66 and @xmath67 and leads to large contributions in the partial wave @xmath65 in the region of the @xmath68 . * in ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath41 channel @xmath69 exchange diagrams were omitted in order to avoid double counting . by dropping these terms also the coupling strength between the @xmath8 and the @xmath2 channel is weakened .",

    "this results in a large coupling between the @xmath8 and @xmath71 channels , which was not present in @xcite . *",
    "the rules of time ordered perturbation theory were applied with care , which leads to additional contact interactions ( see the appendix for more details ) . in @xcite",
    "these contact terms are found to be large corrections and we also find strong contributions of these additional interactions e.g. in the @xmath72 exchange diagrams .    in the next section our model",
    "is described in greater detail . in sec .",
    "[ secdata ] we shall discuss the results of this model as compared to the amplitudes of partial wave analyses and some transition cross sections . sec .",
    "[ secroper ] will be dedicated to an investigation of the structure of the roper resonance .",
    "the last section summarizes our results .",
    "in the introduction we argued that a detailed investigation of the roper resonance goes along with an understanding of @xmath8 scattering over a rather large energy region  from threshold ( @xmath73 mev ) up to energies well above the resonance under investigation ( e.g. , 1.9 gev ) .",
    "furthermore we have to use a realistic interaction between the meson and the baryon .",
    "such an interaction is provided by the meson exchange model , which has successfully been used in many different reactions such as the @xmath74 interaction @xcite , the elastic @xmath8 interaction , @xcite , the @xmath75 interaction @xcite , the @xmath76 interaction @xcite and the @xmath62 interaction @xcite , to name just a few .",
    "before we go into the details of the interaction , we wish to specify the reaction channels we will need in our description .    from fig .",
    "[ phasep11 ] it is clear that the @xmath8 interaction above energies of 1.3 gev is very inelastic .",
    "the decay modes of the nucleon resonances in the energy range under consideration show that the dominant decay ( besides @xmath8 and @xmath64 for the @xmath77 ) is the @xmath1 channel @xcite . since a three - body calculation is much too complicated for realistic potentials , we must reduce the @xmath1 channel into effective two - body channels . in doing this",
    "we are guided by studying strong interactions between two - body clusters of the three - body @xmath78 state .",
    "the dominant clusters are the @xmath5 in the @xmath8 interaction , the @xmath79 in the vector isovector @xmath62 interaction and the strong correlation in the scalar - isoscalar @xmath62 interaction , which we call @xmath7 .",
    "therefore  besides the @xmath8 and @xmath64 channels , which are needed for a complete description of the @xmath80  our model includes the reaction channels @xmath81 , @xmath2 and @xmath4 .",

    "we work in the center - of - momentum ( cm ) frame and @xmath89 are the momenta of the initial ( final ) baryon , respectively .",
    "the pseudopotential @xmath44 ( i.e. , the interaction between baryon and meson ) that is iterated in eq . ( [ ccstreugl ] ) can be constructed from an effective lagrangian .",
    "our interaction lagrangian ( see table [ tablag ] ) is based on that of wess and zumino @xcite , which we have supplemented with additional terms for including the @xmath5 isobar , the @xmath6 , @xmath33 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 meson and the @xmath7 .",

    "the model is then a good starting point for an investigation of the roper resonance .",
    "let us begin this section with a description of our procedure for investigating the structure of a resonance .",
    "we start by using nonresonant interactions only ; i.e. , we do not include a pole diagram into our interaction .",
    "if we are able to fit data in all partial waves without pole diagram , the resonance under consideration does _ not _ have a three - valence - quark structure .",
    "rather , it is created dynamically by the nonresonant meson - baryon interaction .",
    "if we need to include a pole diagram , we conclude that the resonance is dominated by quark gluon dynamics , which are not included in our model .    as can be seen in figs .",
    "[ phasep11 ] and [ pwa1 ] , our model results in a very good description of the @xmath37 , _ without _ including a roper pole diagram .",
    "the rise of the phase shift and the opening of the inelasticity is generated by the coupling to the inelastic channels . in fig .",
    "[ contp11 ] we show how the different reaction channels contribute to the @xmath37 .",
    "the potential of the elastic model ( i.e. , where @xmath8 is the only reaction channel ) is attractive due to the @xmath79 exchange , and leads to a rising phase shift without generating a resonant behavior . including the @xmath151 channel hardly improves the situation for the phase shift but leads to some inelasticity , which starts at about 1.4 gev .",
    "as soon as we couple to the @xmath2 channel , a resonant shape of the phase shift is generated .",
    "the inelasticity opens at 1.3 gev and reproduces the rapid rise of the experimental data .",
    "since the reaction channels @xmath4 and @xmath64 scarcely contribute to the @xmath37 , decoupling the @xmath3 channel from the full model leaves us basically with a @xmath152 model , which does not differ much from the full result . only at higher energies",
    "does the @xmath153 channel contribute to the inelasticity .",
    "as we have not included a roper pole diagram into our model , we can not determine any breit - wigner parameters from the parameters in our model .",
    "hhler and schulte @xcite , however , were able to determine resonance parameters from several partial wave solutions by calculating the speed , which is defined by @xmath154 and gives some information about the time delay in the reaction @xcite .",
    "a resonance causes a large time delay and will , therefore , form a peak in a diagram in which the speed is plotted against the energy @xmath155 ( the so - called speed plot ) .",
    "the height and width of this peak can be related to the mass , width and residue of the resonance @xcite .",

    ", our values agree with the other speed plot analyses .",
    "the agreement with the pole position of the two resent vpi solutions @xcite is also very good .    by switching off several contributions in the potential ,",
    "we have found the @xmath69 exchange in the transition @xmath157 ( fig .",
    "[ ropgraf ] j ) to be very important for the energy dependence of the @xmath37 phase shift .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ p11nopit ] , where we show the model without @xmath69 exchange in comparison to the full solution .",
    "this contribution is responsible for a large amount of attraction , especially at higher energies .",
    "in contrast , the inelasticity stays large at higher energies even without @xmath69 exchange , but reaches its maximum at 1.6 gev ( the maximum of the full model is located at 1.45 gev ) . in an earlier version of this model @xcite this contribution was missing .",
    "the attraction that is needed for a good description of the @xmath37 was generated by a strong coupling to the @xmath2 channel via the nucleon exchange and a stronger coupling to the @xmath151 reaction channel .",
    "however the energy dependence of the @xmath151 channel leads to a maximum in the @xmath37 phase shift near 1.6 gev and the phase shift decreases again at higher energies .",
    "therefore the model @xcite was restricted to energies below 1.6 gev .",
    "so far we have demonstrated that our model generates a dynamical pole in the @xmath37 , which is associated with the roper resonance .",
    "the phase shift and inelasticity can be described as well as in other models that include a bare resonance explicitly , and the resonance parameters from a speed plot analysis are in good agreement with the speed plot analyses of other partial wave solutions .",
    "we also found , that the @xmath2 and the @xmath3 channel are important in the @xmath37 . in order to investigate the role of these channels in more detail ,",
    "we construct a simplified model that contains the basic features of the full model used so far .",
    "we restrict the simplified version to the reaction channels @xmath158 and @xmath81 .",
    "a major simplification is achieved by replacing the microscopic potential @xmath159 by a separable potential of the form @xmath160 where @xmath161 is a free parameter which ( if positive ) allows for a pole in the energy dependence @xcite .",
    "the vertex functions @xmath162 are given by @xmath163 where @xmath164 .",
    "the coupling constants @xmath165 and @xmath166 are also free parameters in the fit to the @xmath37 partial wave amplitude .",
    "all vertex functions are supplemented by a common form factor of the type ( [ ffpol ] ) with a cutoff @xmath167 gev .",
    "the @xmath8 @xmath52-matrix can be calculated in the following way @xcite :    first we calculate the self - energy @xmath168 where the modified propagator ( [ modprop ] ) is used for the @xmath3 and @xmath2 channel . with this self - energy , the @xmath8 @xmath52-matrix",
    "can be calculated : @xmath169 we have fitted the @xmath37 phase shift and inelasticity with the three different sets of parameters shown in table [ sepparams ] .",
    "set i only couples the reaction channels @xmath8 and @xmath2 whereas set ii and iii only couple @xmath8 and @xmath3 .",
    "the results for the different parameter sets are shown in fig .",
    "[ figsep ] .",
    "the @xmath170 model describes the @xmath37 almost as well as the full model . in particular",
    ", the inelasticity opens at the right energy and the model results in a continuous rise of the phase shift .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath171 model ( sets ii and iii ) is not able to describe the inelasticity .",
    "the inelastic contributions from the @xmath3 channel start to open at higher energies as compared to set i and do not lead to @xmath172 . by increasing the coupling to the @xmath151 channel ( in going from set ii to set iii ) the maximum in the inelasticity",
    "can be increased , but it still opens at @xmath173 gev./@xmath3 model of blankleider and walker @xcite , whereas in the separable model of fuda @xcite the mass of the @xmath5 is adjusted in each partial wave separately in order to describe the inelasticies correctly .",
    "] so even by increasing the coupling to the @xmath3 channel , the onset of inelasticity is not shifted down in energy .",
    "furthermore the larger coupling ( set iii ) leads to an overestimation of the phase shift in the energy region of 1.4  1.6 gev .",
    "a good description of the @xmath37 partial wave amplitude with this coupled - channel @xmath171 model is not possible .",
    "we have also performed a least - squares fit , letting all three coupling constants and the mass @xmath161 vary freely .",
    "the minimizing procedure always resulted in a negligible coupling to the @xmath3 channel .",
    "the resulting parameters only differ slightly from the parameter set i and the curve is almost the same as the solid one in fig .",
    "[ figsep ] .",
    "the common feature of the full model discussed at the beginning of this section and the simplified version introduced here is the use of the modified propagator ( [ modprop ] ) for the @xmath3 and @xmath2 states , as introduced in sec .",
    "[ secmodel ] .",
    "this allows us to conclude that a proper treatment of the decay widths of the intermediate states in the form presented here is very important for the description of the roper partial wave .",
    "the self - energy term in the modified propagator ( [ modprop ] ) smears out the threshold of the @xmath2 state over a rather broad energy region .",
    "furthermore it introduces an additional imaginary part into the amplitude , which originates from the ( energy dependent ) decay width of the @xmath7 .",
    "this results in an onset of inelasticity at the correct position .",
    "the strong coupling between the @xmath8 and the @xmath2 channel , as mediated by the @xmath41 channel @xmath69 exchange , generates large contributions from the rescattering of virtual @xmath2 states and produces the attraction seen in the @xmath37 .",
    "we have presented a coupled - channel model for @xmath8 scattering in the energy region from threshold up to 1.9 gev .",
    "the model is based on an effective lagrangian and leads to a good description of @xmath8 partial wave amplitudes .",
    "we have used this model for an investigation of the roper resonance .",
    "we found , that our full solution of the relativistic lippmann - schwinger equation generates the roper resonance dynamically , i.e. without needing a @xmath16 core .",
    "we have calculated resonance parameters by using the speed plot method , and these are consistent with other analyses .",
    "as source of the dynamical pole we have identified the @xmath2 channel , which we have used together with the @xmath3 and @xmath4 channel as effective description of @xmath1 states .",
    "furthermore we have shown that the most important features of the our model are the @xmath41 channel @xmath69 exchange in the @xmath157 transition potential and a proper treatment of the decay width of unstable particles in the quasi - two - body @xmath1 states .",
