    "the existence and importance of binary asteroids in small - body populations has only been realized in the last decade , after the first unambiguous detection of a satellite around main - belt asteroid 243 ida by the galileo spacecraft @xcite .",
    "it is now evident that binaries exist in the main - belt asteroids , the near - earth asteroids and in the kuiper belt ( see review by @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "apart from spacecraft flybys ( and the rare case of measuring gravitational perturbations of planets by very large asteroids ) , studying the orbital dynamics of binary systems provides the only method available for calculating mass and density .",
    "density measurements are important as probes of internal structure , enabling constraints to be placed on the porosity and composition .",
    "the jovian trojan asteroids are trapped in a 1:1 mean motion resonance with jupiter .",
    "they form two large clouds around the stable ( l4 , l5 ) lagrangian points 60  ahead of and behind the giant planet .",
    "it has been estimated that @xmath0 10@xmath3 trojan asteroids with diameters larger than 1-km exist @xcite , comparable in number to the main belt population ( @xmath4 asteroids , @xcite ) , making it clear that they comprise an important reservoir of information .",
    "the trojan asteroids of jupiter have yet to be searched systematically for the presence of binaries .",
    "despite this fact , two trojan binaries have already been identified : 617 patroclus , a resolved wide binary discovered by merline et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , while 624 hektor has a distinctive lightcurve that indicates it is a close or contact binary ( @xcite , @xcite ) and a widely separated satellite has recently been imaged @xcite .",
    "the trojans are intriguing because they show larger photometric ranges when compared with main - belt asteroids @xcite , particularly those with diameters larger than 90-km @xcite .",
    "large lightcurve amplitudes suggest elongated shapes or binarity .",
    "while it is not clear whether the trojans formed at their current location alongside jupiter or were trapped after forming at larger heliocentric distances @xcite , it is believed that these bodies are primordial .",
    "understanding their composition and internal structure is therefore of great interest , making density determination vital .",
    "the density of trojan 617 patroclus has been estimated as @xmath5 kg m@xmath2 based on the measured orbital period and size , and on diameter determinations made from infrared data @xcite .",
    "this low density contrasts with a comparatively high estimate for 624 hektor , namely @xmath6 = 2480@xmath7 kg m@xmath2 , determined from the lightcurve and a roche binary model @xcite .",
    "close or contact binaries are composed of two asteroids in a tight orbit around each other .",
    "the trojan contact binary fraction is potentially important in distinguishing between various formation theories .",
    "for example , one model of binary formation by dynamical friction predicts that close binaries should be common @xcite while another based on 3-body interactions asserts that they should be rare @xcite .",
    "the nature of the trojan binaries can also reveal clues about their formation .",
    "it is known that different mechanisms formed binaries in the main belt and the kuiper belt because of the distinct types of binaries found in both populations .",
    "it is suspected that gravitational processes predominantly form kuiper belt binaries , the known examples of which have components of comparable mass and large separations @xcite .",
    "sub - catastrophic impacts followed by gravitational interaction with the debris formed are the leading way to form tight binary systems with unequal mass components that make up the larger main - belt binary population @xcite . a comparative study of the binaries in the trojan clouds , the main belt and the kuiper belt might illuminate the different roles played by formation conditions in these populations .    motivated by the lack of studies about trojan binaries , the aim of this paper is to investigate the fraction of close or contact binary systems among the jovian trojan population .",
    "contact binaries are specifically targeted for the ease with which they can be identified using optical lightcurve information . here , we present a technique called sparse sampling , which we used to conduct a lightcurve survey of 114 jovian trojan asteroids . the results of this survey , the discovery of two suspected contact binary asteroids and a discussion of the binary fraction in the jovian trojan population will follow .",
    "the maximum photometric range that can be exhibited by a rotationally elongated , strengthless body is 0.9 mag @xcite . ranges larger than 0.9 mag .",
    "are strongly suggestive of a contact binary nature , in which mutual gravitational deformation of the components can drive the range up to @xmath0 1.2 magnitudes @xcite . in principle , structurally strong bodies can maintain any shape and show an arbitrarily large photometric range .",
    "however , most main - belt asteroids larger than @xmath0 150-m in diameter show little sign of possessing internal strength sufficient to resist gravity and/or rotational deformation @xcite and we expect that the trojan asteroids are similarly structurally weak . in what follows",
    ", we assume that objects with photometric range @xmath80.9 mag .",
    "are candidate contact binaries .",
    "to examine the efficiency of sparse lightcurve sampling , we conducted a series of monte carlo tests .",
    "the tests were applied to asteroids with a photometric range of 1.2 magnitudes and double - peaked lightcurve periods uniformly distributed between 6 and 20 hours .",
    "the lightcurves were uniformly sampled by n=1,2 ... 10 observations over one night .",
    "asteroids for which the sparse - sampling technique detected photometric ranges between 0.9 and 1.2 magnitudes were picked out as successful candidates .",
    "monte carlo simulations suggest that between 85% and 92% of asteroids with photometric ranges of 1.2 magnitudes would be identified as contact binary candidates from just five measurements of brightness per night ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "( the efficiency of detecting brightness variations larger than 0.9 magnitudes ranged from @xmath0 71% for asteroids with actual peak - to - peak lightcurve amplitudes of 1.0 magnitudes to @xmath0 81% of asteroids with peak - to - peak amplitudes of 1.1 magnitudes . )",
    "the simulations indicate that the accuracy with which contact binary candidates are identified varies little when sampling between five and eight lightcurve points per asteroid ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "the advantage of sparse sampling is clear : estimates of photometric range for a large number of asteroids can be made rapidly , significantly reducing observing time .",
    "asteroids exhibiting large photometric ranges in the sparse sampling study are subsequently targeted for detailed follow - up observations with dense coverage in rotational phase space .    to further test the sparse sampling technique",
    ", we observed 2674 pandarus and 944 hidalgo , two asteroids known to show large photometric variations . from published lightcurves , 2674 pandarus is known to have a photometric range of 0.49 magnitudes @xcite . using the sparse sampling technique , with the same sampling as for all other asteroids in the study ( and without prior knowledge of the rotational phase ) , we measured a lightcurve amplitude of 0.50 @xmath9 0.01 magnitudes for pandarus .",
    "hidalgo has shown a maximum photometric variation of 0.60 magnitudes @xcite , whereas sparse sampling measured the brightness range to be 0.58 @xmath9 0.02 magnitudes ( see figures 2 and 3 ) .",
    "the agreement results show that the photometric range can be usefully estimated with only five measurements of asteroid brightness .",
    "having gained confidence in the technique through simulations and observational tests , we applied sparse sampling to the trojan asteroids . taking five short exposures , while cycling through the asteroids , we were able to obtain limited sampling of 114 asteroid lightcurves in nine good weather nights of observing .",
    "we obtained sparsely sampled optical lightcurve data for the jovian trojan asteroids using both the university of hawaii 2.2-m telescope on mauna kea and the lulin one - meter telescope ( lot ) in taiwan .",
    "we used a 2048 x 2048 pixel tektronix charge - coupled device ( ccd ) on the 2.2-m telescope .",
    "this detector has a 0.219 arcseconds per pixel image scale and a field of view of 7.5 square arcminutes .",
    "the ccd on lot ( versarray:1300b ) has 1340 x 1300 pixels with 0.516 arcseconds per pixel scale , and a field of view of 11.5 x 11.2 arcminutes .",
    "all images were taken in the r band with exposure times scaled to the brightnesses of the asteroids . on lot ,",
    "the exposure times ranged from 30 seconds for objects brighter than 15th magnitude , up to 120 seconds for 19th magnitude trojans . at the 2.2-m telescope ,",
    "the exposure times ranged from 10 seconds for objects brighter than 17th magnitude , to 150 seconds for 20th magnitude asteroids .",
    "see table 1 for a description of the observations .",

    ", we speculate about all possible explanations for the brightness variations in the lightcurve observations of these trojan asteroids , including albedo variations , elongated shapes or binarity @xcite .",
    "surface albedo contrasts provide a possible but unconvincing explanation for the large brightness variations of the trojans . amongst solar system objects ,",
    "only iapetus , a satellite of saturn , shows strong spatial albedo variations which account for its large lightcurve amplitude .",
    "however , iapetus synchronous rotation about saturn plays a large role in producing the dichotomous behaviour of the satellite @xcite and this circumstance is not relevant in the context of the trojan asteroids . amongst previously studied asteroids ,",
    "double - peaked lightcurves are almost always caused by rotational variations in the projected area , and reflect the elongated shapes of the bodies .",
    "while albedo contrasts can not be formally ruled out , we feel that they are an unlikely cause of the observed brightness variations .",
    "increasing evidence suggests asteroids have little or no internal strength , probably as a result of impacts that disrupt but do not disperse the object @xcite .",
    "the trojan asteroids have undergone a collisional history that is either similar to that of the main - belt asteroids @xcite or perhaps even more intense @xcite , making it highly probable that they , too , are gravity dominated  rubble piles \" , strengthless or nearly so in tension @xcite .",
    "studies have found that only the smallest main - belt asteroids , with diameters less than 0.15-km , have sufficient internal strength to overcome gravity @xcite .",
    "figure 5 from @xcite shows observations of decreasing maximum spin rate with increasing lightcurve amplitude ( a proxy for elongation ) of near - earth asteroids .",
    "this observation indicates a lack of fast rotating elongated bodies , which implies that asteroids larger than @xmath0 0.15-km are structurally weak and lack the tensile strength to withstand high rotation rates without becoming unstable and flying apart .",
    "also evident in figure 5 @xcite is the tendency of fast rotators to have spheroidal shapes , an indicator of gravity - dominated bodies which do not possess the internal strength to resist gravity . collectively , the observations point to asteroids being bodies of negligible strength , whose shapes are dominated by rotation and gravity .",
    "rotation rates must lie between 4 and 6 rotations per day in order for rotational elongation of a structurally weak body to be maintained .",
    "this is the range for which jacobi ellipsoids are possible figures of equilibrium @xcite .",
    "if the rotation rate was much higher than 6 rotations per day , the body would fall apart , while at a much lower rotation rate , the body would adopt a spherical figure of equilibrium . in 2005 , both asteroids ( 17365 ) and ( 29314 ) showed photometric variations larger than 0.9 magnitudes , above the threshold for rotational instability in a structurally weak body .",
    "additionally , both asteroids have double - peaked lightcurve periods that are too slow to cause sufficient rotational elongation .",
    "both observations indicate that rotationally - induced elongation is an insufficient explanation for the brightness variations of these trojan asteroids .",
    "we are therefore left with the strong possibility that trojan asteroids ( 29314 ) and ( 17365 ) are contact binaries .",
    "figure 16 is a plot of rotation periods and photometric ranges of several well studied kuiper belt objects and main - belt asteroids .",
    "it is divided into three main regions : region a spans the photometric ranges that can be explained by albedo variations , elongation or binarity of an asteroid .",
    "region b represents the characteristics explained by albedo variations or rotational elongation of an object , while variations in region c can only be explained by binary asteroids .",
    "both trojan asteroids lie well within region c , alongside contact binaries 216 kleopatra , 624 hektor and 2001 qg@xmath23 , contributing to their suspected binary nature .",
    "the lightcurve of a contact binary is expected to show u - shaped or spread out maxima and v - shaped or notched minima , as shown by the lightcurves of 2001 qg@xmath23 ( see @xcite ) and 624 hektor ( see figure 17 ) .",
    "these characteristic lightcurve profiles are unlike the distinctive  notched \" profile expected for wide , eclipsing binaries which remain flat for the majority of the orbit , and contain sharp dips during the relatively short eclipsing events .",
    "the photometric observations of trojan asteroids ( 29314 ) and ( 17365 ) are consistent with lightcurve profiles expected of very close or contact binary systems .",
    "624 hektor was recently discovered to possess a satellite of diameter 15-km using keck laser guide star adaptive optics @xcite , but an independent density estimate derived from the orbital motion of this satellite has not yet been published . additionally , the imaging observations of 624 hektor indicate that its primary component has a double - lobed nature .",
    "similarities are obvious between the lightcurves of 624 hektor , ( 17365 ) and ( 29314 ) ( see figures 11 , 13 and 17 ) and consistent with our interpretation that the latter two asteroids are contact binaries .",
    "we used equilibrium models of roche binaries to determine how well the photometric observations of ( 17365 ) and ( 29314 ) could be matched by theoretical lightcurves of contact binary systems .",
    "a roche binary consists of a pair of homogeneous bodies in hydrostatic equilibrium orbiting each other .",
    "a strength of this modeling is the ability to estimate densities for the asteroids without knowing the sizes of the binary components .",
    "the exact shapes and rotation rates of the roche binaries were calculated using the mathematical description presented in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "binary configurations were calculated for secondary to primary mass ratios from @xmath24 to @xmath25 in steps of 0.01 . for each value @xmath26 ,",
    "equations 1 to 3 of @xcite were solved simultaneously to find possible shapes and orbital frequencies for the primary .",
    "the same equations were then solved using mass ratio @xmath27 to calculate the shapes and orbital rates for the secondary .",
    "finally , valid binaries are uniquely selected by matching pairs ( q,1/q ) with the same orbital frequency .",
    "this procedure is described in detail in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the models were ray - traced using publicly available software pov - ray ( http://www.povray.org ) , but the surface scattering routine of pov - ray was rewritten to allow better control of the scattering function .",
    "the scattering law used here was first implemented by @xcite .",
    "it linearly combines single ( lommel - seeliger ) and multiple ( lambert ) scattering terms using a parameter @xmath28 @xcite , which varies from 0 to 1 .",
    "the resulting reflectance function is @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the cosines of the incidence and emission angles .",
    "when @xmath32 , only single scattering is present , while @xmath33 simulates pure multiple scattering of light off the surface of the binaries .",
    "all binary configurations were raytraced for @xmath28 between 0 and 1 in steps of 0.1 .",
    "two viewing geometries were modelled , at aspect angles of 75 and 90@xmath34deg ( equator - on ) .",
    "the aspect angle lies between the line of sight of the observations and the rotation axis of the body .",
    "simulated illumination angles were chosen to match the phase angles at the time the data were taken . in total , nearly 50000 models were computed for comparison with the data .",
    "observations of ( 17365 ) and ( 29314 ) were simultaneously fitted for the different viewing orientations in 2005 and 2006 to find the best shape interpretation for the asteroids .",
    "we assumed that the objects were viewed equatorially in 2005 , thus producing the larger photometric range in the discovery epoch data .",
    "this assumption was encouraged by the fact that an aspect angle of 75 degrees ( rather than 90 degrees ) produced a better fit with the 2006 observations ( see figures 10 and 12 ) .",
    "figures 8 , 9 , 11 and 13 show the best - fit models overlaying lightcurve data , with residuals plotted underneath .",
    "best fit models were found by minimizing chi - squared .",
    "small deviations ( @xmath0 0.1 magnitudes ) from the binary model are evident for both asteroids , but are negligible compared with the total range of the observations , the more important parameter .",
    "presumably , the deviations are caused by irregularities on the surface of the asteroids , which were not included in the simple binary model , but without which the asteroids would be considered odd .",
    "the ability of the models to simultaneously fit two epochs of photometric observations lends strong support to the idea that we observed contact binary asteroids over two years at different viewing geometries .",
    "figures 18 and 19 show the shapes derived from the binary models for ( 17365 ) and ( 29314 ) .",
    "orbital periods combined with shape information allowed us to estimate the densities of the asteroids .",
    "the components of our model of asteroid ( 29314 ) were found to have a mass ratio of @xmath35 and a density of @xmath36 kg / m@xmath37 , while our best model of asteroid ( 17365 ) has a mass ratio of @xmath38 and density of @xmath39 kg / m@xmath37 .",
    "these low densities suggest porous asteroid interiors .",
    "if ( 29314 ) and ( 17365 ) have a rock / ice composition similar to the moons of jupiter , ( 29314 ) would have a porosity of @xmath0 64% , while ( 17365 ) would have a smaller porosity of 50% ( see figure 3 from @xcite ) .",
    "if ( 17365 ) and ( 29314 ) were composed purely of water ice , their porosities would be 15% and 35% , respectively @xcite .",
    "this pure water ice composition is unrealistic , however .",
    "it is interesting to note that our low density measurements are consistent with 617 patroclus @xcite .    among the trojans ,",
    "only 624 hektor is known to have a comparable lightcurve amplitude , making ( 29314 ) and ( 17265 ) the 2nd and 3rd known trojans to show such large rotational variations .",
    "lightcurve analysis suffers from the notorious non - uniqueness problem , which arises from the ability to reproduce any lightcurve with a complicated pattern of surface markings and shapes .",
    "our interpretation is not unique , but is the simplest , most plausible explanation for the behaviour of the trojan asteroids .",
    "following the method outlined in @xcite to account for the geometrical circumstances of the observations , we were able to estimate the fraction of contact binary systems among the jovian trojan asteroids .",
    "this method uses two very crude approximations . in the first approximation ,",
    "the binary system is simplified to be an elongated , rectangular object with dimensions a @xmath40 b = c , having a lightcurve amplitude as follows :    @xmath41    the range of lightcurve amplitudes used to identify contact binary asteroids is 0.9 to 1.2 magnitudes . for the maximum amplitude of 1.2 magnitudes and viewing angle of @xmath42 = 0@xmath43 , an axis ratio of @xmath44",
    "= 3 is calculated from equation 4 .",
    "using this axis ratio and the minimum expected amplitude of 0.9 magnitudes , a viewing angle of 10@xmath43 was determined .",
    "therefore , the range of lightcurve amplitudes expected for a contact binary asteroid would only be observed if the earth lies within 10@xmath43 of the equator of the asteroid .",
    "the probability that the earth would lie within 10@xmath43 of the equator of a randomly oriented asteroid is p(@xmath45 ) = 0.17 .",
    "we found two suspected contact binary asteroids in our sample of 114 trojan asteroids , so the fraction of contact binary jovian trojan asteroids is approximately @xmath46 = 10 % .",
    "a second approximation uses an ellipsoid shape to represent the contact binary asteroid , again having dimensions a @xmath40 b = c , and having a lightcurve amplitude expressed by the following :    @xmath47\\sin^2 \\theta + 1 \\right\\}.\\ ] ]    using the axis ratio of @xmath44 = 3 , in order to observe photometric ranges between 0.9 and 1.2 magnitudes , the earth must lie within 17@xmath43 of the equator of the ellipsoidal asteroid .",
    "the probability of a randomly oriented object having this geometrical orientation relative to the observer is p(@xmath48 ) = 0.29 , implying a contact binary fraction of @xmath49 = 6 % .",
    "we conclude that the fraction of contact binary trojan asteroids is @xmath06% to @xmath010% .",
    "this is a lower limit to the actual fraction as some of the objects not found in the survey sample to have large amplitudes might in fact have them because the sparse sampling method is not 100% efficient .",
    "the existence of likely contact binary 624 hektor separately suggests that the binary fraction is high .",
    "binaries with equal - sized components are rare in the main - belt ( the frequency of large main - belt binaries is @xmath0 2% @xcite ) and have yet to be observed in the near - earth asteroid population .",
    "however , they are abundant in the observed binary kuiper belt population , where the fraction lies between 10% and 20% @xcite . the results of this study show that there are three jovian trojan asteroids that reside in region c. the observations tend to suggest a closer relationship between the binary populations of the kuiper belt and the trojan clouds",
    ". this correlation could signify similar binary formation mechanisms in the two populations .",
    "this is an interesting connection considering that in one model of formation , the trojans are actually captured kuiper belt objects @xcite .",
    "however , it is clear that the total binary fractions in the kuiper belt and in the trojans needs to be more tightly constrained before conclusions can be made .",
    "the contact binaries detected were skewed towards those with components of comparable sizes , which are capable of producing photometric ranges @xmath40 0.9 magnitudes . for mass ratios",
    "@xmath50 1 , sparse sampling would more likely miss the eclipsing event and the photometric range would be @xmath51 0.9 magnitudes and would not attract our attention .",
    "the method was strongly dependent on geometrical circumstances , and only binaries viewed edge - on or almost equatorially would be detected in our survey .",
    "additionally , sparse sampling is only able to put lower limits on the photometric range of an asteroid , making the binary fraction a lower limit estimate . only binaries with sufficiently short orbital periods ( optimally between 6 to 12 hour rotation periods ) would be detected , so wide binaries were not accounted for in this study .",
    "therefore , again the measured binary fraction is a strong lower limit to the actual fraction and is suggestive of a significant binary population among the trojan clouds .",
    "our project is a pilot study for the much larger scale pan - starrs , which will detect every object with a red magnitude brighter than @xmath52 magnitude .",
    "it is estimated that approximately 10@xmath53 jovian trojans exist with red magnitudes lower than 24 , all of which will be detected using pan - starrs @xcite .",
    "our results suggest that pan - starrs will reveal between 6000 and 10,000 contact binary systems among the trojan clouds .",
