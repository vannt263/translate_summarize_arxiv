    "quantum annealing ( qa ) is a metaheuristic for solving combinatorial optimization problems @xcite .",
    "the recent introduction of qa hardware by d - wave systems  @xcite has invigorated theoretical and experimental research into the computational power and practical implementation challenges of the qa paradigm .",
    "current research studies focus on both fundamental and applied aspects , including application to real - world problems  @xcite , criteria for detecting quantum speedup  @xcite , the computational role of quantum tunneling  @xcite , error - supression  @xcite , the relationship between classical simulated annealing and quantum annealing  @xcite , spin - glass perspectives on the hardness of computational problems  @xcite , and programming strategies that address intrinsic noise  @xcite .",
    "the quantum annealers used for this study are of the second generation of d - wave devices , also called d - wave two  @xcite : one located at nasa ames research center in moffett field , california , ( `` nasa device '' ) , and another located at d - wave systems in burnaby , canada ( `` burnaby device '' ) . these consist of 64 unit cells of a previously characterized eight - qubit unit cell  @xcite . in the nasa and burnaby devices ,",
    "post - fabrication characterization determined that only 509 and 424 qubits , respectively , out of the 512 qubit arrays can be reliably used for computation .",
    "the array of coupled superconducting flux qubits is , effectively , an artificial ising spin system with programmable spin - spin couplings and transverse magnetic fields .",
    "it is designed to solve instances of the following ( np - hard  @xcite ) classical optimization problem : given a set of local fields @xmath0 and couplings @xmath1 , find the assignment @xmath2 , that minimizes the objective function @xmath3 , @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 . finding the optimal @xmath8 is equivalent to finding the ground state of the corresponding quantum ising hamiltonian @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is pauli @xmath11 operator acting on the @xmath12th spin .",
    "more details of qa can be found in appendix  [ app : qa ] .    currently , d - wave devices are only calibrated at the level of ensuring that the low - level control circuitry has its intended effect on the physical quantities like current , flux , etc .",
    ", that it is meant to control  @xcite .",
    "early research into the performance of d - wave devices has indicated the presence of significant imprecision in the setting of the fields that define the problem to be solved , a consequentially significant impairment to the successful solution of the problem  @xcite .",
    "recently , some work has used a phenomenological noise model of the fields @xmath13 and @xmath14 in which the distributions of the deviations from the programmed values are given by gaussians with means zero and standard deviations , respectively , of 0.05 and 0.035 ( in units of the maximal @xmath15 ) , independently instantiated for each qubit and anneal and constant throughout the course of a given anneal .",
    "the parameters of the gaussians were derived by adding in quadrature the variances of several known microscopic sources of noise  @xcite .",
    "this model has been used in an attempt to explain the failure rate of d - wave devices as partly due to misspecification of the programmable values .",
    "there are many sources of noise in quantum annealers , each with a different effect and time scale , and we address here only one manifestation .",
    "the variances we cite for @xmath13 and @xmath14 are in a sense incomparable to those just mentioned , and relevant only within the context of the experiments described below .",
    "the presence of systematic biases in quantum annealers has been reported elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the biases referred to there are fundamentally different in nature than the ones address here , in that the former are collective biases on the qubits of ferromagnetic chains that depend on the strength and topology of the couplings therein and are due to the noise specifically caused by those couplings , and they must be determined anew for each embedding topology used . in this work , we present a methodology for determining , in parallel , the persistent , systematic biases in all of the individually available programmable parameters of a quantum annealer that requires a relatively small amount of total annealing time .",
    "we show that correcting for these biases produces an increase in the quality of solutions found on a set of random benchmark instances .",
    "the strategy presented here is the first proposal for a full - device recalibration at the user level , i.e. based only on the data from tailored instances and without access to the low - level control circuitry .",
    "because actual quantum annealers operate at non - zero temperature , there exists some threshold for the values of the fields @xmath13 and couplings @xmath14 below which thermal effects dominate the annealing process .",
    "when the strengths of the fields and couplings are set sufficiently small , the probabilities of the final states of the qubits are well described by a boltzmann distribution .",
    "roughly , the relevant energy scale is given by @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath18 is the temperature .",

    "once experimental values of @xmath33 are obtained for various values of @xmath22 , the data are fit to obtain the estimates of @xmath23 and @xmath29 .      the biases of the couplings between qubits can be determined in a similar fashion .",

    "other probabilities @xmath42 , and combinations thereof such as @xmath43 , are analogously denoted .",
    "one approach to determine the bias @xmath39 is to naively assume that @xmath44 , in which case the thermal distribution is modeled by @xmath45 where @xmath46 .",
    "for concision , we leave the dependence of @xmath47 and @xmath48 on @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath39 , and @xmath51 implicit . similarly to the case for @xmath49 , this yields @xmath52    a more accurate estimate for @xmath39 can be obtained by considering nonzero @xmath23 and @xmath53 ( but still setting @xmath54 ) .",

    "the estimates of the biases can likely be made more accurate , as judged by their effect of their correction on subsequent estimations thereof and on performance on benchmark instances , given the same amount of annealing time .",

    "lastly , the risk of overcorrection can be mitigated by weighting the correction by the degree of certainty of the estimate of the bias to be corrected .",
    "although we focused initially on a standard random ensemble of ising instances for benchmarking the performance of quantum annealers , the effect of correcting biases should be greatest on instances whose ground states are most sensitive to misspecification of the programmable parameters .",
    "on average , this sensitivity increases with the range @xmath67 of the random ensemble , because the values of the parameters are scaled to fit within the finite physical range while the biases remain at the same absolute scale . at a large enough range @xmath67",
    ", however , even correction of the biases is not enough , and inherent fluctuations lead to almost zero success probabilities .",
    "this would explain the possible pattern seen in the elite mean comparison ( table  [ tab : benchmarks - results ] ) that the advantage of correction peaks seems to peak at the level of @xmath67 considered to correspond to the precision limit of the device .",
    "( that such a pattern is not as apparent in the greedy comparison is easily explained by natural noisiness of that comparison method , especially for instances with extremely low success probability as was the case here . )",
    "there is reason to suspect that correction will also have a beneficial effect in reducing the effect of gauge selection on success probability . while there are other suspected reasons for the effect of gauge selection ( which would be non - existent in an ideal device ) , that biases could be one factor is plausible .",
    "the effect of gauge selection is significant , sometimes leading to an orders - of - magnitude difference in the success probabilities , and so this is a promising avenue for bias correction .",
    "importantly , while the @xmath34 biases determined here are in general smaller than the @xmath20 biases , numerical studies indicate that often instances are more sensitive to misspecification in the @xmath34 parameters than in the @xmath20 parameters@xcite .",
