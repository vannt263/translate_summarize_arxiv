    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are interacting binary systems which comprise a low - mass secondary star ( mostly a red dwarf ) losing material to a white dwarf ( wd ) primary star .",
    "they exhibit complex photometric variability , which is characterised by a variety of phenomena like e.g. eclipses , rapid oscillations , ellipsoidal modulation and abrupt and conspicuous brightenings ( i.e. dwarf nova eruptions or nova outbursts ) .",
    "other tell - tale signs of cvs are the presence of strong emission lines in their optical spectra , their blue colour and , especially in the case of magnetic cvs , their x - ray luminosity , all of which are made good use of in searches for this kind of variable stars . for a general review of cvs ,",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "nova - like cataclysmic variables are characterised by high mass transfer rates and prominent steady state accretion discs and do not show large amplitude outbursts . among this subgroup of cvs ,",
    "the stars are set apart by several common traits , which include unusual v - shaped eclipse profiles , single - peaked emission lines exhibiting central absorption dips around orbital phases @xmath3 , a substantial orbital phase lag ( 0.10.2 cycle ) of the radial velocities of the balmer lines and high - velocity emission s - waves with maximum blueshift near phase @xmath1 ( @xcite ) .",
    "systems are not rare but dominate in the period range @xmath4 hours ( @xcite ) , just above the period gap .",
    "recently , evidence has been mounting that the phenomenon is an evolutionary stage in the life of cvs @xcite .",
    "optical transient surveys such as the catalina real - time transient survey ( crts ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the all - sky automated survey for supernovae ( asas - sn1 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are routinely discovering new dwarf novae by the hundreds through detection of their outbursts .",
    "equally , x - ray observatories like e.g. rosat @xcite , integral @xcite or swift @xcite have contributed to the discovery of many magnetic cvs .",
    "however , our knowledge of the intrinsic population of the nova - like cvs , which neither show large amplitude outbursts nor the x - ray emission typical of their magnetic brethren , is probably still rather incomplete .",
