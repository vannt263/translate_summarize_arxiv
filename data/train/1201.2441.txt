    "given a meromorphic linear differential system on the riemann sphere , @xmath0 it is important to determine whether a singularity of @xmath1 is a _ regular _ singular point for the system ( [ sd ] ) . unlike with scalar linear differential equations , for which there is a purely algebraic condition on the orders of the poles of the coefficients due to l. fuchs @xcite , a system ( [ sd ] ) can display arbitrarily high pole orders at a regular singularity .",

    "the most classical tries to iteratively construct a suitable gauge transformation @xmath9 , usually coefficient by coefficient in the series expansion . featured methods rely on the linear algebra over @xmath10 involved by equation ( [ gauge ] ) , like moser and continuators ( @xcite ) , whose methods are widely used nowadays in computer algebra , or other researchers such as @xcite , while @xcite use lie group theoretic tools .",
    "the nature of a singularity of @xmath1 can also considered from point of view of meromorphic connections @xcite , and especially , as a question of stability of certain _ lattices _ under the differential operator induced by the connection @xcite .",
    "we focus here specifically on the approach of _ saturating lattices _ used by grard and levelt @xcite : the true poincar rank @xmath11 is the minimum integer @xmath12 such that the sequence of @xmath12-saturated lattices ( recalled in section  [ gls ] ) eventually stabilises .",
    "recent work has shown close relations between the geometric framework of the bruhat - tits building of @xmath13 , for some discrete valued field such as @xmath14 , and tropical convexity @xcite .",
    "we show here that grard and levelt s approach can be formulated and efficiently computed in this framework , as a projection on the tropical linear space @xmath15 attached to the valuated matroid @xmath5 corresponding to a given _ membrane _ in the bruhat - tits building .",
    "results of keel and tevelev @xcite show that , when lattices are in a same membrane of the bruhat - tits building , they are _ homothetic _ if and only if they are projected on the same point of a tropical linear space by an explicit nearest point projection map ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) . we need to be able to tell whether lattices are actually equal .",
    "we show that the projection map respects the valuation , and projects only _ equal _ lattices on a same point ( theorem [ kt ] ) .",
    "we then construct the _ grard - levelt membrane _ that contains all the @xmath12-saturated lattices ( proposition  [ glm ] ) , and give a tropical version of grard - levelt s lattice stabilisation criterion ( corollary  [ p ] ) .",
    "third , we show that the same formula amazingly allows for the computation of a more subtle invariant , namely the _",
    "katz rank _ of the connection ( theorem  [ k ] ) , without having to either to compute a single gauge transformation nor perform the usually required ramification of the variable .",
    "the projection map given in  @xcite has unfortunately a high complexity .",
    "we give in section  [ proj ] an efficient algorithm to compute this projection map onto the linear tropical space attached to a valuated matroid .",

    "@xcite . the algorithm presented here , which computes the nearest @xmath16-projection on the tight - span of a valuated matroid , has a wider applicability than the differential computations explained in the previous parts , especially in phylogenetics @xcite .",

    "<S> we present an unexpected application of tropical convexity to the determination of invariants for linear systems of differential equations . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the classical grard - levelt lattice saturation procedure can be geometrically understood in terms of a projection on the tropical linear space attached to a subset of the local affine bruhat - tits building , that we call the _ grard - levelt membrane_. this provides a way to compute the true poincar rank , but also the katz rank of a meromorphic connection without having to perform gauge transforms nor ramifications of the variable . </S>",
    "<S> we finally present an efficient algorithm to compute this tropical projection map , generalising ardila s method for the case of the bergman fan to the case of the tight - span of a valuated matroid . </S>"
