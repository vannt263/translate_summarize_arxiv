    "since the seminal papers by saffman & taylor ( 1958 ) and taylor & saffman ( 1959 ) the motion of bubbles in a hele - shaw cell , where the fluids are confined between two closely spaced parallel plates , has attracted a great deal of attention . because the problem is amenable to analytic treatment , particularly in the case when surface tension effects are neglected , many exact solutions have been found for both steady and time - dependent flows .",
    "a comprehensive list of references , up to 1998 , on hele - shaw flows was compiled by s. d. howison ( people.maths.ox.ac.uk/howison/hele-shaw ) .",
    "hele - shaw flows have also recently been recognized as having deep connections with other areas of mathematical physics ( mineev - weinstein _ et al .",
    "_ 2000 , gustafsson & vasilev 2006 ) .",
    "exact solutions for hele - shaw flows are thus of interest not only for their eventual physical significance but also on their own right for they are solutions to a difficult free - boundary problem . some known exact solutions for the motion of bubbles and fingers in a hele - shaw cell were briefly reviewed by vasconcelos ( 2001 ) .",
    "more recently , other exact solutions have been found , such as time - dependent solutions for hele - shaw flows around a wedge ( cummings 1999 , richardson 2001b , c , vasconcelos 2007 ) and solutions for multiple steady bubbles in a hele - shaw cell with no assumed symmetry obtained by crowdy ( 2009a , b ) .",
    "exact solutions for a periodic stream of bubbles in a hele - shaw cell have also been found .",
    "the first of such solutions was obtained by burgess & tanveer ( 1991 ) for a stream of bubbles in the channel geometry with one bubble per unit cell . in the limit",
    "that the period is taken to infinity their solution recovers the solution originally given by taylor & saffman ( 1959 ) for a single bubble in a channel .",
    "exact solutions for a stream of bubbles in an unbounded hele - shaw cell were subsequently found by vasconcelos ( 1993 ) .",
    "the burgess - tanveer solution was later generalized by vasconcelos ( 1994 ) for a wider class of solutions with an arbitrary number of symmetrical bubbles per unit cell . here",
    "again taking the period to infinity yields solutions with an arbitrary but finite number of symmetrical bubbles in a hele - shaw channel ( vasconcelos 2001 ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that a periodic solution in a hele - shaw channel can be extended to the entire plane by successive reflections at the channel walls thus yielding a doubly - periodic solution in an unbounded cell . in this context ,",
    "exact solutions for doubly - periodic flows in a hele - shaw cell are of interest not only from a mathematical viewpoint , for they correspond to a more general situation , but also from a physical perspective because in certain cases they can be realized as a stream of bubbles in a hele - shaw channel and hence may ( in principle ) be susceptible to experimental investigation . a brief experimental study of a stream of bubbles rising in an inclined hele - shaw cell was reported by maxworthy ( 1986 ) .    in the present paper , we report a rather general class of exact solutions for a doubly - periodic array of steadily moving bubbles in a hele - shaw cell .",
    "our generic solutions are valid in an unbounded hele - shaw cell but there is a large subclass of solutions that correspond to a stream of bubbles in a hele - shaw channel . to render the problem analytically tractable ,",
    "we neglect surface tension effects and suppose that the bubbles either are symmetrical with respect to the channel centreline or have fore - and - aft symmetry ( or both ) , so that the flow domain can be reduced to a simply - connected unit cell . by using conformal mapping techniques , a general solution for any number of bubbles per unit cell",
    "is obtained in integral form .",
    "our solution represents the most general periodic solution for a stream of bubbles in a hele - shaw cell , in the sense that all previously known periodic solutions are particular cases of the solutions reported here .",
    "furthermore , our solutions include several novel configurations that were not obtained before , such as the case of a staggered two - file array of bubbles in a channel that somewhat resembles the  zipper \"- like flows of red cells in capillaries ( sugihara - seki & fu 2005 ) .",
    "also presented are solutions with  mixed symmetry \" in the channel geometry where within a given bubble configuration some bubbles have fore - and - aft symmetry and others are symmetrical about the channel centreline .",
    "examples are also given of solutions that can not be restricted to the channel geometry and hence must necessarily be considered in an unbounded hele - shaw cell .",
    "we consider the problem of a doubly - periodic array of bubbles moving with a constant velocity @xmath0 along the @xmath1-direction in an unbounded hele - shaw cell . for convenience",
    ", we shall work in a reference frame moving with the bubbles in which the flow is steady and the bubbles stationary .",
    "we assume that the solutions have streamwise and spanwise periods of @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively , and so we reduce the problem to a rectangular unit cell , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "we place the origin of our system of coordinates at the centre of the unit cell , so that its upper and lower edges are at @xmath4 and the left and right edges at @xmath5 .",
    "we shall assume furthermore that the bubble configuration is symmetrical with respect to reflections about the following four axes : @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 .",
    "with this assumption we only need to consider the problem in a reduced unit cell corresponding to one quarter , say , the upper - right quarter , of the original unit cell ; see fig .",
    "[ fig2a ] .",
    "now let @xmath10 denote the domain occupied by the fluid within the reduced unit cell . for simplicity of notation",
    ", we shall denote by @xmath11 a generic bubble - fluid interface . as is usual for hele - shaw flows , we introduce the complex potential @xmath12 , where @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the velocity potential , and @xmath15 is the associated stream function .",
    "we recall that the velocity potential ( in the moving frame ) is given by @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the gap between the cell plates , @xmath18 is the viscosity , and @xmath19 is the fluid pressure .",
    "the complex potential @xmath20 must be analytic in the fluid domain @xmath21 and satisfy the appropriate boundary conditions , as we now discuss .",
    "the pressure inside a bubble is assumed to be constant and surface tension effects are neglected .",
    "the complex potential @xmath22 must then satisfy the following condition on a fluid - bubble interface @xmath23 @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a complex - valued constant .",
    "( the value of the constant @xmath25 depends on the specific bubble one considers and is related to the position of the bubble centroid . )",
    "the complex potential must also satisfy specific conditions on the boundaries of the unit cell , as follows .",
    "given that the upper and lower edges of our unit cell are streamlines of the flow and that the left and right edges are equipotentials , we must then have @xmath26 @xmath27 @xmath28@xmath29 where i m and re denote real and imaginary parts , respectively . here @xmath30 is the average velocity across the unit cell in the @xmath1-direction in the lab frame and @xmath31 is a positive constant whose physical meaning will become clear shortly . an explicit expression for @xmath31 in terms of @xmath32 , @xmath30 and the total area @xmath33 occupied by the bubbles ( within a unit cell )",
    "can be obtained .",
    "we refer the reader to burgess and tanveer ( 1991 ) for the details and simply quote the results here : @xmath34    the complex potential @xmath20 defined above can be seen as a conformal mapping from the fluid region in the @xmath35-plane onto the corresponding flow domain in the @xmath22-plane . in view of eqs .",
    "( [ eq:3e])([eq:3d ] ) , one readily sees that the flow domain in the @xmath22-plane corresponds to a rectangle , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2b ] .",
    "bubbles placed along the left and right edges of the unit cell in the @xmath35-plane are mapped onto horizontal slits in the @xmath22-plane , whereas bubbles on the streamlines @xmath8 and @xmath9 are mapped onto segments along the lines @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively ; see fig .",
    "[ fig2b ] .",
    "note that the horizontal slits on fig .",
    "[ fig2b ] correspond to the respective halves of the bubbles on the left and right edges that are within the reduced unit cell and hence such slits always penetrate into the rectangular domain in the @xmath22-plane .    as discussed in detail elsewhere",
    "( tian & vasconcelos 1993 , vasconcelos 2001 ) , steady hele - shaw flows have an interesting rotation invariance in the following sense : if a curve @xmath40 is a solution for a bubble moving with constant velocity @xmath0 along the @xmath1-direction in an unbounded hele - shaw cell , then the curve @xmath41 obtained from a rotation of @xmath40 about the origin by an angle @xmath42 is also a solution with the same velocity @xmath0 .",
    "alternatively , one can view the rotated solution as one in which the bubble itself is kept fixed while its velocity is rotated by an angle @xmath42 . in view of the rectangular geometry of our unit cell , it is particularly relevant for us here to consider a rotation by @xmath43 , where the bubbles move with the same velocity @xmath0 as in the original solution but now in the @xmath44-direction . in this case , the region occupied by the fluid in the rotated solution is exactly the same as that for the original problem , the main difference being that the upper and lower edges of the unit cell which are streamlines in the original solution become equipotentials in the rotated problem , whereas the left and right edges which were originally equipotentials become streamlines .    as shown by vasconcelos ( 2001 ) , the complex potential @xmath45 for the rotated problem ( in the corresponding moving frame )",
    "is given by @xmath46 .",

    "the flow domain for the rotated problem in the @xmath52-plane corresponds to a rectangle , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , with horizontal slits corresponding to the bubbles placed on @xmath8 and @xmath9 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2c ] .",
    "[ for the same reasons as discussed before , these horizontal slits always penetrate into the bounded domain in @xmath52-plane . ]",
    "consider now the conformal mapping @xmath55 from the upper half-@xmath56-plane onto the fluid domain in the @xmath35-plane , so that the boundary @xmath57 of the fluid domain in the @xmath35-plane is mapped onto the real axis of the @xmath56-plane , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2d ] .",
    "in particular , a bubble @xmath23 will be the image under @xmath55 of a corresponding interval @xmath58 on the real-@xmath56-axis ( see below ) .",
    "for definiteness , we also choose to map the point @xmath59 to an arbitrary point on the upper edge between the left - upper corner and the next bubble ; see fig .  2 .",
    "in the most general configuration , one has one bubble on each corner and an arbitrary number of bubbles on each edge of the cell . to keep track of all the bubbles ,",

    ", however , it is best to consider all such quantities as free parameters , deferring to the examples the moment when we shall need to fix the appropriate parameters .    with some abuse of notation",
    "let us now write @xmath77 so that the functions @xmath78 and @xmath79 can be viewed as the conformal mappings from the upper half-@xmath56-plane onto the flow domains in the @xmath22- and @xmath52-planes , respectively .",

    "summarizing our procedure so far , we have reduced our original free - boundary problem to the much simpler problem of obtaining two conformal mappings , namely , @xmath78 and @xmath79 , from the upper half-@xmath56-plane onto respective rectangular domains in the @xmath22- and @xmath52-planes .",
    "as we will see shortly , such mappings can be easily obtained from the schwarz - christoffel formula ( carrier _ et al .",
    "it should also be noted that in previous solutions that use conformal mapping ( see , e.g. tanveer 1987 ) , once the mapping @xmath78 from the chosen domain in the @xmath56-plane to the flow domain in the @xmath22-plane is known , then the mapping @xmath83 is constructed explicitly so as to satisfy the appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "our method has the advantage of making this step rather straighforward by identifying the function @xmath84 $ ] with the complex potential for the rotated problem , so that solving for the mapping @xmath79 then completes the solution . before presenting our general solutions , however , it is worthwhile to point out some special features of the solutions for the the case @xmath85 .",
    "solutions with @xmath86 are special in the sense that solutions for any @xmath87 can be generated by a proper rescaling of the solutions for the former case ( vasconcelos 2001 ) .",
    "to show this , we first note that from inspection of the flow domain in the @xmath22-plane [ fig .",

    "without loss of generality we will also set @xmath104 and @xmath105 henceforth .",

[ fig2b ] , the flow domain in the @xmath22-plane is a rectangle with @xmath106 ( @xmath107 ) horizontal slits corresponding to the bubbles on the left ( right ) side of the unit cell . this domain can be viewed as a degenerate polygon and so the corresponding mapping @xmath78 can be obtained from the schwarz - christoffel formula ( carrier _ et al .",

    "next we note that novel solutions can be generated if we place bubbles simultaneously at the left and at the right edges of the reduced unit cell ( and nowhere else ) .",

    "[ fig : zigzag ] we show a solution with two bubbles per unit cell , where each bubble has fore - and - aft symmetry but they lie in different equipotentials of the flow . seen in the laboratory frame , this solution corresponds to a staggered two - file array of bubbles moving steadily down the channel .",

    "here we briefly discuss the case in which the periodic array of bubbles can not be physically realized within the channel geometry and hence must be considered in an unbounded hele - shaw cell .",
    "we begin by noting that if there are bubbles placed on the upper and lower edges of our reduced unit cell , then the solutions can not be reduced to the channel geometry as before , and so one must considered an unbounded hele - shaw cell .",
    "an example of such case is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : unbounded ] .",
    "it is worth mentioning that this type of solution represents the most general solution for a periodic array of ( symmetrical ) bubbles in a hele - shaw cell , in the sense that the other types of solution can be obtained by either ` decimating ' or ` adding ' bubbles along any of the edges of the reduced unit cell .",
    "we have presented an exact solution for a doubly - periodic array of steadily moving bubbles in a hele - shaw cell with an arbitrary number of bubbles per unit cell .",
    "our solution represents the most general periodic solution for bubbles in a hele - shaw cell known to date , in the sense that the previously known solutions for a stream of bubbles in a hele - shaw channel are particular cases of the solutions reported here .",
    "in addition , our solution includes novel cases of periodic arrays of bubbles in a hele - shaw channel , such as multi - file flow of symmetrical bubbles and configurations with mixed symmetry , where some bubbles have centreline symmetry while others have fore - and - aft symmetry .",
    "examples of a doubly - periodic array of bubbles in an unbounded cell that can not be restricted to the channel geometry were also discussed .    in constructing our solutions we assumed that the bubbles either are symmetrical either with respect to the cell centreline or have fore - and - aft symmetry ( or both ) , so that the relevant flow domain can be reduced to a simply - connected unit cell . in this context , the existence of periodic solutions in a hele - shaw cell without any symmetry requirement , where the unit cell is no longer simply - connected , remains an open and interesting question .",
    "recently , a new methodology to treat hele - shaw flows in multiply - connected domains has been developed by richardson ( 2001a ) and crowdy ( 2009a , b ) .",
    "in particular , solutions for a finite number of asymmetric steadily - moving bubbles have been found both in an infinite hele - shaw cell ( crowdy 2009a ) and in the channel geometry ( crowdy 2009b ) .",
    "it is therefore likely that our solutions can be generalized to include the case of a periodic array of asymmetric bubbles .",
    "this interesting ( and more difficult ) problem clearly deserves to be studied further .",
    "another interesting point to be investigated is the effect of surface tension on the shape and velocity of our periodic array of bubbles . from previous works on the related problem for a single bubble ( tanveer 1986 , 1987 ; combescot & dombre 1988 ) as well for the burgess - tanveer periodic solution ( burgess & tanveer 1991 )",
    ", one expects that the ` degeneracy ' displayed by our solutions , meaning that fixing the geometrical parameters of the solution does not fix the bubble velocity @xmath0 , will most certainly be removed by surface tension .",
    "however , it is not clear which particular bubble arrangements , among our large class of solutions , will have counterparts in the case of nonzero surface tension .",
    "for instance , in the case of a single bubble in a hele - shaw channel , tanveer ( 1987 ) was unable to find solutions without symmetry with respect to channel centreline , even though such nonsymmetric solutions exist when surface tension is neglected . in light of these results",
    ", it appears that periodic solutions with centreline symmetry are more likely to ` survive ' in the nonzero surface tension scenario .",
    "unfortunately , however , the search for solutions with surface tension has to be performed numerically  a task that is likely to become increasingly more demanding as the number of bubble grows ."
