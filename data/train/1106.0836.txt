    "the interaction of an ensemble of identical two - level emitters with the electromagnetic field has been the subject of intense theoretical and experimental studies since the pioneering work of dicke @xcite . among the others ,",
    "superradiance ( or superfluorescence ) is the most celebrated effect ; it is manifested as a transient effect by the delayed emission of an intense burst of light , after the atomic population has been totally inverted @xcite .",
    "in essence , superradiance is characterized by the emergence of collective coherence , which leads to a strongly enhanced emission rate as compared to the case of uncorrelated emitters .",
    "such striking consequences of the quantum interference effect in radiation - matter coupled systems has been the subject of an intense experimental interest both for atomic @xcite and solid state @xcite ensembles .",
    "early studies on the statistical properties of the emitted light have evidenced the role of quantum fluctuations in the initial stages of the superradiant emission @xcite . whereas superradiance usually appears in the transient regime ,",
    "recent theoretical studies have evidenced other signatures of collective behavior in the steady state regime , e.g. when the two - level emitters are continuously excited by incoherent light  @xcite . in these references ,",
    "cooperative emission is obtained by coupling the emitters to a low quality ( @xmath0 ) cavity mode , which behaves as a collective channel of losses . as a matter of fact ,",
    "strong confinement enhances the interaction of each emitter with the cavity field , eventually making it predominant with respect to individual relaxation channels .",
    "collective dynamics can be induced this way , provided the atoms identically interact with the cavity mode , a condition much less stringent than in free space . tuning the pumping power allows one to explore different regimes , leading to different intensities and statistics for the emitted radiation @xcite .",
    "in particular , it has been shown that when the pumping strength is too low to saturate a single emitter of the ensemble , the collection of two - level systems emits a highly bunched field  @xcite .",
    "the strong temporal correlation has been attributed to the relaxation of the system in the subradiant states of the ensemble of emitters .",
    "these states behave as sources of photon pairs triggered by the driving pulses , hence the bunching effect in the correlation properties .    in this paper",
    ", we analyze the subradiant regime and go beyond previous works by keeping the cavity mode as a relevant degree of freedom .",
    "this situation is new with respect to previous theoretical studies , where the radiation mode was commonly eliminated by an adiabatic approximation .",
    "we show that the bunching degree decays with the number of emitters and oscillates with its parity , being larger when the number of emitters is even , upon converging to a single value as the number of emitters grows .",
    "we give an interpretation of this effect , based on the structure of hilbert space of the system .",
    "furthermore , keeping the cavity mode in the description allows to explore two other limits , depending on the cavity finesse .",
    "if this parameter is significantly increased , the strong coupling conditions lead to the emission of a field showing no temporal correlations , an effect that we identify with the emission of poissonian radiation similar to a lasing transition . recently",
    ", such regime has been investigated from the spectral point of view @xcite , while here we address its statistical properties . on the contrary , for decreasing cavity finesse one progressively decreases the coupling with the mode , allowing to continuously explore the boundary between collective and individual behavior of such radiation sources . when all the emitters become uncorrelated , increasing their number one by one up to large values coincides essentially with building a classical source with chaotic statistical properties .",
    "dipole correlation can also be destroyed with pure dephasing , a situation that we eventually explore as well .",
    "two - level emitters incoherently pumped by an external drive , coupled to a single resonator mode .",
    "correlations in the emitted field can be detected through a hbt set - up either from the cavity or from the emitters loss channel , respectively .",
    "a typical incoherent pumping scheme is shown , in which high - energy excitations relax down to a well defined ground state transition ( e.g. through phonon scattering ) via photon emission .",
    ", scaledwidth=48.0% ]    the present work becomes particularly relevant when considering that the subradiant regime is reachable if and only if each single emitter of the ensemble is predominantly coupled to the cavity mode .",
    "in particular , this allows to pump each emitter very slowly , but still faster than any individual relaxation mechanism .",
    "this is nowadays possible thanks to impressive progress in nano - fabrication technology on single emitter - cavity coupling  @xcite .",
    "small assemblies of artificial quantum emitters , like quantum dots @xcite and superconducting qubits @xcite coupled to a high - q resonator mode have recently become available , strongly motivating to investigate the new physics provided by these systems . moreover , beyond introducing an external parameter to control the steady state collective regime , this model is of great interest also for the study of lasing transition , as well as to investigate the connections between superradiance and lasing @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first introduce the model and the methods employed to solve it , both numerically and analytically ( sec .",

    "the range of validity of this ideal model in practical implementations is discussed in sec .",
    "the model can be rigorously described by the tavis - cummings hamiltonian ( in the rotating wave approximation ) @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the collective dipole operator , and @xmath8 is the lowering operator of the single emitter @xmath9 , whose excited ( ground ) state is denoted by @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) .",

    "[ fig1 ] , incoherent pumping can be obtained by resonantly exciting higher energy states , that further relax down to the levels of interest .",
    "the decay of the cavity mode with rate @xmath19 through imperfect mirrors is described by the following term @xmath20 whereas the pure dephasing of the emitters , which is unavoidable in solid - state artificial atoms , can be taken into account by a liouvillian term of the form @xcite @xmath21 following standard input - output theory @xcite , the output field at the photodetectors is proportional to the @xmath2 operator ( and its conjugate ) .",
    "we are interested in the temporal correlations of the field radiated by the cavity mode .",

    "( [ me ] ) either by direct integration or by quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations @xcite .",
    "direct integration allows one to obtain accurate results at lower computational time costs , for which we use an extension of the code already employed in a previous work  @xcite .",
    "however , the tensor structure of the phase space makes the computational resources needed for a direct integration rapidly diverge . on the contrary ( wave function )",
    "qmc gives the solution as a stochastic average over quantum trajectories of wavefunctions unravelings , drastically reducing the amount of space needed and allowing us to push forward the previous computational limits @xcite .",
    "if @xmath19 is large enough , the cavity mode can be adiabatically eliminated from the equations , giving rise to an effective dynamics described by the reduced master equation @xmath23 where @xmath24 the physical meaning of this equation is the following : the cavity acts as a common relaxation channel for the atoms , whose dissipation rate is quantified by the coupling strength with the collective atomic dipole @xmath25 , i.e. @xmath26 . namely , adiabatic elimination is valid when @xmath27 @xcite . in this regime , the cavity field , and thus the output field",

    "sweeping the cavity finesse allows to continuously explore the transition from a collective behavior driven by @xmath32 to an individual one , corresponding to @xmath33 . in this work",
    "we analytically study some limits of these regimes .",
    "if the dynamics is individual , it is naturally described in the uncoupled basis mentioned above .",
    "if the dynamics is collective , an order appears in the system due to the build up of correlations between dipoles belonging to different atoms @xcite , manifested by the occurrence of coherences in the uncoupled basis . in the latter case ,",

    "this behavior has been attributed to the emission of so called `` super - radiant '' photon pairs @xcite , typically separated by a delay scaling like the inverse of the pumping rate .",

    "a temporal picture for this effect is that as soon as @xmath65 , the cavity stores the photons on a timescale longer that the typical delay between two emission events by the atomic assembly , blurring out any temporal correlation feature .",

    ", three main effects on measurable quantities can be identified : ( i ) the average cavity population becomes larger than one , setting the onset of stimulated emission ( see also fig .",

    "[ fig3 ] that in the subradiant range there is an unexpected and quite pronounced parity - dependent oscillation of the photon correlation value at zero - time delay , a behavior that has not been discussed in the literature , to our knowledge .",
    "such parity oscillations are not limited to the adiabatic elimination region ( see the inset on the left panel for @xmath71 and up to a number of emitters @xmath72 ) . the latter calculation required consistent numerical optimization and was performed on a cluster , where the full master eq .",
    "( [ me ] ) could be solved without truncation effects on the convergence .",
    "although quite difficult to be analyzed in the dressed state picture , the oscillatory behavior of correlations as a function of the number of emitters can be roughly interpreted as a consequence of the collective coupling in eq .",

    "the former couples the states with the same quantum number @xmath73 and is diagonal in the coupled basis . on the contrary , the other channels act on each emitter and are responsible for coherences between states with different values of @xmath73 .",

    "the @xmath89-related de - excitation events are much more probable than the excitation events driven by the pumping rate @xmath18 .",
    "hence , as soon as an excitation is stored in a state where the two mechanisms are possible , it is more likely that the excitation will undergo a collective emission than an upward pump jump .",
    "the microscopic scenario will then involve one cycle ( pictured in green ) consisting of the excitation and relaxation of the symmetric state @xmath90 , leading to the emission of single photons . in the other cycle ( pictured in red ) , the excitation is first stored in @xmath88 .",

    "( [ truc ] ) was already observed in the pioneering antibunching experiment by kimble , dagenais and mandel with flying sodium atoms coherently driven  @xcite , and it was theoretically interpreted in the following years @xcite . in these references , the source of dephasing was mainly attributed to the finite size of the atomic source with a random number ( i.e. a poisson distribution ) of emitters inducing a spatial averaging out beyond the typical coherence volume of the fluorescence light @xcite . in nowadays experiments with solid state emitters confined in nanometre - size systems ,",
    "this problem could be ultimately overcome by considering a good control of the optical detection .",
    "however , notice that dephasing processes are always present in solid state quantum emitters ( due for example to coupling with phonons in solid matrices ) , and that the measurement of @xmath56 involves actually an average over finite values of @xmath122 near @xmath145 .",
    "if the typical dephasing time @xmath146 is larger than the time resolution of the hbt setup ( e.g. the jitter time of single photon detectors ) this may explain why experiments reported so far with different quantum emitters  @xcite tend to evidence a behavior that is closer to eq .",

    "( [ g2_right ] ) . observing the @xmath147 behavior , and its transition to @xmath148 , could be a challenging issue , e.g. requiring a control over the local temperature of the emitters .",
    "the results presented in this work suggest the intriguing possibility of studying the effects of cooperative emission with a mesoscopic number of quantum emitters in a high - finesse resonator .",
    "moreover , depending on the specific physical implementation of the proposed model , different regimes of cavity qed might be explored and characterized in terms of the statistical properties of the emitted radiation . to this purpose",
    ", we stress the relevance of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] in providing a roadmap to experimental investigations .",
    "in fact , depending on the specific system of few quantum emitters coupled to a single cavity mode , different regimes of @xmath63 might be realized .    however , some of the requirements that we assumed in our analysis might be difficult to be simultaneously realized in a physical implementation of the proposed model .",
    "namely , we assumed identical quantum emitters , equal dissipation rates , low pumping of each individual emitter as compared to its coupling to the cavity mode . in order to realize the conditions @xmath149",
    ", each quantum emitter should have a high beta factor ( quantifying the coupling to the cavity loss channel ) .",
    "usually , this is quite challenging with solid state artificial atoms , like quantum dots , where inhomogeneous broadening ( which can be related to @xmath119 ) would inevitably mix the different @xmath73 states .",
    "atomic systems in optical resonators would certainly offer an ideal implementation for what concerns the atomic - like properties , but it would be difficult to have a mesoscopic number of such atoms at fixed spatial positions .",
    "alternatively , atomic - like impurities in solid state resonators , e.g. semiconductors , might represent a valid scenario for this type of physics to be investigated .    as a first example , we consider semiconductor quantum dots , especially made in iii - v materials , as a promising approach to coupling in a deterministic way  @xcite a few quantum emitters to the same cavity mode , e.g. using photonic crystal cavities  @xcite .",
    "such systems can have @xmath150 mev @xcite and @xmath151 mev  @xcite .",
    "we can thus expect to be in the range @xmath152 for such a physical implementation , where subradiant vs. lasing behaviors could be studied under weak driving conditions . as these nanostructures",
    "are usually grown randomly , and strong inhomogeneous fluctuations between different quantum emitters occur , techniques have been recently developed to post - process the sample and obtain more homogeneous ensembles  @xcite . electrical control of different quantum emitters has also been shown to provide an effective tuning mechanism  @xcite .",
    "moreover , growth of pyramidal dots in pre - patterned positions  @xcite is a very promising technique to place more than one such nanostructures in the antinodes of the cavity field in order to maximize coupling .    for active centers in solid - state resonators ,",
    "the coupling to the cavity mode is usually several orders of magnitude smaller , dictated by the smaller oscillator strength of an atomic - like impurity as compared to a quantum dot . in such case ,",
    "the conditions for high-@xmath153 values might be investigated , i.e. the crossover from subradiant to superradiant emission , and maybe to individualization .",
    "recently , single to few nitrogen - vacancy centers in diamond have been implanted in pre - determined spatial positions  @xcite .",
    "resonators in diamond have already been realized with quality factors ranging from few hundreds in early attempts  @xcite up to 4000 more recently  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , nv - centers are not the only type of active defects in diamond , see e.g. recent advances with cr - centers @xcite and silicon - vacancies ( siv centers )  @xcite . among solid state emitters ,",
    "we also include single molecules in standing wave resonators made from a bragg mirror and a resolution limited focused beam through an optical fibre  @xcite .",
    "the latter approach has the advantage that the cavity can be formed at any arbitrary position , once the single molecules have been selected on the bragg mirror surface .",
    "such quantum emitters display radiation - limited zero - phonon line , thus showing very limited pure dephasing rate with almost radiation - limited linewidths  @xcite .    finally , a promising platform to realize a controlled experiment might be with circuit qed devices , where the coupling of a few qubits to a single resonator has already been realized  @xcite .",
    "high tunability of the qubits physical properties , such as transition energy , dissipation rates , pure dephasing and effective oscillator strength , make these systems particularly attractive to closely realize the model in eqs .",
    "( [ tc_h]-[me ] ) , and to experimentally address the physical results reported in the present work .",
    "we have presented an extensive theoretical analysis of the quantum statistical properties of a source of electromagnetic radiation made of few two - level emitters coupled a single resonator mode .",
    "we have assumed a model in which the two - level systems are incoherently pumped by a weak external drive , and dissipate their energy through spontaneous emission in free space , pure dephasing , or other loss channels that can be described within a liouvillian formalism . in this sense",
    ", the present work should be considered as an extension of our previous report on single emitter cavity qed  @xcite , where we have analyzed the crossover from a single - photon source ( emitting anti - bunched radiation ) to a single - emitter lasing regime .",
    "however , the case of more than one emitter studied here presents a much richer phenomenology depending on the specific light - matter coupling regime of each single emitter with the common radiation field , which can be identified from the statistical properties of the emitted radiation . throughout this work",
    ", we have assumed a tuning parameter given by the ratio of the cavity decay rate to the single emitter - cavity coupling strength , which we could numerically investigate by spanning over 10 decades . as a function of this parameter",
    ", we have clarified the crossover from lasing ( low cavity decay rate as compared to emitters cavity coupling ) to chaotic light emission ( very large cavity decay rate ) , going through sub- and super - radiance in steady state .",
    "although in the superradiant regime the emitted radiation would present a close - to - poissonian statistics , we have explicitly shown that it would not reach the level of coherence displayed by a laser source .",
    "between these two regimes , sub - radiant emission takes place and the emitted radiation undergoes super - poissonian intensity fluctuations .",
    "we have shown that the strong bunching in the degree of the second - order coherence oscillates with the parity of the number of emitters , eventually converging to a single value in the large number limit .",
    "we have clarified the origin of this novel behavior by using a suitable basis for the system of few emitters , showing that it is due to the presence of extra - loops in the radiative cascade from subradiant states when the number of emitters is odd , thus reducing the degree of bunching with respect the even case .",
    "finally , we have also studied the conditions for reaching an incoherent source of chaotic radiation , which can be done either by coupling the ensemble of emitters to a very leaky cavity , or by enhancing the pure dephasing rate ( a feature that is quite natural for solid - state quantum emitters ) .    as a last remark ,",
    "notice that the cavity finesse has been the only parameter to be significantly changed in order to produce very different output fields .",
    "recently , fast dynamical control of this parameter has been demonstrated in different scenarios  @xcite , suggesting that a system composed of few emitters inside a resonant cavity could be a versatile source of very different quantum states of light .",
    "an immediate and important extension of this work related to its experimental and technological implications would be to investigate the effects caused by the inhomogeneous distribution of the quantum emitters , which is a typical setting for smiconductor quantum dots .",
    "a further seemingly important extension would be to explore the consequences of the ultra - strong coupling regime ( available nowadays for superconducting qubits in microwave resonators ) on the statistics of the emitted radiation . in the latter scenario , anti - rotating wave terms in the hamiltonian ( [ tc_h ] )",
    "must be taken into account  @xcite in order to properly get the emitted radiation and statistics .",
