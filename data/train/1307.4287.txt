    "in hierarchical cosmology , accretion ( or merging ) of smaller galaxies contributes significantly to the growth of a large galaxy ( e.g. the classical theoretical work by @xcite and @xcite ) , especially in its early evolutionary stage .",
    "the most recent observational studies of the growth of galaxies were carried out by the califa group @xcite , who analyzed 105 galaxies of the largest three - dimensional spectroscopic survey of galaxies in the local universe .",
    "the outskirts of galaxies hold fundamental clues about their formation history .",
    "it is into these regions that new material continues to arrive as part of the ongoing assembly and was deposited during the violent interactions in the galaxy s distant past . since it takes a very long time for the accreted material to be erased by the process of phase mixing due to the long dynamical timescales , we can detect various substructures , e.g. tidal tails , that are expected to be harbored in the areas beyond the disk of a large galaxy .",
    "the tidal disruption of these small systems is expected to result in loosely bounded stars surrounding the galaxy , at distances up to 10100 times the radius of the central disk @xcite .",
    "substructures like stellar streams , have been observed in both milky way ( mw ) and other large spiral galaxies .",
    "the sagittarius dwarf galaxy provides a fine example in the mw ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the andromeda galaxy ( m31 ) is the nearest large spiral system and one of the best candidates for studying the debris of interaction .",
    "a large number of coherent stellar substructures have been detected in its halo and outer disk ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the number , luminosity , morphology and stellar population of the relics provide important clues to the assemblage history of the galaxy .",
    "however , a comprehensive survey of those relics is quite difficult , given their intrinsic faintness , dense distribution and the vast space over which the stars are spread .",
    "those factors make the stars and clusters in m31 not ideal tools for abundance studies . besides , there is also contamination from the foreground stars of the mw .",
    "planetary nebulae ( pne ) are excellent tracers to study the chemistry , kinematics , and stellar contents of the substructures because they are bright but not packed too closely .",
    "pne are easily detectable at the distance of m31 ( 785  kpc ; @xcite ) , given their bright narrow emission line spectra .",
    "they are also one of the best candidates that can provide both very accurate velocities and precision abundance measurements of elements such as o , he , ne , n , ar and s. observations and chemical studies of pne ( as well as h  ii regions ) in m31 have been carried out decades ago ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; the most recent observations are by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) . using the nebular sample available ,",
    "oxygen abundance gradient in m31 has been derived .",
    "that helps to understand the chemical evolution of the galaxy .",
    "a number of substructures have been observed in the outer halo of m31 .",
    "the northern spur is a peculiar low surface brightness structure sticking out of m31 s disk , which contains a metal - rich stellar population .",
    "it had been observed to lie in the direction of m31 s gaseous warp decades ago ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite noticed the anti - symmetrical warping of the stellar disk along the major axis of m31 through digital stacking of palomar schmidt plates of the galaxy .",
    "@xcite observed a faint light bending away from the northern major axis using multi - color photometry and attributed that to either a possible galactic reflection nebula or a warp in the outer stellar disk of m31 .",
    "however , the results for the northern outer disk of m31 , according to @xcite , was not conclusive due to faintness of the emission there .",
    "the warp observed by both @xcite and @xcite to the northeastern major axis of m31 starts at about 18  kpc from the galactic center and extends to the region well beyond @xmath225  kpc .",
    "since the northern spur lies in the direction of m31 s gaseous warp , its projection away from the galactic plane was usually attributed to a severe warp in the stellar disk .",
    "progress in observational and data - processing techniques during the past decade have enabled large surveys .",
    "the faint substructures of m31 can now be studied in greater details , and consequently their properties be better understood .",
    "@xcite discovered a giant stream ( i.e. southern stream ) of metal - rich stars within the halo of m31 , and they attributed the possible source of the stream to the dwarf galaxies m32 and ngc205 , which are close companions of m31 and might have lost a substantial number of stars due to tidal interactions .",
    "@xcite concluded that the epoch of galaxy building of m31 still continues , and that tidal streams might be a generic feature of galaxy haloes .",
    "@xcite carried out a panoramic survey of the halo and outer disk of m31 and studied the density and color distribution of red giant branch ( rgb ) stars .",
    "they confirmed the southern stream first announced by @xcite and found enhancement in both stellar density and metallicity in the northern spur .",
    "inspired by the asymmetry of the southern stream ( i.e. it does not appear to the north - west ) , @xcite hypothesized that the southern stream might be associated with northern spur .",
    "@xcite measured a radial distance change along the stream by analyzing the metal - rich rgb luminosity function , and derived an angle of 60@xmath3 of the stream to the line of sight . combining the distance gradient with the angular extent",
    ", @xcite found that the southern stream extends from approximately 100  kpc behind to 40  kpc in front of m31 .",
    "@xcite proposed that southern stream might be connected to the northern spur and presented a three - dimensional orbit for that connection by studying the dynamics of pne in the disk of m31 .",
    "they also suggested that m32 might be the source of the two substructures mainly because the satellite is found to coincide with the southern stream in both the spatial position and velocity .",
    "currently , the exact origin of the northern spur is still largely unknown , and the dynamical model proposed by @xcite needs to be tested .",
    "however , the observational data in this region is scarce . in order to assess the hypothesis of the origin of the northern spur by studying its chemistry",
    ", we present spectroscopic observations of pne in this substructure and deduce their elemental abundances from emission lines detected in the spectra .",
    "this is the first chemical study of the pne in the northern spur with spectroscopy .",
    "section[part2 ] of this paper presents observations and data reduction , and demonstrates the challenge we have in observing the pne in the northern spur .",
    "line flux measurements , plasma diagnostics and abundance determinations are given in section[part3 ] .",
    "comparison of the abundances in our sample with those in the m31 disk and bulge pne ( also h  ii regions ) is presented in section[part4 ] .",
    "discussion of the possible origin of the northern spur is also given in section[part4 ] .",
    "summary and conclusion are given in section[part5 ] .",
    "the main purpose of the current observation is to try to understand the formation history of substructure in the outer disk of m31 by studying the chemistry of pne in the northern spur of m31 . in order to obtain accurate measurements of the heavy element abundances , we need to know the physical conditions , most importantly , the electron temperatures of those pne .",
    "however , the heliocentric velocity of m31 ( @xmath4300km / s ) , combined with the very bright mercury line hg  i @xmath04358.34 from the nearby urban area , makes the [ o  iii ] @xmath04363.21 auroral line difficult to resolve . in order to make the [ o  iii ] @xmath04363 line measurable , pne with lowest radial velocities",
    "are favored .",
    "candidates for observations were selected from @xcite .",
    "most of the candidates have either low radial velocities but also low surface brightness ( e.g. with the magnitudes of [ o  iii ] @xmath05007 @xmath521.5 ) , or relatively high surface brightness but also high radial velocities .",
    "finally , a compromise between magnitude of the [ o  iii ] @xmath05007 line and radial velocity , as well as the consideration of time , resulted in three objects for observation .",
    "table[sample ] presents the coordinates ( right ascension and declination , hereafter ra and dec , respectively ) , apparent magnitudes at [ o  iii ] @xmath05007 , heliocentric velocities and galactocentric distances of the three pne ( hereafter named pn1 , pn2 and pn3 ) .",
    "these pne are located in the outer disk of m31 , and have been identified as in the northern spur substructure by @xcite .",
    "their projected galactocentric distances are from 23 to 27  kpc .",
    "figure[m31_pne ] shows the spatial distribution of pne observed in m31 .",
    "the sample includes the @xmath23000 pne from @xcite and those observed by lamost @xcite .",
    "the coordinates @xmath6 and @xmath7 in figure[m31_pne ] are the offsets in ra and dec relative to the center of m31 , respectively , and thus define an m31-based reference frame . @xmath6 and @xmath7 are calculated following the geometric transformations of @xcite ,    @xmath8    and @xmath9 where ra@xmath10 = 00@xmath1142@xmath1244.4@xmath13 ( j2000.0 ) and dec@xmath10 = 41@xmath316@xmath1408@xmath15 ( j2000.0 ) are the coordinates of the optical center of m31 and are adopted from @xcite .",
    "the radial velocities of pn1 , pn2 and pn3 are @xmath1619.6 , @xmath1644.4 and @xmath1690.3  km / s , respectively .",
    "thus the corresponding wavelength differences between the observed [ o  iii ] @xmath04363 auroral line and the mercury line at @xmath04358 for the three objects are 4.59 , 4.23 and 3.56 .",
    "given that the width of the mercury line is 56 and the full width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of nebular emission line is @xmath22.40 for the blue spectra , the [ o  iii ] @xmath04363 auroral line is expected to be resolved from the mercury line for all three objects , provided that subtraction of the sky background is good .",
    "we observed three pne in the northern spur outer disk of m31 with the double spectrograph ( dbsp ) on the palomar 5.1 m hale telescope .",
    "the dichroic d48 , which splits light into separate blue and red channels around 4800 was used .",
    "the two channels cover wavelength ranges 34004900 and 48007300 . in the observations , the dbsp configuration consists of a 1200 line  mm@xmath17 grating blazed at 4150 ( with a grating angle of 34.75@xmath3 ) in the blue arm and a 316 line  mm@xmath17 grating blazed at 6050 ( with a grating angle of 23.25@xmath3 ) in the red channel .",
    "the blue channel has a thinned , ar coated 2048@xmath184096 ( in the 4096 dispersion axis ) ccd with 15@xmath19 m pixels , and the red channel has a thinned 4096@xmath182048 ccd with 15@xmath19 m pixels .",
    "given the seeing condition ( @xmath21.5arcsec ) at palomar , the slit width was set to be 1.5arcsec ; slit length is 128arcsec .",
    "this setup enabled us to perform spectroscopy over the wavelength range 34004900 with a resolution of 2.4 ( fwhm ) at 0.55  pixel@xmath17 , and over the wavelength range 48007300 with a resolution of 6.9 ( fwhm ) at 2.45  pixel@xmath17 .",
    "observations were taken on two nights ( table[sample ] ) .",
    "on ut date 2011 september 22 , we observed two pne ( pn1 and pn2 ) .",
    "the observation consisted of eight 1800s exposures of pn1 and four of pn2 ( for both the blue and red channels of dbsp ) .",
    "the observations were taken under photometric conditions with a typical seeing of 1.5arcsec . on september 23 , we observed pn2 and pn3 .",
    "the observation consisted of four 1800s exposures of pn2 and six of pn3 .",
    "the limiting magnitude of the guide star ccd on the telescope is approximately 16 magnitude , while our target pne are much fainter . in order to locate the faint targets in the slit",
    ", we adopted the so - called `` blind offset '' technique : first placed the slit on a selected bright guide star near each target pn , and then moved the slit to the target position . in order to avoid light loss due to atmospheric diffraction",
    ", the slit was placed along the parallactic angle during observation .",
    "that was calculated by the telescope control system .",
    "the slit was rotated every 3060 minutes during observation .",
    "the data of both nights were calibrated via a series of exposures of the spectrophotometric standard stars lds749b and hz2 , which were selected from the eso standard stars catalogues .",
    "arc lines of an fear lamp were used for wavelength calibration for the blue spectra of the three pne , and an hearne lamp was used for the red .",
    "exposures of lamps were made before observations of each pn target so that errors in wavelength calibration can be minimized .",

    "all the data were reduced with standard procedures for long - slit spectra using the long92 package in midas .",
    "the raw 2-dimensional ( 2-d ) spectra were debiased , flat - fielded and cosmic - ray removed , and then wavelength calibrated using exposures of an fear ( for the blue data ) and hearne ( for the red data ) lamp . sky background was then subtracted from the 2-d spectra .",
    "1-d spectra of the pne were extracted from the 2-d spectra , corrected for the atmospheric extinction , and flux calibrated using observations of the standard stars lds749b and hz2 .",
    "the 1-d spectra with 1800s exposure for each pn were then combined , corrected for interstellar extinction ( see section[part2:d ] ) and then normalized such that h@xmath25 has an integrated flux of 100 . here",
    "the h@xmath26 line was used for the blue spectra and h@xmath1 for the red , assuming that the @xmath27(h@xmath26)/@xmath27(h@xmath25 ) and @xmath27(h@xmath1)/@xmath27(h@xmath25 ) ratios of h  i are as those calculated by @xcite at @xmath28 = 10000  k and @xmath29 = 10@xmath30  @xmath31 in case  b recombination .",
    "figures[pne_blue ] and [ pne_red ] are the blue and red 1-d spectra of the three pne , respectively . the s / n of the blue spectra are systematically lower than those of the red data , which are mainly due to the relatively low efficiency of the blue ccd",
    ".    observations of the three pne in the northern spur of m31 are challenging , given that the sky background at the palomar observatory is strong and our targets are faint .",
    "the very bright mercury line at 4358 makes it difficult to directly observe the [ o  iii ] @xmath04363 auroral line ( section[part2:a ] ) which can be used to derive the electron temperature .",
    "we managed to detect emission lines in the three pne , and separated the [ o  iii ] @xmath04363 line from the mercury line in two objects .",
    "figures[pn1_2d ] , [ pn2_2d ] and [ pn3_2d ] show the 2-d blue spectrum of pn1 , pn2 and pn3 , respectively , in the wavelength region 37104405 .",
    "the [ o  iii ] @xmath04363 auroral line can be seen in the sky - subtracted spectra of pn1 and pn3 .",
    "however , residuals from sky subtraction , especially of the strong mercury line , are still present in the processed 2-d image ( see the lower panels of figures[pn1_2d ] , [ pn2_2d ] and [ pn3_2d ] ) .",
    "that is because sky subtraction was done by choosing two separate sections on the slit , one on either side of a target spectrum , with a separation of about 35 pixels from the pn , so that the effects of image distortion along the slit can be minimized .",
    "consideration has been given to the distortion of emission lines .",
    "we tried to map out the distortion of the hg  i @xmath04358 mercury line along the slit .",
    "that was done by measuring the peak wavelengths of the mercury line in the wavelength - calibrated 2-d image along the slit direction , with every five rows of ccd pixels binned together .",
    "the peak positions of the mercury line were well fitted with linear regression .",
    "the linear fit yields a very small angle relative to the slit direction , which indicates that the distortion is small .",
    "we also checked the distribution of the mercury line flux along the slit , and found that is mostly homogeneous .",
    "besides , the sky background regions defined on the slit ( two regions on the slit , with one on either side of a target pn ) are very close to the target pn .",
    "thus the effects of distortion of the sky lines on the pn emission line measurements are negligible .",
    "nevertheless , we applied the distortion correction to all 2-d frames . despite much effort",
    "has been paid , not much can be further improved in sky subtraction . given the relatively strong sky background compared to the intrinsic faintness of our target pne",
    ", it is difficult to completely remove the sky background over the whole slit on the 2-d frame .",
    "since the pne in m31 are point sources , emission lines on a 2-d spectrum are detected as bright spots ( see figures[pn1_2d ] , [ pn2_2d ] and [ pn3_2d ] ) with 5 - 10 pixels in diameter depending on strength of the line .",
    "the dispersion direction of the blue spectrum is not always perpendicular to the slit .",
    "we carried out polynomial fits to the positions ( wavelength in  versus the row number of ccd along the slit ) of emission lines on the wavelength - calibrated and sky - subtracted 2-d frame , and then extracted the 1-d spectrum by averaging a number of pixels in the direction of slit ( about 20 pixels with the target pn in the center ) along the track of the polynomial fit . although residuals from sky subtraction are present in the 2-d image , they are only the strongest far away from the target pn and negligible in the region close by , as seen in figures[pn1_2d ] and [ pn3_2d ] . thus measurements of the [ o  iii ] @xmath04363 line are not much affected .",
    "the dispersion direction of the red spectra is well perpendicular to the slit , and we averaged the ccd rows along the slit directly to get 1-d spectra .",
    "the spectra of the two standards ( lds749b and hz2 ) were used to derive the response curves of the blue and red channels for dichroic d48 .",
    "the efficiency is very low above 4700 in the blue channel and below 4800 in the red .",
    "the extinction - corrected 1-d blue spectra has not enough quality above 4700 as seen in figure[pne_blue ] , and the h@xmath25 line can not be used to join the blue and red spectra as expected .",
    "given the relatively low efficiency near 4800 on the red ccd , we used the h@xmath1 line instead of h@xmath25 to normalize line fluxes such that @xmath27(h@xmath1 ) = 285 .",
    "for the blue spectra , all line fluxes were scaled such that @xmath27(h@xmath26 ) = 47 .",
    "the normalization is based on the theoretical h  i line ratios and the assumption that @xmath27(h@xmath25 ) = 100 .",
    "the logarithmic extinction parameter at h@xmath25 , @xmath32(h@xmath25 ) , was derived for the three m31 pne by comparing the observed h  i balmer line ratio , @xmath27(h@xmath26)/@xmath27(h@xmath33 ) , with the predicted case  b value . that yields a @xmath32(h@xmath25 ) value of 0.43 , 0.51 and 0.54 for pn1 , pn2 and pn3 , respectively .",
    "the h  i @xmath03889 ( @xmath34 = 28 ) and @xmath03970 ( @xmath34 = 27 ) lines were not used for extinction correction because the former line is blended with he  i @xmath03888 ( 2s@xmath35s  3p@xmath35p@xmath3 ) and the latter is blended with the [ ne  iii ] @xmath03967 ( 2p@xmath36  @xmath37p@xmath38 ",
    "@xmath39d@xmath40 ) line .",
    "the observed line fluxes were dereddened by    @xmath41    where @xmath42 is the extinction curve ( relative to the @xmath43 value at h@xmath25 ) adopted from @xcite with a total - to - selective extinction ratio @xmath44 = 3.1 .",
    "the method of extinction correction described above assumes that the galactic foreground extinction is negligible compared to the local extinction in m31 . in order to assess",
    "how important the galactic foreground extinction can be to the line fluxes , we carried out another reddening correction procedure : first correct for the mw foreground extinction , and then correct for the local extinction .",
    "the foreground reddening @xmath45(@xmath46 ) toward m31 is 0.062 , which was adopted from @xcite who conducted an all - sky survey of infrared dust emission and used this to calculate the reddening @xmath45(@xmath46 ) across the sky to within an uncertainty of @xmath216 per cent .",
    "after the mw foreground extinction toward m31 had been corrected for , we used the h  i @xmath27(h@xmath1)/@xmath27(h@xmath25 ) ratio to corrected for the local extinction .",
    "the derived logarithmic extinction parameter @xmath32(h@xmath25 ) of pn1 , pn2 and pn3 are 0.30 , 0.31 and 0.45 , respectively .",
    "the extinction - corrected line fluxes based on the above two methods differ by @xmath210 per cent .",
    "since correction for the mw foreground extinction may introduce extra uncertainties and that so far most observations of the m31 nebulae ( pne and h  ii regions ) only corrected for extinction once ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) using a certain extinction law , we adopted the first set of the extinction parameters in our data analysis ( table[lines ] ) .",
    "if the same extinction law ( e.g. @xcite ) is used , we would expect that the mw and m31 extinctions could be `` packed '' in to a single @xmath32(h@xmath25 ) , which is equivalent to the first method .",
    "the extinction - corrected relative line intensities of the three pne are presented in table[lines ] . as mentioned in section[part2:c ] ,",
    "the h@xmath26 line was used for flux normalization of the blue data and h@xmath1 was used for the red . here the balmer line ratios @xmath27(h@xmath26)/@xmath27(h@xmath25 ) and @xmath27(h@xmath1)/@xmath27(h@xmath25 ) were adopted from the case  b theoretical calculations .",
    "the assumed electron temperature and density are valid because the h  i balmer line ratios are mostly insensitive to these two physical quantities .",
    "continua were not clearly detected in the spectra due to faintness of the objects .",
    "thus the integrated line fluxes were directly obtained from gaussian profile fits . as an example , figure[fits ] shows gaussian profile fits to the [ o  ii ] and [ o  iii ] lines detected in the blue spectra of the three pne . uncertainties in line intensities were estimated from direct integration and the gaussian profile fitting of the profile of each emission line .",
    "pn3 has the relatively higher s / n in the blue spectra among the three pne .",
    "for example , the s / n ratio of the h@xmath26 @xmath04340 line in the blue spectrum of pn3 is 23.4 , while those ratios of of pn1 and pn2 are 9.8 and 9.5 , respectively .",
    "differences in data quality of the blue spectra of the three pne can be seen in figure[pne_blue ] .",

    "however , the [ o  iii ] @xmath04363 line was not detected in the blue spectrum of pn2 ( figures[pn2_2d ] and [ fits ] ) , which has a medium radial velocity ( @xmath1644.4km / s ) among the three objects , probably due to the relatively low s / n ratios .",
    "the [ o  iii ] @xmath04363 line was detected in pn1 ( figures[pn1_2d ] and [ fits ] ) , which has the lowest radial velocity ( @xmath1619.6km / s ) , with a s / n ratio of 5.3 .",

    "it can be seen from figure[gradient ] that the oxygen abundances of the m31 disk pne observed by @xcite are generrally higher than those of @xcite . however , the radial distribution of the sample of @xcite is more restricted .",
    "in our sample , pn3 has a higher oxygen abundance than the m31 disk pne at similar galactocentric distances .",

    "if the orbital model of @xcite is correct , i.e. the northern spur of m31 is connected to the southern stream , our observations of pn3 seem to be in line with the postulation that the northern spur substructure is composed of the tidal debris of the m31 s satellite galaxies .",
    "the origin of northern spur is still largely unclear , although large - area photometric observations of m31 had been carried out more than 10 years ago .",
    "previous studies of the substructure in m31 have revealed that northern spur is metal - rich .",

    "quantitative spectroscopy are needed to confirm that nature .",
    "@xcite was among the first to formally propose the possible origin of northern spur , i.e. it might be associated with the southern stream , although that had been inferred by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "using the kinematic information of pne in the disk of m31 and based on the studies of @xcite and @xcite , @xcite constructed an orbit model of the stellar stream that connects the northern spur to the southern stream . in this model",
    ", the area of the northern spur encompasses the turning point of the orbit which is strongly warped near the center of m31 ( see figure@xmath76 of @xcite ; see also figure[orbit ] in this paper which is constructed based on figure2 of @xcite , with permission of the authors ) . judging from the projected position and kinematics of m32",
    ", @xcite hypothesized that this satellite might be a parent of the stream , although the exact position of m32 with respect to m31 is still an open question .",
    "figure[orbit ] shows this orbit in the @xmath72-@xmath73 coordinate system in an m31-based reference frame , where @xmath72 lies along the major axis of m31 and increases toward the south - west , and @xmath73 lies along the minor axis and increases toward the north - west .",
    "both coordinates are calculated following the geometric transformations of @xcite .",
    "also presented in figure[orbit ] is the projection of this orbit in the line - of - sight velocity with respect to to m31 , @xmath77 , versus distance along the major and minor axes .",
    "spatial and kinematic distribution of the m31 pne observed by @xcite are presented along with the orbit .",
    "pne in the region of northern spur identified by ( * ? ? ?",

    "the three northern spur pne studied in the current paper are also highlighted . in the lower panel of figure[orbit ]",
    "( i.e. @xmath77 versus @xmath72 ) , dispersion in the line - of - sight velocities of the northern spur pne with respect to the projected orbit is relatively large , indicating the orbit in this section might be of large uncertainty . that is expected because the orbit model of @xcite is based on a limited number of pne ( @xmath220 ) and relatively simple assumptions .",
    "considering the fact that pn3 in our sample has relatively higher oxygen abundance than the m31 disk sample at similar galactocentric distances ( figure[gradient ] ) , our observations seem to be in line with the postulation of @xcite . also noticeable in figure[orbit ] ( also figure@xmath78 in @xcite ) is that the 20 pne ( two of them might be the northern spur candidates , as indicated by @xcite ) associated with the southern stream",
    "generally well fit the orbit model .",
    "future spectroscopy of these pne will help to confirm their true nature .",
    "the kinematics of pne in the northern spur region are indistinguishable from those of the disk , and @xcite suggests that this substructure is related to the disk , perhaps indicative of a warp .",
    "however , deep spectroscopy of more pne in this region is definitely needed so that they can be chemically distinguished from those in the disk .",
    "figure[orbit ] here is to visually demonstrate the position of the northern spur pne relative to the model orbit of @xcite . as to the origin of",
    "the northern spur , observations of more pne therein and the pne in the southern stream may help to confirm whether these two substructures linked .",
    "observations of the pne m32 may also help to understand the interaction between m32 and m32 and assess whether the northern spur and southern stream both originate from m32 .",
    "currently , observations of pne in m32 are scarce @xcite and results inconclusive .",
    "more high - quality spectroscopic observations are preferred .",
    "we present deep spectroscopy of three pne in the northern spur of m31 using dbsp on the 5.1 m hale telescope at the palomar observatory .",
    "the sample is selected from @xcite .",
    "this is the first chemical study of pne in this substructure .",
    "the [ o  iii ] @xmath04363 auroral line is detected in the spectra of two objects after meticulous work on the subtraction of sky background .",
    "electron temperatures were determined for two pne .",
    "ionic abundances of heavy elements were derived from the [ n  ii ] , [ o  iii ] , [ ne  iii ] , [ s  ii ] and [ ar  iii ] cels detected in the spectra .",
    "the n / h , o / h , ne / h , s / h and ar / h elemental abundances were estimated .",
    "correlations between oxygen and @xmath79-element abundance ratios were studied , using our sample and other m31 pne from the literature .",
    "one of the three northern spur pne has relatively higher oxygen abundance than both the m31 disk pne at similar galactocentric distances and the average abundance of the m31 disk sample .",
    "our study is thus seems to be in line with the postulation that the northern spur might be connected to the southern stream and are metal - enriched .",
    "more observations of pne at different substructures , in combination with the kinematic information , are needed to assess the properties of those substructures and further constrain the possible origins of the northern spur .",

    "<S> the samples are selected from the observations of merrett et al . our purpose is to investigate formation of the substructures of m31 using pne as a tracer of chemical abundances . </S>",
    "<S> the [ o  iii ] @xmath04363 line is detected in the spectra of two objects , enabling temperature determinations . </S>",
    "<S> ionic abundances are derived from the observed collisionally excited lines , and elemental abundances of nitrogen , oxygen , and neon as well as sulphur and argon are estimated . </S>",
    "<S> correlations between oxygen and @xmath1-element abundance ratios are studied , using our sample and the m31 disk and bulge pne from the literature . in one of the three pne </S>",
    "<S> , we observed relatively higher oxygen abundance compared to the disk sample in m31 at similar galactocentric distances . </S>",
    "<S> the results of at least one of the three northern spur pne might be in line with the proposed possible origin of the northern spur substructure of m31 , i.e. the northern spur is connected to the southern stream and both substructures comprise the tidal debris of the satellite galaxies of m31 . </S>"
