    "the introduction of a space - time lattice for quantum field theories serves several purposes .",
    "it provides a regularization for the renormalization scheme ; it allows us to apply efficient computational methods to perform the functional integrals ; it may be considered a mere approximation scheme for the problem in the continuum . among the four - dimensional ( 4d ) gauge field theories with lie groups",
    "the one with @xmath7 symmetry at first sight appears to be the simplest to test this approach .",
    "it is also of considerable interest as it has many features in common with qcd , like a confining strong coupling phase , topological excitations and gauge - balls .",
    "in addition it shows a phase transition ( pt ) to a phase with weak coupling signature , a massless photon and long range interaction .",
    "in fact it has been the first lattice gauge model with continuous gauge group to be studied by the computational methods that became available in the 80 s @xcite .    below ( in subsect . [ subsectionsituation ] )",
    "we will discuss the various results obtained since .",
    "however , in summary we may say that up to now there is no definite answer to the critical properties of its pt . in most simulations",
    "a two - state signal at the pt indicated a @xmath8 order transition . on the other hand , the critical behavior according to such",
    "a transition has not been confirmed in thorough finite - size scaling ( fss ) studies .",
    "the problem persisted when the original wilson action containing only @xmath9 was extended to include the double charge coupling @xmath10 here @xmath11 is the plaquette angle , i.e. the argument of the product of @xmath7 link variables around a plaquette @xmath12 .",
    "it was conjectured , that the @xmath8 order pt changes into a @xmath13 order one at a tricritical point ( tcp ) at small negative values of @xmath1 , but that was never confirmed in actual simulations at @xmath14 .",
    "if there is indeed a @xmath13 order transition , its properties have not been determined up today .",
    "on the other hand , both computational and data analysis techniques have progressed .",
    "this provides us with the possibility to perform a thorough fss study of this model in a new context .",
    "practically all other studies have dealt with the standard periodic boundary conditions , i.e. hypertorus topology for the lattices .",
    "it has however been realized that there are nonlocal excitations in the system  closed monopole loops  that may extend over the whole lattice .",
    "therefore the essentially local updating algorithms used for gauge theories , together with the boundary conditions , may affect thermalization properties .",
    "one expects , that in the thermodynamic limit the `` continuum '' properties of the system are independent of the global topology of the system , if this becomes locally flat . for these reasons",
    "it was suggested to simulate the model on lattices with spherelike topology @xcite , amounting to modified boundary conditions , such that closed loops are always homotopically equivalent to points .",
    "the spherelike topology allows the monopoles more freedom in their dynamics without changing the action .",
    "one generally expects that the thermodynamic properties of the bulk phase ( defined by the behavior of the free energy per unit volume in the thermodynamic limit ) are not affected by contributions which grow slower than the total volume .",
    "boundary contributions are suppressed @xmath15 relative to the leading term , curvature terms at least @xmath16 , and therefore they should not change the critical exponents of the bulk phase .",
    "this does not necessarily hold for the ground state .",
    "e.g. at phase transitions of @xmath8 order the phase mixture may be different , depending on boundaries or even one individual spin , or due to an overall external field vanishing @xmath17 .",
    "a similar influence may come from the curvature , even if thinned out over the volume in @xmath16 .",
    "however , if the manifold becomes locally flat in the thermodynamic limit the systems universal _",
    "critical _ properties should be independent of the global topological structure .",
    "otherwise we could hardly assume that we can do reliable physics on earth without definite knowledge about the topological details of the universe .",
    "whereas in the original study @xcite the surface of a 5d cube was used , we here choose a discretization of the sphere , where the curvature is distributed more homogeneously over the lattice . although the system is nonhomogeneous on the scale of the lattice constant , it is homogeneous and isotropic on larger scales .",
    "as will be demonstrated here , in this 4d system with the topology of the surface of a 5d sphere we find no two - state signal on lattices with up to almost 20@xmath18 points .",
    "of course we can not exclude the possibility , that a two - state signal reappears for even larger lattices .",
    "however , our fss analysis leads to consistent results for a pt of @xmath13 order for @xmath19 .    the best measurement of the correlation length critical exponent @xmath3 by means of the fss behavior of the fisher zero gives @xmath20 .",
    "less precise fss analyses of several other bulk observables are consistent with @xmath3 values in the interval @xmath21 . as we argue in @xcite , due to rigorous dual relationships our results imply that also the coulomb gas of monopole loops@xcite and the noncompact u(1 ) higgs model at large negative squared bare mass ( frozen superconductor)@xcite have a continuum limit described by the same non - gaussian fixed point .",
    "some further related models are discussed in @xcite .",
    "the first order signal persists  also for the discussed spherelike geometries  at values @xmath22 . since scaling",
    "may be garbled close to tcps we concentrated on negative values of the double charge coupling @xmath1 in our study .",
    "scaling and fss is expected to improve at larger distance from the @xmath8 order part of the pt line .",
    "nevertheless , at @xmath23 the two - state signal is still absent and the scaling behavior is consistent with that found at @xmath24 .    let us add a remark on the extended action considered .",
    "some time ago it was pointed out @xcite , that , although the wilson- and the heat kernel ( villain ) action do have reflection positivity , some actions do not .",
    "positivity is a sufficient , but not a necessary condition for unitarity ; it guarantees the existence of a positive definite scalar product and the spectral condition , one of the formal conditions for the existence of a continuum limit field theory @xcite .",
    "the actions with the parameter values @xmath25 considered here are not reflection positive .",
    "they share this property with other actions like e.g. the ( symanzik ) improved actions .",
    "on the other hand , if reflection positivity holds on a part of a critical surface that is in the domain of attraction of a fixed point of some renormalization group transformation , we expect that it should be fulfilled everywhere in that domain .",
    "unitarity violating states like ghosts should then decouple at large scale .",
    "we therefore find it justified to study the action near candidates for critical points even outside the region @xmath26 , where reflection positivity is respected on the scale of the lattice spacing .",
    "unitarity at @xmath24 is also suggested by the observation that the regions with @xmath24 and @xmath27 are connected by the rg flows @xcite .    following a brief review of the situation in the u(1 )",
    "pure gauge model we then introduce the spherical lattice in sect .",
    "[ sectionlatticegeometry ] .",
    "( further technical details are given in the appendix . ) in sect .",
    "[ sectionmethods ] we present the monte carlo simulation and discuss the observables in some detail , including the expected fss behavior .",
    "the results and their analysis are summarized in sect .",
    "[ sectionresults ] , followed by our conclusions .",
    "u(1 ) is the most elementary lie group that can be used to construct a quantum gauge field theory . yet ,",
    "when formulated on a lattice , the pure u(1 ) gauge theory turned out unexpectedly to be one of the most intriguing and less understood quantum gauge models .",
    "the awareness of this fact has developed with an accumulation of the numerical experience . in this section",
    "we give a brief description of this historical development .",
    "we apologize for quoting only a subjectively chosen part of a much larger number of valuable papers .    since the introduction of lattice gauge theories by wilson @xcite , the pure compact u(1 ) theory has been of interest as a theory with a rigorously established @xcite pt between the confinement and the free charge ( coulomb ) phases at zero temperature .",
    "one reason was the importance of topological excitations , the monopoles , for confinement , as manifested by their prominent rle in this phase transition @xcite .",
    "another purpose was to study it as a prototype example for applications of numerical methods of statistical physics in a lattice gauge theory , in particular an investigation of the continuum limit at the phase transition .",
    "however , the lesson has been that this phase transition provides no simple exercise .    in the very first numerical investigations @xcite ,",
    "restricted to @xmath23 and small lattices , a behavior consistent with a @xmath13 order phase transition at @xmath28 was observed . but",
    "this order was questioned by the subsequent observation of a two - state signal on larger lattices @xcite .",
    "such a signal could imply that the phase transition at @xmath23 is actually of weak @xmath8 order , which would prevent taking a continuum limit there .",
    "the question was , and remained to be , whether this signal may be a finite - size effect .    in the model with extended wilson action ( [ action ] )",
    "it was found @xcite that the confinement - coulomb phase transition is clearly of @xmath8 order for @xmath29 , and weakens with decreasing @xmath1 .",
    "this suggested that the order of the transition changes when @xmath1 is decreased , presumably at a tcp .",
    "the question at which value of @xmath1 this happens turned out to be very difficult .",
    "first , even at large negative @xmath1 , a two - state signal has been observed , e.g. at @xmath30 on the @xmath31 lattice @xcite .",
    "second , tcps are known to cause intricate finite - size effects @xcite , easily mocking up a false order of the phase transition .    in the hope to clarify the situation , an investigation of the strongly @xmath8 order part of the phase transition line at @xmath32",
    "was performed @xcite . there",
    "the latent heat @xmath33 can be determined reliably even on moderately large lattices .",
    "its independence on the lattice size was checked very carefully .",
    "the extrapolation of @xmath33 to zero with decreasing @xmath1 by means of the power law @xmath34 suggested that the order of the transition changes at the tcp with @xmath35 , implying a @xmath8 order pt at @xmath36 .",
    "this extrapolation procedure is an attempt to control finite - size effects , but it uses the assumption that the power law behavior ( [ powerlaw ] ) , which the data in the investigated region @xmath37 are consistent with , indeed holds throughout the whole interval between @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "this assumption has remained unverified .",
    "another possible uncertainty in @xcite was the determination of @xmath33 at a strong @xmath40 order transition , without the more advanced methods of investigation of such transitions @xcite .",
    "monte carlo rg ( mcrg ) studies @xcite did not confirm this position of the tcp at negative @xmath1 .",
    "of course , also the mcrg approach suffers from ambiguities due to a small number of rg steps and a restricted number of couplings considered .",
    "therefore also these studies remained inconclusive about the order of the transition around @xmath23 in the thermodynamic limit ( although they all observed clear two - state signals ) .    in spite of this ,",
    "numerous attempts to determine the critical exponent @xmath3 provided roughly consistent values in the range @xmath41 .",
    "these studies used various methods : the analytic calculations @xcite , the fss analysis @xcite , the scaling of the string tension @xcite , and the mcrg method @xcite .",
    "three actions : wilson , extended wilson , and villain  type have been used .",
    "this suggested that the pure compact u(1 ) lattice theory might have an interesting continuum limit at the confinement - coulomb pt , pondered , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "however , the two - state signal , observed on finite lattices even for @xmath24 @xcite as well as for the villain action @xcite , hindered the investigations of this possibility .",
    "even if this signal is only a finite - size effect and the transition in the infinite volume limit is genuinely of @xmath13 order , it represents a serious impediment for a precise fss analysis or mcrg studies . because of this the investigation of the pure compact u(1 ) gauge theory lost its momentum .",
    "until now there is no established @xmath13 order pt with an undisputed determination of critical indices in this model .",
    "all the above mentioned numerical work has been performed on 4d toroidal lattices . recently , following earlier suggestions @xcite , two of the present authors speculated that the two - state signal at @xmath2 may be related to monopole loops winding around the toroidal lattice , and trapped in simulations with local update algorithms @xcite .",
    "they used the 4d surface of a 5d cubic lattice instead of the torus , and observed that at @xmath23 the two - state signal vanishes on lattices of all investigated sizes .    choosing a spherelike topology",
    "provides a way to allow the monopoles more freedom in their dynamics without affecting them locally by changing the action .",
    "we consider this as preferable to adding terms to the action that forbid or restrict the occurrence of monopoles produces @xmath42 contributions to the total free energy and thus changes the bulk properties of the system @xcite . in that case one",
    "explores the phase diagram in different regions of the space of couplings and the position of the phase transition in @xmath0 moves to different values , depending on the extra couplings .",
    "none of these studies has led to phase transitions of @xmath13 order , though .    however , the cause for the two - state signal on the toroidal lattice , and of its vanishing on a lattice with the topology of a sphere , is not yet fully understood .",
    "possibly the trivial @xmath8 homotopy group of such a lattice allows a smooth vanishing of winding monopole loops in simulations .",
    "but some other recent results do not seem to support this interpretation @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , for a study of the continuum limit on lattices with the topology of a sphere , a complete understanding of the dynamics of the two - state signal on a torus is not really necessary .",
    "what is required is a construction of a spherelike lattice which is homogeneous , in order to avoid the possibly related problems with the fss analysis , encountered in @xcite . achieving that in this paper , we hope to give a new momentum to the investigation of the confinement - coulomb phase transition in the pure compact u(1 ) gauge theory on the lattice .",
    "a construction of the continuum limit appears now to be feasible .",
    "in an attempt to formulate the theory without modification of the locally defined plaquette action and without forbidding or hindering the dynamic evolution of monopole loops , the lattice topology was modified .",
    "the usual periodic ( or antiperiodic ) boundary conditions correspond to the topology of a 4d torus @xmath43 with the first homotopy group @xmath44 .",
    "closed loops ( or networks of loops ) can not necessarily be contracted to a point and the corresponding ground state may be classified accordingly .",
    "the original motivation to divert from this lattice structure was to study the possible influence of this property on the dynamics of the phase transition .",
    "in @xcite it was therefore suggested to simulate and study the model on a lattice with spherelike topology , in particular on the surface sh[n ] of a 5d hypercubic lattice of size @xmath45 .",
    "this lattice may be best visualized in analogy to the 2d surface of a 3d cubic lattice .",
    "it may also be considered as a collection of 10 hypercubic lattices of size @xmath46 , glued together at their boundaries .",
    "this implies that one can expect the same critical coupling in the thermodynamic limit as for the usual torus .",
    "this was indeed verified in the monte carlo calculations @xcite .",
    "details and parameters of the geometry are listed in the appendix .",
    "the so - defined lattice is locally flat , except at certain plaquettes ( ( d-2)-dimensional elements ) , where the curvature is concentrated , a well - known property of regge skeletons .",
    "the unusual features include plaquettes bordering only three 3d cubes ( instead of the usual 4 ) , links bordering less than 6 plaquettes and sites with less than 8 links .",
    "these curvaturelike contributions as we might call them in the absence of a strict theory in 4d are suppressed @xmath47 relative to the leading terms in the action .    in an attempt to distribute these local inhomogeneities more uniformly over the lattice we introduced the `` almost smooth '' spherical lattice s[n ] . in the construction",
    "we project sites , links and plaquettes of sh[n ] ( or its dual sh[n ] ) onto the surface of a concentric 4d sphere and introduce weight factors similar to those used by @xcite in their study of random triangulated lattices , @xmath48 \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\mbox{with } \\quad w_p = { a_p ' \\over a_p } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath49 and @xmath50 denote the areas of the corresponding plaquette and its dual , respectively , of the projected lattice .",
    "as discussed in @xcite in the situation of triangulated random lattices , one has to distribute the total integration volume over all contributions to the action , i.e. the plaquette terms in our case .",
    "this may be done with the help of the dual lattice , where to each site , link or plaquette there is an associated dual 4d cube , 3d cube or plaquette .",
    "the dual lattice sites in our situation are constructed from the barycenters of the 4d cubes that have been projected to the sphere @xmath51 , followed by an adjusting projection of these points to the sphere .",
    "further reasoning according to @xcite leads to the weight factors @xmath52 in ( [ actionweight ] ) .",
    "this choice is not unique , but reproduces the usual continuum action @xmath53 in the naive continuum limit @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) and is thus homogeneous in this limit .",
    "we study the system at finite @xmath0 ; there slight distortions from the regular spherical surface are possible .",
    "the value of @xmath56 might be modified due to the weight factors and thus does not necessarily agree with that of the torus or sh .    technically we have to introduce some approximations . usually the plaquettes  constructed via the projection of the sites to the sphere  will not be flat .",
    "plaquette areas are therefore determined from the sum of two triangles . also for this reason",
    "the curvature in this formulation will not be perfectly uniformly distributed . in order to achieve this , we would have to rely on a triangulated lattice .",
    "this would imply a significant change of the action , which we wanted to avoid .",
    "on the other hand we expect these effects to become irrelevant in a situation with a large correlation length .",
    "the consistency of the found fss behavior justifies these simplifications .",
    "the connectivity properties of sh and @xmath57 are identical . in the computer programs the geometry",
    "is implemented with tables and the weight factors @xmath52 are precalculated . during the development of the program and in the early stages of the analysis we also determined the monopole positions ( on the dual lattice ) and reproduced them graphically .",
    "we observed the expected properties :    * the monopole loops were always closed ; * the smallest loops had length 3 ( corner plaquettes on the dual lattice ) ; * they fluctuated freely , appearing and disappearing without noticeable correlation with positions close to corners .",
    ".effective volumes for the studied lattices sh[n ] .",
    "we also give the value of @xmath58 which would give the base length for a hypertorus lattice with the same volume .",
    "[ table1 ] [ cols=\">,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]      the number of plaquettes with just three 3d cubes ( as well as the corresponding numbers for links and sites ) is suppressed relative to the leading terms in @xmath47 .",
    "this is typical for contributions due to curvature .",
    "we may say that the lattice becomes locally flat with @xmath47 .",
    "contrary to the usual hypercubic torus this lattice is not self - dual .",
    "possible monopole loops live on the dual lattice @xmath61 , which does have a few ( @xmath62 ) plaquettes of 3 links in addition to the usual ones .",
    "the lattice sh  in analogy to the 2d situation  may be imagined as an ensemble of 10 hypercubic lattices , glued together at their boundaries .",
