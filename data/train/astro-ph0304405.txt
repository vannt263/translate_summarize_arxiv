    "active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are powerful emitters in all wavebands .",
    "emission processes from different parts of the spectrum in many cases appear to be linked .",
    "for example , the electrons in the jet which produce the synchrotron radiation may at the same time upscatter photons into the x - ray and gamma - ray regime via the inverse compton ( ic ) process ( see for example the analysis by bloom & marscher 1996 ) . in order to unravel the contribution from each emission process , the shape of each distinct emission component needs to be determined , and the associated physical parameters measured .",
    "the ic emission is produced by seed photons ( internal , from the jet itself , or external , from the accretion disc or the emission - line clouds ) which are upscattered by the electrons ( or other relativistic particles ) in the jet .",
    "the energy of the photons increases by a factor of @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the lorentz factor of the relativistic particle .",
    "consequently , there are two crucial factors that determine the nature of the ic emission : the maximum energy of the jet electrons , which determines the turnover frequency of the synchrotron component ; and the typical energy of the seed photons , which is governed by the relative strengths of the thermal and non - thermal components .",
    "the optical regime is where these components are both energetically important , and so a good understanding of the emission at optical frequencies is crucial for accurate modelling of the high - energy emission .",
    "before comptel was shut down in june 2000 , this telescope detected nine blazars in the range 0.75  30 mev which were also detected by egret in the gamma - ray regime @xmath6 100 mev ( schnfelder 2000 ; collmar 2001 ) .",
    "for many of the sources in this sample , the data coverage in the optical / near infrared ( nir ) region is very poor . to better understand this important part of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , six blazars from the comptel sample , chosen subject to visibility during an observation period from 27 august to 2 september 2001 ,",
    "were observed in the photometric bands @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 .",
    "basic information for this sample is shown in table  [ tab - sample ] .",
    "we note that the redshift for pks1622@xmath2297 ( @xmath14 ) is taken from the parkes catalogue ( wright & otrupcek 1990 , hereafter pkscat90 ) , wherein no reference is given .",
    "no other determination of its redshift has been made in the literature , and , while we use this value herein , it should be regarded as potentially suspect .",
    ".sample description .",
    "e@xmath15 values are the galactic extinction values from schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab - fit_results ]    we find that the fitted power laws can be separated into two groups .",
    "three sources  pks0506@xmath2612 , pks0528@xmath3134 , and pks1622@xmath2297are quite blue ( although pks0506@xmath2612 is a poor fit , as discussed below , and should probably not be included in this group ) .",
    "these slopes are the same as those found at the blue end of the distribution of fitted slopes for the parkes half - jansky flat - spectrum sample ( phfs ) quasars in whiting , webster , & francis ( 2001 ) .",
    "a natural interpretation of such blue slopes is that they are due to emission from the accretion disc .",
    "this would be expected for high - redshift sources such as pks0528@xmath3134 , as the observed optical emission is probing the rest - frame uv .",
    "the remaining three sources have much redder optical slopes . again comparing to the phfs sources in whiting ( 2001 ) , we find that these slopes are in the middle of the distribution , corresponding to sources with synchrotron - dominated spectra .",
    "one source had a poor fit : pks0506@xmath2612 .",
    "there is a large offset between the optical and nir points , giving what appears to be substantial spectral curvature .",
    "however , it is likely that the source has faded in the three days between the two observations  if the spectrum is a smooth continuum then a reduction in flux of @xmath16 1 mag is implied .",
    "this also implies the intrinsic spectrum is a red power law of slope @xmath17 . a similar ,",
    "albeit much weaker effect is seen in pks0528@xmath3134 , although this could also be due to the @xmath10 band data having excess emission over the power law continuum .",
    "contamination by the  emission line ( which would appear at @xmath18 ) is a likely origin of this excess .",
    "we can use data from the literature to support the interpretation of the different optical slopes .",
    "synchrotron radiation is intrinsically highly polarised , and so a significant net polarisation from a source is a good indication that the emission is dominated by synchrotron emission .",
    "impey & tapia ( 1990 ) measured polarisation for five of the sources ( excluding pks1622@xmath2297 ) , and their values are also shown in figure [ tab - fit_results ] .",
    "it can be seen that the three sources with red optical slopes are the sources that have been observed to exhibit high optical polarisations , indicating a likely synchrotron origin for the emission .",
    "all the sources we have studied here are radio - loud , flat - spectrum quasars ( fsrqs ) .",
    "we would like to know how typical these objects are compared to other fsrqs , or whether they are exceptional in some way that would explain their gamma - ray emission .",
    "we examine here two properties  the redshift and the radio luminosity  and compare it to a sample of flat - spectrum radio - loud objects . for this comparison sample",
    "we use the phfs ( drinkwater 1997 ) , a sample of southern , radio - bright , flat - spectrum objects .",
    "we also include in this discussion the comptel sources that we did not observe : pks1222@xmath3216 ( @xmath19 ) , pks1226@xmath3023 ( 3c 273 , @xmath20 ) , and pks1253@xmath2055 ( 3c 279 , @xmath21 ) .",
    "note that the latter two sources are also in the phfs .",
    "the cumulative redshift distributions for both samples are plotted in figure [ fig - comp]a .",
    "note that we have excluded from the phfs distribution the 33 objects with no known redshift .",
    "these objects include a few bl lac objects , which have no emission line from which to measure a redshift , but are mostly optically faint , meaning no suitable spectrum has been obtained .",
    "the comptel sample tends to be biased towards lower redshift values , with only one source at high redshift @xmath22 ( pks0528@xmath3134 at @xmath23 , hunter 1993 ) .",
    "this is likely to be a consequence of the sensitivity of the comptel detector , with sources at suitably high redshift not being bright enough at gamma rays for detection .",
    "we do note , however , that a kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test shows that the distributions are different only at the 90% confidence level ( the probability that they are the same is 9.9% ) .",
    "figure [ fig - comp]b shows the cumulative distributions of the radio luminosity for both samples .",
    "this is calculated from the 2.7ghz fluxes from pkscat90 ( assuming @xmath24kms@xmath25mpc@xmath25 and @xmath26 ) .",
    "we see that the comptel sources tend to have , on average , higher radio luminosities than the phfs sources ( there is a difference in average luminosity of 0.56 dex , or a factor of @xmath27 ) . again",
    ", however , a k - s test shows this is not very significant ( the probability that the distributions are different is 12.6% ) .",
    "we can , however , discuss the trends shown in the graphs .",
    "even though , as we see from the redshift distribution , the comptel sample lacks the high - redshift sources ( which one would expect to be more luminous than low - redshift sources in a flux - limited sample ) , the average radio luminosity of this sample is still greater than that of the phfs .",
    "this implies that the sample selected at gamma rays lacks sources of low radio luminosity .",
    "this is probably an indication that a certain radio luminosity is required for a source to be active at high - energy gamma rays .      in figure [ fig - seds ]",
    "we plot the multiwavelength ( radio to gamma - ray ) seds constructed from published data , as well as the new data presented herein .",
    "two epochs of radio observation are shown .",
    "one set of data ( indicated by the asterisks ) is from pkscat90 , while the second ( indicated by crosses ) is from kovalev ( 1999 ) .",
    "the latter does not include pks0208@xmath2512 and pks0506@xmath2612 .",
    "the optical / nir data ( from this paper ) have been corrected for galactic extinction .",
    "the x - ray data come from brinkmann , yuan , & siebert ( 1997 ) .",
    "the ` bowtie ' represents the twin constraints given by the errors on the total 0.12.4kev flux and the spectral slope .",
    "( note that the constraints on the slope for pks1622@xmath2297 are rather poor . )",
    "the comptel data , taken from schnfelder ( 2000 ) , are indicated by the four points between @xmath28hz and @xmath29hz .",
    "the horizontal error bars indicate the energy range of each bin , while the vertical error bars indicate the flux error .",
    "upper limits ( @xmath30 ) are indicated by arrows .",
    "the final point is the egret datum from the third egret catalog ( hartman 1999 ) , using their approximation to generate a 400mev flux density by multiplying the catalogued flux by 1.7 .",
    "note that the observations presented here are not simultaneous .",
    "the seds provide an interesting glimpse of the range of different spectral shapes present in radio - loud quasars .",
    "the optically - red sources , particularly pks0208@xmath2512 and pks2251@xmath3158 , show optical  nir seds that can quite easily be connected to the radio data , as would be expected if both regimes are dominated by synchrotron emission from the relativistic jet .    for other sources , however , it is less obvious what , if any , connection exists between these two regimes .",
    "for instance , the @xmath31 band flux of pks1622@xmath2297 is approximately equal ( on a @xmath32 scale ) to the 20ghz flux from kovalev ( 1999 ) , while the spectral index in the two regimes is approximately the same .",
    "this , however , should not be surprising if we attribute the optical emission to the accretion disc , as it will then not be the same component as the radio emission .",
    "in such a picture , the synchrotron emission from the jet has turned over somewhere in the infrared , leaving the accretion disc emission to dominate the optical .",
    "note that the flux level at radio frequencies is approximately equal for all sources , whereas the redder sources tend to be brighter in the optical / nir , indicating the presence of an additional emission component .",
    "clearly , while the non - thermal processes ( synchrotron and ic ) are undoubtedly important for the radio and high - energy emission , the optical regime is not always going to be dominated by them .",
    "this was shown in the detailed study of the optical / nir properties of radio - loud quasars by whiting ( 2001 ) , which found that a large fraction of sources showed no evidence for non - thermal synchrotron emission at optical wavelengths .",
    "the observations of strong emission - line spectra and low polarisation in the optical for the blue objects in this sample also back this up .",
    "this raises an important issue when it comes to modelling the multiwavelength seds of such objects .",
    "detailed models do exist in the literature , and are used with good effect to model the high - energy emission ( x - rays through gamma rays ) .",
    "see , for instance , mukherjee ( 1999 ) for modelling of the multiwavelength spectra of pks0528@xmath3134 .",
    "however , many of these models do not take the lower - energy ( radio through optical ) data fully into account . as an example",
    ", we refer the reader to figures 8 and 9 of mukherjee ( 1999 ) , where the model flux in the optical goes in the opposite direction to the data .",
    "this seems to be due to the fitted models not fully taking into account the presence of significant emission from the accretion disc .",
    "this is an important issue , since if the thermal accretion disc emission is dominating the optical , the synchrotron emission in that frequency range is much less than previously assumed .",
    "this will then affect the derived values for the lorentz factors , which affect the generation of the gamma rays via the ic process .",
    "the photon density at the jet of the seed photons is another key parameter for calculating the ic luminosity . for",
    "a given observed total optical flux , this parameter will be different for synchrotron - dominated and thermally - dominated spectra , and its spectral shape will differ as well .",
    "this will alter the predicted shape of the ic emission .",
    "it can be seen , therefore , that a good understanding of the makeup of the optical emission is crucial for accurate modelling of the high - energy emission .",
    "this is something that needs to be considered for future multiwavelength campaigns involving high - energy observations and subsequent modelling , particularly with the advent of new gamma - ray telescopes such as integral and glast .",
    "we have observed six comptel - detected quasars at optical and nir wavelengths , and we present photometry in seven wavebands , corrected for galactic extinction .",
    "we find large differences in the optical properties between the sources .",
    "two of the sources have intrinsically blue optical seds , and are likely to be dominated by thermal emission from an accretion disc .",
    "a further three have much redder optical slopes , and are more likely to be dominated in the optical by non - thermal synchrotron emission from the relativistic jet .",
    "this identification of accretion disc emission in some gamma - ray sources has important implications for the sources broad - band modelling .",
    "it implies both that the thermal emission is stronger and the non - thermal emission weaker in the optical regime than previously considered , indicating that broad - band models used to explain the high - energy emission will need to be revisited , particularly as far as the optical regime is concerned .",
    "the authors would like to thank a.  melatos for some very helpful discussions . we also want to thank the mssso tac for granting us time for the observations at the 40 in and 2.3 m telescopes at the sso .",
    "this research has made use of the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administration .",
