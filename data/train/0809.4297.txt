    ", an optimal randomized test @xmath6 always exists and can be calculated explicitly in terms of a reference probability measure @xmath7 , with respect to which both measures are absolutely continuous ( for instance , @xmath8 ) .",
    "this test has the randomized 01 structure @xmath9 which involves the likelihood ratio @xmath10 of the densities of the null and the alternative hypotheses , the quantile @xmath11 and the number @xmath12 $ ] which enforces the significance - level requirement without slackness , that is , @xmath13 = \\alpha $ ] .",
    "the  problem becomes considerably more involved when the hypotheses are composite , that is , when one has to discriminate between two entire _ families of probability measures ; _ likelihood ratios of mixed strategies then have to be considered .",

    "most of these papers deal with lagrange duality ; they prove that the typical 01 structure of ( [ 01 ] ) is sufficient for optimality and that it is both necessary and sufficient if a dual solution exists .",
    "an important question then is to decide when a dual solution will exist and to describe it when it does .",

    "one advantage of this approach is that as soon as one can prove the validity of strong duality , the existence of a dual solution follows .",
