    "the rural - urban migration is a very important phenomenon which occurs in developing economies . in our previous work ,",
    "see ref . , we analyzed such a phenomenon using an agent - based computational model , considering the rural - urban migration as a discrete choice problem with social interaction.@xcite the migratory decision was modelled taking into account the pressure caused by the different earnings between rural and urban sectors and the neighborhood influence .",
    "the influence caused by neighbors was modelled like in the ising model in a two - dimensional lattice in the presence of an external field .",
    "simulations in this model show some emergent properties which are consistent with historical data of developing countries , namely : a transitional dynamics characterized by increasing of population fraction living at urban area and _ per capita _ income , followed by equalization of expected wages between rural and urban sectors ( harris - todaro equilibrium condition ) and urban concentration . in this paper we extend this analysis to study the behavior toward equilibrium and its properties in @xmath4-dimensional lattices , @xmath5 , instead of @xmath0 in ref . .",
    "in this section we present the general equilibrium structure of a two - sector less developed economy set in ref . to study the rural - urban migration process.@xcite we also review the formalization of the social interaction modelled by an ising like model to as proposed in ref .",
    "these results will be taken to carry out the generalizations of subsection [ transitionalnd ] .",
    "there are two productive sectors considered : urban and rural .",
    "the urban sector is formed by firms which are specialized in the production of manufacturated goods whereas the rural sector is formed by farms which produce agricultural goods .",
    "the production of the manufacturing sector is given by@xcite    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the amount of workers of the urban sector .",
    "@xmath8 and @xmath9 are parametric constants .",
    "the equilibrium wage of this sector is @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a parametric constant .",
    "the aggregated production of the rural sector is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the total number of workers of the economic system .",
    "@xmath14 and @xmath15 are parametric constants .",
    "the equilibrium wage is @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a parametric constant .",
    "the terms of trade between these sectors @xcite is measured by the price @xmath18 :    @xmath19    where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are parametric constants .    given the equilibrium urban unemployment rate , @xmath22 , as determined in ref .",
    ", using eqs .",
    "( [ ym ] ) and ( [ wm ] ) one can calculate the state of the urban sector . in a similar manner ,",
    "the rural sector has its state calculated by using eqs .",
    "( [ ya ] ) , ( [ wa ] ) and ( [ p ] ) .",
    "the complete deduction of the equations of state of both sectors are done in ref . .",
    "typical values for parameters mentioned above are @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the migration process was modelled by an agent - based computational model .",
    "the decision of migrating or not is considered taking into account the difference of expected wages between the sectors , called deterministic private utility , and the influence that individuals suffer by the group they are included in , called deterministic social utility.@xcite as mentioned before , only discrete choices are allowed , so each worker has it state defined by @xmath33 , where @xmath34 represents a rural worker and @xmath35 represents an urban worker .",
    "as mentioned above , during the decision process each worker takes into account explicit and observable incentives and the influence of their social neighborhood .",
    "then , the total ( private and social ) utility is given by    @xmath36\\sigma_i + j\\sum_{j\\in n_i}\\sigma_i\\sigma_j , \\label{hi}\\ ] ]    where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are parametric constants .",
    "the probability that each workers reviews his / her sectorial decision is given by the activity @xmath39 defined in ref . .",
    "this parameter guarantees that only a fraction of the total population review their decision becoming potential migrants .",
    "the probability that a potential migrant becomes an actual migrant is given by a cumulative distribution :    @xmath40    where @xmath41 is a parametric constant which measures the heterogeneity of agents .",
    "the probability that a worker @xmath42 migrates or not depends on the probability calculated in eq .",
    "( [ pri ] ) .",
    "then , the higher the value of the total utility , eq .",
    "( [ hi ] ) , the higher the probability that the worker does not change his / her sectorial decision .",
    "in our previous work we analyzed the transitional dynamics of the rural - urban migration in a two - dimensional lattice .",
    "the determination of the macrostate of the system in each time step can be done by using eqs .",
    "( [ ym]-[p ] ) . in this section",
    "we will briefly review some of these results .",
    "the main variable that characterizes the migratory process is the fraction of workers allocated in the urban sector , @xmath43 , also called urban share . in fig .",
    "[ nut ] one can see the urban share as function of time .",
    "the three curves of this figure are plotted for different combination of the parameters @xmath44 and @xmath45 of eq .",
    "( [ hi ] ) .",
    "the set @xmath46 , @xmath47 plotted in fig .",
    "[ nut ] means that agents review their sectorial position taking into account only the deterministic private utility , ignoring the neighborhood interaction . the second case , @xmath48 , @xmath47 , both of the effects mentioned before are considered in the reviewing process . in the last case , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , only neighborhood influence in considered in the reviewing process what make this case an unrealistic one .",
    "the simulations for @xmath4-dimensional lattices were carried out placing workers in lattices of dimensions @xmath50 and @xmath3 .",
    "this dimensional change in the lattice will modify the number of nearest neighbors that each worker will have and this relation will depend on the dimension of the lattice :    @xmath51    where @xmath52 is the number of nearest neighbors and @xmath4 is the dimension of the lattice . in all simulations",
    "the initial urban share is @xmath53 , what means that @xmath54 of the workers are located in the urban sector .",
    "all others parameters of the system are the same , if not , it will be mentioned .    in fig .",
    "[ nund ] the urban share is plotted as function of time . in this figure",
    "one can see that the increasing of the dimension of the lattice will accelerate the migratory process provoking an overshooting in the urban share as observed in developing economies . on the other hand ,",
    "smaller dimension takes the system to reach equilibrium faster than higher dimension lattices . in eq .",
    "( [ neighbors ] ) one can see that the variation in the size of the lattice will change the amount of nearest neighbors that each worker is connected .",
    "therefore , as the whole parameters are kept constant to all simulations , the behavior of the curves in fig .",
    "[ nund ] are strictly related to the number of nearest neighbors in @xmath4-dimensional lattices .",
    "the statement above is proved in figure [ nundjzero ] where all the simulations were carried out as in fig .",
    "[ nund ] but keeping parameter @xmath55 .",
    "the parameter @xmath45 , in eq .",
    "( [ hi ] ) , set null means that the interaction among neighbors is not being considered in the reviewing process done by the agents .",
    "then , this figure clearly shows that migratory process is being modified due the number of neighbors , i.e. , the social interaction is playing more important role in the decision of migrate or not .",
    "figures [ wmnd ] and [ wand ] are plotting of expected urban wage @xmath56 and the rural wage @xmath57 , respectively .",
    "once again , the only parameter which is changed is the dimension of the lattice . in these figures",
    "is shown that the curves of @xmath56 and @xmath57 have a similar behavior independently of the dimension of lattice .",
    "it is important to mention that the curves plotted for @xmath1 in figs .",
    "[ wmnd ] and [ wand ] are the only ones in which the total number of workers @xmath13 is different from the values used in lower dimension lattices due to numerical limitations .",
    "our sizes are considerably smaller than the world record simulated in ref . ,",
    "because we do not use multi - spin coding and @xmath57 and @xmath56 must be reevaluated after each step .",
    "therefore , in fig . [ wa7d ] we plotted the rural wage as function of time for lattice of @xmath1 , varying @xmath13 in order to check its influence in the results .",
    "the variable @xmath58 measures the expected wages ratio . observing figures [ wmnd ] and [ wand ]",
    "one can see that @xmath59 , what indicates that the expected urban wage and the rural wage converge to same value .",
    "this is the harris - todaro equilibrium condition.@xcite    the deterministic total utility of each worker is calculated by using eq .",
    "( [ hi ] ) , where can see two differrent interactions acting in the worker s decision . the first part of right side of eq .",
    "( [ hi ] ) acts like an external time dependent field and in this case is related to the difference of wages between rural and urban sector .",
    "the intensity of this field is calibrated by the constant @xmath44",
    ". the second part of right of eq .",
    "( [ hi ] ) is the interaction of a worker among his / her neighborhood and it is related to the influence caused by the neighbors which intensity depends on the value of the constant @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , in ref . , to study the influence of the variation of these parameters we ran several simulations where the ratio @xmath60 and the size of the @xmath61 so that we could check their effects in the values of the urban share .",
    "now , we apply the same procedure to lattices with dimensions @xmath62 .",
    "figure [ jkl ] has plotted the urban share @xmath43 as function of ratio @xmath60 for different lattice size @xmath61 .",
    "each figure of this set is done for different dimension from @xmath0 , top left , to @xmath1 , right bottom .",
    "the horizontal axis of each figure is the linear dimension of the lattice @xmath61 , then the number of workers is obtained by the relation @xmath63 .",
    "all sets of fig .",
    "[ jkl ] reveal a similar distribution of the equilibrium values of the urban share , @xmath43 , for the six different dimensions simulated .",
    "the equilibrium urban share is slightly different when the spatial dimension @xmath4 is changed .",
    "this result is in agreement with fig .",
    "[ nund ] where one can see that @xmath4 modifies the speed of the migratory process but it has little influence in the value of equilibrium of urban share of the system , what explains the similar structures seen in all sets of fig .",
    "in this paper we analyzed the rural - urban migration process by means of an agent - based computational model .",
    "we extend the analysis carried out in our previous work to lattices with dimensions up to seven .",
    "the variation of the dimension of the lattices slightly modify some of the results found in the study of a two - dimensional lattice . to explain this , it is important to remember that the distribution of workers in the lattice does not mean a spatial distribution but the definition of the neighborhood of each individual . therefore , the bigger the lattice dimension the bigger the neighborhood that each worker will have which is the cause of the small difference in the results .",
