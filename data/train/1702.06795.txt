    "the origin of these internal breaks in the eed , presumedly related to the acceleration process , may be due to variations in the global field orientation or turbulence levels sampled by particles of different energy .",

    "1es1741 + 196 is the first blazar with known sed hosted in a triplet of interacting galaxies .",
    "it is interesting to note that , even though a tidal tail is observed to emanate from the host galaxy ( @xcite )  suggesting mass loss from the galaxy due to tidal forces within the triplet  the ssc emission parameters of 1es1741 + 196 do not substantially deviate from typical values ( except the doppler factor and the slope of eed ) observed in other bllacs .",
    "we reported the first detection ( by magic ) of vhe@xmath7-rays from the bllac source 1es1741 + 196 . from the 2010 - 2011 magic data the source",
    "is clearly detected at @xmath45 significance level .",
    "the multi - frequency data used in this paper suggest that 1es1741 + 196 shows a behaviour typical of hbl sources , with a slightly different eed and a lower doppler factor .",
    "a notable peculiarity of the sed of 1es1741 + 196 is that it shows the host galaxy s spectral signature , a thermal feature at optical / nir frequencies that we show is compatible with the spectrum of a giant elliptical .",
    "the coincidental relatively low luminosity of 1es1741 + 196 may stem from the jet s relatively low doppler factor .",
