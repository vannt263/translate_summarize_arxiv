    "llagn are galactic centers intermediate in luminosity and in some key properties between quasars ( bolometric luminosity @xmath2 erg s@xmath3 ) and inactive galactic centers ( igc ) , such as our own ( sgr  a@xmath4 ) , whose luminosity is about @xmath5 erg s@xmath3 .",
    "llagn are also known as liners ( low ionization nuclear emission - line regions ; heckman 1980 ) or as `` dwarf '' seyfert nuclei ( e.g. ho , filippenko & sargent 1997 , 2003 ) .",
    "typical nuclear bolometric luminosities of these sources are @xmath6 erg s@xmath3 ( e.g. ho 2003 ) . it is well known that most present day galaxies harbor supper massive black holes ( smbhs ) , implying that llagn and igc too had to be bright accreting sources at some earlier times .",
    "llagn and igc are thus quasar relics or quiescent phases of a long - term evolution of galactic nuclei",
    ". some of the processes operating in the quasar phase may have long - lasting effects and continue to influence smbh activity in the present dim epoch .",
    "one such process is star formation inside quasar accretion disks due to self - gravity at distances greater than @xmath7 schwarzschild  radii ( e.g. paczyski 1978 ; kolykhalov & sunyaev 1980 , shlosman & begelman 1989 ; goodman 2003 ) , where @xmath8 , the schwarzschild  radius for the black hole with mass @xmath9 .",
    "the goal of this paper is to investigate some of the possible effects of the presence of these close and fast moving stars on the llagn phenomenon .",
    "let us summarize the observational and theoretical framework in which bright agn , llagn and inactive galactic centers are currently understood .",
    "quasar accretion disks are believed to be the `` standard '' accretion disks ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) , possibly supplemented by an x - ray emitting corona .",
    "the cold accretion disk apparently extends down to the last stable orbit , as evidenced by a very prominent thermal - like uv feature called the big blue bump ( bbb ) and by the broad fe k@xmath10  lines observed in many cases ( it is our personal opinion that the non - detection of broad fe k@xmath10  lines in other sources is caused by an over - ionization of the accretion disk surface ) .",
    "the near - eddington luminosities of quasars , short time scale variability , and the high radiative efficiency with which most of the smbhs are inferred to have grown ( yu & tremaine 2002 ) are also best explained in the context of the standard accretion disks since they indeed have very high radiative efficiency .",
    "llagn , and our galactic center ( gc ) black hole , sgr  a@xmath4 , are distinctly different in this regard , possibly requiring a radiatively inefficient accretion .",
    "chandra x - ray observations constrain the amount of hot gas at the capture radius in sgr  a@xmath4  and m87 ( baganoff et al . 2003 ; di matteo et al .",
    "2003 ) , which allows one to estimate the bondi accretion rate onto the smbhs . for other sources where direct x - ray data are not constraining enough , ho ( 2003 )",
    "notes that the centers of the galaxies hosting llagn should be filled with hot winds from young stars ( similar to our gc ) , yielding an accretion rate estimate .",
    "in addition , the accretion rate through a cold accretion disk may be estimated by using the optical / uv data in some llagn ( e.g. quataert et al .",
    "1999 ; ptak et al .",
    "all of these methods lead to the same conclusion  the expected luminosity from a thin standard accretion disk fed at the deduced accretion rate is some @xmath11 orders of magnitude higher than actually observed .",
    "in addition , in stark contrast to quasars and seyfert galaxies , llagn do not show the bbb in their spectra ( ho 1999 ) , have no short time scale x - ray variability and no broad fe k@xmath10  lines ( e.g. dewangan et al .",
    "2004 ; ptak et al .",
    "this strongly argues for the absence of the cold accretion disks in the inner @xmath12",
    ". theoretical interpretation of this fact is that the cold disk `` evaporates '' at few hundred to few thousand @xmath13 ( e.g. quataert et al . 1999 ; fig .",
    "2 in ho 2003 ; ptak et al .",
    "2004 ) to form an inner hot non - radiative accretion flow ( e.g. narayan & yi 1994 ; blandford & begelman 1999 ) . the most frequently discussed evaporation mechanism is that of meyer & meyer - hofmeister ( 1994 ) .",
    "if the ions of the hot flow are much hotter than the electrons , then the flow is radiatively inefficient and is much less luminous than the standard flow , explaining the discrepancy . in the least luminous ( in terms of @xmath14 , where @xmath15 erg s@xmath3 , the eddington limit for the black hole mass @xmath16 ) cases , such as sgr  a@xmath4 , it is possible that a cold accretion disk does not even exists ( e.g. falcke & melia 1997",
    "; narayan 2002 ) .",
    "the best studied example of an inactive galactic center is the center of our own galaxy , sgr  a@xmath4 .",
    "genzel et al .",
    "( 2003 ; see also levin & beloborodov 2003 ) discovered that most of hot young ( @xmath17 years ) stars in the gc lie in one of the two _ stellar disks _",
    ", strongly suggesting these stars were formed by the self - gravity in two massive accretion disks existing in earlier times . in the case of the gc , these young stars actually dominate and determine the smbh activity , since their radiative output is some @xmath18 orders of magnitude greater than that of the accretion flow , and since the hot winds produced by these stars are believed to be the main source of fuel for sgr  a@xmath4  ( e.g. coker & melia 1997 ) .",
    "it is thus likely that important interactions between close stars and the accretion flow may be taking place in llagn as well .",
    "star formation may even continue in the llagn phase as well ( e.g. , see fig . 1 in goodman 2003 ; also milosavljevic & loeb 2004 ) .",
    "quite generally , close stars should assume more prominent roles in the llagn ( and igc ) phase than they do in quasars because the mass and the luminosity output of the gaseous accretion disk are modest in these sources .",
    "the possible effects of the close stars can be divided into two categories : the luminosity and the mass effects .",
    "the former are due to the combined stellar luminosities ; whereas the latter are due to stellar mass  dynamical and accretion effects .",
    "we find that the luminosity effects , besides reprocessing of the stellar light into the infrared region , are unlikely to be important due to existing observational constraints .",
    "the mass effects are much more likely to be important especially if the disk inner regions are `` light '' as is the case when the disk is unstable to a limit cycle instability ( e.g. siemiginowska , czerny , & kostyunin 1996 ; lin & shields 1986 ) or is emptied out in the inner part for other reasons .",
    "we shall not discuss the implications of self - gravity for quasar disks because these have been investigated previously by a number of workers ( e.g. paczyski 1978 ; kolykhalov & sunyaev 1980 ; shlosman & begelman 1989 ; goodman 2003 ) .",
    "quasars are believed to be accreting near the eddington limit and hence their accretion disks need to be quite massive .",
    "the disks are expected to form stars at radii for which the toomre ( 1964 ) parameter satisfies @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the isothermal sound speed of the disk , @xmath21 is the keplerian circular rotation frequency , @xmath22 is the disk column depth at radius @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the disk half - thickness ( pressure height - scale ) , and finally , @xmath25 is approximately the disk mass within radius @xmath23 . following goodman ( 2003 ) , the radii which satisfy this conditions in the standard accretion disk are @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the normalized shakura - sunyaev viscosity parameter , @xmath28 , where @xmath29 , with radiative efficiency @xmath30 . in this paper",
    "we shall use the notations in which @xmath31 , @xmath32 , etc .",
    "it has been argued that , in addition to @xmath33 , a second condition for star formation by self - gravity in accretion disks must be fulfilled : the cooling time should be shorter than a fraction of the keplerian rotation period ( e.g. shlosman & begelman 1989 ; gammie 2001 )",
    ". however , recent simulations by johnson & gammie ( 2003 ) demonstrated that the instability domain is much larger . in the non - linear instability stage",
    ", the local cooling time may be orders of magnitude smaller from that found in the unperturbed disk model .",
    "therefore johnson & gammie ( 2003 ) concluded that it is extremely difficult to prevent even the marginally stable , @xmath34 , optically thick disk from fragmenting and forming stars .",
    "since the formation of gravitationally bound structures is extremely fast ( toomre 1964 ) , it is then feared that most of the disk mass would be used up to build up stars rather than feed the smbh .",
    "sirko & goodman ( 2003 ) demonstrated that the amount of heat required to stop star formation in the disk outer regions is excessive ( i.e. larger than @xmath35 for a typical quasar ) , and moreover the observed quasar seds rule out such a heating .",
    "thus it seems inevitable that stars will form in quasar disks at radii @xmath36 .",
    "having formed there , the stars can migrate ( in - spiral ) radially through exchange of the angular momentum with the disk ( e.g. syer , clarke & rees 1991 ) , so their radial distribution may evolve significantly on time scales that are long enough .",
    "it is not clear how much mass would be converted to stars in a single accretion outburst episode , but if we assume that this is a fraction @xmath37 of the disk mass , then obviously @xmath38 where we set @xmath39 ( see equation [ hr ] ) , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the total number of stars created and a typical stellar mass , respectively .",
    "it is also unclear how exactly this stellar distribution evolves with time under the interaction with the accretion flow , since stars may be swallowed or tidally disrupted by the smbh if they migrate close enough ( syer et al .",
    "1991 ) , they may explode as supernovae ( e.g. syer et al .",
    "1991 ; rozyczka , bodenheimer , & lin 1995 ) , destroyed by direct star - star collisions , and evolve under the influence of long - range two - body interactions ( e.g. bahcall & wolf 1976 ) .",
    "it is outside the scope of this paper to discuss ways for quasars to maintain high enough mass transfer rates into the smbhs when the self - gravity sets in their accretion disks . now , suppose that the quasar mass supply has substantially decreased , so that most of the gaseous disk mass has been used up , and that some number of the `` original '' self - gravity created stars is still caught up in the disk .",
    "the quasar presumably becomes a llagn .",
    "what would then be the role of such stars ?",
    "even with the hst , except for very few nearby galaxies , galactic centers are not resolvable to scales better than @xmath42 pc in the optical / uv . stars formed in a self - gravitating disk at a distance of @xmath43 pc , where @xmath44 , and @xmath45 , can not be directly separated out from the accretion disk spectrum .",
    "in addition , the galactic centers are viewed through a large column depth of galactic stars ( i.e. the galactic bulges ) .",
    "however , filippenko & sargent ( 1985 ) , and ho , filippenko & sargent ( 1997 ) , created a large template of galaxies without or with very weak emission lines . using a sophisticated technique to fit the absorption lines in the spectra of llagn",
    ", they were able to subtract out contribution of galactic stars , and to obtain the nuclear ( very weak compared to the galaxy ) continuum and broad emission lines of llagn .    the stars that we are interested in are very close to the smbh , and their circular kepler velocities are @xmath46 km / sec , where @xmath47 . since the galaxy template contains spectra with fwhm velocities of @xmath48 km / sec ( ho et al .",
    "1997 ) , it is most likely that the doppler - broadened spectra of the inner stars in the llagn would be counted as the continuum emission ( ho 2004 , private communication ) .",
    "can such stars make a non - negligible contribution to the llagn nuclear spectrum ?",
    "two cases exist .",
    "the stellar spectrum of the inner central parsec of our gc is dominated by hot young stars .",
    "it is thus interesting to compare its spectrum with the better of the available nuclear llagn spectra .",
    "m81 is a nearby llagn , with the smbh mass estimated at a value very close to that of sgr  a@xmath4(e.g .",
    "schdel  et al .",
    "2003 ; ghez et al .",
    "2003 ) , i.e. @xmath49 .",
    "m81 nuclear infrared to uv spectrum is shown as thick data points and upper limits in figure [ fig : mw ] as compiled in table 2 of ho ( 1999 ) .",
    "ho ( 1999 ) argues against a significant intrinsic dust extinction in llagn .",
    "the spectrum of stars in the inner 1 pc in our gc is relatively well known ( mezger et al . 1996 ) : there is a contribution of ubiquitous low mass stars with effective temperature @xmath50 k , with a combined luminosity of @xmath51 , and that of @xmath52 hot young stars with the total luminosity of @xmath53 and the effective temperature of @xmath54 k. this spectrum is shown as a solid curve in figure [ fig : mw ] and assumes no extinction ( of course we actually observe the gc through some @xmath52 magnitudes of extinction in the visual ) .",
    "clearly , had there been a similar amount of such hot luminous young stars in m81 as in the gc , these stars would easily out - shine the llagn in m81 in the uv band .",
    "however in the gc the vast majority of the hot young stars move with velocities of order @xmath48 km / sec , so that the subtraction technique of ho et al .",
    "( 1997 ) would have probably removed them from the nuclear spectrum . in any event , stars moving with so `` low '' velocities are outside the radius where most of the accretion flow physics is played out ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "the results of ho ( 1999 ) thus clearly show that there are no or very few hot young luminous o - stars in the inner accretion flow region in most of the llagn ( liners ) as otherwise they would produce a component similar to the bbb .",
    "since the history of star formation and evolution in an accretion disk is extremely model- and parameter - dependent , it is possible that such young massive stars never formed in the llagn accretion disk .",
    "it is also possible that these stars have already gone through the supernova phase ( e.g. syer et al .",
    "1991 ) , or are on the red giant branch , thus shifting their spectrum from the uv into the optical frequencies ( but see the next section ) .      the dotted line in figure [ fig : mw ] is a very simple model that `` fits '' the m81 data much better . in this model",
    "the `` low '' mass stars have average temperature of @xmath56 k , with the total luminosity of @xmath57 , and just one hot luminous star with @xmath58 and @xmath54 k. clearly , a more realistic model with a power - law mass function could be designed that would easily fit the ifra - red to uv sed of m81 with no contribution from the accretion onto the smbh whatsoever .",
    "however , there are several arguments against this possibility . as we argued above , to appear as agn continuum",
    ", the spectrum of such stars would have to be strongly smeared , say with random velocities of order @xmath59 km / sec or more .",
    "for m81 , the mass of the stars would exceed the deduced smbh mass , thus leading to a direct contradiction with observations .",
    "further , the stellar densities in the inner part of the stellar cluster would be as large as @xmath60 if the stars are main sequence stars with @xmath61 .",
    "such high stellar densities are extremely unlikely because stellar physical collisions and disintegrations would be expected ( e.g. murthy , cohn , & durisen 1991 ) .",
    "if the stars are much more luminous super - giants , then the required stellar number density is much lower but because of their large radii , we find that the collision time is of the same order , i.e. too short .",
    "the red giant stars are also easy targets for ablation of mass due to star - disk collisions ( armitage , zurek & davies 1996 ) .",
    "finally , there is a deficit of such stars in the inner cusp of our gc ( genzel et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the stellar cusp / cluster could also contribute to heating the gaseous disk , especially its surface layers .",
    "if the stars are uniformly distributed within radius @xmath23 , then the effective temperature of the stellar radiation is @xmath62 kelvin , where @xmath63 is the total stellar luminosity in units of @xmath64 erg sec@xmath3 .",
    "we argued that it is not plausible for the stars to dominate the nuclear optical / uv continuum of llagn , hence it seems unlikely that they would significantly add to the reprocessed disk emission .",
    "this may not be the case , however , because the accretion disk is very thin ( equation [ hr ] ) , and only a very small fraction of the luminosity generated by accretion onto the smbh may impact the outer disk .",
    "in contrast , the accretion disk is geometrically thick compared to stars and would reprocess a large fraction of stellar light even if stars are exactly in the disk midplane .",
    "if stars are on more general orbits ( see  [ sec : hi ] ) , then roughly half of their radiation is reprocessed in the disk , possibly making it important in the mid - infrared region where a `` bare '' disk ( without surrounding stars ) is predicted to be dim . in this case the distribution of the radiation impinging on the disk will be quite patchy . therefore there may be a broad range of temperatures resulting from the stellar illumination of the disk which would obviously lead to a broad infra - red feature in the sed of the llagn",
    ". this feature will be spectroscopically much broader than that resulting from the disk illumination by the single central source ( the accreting smbh ) , and it may be also variable on time scales of weeks to years because of bright stars approaching and passing through the disk ( e.g. nayakshin & sunyaev 2003 ; cuadra et al . 2003 ) .",
    "stars also heat the disk via bodily impacts ( e.g. zentsova 2003 , norman & silk 1983 ) and can increase the effective disk viscosity ( ostriker 1983 ) .",
    "stars orbiting the smbh in the inner parsec of the accretion flow will also modify the accretion flow of gas .",
    "we assume that the combined mass of stars in this region is much smaller than @xmath65 , and consider the case when the stellar and disk planes coincide exactly . in this limit",
    "the relative velocity of a star and the gas in the disk surrounding the star is negligible .",
    "thus star - disk interactions are qualitatively different .",
    "the interaction is best understood based on the analogy between this case and that of a better studied circumstellar disk with embedded ( proto- ) planets . if the star does not open up a radial gap in the disk ( see below ) , then it grows via bondi - like gas accretion .",
    "if the gap is opened , the accretion onto the star slows down significantly .",
    "the star however continues to interact with the disk due to gravity ( essentially via dynamical friction ) . in both gap / no - gap cases the star can migrate , that is spiral - in , radially . clearly the flows of gas and stars are not independent .",
    "a star co - rotating with the disk interacts with the gas in the disk via gravitational torques ( e.g. goldreich & tremaine 1980 ; lin & papaloizou 1986a , b ) .",
    "the linear velocity of gas at radii greater than the radius at which the star circles the smbh , @xmath23 , is increased as a result of the interaction with the star .",
    "thus its angular momentum increases and it moves outward from the star s location .",
    "the opposite happens to the gas interior to the star s location .",
    "hence the star pushes the gas away from its radial position .",
    "if this effect is strong enough , a radial gap is opened in the disk .",
    "the hill s radius @xmath66 , @xmath67^{1/3}\\,r\\ ; , \\label{rh}\\ ] ] defines the star s sphere of influence in the disk : dynamics of gas within the sphere is dominated by the star rather than the smbh .",
    "there are two conditions for formation of the radial gap in the disk .",
    "the first is that @xmath66 is greater than the pressure scale height of the disk , @xmath24 .",
    "otherwise the gas would be able to overflow the star at vertical heights @xmath68 .",
    "the disk height - scale @xmath24 for gas - pressure standard accretion disk at @xmath69 is @xmath70 ( see svensson & zdziarski 1994 ) .",
    "we assume that the accretion disk is not strongly self - gravitating during the llagn epoch , i.e. that @xmath71 .",
    "since @xmath72 where @xmath73 . the first condition for a gap formation is usually satisfied in llagn disks .",
    "the second criterion is that the rate with which the gas is pushed away from the star s location due to gravitational interaction is higher than the rate with which the gap could be filled in due to viscous gas transport .",
    "this is possible only when the disk viscosity is low enough .",
    "parameterized in terms of the shakura - sunyaev @xmath10-parameter , this condition becomes @xmath74 ( e.g. syer et al .",
    "1991 ) . using the expression for @xmath75 ,",
    "we get @xmath76 it is unlikely that @xmath10 is as low as this , and hence the low mass stars are unable to open a gap in the disk of a `` large '' smbh , i.e. @xmath77 .",
    "however , for @xmath78 , the coefficient in equation [ amin1 ] is @xmath79 : low mass stars may open a gap in accretion disks of lighter galactic nuclei .",
    "finally , for @xmath80 and @xmath81 , i.e. a high mass star with @xmath82 , we have @xmath83 , thus a gap formation is again likely .",
    "consider now the cases when the stars are unable to open up a gap . as shown above ,",
    "a gap is unlikely to form for high mass black holes , i.e. @xmath84 , or when the stars are low mass stars . also , gap formation is more problematic at large radii @xmath85 .",
    "the stars then grow by accretion of gas from the disk ( syer et al .",
    "1991 ) .      for low mass stars ,",
    "stellar radiation and winds are relatively weak .",
    "the accretion of gas onto a low mass star is then similar to the growth of terrestrial planets in a planetesimal disk ( lissauer 1987 ; bate et al .",
    "2003 ; tan & goodman 2004 ) . since @xmath86 , accretion onto the star is quasi two - dimensional .",
    "the accretion rate is determined by the rate at which differential rotation brings the matter into the hill s sphere , @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the mean disk density .",
    "we used the fact that the characteristic gas velocity ( relative to the star ) at the hill s distance from the star , @xmath89 , is @xmath90 since the angular velocity for keplerian rotation is @xmath91 .",
    "equation [ mhill ] is valid as long as @xmath86 since in the opposite case the gas thermal velocity becomes important and the accretion would proceed at the bondi rate ( e.g. , syer et al 1991 ) . of course @xmath92",
    "can not exceed the eddington limit value , e.g. , @xmath93 where @xmath94 , star s radius in solar radii units .",
    "the enormous radiation field of luminous high mass stars pre - heats the disk material at distances @xmath95 from the star .",
    "if the temperature established is much higher than the unperturbed disk temperature , the flow of gas will be strongly affected .",
    "indeed , @xmath96^{1/4}$ ] , @xmath97 ( where @xmath98 ) can be larger than the disk effective temperature , @xmath99 : @xmath100 the accretion disk next to a high mass star is thus bloated . at distances from the star @xmath101 ,",
    "the star s gravity takes over and a thin small scale circum - stellar disk develops .",
    "perpendicular to the disk , strong stellar winds sweep up the colder matter .",
    "a sort of torus thus forms around the star .",
    "there will be a thin ionized ( stromgren ) layer on the side of the torus facing the star . at low disk surface densities appropriate to llagn",
    ", high mass stars loose rather than gain mass from the disk ; the winds may cool and condense on the disk surface ] .",
    "the accretion rate onto the massive star is strongly reduced due to the disk pre - heating .",
    "the disk accretion on the high mass stars is completely negligible compared with that on the much more numerous low mass stars that do not suffer from pre - heating and stellar winds .",
    "the observational appearance of the star will be strongly angle dependent . viewed pole - on to the disk , the intrinsic stellar emission is clearly visible , as is the line emission resulting from the disk illumination . however , when viewed at large inclination angles , the stellar emission is hidden from the observer similar to the central regions of type 2 agn",
    ". the optical line emission of the inner part of the `` torus '' around the star may still be visible .",
    "note that for quasar disks , @xmath102 and then @xmath103 even for the brightest o stars .",
    "in addition , for smaller radii , i.e. @xmath104 , the disk pre - heating is unimportant even for llagn .",
    "as shown previously , the embedded stars gain mass from the accretion disk . here",
    "we consider only the low mass stars that are certain to dominate the disk - stars mass exchange due to their large number . from the standard accretion theory ,",
    "the gas accretion rate onto the smbh is @xmath105 since @xmath106 ( e.g. frank , king & raine 1992 ) .",
    "therefore the rate of accretion on the single star compares to the accretion rate onto the black hole as @xmath107 surprisingly , just one star in a llagn disk may consume the disk quicker than the smbh , leaving little for the smbh growth .",
    "of course the accretion onto the proto - star is limited to @xmath108 , for one .",
    "pre - heating of the gas by the radiation from the star and the circum - stellar accretion disk may decrease the accretion rate further .",
    "nevertheless , even if accretion on a single star is very inefficient compared with equation [ mhill ] , a large number of proto - stars in the disk can make up for this , and thus the combined mass accretion on these stars could well exceed that onto the smbh during the llagn phase .",
    "if stars embedded inside the disk eat it away before the gas can reach the smbh , then the disk inner region may in principle be almost empty and hence underluminous compared with the steady - state standard accretion disk .",
    "this could then explain the observed lack of the bbb in the llagn spectra , interpreted as an inner hole in the accretion disk ( e.g. quataert et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "we test this idea by comparing the expected disk spectra to the observations of m81 as an example . given the quality of the data , we model the sed of cold disks consumed by the stars with a very simple model .",
    "we use the standard multi - temperature black - body spectrum with the exception that the accretion rate , @xmath109 , is a function of radius .",
    "we neglect stellar irradiation compared with internal disk viscous heating .",
    "the local disk effective temperature is then given by equation [ teffd ] .",
    "we assume that stars are only present at radii larger than a `` self - gravity '' radius , @xmath110 .",
    "the latter may be smaller than @xmath111 because of the possible radial migration of stars . for simplicity , we choose @xmath112 , for @xmath113 , and @xmath114 for @xmath115 .",
    "figure [ fig : gradual ] shows the same data as figure [ fig : mw ] with several models for the disk emission .",

    "a sudden disk depletion at a small range of radii is not impossible if there is a large concentration of low mass stars there , but is seems a rather unlikely case to us .",
    "the total mass of the stars in this disk depletion region would not be very large , @xmath135  years ) for @xmath136 .",
    "however , the radial size of the @xmath133 region is only @xmath137 , for the m81 smbh mass , yielding stellar density of order @xmath138 .",
    "any star present at such small radii from a pre - existent isotropic cluster would have been destroyed in only @xmath139 years .",
    "the resulting disintegration of the stars would have resulted in a very energetic accretion event . thus this picture would mandate periods of quiescence when stars steal most of the mass from the accreting flow , and shorter periods of strong accretion activity onto the smbh when the stellar collisions or supernova explosions ( if stars grow to be too massive ) release the stored gas . as time between these luminosity variations",
    "is long compared to history of astronomy , it is not immediately clear whether such model is supported by observations or not .      for higher stellar mass to the smbh mass ratios ,",
    "gap formation occurs ( see eqs .",
    "[ amin ] & [ amin1 ] ) .",
    "the accretion rate of the star is reduced by the gap presence , but does not stop completely ( e.g. bate et al . 2003 ) .",
    "when the mass of the star is small compared to the surrounding disk , the radial motion of the star is similar to that of the fluid at the same position in the disk .",
    "the star thus migrates closer to the smbh on the disk viscous time scale . because of its small mass",
    ", the star does not significantly alters the radial surface density profile of the disk ( lin & papaloizou 1986b ) .",
    "while the detailed disk spectrum may be affected by the presence of the star , the effect is quite minor as long as the star s mass is small compared to that of the disk , and the disk is optically thick .",
    "however , when the mass of the star ( or any massive satellite such as a secondary black hole ) is considerable , the accretion disk is bound to `` notice '' the satellite ( syer & clarke 1995 ) .",
    "since the angular momentum exchange continues through the gap , the disk interior to the star is able to continue accretion onto the smbh . at the same time , the gas at radii larger than the position of the star is blocked by the gap . because of the high inertia of the star , the radial velocity of the gas just outside of the gap is smaller than its unperturbed ( i.e. star - free ) value , and the disk surface density builds up there ( lin & papaloizou 1986b ; syer et al .",
    "1991 ; ivanov , papaloizou , & polnarev 1999 ) .",
    "syer & clarke ( 1995 ) show that the radial migration velocity of the satellite becomes @xmath140 where @xmath141 is the disk unperturbed radial viscous velocity .",
    "if @xmath142 , when the disk accretion is basically temporarily stopped , until the mass behind the satellite becomes large enough to push it through into the black hole .",
    "meanwhile , the inner disk , cutoff from the mass supply , empties out and may become quite dim ( syer & clarke 1995 ) .",
    "this situation will persist during time @xmath143 years .",
    "this is actually an upper limit , because the overflow of the gap may occur at lower values of @xmath144 , i.e. at somewhat earlier times .",
    "after enough mass has been accumulated , the accretion resumes , resulting in a bright outburst . the star and the built - up disk accrete onto the smbh on the disk viscous time scale , the one that reflects the amount of the stored mass .",
    "if the accretion rate in such an outburst is high enough , the inner disk becomes radiation - pressure dominated and the viscous time may be significantly shorter than that of the quiescent disk at the same location ( this is due to a change in the factor @xmath145 ) . the activity phase is thus relatively short compared with the mass accumulation phase .",
    "are such blocked accretion flows relevant to the apparently cutoff disks of llagn ?",
    "if this were the case , the llagn activity would be periodic , with the llagn being the quiescent state and a more brighter phase , such as seyfert galaxies nuclei , would be the outburst state .",
    "the mass of the unperturbed accretion disk , estimated as @xmath146 in the standard accretion flow is @xmath147 the disk is too heavy for a single star to induce serious accretion rate modulation for these parameters . for a smaller smbh mass ,",
    "say @xmath148 , the coefficient in equation [ mdisk ] is about @xmath149 , making a single star a big drag onto the accretion flow .",
    "the accretion luminosity can then be substantially modulated .",
    "syer et al . (",
    "1991 ) , considering the case of a @xmath150 smbh , already mentioned such a possibility .",
    "the quiescence time can be as long as @xmath151 years in this case .",
    "therefore , the possibility of a significant time variability due to presence of stars in the disk , and the `` empty '' observational appearance of the inner disk , can not be ruled out for lower mass black holes . however , the absence of the uv bump ( bbb ) in the llagn spectrum is quite a general feature , seemingly independent of the smbh mass . indeed , many of the objects in the ho ( 1999 ) sample have smbh masses higher than @xmath152 .",
    "the recent observations of ptak et al .",
    "( 2004 ) of ngc 3998 , a llagn with the smbh estimated at @xmath153 , also shows no clear bbb .",
    "many stars embedded in the accretion flow and all drifting together could slow down the accretion in the inner regions of high smbh accretion disks , but one would naively expect the stars to be smoothly distributed in the disk . hence embedded stars can not explain cutoff disks in high mass llagn . therefore clogging up",
    "the disk flow with embedded stars is possible , but it can not be the reason behind the missing inner accretion disk of llagn .",
    "so far we have been concerned with stars embedded in the disk . in general , however , there will be stars on highly inclined ( to the disk ) orbits , brought in by relaxation of the old central star cluster ( e.g. bahcall & wolf 1976 ) , or from partial capture of stars by the accretion disk ( syer et al .",
    "1991 ) , etc .",
    "if stellar orbital planes and the disk plane are significantly mis - aligned , then most of the interactions take place when the stars hit the disk and pass through it ( e.g. ostriker 1983 ; norman & silk 1983 ; zentsova 1983 ; perry & williams 1993 ; nayakshin et al .",
    "the stars move through the disk at very high mach numbers and produce strong shocks .",
    "quite generally , the stars are expected to enhance ( speed - up ) the accretion flow because of the additional angular momentum transfer mechanism ( ostriker 1983 ) and the extra heating .",
    "thus this effect works in the opposite direction to that discussed in  [ sec : load ] .    for radii smaller than some value @xmath154 , the angular momentum transfer in the disk",
    "is dominated by star - disk collisions rather than by the internal disk viscosity .",
    "the value of @xmath154 is a function of the number density of stars in the inner part of the stellar cusp and their orbits ( see nayakshin et al .",
    "2004 for estimates for sgr  a@xmath4  under assumption of an isotropic stellar cusp ) .",
    "if the angular momentum transfer mediated by stars is very fast , then the surface column depth of the disk is much smaller ( for the same @xmath155 const ) than it is for the standard disk .",
    "if it becomes optically thin , the disk will be much hotter for the same accretion rate .",
    "in fact , if it is unable to cool , the disk switches to a hot accretion mode , opening up an inner hole in the optically thick geometrically thin disk .    due to interactions with the disk ,",
    "embedded stars have keplerian circular velocities .",
    "if two such stars meet in the disk , their relative velocity is small .",
    "in contrast stars out of the plane are expected to have a broad velocity distribution ( e.g. bahcall & wolf 1976 ) and are prone to self - destruction in hard collisions ( e.g. see  3 of murthy et al . 1991 , and references therein ) .",
    "such a collision may involve two highly inclined stars or one star embedded in the disk and the other at a highly inclined orbit .",
    "if such an event happens in the inner disk region , and especially if the mass of the inner disk is not too much greater than the combined mass of the two stars , then the resulting energy release will be sufficient to significantly speed up the accretion of the inner disk .",
    "the inner disk may then be quickly emptied out , and while it is being refilled the disk will radiate as a cut - off disk .    as did the effects discussed in ",
    "[ sec : load ] , these two mechanisms for the inner disk removal are also of a temporary nature . unless being flat as an accretion disk , the inner stellar cusp will self - destruct by binary collisions in a relatively short time , e.g. @xmath156 years for typical cluster parameters ( see , e.g. , fig",
    ". 6 of murthy et al .",
    "hence these mechanisms for the inner disk removal can be relevant to llagn only if these are relatively short lived phenomena in the smbh / agn activity cycles .",
    "here we suggested that close stars ( @xmath157 pc from the smbh ) created in the accretion disk by self - gravity in the bright quasar phase , may be present in the llagn disks .",
    "we found (  [ sec : rad ] ) that it is unlikely that these disk stars significantly contribute to the llagn optical / uv spectrum directly .",
    "hot young massive stars are ruled out because most llagn are weak in the uv ; and low mass stars would have to be too numerous .",
    "stellar contribution in the infra - red range is plausible , however , because sed of standard accretion disks are weak in that region .",
    "the effects of stars mass , i.e. inertia , are much more realistic because they require a `` small '' number of low - mass stars embedded in the disk ( say @xmath158 stars ) .",
    "these stars can consume the disk faster than it can accrete on the smbh ( if no radial gap forms in the disk ) . in this case little gas may be flowing into the central smbh .",
    "however , when fitting the optical / uv spectrum of a `` typical '' llagn , m81 , we found that this model would only work if the disk were quickly and abruptly consumed by the embedded stars in the inner @xmath159 few hundreds schwarzschild  radii .",
    "further work is needed to determine whether this is natural and may be sustained for long enough times to explain the llagn phenomenon .",
    "if a radial gap does form , then stars embedded in the disk do not accrete gas from the disk .",
    "however their presence will be still felt by the disk if the disk mass interior to the star is smaller than the mass of the star ( or group of stars ) .",
    "this appears to be especially important in the quiescent phase of limit - cycle unstable disks , in which case the stars will clog - up the inner accretion flow for time necessary for accumulation of enough disk matter to push the star in the disk . since the disk interior to the star s location is quickly emptied out ( syer & clarke 1995 ) , such a star - terminated disk would appear as a cut - off disk . finally , we noted that hard stellar collisions in the inner disk region may disrupt the disk  create temporary inner holes .",
    "we shall however notice that it is unlikely that the star - disk interactions discussed in this paper are the only explanation to the llagn `` inner holes '' in the accretion disk . as we have seen in ",
    "[ sec : load ] , the character of star - disk interactions depends strongly on the mass of the smbh .",
    "observations span a very large range in the smbh mass , i.e. almost @xmath160 ( see e.g. ho 1999 , ptak et al .",
    "2004 ) . moreover , the accreting ( stellar mass ) binary systems may have inner holes in their accretion disks in the low luminosity states as well ( e.g. see esin , mcclintock & narayan 1997 ; mcclintock et al .",
    "therefore the star - disk interactions may be an _",
    "additional reason _ for a complicated time - variability in a disk that is already unstable ( e.g. lin & shields 1986 ; siemiginowska et al .",
    "1996 ) or time - dependent because of a changing supply of fuel at large distances , but they are unlikely to be the primary reason for such variations in the disk structure .    nevertheless with observations becoming progressively better , we should expect many surprises , especially exotic variability , from the effects of star - disk interactions .",
