    "it has been known for a long time that 5-min solar oscillations have significantly lower amplitude ( by a factor of 2 - 5 ) in sunspots and plages than in the quiet sun ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite enumerated four possible mechanisms to explain the observed power suppression : 1 ) reduction of excitation of p - modes inside sunspots ; 2 ) absorption of p - modes inside sunspots @xcite ; 3 ) the different height of spectral line formation due to the wilson depression ; 4 ) altering of p - mode eigenfunctions by the magnetic field .",
    "the precise contribution of these effects to the observed amplitude reduction is still unknown . in this paper",
    "we study the first effect : changes in the oscillation amplitude due to suppression of acoustic sources by using 3d numerical simulation of solar acoustic waves , which are important for solar seismology studies . inside sunspots ,",
    "strong magnetic field inhibits turbulent convective motions which are the source of the 5-min solar oscillations .",
    "therefore , the waves in the 5-min period ( 3 mhz frequency ) range , observed in sunspots , mostly come from the outside regions , and thus their amplitude is reduced in comparison to the quiet sun .",
    "our goal was to estimate the significance of this effect by modeling wave fields in horizontally uniform background solar models with regions of reduced excitation .",
    "the main result is that the suppression of oscillation sources inside sunspots can make substantial ( about 50% or greater ) contribution to the reduction of amplitude inside sunspots , and thus must be taken into account in sunspot seismology .",
    "wave propagation on the sun ( in absence of magnetic field and flows ) can be described by the following system of linearized euler equations : @xmath0 \\displaystyle{\\frac{\\partial } { \\partial t}}(\\rho_0 { \\mbox{\\boldmath$u$ } } ' ) + { \\mbox{\\boldmath$\\nabla$}}\\;p ' = { \\mbox{\\boldmath$g$}}_0 \\rho ' + { \\mbox{\\boldmath$f$}}(x , y , z , t ) , \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 are the perturbations of @xmath2 velocity components , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the density and pressure perturbations correspondingly , @xmath5 is the function describing the acoustic sources . the pressure @xmath6 , density @xmath7 , and gravitational accelerations @xmath8 of the background reference model depend only on depth @xmath9 .",
    "we used the adiabatic relation @xmath10 between lagrangian variations of pressure @xmath11 and density @xmath12 .",
    "the adiabatic exponent @xmath13 was calculated from opal equation of state @xcite .",
    "the numerical method is based on a high - order finite difference scheme , developed by @xcite and described in details by @xcite .",
    "the coefficients of this finite difference scheme are chosen to minimize the error of the fourier transform of numerical derivatives .",
    "such a scheme preserves the dispersion relations of the continuous case for shorter wavelengths .",
    "a 3rd - order strong stability preserving runge - kutta method @xcite was used for time integration .",
    "the standard solar model @xcite with a smoothly joined chromospheric model of @xcite was used as the background state .",
    "the model was corrected in the near - surface layers to prevent development of convective instability in the superadiabatic layer by replacing large negative values of the brunt - visl frequency by zero ( or small positive ) values and recalculating the hydrostatic equilibrium @xcite .",
    "this is a necessary modification for all linear simulations of this type .",
    "it suppresses rapidly growing unstable convective modes but does not affect essential properties of acoustic wave propagation in the sun .    to prevent reflection of acoustic waves from the boundaries of the computational domain",
    ", we follow the pml ( perfectly matching layer ) method of @xcite .",
    "we set the top non - reflecting boundary condition above the temperature minimum .",
    "this simulates a realistic case when the waves are only partially reflected by the photosphere .",
    "the waves with frequencies higher than acoustic cut - off frequency @xmath14 mhz pass through the photosphere and are absorbed by the pml . for frequencies below @xmath15 , the top boundary does not affect the reflection because the acoustic waves are mostly reflected by the photosphere and become evanescent in the chromosphere .",
    "the damping mechanism of solar modes below the acoustic cut - off frequency is not yet completely understood .",
    "it can be due to wave scattering on turbulence in subsurface layers @xcite and also due to partial escape of waves and radiative losses @xcite .",
    "we have investigated both of these mechanisms .",
    "the atmospheric damping was modeled by imposing the upper absorbing boundary at different levels , and choosing the height of this boundary in such a way ( about 500 km above the photosphere ) that the observed line widths in the oscillation power spectrum are well reproduced . to model the subsurface ( turbulent )",
    "damping we followed @xcite and added a friction - type term @xmath16 to the vertical component of momentum equation , where damping coefficient @xmath17 is constant above the photosphere and smoothly decreases to zero at a depth of about 500 km .",
    "for this case , the upper boundary was placed at the chromosphere - corona transition layer ( about 1750 km above the photosphere ) , and the value of @xmath17 was adjusted to match the observed line widths and relative amplitude of the peaks in the acoustic spectrum .",
    "the lateral boundary conditions are periodic .",
    "duration of simulations was 4.5 hours of solar time .",
    "we compared results with longer runs and checked that the root mean square ( rms ) oscillation amplitude reaches an equilibrium state , and also that the simulated acoustic spectra are close to the observed power spectrum .",
    "the question about the depth of the acoustic sources on the sun is also still open .",
    "numerical simulations of solar convection @xcite show that in the region around @xmath18 mhz the most driving occurs between the photoshpere and sub - surface layer 500 km deep , with a maximum driving at 200 - 300 km below the surface .",
    "accordingly , the sources were randomly distributed in time and on a horizontal plane 350 km below the photosphere .",
    "we considered also the case of shallow ( 100 km deep ) sources , as suggested by @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the sources were modeled by spherically symmetric gaussian shape vertical force perturbations with fwhm of 300 km and random amplitudes and frequencies .",
    "the time dependence was either a one - period sin function : @xmath19,\\ ; t_0\\leq t\\leq t_0 + 2\\pi/\\omega$ ] or ricker s wavelet : @xmath20 where @xmath21,\\ ; t_0\\leq~t\\leq~t_0 + 4\\pi/\\omega$ ] .",
    "the frequency distribution of acoustic sources was uniform in the range of @xmath22  mhz .",
    "the simulations were carried out in the rectangular domain of size 122@xmath23122@xmath2330 @xmath24 using a uniform 816@xmath23816@xmath23630 grid .",
    "the simulated and observed power spectra are shown in fig .",
    "using this method we simulated the distribution of oscillation power for sunspots of various size , acoustic source models , and compared with observations .",
    "observations for sunspots in active regions ar10373 ( a , b , c ) and ar8243 ( d , e , f ) obtained by soho / mdi are shown in fig .",

    "the azimuthally averaged profiles of the oscillation amplitude ( thick solid curves for observations and dashed curves for simulations ) and the profile of the source strength ( thin solid curves ) are shown in panels c ) and f ) .",
    "we simulated the suppression of the acoustic sources ( changes in acoustic emissivity ) due to magnetic field in sunspots by zeroing the source amplitude at the center of sunspot umbra and smoothly increasing the source strength in the penumbra towards a constant value outside the sunspots ( source masking ) .",
    "numerical experiments with different profiles of the source strength show in all cases that the simulated wave field profile has the shape similar to the profile of the acoustic source strength ( this was not a priori obvious ) .",
    "thus , we use a horizontal profile of the observed wave field ( shifted and scaled to be in range [ 0,1 ] ) as an acoustic source strength profile . in reality",
    "the strength of acoustic sources depends on magnetic field strength .",
    "the actual dependence is unknown , however , the distribution of acoustic sources calculated from the wave field is similar to the inverse profile of the sunspot magnetic field ( fig .",
    "[ f3 ] ) .",
    "the simulation results ( fig .",
    "[ f2 ] c , f ) show that the waves propagate into the region of reduced excitation , but oscillation amplitude is substantially decreased .",
    "however it still does not match the observed values at sunspot center .",
    "this means that the suppression of acoustic sources is obviously a very important effect in sunspot seismology . however , other factors are likely to play role too .    the result of simulations for the sunspot in active region ar8243",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "panel a ) represents the amplitude map for simulations with a low ( 500 km ) top absorbing boundary without explicit damping and filtered with a spatial gaussian filter with fwhm of 1.5 arcsec to reflect the instrumental smoothing .",
    "panel b ) represents the angular averaged amplitude profiles for observations ( thick solid curve ) ; simulations with a low top absorbing boundary without explicit damping ( thick dashed curve ) ; simulations with a high ( 1750 km ) top absorbing boundary with an additional damping term in the subsurface layers , introduced into the z - component of the momentum equation ( thin dashed curve ) .",
    "the thin solid curve shows the strength profile of the acoustic sources .",
    "it was shown by @xcite that the hight of formation of ni i 6768 line used by the mdi instrument is in the range of 200@xmath27300 km above the photosphere . to match the simulations with the mdi observations ,",
    "the amplitude maps were plotted for the height of 300 km above the photosphere .",
    "velocities @xmath28 and @xmath29 outside and inside the masked region were calculated by spatial averaging of the amplitude map in the circle of radius 9.0 mm around the center of the sunspot and outside the sunspot in the ring with inner and outer radii of 45 mm and 50 mm correspondingly .",
    "the ratios @xmath30 are @xmath31 for simulations with explicit damping and @xmath32 for simulations without explicit damping .",
    "the amplitude ratio obtained from the observations ( for the same averaging regions ) equals @xmath33 .",
    "thus , in both cases our simulations show that more than a half of the amplitude suppression comes from the absence of acoustic sources inside the sunspot , and the results are not much sensitive to the mechanism of wave damping .",
    "our numerical experiments showed that amplitude ratio @xmath30 is insensitive to the detailed shape of the profile of the acoustic source strength .",
    "however , it is important that the fwhm of the source strength is close to the fwhm of the averaged horizontal amplitude profile of the observed wave field .",
    "we found that the amplitude ratio increases for smaller depth @xmath34 of the acoustic sources and equals @xmath35 for @xmath36 km below the photosphere ( low top absorbing boundary without explicit damping ) .",
    "this can be an evidence that the depth of the acoustic sources is between 100 km and 350 km , if the absence of acoustic sources is a dominating mechanism of the amplitude suppression in sunspots .",
    "we have carried such simulations for several other sunspots , and obtained similar results .",
    "the comparison between simulations and observations for sunspots of different sizes is shown in fig .",
    "the ratio @xmath30 as a function of umbra diameter is plotted .",
    "the open circles represent observations , the stars represent simulations .",
    "both the simulations and the observations show the same trend : the amplitude suppression increases with the size of sunspots . on average , the amplitude ratio is about a half of the observed one for the sources at depth 350 km , and higher for shallower sources .",
    "frequency dependence of the amplitude ratio for ar8243 is shown in fig .",
    "[ f5]b . the frequency shift between the simulations and observations in fig .",
    "[ f5]b can be an evidence that the acoustic cut - off frequency inside sunspots is much lower that in the quiet sun , but this requires further investigation .",
    "this may be one of the additional factors which affect the oscillation amplitude in sunspots .",
    "we have carried numerical simulations of the effect of reduced excitation of solar oscillation in sunspot regions .",
    "the oscillations are excited by random sources , modeled as vertical momentum and pressure perturbations ( in reality caused by turbulent convection ) . in sunspot regions ,",
    "the wave sources are weaker because the magnetic field of sunspots inhibits convective motions .",
    "the results of simulations show that for a wide range of sunspot diameters more than a half of suppression of oscillation amplitude can be explained by the absence of acoustic sources in sunspots .",
    "our simulations also showed that the oscillation amplitude in regions of suppressed excitation only weakly depends on the wave damping mechanism in the upper convection zone and atmosphere as long as the line widths in the simulated power spectrum are close to the observed ones .",
    "we modeled wave damping by two methods : introducing a friction - type term into the z - component of the momentum equation and putting the wave absorbing boundary at various heights in the chromosphere . in both cases",
    "we get the similar ratios of oscillation amplitudes . if the acoustic cut - off frequency in sunspots",
    "is reduced this will increase the damping and may lead to even stronger reduction of the wave amplitude compared to the quiet sun ."
