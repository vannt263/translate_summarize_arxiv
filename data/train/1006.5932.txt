    "cataclysmic variables , i.e.  cvs consist of an accreting white dwarf primary and a late - type main sequence star , and accrete via roche lobe overflow .",
    "cvs can be divided into several subclasses of which so called dwarf novae ( dne ) are the most numerous subclass of cvs in our galaxy . in these systems ,",
    "the white dwarf has a weak magnetic field strength ( b @xmath9 10@xmath10 g , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) compared to magnetic cvs , such as polars , and thus the formation of an accretion disc is possible . from time to time , the disc is seen to brighten by several magnitudes lasting from days to several weeks .",
    "this brightening of the disc , i.e. an outburst , is thought to be caused by disc instabilities , which are described in detail in @xcite . in quiescence ,",
    "dne are sources of optical emission emanating from the accretion disc and the bright spot where the material from the secondary hits the edge of the disc .",
    "quiescent optical spectra of dne are characterized by strong balmer emission lines and weaker he i lines with some heavier elements .",
    "also , dne are sources of hard x - rays which are thought to originate from an optically thin boundary layer during quiescence . however , during an outburst hard x - rays are quenched as the boundary layer becomes optically thick and thus a source of soft x - rays and euv emission @xcite .    at the time of the discovery of the galactic ridge x - ray emission ( grxe ) in 1982 @xcite , discrete point sources were thought to be the origin of the grxe emission .",
    "however , the origin has been debated since , but observational evidence gathered to date since the grxe discovery supports the view that the grxe is not due to diffuse origin but due to discrete point sources , such as cvs and other accreting binary systems ( see recent studies by e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "more supporting evidence was given by the recent _ chandra _ study carried out by @xcite who resolved over 80 per cent of the grxe into point sources in the 67 kev energy range during an ultra - deep 1 msec observation .",
    "based on _ exosat _ observations of the x - ray emission in the galactic plane , @xcite concluded that if the grxe is assumed to be originating from discrete point sources , the bulk of the emission observed must be due to a population of low luminosity x - ray sources ( l@xmath11 @xmath12 10@xmath13 erg s@xmath3 ) , such as cvs .",
    "subsequently , @xcite suggested that dne could significantly contribute to the grxe based on their study of an _ exosat _ medium energy ( me ) dn sample . according to this study , the space density of dne is sufficiently high to account for a significant fraction of the grxe .",
    "later on , @xcite resolved sources down to 3 @xmath4 10@xmath14 erg @xmath15 s@xmath3 in their _ chandra _ observation of the galactic ridge , equivalent to @xmath16 @xmath17 2.3 @xmath4 10@xmath2 erg s@xmath3 at 8  kpc , concluding that the number of resolved point sources above this level is insufficient for them to be the major contributor to the grxe .",
    "since these previous works have not completely resolved the contribution of cvs to the grxe , further studies are needed . as was noted by @xcite , unbiased and sensitive surveys with accurate distance measurements of cvs are needed .",
    "this way , accurate x - ray luminosity functions ( xlfs ) can be obtained , and the contribution to the grxe estimated more precisely .",
    "the motivation for our work was mainly given by the inaccuracies in the xlfs of galactic cv populations , such as those by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "baskill et al . derived an xlf using 34 _ asca _ observations of non - magnetic cvs ( including 23 dn observations ) .",
    "their sample lacked accurate distance measurements as only 10 sources had parallax - based distance measurements .",
    "furthermore , this sample was biased by high x - ray flux sources since _ asca _ was intended to be a spectroscopic mission and the sources in the studied sample were known to be x - ray bright . also , the _ asca _ study was purely archival without any sample selection ( e.g. the distance was not limited ) as baskill et al . chose all non - magnetic cv observations in the archive",
    ", they did not filter out sources which were in an outburst state , or restrict the study to one type of objects only .",
    "the xlf study by @xcite focused on building up an xlf in the 210  kev range combining the _ rxte _ slew survey ( xss ) and _ rosat _ all - sky survey ( rass ) observations of active binaries , cvs and young main sequence stars in the luminosity range @xmath0 10@xmath18 @xmath12 @xmath16 @xmath12 10@xmath19 erg s@xmath3 .",
    "however , uncertainties in the luminosities in this study were introduced by inadequate accuracies in the distances , for example , many of the intermediate polars ( ips ) in their sample had poorly known distances . only a few sources had parallax measurements from , e.g. , the hipparcos or tycho catalogues ( astrometric uncertainties @xmath0 1 mas ) and ground - based parallax measurements from @xcite .",
    "in addition , the rass luminosities had 50 per cent uncertainties in addition to statistical errors after conversion from the 0.12.4  kev to the 210  kev range .",
    "the primary aim of this paper is to derive the most accurate shape of the xlf to date by using a carefully selected sample of dne . in order to achieve this",
    ", we aim to minimise the biases seen in other published xlfs by using sample selection criteria described in section  [ sourcesample ] .",
    "one of the criteria worth mentioning here is that we only use parallax - based distance estimates .",
    "the source sample used in this study does not represent a complete sample of dne within 200  pc : the sample is more of a ",
    "fair sample  which was not chosen based on the x - ray properties of the sources , and which represents typical dne within the solar neighbourhood .",
    "we will consider the possible effects of the optical selection , inherent in the parallax sample , on the xlf which we derive in section 6 ( discussion ) .",
    "the motivation for choosing a group of dne as the sample is based on observations of the galactic cv populations and previous cv population models .",
    "various authors , such as @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , have pointed out that binaries which are brighter in x - rays and show frequent outbursts , may not represent the true majority of galactic cv population .",
    "the discovery methods of cvs usually favour brighter systems , and thus fainter cvs with low mass accretion rates are likely to be under - represented .",
    "however , population models of cvs predict that the majority of cvs are short - period systems ( @xmath20 @xmath12 2.5 h ) and x - ray faint ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "these models are supported by observational evidence , e.g. @xcite showed that a sample of cvs with a total space density of 6 @xmath4 10@xmath21 pc@xmath22 was dominated by low mass accretion rate , and thus short period , systems .",
    "also , the sdss study by @xcite showed that orbital periods of intrinsically faint galactic cvs accumulated in the 8086 min range ; they found that 20 out of 30 sdss cvs in this period range showed characteristics which implied that they are low mass accretion rate wz sge type dne .",
    "as has been shown by these studies , less x - ray luminous objects ( such as dne ) dominated the studied volumes , and thus we choose to focus on dne in this paper .",
    "it is also worth mentioning the study by @xcite who carried out the _ rosat _ north ecliptic pole ( nep ) survey using a purely x - ray flux limited and a complete sample of 442 x - ray sources above a flux limit of @xmath0 10@xmath23 erg @xmath15 s@xmath3 in the 0.52.0  kev band ( only five systems were cvs ) .",
    "they concluded that if the overall space density of cvs is as high as 2 @xmath4 10@xmath24 pc@xmath22 , then the dominant cv population must be fainter than 2 @xmath4 10@xmath25 erg s@xmath3 .",
    "we have carried out x - ray spectral analysis of our sample of 13 sources and derived an xlf in the 210 kev band for 12 of them with reliable distance measurements based on those of by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . by using sources with accurate distance measurements ,",
    "we minimise the error on the luminosity .",
    "also , we have carried out timing analysis for 5 sources in the sample which were recently observed by _",
    "suzaku_. at the time of writing this paper , the z cam type star kt per went into an outburst in january 2009 , and thus we also briefly report on the _ suzaku _ observations of kt per during the outburst in section  [ sec : ktper ] .",
    "since we wanted to obtain accurate luminosities for the sources ( and thus an accurate shape for the luminosity function ) , the first step was to avoid selecting sources randomly from the archive ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or selecting an x - ray flux limited source sample .",
    "the aim was to have a _ distance - limited _ sample .",
    "thus , sources were not selected based on their x - ray properties , but we chose only those dne which have accurately measured distances based on trigonometric parallax measurements within @xmath0 200  pc . note that by using all available distance measurement techniques , patterson ( priv . comm . )",
    "estimates that currently there are 13 dne within 100  pc , and @xmath0 33 dne within 200  pc from the sun , of which the latter count is clearly incomplete . above the 200  pc limit",
    ", ground - based parallax technique does not give accurate and reliable distance measurements . by using trigonometric parallax - based distance measurements , we are more likely to avoid biases in the distance measurements which are present in the previous , published x - ray luminosity functions . due to the lack of ground - based parallax measurement programme for the southern hemisphere ,",
    "our sample is limited to northern and equatorial objects .",
    "however , this selection should not introduce any biases in terms of the optical or x - ray luminosities in our sample .",
    "the distance measurements of the sources chosen for this work are based on astrometric parallaxes obtained by the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) fine guidance sensors ( fgss ) @xcite , and trigonometric parallaxes obtained by the ground - based 2.4 m hiltner telescope at the mdm observatory on kitt peak , arizona @xcite and thorstensen ( in prep . ) .",
    "the first accurate astrometric parallaxes of dne ( ss  cyg , ss  aur and u  gem ) were measured in 1999 using the fgss which can deliver high - precision parallaxes with sub - milliarcsecond uncertainties @xcite .",
    "trigonometric parallaxes derived by ground - based observations have uncertainties around 1 mas (= 10@xmath22 arcsec ) or less @xcite which is almost as good as the uncertainty on the fgs parallax measurements .",
    "the second selection criterion was to restrict the sample to sources which had been observed by x - ray imaging telescopes with ccds in the energy range 0.210  kev .",
    "once we had obtained a list of targets with parallax measurements , we then looked for archival data of pointed imaging x - ray observations of these targets in the energy range @xmath0 0.210  kev .",
    "if the chosen targets did not have previous x - ray imaging observations , we requested _ suzaku _ x - ray observations .",
    "finally , we wanted to constrain the sample to those sources which were in their quiescent states during the observations in order to avoid biases in the luminosities , and thus _ aavso _ light curves of the selected sources were inspected to confirm that the sources were in quiescence during the x - ray observations .",
    "the final source sample consists of 9 su  uma ( including 2 wz  sge systems ) , 3 u  gem and 1 z  cam type dne .",
    "the main characteristic which separates these classes of dne is the outburst behaviour : u  gem type dne outburst mainly in timescales of every few weeks to every few months whereas su  uma stars show normal , u  gem type dn outbursts and , in addition , superoutbursts with superhumps ( variations in the light curves at a period of a few per cent longer than the orbital period ) in timescales of several months to years .",
    "the extreme cases , wz  sge stars , only have superoutbursts with outburst timescales of decades without normal dn outbursts .",
    "the defining characteristic for z  cam stars is standstills , i.e. , it is possible that after an outburst , they do not return to the minimum magnitude ( unlike u  gem stars ) , but remain between the minimum and maximum magnitudes for 1040 days .    [",

    "these two results show that there are uncertainties in the integrated luminosities , most likely caused by the small number of sources in the sample . in order to obtain more accurate value for the integrated luminosity ,",
    "the power law slope ( @xmath41 = -0.64 ) should be better established . if the obtained slope is not far from the true power law slope of dne in the solar neighbourhood , estimating the integrated luminosity more accurately and constraining the bright luminosity end ( 10@xmath5 erg s@xmath3 ) requires more dne to be included in the sample . since the source density at @xmath0 10@xmath5",

    "this volume would correspond to a distance of @xmath0 620  pc with a flux limit of @xmath0 3.2 @xmath4 10@xmath131 erg @xmath15 s@xmath3 .    following this",

    "as we estimated the x - ray emissivity of all cvs within 200  pc , we used the exponential vertical density profile    @xmath213    of cvs with a scale height for short period systems ( @xmath198 = 260  pc ) as in @xcite , where @xmath214 = @xmath215 sin @xmath216 is the perpendicular distance from the galactic plane and @xmath216 galactic latitude . integrating eq.[density ] over a sphere with a radius of 200  pc gives @xmath0 280 as the total number of dne within 200  pc .",
    "if the space density of dne follows the space density of cvs as in @xcite , i.e. , @xmath217 = 1.1@xmath218 @xmath4 10@xmath194 pc@xmath22 , and if a typical dn has an x - ray luminosity corresponding to the mean luminosity ( 2 @xmath4 10@xmath2 erg s@xmath3 ) of our sample of 11 sources ( bz  uma excluded ) , then the 210  kev x - ray emissivity of all dne in the solar neighbourhood would be 5.5@xmath219 @xmath4 10@xmath212 erg s@xmath3 m@xmath8 ( these account for the uncertainty on the space density , assuming that this is the dominant source of uncertainty for the x - ray emissivity of dne ) . this would account for more than 100 per cent of the grxe emissivity .",
    "if dne were uniformly distributed in the solar neighbourhood , the x - ray emissivity would be overestimated also in this case ( by 2030 per cent ) .",
    "however , in both cases , one should remember that the calculated x - ray emissivity of all dne within 200  pc is likely overestimated by the brighter sources in our sample , thus the calculations give excess emission .      in order to understand whether the x - ray luminosity and the various parameters ( inclination @xmath220 , orbital period @xmath20 , shock temperature @xmath32 and white dwarf mass @xmath221 ) are correlated , we carried out spearman s rank correlation test . plotting x - ray luminosity versus a few of these parameters ( @xmath220 and @xmath20 ) shows that gw  lib seems to appear as an outlier compared to the rest of the sample ( fig .  [ orb ] and [ incl ] ) .",
    "thus , to explore how the presence / absence of gw  lib affects the test results , two test cases were used : 1 ) gw  lib was included , and 2 ) gw  lib was excluded from the rest of the sample . in addition , we investigated whether a correlation between the white dwarf masses @xmath221 and the shock temperatures @xmath32 ( fig .",
    "[ mass_temp ] ) exists , although in this case , gw  lib seems to follow the rest of the sample , thus , carrying out test case 2 ) was not necessary .",
    "a strong correlation was found at the 99.95 per cent significance level ( 2.8@xmath30 ) between the x - ray luminosities and orbital periods ( fig .",
    "[ orb ] ) when gw  lib is included in the sample .",
    "the correlation still holds when gw  lib is excluded ( significance is 99.67 per cent ) .",
    "@xcite noted that there was a weak correlation between the x - ray luminosities and the orbital periods in their _ asca _ sample , concluding that the x - ray luminosity probably also correlates with long - term mean accretion rate .",
    "the x - ray luminosity and the inclination @xmath220 are not correlated in either case ( fig .",

    "the correlation between these parameters was measured when the inclination of bz  uma was set to 65@xmath29 , and altering the inclination between 60@xmath29 and 75@xmath29 did not affect the result . since no correlation was found , this result is in contrast with the discovery of anti - correlation between the emission measure and inclination found by @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that the _ rosat _ bandpass was very narrow , covering only 0.12.4 kev where the softer x - ray emission ( and more luminous emission ) is probably intrinsically absorbed by the sources . in addition",
    ", an anti - correlation between the x - ray luminosity and inclination was also seen by @xcite in the _ asca _ sample , although , baskill et al . noted that the inclinations might be uncertain , and this can also be the case in our sample .",
    "finally , the white dwarf masses @xmath221 and the shock temperatures @xmath32 correlate with a significance of 98.5 per cent when the mass of vy  aqr is 0.80 m@xmath146 , but becomes less significant ( 97.4 per cent ) if the mass is 0.55 m@xmath146 . of the rest of the parameters , i.e. the x - ray luminosity @xmath16 versus @xmath32 and @xmath221 , @xmath32 showed evidence of correlation with @xmath16 at a significance of 97.6 per cent when gw  lib was included in the sample , but @xmath16 and @xmath221 had a much lower correlation significance ( 69 per cent ) when including gw  lib . for the latter correlation test ( @xmath16 versus @xmath221 ) ,",
    "the result was the same with both @xmath221 values for vy  aqr . excluding gw  lib decreased the significance to 91 per cent ( @xmath16 versus @xmath32 ) and to 63 per cent ( @xmath16 versus @xmath221 ) .",
    "we have analysed the x - ray spectra of 13 dwarf novae with accurate parallax - based distance estimates , and derived the most accurate shape for the x - ray luminosity function of dne in the 210  kev band to date due to accurate distance measurements and due to the fact that we did not use an x - ray selected sample .",

    "the shape of the x - ray luminosity function of the source sample suggests that the two following scenarios are possible : 1 ) the sample can be described by a power law with a single @xmath41 slope , but the sample becomes more incomplete below @xmath0 3 @xmath4 10@xmath1 erg s@xmath3 than it is above this limit , or , 2 ) the shape of the real x - ray luminosity function of dwarf novae is a broken power law with a break at around 3 @xmath4 10@xmath1 erg s@xmath3 .",
