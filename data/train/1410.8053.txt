    "the top quark ( @xmath0 ) is the heaviest known elementary particle , with a mass that is much higher than those of all the other quarks , and close to the masses of the @xmath1 , @xmath2 and higgs bosons .",
    "its large mass means that it decays quickly without forming hadrons , offering the unique opportunity to study the properties of a ` bare ' quark . with its @xmath3 yukawa coupling to the higgs boson",
    ", it may also be closely connected to electroweak symmetry breaking , or offer a window to physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "studies of the properties of the top quark are therefore central to both the lhc and tevatron physics programs .",
    "this review focuses on measurements of the top - pair ( ) production charge asymmetry , and measurements of spin correlation and top polarisation in  events , performed by atlas @xcite and cms @xcite in @xmath48tev @xmath5 collisions at the cern large hadron collider .",
    "other properties of the top quark are covered in other reviews presented to the top2014 conference .",
    "one of the most intriguing legacy results from the tevatron is the   forward - backward asymmetry .",
    "analyses of the angular distributions of top quarks and anti - quarks by cdf and d0 indicate that the top quarks ( antiquarks ) are produced preferentially following the direction of the proton ( antiproton ) beam .",
    "the latest measurements from cdf suggest that the size of this asymmetry is slightly larger than expected in the sm , whilst the measurements from d0 are in agreement with the sm @xcite .",
    "this asymmetry can not be measured at the lhc , as it collides @xmath5 and not , but an analogous  charge asymmetry @xmath6 can be defined by looking at the difference in absolute rapidity values of the produced top quark and antiquark .",
    "the rapidity difference @xmath7 is positive when the top quark is produced at a smaller angle to the beam direction ( large @xmath8 ) than the antiquark , and negative otherwise .",
    "the asymmetry is defined from event counts @xmath9 as : @xmath10 in the sm , this asymmetry is slightly positive for pairs produced via @xmath11 , where interference effects generate a correlation between the direction of the incoming quark and the outgoing top quark , but zero for @xmath12 .",
    "the total resulting asymmetry is an order of magnitude smaller than the tevatron forward - backward asymmetry , _",
    "e.g. _ an nlo qcd calculation including electroweak corrections gives @xmath13 at @xmath4tev  @xcite .",
    "the most precise measurements of @xmath6 come from the semileptonic   final state , in which the @xmath1 boson from one top quark decays to an electron or muon and a neutrino , and the other to a  pair . by selecting events with an isolated electron or muon ,",
    "missing transverse momentum ( ) and at least four jets , atlas and cms both isolate samples of about 60000 events with about 20% non-  background , dominated by @xmath1+jets and single top production .",
    "kinematic fits are used to fully reconstruct the system and determine @xmath14 on an event - by - event basis .",
    "the @xmath14 distribution is then unfolded to correct for background , efficiency and resolution effects , and the inclusive @xmath6 corrected back to the parton level extracted .",
    "the measurements from atlas @xcite and cms @xcite at @xmath4tev  are shown in table  [ t : asym ] , and have been combined @xcite to give a value of @xmath15 , consistent with both zero and the sm prediction .",
    "cms has also measured @xmath6 at @xmath16tev  using a very similar analysis @xcite .",
    ".[t : asym ] measurements of the inclusive  asymmetry @xmath6 and leptonic asymmetry  from atlas @xcite and cms @xcite at @xmath4tev  and @xmath16tev  with their statistical and systematic uncertainties , together with the lhc combination @xcite and corresponding theoretical predictions @xcite . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     both collaborations have also measured @xmath6 differentially , as a function of the rapidity , transverse momentum and invariant mass of the  system .",
    "the latter in particular increases the sensitivity to new physics scenarios , which are expected to be more prominent at high  as shown in figure  [ f : acljets ] .",
    "atlas has also measured the asymmetry for @xmath17 , this cut on the longitudinal velocity of the  system increasing the fraction of @xmath11 events and the potential new physics contributions , but no significant deviations from the sm have been seen .",

    "the semileptonic measurements have a precision of around 1% , not yet precise enough to distinguish between zero and the small non - zero asymmetry expected in the sm .",
    "the dilepton measurements have lower precision , due to the smaller event samples and ambiguities inherent in the dileptonic final state .",
    "the top quark lifetime of about @xmath22s is much shorter than the time required to form hadrons , so the top quark decays as a ` bare ' quark , transferring information on its spin to the decay products . in pair production ,",
    "the polarisation is expected to be negligible , but the spins of the @xmath0 and @xmath23 are correlated , such that the asymmetry in the numbers of events where the @xmath0 and @xmath23 have like and unlike spins , @xmath24 , is non - zero .",
    "the double - differential cross - section in the decay angles of the two top quarks ,  and , is given by : @xmath25 where the asymmetry parameter @xmath26 is scaled by the spin - analysing power of the chosen top quark decay products , and  and are the cosines of the angles between the top quark decay product and the chosen polarisation axis .",
    "normally the helicity basis is used , in which the polarisation is measured using the direction of the top quark momentum in the  rest frame . the spin - analysing power @xmath27 is @xmath28 for positively - charged leptons , @xmath29 for down quarks from the @xmath1 decay , and -0.393 for @xmath30 quarks from the top decay .",
    "measurement of the  spin correlations using the above formalism requires the full reconstruction of the  system , using techniques similar to those used in the charge asymmetry measurement .",
    "they have been measured at @xmath4tev   by cms in dilepton events @xcite ( see figure  [ f : cmspol ] ( left ) ) , and by atlas in both dileptonic and semileptonic events @xcite , using both the helicity basis and the so - called maximal basis which is particularly sensitive to correlations in the @xmath12 subprocess .",

    "both collaborations exploited this variable to demonstrate the existence of spin correlations in @xmath4tev  data .",
    "the cms analysis @xcite unfolded the  distribution to parton level , correcting for background , acceptance and resolution effects , and compared the result to simulation predictions with and without spin correlations as predicted by the sm ( see figure  [ f : spdphi ] ( left ) ) .",
    "the level of spin correlation was quantified from the asymmetry of the parton - level  distribution about @xmath33 as @xmath34 , in agreement with the nlo prediction of 0.115 .",
    "atlas @xcite instead compared the detector - level   distribution to fully - simulated events with and without spin correlation , quantifying the spin correlation strength with a fit to sm - like correlated and uncorrelated simulation - derived templates .",
    "the fitted fraction of correlated template  was measured to be @xmath35 , compatible with unity . at the conference ,",
    "atlas presented a new analysis using the   distribution at @xmath16tev  @xcite with an optimised dilepton event selection having higher efficiency ; as shown in figure  [ f : spdphi ] ( right ) , this is also compatible with the sm expectation , with a fitted @xmath36 , corresponding to a spin correlation strength in the helicity basis of @xmath37 .",
    "the  distribution can also be used to set limits on new physics contributions within the selected  event sample , for example top squark pair production as shown by atlas @xcite , or an anomalous -gluon interaction parameterised as a chromomagnetic dipole moment as explored by cms @xcite .",

    "atlas also measured the top polarisation in both dilepton and semileptonic events , looking for polarisation effects which polarise the @xmath0 and @xmath23 quarks with the same ( cp - conserving ) or opposite ( cp - violating ) signs , and again found results compatible with zero @xcite .",
    "the lhc data have already produced a wealth of top quark property measurements , so far mainly at @xmath4tev .",
    "top - pair charge asymmetry measurements are reaching 1% precision , and the inclusion of the full @xmath16tev  dataset may allow the small non - zero expected asymmetry to be observed .",
    "no hints of deviations in either the inclusive or differential asymmetries have been seen , strongly constraining various new physics scenarios .",
    "the expected  spin correlations have been clearly observed at both @xmath4tev  and @xmath16tev , and the top quark polarisation in  events has been seen to be consistent with the expectation of zero within about 2% .",
    "many of these measurements are limited by systematics , and advances in  modelling or new analysis techniques will be needed to fully exploit the @xmath16tev  dataset .",
    "this will be even more important in the upcoming @xmath3814tev run , which in particular will allow top charge asymmetry measurements to be pushed to sub - percent precision and extended to higher  invariant masses ."
