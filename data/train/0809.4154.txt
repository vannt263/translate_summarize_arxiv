    "<S> at the end of 2008 , the large hadron collider ( lhc ) will come into operation and the two experiments atlas and cms will start taking data from proton - proton collisions at a center - of - mass energy of @xmath0 . in preparation for the data taking period , </S>",
    "<S> the discovery potential for higgs bosons beyond the standard model has been updated by both experiments and is reviewed here . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the prospects for measuring the properties of a higgs boson like its mass and width , its cp eigenvalues and its couplings to fermions and gauge bosons are discussed . </S>"
