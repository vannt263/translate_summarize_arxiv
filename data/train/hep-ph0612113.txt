    "the in - medium properties of vector mesons have long been considered a tool to observe chiral symmetry restoration experimentally . in order to provide",
    "the medium , decays of vector mesons produced in heavy - ion collisions have to be studied , and there is a long history of model calculations and measurements @xcite .",
    "so far , the experimentally accessible quantity has been the invariant mass @xmath0 spectrum of dileptons , a quantity in which the in - medium spectral function , averaged over the evolution history of the medium , is reflected .    with the na60 high precision dimuon measurement @xcite it has become clear that the averaged in - medium spectral function in the vector channel shows broadening of the @xmath3 meson and no significant mass shift @xcite .",
    "while it is difficult to establish this broadening as an unambiguous signal for chiral symmetry restoration , a suggestion has been made in @xcite that dilepton emission in the invariant mass region above 0.9 gev might be dominated by @xmath4 processes if a considerable chiral mixing of vector and axial vector correlators is assumed . on the other hand , in @xcite we found that this region is dominated by partonic radiation .",
    "thus , a tool to further characterize the emission region dominating a particular region in the invariant mass spectrum is clearly important before more definite conclusions can be drawn .",
    "recently , na60 has presented measurements of transverse momentum @xmath1 spectra in three different mass bins @xcite .",
    "this allows to study dimuon emission as a function of two scales @xmath0 and @xmath1 with different properties . while @xmath0 is invariant under lorentz transformations and the invariant mass spectrum is hence ( apart from detector acceptance effects ) insensitive to collective flow of the medium , @xmath1-spectra are heavily influenced by flow .    the importance of collective flow for the description of hadronic @xmath1 spectra in heavy - ion collisions has been realized a long time ago ( cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite ) . for experimental results from the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) in brookhaven ,",
    "the analysis of both single hadron spectra and two - particle correlations in terms of thermal spectra subject to a flow field has been extremely fruitful to characterize the final state of the evolution @xcite .",
    "extension of the method to a parametrization of the full evolution instead of the final state has been demonstrated to give a good characterization of spectra and two - particle correlations at both sps 158 agev fixed target pb - pb collisions @xcite and rhic 200 agev au - au collisions @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we use the same techniques , adapted to the different nature of electromagnetic emission processes , to characterize the emission region dominating the @xmath1-spectra in the different mass bins measured by na60 .",
    "conceptually , this is similar to the ideas outlined in @xcite where elliptic flow is instead suggested to characterize the emission region .",
    "our model for dilepton emission in inin collisions is outlined in @xcite , here we reproduce the essential details as far as needed to understand the flow analysis .",
    "we calculate the dilepton spectrum from the convolution    @xmath5    where the rate is found from the averaged virtual photon spectral function @xmath6 as    @xmath7    here , @xmath8 represent the four - momentum of the emitted muon pair , @xmath9 is the temperature of the emitting volume element and @xmath10 its baryon density .",
    "the finite lepton mass @xmath11 can be accounted for by an additional factor of @xmath12 in eq .",
    "( [ e - rate ] ) .",
    "the fireball evolution encodes information on the evolution of radiating volume , temperature @xmath9 and baryon chemical potential @xmath13 , local transverse flow velocity @xmath14 , longitudinal rapidity @xmath15 and in the late evolution stage chemical non - equilibrium properties such as pion chemical potential @xmath16 and kaon chemical potential @xmath17 .",
    "the model considers matter with a transverse entropy density @xmath18 distribution @xmath19\\right)\\ ] ] where @xmath20 . onto this distribution , a transverse flow field @xmath21",
    "is imposed with @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath23 is the final velocity at radius @xmath24 at freeze - out .",
    "note that this is not the maximal velocity reached at the system s surface : the surface is dynamically calculated from the local entropy density and the equation of state via the condition @xmath25 . at @xmath26 , a thermalized system exists only close to @xmath27 and @xmath28 is outside the thermalized region . since the position of the cooper - frye surface changes in a non - trivial way the model can not completely be characterized by one number for the flow .",
    "we have also investigated flow fields with dependences @xmath29 and @xmath30 which are suitably normalized such as to lead to hadronic @xmath1 spectra with the same slope as the form eq .",
    "( [ e - flow ] ) ( see @xcite for details about the calculation of hadronic emission from the model ) .",
    "let us recall the role of transverse flow : the factor @xmath31 in eq .",
    "( [ e - rate ] ) evaluates for a process at midrapidity to @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the angle between flow direction and dilepton momentum and @xmath34 the energy of a virtual photon measured with @xmath35 as it appears in the local restframe of a fluid element with radial rapidity @xmath36 . for a particular choice of flow field and transverse density distribution and a boltzmann distribution instead of the rate @xmath37 in eq .",
    "( [ e - rate ] ) ( as appropriate for hadrons ) , the spatial integral of the convolution of the flow field with density yields analytical expressions for the spectrum @xcite , however we solve the integral numerically .",
    "it can be seen as a general property of eq .",
    "( [ e - trafo ] ) that the resulting effect on the spectral slope will in general be @xmath1 dependent .",
    "this is apparent from the two limiting cases @xmath38 where the equation becomes @xmath39 and @xmath40 where one finds @xmath41 $ ] for @xmath42 and @xmath43 $ ] for @xmath44 .",
    "it is well known that the effect of flow makes the spectral slope harder , in the case of large masses and flow values even leading to a flattening of the spectrum , the knee seen e.g. for protons @xcite .",
    "this hardening of the slope is mass dependent as long as @xmath1 is of the order of @xmath0 .",
    "the slope of a spectum in the model thus arises as follows : the temperature @xmath9 in eq .",
    "( [ e - rate ] ) sets the basic scale possibly modified by the momentum ( and density ) dependence of the spectral function @xmath45 .",
    "we point out that the modifications of the @xmath1-slope due to this dependence are small for all investigated thermal sources , namely for the in - medium hadronic sources ( in - medium vector mesons and four - pion annihilation ) as well as for the partonic source .    in the absence of flow ,",
    "a dilepton @xmath1 spectrum at given @xmath0 arises from a superposition of contributions from different @xmath9 , weighted by the volume radiating into the acceptance at this temperature .",
    "since @xmath9 drops as a result of volume expansion , this means that the low @xmath9 spectra will typically contribute more to the @xmath1 integrated yield as long as @xmath0 is sufficiently small , thus adding all contributions the low @xmath1 region will be dominated by late , low @xmath9 emission whereas at larger @xmath1 the harder slopes of earlier emission from hotter regions will gradually become visible .",
    "the presence of a flow field changes this picture somewhat : since @xmath9 and flow are anticorrelated in the model ( initially @xmath9 is large and @xmath36 small , at late times the relation is reversed ) , there is no cold emission source without flow distortion in the model , but hot emission regions are unaffected by flow . for a single temperature , the flow effect leads to a @xmath1-dependent hardening of the spectrum .",
    "this blueshift becomes maximal at some @xmath1 ( dependent on the values of @xmath0 and @xmath36 ) , the knee , and then drops again .",
    "the final @xmath1 spectrum arises as the integral over all volume elements with different temperatures and blueshift values , i.e. the knee position is averaged and the @xmath1-dependent sequence of hardening - softening of the slope indicating a knee becomes invisible .",
    "the general feature that the soft slopes dominate at low @xmath1 whereas the hardest slope becomes visible at high @xmath1 returns instead ( this is , in fact , the major difference of e.m .",
    "spectral slopes as compared to hadronic spectral slopes where only contributions from a narrow temperature region need to be considered ) .",
    "the model also imposes a longitudinal flow field , however since it has little relevance for the slope of @xmath1 spectra we do not discuss it further , the interested reader is referred to @xcite .",
    "the na60 collaboration has measured @xmath1 spectra in three different invariant mass windows : a low mass window with 0.4 gev @xmath46 0.6 gev , the @xmath3-like region with 0.6 gev @xmath47 0.9 gev and the high mass region 1.0 gev @xmath47 1.4 gev .",
    "while our model as outlined in @xcite has predicted the general systematics and order of magnitude of the @xmath1 slopes surprisingly well @xcite just based on scaling relations from pb - pb collisions to the smaller in - in system @xcite , in the following we do the following minor readjustments to improve agreement with data : for the flow field , we use a dependence @xmath30 instead of eq .",
    "( [ e - flow ] ) .",
    "in addition , we increase the ( unphysical ) parameter @xmath48 to @xmath49 such that the maximum flow at reached at the medium surface close to @xmath26 is about 0.57 @xmath50 . the overall change in the spectral slopes as compared to the results presented in @xcite are less than 5% .",
    "let us start the discussion with the @xmath3-like mass region . here",
    ", the invariant mass spectra show a clear peak with vacuum width which has been identified with @xmath3 mesons decaying after thermal decoupling of the hot matter in vacuum @xcite .",
    "if so , the spectral slope of this contribution should coincide with the spectral slope of a hadronic spectrum at the @xmath3 mass .",
    "however , in both analyses @xcite the vacuum contribution does not dominate the yield in the invariant mass window .",
    "we may however note that the vacuum contribution is expected to reflect a maximal amount of flow ( and hence hardest slope ) , as it arises from the three - dimensional boundary region of the thermalized four - volume and the flow field is always largest at the edges .",
    "thus , even if this contribution does not dominate when integrated over @xmath1 , at sufficiently high @xmath1 it should .",
    "if so , the slope at sufficiently high @xmath1 can be estimated using a phenomenological formula from @xcite .",
    "there it was shown that the systematics of hadronic spectra at different mass can be described roughly by a fit of the form    @xmath51\\ ] ]    where    @xmath52    with @xmath53 the mass of the hadron in question , @xmath54 the apparent spectral slope and @xmath9 the true temperature of the emission region at freeze - out . within reasonable limits",
    ", this formula reproduces the more microscopic considerations of e.g. @xcite quite well .",
    "averaging our flow profile over the fireball breakup time and evaluating this relation , we find @xmath55 mev , i.e. a rather hard spectrum .",
    "however , this is in fact not far from the experimentally observed value , given the simple estimate we have made .",
    "we take the fact that a peak with vacuum @xmath3 width is observed and that the @xmath1 spectrum in this region approaches the expected value with increasing @xmath1 as a strong indication that the data indeed show the vacuum @xmath3 . a decomposition into different sources of the theoretical prediction of the @xmath1-spectrum integrated over 0.6 gev @xmath47 0.9 gev mass region indeed shows that the vacuum-@xmath3 contribution is the dominant source for @xmath56 gev .",
    "this puts severe limits on the flow field close to @xmath26 , and by backward extrapolation of the transverse and longitudinal flow fields also on somewhat earlier times .",
    "we present the full calculation of both spectrum and effective temperature @xmath54 as extracted from a local fit of the spectra to the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ e - teff ] ) in all three mass windows compared with the data in fig .",
    "[ f - ptcomp ] .",
    "as can be seen , the calculation with the flow field constrained by the vacuum rho decay describes the spectra in general well except in the low @xmath1 region with @xmath57 gev .",
    "let us discuss the three mass windows in turn : both the low mass and the @xmath3 like region receive their dominant contribution in our model from the late hadronic evolution phase , i.e. from regions with temperatures @xmath58 mev .",
    "this implies that the blueshift of the spectra by flow is large  it amounts to about 70 - 80 mev and is hence even substantially larger than the variation of the actual temperature in the hadronic phase which is only 40 mev . in particular",
    ", it is substantially larger than the uncertainty introduced by the choice of the proper @xmath1 dependence of the spectral function in the hadronic phase  even a drastic change like neglecting _ any _ @xmath1 dependence of the spectral function does not lead to more than 10 mev change in slope .",
    "the difference between the low mass and the @xmath3 like - region is essentially caused by the contribution of the vacuum @xmath3 which receives the maximum amount of flow ( see above ) .",
    "in contrast ( as also apparent from @xmath54 ) the high mass bin is in our calculation dominated by partonic radiation .",
    "this predominantly takes place before the transverse flow field grows large and hence @xmath54 in this momentum window approximately reflects the true temperature of the system .",
    "the model results for @xmath54 as a function of @xmath0 are shown in fig .",
    "[ f - mdep ] .",
    "the prominent role of the vacuum rho contribution is clearly apparent from this figure .",
    "as apparent from fig .",
    "[ f - ptcomp ] , the model fails to reproduce the low @xmath1 region in all three mass bins .",
    "experimentally , values of @xmath54 as low as @xmath59 mev are observed . recalling that applying a flow field to a @xmath1 spectrum leads to a blueshift , i.e. higher apparent temperature , we may thus characterize the source radiating into the low @xmath1 region as having a temperature @xmath60 mev and no strong flow .",
    "the strict anticorrelation of @xmath9 and @xmath36 in any hydrodynamically motivated model makes it appear very questionable that this could be a thermal source . a similar softening of the low @xmath1 slope",
    "is observed e.g. in pion spectra and could there be ascribed to resonance decays @xcite , although it is at present unclear what decay process could be responsible for the source dominating the low @xmath1 region in the dimuon spectra .",
    "since it can clearly be demonstrated that a thermal description of a flowing medium can not possible describe the source properly , we will not address the region of @xmath57 gev in the following discussion .",
    "while the data seem to support our idea that the mass region above @xmath61 gev is dominated by partonic radiation , the question remains if a hadronic description would not likewise be possible .",
    "we will address this question by requiring that the correlation of @xmath36 and @xmath9 must be kept such that the low mass and @xmath3-like region are described properly .",
    "given this constraint , we ask what source characteristics are compatible with the measured slope .    note that the fact that @xmath54 is lowest in the high mass region is far from trivial : if the source radiating into high masses were characterized by similar average temperature and flow as the source in the other mass bins , the slope would be expected to be hardest as the blueshift of spectra in a flow field increases with mass ( see eqs .",
    "( [ e - trafo],[e - pocket ] ) ) .",
    "in fact , if the source had the same average emission temperature , we would expect @xmath62 mev given our flow field .",
    "thus , it is evident that there must be a transition to a qualitatively different source .",
    "assuming that the dominant source is hadronic , @xmath63 mev , but not close to @xmath64 ( see above ) we can next ask how big a window in @xmath9 with associated changes in the flow field one can allow before the low mass and the @xmath3-like mass bins can not be described any more by the model .",
    "we find that the region from 170 down to 160 mev is in principle compatible with the data , the region down to 150 mev is marginally compatible , but the source can not dominate the high mass yield for @xmath65 mev , otherwise the strong flow field ( required by the lower mass bins which are dominated by emission from this temperature ) pushes @xmath54 above the data .",
    "thus , if four - pion annihilation processes were the dominante source like suggested in @xcite they would have to cease contributing rather suddenly around @xmath66 mev .    employing this argument solely based on the @xmath1-slope of the di - muon spectrum , one can not rule out that the high mass radiation comes dominantly from a hadronic source with temperatures in the range of 150 mev @xmath67 170 mev , although a substantial amount of fine - tuning of the source is required for this assumption .",
    "however , assuming that such a fine - tuning is performed , the measured slope can not be described by a hadronic source without flow , instead a substantial flow of order @xmath68 is needed .",
    "such transverse flow indicates a precursor state which can not be a mixed phase of a 1st order phase transition ( as no flow is built up from a mixed phase ) .",
    "thus , even if the radiation in the high mass window would be of hadronic origin , its slope still points towards a partonic evolution before .",
    "further constraints can be derived if the fact is taken into account that four - pion annihilation can have strong contributions to the yield from emissions at temperatures close to @xmath69 mev due to the growing fugacity factor @xmath70 $ ] with smaller @xmath9 . in an explicit calculation with such a dimuon source , we employed thermal four - pion annihiliation rates as calculated in the approach @xcite .",
    "this approach is constrained e.g. by the most recent babar data @xcite on the inverse process in the vacuum , namely lepton annihilation into four - pions .",
    "the calculation indeed shows that even if fine - tuning of the source is performed to enforce compatibility of @xmath54 with the @xmath1-slope data in the higher mass window , the di - muon yield from these processes is not enough to account for the absolute yield as observed in the mass region for @xmath711.0 gev assuming these were the dominant source @xcite .",
    "we point out that this investigation only implies that the _ dominant _ source in the @xmath711.0 gev region can not be four - pion annihilation processes .",
    "it is still possible that these processes contribute subdominantly to the @xmath72 gev dimuon yield in that region of the mass spectrum .",
    "a careful analysis of the quantitative strength of such a possible subdominant contribution of four - pion annihilation processes to the spectrum has also to account for the fact that multiparticle annihilation processes can be expected ( due to their @xmath73 dependence on the pion density @xmath74 ) to decouple earlier than two particle annihilation . even taking fugacity factors into account",
    ", @xmath74 in the calculation drops by more than a factor two from @xmath75 to @xmath64 .",
    "while common modelling assumptions treat all processes in kinetic equilibrium down to the same decoupling temperature @xmath64 , the experimental findings of momentum equilibration can be accounted for by @xmath76 processes alone , and more microscopic descriptions of the freeze - out process ( e.g. hadronic cascades as in @xcite ) show a sequencial decoupling of different processes . assuming full equilibrium for multipion annihilation down to @xmath64 thus constitutes an upper limit for the expected contribution .",
    "further detailed analysis of multipion annihilation is beyond the scope of the present paper , and will be presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we have performed an analysis of the @xmath1 spectra by dimuons based on a picture of thermalized matter expanding with a given flow field that has been rather succesful in the analysis of hadronic spectra .",
    "the essentail features of the spectra can be understood from thermal scale and blueshift by flow , thus our results do not crucially depend on details how hadronic or partonic emission is modelled . requiring that the same flow field and the same @xmath77 anticorrelation underlies all relevant sources ,",
    "we have argued that the high mass region 1.0 gev @xmath78 gev is most likely dominated by a partonic phase .    while considerable fine - tuning of the model in principle allows for a hadronic source at @xmath9 close to the phase boundary @xmath75 in this region ,",
    "the implication is still that substantial flow is needed to blueshift such a source close to the data which can only arise from a pre - hadronic phase different from a mixed phase . in a thermalized description , this implies partonic evolution .",
    "we furthermore have explicilty excluded four - pion annihilation contributions as such a _ dominant _ hadronic source since its dimuon yield would not be sufficient to account solely for the observed yield in the mass spectrum above @xmath79 gev even if the fine - tuning to account for the @xmath1-spectra s slope is performed .",
    "this does not exclude four - pion annihilation as a subdominant component in the spectrum .",
    "an interpretation of the high mass dilepton radiation in terms of a dominant partonic source seems more natural , as a partonic evolution before hadronic radiation is required by the data in any case .",
    "we would like to thank s.  damjanovic and h.  specht for interesting discussions and encouragement to do this investigation .",
    "we also thank peter lichard for providing his calculations of four - pion annihilation rates and together with charles gale for interesting discussions .",
    "this work was financially supported by the academy of finland , project 206024 , and by the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada ."
