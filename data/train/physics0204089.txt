    "over the past 15 years , the path integral monte carlo ( pimc ) method has evolved into a uniquely powerful computational tool for the study of bulk and finite quantum systems . in pimc ,",
    "one is interested in computing the thermal average of a quantum observable @xmath1 at a given temperature @xmath2 , which can be expressed with respect to the thermal density matrix @xmath3 : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a point in the @xmath6dimensional configuration space of an @xmath7-particle system , @xmath8 is the hamiltonian , and @xmath9 . here",

    "( [ eq : pathint ] ) can in principle be evaluated by standard monte carlo integration schemes , _",
    "i.e. _  by taking an average of @xmath11 over the configurations @xmath12 sampled from the probability distribution @xmath13",
    ". however , the full density matrix of an interacting @xmath7-particle quantum system is generally not known at low temperatures .",
    "therefore one needs to resort to the discrete representation of the feynman path integral formula for a low - temperature density matrix , which will be discussed in detail in section  [ sec : theory ] .",
    "the finite - temperature nature of pimc makes this a complementary approach to zero - temperature monte carlo methods , such as variational monte carlo , or green s function - based methods such as diffusion monte carlo , which are reviewed in chapter  1 of this volume .",
    "@xcite pimc is currently the only numerical method capable of directly addressing finite - temperature superfluidity and the superfluid transition in helium .",
    "in addition , unlike the zero - temperature methods , pimc does not require the use of a trial function , requiring as input only the particle masses , numbers , and interaction potentials , in addition to the temperature and volume .",
    "consequently , it is a numerically exact technique , and is independent of the trial function bias problems that zero - temperature methods may suffer from .",
    "however , because pimc provides thermodynamic averages , state - specific information is generally not available .",
    "although in principle the density matrix contains information on the full eigenspectrum of the hamiltonian @xmath8 , extracting this requires the numerical inversion of a laplace transform .",
    "@xcite@xmath14@xcite such inversions are known to be notoriously difficult in the presence of monte carlo noise .",
    "thus , to date , path integral monte carlo has provided only very limited dynamical information of a direct nature .",
    "nevertheless , it has provided critical microscopic input into dynamical models for physical systems in helium droplets , and in conjunction with zero - temperature , state - specific calculations for these finite helium systems , pimc has proven to be a powerful means of investigating the dynamic consequences of atomic scale structure of a superfluid .",
    "@xcite    feynman first applied the path integral approach to liquid helium in 1953 , and provided a consistent clarification of the role of bose permutation symmetry in the lambda transition of liquid helium .",
    "@xcite in feynman s original treatment , the multidimensional integrals of eq .",
    "( [ eq : pathint ] ) were approximated analytically . in the late 1980 s , ceperley and pollock subsequently devised a monte carlo scheme for the exact numerical evaluation of these multidimensional integrals , in which the combined configuration and permutation spaces were efficiently sampled using a multilevel metropolis method .",
    "@xcite this allowed direct quantitative application of feynman s path integral approach to the superfluid state of helium for the first time .",
    "since then , the pimc method has been applied to provide a quantitative description of numerous bulk and finite bosonic systems .",
    "in addition to extensive studies of bulk helium , pimc has now been employed in the study of @xmath0he/@xmath15he mixtures ,  @xcite of helium and molecular hydrogen droplets ,  @xcite and of helium and hydrogen films on various surfaces .",
    "@xcite in this work , we focus on the application of pimc to quantum simulations of finite helium clusters , @xmath0he@xmath16 . since we are primarily concerned with the bosonic isotope of helium , for the remainder of the chapter",
    ", we will denote @xmath0he as simply he , unless explicitly stated .",
    "the field of helium cluster research has grown very rapidly over recent years due to new possibilities of inserting molecular probes and studying their properties .",
    "@xcite an overview of the experimental work in this area is provided in chapter 9 of this volume . accompanying this rise in experimental studies ,",
    "there has been a correspondingly increased demand for complementary theoretical study of these finite quantum systems .",
    "the earliest pimc simulation of pure he@xmath16 droplets , made in 1989 , demonstrated superfluid behavior for sizes @xmath7 as small as 64 .",
    "@xcite this result , together with zero - temperature calculations of the size scaling for pure cluster excitation spectra made at that time ,  @xcite was taken to be strong theoretical evidence that these finite - sized clusters were indeed superfluid .",
    "this was later confirmed experimentally , through a series of elegant experiments with impurity - doped helium clusters .",
    "@xcite doped clusters present additional technical challenges for pimc beyond the requirements posed by a finite cluster of pure he@xmath16 .",
    "early pimc work with doped clusters addressed the widely studied he@xmath16sf@xmath17 system .",
    "@xcite these studies showed that the global superfluid fraction appeared not to be significantly modified by introduction of an impurity .",
    "however , it soon became apparent that interesting new local features due to bose exchange symmetry were present in the immediate vicinity of an impurity .",
    "this led to the recognition that a local non - superfluid density could be induced by the molecular interaction with helium .",
    "@xcite pimc simulations of doped clusters have now been made with a variety of impurities , including ocs , hcn , benzene , h@xmath18 , neutral and ionic alkali atoms , and some complexes of these molecules .",
    "as will be outlined here , these studies have revealed a broad range of properties of the dopant as well as insight into the dopant influence on the superfluid properties of the droplets .",
    "key features that have emerged from these studies of doped droplets are the ability to analyze superfluid behavior in nanoscale dimensions , to characterize quantum solvation in a superfluid , and to probe the atomic - scale behavior of a superfluid near a molecular interface .    in this review ,",
    "we first provide an overview of the feynman path integral formalism for quantum statistical thermodynamics in section  [ sec : theory ] .",
    "following this introduction , we discuss the pimc implementation of the general feynman theory , focusing in particular on the multilevel metropolis sampling method of ceperley and pollock .",
    "we then review applications of the pimc method to the study of pure helium droplets , and of doped helium clusters containing atomic or molecular impurities in section  [ sec : app ] .",
    "the analysis of superfluidity in finite droplets , and concepts of nanoscale superfluids and local superfluidity are described in section  [ subsec : nsfluid ] .",
    "pimc applications to spectroscopic studies of doped helium clusters are summarized in section  [ sec : spectra ] .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : conclude ] with a summary of open questions .",
    "here we deal with a cluster of @xmath7 he atoms doped with a single impurity . in many of the studies made to date , the impurity is assumed to be fixed at the origin without either translational or rotational motion .",
    "neglect of the impurity translational degrees of freedom is not essential , but for impurity particles which are heavy relative to a helium atom , it is reasonable and often convenient to ignore the translational motion of the impurity .",
    "however , the neglect of the impurity rotational degrees of freedom should be treated with caution , especially for impurities with small principal moments of inertia .",
    "incorporation of the rotational motion of the impurity is an area of current work .",
    "hence for the present discussion we consider the following system hamiltonian @xmath8 : @xmath19 where @xmath20 , with @xmath21 being the helium mass .",
    "the potential energy @xmath22 includes a sum of he - he pair potentials , @xmath23 , and he - impurity interactions @xmath24 , where the latter are most readily given in the molecular frame . if necessary , _ e.g. _ for light molecules , the impurity translational degrees of freedom can be incorporated by adding an additional term @xmath25 , corresponding to the impurity center - of - mass kinetic energy .    in the path integral",
    "approach , one uses the identity @xmath26 to express the low - temperature density matrix by an integral over all possible _ paths _ , @xmath27 , with the weight for each path given by the product of density matrices at a higher temperature @xmath28 : @xmath29 here @xmath30 constitutes the imaginary _ time step _ defining the discrete representation of the path integral .",
    "for a sufficiently high temperature @xmath31 or , equivalently , for a small enough time step @xmath32 , there exist several approximations to the density matrix that are sufficiently accurate for this factorization to be used in numerical work .",
    "@xcite the simplest of these high - temperature approximations is the _ primitive _ approximation , which is based upon the trotter formula :  @xcite @xmath33 the potential energy operator @xmath22 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) is diagonal in the position representation , @xmath34 while the kinetic term corresponds to the free particle density matrix : @xmath35 from eqs .",

    "( [ eq : primitive ] ) may be viewed as a classical configuration integral , with the exponent of its integrand corresponding to an energy function . the first term in the exponent , derived from the kinetic energy , corresponds to a spring potential that connects beads representing the same atom at successive imaginary times , with coupling constant @xmath44 .",
    "this chain of beads connected by springs is often referred to as a _",
    "polymer_.  @xcite the helium - helium interaction is represented by an inter - polymer potential that has non - zero interactions only between beads located on different polymers and indexed by the same imaginary time value .",
    "this corresponds to feynman s original idea of mapping path integrals of a quantum system onto interacting classical polymers , with a special form of polymer interaction potential .",
    "@xcite in the absence of kinetic contributions from the impurity , the helium - impurity interaction acts as an additional external field for the helium atoms , and hence for these polymers .",
    "the thermal density matrix @xmath45 can be expanded in terms of the eigenvalues @xmath46 and the corresponding eigenfunctions @xmath47 of the hamiltonian @xmath8 : @xmath48 this is appropriate for a system of distinguishable particles under boltzmann statistics . for a bose system",
    "such as he or para - h@xmath18 , it should be symmetrized with respect to particle exchanges .",
    "this can be done by modifying the sum in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dmatrix ] ) to a sum over exchange - symmetrized stationary states @xmath49 only : @xmath50 a symmetrized eigenfunction @xmath51 can be obtained by summing a stationary wavefunction of distinguishable particles , @xmath52 , over all @xmath7-particle permutations @xmath53 :  @xcite @xmath54 inserting eq .",

    "( [ eq : symmsum ] ) , we obtain the symmetrized density matrix for a bose system : @xmath55      in order to make pimc calculations more tractable , one wishes to use the smallest possible number of time slices @xmath56 for a given temperature @xmath2 .",
    "this means that it is essential to find accurate high - temperature density matrices at as _ small _ a value @xmath31 as possible , so that the imaginary time step @xmath32 be kept as _",
    "large _ as possible .",
    "it has been found that for the helium - helium interaction , the primitive approximation described in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : prima])([eq : kinact ] ) is accurate enough at temperatures higher than @xmath571000  k.  @xcite this implies that a pimc simulation at @xmath58  k , where the spectroscopic measurements for the impurity - doped helium clusters have been performed ,  @xcite would require several thousands of time slices .",
    "this computational expense can be avoided by going beyond the primitive approximation to a more sophisticated approximation for the high - temperature density matrices .",
    "based on the feynman - kac formula ,  @xcite the high - temperature density matrix @xmath59 can be approximated by a product of the free particle propagator @xmath60 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : kinact ] ) and an interaction term @xmath61 : @xmath62 the interaction term @xmath61 is in turn factored into contributions deriving from the helium - helium and helium - impurity interactions , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , respectively . for spherical interactions",
    ", one can generate a pair - product form of the exact two - body density matrices using a matrix squaring approach discussed in detail in ref .  .",
    "we use this for the helium - helium interaction , which is spherically symmetric .",
    "such helium - helium density matrices of the pair - product form have been shown to be accurate for @xmath65  k , _ i.e. _ , @xmath66  k.  @xcite this same approach can be used for the helium - impurity interaction when this is also isotropic . however , for molecules the helium - impurity interaction @xmath67 is in general not isotropic , and may involve complicated three - dimensional dependencies .",
    "this can be dealt with in several ways .",
    "one approach is to expand the helium - impurity interaction in spherical terms and then employ pair - product forms as above .",
    "we have found it convenient to work within the primitive approximation for the helium - impurity interaction , which allows considerable flexibility when changing impurities .",
    "the required time step for the accurate primitive helium - impurity density matrices varies , depending on the impurity molecule involved ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath68  k for he - sf@xmath17 and he - ocs , @xmath69  k for he - benzene ) .",
    "this must be recalibrated , _",
    "e.g. _ , by establishing converged helium densities , for every new molecule that is studied . the same re - calibration requirement holds also for spherical expansions .      for a diagonal operator @xmath1 in the position representation , @xmath70",
    ", we need to consider only the diagonal density matrices for evaluation of its thermal average , eq .",
    "( [ eq : pathint ] ) . for the diagonal density matrix , both the sum over permutations in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bosedm ] ) and the multidimensional integration in eq .",
    "( [ eq : convol ] ) can be evaluated by a sampling of discrete paths which end on a permutation of their starting positions , _ i.e. _ , @xmath71 with @xmath72 .",
    "this gives rise to an isomorphic mapping onto _ ring _ polymers .",
    "in fact , all physical quantities discussed in this review can be estimated from a set of stochastically sampled ring polymers .    in the sampling process",
    ", it will be natural to choose the probability density function as @xmath73 the metropolis algorithm , a widely - used monte carlo sampling technique , provides a route to obtain the converged distribution @xmath74 in the limit of many sampled configurations , as long as the detailed balance condition is satisfied for transitions between successive configurations : @xmath75 here @xmath76 is the transition probability from a configuration @xmath77 to @xmath78 .",
    "this is factorized into an _ a  priori _ sampling distribution @xmath79 and an acceptance ratio @xmath80 : @xmath81    in order to speed up convergence times in a path integral simulation , in particular one involving permutation moves , it is very important to select an appropriate distribution function @xmath79 for a trial move @xmath78 from @xmath77 . the most efficient way of doing this is the multilevel metropolis algorithm developed by pollock and ceperley .",
    "@xcite here one first chooses end points of each path by sampling a permutation @xmath82 .",
    "then the paths are bisected and the configurations at the midpoints sampled .",
    "this process of bisection and midpoint sampling is repeated multiple times , resulting in a multilevel scheme that samples whole sections of the paths in a single step .",
    "the acceptance ratio at each level of this multilevel markov process is set so that the combined process of permutation and configuration moves may lead to the probability density function @xmath74 of eq .",

    "for the simulation of a he system , @xmath88 turns out to be a good choice for the permutation moves .",

    ", the h@xmath18 molecule is a boson , but bulk superfluidity is preempted by the occurrence of the triple point at @xmath262  k. however , finite - size and reduced dimensionality systems are offer ways of bypassing this solidification of hydrogen by allowing lower densities and thereby moderating the effects of strong interactions .",
    "path integral calculations have already been used in several instances in the search for a superfluid state of molecular hydrogen .",
