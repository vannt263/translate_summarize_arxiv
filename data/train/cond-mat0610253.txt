    "numerical simulations play a major role among studies of the glass transition since , in contrast to experiments , the individual motion of a large number of particles can be followed at all times  @xcite . with present day computers ,",
    "it is possible to follow the dynamics of a simple glass - forming liquid over more than 8 decades of time , and over a temperature window in which average relaxation timescales increase by more than 5 decades .",
    "however , at the lowest temperatures studied , relaxation is still orders of magnitude faster than in experiments performed close to the glass transition temperature .",
    "nevertheless , it is now possible to numerically access temperatures which are low enough that many features associated to the glass transition physics can be observed : strong decoupling phenomena  @xcite , clear deviations from fits to the mode - coupling theory  @xcite ( which are experimentally known to hold only at high temperatures ) , and crossovers towards activated dynamics  @xcite .",
    "computer simulations usually study newtonian dynamics ( nd ) by solving a discretized version of newton s equations for a given pair interaction between particles  @xcite . here , we study a glass - forming model in which a binary mixture of small and large particles interact via a lennard - jones pair potential , a model introduced by kob and andersen ( ka )  @xcite . it can be interesting to study also different types of microscopic dynamics for the same pair potential .",
    "if dynamics satisfies detailed balance with respect to the boltzmann distribution , all structural quantities remain unchanged , although the dynamics might be very different . in colloidal glasses , for instance , the particles undergo brownian motion arising from collisions with the molecules of the solvent , and a stochastic dynamics is more appropriate .",
    "theoretical considerations also suggest the study of different dynamics .",
    "gleim et al .",
    "studied a stochastic dynamics ( sd ) to investigate whether the relaxation of the ka binary mixture depend on its microscopic dynamics , their answer being `` no ''  @xcite . in sd",
    ", a friction term and a random noise are added to newton s equations , the amplitude of both terms being related by a fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "szamel and flenner recently used brownian dynamics ( bd ) to study the same ka mixture  @xcite . in this description",
    "there are no momenta , and positions evolve with a langevin dynamics .",
    "they again find that relaxation using bd is very similar to the one resulting from nd .",
    "they emphasize that even the deviations from mode - coupling fitting are similar in bd and nd and conclude that momenta play no role in avoiding the mode - coupling singularity , contrary to previous claims  @xcite , but in agreement with more recent ones  @xcite .",
    "recently , it was also discovered that dynamic heterogeneity , that is , spatio - temporal fluctuations around the average dynamical behaviour , sensitively depends upon the microscopic dynamics  @xcite .",
    "in particular , a major role is played by conservation laws for energy and density . in the case of energy",
    "the mechanism can be physically understood as follows . for a rearrangement to take place in the liquid",
    ", the system has to locally cross an energy barrier .",
    "if the dynamics conserves the energy , particles involved in the rearrangment must borrow energy to the neighboring particles .",
    "this ` cooperativity ' might be unnecessary if energy can be locally supplied to the particles by an external heat bath .",
    "conservation laws , therefore , might introduce dynamic correlations between particles and dynamic fluctuations can be different when changing from newtonian energy conserving dynamics to a stochastic thermostatted dynamics .",
    "this predicted influence of the microscopic dynamics on dynamic fluctuations  @xcite was in fact our principal motivation for the present study .    in this article , we propose a third type of stochastic dynamics for the ka mixture and study in detail the dynamics of the system subjected to a standard monte - carlo ( mc ) dynamics .",
    "we find that mc is particularly efficient at relaxing the system since it is about 10 times faster than bd and 30 times faster than sd , while the average dynamics is still in quantitative agreement with nd .",
    "we are therefore in position to study both the very low temperature average dynamics of the model and its dynamic fluctuations in detail , shedding new light on both aspects .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ mc ]",
    "we give details about the simulation technique and compare its efficiency to previously studied dynamics .",
    "in section [ results ] we present our numerical results .",
    "section [ conclusion ] concludes the paper .",
    "we study a binary lennard - jones mixture made of @xmath0 and @xmath1 particles of types @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "particles interact with the following lennard - jones pair potential @xmath4 ,   \\label{pp}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 $ ] and @xmath6 is the distance between the interacting pair of particles .",
    "interaction parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 are chosen to prevent crystallization and can be found in ref .",
    "the length and energy are given in the standard lennard - jones units @xmath9 ( particle diameter ) , and @xmath10 ( interaction energy ) , where the subscript @xmath2 refers to the majority species .",
    "the potential is truncated and shifted at a distance @xmath11 .",
    "previous work  @xcite has shown that the dynamics becomes slow below @xmath12 , while the fitted mode - coupling temperature for this system is @xmath13 , although deviations from mode - coupling behaviour become noticable already below @xmath14 .",
    "we have implemented a standard monte - carlo dynamics  @xcite for the pair potential in eq .",
    "( [ pp ] ) .",
    "an elementary move can be described as follows . a particle , @xmath15 , located at the position @xmath16 is chosen at random . the energy cost , @xmath17 , to move particle @xmath15 from position @xmath16 to a new position @xmath18 is evaluated , @xmath19 being a random vector comprised in a cube of linear length @xmath20 centered around the origin .",
    "the metropolis acceptance rate , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the inverse temperature , is then used to decide whether the move is accepted . in the following",
    ", one monte - carlo timestep represents @xmath23 attempts to make such an elementary move , and timescales are reported in this unit .",
    "the one degree of freedom that remains to be fixed is @xmath20 which determines the average lengthscale of elementary moves .",
    "if chosen too small , energy costs are very small and most of the moves are accepted , but the dynamics is very slow because it takes a long time for particles to explore their cage . on the other hand too large displacements will on average be very costly in energy and acceptance rates can become prohibitively small .",
    "we seek a compromise between these two extremes by monitoring the dynamics at a moderately low temperature , @xmath24 , for several values of @xmath20 . as the most sensitive indicator of the relaxational behaviour we measure the contribution from the majority specie @xmath2 to the self - intermediate scattering function , @xmath25 } \\right\\rangle .",
    "\\label{self}\\ ] ] we spherically average over wavectors of comparable magnitude , and present results for @xmath26 , which corresponds to the first diffraction peak in the static structure factor of the liquid . in fig .",
    "[ delta ] we present our results for @xmath20 values between 0.05 and 0.4 .",
    "as expected we find that relaxation is slow both at small and large values of @xmath20 , and most efficient for intermediate values .",
    "interestingly we also note that the overall shape of the self - intermediate scattering function does not sensitively depend on @xmath27 .",
    "we define a typical relaxation time as @xmath28 and show its @xmath20 dependence in the inset of fig",
    ".  [ delta ] . a clear minimum is observed at the optimal value of @xmath29 . in the rest of the paper",
    "we only present data obtained for this value .",
    "as compared to previously studied dynamics , we find that , when expressed in numbers of integration timesteps , structural relaxation in monte - carlo simulations is marginally faster than in newtonian dynamics , but 30 times faster than in stochastic dynamics  @xcite , and 10 times faster than in brownian dynamics  @xcite .",
    "we conclude therefore that mc is by far the most efficient way to perform stochastic molecular simulations of the present glass - forming material .",
    "the relative inefficiency of both bd and sd is due to the stochastic nature of their microscopic equations of motion .",
    "it is well - known that small integration timesteps are required for accurate integration of stochastic equations of motion , in particular to maintain the delicate balance between friction and noise required for the system to converge towards the correct equilibrium distribution  @xcite .",
    "no such constraint exists for mc dynamics , where elementary moves can be made arbitrarily large .",
    "equilibrium only requires detailed balance to be fulfilled , and this is always the case with the metropolis algorithm described above . with larger elementary moves",
    ", particles can efficiently explore their cage and relaxation is much faster .",
    "this physical interpretation is also supported by the optimal value @xmath30 that we report , which corresponds to a mean - square displacement of 0.225 , very close to the plateau observed in the mean - square displacement shown in fig .",
    "[ fs ] ( see below ) , which can be taken as a rough estimate of the cage size .",
    "monte - carlo simulations can of course be made even more efficient by implementing for instance swaps between particles , or using parallel tempering .",
    "the dynamical behaviour , however , is then strongly affected by such non - physical moves and only equilibrium thermodynamics can be studied .",
    "since we want to conserve a physically realistic dynamics , we can not use such improved schemes .",
    "we have performed simulations at temperatures between @xmath31 and @xmath32 , the latter being smaller than the fitted mode - coupling temperature .",
    "for each temperature we have simulated 10 independent samples to improve the statistics .",
    "initial configurations were taken as the final configurations obtained from previous work performed with nd  @xcite , so that production runs could be started immediately . for each sample ,",
    "production runs lasted at least @xmath33 ( at @xmath32 ) , much longer for higher temperatures .",
    "the self - intermediate scattering function , eq .",
    "( [ self ] ) , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fs ] for temperatures decreasing from @xmath31 down to @xmath32 .",
    "these curves present well - known features .",
    "dynamics at high temperature is fast and has an exponential nature .",
    "when temperature is decreased below @xmath12 , a two - step decay , the slower being strongly non - exponential , becomes apparent . upon decreasing the temperature further",
    ", the slow process dramatically slows down by about 5 decades , while clearly conserving an almost temperature - independent non - exponential shape , as already reported for nd  @xcite .    finally , as reported for sd  @xcite , we find that also the first process , the decay towards a plateau , slows down considerably when decreasing temperature .",
    "this process , called ` critical decay ' in the language of mode - coupling theory  @xcite , is not observed when using nd , because it is obscured by the thermal vibrations occuring at high frequencies .",
    "although the plateau seen in @xmath34 is commonly interpreted as ` vibrations of a particle within a cage ' , the data in fig .",
    "[ fs ] discard this view . from direct visualisation of the particles individual dynamics it is obvious that vibrations take place in just a few mc timesteps , while the decay towards the plateau can be as long as @xmath35 time units at the lowest temperatures studied here .",
    "this decay is therefore necessarily more complex , most probably cooperative in nature .",
    "this interpretation is supported by recent theoretical studies where a plateau is observed in two - time correlators of lattice models where local vibrations are indeed completely absent  @xcite .",
    "a detailed atomistic description of this process has not yet been reported , but would indeed be very interesting .",
    "next , we study the mean - squared displacement for the majority specie . it is defined as @xmath36 and we present its temperature evolution in fig .",
    "[ fs ] , which mirrors the evolution of the self - intermediate scattering function in the same figure .",
    "since we are studying a stochastic dynamics , displacements are diffusive at both short and long timescales .",
    "the plateau observed in @xmath34 now translates into a sub - diffusive regime in the mean - squared displacements separating the two diffusive regimes . at the lowest temperature",
    "studied , when @xmath37 changes by three decades from @xmath38 to @xmath39 , the mean - squared displacement changes by a mere factor 2.2 from 0.02 to 0.044 .",
    "particles are therefore nearly arrested for several decades of times , before eventually entering the diffusing regime which allows for the relaxation of the structure of the liquid .",
    "the previous subsection has shown that the monte - carlo dynamics of the ka mixture is qualitatively similar to the one reported for nd , apart at relatively short times where the effect of thermal vibrations is efficiently suppressed .",
    "we now compare our results more quantitatively with the dynamical behaviour observed using nd .    in fig .",
    "[ comp ] we compare the time dependence of the self - intermediate scattering function for three types of dynamics : the present monte - carlo data , the newtonian dynamics data taken from ref .",
    "@xcite , and the stochastic dynamics results from ref .",
    "@xcite , all obtained for the same parameters @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "we have rescaled the time to obtain maximum overlap in the long - time relaxation of the three curves .",
    "quite strikingly , sd and mc data perfectly overlap over the complete time - range ( 8 decades of time ) of the simulation . indeed",
    "the sd dotted line is barely visible below the full line of the mc data in fig .",
    "this confirms our claim that mc defines a physically relevant microscopic dynamics , since it is completely equivalent to sd with the major advantage that it is 30 times faster , at least for the ka mixture .    in fig .",
    "[ comp ] , we also confirm that the approach to the plateau is different in mc / sd and nd . in the latter , phonon - like vibrations affect the initial decay of @xmath34 .",
    "for instance , a shallow dip , generally attributed to the ` boson peak ' , is observed at low temperature in nd , see the dashed line in fig .  [ comp ] .",
    "the long - time decay of the self - intermediate scattering function , however , is in full quantitative agreement for the three dynamics .",
    "this agreement was the main claim of ref .",
    "@xcite , extended to bd in ref .",
    "@xcite and for mc in the present work .",
    "since all dynamics display similar long - time relaxation , it is sensible to also quantitatively compare the temperature evolution of the relaxation times , @xmath42 , already defined above .",
    "this is done in fig .",
    "[ comp ] , where we use a standard representation where an arrhenius slowing down over a constant energy barrier , @xmath43 , would appear as a straight line .",
    "the data clearly show some upwards bending in fig .  [ comp ] , which places the ka mixture in the family of fragile ( though very weakly ) glass - formers .",
    "we find that the temperature evolution of the alpha - relaxation time measured in mc simulations is in complete quantitative agreement with the one obtained from nd , over the complete temperature range @xmath44 .",
    "in particular the quality of a power - law fit of the slowing down , @xmath45 , as suggested by mode - coupling theory , is similar for both dynamics  @xcite .",
    "we have shown such a fit through our data , using the value @xmath46 determined in ref .",
    "the fit describes the data over about 2.5 decades .",
    "deviations from the mode - coupling fit appear below @xmath14 , and become obvious when @xmath47 is approached further .    in fig .",
    "[ comp ] we also show the temperature evolution of the self - diffusion constant , defined from the long - time limit of the mean - square displacement as @xmath48 the behaviour of the diffusion constant is qualitatively very close to the one of the alpha - relaxation time , and all the above remarks apply . the well - known difference between the two quantities is a slightly stronger temperature evolution of @xmath49 , implying a well - studied decoupling between translational diffusion and structural relaxation in this system  @xcite , which is therefore very similar for different types of dynamics .",
    "theoretically , an identical relaxation within mc / sd / bd / nd is an important prediction of mode - coupling theory  @xcite because the theory uniquely predicts the dynamical behaviour from static density fluctuations .",
    "gleim et al .",
    "argue that their finding of a quantitative agreement between sd and nd is a nice confirmation of this non - trivial mode - coupling prediction  @xcite .",
    "szamel and flenner  @xcite confirmed this claim using bd , and argued further that even deviations from mode - coupling predictions are identical .",
    "we confirm the validity of this statement even below @xmath47 , showing that the agreement between different dynamics , although indeed predicted by mode - coupling theory , is certainly valid at a much more general level .",
    "similarly to szamel and flenner , we note that deviations from a power law divergence can not be attributed to coupling to currents which are expressed in terms of particle velocities . in our mc simulations",
    "we have no velocities , so that avoiding the mode - coupling singularity is not due to the hydrodynamic effects pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for more recent theoretical viewpoints ) .",
    "having established the ability of mc simulations to efficiently reproduce the average slow dynamics obtained from nd simulations we now turn to the study of the dynamic fluctuations around the average dynamical behaviour , i.e. to dynamic heterogeneity .",
    "dynamic fluctuations can be studied through the four - point susceptibility , @xmath50 , which quantifies the strength of the spontaneous fluctuations around the average dynamics by their variance , @xmath51 ,   \\label{chi4lj}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 ) $ ] represents the real part of the instantaneous value of the self - intermediate scattering function , so that @xmath53 . as shown by eq .",
    "( [ chi4lj ] ) , it is clear that @xmath50 will be large if run - to - run fluctuations of the self - intermediate scattering functions are large .",
    "this is the case when the local dynamics becomes spatially correlated , as already discussed in several papers  @xcite .",
    "we show the time dependence of the dynamic susceptibility @xmath50 obtained from our mc simulations for various temperatures in fig .",
    "[ chi4 ] . as predicted theoretically in ref .",
    "@xcite we find that @xmath50 presents a complex time evolution , closely related to the time evolution of the self - intermediate scattering function .",
    "overall , @xmath50 is small at both small and large times when dynamic fluctuations are small .",
    "there is therefore a clear maximum observed for times comparable to @xmath49 , where fluctuations are most prominent .",
    "the position of the maximum then shifts to larger times when temperature is decreased , tracking the alpha - relaxation .",
    "the most important physical information revealed by these curves is the fact that the amplitude of the peak grows when the temperature decreases .",
    "this is direct evidence that spatial correlations grow when the glass transition is approached .",
    "the two - step decay of the self - intermediate scattering function translates into a two - power law regime for @xmath50 approaching its maximum .",
    "we have fitted these power laws , @xmath54 , followed by @xmath55 with the exponents @xmath56 and @xmath57 in fig .",
    "we have intentionally used the notation @xmath58 and @xmath59 for these exponents which are predicted , within mode - coupling theory , to be equal to the standard exponents also describing the time dependence of intermediate scattering functions  @xcite .",
    "our findings are in good agreement with previously reported values for @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "see refs .",
    "@xcite for a more extensive discussion and comparison to other theoretical predictions .",
    "we finally compare the dynamic susceptibility for various dynamics . in fig .",
    "[ chi42 ] , we present the time evolution of @xmath50 for a given temperature , @xmath41 and four different dynamics : the present mc data , data from sd obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , data for nd in the microcanonical ( @xmath60 ) ensemble from ref .",
    "@xcite , and data for nd in the canonical ( @xmath61 ) ensemble from ref .",
    "@xcite . to perform this comparison",
    ", we have again rescaled times to obtain the maximum overlap in the long - time region . in fig .",
    "[ chi42 ] it is obvious that three curves are identical : nd-@xmath60 , mc and sd data perfectly overlap near the maximum of @xmath50 and have similar time dependences , apart at very short - times . on the other hand , nd-@xmath61 data display a different time dependence and reveal considerably larger dynamic fluctuations in the long - time regime .",
    "we conclude therefore that , contrary to the average dynamics , the dynamic fluctuations quantified through the four - point susceptibility do retain a dependence upon the microscopic dynamics since canonical estimates of @xmath50 are different for nd and for mc / sd / bd .",
    "although perhaps counter - intuitive at first sight we find that dynamics with a stochastic heat - bath display dynamic fluctuations similar to the ones measured using microcanonical nd , while fluctuations are much larger in canonical nd simulations .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , this confirms the idea that the energy conservation ( implied by newton s equations of motion ) might lead to an amplification of dynamic fluctuations .",
    "with hindsight , this is not such a surprising result : the specific heat , after all , also behaves differently in different statistical ensembles .",
    "the ensemble dependence and dependence upon the microscopic dynamics are the main subjects of two recent papers  @xcite .",
    "there is an experimentally relevant consequence of these findings .",
    "the difference between the microcanonical and canonical values of the dynamic fluctuations in nd can be shown to be equal to  @xcite @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the constant volume specific heat expressed in @xmath64 units .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ chi42 ] the temperature derivative in eq .",
    "( [ chit ] ) represents in fact the major contribution to @xmath65 , meaning that the term @xmath66 can be neglected in eq .",
    "( [ chit ] ) . since",
    "the right hand side of ( [ chit ] ) is more easily accessible in an experiment than @xmath67 itself , eq .",
    "( [ chit ] ) opens the possibility of an experimental estimate of the four - point susceptibility .",
    "this finding , and its experimental application to supercooled glycerol and hard sphere colloids , constitute the central results of ref .  @xcite .",
    "we have implemented a standard monte - carlo dynamics on the well - known binary lennard - jones mixture introduced by ka .",
    "we have shown that the resulting average dynamics is in full quantitative agreement with results from newtonian dynamics , while being considerably faster than previously studied stochastic dynamics , namely brownian and stochastic dynamics .",
    "we have therefore at our disposal an efficient numerical technique to simulate the stochastic dynamics of the ka mixture at low temperature .",
    "this allowed us to show , in particular , that dynamic fluctuations retain a dependence upon the microscopic dynamics since four - point dynamical susceptibilities evaluated in the canonical ensemble for nd and mc quantitatively differ , because the energy conservation of newton s equations amplify dynamic fluctuations .",
