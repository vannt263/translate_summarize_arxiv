    "supersymmetry ( susy ) is one of the most well - motivated and well - studied extensions to the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "if susy is broken at about the tev scale , it solves the gauge hierarchy problem of the sm and also explains the existence of dark matter . one major problem with such models is the presence of flavor changing neutral currents ( fcncs ) ; this has motivated the study of gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking ( gmsb ) where susy breaking is communicated to the observable sector through the standard model interactions @xcite .",
    "flavor violating dynamics are then available only through yukawa interactions ; any new fcncs are aligned with the sm and are therefore small .    from the phenomenological perspective",
    ", gmsb is usually described through the introduction of heavy messenger fields .",
    "these models are characterized by two parameters : the messenger scale @xmath0 , where the soft parameters are generated , and @xmath1 the effective scale of susy breaking in the visible sector . up to renormalization effects ,",
    "the superpartner masses are then completely determined and @xmath2 parameters in our analysis .",
    "] by their standard model quantum numbers and @xmath1 .",
    "typical weakly coupled gmsb models are quite complicated , however , and require a relatively high susy breaking scale",
    ". it would be exciting if susy were broken at low energies so that messenger fields or even the hidden susy breaking sector would be directly observable in experiment .    for this reason , significant effort has been devoted over the years to the search for models of low energy direct gauge mediation ( see for example @xcite ) or even single sector susy breaking @xcite .",
    "it is unfortunately quite non - trivial to calculate the superpartner spectrum in the strongly interacting theories needed for implementation of direct and/or low energy gauge mediation .",
    "indeed , it was shown in @xcite that usually neglected renormalization effects from a strongly interacting hidden sector may radically modify standard gmsb predictions .",
    "recently , meade , seiberg , and shih @xcite have succeeded in giving a general characterization of spectra in gauge mediated models , including strongly interacting ones .",
    "while certain gmsb features such as gravitino lsp , smallness of @xmath3-terms and certain sum rules remain unchanged , their results imply that spectra which are quite different from those of traditional gmsb can be obtained .",
    "examples of weakly interacting models of this type were presented in @xcite and further generalized in @xcite .",
    "our goal in this paper is to begin the study of the phenomenology of the ggm scenario .",
    "these studies are likely to constrain the allowed ggm parameter space and also suggest new experimental signatures which do not arise in minimal gmsb models . in particular , we shall attempt to construct viable models with low messenger scales , which may allow us to probe the hidden sector directly",
    ".    we will begin by reviewing the general gauge mediation framework in section [ sec : ggm ] . in section [ sec : mggmfmwk ] , we begin the study of the phenomenology of ggm by considering models where sfermion and gaugino masses are controlled by two independent parameters , and the overall scale of the theory is the third parameter ( a different slice of ggm parameter space was recently studied in @xcite ) .",
    "we then demonstrate that even our simplified subset of ggm parameters can be used to create models with new and possibly interesting phenomenology , and we qualitatively detail how these new mass hierarchies differ from previously considered models of gmsb and gaugino mediation models .",
    "we conclude by calculating the mass spectrum at certain benchmark points and showing their qualitative phenomenological differences from previously considered gauge mediated models .",
    "to describe strongly interacting models of gmsb , a model independent formulation of gauge mediation is necessary .",
    "such a formulation was proposed in @xcite : the theory decouples into the mssm and a separate susy breaking sector in the limit where mssm gauge couplings tend to zero ( and @xmath4 to infinity ) . with these assumptions",
    ", one may relate the superpartner spectrum to one- and two - point correlation functions of the supercurrent @xmath5 .",
    "current conservation @xmath6 leads to the following expressions for one- and two - point correlation functions : @xmath7 where @xmath0 is a characteristic scale of the theory , @xmath8 is a uv cutoff and a common factor of @xmath9 is understood .",
    "the four functions @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 serve to characterize the hidden sector contribution to the current - current correlators .    when these currents carry mssm quantum numbers , each @xmath14 and @xmath15 gains a new index @xmath16 which labels the su(3 ) @xmath17 su(2 ) @xmath17 u(1 ) gauge groups .",
    "after considering the effective action from this coupling of hidden sector correlators with the gauge supermultiplets , the gaugino and sfermion masses are given in the effective theory at scale @xmath0 by @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 is the quadratic casimir invariant of gauge group @xmath21 of fermion @xmath22 .",
    "since superpartner masses in ( [ eqn : masses ] ) are generated at the messenger scale , it is convenient to identify the scale @xmath0 with the scale of messenger masses .",
    "we also note that in addition to its dependence on @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , the superpartner spectrum at the electroweak symmetry breaking scale is modified due to renormalization group ( rg ) evolution between the messenger scale @xmath0 and the electroweak scale .",
    "we would now like to identify benchmark points in the parameter space of ggm .",
    "to this end we will consider gmsb models with @xmath26 messengers in the @xmath27 and @xmath28 representations of @xmath29 .",
    "as usual , fermionic components of messenger supermultiplets are characterized by mass @xmath0 while scalar components have mass squared @xmath30 . in regular gmsb models",
    "@xcite , @xmath31 where @xmath32   \\\\ f(x ) = \\left . \\frac{1+x}{x^2 } \\right . \\left [ \\log ( 1+x ) - 2 \\text{li}_2 ( x/[1+x ] ) + \\frac{1}{2 } \\text{li}_2 ( 2x / [ 1+x ] ) \\right ] + ( x \\rightarrow -x ) , \\\\ \\label{eqn : gmsbgenmassesfg } \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 .     and @xmath34 parameterizing gaugino and sfermion masses , respectively . figure taken from @xcite . ]    for small @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 both approach 1 , and we can specify points in the ggm parameter space corresponding to models of minimal gmsb : @xmath38    since soft masses are generated at one loop , it is often convenient to discuss the low energy spectrum in terms of the effective susy breaking scale in the visible sector , @xmath39 tev . in ggm ,",
    "on the other hand , the effective scale of susy breaking could be smaller than @xmath40 gev since gauginos formally arise at tree level and sfermion mass squareds arise at one loop .",
    "in this paper we will study a three parameter subspace of ggm models .",
    "we will assume that @xmath41 and that values of @xmath23 and @xmath24 are independent of the gauge group .",
    "these models are described by a characteristic messenger scale @xmath0 , an overall suppression of gaugino and sfermion masses relative to @xmath0 , and the ratio between these masses .",
    "note that in minimal gmsb models , gaugino masses arise at 1-loop and sfermion mass squareds arise at 2-loops in the effective theory : hence , gaugino and sfermion masses naturally both have a 1-loop suppression factor and are approximately equal at the messenger scale .",
    "one can see from ( [ eqn : gmsbgenmasses ] ) and ( [ eqn : gmsbgenmassesfg ] ) that the ratio of gaugino and sfermion soft masses can be modified in models with @xmath42 ; however , this typically happens in models with a strongly interacting dynamical susy breaking sector and a messenger scale close to 100 tev . while calculable examples exist in the literature @xcite , they typically allow only @xmath43 changes in sfermion to gaugino mass ratios . in effect , there is very little freedom in gmsb models to change the ratio of sfermion mass to gaugino mass by more than an @xmath43 factor .",
    "our three parameters allow us to explore the consequences of tuning the sfermion to gaugino mass ratio by a large factor .",
    "an alternative approach to modifying superpartner mass ratios would involve allowing the number of messengers , @xmath26 , to take arbitrary values .",
    "this approach was considered in ref .",
    "@xcite by adopting messengers to be in extended gauge messenger multiplets .",
    "clearly , since gaugino and sfermion masses scale as @xmath26 and @xmath44 , respectively , an arbitrary mass ratio can be obtained if @xmath26 were allowed to be arbitrarily large .",
    "indeed , gmsb models with extremely large values of @xmath26 are interesting since the superpartner spectrum in this limit is the spectrum of gaugino mediation ( @xmath45msb ) @xcite .",
    "typically , only small values of @xmath46 to @xmath47 ( depending on the messenger scale ) are considered in the literature in order to maintain perturbativity .",
    "our parametrization allows the interpolation between spectra of minimal gmsb and those of @xmath45msb .",
    "in fact , it is more general than either of these two scenarios .",
    "this is due to the fact that in @xmath45msb models considered so far , the compactification ( messenger ) scale was large ; hence , as a consequence of rg evolution , at the electroweak scale sfermion masses become comparable to gaugino masses .",
    "in contrast , ggm allows the messenger scale to be as low as 10 tev which results in a `` pure '' @xmath45msb spectrum with sfermions significantly lighter than gauginos .    in our calculation",
    ", we will assume that the mass couplings @xmath48 and @xmath49 for both higgs doublets are equal to the left - handed slepton soft mass squared term @xmath50 at the scale @xmath0 .",
    "we set @xmath51 and we set the gravitino mass to be @xmath52 , where @xmath53 gev and @xmath54 gev is the reduced planck scale from 3 to 50 and observed qualitatively similar results . ] .",
    "we then use softsusy 2.0.17 @xcite to determine the superpartner spectra .",
    "parameter regions ( which we require to have a ground state with broken electroweak symmetry ) and the corresponding nlsp species are shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig : m5species ] ) and fig .",
    "( [ fig : m7species ] ) for different choices of the messenger scale .",
    "we also impose the current experimental lower mass bounds on nlsps in gmsb scenarios : neutralinos at 114.0 gev , squarks at 250.0 gev , sleptons at 87.4 gev , charginos at 101.0 gev , sneutrinos at 43.7 gev @xcite , and gluinos 240.0 gev @xcite .",
    "these bounds remove the gluinos and sneutrinos , but leave some of the chargino region intact , as evident by the delineated regions in fig .",
    "( [ fig : m5species ] ) and fig .",
    "( [ fig : m7species ] ) .",
    "in addition , the points toward the right , where @xmath55 , are disfavored from a theoretical perspective , since the nlsp masses at @xmath56 in this limit are @xmath57(10 tev ) and lead to a `` little hierarchy '' problem .",

    "( [ fig : m7species ] ) depicts models with gmsb - like parameters of @xmath62 gev , @xmath63 gev , @xmath26 from 1 to 30 , and with @xmath69 , since @xmath70 is small and @xmath71 . for models that preserve gauge coupling perturbativity up to the gut scale",
    ", @xmath26 is necessarily smaller . in the case of low energy susy breaking with @xmath72 the ratio of corresponding ggm parameters @xmath3 and",
    "@xmath2 is very sensitive to the value of @xmath73 and can vary by a factor of 2 .",
    "this is taken into account in fig .",
    "( [ fig : m5species ] ) .",
    "there are also regions where ggm parameters lead to spectra that are markedly different than those of traditional gmsb models ( table 1 ) . in this table",
    "we show the spectra of three ggm models ( which we will refer to as ggm1 , ggm2 , and ggm3 respectively ) and also two models of traditional gauge mediation ( which we will refer to as gmsb1 , gmsb2 respectively ) .",
    "in particular , we find that gauge mediation models do not have to obey the typical low - energy hierarchy of @xmath74 for the case of a stau nlsp ( cf .",
    "gmsb 1 ) , or @xmath75 in the case of a bino nlsp ( cf .",
    "for example , the model ggm1 has both gaugino masses and sfermion mass squareds as approximately 1-loop suppressed relative to the messenger scale @xmath76 gev , and leads to a susy spectrum with all gauginos lighter than all scalars .",
    "model ggm2 , on the other hand , has gaugino masses approximately @xmath77 suppressed , while the sfermions start nearly massless , and all sleptons stay lighter than all gauginos after rg evolution .",
    "clearly , the phenomenology of such situations would be radically different from traditional gmsb scenarios . in the case of ggm1 ,",
    "squark production is heavily suppressed at the lhc from kinematics and the parton momenta fraction , and hence susy production is dominated by gluino pair production .",
    "the allowed modes for gluino decay are then a three - body final state of @xmath78 with 2 hard jets and missing energy ( and a likely @xmath79 from @xmath80 decay ) or a two - body decay of @xmath81 . on the other hand , for ggm2 , long cascade decay chains with lots of leptons are possible .",
    "these simple examples demonstrate two notably distinct sets of signals , both originating from the general gauge mediation framework .",
    "we also present model ggm3 , which sets both gaugino and sfermion masses to be nearly tree - level in the theory , and because of a large cancelation in the diagonalization of the gaugino mixing matrices , the nlsp is a chargino .",
    ".comparison of minimal general gauge mediation and minimal gmsb [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      gev , @xmath51 , in general gauge mediation . here , we set @xmath82 , and similarly for @xmath2 , to use in ( [ eqn : masses]).,width=453 ]    a notable feature evident in our ggm parameter plots is the intersection of three discrete nlsp regions : neutralino ( bino ) , chargino ( wino ) , and slepton ( stau ) nlsps",
    ". this triple point region likely leads to very interesting phenomenology and new collider signals , since all three particles are highly degenerate in this parameter space . in principle",
    ", there could also be other combinations of nlsps that give triple point phenomenology .",
    "( for example , there is a triple point of sneutrinos , neutralinos , and charginos in the rightmost plot of fig .",
    "( [ fig : hypermulti ] ) . ) one immediate consequence of highly degenerate nlsps , however , is that the typical dark matter relic density calculation must now include coannihilations , and so a full analysis of triple point phenomenology must first determine what the favored degenerate mass range is in order to give an appropriate dark matter relic density .",
    "we leave a full analysis of triple point phenomenology for future work .",
    "we now study how simple extensions of minimal set of parameters considered so far affect our results by allowing the variation of @xmath83 and @xmath84 relative to the other @xmath3 and @xmath2 parameters .",
    "specifically , we set @xmath85 and @xmath86 , where @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath27 .    as can be seen in fig .",
    "( [ fig : hypermulti ] ) , this leads to interesting phenomenological consequences .",
    "in particular , note that for @xmath90 the charged slepton nlsp is not a generic prediction of gauge mediation .",
    "instead , for a large set of parameters , sneutrinos and charginos become the nlsp .",
    "this is especially interesting in view of the fact that the @xmath91 region of ggm parameter space squeezes the superpartner spectrum and thus alleviates the little hierarchy problem .    on a separate note , in fig .",
    "( [ fig : m5species ] ) and fig .",
    "( [ fig : m7species ] ) , there are new regions where gluino nlsps are present .",
    "( in fig .",

    "( [ fig : m7species ] ) . )",
    "the entire gluino region has masses calculated at best to be @xmath57 ( 0.1 gev ) , and therefore ruled out ; yet it should be possible to construct ggm models with viable gluino nlsps by adjusting the parameters @xmath23 , @xmath15 appropriately .",
