    "for many decades the spectroscopic properties of laser - driven atoms have been successfully modeled by a born - markov master equation for the electronic degrees of freedom , where spontaneous decay is described by a liouvillian term and the frequency shifts induced by the coupling with the field are included as corrections to the hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "the resulting optical bloch equations ( obe ) , namely , the equations of motion for the density - matrix elements , are by now a tool which is routinely employed to interpret the experimental curves @xcite .    recent spectroscopic measurements , pushing the precision to the limits , reported discrepancies with the predictions of the obe , which , if verified , could have consequences on the validity of quantum electrodynamics @xcite .",
    "it has been conjectured that these discrepancies could emerge from contributions to the obe , which have been identified in the original derivations starting from a fully quantized description of the modes of the electromagnetic field @xcite but have been neglected so far @xcite .",
    "these terms describe interference between decay channels and are usually referred to as cross - damping terms @xcite .",
    "they are important in order to correctly reproduce radiation damping in a harmonic oscillator @xcite but are typically discarded in the obe used for atomic spectroscopy , since they were assumed to be negligible . for anharmonic spectra , moreover , their inclusion in the master equation used in atomic spectroscopy @xcite leads to a form which does not fulfil the requirements of the lindblad theorem @xcite , unless additional assumptions are made @xcite . for closed level structures",
    "it was argued that these terms could give rise to `` steady - state quantum beats '' @xcite and in general to interference effects in the radiative emission of parallel quantum dipoles @xcite .",
    "studies which analysed the effects of the cross - damping terms for spectroscopy used phenomenological models @xcite or derived scattering amplitudes @xcite , arguing that cross - damping could be responsible for systematic shifts of the order of khz in the spectroscopy of atomic hydrogen .",
    "this situation motivates a systematic theoretical derivation , which delivers a valid master equation and which can thus allow one to quantitatively predict whether and how such interference terms affect the spectroscopic measurements .    in this work",
    "we derive a master equation for the electronic bound states of an atom coupled to the quantum electromagnetic field by applying the coarse - graining procedure developed in refs .",
    "@xcite , with some appropriate modifications .",
    "differing from previous treatments @xcite , the coarse - graining approach allows us to consistently include terms due to the interference in the radiative processes of atomic transitions : these terms preserve the lindblad form and their coefficients do not depend on the particular choice of the coarse - graining time step , provided this is chosen within the range of validity of the born - markov approximation .",

    "our equations further predict that dynamics due to cross interference could be better observed for atoms with no hyperfine structure and/or coupled to light in confined geometries @xcite . in this case also the dynamics due to cross - shifts could become visible .",
