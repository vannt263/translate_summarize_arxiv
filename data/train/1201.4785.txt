    "in noncommutative geometry , gauge theories are typically described in terms of connections on finite projective modules @xmath1 over the noncommutative algebra @xmath2 , see e.g.  landi s book @xcite for an introduction .",

    ", there are different choices for a calculus at hand , for example the twist deformed differential calculus @xcite in deformation quantization using drinfeld twists , the bicovariant differential calculus for quantum groups @xcite and the derivation - based differential calculus @xcite , being particularly useful for finite matrix algebras @xcite , such as the fuzzy sphere @xcite .",
    "connections on finite projective modules , and the noncommutative gauge theories they describe , have been part of many investigations in the past years , leading to interesting results , such as noncommutative instantons in deformation quantization @xcite and noncommutative monopoles on fuzzy spaces @xcite , just to name a few .",
    "these works aim at understanding topological invariants constructed from the curvature of the connection , but they do not attempt to construct complete sets of observables , i.e.  gauge invariant functions from the space of connections to the complex numbers , which are separating on the space of connections modulo gauge transformations .",

    "there are examples showing that there is also a gauge copy problem in noncommutative geometry , see e.g.  proposition [ propo : gaugecopyproblem ] in this paper , where we review some results of @xcite .",
    "this means that considering only observables which are constructed from the curvature , we can in general not extract the complete gauge invariant information of the connection .",

    ". in this case , there can be non - complete vector fields which do not give rise to global one - parameter groups of diffeomorphisms of @xmath144 . however , every compactly supported vector field is complete , and can be integrated to a global one - parameter group of diffeomorphisms , which gives rise to the pair of maps @xmath237 .",
    "thus , we can reconstruct the covariant derivative @xmath7 along every compactly supported vector field @xmath0 from module parallel transports , which is sufficient for uniquely specifying the connection .",
