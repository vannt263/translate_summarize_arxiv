    "the study of very young massive stars is of particular importance for star formation since it is not yet firmly established by what process , disk accretion or stellar merging , such stars form ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "previous authors have demonstrated that massive stars can be formed via accretion , leading to the formation of large ( @xmath3  au ) and massive ( @xmath4  m@xmath0 ) circumstellar disks . however , most of these stars are located more than 2  kpc away , which makes it challenging to confirm _ unambiguously _ the presence of accretion disks around single objects with radio interferometry due to the lack of spatial resolution .",
    "we focus on afgl 490  one of the best - studied young stars that are in a transition stage to herbig  be stars .",
    "this very young star is located nearby ( @xmath5  kpc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , has a mass of 810  m@xmath0 , a bolometric luminosity of @xmath6  l@xmath0   ( b23 star , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , is still embedded in its parent molecular cloud ( a@xmath7  mag , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and drives a high - velocity outflow @xcite .",
    "interferometric measurements by e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper  i ) as well as ir observations of @xcite and @xcite have revealed that the star is located inside an ionized @xmath8  au cavity cleared up by a fast stellar wind and surrounded by a @xmath9  au disk - like structure , which is enshrouded in a 22000  au @xmath10 6000  au envelope .",
    "all these structures are further embedded in an even more extended envelope .    in this letter , we present subarcsecond - resolution pdbi observations of afgl  490 that prove the existence of a rotating disk around afgl  490 and determine its orientation , size , and mass by using comprehensive physical , chemical , and line radiative transfer modeling .",
    "we observed afgl  490 in c@xmath1o  ( 21 ) at 224.714389  ghz using the pdbi in its b configuration in december 2003 ( baselines 61.5m330.5 m ) .",
    "the phase reference center of our measurements was @xmath11 = 03@xmath12 27@xmath13 38@xmath1455 , @xmath15 = @xmath16 46@xmath17 59@xmath188 , and the source velocity was set to @xmath19  kms@xmath20 .",
    "for the line measurements , we used one correlator unit with a total bandwidth of 20  mhz and 512 channels ( velocity resolution of 0.052 kms@xmath20 ) .",
    "two other correlator units with a bandwidth of 320  mhz each were utilized to measure the continuum .    the bandpass and phase calibration were performed on the objects 3c454.3 and 2145 + 067 .",
    "the additional calibrations of the phase and amplitude were obtained by observing the objects 0355 + 508 and 0224 + 671 every 20 minutes . for the final phase calibration and data reduction",
    "the grenoble software environment gildas was applied .",
    "the maps of @xmath21 square pixels with @xmath22 pixel size were produced by the fourier transform of the calibrated visibilities using natural weighting .",
    "the synthesized beam size is @xmath23 ( @xmath24  au at 1  kpc ) with a positional angle of 73@xmath25 . for reduction of the continuum",
    ", we excluded the line emission from the data . finally , the continuum was subtracted from the original data in the @xmath26-plane , as it was detected only at the source position .",
    "within the @xmath27 primary pdbi beam at 1.3 mm , afgl  490 was detected point source with a total flux of 1.41  jy ( peak value is 0.68  jybeam@xmath20 ) .",
    "the continuum is dominated by the thermal dust emission because at 1.3 mm the free - free radiation contributes less than 5% to the total flux ( @xmath28  mjy , see * ? ? ?",
    "the integrated c@xmath1o  ( 21 ) line intensity map overlaid with the 1.3 mm continuum is shown in fig .",
    "the continuum is barely resolved at the @xmath29 level within the @xmath30  au area around the star , and has a beam - like circular shape .",
    "in contrast , the line intensity map reveals a @xmath31  au arc of emission that is centered on the continuum peak and has a pa of @xmath2 @xmath32 .",
    "furthermore , the c@xmath1o  emission above the 50% intensity level appears as a @xmath33 700  au @xmath10 2000  au bar - like structure with the main axis shifted by 400  au to the northeast from the center .",
    "the red- and blue - shifted parts of the integrated c@xmath1o  ( 21 ) line intensity overlaid with an @xmath34-band speckle image @xcite and the 1.3 mm continuum is presented in fig .",
    "both lobes have their maximum 700  au away from the 1.3 mm continuum point source , and the line connecting them is shifted 260 au to the northeast ( pa of the axis perpendicular to the connecting line is @xmath35 ) . due to the simultaneous measurement of both line and continuum in the same bandpass ,",
    "the positional offset is certainly real .",
    "remarkably , the position of the red- and blue - shifted c@xmath1o  ( 21 ) peaks perfectly coincides with the position of the cs ( 21 ) peaks reported in paper  i. the pa of the c@xmath1o  emission is smaller than the @xmath36 positional angle of the @xmath37  au bar - like structure ( see paper  i ) , but the emission structure is orthogonal to the large - scale co outflow @xcite and coincides with the pa obtained from the infrared polarized map and the 2 cm radio emission @xcite .",
    "note that the c@xmath1o  emission pattern ( fig .",
    "[ co]b ) is characteristic of outflows or rotating disk - like configurations . to distinguish between these two possibilities , we analyze the corresponding position - velocity diagram below .",
    "we estimate the mass of the afgl  490 `` inner disk '' from the 1.3 mm continuum emission , using eq .  2 from @xcite .",
    "we assume the standard gas - to - dust mass ratio of 100 , a mean disk temperature of @xmath38  k , and a dust mass absorption coefficient @xmath39 at 1.3 mm between 1.99 and 5.86  @xmath40g@xmath20 ( grains without icy mantles , gas densities 10@xmath41 and 10@xmath42 @xmath43 , respectively , see * ? ? ?",
    "the resulting h@xmath44 gas mass is between 0.8 and 2.3  m@xmath0  and , thus , the source - averaged h@xmath44 column density is @xmath45  @xmath46 .",
    "the gas mass can be also derived from the c@xmath1o  data . due to missing flux of @xmath230% in the vicinity of afgl 490 , even in the reverse map side of the red- and the blue - shifted line emission , the total integrated flux value is smaller than the sum of individual contributions from the red- and blue - shifted emission .",
    "the sidelobes of the synthesized beam are not contributing to the low integrated fluxes due to their low intensities ( @xmath4720% ) .",
    "thus , we focus on the sum of the red- and the blue - shifted emission .    assuming optically thin c@xmath1o  line emission , the gas mass can be derived by @xmath48 & = & 1.58\\,10^{-10 } \\",

    "the masses of the red- and blue - shifted gas are 1.0 and 0.6  m@xmath0 , respectively , giving a total value of @xmath56  m@xmath0   which matches the estimate obtained above .      the gas velocity distribution across the red- and blue - shifted c@xmath1o  emission ( solid line in fig .  [ co]b )",
    "is presented in the position - velocity ( pv ) diagram in fig .",
    "the pv map shows a number of single gas clumps , indicating an inhomogeneous disk structure .",
    "this distribution is not caused by optical depth effects as demonstrated by radiative transfer calculations ( see sect .",
    "3.3 ) . to fit the pv diagram",
    ", we adopt a simple model of a keplerian disk with a mass that linearly increases with radius @xcite and a stellar mass of @xmath57  m@xmath0 .",
    "we assume a disk radius of 1600  au based on the spatial extent of the c@xmath1o  emission and a disk mass between 0.5 and 2  m@xmath0 . with this model , we fit the inner clumps ( @xmath58 ) of the the pv map and obtain the best - fit inclination angle of @xmath59 ( fig .",
    "[ vco ] , solid curve ) .",
    "the fit to the most intense clumps in the pv map at @xmath60 is not as good . it gives @xmath61 and super - keplerian gas velocities in the inner disk .",
    "in contrast to massive disks around active galactic nuclei that show a modified keplerian law with an exponent of @xmath2 @xmath62 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the corresponding curve for afgl 490 ( fig .  [ vco ] , dotted curve ) would only fit to the outer disk part .",
    "however , it does not fit the inner clumps .",
    "furthermore , the four most intense clumps in the pv map around @xmath63  kms@xmath20 can be best fitted by a rotating gas ring with a radius of 700  au and similar @xmath64 ( dashed line ) .",
    "such a small inclination angle is in contrast to the apparent c@xmath1o   morphology implying an inclination angle larger than 60@xmath25 for any circularly - symmetric configuration , e.g.  a disk ( see ellipse in fig .",
    "however rotation curves for any disk or ring model with larger inclination angles , @xmath65 , can only be well fitted assuming a low - mass central star , @xmath66 2 m@xmath0 which is definitely not the case for afgl  490 . thus , we propose that there is a massive , clumpy disk around afgl  490 with nearly face - on orientation ( @xmath67 ) and keplerian rotation .",
    "the pdbi c@xmath1o  ( 21 ) spectral map of the afgl  490 disk is presented in fig .",
    "[ c17o_fit ] .",
    "we fit these spectra using the `` step - by - step '' modeling approach ( * ? ? ?",
    "* for details see semenov et al .",
    "2006 , in preparation ) .",
    "briefly , we apply the 2d flared - disk model of @xcite to simulate the disk physical structure , a gas - grain chemical network to calculate time - dependent abundances , and a 2d line radiative transfer code of @xcite to synthesize the c@xmath1o  spectra .",
    "we assume that the disk has the power - law surface density @xmath68 and the velocity profile @xmath69 .",
    "the dust grains have mrn - like size distribution and the gas - to - dust mass ratio is 100 .",
    "moreover , we assume an age of @xmath20.1  myr due to the lack of reliable estimates . @xcite reported the dynamical outflow time of 1.8 10@xmath70 yr which is an lower limit ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the best fit to the observed c@xmath1o  ( 21 ) lines is obtained with the following disk parameters : ( 1 ) inclination and positional angles of @xmath71 , ( 2 ) inner and outer radii of @xmath72  au and @xmath73  au , respectively , ( 3 ) a surface density gradient @xmath74 , and ( 4 ) a keplerian - like velocity profile , @xmath75 .",
    "the best - fit disk mass ranges between @xmath76 and 1  m@xmath0 .",
    "note that the modeled line profiles are indeed optically thin , @xmath77 .",
    "all these values are in a good agreement with the observational results , and the values derived from the pv diagram .",
    "why do we see such a clumpy disk structure ?",
    "this object seems to be relatively young and could still be in a perturbed state that remains from an earlier , non - steady accretion phase .",
    "the viscous dissipation timescale for the afgl  490 disk is estimated to be @xmath2 1  myr @xcite , which far exceeds its age .",
    "this hypothesis is further supported by the fact that the @xmath78  years old , large - scale co outflow consists of single moving gas clumps , and thus accretion is indeed non - steady @xcite .",
    "another explanation could be that the c@xmath1o  ( 21 ) emission traces the densest parts of the spiral arms that are easily excited in massive disks by gravitational instabilities .",
    "indeed , the morphology of the c@xmath1o   emission resembles the density structure of a self - gravitating disk with double arms ( upper corner in fig .  [ co]a ) calculated by @xcite .",
    "moreover , the numerical simulations by @xcite imply that such disks should also develop a dual structure composed of _ an inner thin keplerian disk _ fed by a thicker self - gravitating torus with nearly uniform rotation .",
    "finally , a clumpy disk structure could be a result of a recent encounter with a nearby star or due to the gravitational interaction with a wide low - mass companion .",
    "the complex multiple outflow systems seen in the close vicinity of afgl  490 strongly support this idea ( see fig .",
    "4b in paper  i ) .    in this letter , we present clear evidence that @xmath79  m@xmath0  stars can be surrounded by keplerian disks in their earliest evolutionally phase ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "in contrast to the previously reported huge disks around such stars with radii of @xmath3  au ( e.g. , chini et al .  2004 , but see sako et al .",
    "2005 ) the afgl  490 disk is much smaller , @xmath80  au .",
    "using advanced theoretical modeling , we constrain basic disk parameters : ( 1 ) the inclination and positional angles are @xmath81 , ( 2 ) the surface density profile is @xmath82 , ( 3 ) the mass is @xmath2 1.5  m@xmath0  ( @xmath83 uncertainty ) , and ( 4 ) the disk rotation is close to kepler s law ."
