    "the one - dimensional quantum zakharov equations with initial data read    @xmath3    where the complex valued function @xmath4 is the envelope electric field and the real valued function @xmath5 is the plasma density fluctuation ( measured from its equilibrium value ) .",
    "they are defined in @xmath6 .",
    "we assume @xmath7 and @xmath8 for the study of local well - posedness .",
    "the dimensionless quantum parameter @xmath9 is the ratio between the ion plasmon energy and the electron thermal energy , where @xmath10 is planck s constant divided by @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the ion plasma frequency , @xmath13 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath14 is the electron fluid temperature .",
    "the quantum zakharov equations are obtained to describe the nonlinear interaction between high - frequency quantum langmuir waves and the low - frequency quantum ion - acoustic waves  @xcite .",
    "the formal classical limit @xmath15 yields the original zakharov equations :    @xmath16    which are one of the most important models in plasma physics @xcite .",
    "they describe the interaction between high - frequency langmuir waves and low - frequency ion - acoustic waves . for the adiabatic limit of the zakharov equations ( [ e : zakharov-1a])([e : zakharov-2a ] ) , one neglects the second order time derivative of the density fluctuation , @xmath17 , then @xmath18 implies @xmath19 and the resulting equation is the cubic nonlinear schrdinger equation @xmath20 which is known to be completely integrable and is one of most important nonlinear partial differential equations .",
    "however , for the quantum zakharov equations ( [ e : zakharov-1])([e : zakharov-2 ] ) , the adiabatic limit will be    @xmath21    if we further take the limit @xmath15 , the semiclassical limit , then @xmath19 and the cubic nonlinear schrdinger equation ( [ nls ] ) will be recovered .",
    "thus it is natural to consider @xmath22 as the quantum perturbation of the cubic nonlinear schrdinger equation .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to study the local well - posedness of one dimensional quantum zakharov system ( [ e : zakharov-1])([e : zakharov-2 ] ) with low regularity initial data .",
    "the local well - posedness of cauchy problem for the zakharov system in euclidean space has been extensively studied .",
    "we do not intend to list all the references , one can see for example  @xcite and references therein . unlike the zakharov system",
    ", there are only a few well - posedness results for the quantum zakharov system .",
    "the current results are mainly focused on higher regularity spaces , for example guo , zhang and guo  @xcite showed that @xmath23-dimensional ( @xmath24 ) quantum zakharov system is global well - posedness in @xmath25 for integer @xmath26 . since @xmath27 is the energy space , the global well - posedness is a consequence of the local well - posedness and the conservation law of quantum zakharov system ( see section 2 ) . in general ,",
    "the well - posedness results of the zakharov system as well as other dispersive equations with low regularity initial data can be established by the strichartz inequalities .",
    "the key step is to derive non - linear estimates by extensive use of strichartz inequalities which has its origin from bourgain  @xcite .",
    "for one dimensional zakharov system , ginibre , tsutsumi and velo  @xcite established the local well - posedness result in low regularity spaces by adapting a method first proposed by kenig , ponce and vega  @xcite to treat the korteweg - de vries equation which is a variant of bourgain s method .",
    "their method does not use strichartz inequalities in the derivation of non - linear estimates , and relies instead on using schwarz inequality cleverly followed by a direct estimation .",
    "similar to the method developed by ginibre , tsutumi and velo  @xcite in studying one spatial dimensional zakharov system , we combine the strichartz and schwarz inequalities to estimate the non - linear interactions .",
    "the challenge in the study of the quantum zakharov system is that the interactions of the non - linear part are much more complicated than that of the zakharov system due to the appearance of the fourth order terms as well as the quantum parameter @xmath28 in   and  .",
    "when two waves are close enough , their interactions can be treated by strichartz inequalities as in  @xcite . however , when two waves are away from each other , we have to use the schwarz inequality instead . in  @xcite , this part is not complicated and can be overcome by the change of variable argument . in our case ,",
    "the bi - harmonic operator prohibits us to apply that method .",
    "the miracle here is that we can make use of the key observation that the convoluted phase function of  waves \" is convex to get the quantitative estimates which describe the separation of waves through the bilinear analysis .",
    "it is worth noting that the lower regularity result for @xmath1 satisfies @xmath2 can not be obtained by strichartz inequalities .",
    "these quantitative estimates allow us to get the well - posedness in low regularity spaces .",
    "we believe that this ingredient will be the key for studying the quantum zakharov system in higher dimensional spaces and the other couple dispersive systems .",
    "the main result of this paper is the following .",
    "[ t : main - theorem ] for any fixed @xmath29 , the quantum zakharov system  @xmath30-@xmath31 with initial data @xmath32 is locally well - posed provided @xmath33 is in the set @xmath34 defined by @xmath35 also see figure  [ f : klm ] .",
    "the condition @xmath36 is for the convenience of discussion and the case @xmath37 is more interesting .",
    "the lowest regularity we obtained here is the pair @xmath33 which is close to @xmath38 .",
    "it is not clear whether the pair @xmath39 is optimal or not .    ]",
    "we can write the power @xmath40 as @xmath41 .",
    "heuristically , @xmath42 comes from fourth order term and @xmath43 is necessary for non - linear estimates , while @xmath44 in the denominator is due to us working on @xmath45 based spaces .",
    "the dependence of time interval for well - posedness on @xmath28 can be tracked explicitly as the @xmath46 in lemma  [ l : bilinear-1 ] and  [ l : bilinear-2 ] are of order @xmath47 respectively .",
    "they are from the estimates in section 4,5,6 where @xmath46 are of order @xmath48 in lemma  [ l : c_1_bounded ] ,  [ l : c_2_bounded ] and  [ l : c_3_bounded ] , of order @xmath49 in lemma  [ l : key - lemma-1 ] ,  [ l : key - lemma-2 ] ,  [ l : key - lemma-3 ] and  [ l : around_xi ] .",
    "those orders can be checked in the proofs of lemmas and will not be emphasized later .    the question of the singular limits of the zakharov and related systems , the klein - gordon zakharov system for example , has been studied extensively . quite often , the limiting solution ( when it exists ) satisfies a completely different nonlinear partial differential equations .",
    "the nonlinear schrdinger limit of the zakharov system is one physical problem involving plasma frequency and ion sound speed effects where such a singular limit process is interesting .",
    "the earlier results are shown in @xcite and the case when initial layer occurs was investigated by ozawa and tsutsumi in @xcite .",
    "the readers are also referred to masmoudi - nakanishi @xcite for a complete result where they were able to overcome the difficulty of the existence of a resonance frequency .",
    "the convergence of the quantum zakharov system to the zakharov system is also interesting , see @xcite for the recent result .",
    "however , the convergence in the lower regularity developed in this paper is a challenging problem and it will be our main research project in the near future .    the rest of paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we discuss the conservation laws and hydrodynamic limit ( formally ) of the quantum zakharov system . in section 3 , we reduce the well - posedness of cauchy problem of the quantum zakharov system to three key estimates . these estimates will be proved in section 4 by using the estimates built up in sections 5 and 6 . in section 5 ,",
    "we build the estimate describing the interaction of two  _ fourth order waves _ \" .",
    "finally , we prove the estimate describing the interaction of one  _ second order wave _ \" and one  _ fourth order wave _ \" in section 6 .",

    "the one - dimensional quantum zakharov equations ( [ e : zakharov-1])([e : zakharov-2 ] ) are derived from a variational principle  @xcite , @xmath68 with a lagrangian density @xmath69 where the auxiliary variable @xmath70 , satisfying @xmath71 , is introduced such that the density can be found .",
    "the variational derivative @xmath72 produces ( [ e : zakharov-1 ] ) and its complex conjugate equation , respectively .",
    "but the equation for @xmath73 is not straightforward , instead , taking the variational derivative @xmath74 we have @xmath75 which will reproduce ( [ e : zakharov-2 ] ) after differentiation with respect to @xmath76 .",
    "the lagrangian formulation allows us to systematically derive conserved quantities by means of noether s theorem , relating invariance , symmetries and conservation laws .",
    "the action ( [ action ] ) is trivially invariant under the phase transformation , i.e. , gauge invariant , @xmath77 and thus quantum zakharov equations admit the conservation law for the mass ( or the number of high frequency quanta ) @xmath78 similarly , the action is invariant under time translation , and we have the conservation for the energy ( or hamiltonian ) @xmath79 where @xmath80 . from  , we see that if @xmath81 , one can control the energy @xmath82 since @xmath83 .",
