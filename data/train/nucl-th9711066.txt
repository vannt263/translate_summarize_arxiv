    "recent experiments at the gsi laboratory have shown a relatively large yield of @xmath2 mesons @xcite in collisions involving ni@xmath3ni at 1.93 gev a. this result is surprising because the beam energy is below the threshold for the reaction @xmath4 which needs at least 2.5 gev in the lab .",
    "the production of @xmath2 mesons therefore proceeds entirely via medium effects in the nuclear matter of the colliding nuclei .",
    "an explanation for this phenomenon has been suggested in several models @xcite wherein it is argued that the mass of the @xmath2 decreases when nuclear density increases while the mass of the @xmath5 increases slightly .",
    "this would make it easier for @xmath2 mesons to be produced since the threshold for pair production becomes considerably lower .",
    "the production of kaons is therefore a test of the effects of the density of the medium and should be analyzed carefully .",
    "it has been pointed out @xcite that the relative abundance of hadrons ( excluding kaons ) in the final state can be described by using a hadronic gas model with chemical equilibrium , i.e. only two parameters , the temperature @xmath6 and the baryon chemical potential @xmath7 describe all hadronic abundances except the kaons .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to address the abundance of kaons in detail .",
    "it is well - known that imposing exact strangeness conservation introduces a suppression of strange particles if the system has very small values of the dimensionless quantity @xmath8 . for large values of @xmath8",
    "this suppression disappears rapidly .",
    "the size of the ni system is relatively large however the temperatures involved are always below 100 mev and thus these corrections have to be considered seriously",
    ". we will show in the present paper that all hadronic ratios , involving strange particles , can be explained with only three parameters , namely the temperature @xmath9 mev , the baryon chemical potential @xmath10 mev and the radius of the system , @xmath11 fm .",
    "the large variety of mesured production ratios of non - strange particles are explained with the same set of parameter values .",
    "there exists evidence that particle abundances in heavy ion collisions at higher energies are also very close to chemical equilibrium ( for a review see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) . the data from cern favor a region around @xmath12 mev and a baryon chemical potential around @xmath13 mev .",
    "the data from bnl favor a region having a lower temperature , @xmath14 mev and a larger chemical potential @xmath15 mev .",
    "the results from gsi are in a region which is @xmath16 mev and a baryon chemical potential @xmath17 mev .",
    "the data from gsi thus correspond to a low temperature but a considerably higher value of the baryon chemical potential @xmath7 .",
    "many questions are still left open .",
    "it does nt explain where the @xmath2 s are coming from or why they seem to be so `` easily '' produced despite being sub - threshold .",
    "the evidence for chemical equilibrium is very strong in our opinion .",
    "what about thermal equilibrium ?",
    "clearly the momentum spectra deviate strongly from a simple thermal distribution given by a boltzmann factor , however , many of the effects cancel out when considering ratios of hadrons as we do here .",
    "effects due to transverse flow or excluded volume cancel out in ratios ( under circumstances described in @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we would like to investigate the production of different particle species as observed at the gsi in ni ",
    "ni collisions .",
    "to impose strict strangeness conservation one projects the standard ( grand canonical ) partition function , @xmath18 , onto the state with strangeness @xmath19 @xmath20 where the fugacity factor @xmath21 has been replaced by @xmath22 since the incoming state has @xmath23 we will consider only this value in the rest of this analysis .",
    "for simplicity we present below the formalism used in boltzmann approximation .",
    "it is more complicated to use quantum  statistics but it can be done ( see e.g. @xcite . the partition function",
    "is then composed of a sum over the different particle species .",
    "those that have strangeness zero are untouched by the above operation , those that have strangeness + 1 acquire a factor @xmath24 while those with strangeness -1 acquire a factor @xmath25 .",
    "if only strangeness @xmath26 particles are present we have @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the number of particles having zero strangeness , i.e. mainly pions and nucleons .",
    "@xmath29 is defined as the sum over all particles having strangeness @xmath30 omitting the fugacity factor due to strangeness , i.e. , the contribution of @xmath31 particles to @xmath32 would be given by    @xmath33    we have checked that the presence of cascade particles does not modify our final results for the analysis of the gsi data .",
    "of course for higher temperatures cascade particles and @xmath34 s should be included .",
    "the strange and anti - strange particle numbers are not equal since there is a net baryon number in the system , e.g. there is a difference in the numbers of @xmath31 s and @xmath35 s due to the presence of the baryon chemical potential , @xmath7 . @xmath36 despite its appearance , the above expression has no imaginary part . exploiting the symmetry properties of the integrand , this can be rewritten as @xmath37 .\\ ] ] the partition function can thus be written in a compact form as @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 and @xmath41 is the part of the partition function which contains only non - strange particles .    as an example , the number of kaons is given by @xmath42 @xmath43 it is of interest to investigate the small volume limit of the above expressions since this is where the effects due to the canonical formalism are most obvious .",
    "a typical term has the following form @xmath44   , \\ ] ] which in the small volume limit will lead to @xmath45 \\times \\left [ gv\\int   { d^3p\\over ( 2\\pi)^3}e^{-e / t - i\\phi}\\right ] + \\cdots .\\ ] ] note that each time there will be two terms since otherwise the integration over @xmath46 leads to a vanishing contribution .",
    "the number of @xmath47 will thus be given by @xmath48 .",
    "\\label{eq : kplus}\\ ] ] this shows clearly that the number of particles increase quadratically with the volume . for a large system the dependence on",
    "the volume becomes linear .",
    "the additional suppression of strangeness can be seen clearly in the small volume limit above . in order to balance strangeness",
    ", the production of a kaon has to be accompanied by either an anti - kaon or by a strange baryon .",
    "this is explicitly present in equation [ eq : kplus ] .",
    "the results are not changed substantially if one includes also particles having strangeness @xmath49 and @xmath50 using the analytical methods of @xcite .",
    "as long as the baryon chemical potential is below @xmath51 800 mev the boltzmann approximation is adequate . for higher values",
    "one has to include effects due to quantum statistics . due to the low temperatures involved the width of resonances has to be taken into account .",
    "for example , an appreciable number of pions is coming from the decay of @xmath52 resonances below the mass of the @xmath52 but still within the width of the @xmath52 .",
    "for very small values of the width @xmath53 , the breit - wigner resonance shape can be replaced by a @xmath54 function : @xmath55 for large widths this is no longer possible and one has to keep the breit - wigner resonance shape .",
    "for example the integration of the boltzmann factor has to be replaced according to @xmath56   \\longrightarrow \\int d^3            p            \\int     d    s \\exp\\left[-\\frac{\\sqrt{p^2+s}}{t}\\right ] \\frac{1}{\\pi}\\frac{m\\gamma}{(s - m^2)^2+m^2\\gamma^2}.\\ ] ] the mass @xmath57 is integrated from @xmath58 to @xmath59 . in some cases , _ e.g. _",
    "@xmath60 , the lower limit goes far below the threshold limit , e.g. for the @xmath52 resonance @xmath61 . in such cases",
    "the lower limit is chosen to be the threshold value @xmath62 .",
    "we have taken care of the fact that the normalization must be adjusted accordingly since the integral over the breit - wigner factor should still give unity .      in an isospin asymmetric system",
    "there are initially four parameters , namely the temperature @xmath6 , fugacities @xmath63 and @xmath64 , and the volume @xmath65 .",
    "the charge chemical potential can be eliminated by considering the ratio of baryon- and charge content of the system .",
    "the baryon- and charge densities , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , and thus the corresponding chemical potentials , are related by the condition @xmath68 where @xmath69 measures the isospin asymmetry in the system . for the ni",
    " ni system considered here , one has @xmath70 and so there is a 4% deviation from the isospin symmetric case .",
    "the hadronic gas model contains all particles listed by the particle data group @xcite .",
    "our main result is shown in figure 1 .",
    "each experimentally measured hadronic ratio corresponds to a band in the @xmath71 plane .",
    "the width of the band corresponds to the error bar which has been reported .",
    "it is to be noted that several of these bands are almost parallel to the temperature axis .",
    "all these bands are fairly insensitive to the chosen hadronic volume .",
    "the main exception is the @xmath72 ratio .",
    "this ratio is highly sensitive to the value of the radius of the hadronic gas . in figure 1",
    "we show this for a radius of 4 fm .",
    "the dependence can be seen more quantitatively in figure 2 where one can see the @xmath72 ratio corresponding to a radius of 3.7 fm and also for 4 fm .",
    "also shown is the large volume limit which is denoted by td ( thermodynamic ) limit , corresponding to infinite volume . the temperature necessary to reproduce",
    "this ratio rapidly goes down with increasing values of the radius .",
    "this is because for a small volume there is an intrinsic suppression factor which makes it necessary to go to higher temperature in order to reproduce the same ratio .",
    "the region of overlap has a value for the baryon chemical potential of @xmath73 it is not so easy to fix the temperature because many of the lines are almost parallel to each other , but a temperature interval given by @xmath74 will give a good fit to the hadronic ratios .      a requirement of the exact strangeness conservation in an ensemble , where the hadrons @xmath76 with @xmath77 are included , leads to condition @xmath78 where hadron symbols stand for their densities at freeze - out .",
    "now the baryon chemical potential is quite convincingly fixed to the range @xmath79 , and the temperature is found to be around @xmath80 mev , so the anti - strange baryons can be neglected due to condition @xmath81 .",
    "further , the heavier resonances ( denoted by superscript * ) are not supposed to play any significant role in energies considered , so @xmath82 at the first stage , the effect of isospin asymmetry in the system is neglected , and we are led to the result ( @xmath83 and @xmath31 are not distinguished ) @xmath84 where the experimental result @xmath85 is used .",
    "when the charge chemical potential is taken into account , equation ( [ eq : ratio ] ) leads to expression @xmath86 where @xmath87 is a charge fugacity . using values @xmath88 and @xmath89 we extract the corresponding values for the charge fugacity ( -2 mev @xmath90 -6 mev ) , and obtain the result @xmath91 .",
    "similar procedure gives for neutral kaons the result @xmath92 .",
    "the data from gsi show very good agreement with a hadronic gas in chemical equilibrium having @xmath93 mev and @xmath10 mev .",
    "when comparing the gsi results with those obtained at higher energies a clear picture emerges .",
    "there is an increase in the temperature and at the same time a decrease in the baryon chemical potential @xmath7 in going from gsi to brookhaven ( bnl ) and then on to cern .",
    "this is indicated schematically in figure [ fig3 ] where we have made use of the recent compilations of sollfrank @xcite ( see also @xcite ) and of @xcite .",
    "it is not trivial to translate the values for @xmath6 and @xmath7 into values for the energy and the baryon densities .",
    "this is because one needs to know the particel numbers and not just the ratios as we have done in this paper .",
    "an estimate of these has been made recently in @xcite .",
    "a good agreement with chemical equilibrium does not mean that the particle spectra should follow exactly a boltzmann distribution since the momenta of particles can be severely affected by flow . as an example , a model with bjorken expansion in the longitudinal direction will still have its particle ratios determined by boltzmann factors even though the longitudinal distribution is nowhere near a boltzmann distribution @xcite .",
    "the main deviation from chemical equilibrium is observed in strange particle abundances .",
    "these clearly deviate from chemical equilibrium but it seems that a single parameter measuring the deviation from chemical equilibrium is sufficient to describe most of the strange particles . the necessary suppression can be fully accounted for by using exact strangeness conservation and there is no need to introduce a strangeness suppression factor @xmath94 as is the case for particle abundances measured at higher energies at cern .",
