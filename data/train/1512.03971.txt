    "our terminology is slightly different from the one used in keisler and tarski  @xcite , since finite cardinals are accessible here .",
    "note that there can be cardinals that are neither accessible , nor inaccessible .",
    "inaccessible cardinals are also called strongly inaccessible .",
    "inaccessible cardinals , if exist , are extremely large ; see , for example , kanamori  @xcite or levy  @xcite .",

    "if @xmath28 is a set and @xmath30 is an accessible cardinal , then @xmath33 has a complete embedding in a complete sublattice @xmath1 of some @xmath32 such that @xmath1 is completely generated by only three elements",

    "[ corolone ] every finite lattice is the sublattice of an appropriate three - generated _ finite _ lattice .    to point out the difference between this corollary and the afore - mentioned crawley and dean  ( * ?",
    "* theorem 7 ) , note that corollary  [ corolone ] refers to a construction that preserves finiteness .",
    "however , as opposed to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 7 ) , our corollary does not include the case when the original lattice is countably infinite .    by pudlk and tuma  @xcite",
    ", we can embed our lattice in some @xmath33 such that @xmath28 is finite .",
    "thus , theorem  [ thmmain ] is applicable .",
    "[ coroltwo ] every algebraic lattice of accessible cardinality is the _ complete _ sublattice of an _ algebraic _ lattice @xmath1 that is completely generated by three elements .",
    "theorem 7 for complete lattices in crawley and dean  @xcite pays attention to the `` degree '' of completeness , so it is more involved than its simplified form given at the beginning of this section .",
    "however , corollary  [ coroltwo ] adds two new features even to the original ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 7 ) : here the sublattice is a _",

    "note that we can easily derive the simplified form of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  7 ) for a lattice @xmath0 with accessible cardinality from corollary  [ coroltwo ] as follows : embed @xmath0 in its _ ideal lattice _ @xmath37 and apply corollary  [ coroltwo ] to @xmath37 ; in this way , we obtain that @xmath0 is ( isomorphic to ) a sublattice of @xmath1 , where @xmath1 is from corollary  [ coroltwo ] .",
    "conversely , we do not see any straightforward way to derive corollary  [ coroltwo ] directly from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  7 ) .",
    "in particular , if @xmath1 is a complete lattice completely generated by @xmath38 , then there seems to be no reason why the algebraic lattice @xmath39 should be completely generated by the set @xmath40 of principal ideals , because @xmath41 in @xmath1 need not imply that @xmath42 equals @xmath43 .    by the grtzer ",
    "schmidt theorem , see @xcite , we can assume that our lattice @xmath0 is the congruence lattice of an algebra @xmath28 .",
    "so @xmath0 is a complete sublattice of @xmath33 .",
    "since @xmath7 is accessible , the construction in @xcite shows that @xmath44 is also accessible .",
    "( this is not surprising , since the class of sets with accessible cardinalities is closed under `` reasonable '' constructions . ) hence , theorem  [ thmmain ] yields that @xmath0 is a complete sublattice of a complete sublattice @xmath1 of some @xmath32 such that @xmath1 is completely generated by three elements .",
    "it is well known , see grtzer and schmidt  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 8) or nation  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* exercise 3.6 ) , that complete sublattices of algebraic lattices are algebraic .",
    "therefore , since @xmath32 is an algebraic lattice , so is @xmath1 , as required .",
    "the rest of the paper is devoted to the proof of theorem  [ thmmain ]",
    ".    only basic knowledge of lattice theory is assumed .",
    "for example , a small part of each of the books burris and sankappanavar  @xcite , davey and priestley  @xcite , grtzer  @xcite , mckenzie , mcnulty , and taylor  @xcite , and nation  @xcite is sufficient .",
    "our approach towards theorem  [ thmmain ] has three main ingredients but they are mostly hidden behind the scenes .",
    "first , we need the fact that @xmath33 is completely generated by four elements if @xmath44 is accessible ; see @xcite and @xcite for the infinite case and strietz  @xcite and zdori  @xcite for the finite case .",
    "second , @xcite and @xcite give the vague idea that we need some auxiliary graphs .",
    "third , the appropriate graphs given in figure  [ figmhhvsz ] are taken from skublics  @xcite .",
    "his graphs are symmetric ; this explains why they are more appropriate for our plan than those in @xcite .",
    "( actually , we have not checked whether the graphs from @xcite could be used here . )",
    "note that we can not use the statements of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite in the present setting , because @xcite and @xcite are related only to the particular case @xmath45 of lemma  [ keylemma ] .",
    "hence , we borrow only the ideas and some methods from these sources without explicit further reference .",
    "a cardinal @xmath46 is _ regular _ if it is infinite and whenever @xmath18 is a set of cardinals smaller than @xmath46 and @xmath47 , then @xmath48 .",
    "for example , @xmath8 , @xmath23 , and @xmath26 are regular .",
    "let @xmath46 always denote a regular cardinal .",
    "following grtzer and kelly  @xcite , a lattice @xmath0 is _ @xmath46-complete _ if for every @xmath49 such that @xmath50 , both @xmath51 and @xmath52 exists .",
    "note that @xmath46 will always be chosen to be larger than the cardinality of the lattice we deal with , so @xmath46-completeness will simply mean the completeness of the lattice in question .",
    "we need @xmath46 only because we want to define _",
    "@xmath46-terms _ and their _ ranks _ by transfinite induction as follows .",
    "let @xmath6 be a set of variables .",
    "( later , @xmath6 will consist of three or four elements . )",
    "each element @xmath53 of @xmath6 is an @xmath46-term of rank @xmath54 .",
    "so the set of @xmath46-terms of rank 0 over @xmath6 is @xmath55 .",

    "( an alternative and more rigorous way , which will not be followed , is to consider @xmath67 a rooted tree whose leaves are labeled with variables , the rest of nodes with @xmath68 and @xmath69 , and the root is labeled by @xmath68 . ) we define @xmath70 note that the sets @xmath71 , where @xmath58 ranges over the class of ordinals , form an increasing sequence",

    "eligible pair_. for each eligible pair @xmath103 , we insert a copy of @xmath92 such that its black - filled left vertex is identified with @xmath101 while its black - filled right vertex with @xmath102 .",
    "the vertices of @xmath92 are @xmath104 . after inserting a copy of this graph for @xmath105 , its vertices are denoted by @xmath106 .",
    "the vertices @xmath107 are new elements ; they are neither in @xmath95 , nor in any other copy of an auxiliary graph that we add to @xmath95 .",
    "note that the superscript @xmath94 is indicated at some vertices like @xmath108 in figure  [ figmhhvsz ] but , in absence of space , not always .",
    "if we drop the superscripts @xmath94 , then the figure gives @xmath92 ; if we add these superscripts , then we obtain the actual copy @xmath109 of @xmath92 that we have inserted for @xmath105 .",

    "this graph is denoted by @xmath97 , in the same way as its vertex set .",
    "multiple edges between two vertices may occur , and each edge has a unique color in @xmath117 .",

    "conversely , assume that @xmath339 .",
    "hence , @xmath340 , and gives that @xmath337 .",
    "thus , @xmath336 , proving that @xmath334",
    ". this equality , , and yield that @xmath320 and @xmath341 have a common complete generating set .",
    "thus , @xmath342 . hence , using and again , @xmath343 .",
    "therefore , since @xmath308 is a complete sublattice of @xmath131 , the statement of lemma  [ keylemma ] follows .",
    "assume that @xmath28 is set with accessible cardinality at least 3 .",
    "for convenience , we can also assume that @xmath28 is not an even natural number , because otherwise we would construct a larger set @xmath344 from @xmath28 by adding a new element and then we would use that @xmath33 is isomorphic to a sublattice of @xmath345 .    for a finite @xmath28 ,",
    "it was first proved by strietz  @xcite that @xmath33 is four - generated ; however , we will use the four generators constructed by zdori  @xcite . note that these generators for @xmath346 are reproduced in (",
    "* figure 1 ) , and 33 is sufficiently large to indicate the general case for @xmath44 odd .",
    "therefore , to be in harmony with the infinite case , we use @xmath347 , @xmath348 , @xmath349 , and @xmath350 to denote zdori s generators .",
    "the superscript `` f '' indicates that we are dealing with the finite case .",
    "alternatively , we can use a different system of generators from zdori  @xcite , which are also given for @xmath351 in @xcite ; these generators will be denoted by @xmath352 , @xmath353 , @xmath354 , and @xmath355 .",
    "whichever of the two systems is considered , the join of two appropriately chosen generators is clearly @xmath356 .",
    "namely , @xmath357 thus , we have many choices to fulfill the conditions @xmath358 and @xmath359 of lemma  [ keylemma ] ; let , say , @xmath360 .",
    "if @xmath28 is infinite but accessible , then we know from @xcite and @xcite that @xmath33 is completely generated by four elements .",
    "let @xmath361 , @xmath362 , @xmath363 , @xmath364 and @xmath365 , @xmath366 , @xmath367 , @xmath368 denote the complete generating sets constructed in @xcite and @xcite , respectively . here",
    "the superscript `` i '' comes from `` infinite '' .",
    "again , we can pick two generators whose join is @xmath356 , but it suffices to see that one of the following six joins equals @xmath356 : @xmath369 let , say , @xmath370 .    next ,",
    "if @xmath28 is infinite , then let @xmath371 , and consider the set @xmath97 constructed before lemma  [ keylemma ] . clearly , @xmath372 .",
    "denote by @xmath373 the complete sublattice of @xmath306 completely generated by its three - element subset @xmath374 .",
    "since @xmath375 and @xmath131 from lemma  [ keylemma ] is clearly a complete sublattice of @xmath373 , lemma  [ keylemma ] gives that @xmath376 now , let @xmath34 . since @xmath377 , we have an isomorphism @xmath378 .",
    "clearly , @xmath379 is isomorphic to @xmath373 and it is a complete sublattice of @xmath32 .",
    "also , @xmath1 is completely generated by the three - element set @xmath380 , and @xmath33 is isomorphic to a complete sublattice of @xmath1 .",
    "this proves the theorem for @xmath28 infinite .",
    "if @xmath28 is finite , then we can drop `` complete '' from the consideration above .",
    "let @xmath381 ; it is finite by construction . by , @xmath33 is isomorphic to a sublattice of the three - generated @xmath373 and @xmath373 is a sublattice of @xmath32 .",
