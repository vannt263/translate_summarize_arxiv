    "as the nearest large external galaxy , m31 provides an unprecedented laboratory for probing galaxy evolution . the stellar content in the central few arc minutes of m31 provides a fossil record that can be used to trace the evolution of the bulge , and possibly even the origins of the super - massive black hole ( dressler & richstone 1988 ; kormendy 1988 ) and double nucleus ( lauer et al . 1993 ) . because of the obvious problems posed by high stellar densities , most studies of the stellar content near the center of m31 have relied upon integrated spectra .",
    "bica , alloin , & schmidt ( 1990 ) used evolutionary synthesis techniques to conclude that the inner bulge of m31 is dominated by an old , metal - rich component , although signatures of an intermediate - age population contributing 10  20% of the visible light , and even a component with an age of a few myr , were also found .",
    "davidge ( 1997 ) used a grid of long - slit spectra to map the stellar content within 30 arcsec of the nucleus , and concluded that ( 1 ) younger , more metal - rich populations occur at smaller radii , ( 2 ) [ mg / fe ] varies with radius , in the sense that [ mg / fe ] decreases towards smaller radii , as expected if the youngest stars formed from material enriched by sn i , whereas the main body of the bulge formed from material enriched by sn ii , and ( 3 ) the radial gradients in stellar content differ from those in the elliptical galaxies ngc 3379 and ngc 4472 , where age and [ mg / fe ] appear not to change with radius .",
    "silchenko , burenkov , & vlasyuk ( 1998 ) conclude that the stars near the nucleus of m31 are three times younger than those in the surrounding bulge .",
    "studies of resolved stars provide a direct means of probing stellar content and checking the results from integrated spectra , although only the brightest objects can typically be observed , and data with high angular resolutions are required to overcome crowding .",
    "there is an absence of main sequence stars hotter than b0v ( bohlin et al .",
    "1985 ) in the m31 bulge , although a large population of relatively faint hot stars is present in the uv images ( brown et al . 1998 ) . while originally thought to be post - agb objects ( king et al .",
    "1992 , ferguson & davidsen 1993 ) , it is more likely that these sources are evolving on the horizontal branch ( brown et al .",

    "the existence of a very bright stellar component in the m31 bulge has long been questioned , and it has been argued that such a population could be an artifact of crowding ( depoy et al . 1993 ; renzini 1998 ; jablonka et al .",

    "high angular resolution @xmath6 and @xmath7 images are used to investigate the brightness and spatial distribution of stars evolving on the upper portions of the agb in two m31 inner bulge fields , with the goal of gaining insight into the nature and origin of the brightest stars in the m31 bulge .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "the observations and procedures used to reduce the data , as well as the methods used to measure stellar brightnesses , are discussed in  2 .",
    "the stellar contents of the two fields are investigated in  3 and  4 , while a summary and discussion of the results follows in  5 .",
    "the data were recorded during two observing runs with the kir imager and cfht adaptive optics bonnette ( aob ; rigaut et al .",
    "kir contains a @xmath8 hg : cd : te detector , with each pixel subtending 0.034 arcsec on a side ; hence , the total imaged field is @xmath9 arcsec .",
    "the cfht aob uses natural guide stars as reference beacons , and contains a 19 element curvature wavefront sensor ( wfs ) and a 19 electrode deformable bimorph mirror .",
    "the signal from the wfs is sampled at a frequency of 1000 hz .",
    "the system is operated with automatic mode gain optimization to adapt to guide star brightness and atmospheric conditions , and is designed to deliver diffraction - limited angular resolution at near - infrared wavelengths during median mauna kea seeing conditions ; however , if the seeing degrades from its median value , or the guide star is faint , then the delivered fwhm is intermediate between the diffraction - limited and uncorrected cases .    a field 2.6 arcmin south west of the galaxy nucleus , centered on the @xmath10 star gsc 0280102015 ( ra 00:42:45.1 , dec @xmath1141:13:31.3 e2000 ) , which served as the reference source for ao compensation , was observed through @xmath5 , and @xmath7 filters on the night of ut september 5 1998 .",
    "the total integration time was 20 minutes per filter , with five 60 sec exposures being recorded at each corner of a @xmath12 arcsec square dither pattern .",
    "the seeing conditions were poor by mauna kea standards , and stars in the final images have very low strehl rations , with fwhm = 0.35 arcsec .",
    "this field will be refered to as the ` bulge ' field for the remainder of the paper .",
    "the central field of m31 was observed through @xmath6 and @xmath7 filters during the night of ut",
    "september 11 , 2000 , with the semi - stellar nucleus of m31 serving as the reference source for ao compensation .",
    "the exposure times and observing strategy were the same as those employed for the bulge field .",
    "the seeing conditions were much better than during the 1998 run , and stars in the final images have fwhm = 0.27 arcsec in @xmath13 , 0.15 arcsec in @xmath14 , and @xmath15 arcsec in @xmath7 ; the diffraction pattern produced by the telescope optics is clearly evident in the point spread functions ( psfs ) constructed from the @xmath14 and @xmath7 images .",
    "this field will be refered to as the ` central ' field for the remainder of the paper .",
    "the data were reduced using the procedures described by davidge & courteau ( 1999 ) , which correct for dark current , flat - field variations , thermal emission along the optical path , and variability in the dc sky level .",
    "the final @xmath7 images of both fields are shown in figures 1 and 2 .",
    "the brightnesses of individual stars were measured with the psf - fitting program allstar ( stetson & harris 1988 ) , using psfs and star lists obtained from tasks in daophot ( stetson 1987 ) .",
    "a single psf was constructed for each image .",
    "while anisoplanicity causes the psf to vary with distance from the reference source , past experience indicates that the use of a single psf does not introduce large photometric uncertainties over the kir field ( e.g. davidge & courteau 1999 ; davidge 2001 ) .",
    "aperture corrections were determined from growth curve analysis of the psf stars after subtracting neighboring objects , and the estimated uncertainty in the aperture corrections is @xmath16 magnitude .",
    "both datasets were recorded during clear sky conditions , and the photometric calibration was determined from observations of ukirt faint standard stars ( casali & hawarden 1992 ) .",
    "the brightnesses of the standard stars were measured using apertures established by growth curve analysis , and the uncertainties in the photometric zeropoints is @xmath17 mag .",
    "unresolved stars create a non - uniform background in both fields , which complicates efforts to measure local sky levels and obtain reliable photometry .",
    "this background was removed using the iterative technique described by davidge , le fvre , & clark ( 1991 ) .",
    "background structure was mapped by applying a @xmath18 arcsec running median filter to star - subtracted frames , and the result was subtracted from the images prior to obtaining a final set of photometric measurements .",
    "this procedure does not contribute additional random noise to the data because of the large smoothing kernel used to construct the background frame .",
    "artificial star experiments were used to estimate the uncertainties in the photometric measurements , calibrate systematic effects , which can be significant for stars near the faint limit of the data , and estimate incompleteness .",
    "the brightnesses of artificial stars were measured using the same procedures that were applied to the actual data , including background subtraction .",
    "the artificial star experiments assume a single psf for each field , and so do not account for anisoplanicity ; however , the good agreement between the predicted and observed scatter in the bulge field cmds (  3 ) confirms that anisoplanicity does not dominate the uncertainties in the photometry .",
    "the @xmath19 and @xmath20 cmds of the bulge field are shown in figure 3 .",
    "the uncertainties predicted from the artificial star experiments match the scatter in the data .",
    "not only does this agreement lend confidence to the predictions made from the artificial star experiments , but it also indicates that random uncertainties in the photometric measurements , rather than star - to - star differences in intrinsic properties , are the main sources of scatter in these data .",
    "the stars plotted in figure 3 are evolving on the upper agb .",
    "there is a locus of stars near the blue edge of the @xmath20 cmd that runs from @xmath21 at @xmath22 to @xmath23 at @xmath1 ; the @xmath19 and @xmath20 cmds of the m32 outer field studied by davidge ( 2000a ) also show a well - defined sequence at the bright end .",
    "this sequence disappears near @xmath24 in figure 3 , at which point the cmd broadens .",
    "this broadening is not due to the rgb - tip , as this feature occurs near @xmath25 at the distance of m31 .",
    "the projected distance of the bulge field from the nucleus of m31 is 0.6 kpc , which is comparable to the projected separation between bw and the galactic center ( gc ) .",
    "frogel & whitford ( 1987 ) studied the photometric properties of m giants in bw , and found that late m giants typically have @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "if shifted to the distance of m31 , a late m giant from bw would have @xmath28 , and the colors of stars in the m31 bulge field at this brightness match the typical values for m giants in bw .",
    "the peak brightness in the m31 bulge field is similar to that in bw .",
    "the brightest star in figure 3 has @xmath29 , and is 0.3 mag brighter than the main body of the giant branch , which has m@xmath30 if @xmath31 ( van den bergh 2000 ) ; this distance modulus for m31 is adopted for the remainder of the paper .",
    "the brightest star in the frogel & whitford ( 1987 ) sample is number 239 , which has m@xmath32 , while star number 181 , which is their second brightest object , has m@xmath33 .",
    "the 0.5 mag gap in @xmath3 between the brightest and second brightest star in the frogel & whitford compilation suggests that objects like star 239 may be rare , perhaps because they are long period variables viewed at the peak of their cycle .",
    "consequently , if star 181 is adopted as a representative example of the bright stellar content in bw , then the peak @xmath3 brightness in the m31 bulge field is similar to that in bw .",
    "frogel & whitford ( 1987 ) derived @xmath34band bolometric corrections for giants in bw as a function of @xmath35 , and their calibration was applied to the m31 bulge field measurements to investigate the bolometric lf of stars in this field .",
    "the resulting lf , corrected for incompleteness using the results from the artificial star experiments , is shown in figure 4 .",
    "also shown in this figure is the bolometric lf of bw , constructed from the entries listed in table 1 of frogel & whitford ( 1987 ) , but assuming a distance modulus of 14.5 ( reid 1993 ) .",
    "the bw lf , which has been scaled to match the total number of stars in the m31 lf when m@xmath36 , agrees with the m31 measurements to within the estimated uncertainties , indicating that the bright stellar contents in the bulges of m31 and the milky - way are similar .",
    "rich & mould ( 1991 ) and rich et al . ( 1993 ) obtained deep @xmath13 and @xmath3 images of five m31 bulge and inner disk fields , and the ridgelines in the cmds constructed from these data have @xmath35 colors that are consistent with the cfht bulge field data .",
    "the rich et al .",
    "data also show a tendency for peak brightness to increase towards smaller radii .",
    "for example , the brightest giants in rich et al .",
    "( 1993 ) field 1 , located 2.1 arcmin from the center of m31 , have @xmath37 , while the brightest stars in their field 3 , located 3.9 arcmin from the nucleus , have @xmath38 ; the main body of the giant branch in their field 3 starts at @xmath39 , which is in rough agreement with what is seen in figure 3 .    the cfht bulge field and rich et al .",
    "( 1993 ) field 1 have similar projected distances from the center of m31 , and the peak brightnesses measured from these data differ by roughly 1 magnitude in @xmath3 , in the sense that the peak brightness infered from the rich et al .",
    "data is brighter .",
    "the 0.35 arcsec fwhm angular resolution of the cfht data is much better than the rich et al .",
    "( 1993 ) data , which have fwhm in the range 1  1.2 arcsec , and this can have a major impact on the measured peak brightness ; indeed , rich et al .",
    "( 1993 ) suggest that the peak brightness in their field 1 may be affected by crowding . to confirm this",
    ", the cfht data were convolved with a gaussian to simulate 1 arcsec seeing .",
    "daophot and allstar were then used to measure stellar brightnesses in the resulting smoothed image , and the @xmath20 cmds of the raw and smoothed datasets are compared in figure 5 .",
    "the peak stellar brightness in the smoothed dataset is markedly brighter than in the unsmoothed data , confirming the suggestion made by rich et al .",
    "( 1993 ) that the brightest stars in their field 1 are blends .",
    "stephens et al .",
    "( 2001b ) investigated the stellar content of fields surrounding the globular clusters g174 and g177 , which have projected distances from the center of m31 that are comparable to the cfht bulge field .",
    "these data reveal unexpected field - to - field differences in stellar density , as the density of stars is greatest near g177 , even though g174 is significantly closer to the center of m31 .",
    "the brightest field stars near g174 and g177 have @xmath35 colors between 1 and 2 , in broad agreement with what is seen in figure 3 . however , the brightest stars have m@xmath40 , which is roughly 0.3 mag fainter than measured from the cfht data .",
    "the angular resolution of the cfht data is almost a factor of two worse than the nicmos data , and so the possibility that the difference in peak brightness is due to crowding is an obvious avenue for investigation . in an effort to determine",
    "if the difference in peak stellar brightness between the nicmos and cfht data is due to image quality , synthetic @xmath14 and @xmath3 datasets with stellar densities comparable to that in the g177 field were created using routines in the iraf artdata package ; the g177 field was selected for detailed modelling because it has a stellar density that is similar to the cfht bulge field .",
    "synthetic @xmath14 and @xmath3 datasets with fwhm = 0.19 arcsec and fwhm = 0.35 arcsec were constructed .",
    "an agb sequence peaking at k = 16 and with a power - law exponent -0.3 , which is comparable to that seen in the galactic bulge ( e.g. davidge 2000b ) , was created .",
    "the density of agb stars was fixed according to the number of objects observed in the top @xmath3 magnitude interval in the g177 field .",
    "an rgb component was also included , with the peak brightness and relative number density of these stars , measured with respect to the agb , based on those seen in the outer regions of m32 by davidge ( 2000a ) .",
    "the agb and rgb sequences were terminated at @xmath41 , which is 2.5 mag below the approximate faint limit of the cfht data ; over 10000 stars were thus added to each frame .",
    "finally , all of the stars were assigned an @xmath42 color of 0.0 , and the psf was assumed to be a gaussian .",
    "the simulations are idealised in that they do not include the effects of , among other factors , ( 1 ) residuals in the flat - field and thermal background patterns , ( 2 ) anisoplanicity , and ( 3 ) intrinsic star - to - star color variations . hence , the observed scatter in the @xmath19 cmds obtained from the simulated images , which are shown in figure 6 , is significantly smaller than in the actual observations .",
    "nevertheless , these simulations indicate that ( 1 ) crowding produces a modest population of spuriously bright sources in the g177 field even when fwhm = 0.19 arcsec , and ( 2 ) the number of such sources increases only by a factor of @xmath43 when the fwhm = 0.35 arcsec .    the most conspicuous artifacts of crowding in figure 6 are sources that are 0.4 - 0.5 magnitude brighter than the agb - tip ; while two such objects are seen in the 0.19 arcsec dataset , three are present in the 0.35 arcsec data .",
    "there is also a population of objects @xmath44 magnitude above the agb - tip in both datasets .",
    "aside from the easily identifiable population of blends , in both cases the agb - tip at @xmath45 is well - defined , although with 0.35 arcsec fwhm images the peak brightness might be infered to be 0.1 mag brighter than when the fwhm = 0.19 arcsec .",
    "thus , crowding will cause the peak stellar brightness measured from the cfht data to be at most 0.1 mag brighter than that measured from the nicmos data .",
    "these simulations suggest that the difference in peak brightness with respect to the stephens et al .",
    "( 20001b ) data is not due entirely to crowding .",
    "perhaps the photometric calibrations of the two datasets differ at the 0.1  0.2 magnitude level , and this speculation will require an independent set of observations to be confirmed . for the time being ,",
    "it is worth noting that the peak brightness and number density of the brightest stars measured in the cfht bulge field are consistent with the central m31 field (  4 ) . not only",
    "does this consistency lend confidence to the photometric calibration of the cfht data , which were recorded over two observing runs , but it also reinforces the nature of the brightest objects as individual stars , and not artifacts of crowding . the excellent agreement between",
    "the cfht bulge field and bw lfs in figure 4 is also reassuring .",
    "the rgb - tip brightnesses of m31 and m32 agree to within 0.2 mag in @xmath46 ( davidge & jones 1992 , davidge 1993 ) , suggesting that these galaxies are roughly equidistant , and this simplifies efforts to compare the bright stellar contents of these systems .",
    "such a comparison is of interest since there are indications that m31 and m32 interacted in the past ( byrd 1975 , 1978 ; sofue & kato 1981 ) , raising the possiblity of co - ordinated major star - forming episodes .",
    "moreover , luppino & tonry ( 1993 ) studied surface brightness flucuations in both galaxies at infrared wavelengths , and found significant differences in the characteristic flucuation brightness .",
    "differences in the bright stellar contents of these systems might then be expected .",
    "the @xmath3 lfs of the m32 outer and m31 bulge fields are compared in figure 7 , where the m32 lf has been scaled to match the stellar density in the m31 bulge field using the @xmath2-band surface brightnesses measured by kent ( 1987 ) .",
    "it is evident that the m31 and m32 lfs differ by roughly a factor of three between @xmath47 and @xmath48 , and the remainder of this section is devoted to exploring possible causes of this difference .",
    "the stellar density in the m31 bulge field is significantly higher than in the m32 outer field ( @xmath49 for the m31 bulge field versus @xmath50 for the outer m32 field ) , raising the possibility that the difference in figure 7 could be due to crowding ; indeed , the relative differences between the m31 bulge and m32 lfs in figure 7 increases towards fainter brightnesses , as expected if crowding were a factor .",
    "however , simple arguements suggest that crowding does not significantly affect star counts in the m31 bulge field at the brightnesses where differences with respect to m32 are seen .",
    "if it is assumed that the m31 bulge and m32 have similar stellar contents , then the scaled m32 lf predicts that there will be 1850 stars with @xmath51 in the m31 bulge field , most of which are evolving near the rgb - tip .",
    "if each resolution element has a diameter comparable to the fwhm of the psf , then there will be roughly 200 blends among these sources in the bulge field , and these blended objects will appear as sources with @xmath52 ; after correcting for incompleteness , this is roughly 10% of the objects detected with @xmath53 in the bulge field .",
    "a similar calculation shows that an even smaller fraction of the sources at @xmath28 are blends .",
    "thus , blending can not produce the factor of three difference between the m31 and m32 datasets .",
    "the comparison in figure 7 assumes that m31 and m32 are equidistant .",
    "however , the observed differences could be produced if the bright stellar contents of these systems are in fact similar but their distance moduli differ by @xmath54 dex , in the sense that m32 is more distant .",
    "this is not consistent with the rgb - tip brightnesses of these systems .",
    "davidge ( 1993 ) finds that the rgb - tip occurs at @xmath55 in m31 .",
    "while the rgb - tip is not well - defined in m32 , it appears to be at least as bright as in m31 , and may even be 0.2 mag brighter ( freedman 1989 ; davidge & jones 1992 )",
    ". if m32 is closer than m31 then the actual differences between the bright stellar contents of the two fields will be even greater than indicated in figure 7 .",
    "the comparison in figure 7 assumes that the @xmath56 colors of the two fields are similar , and this may not be the case .",
    "frogel et al . ( 1978 ) and persson et al . (",
    "1980 ) published wide aperture ( @xmath57 arcsec ) @xmath58 colors of m32 and m31 , and these data indicate that the @xmath59 color of m32 is @xmath60 mag bluer than m31 .",
    "however , such a difference in color can account for only part of the differences in figure 7 .    in summary ,",
    "crowding and differences in broad - band colors may account for roughly one third of the difference seen in figure 7 ; thus , it appears that the agb lfs of the m31 bulge and m32 are intrinsically different , in that the relative density of agb stars in m32 with @xmath3 between 16.5 and 17.5 is lower than in the m31 bulge . in  4 this comparison is extended to data sampling the central regions of both galaxies .",
    "the stellar density climbs rapidly with decreasing radius near the center of m31 , with the result that the degree of crowding , which affects the completeness fraction and photometric errors , varies significantly across the central field .",
    "given the steep density gradient , and also recognizing that changes in stellar content could occur over small angular scales near the galaxy center , it was decided to investigate the stellar content in 4 annuli centerered on the nuclear source p2 .",
    "it is unlikely that individual stars are resolved with the current data within a few arcsec of the galaxy nucleus . using near - infrared images of the galactic center that were processed to simulate the appearance of this field if viewed at the distance of m31 , davidge et al .",
    "( 1997 ) concluded that any objects detected at @xmath61 m within @xmath62 arcsec of the m31 nucleus , which corresponds to the point at which the kinematic and photometric properties of m31 depart from the trends defined at larger radii ( kormendy & bender 1999 ) , are likely blends of fainter stars , even when working at angular resolutions near the diffraction limit of a 4 metre telescope .",
    "however , as demonstrated below , the effects of blending decrease significantly at distances in excess of 2 arcsec of the nucleus ; although blending still occurs at these radii , the effects can at least be monitored with simulations .",
    "working outwards from 2 arcsec , the radial extent of each annulus was defined such that the number of stars between @xmath63 and @xmath64 was more - or - less evenly distributed between the annuli .",
    "the inner and outer radii of each annulus , with distances measured from the nuclear source p2 , are listed in table 1 .",
    "the @xmath19 cmds of each annulus are shown in figure 8 ; the @xmath65 cmds are not considered here because of the relatively poor angular resolution of the @xmath13 data , and the resulting complications introduced by blending .",
    "the ridgelines of the agb sequences in all 4 annuli and the bulge field are in excellent agreement .",
    "the brightest stars have @xmath42 = 0.4 , which is consistent with the colors of late m giants in bw ( e.g. table 3 of frogel & whitford 1987 ) .",
    "the scatter predicted by the artificial star experiments matches the width of the giant sequences in all 4 annuli , indicating that random uncertainties in the photometric measurements , rather than an intrinsic dispersion in stellar properties , dominate the width of the cmds .",
    "the cmds of annuli 3 and 4 and the bulge field are very similar : in each case the main stellar sequence terminates near @xmath66 , and there is a spray of stars @xmath60 mag above this point .",
    "it is also worth noting that the bright portions of the cmds of annuli 3 and 4 are similar to the simulations shown in figure 6 . as for annuli 1 and 2 ,",
    "the agb sequences are continuous to brighter values than in annuli 3 and 4 , peaking near @xmath39 in annulus 2 , and @xmath67 in annulus 1 .",
    "an increase in peak stellar brightness towards progressively more crowded environments is a classic signature of blending .",
    "the stellar density in annulus 1 is roughly twice that in annulus 4 , and so pairs of sub - regions in annulus 4 were summed to create simulated fields with densities comparable to that in annulus 1 .",
    "two pairs of @xmath68 pixel regions in annulus 4 were summed , and the brightnesses of stars in the summed images were then measured using daophot .",
    "the cmds of sources in the sub - regions prior to , and after , summing are compared in figure 9 .",
    "the cmds of sources in the summed fields and in annulus 1 are very similar , lending confidence to the simulations .",
    "it is evident from figure 9 that a factor of two increase in stellar density has a marked influence on the bright portions of the cmd at these densities , in that the peak brightness is elevated by 0.1 - 0.2 mag in @xmath3 .",
    "hence , the apparent trend of increasing peak giant branch brightness with decreasing radius in figure 8 is the result of blending ; this is contrary to the conclusion reached by davidge et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , who did not have the benefit of data obtained at larger radii to gauge the effects of blending .",
    "the number density of infrared - bright stars scales with @xmath69band surface brightness throughout the inner bulge of m31 .",
    "this is demonstrated in figure 10 , where the @xmath3 lfs of annuli 1  4 are compared with the @xmath3 lf of the bulge field , after the latter was scaled to match the mean @xmath2-band surface brightness in each annulus based on the kent ( 1987 ) light profile ; the lfs in this figure have been corrected for incompleteness , and are restricted to the bright end where sample incompleteness does not exceed 70% .",
    "the lfs of annuli 3 and 4 are well matched by the lf of the bulge field at all brightnesses .",
    "there is an excess number of sources with @xmath39 in annuli 1 and 2 when compared with the scaled bulge field population , and the simulations discussed in the previous paragraph suggest that this is the result of crowding , although the agreement at @xmath45 and @xmath47 is excellent .",
    "it thus appears that the radial distribution of the brightest stars at infrared wavelengths in the m31 bulge tracks the @xmath69band light profile of the galaxy , even to within a few arcsec of the nucleus .",
    "local mass density influences the star - forming history of regions within galaxies ( e.g. bell & de jong 2000 ; martinelli , matteucci , & colafrancesco 1998 ; franx & illingworth 1990 ) ; galaxy - to - galaxy comparisons between areas having similar densities will remove this dependence , and thereby provide a better means of searching for inherent differences in stellar content .",
    "davidge et al .",
    "( 2000 ) obtained @xmath14 and @xmath3 observations with 0.12 arcsec fwhm resolution of the central regions of m32 , and the mean surface brightness in region 3 of the davidge et al .",
    "( 2000 ) study is comparable to that in annuli 2 and 3 of the m31 central field .",
    "the @xmath3 lfs of m32 region 3 and the sum of annuli 2 and 3 are compared in figure 11 .",
    "the agreement between the m31 and m32 lfs is much better than in figure 7 , although the m31 and m32 lfs differ by a significant amount at @xmath47 , and the m31 lf falls consistently above that of m32 when @xmath70 , as would be expected from figure 7 .",
    "nevertheless , the improved agreement between the m31 and m32 lfs at the faint end suggests that crowding may affect significantly the comparison in figure 7 at @xmath71 .",
    "we conclude that while the comparisons between the lfs of the m31 bulge and m32 in figures 7 and 11 are _ suggestive _ of a difference in bright stellar content , in the sense that the number density of moderately bright agb stars is lower in m32 than in the bulge of m31 , the results are far from conclusive , and should be confirmed with data having higher angular resolutions to reduce the effects of crowding .",
    "images with angular resolutions approaching the diffraction limit of the 3.6 metre cfht have been used to investigate the infrared - bright stellar content of the inner bulge of m31 . the number density of the brightest stars in @xmath3 scales with @xmath69band surface brightness in the central few arcmin of the galaxy .",
    "this indicates that ( 1 ) these objects are well mixed throughout the main body of the inner bulge , and thus belong to a population that formed in a highly coherent manner , and ( 2 ) the brightest stars do not belong to the disk ( see also rich et al .",
    "1993 ) , since the light profile of the galaxy is dominated by the bulge at small radii .",
    "previous investigations of the stellar content of the m31 bulge are reviewed in  5.1 , and it is concluded that the bulge is dominated by a population of old stars . building on this result ,",
    "it is argued in  5.2 that the infrared - bright agb stars are old objects , and this interpretation is consistent with the spatial distribution of these stars .      in recent years",
    "there has been a growing realization that the bulges of spiral galaxies do not evolve in isolation ; rather , the diversity evident in the central morphological ( e.g. carollo , stiavelli , & mack 1998 ) and overall structural ( carollo 1999 ) characteristics of spiral galaxies suggests that bulges are influenced by external environmental factors .",
    "the disk is an obvious source of star - forming material , and evidence that the evolution of the bulge and surrounding disk are coupled comes from the correlated ages ( peletier & balcells 1996 ) and structural characteristics ( andredakis , peletier , & balcells 1995 ) of these systems .",
    "bar instabilities ( e.g. friedli & benz 1993 , 1995 ) , galaxy - galaxy interactions ( e.g. barnes & hernquist 1992 , mihos & hernquist 1996 ) , and dynamical friction ( noguchi 1999 , 2000 ) are three mechanisms by which gas and stars from the disk can be channeled into the central regions of bulges .    is there evidence for a mixture of stellar ages in the bulge of m31 ?",
    "imaging surveys indicate that the bulge of m31 does not contain young stars .",
    "the brightest members of a very young population have blue colors , and brown et al .",
    "( 1998 ) argue that the majority of resolved sources detected in the uv near the nucleus of m31 are evolving on the extended hb rather than the main sequence .",
    "based on the faint limit of their data , brown et al .",
    "( 1998 ) conclude that the youngest uv - bright stars in the m31 bulge have an age in excess of 250 myr .",
    "spectroscopic studies at visible wavelengths suggest that stars spanning a range of ages are present within a few arcsec of the center of m31 . both davidge ( 1997 ) and silchenko et al .",
    "( 1998 ) find evidence for an age gradient near the center of the galaxy , indicating that any intermediate age component in the central regions of m31 is centrally concentrated , and has a spatial distribution that differs from that of the main body of the bulge .",
    "the intermediate - age population does not dominate the innermost regions of the m31 bulge .",
    "bica et al .",
    "( 1990 ) used evolutionary synthesis techniques to investigate the integrated visible spectrum of the central few arcsec of m31 and found that , even near the galaxy center , the bulge is dominated by an old population .",
    "in addition to an intermediate - age component that contributes a modest fraction of the integrated light at visible wavelengths , bica et al .",
    "( 1990 ) also found evidence of stars as young as 10 myr , although the presence of such a population is not supported by uv imaging data .",
    "there is other evidence indicating that the bulges of type sbc and earlier spirals are dominated by old populations . in the case of the milky - way ,",
    "feltzing & gilmore ( 2000 ) examined hst images of galactic bulge fields , and concluded that disk contamination is responsible for the relatively bright blue stars that have heretofore been associated with an intermediate - age population .",
    "once disk contamination is taken into account , feltzing & gilmore ( 2000 ) conclude that the main body of the bulge has an old age , in agreement with the bulge ( minniti 1995 ) globular cluster system ( e.g. ortolani et al .",
    "1995 ; fullton et al .",
    "1995 ) . finally , the colors of nearby ( peletier et al .",
    "1999 ) and distant ( abraham et al . 1999 ) spiral galaxies indicate that the bulges of these systems contain a significant component that formed early - on .",
    "the central regions of the galaxy contain stars spanning a range of ages .",
    "there are compact star clusters near the gc ( cotera et al .",
    "1996 , figer et al .",
    "1999 ) with ages of a few myr , indicating that star formation can ( and does ) occur in the innermost regions of the galaxy .",
    "while it can be argued that these clusters do not belong to the bulge , they have short dynamical timescales ( e.g. figer et al .",
    "1999 ) , and hence quickly evaporate and contribute to the field population in the innermost regions of the galaxy .",
    "we speculate that the centrally concentrated intermediate age population in m31 , which has a spatial distribution that is different from the underlying bulge , may be an artifact of an earlier star - forming event similar to that recently experienced by the gc .    in summary ,",
    "while signatures of an intermediate age population may be present in integrated spectra of the center of m31 , this population is centrally concentrated , and is not a major constituent of the bulge , which is dominated by old stars .",
    "a dominant old population is consistent with the non - solar [ mg / fe ] ratio of stars in the m31 bulge found by davidge ( 1997 ) , which is suggestive of a rapid initial chemical enrichment by sn ii , as expected if the m31 bulge experienced a rapid ( t @xmath72 gyr ) collapse during early epochs .",
    "the bulge of m31 has apparently not been subject to the external sources of star forming material or intermediate age and younger stars discussed in the opening paragraph of this section .",
    "the brightest agb stars in the m31 bulge follow the integrated light profile of the galaxy and have a peak brightness that does not change measureably with radius .",
    "the brightest stars at infrared wavelengths are therefore well mixed throughout the inner bulge ; these stars can not belong to an intermediate - age population , which the spectroscopic data suggests is more centrally concentrated than the main body of the bulge ( davidge 1997 ) .",
    "thus , the infrared - bright agb stars likely belong to the old population that dominates the bulge of m31 .",
    "the brightest stars in the compact elliptical galaxy m32 share common characteristics with their counterparts in the bulge of m31 in that they ( 1 ) have a similar peak brightness , and ( 2 ) are uniformly mixed throughout the galaxy ( davidge 2000a ; davidge et al .",
    "the brightness of the agb - tip is more sensitive to metallicity than age in stellar systems with ages exceeding a few gyr .",
    "if the mdf of the m31 bulge field is similar to that in bw , then the majority of stars in this field will have metallicities close to solar , and there will also be a population of super metal - rich objects ( mcwilliam & rich 1994 ) .",
    "agb - tip stars in old moderately metal - rich globular clusters have brightnesses approaching those of the brightest stars in m32 and the m31 bulge ; for example , stars as bright as m@xmath73 are present in the [ fe / h ] = -0.34 ( harris 1996 ) globular cluster ngc 6553 ( guarnieri , renzini , & ortolani 1997 ) , and even brighter agb - tip stars should occur in a population that is more metal - rich .",
    "we thus suggest that the brightest agb stars in m32 and the galactic and m31 bulges are very metal - rich : these stars are bright not because of their age , but because of their chemical composition . given that the mean metallicity of m32 is lower than that in the bulge of m31 ( bica et al .",
    "1990 ) , then the number density of bright agb stars at a given surface brightness should be lower in the former than in the latter , and this is consistent with the comparisons between the @xmath3 lfs of these systems , which are discussed in  3 and 4 , although clearly the differences seen between the bright stellar contents of m32 and the m31 bulge need to be confirmed with data having higher angular resolutions .",
    "the brightest stars in m32 and the m31 bulge have similar peak brightnesses ; given that the brightness of the agb - tip depends more on metallicity than age among old populations , then it might be anticipated that the brightest stars in these systems have similar metallicities , and this prediction can be tested spectroscopically .",
    "the targets are relatively bright , with @xmath74 ; hence , the observational challenge is not one of obtaining a large s / n ratio , but of resolving individual stars in crowded environments .",
    "ao - fed integral - field spectrographs will be essential for obtaining uncontaminated spectra of these stars ."
