    "quantum phase transitions occur when ground state properties of interacting many - body systems dramatically change under tiny changes of parameters in a parent hamiltonian at zero temperature  @xcite .",
    "a remarkable prediction is that the universality class of phase transitions can be completely characterized by a set of critical exponents which encode how physical observables change across the transition point .",
    "however , finding critical exponents is a problem of tremendous analytical and computational difficulty as it involves an exponentially large hilbert space due to diverging correlation length .",
    "a traditional approach to study quantum critical phenomena is via real - space renormalization group ( rg ) transformation  @xcite . to be specific ,",
    "consider a spin-@xmath5 model governed by some hamiltonian @xmath6 with local interactions ( fig .",

    "we then obtain a renormalized hamiltonian @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a projector onto a space spanned by @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and @xmath15 and @xmath16 are energies of @xmath11 and @xmath12 . due to the scale invariance emerging at quantum criticality",

    ", we may analyze a quantum phase transition .",
    "however , this real - space rg approach generally does not give precise estimate of critical exponents .",
    "for instance , when applied to the quantum ising model in one dimension , estimations deviate from the correct values by around 20 percent even when more than ten spins are grouped into a block spin , and estimations do not converge to exact values even with the increasing block size  @xcite .",
    "the situation becomes even worse in higher dimensions where the renormalized hamiltonian @xmath17 often consists of unwanted terms that were not present in the original hamiltonian @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "these difficulties have severely limited the usage of real - space rg method in estimating critical exponents .",
    "recently , miyazaki _ et al _ proposed that , instead of including all the terms in @xmath18 , other choices of @xmath18 may give far better estimations of critical exponents  @xcite . in particular , they pointed out that , in the quantum ising model , there exist choices of @xmath18 whose estimation accuracy of correlation length exponent @xmath0 , defined as @xmath19 is @xmath20 percent , where @xmath21 is some order parameter . unfortunately , estimation of the magnetic exponent @xmath22 , defined as @xmath23 , is not precise . yet , since there are only two independent critical exponents under scaling relations , this result opens a possibility of developing a novel real - space rg scheme which is _ tailor - made _ to precisely ( or even analytically ) compute correlation length exponents .    in this paper",
    ", we develop a novel real - space rg scheme which is able to predict values of @xmath0 in higher - dimensional quantum ising and potts model .",
    "our scheme , when applied to the two - dimensional quantum ising model , gives an estimate consistent with the current best monte - carlo simulations which typically require @xmath24 cpu years  @xcite , estimates from @xmath3th - order high - temperature series expansions  @xcite , @xmath4-theory with seven loop corrections with highly intricate resummation schemes  @xcite and experiments performed in low - earth orbits where gravity - induced variations are small  @xcite . for details of previous estimates , we refer the reader to  @xcite and references therein .",
    "we also apply this method to higher - dimensional quantum potts model where monte - carlo method does not work efficiently due to weak first - order phase transition  @xcite .",
    "we begin with real - space rg analysis of one - dimensional quantum ising model in a transverse field : @xmath25 where @xmath26 . a traditional approach is to include all the terms inside a block in the inner hamiltonian @xmath18 .",
    "when a block consists of two spins , one has @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 act on @xmath30th spin in a block ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "it is well known that the above approach does not give precise estimate of critical exponents , and is only able to predict the presence of quantum phase transition .    instead , miyazaki _ et al",
    "_  @xcite , based on a pioneering result by fernandez - pacheco  @xcite , has suggested that a different choice of @xmath18 may significantly improve the precision : by removing one of the on - site @xmath32 terms , namely @xmath33 after the renormalization step , the ferromagnetic coupling and on - site transverse field rescale as follows : @xmath34 by projecting @xmath10 into low energy subspace of @xmath18 .",
    "this allows us to compute the correlation length exponent @xmath0 as follows @xmath35 where @xmath36 the base of the logarithm is two since we rescaled the system by the factor of two .",
    "surprisingly , the above rg equation , applied to eq .",
    "( [ eq : ising ] ) , gives @xmath37 , which is _ precisely equal _ to the exact solution .",
    "however , at this moment , it is unclear why the above rg scheme works well .",

    "are there any conditions on choices of @xmath18 under which the rg scheme works well ?",
    "is the method applicable to other models of quantum phase transition ?",
    "what is the reason behind the success of the above rg scheme ?",
    "below we address these questions .    via throughout investigations of various @xmath18 in one dimensions , we found that the most important condition in choosing @xmath18 is to guarantee that it has degenerate ground states and respects @xmath38 symmetry . in the rg scheme by miyazaki _",

[ fig_1dlist ] where crosses represent on - site @xmath32 terms and solid lines represent ferromagnetic @xmath53 terms .",
    "for all the choices depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig_1dlist ] , we found @xmath54 by numerically evaluating rg equations .",
    "we expect that @xmath37 precisely on these rg equations though we do not have analytical proof on this observation .",
    "thus , @xmath38 symmetry of the inner hamiltonian @xmath18 seems to be the crucial condition for successful rg schemes .     from real - space rg with degenerate @xmath18 for the quantum ising and @xmath55-state potts models .",
    "the figure shows the choices of @xmath18 where crosses represent @xmath32 terms and solid lines represent @xmath53 terms . in these examples ,",
    "all the ferromagnetic terms inside a block are included in @xmath18 . ]",
    "a naturally arising question concerns why degenerate @xmath18 is favorable in computing critical exponents .",
    "an important observation is that , under degenerate @xmath18 , the renormalized hamiltonian @xmath17 always has a closed form with terms proportional to either ferromagnetic @xmath53 or on - site magnetic field @xmath32 , up to some additive constant corrections .",
    "this statement can be rigorously proven for the quantum ising and potts model on an arbitrary lattice by using algebraic properties of pauli operators .",
    "for simplicity of discussion , we demonstrate that the rg scheme , considered by miyazaki _",
    "et al _ , generates no extra term .",
    "let @xmath14 be a projector onto two degenerate ground states of @xmath56 .",
    "the action of pauli operator @xmath57 inside the ground state space is @xmath58 so , @xmath59 .",
    "similar reasoning leads to @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "therefore , the renormalized hamiltonian has a closed form",
    ". this analysis can be straightforwardly generalized to arbitrary @xmath18 with @xmath38 symmetry , leading to a closed form of @xmath17 .    next ,",
    "in order to check the universality of the method , we study the quantum @xmath55-state potts model : @xmath62 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are generalized pauli operators defined for three - dimensional spins . by applying real - space rg with @xmath63",

    ", we also analyze the quantum potts model via other choices of degenerate @xmath18 with @xmath69 symmetries .",
    "the results are listed in fig .",
    "[ fig_1dlist ] which agree well with the exact value .",
    "yet , there are a few important distinctions .",
    "first , increasing the block size does not improve the estimation in general .",
    "second , removing the @xmath32 term at the boundary gives better estimates .",
    "we will return to these two observations by analyzing two - dimensional real - space rg schemes .",
    "in one dimension , we have found that degenerate @xmath18 generally gives a precise estimate of @xmath0 since the renormalized hamiltonian remains closed for both quantum ising and potts models . here",
    ", we proceed to develop higher - dimensional real - space rg schemes for the quantum ising and potts models .",
    "an immediate challenge in two dimensions is that the renormalized hamiltonian becomes anisotropic since the inner hamiltonian @xmath18 is not isotropic in general . to be specific ,",
    "let us consider two - dimensional quantum ising model defined on a triangular lattice .",
    "we think of covering the entire system by blocks of three spins , and choosing @xmath18 as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig_triangular](a)(b ) : @xmath72 note that @xmath18 has @xmath38 symmetry with @xmath73 by projecting @xmath10 onto the ground space of @xmath18 , we obtain coupling terms which bridge neighboring blocks ( renormalized spins ) .",
    "note there are six bonds outgoing from a single renormalized spin and two types of coupling strengths @xmath74 and @xmath75 @xmath76 as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig_triangular](b ) . therefore ,",
    "rg equations become highly anisotropic .    .",
    "( c ) renormalized coupling strengths . ]        in the case of anisotropic coupling strengths @xmath77 , the standard approach @xcite is to linearize the renormalization group transformation , find its eigenvalues and keep only the biggest one .",
    "this procedure is not fully justified since by discarding the other eigenvalue we lose some information how the system rescales . in what follows , we propose that the renormalized coupling strength should be a geometric mean of all coupling strengths .",
    "for the considered example of a triangular lattice we have @xmath78 we then obtain an rg equation @xmath79 which has a non - trivial fixed point .",
    "we obtain the critical exponent to be @xmath80 which is within a statistical error of the current best monte - carlo estimation , the @xmath4-theory estimation , the high - temperature series expansion and experiments . therefore , real - space rg is able to predict @xmath0 with surprisingly good precision in two dimensions , too .",
    "we shall call this real - space rg scheme the .    in order to understand why the canonical method works well ,",
    "we have investigated a number of other choices of inner hamiltonian @xmath18 for various lattices .",
    "we find a few important conditions under which real - space rg works well .",
    "one condition is to choose @xmath18 so that @xmath17 is less anisotropic .",
    "we show results of real - space rg with anisotropic coupling strengths in fig .",
    "[ fig_misc](a)(b)(c)(d ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig_misc](a ) , three types of coupling strengths are generated after renormalization . in fig .",
    "[ fig_misc](b)(c)(d ) , the number of bonds bridging the triangular blocks vary in different directions , and the renormalized coupling strengths are highly anisotropic . as expected , estimates from these rg schemes are not close to an actual value .",
    "another important condition is to avoid making `` loops '' of ferromagnetic interactions inside a block as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig_misc](e)(f)(g ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig_misc](e ) , all three ferromagnetic terms are included in @xmath18 which form a loop .",
    "similarly , in fig .  [ fig_misc](f ) , a loop is formed inside a square block .",
    "the inner hamiltonian @xmath18 can be made fully isotropic by removing the on - site term @xmath32 only at the center , as in fig .",
    "[ fig_misc](g ) , but ferromagnetic terms form multiple loops",
    ". since we are interested in how correlations grow over the whole lattice , it seems legitimate to avoid loops which would suppress propagations of correlations .",
    "estimates from rg schemes with loops are not close to an actual value . also ,",
    "a choice in fig .  [ fig_misc](g ) seems not optimal due to observations obtained from analysis of one - dimensional potts model since it groups a large number of spins and removes the @xmath32 term at the center instead of at the boundary . finally , fig .",
    "[ fig_misc](h ) covers the lattice in a skewed way while the renormalized coupling strengths remain isotropic .",
    "again , the estimate is not close to an actual value .",
    "therefore , it seems to us that the canonical scheme is the only sensible choice one could consider for precise estimation of @xmath0 .",
    "having developed two - dimensional real - space rg scheme , let us consider an application to the quantum potts model .",
    "in one dimension , we have seen that real - space rg is able to predict @xmath0 for the potts model with good accuracy . in two spatial dimensions ,",
    "the quantum potts model is known to undergo first - order phase transition  @xcite , and is not at a true quantum criticality as the scaling relations are not satisfied . yet , the transition has some reminiscent of quantum fluctuations where correlation length diverges at the critical point and critical exponents can be defined . however , for these _ weak _ first - order phase transitions , finding critical exponents is a problem of tremendous computational difficulty with no established method since standard monte - carlo method does not work effectively due to strong hysteresis and suppression of quantum fluctuations .    here",
    ", we obtain an estimate of correlation length exponent of the two - dimensional quantum potts model via the canonical method .",
    "a similar analysis , involving the geometric mean , leads to @xmath81 the current known estimate from monte - carlo simulation is @xmath82  @xcite which has a large uncertainty due to the difficulties mentioned above .",
    "it may be interesting to check our prediction with a large - scale numerical simulations .",
    "one may naturally hope to develop three - dimensional real - space rg by considering a tetrahedral lattice with blocks of four spins ( fig .  [ fig_cube](a ) ) .",
    "however , there seems to be no simple scale - invariant covering of the tetrahedral lattice in general .",
    "therefore , one needs to break translation symmetry or isotropy of the lattice for successful renormalization , which might lead to imprecise estimates of @xmath0 .",
    "one might also think of the pyrochlore lattice , but the number of nearest neighbors changes after renormalization . finally , one may consider a renormalization of a cubic lattice as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig_cube](b ) . by using the geometric mean of coupling strengths",
    ", we obtain @xmath83 which is not far from the value @xmath84 predicted by the mean - field theory .",
    "however , the estimate is not as successful as in two dimensions .        here",
    ", we consider a hybrid of lower - dimensional renormalization procedures to form effectively isotropic three - dimensional renormalization scheme , based on an idea by miyazaki _",
    "et al _  @xcite . in order to gain some insight into the method ,",

    "after one iteration of steps 1 - 2 , the system is rescaled by a factor of @xmath86 .",
    "we then solve an rg equation for the geometric mean of coupling strengths .",
    "an estimate for the two - dimensional quantum ising model is @xmath89 which is in good agreement with numerical estimates .",

    ", we obtain @xmath91 which is consistent with @xmath84 predicted by the mean - field theory . in three dimension ,",
    "it is better to group spins in blocks of two .",
    "the precision of estimating @xmath0 in two and three dimensions is comparable .    in order to further increase the precision of estimates , we consider a hybrid of two - dimensional and one - dimensional renormalization procedures .",
    "consider layers of triangular lattices piled on top of each other , filling the three - dimensional space , as in fig .",

    "an estimate for the three - dimensional quantum ising model is @xmath94 which is close to @xmath84 predicted by the mean - field theory .",
    "finally , we apply the same rg scheme to the quantum potts model : @xmath95 we were not able to find any previous work which numerically estimates this quantity .",
