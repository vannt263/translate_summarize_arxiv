    "the study of li in open clusters provides invaluable information about physical processes occurring in the interiors of stars .",
    "this is because , inside stars , at t @xmath4 2.5 million k both stable li isotopes are destroyed by ( p,@xmath5 ) reactions ( burbidge et  al .",
    "1957 ; bodenheimer 1965 ) , and thus li survives only in the outermost layers of stars . the surface li abundance traces the actions of the surface convection zone ( scz ) and other mixing processes that can bring li - depleted material to the surface .",
    "analysis of li in open clusters provides information for a broad range of stellar masses at ages that can be precisely determined , giving both the mass dependence and timing of li - altering processes .",
    "observations of open cluster dwarfs that span a broad range of age and metallicity have shown that surface li abundances are depleted in most , if not nearly all , stars ( e.g. , deliyannis 2000 ; jeffries 2000 ; sestito & randich 2005 ) .",
    "`` standard '' stellar evolution theory ( no rotation , no mass loss , no magnetic fields , and no diffusion ) predicts that surface li depletion begins during the pre - main sequence ( pms ) phase when the scz is very deep , allowing surface li to travel deep into the interior where it can be destroyed ( proffitt & michaud 1989 ; deliyannis et  al .",
    "1990 , hereafter ddk ; pinsonneault 1997 , hereafter p97 ) .",
    "the degree of surface li depletion during the pms depends on stellar mass and metallicity ( ddk ; p97 ; deliyannis & demarque 1991 ) . regarding the dependence on mass : population i pms stars that will become a and f dwarfs ( @xmath6 1.3 m@xmath7 ) remain in the pms phase relatively briefly , and the base of the scz just barely achieves a high enough temperature to destroy li ,",
    "so only a negligible amount of surface li depletion occurs before they reach the main sequence ( ms ) .",
    "lower - mass stars remain in the pms phase longer and have a higher temperature ( and density ) at the base of their deeper sczs , so they deplete a greater amount of surface li .",
    "the sczs are shallower during the ms , so no further li destruction occurs , except for ( possibly very late g ) , k , and m dwarfs , whose sczs remain deep with hot bases .",
    "standard theory also predicts that li depletion has a strong dependence on metallicity , where the more - metal - rich stars deplete surface li more rapidly .",
    "this is because a higher metallicity causes a higher opacity , which in turn causes a deeper scz .    a broad range of open cluster observations ,",
    "however , show that in most clusters standard theory predicts insufficient li depletion at a majority of , if not all , observed stellar temperature ranges ( see the review in p97 ) . especially surprising are the strikingly severe li depletions ( up to at least @xmath02 dex ) observed in mid - f cluster dwarfs ( the  li dip \" or `` li gap '' ) , which are expected to have _",
    "negligible _ standard pms li depletion .",
    "this li gap was first discovered in the @xmath0650 myr - old hyades ( boesgaard & tripicco 1986 ) , followed by its discovery ( hobbs & pilachowski 1986 ) in the older ngc 752 ( 1.45@xmath80.1 gyr ; anthony - twarog et  al .",
    "2009 ) and in the hyades - aged praesepe ( soderblom et  al .",
    "the absence or near - absence of a li gap in the @xmath0100 myr - old solar metallicity pleiades showed that the li gap forms during the ms ( boesgaard , budge , & ramsay 1988 ) , perhaps starting as early as an age of @xmath0150 myr based on li data in m35 ( steinhauer & deliyannis 2004 ) .",
    "just cooler than the li gap and leading into late f / early g dwarfs , the observed cluster a(li ) rise and form a short plateau before declining again in later g and k dwarfs .",
    "the second major departure from standard theory is the magnitude of observed li depletion in g ( and k ) dwarfs , which is also closely related to the 50-year old `` solar li problem '' .",
    "standard solar models predict a depletion factor of @xmath03 ( e.g. , p97 ) , whereas the sun s actual depletion is @xmath0150 ( e.g. , king et  al .",
    "1997 ) , assuming the meteoritic a(li ) = 3.31 @xmath8 0.04 ( anders & grevesse 1989 ) as the initial solar value .",
    "similarly , g and k dwarfs in virtually all observed clusters older than the pleiades have depleted far more li than standard theory predicts .",
    "once again , the young pleiades ( soderblom et  al .",
    "1993b ) helped identify this extra li depletion ( compared to the standard model s factor of @xmath03 ) as primarily a ms phenomenon because , a ) 1 m@xmath7 dwarfs in the pleiades have indeed depleted their li by only a factor of @xmath03 and b ) the mean li - t@xmath1 trend for g and k dwarfs in the young pleiades shows general agreement with the standard models of p97 .",
    "the standard model , however , remains incomplete even at the young age of the pleiades and _ can not _ produce the intrinsic scatter of @xmath01 dex observed around its mean a(li ) trend",
    ". therefore , there are both pms ( li scatter ) and ms ( continued li depletion ) effects that must be explained by non - standard mechanisms . in principle",
    ", the same mechanism could explain both effects , but more than one mechanism might be at work .",
    "just hotter than the li gap and leading into early f / late a dwarfs , the observed cluster a(li ) rise to levels near @xmath03 dex .",
    "standard theory predicts no li depletion in these and hotter dwarfs .",
    "indeed , a number of such dwarfs exhibit a(li ) near 3.0 - 3.3 dex , but others have suffered moderate to severe li depletion ( hyades : burkhart & coupry 1989 ; ngc 3680 : pasquini , randich , s. & pallavicini 2001 ; anthony - twarog et  al .  2009 ; ngc 752 : hobbs & pilachowski 1986 ; pilachowski & hobbs 1988 ; sestito et  al .  2004 ;",
    "ic 4651 : pasquini et  al .  2004 ;",
    "balachandran et  al .",
    "also , one star in the hyades - aged cluster ngc 6633 is super - li - rich with a(li)=4.3 , suggesting the possible existence of a `` li peak '' in stars just hotter than the li gap that is caused by diffusion ( deliyannis , steinhauer , & jeffries 2002 ) . diffusion may also explain the observed low c , high fe , and even higher ni . however , other elemental abundances ( e.g. , al , s , and ca ) are better explained by accretion of circumstellar material ( laws & gonzalez 2003 ) ; perhaps both diffusion and accretion are needed to explain this star ( ashwell et  al .",
    "2005 ) .    using more up to date standard physics , somers & pinsonneault ( 2014 , hereafter sp14 ) have conducted a thorough investigation of how uncertainties in the standard physics affects li depletion in the standard model .",
    "this provides a key reference to define these additional li depletion patterns .",
    "sp14 find that the very high temperature sensitivity of li depletion leads to important uncertainties in predicted standard depletion , including its metallicity dependence .",
    "the dominating uncertainties result from the adopted equation of state and the adopted solar composition . to help overcome these , sp14 empirically calibrated their standard model to the li depletion observed in the pleiades from 5500 to 6100 k. the sp14 models are slightly more depleted than the p97 models ( neither set have overshoot ) and are more comparable to the standard models from c95a that have an overshoot of 0.05 pressure scale heights below the convection zone .",
    "regardless , while important uncertainties remain in the standard model s input physics , the loose agreement between the pleiades s mean li trend and standard theory suggests that , at least for solar - metallicity stars , the standard theory provides a sound foundation for building our understanding pms li depletion .",
    "the critical remaining challenges are to understand what non - standard physical mechanisms can explain ms li depletion in both g and f dwarfs and the significant li scatter at constant t@xmath1 observed in most open clusters .",
    "one of the first non - standard mechanisms proposed to explain the hyades a(li ) trend ( and also the solar li ) involved mass loss occurring during the ms ( hobbs et  al .  1989 ) , but swenson & faulkner ( 1992 ) argued that this led to various absurdities ( e.g. , that the full mass range of current hyades g dwarfs were formed with essentially the same mass but then experienced a factor of @xmath05 variation in mass - loss rate ) . other approaches to solving the g dwarf and solar li problems involve slow mixing induced by rotation ( endal & sofia 1976 ; 1978 ; 1981 ; pinsonneault et  al .",
    "1989 ) or gravity waves ( garcia lopez & spruit 1991 ) .",
    "the rotational models ( collectively referred to as the `` yale '' rotational models ) consider a variety of ( but not complete list of ) instabilities related to rotation .",
    "stellar models lose angular momentum from the surface due to interactions of their magnetic field with their stellar wind ; these models have been calibrated to match the observed spin - down of stars .",
    "a star s outer layers thus slow down , leading to secular - shear instabilities ( zahn 1987 ) that are relieved by transfer of angular momentum , the act of which is presumed to cause some local mixing .",
    "this approach solves the solar li problem by definition , as the efficiency of rotationally - induced mixing is calibrated to match the solar li depletion .",
    "the timescales for models with rotationally - induced mixing find that it will not yet play a significant role in young clusters like the pleiades , but in intermediate - aged clusters ( e.g. , the hyades ) and older it becomes very important ( see c95a ) .",
    "another effect of rotation is that faster - rotating stars lose more angular momentum and they lose it more efficiently , which should accordingly induce greater internal mixing and li depletion .",
    "therefore , in intermediate - aged and older clusters this can also create scatter in a(li ) at a given t@xmath1 .",
    "this class of models has enjoyed a variety of successes ( see especially the li - gap discussion , below ) .",
    "a particularly encouraging success is the ability of these models to lose the vast majority of their initial angular momentum ( to match rotation rates of young stars as compared to old halo dwarfs at the turnoff ) and thus rotate slowly at the turnoff , but yet retain enough interior angular momentum to explain the rapidly rotating blue horizontal branch stars ( pinsonneault et  al .",
    "evidence that this type of mixing actually depletes li in g dwarfs comes from short period tidally locked binaries ( sptlbs ) . according to tidal circularization theory ( zahn & bouchet 1989 ) ,",
    "stars observed today with sufficiently short periods would have become tidally locked during the early pms , before their interiors were hot enough to destroy li ; such stars should thus have higher a(li ) than normal single stars .",
    "such high - li stars have indeed been observed in open clusters ( hyades : soderblom et  al .",
    "1990 ; thorburn et  al .",
    "1993 ; m67 : deliyannis et  al .",
    "1994 ) and other contexts ( ryan & deliyannis 1995 ) . however , these models ( and their improved successors , that also include the interaction of rotationally - induced mixing and microscopic diffusion , chaboyer et  al .  1995a , 1995b ) might not deplete enough g - dwarf li at later ages , and they may produce too much scatter in older clusters and little to none of the observed scatter in the young pleiades .",
    "( the pleiades scatter is notable because the faster rotators are less depleted rather than more , the reverse of that predicted by rotationally - induced mixing if it began to play a role at such a young age . )",
    "it is also possible that wave - induced mixing plays an important role , particularly at later stages , and that all three mechanisms must be considered together ( talon & charbonnel 2005 ) .",
    "another idea is that a different prescription for the internal angular momentum transport may be more realistic ; the g dwarf models of somers & pinsonneault ( 2016 ) may provide both more realistic internal rotation curves and surface li abundances .    looking directly at the problem of large a(li )",
    "scatter observed in young cluster g dwarfs , most notably in the pleiades , somers & pinsonneault ( 2015 ) provide new rotation models that consider the effects of rotation and inflated stellar radius on pms li depletion .",
    "somers & pinsonneault ( 2015 ) proposed and somers & stassun ( 2016 ) observed a correlation between rotation and radius inflation , where faster rotation leads to greater magnetically - driven radius inflation .",
    "this can recreate the observed pleiades scatter where at a given t@xmath1 faster rotators are the least depleted in li and the slowest rotators are are @xmath01 dex more depleted .",
    "these slow rotators fall on the lower envelope of the pleiades a(li ) scatter , in agreement with the standard model proposed in sp14 ( i.e. , zero rotation ) . applying this to older clusters",
    ", this may effectively counterbalance the subsequent effects of rotationally - induced mixing and angular momentum loss during the ms ( as discussed above ) and explain why hyades - aged g dwarfs with likely a distribution of different rotational histories exhibit relatively little scatter in a(li ) compared to _ both _ younger and older clusters .",
    "discovery of the li gap in f dwarfs blatantly contradicted standard theory and resulted in a proliferation of candidate non - standard mechanisms that could create such a li gap .",
    "these fall into three categories : mass loss ( schramm et  al .",
    "1990 ) , microscopic diffusion ( michaud 1986 ; richer & michaud 1993 ) , and slow mixing induced by various rotation - related mechanisms .",
    "boesgaard s ( 1987 ) discovery of a li-_v sin i _ anticorrelation in cooler hyades",
    "gap stars provided a connection to rotation .",
    "the yale rotational models also predict the li gap in terms of increasing initial angular momentum for more massive stars , followed by decreasing rates of angular momentum loss due to the vanishingly small scz .",
    "beryllium and boron , which survive to increasingly deeper depths than does li , when considered with li provide critically important diagnostics that identify the responsible mechanisms and potentially constrain the relative contribution of each .",
    "a considerably varied body of evidence favors the yale rotational models as the dominant li gap - causing mechanism , and argues against mass loss and diffusion ( though diffusion can still play a role , particularly at later stages ) .",
    "this evidence includes a ) the early formation of the li gap ( steinhauer & deliyannis 2004 ) , b ) the prototypical li / be pattern in 110 her ( deliyannis & pinsonneault 1997 ) and the strikingly more general li / be depletion correlation in f dwarfs ( deliyannis et  al .",
    "1998 ; boesgaard et  al .",
    "2001 ; boesgaard et  al .",
    "2004 ) , c ) the be / b depletion correlation in f dwarfs ( boesgaard et  al .  2005 ) , and d ) subgiants in the solar - aged m67 evolving out of the li gap , whose deepening scz reveal the profile of the li preservation region , and thus the mechanism(s ) responsible for its creation .",
    "( for a more detailed discussion , see section 5.1 of anthony - twarog et  al .  2009 . )",
    "related to the issues discussed here is that stars in between the li gap and the ( mid- ) g ( and k ) dwarf li depletions , exhibit the `` open cluster li plateau '' .",
    "evidence that this plateau is depleted by at least a factor of 2 to 3 from some higher initial value comes from sptlbs in the hyades and the much older ( solar - aged ) m67 ( thorburn et  al .  1993 ; deliyannis et  al .",
    "studies of the open cluster li plateau could conceivably provide insight into the halo li plateau , interpretation of which remains critically important to the testing of big bang theory . if big bang li is to be consistent with planck data ( coc et  al .",
    "2014 ) , the halo li plateau must be depleted by a factor of @xmath03 .",
    "conversely , if the halo li plateau were shown _ not _ to be depleted , there could be serious problems with the standard big bang model .",
    "a critical component to making further progress is to separate out effects predicted successfully by standard theory from those that need to be explained by non - standard mechanisms . as discussed , we will adopt that the standard theory can explain the general li - t@xmath1 relation of the pleiades , but it clearly fails to account for the scatter in li around this relation and the subsequent li depletion in f , g , and k dwarfs observed in older clusters .",
    "but what about the other major prediction from standard theory , that li depletion depends on metallicity ?",
    "the p97 and sp14 models predict that the g- and k - dwarf li - t@xmath1 trends depend quite sensitively on metallicity , even if differences in [ fe / h ] are as small as 0.1 - 0.15 dex , which is comparable to the metallicity difference between the hyades and the pleiades .",
    "some evidence that metallicity plays an important role comes from field dwarfs ( ramrez et  al .",
    "2012 ) , but these standard predictions have never been tested rigorously using open clusters ( see in sp14 a discussion of the limited and contradictory tests that have been done ) .",
    "unless we can establish how well standard theory predicts the metallicity dependence of li depletion , we will be hard pressed to quantify the degree of li depletion required of non - standard mechanisms , and it will be even more difficult to quantify any metallicity dependence that these mechanisms themselves might have .",
    "we thus embark on a program to determine empirically the metallicity dependence of li depletion in open cluster f , g and k dwarfs , which in turn can be used to test standard ( and non - standard ) models . since age is known to be an important li - depletion parameter , we have chosen to study the [ fe / h ] and a(li ) of five clusters with the _ same _ age , in particular , the age of the hyades ( @xmath0650 myr ) . to limit systematic effects",
    "we observe all of the clusters self - consistently using wiyn / hydra .",
    "we begin our program here by comparing the hyades to praesepe .",
    "the questions to be addressed include the following .",
    "is metallicity indeed an important parameter for li depletion in open clusters ?",
    "if yes , is there evidence for parameters other than age and metallicity affecting li depletion ? how well do the p97/sp14 models match any metallicity dependence we might find in the li depletion of g and k dwarfs ? in the f dwarfs is the li - t@xmath1 morphology of the hyades li gap typical",
    "? or equivalently  does the li - t@xmath1 morphology of the li gap vary from hyades - aged cluster to hyades - aged cluster , and if so , what parameters might be relevant ?",
    "do other hyades - aged clusters also show a li-_v sin i _ anticorrelation , and if yes , does it have a similar slope and zero point ?    in this first paper of our hyades - aged clusters program , we discuss our observations of the hyades and praesepe and our data - reduction methods in section 2 , our analysis of radial velocities , _ v sin i _ , and membership in section 3 , and our atmospheric models and determination of stellar parameters in section 4 .",
    "we discuss our fe abundances in section 5 , our a(li ) for the hyades and praesepe individually in section 6 where we also compare to and combine with previous studies of these clusters , and we directly compare our li results from both of these moderately metal - rich clusters in section 7 .",
    "lastly , results and conclusions are summarized in section 8 .",
    "the hyades and praesepe open star clusters were both observed using the hydra multi - object spectrograph on the wiyn 3.5-meter telescope using the 316@xmath963.4 echelle grating in order 8 with the x19 filter . the spectra span from 6450 to 6850  .",
    "all hyades stars and a majority of praesepe stars were observed with blue cable , which yielded r@xmath013,600 .",
    "the remaining praesepe stars were observed with the red cable , which yielded a moderately - higher r@xmath017,600 .",
    "these resolutions are based on our own arc - line fwhm measurements .",
    "the hyades observations were all performed using the sta1 detector , but we binned the spectra by two along the dispersion axis giving a dispersion of @xmath00.20 pixel@xmath10 .",
    "the praesepe observations were all performed using the t2ka detector , and without any binning this also gave a dispersion of @xmath00.20 pixel@xmath10 .",
    "most hyades targets ( 34 ) were selected from the final list of members from perryman et  al .",
    "( 1998 , hereafter p98 ) .",
    "p98 began with a preliminary list of members based on a number of proper motion ( pm ) studies , a large compilation of radial velocities , and their own hipparcos parallax data .",
    "detailed consideration of the space motions resulted in p98 s final membership list .",
    "we also chose 3 additional targets that do not appear in p98 , namely vb 49 , vb 59 , and vb 93 , which are all radial velocity cluster members from griffin et  al .",
    "the hyades sample thus comprises a total of 37 highly probable members , all of which also fall on the cluster s narrow ms . based on hipparcos data and a variety of previous studies , p98 list evidence of multiplicity in their table 2 .",
    "31 of our 37 stars are likely single stars as listed in p98 , while the remaining six are confirmed binaries .",
    "the hyades is very nearby ( 45 pc ) with members loosely spread across a large area of the sky ; therefore , these 37 hyades stars had to be observed individually on a single hydra fiber placed in the center of the field .",
    "the hyades data were acquired over seven nights from february 2 to 23 , 2009 .",
    "the total exposures for each target are given in column 11 of table 6 .",
    "for praesepe , the coordinates and pm analysis of wang et  al .",
    "( 1995 ) were used to calculate the current epoch coordinates .",
    "pm membership probabilities and consistency with the photometric single - star main sequence were used to select likely single - star dwarf members .",
    "all stars are highly probable pm members of praesepe : 69 of them have p@xmath11=1.00 , five have p@xmath11=0.99 , two have p@xmath11=0.98 ; the remaining two have 0.89 and 0.82 .",
    "praesepe is a moderately nearby cluster ( 187 pc ) that spans a significantly larger area than the degree field of view of hydra , so multiple hydra positions and fiber configurations were necessary to broadly analyze the cluster members .",
    "furthermore , to minimize potentially adverse effects of scattered light on the fainter stars , we limited each hydra configuration to a range of less than three to four magnitudes .",
    "this required multiple configurations to cover our full target range in v magnitude from 8 to 13.4 .",
    "using two red - cable configurations , we obtained spectra of 34 candidate cluster members on november 16 and 18 , 1997 . using seven blue cable configurations , we obtained spectra of 66 candidate cluster members during seven nights on december 2 , 2001 ; may 1 and 2 , 2005 ; january 25 and 26 , 2006 ; and february 2 and 3 , 2006 .",
    "most stars were observed in more than one configuration , giving a wide range of exposure times across our sample .",
    "see column 11 in table 7 for the total exposure times for each star .",
    "the difference in characteristics between red cable and blue cable are moderate , with small variations in throughput and the moderate difference in resolutions given above .",
    "for all observations , the comparison lamp spectra were taken in the same configuration as the object data , at least one ( if not all ) dome flats were taken in configuration , and daytime sky spectra were taken in - configuration when possible .",
    "in those few instances when it was not possible to take calibrations in - configuration , the circle configuration was used .",
    "taking calibrations in configuration is ideal because it provides consistent fiber throughputs , which can change due to altering a fiber s position or magnitude of curvature .",
    "this is most important when calibrating the throughput of fibers used to determine the sky subtraction ; however , all our targets are very bright in this study and the subtracted sky background was very minor .",
    "several praesepe stars were observed in both red and blue cable on hydra . instead of co - adding the spectra with slightly differing characteristics , we independently determined the abundances from both observations .",
    "the final stellar abundances are based on a weighted linear - average of the two independent sets of line measurements .",
    "the weighting is based on the relation from cayrel ( 1988 ) , as recast in deliyannis et  al .",
    "( 1993 , hereafter the d93 1@xmath12 relation ) , which determines an equivalent - width error based on the spectra s signal - to - noise per pixel ( hereafter s / n ) , dispersion , and line broadening .    here the steps to create our final spectra are briefly covered , but a more detailed overview is given in anthony - twarog et  al .",
    "( 2010 ) and cummings et  al .",
    "we processed our images using the standard iraf steps , followed by tracing the apertures , removing cosmic rays with l.a .",
    "cosmic ( van dokkum 2001 ) , and extracting the spectra .",
    "for the nine praesepe configurations , comparison spectra were taken using the thar lamps in eight configurations and the cuar lamps in one configuration , both of which provide a rich series of lines in the li spectral region for wavelength calibrating our spectra . unlike the data discussed in cummings et  al .",
    "( 2012 ) , which were observed with the ctio 4-m using hydra ii , wiyn / hydra observations do not use etalons and only use comparison lamp spectra .",
    "praesepe is bright and required only relatively brief ( one to two hours ) observations each night , but to take into account possible shifts with time , a comparison spectrum was observed in configuration immediately before and after the cluster observations . before and after each set of hyades - dwarf observations , the thar lamps were similarly observed with the central fiber .",
    "the hyades stars are very bright ( 5.7@xmath13v@xmath139.4 ) and the observations were typically only several minutes , so the sky was not subtracted for the hyades .",
    "praesepe stars are not quite as bright ( 8@xmath13v@xmath1313.4 ) so sky subtraction was performed . in each praesepe configuration , due to the low sky density of stars",
    ", there were enough available fibers to place 30 to 40 sky fibers at random positions across the field . to create a uniform sky level in all fibers before it is subtracted from the objects ,",
    "fiber throughput corrections were applied , which were created using the high - s / n afternoon - sky spectra .",
    "we then applied a doppler correction to each object image based on the earth s orbital velocity , which provided a uniform radial - velocity zero point for all stellar spectra and allowed for precise radial - velocity measurements .",
    "lastly , the individual object spectra were all co - added and continuum - fitted to produce our final spectra .",
    "in this study our targets are all highly probable cluster members , based on a variety of criteria for the hyades , and based on pms and location on the color magnitude diagram single - star fiducial for praesepe ( section 2 ) . however , pm - based membership information is often not available for clusters that we will be reporting on in the future , including some hyades - aged clusters intended for the present series of studies . in such cases ,",
    "stellar targets can often be selected from the photometric single - star fiducial sequence , and membership can be refined to those stars that also have radial velocities consistent with single - star cluster membership .",
    "for the hyades and praesepe , the richness of material available affords us to include highly probable members ( as judged from pms , photometry , and overall kinematics ) that do not fall inside the single - star radial velocity peak .",
    "this allows us to check to see whether the a(li ) patterns of stars belonging strictly to those within the single - star radial velocity peak differ from those patterns derived when member stars from outside the single - star radial velocity peak are also included .",
    "such stars are often binary ( or multiple ) members , and the question then becomes , when can the flux contribution from the secondary be ignored , and when not ?    not surprisingly , previous studies ( e.g. , thorburn et  al .",
    "1993 ) have found that sb2s show a larger scatter in the hyades li - t@xmath1 relation , even after attempts have been made to correct for the flux contribution of the secondary ( see also boesgaard & tripicco 1986 ) . in part , this is because such flux corrections can be uncertain , but the temperature of the primary can also be uncertain ( see sections 4 , 6.1 ) .",
    "this , in turn , creates a corresponding uncertainty in the derived a(li ) , even if the flux correction factor were to be very accurate .",
    "therefore , we will not include sb2s when determining the li - t@xmath1 relation of any given cluster , though we will discuss certain sb2s such as short - period tidally locked binaries ( sptlbs ) that have special importance .",
    "the question then becomes , are the a(li ) from probable member sb1s sufficiently reliable so that we can include them in determining the li - t@xmath1 relation ? we will examine these issues in the sections that follow .",
    "the stellar radial velocities have been measured with the iraf task _ fxcor _ , which compares each spectrum to a radial velocity standard star s spectrum of a similar spectral type also observed with wiyn / hydra .",
    "stars observed with blue cable were only compared to radial velocity standards observed with the blue cable , and similarly objects observed with the red cable were compared to red - cable standards . while very high precision radial velocities are not needed for this work , minor ( @xmath140.5 km s@xmath10 ) systematics can be introduced from applying a standard observed in a central fibre to all fibres . for narrow lined spectra ( _ v sin i _",
    "@xmath14 30 km s@xmath10 ) , we used the spectral comparison range of 6600 to 6800  , which is broad but avoids h@xmath5 ( @xmath06563  ) and the complications that its inclusion would introduce . in increasingly broadened spectra ( _ v sin i _",
    "@xmath3 30 km s@xmath10 ) , the moderate - to - weak strength lines in this chosen spectral range become increasingly challenging for _ fxcor _ to match .",
    "therefore , in fast rotators a narrow region ( 10 to 15  ) centered on the strong h@xmath5 line was used as the comparison wavelength to determine radial velocities .",
    "the _ fxcor _ comparison of the two spectra creates an approximately gaussian cross - dispersion profile , which provides both the doppler shift of the star and for slower rotators ( _ v sin i _",
    "@xmath14 30 km s@xmath10 ) the width of the profile gives a direct measurement of the rotational broadening ( _ v sin i _ ) .",
    "the precision with which _ fxcor _ can fit the center of the profile provides our 1@xmath12 radial velocity errors .",
    "furthermore , a significantly asymmetric or double peaked cross - dispersion profile is strong evidence for binarity , where the gaussian profile for each star of the system is offset and superimposed .",
    "none of our hyades dwarfs and only two praesepe dwarfs ( kw 181 and kw 367 , clear sb2s ) show clear evidence for binarity based on this criterion . for faster rotators ( _ v sin i _",
    "@xmath3 30 km s@xmath10 ) , when only using h@xmath5 for the _ fxcor _ reference , we similarly derive reliable radial velocities , but we can not determine _ v sin i _ because the very strong h@xmath5 is also heavily broadened through other mechanisms . determining",
    "_ v sin i _ for fast rotators is very desirable because of the potential effects of varying rotation rates on a(li ) .",

    "our _ v sin i _ , radial velocities , and 1@xmath12 errors in the radial velocities are shown in columns 12 - 13 of tables 6 and 7 for the hyades and praesepe , respectively .",
    "single - star cluster members have similar radial velocities with only moderate dispersion , so we use the radial velocities of our pm and photometrically selected dwarfs to define a set of stars consistent with single - star membership",
    ". we will refer to these as `` radial - velocity members '' .",
    "the left panel of figure 1 shows that the hyades radial velocities produce a narrow gaussian distribution .",
    "we note that figure 1 includes known sb1s .",
    "this may increase the width slightly of the observed distribution , but this is appropriate for illustrating our methods , which in future publications will be applied to other clusters without previous published binary analyses .",
    "stars inside the vertical dashed lines are defined to be consistent with single - star membership ; this includes 33 of our 37 program stars .",
    "these 33 stars give a mean cluster radial velocity of 39.1 with a standard deviation of the mean ( hereafter @xmath15 ) of @xmath80.2 km s@xmath10 and a standard deviation ( @xmath12 ) of 1.3 km s@xmath10 , which is remarkably consistent with this sample s mean cluster radial velocity from p98 of 39.1@xmath80.3 km s@xmath10 ( @xmath15 ) , they also have a consistent radial velocity distribution width with ours .",
    "the four hyads with inconsistent radial velocities in comparison to the primary group are vb 2 , vb 4 , vb 38 , and vb 127 . since all four of these stars are well - established pm members , and since hyads have relatively large pms that easily separate them from the field , these discrepant velocities may be explained by binarity .",
    "for example , there is previous evidence that vb 2 and vb 38 are binaries ( see p98 and references therein ) .",
    "however , these four stars have no direct evidence of binarity from _ fxcor _ and are all photometrically consistent with the single - star sequence",
    ". therefore , any flux contributed to the spectrum by a possible companion is likely small and will not cause significant errors in the abundances that we derive for the primary . in the cases of vb 2 , vb 4 , and vb 127 the velocity discrepancy is less than 8 km s@xmath10 from the cluster mean .",
    "but in the case of vb 38 , its discrepancy is 25 km s@xmath10 .",
    "vb 38 is further singled out by being the only one of these four stars that has significant t@xmath1 dispersion ( see section 4 ) , which suggests the presence of a faint companion that we can not ignore or some other issue with the atmosphere that likely makes its derived abundance unreliable .",
    "therefore , we will continue to include vb 2 , vb 4 , and vb 127 in our final sample , but their slight radial velocity inconsistencies should be noted and in section 6.1.1 we will test their and vb 38 s a(li ) consistency with the hyades radial velocity members .",
    "the right panel of figure 1 shows that the praesepe radial velocities also produce a narrow gaussian distribution . in our praesepe sample of 78 stars ,",
    "67 are radial - velocity members ( defined as those stars within the dashed lines in figure 1 ) .",
    "these 67 stars give a mean cluster radial velocity of 34.7@xmath80.2 km s@xmath10 ( @xmath15 ) with a @xmath12 of 1.1 km s@xmath10 , which is remarkably consistent with the mean cluster radial velocity determined by mermilliod & mayor ( 1999 ) of 34.54@xmath80.12 km s@xmath10 ( @xmath15 ) .",

    "indeed , kw 181 and kw 367 have clear double - lined spectra .",
    "kw 416 and kw 434 have separate observations in the red and blue cable , with kw 416 showing a 6 km s@xmath10 difference in each epoch s radial velocity and kw 434 showing a 55 km s@xmath10 difference .",
    "another possible signature of binarity is a high t@xmath1 dispersion ( see section 4 ) , and nine of these radial - velocity discrepant stars have high dispersion .",
    "based on the binarity analysis of mermilliod et  al .",
    "( 2009 ) and patience et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) , roughly half of these radial velocity discrepant stars are known binaries ( kw 181 , kw 268 , kw 367 , kw 416 , and kw 434 ) . only kw 45 and kw 183 do not show any signatures of binarity in our observations or elsewhere beyond their disagreement with the cluster radial velocity .",
    "consistent with our procedures for the hyades , we present li results for all radial velocity discrepant stars that are not double - lined spectra , and in section 6.2.1 we test their a(li ) consistency with the praesepe radial velocity members .",
    "lastly , we include kw 45 and kw 183 in our final sample because of their small t@xmath1 dispersion .",
    "near the li i resonance line ( 6708  ) there are no measurable fe ii lines or fe i lines with a large enough variation in excitation potential to determine spectroscopically either t@xmath1 or log g. fortunately , both praesepe and the hyades are very well studied photometrically and have near - zero reddening ( see discussion below ) .",
    "therefore , fairly precise , accurate , and self - consistent temperatures can be derived photometrically with a color - temperature relation . for our praesepe photometry",
    "we used the ubv photometry of johnson ( 1952 , hereafter j52 ) and the ubvri photometry of mendoza ( 1967 , hereafter mend67 ) . to test for consistency",
    ", we compared 31 stars that span a broad range of v magnitude ( 6.78 to 11.99 ) and b - v color ( 0.22 to 0.82 ) from both j52 and mend67 .",
    "figure 2 shows this comparison and that the differences in b - v have no significant systematic offset or slope with magnitude .",
    "we combine these two independent photometric studies ( j52 and mend67 ) confident that we are not introducing any significant systematic effects .",
    "the eight faintest praesepe stars observed in our sample are beyond the j52 or mend67 magnitude limits .",
    "therefore , for seven of these fainter stars we used the bv photometry of upgren et  al .",
    "( 1979 , hereafter u79 ) and for the case of 624w we used the bv photometry of weis ( 1981 ) .",
    "u79 compared their data to those of j52 for the 36 stars common to both samples , and they found negligible offsets of -0.002@xmath80.004 in v and + 0.002@xmath80.004 in b - v .",
    "lastly , for our adopted hyades photometry we similarly combined the photometry of johnson & knuckles ( 1955 ) and mend67 .            to determine our photometrically based t@xmath1 , we took advantage of the fact that besides the eight faintest praesepe stars , all program stars have measurements in all five ubvri filters .",
    "we used all 10 color combinations of these filters , rather than the b - v color alone .",
    "this should result in a more precise t@xmath1 and perhaps smaller errors as well . to perform this multicolor analysis , for praesepe we began by cutting the full published photometric sample to a narrow ms fiducial of stars that have up to 10 ubvri - based colors .",
    "each of the nine non-(b - v ) colors were plotted against b - v , and a low - order fit ( typically 3rd order ) provided an _ empirical _ relation to convert each color to an effective b - v .",
    "this gives up to 10 effective b - v colors for each star , which have been averaged to give a final mean b - v for each praesepe dwarf .",
    "maderak et  al .",
    "( 2013 ) applied these same methods to the hyades photometry , and we adopt their mean hyades b - v colors .",
    "this method provides several advantages .",
    "a t@xmath1 derived from a single color may be affected by high surface activity or a binary companion of different color that contributes a significant fraction to the total combined flux .",
    "a cluster member s color can also be affected by a reddening deviant from the cluster mean or a poor measurement or large error in at least one filter magnitude . non - uniform reddening or photometric error are not a concern in either the hyades or praesepe , but can be in many other clusters that we will analyze in the future . in comparison ,",
    "multiple color analysis will also be affected by these concerns but non - uniformly , which can be used to identify stars with peculiar colors .",
    "therefore , our method identifies complications that even the most precise _ single _ color photometry could not detect .",
    "there are also several advantages to our method over direct application of these multiple colors to their own independent color - temperature relation from , for example , ramrez & melndez et  al .",
    "( 2005 ; which presents relations for only 4 of our 10 total colors ) .",
    "first , with most clusters a reddening is critical for deriving photometrically based t@xmath1 , and precise transformations between different reddening factors for each color would be necessary . with our method",
    "the _ empirical _ comparisons of the observed colors directly fits the relative effects of reddening between each color .",
    "second , because we work directly with the standardized colors to derive the color transformations independently for each cluster , this corrects for any potential systematic issues introduced in the analysis or observations between the multiple observed colors . because with our method we put everything into the b - v system , any systematics in the observed b - v color can cause systematic offsets in our final t@xmath1 , but photometric systematics in any color will not artificially increase the resulting dispersion in the 10 derived effective b - v values .",
    "lastly , similar systematics within the photometry used to derive these multiple color - temperature relations will not affect our results because we only need to adopt one single color - temperature relation .    to test the reliability of these final combined b - v",
    ", we calculated the standard deviation in t@xmath1 based on each of the 10 b - v colors ( see color - temperature relation discussion below ) .",
    "the @xmath2 of our spectroscopically observed hyades and praesepe sample ranges from only 6 k to nearly 400 k , with a typical @xmath2 of @xmath040 k. the derived a(li ) depend strongly on the assigned t@xmath1 ( roughly 0.1 dex per 100 k , depending on t@xmath1 ) .",
    "the very high precision of the hyades and praesepe photometry indicates that these large @xmath2 are not simply the result of photometric errors and are truly indicative of color peculiarities across some part of the full ubvri color spectrum .",
    "thus , stars with a standard deviation in t@xmath1 ( hereafter @xmath2 ) greater than 75 k were considered to be problematic and removed from our final sample . in praesepe , for example , 9 of the 11 stars not consistent with the cluster radial velocity have high @xmath2 , while conversely only 7 out of 59 of the stars that are both radial velocity and pm members with full photometric analysis have high @xmath2 .",
    "we note that for future analyses of any clusters with moderately variable reddening or higher photometric error our high @xmath2 definition of @xmath375 k will be appropriately adjusted .",
    "the a(li ) for these high @xmath2 stars in both the hyades and praesepe are still of interest , nonetheless , and they remain in tables 6 and 7 . similar to the stars with discrepant radial velocities , in section 6",
    "we will test if these high @xmath2 stars have distinct a(li ) .",
    "for the eight faintest praesepe stars we only adopted their b - v color from u79 and weis ( 1981 ) because the r and i photometry from both of these studies used different filter sets than mend67 , and our color transformations are not applicable . therefore , these eight stars similarly have larger uncertainty in their parameters , but they are so heavily depleted in li that only upper limits are presented in table 7 .      in figure 3",
    "we plot the color magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) of the hyades ( left panel ) and praesepe ( right panel ) to further analyze their photometric characteristics and to self - consistently fit isochronal ages . in the hyades , we plot the final averaged b - v colors versus absolute magnitude ( m@xmath16 ) based on their individual hipparcos distances ( van leeuwen 2007 ) .",
    "this is because variations in distance for individual hyades members are a large enough fraction of the hyades distance itself .",
    "therefore , apparent magnitude does not as accurately illustrate the relative luminosities .",

    "we have marked in red the members that have had their li analyzed in our wiyn / hydra data or in our supplemental data .",
    "we further differentiate these members as single stars with low @xmath2 ( solid red ) and high @xmath2 ( open red ) and binaries with low @xmath2 ( red plus ) and high @xmath2 ( circled red plus ) .",
    "as expected , we see that in the hyades the single stars with low @xmath2 create a reasonably tight ms fiducial",
    ". similarly , the binaries with low @xmath2 are consistent with this fiducial .",
    "this supports the idea that their secondary companions are not contributing significant light .",
    "in contrast to this , we see that the single stars with high @xmath2 and most clearly the binaries with high @xmath2 deviate significantly from the single star fiducial .",
    "the stars overlain with blue data points , which have had a uniform distance applied , appear photometrically consistent with their stellar types .",
    "we note that the hyades main sequence appears to be somewhat broad , and for our analyzed single and binary stars with low @xmath2 we find that they have a median absolute deviation from the isochrone of 0.135 magnitudes .",
    "we define stars with low @xmath2 that are more than three times this median absolute deviation from the isochrone as photometrically discrepant stars .",
    "the two binaries vb 102 and vb 114 , which have low @xmath2 , are discrepant and overlaid with a yellow data point to illustrate them clearly .    in the praesepe cmd",
    "we see consistent characteristics with a very tight fiducial of single stars and binaries with low @xmath2 , which gives a median absolute deviation from the isochrone of 0.097 magnitudes . for praesepe",
    "we find ten single and binary stars with low @xmath2 that meaningfully deviate from the fiducial ( kw 31 , kw 90 , kw 182 , kw 257 , kw 275 , kw 322 , kw 334 , kw 365 , kw 536 , and kw 540 ) .",
    "these photometrically discrepant stars are again overlaid with yellow data points .",
    "in contrast to the hyades , in praesepe there are several photometrically discrepant binaries that have low @xmath2 and are consistent with the plotted equal - mass binary sequence .",
    "binaries with two components of nearly equal mass will not have peculiar colors ( based on @xmath2 ) , but their high luminosities will be apparent in the cmd . in our li analysis of both the hyades and praesepe we will identify these low @xmath2 stars that are photometrically discrepant from the single star fiducial and test if they have distinct a(li ) .    before we can derive our t@xmath1 from a color - temperature relation and fit our isochrones in figure 3 , it is necessary to consider the cluster reddenings .",
    "( see taylor 2006 for a history of reddening determinations toward the hyades and praesepe . )",
    "while early work ( 1975 - 1981 ) on the hyades suggested a e(b - v ) of at most a few to several mmag , some studies of the 1980s and 1990s claimed e(b - v ) s as high as a few times 0.01 mag .",
    "based on polarization data , taylor ( 2006 ) finds e(b - v ) @xmath14 0.001 mag at the 95% confidence level ; this is a refinement of his earlier work where he found a limit of e(b - v)= 0.003 @xmath8 0.002 ( taylor 1980 ) .",
    "we have adopted e(b - v)=0.00 for the hyades . when applying no reddening to the hyades cmd we curiously found that the yi et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) isochrones with the derived metallicity of [ fe / h]=+0.146 ( deliyannis et  al .  in prep .",

    "applying this correction and focusing on matching the left - edge of the turnoff by - eye derives an isochronal age 635@xmath825 myr .",
    "many researchers have used the same reddening value for praesepe as for the hyades ( usually 0.00 ) on the basis that both clusters show similar trends in the ( u - b ) versus ( b - v ) plane ( e.g. , johnson & knuckles 1955 ) , though other arguments for identical reddenings have also appeared .",
    "there also exist at least several claims of small reddening values up to a few times 0.01 ( see summary in taylor 2006 ) .",

    "therefore , it is not a systematic in the photometry but may be a systematic in the distances , but it would have to be quite large to create this offset .",
    "it is not indicative of issues with our adopting hyades reddening because it would require a negative reddening ( e(b - v)@xmath0 - 0.01 ) .",
    "another possibility is that while the isochrones already match well with most of praesepe , if we adopt a solar z of 0.016 ( instead of the 0.018 adopted in yi et  al .",
    "2001 isochrones ) this corrects the systematic offset observed in the hyades and requires only a minor reddening of 0.01 ( including the corresponding [ fe / h ] shift ) in praesepe for its isochrone to identically match its main sequence .",

    "the [ fe / h ] error is given by the weighted standard deviation of the mean calculated in linear space .",

    "after all of the cuts discussed above , this result is based on 415 fe i line measurements from the spectra of 39 slowly - rotating ( _ _ v sin i__@xmath1425 km s@xmath10 ) praesepe members , where eight of these members had independent measurements of fe i lines from both the red and blue cable .    before continuing",
    ", we will discuss the various methods for determining a stellar average and a cluster average .",
    "the star average is more straightforward because the uncertainty that creates the abundance dispersion in [ fe / h ] is dominated by measurement errors in equivalent width due to spectral noise .",
    "when propagating this equivalent width error to an abundance error , the resulting abundance error is more symmetric in linear rather than log space .",
    "therefore , averaging the individual fe i line abundances from a single star in linear space to determine its  average \" abundance provides a better statistical representation of the mean than averaging in log space does .",
    "for a cluster average , equivalent width error is no longer the only factor because the error in each stellar t@xmath1 further increases abundance dispersion .",
    "errors in t@xmath1 propagate into abundance errors that are more symmetrically distributed in log rather than linear space .",
    "therefore , an argument can be made that a weighted logarithmic - average of the individual fe i line abundances would provide a better representation of the distribution and of the cluster s true [ fe / h ] .",
    "for the sake of comparison and completeness , we will present the result for praesepe from four different averaging methods . as discussed above , a weighted linear - average for praesepe",

    "as expected , the average in logarithmic space gives a lower abundance , but the difference is not meaningful .",

    "since there is a variation in abundance errors from the fe i line measurements and from stars with differing s / n , this method is not as robust , but we include it for comparison . for praesepe , the linear average with no weighting gives an [ fe / h ] of + 0.154@xmath80.004 ( @xmath15 ) + 0.061/-0.071 ( @xmath12 ) .",

    "table 3 lists these final praesepe cluster [ fe / h ] averages and errors using the four different methods discussed .",
    "a potentially larger systematic error is due to the possibility that praesepe has a non - zero reddening . in the extreme case of a e(b - v)=0.03 ,",
    "the t@xmath1 are increased ( for example , by 115 k near 6000 k and by 83 k near 5000 k ) , which for our sample increases the overall cluster [ fe / h ] by 0.057 dex to + 0.213 .",

    "it is clear that for these three stars the discrepancies between our [ fe / h ] and their [ fe / h ] can primarily be explained by the differences in the adopted stellar t@xmath1 .",

    "this creates a more realistic synthetic equivalent width , and we have created a series of cogs at differing metallicity to account for the increasing neighbor contribution ( besides that of the 6707.44  fe i line ) with increasing metallicity , which becomes important at the metallicity of the hyades and praesepe .    in figure 8 we plot @xmath24(equivalent width ) ( measured minus synthetically derived ) in m versus ( b - v)@xmath19 for our observations of both the hyades and praesepe . as with figures 5 and 6 , in the right panel for praesepe measurements",
    "we plot the blue cable observations in black and the red cable observations in red .",
    "some notable systematics are consistently observed in both clusters . in praesepe , at the bluest colors ( b - v @xmath13 0.4 ) there is a broad range of systematic differences ( @xmath00 to 25 m ) in equivalent widths , and this large scatter is a direct result of the large variation in _ v sin i _ in these hotter stars . as we discussed earlier , direct attempts at equivalent width measurements in fast rotators will not be able to deblend the series of neighboring lines contributing to the increasingly broad li feature .",
    "the smaller dispersion in the hyades ( left panel ) is due solely to the hyades having a smaller range of observed _ v sin i_. in stars of intermediate color ( 0.4 @xmath14 b - v @xmath14 0.7 ) the systematic differences are minor but still important , with both clusters illustrating that direct equivalent width measurements are @xmath02 to 3 m weaker . in the reddest stars ( b - v @xmath4 0.7 ) this systematic increases rapidly .",
    "these weaker equivalent widths are primarily due to the challenge of defining the continuum near the li region , in particular in metal - rich clusters , and as the neighboring line strengths increase in cooler stars this systematic difference increases .",
    "for both of these challenges , increases in spectral resolution will provide only marginal improvements ; spectral synthesis provides the most precise li abundances .",
    "the d93 relation again provided poisson - noise 1@xmath12 li equivalent width errors , which were translated to a(li ) errors using our cogs .",
    "these are shown in column 8 of tables 6 and 7 for the hyades and praesepe , respectively . additionally , the li line is sensitive to t@xmath1 ( but not log g or microturbulence ) .",
    "application of the @xmath2 ( from the 10 empirically derived colors ) to our cogs provided the t@xmath1-based error for a(li ) .",
    "these are shown in column 9 of tables 6 and 7 for the hyades and praesepe , respectively .",
    "these two errors added in quadrature give our final a(li ) errors .",
    "lastly , we note the possible systematic errors based on our choice of reddening . for the hyades , the upper limit in e(b ",
    "v ) of 0.001 has negligible effects in the derived t@xmath1 and a(li ) , and for praesepe , an upper limit in e(b ",
    "v ) of 0.03 would give relatively small increases in the derived a(li ) of 0.09 dex for our hottest stars and 0.14 dex for our coolest stars .",
    "several of our observed members of hyades and praesepe have undergone far too much li depletion to make a reliable detection at the 3@xmath12 level or greater . in these cases ,",
    "the d93 relation was used to calculate the 3@xmath12 equivalent width for each spectrum , and this was converted using our cogs to a 3@xmath12 based a(li ) upper limit . in most of our temperature range , the additional neighboring lines near the li line at 6707.8  have negligible strength ( e.g. , compared to the fe i feature at 6707.44  ) .",
    "however , at cooler t@xmath1 and in view of our clusters high ( super - solar ) metallicity , some of these neutral features begin to gain strength at the same time that the li line vanishes ( due to stellar li depletion ) .",
    "therefore , at cooler t@xmath1 each metallicity - dependent cog has a lower limit set by when the neighboring lines begin to dominate the li feature .",
    "( in this line comparison the moderately strong fe i line at 6707.44  is ignored . )",
    "if a star s 3@xmath12 equivalent width is below this lower limit of the cog , the lower limit is adopted as the a(li ) upper limit .",
    "a major goal in re - observing the hyades is to ensure that our wiyn / hydra a(li ) are on the same scale as those in previous studies of the hyades ( e.g. , boesgaard & tripicco 1986 , hereafter bt86 ; bb88 ; thorburn et  al .",
    "1993 , hereafter t93 ; takeda et  al .",
    "2013 , hereafter t13 ) .",
    "we will address this in section 6.1.2 , but first in section 6.1.1 we use our wiyn / hydra abundances to examine what criteria are required to best define the li - t@xmath1 trend .",
    "we take it as an axiom that highly probable single star members with small @xmath2 ( here , @xmath1475 k ) are ideal for this purpose .",
    "we will also examine whether high @xmath2 stars , known member sb1s , pm members that fall outside the radial velocity single - star peak , or members that photometrically deviate from the single star cluster fiducial might also be suitable .",
    "the left panel of figure 9 shows the a(li ) we derived for our wiyn / hydra sample for the hyades cluster , which we have found to be moderately metal - rich ( [ fe / h]=0.146@xmath80.004 ( @xmath15 ) ; deliyannis et  al .  in prep . ) .",
    "solid circles ( detections ) and solid inverted triangles ( upper limits ) are hyades pm members ( including both stars within and outside the radial velocity peak from 35 to 43 km s@xmath10 ) that have small @xmath2 ( @xmath14 75 k ) .",
    "open circles ( detections ) and open inverted triangles ( upper limits ) are members that have large @xmath2 . plus signs ( detections ) and plus signs with downward arrows ( upper limits ) are for stars identified by p98 as binaries that have small @xmath2 , but the addition of an open circle to a plus sign signifies that it has a large @xmath2 .",
    "lastly , our three observed radial velocity members that are not in p98 ( vb 49 , vb 59 , and vb 93 ) are treated as single stars because none show any evidence of binarity in the photometry or in our spectra ( from either _",
    "v@xmath25 _ or _ fxcor _ ) .    ) and at the rich metallicity of the hyades .",
    "we also note a few mismatches in the synthesis that likely can not be explained by noise and are discussed in more detail in the text . ]",
    "we see that there is a broad range of roughly 3 dex in a(li ) spanning over 2000 k in temperature .",
    "the well - known general features of the hyades li - t@xmath1 relation are evident : substantial a(li ) near 7000 k , a severe li depletion in mid - f dwarfs ( 6800 to 6300 k , known as the li  dip \" or  gap \" , among other terms found in the literature ) , higher a(li ) in the li plateau in late - f / early - g dwarfs ( near 6200 k ) , and the increasingly steep decline in li with lower t@xmath1 in g dwarfs until the li line becomes undetectable near 5000 k. these features have been observed repeatedly in the hyades ( e.g. , cayrel et  al .",
    "1984 ; t93 ) and in older open clusters ( for example , in ngc 752 : hobbs & pilachowski 1986 ; in ngc 3680 : anthony - twarog et  al .  2009 ; and the much older m67 : pasquini et  al .  2008 ; jones et  al .  1999 ) .",
    "we stress that the six li gap stars with t@xmath1 between 6400 and 6800 k show very clear depletion of li relative to the cooler li plateau and to the hotter star vb 14 .",
    "our low ( and unprecedented ) li detection in vb 90 in the middle of the li gap , which is a greater than 3@xmath12 detection with a(li)=1.70 , required extremely high s / n ( @xmath01500 ) to produce a reliable detection of the weak and rotationally broadened li line . in figure 9",
    "we illustrate vb 90 s li detection through synthesis .",
    "we show three syntheses : one with no li , a(li)=1.7 , and 2 dex , with 1.70 dex representing our by - eye fit .",
    "this shows the advantages of very high s / n but also the significant challenge of measuring such weak li in rapid rotators . in particular , the horizontal line shown at the top that represents the true synthetic continuum of the syntheses , which based on the observed spectrum ( that shown and in the surrounding region ) can not be reliably determined without a synthetic reference .",
    "we also note a few apparent mismatches in the spectrum , in particular the too strong synthetic feature near 6704.5  , the possibly too weak synthesis of the blend in the blue wing of the broadening li feature ( near 6707.0  ) , and the too weak synthesis of the weak features from 6710.5 to 6711.0  . most of these can not be explained by noise but may be the result of t@xmath1 errors , minor errors in our adopted linelist , or limitations of our scaled - solar abundance assumption .",
    "consistent synthetic analyses of our observations of vb 11 , vb 13 , and vb 37 at similar t@xmath1 but with weaker rotational broadening suggest that our synthesis of the blend blueward of li ( near 6707.0  , including the fe i 6707.45  feature ) is reliable , but the comparison is more limited by noise . in either case , for our syntheses of the typically much stronger li feature in our other stars , spectral noise will dominate these possible issues in our final errors but we acknowledge their importance in vb 90 .",
    "this detection , however , encourages re - observation of other li gap stars that have only upper limits in li using extremely high s / n . before delving into more detail about the features of the li morphology , we conduct a preliminary examination of what criteria stars must satisfy to be included as definers of the li morphology .",
    "we first focus on our wiyn / hydra sample but we will revisit this issue after we expand the total sample using previously published data .",
    "we begin by assuming that all ( wiyn / hydra ) highly probable members with no evidence of binarity , that are radial velocity members , and have small @xmath2 are included .",
    "we first compare to the three pm members that fall outside the radial velocity peak but show no further evidence for binarity and have small @xmath2 ( vb 2 , vb 4 , and vb 127 ) .",
    "these are strongly consistent with the very tight g - dwarf li - t@xmath1 trend , so even though these pm members fall outside the hyades radial velocity peak , and the numbers are limited , it appears that when such stars have small @xmath2 they can be included as definers of the li morphology .",
    "the left panel of figure 10 marks both of these prime data types with solid circles ( detections ) and solid inverted triangles ( upper limits ) .",
    "we next look at our four observed stars that are listed as binaries in p98 but show no evidence for binarity in our observed spectra , are radial velocity members , and have small @xmath2 ( vb 39 , vb 106 , vb 114 , and vb 142 ) .",
    "nonetheless , these stars also fall right on top of the very tight g - dwarf li - t@xmath1 trend ( the left panel of figure 10 marks these with pluses ) .",
    "these data suggest that if known binaries show no evidence of binarity in their spectra from fourier analysis and @xmath2 is small , then the effects ( if any ) of the secondary are negligible in determining t@xmath1 and a(li ) .",
    "to help illustrate the relatively minor t@xmath1 based errors for these g dwarfs with small @xmath2 , the left panel of figure 10 shows the typical @xmath2 of 40 k and its resulting affect on a(li ) .",
    "in contrast to these g - dwarf types with a tightly consistently li depletion trend , the one g dwarf with large @xmath2 falls off of the li - t@xmath1 trend ( see vb 49 ; open circle in the left panel figure 10 ) .",
    "although it does not fall very far off , the trend is so tight that this star appears to be clearly discrepant from the trend ; even the large @xmath2 and the resulting effects on @xmath12a(li ) ( illustrated in the left panel of figure 10 by the diagonal line passing through vb 49 ) are not enough to bring this star to the trend .",
    "this and the illustrated typical error show that errors in a(li ) that result from errors in t@xmath1 go fairly parallel to the li - t@xmath1 trend in this region , so changes in t@xmath1 must be very large to bring stars like this back to the li - t@xmath1 trend .",
    "furthermore , the inclusion of such stars in other clusters might lead to overestimates of the intrinsic scatter around the li - t@xmath1 trend .",
    "this underscores the importance of using multiple color indices to estimate t@xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "lastly , note the large a(li ) uncertainties of the other high @xmath2 stars ( the single star vb 11 and the binaries vb 14 , and vb 38 ; similarly illustrated in the left panel of figure 10 by diagonal lines passing through each data point ) , and thus the difficulties  which have often been overlooked  in determining the precise li morphology in that region . the hot side of the li gap is sometimes portrayed as a steep function of t@xmath1 ( e.g. , bt86 ; at09 ) . being sure that this is the case requires using multiple stars that have more accurate t@xmath1 than vb 38 ( and more accurate li as well ) .",
    "we will revisit these issues and make a final determination of which stars define the li morphology after we have supplemented the sample with previous studies .",
    "we have supplemented our hyades a(li ) with previous observations , and our first step was to ensure that all a(li ) we use are on the same scale .",
    "we compared our a(li ) of stars in common with some key previous studies , namely t93 , bt86 and bb88 , soderblom et  al .",

    "the t93 spectra have higher resolution ( r @xmath26 32,000 ) than our wiyn / hydra spectra , providing us with an opportunity to test for possible systematics introduced through the different spectrographs and spectral reductions ; it is for this reason that we intentionally observed 24 of the t93 stars using wiyn / hydra . for bt86 , bb88 , and s90 , and bc89",
    "we used the li 6708  equivalent widths from these studies and have rederived a(li ) using our cogs , stellar parameters , and correction of the blended fe i line at 6707.44  in the cases when this was not already done in the published equivalent widths .",
    "three special cases in bt86 ( vb 36 , vb 51 , and vb 124 ) were treated differently and will be discussed in more detail in the following paragraph .",
    "we also note that we did not reanalyze stars from the bc89 sample for which we derived a t@xmath1 of greater than 7750 k. lastly , t13 performed spectral synthesis but did not give corresponding equivalent widths .",
    "therefore , we used our method of deriving synthetic equivalent widths described at the beginning of section 6 : we applied their abundances and t@xmath1 to our cogs to give effective equivalent widths . adopting these equivalent widths and",

    "for such weak and broadened li ( spanning more than 2  ) this begins to illustrate the challenges with direct application of the published equivalent width measurements in bt86 to derive self - consistent a(li ) on our scale . when creating comparable synthetic spectra for vb 36 , vb 51 , and vb 124 by applying our derived atmospheric parameters and each star",

    "we suspect bt86 placed their continua below those given by our syntheses .",
    "this is very easy to do because the highest peaks of , for example , vb 90 s synthetic spectrum ( between 6700.0 and 6702.5  ) are at absorption levels @xmath00.998 and thus lie below the synthetic continuum ( of 1.000 ) ; in other words , no portions of the metal - rich and rotationally - broadened spectra ( near the li feature ) are pure continuum . without direct synthesis of the actual bt86 spectra",
    ", it is very difficult to know what a(li ) we would derive on our scale .",
    "nevertheless , we attempt to derive what information we can from the published detections .",
    "if in each star s synthetic spectrum we instead measure the equivalent widths relative to the nearby spectral peak ( @xmath06706.1  ) and not the real continuum , we find non - li components for the li regions in vb 36 , vb 51 , and vb 124 at 3 , 6.3 , and 8 m , respectively .",

    "three stars that have been previously used to help define the li - t@xmath1 morphology of the li gap have high @xmath2 .",
    "these three are vb 128 ( an apparently single star ) , vb 34 ( an sb2 ) , and vb 124 ( a triple system ) .",
    "bt86 and bb88 derived a(li ) for both components of vb 34 , and assumed a t@xmath1 for the primary of vb 124 based on its spectral type , but the assumed t@xmath1 are rather uncertain ; thus , their usefulness in defining the morphology of the li gap is limited .",
    "for example , using the b - v color of vb 124 , we find t@xmath1=6320 k , which is 310 k lower than bt86 s value of 6630 k. bt86 s value may be more accurate if the redder companions make the overall b - v color redder than that of the primary alone .",
    "however , the primary s t@xmath1 remains uncertain , and in a region where the li - t@xmath1 trend is a steep function of t@xmath1 , it is best to exclude stars with high @xmath2 . for similar reasons we also do not analyze the two components of vb 34 . in section 7.2",
    "we look more closely at the complex hyades li gap in comparison to the similar praesepe li gap .",
    "very striking is the enormous range in a(li ) of nearly 2 dex ( or perhaps more ) at the hot edge of the li plateau near 6250 k. at the high end are the two sptlbs ( see discussion below ) with a(li ) near 3.2 , the li plateau itself with a(li ) near 3.0 , and well below that is vb 77 ( red plus ) with a(li)=2.31 , and lastly , well below that is vb 143 with a(li)@xmath141.53 .",
    "if this enormous range in a(li ) at virtually identical t@xmath1 is real , it presents quite a challenge for models to explain .",
    "the high reliability of the sptlbs and the li plateau are discussed below and above , respectively .",
    "vb 77 is a radial velocity member that meets some of our high - reliability criteria such as small @xmath2 but p98 labeled it a binary ; a fourier cross - correlation analysis to detect a possible companion would be useful .",
    "t93 discuss various membership indicators for vb 143 and conclude that this puzzling star is indeed a hyades member , as does p98 .",
    "the conclusions that can be drawn about g - dwarf li from the combined sample are striking , and they corroborate those drawn from the wiyn / hyades sample alone .",
    "the stars with small @xmath2 fall right on the very tight g - dwarf li - t@xmath1 relation found by the wiyn / hydra sample .",
    "furthermore , stars with small @xmath2 that are p98 binaries also fall right on the very tight li - t@xmath1 relation defined by the wiyn / hydra sample .",
    "so _ all _ stars in this region that have small @xmath2 fall on a very tight li - t@xmath1 relation , regardless of whether they are bona fide single stars , suspected binaries with no evidence of contamination from the secondary in the spectra , radial velocity members , or those that fall outside the radial velocity single - star membership peak ( we reiterate that all stars are highly probable pm members and photometric members ) .",
    "conversely , most other stars seem to exhibit more scatter around the tight li - t@xmath1 trend : the t93 single stars and binaries with large @xmath2 exhibit far more scatter around the g - dwarf li trend than the stars with low @xmath2 .",
    "changes in li due to errors in t@xmath1 move a star parallel to the li - t@xmath1 trend , rather than bring it back to the trend . therefore",
    ", t@xmath1 errors alone can not explain this increased scatter .",
    "lastly , for the otherwise well behaved stars that photometrically deviate from the single star fiducial , there are only two of these stars in the hyades .",
    "these stars appear to be consistent with the observed li trend but we will not consider these stars in our final hyades sample for the sake of consistency because these types of stars are shown to be problematic in the praesepe sample ( see section 6.2.3 ) .",
    "one of the main motivations of this work is to study g - dwarf li depletion , and since the very tight li - t@xmath1 is a well - behaved function of t@xmath1 , we can define this trend by fitting a third - order polynomial between t@xmath1 = 6300 and 5300 k ( dashed curve in the right panel of figure 10 ) . for the fit",
    ", we used only solid circles and pluses ; that is , we used only li detections with small @xmath2 that are consistent with the hyades single star fiducial and that are single stars or stars with no evidence of contamination from a secondary in the spectra .",
    "figure 10 also shows an appropriate li isochrone from the standard models of p97 ( solid line ) and sp14 ( dashed dot ) assuming an age of 700 myr and [ fe / h]=+0.15 , and initial a(li ) of a(li)@xmath34=3.31 , which is equal to the meteoritic abundance ( the solar a(li)@xmath34 , anders & grevesse 1989 ) .",
    "the hyades a(li)@xmath34 must be assumed because it remains unknown .",
    "both the li gap and g - dwarf hyads have depleted far more li than the p97/sp14 standard models predict , and the slope of the g - dwarf depletion is also greater than that in the models .",
    "the standard model fails to explain any of the observations and the discrepancy becomes even larger if we adopt galactic li production , giving that the super - solar - metallicity hyades formed with even more li than the sun did . in fact , evidence for the galactic li production might be present in the right panel of figure 10 : we could argue that the p97/sp14 isochrones ought to be at or above vb 6 , vb 20 , and the two sptlbs vb 62 and vb 121 . moving the isochrones upward by roughly 0.10.2 dex to an a(li)@xmath34 of about 3.43.5",
    "would accomplish that , but this remains speculative .",
    "rotationally - induced mixing related to stellar angular momentum loss and internal redistribution has been proposed as a primary agent that might explain the differences between the standard model and observations ( pinsonneault 1988 ; pinsonneault et  al .",
    "1990 ; c95a ) , and sptlbs have provided key evidence supporting the general precepts of these types of models ( s90 ; ddk ; t93 ; deliyannis et  al .  1994 ; ryan & deliyannis 1995 ) .",
    "we re - evaluate the key role of the sptlb a(li ) in light of our self - consistent analysis of the hyades li - t@xmath1 trend .",
    "the rotational models suggest that rotation - related mixing occurs _ after _ standard li depletion is done , toward the end of the pre - ms and during the ms , when angular momentum is lost , and the slowing down of the surface coupled with the spinning up of the interior sets off shear instabilities that cause mixing .",
    "however , tidally locked binaries cooler than @xmath06300 k with periods observed today that are less than @xmath08 to 9 days would have completed most of their spinning down during the early pre - ms ( zahn & bouchet 1989 ) , before the stellar interior was hot enough to destroy li .",
    "they are thus predicted to have higher ( though not necessarily perfectly preserved ) li than normal , single stars do . as noted in previous studies and in support of this scenario ,",
    "this is indeed what sptlbs in the hyades and elsewhere exhibit .",
    "that said , mixing induced by gravity waves may also play a role in the li depletion of g dwarfs ( garcia lopez & spruit 1991 ) .",
    "five sptlbs have been identified , so far , in the hyades ( vb 22 , vb 62 , vb 121 , bd+22@xmath29669 , and bd+22@xmath29635 ) and are included in the right panel of figure 10 .",
    "the first two appear to lie above the li plateau , and since both are sb1s , there is the potential that their a(li ) are reliable .",
    "vb 121 also has small @xmath2 ( only 17 k ! ) , so according to the various arguments presented above , its a(li ) is robustly above the ( now ) very tight li - t@xmath1 trend that defines the li plateau . although vb 62 has a large @xmath2 , a ) errors in li due to errors in t@xmath1 move it a(li ) parallel to the li - t@xmath1 trend , and thus vb 62 remains above the li plateau , and b ) if the secondary is contributing non - negligible flux to the total spectrum , then flux - correcting the primary s li line strength would result in an even _ higher _ a(li ) . therefore",
    ", vb 62 also lies robustly above the li plateau .",
    "the other three sptlbs are sb2s , making it difficult to assess their t@xmath1 and a(li ) .",
    "we derived their a(li ) from the flux - corrected equivalent widths in t93 , rather than from direct synthesis of the spectra , as was the case with the other t93 stars .",
    "vb 22 does seem to lie above the g - dwarf li - t@xmath1 trend , but the large error in t@xmath1 ( and in a(li ) ) means this conclusion is rather tentative ; it is possible vb 22 actually lies on the trend , farther above the trend , or even below the trend .",
    "the two bd stars are the li detections cooler than 5000 k. extension of the li - t@xmath1 g - dwarf trend would suggest that these two stars lie far above the trend .",
    "there is no doubt that these stars contain li , so uncertainties in their a(li ) are unlikely to bring down their a(li ) sufficiently to join the li - t@xmath1 trend at their t@xmath1 shown in the right panel of figure 10 .",
    "and although their t@xmath1 are more limited and only based on b - v , these stars would have to be 600 to 800 k hotter to join the li - t@xmath1 trend , which seems unlikely .",
    "it would appear that these stars really do lie above the li - t@xmath1 trend .",
    "overall , the sptlbs in the hyades do exhibit larger - than - normal a(li ) than the li - t@xmath1 trend , especially in the li plateau region , still providing evidence supporting rotationally - induced mixing as an important agent of li depletion for solar - type stars .",
    "it has also been suggested that the sptlbs lying above the li plateau provide circumstantial evidence that the halo li plateau ( observed at similar t@xmath1 ) is itself depleted , which is of relevance to the cosmological li problem and the testing of big bang theory .    to summarize ,",
    "we have presented evidence that probable members with small @xmath2 as derived from multiple colors , that are either bona fide single stars or show no evidence of contamination in our spectra from a secondary ( e.g. , using _ fxcor _ ) , exhibit a tight li - t@xmath1 relation , which is especially tight for later f / g dwarfs ( the li plateau and g - dwarf li depletion ) .",
    "this is true whether we examine our wiyn / hydra sample only , or whether we combine with several previous studies to form the largest self - consistently analyzed sample to date of a(li ) in hyades dwarfs .",
    "this is also most encouraging for our future wiyn / hydra studies of clusters that have much less pm and binarity information available , if any .",
    "we should be able to define a reliable li - t@xmath1 relation for a cluster as long as we use multiple colors to determine t@xmath1 and @xmath2 , we use only stars that have no evidence of binarity in our spectra , and by necessity we confine the sample to be within the radial velocity single star membership peak because that plus the photometric single - star fiducial sequence will be our primary membership indicators . for the hyades ,",
    "the stars included ( as described above ) in our most reliable li - t@xmath1 relation , which we will refer to as our `` prime sample '' , are indicated by a checkmark in the last column of table 6 .",
    "table 7 shows data for our wiyn / hydra sample of the hyades - aged praesepe , which we found to have indistinguishable metallicity compared to the hyades ( section 4 ) .",
    "table 7 has identical column formatting as table 6 , and again we break the data into single star detections , single star upper limits , binary detections , and binary upper limits .",
    "this binarity is based on the analysis of praesepe in mermilliod et  al .",
    "( 2009 ) , patience et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) , and burkhart & coupry ( 1998 ) .",
    "the left panel of figure 12 shows the a(li ) for praesepe and reveals the same general patterns as in the hyades : a broad range of over 3 dex in a(li ) across a range exceeding 3000 k in temperature ; well - populated and substantial a(li ) near and above 7000 k , a severe li depletion in mid - f dwarfs ( 6700 to 6300 k , the li  gap \" ) , higher a(li)s in the li plateau in late - f / early - g dwarfs ( near 6200 k ) , and the increasingly steep decline in li with lower t@xmath1 in g dwarfs until the li line becomes undetectable near 5000 k.    as with the hyades , binaries that show no clear binary signatures such as a high @xmath2 or double lines still have a(li ) consistent with the li - t@xmath1 trend defined by single stars .",
    "stars with low @xmath2 that have radial velocity inconsistent with the cluster were found in the hyades to have a(li ) in agreement with the li - t@xmath1 trends defined by radial - velocity members . in praesepe , kw 45 and kw 183 were similarly found to have radial velocity inconsistent with praesepe but show no other signs of binarity .",
    "however , we can not perform a detailed comparison because both are cool and heavily depleted with only li upper limits .",
    "lastly , binaries and single stars with high @xmath2 are again found to have significant scatter relative to the well behaved stars with low @xmath2 .",
    "looking at the li gap in more detail , the five detections and two upper limits near the hot edge of the li gap in the very narrow t@xmath1 range 6600 to 6700 k raise again the possibility that the hot edge is indeed a _ very _ steep function of t@xmath1 ( bt86 ; at09 ; section 7.2 ) .",
    "the depleted a(li)=2.68 in kw 370 , which is just slightly hotter at t@xmath1=6925 k , however , brings this view into question , and raises a rather different possibility .",
    "perhaps the hot side of the li gap rises more gradually between 6600 and 7100 k , but at the same time , the three li - rich stars with a(li ) near 2.95 to 3.3 dex and at @xmath06750 k perhaps reflect a huge variation in the behavior of li - gap stars : some deplete their li very severely , whereas some are able to preserve their li almost intact !",
    "it would clearly be of interest to know which of these two rather different scenarios ( if either ) is more realistic .",
    "the cool side of the li gap is well populated at higher a(li ) than in the hyades .",
    "two stars seem to fall below the cool side of the li gap and li plateau , namely kw 371 , and especially kw 392 with its very low a(li)=1.76 , which is also somewhat reminiscent of the hyades dwarf vb 143 in a similarly peculiar location significantly below the li plateau ; however , both of these praesepe dwarfs have high @xmath2 , so we will ignore them .    just as in the hyades ,",
    "the g - dwarf li depletion trend is a tight li - t@xmath1 relation , though not quite as tight as that of the hyades ; a third - order polynomial fit to solid points and pluses is again shown by the dashed line . the solid curve and",
    "the dashed - dot curve are the same p97 and sp14 li isochrones , respectively , shown in figure 10 .",
    "lastly , as discussed in section 4 , there are eight cool praesepe stars that have more limited photometry from u79 .",
    "these stars are distinguished in table 7 by having @xmath2 set to 0 .",
    "none of these stars have li detections , and all are substantially cooler than the low - t@xmath1 end of the g - dwarf li - t@xmath1 trend ( which is based on detections ) . thus , while their stellar parameters have more uncertainty , they do not affect our conclusions .",
    "there have been several previous analyses of li in the dwarfs of praesepe , including bb88 , soderblom et  al .",
    "( 1993a , hereafter s93a ) , burkhart & coupry ( 1998 , hereafter bc98 ) , and boesgaard , roper , & lum ( 2013 , hereafter b13 ) . comparisons of our abundances to b88 find that for the one radial velocity member with a detection ( kw 295 ) in both studies , we find a significantly ( 0.48 dex ) stronger a(li ) . correcting for the difference in t@xmath1 of 82 k accounts for nearly half of the difference in a(li ) , but the remaining is explained by an 18 m stronger equivalent width for our line measurement . in the small sample of b88 , the only star we have not analyzed is the sb2 kw 142 . as with the analysis of the hyades , we do not consider sb2s and the limited number of stars in common prevent us from properly placing kw 142 on a consistent scale .",
    "b13 focused on g dwarfs and performed li synthesis , but they did not publish equivalent widths . therefore , we used our method of deriving synthetic equivalent widths described at the beginning of section 6 : we applied their abundances and t@xmath1 to our cogs to give effective equivalent widths . adopting these equivalent widths and",
    "_ our _ stellar parameters gave the rederived b13 a(li ) .",
    "because no systematic differences were found between the seven stars in common with our sample , we adopted the rederived a(li ) of the four stars we did not observe directly ( kw 23 , kw 58 , kw 181 , kw 301 ) .",
    "for the 26 stars we have in common with s93a there is no overall significant systematic equivalent width or t@xmath1 offset or trend with t@xmath1 .. comparing to the corrected s93a a(li ) ( see soderblom et  al .",
    "1995 ) similarly finds no systematic difference in their published a(li ) and ours .",
    "therefore , we reanalyzed the 27 praesepe stars from s93a that are not in our sample or that of b13 and used these to supplement our praesepe li observations .",
    "again we directly applied their equivalent widths to our parameters and cogs .",
    "lastly , there are five additional praesepe stars in s93a that we do not consider because mermilliod et  al .",
    "( 2009 ) find them to be either non - members ( kw 34 and kw 258 ) or sb2s ( kw 184 , kw 496 , and kw 533 ) .",
    "bc98 focus on hot am stars of praesepe , and while we focus on cooler stars , our samples share kw 286 and kw 350 .",
    "their adopted stellar t@xmath1 are distinct from ours and are typically several 100 k hotter . for kw 286 ,",
    "their adopted t@xmath1 is 399 k hotter than ours , which is a concerning difference , but it well explains their 0.45 dex richer a(li ) .",
    "similarly , for kw 350 their adopted t@xmath1 is 150 k hotter than ours , but this t@xmath1 difference further exacerbates our 0.2 dex richer a(li ) for this star .",
    "these t@xmath1 differences may be related to bc98 determining t@xmath1 from stromgren photometry and be indicative of systematics introduced between different photometric systems , which are relatively minor in the t@xmath1 range of interest in this paper but can become important at these higher temperatures . while there are not enough stars to reliably test for systematics and place the bc98 abundances on a uniform scale with our own , as was done with the hyades we reanalyzed kw 40 , kw 279 , and kw 538 with our parameters and assumed no systematic differences",
    ".      for stars observed in more than one study , we give priority to the a(li ) from our own wiyn / hydra data / analysis first , followed by our rederived abundances from b13 , s93a , and lastly bc98 .",
    "the right panel of figure 12 shows our final combined sample of praesepe a(li ) with our spectral abundances in black , the reanalyzed b13 abundances in red , the s93a abundances in light blue , and the bc98 abundances in dark blue .",
    "we have also marked stars with low @xmath2 that photometrically deviate from the praesepe single star fiducial ( see right panel of figure 3 ) with overlaid yellow data points .",

    "consistent with the trends , this suggests that these stars do not have reliable a(li ) , similar to those with high @xmath2 .",
    "when not considering these stars , however , an apparent scatter in the g - dwarf a(li ) remains .",
    "could this remaining scatter simply be a result of errors ?",
    "for the two stars with the most discrepant a(li ) ( kw 100 and kw 430 ) , the total a(li ) uncertainty for kw 430 is only 0.040 dex , while it is at least 0.5 dex richer in li than the nearly identical kw 433 and kw 314 that have li upper limits .",
    "similarly , the total a(li ) uncertainty for kw 100 is only 0.035 dex , while it is @xmath00.25 dex below the observed li trend .",
    "we reassuringly note , however , the strong consistency of the mean g - dwarf trends in our analysis and that of t13 and s93a .",
    "the hyades and praesepe have indistinguishable age and [ fe / h ] .",
    "do they also have the same li morphology , or are there differences that would require additional factors to explain ?",
    "we now examine this question by comparing their a(li ) from a dwarfs to k dwarfs .",
    "figure 13 shows the prime set of a(li ) for each cluster plotted together against t@xmath1 .",
    "all stars are highly probable pm and photometric members . recalling the discussion of the previous subsections , these prime sets include stars that have small @xmath2 ( @xmath1475 k , from the t@xmath1 derived using the 10 ubvri color combinations ) , that have shown no evidence of binarity in their spectra , and that are photometrically consistent with each cluster s single star fiducials . to be clear , stars are excluded if they have large @xmath2 ( @xmath375 k ) ,",
    "if they have insufficient photometry to measure a @xmath2 , if they have exhibited any evidence of binarity in fxcor , deviate from the cluster fiducial , or if they are sptlbs ; such stars were shown to have larger scatter in the li - t@xmath1 relation compared to the prime set .",
    "radial velocity discrepant stars and those shown to have variable radial velocities ( sb1s ) in other multi - epoch studies are not excluded if they have small @xmath2 . recall that these hyades and praesepe pm members lying outside of the cluster radial velocity peak showed the same li - t@xmath1 behavior as radial velocity members .",
    "in general we find that the two clusters li morphologies are similar and/or complement each other : in t@xmath1 ranges where both clusters have significant numbers of stars , the two cluster li - t@xmath1 patterns are indistinguishable , whereas in t@xmath1 ranges where only one cluster has significant numbers of stars , that cluster s li - t@xmath1 pattern fits in very accurately with the li - t@xmath1 pattern(s ) defined by one or both clusters in the neighboring t@xmath1 ranges .",
    "these remarkable concordances might suggest combining the two clusters to derive a more refined li - t@xmath1 relation for this age and metallicity . in more detail :      both clusters show a similar li morphology for t@xmath357000 k , with most stars congregating near a(li ) = 3.0 to 3.3 , though one hyad and two stars in praesepe show significant li depletions with a(li ) in the range 2.4 to 2.9 or lower .",
    "as is widely known , surface abundances of a stars can be affected by microscopic diffusion processes , mass loss , magnetic fields , and rotation - induced circulation .",
    "such relative uniformity is thus remarkable , and this results from our focusing only on stars with low @xmath2 .",
    "looking for trends , both samples combined do begin to suggest that in a dwarfs the depletion gradually increases with increasing t@xmath1 .",
    "does this represent a true depletion trend or is it indicative of systematics in our color - temperature relation at high t@xmath1 ?",
    "we remind the reader that this is the t@xmath1 where the systematic differences between the deliyannis et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) relation and the ramrez & melndez relation become significant ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "adopting their relation would bring the hot f ( cool a ) stars at 7100 k to 7400 k and accordingly increase their a(li ) by @xmath00.3 dex to @xmath03.6 dex , which is very li rich .",
    "for the stars at higher t@xmath1 the more rapid increase of t@xmath1 with b - v would not produce a a(li ) plateau but would significantly mitigate this apparent a - dwarf trend .",
    "either way , there remains an apparent trend of li depletion with increasing t@xmath1 , although this is not a robust conclusion due to the sample size .      in the li gap we noted in each cluster several outliers above and below the li - gap trends .",
    "however , combining both clusters allows us to draw stronger conclusions than from either cluster alone .    on the cool side of the li gap",
    ", single stars form a very tight li - t@xmath1 relation , whereas ( the few ) binaries with small @xmath2 mostly fall below this tight relation .",
    "( one praesepe low @xmath2 binary , kw 549 , lies significantly above the trend at a(li ) = 3.30 , t@xmath1 = 6367 k. ) this is inconsistent with our finding in g dwarfs , where binaries and single stars with small @xmath2 remain consistent .",
    "is this the result of some key difference in the li depletion processes in these different t@xmath1 ranges ?",
    "does binarity not affect g - dwarf depletion processes but does affect li - gap f - dwarf depletion processes ?",
    "this is an interesting possibility , but because of this we will exclude all binaries , regardless of their @xmath2 , in further analysis of the li gap in the hyades and praesepe .",
    "= 0.0 ( solid blue ) and [ fe / h]=+0.18 ( dotted blue ) with an a(li)@xmath34=3.31 .",
    "the steep depletion trend in the [ fe / h]=+0.18 is remarkably consistent with the observations .",
    "we also note at higher t@xmath1 ( e.g. , the solar model near 6900 k ) the diffusion model predicts a(li ) above the a(li)@xmath34 , which may help explain the super - li - rich star discussed in the introduction in ngc 6633 at t@xmath1=7086 k and a(li)=4.29 . ]",
    "the hot side of the li gap is similar in both clusters in that both have substantial or rising a(li ) in the t@xmath1 range of 6700 to 7100 k , and both clusters show severely depleted a(li ) in the middle of the gap , between t@xmath1 = 6500 and 6700 k. whereas previous studies defined the li - t@xmath1 morphology of the hot side of the li gap using stars that have turned out to have high @xmath2 , our restricting the sample to only stars with low @xmath2 and combining both clusters should in principle yield a clearer picture of the li - t@xmath1 morphology .",
    "six single star detections , one low @xmath2 binary , and three upper limits seem to define a nearly vertically rising trend between 6635 and 6715 k , from a(li ) = 1.70 ( in vb 90 ) to 3.33 ( in vb 20 ) . it is tempting to believe that this vertical wall redefines the hot edge of the li gap , and that slightly hotter stars remain at high levels of a(li ) ; the six stars between 7000 and 7305 k have a(li ) between 3.0 and 3.35 .",
    "figure 14 shows that this wall is consistent with the diffusion models of richer & michaud ( 1993 ) , adopting an a(li)@xmath34 of 3.31 .",
    "although , as these authors acknowledge , the diffusion gap is too narrow , there is impressive agreement between the hot edge of the models and our observations .",
    "two sets of models are shown , with [ fe / h ] = 0.0 and + 0.18 .",
    "the ones with + 0.18 ( close to the hyades / praesepe metallicity ) agree better with the data . assuming",
    "a slightly higher a(li)@xmath34 , such as 3.5 to 3.6 , consistent with the possibility of galactic li production , would make the models agree even better with the wall .",
    "a caveat might be the uncertainty of the predicted t@xmath1 due to uncertainties in the model physics ( richer & michaud 1993 ) and to other factors like the color - t@xmath1 relation .",
    "also , we have discussed a preponderance of evidence that favors rotational mixing as the dominant li depletion mechanism at cooler t@xmath1 , and indeed rotationally - induced mixing can inhibit diffusion . however , we can not rule out diffusion as the cause of the wall .",
    "all that being said , the lower a(li ) = 2.68 of kw 370 suggests another possibility for the li morphology of the hot side of the li gap : that the rise of a(li ) is more gradual , going from 1.70 at t@xmath1 = 6635 k ( vb 90 ) to 3.3 at t@xmath1 = 7000 k. in that context , the four stars ( 3 single stars and 1 binary with low @xmath2 ) near 6700 k that have a(li ) = 3.00 to 3.33 would be remarkable in their li - preserving properties . in this scenario , the middle of the gap would be wider ( 6500 to 6800 k instead of 6500 to 6700 k ) and would exhibit a huge variety of a(li ) , exceeding a range @xmath31.7 dex .",
    "the implications for constraining models are quite different : a vertical wall is different from a more gradual rise , and a huge range of a(li ) in the middle of the li gap is different from the high a(li ) merely reflecting the top of a vertical wall .",
    "unfortunately , our data do not allow us to distinguish between these two possibilities .",
    "the rising a(li ) trends on the cool side of the li gaps are consistent with each other and complement each other , with the hyades showing detections having lower a(li ) in the t@xmath1 range 6400 to 6500 k , and praesepe showing detections with larger a(li ) in the t@xmath1 range 6300 to 6400 k. such complementarity is rather remarkable .",
    "in fact , as mentioned just above , the combination of both clusters prime samples almost suggests a somewhat tight li - t@xmath1 relation for the cool side of the gap .",
    "however , some scatter that does exceed the formal errors is apparent , even when focusing only on single stars .",
    "this scatter is greater than any present in the g dwarfs .",
    "as pointed out in section 6.1.3 , this is especially true at the hot edge of the li plateau near 6250 k , where the a(li ) show a very striking range of nearly 2 dex at virtually the same t@xmath1 .",
    "cummings et  al .",
    "( 2012 ) found that the cool edge of the li gap , where the significant depletion begins , had very similar t@xmath1 in our preliminary hyades and praesepe results in comparison to the gap edges in the much older and much more metal - rich cluster ngc 6253 ( age=3.0 gyr , [ fe / h]=+0.43 ) and the moderately older ( @xmath01.5 gyr ) clusters ngc 3680 , ngc 752 , and ic 4651 .",
    "we note that this is when their stars t@xmath1 are converted back to the t@xmath1 that they had at the hyades age , using y@xmath21 isochrones .",
    "these clusters span a large range in both age and metallicity ( -0.08@xmath14[fe / h]@xmath14 + 0.43 ) and demonstrate that after 700 myr the stars at the cool edge of the li gap do not subsequently deplete significant li , which would broaden the gap .",
    "this may also be true in gaps younger than the hyades and praesepe , but there is limited analysis of the gap in such clusters . because the t@xmath1 of a star of a given mass depends on metallicity , however , cummings et  al .",
    "( 2012 ) concluded that the mass of the cool edge of the li gap does depend on metallicity and results in an approximately linear correlation .",
    "franois et  al .",
    "( 2013 ) expanded upon this with the li analysis of the metal - poor ngc 2243 ( [ fe / h]=-0.54@xmath80.10 ) and found that even at this extreme metallicity there remains a linear correlation between the mass at the cool edge of the gap and metallicity all of the way up to the very metal rich ngc 6253 .",
    "the agreement between the li gaps in the hyades and praesepe strengthens these conclusions .    as summarized in cummings et  al .",
    "( 2012 ) , a variety of evidence favors rotationally - induced mixing over other proposed mechanisms as the main physical cause of the li depletions in the gap .",
    "therefore , it is of interest to see whether any correlations exist between _ v sin i _ and a(li ) , in particular for the cool side of the li gap , which we define to be 6200 to 6635 k. we acknowledge the challenge in defining the precise transition from the cool side to the hot edge of the gap  and can not know if such a precise edge even exists  so the low li detection in vb 90 ( t@xmath1=6635 k , a(li)=1.70 ) is included on the cool side but the just slightly hotter stars ( kw 155 , kw 459 , and so on ) with sharply rising a(li ) are not .",
    "figure 15 shows a(li ) and _ v sin i _ versus t@xmath1 , and a(li ) versus _ v sin i_. the red dashed line is a linear fit for the hyades using only the li detections ( open red ) .",
    "stars with li upper limits ( red inverted triangles ) are shown here only for reference ; any information about li depletion contained in these stars ( such as departure from linearity ) remains largely unknown , at least for now .",
    "another caveat is that the _ v sin i _ can significantly underestimate the true rotation rates .",
    "fortunately , the li detections cover a broad range of _ v sin i _ , t@xmath1 , and a(li ) .",
    "hotter stars are more depleted in li ( upper - left panel , linear correlation coefficient r=-0.95 ) .",
    "hotter stars also rotate much faster ( lower - left panel , r=0.89 ; this comparison does include the li upper limits ) ; thus , faster rotators are more depleted in li ( upper - right panel , r=-0.97 ) .",
    "higher order , non - linear fits were not found to be appropriate in any of the correlations , but the preponderance of li upper limits at the rapid rotation ( and hot ) end in the _ v sin i _ versus t@xmath1 relation suggests a nonlinear drop at that end .",
    "we stress that these fits are correlations only and that no direct causal relationship has been established .",
    "furthermore , in the top two panels , the a(li ) show more scatter around the fits than can be fully accounted for by the errors .",
    "does this suggest that both t@xmath1 and rotation must be considered simultaneously ?    for praesepe ,",
    "the linear fits shown as a solid black line give r=-0.87 for t@xmath1 versus a(li ) , r=-0.91 for _ v sin i _ versus a(li ) , and r=0.76 for t@xmath1 versus _",
    "v sin i _ ( including li upper limits ) .",
    "interestingly , the three upper limits in the _ v sin i _ versus a(li ) plot suggest a downturn ( or a steeper slope in better agreement with that observed in the hyades ) .",
    "all correlations are very similar between the two clusters , as is evident from figure 15 .",
    "thus , not only are the li - t@xmath1 and li - rotation trends qualitatively similar in the two clusters , they are also quantitatively similar",
    ". therefore , we can improve the statistics by combining all 12 li - gap star detections ( dotted lines in figure 15 ) .",

    "the remaining residuals ( @xmath00.1 dex ) can be explained by the abundance errors and the limitations of using _",
    "v sin i _ as a measurement of true rotation rate .",
    "this illustrates that when the t@xmath1 and _ v sin i _ are considered together they can act as a reliable predictor of a(li ) on the cool side of the li gap .",
    "consistent analysis of li gaps in clusters of differing metallicity and age will further help to understand these relationships .    what might be the physical cause of this li - t@xmath1-_v sin i _ correlation ?",
    "we suggest it is at least qualitatively consistent with the basic tenets of the yale rotational models , which tie mixing and the resulting li - depletion to redistribution and loss of stellar angular momentum , for the following reasons . on the cool side of the li gap , angular momentum on the zams",
    "is a steeply increasing function of t@xmath1 ( barnes 2007 ; reinhold & gizon 2015 ) .",
    "periods of stars near the zams increase by a factor of 3 to 4 from the red edge to the blue edge of the cool side of the li gap , and since mass and radius also increase , angular momentum increases by an even greater factor .",
    "note that this increase in angular momentum is quite sizable compared to , for example , stellar mass , which increases only 15% from the red edge to blue edge . by the age of the hyades , stars in this t@xmath1 range",
    "have spun down by factors of 2 to 3 , as measured by their periods .",
    "thus , the amount of angular momentum lost between the zams and 650 myr is a steeply increasing function of t@xmath1 .",
    "to rough approximation , if this angular momentum loss is tied to mixing and li depletion , the li depletion should increase with t@xmath1 .",
    "we want to point out some additional factors that may be relevant when considering the complexities of rotational mixing and li depletion in the gap .",
    "these include a ) the depth of the scz ( and thus how much mixing is done by convection versus by rotational mixing , although the scz is already relatively shallow at the red edge and becomes shallower toward the blue edge , so rotational mixing has to do most of the work associated with mixing throughout the whole t@xmath1 range ) , b ) the depth of the li preservation region ( which becomes shallower toward the blue edge ) , and c ) issues such as whether it takes longer for faster rotators to spin down , even if they lose more angular momentum than slower rotators do as they age and spin down .",
    "these various subtleties notwithstanding , it is worth attempting just one example of a quantitative comparison with theory , in particular , with the models of pinsonneault et  al .",
    "( 1990 ) . if the rotational models of pinsonneault et  al .",
    "( 1990 ) are to reproduce the cool side of the li gap , then their figure 15 suggests that the initial angular momentum must increase by a factor of @xmath08 from the cool ( red ) edge to the hot ( blue ) edge of the li gap ( 6200 to 6635 k , as defined above ) .",
    "we test this prediction using the following assumptions and ( rough ) approximations .",
    "we use the ( b - v)-rotational period ( p ) relation of barnes ( 2007 ) , which was derived from open cluster data , and choose 100 myr because stars of the relevant masses have settled onto the ms by that age .",
    "this much gives p@xmath36/p@xmath37 = 3.3 . to convert to angular momentum , we assume the structure of a star at one edge is roughly homologous with that at the other edge , so that the moments of inertia depend on mr@xmath21 in the same way , and that any internal differential rotation with depth is similar in the two stars",
    ". y@xmath21 isochrones with [ fe / h ] = + 0.15 are used to identify appropriate masses and radii at both edges .",
    "( although the time dependence in the barnes ( 2007 ) relation is separable , using an age where the stars have just settled onto their stable ms t@xmath1 helps ensure we are using appropriate masses . )",
    "these assumptions allow a simple ( approximate ) analytical expression for the ratio of angular momenta ( j ) . using the values identified above",
    ", the result is j@xmath37/j@xmath36 = 5.3 . in view of all the simplifying assumptions , this is remarkably close to predicted value of 8 , and thus most encouraging for these types of models . in view of our high - precision li - t@xmath1-_v sin",
    "i _ relation , we call for new detailed theoretical exploration of the formation and evolution of the cool side of the li gap .",
    "both clusters have a(li ) of @xmath03.0 between 6000 and 6200 k. the hyades is more richly populated in this region , but it retains a very tight and consistent a(li ) trend with depletion moderately increasing with decreasing t@xmath1 .",
    "the li plateau for praesepe has fewer stars and an apparent increased scatter that includes a number of moderate outliers .",
    "these stars do not have large @xmath2 and are predominantly single stars that are consistent with the praesepe single star fiducial .",
    "these remaining outliers can not be explained by errors , with the errors of the praesepe plateau stars being consistent with the hyades plateau stars .",
    "does this suggest a true increase in li scatter for these plateau stars in praesepe versus the hyades ? it is an interesting possibility , but again we find that the mean li trends are in remarkable agreement between the two clusters .",
    "each cluster shows a very tight g - dwarf li - t@xmath1 trend , but with the hyades trend appearing even tighter .",
    "this moderate increase in the praesepe g - dwarf li scatter can not be explained by an increase in its abundance errors because they are not larger than those of the hyades .",
    "is this scatter significant and does it represent a distinction between these very similar clusters ?",
    "for example , somers & pinsonneault ( 2016 ) briefly considered the effects on li depletion that differing rotational histories would have on two clusters of identical age and composition , and they find that differing cluster distributions of initial angular momenta can lead to differing observed li spreads in clusters as old as m67 .",
    "distinct distributions of initial angular momenta have now been observed with coker et  al .",

    "s residual distribution relative to this fit with a two - sample kolmogorov - smirnov test finds a p - value of 0.499 .",
    "even when we include all photometrically discrepant g dwarfs with low @xmath2 , which are preferential li outliers in praesepe , this decreases the p - value to only 0.395 .",
    "this means that we can not rule out that these a(li ) are drawn from the same sample .",
    "therefore , the li morphologies of the two clusters are indistinguishable .",
    "these praesepe outliers are still of interest , but the apparent increase in scatter of praesepe remains insignificant and the slight departures of the corresponding trends ( dashed lines ) suggested in both the hottest and coolest g dwarfs are not significant either .",
    "lastly , for k dwarfs both clusters show significant depletion with mostly low li upper limits .",
    "the identical [ fe / h ] and g - dwarf morphologies , in addition to identical trends in the cool side of the li gap , suggest that the two clusters must have had similar a(li)@xmath34 . for this consistency of a(li ) to remain across such a large range of t@xmath1 and li depletions , it is unlikely that there were differences in their a(li)@xmath34 that have been perfectly balanced out across this significant parameter space .",
    "however , this is difficult to test directly because we can not assume that _ any _ of the stars are undepleted .",
    "even if some are , we can not identify them confidently .",
    "for example , we know that while sptlbs on the li plateau are minimally depleted , the depletion is nonetheless greater than zero .",
    "this is suggested by the p97 model predictions , the complexities of component interactions in the sptlb , and the empirical fact that some cluster stars near 6700 to 7200 k seem to have even higher a(li ) than do the sptlbs .",
    "( a cautionary remark : in stars near 7000 k , diffusion may levitate li to the surface from layers below , thereby enriching the surface a(li ) to values _ above _ the initial value ,",
    "so that these stars are also unreliable indicators of the cluster a(li)@xmath34 , deliyannis , steinhauer , & jeffries 2002 . ) in spite of these challenges ,",
    "circumstantial evidence for similar a(li)@xmath34 for the two clusters comes from galactic li production models .",
    "li production processes such as spallation , sne ii , agb stars , and novae have been thought to correlate with the production of fe ( e.g. , romano 1999 ; ryan et  al .",
    "2001 ; travaglio et  al .",
    "2001 ) , so we might expect that two clusters with identical [ fe / h ] will have formed with a similar a(li)@xmath34 .",
    "standard theory predicts that g - dwarf li depletion depends on [ fe / h ] , but differences in overall metallicity will also cause differences in li depletion even in stars with the same [ fe / h ] .",
    "therefore , in two stars with the same [ fe / h ] but different [ alpha / fe ] , the more alpha - rich star will deplete more li ( e.g. , swenson et  al .",
    "because the two clusters have identical li morphologies and [ fe / h ] , we might then also expect that the two clusters will have similar [ alpha / fe ] .",
    "indeed , carrera & pancino ( 2011 ) find that both clusters have a solar [ @xmath5/fe ] .",
    "however , this result is based on only 3 red giants in each cluster .    focusing on the degree of the g - dwarf li depletion , and as discussed in section 6.1 , it is clear that the hyades and praesepe g dwarfs have depleted far more of their li than predicted by the p97/sp14 standard models .",
    "if galactic li production means that our assumed a(li)@xmath34 for the standard li isochrones should be even higher than the meteoritic value of 3.31 that was assumed , then the discrepancy between the models and observations is even larger .",
    "rotationally - induced mixing is likely to be important , as evidenced by the higher a(li ) seen in the sptlbs .",
    "however , gravity waves may also play an important role , especially at later times when the effects of rotational mixing diminish .",
    "regardless , the tightness of the g - dwarf li morphology suggests that the correct mechanism(s ) produce very little , if any , scatter at this age .",
    "therefore , if rotational mixing creates both the cool side of the li gap and the g - dwarf li depletion , it must be able to create less li scatter in the g dwarfs as compared to the li - gap dwarfs",
    ". this might be possible if , for example , the higher - massed li gap stars formed with a larger range in initial angular momentum than the g dwarfs did , as suggested by barnes ( 2007 ) and reinhold & gizon ( 2015 ) .",
    "another possibility is the rotational models described in somers & pinsonneault ( 2015 ) , where rotation correlates with radial inflation during the pms and can strongly affect li depletion .",
    "this creates the li scatter of order 1 dex observed in the well - studied young pleiades , with faster rotating g dwarfs undergoing more inflation and hence significantly less depletion during the pms . in comparison ,",
    "the predicted spread in f - dwarf pms depletion is relatively minor .",
    "is it by chance that at the age of the hyades the g - dwarf a(li ) reach a brief equilibrium ? specifically , does the subsequent rotationally - induced mixing that occurs during the ms and that causes faster rotators to deplete relatively more li balance the effects of inflated radii that dominate during pms li depletion ?    looking at the broader picture , in comparison to both the hyades and praesepe the young pleiades - aged clusters show much larger li scatter in their g dwarfs ( e.g. , soderblom et  al .",
    "1993b ) , and very old clusters like m67 also show greater scatter ( pasquini et  al .",
    "2008 ; jones et  al .",

    ", we derive cluster means of 39.1@xmath80.2(@xmath15 ) and 34.7@xmath80.2(@xmath15 ) for the hyades and praesepe , respectively , in outstanding agreement with previous studies .    to strengthen further our abundance results we also performed a thorough analysis of each star s photometry . instead of basing the spectral parameters on only one color , we examined all 10 colors derivable from ubvri photometry .",
    "we created empirical color - color relations between each color and b - v using each cluster s single - star fiducial .",
    "this allowed us to combine b - v with nine additional effective b - v colors transformed from the other colors .",
    "this creates a robust multicolor based b - v and t@xmath1 . across these multiple colors ,",
    "some of the hyades and praesepe stars have high @xmath2 ( @xmath375 k ) , which could be caused by binarity or atmospheric peculiarities .",
    "indeed , a large fraction of known spectroscopic binaries in both clusters are found to have high @xmath2 .    considering only praesepe radial velocity members with low @xmath2 that are rotating slowly ( _ v sin i _ @xmath14 25 km s@xmath10 ) , and using 16 isolated fe i lines we find ( from 415 fe i measurements in 39 stars ) a cluster mean [ fe / h]=0.156@xmath80.004 ( @xmath15 ) , which is quantitatively consistent with our result for 37 hyades proper motion members of [ fe / h]=0.146@xmath80.004(@xmath15 ) . daytime solar spectra taken with the same instrumentation",
    "were used to define solar gf values , thus placing our results on a purely self - consistent scale relative to the sun .",
    "overall , the majority of the lines are remarkably well - behaved across a large range in t@xmath1 .",
    "we discarded those lines that were not well - behaved , stronger than 150 m , or too noisy ( @xmath14 3@xmath12 according to the @xmath12 relation of d93 ) .",
    "the stellar [ fe / h ] show no trend with t@xmath1 over a range of t@xmath1 that exceeds 1700 k.    spectral li synthesis of our stars finds the well - established li - t@xmath1 morphologies in these two clusters , with li - rich a dwarfs , heavily depleted li - gap f dwarfs , a richer li plateau in late f / early g dwarfs , increasing li depletion with decreasing t@xmath1 in g dwarfs , and k dwarfs having undetectable li .",
    "we supplement our sample of a(li ) with analysis of spectra from t93 of stars that we ourselves did not observe , having applied the same spectral synthesis techniques . additionally , we reanalyzed published li equivalent widths and synthetic a(li ) from other li studies of these clusters using our own stellar parameters and cogs , and placed all a(li ) on a consistent scale with our own observations .",
    "the resulting total samples constitute the largest self - consistently analyzed samples of a(li ) in both clusters .    while t93 found that some binaries have larger li scatter , we find ( more broadly ) that stars with large @xmath2 have larger li scatter about the mean li - t@xmath1 trends than do stars with low @xmath2 , and so we exclude such stars from further consideration ( except for some sptlbs , which typically lie above the mean trends , as expected from models with rotational mixing combined with tidal circularization theory ) . for each cluster",
    "we define a  prime \" subsample consisting of probable members with low @xmath2 and no measurable spectroscopic evidence of contamination from a secondary ( from _ fxcor _ ) , even if they are known binaries from other studies .",
    "the resulting tight li - t@xmath1 relations are most encouraging for our future wiyn / hydra studies of clusters that have little or no proper motion and binarity information available , where we can impose the restriction to consider only stars that have radial velocities consistent with single star membership and a low @xmath2 .",
    "using only the prime samples leads to the conclusion that where both clusters have a significant number of members their li - t@xmath1 morphologies are indistinguishable over the entire t@xmath1 range under consideration , which spans 3000 k ( 4800 to 7800 k ) .",
    "each cluster s li morphology is also highly complementary to that of the other cluster , in the sense that where one cluster has a paucity of stars , the other cluster s li - t@xmath1 trend merges remarkably with the li - t@xmath1 trends on either side of the t@xmath1 range in question . we thus propose that the combined prime samples for both clusters offers stronger constraints for models than does the sample from either cluster alone .",
    "armed with the combined prime samples , we re - evaluate and refine knowledge of the li - t@xmath1 morphologies from a dwarfs to k dwarfs .",
    "previously , the hot side of the li gap was defined mostly by hyads that we now know have large @xmath2 . if instead we use the combined prime samples , two possible morphologies emerge .",
    "one is that a nearly vertical  wall \" of a(li ) rises in a tiny t@xmath1 range from a(li ) = 1.70 at 6635 k to 3.33 at 6715 k. such a wall could be consistent with diffusion .",
    "although , as we discuss , there is a large variety of evidence suggesting the rotational mixing is the dominant li depletion mechanism for cooler gap dwarfs , diffusion can not be ruled out as the cause of the wall .",
    "the second possibility is that the rise in a(li ) is more gradual from a(li ) = 1.70 at 6635 k to 3.30 at 7000 k , in which case , remarkably , four stars near 6700 k are minimally depleted ( a(li ) @xmath4 3.0 ) and lie well above their neighbors .",
    "unfortunately , we can not distinguish between these two possibilities .",
    "the middle of the li gap ( 6500 to 6700 k for possibility 1 , above , or 6500 to 6800 k for possibility 2 ) is at least as deep as a(li ) = 1.7 , and is thus at least 1.6 dex below the a(li)@xmath38 = 3.31 , or at least 1.7 to 1.8 dex below a(li)@xmath34 if the initial cluster value is at 3.4 to 3.5 .",
    "the cool side of the li gap ( 6635 to 6200 k ) shows rising li with decreasing t@xmath1 .",
    "most binaries deviate from the much tighter li morphology defined by the single stars ; perhaps binarity is somehow related to li depletion in this t@xmath1 range . considering only single stars from the prime samples",
    ", we find that hyades and preasepe each have linear anti - correlations between a(li ) and _ v sin i _ , as was found for the hyades by bt86 and boesgaard ( 1987 ) , that are very similar for the two clusters .",
    "we also find similar anti - correlations between a(li ) and t@xmath1 for the two clusters , as well as similar correlations between _ v sin i _ and t@xmath1 .",
    "there is moderate scatter in these correlations that can not be fully explained by the errors .",
    "however , consideration of the full combined sample from both clusters in 3-dimensions results in a tighter relation when considering li , _ v sin i _ , and t@xmath1 simultaneously .",
    "considering both the errors and the limitations of using _",
    "v sin i _ to represent rotation rates , this 3-dimensional relation may be able to explain most of observed scatter .",
    "these patterns are consistent with the basic tenets of the yale - style rotational models . in this t@xmath1 range , angular momentum on the zams",
    "is a steeply increasing function of t@xmath1 . by the age of the hyades , stars in this t@xmath1 range",
    "have spun down by a factor of 2 to 3 , in terms of their periods .",
    "thus , the amount of angular momentum lost between 100 and 650 myr is also a steeply increasing function of t@xmath1 .",
    "to first approximation , the rotational models we have discussed tie mixing and li depletion to loss of angular momentum , providing a natural explanation for the cool side of the li gap .",
    "( we have also mentioned some additional factors that may be important . )",
    "a semi - quantitative comparison with the rotational models of p90 lends very encouraging support to these types of models .",
    "we call for a new detailed theoretical exploration of the formation and evolution of the cool side of the li gap , in view of the refinements we have provided of the li - t@xmath1-_v sin i _ relation .",
    "g dwarfs in both clusters show decreasing a(li ) with decreasing t@xmath1 , with very little scatter . unlike on the cool side of the li gap , g dwarf binaries ( with low @xmath2 ) fall right on the trends defined by single stars .",
    "( recall that , by contrast , stars with large @xmath2 show significant scatter around these trends . )",
    "the two cluster trends are indistinguishable",
    ". it might appear to the eye that praesepe has more scatter but a ks test can not rule out that both clusters are drawn from the same sample . if additional parameters besides metallicity and age exist that govern cluster g - dwarf depletion trends , such as the distribution of initial angular momenta ,",
    "then we have not detected evidence for the importance of such parameters .",
    "or it would seem that any additional parameters that are important are also consistent in these two clusters .    the strong consistency in the li - t@xmath1 trends in both clusters merits further discussion and perhaps also some speculation .",
    "while the strong consistency in hyades and praesepe a(li ) suggests that clusters with similar [ fe / h ] likely undergo very similar li depletion patterns at similar age across a broad range of t@xmath1 , this also suggests that they have consistent a(li)@xmath34 .",
    "of course , more complex scenarios are conceivable .",
    "for example , one cluster might have formed with a higher a(li)@xmath34 , which would require galactic li production that somehow differs for the same [ fe / h ] .",
    "this would also require that all of its stars depleted more li during their lifetime ( maybe because of higher typical initial stellar angular moments ) in just the right way so as to match the other cluster s li morphology at the current age .",
    "for now we accept the far simpler scenario until new information comes along that demands greater complexity .",
    "this simpler scenario purports both that galactic li production ( that is , the cluster a(li)@xmath34 ) correlates with metallicity and that stellar li depletion ( both standard and non - standard ) is identical in clusters of identical age and metallicity .",
    "we fully acknowledge the dangers of drawing general conclusions from a sample of only two clusters , and we encourage the study of larger numbers of clusters that have identical age and metallicity .",
    "this study provides a strong foundation for further analysis of hyades - aged clusters .",
    "specifically , studying hyades - aged clusters of differing metallicity can test the potential effects of differing [ fe / h ] on li depletion , testing model predictions and constraining future models , and can explore whether there might be evidence for differences in the cluster a(li)@xmath34 .",
