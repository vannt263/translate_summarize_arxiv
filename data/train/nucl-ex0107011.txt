    "the study of sub- and near - threshold proton - induced production of @xmath0-mesons in nuclei has received considerable interest during the last two decades . due to the rather high @xmath0-production threshold in free nucleon - nucleon collisions ( @xmath7  gev ) and to the large mean free path of @xmath0-mesons in nuclear matter ,",
    "one hopes to extract information about the intrinsic properties of the target nuclei and in - medium properties of the kaons . obviously , in order to extract this information , it is essential to determine the @xmath0-production mechanisms .",
    "total @xmath0-production cross sections have been measured at the pnpi synchrocyclotron for targets between be and pb and projectile energies @xmath8 between 0.8 and 1.0  gev  @xcite , i.e. , at beam energies far below the free nucleon - nucleon threshold .",
    "inclusive differential cross sections have been studied at bevalac  @xcite , saturne  @xcite and celsius  @xcite .",
    "partial momentum spectra have been obtained at different laboratory emission angles in the range @xmath9 , at projectile energies between 1.2 and 2.1  gev .",
    "recently , full momentum spectra at forward emission angles @xmath10 have been measured with the anke spectrometer of cosy - jlich @xcite at @xmath11 gev .",
    "@xmath0 production has also been studied at itep @xcite , where kaons with fixed momenta and emission angle @xmath12 were identified at projectile proton energies of 1.75 to 2.9  gev .",
    "the results were discussed in terms of different models  @xcite , in particular of single or two - step reactions , the latter with the creation of an intermediate pion . it has been argued that the dependence of the @xmath0-production cross section on the target mass @xmath13 is sensitive on the mechanism dominantly contributing to kaon production .    in sect .  [",
    "sec : mass ] it is studied whether a systematic analysis of the @xmath13 dependence of the existing data allows , indeed , to draw conclusions on the involved reaction mechanisms . in sect .",
    "[ sec : spectra ] it is shown that data taken at the same beam energy @xmath8 but for different kaon momenta and emission angles can be easily compared if plotted as a function of the four - momentum transfer @xmath6 between the beam proton and the outgoing kaon .",
    "the first aim of our analysis is to evaluate the exponent @xmath14 by fitting the cross sections measured for different target nuclei with an @xmath15 dependence .",
    "we analyze available data on @xmath0-production in @xmath1 collisions at beam energies @xmath16  gev . the data from refs .",
    "@xcite are not taken into account here , since only a single target material was used for these measurements .",
    "a similar analysis of the @xmath13 dependence for meson production at high energies can be found in in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the target - mass dependence for @xmath0-meson production in @xmath1 collisions can be factorized in terms of the @xmath13 dependence of the production process and that of the kaon propagation and distortion in the nuclear medium . due to strangeness conservation",
    ", kaons with relatively low momenta which are considered in this work , are not absorbed in nuclear matter after their creation and can carry out the information about the production mechanism",
    ". also quasi - elastic scattering of @xmath0-mesons in nuclei is substantially suppressed leading to a large mean free path of @xmath17  fm .",
    "the @xmath13 dependence for direct kaon production in collisions of the beam proton with a single target nucleon is given by the inelasticity of the @xmath1 interaction .",
    "this also holds for the production of other mesons , since the summation over all possible mesonic inelastic @xmath1 reaction channels is proportional to the total inelastic @xmath1 cross section .",
    "the data  @xcite on total inelastic proton - nucleus cross sections can be well fitted by an @xmath15 dependence with @xmath18 at proton beam energies from 0.84 to 2  gev .",
    "modifications of the @xmath13 dependence can be due to the intrinsic momenta of the participating nucleons , to pauli blocking and other nuclear effects , which essentially should not depend on the target mass  @xcite .",
    "therefore , one expects that the @xmath0-production cross section is proportional to @xmath19 if the kaons are dominantly produced via the direct production mechanism .",
    "the @xmath0-mesons can also be produced in two - step mechanisms with intermediate pion production in @xmath20 reactions followed by a @xmath21 process on a second target nucleon . since",
    "two nucleons are needed for the kaon production , a stronger @xmath13 dependence for two - step production as compared with direct kaon production is expected .",
    "depending on the beam energy , @xmath0-production may be due to both , the direct and two - step reaction mechanisms . at low beam energies the two - step processes are energetically favorable since the intrinsic nucleon motion can be utilized twice .",
    "it has also been suggested that , in particular at deep subthreshold energies , @xmath0-production is due to many - body interactions ( like e.g.  the formation of clusters in the target nucleus ) @xcite or is a reflection of a high degree of collectivity in the target nucleus @xcite .",
    "we expect that such effects are proportional to the number of target nucleons and , therefore , the cross section should scale as @xmath22 .",
    "total @xmath0-production cross sections @xmath23 in proton - nucleus collisions at @xmath24  gev for @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 as target nuclei have been measured by koptev et al .",

    "we recall that the threshold for @xmath0-production in free @xmath30 collisions is 1.58 gev and , thus , the pnpi measurements were devoted to study deep - subthreshold strangeness - production mechanisms . at each beam energy @xmath23",

    "the strong @xmath13 dependence of the total @xmath0-production cross section has been interpreted @xcite as an indication for the dominance of non - direct @xmath0-meson production in @xmath1 collisions at energies far below the free nucleon - nucleon threshold .",

    "it is found that the data clearly follow an exponential dependence .",
    "the fitted slopes @xmath40 , see table  [ tabt ] , substantially depend on the proton - beam energy . at small @xmath8",
    "the @xmath6 dependence is steeper .",
    "however , when comparing the data with those from @xcite , the different slopes can not completely be attributed to the variation of @xmath8 , see first and fifth line of table  [ tabt ]",
    ". the most probable explanation could be essentially different excitations of the residual nuclei in these cases .",
    "this problem clearly needs further inverstigation . at low @xmath8 the large values",
    "might be caused by the subthreshold production mechanisms . with the presently available data it is not possible to extract a systematic dependence of the parameters @xmath44 and @xmath40 on @xmath8 .",
    "figure  [ mi1_bad ] shows the @xmath6 dependence of the invariant @xmath0-production cross section from @xmath42 collisions at @xmath45  gev and @xmath46  @xcite .",

    ". an important feature of the data  @xcite is that they were essentially collected at positive values of @xmath6 . in principle , the measurements probe the region around the maximum positive squared momentum transfer @xmath50 .    as we found before , the @xmath6 dependence can not be trivially factorized from the @xmath8 dependence . for the data from fig .",
    "[ mi1k ] , each experimental point corresponds to a different proton - beam energy @xmath8 which , for fixed @xmath34 and @xmath35 , can be calculated with eq.[tdef ] .",
    "also @xmath50 is a function of @xmath8 , and different for each of the data points , which makes the analysis of the data quite ambiguous .",

    "the dependence of the invariant @xmath0-production cross section obviously changes and becomes very steep in the range @xmath62  gev@xmath4 where it can be fitted by eq.[eq : tdep1 ] with @xmath63 the strong decrease of the cross section towards @xmath50 is not surprising since this region corresponds to the formation of hypernuclei which characteristically is accompanied by very small cross sections , see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "table [ tabt ] shows that all available data taken at subthreshold energies cover only very limited ranges of @xmath6 , making systematical analyses , like e.g.  the extraction of the remaining @xmath8 and @xmath35 dependences , impossible .",
    "obviously , more data are needed at different proton - beam energies @xmath8 , as well as kaon angles different from the previously measured ones .",
    "according to the reaction kinematics shown by eq .",
    "[ tmax ] , the extreme values @xmath64 , corresponding to large @xmath6 intervals , are accessible at forward laboratory angles @xmath65 . in this respect the anke spectrometer",
    "@xcite is particularly useful since it allows to measure kaon production at @xmath66 , and offers a wide kaon - momentum coverage for beam energies in the range @xmath67 gev .",
    "our analysis of the target - mass dependence of @xmath0-meson production in @xmath1 collisions at @xmath16  gev show that , based on the existing data @xcite , it is not possible to draw unambiguous conclusions about the underlying reaction mechanisms . in particular , at @xmath11  gev there is a discrepancy between the pnpi data on total cross sections and those from anke obtained under forward angles . the data on differential cross sections indicate that the parameter @xmath14 only weakly depends on the beam energy @xmath8 and kaon emission angle @xmath35 and is independent of the kaon momentum .",
    "surprisingly , for all these data taken in the energy range @xmath68 gev , the target - mass dependence is close to the expectation for direct kaon production .",
    "we conclude that further @xmath0-momentum spectra should be measured at forward angles and higher beam energies",
    ". the @xmath13 dependence of such data should be most sensitive to a transition from one- to two - step reactions .",
    "furthermore , microscopical model calculations should be performed which include rescattering effects of the produced kaons in the nuclear medium .",
    "the invariant @xmath0-production cross sections obtained under different kinematical conditions show an overall exponential scaling behaviour with the four - momentum transfer between the beam proton and the produced kaon for @xmath69 .",
    "this indicates that the regge model is applicable at large negative values of @xmath6 even for subthreshold kaon production down to @xmath45  gev .",
    "the dependence on @xmath6 becomes steeper for small beam energies and kaon emission angles @xmath35 .",
    "it would be interesting to check by future measurements whether for @xmath69 the exponential @xmath6 scaling is violated at @xmath65 . it can be speculated that here the @xmath6 dependence becomes very strong .    at small negative values , @xmath70 ,",
    "the invariant cross sections are almost independent of @xmath6 , if measured at the same beam energy @xmath8 .",
    "this indicates a transition from the regge regime to boson - exchange models .",
    "for @xmath5 the data show a strong falloff towards the kinematical limit corresponding to the formation of hypernuclei .",
