    "<S> we studied the diffusion and the relaxation of the polarized quasiparticle spins in superconductors . to that end </S>",
    "<S> , quasiparticles of polarized spins were injected through an interface of a mesoscopic superconducting al wire in proximity contact with an overlaid ferromagnetic co wire in the single - domain state . </S>",
    "<S> the superconductivity was observed to be suppressed near the spin - injecting interface , as evidenced by the occurrence of a finite voltage for a bias current below the onset of the superconducting transition . </S>",
    "<S> the spin diffusion length , estimated from finite voltages over a certain length of al wire near the interface , was almost temperature independent in the temperature range sufficiently below the superconducting transition but grew as the transition temperature was approached . </S>",
    "<S> this temperature dependence suggests that the relaxation of the spin polarization in the superconducting state is governed by the condensation of quasiparticles to the paired state . </S>",
    "<S> the spin relaxation in the superconducting state turned out to be more effective than in the normal state .    </S>",
    "<S> recently the spin - dependent electron transport has been the subject of intensive studies . </S>",
    "<S> the key element of the phenomenon is to inject a current of spin - polarized conduction electrons into a mesoscopic or nano - scale non - magnetic metal or semiconductor , control , and detect the resulting spin state . </S>",
    "<S> spin - polarized electron can be injected from a ferromagnet ( f ) into the system under study.@xcite to realize the spin - dependent electronic conductance or  </S>",
    "<S> spintronics \" it is essential to obtain the accurate information on the characteristic spin - relaxation time or length of the injected electrons in the metallic or semiconducting system in the presence of spin - relaxing scattering.@xcite the spin - relaxation originates from both scattering by magnetic impurities and spin - orbit scattering of conduction electrons , but the relaxation due to spin - orbit scattering is dominant without magnetic impurities . </S>",
    "<S> a number of studies on the spin relaxation in metals have been done using nonlocal spin injection,@xcite conduction electron spin resonance,@xcite weak localization,@xcite and superconducting tunneling spectroscopy.@xcite observed spin relaxation rate using different techniques at room temperature , where the electron - phonon interaction predominates the spin - orbit scattering , reveals reasonable consistency , but it shows a wider spread at low temperatures around liquid helium temperature . </S>",
    "<S> it has been pointed out that @xcite , as the impurity scattering predominates the spin - orbit scattering at low temperatures , the measured spin relaxation rates may depend on different measurement techniques which are sensitive to different impurity - induced spin - orbit scattering .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , the spin relaxation in a superconductor ( s ) , both conventional@xcite and high-@xmath0 cuprate,@xcite has attracted much research interest in relation with the recombination mechanism of the spin - polarized quasiparticles into the singlet cooper - paired state . </S>",
    "<S> a number of studies on the spin diffusion in conventional superconductors , however , have revealed contradicting results . </S>",
    "<S> measurements of spin accumulation effect in f / s / f - type bipolar spin transistors@xcite showed an increase of the spin - diffusion length in superconducting nb films as @xmath1 with @xmath2 , with increasing temperature below the superconducting transition temperature @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> but this result was in contradiction to the increase of the spin - relaxation rate with increasing temperature near @xmath0 from below in superconducting nb films and potassium - doped fulleride ( k@xmath3c@xmath4 ) compounds measured by the electron spin resonance technique.@xcite more recent theoretical studies by yamashita _ </S>",
    "<S> et al._,@xcite however , indicated that the estimated spin - diffusion length in both the superconducting state ( neglecting the charge imbalance effect ) and the normal - metallic state should be the same , implying that the spin - diffusion characteristics should be independent of temperature in the narrow temperature range below @xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , studies on the influence of the spin - polarized quasiparticle injection into high-@xmath0 cuprates@xcite have mainly been focused on the effective suppression of the superconductivity . </S>",
    "<S> the sensitive dependence of the critical current on the spin injection in a low - carrier - density cuprate hybridized with a highly polarized colossal magnetoresistance material is expected to open a way to develop active three - terminal superconducting devices with a high current gain . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , it is expected that the spin injection into cuprates may provide key information on the possible roles of the spin degrees of freedom in bringing about the high-@xmath0 superconducting order . for these purposes also </S>",
    "<S> clear understanding of the spin relaxation mechanism in the cuprates is an essential element .    in this study we injected a spin - polarized current from a ferromagnetic co wire into a mesoscopic superconducting al wire which was in proximity contact with the co wire and observed the resulting suppression of the superconductivity in the al wire . in general </S>",
    "<S> , the superconductivity suppresses as superconducting pairs are broken by the injection of the nonequilibrium quasiparticles into a superconductor . in our study with the injection of a spin - polarized current into a superconducting wire through the f / s interface , </S>",
    "<S> the superconductivity was more effectively suppressed as the time - reversal symmetry of the superconducting pairs in the singlet state was easily broken in the nonequilibrium state . </S>",
    "<S> we estimated the spin - diffusion length @xmath5 from the finite voltages revealed in the al wire for a bias below the onset current of superconductivity ( for convenience we assign this as the superconducting critical current ) , which itself was reduced by the weakened superconductivity due to spin - polarized current injection . the resulting spin - diffusion length saturated at temperatures far below @xmath0 but grew gradually with increasing temperature and tended to diverge near @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this result is consistent with the results of ref . </S>",
    "<S> 19 but is in contradiction to the results of refs . 20 - 22 . </S>",
    "<S> the detailed temperature dependence of @xmath5 in our study indicated that the spin relaxation in a superconductor was related to the condensation of quasiparticle pairs in two opposite spin channels into superconducting electron pairs at the fermi level .    </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) schematic geometry of the samples . </S>",
    "<S> sem micrographs of ( b ) the sample a and ( c ) the sample b.,width=8 ]    specimens were fabricated using a combination of electron - beam ( e - beam ) lithography , e - beam and/or thermal evaporation , ar - ion etching , and lift - off techniques . </S>",
    "<S> si substrates covered with natural oxide layers were used . for f </S>",
    "<S> / s hybrid samples ( the samples @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) ferromagnetic wires designed to form in a single - domain structure@xcite were made by the e - beam evaporation of 60@xmath865-nm - thick co films on patterned layers of e - beam resist and by lifting off subsequently to the width of about 250@xmath8270 nm . </S>",
    "<S> then about 80@xmath8130-nm - thick al layers for both samples with extended contact electrodes were thermally evaporated as superconducting wires on the second patterned resist and lifted off to the width of about 200 nm and 270 nm , respectively . </S>",

    "<S> 1(b ) ] this lead was not used in the measurements . the voltage drop in the segment which is closest to the interface </S>",
    "<S> ( the segment one ) , @xmath12 , shows much smeared characteristics below the onset of the superconducting transition @xmath0 than those in other segments ( the segments two and six ) such as @xmath13 or @xmath15 in the figure . the voltage drops @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 over other segments showed behavior ( not illustrated in the figures ) very similar to @xmath13 with a few @xmath9 deviation of the onset temperatures of zero resistance . </S>",
    "<S> the finite resistance corresponding to @xmath12 in the segment one below the onset of the superconducting transition is most likely to be due to weakening of the superconductivity in the al wire by the spin - polarization - induced pair breaking . </S>",
    "<S> the open - circle symbols are the data with the current bias of 1 @xmath20a for the spin - degenerate bias configuration over the segment one , where the voltage drop for the unpolarized spin injection is almost identical to that for the case of the spin injection . </S>",
    "<S> this fact indicates that the nonequilibrium effect of quasiparticle injection is supposed to be minimal for this low bias level .    on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the identical results between the two bias configurations imply that , even for this quasi - equilibrium situation in the low spin - degenerate bias current , pair breaking comparable to the level for corresponding spin injection takes place . </S>",
    "<S> random interdiffusion of conduction electrons even without an external bias current can take place crossing the interface . </S>",
    "<S> this , in turn , induces spin accumulation in the al wire near the interface , because the spin population of the two opposite polarities is imbalanced in the ferromagnetic co wire . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting spin acculmulation in the superconducting al wire induces the pair breaking and causes the finite resistance below the bulk transition temperature @xmath0 of al . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the finite resistance below @xmath0 of the al wire is not due to the bias - induced pair breaking but is due to the self spin injection near the interface . </S>",
    "<S> this is similar to the  self injection \" effect as discussed in ref . </S>",
    "<S> 27 . </S>",
    "<S> the difference in the normal - state resistance for different segments resulted from the variation in the length as well as in the width of segments . </S>",
    "<S> the unusual peak in the resistance corresponding to @xmath12 is presumably due to nonuniform current distribution at the junction as the al electrode became superconducting . </S>",
    "<S> this peak feature appeared even in the au / al junction of the sample c.    as illustrated in the inset of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 similar behavior was observed in the wire resistance @xmath36 temperature of the sample @xmath7 for the segments represented by @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath42 . for the sample @xmath7 </S>",
    "<S> also the open - circle data corresponding to @xmath12 for the spin - degenerate bias configuration are almost the same as those for the spin injection configuration . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates again that the bias level of 1 @xmath20a used to determine the temperature dependence of resistance of the sample @xmath7 was low enough so that the equilibrium electron state in the al wire was not disturbed even for the spin - injection bias configuration . </S>",
    "<S> the spatial dependence of the resistance in fig . </S>",

    "<S> in contrast , the transition of the segment one is much smeared with a significantly reduced critical current . </S>",
    "<S> the appearance of the clear finite resistance in the segment one below its critical current is due to the pair breaking by the spin injection . as observed in the resistive - transition data in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 , the spatial variation of the @xmath11 curve also indicates that the spin injection effect decays within the range comparable to the length of the segment one of superconducting al wire .    in the inset of fig . </S>",

    "<S> 5 clearly contrasts with the @xmath11 characteristics of the segment one of the sample @xmath6 measured at 0.1 k between the two different configurations : the grey curve shows the characteristics for the spin - injection configuration and the black curve is the one without spin injection . for the spin - injection configuration the @xmath11 curve </S>",

    "<S> the slightly peaked feature in the voltage near the critical current above the normal - state value in the spin - injection configuration is not well understood . </S>",

    "<S> but , at the same time , the ratio between the two resistance values increases with increasing the interfacial resistance . </S>",
    "<S> we suppose the two competing factors kept the spin - injection efficiency high enough in our systems of finite interfacial resistance close to 2.4 @xmath25 . a quantitative estimate of the spin - injection rate , however , is not available because the first - principle calculation of the interfacial polarization with spin - flip scattering is not available .    in conclusion </S>",

    "<S> the suppression , as evidenced by the occurrence of finite voltages for the bias - current range below the superconducting onset , was pronounced when the spin - polarized currents were injected through the co / al interfaces . </S>",
    "<S> the finite voltages in the samples with transparent interfaces of low interfacial resistances are attributed to the dynamic pair breaking by the quasiparticles with the imbalanced spin population . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature dependence of the spin diffusion length in a superconductor , estimated from the finite voltages over a certain length of al wire near the interface , suggests that the spin diffusion in the superconductor is governed by the pair condensation of quasiparticles through opposite spin channels . since the pair condensation depopulates the spin - balanced quasiparticles more efficient spin flip can take place , via the spin - orbit interaction , in the superconducting state than in the normal state , making the spin diffusion length , in general , shorter in the superconducting state . </S>"
