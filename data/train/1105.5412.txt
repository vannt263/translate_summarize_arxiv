    "iron - based superconductors ( fesc ) have attracted intense attention since the discovery of superconductivity in lafeaso@xmath5f@xmath6 with t@xmath4 of 26 k. @xcite a central topic of the studies is to understand the mechanism behind superconductivity .",
    "since the electron - phonon coupling strength was proved to be insufficient to explain the relative high t@xmath4 both theoretically and experimentally , @xcite spin fluctuations are expected as an alternative candidate for the pairing glue . therefore understanding the magnetic behavior of the parent compounds",
    "is urgently needed .",
    "unexpectedly , the parent compounds of fesc exhibit a wide variety of magnetic properties despite their similar crystal structures . the undoped compounds are antiferromagnetic metals with the moments ordered in stripes , i.e. ferromagnetically between the nearest fe neighbors in one direction ( x ) and antiferromagnetically in the other ( y ) .",
    "the moment of the 1111 compounds rfeaso ( r = rare earth ) is @xmath1 0.3 - 0.8 @xmath2 .",
    "@xcite in the 122 compounds afe@xmath7as@xmath7 ( a = ca , sr ,",
    "ba , eu ) it is @xmath1 0.8 - 1.0 @xmath2 , @xcite whereas in the 111 family the moment is only @xmath1 0.09 @xmath2 in nafeas @xcite and could not be observed in lifeas .",
    "@xcite in the 11 family , no local moment is found in fese , @xcite while fete has a unique magnetic structure , a so called double - stripe order , with a fairly big moment @xmath1 2.0 @xmath2 .",
    "@xcite this spread in magnetic moments is difficult to understand since the parent compounds have very similar lattice structures ; they all have similar fex ( x = as , se , te ) layers , and density functional theory ( dft ) calculations give quite similar paramagnetic band structures for all the materials .",
    "@xcite    it is conceivable that theoretical studies may clarify this puzzle .",
    "dft with the local spin density approximation ( lsda ) or the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) successfully reproduced the single - stripe antiferromagnetic ( afm ) order in 1111 and 122 materials .",
    "@xcite however the calculated magnetic moment is about 1.5 - 2 @xmath2 , which is much larger than the measured magnetic moment .",
    "many theories have been proposed to explain the outstanding discrepancy between dft and experiment .",
    "yildirim applied a fixed - spin - moment calculation to lafeaso and found the ground state with a moment of @xmath8 @xmath2 .",
    "@xcite nakamura @xmath9 @xmath10 . applied the lsda+u approach to lafeaso@xmath5f@xmath6 and reproduced the experimental moment with a @xmath11 u. @xcite mazin and johannes argued that the small moment is due to the presence of antiphase boundaries .",
    "@xcite bascones @xmath9 @xmath10 . presented a five - band model and found a low moment state characterized by anti - parallel orbital magnetic moments .",
    "@xcite however , it is still not clear which picture is more realistic .",
    "in this work , we present an lsda+@xmath0 study to explain the puzzle of magnetism in fesc .",
    "we show that the measured small magnetic moment can be reproduced with @xmath12 @xmath0 , and its origin is a coulomb - enhanced orbital hybridization between antiferromagnetic neighbors .",
    "since the iron compounds are weak to moderately correlated systems , @xcite the around - mean - field ( amf ) functional @xcite is employed in this work .",

    "@xcite we concentrate on the 1111 material lafeaso and use the experimental lattice structure @xcite with the space group p4/nmm , a=4.035  , c=8.7409  , z@xmath13=0.1415 and z@xmath14=0.6415 . to study the single - stripe afm order , we use the @xmath15 supercell containing 4 iron atoms .",
    "144 k points are used within irreducible brillouin zone .",
    "the muffin - tin sphere radii of 2.24 , 2.28 , 2.02 and 1.98 a@xmath16 are used for la , fe , as and o , respectively .",

    "we used two values for the hund s coupling , @xmath17=0 and @xmath17=0.82 ev , the latter having been obtained from an x - ray experiment .",
    "@xcite surprisingly , two kinds of low moment ( lm ) in addition to one high moment ( hm ) solutions are found in our calculations .",
    "the hm state was expected since the lsda+@xmath0 is usually believed to have a tendency to enhance the magnetic moment .",
    "the two lm states have the magnetic moments m@xmath11.0 @xmath2 ( lm1 ) and m@xmath10.4 @xmath2 ( lm2 ) , which are in good agreement with the measured moments in the 122 compounds and in most of the 1111 compounds , respectively .",
    "we did the same calculation for the 122 materials bafe@xmath7as@xmath7 , and also found two lm states , very similar to lafeaso .    as shown in fig .",
    "1a and 1b , the lm1 state only exists within a certain @xmath0 range , and it can jump to the hm or lm2 states with a discontinuous change of the magnetic moment when @xmath0 decreases or increases .",
    "the lm2 state requires larger @xmath0 and shows slight variation in moment when @xmath0 is increasing .",
    "fig . 1c and",

    "the figure shows that a small @xmath0 favors the hm state and a large @xmath0 favors the lm2 state .",

    "pressure experiments have shown that the fe - as bond length is very rigid while the fe - fe distance shrinks much faster when pressure increases , @xcite i.e. , @xmath58 increased by pressure .",

    "then our explanation for the high - pressure experiments is also suitable for the 122 materials .",
    "importantly , in this picture , the suppression of magnetism is because the orbital spin - moments cancel each other .",

    "<S> finally , our theory suggests that the superconducting phase is an orbital - spin ordered state , where the orbital spin - moments cancel each other . </S>"
