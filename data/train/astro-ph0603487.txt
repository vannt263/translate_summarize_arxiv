    "a great deal of effort has been invested during the last couple of decades in understanding the large - scale structure formation in the universe . while a substantial progress has been made in following the hierarchical buildup of dark matter ( dm ) halos , the structure development on subgalactic scales , such as the growth of disks , bulges , central black holes , etc . , is only now being investigated . in this paper",
    "we study the buildup of stellar disks immersed in evolving dm halos of an arbitrary shape obtained in cosmological simulations and the concurrent symbiotic evolution of the disk - halo system .",
    "specifically , we analyze the change in the halo triaxiality to the growing disk and its feedback onto the disk evolution .    beyond the active and passive adjustments of the halo to the growing disk and _ vice versa _ ,",
    "the disk is prone to a number of dynamical instabilities , such as the bar instability , which can alter the evolution of the system in the most profound way .",
    "a strong and massive stellar bar will facilitate the angular momentum and mass redistribution within the disk and between the disk and the halo ( e.g. , athanassoula 2003 ) .",
    "the efficiency of this process is not yet fully understood but is known to depend on a number of parameters such as the dispersion velocities in the halo , its mass concentration , etc .",
    "first , from the most general dynamical considerations , the coupled dynamical evolution of a disk - halo system is expected to depend on the prevailing shape of the dm halo and its embedded disk as well as on the ability of the disk to develop a strong stellar bar . while dm halos form on the average as highly triaxial ( i.e. , prolate and flat ) systems in cosmological numerical simulations ( e.g. , bullock 2002 for a review ) , they appear nearly axisymmetric ( i.e. , oblate ) in the local universe ( e.g. , rix & zaritsky 1995 ; merrifield 2002 ) .",
    "what process(es ) drive this axisymmetrization of the halo ?",
    "second , the halo radial density profile can have an effect on its coupling to the growing disk , especially on the efficiency of the angular momentum transfer to the halo .",
    "it was argued that cuspy halos ( i.e. , navarro , frenk & white 1997 , hereafter nfw ) provide a substantial drag on the stellar bars ( e.g. , weinberg 1985 ; but see sellwood 2006 ) and the feedback is capable of leveling off the density cusp ( weinberg & katz 2002 ; holley - bockelmann , weinberg & katz 2005 ) , although this latest point is a matter of controversy ( sellwood 2003 ; mcmillan & dehnen 2005 ) .",
    "baryons have been shown to modify both the radial density profile and the triaxiality of the dm halo  dumping baryons within the halo dilutes the triaxial potential ( dubinski 1994 ; kazantzidis et al .",
    "2004 ) and clumpy baryons can level off the density cusp ( el - zant , shlosman & hoffman 2001 ) . however , the halo triaxiality ( at each radius ) can also decrease during the violent phases of major mergers as they come from random directions and during the quiescent phases of slow accretion ( outside the halo cusp )  this type of halo evolution is actually implemented in the current work .",
    "the fraction of stellar bars at cosmological distances is of course an interesting parameter which can provide us with clues to the evolution of galaxies over the hubble time .",
    "the original claim that the observed bar fraction decreases sharply over redshifts @xmath2 ( abraham et al .",
    "1999 ) has been questioned first because of the specific method of bar detection used in this work ( jogee et al .",
    "2002a , b ) . more broadly ,",
    "analysis of the _ hst _ gems survey of about 1,600 galaxies has shown that the fraction of strong bars in the optical stays unchanged to @xmath3 , i.e. , lookback time of 8  gyr ( jogee et al .",
    "2004 ) , which was confirmed for much smaller samples ( sheth et al . 2003 ; elmegreen et al . 2004 ) .",
    "moreover , jogee et al . have concluded that the distributions of bar lengths and their axial ratios is largely preserved as well  with a corollary for disk and dm halo properties .",
    "overall , this means that since @xmath3 at least , the galaxy evolution is probably not driven by major mergers but entered the quiescent phase .",
    "this result can be coupled to a more general issue of the dm halo shape evolution .",
    "el - zant & shlosman ( 2002 ) used the method of liapunov exponents to calculate the fate of bars in mildly triaxial _",
    "rigid _ halos .",
    "they found that the bars can not be sustained in these configurations due to the generated chaos .",
    "berentzen , shlosman & jogee ( 2006 ) have extended this work to include the self - consistent models with live triaxial halos , i.e. , flat and prolate . and @xmath4 , respectively , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the halo principal axes . ] in all cases , bars which formed as the initial disk response to the halo prolateness have dissolved over @xmath7  gyr timescale , i.e. , few bar rotations .",
    "the series of models with increasing cuspiness in the halo have shown that the chaos generated by bars tumbling in triaxial halos can also wash out the halo prolateness and thus the bar may survive .",
    "but it remained unclear whether the decrease in the halo triaxiality detected by berentzen et al .",
    "is related to the halo relaxation because of the insertion of a massive axisymmetric disk or it is the result of the response in the disk to the halo asymmetry .",
    "our present work provides a compelling answer to this question .",
    "the disk formation within a dm halo has been studied before under a long list of simplifying assumptions ( e.g. , sommer - larsen et al .",
    "2003 ; immeli et al . 2004",
    "; governato et al .",
    "here we focus on the disk - halo interaction and its effects on the developing disk morphology and the feedback onto the halo shape .",
    "to follow the disk - halo evolution in a more realistic environment , we monitor the halo assembly in the cosmological framework starting with a @xmath8 linear perturbation in the expanding universe , using the constrained realizations algorithm ( hoffman & ribak 1991 ) to prescribe the initial conditions .",
    "we insert a small ` seed ' stellar disk of about 10% of its final mass within the halo which experiences a quiescent phase of its dynamical evolution .",
    "the disk then grows substantially in size and in mass via self - similar mass addition over time periods of @xmath1  gyr .",
    "we analyze the subsequent evolution of such a disk - halo system and provide a comparison with simplified versions of this system . those include isolated , axisymmetric and triaxial halos with non - evolving light and massive disks .    this paper is structured as following : section  2 deals with the details of numerical modeling .",
    "results are given in section  3 and discussed in section  4 .",
    "we have used the updated version ftm-4.4 of our hybrid code ( e.g. , heller & shlosman 1994 ; heller 1995 ) with the total @xmath9 particles , of which 1.2 m represent the collisionless dm and 100k  the collisionless baryonic components , respectively .",
    "the gravitational forces have been computed using dehnen s ( 2002 ) falcon force solver , a tree code with mutual cell - cell interactions and complexity _ o(n)_. it conserves momentum exactly and is about 10 times faster than optimally coded barnes & hut ( 1986 ) tree code .",
    "the gravitational softening of 200  pc to simulate both the evolution of the dm component and that of the baryons in the disk has been implemented .",
    "we have introduced the following dimensionless model units .",
    "the spatial distance unit is taken as @xmath10kpc , the mass unit is @xmath11 and the gravitational constant is chosen to be @xmath12 , which results in a time unit of @xmath13yrs .",
    "the dynamical timescale , @xmath14 within 10  kpc is @xmath15  yr for the pure dm halo . in these units ,",
    "the velocity is given in @xmath16 .",
    "the actual physical units are mostly used here .",
    "we have used the constrained realizations technique ( hoffman & ribak 1991 ; see section  2.1.1 below ) to construct a dm halo , and followed its assembly in the expanding friedmann universe . at redshift @xmath0 , we have introduced a live ` seed ' stellar disk into the halo and grew it over the next @xmath1  gyr , depending on the model .",
    "vacuum boundary conditions and physical coordinates have been used ignoring the cosmological constant term and assuming the open cdm ( ocdm ) model with @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 . here",
    "@xmath20 is the current cosmological density parameter , @xmath21 is the hubble constant normalized by 100  km  @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is the variance of the density field convolved with a top - hat window of radius @xmath24  mpc used to normalize the power spectrum ( see also romano - diaz et al . 2006a , b ) .",
    "because we are interested in the evolution on the sub - galactic scales , the difference with the @xmath25cdm cosmology is small and our results should also stand for the latter .",
    "the ftm-4.4 has been tested in the cosmological context using the santa barbara cluster model ( frenk et al .",
    "further details are given in romano - diaz et al .",
    "( 2006b ) .      the constrained realizations algorithm ( hoffman & ribak 1991 ) was used by applying linear constraints to specify the initial density field in specified locations and evaluated with gaussian smoothing kernels .",
    "the width of a kernel has been fixed and corresponds to the mass scale on which the constraint has been imposed . within the context of the cosmological model and assuming the power spectrum of the primordial perturbation field , we have generated a constrained realization of the density field from a random realization of this field .",
    "the simulations start at redshift @xmath26 , corresponding to @xmath27gyr , and ends at @xmath28 .",
    "the dm model has been constructed in such a way as to have a set of constraints all located at the origin .",
    "the corresponding nested set of perturbations has been designed to collapse off - center .",
    "these density constraints constitute @xmath29 perturbations , where @xmath30 is the variance of the smoothed field , which were imposed on @xmath31 cubic grid with a side of @xmath32  mpc .",
    "the total mass of the dm is @xmath33m@xmath34 and it is embedded in a region corresponding to a mass of @xmath35m@xmath34 in which the overdensity is zero of unperturbed friedmann model .",
    "the three nested off - center perturbations of @xmath36 , 4.6 and 3.4 , corresponding to the mass scale of @xmath37m@xmath34 , @xmath38m@xmath34 and @xmath39m@xmath34 , are designed to collapse by @xmath40 3.8 and 2.2 , respectively . over the time of the simulation , the density field",
    "has been sampled with 5001,000 time outputs .    for the reference ,",
    "the halo mass within @xmath41 kpc is about @xmath42 ( or 165k particles ) , from @xmath43 , or @xmath44 ( just prior to the seed disk insertion ) to the end of the evolution at @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "this is about two orders of magnitude above the halo sampling in cosmological simulations .",
    "the initial ` seed ' disk is a miyamoto - nagai ( 1975 ) disk described by the gravitational potential : @xmath47 where the scalelengths @xmath48 and @xmath49 , and the disk mass @xmath50 are given in table  1 . to include the stellar disk in our models",
    ", we first determine the main principal axes of the triaxial halo , based on its moments of inertia .",
    "we then introduce the disk with its rotation axis being aligned with the halo minor axis .",
    "as we show in section  3.1 , the halo figure is nearly stagnant over the hubble time .",
    "the disk is placed with the center of mass position and velocities of the main halo , iteratively measured in spheres with radii going from @xmath51kpc down to @xmath52kpc .",
    "since the halo is not in equilibrium and the initial disk mass is negligible compared to that of the halo , we do not require the halo to relax on the introduced potential .",
    "the disk is inserted at a redshift @xmath0 , well after the last major merger ( see section  3 ) .      to simulate the process of disk formation in a simplified way ,",
    "the disk is gradually grown from the seed , by adding stellar particles to it , based on the probability given by the miyamoto - nagai density distribution .",
    "the central volume density of the disk is kept constant during this time period , and we adjust ( i.e. , increase ) the radial and vertical scalelengths of the disk correspondingly , keeping the ratio @xmath53 constant .",
    "recent analysis of the gems galaxies supports such a disk buildup , when the surface density does ( nearly ) not change with redshift while the disk mass increases with time ( barden et al . 2005 ) .    since the equatorial plane of the disk may change owing to a ( slow ) inner halo figure tumbling in 3-d , we determine the instantaneous disk plane from its moments of inertia . then , based on the radial force component at the position of the new particles , we assign the corresponding circular velocity ( without any additional dispersion or @xmath54-velocity component ( relative to the disk equatorial plane ) .",
    "this method , strictly speaking , does not grow the disk under exact equilibrium conditions , but we do not expect this in a realistic disk formation either , i.e. , most likely it involves some degree of relaxation as well .",
    "we impose a linear mass growth over a specified time period , starting with redshift @xmath0 ( see table  2 ) .",
    "overall , the disk mass grows by a factor of ten over @xmath55  gyr or @xmath56  gyr , which corresponds approximately to @xmath57 and 60 . because the disk center - of - mass position and the 3-d orientation of the disk depend on the large - scale motions within the surrounding halo and on the streamers on even larger scale in the dm , we have developed a new diagnostics to address the evolution of disk intrinsic parameters , such as the bar pattern speed .",

    "it is important that the inner halo remains prolate and in a quasi - steady state in this pure halo model .    in fig .",
    "[ plot4 ] we display four snapshots of the halo volume density along its principal axes at different redshifts .",
    "these axes have been determined using moments of inertia .",
    "we also show the radial profiles of halo prolateness and flatness . at @xmath91 ( or @xmath92",
    "gyr )  the time of the seed disk insertion , the halo is prolate , with @xmath93 just below 0.3 at the center , decreasing to below @xmath77 outside @xmath94kpc .",
    "by @xmath95 , the halo prolateness is largely washed out outside the inner 25  kpc , while halo flatness remains significant everywhere .",
    "this detail is important for understanding the evolution of disks immersed in the halo , specifically for the bar instability  the _ outer _ halo becomes largely axisymmetric in a couple of gyrs after @xmath72 .",
    "this happens because of the slow accretion of the dm in the absence of the large - scale tidal torques .",
    "however , it is important that the _ inner _ halo , within the central 20  kpc , remains significantly prolate and hence will interact specifically with the immersed disk .",
    "next , we compare the halo evolution when the disk is immersed in a number of different ways . the first possibility is when a _ seed _ disk is introduced either abruptly or more adiabatically at @xmath0 .",
    "the mass of the seed disk is small , 10% of its final mass and smaller than the halo mass within the disk radius by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "the disk grows to its final mass within @xmath55  gyr , i.e. , @xmath96 or in a less intrusive way over a longer period of time , @xmath56  gyr , i.e. , @xmath97 . to verify that an abrupt positioning of the disk within the halo does not produce any visible effects on the halo evolution , even more adiabatic insertion of the seed disk",
    "is performed as follows .",
    "the disk is brought up gradually over @xmath98 or 20 , keeping the disk particle positions frozen , but correcting for the disk center - of - mass with respect to the halo . in these test models ,",
    "the disk reaches its _ seed _ mass always at @xmath0 ( @xmath43 ) . at this moment",
    "we unfreeze the particles and grow the disk tenfold thereafter .",
    "we perform a number of tests where the basic halo parameters are compared between the models ( see tables  1 and 2 ) .",
    "we note that the outer part of the halo itself is not in a virial equilibrium , and that the seed disk is dominated completely by the halo mass at all radii .",
    "the major parameters we are concerned with are the halo flatness , @xmath99 , and especially its prolateness , @xmath93 .",
    "we have run a number of test models in order to understand to what degree the subsequent evolution of the halo shape depends upon the method of disk insertion .",
    "we started to bring up the frozen seed disk at @xmath100 ( @xmath101  gyr ) over the time of 0.47  gyr and at @xmath102 ( @xmath103  gyr ) over the time of 0.94  gyr .",
    "so by @xmath0 , the halo feels the full seed disk potential , and the disk starts to grow tenfold .",
    "in all cases the model is evolved for more than 4  gyr thereafter .",
    "we find that various tracks , displaying the host halo prolateness and flatness in these test models , are nearly identical up to @xmath72 , when the disk evolution takes over and the curves separate .",
    "this means that the diverging evolution we observe in some of the models is not the result of the halo response to the disk insertion but of other factors , such as the disk evolution , discussed in the next sections .",
    "before we discuss in detail the evolution of the key models , we show the halo response to the disk for the few most relevant cases : model a5 ( a non - growing disk ) , model a1 ( a standard seed disk growing tenfold ) , model a4 ( same as a1 but a disk growing over 3  gyr ) , model b1 ( a seed disk growing to a massive disk ) , and model a1b ( identical to a1 , but the disk is growing and remaining in the frozen state ) . fig .",

    "this model loses all of its initial prolateness in the inner halo over the first @xmath55  gyr .",
    "the model a1 loses most of its prolateness as well , while a4 mimics its evolution with a somewhat more prolate and flat halo .",
    "interestingly , the model a1b with the frozen growing disk has a small but measurably larger impact on the halo shape than the live a1 disk  to be discussed in section  4 .",
    "the model a5 with a non - growing seed disk leads to a much smaller decrease in @xmath93 .",
    "the pure dm halo model a0 is losing less than 20% of its initial prolateness over the first 1.5  gyr after @xmath0 , i.e. , almost three times less than the a1 .",
    "it experiences almost no change in the flatness .",
    "note , not only the mass is added in a growing disk but also angular momentum , as the new particles possess the maximal allowed @xmath58 at the radii of their insertion .    .3truein    the rotation curves for models a5 , a1 and b1 shown in fig .",
    "[ plot1aa ] correspond to the time when the disk reaches its maximal mass .",
    "the dynamical importance of the disk grows along this sequence  while a5 is halo - dominated at all radii , b1 hosts a _ maximal _ disk , in the sense of dominating the mass of the inner region .",
    "we note that the halo mass is dragged inward in our models because the disks are inserted nearly adiabatically and initially have a negligible mass compared to that of the halo within the same radius .",
    "this increase in the halo s central mass concentration is an artifact , because of the lack of clumpy baryons in our simulations , and leads to an overall increase in the halo cuspiness .      in",
    "the _ initial _ response of the seed disk to the triaxial halo , a bar - like structure forms immediately and fully dissolves @xmath55gyr later . at the dissolution time",
    ", the disk has already reached its full mass .",
    "the halo triaxiality gets reduced significantly , compared to the pure dm model a0 , and the halo becomes essentially axisymmetric . because the disk insertion is quasi - adiabatic , the dm cusp is not destroyed but becomes even somewhat more pronounced , which is purely an artifact of our way of introducing the disk ( see section  3.2.1 ) .    following the dissolution of the original response to the prolate halo , the disk stays slightly oval for a prolonged period of time , in excess of @xmath55  gyr . for brevity , we define the disk as being barred when the amplitude of @xmath105 mode @xmath106 , in all models . using this convention ,",
    "the bar in a1 re - appears at @xmath107  gyr , this time as a result of a dynamical bar instability .",

    "the pattern speed of the @xmath105 disturbance in the disk is very low initially , but when the bar re - appears , it is @xmath110 .",
    "this change can be explained by the small initial central mass concentration in the model . on the other hand ,",
    "the fully grown disk adds substantially to the central mass and , in addition , drags some of the dm inward due to the adiabatic way of insertion .",
    "the bar in a1 reaches its full strength and size only after the vertical buckling , @xmath111 , but the full disk is in place by @xmath95 .",
    "what is the reason for this delay of @xmath107  gyr , which is comparable to @xmath112 disk rotations within the bar - unstable region of 10  kpc ?",
    "typically , the strong bar appears after 2 - 3 disk rotations , e.g. , as in the axisymmetric models ls13 of berentzen et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , if @xmath113 is sufficiently large and the discreteness noise is relatively low .",
    "we return to this issue in section  4 .",
    "the initial halo prolateness triggers a response in the disk , with an amplitude , @xmath114 , comparable to the halo s @xmath105 amplitude , i.e. , to the degree of its prolateness .",
    "this response in the disk has a position angle which is normal to that of the halo major axis and basically represents an oval distortion in the inner disk .",
    "both modes , in the disk and the halo , are stagnant , because the halo s spin is negligible , and fade away with time . also , we detect a long - lived spiral structure in the outer disk , in this and other prolate models , which was also noted by berentzen et al .",
    "the existence of this spirals in a purely collisionless disk within a prolate halo is in a sharp contrast with the disk evolution in axisymmetric models .    as the disk becomes bar unstable",
    ", we observe that this bar always excites a ` ghost ' bar in the dm halo ( e.g. , athanassoula 2005 ) .",
    "this ghost bar is a gravitational wake in the halo and not a self - gravitating entity like an actual stellar bar .",
    "its shape differs from that of the stellar bar ",
    "it is much shorter and ` fatter ' in all axial ratios .",
    "the ghost bar would dissolve abruptly if the stellar bar would disappear .",

    "the @xmath114 amplitude ( i.e. , prolateness ) in the halo decays initially .",
    "the halo ghost bar develops alongside the stellar bar , experiences a sharp drop in the amplitude during the stellar bar buckling , and resumes its secular growth subsequently .",
    "the evolution of the pattern speed of the disk bar differs in this model from that of a1 as well .",
    "the stellar bar appears tumbling dramatically faster at @xmath117 .",
    "it decays strongly over the evolution time of this model .",
    "this behavior characterizes an efficient @xmath58-transfer from the disk to the dm halo over the first 6  gyr of the bar life and a nearly complete absence of such an interaction in the next 3  gyr .",
    "furthermore , the bar size follows its @xmath114 variation on the average .",
    "the bar grows rapidly to above 7  kpc at @xmath118  gyr , then drops to @xmath119  kpc over the next gyr .",
    "interestingly , this drop corresponds to the sudden change in the bar growth ( see above ) and is clearly visible in fig .",
    "[ plot1a ] . for the rest of the evolution ,",
    "the bar size stabilizes and decays very slowly in the 89  kpc range .",
    "all three major characteristics of the bar , namely its tumbling rate , bar strength and size , correlate  all remain nearly constant over a prolonged period of time .      for a comparison",

    "we take a ` snapshot ' of a0 at @xmath91 and redistribute the particles azimuthally in the random fashion .",
    "we kept the original planar radius of particles unchanged and maintained the halo flattening .",
    "afterwards we have truncated the halo at @xmath120kpc .",
    "we have added the disk to the model and relaxed it for @xmath121 .",
    "finally , we have assigned velocities in the disk based on the new axisymmetric halo particle distribution .",
    "naturally , the seed disk - halo system is in dynamical equilibrium at the time of insertion , hence no initial disk response to the halo is expected ( and observed ) . the bar starts to grow in @xmath55  gyr and buckles subsequently , then resumes its growth which saturates secularly ( fig .",
    "[ plot1a ] ) .",
    "the ghost bar behaves similarly and weakens during the stellar bar buckling , with the follow up growth .",
    "the stellar bar size grows substantially over the period of @xmath122  gyr . at the buckling time",
    ", the bar size stabilizes around 6  kpc and then experiences a very shallow secular increase to @xmath123  kpc , dropping 0.5 kpc at the end of the evolution .      in this model",
    "we grow the disk over 3  gyr after its insertion .",
    "the initial response in the disk is the same as in a1 and so is the final structure of all components ( disk , bar and the halo ) .",
    "the halo triaxial shape is similar as well , with its prolateness remaining slightly larger than in a1 ( fig .  5 ) .",
    "the ( initial ) halo prolateness is correspondingly more long - lived .",
    "the main difference between a4 and a1 is that the stellar bar starts to form @xmath122  gyr later ( fig .",
    "[ plot1a ] )  which is consistent with the similarly slower disk growth in this model .",
    "we relate this delay in the bar growth to a protracted addition of the angular momentum ( @xmath58 ) to the disk , as the particles are added with the maximal @xmath58 at each energy . to test this",
    ", we have run a model with lower @xmath58 per added particle , model a6 below .      in order to decrease the angular momentum of the newly added particles to the growing disk ( see model a4 ) , we have re - run the a1 by assigning only 85% of the circular velocity for the new particles .",
    "the particles have been added only along the major axis of the disk ( determined from the moment of inertia ) in order to provide some degree of azimuthal coherency to the growing disk .",
    "it seems that the disk in a6 is more centrally concentrated than in a1 because of the large radial excursions of newly added particles with less than maximal @xmath58 .",
    "the resulting disk evolution differs from that of a1 and a4 ( fig .",
    "[ plot1a ] ) .",
    "the stellar bar appears much earlier at @xmath56  gyr and its nonlinear growth rate is much higher . as a result ,",
    "the stellar bar buckles substantially earlier than in a1 .",
    "however , asymptotically its evolution converges to that of a1 , both in strength and in pattern speed .",
    "the corresponding initial halo response decays faster as well and the ghost bar strengthens in tandem with the secular growth of the stellar bar .",
    "hence , addition of particles on the lower angular momentum orbits triggers the bar instability with a higher growth rate , which appears to be sensitive to the relatively mild removal of @xmath58 , only 15% , from the disk .",
    "in fact , in a6 , the stellar bar starts to form immediately after the initial disk response has been washed out ( fig .",
    "[ plot1a ] )  about 1  gyr earlier than in model a1 .",
    "this confirms our previous suggestion that our method of adding mass to the disk , i.e. , with maximal angular momentum at each radius acts as to delay the bar instability . to test this",
    ", we have run the c6 model , which differs form a6 only by having an axisymmetric halo .",
    "we shall return to this issue in section  4 .",
    "instead of giving the newly added particles _ vertical _ positions based on the miyamoto - nagai distribution function , we have assigned their positions randomly , between @xmath124pc .",
    "this was done in order to make the growing disk colder and thus more susceptible to the bar instability .",
    "[ plot1a ] shows that the stellar bar appears somewhat earlier , grows faster , but asymptotically is weaker than in a1 .",
    "the halo shape is nearly identical to that of a1 .",
    "this model was run in order to test the disk response to the undiluted prolateness of the rigid halo potential .",
    "the disk shows a strong initial response which decays abruptly to some residual amplitude which is maintained by the halo prolateness .",
    "the disk grows as in a1 but no stellar bar appears over the hubble time of its evolution ( fig .",
    "[ plot1b ] ) .",
    "there can be a dual reason for this : either the mass of the disk is so small that the outer disk can not absorb enough of the angular momentum of the inner few kpc , or the actual bar instability is damped by the substantially triaxial halo , as argued by el - zant & shlosman ( 2002 ) and berentzen et al .",
    "we have ruled out the former possibility by evolving the same disk in a frozen axisymmetric halo  a strong bar has appeared in this case .",
    "hence this model confirms both the theoretical predictions and the previous live numerical simulations that the bar instability is strongly damped by the halo prolateness , especially in frozen halos which lack the ability to adjust and to wash out their asymmetry .",
    "we start with the default disk , as in the a1 model , but the seed disk does not grow . as in a1 , a bar - like feature forms due to the initial response to the triaxial halo and dissolves linearly with time . the residual @xmath114 amplitude both in the disk and in the dm halo have the same value ( fig .  [ plot1b ] ) and can be simply explained as driven by the halo prolateness . because the mass of the disk remains small compared to the halo mass within the same radius , the disk has no visible effect on the halo shape evolution , except that its insertion reduced the halo triaxiality somewhat , compared to the pure halo model a0 . but this effect is substantially smaller than for the growing disk in a1 .",
    "the model a5 , in fact , tests to what degree the seed disk affects the halo evolution .",
    "one can suggest , based on the evolution of the b1 , that the main reason for the difference in the bar growth is the initially more massive seed disk .",
    "however this is contradicted by the b5 model , where we use the same massive seed disk but keep its mass constant .",
    "overall impression of b5 is that it closely resembles the a5 model ( fig .",
    "[ plot1b ] ) . this test model , therefore , provides a strong argument that it is not the initial mass of the disk which is important but rather its final mass .      in all of the models ,",
    "bars appear to evolve only in axisymmetric halos or halos which lost their prolateness during the disk growth .",
    "the timescale of the disk growth has no effect on the resulting bar size : models a1 and a4 develop nearly identical bars with semimajor axis of @xmath125  kpc and a very similar history .",
    "axisymmetric disk in c1 leads to the same bar as in a1 , and so is the massive disk in b1 . the low angular momentum disk in a6 results in a somewhat smaller bar of @xmath126  kpc .",
    "this can be explained by a more centrally concentrated disk here .",
    "overall , the bar maximal size appears to be close to the dm cusp size @xmath127  kpc in a0 .",
    "the disk growth in our models leads to the increase in the central density .",
    "we find , however , that models that host stellar bars develop much larger central densities after the period of the bar instability .",
    "more massive disks growing adiabatically drag in the dm which results in substantially higher central densities , especially in b1 . therefore , unlike in berentzen et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , we find that the surface density in the current disks can be approximated by a single - exponential law plus a central ` bulge , ' instead of a double - exponential law .",
    "this ` bulge ' region corresponds to the axisymmetrized stellar bar part of the disk , and we refer here to the bulge only in the context of a density fitting .",
    "the surface density in the outer disk , beyond the bar , was fit with an exponential profile , @xmath128 , where @xmath129 is the normalization constant and @xmath130 is the disk exponential scalelength .",
    "the resulting exponential law has been extrapolated to the center and the excess surface density was considered as a bulge contribution .",
    "the bulge surface density then has been fit by the profile @xmath131 $ ] , where @xmath132the shape parameter corresponds to the pure exponential ( @xmath133 ) or de vaucouleurs ( @xmath134 ) profiles , @xmath135 is bulge s radial scalelength and @xmath136 its central density ( srsic 1968 ; binney & merrifield 1998 ) . for a1 , we find that @xmath137 during the entire simulation , and @xmath138  kpc when the full disk is in place .",
    "the scalelength @xmath135 increases somewhat to 2.7  kpc until the bar buckles at 5.9  gyr and then decreases secularly towards 2  kpc , due to the action of the bar which becomes more centrally concentrated after the buckling instability .",
    "the ratio @xmath139 changes , therefore , from @xmath140 at the buckling to @xmath107 at the end of the simulation .",
    "the exponential scalelength of the outer disk stays around 3.3  kpc after the disk stops growing .",
    "all disk models in our simulations have been permitted to move freely in response to the streamers in the assembling halo and interactions with halo substructure .",
    "we have detected that the disk plane in model a1 starts to tilt very slowly around an axis in its plane about 2  gyr after the disk insertion ( e.g. , animation sequence  2 ) and so in other models as well .",
    "this motion has a counterpart in the inner halo , within @xmath141  kpc and the equatorial planes of the disk and the halo remain aligned over all the length of the simulation .",
    "the reason for this motion in the halo lies in the streamers excited by the halo substructure . as a result",
    ", we typically do not detect a warping of the disk midplane , except for some short periods of time .",
    "the disk also does not precess for the same reason .",
    "hansen & stadel ( 2006 ) have claimed a correlation between the density slope of the dm halo , @xmath142 , and the anisotropy parameter , @xmath143 , where @xmath144 and @xmath145 are tangential and radial velocity dispersions in the dm .",
    "specifically , they propose a correlation @xmath146 over about three orders of magnitude in @xmath147 within the dm cusp , with an intrinsic scatter in @xmath148 of 0.05 , for slopes with @xmath149 .",
    "we have measured both @xmath150 and @xmath148 for two of our models , pure dm model a0 and our benchmark model a1 .",
    "our best fit for a0 halo is @xmath151 for a comparable range in @xmath147 ( fig .",
    "[ beta2 ] ) .",
    "the halo in a1 fits the same relation as in a0 .",
    "hence , we confirm the slope in the correlation proposed by hansen & stadel , but find the curve being significantly offset from their value .",
    "we have investigated the evolution of growing stellar disks within assembling asymmetric dm halos , by means of high - resolution @xmath113-body simulations .",
    "the halos have been constructed using constrained realizations in the linear regime and evolved from cosmological initial conditions .",
    "we have inserted the ` seed ' disks at the center of mass of the innermost halo , at the redshift @xmath0 , after the end of the violent ( merger ) phase in the halo evolution .",
    "the seed disks , with 10% of their final mass , have been grown over a period of @xmath152  gyr thereafter .",
    "these disks have been allowed to move freely within the halo in response to the interactions with the inner and outer substructure and with the streamers within the halo . for comparison",
    ", we have run additional models with more massive disks , non - growing disks , frozen disks , or disks in frozen halos , etc .",
    "our main result is that a growing disk is responsible for washing out the halo prolateness and , to a lesser degree , the halo flatness , over a period of time comparable to its growth .",
    "we find that _ massive _ disks which contribute more to the overall rotation curve in the system are more efficient in removing the prolateness in the halo .",
    "the halo figure rotation remains negligible during this process .    in a number of models displayed in fig .",
    "[ plot6 ] , we show that the halo shape is very sensitive to the final disk mass , while being reasonably independent of how the _ seed _ disk is introduced into the system  abruptly or quasi - adiabatically .",
    "the timescale of the subsequent growth of the disk mass has a small effect on the halo shape as well  such a halo remains slightly more triaxial ( model a4 ) .",
    "on the other hand , when the growing disk was kept frozen , the halo lost slightly more of its prolateness ( model a1b ) .",
    "this has happened because the disk was not able to adjust its shape to that of the surrounding halo in the latter case .",
    "the corollary is that the maximal disks most probably reside in nearly axisymmetric dm halos . on the other hand ,",
    "disks whose rotation remains halo - dominated at all radii have progressively smaller effect on the halo shapes and are expected to reside in somewhat diluted but prolate halos .",
    "consequently , we envisage that massive disks are prone to development of large - scale stellar bars ( unless additional adverse factors prevail ) , while light disks have the bar instability damped by the halo triaxiality .",
    "these corollaries from numerical simulations are complementary and bear interesting observational and evolutionary consequences for disk galaxies embedded in dm halos .",
    "previous theoretical study ( el - zant & shlosman 2002 ) and numerical simulations ( berentzen et al .",
    "2006 ) have argued that stellar bars and triaxial halos are incompatible , by - passing the issue of how such systems can form in the first place .",
    "dubinski ( 1994 ) has shown that growing an _ analytical _ spherical potential inside a triaxial halos will reduce the halo asymmetry but residual triaxiality will remain .",
    "kazantzidis et al . (",
    "2004 ) have used cosmological simulations of the dm and baryonic matter to show that cooling within the halos leads to more spherical halos than in adiabatic simulations .",
    "models presented here resolve the issue of bar - asymmetric halo incompatibility by showing explicitly that the growing disk is primarily responsible for erasing the halo prolateness and diluting its flatness , and that long - lived bars emerge only in models which become nearly axisymmetric .",
    "substantial differences in the subsequent evolution of disk models can be detected , depending on their growth history .",
    "this is clearly reflected in the growth rate of the bar instability .",
    "the bar formation is considerably delayed in a1 and proceeds slower in c1 compared to lower angular momentum disks in a6 ( fig .",
    "[ plot1a ] ) and c6 .",
    "the former disks have grown by a particle addition to the circular orbits , i.e. , with the maximal angular momentum @xmath58 for the particle orbital energy . as the bar growth is associated with the loss of @xmath58 from the unstable region , the addition of @xmath58 should in principle stabilize the disk , temporarily .",
    "this , however , does not explain why is it that the bar instability is postponed by a number of disk rotations after we stop adding mass to the disk in a1 but appears shortly thereafter in a6 .",
    "if this difference arises solely from the additional 15% of @xmath58 in a1 , one should observe the same delay in model c1 .",
    "however , a substantially smaller delay appears in the ( axisymmetric halo ) c1 .",
    "we note that the original halo prolateness is preserved for a longer period of time in a1 than in a6 , as the direct comparison of _ halo s _ @xmath105 amplitudes in fig .",
    "[ plot1a ] shows .",
    "one observes in this figure that the stellar bar starts to grow when the halo s @xmath114 amplitude drops below 0.1 , i.e. , small @xmath153  in tandem with calculations based on the liapunov exponents and in self - consistent @xmath113-body simulations of disk evolution in live triaxial halos ( el - zant & shlosman 2002 ; berentzen et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "we have run a test model ( c6 ) with an axisymmetric halo , as c1 , but where particles have been added with 85% of @xmath58 for the circular orbits  similarly to a6 .",
    "its stellar bar appears immediately after the disk has reached it final mass , by @xmath95 .",
    "what is evident is that , in both a6 and c6 models , the stellar bar pattern speed has a maximum which is clearly larger than in a1 and c1 .",
    "the simple explanation of this is that models with lower @xmath58 , a6 and c6 , are more centrally concentrated than the latter models and their central dynamical timescale is accordingly shorter .",
    "hence , at least in the linear stage , the growth rate of the dynamical instability is larger in a6 and c6 .",
    "it appears that a combination of an addition of @xmath58 and different central concentration govern the bar / disk evolution in the models described above .",
    "all models developing stellar bars also develop _ ghost _ bars in the halo that are nearly aligned with the disk bars .",
    "interaction between these bars is a major contributor to the slowdown of the stellar bar .",
    "the ghost bar acts as a gravitational wake and its orbital structure is fundamentally different from that of the stellar bar  in particular , the dm particles are _ not _ trapped within the ghost bar as they are within the stellar bar .",
    "ghost bars are sensitive enough to respond to the vertical buckling in the stellar bars and they grow in tandem with the stellar bars , as seen in fig .  [ plot1a ] .",
    "however , they should not be confused with the original halo prolateness which also contributes to the @xmath105 amplitude,@xmath114 , in the halo for the first few gyrs .",
    "we find that this latter contribution serves as a reliable indicator for the growth / decay of the stellar bars  those grow when halo s @xmath114 amplitude drops below 0.1 .",
    "the density profile in the disk can be fit by a single - exponential profile plus a central bulge which is somewhat steeper than an exponential .",
    "this differs from double - exponential disks that have developed in berentzen et al .",
    "( 2006 ) models .",
    "the reason for this difference appears to be the quasi - adiabatic insertion of the disk in the current work .",
    "this quiescent way of insertion drags in the dm , without destroying the central cusp .",
    "berentzen et al .",
    "( 1998 ) has found a similar bulge shape for pure collisionless models , which has been modified with the addition of the gas component in the disk .",
    "overall we find that disk - to - bulge scalelength ratio stays in the range of @xmath154 , while bar size - to - bulge scalelength ratio increases from about 1.9 to 4 . in all models ,",
    "the bar has been roughly confined to within the nfw scalelength @xmath155 .",
    "we find that the dm halo cusps are preserved in our numerical simulations , although the quality of the nfw fit is significantly degraded with the growth of the disks .",
    "the reason for this apparent robustness of the cusps lies in the quasi - adiabatic insertion of our seed disks which , in fact , reinforce the cusps by dragging in the dm .",
    "even in models with strong stellar bars , the cusps survive .",
    "it is possible that in reality they are destroyed by the accreting clumpy baryons ( e.g. , el - zant et al .",
    "2001 , 2004 ) or by other similar processes ( e.g. , tonini , lapi & salucci 2006 ) prior to the disk formation .",
    "this issue is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "we also did not address the possible effect that the halo cuspiness has on the halo s triaxiality ( e.g. , berentzen et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "how does the evolution of disk - halo systems described in this work fit within the broader issue of disk galaxy evolution within the cosmological context ?",
    "while numerical simulations have shown that halos form as prolate and flattened entities ( e.g. , bullock 2002 ) , they appear as nearly axisymmetric ( oblate ) in the local universe ( e.g. , merrifield 2002 ) . on the other hand , the high frequency of stellar bars in the local and intermediate redshift universe ( jogee et al .",
    "2004 ; elmegreen et al .",
    "2004 ; sheth et al .",
    "2003 ) poses a potential problem because bars and prolate halos are incompatible ( el - zant & shlosman 2002 ; berentzen et al .",
    "a process which washes out the halo prolateness , therefore , can be , in principle , responsible for the present high fraction of barred disks . for this to happen",
    ", the reduction of a halo triaxiality should be achieved _ quasi - adiabatically_. otherwise , a galactic disk will be heated up and stabilized against the bar formation for a prolonged period of time .",
    "major mergers and even frequent minor mergers can lead to such an ` over - heating ' of stellar disks .",
    "furthermore , the major mergers will typically destroy the disks .    a gradual buildup of a galactic disk within an initially _ a_symmetric dm halo can play the role of the required quasi - adiabatic process which resolves both issues at once , i.e. , the halo prolateness and the high observed bar fraction .",
    "jogee et al .",
    "( 2004 ) have argued in favor of such a quiescent disk evolution over the last 8  gyrs , based on the inferred optical fraction of bars and on the distribution of bar ellipticities and sizes over @xmath156 in recent gems survey with the _",
    "hst_. moreover , barden et al .",
    "( 2005 ) have shown that the disk mass grows faster with redshift than its surface density .",
    "this requires a gradual increase in the disk radial scalelength with @xmath54  a method implemented here to grow the seed disks .",
    "the scenario that emerges from this _ gradual _ buildup of disks within the triaxial dm halos , in principle , can explain the current population of stellar bars in disk galaxies . within this hierarchical merging framework ,",
    "the dm halos of arbitrary shapes form first during the major merger epoch .",
    "if disks form during this early stage , they are probably destroyed shortly thereafter .",
    "disks that grow during the next quiescent epoch can be responsible for the washing out of the halo prolateness and , to a lesser degree , its flatness .",
    "the efficiency of this process depends on the increasing disk - to - halo mass ratio .",
    "large - scale stellar bars will form under these conditions with a delay  first bars would form in systems with more massive disks and , therefore , more oblate halos . for lower redshifts , progressively more disk galaxies will be susceptible to an intrinsic ( spontaneous ) bar instability as contrasted by the tidally - induced bars .",
    "hence , bars which are observed in the local universe can still be the first generation which formed spontaneously after the host halo prolateness has been washed out . within this scenario ,",
    "the intrinsic bar formation is spread out in time .",
    "thus , the observed fraction of stellar bars , and distributions of their strength and sizes reflects a steady state between the newly forming bars in more axisymmetric halos and bars destroyed by various processes .",
    "the details of the above formation and destruction processes are still sufficiently unclear .",
    "for example , we do not know what is the characteristic timescale of a disk buildup .",
    "this work explores the range of @xmath152  gyrs , but , in principle , it can be much longer , @xmath157  gyrs , as hinted by the results from gems , and , therefore , can extend beyond @xmath95 .    to summarize ,",
    "we have developed a method to insert seed disks and to grow them subsequently in cosmologically evolving halos in a quasi - adiabatical way .",
    "we have investigated the response of the halo shape to the growing stellar disk and the feedback of the halo onto the subsequent evolution of this disk .",
    "we find that the growing disk dilutes the halo triaxiality depending on the final disk mass .",
