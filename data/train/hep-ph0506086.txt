    "the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking remains unknown .",
    "while the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics is consistent with existing data , theoretical considerations suggest that this theory is only a low - energy effective theory and must be supplanted by a more complete description of the underlying physics at energies above those reached so far by experiment .",
    "the cdf and d  experiments at the fermilab tevatron are currently searching for the higgs boson of the standard model . the production cross - section and decay branching fractions for this state have been predicted in great detail for the mass range accessible to tevatron run ii .",
    "search strategies have been carefully planned and optimized .",
    "however , if the tevatron does find evidence for a new scalar state , it may not necessarily be the standard higgs .",
    "many alternative models of electroweak symmetry breaking have spectra that include new scalar or pseudoscalar states whose masses could easily lie in the range to which run ii is sensitive .",
    "the new scalars tend to have cross - sections and branching fractions that differ from those of the sm higgs .",
    "the potential exists for one of these scalars to be more visible in a standard search than the sm higgs would be .    in this paper",
    "we discuss how to extract information about non - standard theories of electroweak symmetry breaking from searches for a light sm higgs at tevatron run ii and cern lhc .",
    "the idea of using standard higgs searches to place limits on new scalar states associated with electroweak symmetry breaking beyond the standard model has been applied to lep results ( see e.g. refs .",
    "the tevatron and lhc can potentially access significantly heavier scalars than those to which lep was sensitive , particularly in models of dynamical symmetry breaking . ref .",
    "@xcite studied the potential of tevatron run ii to augment its search for the sm higgs boson by considering the process @xmath2 . while this channel would not suffice as a sole discovery mode , in this channel alone ( assuming a mass in the range 120 - 140 gev ) would require an integrated luminosity of 14 - 32 fb@xmath3 , which is unlikely to be achieved . ]",
    "the authors found that it could usefully be combined with other channels such as @xmath4 or associated higgs production to enhance the overall visibility of the higgs . at the same time , the authors determined what additional enhancement of scalar production and branching rate , such as might be provided in a non - standard model like the mssm , would enable a scalar to become visible in the @xmath5 channel alone at tevatron run ii .",
    "similar work has been done for @xmath6 at the lhc  @xcite and for @xmath7 at the tevatron @xcite and lhc @xcite .",
    "our work builds on these results , considering an additional production mechanism ( b - quark annihilation ) , more decay channels ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 ) , and a wider range of non - standard physics ( supersymmetry and dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking ) from which rate enhancement may derive .",
    "we discuss the possible sizes of the enhancements in the various search channels for each model and pinpoint the model features having the largest influence on the degree of enhancement .",
    "we suggest the mass reach of the standard higgs searches for each kind of non - standard scalar state .",
    "we also compare the key signals for the non - standard scalars across models and also with expectations in the sm , to show how one could start to identify which state has actually been found .",
    "much of our discussion will focus on the degree to which certain standard higgs search channels are enhanced in non - standard models due to changes in the production rate or branching fractions of the non - standard scalar @xmath12 relative to the values for the standard higgs boson @xmath13 .",
    "we define the enhancement factor for the process @xmath14 as the ratio of the products of the width of the ( exclusive ) production mechanism and the branching ratio of the decay : @xmath15 analytic formulas for the decay widths of the sm higgs boson are taken from @xcite , @xcite and numerical values are calculated using the hdecay program @xcite .    in section 2 , we introduce supersymmetric and dynamical models of electroweak symmetry breaking and indicate which model features will be particularly relevant to our analysis . in section 3 , we discuss the production and decay of the scalar states of the various models at the tevatron and lhc and present our results for the enhancement factors . in section 4",
    ", we compare the different models to one another and to the sm .",
    "section 5 holds our conclusions .",
    "the standard higgs model of particle physics , based on the gauge group @xmath16 , accommodates electroweak symmetry breaking by including a fundamental weak doublet of scalar ( `` higgs '' ) bosons @xmath17 with potential function @xmath18 .",
    "however the sm does not explain the dynamics responsible for the generation of mass .",
    "furthermore , the scalar sector suffers from two serious problems .",
    "the scalar mass is unnaturally sensitive to the presence of physics at any higher scale ( e.g. the planck scale ) , through contributions of loops of sm particles to the higgs self - energy .",
    "this is known as the gauge hierarchy problem @xcite .",
    "in addition , if the scalar must provide a good description of physics up to arbitrarily high scale ( i.e. , be fundamental ) , the scalar s self - coupling ( @xmath19 ) is driven to zero at finite energy scales .",
    "that is , the scalar field theory is free ( or `` trivial '' ) @xcite . then the scalar can not fill its intended role : if @xmath20 , the electroweak symmetry is not spontaneously broken .",
    "the scalars involved in electroweak symmetry breaking must therefore be a party to new physics at some finite energy scale  e.g. , they may be composite or may be part of a larger theory with a uv fixed point .",
    "the sm is merely a low - energy effective field theory , and the dynamics responsible for generating mass must lie in physics outside the sm .    in this section , we briefly introduce two classes of physics beyond the standard model that may carry the answer to the puzzle of electroweak symmetry breaking . for a review of supersymmetric models ,",
    "see @xcite,@xcite ; for an introduction to dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking , see @xcite . in the meantime",
    ", we will summarize the aspects of these models which are most germane to our analysis .",
    "one interesting possibility for addressing the hierarchy and triviality problems is to introduce supersymmetry .",
    "the gauge structure of the minimal supersymmetric sm ( mssm ) is identical to that of the sm , but each ordinary fermion ( boson ) is paired with a new boson ( fermion ) , called its `` superpartner , '' and two higgs doublets provide mass to all the ordinary fermions .",
    "each loop of ordinary particles contributing to the higgs boson s mass is now countered by a loop of superpartners .",
    "if the masses of the ordinary particles and superpartners are close enough , the gauge hierarchy can be stabilized @xcite .",
    "supersymmetry relates the scalar self - coupling to gauge couplings , so that triviality is not a concern .    in order to provide masses to both up - type and down - type quarks , and to ensure anomaly cancellation , the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm )",
    "contains two higgs complex - doublet superfields : @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "when electroweak symmetry breaking occurs , the neutral components of the higgs doublets acquire independent vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) : [ eq - higgs - sector ] = 1 ( v_d + 0 ) ,   = 1 ( 0 + v_u ) , where @xmath23  gev . out of the original 8 degrees of freedom , 3 serve as goldstone bosons , absorbed into longitudinal components of the @xmath24 and @xmath25 , making them massive .",

    "rather , several different classes of models have been proposed to address various challenges within the dewsb paradigm of the origins of mass . in this paper , we look at several representative technicolor models .",
    "we both evaluate the potential of standard higgs searches to discover the lightest pseudo nambu - goldstone boson ( pngb ) of each of these models , and also draw some inferences about the characteristics of technicolor models that have the greatest impact on this search potential .",
    "our analysis will assume , for simplicity , that the lightest pngb state is significantly lighter than other neutral ( pseudo ) scalar technipions , so as to heighten the comparison to the sm higgs boson .",
    "the precise spectrum of any technicolor model generally depends on a number of parameters , particularly those related to whatever  extended technicolor \"",
    "@xcite interaction transmits electroweak symmetry breaking to the ordinary quarks and leptons .",
    "models in which several light neutral pngbs were nearly degenerate would produce even larger signals than those discussed here .",
    "the specific models we examine are : 1 ) the traditional one - family model @xcite with a full family of techniquarks and technileptons , 2 ) a variant on the one - family model @xcite in which the lightest technipion contains only down - type technifermions and is significantly lighter than the other pseudo nambu - goldstone bosons , 3 ) a multiscale walking technicolor model @xcite designed to reduce flavor - changing neutral currents , and 4 ) a low - scale technciolor model ( the technicolor straw man model ) @xcite with many weak doublets of technifermions , in which the second - lightest technipion @xmath49 is the state relevant for our study ( the lightest , being composed of technileptons , lacks the anomalous coupling to gluons required for @xmath50 production ) . for simplicity the lightest relevant neutral technipion of each model",
    "will be generically denoted @xmath51 ; where a specific model is meant , a superscript will be used .",
    "one of the key differences among these models is the value of the technipion decay constant @xmath52 , which is related to the number @xmath53 of weak doublets of technifermions that contribute to electroweak symmetry breaking . in a theory like model 2 ,",
    "in which only a single technifermion condensate breaks the electroweak symmetry , the value of @xmath52 is simply the weak scale : @xmath54 gev . in models where more than one technifermion condensate breaks the ew symmetry",

    "then in section 4 , we compare the signatures of these pngbs to those of a sm higgs and the higgs bosons of the mssm in order to determine how the standard search modes ( or additional channels ) can help tell these states apart .",
    "in this section , we examine the single production of susy higgses and technicolor pngbs via the two dominant methods at the tevatron and lhc : gluon fusion and @xmath8 annihilation .",
    "we determine the degree to which these production channels are enhanced relative to production of a sm higgs , and find which channel dominates for each scalar state .",
    "we likewise study the major decay modes : @xmath8 , @xmath5 , @xmath11 , and @xmath9 in order to determine the branching fractions relative to those of an sm higgs .",
    "we then combine this information to obtain the overall enhancement factor in each channel and the estimated cross - section at each collider .",
    "let us consider how the signal of a light higgs boson could be changed in the mssm , compared to expectations in the sm .",
    "there are several important sources of alterations in the predicted signal , some of which are interconnected .",
    "first , the mssm includes three neutral higgs bosons @xmath61 states .",
    "the apparent signal of a single light higgs could be enhanced if two or three neutral higgs species are nearly degenerate so that more than one higgs is actually contributing to the final state being studied .",
    "the left - hand frame of figure  [ fig : degenspec ] illustrates that for higgs masses around 120 gev it is possible for several higgs states to be close in mass .",
    "we take advantage of this near - degeneracy by combining the signals of the different neutral higgs bosons when their masses are closer than the experimental resolution . specifically ,",
    "when combining the signal from @xmath42 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 , we require @xmath62 and/or @xmath63 to be less than 0.3@xmath64 gev , as compared to the approximate experimental resolution for the higgs mass of @xmath64 gev for @xmath5 or @xmath8 channels . for the higgs mass range studied here , 0.3@xmath64 would correspond to a fairly small mass gap of order @xmath65 gev . for the @xmath11 channel",

    "as the @xmath93 mass increases up to about 140 gev , the opening of the @xmath9 decay channel drives the @xmath5 branching fraction down , and increases the @xmath34 value required to make higgses visible in the @xmath5 channel . at still larger @xmath93 , a very steep drop in the gluon luminosity ( and the related @xmath38-quark luminosity ) at large @xmath99 reduces the phase space for @xmath100 production .",
    "therefore for @xmath101170 gev , higgs bosons would only be visible at very high values of @xmath34 .",
    "figure  [ fig : mssm - contours - lhc ] presents a qualitatively similar picture for lhc , based on the studies of @xmath102 of @xcite .",
    "the main differences compared to the tevatron are that the required value of @xmath34 at the lhc is lower for a given @xmath93 and it does not climb steeply for @xmath101170 gev because there is much less phase space suppression .",
    "it is important to notice that both , tevatron and lhc , could observe mssm higgs bosons in the @xmath5 channel even for moderate values of @xmath34 for @xmath103  gev , because of significant enhancement of this channel .",
    "however the @xmath11 channel is so suppressed that even the lhc will not be able to observe it in any point of the @xmath104 gev parameter space studied in this paper !   and low values of @xmath34 , the lightest mssm higgs could be dicovered in the @xmath11 mode just like the sm model higgs boson , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ]      in section 3.2 we found a distinct enhancement of the @xmath51 signal in both the @xmath5 and @xmath11 search channels for each of the technicolor models studied .",
    "as illustrated in the left frame of figure  [ fig : techni - limits ] , the available enhancement is well above what is required to render the @xmath51 of any of these models visible in the @xmath5 channel at the tevatron .",
    "likewise , the right frame of that figure shows that in the @xmath11 channel at the tevatron the technipions of models 3 and 4 will be observable at the @xmath98 level while model 2 is subject to exclusion at the @xmath97 level .",
    "the situation at the lhc is even more promising : figure  [ fig : techni - limits - lhc ] shows that all four models could be observable at the @xmath98 level in both the @xmath5 ( left frame ) and @xmath11 ( right frame ) channels .",
    "discovery and @xmath97 exclusion curves indicate the required enhancement factor for a higgs - like particle at tevatron run ii when the final state is @xmath105 ( left frame ) or @xmath106 ( right frame ) .",
    "[ fig : techni - limits],title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]   discovery and @xmath97 exclusion curves indicate the required enhancement factor for a higgs - like particle at tevatron run ii when the final state is @xmath105 ( left frame ) or @xmath106 ( right frame ) .",
    "[ fig : techni - limits],title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]     for each technicolor model plotted as a function of technipion mass and assuming the final state is a tau(@xmath107 ) pair ",
    "left(right ) at lhc .",
    "the lowest curve is the @xmath108 required to make a higgs - like particle visible ( discovery ) in @xmath5 or in @xmath106 at lhc .",
    "[ fig : techni - limits - lhc],title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]   for each technicolor model plotted as a function of technipion mass and assuming the final state is a tau(@xmath107 ) pair ",
    "left(right ) at lhc .",
    "the lowest curve is the @xmath108 required to make a higgs - like particle visible ( discovery ) in @xmath5 or in @xmath106 at lhc .",
    "[ fig : techni - limits - lhc],title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]      in the previous section we have shown that that the tevatron and lhc have the potential to observe the light ( pseudo ) scalar states characteristic of both supersymmetry and models of dynamical symmetry breaking .",
    "for both classes of models , the @xmath105 channel is enhanced and could be used for discovery of the light higgs - like states .",
    "once a supposed light `` higgs boson '' is observed in a collider experiment , an immediate important task will be to identify the new state more precisely , i.e. to discern `` the meaning of higgs '' in this context . comparison of the enhancement factors for different channels will aid in this task .",
    "our study has shown that comparison of the @xmath5 and @xmath11 channels can be particularly informative in distinguishing supersymmetric from dynamical models . in the case of supersymmetry , when the @xmath5 channel is enhanced , the @xmath11 channel is suppressed , and this suppression is strong enough that even the lhc would not observe the @xmath11 signature . in contrast , for the dynamical symmetry breaking models studied we expect _ simultaneous _ enhancement of both the @xmath5 and @xmath11 channels .",
    "the enhancement of the @xmath11 channel is so significant , that even at the tevatron we may observe technipions via this signature at the @xmath98 level for models 3 and 4 , while model 2 could be excluded at 95% cl at the tevatron .",
    "the lhc collider , which will have better sensitivity to the signatures under study , will be able to observe all four models of dynamical symmetry breaking studied here in the @xmath11 channel , and can therefore distinguish more conclusively between the supersymmetric and dynamical models .",
    "we also would like to stress an important difference between two class of models in their production mechanisms . in supersymmetry",
    "the @xmath8 fusion process is likely to be as important as the @xmath75 fusion mechanism ( see figure 6 ) in contributing to the total production cross section . in technicolor models , however , the @xmath8 fusion contribution to technipion production is likely to be negligible .",
    "this difference could be revealed , in principle , by looking at other ( exclusive or semi - exclusive ) processes : in case of supersymmetry , for example , one would expect significant enhancement of higgs boson production associated with @xmath38-quarks .",
    "in this paper we have shown that searches for a light standard model higgs boson at tevatron run ii and cern lhc have the power to provide significant information about important classes of physics beyond the standard model .",
    "we demonstrated that the new scalar and pseudo - scalar states predicted in both supersymmetric and dynamical models can have enhanced visibility in standard @xmath5 and @xmath11 search channels , making them potentially discoverable at both the tevatron run ii and the cern lhc .",
    "the enhancement arises largely from increases in the production rate ; we showed that the model parameters exerting the largest influence on the enhancement size are @xmath34 in the case of the mssm and @xmath86 and @xmath52 in the case of dynamical symmetry breaking .",
    "at the same time , the @xmath109 decay pathway is suppressed in the models studied here by at least an order of magnitude , compared to standard model expectations . in comparing the key signals for the non - standard scalars across models",
    ", we were able to show how one could start to identify which state has actually been found by a standard higgs search .",
    "in particular , we investigated the likely mass reach of the higgs search in @xmath110 for each kind of non - standard scalar state , and we demonstrated that @xmath111 may cleanly distinguish the scalars of supersymmetric models from those of dynamical models .",
