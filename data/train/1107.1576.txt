    "[ fig : fig2 ] ) the device for both pbtct - c@xmath0:pc@xmath1bm blend ratios was about an order of magnitude lower at 150  ns in the 1:1 device as compared to 1:4 with both techniques .",
    "this was despite the higher polymer content and thus larger absorption coefficient at 532  nm in the former .",
    "we note that the trmc signal was corrected for the optical attenuation ( see equation  [ eq : g2 ] ) .",
    "photoluminescence in intercalated bulk systems is quenched very efficiently,@xcite indicating that almost every photogenerated singlet exciton is separated at a donor ",
    "acceptor interface creating a polaron pair .",
    "however , fine phase intermixing and disorganized percolation paths in pbtct - c@xmath0:pc@xmath1bm 1:1 blends may lead to a less efficient separation of photogenerated polaron pairs as compared to the 1:4 ratio .",
    "thus , we assign the reduced charge carrier extraction in the 1:1 device at @xmath46  ns to an enhanced geminate recombination  occurring on shorter time scales  due to lower delocalization of the charge carriers caused by a lack of percolation paths .",
    "electrons may be trapped on isolated acceptor molecules , which can not hop away from the interface to be dissociated .",
    "consequently , those charge carriers are lost for the photocurrent . during the delay time",
    "the recombination of charge carriers will change the flat band conditions of the solar cell resulting in a sweep out of some of the charges , in addition to recombination .",

    "we will discuss the charge carrier decays after 150  ns in view of polaron recombination .",

    "recombination of charges in low mobility materials is usually described by the bimolecular langevin process.@xcite this mechanism shows a charge carrier decay of the second order if electron and hole concentrations are similar .    in typical donor ",
    "acceptor blends , the transport of electrons is restricted to the acceptor and the hole transport to the donor domain . in these systems ,",
    "recombination of electrons and holes is spatially restricted to the heterointerface,@xcite which explains in part the overestimation of recombination rates by applying the langevin model.@xcite in addition to reducing the overall recombination probability , it is important to note that the occurrence of non geminate recombination described by langevin theory requires either mobile electrons and holes , @xmath47 and @xmath48 respectively , to meet at the heterointerface , or mobile electrons ( holes ) and holes ( electrons ) trapped very close to the heterointerface .",
    "thereby , we distinguish between spatially @xmath49 and energetically @xmath50 trapped carriers .",
    "the former is related to charge carriers being spatially confined in a material phase due to the lack of percolation to the respective electrode .",
    "in contrast to energetically trapped charges , they are locally mobile and can thus recombine at the heterointerface with an oppositely charged carrier , but can not be extracted at the contacts .    energetically trapped charges  which are immobile  can only participate in the recombination process if ( i ) they are close enough to the donor ",
    "acceptor interface ( for instance due to donor",
    " acceptor intermixing ) , or ( ii ) if they are emitted after a certain dwell time , thus being mobile once again ( @xmath51 ) . for ( ii )",
    ", the emission rate @xmath52 of charges from traps depends crucially on the energetic distribution of the density of trap states . in the hopping systems under consideration ,",
    "even the intrinsic density of states below the transport energy level  the tail of an exponential or a gaussian density of states distribution ( dos)can act as traps.@xcite    if we consider the continuity equation of free holes @xmath47 , which can be extracted , we find @xmath53 . here ,",
    "@xmath48 and @xmath54 are the free and trapped electrons , respectively , and @xmath21 and @xmath55 are the relevant recombination prefactors . if @xmath56 , the recombination dynamics become @xmath57 , where @xmath58a first order process .",
    "depending on the magnitude of @xmath54 as compared to the mobile charge carriers , recombination orders between one and two would be observed . in the studied pbtct - c@xmath0:pc@xmath1bm blend system a recombination order far above two is observed at low temperatures by photo - celiv and trmc for both blend ratios ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] ) approaching close to or even decrease below two at @xmath5  k. in 1:4 blends , the excess amount of fullerenes leads to the formation of acceptor rich domains , which allows a faster delocalisation on short time scales  improving the photogeneration yield  @xcite  and to percolation paths for the electrons , favoring the charge extraction process as compared to the 1:1 blend .",
    "due to fine intermixing in the 1:1 ratio , electrons will be mostly trapped , if not energetically , then spatially due to the lack of percolation paths on isolated fullerenes close to the polymer backbones . a large amount of polaron pairs recombines before dissociation , as indicated by the low initial signal magnitude for both , trmc ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] ) and photo - celiv ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] ) measurements .",
    "the remaining charge carriers might find percolation paths to be extracted .",
    "however , with less thermal energy available they will partly be trapped in deep tail states of the dos , thus being immobile . as emission is thermally activated",
    ", the release of trapped charges takes much longer at low temperatures . only after emission from the continuous distribution of trap states , the now mobile charges",
    "can either be extracted by the linear voltage pulse or recombine non geminately .",
    "the latter process becomes less probable the later the emission occurs : the recombination partners of opposite charge may already have recombined or left the device .",
    "this leads to a reduced charge carrier decay .",
    "therefore , we assign the observed high recombination order at low temperatures to a delayed release of trapped charges not actively participating in the recombination process.@xcite with increasing temperature energetic trapping is more unlikely . however , the spatial restrictions in the bulk structure will affect the charge dynamics more dominantly .",
    "the recombination order decreases even slightly below two in both studied ratios , which we attribute to an imbalanced relation between free mobile electrons and holes due to spatial trapping in the fine intermixed phase , as explained above .",
    "even though the two complementary techniques photo - celiv and trmc rely on different measurement principles , the results fit qualitatively together . in case of trmc ,",
    "all mobile charge carriers contribute to the measurement signal , including also spatially restricted charge carriers @xmath49 .",
    "photo - celiv is only sensitive to charge carriers , which can be extracted by the voltage pulse .",
    "this includes also charge carriers being energetically trapped in deep states during the delay time not participating in the recombination processes , but can be extracted by the voltage pulse .",
    "thus a higher recombination order is deduced from the photo - celiv experiment .",
    "the transport and recombination dynamics in pbtct - c@xmath0:pc@xmath1bm bulk heterojunction solar cells were investigated by the combination of the two complementary techniques of photo - celiv and trmc for the first time probing different length scales .",
    "x - ray diffraction measurements indicate that structural changes occurred in the studied blend structure for a 1:1 and 1:4 weight ratio , where pc@xmath1bm molecules probably intercalate into the available space of two neighboring polymer side chain stacks . due to fine donor  acceptor intermixing ,",
    "an enhanced geminate recombination is explained by the order in magnitude less concentration of initially extracted polarons in the 1:1 ratio . the lack of percolation pathways for electrons in the 1:1 ratio results in a low local charge carrier mobility decreasing the polaron pair dissociation probability significantly .",

    "<S> the charge carrier decay order of above two for temperatures below 300  k can be explained by a release of trapped charges . </S>",
