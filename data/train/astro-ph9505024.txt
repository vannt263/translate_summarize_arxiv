    "assuming no evolution and a homogeneous set of type ia supernovae , a perfect and complete set of type ia supernova spectra can be used to calculate the apparent magnitudes at any redshift and epoch , given the transmission functions and the zeropoints of the magnitude system .",
    "unfortunately , this is not feasible due to several problems : ( 1 ) the available supernova spectra often have insufficient wavelength coverage to calculate broadband photometry and insufficient time coverage to track the quickly evolving supernova ; ( 2 ) many of the available spectra do not have the signal - to - noise to calculate precise magnitudes ; ( 3 ) spectral miscalibrations can lead to large errors in magnitude determinations ; ( 4 ) the filter transmission function and detector response function are not perfectly known .",
    "more reliable magnitude calculations can be made using spectra and photometry together , photometry being less sensitive to the above problems than spectra . in this paper , we calculate and discuss the errors for a generalized @xmath0 correction , an example of such a technique , with a preliminary analysis using three `` normal '' type ia supernova .",
    "( one `` peculiar '' was also examined for comparison purposes . )",
    "these @xmath0 corrections are particularly important for use with supernovae at @xmath5 , which are now being discovered in systematic searching ( e.g. , perlmutter et al .",
    "1994 , 1995 ) .",
    "the standard @xmath0 correction , @xmath6 , is used to calculate the apparent magnitude in some `` @xmath7 '' filter band of an object at redshift @xmath8 according to the equation : @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the distance modulus ( based on luminosity distance ) and @xmath11 is the absolute @xmath7 magnitude ( we omit explicit time dependence in subsequent equations ) .",
    "the @xmath0 correction relates nearby and distant magnitudes measured with the same filter : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the spectral energy distribution at the source ( in this case the supernova ) , and @xmath14 is the @xmath7th filter transmission ( oke & sandage 1968 ) .",
    "we generalize this expression to handle different filters , adding a term that accounts for the differences in the zeropoints of the magnitude system : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is an idealized stellar sed for which @xmath17 in the photometric system being used .",
    "@xmath18 is thus defined so that @xmath19 . if @xmath20 , the first term drops out and this reduces to the standard @xmath0 correction of equation  [ ki ] .",
    "the second line of equation  [ kij ] is a change of variables , @xmath21 , that makes it easier to understand the @xmath18 correction in the case @xmath22 , a situation approximated by the dashed lines in figure  [ filters ] .",
    "if the `` blueshifted '' @xmath23th filter matches the @xmath7th filter function the second term in this equation drops out , and one is left with the term accounting for the difference in zeropoints of the filters ( this difference is the `` color zeropoint '' ) . in this case , spectral dependence on the correction is eliminated .",
    "note that this cross - filter approach has previously been used for galaxy @xmath0 corrections ( e.g. gunn 1978 ) .",
    "we calculate generalized @xmath0 corrections using equation  [ kij ] with bessell s ( 1990 ) color zeropoints and realizations of the johnson - cousins ubvri filter system ( figure  [ filters ] ) .",
    "the color zeropoints are expected to match real photometric color zeropoints to better than 0.01 mag ( hamuy et al .",
    "1992 quotes @xmath24 , bessell ( private communication ) quotes @xmath25 ) . only supernovae with non - peculiar spectra and no evidence for reddening",
    "are used , as described by vaughan et al .",
    "our full sample is presented in table  1 and contains 29 spectra from epochs @xmath26 days after blue maximum for supernovae sn1981b , sn1990n , and sn1992a .",
    "the sn1981b data is from branch et al .",
    "( 1983 ) , sn1990n data is described in leibundgut et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , and sn1992a is in suntzeff et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , and kirshner et al .",
    "the sn1981b spectra labeled by epoch ( 0 ) is a composite of four spectra from march 6 - 9 ( branch et al .",
    "the sn1992a hst spectra from epoch 5 with a spectral range of 1650 - 4800  has been augmented by the ctio spectra from epoch 6 as described in kirshner et al .",
    "( 1993 ) ; it is labeled epoch ( 5 ) .",
    "the @xmath0 corrections were not calculated for cases in which the spectra did not cover at least @xmath27 of the effective acceptance of the passband and are labeled with ellipsis .",
    "tables  2 ,  3 , and  4 have @xmath18 corrections for @xmath28 , @xmath29 and redshifts spanning from 0 to 0.7 in increments of 0.025 .",
    "epochs are given in the supernova rest - frame .",
    "note that @xmath30 is just the standard @xmath3 band @xmath0 correction .",
    "each column of data is for a single supernova spectrum ; the three tables have different number of columns because the number of spectra with sufficient wavelength coverage to calculate each correction varies .",
    "in particular , table  4 has much fewer entries because there are only a few spectra covering the needed wavelength range to calculate @xmath30 .",
    "see hamuy et al . for tables of @xmath31 and @xmath32",
    "; these @xmath0 corrections have poor spectral coverage at @xmath33 for @xmath31 and at @xmath34 for @xmath32 .",
    "we consider the contributions of the following sources of error in the @xmath0 correction : numerical integration error , spectral measurement and calibration error , intrinsic supernova - to - supernova dispersion , instrumental effects , and zeropoint uncertainty .",
    "the numerical integration is accurate to 0.001 mag and we are able to reproduce the standard @xmath0 corrections in @xmath2 and in @xmath35 of hamuy et al . to that accuracy .",
    "a larger source of uncertainty comes from the noise and calibration error of the spectra themselves .",
    "lacking prior spectral error information , we test each spectrum s error properties by calculating , for @xmath36 , @xmath37 colors on the subset of 24 spectra with sufficient coverage .",
    "their difference from the photometrically observed colors form a gaussian distribution with a sigma of 0.04 mag .",
    "these @xmath37 colors compare two spectral regions that have little overlap , while @xmath0 corrections that compare overlapping regions are less sensitive to large scale miscalibrations and therefore should have smaller error .",
    "the rapid but smooth evolution of supernova spectra should make @xmath0 corrections a smooth function on the scale of a few days .",
    "however , the data shows scatter from measurement and calibration error in the spectra .",
    "the good temporal sampling of sn1992a allows us to make @xmath0 correction error estimates based on this scatter .",
    "we illustrate by considering the specific examples of @xmath38 and @xmath39 at @xmath40 , shown in figures  [ kvr5 ] and  [ kbr5 ] .",
    "( unfortunately , there are insufficient data points to similarly consider @xmath30 . )",
    "we first study the subset of sn1992a @xmath0 corrections calculated from spectra measured at a single telescope , the ctio 1.0-m .",
    "this includes all sn1992 spectra except the ones at epochs 5 , 6 , 9 , 17 , 46 , and 76 .",
    "we estimate the root - mean - square scatter of the data from a smooth curve to be @xmath41 for @xmath38 and @xmath42 for @xmath39 ; we take this to be the bound on the effects of spectral measurement errors .",
    "considering the full sample of sn1992a @xmath0 corrections from all the telescopes , we find the range ( not the root - mean - square ) in scatter to be @xmath430.004 for @xmath38 and @xmath430.1 for @xmath39 ; we take these to be the bounds on systematic instrumental error .",
    "having studied errors involved in the @xmath0 corrections of a single type ia supernova , we now consider the uncertainties involved in constructing a single @xmath0 correction for this entire class of supernovae .",
    "we do this by examining systematic differences between the three supernovae in our sample .",
    "again consider @xmath0 corrections for @xmath40 plotted in figures  [ kvr5 ] and  [ kbr5 ] .",
    "the scatter at a given epoch in @xmath38 and @xmath39 is dominated by intrinsic supernova - to - supernova differences .",
    "these differences are understood as being due to the observed variance in these particular supernovae s color evolution , particularly around 20 days after maximum when the supernovae have quickly reached their reddest color .",
    "the range of scatter is @xmath430.015 mag for @xmath38 and @xmath430.2 mag for @xmath39 ; for epochs before day 17 , the range narrows to @xmath41 for @xmath38 and @xmath430.1 mag for @xmath39 .    as a preliminary test of the variation in @xmath0 correction for type ia supernovae that are not `` normal , '' the @xmath0 corrections of the `` peculiar '' type ia sn1991 t were also calculated ( ford et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and phillips et al .",
    "( 1992 ) describe this supernova ) .",
    "their scatter with respect to the normal supernovae s @xmath0 corrections was within the intrinsic supernova - to - supernova dispersion discussed above , even for epochs @xmath44 , when the sn1991 t spectra least resembled `` normal '' type ia spectra .",
    "this suggests that broadband averaging smooths over intrinsic differences in supernova spectra and that @xmath0 corrections may be robust enough to use for the entire class of type ia supernovae , although more examples of peculiar type ia supernovae ( e.g. sn1991bg ) will be needed to test this possibility .    in the above discussions ,",
    "no conclusions could be made on @xmath30 error due to sparseness of data .",
    "however , error estimates can be made based on the range of the correction .",
    "recalling equation  [ kij ] , we see that @xmath0 corrections are the sum of an overall offset due to the different filter zeropoints plus a spectrally dependent term .",
    "smaller spectral terms will propagate smaller errors into the @xmath0 correction than larger spectral terms . in this analysis ,",
    "the relative size of the spectral term is apparent in the spread over time of the @xmath0 correction , since it is the only time - dependent term . comparing the spread over time from figure  [ krr5](a ) with that from figure  [ kvr5 ]",
    ", we see that the spectral contribution in the standard single - filter @xmath0 correction , @xmath30 , is almost twice that of @xmath39 , showing that the errors in @xmath30 are much larger than those of @xmath39 .",
    "this point is demonstrated more dramatically in figure  [ krr5](a , b ) where @xmath38 and @xmath30 are plotted on the same scale .",
    "it is clear that the scatter in @xmath38 is much smaller than would be expected for @xmath30 .",
    "we have examined potential instrumental effects by performing @xmath18 calculations with effective kitt peak 4-m passbands based on the quantum efficiency of the tk2b ccd camera and the kp1464 harris b , kp1465 harris v , and kp1466 harris r filters for the @xmath2,@xmath35 , and @xmath3 filters respectively .",
    "observations of standard stars show that this effective passband closely matches the johnson - cousins system , i.e. the color - correction term to transform from the instrumental to the photometric system is negligible .",
    "comparison between these and the bessell filter @xmath0 corrections show differences at a level of 0.02 mag with standard deviation 0.02 mag .",
    "we also see the expected correlation with the observed supernova color ; corrections for redder supernovae are more sensitive to the differences in the red tails of the bessell and kitt peak response functions .",
    "( see figure  [ kpnofilter ] . )",
    "the nature of this dependence can be seen in figure  [ bessminkpnocol ] .",
    "a more detailed analysis will require a more complete spectral data set .",
    "there is an additional error due to zeropoint uncertainty for @xmath38 and @xmath39 mag which does not effect @xmath30 .",
    "this is an advantage of the single - filter @xmath0 correction , since zeropoints cancel if you compare data in the same band .",
    "as discussed earlier , the size of this error is less than 0.01 mag .    given these contributing sources of error , we can compare the overall uncertainties for the generalized and standard @xmath0 corrections .",
    "we begin with the case of @xmath40 .",
    "@xmath38 and @xmath39 have the same zeropoint uncertainty , however at this redshift @xmath38 has smaller errors than @xmath39 from all other sources .",
    "this includes measurement error , instrumental systematics , and supernova - to - supernova systematics .",
    "although @xmath30 has no zeropoint error , it is otherwise expected to have errors even larger than @xmath39 .",
    "we emphasize that @xmath38 has these advantages because at @xmath40 , @xmath45 , minimizing the spectral dependence on the @xmath0 correction ( figure  [ filters ] ) .",
    "the case of @xmath40 is important as an extreme in which it is possible to match filters . to illustrate the errors expected for other redshifts ,",
    "figure  [ stdevs ] also shows the calculated root - mean - square scatter for the group of @xmath0 corrections near peak magnitude , for sn1992a at epochs -1 and 3 , and sn1981b at epoch 0 .",
    "the root - mean - square scatter is minimized at redshifts where the filters best match , and monotonically worsens as one moves away from these redshifts .",
    "note that the error can be kept below 0.04 mag by switching from the nearby @xmath35 photometry to the nearby @xmath2 photometry when comparing supernovae at @xmath46 .",
    "we have considered a generalized @xmath0 correction as an alternative to the single - band @xmath0 correction for relating local and high - redshift supernova magnitudes .",
    "error sizes depend on the filter pair combination chosen and reflect the size of the term that accounts for the different spectral regions observed in distant and local supernovae . minimizing this term by matching filters to observe the same region reduces error and can make a generalized @xmath0 correction better than a single - band @xmath0 correction . matching filters",
    "also reduces the wavelength range needed to perform @xmath0 corrections , making more of the available data usable for better temporal coverage and for studies in systematic differences in supernovae .",
    "generally , error estimates and optimal filter pair determinations at any redshift can be made using a procedure similar to the one we have outlined for @xmath40 .",
    "roughly , we find that for @xmath47 , @xmath30 should be used , for @xmath48 , @xmath39 should be used , and for @xmath49 , @xmath38 should be used .",
    "objects at higher redshift may be better observed in the @xmath50 band .",
    "these general results for the preferred observation bands at a given redshift to `` match filters '' will , of course , be true whatever the spectra observed .",
    "however , further studies based on more supernova spectra will improve the estimates of the generalized @xmath0 corrections , and help characterize the detailed dependence on supernova - to - supernova variation .",
    "we would like to thank b. leibundgut , m. bessell , d. branch , and the calan / tololo search group ( m. phillips , n.suntzeff , j. maza , and m. hamuy ) for providing data and for helpful discussions .",
