    "next we consider @xmath0 vectors @xmath11 satisfying the following two conditions :    * the coordinates of each @xmath12 are multiples of @xmath6 ; * the matrix @xmath13 is invertible .",
    "it follows from ( a1 ) that the translated sets @xmath14 are non - overlapping , i.e. , their interiors are pairwise disjoint .",
    "finally we fix an invertible linear transformation @xmath15 of @xmath16 , we introduce the lattice @xmath17 ( here @xmath18 denotes the adjoint of @xmath15 ) and the set @xmath19    [ r21 ] let us emphasize that the volume of @xmath20 of @xmath21 does not depend on the particular choice of @xmath0 and the vectors @xmath11 satisfying ( a1 ) .",

    "this follows from the change of variable formula : if @xmath49 , then @xmath50 where @xmath51 denotes the determinant of @xmath15 , and @xmath52    since @xmath15 transforms non - empty open sets into non - empty open sets , the second part of the theorem also holds in the general case .",

    "given a lattice @xmath54 we may wonder whether we there exists another representation @xmath55 with another invertible matrix @xmath56 and a smaller integer @xmath57 . as we will see in the rest of the paper choosing the minimal @xmath0",
