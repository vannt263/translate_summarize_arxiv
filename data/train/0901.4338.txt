    "type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) are thought to be distinct from other types of supernovae ( that is , resulting from a different progenitor population ) , as they are found in galaxies spanning a broad range of properties . while , type ii , ib , and ic sne",

    "forming galaxies , indicating that they are the evolutionary product of massive stars , sne ia are found in both star  forming and quiescent systems , suggesting that they are somehow connected to the evolution of less  massive stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , it is widely accepted that the progenitors of type ia supernovae are carbon  oxygen white dwarfs ( wds ) , which have accreted mass up to the chandrasekhar limit @xcite , perhaps via deposition from a binary companion @xcite .",
    "lending support to this picture , theoretical models of exploding wds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are able to reproduce the properties of sn ia spectra , including the lack of hydrogen features and the presence of strong silicon absorption , which define the type ia classification .",
    "recent observations of the type ia sn rate in local and intermediate  redshift galaxies have cast some doubt on  or at minimum confused  the theoretical paradigm just discussed .",
    "if sne ia are simply the product of old stellar populations ( i.e. , an evolutionary outcome of low  mass stars ) , then the sn ia rate should depend strongly on stellar mass , while being independent of the level of on  going star ",
    "formation activity ( at fixed stellar mass ) .",
    "while the type ia rate is found to depend on stellar mass , it is also found to be greater per unit stellar mass in galaxies with higher specific star ",
    "formation rates @xcite .",
    "these current observations of the supernova ia rate support a revised theoretical model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , perhaps one employing a two  component progenitor distribution with a `` prompt '' component correlated with star  formation activity and a `` delayed '' component correlated with stellar mass ( i.e. , the underlying older stellar population ) . still ,",
    "despite uncertainty in the nature of the two observed components of the type ia rate as well as difficulties in directly observing the progenitors of type ia events , current observations remain consistent with a progenitor population comprised entirely of carbon  oxygen wds , allowing for an increasingly broad distribution of delay times ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "studying the environments of supernova  i.e. , their place in the hierarchy of large  scale structure  may prove useful in shedding light on the nature of the two components of the type ia rate or on the nature of the underlying progenitor population or potentially even revealing dependencies of the type ia rate or luminosity on galaxy properties that are correlated with environment .",
    "type ia supernovae are often used as cosmological probes , allowing distances to be measured out to intermediate redshifts and providing constraints on cosmological parameters such as @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "understanding any relationship between host galaxy properties and type ia luminosity is critical for minimizing systematic effects that might bias studies of distant type ia supernovae and limit our abilities to constrain cosmological models .",
    "along these lines , environment can be utilized as a proxy for other galaxy properties that are otherwise difficult to constrain observationally ( e.g. , stellar metallicity or age ) .",
    "for instance , a galaxy of the same stellar mass as another , but located in a higher  density environment , will generally have formed earlier in the history of the universe and will contain older stellar populations as a result ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "understanding if the type ia rate varies with the local galaxy environment may provide new insights into the true nature of the progenitor population , while also shedding light on many aspects of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "for instance , using environment as a proxy for formation time could be helpful in interpreting the role of an evolving initial stellar mass function ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) in establishing the potential progenitor population .    more directly , constraining the correlation between the sn rate ( of both type ia and ii events ) and galaxy environment is also critical for understanding various details of the chemical enrichment and star  formation histories of galaxies .",
    "for example , supernovae govern the production of metals @xcite , with types ia and ii dominating iron and oxygen production , respectively . due to their large gravitational potential wells ,",
    "galaxy clusters are potentially the only systems to have retained all of the metals produced by stars .",
    "for this reason , studies of the metal content ( e.g. , fe abundance ) in the intracluster medium ( icm ) provide interesting windows on the cosmic star ",
    "formation history ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "given the role of supernovae in dispersing metals , a critical part of this picture is to understand how the sn rate may vary with environment in addition to time @xcite .    furthermore , energy injected into the interstellar medium ( ism ) by supernovae could play an important role in influencing the formation of galactic disks @xcite .",
    "variation in the supernova rate with environment could thus be a factor ( though likely very weak ) in the establishment of the morphology  density relation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "finally , feedback from supernova  generated winds is thought to be an essential part of shaping the mass  metallicity relation @xcite , causing a downturn in the relative enrichment at low stellar masses by ejecting metals into the intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "understanding the correlation between supernova rates and environment will help reveal whether supernova feedback is also responsible for driving the scatter in this fundamental relation , causing the observed correlation between metallicity and environment at fixed stellar mass and star  formation rate @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we utilize public data from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , * ? ? ? * ) and from the sdss ",
    "ii supernova survey @xcite to examine the environments of local type ia sne . in  2 , we discuss the data samples employed along with our measurements of galaxy environments .",

    "over the past three years , the sdss  ii supernova survey @xcite has repeatedly scanned a @xmath9 square degree region around the celestial equator in the southern galactic hemisphere in search of supernovae .",
    "the resulting data set , which includes more than @xmath10 sne , is exceptional in its size and uniformity , significantly increasing the number of known supernovae at @xmath11 with well  sampled and well  calibrated light curves .",

    "* ) , which primarily targets supernovae at higher redshifts @xmath12 , has discovered a comparable number of type ia events .    in this work ,",
    "we utilize the @xmath13 confirmed sne ia from the sdss ",

    "we limit the sample to a redshift range of @xmath0 and to sne for which a spectrum was obtained , which yields a total sample size of 163 type ia sne ( sn  a sample ) .",

    "thus , our results suggest that single  degenerate events are favored ( or are more luminous ) in low  density environs , given the assumptions detailed above .",
    "now , while physical mechanisms such as galaxy mergers or harassment are more common in high  density regions such as groups and clusters , it is difficult to suggest a physical mechanism specific to low  density environs that would directly impact the evolution of stellar populations and influence the sn ia rate or luminosity ( e.g. , by raising the binary fraction so as to produce more type ia events ) .",
    "it is seemingly more likely that environment is strongly correlated with a galaxy property that traces differences in stellar populations , such as stellar or gas  phase metallicity or stellar age . in the following section (  [ sec_disc_metal ] )",
    ", we discuss this issue in more detail .      as discussed in detail in",
    " [ sec_results ] , we find that blue sn ia host galaxies are only seen in comparatively low  density regions , suggesting that prompt supernovae ia occur ( or are found ) preferentially in underdense environs or that they are somehow suppressed in the high  density regime .",
    "however , there is little physical motivation for connecting large  scale environment  specific processes ( e.g. , mergers , strangulation , etc . ) with the generation or suppression of type ia supernovae .",
    "a potentially interesting , though currently poorly unconstrained , possibility could be that merger ",
    "induced star formation has somewhat different properties ( e.g. , a different initial mass function ) than typical star formation ( e.g. , due to higher gas densities ) .",
    "the prevalence of mergers in environments such as galaxy groups could thus be associated with an environment dependence to the prompt ia rate or luminosity .",
    "another possibility could be the suppression of sne _ within _ galaxies in clusters due to ram ",
    "pressure stripping , where the ( metal  poor ) outskirts of systems are preferentially confiscated by the igm .",
    "the stripped gas and stars would then contribute to the intracluster light and result in intracluster ( i.e. , intergalactic ) supernovae @xcite .",
    "such supernovae could be missed by narrow  field supernova searches that target individual galaxies in clusters rather than large fields ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the imaging data from the sdss ",
    "ii supernova survey , however , covers a large and nearly continuous field , such that any intracluster sne would be included in the supernova sample .",
    "still , an intracluster sn would be less likely to be matched to a host galaxy , thereby mimicking a suppression of sne within galaxies in overdense regions . given the large uncertainties in the cluster sn ia rate and in the relative contribution from intracluster events @xcite , the role of such supernovae remains largely unknown . with that said ,",
    "the relatively low concentration of blue galaxies in local clusters helps to minimize the impact of intracluster events on our results , as related to the preferential occurrence of sne ia in blue host galaxies in underdense environs .",
    "alternatively , it could be the case that environment is correlated with a galaxy property or properties , for which we did not control in our analysis .",
    "a correlation between a given physical property and environment would cause the overdensities about our sn host galaxies to be skewed relative to the comparison sample , if supernova host galaxies are a ( relatively ) biased tracer of that galaxy property .",
    "one likely galaxy characteristic to consider is metallicity .",
    "the metal abundance of a galaxy is often quantified in two ways : [ 1 ] by measuring the metal abundance in the interstellar medium ( the gas  phase metallicity ) and [ 2 ] by assessing the amount of metals locked up in the stellar population ( the stellar metallicity ) .",
    "the gas  phase metallicity is a product of the recent ( @xmath168 gyr ) accretion and star  formation history of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the stellar metallicity , which is commonly inferred from fits to stellar absorption features in optical spectra , traces the metals locked up in the old stellar population .",
    "thus , stellar metallicity is a tracer of the integrated star ",
    "formation history and a measure of the gas  phase metallicity in the galaxy when the bulk of the stars formed . here",
    ", we investigate the potential role of both stellar and gas  phase metallicity in biasing our supernova samples in star  forming galaxies towards underdense environments .",
    "to study the potential role of stellar metallicity in our results , we employ the measurements of @xcite , which are based on model fits to spectral absorption features in the sdss dr4 spectra .",
    "the measurements are sensitive to the signal  to  noise ratio of the spectrum ( see table 1 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which limits our ability to directly constrain the stellar metallicities of the sn hosts .",
    "more than half of the sne in our sample are at @xmath169 , which means that the host galaxies tend to be relatively faint in the @xmath133band ( less than @xmath146 of the sne have an @xmath133band magnitude @xmath170 ) and the derived metallicity values are highly uncertain .",
    "for this reason , we are unable to make any meaningful statements about the stellar metallicity values of the hosts relative to the comparison galaxy samples .",
    "however , we are able to study the relationship between stellar metallicity , @xmath171 , and environment for the general sdss galaxy population , which allows us to understand how our results regarding the environments of type ia hosts could be understood in terms of a stellar metallicity bias . in the appendix , we investigate in detail the relationship between metallicity and environment for three magnitude  limited samples drawn from the @xcite catalog . as shown in figure [ zenv2_fig ] , we find a significant correlation such that galaxies with more metal  rich stellar populations typically reside in more overdense environs .",
    "furthermore , this general correlation persists when focusing on just those galaxies that reside on the blue cloud ( following equation [ eqn1 ] ) ; although , the trend is considerably weaker .    a corresponding relationship between gas  phase metallicity and environment",
    "was recently published by @xcite ; studying star  forming galaxies in the sdss dr4 , they found a significant correlation between average gas  phase metallicity and local galaxy density , such that more metal  rich galaxies favor regions of higher overdensity .",
    "along the blue cloud , this metallicity  density relation is comparable in strength to the well  known color  density relation . moreover , @xcite show that metallicity has a relationship with environment separate from that observed with color and luminosity ( or with stellar mass ) .",
    "phase metallicity is somewhat unique in this regard , as other galaxy properties ( e.g. , surface brightness , srsic index , or stellar mass ) that are strongly correlated with overdensity do not show a relationship with environment separate from that observed with color and luminosity @xcite .    in order for the results in  [ sec_results ] to be due to either of these observed correlations between environment and metallicity ( either stellar or gas  phase ) , the blue sn host galaxies must be biased towards lower stellar or gas  phase metallicities than the comparison galaxy samples . as discussed above , however , we are unable to directly test for any potential bias in our supernova samples , due to the lack of metallicity information ( both stellar and gas  phase ) for the majority of the hosts . given the low signal  to  noise of the sdss spectra , reliable metallicity measures are not feasible . without direct constraints on the metallicities of the sdss host galaxies , our results regarding the environments of sne ia in star  forming galaxies could still ( at least partially ) be understood in terms of a metallicity effect if the luminosity or the rate of type ia events depends on metallicity , such that intrinsically brighter supernovae arise from more metal  poor progenitors or such that the type ia rate is elevated in metal  poor host galaxies .",
    "however , recent observational work by @xcite , studying sne ia in a relatively large sample @xmath172 of star  forming and quiescent host galaxies at @xmath173 , suggests that variation in gas  phase metallicity only accounts for a small portion @xmath174 of the measured dispersion in type ia luminosities ( see figures 5 , 7 , and 11 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . a variety of previous studies ( e.g. , * ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , using both gas  phase and stellar metallicity estimates , also found no significant evidence for a correlation between metallicity and the properties of sne ia . with that said , whether low ",
    "metallicity stars might yield more luminous type ia events is still a relatively poorly constrained question .",
    "for example , the gas  phase metallicity estimates employed by @xcite are derived from using measurements of the hosts stellar masses to estimate the oxygen abundances according to the median mass  metallicity relation for nearby star  forming systems @xcite .",
    "this method is applied even to those systems thought to be quiescent and are thus not included in the analysis of @xcite .",
    "future observations , yielding direct oxygen abundance measurements , are needed to better determine the relationship between metallicity and type ia luminosity .    while the luminosities of type ia sne show no significant correlation with metallicity , our observations of supernova environments",
    "could also be explained by an increase in the sn ia rate in metal  poor hosts . from an observational standpoint ,",
    "the dependence of the type ia rate on host metallicity remains unconstrained , with current supernova samples including precision metallicity measurements for only a small portion of the host population .",
    "still , recent observational studies show that a considerable number of type ia supernovae have been found in low ",
    "metallicity galaxies @xcite . on the other hand , observations of type ia supernovae in nearby , star  forming galaxies with significantly enriched interstellar media are evidence that the sn ia rate is not zero in the metal  rich regime ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , theoretical models of supernovae suggest that the type ia rate depends significantly on metallicity , such that the rate is lower in galaxies with lower metallicities ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * but also see @xcite ) . this theoretical metallicity effect , however , works counter to that which would explain our observations of supernova and galaxy environments , making our results regarding the environments of type ia sne in star  forming systems even more remarkable . with that said ,",
    "the theoretical models are generally constrained on a limited basis , being forced to match observations of chemical evolution in the solar neighborhood .    in spite of the theoretical predictions regarding the dependence of the sn ia rate on metallicity",
    ", our results appear to be most easily understood in terms of a gas  phase metallicity effect , where prompt sne ia preferentially arise from metal  poor progenitors .",
    "in particular , the sharp cut  off in the observed distribution of environments for sne ia in blue hosts could be the result of a sharp feature in the metallicity distribution of the prompt sne ia progenitor population , such that prompt type ia events rarely result from the evolution of relatively metal  rich stars .",
    "this picture is supported ( though circumstantially ) by several key points .",
    "first , the bias in the galaxy environment distribution for sne ia in star  forming systems towards underdense regions is likely attributable to the prompt ( versus delayed ) component of the type ia population , since delayed sne are seen in both star  forming and quiescent galaxies and we find no evidence for any dependence of the type ia rate on environment within red , non  star  forming galaxies .",
    "furthermore , weak evidence exists @xcite to suggest that the sn ia rate is actually higher among elliptical galaxies in clusters versus the field , which would work counter to the trend we observe in star  forming hosts , thereby suggesting that delayed and prompt sne ia have opposing relationships with galaxy environment , such that prompt events , which dominate in the star  forming galaxy population , favor low  density environs and delayed events , which comprise all of the sne observed in quiescent systems , are preferentially found in high  density environs .",
    "there are two significant reasons that gas  phase metallicity ( and not another galaxy property such as stellar metallicity or age ) is likely driving our observational results .",
    "as discussed above , the prompt sn ia component is correlated with star formation and thus thought to result from the evolution of more massive stars ( perhaps with masses of @xmath175 ) .",
    "for this reason , the metallicity of the progenitor population is more likely to be connected to the gas  phase metallicity and not stellar metallicity .",
    "in addition , in our analysis , we compare the environments of our sn host galaxies to samples of galaxies with matched rest ",
    "frame color , luminosity , stellar mass , and star  formation rate distributions .",
    "* thus , for our results to be connected to a particular physical property , then that property must have a relationship with environment separate from that observed with color and luminosity ( or stellar mass or star  formation rate ) within the star  forming population .",
    "phase metallicity is the only galaxy characteristic known to have such a relationship with environment @xcite . * as discussed in more detail in the appendix , stellar metallicity shows no relationship with environment separate from that observed with color and luminosity along the blue cloud .",
    "moreover , even though type ia luminosities may depend on stellar age in some systems ( e.g. , early  type systems , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we also find that luminosity  weighted mean stellar age exhibits no significant correlation with environment at fixed color and luminosity among the star  forming population ( see appendix ) .    while our results appear to be the manifestation of a metallicity bias in our supernova host samples relative to the comparison galaxy samples , such that the hosts are more metal  poor and the type ia rate ( or luminosity ) is higher at lower metallicity , the exact physical explanation for why the sn ia rate ( or luminosity ) would be elevated at low metallicities remains unaddressed .",
    "one possible explanation for an increase in the sn ia rate would be variation in the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) with metallicity .",
    "however , measurements of the imf in nearby star ",
    "forming regions show that it does not depend on metallicity down to very low masses ( @xmath176 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , there is no observational evidence to suggest that the imf varies with galaxy environment ; instead , the stellar imf is generally thought to be universal ( at least locally , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    alternatively , a decrease in the sn ia rate with metallicity could be attributed to metallicity  dependent variation in the binary fraction . within the standard model for type ia supernovae ,",
    "an increase in the binary fraction should lead to an increase in the sn rate .",
    "however , there is no evidence to suggest that the binary fraction shows any variation with metallicity ( or environment ) across a broad range of metallicities in the local universe ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* but see also @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , type ia supernovae might not result solely from the evolution of binary systems . as discussed in more detail by @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "our knowledge of type ia supernova progenitors is quite poor , and a `` single  star '' sn ia channel could help explain some observations of type ia events that remain poorly understood within the standard binary  driven model .    finally ,",
    "as highlighted throughout this paper , our results are also consistent with an increase in the type ia luminosity ( rather than an increase in the rate ) at low metallicities . while some early one  dimensional simulations of type ia explosions suggested that there is a positive ( or perhaps no ) correlation between metallicity and type ia luminosity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , more recent theoretical analysis spanning a broader range of metallicities support a picture in which more metal  poor progenitors yield more luminous type ia events @xcite .",
    "in particular , the analytical work of @xcite concludes that the peak luminosity of type ia events is anti  correlated with the metallicity of the progenitor , such that the @xmath177ni mass , a proxy for luminosity @xcite , produced in a type ia event decreases linearly with increasing metallicity  i.e. , luminosity depends roughly linearly on the gas  phase metallicity in the case of supernovae with short delay times , where the current gas ",
    "phase metallicity reflects the stellar metallicity of the progenitor .",
    "so , while there is currently no observational evidence for a correlation between type ia luminosity and gas  phase metallicity within star  forming host galaxies ( i.e. , among prompt sne ia , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , there is theoretical support to suggest that our results could be understood in terms of a luminosity effect in lieu of a bias in the type ia rate .",
    "in this paper , we present an analysis of the large  scale environments of type ia supernovae in the local @xmath178 universe , using data drawn from the sdss  ii supernova survey and from the sdss dr6 database .",
    "we estimate the local overdensity about each galaxy according to the projected fifth ",
    "nearest  neighbor surface density . for a range of supernova host galaxy subsamples , we define comparison galaxy subsamples , selected to match the color , luminosity , and redshift or stellar mass , star  formation rate , and redshift of the hosts . using a variety of statistical tests , we then compare the distribution of environments for the supernova hosts and the comparison galaxies .",
    "our principal results are as follows .    1 .",
    "we find that type ia supernovae in blue ( i.e. , star  forming ) host galaxies tend to reside in low ",
    "density environments relative to galaxies of similar stellar mass and star  formation rate ( or similar rest ",
    "frame color and luminosity ) .",
    "this analysis represents the first constraint on the environment dependence of the sn ia rate in star  forming systems .",
    "we find no difference between the environment distributions of red host galaxies and galaxies of like stellar mass and star  formation rate , within the observational uncertainties .",
    "this result is in some contrast to recent observational work by @xcite , which found a sn ia rate more than @xmath137 higher in local cluster ellipticals relative to field ellipticals , though within the errors of each measurement .",
    "while our sample sizes are still somewhat small ( @xmath179 ia events in red hosts ) , tests on simulated galaxy catalogs suggest that the distribution of environments for red , sn ia hosts presented herein is in poor agreement with a cluster sn ia rate as strongly elevated relative to the field rate as @xcite find .",
    "we find a strong cut  off , at @xmath180 , in the observed distribution of environments for type ia supernovae in star",
    " forming galaxies .",
    "statistical tests show that such a strong cut  off in overdensities is likely to result from a type ia sn rate that is @xmath111 higher within star  forming galaxies in low ",
    "density environments relative to like systems in more overdense regions .",
    "we conclude that variation in gas  phase metallicity is the most likely explanation for the observed difference between the environments of type ia sne in star  forming galaxies and galaxies with like color , luminosity , stellar mass , and star  formation rate ;",
    "type ia events are more luminous or more numerous in metal  poor galaxies . given existing observational constraints , which indicate a lack of type ia luminosity dependence on metallicity , our analysis suggests that prompt type ia events preferentially result from the evolution of relatively metal  poor stars ( i.e. , have a higher rate in metal  poor systems )",
    "theoretical models of exploding white dwarfs likely need to be revisited , since they predict a strong fall off in the type ia rate at low metallicity , while our observations unmistakably suggest the opposite effect for the prompt sn ia channel .",
