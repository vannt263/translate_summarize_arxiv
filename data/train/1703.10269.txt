    "random walk ( rw ) models provide a framework for the study of diffusion and other stochastic processes @xcite .",
    "these models were studied extensively on regular lattices and random networks .",
    "an rw can be considered as a particle which resides on the sites of the lattice or network , such that at each time step it hops randomly to one of the neighbors of its current site .",
    "random walks on lattices provide a discrete spatio - temporal description of diffusion processes in the euclidean space . in the large - scale and long - time limit , the evolution of the spatial probability distribution of an rw can be described by the diffusion equation , while at small scales , the discreteness of the lattice plays an important role . unlike a ballistic particle which moves in a fixed direction at a constant speed , an rw picks a random direction at each time step . as a result , the mean distance reached by an rw from its initial location scales like @xmath2 , compared to @xmath3 for a ballistic particle , where @xmath3 is the elapsed time .",
    "more precisely , the probability distribution of an rw starting at the origin of a regular lattice in @xmath4 dimensions follows a gaussian distribution , whose standard deviation scales like @xmath2 , for any finite dimension , @xmath4 .",
    "rws maintain no memory in the sense that the probability distribution of the next move depends only on the current state of the system .",
    "therefore , they satisfy the markovian condition and can be studied using the methodologies developed for markovian processes @xcite .",
    "rw problems are commonly posed as initial value problems , in which the initial conditions are specified and the task is to calculate the spatial probability distribution at a later time .",
    "however , in an alternative setting called first passage problems , one is interested in questions like how long it will take for the rw to reach a given location for the first time @xcite . the general problem is to calculate the distribution of first passage times for the given setting , or properties of the distribution such as the mean first passage time .",
    "an rw on a lattice hops randomly at each time step to one of the nearest neighbors of its current site . in some of the steps it hops into new sites which have not been visited before .",
    "in other steps it hops into previously visited sites .",
    "the mean number of distinct sites , @xmath5 , visited up to time @xmath3 is thus smaller than @xmath3 .",
    "it was shown that in one dimension @xmath6 , in two dimensions @xmath7 , while in three and more dimensions @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "it was recently shown that on er networks , the number of distinct nodes visited up to time @xmath3 scales linearly with @xmath3 @xcite , resembling the results obtained for rws on high dimensional lattices . on finite networks other interesting quantities emerge , such as the mean first passage time between a random pair of nodes @xcite and the mean cover time , namely the average number of steps required for the rw to visit all the nodes in the network @xcite .",
    "an important time scale which appears in random walks on networks is the _ first hitting time _ , also referred to as the first intersection length @xcite .",
    "this time scale emerges in a class of rw models in which the rw keeps hopping until it enters a node which it has already visited before or becomes trapped in a node from which it can not exit . at this point the path",
    "is terminated , as is the case in a large class of processes called first passage problems @xcite . the resulting path length , namely the number of time steps up to its termination ,",
    "is called the first hitting time . in ref .",
    "@xcite we presented analytical results for the distribution of first hitting times of rws on undirected erds - rnyi ( er ) networks @xcite .",
    "on undirected networks , the rw path may terminate either by backtracking into the previous node or by retracing itself , namely stepping into a node which was already visited two or more time steps earlier . by calculating the probabilities of these two scenarios",
    ", we obtained analytical results for the distribution of first hitting times of rws on er networks .",
    "another interesting time scale is the _ last hitting time _",
    "@xcite of a self avoiding walk ( saw ) @xcite , which does not retrace its path but may be trapped once it enters a node which does not have any yet unvisited neighbors . in ref .",
    "@xcite we presented analytical results for the distribution of last hitting times of saws on undirected er networks .",
    "most of the networks encountered in physical , chemical , biological , technological and social systems are directed networks .",
    "therefore , it is important to study diffusive processes on directed networks and the rw is the simplest dynamical model describing such processes .",
    "the dynamical properties of rws on directed networks are different from those of rws on undirected networks . in undirected networks",
    "each rw path between node @xmath9 and node @xmath10 may be pursued in both directions . in directed networks",
    "some pairs of nodes may be connected only in one direction and not in the other direction .",
    "even if nodes @xmath9 and @xmath10 are connected in both directions , the paths in opposite directions are not the same .",
    "while undirected networks exhibit a single degree distribution , @xmath11 , directed networks exhibit two distinct degree distributions , namely the distribution of in - degrees , @xmath12 , and the distribution of out - degrees , @xmath13 .",
    "the two distributions must have the same mean , namely @xmath14 .",
    "while in undirected networks the frequency in which an rw visits a node , @xmath9 , is simply proportional to its degree , @xmath15 , in directed networks such visit frequencies depend not only on the in - degree @xmath16 but on the overall structure of the surrounding network .",
    "finally , directed networks exhibit dead - end nodes which have incoming links but no outgoing links . as a result , rws which enter such nodes becomes trapped .",
    "in this paper we present analytical results for the distribution of first hitting times of rws on _ directed _ er networks @xcite . in these networks each pair of nodes , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , are connected , with probability @xmath17 by a directed link from @xmath9 to @xmath10 , and independently , with the same probability , by a directed link from @xmath10 to @xmath9 .",
    "we also calculate the mean , median and standard deviation of the distribution of first hitting times .",
    "the results are found to be in excellent agreement with numerical simulations .",
    "unlike the case of undirected networks in which backtracking moves are always possible , on directed networks backtracking may occur only when the current node and the previous node are connected in both directions .",
    "moreover , on a directed network an rw may become trapped in a dead - end node which does not have any outgoing links . as a result , an rw path on a directed er network may terminate either by trapping or by retracing its path .",
    "we obtain analytical results for the overall probabilities , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , that an rw starting from a random node will terminate by trapping or by retracing , respectively .",
    "it is found that in dilute networks most paths terminate by trapping while in dense networks most paths terminate by retracing .",
    "we obtain expressions for the conditional probabilities , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , of rws which terminate by trapping or by retracing , respectively , as well for the conditional probabilities @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "it is found that the probability of termination by trapping decreases with the path length while the probability of termination by retracing increases with the path length . since most of the directed networks in nature exhibit different distributions of in - degrees and out - degrees",
    ", it is of interest to disentangle the effect of these distributions on the distribution of first hitting times . to this end , we extend our studies to a broader class of directed networks , referred to as semi - er networks , in which the in - degree distribution is poisson and the out - degrees follow any desired distribution with the same mean as the in - degree distribution .",
    "we present analytical results for the distribution of first hitting times in such networks .",
    "we also consider the distribution of last hitting times on directed er networks .",

    "3 we describe the random walk model on directed er networks . in sec .",

    "we obtain analytical expressions for two central measures ( mean and median ) and for a dispersion measure ( the standard deviation ) of this distribution . in sec .",
    "8 we calculate the distributions of path lengths conditioned on the termination mechanism . in sec .",
    "9 we generalize the analysis to directed semi - er networks , which exhibit a poisson in - degree distribution and any desired out - degree distribution .",
    "the results are summarized and discussed in sec .",
    "10 . in appendix",
    "a we present the detailed calculation of the contribution of the retracing mechanism to the distribution of first hitting times .",
    "the directed er network is the simplest model of a directed random network .",
    "it consists of @xmath24 nodes such that a directed edge , or link , from any node , @xmath9 , to any other node , @xmath10 , exists with probability @xmath17 , independently of the existence of the opposite link , or any other link .",
    "therefore , the probability that a random pair of nodes , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are connected in both directions is @xmath25 . in directed networks",
    "each node , @xmath9 has an in - degree , @xmath26 , which is the number of incoming links and an out - degree , @xmath27 , which is the number of outgoing links .",
    "in general one should distinguish between the degree distribution of incoming links , @xmath12 , and the degree distribution of outgoing links , @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "since each link is directed out of one node and into another node , the mean , @xmath28 , of @xmath12 must be equal to the mean , @xmath29 , of @xmath13 .",
    "in directed er networks , both distributions , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , are binomial distributions .",
    "therefore , in the sparse limit ( @xmath30 ) they are approximated by a poisson distribution of the form @xcite",
    "@xmath31    where the mean in - degree and the mean out - degree are given by @xmath32 .",
    "it is important to note that the in - degree and out - degree of each node are uncorrelated . also , there are no degree - degree correlations between adjacent nodes .",
    "the adjacency matrix , @xmath33 , of a directed er network of @xmath24 nodes is a random @xmath34 matrix with a zero diagonal and whose off - diagonal entries are @xmath35 with probability @xmath17 and @xmath36 with probability @xmath37 .",
    "note that unlike the undirected case , @xmath33 is not necessarily a symmetric matrix .",
    "the percolation properties of directed er networks differ from those of their undirected counterparts @xcite .",
    "undirected er networks exhibit a percolation transition at @xmath38 , above which the network consists of a giant cluster , small , isolated components and isolated nodes . on the giant cluster",
    ", every node can be reached from any other node .",
    "the percolation transition of a directed er network also takes place at @xmath38 , above which a giant cluster is formed .",
    "however , due to the directionality of the links , not all pairs of nodes on the giant cluster can be reached from each other along paths which consist of directed links .",
    "the subgraph of the giant cluster in which each pair of nodes can be reached from each other in both directions is called the giant strongly connected component ( gscc ) @xcite .",
    "the set of nodes on the giant cluster which can be reached from the gscc is called the out component , while the set of nodes from which the gscc can be reached is called the in component .",
    "in addition , there are some nodes on the giant cluster which do not belong either to the in component or to the out component .",
    "these nodes are referred to as tendrils @xcite .",
    "the probability of a random node in a directed er network to be an isolated node is @xmath39 . also , the probability of a random node to have only incoming links or only outgoing links is @xmath40 .",
    "a node which has only outgoing links can not be reached unless it is the initial node in the rw path .",
    "when the rw enters a node which has only incoming links , it becomes trapped and the rw path terminates .",
    "consider an rw on a directed random network of @xmath24 nodes .",
    "each time step the walker chooses randomly one of the outgoing edges of the current node , and hops along this edge to an adjacent node .",
    "the rw path terminates when it steps into a node which it has already visited before ( retracing scenario ) or when it enters a dead - end node which has only incoming links ( trapping scenario ) .",
    "the initial node is chosen randomly among the nodes for which the out - degree satisfies @xmath41 , so the rw is guaranteed to make at least one move .",
    "the resulting path length , @xmath0 , namely the number of steps pursued by the rw until its termination , is referred to as the first hitting time . in the analysis below we",
    "do not include the termination step itself as a part of the rw path .",
    "this means that the path length of an rw which pursued @xmath42 steps and terminated at the @xmath43 step is @xmath44 .",
    "the path includes @xmath45 nodes , since the initial node is also counted as a part of the path .",
    "consider an rw starting from a random node on a directed er network .",
    "the rw divides the network into two subnetworks : one consists of the already visited nodes and the other consists of the yet - unvisited nodes .",
    "after @xmath3 time steps the size of the subnetwork of visited nodes is @xmath46 ( including the initial node ) , while the size of the network of yet unvisited nodes is @xmath47 .",
    "here we focus on the subnetwork of the yet - unvisited nodes .",
    "its in - degree distribution and out - degree distribution evolve in time .",
    "we denote these distributions , at time @xmath3 , by @xmath48 , and @xmath49 , @xmath50 , respectively , where @xmath51 , which is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : poisson ] ) .",
    "the mean in and out degrees of this subnetwork , which are given by    @xmath52    and    @xmath53    evolve accordingly .",
    "since the number of incoming links is equal to the number of outgoing links , the mean degrees of the two distributions must satisfy @xmath54 , and are denoted by @xmath55 .",
    "we now examine the evolution of the subnetwork of the yet - unvisited nodes in terms of the mean numbers of incoming and outgoing links which are removed at each step . deleting a node along",
    "the rw path removes , on average , @xmath55 incoming links and @xmath55 outgoing links from the node itself as well as @xmath55 incoming links and @xmath55 outgoing links from its neighbors , which remain on the subnetwork of the yet - unvisited nodes . denoting the initial in - degree and out - degree of node @xmath9 , by @xmath56 and @xmath57",
    ", respectively we note that @xmath58 .",
    "thus , the time dependence of the mean degree can be expressed by    @xmath59    this implies that @xmath55 obeys the recursion equation    @xmath60    in which the coefficient on the right hand side depends on @xmath3 .",
    "this equation is solved by    @xmath61    for rws on directed random networks , there is a higher probability for the walker to enter nodes with high incoming degrees .",
    "more precisely , the probability that in the next time step the rw will step into a node of in - degree @xmath62 is @xmath63 .",
    "however , by the time the rw enters the next node , the previous node is effectively deleted , together with the edge connecting the two nodes .",
    "therefore , when the walker enters a node of in - degree @xmath62 , the in - degree of this node is reduced to @xmath64 .",
    "a special property of the poisson distribution is that @xmath65 .",
    "this means that the probability that the node visited at time @xmath46 will be of degree @xmath62 is given by @xmath66 .",
    "the outcome of this reasoning is that the probability of the rw to visit a node of in - degree @xmath62 in the smaller network at time @xmath3 is simply @xmath48 , as if it makes a random choice of a node in the smaller network .",
    "the result of this exact , yet delicate , balance is that the subnetwork of the yet - unvisited nodes at time @xmath3 , is a directed er network with mean in and out degrees equal to @xmath55 , as well as degree distributions , @xmath67 and @xmath68 , given by    @xmath69    it is interesting to note that a similar result is also obtained for undirected er networks @xcite .",
    "the paths pursued by the rws studied here are , in fact , segments of saw paths . in case of termination by trapping the rw path is identical to an saw path , while in case of termination by retracing the rw path consists of the initial segment of a longer saw path .",
    "therefore , the distribution of first hitting times is bounded from above by the distribution of path lengths of saws on the same networks , also referred to as the last hitting times .",
    "below we present analytical results for the distribution of last hitting times . consider an saw on an er network , which starts from a random node , @xmath9 , with an out - degree @xmath70 .",
    "the saw hops through directed links between adjacent nodes until it reaches a node from which it can not exit . at that stage",
    "the path terminates .",
    "the out - degree of node @xmath9 in the subnetwork of the yet - unvisited nodes , at time @xmath3 , is given by @xmath71 .",
    "the termination of an saw path occurs when it enters a node for which @xmath72 .",
    "the probability that a random node does not have outgoing links in the subnetwork of the yet - unvisited nodes at time @xmath3 is @xmath73 .",
    "the conditional probability that the saw will proceed from time @xmath3 to time @xmath46 without being trapped is denoted by @xmath74 , where @xmath0 represents the random variable of the path length and @xmath3 represents its actual value .",
    "this conditional probability is given by @xmath75 .",
    "thus , the probability that the path length of the saw will be longer than @xmath42 , also known as the tail distribution , is given by    @xmath76    the probability @xmath77 since the initial node is chosen randomly among the nodes for which @xmath41 .",

    ", width=302 ]    for the sake of completeness , we briefly summarize the properties of first hitting times of rws on undirected er networks . the conditional probability associated with the retracing scenario of rws on undirected er networks",
    "is given by    @xmath267    this probability is somewhat larger than the result for directed er networks , given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : p_r2 ] ) . however , the main difference between the distributions of first hitting times in the directed and undirected er networks is the fact that on directed networks the backtracking scenario does not exist .",
    "the conditional probability associated with the backtracking scenario for rws on undirected er networks is given by @xcite    @xmath268    thus , backtracking is an important termination scenario , particularly for sparse networks . unlike the case of undirected networks ,",
    "in directed er networks the backtracking scenario does not exist because the backwards link to the previous node exists only with probability @xmath17 , namely it is as likely as a link to any other node .",
    "however , another termination scenario emerges .",
    "this is the trapping scenario , which occurs when the rw enters a dead - end node which does not have any outgoing link and becomes trapped in that node .",
    "it turns out that the trapping scenario in directed er networks is much less likely to happen than the backtracking scenario in the corresponding undirected er network . the conditional probability associated with the trapping scenario for rws",
    "on directed er networks is given by    @xmath269    note that both the backtracking and trapping probabilities do not depend on time .",
    "however , their dependencies on the mean degree , @xmath124 is very different from each other . while the backtracking probability essentially decreases as @xmath270 , the trapping probability decreases exponentially with @xmath124 .",
    "therefore , the trapping mechanism is much less likely to occur and so the paths of rws on directed er networks are much longer than on a corresponding undirected networks with the same value of @xmath124 .    the properties of rws on directed er networks resemble those of non - backtracking rws ( nbws ) on undirected er networks @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that in both cases the termination of the rw path by the backtracking scenario is suppressed . in fig .",
    "[ fig:9 ] we also show the tail distribution of nbws on undirected er networks ( dotted line ) .",
    "indeed , it is found to be very similar to the tail distribution of rws on directed er networks . however , the tail distribution of the nbws is shifted slightly to the right compared to the tail distribution of the corresponding rw on a directed er network .",
    "this is due to the fact that the probability of retracing is slightly lower for the nbw compared to the rw on a directed er network .",
    "more precisely , for an nbw on an undirected er network the probability of retracing at the @xmath46 time step is given by @xmath271/(c+1)$ ] , compared to @xmath271/c$ ] for an rw on a directed er networks .",
    "for completeness , we also show in fig .",
    "[ fig:9 ] the distribution of last hitting times of saws on directed er networks ( dashed - dotted lines ) , obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : tail2 ] ) .",
    "as expected , the last hitting times are much longer than the first hitting times .",
    "we performed a detailed analysis of the probabilities , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , that the termination will take place via the trapping or via the retracing mechanism , respectively .",
    "we obtained analytical expressions for these probabilities in terms of the network size , @xmath24 , and the mean degree , @xmath124 .",
    "we also obtained analytical expressions for the conditional distributions of the path lengths , @xmath184 and @xmath185 for the paths which terminate by trapping or by retracing , respectively .",
    "finally , we obtained analytical expressions for the conditional probabilities @xmath204 and @xmath205 that a path which terminates after @xmath42 steps is terminated by trapping or by retracing , respectively .",
    "it was found that the two termination mechanisms exhibit very different behavior . since the initial node is chosen to be a node with at least one outgoing link , the trapping probability sets in starting from the second step .",
    "the trapping probability is constant throughout the path . as a result",
    ", the trapping mechanism alone would produce a geometric distribution of path lengths .",
    "the retracing mechanism also sets in starting from the second step and its rate increases linearly in time .",
    "the balance between the two termination mechanisms depends on the mean degree of the network . in the limit of sparse networks , the trapping mechanism is dominant and most paths are terminated long before the retracing mechanism becomes relevant . in the case of dense networks ,",
    "the trapping probability is low and most paths terminate by the retracing mechanism . these results provide useful insight into the general problem of survival analysis and the statistics of mortality or failure rates , under conditions in which two or more failure mechanisms coexist @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the approach developed in this paper applies not only to er networks but also to directed semi - er networks in which the in - degree distribution is a poisson distribution while the out - degrees may follow any desired distribution which has the same mean , @xmath124 , as the in - degree distribution . to demonstrate this result we presented the tail distribution , @xmath81 , for directed semi - er networks with degenerate ( regular ) , power - law ( scale free ) and exponential out - degree distributions . it was shown that the rate of termination by retracing is determined by the poisson in - degree distribution , which controls the temporal evolution of @xmath55 .",
    "the rate of termination by trapping is determined by the out - degree distribution , or more specifically by the probability @xmath256 that a randomly chosen node will have no outgoing link .",
    "in a broader context , the distributions of first hitting times and last hitting times of rws are examples of a broad class of distributions of path lengths and first passage times in random networks @xcite .",
    "a related distribution , which provides useful information on the underlying structure of the network , is the distribution of shortest path lengths between random pairs of nodes @xcite .",
    "examples of such distributions involving rws are the distribution of first passage times between random pairs of nodes @xcite and the distribution of cover times @xcite .",
    "we expect the methodologies developed in this paper to be useful for the study of other structural and dynamical distributions in random networks .",
    "in this appendix we present the detailed evaluation of @xmath136 . taking the logarithm of @xmath136 , as expressed in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cond6 ] ) , we obtain                  in approximating the sum of eq .",
    "( [ eq : pret_sum ] ) by the integral of eq .",
    "( [ eq : pret_int ] ) we have used the formulation of the middle riemann sum . since the function @xmath276 $ ] is a monotonically decreasing function , the value of the integral is over - estimated by the left riemann sum , @xmath87 , and under - estimated by the right riemann sum , @xmath88 . the error involved in this approximation",
    "is thus bounded by the difference @xmath89 , which satisfies @xmath277 .",
    "thus , the relative error in @xmath136 due to the approximation of the sum by an integral is bounded by @xmath91 . comparing the values obtained from the sum and the integral over a broad range of parameters ,",
    "we find that the pre - factor of the error is very small , so in practice the error introduced by approximation of the sum by an integral is negligible ."
