    "the interacting one - dimensional ( 1d ) quantum system @xcite can be described by a low - energy effective theory , so - called luttinger liquid theory @xcite .  for spinful systems",
    ", one has spin - charge separation but both possess power - law decay of correlation functions .",
    "an interesting regime is spin - incoherent luttinger liquid ( sill ) @xcite when the temperature is larger than the spin excitation energy while smaller than the charge excitation one .",
    "the exponential factor in the single - particle green s function of sill puts itself in a different universal class from the luttinger liquid , and rich physics appears due to the highly degenerate spin hamiltonian .  the semiconductor quantum wire can be a platform to reach sill regime .  in this regime",
    "the spin hamiltonian becomes irrelevant and negligible in the correlation functions that the spin degrees of freedom are non - propagating @xcite .",
    "the spin - charge separation still holds simply because the charge velocity is much larger than the spin velocity .  in this paper",
    "we consider the interacting 1d bose gas @xcite in the spin - incoherent regime .",
    "the dispersion relation of the density mode in a spin-1 bose gas is linear @xcite , which is the same as the collective charge excitations in the electronic spin-@xmath2 system .",
    "as we will explain later , the spin velocity is much less than the sound velocity , therefore we also have the spin - incoherent regime if the temperature is higher than the spin excitation energy .",
    "we expect that the spin - incoherent 1d bose gas is even better to demonstrate sill physics due to the controllability of spatial dimensions and atom - atom interactions .",
    "the strongly interacting and spinless bosonic particles have been experimentally realized in 1d tightly confined systems @xcite .",
    "these hard - core bosons become fermionized in the tonks - girardeau ( tg ) @xcite gas limit that corresponds to infinitely strong atom - atom interaction , and is one of the few examples that have the exact solutions .  in this",
    "limit their wavefunctions can be written down from the constraints that bosons are impenetrable and of bosonic symmetry .  in the past two decades",
    "many investigations along this line involve the ground state properties of 1d hard - core bosons @xcite and strongly interacting bose - fermi mixtures @xcite in a harmonic trap , the momentum distribution @xcite , quantum magnetism in 1d spinor bose gas @xcite , and using group theoretical methods in studying the ground states of spin-@xmath2 fermions @xcite and the permutation symmetry of spinor quantum gases @xcite .",
    "the experimental measurements of such quantum systems rely on the matter wave interferences , for example , the time - of - flight experiment using the focusing technique @xcite , and the bragg scattering spectroscopy @xcite .  in this paper",
    "we investigate the ground state properties of a 1d spin-1 bose gas in sill regime that has not been studied before , and we numerically calculate the momentum distributions that can be observed in experiments .",
    "we note that the momentum distributions of spin-@xmath2 bosons and fermions in sill regime have been investigated in a homogeneous system @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .  in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the hamiltonian of 1d spin-1 bose gas and the general wavefunction with spin degree of freedom .  in sec .",
    "iii , we consider 1d spin-1 bose gas in tg limit .",
    "we derive the general form of density matrix with spin function overlaps assisted by the conjugacy classes of the permutation groups .",
    "an analytical derivation of large momentum asymptotic is demonstrated in sec .",
    "iv , and we show the numerically calculated momentum distributions in sec .",
    "v.  we conclude in sec .",
    "vi , and the appendix has the technical details of the traces of various group elements which are used in determining the spin function overlaps .",
    "starting from the hamiltonian of ultracold spin-1 bose gas in one dimension at zero magnetic field @xcite , h&=&_i=1^n_spin + & + & _ i < j(x_i - x_j ) , where @xmath3 is the spin operator , @xmath4 is the identity operator in spin space , @xmath5 is the mass of the bosons , @xmath6 is the axial trap frequency , and @xmath7 are the coupling constants of spin - independent and spin - dependent interactions respectively .  for a highly elongated trap ,",
    "the transverse trap frequency ( @xmath8 ) is much larger than @xmath6 that the coupling constants effectively are @xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath11 with @xmath12 @xmath10 @xmath13 , and @xmath14 @xmath10 @xmath15 , where @xmath16 @xmath10 @xmath17 $ ] @xcite with s - wave scattering lengths @xmath18 , and @xmath19 @xmath10 @xmath20 @xcite .     in tg gas limit of scalar bosons ,",
    "the system becomes fermionized that bosons do not penetrate each other , and their wavefunctions take the form of noninteracting fermions .  for a spin-1 bose gas with an infinite atom - atom interaction @xmath21 in a harmonic trap ,",
    "we consider a sill regime @xcite where the spin exchange energy is much less than @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath24 is the temperature of the system , while the temperature is low enough that the system still occupies the orbitals in the lowest energy .",
    "the regime in general can be reached since @xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath27 for @xmath28na , @xmath29k , and @xmath30rb that the interaction becomes effectively spin - independent .",
    "for example of @xmath30rb in the hyperfine state of @xmath31 @xmath10 @xmath32 , @xmath27 @xmath10 @xmath33 and @xmath25 @xmath10 @xmath34 @xmath35 @xcite where @xmath35 is bohr radius",
    ".  the wavefunction in general can be expressed as     finally we demonstrate the details for the construction of conjugacy classes and the calculation of the traces in the class .",
    "take four bosons in the symmetric group @xmath36 for example , the classification of the conjugacy classes of @xmath37 can be derived by a cycle decomposition that counts the number of unordered integer partitions .",
    "we then decompose four bosons as & & 4 ,  3 + 1 ,  2 + 2 ,  2 + 1 + 1 ,  1 + 1 + 1 + 1 , + & &  p_1234 ,  p_123 ,  p_12p_34 ,  p_12 ,  e , which accounts for five conjugacy classes .",
    "the size of each conjugacy class can be calculated as @xmath38 where we have @xmath39 s integer of @xmath40 in the unordered integer partitions .",
    "this calculation of the size can be also seen as @xmath41 permutations with @xmath39 times of @xmath40 s cycling and @xmath39 permutations of the groups @xmath42 , @xmath43 , etc .",
    "take @xmath44 of @xmath41 @xmath10 @xmath45 as an example where we have three classes , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 , that have nonvanishing traces .",
    "their traces in this basis are @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath50 respectively with the sizes @xmath32 , @xmath49 , and @xmath51 .  therefore the identity relation reads _",
    "gtr_(g)=61 + 26 + 23=4 ! , where the traces are verified .     for the final demonstration of the identity relations in the symmetric group @xmath52 ,",
    "the classification of the conjugacy classes becomes & & 5 ,  4 + 1 ,  3 + 2 ,  3 + 1 + 1 ,  2 + 2 + 1 ,  2 + 1 + 1 + 1 , + & & 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 , + & & p_12345 ,  p_1234 ,  p_123p_45 ,  p_123 ,  p_12p_34 ,  p_12 ,  e , which accounts for seven conjugacy classes .",
    "we can verify the traces of each conjugacy classes by the identity relation .",
    "take @xmath53 of @xmath41 @xmath10 @xmath54 as an example , _",
    "gtr_(g ) = 201 + 610 + 220 = 5 ! , where the sizes of @xmath47 and @xmath55 are @xmath56 and @xmath57 respectively .",
    "lastly for @xmath44 , we have _",
    "gtr_(g ) = 301 + 610 + 215 = 5 ! , where the size of @xmath58 belongs to @xmath48 and its trace is @xmath50 .",
    "the above examples show the identity relation between the total traces of the conjugacy classes and the order of @xmath37 .",
