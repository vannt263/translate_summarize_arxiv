    "launching of relativistic outflows from inner regions of an accretion disc is one the basic predictions of the standard theory of disc accretion for specific regimes when radiation alone is not efficient enough to carry away all the liberated potential energy of the in - falling matter @xcite .",
    "although there are numerous indications of such outflows both in x - ray binary systems ( xrb ) and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , their actual composition ( leptonic or baryonic ) as well as the corresponding launching mechanisms ( magnetic field vs. radiation pressure driven ) still remain unclear ( @xcite ; see also @xcite and @xcite for recent reviews in the context of xrbs and agn , respectively ) . while leptonic models are typically successful in describing the observed emission as having a primarily synchrotron origin , the existence of some baryonic loading is also frequently invoked to explain the high jet kinetic power required to produce and maintain large - scale cavities or cocoons associated with xrbs and agns @xcite .",
    "the main evidence for the existence of baryonic jets comes , however , from the outstanding galactic x - ray binary system ss 433 , whose x - ray emission is marked by pairs of oppositely doppler - shifted ( @xmath3 ) lines of highly ionised heavy elements on top of the thermal bremsstrahlung continuum with @xmath4 kev @xcite , while its optical emission also bears similar signatures of doppler - shifted lines of hydrogen and helium ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these peculiar properties are attributed to a pair of strongly collimated ( the half - opening angle @xmath5 ) , mildly - relativistic ( the bulk velocity @xmath6 ) precessing jets of ordinary highly ionised plasma with almost solar abundance of elements ( see @xcite for a review ) . according to the standard multi - temperature model , the x - ray jets first become visible",
    "when their temperature is @xmath7 kev and then cool below @xmath8 kev as a result of adiabatic expansion , which allows a number of ionization stages of various elements to contribute to the net observed spectrum @xcite .    by now , ss 433 remains as prominent as unique , with no other source known to unequivocally demonstrate the presence of baryonic jets .",
    "recently , @xcite claimed the detection of a pair of doppler - shifted lines of h - like iron in the spectrum of 4u 1630 - 47 .",
    "these lines , however , were not detected in subsequent observations by @xcite .",
    "another promising opportunity comes from observations of ultra - luminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) , at least some of which are believed to be ss 433-like systems , observed nearly face - on @xcite ( see e.g. an analysis of holmberg ii x-1 spectrum by @xcite ) . to look for the presence of baryonic jets in such cases , it is desirable to have a spectral model that would consistently predict the emergent x - ray spectrum for a broad range of jet parameters , and it is natural to build such a model based on the properties of the prototypical jets in ss 433 .",
    "plenty of high quality x - ray spectroscopic data is now available for ss 433 from the _ chandra _ @xcite , _ xmm - newton _ @xcite and _ suzaku _ @xcite observatories at various phases of precessional and orbital motion .",
    "however , the standard jet model usually fails to reproduce the observed complexity of the spectra ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "different ways have been proposed to eliminate the discrepancies , based on either adding some additional components @xcite or further elaboration of the standard model with the account for radiative cooling , radiation transfer effects and deviations from the coronal approximation ( @xcite ) .",
    "the level of sophistication of these models inevitably causes the loss of generality , making them hardly applicable to any other source that can potentially possess baryonic jets ( like galactic xrb 4u 1630 - 47@xcite , ulx holmberg ii x-1 @xcite , or candidate ss 433-analogues like s26 in ngc7793 @xcite and the unusual radio transient in m82 @xcite ) .",
    "here we present a model intended to serve as a missing link between the well - studied case of ss 433 and sources with suspected presence of baryonic jets . a compromise between generality and sophistication",
    "is achieved by i ) considering a rather broad range of jet parameters and ii ) modifying the standard multi - temperature jet model by self - consistently treating radiative cooling and taking into account flux redistribution in triplets of he - like ions due to collisional de - excitation ( while no account of radiative transfer effects and other possible deviations from the coronal approximation ( see @xcite ) is taken ) .",
    "section [ s : model ] describes this model in detail , while in section [ s : observ ] we discuss basic properties of the predicted spectra and their sensitivity to jet parameters . in section [ s : ss433 ] , the ability of the model to fit high - resolution spectroscopic data of ss 433 ( provided by @xmath2 hetgs ) is verified .",

    "since thermal instability is expected to evolve in the jet at @xmath62 kev @xcite , we consider only the hotter jet portion , i.e. @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the inverse function for @xmath60 , which exists due to monotonicity of the latter .",

    ", one may calculate the emergent spectrum using the differential emission measure distribution , which is derived from the density and temperature profiles as @xmath90 which is equivalent to @xmath91 in view of the results of the previous section , one immediately gets @xmath92 for an adiabatic jet , and @xmath93 for the @xmath87 case with bremsstrahlung - dominated energy losses .",
    "the characteristic shapes of the dem distribution are presented in fig.[f : demprof ] .    the result for @xmath87 may seem somewhat counter - intuitive recalling the very different shapes of the temperature profiles as a function of @xmath65 ( see e.g. fig.[f : tprof ] ) .",

    "convolution with the kernel @xmath109 describes spectrum smearing due to the residual velocity field present in a slice of constant temperature , which is assumed to be the same along the jet as long as deviations from ballistic flow pattern and optical depth effects are negligible . for small opening angles",

    "actually , it is @xmath125 that varies most significantly as a function of jet parameters .",
    "indeed , it is easy to find that @xmath126 by means of eq.([eq : demunitless ] ) , eq.([eq : demad ] ) and eq.([eq : demrad ] ) , this is elaborated into @xmath127 and @xmath128 for an adiabatic ( @xmath85 ) and radiatively - dominated ( @xmath129 ) jet respectively . on the other hand , @xmath130 is determined mainly by the _ shape _",
    "( and the starting point ) of the dem(t ) distribution , which varies rather gently with change of the parameters values ( see fig.[f : demprof ] ) .",
    "this is extremely useful for the technical implementation of the model , since the latter is essentially based on interpolation of spectra calculated for some ( preferably not very large ) grid of the parameters values ( see section [ ss : xspec ] ) .",
    "ratios of components in triplets of helium - like ions of heavy elements are commonly used as diagnostic tools for physical conditions in hot optically thin plasma ( see @xcite for a review ) . an attempt to take advantage of them in application to ss 433 jets was first made by @xcite , and then repeated by @xcite and @xcite . here",
    ", our aim is to allow the model to predict these ratios as a function of jet parameters in a significantly more self - consistent ( with the overall calculated emission ) manner .",
    "while the temperature dependence of the @xmath131 ratio ( hereafter @xmath132 stand for intensities of resonant , inter - combination and forbidden components , respectively ) is automatically accounted for by the ` apec ` model , the density dependence of the @xmath133 ratio due to damping of the forbidden component into the intercombination one is not incorporated in it . to improve on this aspect ,",
    "we extracted @xmath134 ratios is also slightly dependent on @xmath135 : @xmath136 , @xmath137 is the value of @xmath138 in the low - density limit , and the critical density @xmath139 marks the point when the collisional de - excitation time from the upper level of the forbidden line equals the corresponding radiative transition time ( e.g. @xcite ) . ] for those ions from the ` chianti ` database ( version 7.1.4 , @xcite ) that are most relevant for the problem in hand .",
    "we then used these ratios to correct the intensities of forbidden and intercombination lines predicted by the ` apec ` model for a given portion of the jet .",
    "this procedure was performed for helium - like neon ( @xmath140 kev , @xmath141 kev , @xmath142 kev ) , silicon ( @xmath143 kev , @xmath144 kev , @xmath145 kev ) , sulphur ( @xmath146 kev , @xmath147 kev , @xmath148 kev ) and iron ( @xmath149 kev , @xmath150 kev , @xmath151 kev ) ( see also a more detailed list in @xcite ) .",
    "these lines are the most promising for diagnostic purposes , since they are expected to be sufficiently bright under the circumstances we are interested in and probe the useful range of electron densities @xcite .    because jet emission in a given line originates for some range of temperatures and densities ( see e.g. fig.4 in @xcite ) ,",
    "drawing any direct conclusions regarding the jet parameters from the line ratios is fairly challenging ( see section [ s : ss433 ] and fig.[f : triplets ] there ) , and they actually are intended to be used only in combination with the overall predicted emission .",
    "one should also be aware of the fact that the @xmath138 ratio is sensitive to uv illumination of the radiating gas , owing to the possibility of excitement of an electron from the upper level of the forbidden transition to the upper level of the intercombination transition by a uv photon @xcite .",
    "this might be of particular relevance to ss 433-like sources @xcite , possessing an uv - bright supercritical accretion disc @xcite .",
    "the set of jet parameters exploited above @xmath152 not only provides a fairly natural description of the physical model , but also allows a lucid calculation of the emergent x - ray spectrum .",
    "however , it turns out that both its normalisation and shape are actually determined almost solely by some combinations of these parameters or their functions ( like @xmath53 and @xmath125 ) .",
    "besides that , there must be some limitations on the parameter values arising from validity of the assumptions made .",
    "finally , since technical implementation of the model is based on interpolation of spectra calculated on some sufficiently dense grid of parameter values , it is important to construct such a grid that it would cover the relevant domain of the parameter space as efficiently as possible ( e.g. with minimal number of irrelevant points ) .",
    "below we introduce a modification to the original set of parameters aimed to address these issues .",
    "a crucial assumption of the previous consideration is that every jet slice is optically thin .",
    "this makes it possible for the radiative cooling term in the thermal balance equation eq.([eq : cooling ] ) to be formulated in terms of the optically thin emissivity function @xmath153 , so that the net spectrum can be found by integration over the corresponding dem distribution ( eq.([eq : demspec ] ) ) .",
    "the validity of this assumption is determined by the _",
    "_ optical depth at the jet base with respect to electron scattering @xmath154 since we are safely in the thomson limit ( @xmath155 ) .",
    "obviously , the transversal optical depth decreases as @xmath156 , so the condition @xmath157 at the jet base ensures that @xmath158 is less than unity everywhere along the jet .",
    "moreover , even if there is a visible part of the jet with @xmath159 , its emission will be suppressed by a factor of @xmath160 since only a photosphere of width @xmath161 will actually contribute to the observed emission from such a slice . in this case",
    ", one can treat the point where @xmath162 as an actual jet base .",
    "nonetheless , the scattering cross - section for line photons is much larger due to resonant scattering even taking into account the residual velocity gradient present in the jet slices @xcite .",
    "resonant scattering , however , affects mainly the fine structure of the profiles of the brightest lines of highly abundant elements like si , s and fe , whereas a decrease in the line flux due to the combined operation of electron and resonant scattering proves to be significant only for some special configurations of the jet parameters ( e.g. for a dense and compact or almost cylindrical jet , see @xcite ) .. in such a case , the spectrum can be distorted more strongly by electron and resonant scattering , due to the smaller velocity gradient along the line of sight . ] in the context of ss 433 , @xcite pointed out that @xmath163 should be less than unity since no broad compton wings of the lines were observed in the spectra measured by _ asca _ , which was later confirmed by @xcite with the aid of _",
    "chandra_/hetgs data .",
    "we neglect the opacity effects in this work , but impose a somewhat conservative limit @xmath164 , which is also dictated by the significantly degrading accuracy of model interpolation between points with large @xmath53 ( see appendix ) , while @xmath165 thus @xmath166 for fixed @xmath167 and @xmath135 .",
    "the latter relation also demonstrates that the dependence of @xmath53 on @xmath17 and @xmath168 actually reduces to a dependence on @xmath169 .",
    "moreover , one has @xmath170 for radiative cooling determined by hydrogen and helium bremsstrahlung only .",
    "therefore , small @xmath171 also implies small @xmath65 , and hence there is no need to calculate spectra for very low @xmath169 because the spectral shape is invariant in the low-@xmath53 regime .",
    "as regards the model normalisation , it is natural to expect that @xmath125 is somehow related to the available energy budget of the jet .",
    "indeed , the equation for the model normalisation @xmath125 in the high-@xmath53 regime ( eq.([eq : lumrad ] ) ) suggests that it is simply the flux of thermal energy through the jet @xmath172 while in the low-@xmath173 regime one has @xmath174 ( see eq.([eq : lumad ] ) ) .",
    "thus , @xmath125 scales linearly with @xmath175 for a fixed @xmath53 , and @xmath176 in all cases .",
    "the thermal energy flux , however , constitutes only a minor fraction of a mildly relativistic jet s energy budget , which is dominated by the kinetic power of the bulk motion , @xmath177 if the jet s plasma is not very hot : @xmath178 for @xmath179 and @xmath180 .",
    "being large enough both in absolute and relative senses , @xmath181 has two major advantages .",
    "first , since the kinetic power of the jet dissipates very slowly , staying almost constant up to the termination point of the jet , it can be measured at various scales independently of x - ray observations of the central object ( e.g. from the energy deposited in the circumjacent interstellar medium ) .",
    "second , if the kinetic luminosity of the jet indeed dominates the energy output of the accreting compact object , one may expect it to be comparable but not much higher than the eddington luminosity , given that accretion proceeds in the super - critical regime ( see results for model a in @xcite ) .",
    "hence , there is a natural upper limit for this quantity of order of @xmath182 erg / s as far as we are dealing with jets in xrbs . on the other hand , taking into account eq.([eq : lthlk ] ) and recalling that @xmath183 in all cases , we can easily find a lower limit for @xmath184 provided that @xmath185 and @xmath16 are known : @xmath186 this immediately puts a constrain on the minimum @xmath187 we may be interested in , given typical x - ray flux limits for spectroscopy of sufficient quality .",
    "say , for @xmath188 erg / s/@xmath189 , @xmath190 erg / s , i.e. @xmath191 erg / s . additionally , as noticed before , @xmath192 for given @xmath31 , @xmath22 and @xmath16 , whereas @xmath193 and the spectral shape is invariant in the low-@xmath53 regime .",
    "therefore , there is degeneracy between @xmath169 and @xmath184 for small @xmath169 , since the model prediction is sensitive to their product only . in principle",
    ", this degeneracy may be broken by means of density - sensitive line ratios in he - like triplets ( see section [ ss : lineratios ] ) .    as a result , being naturally constrained and having understandable influence on characteristics of the predicted emission , both @xmath169 and @xmath187 are well suited for more efficient model parametrisation .",
    "therefore , @xmath24 and @xmath194 can be replaced by the pair of new parameters , @xmath187 and @xmath169 . in order to perform the corresponding transformation ,",
    "it is useful to rewrite @xmath184 using more appropriate units .",
    "as mentioned above , a natural scale for @xmath195 is set by the eddington luminosity , which for a compact object with of mass @xmath196 is @xmath197 @xmath198 erg / s . as follows from eq.([eq : lkin ] ) , @xmath199 where @xmath200 cm . dividing this by @xmath169",
    ", results in @xmath201 and @xmath202 these relations describe the transformation from @xmath203 ) to @xmath204 , and it is the latter set of parameters that is actually used in our implementation of the model",
    ".    with the new set of variables , eq.([eq : lumad ] ) implies that @xmath205 where @xmath206 depends on @xmath207 only weakly for the low-@xmath53 regime .    for the high-@xmath53 regime ( cf .",
    "eq.([eq : lumrad ] ) ) , one has @xmath208",
    "note that there might exist a physical relationship between the parameter values , such as one suggested by @xcite for @xmath22 , @xmath31 and @xmath16 : @xmath209 , i.e. @xmath210 , meaning that the jet expands sideways at the sound speed of plasma at the jet s base .",
    "such constraints may be easily taken into account by setting corresponding links between the parameters when applying the model ( e.g. in ` xspec ` ) .",
    "we finally note that the x - ray emitting jet is assumed to be a continuous flow in our model , while one might also be interested in considering a jet consisting of @xmath211 distinct clumps or streamlets with a mean opening angle @xmath212 ( see e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) . in this case , for the same @xmath31 and _ net _ @xmath187 , each clump will be characterized by an initial transversal optical depth @xmath213 . therefore ,",
    "if @xmath214 is sufficiently small and @xmath215 is within the allowed range , the cumulative emission of the jet can be estimated by applying our model to a single streamlet ( i.e. for @xmath216 ) and artificially increasing the normalisation and spectral smoothing width ( see section [ ss : xspec ] and appendix ) by a factor of @xmath217 .",
    "in this section , we analyse the basic predictions of the model and probe their sensitivity to the model parameters across the potential range of the parameter values . some boundaries of this range have been already outlined above ( namely , for @xmath218 and @xmath184 ) , while some others are discussed in the appendix .",
    "here we just mention that @xmath187 is allowed to vary from @xmath219 to @xmath220 erg / s , @xmath218 from @xmath221 to 0.5 , @xmath16 from 7 to 40 kev , @xmath222 from 0.003 to 0.03 rad , @xmath223 from 0.03 to 0.3 and @xmath36 from 0 to 9 .",
    "first of all , we are interested in the range of jet x - ray luminosities available to the model . as shown in the top panel of fig.[f : lum ] , the model @xmath125 covers a range from @xmath224 to @xmath225 ergs / s for each value of @xmath16 .",
    "this range is mainly provided by the @xmath226 factor in eq.([eq : lx0ad ] ) , so dividing @xmath125 by this factor reduces the range to a relatively narrow stripe ( see fig.[f : lum ] ) .",
    "this makes it possible to increase the accuracy of table model interpolation ( see appendix ) .",
    "next , we consider the contributions of different energy bands to the total luminosity .",
    "we divide the spectrum in three broad bands : soft ( e@xmath2271.5 kev ) , medium ( 1.5 kev@xmath227e@xmath2279 kev ) and hard ( e@xmath2289 kev ) .",
    "the relative contributions of these bands are shown in the second top panel of fig.[f : lum ] for models with @xmath54 .",
    "noteworthy , the contribution of the medium band varies only slightly across the parameter space , and it equals @xmath229 everywhere .",
    "as expected , the contribution of the soft band decreases with increasing @xmath230 , and the opposite is true for the hard band . since the soft band is heavily affected by interstellar absorption while the hard band is beyond the effective sensitivity range of the _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ observatories , we focus more on the medium band .",
    "namely , we introduce three sub - bands : 1.5 - 3 , 3 - 6 and 6 - 9 kev . this is motivated by the fact that there are no strong lines in the 3 - 6 kev energy sub - band and the emitted spectrum can be described in terms of a simple power - law model there . on the other hand ,",
    "emission lines contribute singificantly to the flux from 1.5 to 3 kev ( mainly lines of h- and he - like silicon and sulphur ) and above 6 kev ( due to h- and he - like iron ) .",
    "again , fluxes in the softer ( 1.5 - 3 kev ) and harder ( 6 - 9 kev ) sub - bands are fairly sensitive to the dem of relatively cold ( @xmath231 kev ) and hot ( @xmath232 kev ) gas , while the contribution of the 3 - 6 kev sub - band to the total luminosity remains almost constant at a level of @xmath233 for @xmath234 ( see the second top panel of fig.[f : lum ] ) .",
    "the dependence of luminosities in the strongest lines of the softer and harder sub - bands on @xmath16 is demonstrated in the two bottom panels of fig.[f : lum ] .",
    "the major contribution comes from the fe xxv k@xmath173 triplet line ( @xmath235 ) , while the other lines provide typically @xmath236 of the total luminosity for @xmath234 ( and hence 2.5 times more to the 1.5 - 9 kev luminosity ) . of course , these numbers scale almost linearly with @xmath36 , and below we consider how this ( along with variation in other parameters ) affects the spectral energy distribution of the model in the medium band .     is dashed with black lines .",

    "the power - law spectrum in the 3 - 6 kev energy sub - band arises from a combination of bremsstrahlung emission from various parts of the jet , and its slope should be determined mainly by the maximum visible temperature , since the @xmath243 decreases with decreasing @xmath135 ( see section [ ss : speccalc ] ) .",
    "indeed , the dependence of the power - law slope @xmath244 on @xmath16 is clearly seen in the top panel of fig.[f : observ ] .",
    "increasing metallicity makes the spectrum in this region somewhat harder , as a result of suppression of the @xmath245 of low - temperature parts of the jet ( see fig . [",
    "f : demprof ] ) , and increases the scatter in the @xmath246 relation caused by other parameters .",
    "as the spectrum gets harder , the ratio of fluxes in the 6 - 9 kev to 3 - 6 kev sub - bands must grow correspondingly , and this effect is demonstrated in the second top panel of fig.[f : observ ] .",
    "however , as noticed above , there is a significant contribution of line emission ( primarily due to h- and he - like iron ) to the spectrum in the 6 - 9 kev sub - band , so the @xmath247 ratio depends more on the equivalent width of the lines , which is sensitive to the gas metallicity @xmath36 since the continuum emission is dominated by bremsstrahlung from hydrogen and helium ( see fig.[f : observ ] ) .",
    "this , in combination with a measurement of the slope in the 3 - 6 kev sub - band , allows one to estimate the required metallicity just from the flux ratios with no need for resolving the lines .",
    "the scatter caused by other parameters is vanishingly small , and it becomes noticeable only for extremely high values of @xmath36 .",
    "although there is also a significant contribution from lines to the flux in the 1.5 - 3 kev energy sub - band , the dependence of the @xmath248 ratio on metallicity is not so clear in this case ( see the third top panel of fig.[f : observ ] ) , and the main effect of increasing metallicity is actually an increased sensitivity to other model parameters , as reflected by a large scatter in the @xmath249 relation .",
    "this also implies that fitting the spectrum in this energy sub - band may provide the most stringent constrains on these additional parameters , given that @xmath16 and @xmath36 can be estimated from data in the harder sub - bands only .",
    "additionally , there is a well - known temperature diagnostic tool based on intensity ratios of the k@xmath242 triplet line of he - like ions to the ly@xmath242 line of h - like ions . only modest spectral resolution is required to resolve these lines . in the context of ss 433",
    "jets , this technique was first exploited by @xcite for iron lines in spectra provided by the @xmath250 observatory and was then extensively used for _ xmm - newton _ ( e.g. @xcite ) and _ chandra _ ( e.g. @xcite ) data . in the bottom panel of fig .",

    "first of all , plenty of fainter neighbouring lines blend with the actual triplet components due to the finite energy resolution of any spectrometer .",
    "moreover , there is broadening of the lines intrinsic to the model itself . in our case",
    ", this comes from the conical flow pattern and is determined by the jet opening angle @xmath22 .",
    "secondly , since we consider the multi - temperature model , the actual @xmath261-ratio is a weighted mean over the jet ( with the weighting proportional to the dem ) and is thus somewhat biased to higher densities and also corresponds to some higher temperature @xmath262 than the temperature of peak emissivity .",
    "fortunately , the dependence of the @xmath261-ratio on effective temperature is relatively weak , but the situation may be different for some satellite lines .",
    "one of the major contributors to satellite lines is dielectronic recombination , which results in lower peak temperatures for the satellites than for the triplet components .",
    "again , since the dem is decreasing with decreasing temperature , the influence of these satellites is expected to be relatively suppressed . however , there are also satellite lines having higher peak temperatures .",
    "this is particularly the case for the intercombination line of neon and the forbidden line of silicon , for which the contribution of the fe xix and mg xii ly@xmath263 lines , respectively , is important .    finally , as the model parameters define the number density @xmath194 at the jet base , the actual density at the position where the triplet emission mostly comes from ( roughly , the point with temperature equal to the effective one ) differs from @xmath194 , and this difference is larger for a larger difference between @xmath16 and @xmath262 .",
    "this makes the sensitivity range exceptionally broad for low-@xmath262 elements , first of all neon and silicon , but much narrower for sulphur and iron .",
    "the situation becomes simpler in the high-@xmath53 regime , since the jet is short here and @xmath264 does not vary significantly along it , and equals @xmath194 everywhere .",
    "this almost completely eliminates the dependence on @xmath16 in this case .    of course",
    ", all these effects are automatically accounted for when the model is fitted locally in the triplet region . instead",
    ", here we try to provide a qualitative picture of the sensitivity of the @xmath261-ratio to the model parameters . for simplicity , we fixed the spectral smearing width at the resolution of _ chandra _ heg , i.e. @xmath265 ( cf . also @xcite ) .",
    "namely , all satellite lines in the range @xmath266 $ ] contribute to the flux of a triplet component with centroid energy @xmath267 .",
    "the resulting picture is shown in fig.[f : triplets ] for three values of @xmath230 ( 10 , 20 and 40 kev ) and @xmath65 ( 0.01 , 0.5 and 5 ) , where all the basic features described above are clearly seen .",
    "the fact that @xmath261 does not go to zero in the high - density limit for silicon and iron reflects the contribution of satellites to the forbidden component .",
    "as regards the low - density regime , one may notice a difference in the limiting @xmath261 value for neon and silicon in the high-@xmath53 regime ( see the top panels of fig.[f : triplets ] ) .",
    "this is caused by the contribution of satellites with higher peak temperatures to the intercombination line of neon and the forbidden line of silicon . for the high-@xmath53 regime ,",
    "the @xmath268 profile becomes steeper for @xmath269 kev ( see fig.[f : demprof ] increasing the importance of high peak temperature satellites , correspondingly decreasing the @xmath261-ratio for neon and increasing it for silicon .",
    "thus , he - like triplets indeed provide additional sensitivity of the model predictions to @xmath53 , which is equivalent to sensitivity on @xmath169 for fixed @xmath31 , @xmath22 and @xmath16 ( see eq.([eq : alphatau ] ) ) . in the low-@xmath242 regime ,",
    "the dependence on @xmath270 makes it possible to break the degeneracy of model predictions with respect to the @xmath271 combination ( see section [ ss : param ] ) .",
    "below we present an example of actual use of the model in application to a high - resolution spectrum of ss 433 provided by _",
    "in this section we check whether our model is indeed adequate for description of the x - ray emission of ss 433 .",
    "however , since detailed analysis of ss 433 spectra ( to get stringent constraints on the parameters of the system ) is not the primary aim of the present paper , we focus mainly on the ability of the model to reproduce the basic features of the observed emission of ss 433 . furthermore , as has been demonstrated in previous studies , some other components may be required in addition to the thermal emission of the jets to describe x - ray spectra of this source @xcite . in the reflection model ,",
    "the observed additional component arises from emission reflected from the inner regions of the super - critical accretion disc @xcite .",
    "indeed , the fluorescent k@xmath53 line of neutral iron fe i , usually detected at 6.4 kev , strongly supports the scenario with reflection from cold matter of walls of the accretion disc funnel @xcite .",
    "however , the contribution of this component is expected to be low at the precessional phase when the accretion disc is viewed nearly edge - on. we can thus expect the jet model alone to fit the data at this phase relatively well .",
    "estimates for some parameters of the model can be obtained not only by fitting x - ray spectra but also by other observational techniques .",
    "this is particularly the case for @xmath31 and @xmath22 , which can be determined from doppler shifts and broadening of emission lines . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath272 and @xmath273 are the doppler shifts for the approaching ( blue ) and receding ( red ) jets , respectively , then @xmath274 the latter estimate supposes that both jets are perfectly aligned and have the same velocity .",
    "some apparent deviations from the symmetrical picture were reported by @xcite , which however have only a minor effect on the total predicted spectrum .    the angle @xmath275 between the axis of the jets and the line of sight may then be found either for @xmath272 or @xmath273 : @xmath276 i.e. @xmath277    further , if the profile of a line at energy @xmath278 is approximated by a gaussian with dispersion @xmath279 , one may estimate the jet half - opening angle @xmath22 as @xcite @xmath280    additionally , these parameters may be estimated from optical data in similar manner , assuming of course that these parameters remain constant at least up to the distances where the optical emission comes from ( @xmath281 cm , e.g. @xcite ) . for ss 433 , such measurements result in @xmath282 and @xmath283 rad from x - ray data ( @xcite , for the correct value of @xmath22 see also a remark in @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "values inferred from optical data are also broadly consistent with these estimates @xcite ( possibly suggesting a slight decrease in @xmath20 ) , although the optical lines typically exhibit relatively complex structure and possible contamination by emission from the supercritical accretion disc wind ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , by fixing @xmath20 and @xmath22 at these values we can reduce the number of model parameter , while the corresponding shifting and broadening of the lines may be superimposed upon the model by means of standard spectral analysis tools ( see section [ ss : xspec ] ) .    owing to this possibility",
    ", we may take into account another effect which is of particular relevance to ss 433 .",
    "namely , significant over - abundance of nickel was invoked to describe an observed excess of intensity at @xmath284 kev ( rest frame ) @xcite , the region where the @xmath285 emission line of he - like nickel is expected to be present ( along with the @xmath286 line of he - like iron , see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we allow nickel abundance to vary separately from other heavy elements , introducing a new model parameter @xmath287 .",
    "its effect on the predicted spectrum is modest and limited to the intensities of the nickel lines ( see e.g. table 4 in @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the set of parameters for ss 433-specific version of the model reads as ( @xmath288 , @xmath287 ) .",
    "the spectrum of ss 433 in the standard x - ray energy range ( 1 - 10 kev ) has been extensively studied with _",
    "_ high energy transmission grating spectrometer ( hetgs ) @xcite , with the total accumulated exposure being more than 300 ks @xcite . here , we focus on an observation performed on 2001 march 16 ( obsid 1019 ) with a net exposure time of 24 ks @xcite .",
    "the jets inclination to the line of sight is @xmath289 for this observation @xcite ,",
    "i.e. the accretion disk is viewed nearly edge - on .",
    "correspondingly , @xcite found @xmath290 and @xmath291 ( with the cited uncertainty of 0.0001 in both numbers ) , hence @xmath292 , while @xmath293 and @xmath294 rad .",
    "this is broadly consistent with the @xmath260 and @xmath295 values adopted for our ss 433-specific model ( see above ) , since the value for @xmath295 inferred from line broadening is more likely an upper limit due to possible contribution from other broadening mechanisms ( like jet nutation and resonant scattering , @xcite for a thorough discussion ) .",
    "these values are used as a starting point for our fitting process in the next section .",
    "the data was downloaded , prepared and reduced by means of the standard ` tgcat ` pipeline @xcite and analysis threads from the ` ciao 4.7 ` package .",
    "only @xmath296 orders were combined both for the high energy grating ( heg ) and medium energy grating ( meg ) , but the heg and meg were not further combined due to significant difference in their response functions . since a significant fraction of the spectral channels have very low signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) , we used the weighting function by @xcite . besides that , we took advantage of the standard tool ` grppha ` from the ` ftools ` package in order to produce re - binned versions of the spectra with at least 25 _ raw _ counts per bin , for which @xmath297-statistics can be used .",
    "this allows one to check whether the derived values of the model parameters are sensitive to a particular fitting technique .",
    "both the approaching ( blue ) and the receding ( red ) jets contribute to the observed emission from the unresolved x - ray core of ss 433 .",
    "we thus need a two - component model with the components appropriately doppler shifted and boosted . in ` xspec ` , doppler shifting may be performed using the convolution model _",
    "zashift _ , which also accounts for the corresponding doppler boosting .",
    "next , gaussian broadening of the lines is imposed by the _",
    "gsmooth _ convolution model , with @xmath298 given by eq.([eq : wtheta ] ) with the values for @xmath20 , @xmath263 and @xmath10 mentioned above , so @xmath299 .",
    "finally , interstellar absorption is accounted for in the usual fashion by the _",
    "wabs _ model .",
    "thus , the full model reads as @xmath300 where the additional component _ constant _ allows one to attenuate the red jet by some constant factor across the whole energy range ( as would be in the case for obscuration by some material with gray opacities ) .",
    "the _ jet _",
    "model stands for our table model loaded with the ` atable ` command and with the normalisation properly determined ( see appendix ) .",
    "there is a dichotomy in estimates of the distance to ss 433 : while @xcite found @xmath301 kpc by fitting a kinematic model to arcsec - scale radio images of the jets , estimates based on the proper motion of discrete ejecta in the inner radio jets yield @xmath302 kpc @xcite , and even lower values are derived by other less direct methods ( see discussions in @xcite and more recently in @xcite and references therein ) . in the analysis",
    "below , we consider both estimates and check the sensitivity of our results to the @xmath303 uncertainty in the distance .",
    "broad - band fitting of a complex spectrum with a single model for the lines and continuum is generally not a very good idea , since the process in highly non - linear and there may be a lot of local maxima of the likelihood function across the parameter space .",
    "we therefore first try to get some insight regarding the probable parameters values from the observables considered in section [ s : observ ] .    as a first step",
    ", we fitted the heg spectrum by a power law in the 3 - 6 kev energy range .",
    "this resulted in an excellent fit for the binned data ( @xmath304 for 194 d.o.f .",
    ", @xmath305 , @xmath306 ) and yielded almost identical parameter values for the unbinned weighted data .",
    "as is seen in fig.[f : observ ] , the derived slope is too flat to be produced by the jet model alone .",
    "hence , some additional component ( e.g. reflected disc emission ) or comptonisation of jet emission is still required even for almost edge - on disc orientation .",
    "the total flux in this range is @xmath307 erg/@xmath308/s , which corresponds to a luminosity @xmath309 erg / s for @xmath310 kpc .",
    "hence , the total luminosity @xmath311 erg / s ( see section [ ss : norm ] ) . assuming equal contributions from the red and blue jets",
    ", we find @xmath312 erg / s per jet .",
    "next , we notice the data in the 6 - 9 kev energy range and fit a power - law model with fixed @xmath313 but with the addition of an exponential high - energy cut - off ( in order to account for possible spectrum curvature ) and six broad gaussian lines at the positions expected for the blue- and red - shifted fe xxv k@xmath242 , fe xxvi ly@xmath242 and ni xxvii k@xmath242 lines plus a narrow fe i @xmath314 line at 6.4 kev . a satisfactory fit ( @xmath315 for 299 d.o.f . )",

    "nonetheless , assuming that the @xmath320-ratio is the same for the blue and red jets , we can recover it by solving the quadratic equation @xmath321 , where @xmath322 and @xmath323 are the photon fluxes in the fe xxv k@xmath242 line of the red jet , in the blend , and in the fe xxvi ly@xmath242 line the blue jet , respectively . according to our fit , @xmath324 and @xmath325 ( cf . with @xmath326 and @xmath327 found by @xcite ) . solving the equation for k and choosing the @xmath328 root ( see fig.[f : observ ] ) , one finds @xmath329 ( the results of @xcite imply that @xmath330 ) .",

    "however , if the parameter @xmath365 is set to unity while all other parameters are kept the same as for the 1 - 3 kev best - fitting model , such a model almost fully accounts for the deficit of the original model with respect to the data at high energies ( see fig.[f : obs1019 ] ) and leaves residuals only in the fe k@xmath53 line and adjacent continuum .",
    "such a model also slightly over - predicts the fluxes of the red jet s iron lines .",
    "this possibly indicates that emission from a cooler jet region is partially blocked while the hottest region is totally unobscured ( see also discussion of this issue in @xcite ) .",
    "any further interpretation of these results is beyond the scope of the current paper , while the main conclusion we may draw is that the calculated model is indeed capable of describing the ss 433 jets emission sufficiently well for a reasonable set of parameter values .",
    "heg data for ss 433 at an almost edge - on precession phase ( obsid 1019 , re - binned for better visibility only ) with the model providing the best simultaneous fit ( for @xmath366 kpc ) to the heg & meg datasets in the 1 - 3 kev range shown by the black solid line .",
    "the blue and red dotted lines show contributions of the blue and red jets respectively .",
    "the gray line ( drawn only for @xmath367 kev ) shows the same best - fitting model , but with no artificial suppression of the red jet s normalisation ( i.e. @xmath365 set to 1 ) . ]",
    "we provide the x - ray astronomy community with a spectral model for thermal x - ray emission from a baryonic jet in an xrb , inspired by the unique galactic microquasar ss 433 .",
    "the jet is assumed to be strongly collimated ( the half - opening angle @xmath5 ) , mildly - relativistic ( the bulk velocity @xmath368 ) .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of the multi - temperature jet is found by summing the contributions from thin slices , each having its own temperature and radiating in the optically thin coronal regime .",
    "the temperature profile along the jet and the corresponding differential emission measure ( dem ) distribution are calculated self - consistently taking into account cooling due to adiabatic expansion and radiative losses .",
    "the model predicts not only the shape of the emitted spectrum but also the total x - ray luminosity of the jet .",
    "therefore , if the distance to a given source is known sufficiently well , the normalisation of the model is not a free parameter .",
    "this makes the overall physical picture self - contained .",
    "we have also introduced a set of observables that reflect the basic properties of the jet s x - ray emission ( such as ratios of fluxes emitted in various energy bands and line to continuum flux ratios ) and explored their sensitivity to physical parameters of the jet ( such as the temperature and density at its base ) .",
    "using these observables one can constrain the plausible range of parameter values fairly well without global fitting of a high - resolution x - ray spectrum .",
    "we have checked whether a specific version of our model is capable of fitting high resolution spectra of ss 433 provided by @xmath2 hetgs for a precession phase when the contribution from non - jet spectral components is expected to be low ( when the accretion disc is observed nearly edge - on ) .",
    "the model describes well the data in the 1 - 3 kev energy range ( with the parameter values summarised in table [ t : fits ] ) but leaves significant residuals at higher energies .",
    "the latter can be accounted for if the red jet s emission is modified by a temperature - dependent suppression factor .",
    "we also verified the robustness of the fitting results against data representation ( binned vs. unbinned weighted ) and probed their ( in)sensitivity to the assumed distance to the source ( except for the normalisation defining combination @xmath369 ) .",
    "the parameter values inferred from the fitting are broadly consistent with the expectations based on the introduced simple observables .    forthcoming data at hard x - ray energies ( _ nustar _ , @xcite ) and with fine spectral resolution near the iron line complex ( _ astro - h _ , @xcite ) will be invaluable for checking the consistency of the model s predictions with ss 433 data as well as for assessing its applicability to plausible jet components in the spectra of other galactic xrbs ( e.g. 4u 1630 - 47 , @xcite ) , ulxs",
    "( e.g. holmberg ii x-1 , @xcite ) , and candidate ss 433-analogues like s26 in ngc7793 @xcite and the unusual radio transient in m82 @xcite .",

    "chianti is a collaborative project involving george mason university , the university of michigan ( usa ) and the university of cambridge ( uk ) .",
    "the model described in the text predicts luminosity @xmath370 and spectral shape @xmath371 of the source emission as a function of its intrinsic parameters @xmath372 . in practice , however , one typically operates with the corresponding energy ( or photon ) flux density @xmath373 where @xmath374 is the luminosity distance to the source .",
    "this function is to be determined from a so - called table model , defined by a grid of spectra calculated for a range of parameter values .",
    "the model prediction for some arbitrary point in the parameter space is found by means of interpolation on a generic grid .",
    "this interpolation may be linear or logarithmic with respect to parameter values , but it is always linear with respect to the predicted flux values .",
    "hence , one should avoid large differences between spectra in adjacent points of the parameter grid , otherwise stepwise changes arise in the predicted spectra ( like in the case of the ` apec ` model at low temperatures ) .",
    "fortunately , this can be done by re - normalizing the original model in such a way that the most drastic dependencies on parameters are retained by the normalisation factor .",
    "indeed , as shown in section [ ss : param ] , @xmath375 , where @xmath206 depends on @xmath207 only weakly .",
    "hence , @xmath376 further , in order to avoid manipulation with large numbers , it is convenient to replace @xmath184 with @xmath377 and @xmath378 with @xmath379 , so we finally get @xmath380 where the @xmath381 function depends on @xmath207 gently but in a very complicated way , while @xmath382 varies dramatically but in an obvious fashion with model parameters and distance to the source .",
    "thus , one may treat @xmath381 as a model,i.e . a function to be tabulated ,",
    "while @xmath382 as its ( parameter - dependent ) normalisation , whose product with the model results in the predicted emission . in ` xspec ` , this can be handled by loading @xmath381 as an ` atable ` model , and determining its _ normalisation _ parameter from other parameters : @xmath383 which is readily realised by the corresponding parameter links . since @xmath31 and @xmath22",
    "are fixed for the ss 433-specific model ( see section [ ss : sssmodel ] ) , its normalisation could be re - defined in terms of @xmath384 , @xmath169 and @xmath385 kpc only : @xmath386 while the corresponding @xmath387 is multiplied by a @xmath388 factor .      as the model has to be tabulated on a finite grid of parameter values , it is crucial for such a grid to be maximally consistent with the intended use of the model as well as with its intrinsic limitations ( see above ) .",
    "ss 433 is the only source with confident detection of baryonic jets , so we ought to rely on extrapolation of the jet properties from ss 433 to the target source population .",
    "primarily , this refers to @xmath31 and @xmath22 , for which we allow values from 0.03 - 0.3 and from 0.003 to 0.03 rad , respectively .",
    "it is worth noting that these parameters may in fact be measured directly from doppler shifts ( for @xmath31 ) and broadening ( for @xmath22 ) of emission lines , so they can be frozen at some pre - determined values when fitting data , as in the case of the ss 433-specific model .",
    "the metallicity parameter @xmath36 affects mainly intensity of emission lines , and does it in an almost linear manner .",
    "so it is allowed to vary in a relatively broad range of values , namely from 0 to 9 .",
    "the same is true for the @xmath287 parameter of the ss 433-specific model , but it is allowed to vary from 1 to 30 .    as discussed in section [ ss : param ] , the range of @xmath184 from @xmath219 to @xmath389 erg / s is fairly sufficient for the current purposes of the model .",
    "the range for @xmath169 is adopted from @xmath221 to @xmath390 , since for small @xmath218 the model becomes sensitive mostly to the combination @xmath391 , while for @xmath392 opacity effects may invalidate model predictions ( see section [ ss : param ] ) .",
    "besides that , the interpolation accuracy significantly decreases for @xmath393 , which , along with the limits for @xmath16 , is considered next .      in order to estimate the accuracy loss caused by interpolation",
    ", we performed a monte - carlo simulation drawing @xmath394 points @xmath395 randomly across the parameter space , and for each of them the fractional deviation @xmath396    was calculated , where @xmath397 is the actual prediction of the model , @xmath398 is the result provided by the interpolation on the grid . here ,",
    "@xmath399 means averaging over the energy range of interest , say from @xmath400 to @xmath401 : @xmath402 .",
    "the distribution function of @xmath403 depends on the particular choice of the parameters grid , and we iteratively adjust the grid to achieve the highest accuracy for a given number of grid points .",
    "it turned out that the accuracy of interpolation is worst in the ( low-@xmath404 , high-@xmath36 , high-@xmath405 ) region of the parameter space , where contribution of line emission to the radiative cooling term and to the predicted spectrum is most prominent . to keep accuracy level at @xmath406 without significant increase in the number of grid points , we choose @xmath407 kev and @xmath408 as lower ( upper ) boundaries for @xmath16 and @xmath169 respectively , and also make the grid step finest ( in the relative sense ) close to these boundaries .",
    "as a result , when the whole energy range was considered , the accuracy of interpolation was better than 8% for all points , better than 5% for @xmath40997% of points , and the median accuracy is 2% . for the photon energies @xmath410 kev ,",
    "the median accuracy was close to 1% , while the fraction of points with @xmath411 is vanishingly small ."
