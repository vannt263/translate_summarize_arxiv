    "a single - wall carbon nanotube ( cnt ) is a fascinating quasi - one - dimensional ( quasi-1d ) nano - scale material , which is a graphite sheet wrapped into a cylindrical form .",
    "its electronic structure is basically well described by a one - electron tight - binding model with a single @xmath0 orbital per atom .",
    "depending on its geometrical shape , a large variety of electronic structures are realized . especially , it can be either a metal or a semiconductor depending on how the graphite sheet is wrapped .",
    "@xcite the way of wrapping is specified by a chiral vector @xmath1 .",
    "when @xmath2 is satisfied , a cnt is metallic , while it is gapped otherwise .",
    "an interesting consequence of its rich electronic band structure is the existence of the boundary states when the system possesses boundaries . for a cnt with zigzag or bearded edges ,",
    "there appear states localized at the boundaries for specific values of the wave number along the boundaries .",
    "@xcite it is a hallmark of the phase degree of freedom specific to quantum mechanical systems .",
    "@xcite the existence of such boundary states raises an interesting question as to what kind of physical consequences they lead .",
    "for example , the electronic and magnetic properties of nanographite in magnetic field @xcite or electronic transport through nanographite ribbon junctions @xcite were theoretically investigated .",
    "furthermore , in the presence of electron - electron or electron - phonon interactions , the boundary states might trigger an instability as they form a flatband and a sharp peak in density of states at the fermi energy for a 2d sheet geometry .",
    "indeed , spin polarization induced by the boundary states @xcite , or coupling with lattice distortions @xcite has been studied for a graphite sheet by several authors .",
    "the effects of 1d low - lying excitations localized at the boundaries was also discussed for ribbon geometry .",
    "@xcite    the effects of bulk electron correlations have been extensively investigated for metallic cnt s without boundaries .",
    "@xcite it is claimed that the most important forward scattering part of the coulomb interaction is well accounted for by the tomonaga - luttinger ( tl ) liquid picture @xcite , where low - lying excitations are not of fermi liquid type , but bosonic collective excitations .",
    "behaviors specific to tl liquid , such as a characteristic temperature dependence of conductance , have been indeed observed in recent experiments .",
    "@xcite in tl liquid , boundary critical phenomena are known to be drastically different from the conventional fermi liquid case when the system possesses boundaries .",
    "@xcite then , we expect to see interesting phenomena for a thin metallic cnt with boundaries . the anomalous boundary physics in a metallic cnt within the tl liquid picture such as tunneling density of states @xcite , freidel oscillation @xcite , or local density of states",
    "@xcite has been investigated previously , but without boundary states .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to discuss electron correlation effects for cnt s with edges that supports boundary states .",
    "we consider @xmath3 cnt s with zigzag and bearded edges , for which boundary states appear at the fermi level for some values of the wave number along the edges .",
    "starting from lattice models with the coulomb or the hubbard interaction , we first establish low - energy effective theories that describe correlation effects at boundaries .",

    "analyses together with the open boundary bosonization , we discuss the cases where one or two boundary states exist . for the case of two boundary states ,",
    "we are especially interested in whether or not the boundary states exhibit spin polarization in the presence of gapless bulk excitations .",
    "the possibility of spin polarization was previously discussed for 2d geometry , i.e. , in the limit of the infinite tube radius @xmath4 , by mean field theory@xcite or density - functional theory with local spin density approximation ( lsda ) @xcite . however",
    ", these treatments of electron correlations can overestimate the magnetic instability .",
    "also , when the system is wrapped into a 1d cylinder , one needs further justification . a density matrix renormalization ( dmrg )",
    "study was also performed @xcite which reports spin polarization at boundaries , but only for a semi - conducting cnt .",
    "when the bulk part of the system is gapless , it is not clear if the boundary states show spin polarization since the total spin ( and charge ) carried by the boundary states can dissipate into a bulk part of the system through the electron interactions between boundary states and bulk gapless collective modes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section [ zero energy boundary states and interactions ] is devoted to a construction of low - energy effective theories which account for zero - energy boundary states .",
    "we recall some known facts on boundary states in section [ zero energy boundary states ] , and the coulomb or the hubbard interaction is projected to the low - energy sector of the hilbert space spanned by the boundary states and gapless bulk modes in section [ interactions ] . in section",

    "rg equations for @xmath237 and @xmath238 , which determine the total spin carried by the ground state of @xmath239 fermions , are given by @xmath240 where @xmath241 and @xmath242 .",
    "we see that the kondo couplings @xmath207 renormalize the exchange interactions between boundary states @xmath237 , making it ferromagnetic .",
    "then , the ground state of the boundary states is polarized with the total spin equal to unity .",
    "when we include @xmath157 in the rg analysis , they also give rise to a contribution in the perturbative expansion .",
    "in contrast to @xmath207 , they suppress the ferromagnetic coupling between the boundary states @xmath237",
    ". however , the bulk interaction makes @xmath157 strongly irrelevant as stated above , and hence they do not affect the rg flow .",
    "to conclude , we have investigated correlation effects of @xmath5 cnt s with boundaries .",
    "low - energy effective hamiltonians were established by taking into account boundary states at the fermi energy . due to the special nature of the boundary states ,",
    "the differences between the coulomb and the hubbard interaction are found to be small .",
    "we then discussed specific examples where only one or two boundary states appear . in the infrared limit in rg analyses ,",
    "kondo - like couplings between conduction electrons and boundary states are shown to be vanishing , and the bulk conduction electrons and boundary states are completely decoupled .",
    "doubly occupying a boundary state becomes unfavorable in the infrared near half filling since the strong repulsive bulk interactions renormalizes the interactions at the edge .",
    "as the boundary states do not dissipate through the coupling with conduction electrons , they can be directly observed by local probes such as scanning tunneling microscope .",
    "the boundary states also manifest themselves in transport experiments as the conduction electrons and the boundary states give rise to independent contributions to , say , tunneling density of states .",
    "furthermore , the ground state at the boundary is a highest spin state @xmath243 for the case of one boundary state and @xmath244 for two boundary states , since ferromagnetic couplings between the boundary states are enhanced by the interactions between conduction electrons and the boundary states .",
    "then , the boundary states , as a whole , behave as a localized moment which gives rise to a curie - weiss - like contribution to the magnetic susceptibility , apart from the bulk conduction electrons .",
    "the result obtained here is consistent with spin polarization found in dmrg study for a thin semi - conducting cnt @xcite , and mean - field theory@xcite or a lsda calculation@xcite for 2d sheet geometry .    at lower temperature ,",
    "the formation of a spin - gapped ground state is suggested by the previous studies .",
    "the fate of the spin polarization , found here for the temperature above the gaps , is left as an open question .    finally , we comment on an extra gapless mode other than the modes for @xmath52 treated in the present paper .",
    "when one considers the hybridization between @xmath245 orbitals , which the simple tight - binding approximation adopted here does not correctly capture , there can appear a gapless mode for a very thin cnt , as suggested by band calculations@xcite . in a realistic situation",
    ", effects of the extra gapless mode should be taken into account , which can be possible along the lines of the present discussions .",
    "we are grateful to a. furusaki , h. yoshioka , k. kusakabe , m. tsuchiizu , r. tamura and y. morita for useful discussions .",

    "the computation in this work has been partly done at the supercomputing center , issp , university of tokyo .",
    "although superconducting pairing operators @xmath208 , @xmath209 do not affect the global features of the rg flows , they can renormalize couplings @xmath215 and @xmath234 at @xmath246 , which might result in a different conclusion , e.g. , @xmath247 .",
    "we derived rg equations including the effects of @xmath208 and @xmath209 to check that this does not occur ."
