    "in this paper we explore a toy cosmological model in order to attempt to understand the role of large - scale non - linear cosmic inhomogeneities in the interpretation of observable data .",
    "the model is based on a swiss - cheese model , where the cheese consists of the usual friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) solution and the holes are constructed out of a lematre - tolman - bondi ( ltb ) solution .",
    "the advantage of this model is that it is a solvable model with strong nonlinearities , in particular the formation of caustics as expected in the cold dark matter ( cdm ) models .",
    "most , if not all , observations are consistent with the cosmic concordance model according to which , today , one - fourth of the mass - energy of the universe is clustered and dominated by cold dark matter .",
    "the remaining three - quarters is uniform and dominated by a fluid with a negative pressure ( dark energy , or @xmath0 ) .",
    "while the standard @xmath0cdm model seems capable of accounting for the observations , it does have the feature that approximately 95% of the mass - energy of the present universe is unknown .",
    "we are either presented with the opportunity of discovering the nature of dark matter and dark energy , or nature might be different than described by the @xmath0cdm model .",
    "regardless , until such time as dark matter and dark energy are completely understood , it is useful to look for alternative cosmological models that fit the data .",
    "one non - standard possibility is that there are large effects on the _ observed _ expansion rate due to the back reaction of inhomogeneities in the universe .",
    "the basic idea is that all evidence for dark energy comes from observational determination of the expansion history of the universe .",
    "anything that affects the observed expansion history of the universe alters the determination of the parameters of dark energy ; in the extreme it may remove the need for dark energy .",
    "this paper focuses on the effects of large - scale nonlinear inhomogeneities on observables such as the luminosity - distance ",
    "redshift relation .",
    "the ultimate goal is to find a realistic dust model that can explain observations ( like the luminosity - distance ",
    "redshift relation ) without the need of dark energy .",
    "the ultimate desire will be to have an exactly solvable realistic inhomogeneous model .",
    "our model is but a first small step in this pragmatic and necessary direction .",
    "if this first step is successful , we would show that inhomogeneities must be factored into the final solution .",
    "even if we live in a @xmath0cdm universe , inhomogeneities `` renormalize '' the theory adding an effective extra source to the dark energy .",
    "we have to be very careful in what we mean .",
    "the inhomogeneities renormalize the dust einstein ",
    "de sitter universe only from the observational point of view , that is luminosity and redshift of photons .",
    "average dynamics is beyond this and we will not be concerned with this issue in this paper : if we find an effective cosmological constant , this will not mean that the universe is accelerating , but only that its luminosity distance - redshift relation will fit the observational data .",
    "here we are not primarily interested in the backreaction effect that comes from the averaging procedure in general relativity ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "since we have an exact solution , we can directly calculate observables .",
    "indeed , in this paper we are mainly interested in the effect of inhomogeneities on the dynamics of photons .",
    "we can reformulate our present approach as follows : inhomogeneities renormalize the geodesics of photons . in the extreme case",
    "in which such a renormalization leads to a negative effective deceleration parameter in the luminosity distance - redshift relation , it might make us think that a dark - energy component exists .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "[ model ] we will specify the parameters of our swiss - cheese model . in sect .",
    "[ dynamics ] we study its dynamics .",
    "then in sect .",
    "[ photons ] we will discuss the geodesic equations for light propagation",
    ". we will apply them to see what an observer in the cheese ( sect .  [ cheese ] ) or in the hole ( sect .  [ hole ] ) would observe .",
    "the observables on which we will focus are the change in redshift @xmath1 , angular - diameter ",
    "distance @xmath2 , luminosity - distance  redshift relation @xmath3 , and the distance modulus @xmath4 .",
    "conclusions are given in sect .",
    "[ conclusions ] . in two appendices",
    "we discuss the role of arbitrary functions in ltb models ( appendix a ) and some technical issues in the solution of photon geodesics in our swiss - cheese model ( appendix b ) .",
    "we study a swiss - cheese model where the cheese consists of the usual friedmann  robertson  walker solution and the spherically symmetric holes are constructed from a lematre - tolman - bondi solution .",
    "the particular frw solution we will choose is a matter - dominated , spatially - flat solution , _",
    "i.e. , _ the einstein  de sitter ( eds ) model .    in this section",
    "we will describe the frw and ltb model parameters we have chosen . but",
    "first , in table [ units ] we list the units we will use for mass density , time , the radial coordinate , the expansion rate , and two quantities , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , that will appear in the metric .",
    "the time @xmath7 appearing in table [ units ] is not the usual time in frw models .",
    "rather , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 _ is _ the usual cosmological time and @xmath10 is the present age of the universe .",
    "thus , @xmath11 is the present time and @xmath12 is the time of the big bang .",
    "finally , the initial time of the ltb evolution is defined as @xmath13 .",
    "both the frw and the ltb metrics can be written in the form @xmath14 where here and throughout , the `` prime '' superscript denotes @xmath15 and the `` dot '' superscript will denote @xmath16 .",
    "it is clear that the robertson  walker metric is recovered with the substitution @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the above metric is expressed in the synchronous and comoving gauge .",
    ".[units ] units for various quantities .",
    "we use geometrical units , @xmath19 . here , the present critical density is @xmath20 , with @xmath21 . [ cols=\"<,^,^,>\",options=\"header \" , ]      we choose for the cheese model a spatially - flat , matter - dominated universe ( the eds model ) .",
    "so in the cheese there is no @xmath22 dependence to @xmath23 or @xmath24 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath5 factors into a function of @xmath7 multiplying @xmath22 ( @xmath25 ) , and in the eds model @xmath26 . in this model @xmath27 , so in the cheese , the value of @xmath23 today , denoted as @xmath28 , is unity in the units of table [ units ] . in order to connect with the ltb solution",
    ", we can express the line element in the form @xmath29    in the cheese , the friedman equation and its solution are ( recall @xmath30 corresponds to the present time ) : @xmath31 where the scale factor is normalized so that at the beginning of the ltb evolution it is @xmath32 .    for the eds model , @xmath33 .",
    "we also note that the comoving distance traveled by a photon since the big bang is @xmath34 .",
    "the holes are chosen to have an ltb metric @xcite .",
    "the model is based on the assumptions that the system is spherically symmetric with purely radial motion and the motion is geodesic without shell crossing ( otherwise we could not neglect the pressure ) .",
    "it is useful to define an `` euclidean '' mass @xmath35 and an `` average '' mass density @xmath36 , defined as @xmath37 in spherically symmetric models , in general there are two expansion rates : an angular expansion rate , @xmath38 , and a radial expansion rate , @xmath39 .",
    "( of course in the frw model @xmath40 .",
    ") the angular expansion rate is given by @xmath41 unless specified otherwise , we will identify @xmath42 .    to specify the model we have to specify initial conditions , _",
    "i.e. , _ the position @xmath43 , the velocity @xmath44 and the density @xmath45 of each shell @xmath22 at time @xmath13 . in the absence of shell",
    "crossing it is possible to give the initial conditions at different times for different shells @xmath22 : let us call this time @xmath46 .",
    "the initial conditions fix the arbitrary curvature function @xmath6 : @xmath47 where we can choose @xmath48 so that @xmath49 .    in a general ltb model",
    "there are therefore three arbitrary functions : @xmath50 , @xmath6 and @xmath46 .",
    "their values for the particular ltb model we study are specified in the following subsection .",
    "in appendix [ arbifunc ] we provide a discussion about the number of independent arbitrary functions in a ltb model .",
    "first of all , for simplicity we choose @xmath51 ; _ i.e. , _ we specify the initial conditions for each shell at the same moment of time .        we now choose @xmath50 and @xmath6 in order to match the flat frw model at the boundary of the hole : _",
    "i.e. , _ at the boundary of the hole @xmath52 has to match the frw density and @xmath6 has to go to unity .",
    "a physical picture is that , given a frw sphere , all the matter in the inner region is pushed to the border of the sphere while the quantity of matter inside the sphere does not change . with the density chosen in this way , an observer outside the hole will not feel the presence of the hole as far as _ local _ physics is concerned ( this does not apply to global quantities , such the luminosity - distance ",
    "redshift relation for example ) .",
    "so the cheese is evolving as an frw universe while the holes evolve differently . in this way we can imagine putting in the cheese as many holes as we want ,",
    "even with different sizes and density profiles , and still have an exact solution of the einstein equations ( as long as there is no superposition among the holes and the correct matching is achieved ) .",
    "the limiting picture of this procedure is the apollonian gasket of fig .",
    "[ apo ] , where all the possible holes are placed , and therefore the model has the strange property that it is frw nowhere , but it behaves as an frw model on the average .",

    "@xmath63 mpc and roughly @xmath64 times smaller than @xmath65 .",
    "note that this is not a very big bubble .",
    "but it is an almost empty region : in the interior the matter density is roughly @xmath66 times smaller than in the cheese .",
    "our model consists of a sequence of up to five holes and the observer is looking through them .",
    "the idea , however , is that the universe is completely filled with these holes , which form a sort of lattice as shown in fig .",
    "[ imodel ] . in this way",
    "an observer at rest with respect to a comoving cheese - frw observer will see an isotropic cmb along the two directions of sight shown in fig .",

    "@xmath68 ( recall @xmath69 ) .",
    "the hole ends at @xmath60 .",
    "the matching to the frw solution is achieved as one can see from the plot of @xmath67.,width=14 ]        it is useful to consider the velocity of a shell relative to the frw background . we define @xmath70 where @xmath71 . to have a realistic evolution , we demand that there are no initial peculiar velocities at time @xmath13 , that is , to have an initial expansion @xmath24 independent of @xmath22 : @xmath72 . from eq .",
    "( [ cucu ] ) this implies @xmath73 the graph of @xmath74 chosen in this way is shown in fig .",
    "[ e ] . as seen from the figure ,",
    "the curvature @xmath74 is small compared with unity .",
    "indeed , in many formulae @xmath75 appears , therefore one should compare @xmath76 with @xmath77 . in spite of its smallness , the curvature will play a crucial role to allow a realistic evolution of structures , as we will see in the next section .    also in fig .",
    "[ e ] we graph @xmath78 , which is the generalization of the factor @xmath79 in the usual frw models .",
    "( it is not normalized to unity . ) as one can see , @xmath80 is very nearly constant in the empty region inside the hole .",
    "this is another way to see the reason for our choice of the curvature function : we want to have in the center an empty bubble dominated by negative curvature .    it is important to note that the dynamics of the hole is scale - independent : small holes will evolve in the same way as big holes . to show this",
    ", we just have to express eq .",
    "( [ motion ] ) with respect to a generic variable @xmath81 where @xmath82 fixes the scale .",
    "if we change @xmath82 , _ i.e. , _ scale the density profile , we will find the same scaled shape for @xmath80 and the same time evolution .",
    "this property is again due to spherical symmetry which frees the inner shells from the influence of the outer ones : we can think of a shell as an infinitesimal frw solution and its behavior is scale independent because it is a homogeneous and isotropic solution .     and @xmath80 necessary for the initial conditions of no peculiar velocities.,width=14 ]",
    "now we explore the dynamics of this swiss - cheese model .",
    "as we have said , the cheese evolves as in the standard frw model . of course , inside the holes the evolution is different .",
    "this will become clear from the plots given below .",
    "we will discuss two illustrative cases : a flat case where @xmath83 , and a curved case where @xmath74 is given by eq .",
    "( [ er ] ) .",
    "we are really interested only in the second case because the first will turn out to be unrealistic .",
    "but the flat case is useful to understand the dynamics .      in fig .",
    "[ flat ] we show the evolution of @xmath5 for the flat case , @xmath83 . in the figure @xmath5",

    "the straight lines for @xmath5 are the frw solutions while the dashed lines are the ltb solutions . for the peculiar velocities",
    ", matter is escaping from high density regions .",
    "the center has no peculiar velocity because of spherical symmetry , and the maximum of negative peculiar velocity is before the peak in density .",
    "finally , the values of @xmath91 are @xmath92 and @xmath64 , for @xmath93 , respectively.,width=17 ]    from fig .  [ flat ]",
    "it is clear that outside the hole , _",
    "i.e. , _ for @xmath94 , @xmath5 evolves as a frw solution , @xmath95 .",
    "however , deep inside the hole where it is almost empty , there is no time evolution to @xmath5 : it is minkowski space .",
    "indeed , thanks to spherical symmetry , the outer shells do not influence the interior . if we place additional matter inside the empty space , it will start expanding as an frw universe , but at a lower rate because of the lower density .",
    "it is interesting to point out that a photon passing the empty region will undergo no redshift : again , it is just minkowski space .",
    "this counterintuitive behavior ( empty regions expanding slowly ) is due to the fact that the spatial curvature vanishes .",
    "this corresponds to an unrealistic choice of initial peculiar velocities . to see this we plot the peculiar velocity that an observer following a shell @xmath22 has with respect to an frw observer passing through that same spatial point .",
    "the result is also shown in fig .  [ flat ] where it is seen that matter is escaping from the high density regions .",
    "this causes the evolution to be reversed as one can see in fig.[flat ] from the density profile at different times : structures are not forming , but spreading out .",
    "remember that @xmath22 is only a label for the shell whose euclidean position at time @xmath7 is @xmath5 . in the plots of the energy density we have normalized @xmath5 using @xmath88 .",
    "now we move to a more interesting and relevant case .",
    "we are going to use the @xmath74 given by eq .",
    "( [ er ] ) ; the other parameters will stay the same .",
    "comparison with the flat case is useful to understand how the model behaves , and in particular the role of the curvature .    in fig .",
    "[ curved ] the results for @xmath5 in the curved case are plotted .",
    "again time goes from @xmath84 to @xmath11 ( recall that @xmath69 and @xmath11 is today ) .     with respect to @xmath22 , the peculiar velocities @xmath86 with respect to @xmath22 , and the density profiles @xmath87 with respect to @xmath88 , for the curved case at times @xmath84 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "the straight lines for @xmath5 are the frw solutions while the dashed lines are the ltb solutions . for the peculiar velocities ,",
    "the matter gradually starts to move toward high density regions .",
    "the solid vertical line marks the position of the peak in the density with respect to @xmath22 . for the densities , note that the curve for @xmath96 has been divided by @xmath97 .",
    "finally , the values of @xmath91 are @xmath92 and @xmath64 , for @xmath98 , respectively . , width=17 ]    as one can see , now the inner almost empty region is expanding faster than the outer ( cheese ) region .",
    "this is shown clearly in fig .",
    "[ outinc ] , where also the evolution of the inner and outer sizes is shown .",
    "now the density ratio between the cheese and the interior region of the hole increases by a factor of @xmath99 between @xmath100 and @xmath11 .",
    "initially the density ratio was @xmath101 , but the model is not sensitive to this number since the evolution in the interior region is dominated by the curvature ( @xmath80 is much larger than the matter density ) .",
    "the peculiar velocities are now natural : as can be seen from fig.[curved ] , matter is falling towards the peak in the density .",
    "the evolution is now realistic , as one can see from fig .",
    "[ curved ] , which shows the density profile at different times .",
    "overdense regions start contracting and they become thin shells ( mimicking structures ) , while underdense regions become larger ( mimicking voids ) , and eventually they occupy most of the volume .",
    "let us explain why the high density shell forms and the nature of the shell crossing . because of the distribution of matter , the inner part of the hole is expanding faster than the cheese ; between these two regions there is the initial overdensity .",
    "it is because of this that there is less matter in the interior part .",
    "( remember that we matched the frw density at the end of the hole . )",
    "now we clearly see what is happening : the overdense region is squeezed by the interior and exterior regions which act as a clamp .",
    "shell crossing eventually happens when more shells ",
    "each labeled by its own @xmath22are so squeezed that they occupy the same physical position @xmath102 , that is when @xmath103 .",
    "nothing happens to the photons other than passing through more shells at the same time : this is the meaning of the @xmath104 metric coefficient going to zero .",
    "a remark is in order here : in the inner part of the hole there is almost no matter , it is empty",
    ". therefore it has only negative curvature , which is largely dominant over the matter : it is close to a milne universe .",
    "we are mostly interested in observables associated with the propagation of photons in our swiss - cheese model : indeed , our aim is to calculate the luminosity - distance ",
    "redshift relation @xmath105 in order to understand the effects of inhomogeneities on observables .",
    "our setup is illustrated in fig.[schizzo ] , where there is a sketch of the model with only @xmath106 holes for the sake of clarity .",
    "notice that photons are propagating through the centers .",
    "we will discuss two categories of cases : 1 ) when the observer is just outside the last hole as in fig .",
    "[ schizzo ] , and 2 ) when the observer is inside the hole .",
    "the observer in the hole will have two subcases : a ) the observer located on a high - density shell , and b ) the observer in the center of the hole .",
    "we are mostly interested in the first case : the observer is still a usual frw observer , but looking through the holes in the swiss cheese .",
    "we will discuss now the equations we will use to find the path of a photon through the swiss cheese .",
    "the geodesic equations can be reduced to a set of four first - order differential equations ( we are in the plane @xmath107 ) : @xmath108 where @xmath109 is an affine parameter that grows with time .",
    "the third equation is actually the null condition for the geodesic .",
    "thanks to the initial conditions chosen we have @xmath110 .",
    "these equations describe the general path of a photon . to solve the equations we need to specify the constant @xmath111 , a sort of angular momentum density .",
    "a first observation is that setting @xmath112 allows us to recover the equations that describe a photon passing radially trough the centers : @xmath113 .",
    "we are interested in photons that hit the observer at an angle @xmath114 and are passing trough all the holes as shown in fig .",
    "[ schizzo ] . to do this",
    "we must compute the inner product of @xmath115 and @xmath116 , which are the normalized spatial vectors tangent to the radial axis and the geodesic as shown in fig.[frecce ] .",
    "a similar approach was used in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    ".,width=9 ]    the inner product of @xmath117 and @xmath118 is expressed through @xmath119 the vectors are anchored to the shell labeled by the value of the affine parameter @xmath120 , that is , to the border of the hole .",
    "therefore , they are relative to the comoving observer located there . in the second equation",
    "we have used the initial conditions given in the previous set of equations , while to find the last equation we have used the null condition evaluated at @xmath120 .",
    "the above calculations use coordinates relative to the center .",
    "however , the angle @xmath114 is a scalar in the hypersurface we have chosen : we are using the synchronous and comoving gauge .",
    "therefore , @xmath114 is the same angle measured by a comoving observer of fig .",
    "[ frecce ] located on the shell @xmath121 : it is a coordinate transformation within the same hypersurface .    given an angle @xmath114 we can solve the equations .",
    "we have to change the sign in eq .",
    "( [ rgeo ] ) when the photon is approaching the center with respect to the previous case where it is moving away .",
    "also , we have to sew together the solutions between one hole and another , giving not only the right initial conditions , but also the appropriate constants @xmath111 ( see appendix [ sewing ] ) .",
    "eventually we end up with the solution @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 and @xmath125 from which we can calculate the observables of interest .",
    "finding the solution in this case is the same as in the previous case with the only difference that in eq .",
    "( [ rgeo ] ) the initial condition is now @xmath126 .",
    "but this observer has a peculiar velocity with respect to an frw observer passing by .",
    "this , for example , will make the observer see an anisotropic cosmic microwave background as it is clear from fig .",
    "[ imodel ] .",
    "this doppler effect , however , is already corrected in the solution we are going to find since we have chosen @xmath110 as initial condition .",
    "there is however also the effect of light aberration which changes the angle @xmath114 seen by the comoving observer with respect to the angle @xmath127 seen by an frw observer .",
    "the photon can be thought as coming from a source very close to the comoving observer : therefore there is no peculiar motion between them .",
    "the frw observer is instead moving with respect to this reference frame as pictured in fig .",
    "[ doppler ] .",
    "the relation between @xmath114 and @xmath127 is given by the relativistic aberration formula : @xmath128 the angle changes because the hypersurface has been changed .",
    "the velocity will be taken from the calculation ( see fig .",
    "[ curved ] for the magnitude of the effect ) .     between observers.,width=9 ]",
    "the angular diameter distance is defined as : @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the proper diameter of the source and @xmath114 is the angle at which the source is seen by the observer . using this definition to find @xmath131 we have @xmath132 the luminosity distance will then be : @xmath133 the formula we are going to use for @xmath131 is exact in the limit of zero curvature .",
    "however in our model @xmath74 is on average less than @xmath134 and never more than @xmath135 , as it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ e ] : therefore the approximation is good .",
    "moreover , we are interested mainly in the case when the source is out of the last hole as pictured in fig .",
    "[ schizzo ] , and in this case the curvature is exactly zero and the result is exact .",
    "we have checked that the computation of @xmath131 is independent of @xmath114 for small angles and that the result using the usual frw equation coincides with theoretical prediction for @xmath131 .",
    "we also checked that @xmath131 reduces to @xmath5 when the observer is in the center .",
    "finally we checked our procedure in comparison with the formula ( @xmath136 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite : this is a rather different way to find the angular distance and therefore this agreement serves as a consistency check .",
    "we placed the observer in the same way and we found the same results provided that we use the angle @xmath114 uncorrected for the light - aberration effect .",
    "now we will look through the swiss cheese comparing the results with respect to a frw - eds universe and a @xmath0cdm case .",
    "we will first analyze in detail the model with five holes , which is the one which we are most interested in . for comparison , we will study models with one big hole and one small hole . in the model with one big hole",
    ", the hole will be five - times bigger in size than in the model with five holes : _",
    "i.e. , _ they will cover the same piece of the universe .",
    "the observables on which we will focus are the changes in redshift @xmath125 , angular - diameter distance @xmath137 , luminosity distance @xmath105 , and the corresponding distance modulus @xmath4 .",
    "now we will first compare the redshift undergone by photons that travel through the model with either five holes or one hole to the frw solution of the cheese . in fig .",
    "[ zorro ] the results are shown for a photon passing through the center with respect to the coordinate radius .",
    "as one can see , the effects of the inhomogeneities on the redshift are smaller in the five - hole case .    .",
    "notice also that along the voids the redshift is increasing faster : indeed @xmath138 and the voids are expanding faster.,width=16 ]    it is natural to expect a compensation , due to the spherical symmetry , between the ingoing path and the outgoing one inside the same hole .",
    "this compensation is evident in fig .",
    "[ zorro ] .    however , there is a compensation already on the scale of half a hole as it is clear from the plots .",
    "this mechanism is due to the density profile chosen , that is one whose average matches the frw density of the cheese : roughly speaking we know that @xmath139 .",
    "we chose the density profile in order to have @xmath140 , and therefore in its journey from the center to the border of the hole the photon will see a @xmath141 and therefore there will be compensation for @xmath142 .",
    "let us see this analytically .",
    "we are interested in computing a line average of the expansion along the photon path in order to track what is going on .",

    "this is exactly the result we wanted to find .",
    "however , we have performed an average at constant time and therefore we did not let the hole and its structures evolve while the photon is passing : this effect will partially break the compensation .",
    "this sheds light on the fact that photon physics seems to be affected by the evolution of the inhomogeneities more than by the inhomogeneities themselves .",
    "we can argue that there should be perfect compensation if the hole will have a static metric such as the schwarzschild one . in the end , this is a limitation of our assumption of spherical symmetry .",
    "this compensation is almost perfect in the five - hole case , while it is not in the one - hole case : in the latter case the evolution has more time to change the hole while the photon is passing . summarizing ,",

    "it is finally interesting to interpret the redshift that a photon undergoes passing the inner void .",
    "the small amount of matter is subdominant with respect to the curvature which is governing the evolution , but still it is important to define the space : in the limit of zero matter in the interior of the hole , we recover a milne universe , which is just ( half of ) minkowski space in unusual coordinates . before this limit",
    "the redshift was conceptually due to the expansion of the spacetime , after this limit it is instead due to the peculiar motion of the shells which now carry no matter : it is a doppler effect .",

    "the solution shows an oscillating behavior which is due to the simplification of this toy model in which all the voids are concentrated inside the holes and all the structures are in thin spherical shells .",
    "for this reason a fitting curve was plotted : it is passing through the points of the photon path that are in the cheese between the holes .",
    "indeed , they are points of average behavior and represent well the coarse graining of this oscillating curve .",
    "the simplification of this model tells us also that the most interesting part of the plot is farthest from the observer , let us say at @xmath159 . in this region",

    "first of all , we note that we are able to reproduce their results using our techniques .",
    "the difference between their results and ours is that our model has very strong nonlinear evolution , in particular , close to shell crossing where we have to stop the calculation .",
    "the authors of ref.@xcite also used smaller holes with a different density / initial - velocity profile .",
    "this demonstrated that a large change in observables may require either non - spherical inhomogeneities , or evolution very close to shell crossing .",
    "( we remind the reader that caustics are certainly expected to form in cold dark matter models . )",
    "let us return now to the reason for our results .",
    "as we have seen previously , due to spherical symmetry there are no significant redshift effects in the five - hole case .",
    "therefore , these effects must be due to changes in the angular - diameter distance . fig .",
    "[ bend ] is useful to understand what is going on : the angle from the observer is plotted . through the inner void and the cheese",

    "the bending occurs near the peak in the density where the @xmath161 coefficient of the metric goes toward zero .",
    "indeed the coordinate velocity of the photon can be split in an angular part : @xmath162 and a radial part @xmath163 .",
    "while @xmath164 behaves well near the peak , @xmath165 goes to infinity in the limit where shell crossing is reached : the photons are passing more and more matter shells in a short interval of time as the evolution approaches the shell - crossing point .",
    "although in our model we do not reach shell crossing , this is the reason for the bending .",
    "we therefore see that all the effects in this model , redshift and angular effects , are due to the evolution of the inhomogeneities .    .",
    "the shaded regions represent the inner frw solution .",

    "[ 1big ] the results are more dramatic : for high redshifts the swiss - cheese curve can be fit by a @xmath0cdm model with less dark energy than @xmath167 as in the five - hole model .",

    "( [ uffa ] ) we see that to achieve an inhomogeneous profile we can either assign a homogeneous profile at an inhomogeneous initial time , or an inhomogeneous density profile at a homogeneous initial time , or both .",
