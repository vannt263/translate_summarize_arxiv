    "in many studies of the interstellar medium , it is essential to determine accurately the amount of molecular gas along the line of sight .",
    "however , the most abundant molecule , h@xmath19 , not only has a large excitation temperature ( @xmath20509  k ) , which is not usually attainable in a cold interstellar medium , but also has very small rotational transition probabilities . in order to infer the h@xmath19 column density @xmath15 , therefore ,",
    "we generally rely on indirect methods . the most well - known indirect method for estimating the h@xmath19 column density is to observe other molecules such as co , cs , or nh@xmath21 . however , the fractional abundance of a molecule relative to h@xmath19 is unlikely to be uniform from one cloud to another , or even sometimes within a cloud .",
    "in addition , there may be some differences among the distributions of individual molecules because of their different photochemical properties . in the case of co , which has been widely used as a tracer of h@xmath19 ,",
    "the abundance varies from cloud to cloud by up to three orders of magnitude depending on the visual extinction and astrochemical properties ( scoville @xmath22 sanders 1987 ; van dishoeck @xmath22 black 1988 ; magnani @xmath22 onello 1995 ) .",
    "the infrared all - sky maps produced by the _ infrared astronomical satellite _ ( @xmath2 ) mission presented a new opportunity to study the distribution of interstellar molecular gas .",
    "the galactic radiation in the far - infrared ( far - ir ) appears to arise mostly from dust grains well - mixed with interstellar gas ( mathis , mezger , @xmath22 panagia 1983 ) .",
    "the @xmath2 100  @xmath5 m  emission intensity , @xmath3 , has been found to be tightly correlated with the total column density of interstellar gas at @xmath235@xmath24 , and the 100  @xmath5 m  emissivity per hydrogen nucleus , @xmath3/@xmath7 , seems to be fairly uniform in the solar neighborhood : @xmath3/@xmath7@xmath161  mjy  sr@xmath13  ( 10@xmath11  @xmath12)@xmath13  ( de vries et al .",

    "therefore , @xmath3  excess , i.e. , the @xmath2 100  @xmath5 m  emission in excess of what is expected from the hi column density , could be used as a tracer of h@xmath19 in regions where the amount of ionized gas is negligible .",
    "based on such an idea , several groups have identified `` infrared - excess ( ir - excess ) '' clouds in order to investigate the distribution of molecular gas",
    ". however co observational studies on the ir - excess  clouds showed that there is a substantial difference between the distribution of ir - excess  clouds and that of co - emitting clouds ( dsert , bazell , @xmath22 boulanger 1988 ; blitz , bazell , @xmath22 dsert 1990 ; heithausen et al .",

    "this discrepancy between the two distributions is in a sense expected , because firstly the dust abundance and radiation - field strength vary , and secondly the co abundance is low in diffuse molecular clouds , and finally the infrared emissivity of the dust associated with molecular gas is low .",
    "another @xmath2 method for tracing molecular gas is to use 100  @xmath5 m  optical depth , @xmath4 .",
    "this might be more accurate than using 100  @xmath5 m  intensity , at least in principle , because optical depth is simply proportional to the amount of dust along the line of sight if dust properties are the same .",
    "indeed , for several high - latitude clouds , 100  @xmath5 m  ( or 60  @xmath5 m ) optical depth has been found to be correlated with molecular gas column density better than the 100  @xmath5 m  intensity alone ( langer et al .",

    "` iras ' clouds similar to the ir - excess  clouds have been identified using this method , too ( wood et al . 1994 ) .",
    "these previous studies , which were limited to high latitudes ( @xmath25@xmath2610@xmath24 ) , however , simply calculated dust optical depth after subtracting flat background emission from the 60 and 100  @xmath5mintensity maps and showed that it had a very good correlation with the integrated intensities of co isotopes .    in this paper",
    ", we make a detailed comparison of 100  @xmath5 m  intensity , 100  @xmath5 m  optical depth , and the distribution of co emission along several one - dimensional cuts .",
    "our study differs from most previous studies in that we use both high - resolution ( @xmath03@xmath1 ) hi and co data in the analysis ( cf .",
    "reach et al .",
    "the hi data make it possible to derive accurate correlations between @xmath4  ( or @xmath3 ) and @xmath27 , which is used to identify ` @xmath4-excess ' ( or @xmath3-excess ) regions and to estimate the excess column densities of h nuclei .",

    "the co emission from region e is also possibly related to the worm although its central velocity is somewhat lower than the velocity of the worm .",
    "the physical association of molecular gas with gw46.4 + 5.5  will be discussed in a separate paper ( kim et al .",
    "as we have mentioned in section 3.1 , the regions at @xmath35=1@xmath24  ( a and b ) are not included in our analysis because of the complication due to the presence of ionized gas .",

    ", the sources in the second category , i.e. , molecular clouds without @xmath3  excess , could be present because of the low emissivity of dust grains associated with molecular gas .",
    "if there were no embedded heating source in the molecular cloud , the dust temperature drops from the surface to the center of the cloud . according to mathis et al .",
    "( 1983 ) , for example , the dust temperature drops by about 3  k from the edge to the center for a cloud with @xmath62=5  mag .",
    "the 100  @xmath5 m  emissivity of dust grains is very sensitive to dust temperature and changes by about 40% as dust temperature changes by 1  k over the range 18@xmath6325  k. at @xmath34@xmath1646.@xmath643 in region c , the low emissivity almost completely counterbalances the significant fraction of @xmath3  excess  from dust grains associated with molecular gas .",

    "according to our results , @xmath4  excess  appears to be an accurate indicator of the molecular content along the line of sight ; it not only traces the presence of molecular gas correctly but also increases linearly with the amount of molecular gas .",
    "there are two reasons for this .",
    "first it separates the intensity peaks produced by enhanced infrared emissivity .",
    "second it corrects for the low infrared emissivity of molecular clouds . in the present work , however , there are two limitations as discussed below .",
    "the first limitation stems from using a mean temperature in deriving @xmath4  along the line of sight .",
    "the expression for @xmath15  in equation ( 4 ) is , in fact , an exact one if dust properties and the dust - to - gas ratio remain the same in atomic and molecular regions . in practice",
    ", however , there is an error because , in deriving @xmath4  on the right hand side of equation ( 4 ) , we have used an average color temperature along the line of sight ( defined in equation ( 2 ) ) even if we need to use different color temperatures in deriving the optical depths of atomic and molecular regions .",
    "it is straightforward to estimate the error when there are only two dust components with different emissivities along the line of sight .",
    "if there is atomic gas of optical depth @xmath4(hi ) at color temperature @xmath78  and molecular gas of optical depth @xmath4(h@xmath19 ) at @xmath79(@xmath32@xmath78 ) , the ratio of the optical depth @xmath80 , derived by using a mean color temperature , to the true optical depth @xmath4 is given by    @xmath81 } ^{\\frac{\\lambda_{60}/\\lambda_{100 } } { 1 - \\lambda_{60}/\\lambda_{100 } } } \\frac{1+r~{\\rm exp}(-\\triangle t)}{1+r},\\ ] ]    where @xmath82 , @xmath83 ( @xmath84)(1/@xmath85 @xmath30 1/@xmath86 ) , and the other parameters have the same meaning as in section 3 .",
    "the derived optical depth is always less than the true value and , as expected , the difference converges to zero as @xmath87 approaches zero or infinity .",
    "figure 6 shows , as solid lines , how @xmath88 varies in the ( @xmath87 , @xmath89 ) plane .",
    "the ratio @xmath88 is affected more strongly by the warmer dust associated with atomic gas in the sense that the error in optical depth is larger at @xmath90=@xmath91 ( @xmath921 ) than that at @xmath90=1/@xmath91 for a given value of @xmath89 .",
    "similar figures can be found in langer et al .",
    "( 1989 ) and snell et al .",
    "( 1989 ) , but figure 6 is a generalized one . the error in optical depth would induce an error in @xmath15@xmath59 .",

    "the ratio @xmath15@xmath94/@xmath15@xmath59 is in general smaller than @xmath88 for a given ( @xmath87 , @xmath89 ) pair .",
    "the most striking difference between the two quantities is that , as @xmath87 approaches zero , the error in @xmath15@xmath59 remains constant for given @xmath89 whereas that in @xmath4 tends to zero .",
    "since the visual extinction is @xmath95@xmath161.5  mag at the co peak in region d using @xmath7/@xmath95=1.9@xmath910@xmath96  @xmath97  mag@xmath13 ( bohlin , savage , @xmath22 drake 1978 ) , @xmath79  is expected to be @xmath323  k lower than @xmath78  ( mathis et al . 1983 ) .",
    "therefore , the error in @xmath15@xmath59 may be @xmath9820% in region d where @xmath991/2 ( see figure 6 ) .",
    "the error in the correction factor @xmath69 is directly related to that in @xmath15@xmath59 because it is actually derived from @xmath15@xmath94/@xmath15@xmath60 : @xmath100=@xmath15@xmath94/@xmath15@xmath59 .",
    "the second limitation derives from using @xmath101  in estimating the dust optical depth .",

    "in addition , the low signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath101  could introduce a large error in @xmath4 . at low latitudes , on the contrary , the @xmath4-excess  distribution is expected to represent the distribution of molecular gas much better than the @xmath3-excess  distribution , because the number density of luminous stars increases and most molecular clouds contain high - extinction regions and/or embedded luminous stars .      in the case of region",

    "assuming that @xmath118 varies as @xmath119 , the total excess infrared luminosity from the @xmath101/@xmath3   enhanced region can be derived from the following formula :    @xmath120 d\\omega,\\ ] ]    where @xmath42 is the stephen - boltzmann constant , @xmath108 is the distance to the massive star , and the subscript b indicates quantities in the absence of the star .",

    "using @xmath108=2.2  kpc and @xmath125=25.2  k ( @xmath101/@xmath3=0.22 with @xmath47=1.5 ) , the total excess infrared luminosity is @xmath126=6500  @xmath127  over a solid angle of @xmath128=2.4@xmath910@xmath129  sr .",
    "this value is an order of magnitude smaller than the stellar luminosity , @xmath130=2.2@xmath910@xmath131  @xmath127  ( panagia 1973 ) .",
    "hence , the star has enough luminosity to produce the observed infrared luminosity , and the @xmath3-excess  peak at @xmath35=46.@xmath640 in region c is probably due to heating by an o - type giant star .",
    "infrared ( ir ) excess , defined as the emission in excess of what would be expected from hi emission , has been used for estimating the amount of molecular gas along the line of sight . however , at the same time , there have been molecular , particularly co , line studies showing that the method does not necessarily yield reliable results .",
    "that is , there are both ir - excess  regions without detectable co and co - emitting regions without ir excess .",
    "region c in our study is a good example .",

    ", the sources that fall into the second category could be molecular clouds with low ir emissivity . in region c",
    ", the low emissivity completely hides the presence of a molecular cloud in the infrared .",
    "our result shows that we can avoid the above confusion problem by using the optical - depth excess instead of ir excess , i.e. , the optical depth in excess of what would be expected from hi emission .",
    "we have found a very good correlation between 100  @xmath5 m  optical - depth ( @xmath4 ) excess and integrated intensity of co emission , @xmath6 .",

    "a more complete observation is necessary for the study of the variation of the conversion factor .",
    "another merit of using optical - depth excess , which may be more important , is that it gives an _ accurate _",
    "value for the amount of molecular gas .",
    "ir excess would significantly underestimate @xmath15  if one uses an ir emissivity estimated from hi emission , @xmath67 .",
    "we have introduced a correction factor @xmath17 , which should be applied in order to account for the different ir emissivity of molecular clouds . in general",

    "d in our study , @xmath133",
    ". we should therefore be rather cautious in converting ir excess to @xmath15 .",
    "two potential problems in using optical - depth excess , however , would be the low surface brightness and the contribution of small , transiently heated grains . if the surface brightness is low , the noise and/or the systematic errors produced in the subtraction of zodiacal emission may make it impossible to derive an accurate optical depth",
    ". it would be worthwhile to check the applicability of the method at high galactic latitudes .",
