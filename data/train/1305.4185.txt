    "<S> the ensuing de - mixing provides a phoretic force that propels the particles since the two hemispheres possess different surface properties with respect to water and lutidine . unlike catalytic swimmers  @xcite , e.g. , particles propelled in a h@xmath0o@xmath0 solution  @xcite where the molecular solute is `` consumed '' by the chemical reaction , in the setup used here the environment is not affected by the local de - mixing due to the reversibility of the spinodal decomposition . </S>",
