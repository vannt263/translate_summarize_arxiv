    "in the n - body problem the central configurations are the configurations such that the total newtonian acceleration of every body is equal to a constant multiplied by the position vector of this body with respect to the center of mass of the configuration .",
    "one of the reasons why central configurations are interesting is that they allow us to obtain explicit homographic solutions of the n - body problem i. e. motion where the configuration of the system changes its size but keeps its shape .",
    "they also arise as the limiting configuration of a total collapse .",
    "the papers dealing central configuration has focus in several points as finding example of particular central configuaration , giving the number of central configuration , its symmetry , stability , stacking properties , i. e. central configuration that contains others central configuration by dropping some bodies , etc .",
    "we can cite several references to reader about this theme ; see e.g. @xcite,@xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this work deals with central configurations of the planar @xmath1-body problem , in the case where we have one dominant mass and @xmath2 infinitesimal masses , called satellites , on a plane .",
    "the planar @xmath3 body problem was treated by maxwell @xcite trying to construct a model for saturn s rings .",
    "many other contribution there are in the literature for this problem . considering satellites with equal masses , casasayas , llibre and nunes @xcite improving a previous result of glen hall @xcite proving that the regular polygon is the only central configuaration if @xmath4 .",
    "cors , llibre and oll @xcite obtain numerically evidences that there is only one central configuration if @xmath5 and that every central configuration is symmetric with respect to a straight line .",
    "moreover they proved that there are only 3 symmetric central configurations of the @xmath0 body problem .",
    "albouy and fu @xcite proved that all central configurations of four identical satellites are symmetric which settles the question in the case @xmath0 .",
    "in the recent work @xcite , oliveira and cabral worked with stacked planar central configuration of the @xmath3 body problem in two cases : adding one satellite in a central configuaration with different satellites and adding two satellites considering equal all infinitasimal masses .",
    "renner and sicardy @xcite obtained results about giving a configuration of the coorbital satellites , find the infinitesimal masses making it a central configuration .",
    "they also studied the linear stability of this configuaration .",
    "corbera , cors and llibre @xcite considering the @xmath6 body problem , found two different classes exhibiting symmetric and nonsymmetric configurations . and when two infinitesimal masses are equal , they provide evidence that the number of central configurations varies from five to seven .    in this work",
    "we are interested in the central configurations of the planar @xmath0 body problem where the satellites have diferent masses .",
    "the satellites lie on a circle centered at the big mass and we treated the cse where two of them are diametrically opposite and nonconsecutive in the circle : for example we can suppose the big mass , the first satellite and the third one are collinear .",
    "the reader can observe that this problem is a stacked central configuaration too since the collinear @xmath7 configuration is a central one .",
    "we develop in this section the formulation of this well known problem .",
    "basically it references our previous work @xcite .",
    "consider @xmath8 pontual masses , @xmath9 , in @xmath10 subject to their mutual newtonian gravitational interaction .",
    "let @xmath11 be the matrix of masses and let @xmath12 be the position vector .",
    "the equations of motion in an inertial reference frame with origin at the center of mass are given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the newtonian potential .",
    "a non - collision configuration @xmath15 with @xmath16 is a _ central configuration _ if there exists a positive constant @xmath17 such that @xmath18    we consider the planar @xmath19 body problem , where the big mass is equal to 1 with position @xmath20 .",
    "the remaining @xmath21 bodies with positions @xmath22 , called satellites , have masses @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 is a small parameter that tends to zero .",
    "so we say that @xmath26 is a planar central configuaration of @xmath3 bodies if @xmath27    in all central configuration of the planar @xmath3 body problem the satellites lie on a circle centered at the big mass ( @xcite ) , i.e. the satellites are coorbital .",
    "since we are interested in central configuration modulus rotations and homothetic transformations , we can assume that the circle has radius 1 and that @xmath28 .",
    "we exclude collisions in the definition of central configuration and take as coordinates the angles @xmath29 between two consecutive particles .",
    "see e.g. @xcite for details . in this",
    "coordinates the space of configuration is the simplex @xmath30 and the equations characterizing the central configurations of the planar 1+n body problem are @xmath31 where @xmath32 +    we say that a solution @xmath33 of the system ( [ sistemageral ] ) is a central configuration of the planar @xmath3 body problem associated to the masses @xmath34 .",

    "analogously @xmath73    from ( [ t1eq1 ] ) and ( [ t1eq4 ] ) , we get @xmath74 so @xmath75 and consequently @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",

    "it s concludes the proof .",
    "the remaining results concern the first case in figure [ fig14 ] namely the collinear satellites are not consecutive in the circle .",

    "furthermore the other satellites have the same mass @xmath83 .    since @xmath84 we get @xmath85    hence , by ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq3 ] ) @xmath86    from ( [ eq1 ] ) , @xmath87 if and only if @xmath88 .",

    "we count the number of central configuration of this problem in the general case . by last theorem",
    "the configuration are symmetric and two satellites have the same infinitasimal masses .",
    "next theorem also shows that additional equality of the some infinitesimal masses are equivalent to existence of special configuration as a square and a kite .",
    "[ theorem2 ] let @xmath60 be a central configuration of the planar @xmath0 body problem associated to masses parameters @xmath61 .",
    "suppose that @xmath136 .",
    "then for all values of the masses parameters the number of classes of central configuration is one , two or three .",
    "moreover the square @xmath137 is a central configuration if and only if @xmath138 and the kite @xmath139 is a central configuration if and only if @xmath140    by theorem [ theorem1 ] we know that @xmath141 so the equations ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq3 ] ) are redundant and ( [ eq2 ] ) and ( [ eq4 ] ) are equivalent to each other and they become @xmath142    we must to say how many roots in @xmath42 has the function @xmath143    it s easy to see that @xmath144 if @xmath145 and @xmath146 if @xmath147 .",

    "let @xmath166 the central configurations are determinated by equation @xmath167 with @xmath168 again , consider the function @xmath169 given by @xmath170    since @xmath171 then @xmath172 is increasing .",
    "moreover @xmath173 because @xmath174 , so we have that @xmath126 is the minimal value of @xmath175 in @xmath42 .",
    "we obtain @xmath176    so if @xmath177 then @xmath178 and consequently @xmath151 have only one root in @xmath42 . as @xmath126 is always a root of @xmath151 ,",
