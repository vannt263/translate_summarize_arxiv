    "the evolution of large scale structure over cosmic time is a key test of the standard concordance cosmological model , and a tool for estimating cosmological parameters . surveys designed to identify large samples of galaxy clusters are now producing catalogs of clusters with well - defined selection functions over large fractions of the sky @xcite , and extensive efforts are underway to characterize observable proxies for cluster masses in order to convert cluster catalogs into robust measurements of cluster abundances as a function of mass and redshift ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "most observable quantities  optical light , x - ray light , and the sunyaev zeldovich ( sz ) effect  trace baryonic matter in clusters , but cluster mass and density profiles on large scales are dominated by dark matter .",
    "the dark matter content in galaxy clusters is most directly probed via the gravitational lensing effect ; weak lensing measures the shape of the gravitational potential at relatively large radii while strong lensing provides detailed constraints on the mass structure within the cores of galaxy clusters .",
    "weak lensing observations of galaxy clusters have become a powerful tool in recent years @xcite but galaxy clusters exhibiting strong lensing remain are a rare subset of the larger population .",
    "in this paper we present spectroscopic follow - up of a subset of a large sample of several hundred giant arcs discovered in the sdss @xcite and rcs-2 .",
    "two forthcoming papers will describe the full giant arc samples discovered in the sdss ( m.  d. gladders et al .",
    "2011 , in prep ) and the rcs-2 ( m.  b. bayliss et al .",
    "2011 , in prep ) .",
    "these giant arc samples are intended primarily to address the persistent lack of large , well - selected catalogs of giant arcs which can be compared against @xmath8cdm predictions for giant arc statistics , as well as to provide statistical samples of strong lensing clusters that can be used to study the detailed structure of cluster cores and mass distributions .",
    "a large sample of strong lensing clusters also increases the volume of the high - redshift universe that is available for observations with the aid of foreground cluster lenses serving as `` natural telescopes . '' from the data presented here we recover spectroscopic redshifts for a sample of @xmath2 background sources behind @xmath0 distinct cluster cores , many of which are obviously multiply imaged , and all of which are likely magnified by the foreground cluster potentials .",
    "these data represent a significant extension in the number of confirmed strong lensing clusters  especially at @xmath9  and provide a sample of cluster lenses that we use to test predictions for the characteristic masses of such systems .    where necessary we assume a flat cosmology with @xmath10 km s@xmath11 mpc@xmath11 , @xmath12 and matter density @xmath13 .",
    "the targeted strong lensing clusters were initially identified in one of several visual searches for giant arcs in an exhaustive sample of red - sequence selected clusters in the sdss and rcs-2 surveys .",
    "our visual searches produced three distinct giant arc samples , each of which has different visual selection criteria .",
    "the sdss `` visual '' sample ( gladders , m.  d. et al . , in prep ) is composed of candidate strong lensing clusters that were identified in the relatively shallow sdss survey imaging .",
    "we confirmed the lensing interpretation in follow - up @xmath14-band imaging on @xmath15 m class telescopes .",
    "the sdss `` blind '' sample consists of strong lensing clusters that were identified in follow - up @xmath16band imaging of the most massive @xmath17 clusters , as selected by the red sequence from the sdss photometry @xcite . the rcs-2 giant arc sample ( bayliss , m.  b. et al .",
    ", in prep ) is defined in the same way as the sdss visual sample , but uses imaging data that is @xmath18 magnitudes deeper than the sdss , with a median seeing of @xmath19 , and therefore facilitates morphological classifications on par with the follow - up imaging of the sdss giant arcs . see @xcite for a detailed description of the rcs-2 data .",
    "we have adopted a naming convention for giant arcs discovered in the sdss sloan giant arc survey(sgas ) jhhmmss+ddmmss @xcite  and giant arcs discovered in the rcs-2  red - sequence cluster survey giant arc ( rcsga ) jhhmmss+ddmmss ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "these two surveys for giant arcs have produced hundreds of strong lensing clusters , and we followed - up a subset of these systems spectroscopically .",
    "we observed a sample of @xmath0 clusters with the frederick c. gillett telescope ( gemini north ) between february 2008 and june 2010 as part of gemini programs gn-2008a - q-25 and gn-2009a - q-21 .",

    "the deeper @xmath14-band images were used to place slits targeting the bright arcs manually , and photometric catalogs from the sdss dr7 @xcite were used to identify cluster member galaxies by their presence on the red sequence .",
    "spectroscopic masks for each cluster were designed using object positions and colors from the photometric catalogs .",
    "the highest priority slits were manually placed on candidate lensed background sources as identified by color and morphology , and then the mask was filled in with lower priority slits placed on red sequence selected cluster members with @xmath47 in the photometric catalogs .",
    "this flux limit corresponds to a luminosity limit of @xmath48l@xmath49 for each cluster , depending on the cluster redshift .",
    "all spectroscopic observations were carried out with gmos using the custom slitmasks described above .",
    "spectra were taken using the macroscopic nod - and - shuffle ( n&s ) mode available on gmos .",
    "the use of macroscopic n&s allows for small slits and increases the density of slits that we can place in the cores of the target clusters .",
    "we use a modified version of the standard macroscopic n&s mode wherein we shuffle the charge by one third of the detector along the spatial axis , while nodding the telescope on the sky by one sixth of the detector .",
    "a mask is designed to cover the central third of the detector that is effectively a combination of two `` sub - masks '' , each of which primarily targets a region on the sky approximately one sixth the size of the detector . with the nod distance set to one sixth of the detector size , the targeted region on the sky",
    "is nodded from one spectroscopic sub - mask to the other , such that we collect science spectra for this region during @xmath50 of the total exposure time of the observation .",
    "our strategy avoids the @xmath51 overheads that are necessary for a simple macroscopic band n&s observation by enabling us to design two independent masks covering the central sixth of the detector along the spatial axis .",
    "the two sub - masks are optimized to place slits on as many candidate strong lensing features as possible , with slits often placed on the most prominent arcs in both sub - masks to gather data on those sources for the full exposure time of the observations .",
    "additionally , the sub - masks can include slits targeting sources located in an area equal to the size of one sixth of the detector to either side of the central region .",
    "these regions include red sequence selected cluster members that we use to fill in gaps in the slitmask after placing slits on all candidate strong lensing features .",

    "n&s offers several benefits that are especially advantageous for pursuing redshifts of candidate strongly lensed sources .",
    "firstly , n&s provides for better sky - subtraction @xcite , especially at lower spectral resolutions , than traditional longslit or multi - slit spectroscopy .",
    "excellent sky - subtraction over a large range of wavelengths is crucial for identifying galaxy redshifts at @xmath52 , which often relies on spectral lines that are redshifted into the red ( i.e. @xmath53 ) where sky lines are numerous .",
    "secondly , a macroscopic n&s strategy allows us to cut slits matching the sizes of target sources , as small as @xmath54 microslits , which can be densely packed into the cores of our strong lensing clusters to target as many arcs , arclets , and cluster members as possible .",
    "our modified n&s approach complements the size of the gmos detector very nicely .",
    "the gmos detector array is approximately @xmath55 in size ; this means that we can optimize slit placement in the central @xmath56of the target clusters , which corresponds well with the core regions probed by strong lensing .",
    "all spectra taken as a part of the gn-2008a - q-25 program used the r150_g5306 grating in first order with the detector binned @xmath33 , producing an average dispersion of @xmath57   per image pixel and a six pixel spectral resolution element .",
    "the resulting spectral fwhm is @xmath58 km s@xmath11 , corresponding to a spectral resolution , @xmath59 , and cover a spectral range , @xmath60 , with our highest sensitivity in the interval , @xmath61 .",
    "our effective spectral range is limited at both the blue and red ends by the sensitivity of both the gmos ccds and the transmission efficiency of the grating .",
    "the masks for gn-2008a - q-25 spectroscopy were designed using only slitlets of @xmath62 , many of which could be placed along the longest arcs .",
    "the n&s cycle time for all 2008a spectra was 60s .",
    "analysis of the gn-2008a - q-25 spectra motivated us to change the instrumental setup for gn-2009a - q-21 spectroscopy . we no longer restricted ourselves to only @xmath63 microslits , but instead increased the spatial extent of our slits along the arcs and occasionally tilted them to better cover an arc or achieve optimal slit packing .",
    "all spectra taken in the gn-2009a - q-21 program used the r400_g5305 grating in first order , in conjunction with the gg455_g0305 longpass filter , and with the detector binned by @xmath44 in the spectra direction and unbinned spatially .",
    "this configuration produces a dispersion of @xmath64   per ( binned ) spectral pixel and spectral resolution of @xmath65 km s@xmath11 or @xmath66 with a wavelength coverage , @xmath67 .",
    "the observed wavelength range for slits located near the centers of our masks is @xmath68 .",
    "given the performance of the gmos ccds at the very blue and red ends we find that the r400_g5305 grating loses very little effective wavelength coverage compared to the r150_g5306 , while improving the quality of the n&s sky subtraction , as well as our ability to measure reliable absorption line redshifts for arcs located in the redshift desert .    a persistent problem in our 2008a observations were systematics in the n&s sky subtraction caused by charge traps .",
    "the amount of trapped charge depends sensitively on the detector binning and the amount of charge shuffling ( i.e. the n&s cycle length ) . after conducting experiments with dark frames we found that the detector binned by @xmath44 in the spectral direction and unbinned spatially provided the best compromise between trapped charge and increased read noise .",
    "we also experimented with two different n&s cycle lengths , 60s and 120s , the former of which optimizes sky subtraction and the later of which minimizes the negative impact of charge traps .",
    "we obtained test observations for one of our masks with both cycles lengths , and found that the quality of the n&s sky subtraction was not significantly diminished for the 120s cycles , which we opted to use throughout the remainder of our 2009a observations .",
    "table [ tabobs ] shows which targets were observed from gemini north in 2008a and 2009a , along with the integration times for each mask .",
    "sky subtraction of n&s data is achieved by simply differencing the two shuffled sections of the detector .",
    "all of our spectra were wavelength calibrated , extracted , stacked , flux normalized , and analyzed using a custom data reduction pipeline which we developed based on the xidlxavier / idl / index.html ] and the sdss idlspec2d software packages .",
    "we extract individual spectra and perform all stacking in 1d using a rejection algorithm to exclude cosmic rays and hot pixels .",
    "our masks were not observed at the parallactic angle , and we relied on archival standards in the gmos data archive to determine the sensitivity function , thus our flux calibration is only approximate .",
    "in addition to the gemini / gmos - north spectroscopy , we supplement our dataset with cluster member redshift measurements made at the 3.5 m astrophysical research consortium ( arc ) telescope at apache point observatory in new mexico , using the dual imaging spectrograph ( dis ) in longslit mode .",
    "the apo+dis observations were taken using the b400 and r300 gratings on the red and blue sides , respectively , and a @xmath69 slit .",
    "science exposures were accompanied by henear arc calibrations and quartz lamp flatfield exposures at the same orientation in order to minimize systematics errors due to instrument flexure .",
    "the resulting data were reduced , calibrated , sky - subtracted , extracted and stacked using custom idl scripts that incorporate procedures from the xidl software package .",
    "all redshifts measured from the apo+dis data came out of the red side spectra , which cover an wavelength range @xmath70   at a dispersion of @xmath71  pixel@xmath11 , resulting in spectral resolution @xmath72 .",
    "we observed rcs2 j1055 + 5547 on the night of march 17 , 2007 at two different orientations selected to simultaneously put @xmath73 bright red sequence selected cluster member candidates and @xmath73 arc candidates within the slit . at each orientation",

    "these data do , however , serve as the first step in characterizing our complete sample .",
    "our spectroscopic follow - up efforts are on - going , and in the future we will target a broader range of systems as function of r@xmath269 . furthermore , given a large sample of strong lensing systems it becomes possible to measure higher order statistics for giant arcs , such as the distribution of r@xmath269 and the dependence of quantities such as median source redshift and median lensing cluster mass as a function of r@xmath269 .",
    "in this context it is not essential that we conduct spectroscopic follow - up of a random assortment of our giant arc sample , but rather it will be crucial that we take account for our selection in terms of r@xmath269 in future analyses .    based on modest numbers of spectroscopically confirmed cluster members per cluster lens , we have calculated dynamical masses for the foreground lensing clusters .",
    "the raw masses that we calculate clearly confirm the predictions that selecting clusters by strong lensing samples the high - mass tail of the mass function at a given epoch of the universe ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . from our sample of @xmath188 dynamical masses",
    "we can compute the median strong lensing cluster mass and compare that to the predicted median @xmath339 for strong lensing selected clusters from @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that @xcite calculate the virial mass of their strong lensing selected clusters according to the prescription in @xcite , whereas the @xcite relation provides a dynamical mass at a fixed over - density radius , @xmath340 .",
    "the differences in the subtleties of how these masses are defined will produce offsets between their values for a given cluster halo that can vary as a function of redshift and cosmology @xcite . to compare our results directly to the median virial mass of strong lensing clusters in @xcite",
    "we convert the @xmath286 values that result from the @xcite scaling relation into @xmath341 values according to the prescription in @xcite .",
    "we also point out that the simulations used in @xcite were run in a cosmology with @xmath342 , which is markedly higher than current best constraints @xcite .",
    "we can make a simple approximate correction for the high @xmath343 by simply scaling the @xcite cross - section - weighted median @xmath341 by the ratio of the mass function calculated for @xmath342 and @xmath12 , summed over all halos with @xmath344 , as this is the approximate mass where @xcite find that the cross - section for strong lensing becomes negligibly small .",
    "it is important to point out that this approximation explicitly ignores the effect that @xmath343 has on the strong lensing cross - section of halos of a given mass , but we assume this to be a sub - dominant effect compared to the scaling of the mass function . taking the fitting formula from @xcite we calculate that the predicted median @xmath341 for @xmath12 should be @xmath345 smaller than for the @xmath342 used in the simulations in @xcite , resulting in a predicted median @xmath346 .",
    "the median virial mass of our strong lensing clusters is @xmath7 , approximately @xmath347 larger that the prediction from @xcite .",
    "we hesitate to draw strong conclusions from the discrepancy in median mass between our cluster lens samples and predictions for simulations for several reasons .",
    "for one , the errors on our dynamical mass estimates are extraordinarily large due to systematic errors associated with the small numbers of cluster member redshifts available .",
    "we might also be concerned with a possible bias in our sample resulting from the selection of lenses with larger r@xmath269  mentioned above  as targets for gemini spectroscopy .",
    "we can examine the data directly for some relationship between r@xmath269 and the dynamical m@xmath348 values , and we find no correlation between these two quantities .",
    "we have reason to expect that this selection is not biasing our median lensing cluster mass for the purpose of comparing against @xcite because in that paper the mean virial mass is computed for clusters producing giant arcs with @xmath349 , which is comparable to the minimum r@xmath269 for our sample of spectroscopically observed clusters .",
    "there is however an additional source of predictable bias that should inflate dynamical mass estimates of any sample of strong lensing selected clusters .",
    "it is understood that strong lensing selected clusters as a population are biased with respect to several important properties when compared against the general cluster population @xcite .",
    "one of the notable biases is the spatial orientation of the cluster mass distribution .",
    "the virialized halos that host galaxy clusters are triaxial , and clusters which are efficient strong lenses are more likely to have their major axes aligned along the line of sight with respect to the observer , so we must assume that our sample of strong lensing selected clusters exhibit have this `` orientation bias '' .",
    "we are therefore measuring the projected velocity dispersion of galaxies that should tend to be preferentially aligned along the major axis of the cluster potential .",
    "studies of the position and velocity ellipsoids of triaxial halo potentials in n - body simulations find that halo velocity shapes are more spherical than halo positional shapes , but that the velocities are still significantly triaxial and generally well - aligned with the positional orientation of the halo to within @xmath350 @xcite .",
    "this means that the projected velocity dispersions measured for a sample of clusters that have an orientation bias with the major axis aligned along the line of sight into the sky will be biased high with respect to velocity dispersions measured for clusters that are randomly oriented on the sky .",
    "@xcite determine that the average velocity shape for cluster - scale halos has a minor - major axis ratio of @xmath351 and an intermediate - major axis ratio of @xmath352 .",
    "the ratios characterize the relative magnitude of the particle velocity dispersions in halos projected along the three principle axes of the halo velocity ellipsoid .",
    "if we were to measure particle velocities  or in real observable terms , member galaxy velocities  in projection purely along the major velocity axis for a sample of clusters , then our resulting velocity dispersions would be biased @xmath353 high with respect to the average velocity dispersion measured from a sample of randomly oriented clusters .",
    "studies of strong lensing halos in simulations find that the population of halos that are the most effective strong lenses are not any more triaxial that the general halo population @xcite , so we have no reason to expect that the positional shapes and velocity shapes of an ensemble of strong lensing clusters should have more extreme values for the minor - major and intermediate - major axis ratios than the general cluster population .",
    "therefore we take the worst case scenario from above for overestimation of the velocity dispersion of a cluster due to orientation bias and consider the resulting overestimation of @xmath286 .",
    "we use a fit for the virial relation between @xmath354 and @xmath286 from @xcite : @xmath355 for which the authors find a best fit @xmath356 . given this scaling dependence , a sample of measured velocity dispersions that are on average @xmath353 high due to orientation bias will result in mass estimates that are biased high by @xmath357 on average .",
    "this is the extreme case for orientation bias , corresponding to a sample of clusters that are all aligned with their major axes pointing along the line of sight .",
    "the above computations assume the most extreme possible orientation bias : always being aligned with the major axis along the line of sight .",
    "simulations predict that strong lensing selected clusters will have a significant orientation bias , but not that @xmath358 strong lensing selected clusters will be perfectly oriented along the line of sight . @xcite predict a median value of @xmath359 for the alignment angle between the line of sight to the observer and the positional major axis for strong lensing selected clusters , compared to the @xmath360 that you would expect for cluster that are randomly oriented on the sky .",
    "@xcite report predictions for three subsets of strong lensing clusters defined in different ways : 1 ) `` critical clusters '' are those which have critical lines , 2 ) clusters which are capable of producing giant arcs , and 3 ) clusters which have a strong lensing cross - section for giant arcs that is larger than @xmath361 .",
    "we conservatively take the most selective and therefore most strongly biased subset  clusters with strong lensing cross - section for giant arcs greater than @xmath361 and note that this population in the @xcite simulations have a median alignment angle of @xmath362 , corresponding to @xmath363 , which is in excellent agreement with the results from @xcite .",
    "we combine these two predictions for the median alignment angle of the halo major axis and the average axis ratio values from @xcite to estimate the average bias we can anticipate in velocity dispersions measured for strong lensing selected clusters to be @xmath364 high relative to dynamical masses measured for a cluster sample that is randomly oriented on the sky .",
    "our estimate of the expected bias in @xmath354 measured for strong lensing selected clusters assumes that the position and velocity ellipsoids for clusters are perfectly aligned , but this turns out not to be the case .",
    "@xcite measure a median alignment angle of @xmath365 between the position and velocity ellipsoids , where the orientation biases from @xcite and @xcite refer to the alignment of the position ellipsoid .",
    "this tendency toward misalignment should reduce the expected bias for velocity dispersions of strong lensing clusters because it adds an element of randomization to the orientation of the velocity ellipsoid on the sky with respect to the line of sight of the observer .",
    "this randomness should reduce the impact of the orientation bias of strong lensing clusters on velocity dispersion measurements .",
    "specific predictions for the magnitude of this reduction require convolving the probability distributions for the position orientation angle of strong lensing selected clusters from @xcite and @xcite with the probability distribution of the orientation angle between the position and velocity principle axes from @xcite .",
    "the effect should be small , but we do not have the necessary probability distributions in hand and leave additional corrections to the anticipated dynamical mass bias for future work with higher fidelity data .",
    "the dynamical mass estimates presented here are intended only to gain a rough understanding of @xmath341 for our cluster sample .    correcting the predicted median lensing cluster @xmath341 from @xcite for a @xmath366 bias due to orientation effects we find an expected median @xmath367 , which is still @xmath368 small than the median @xmath341 of our strong lensing cluster sample .",
    "this kind of discrepancy is not especially problematic when we consider the large errors on our dynamical mass estimates .",
    "we also note that the semi - analytic models of @xcite suggest that the orientation bias for strong lensing clusters with the largest einstein radii is likely even more extreme from the predictions from simulations .",
    "therefore , depending on the true values of the einstein radii for our clusters , it is possible that our sample has a significantly larger underlying orientation bias than we accounted for in the preceding calculations , which would result in a much larger mass bias .",
    "we could also be suffering from a selection bias in the sample of cluster member galaxies for which we are measuring velocities .",
    "our cluster galaxy redshifts are all measured in a field approximately @xmath369 that is centered roughly on the cores of our strong lensing clusters , where the size of this field is constrained by the field of view of gmos .",
    "we are therefore confining our velocity measurements to galaxies that are within the central regions of these clusters , with no ability to sample galaxy velocities at larger projected radii on the sky .",
    "projected 1d velocities in the cores of clusters should be higher than the average projected 1d velocities within @xmath340 , which is the quantity that we use to scale @xmath354 into @xmath286 . estimating the effect of this potential cluster member sampling bias requires knowledge of @xmath340 for each cluster , and we use equation 8 from @xcite to estimate @xmath340 from @xmath354 for our cluster lenses .",
    "our clusters have a mean @xmath370 mpc h@xmath11 , and a mean angular size of the sky of @xmath371 . therefore our cluster member sample , which is drawn from within an average angular radius of @xmath372 of the cluster cores is only sampling cluster galaxies within the central @xmath373 , on average .",
    "this sampling bias is likely contributing to the high median @xmath341 that we measure for our cluster lens sample compared to the mean @xmath341 reported in @xcite .",
    "we present the results of gemini / gmos - north n&s multi - object spectroscopy of @xmath0 strong lensing selected galaxy clusters .",
    "analysis of our complete spectroscopic dataset yields precise redshifts for @xmath2 likely lensed background sources , many of which are multiply imaged by the foreground lensing potentials .",
    "this dataset dramatically extends the number of strong lensing clusters with redshifts available to inform strong lens modeling of the mass structure in the cluster cores , especially at @xmath9 .",
    "we also characterize the total virial masses of our strong lensing clusters via cluster member dynamics for comparison against predictions for the typical mass of strong lensing selected clusters in simulations . by combining predictions from simulations for the position and velocity shapes of halos with predictions for the orientation bias of clusters selected by strong lensing we account for the anticipated bias in dynamical masses calculated for strong lensing selected clusters , calculating it to be between @xmath374 .",
    "the median virial mass of our sample of strong lensing selected galaxy clusters is in reasonable agreement with predictions , though still somewhat high and possibly suggestive of a more severe orientation bias in our sample than is predicted for strong lensing clusters based on simulations .    with the coming era of large area deep imaging surveys ( e.g. panstarrs , des , lsst )",
    "we are poised to extend samples of strong lensing selected galaxy clusters into the thousands . in order to take full advantage of future strong lensing cluster samples",
    "it is crucial that we understand the properties and biases of this intriguing subset of galaxy clusters .",
    "the analysis presented here is a first step in this direction , and we are only beginning to fully exploit the new samples of hundreds of strong lensing clusters available in the sdss and rcs2 surveys .",
    "further follow - up of these lens samples will also pave the way for higher order analyses , such as combining information from strong lensing with multi - wavelength observations ( e.g. dynamics of @xmath375 cluster members , x - ray , sz ) of a @xmath376 sample of strong lensing clusters in order to quantify the biases between different mass observables .",
    "these kinds of biases must be quantified and thoroughly understood before information gained from analyses of strong lensing clusters can be intelligently applied to scaling relations and mass estimates for the general cluster population .",
    "an empirical characterization of strong lensing selected clusters is necessary if we hope to take full advantage of the additional information provided by strong gravitational lensing in the cores of clusters .",

    "<S> the @xmath0 galaxy cluster lenses span a redshift range of @xmath1 , and our spectroscopy reveals @xmath2 unique background sources with redshifts as high as @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we also identify redshifts for @xmath4 cluster member galaxies and measure the velocity dispersions and dynamical masses for @xmath5 clusters where we have redshifts for @xmath6 cluster member galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we include an accounting for the expected biases in dynamical masses of strong lensing selected clusters as predicted by results from numerical simulations and discuss possible sources of bias in our observations . </S>",
    "<S> the median dynamical mass of the @xmath5 clusters with @xmath6 spectroscopic cluster members is @xmath7 , which is somewhat higher than predictions for strong lensing selected clusters in simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the disagreement is not significant considering the large uncertainty in our dynamical data , systematic uncertainties in the velocity dispersion calibration , and limitations of the theoretical modeling . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless our study represents an important first step toward characterizing large samples of clusters that are identified in a systematic way as systems exhibiting dramatic strong lensing features . </S>"
