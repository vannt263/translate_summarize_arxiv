    "the spin and flavor content of the nucleon has been an extensively studied issue for well over a decade , since the emc  @xcite announced that the strange quark is strongly polarized opposite to the valence quarks , indicating that the quarks carry only a small fraction of the nucleon spin .",
    "in contrast to the ellis - jaffe sum rule @xcite , the polarization of the strange quark turned out to be nonnegligible .",
    "a series of following experiments confirmed the emc result  @xcite .",
    "hence , it is also natural to investigate the structure of other baryons . in particular",
    ", the @xmath9 hyperon is interesting , since @xmath10 are related to the fragmentation functions which can be measured experimentally @xcite . according to the naive quark model the spin of @xmath9 comes solely from the strange quark , while the up and down quarks form the spin singlet , so that they make no contribution .",
    "however , an analysis based on the data of hyperon semileptonic decays and lepton - nucleon deep - inelastic scattering  @xcite predicts @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "this analysis assumes , however , the flavor su(3 ) symmetry , _ i.e. _ it uses the relations : @xmath13 and @xmath14 , with @xmath15 identical for all octet baryons .",
    "it implies that the @xmath9 spin is not completely carried by the strange quark .",
    "while the above analysis shows a discrepancy with the naive quark model , one should note that the effect of su(3 ) symmetry breaking was not taken into account .",
    "recently , we have investigated hyperon semileptonic decays and the spin content of the nucleon with su(3 ) flavor symmetry breaking taken into account  @xcite .",
    "the su(3 ) symmetry breaking was implemented via the chiral quark - soliton model ( @xmath16qsm ) in such a way that all dynamical variables in the model were fixed by the experimental data for the semileptonic decay constants .",
    "the results for the proton were : @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 .",
    "the large errors in @xmath21 and @xmath22 are due to the large experimental uncertainties of the @xmath23 decay constants .",
    "the conclusion in that work was as follows : first , statements concerning @xmath21 and @xmath22 based on su(3 ) flavor symmetry are premature .",
    "second , accurate results can be obtained only by reducing the experimental uncertainty for @xmath24 decays .",
    "it is of great interest to study the spin content of the @xmath9 , using the same framework as in ref .",
    ". the aim of this paper is thus to find out what we can reliably conclude on the spin structure of the @xmath25 , based on hyperon semileptonic decays .",
    "let us first briefly recall how the standard analysis is carried out .",
    "three diagonal axial - vector coupling constants define integrated polarized quark densities for a given baryon b : @xmath26 note that in our normalization @xmath27b@xmath28 @xmath29 .    assuming su(3 ) symmetry",
    ", one can calculate @xmath30b@xmath31 in terms of the reduced matrix elements @xmath32 and @xmath33 . for the proton and @xmath34 one",
    "gets : @xmath35    the constants @xmath32 and @xmath33 can be in principle extracted from the hyperon semileptonic decays .",
    "for example : @xmath36 for convenience , we denote the ratios of axial - vector to vector decay constants by @xmath37 ( see table i ) .",
    "taking for these decays experimental values ( see table i ) , one gets @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "since @xmath27b@xmath31 does not correspond to the su(3 ) current , it can not be expressed in terms of @xmath32 and @xmath33 without further assumptions .",
    "thus , in order to extract all @xmath40 separately , one needs some additional information .",
    "either another experimental input is needed , or a model which predicts @xmath27b@xmath31 in terms of the @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the first possibility can be realized by taking the experimental result for the first moment of the spin structure function @xmath41 of the proton : @xmath42 recent analysis  @xcite implies @xmath43 which translates into : @xmath44 if @xmath45 is assumed .",
    "taking for @xmath38 and for @xmath39 together with eq.([gampval ] ) , one gets for the nucleon : @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , which implies @xmath49 , a fairly small number as compared with the naive expectation from the quark model : @xmath50 .",
    "it is important to realize that @xmath22 is not directly measured ; it is extracted from the data through some theoretical model . in the above example",
    "we have assumed the su(3 ) symmetry and used two arbitrarily chosen hyperon decays ( [ a1a4exp ] ) .",
    "one could , however , use any two @xmath37 s out of 6 known hyperon decays to extract @xmath32 and @xmath51 the number of combinations which one can form to extract @xmath32 and @xmath33 is 14 ( actually 15 , but two conditions are linearly dependent ) . taking these 14 combinations into account",
    ", one gets : @xmath52 these are the uncertainties of the _ central values _ due to the theoretical error caused by using the exact su(3 ) symmetry to describe the hyperon semileptonic decays .",
    "these uncertainties are further increased by the experimental errors of all individual decays .",
    "looking at eq.([fdrange ] ) , one might get an impression that a typical error associated with using su(3 ) symmetry in analyzing the hyperon decays is of the order of 15 % or so . while this is true for the hyperon decays",
    ", the values of @xmath53 and @xmath54 of the various baryons might be much more affected by the symmetry breaking . indeed for @xmath32 and @xmath33 corresponding to ( [ fdrange ] ) and @xmath55 as given by eq.([gampval ] ) @xmath56 .",
    "as will be shown in the following , the @xmath57qsm predicts in the chiral limit  @xcite : @xmath58 for any baryon b. here @xmath59 is very sensitive to small variations of @xmath32 and @xmath33 , since it is a difference of the two , with relatively large multiplicators .",
    "indeed , for the 14 fits mentioned above the central value for @xmath59 of the nucleon varies between @xmath60 to approximately 1 and a similar feature is expected for any baryon , particularly for the @xmath9 .",
    "thus , despite the fact that hyperon semileptonic decays are relatively well described by the model in the chiral limit , the singlet axial - vector constant is basically undetermined .",
    "this is a clear signal of the importance of the symmetry breaking for this quantity .",
    "one could argue that this kind of behavior is just an artifact of the @xmath16 qsm .",
    "however , the scenario of a rotating soliton ( which is by the way used also in the skyrme - type models ) is very plausible and can not be _ a priori _ discarded on the basis of first principles .",
    "the @xmath16qsm is a particular realization of this scenario and we use it as a tool to investigate the sensitivity of the singlet axial - vector current to the symmetry breaking effects in hyperon semileptonic decays .",
    "in fact , conclusions similar to ours have been obtained in chiral perturbation theory in ref.@xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we have at length discussed the properties of the model formula for @xmath59 in two limiting cases , _",
    "i.e. _ large ( skyrme model limit ) and small ( quark model limit ) soliton sizes . in the skyrme model the ratio @xmath61 and @xmath22 vanishes . in the quark model @xmath62 and @xmath63 , and therefore @xmath64 .",
    "we also gave numerical arguments in support of our approach : namely releasing the model assumptions concerning @xmath65 and using @xmath55 as an additional input one arrives at almost identical numerical results as using ( [ ga0 ] ) .",
    "it is virtually impossible to analyze the symmetry breaking in weak decays without resorting to some specific model  @xcite . in this paper , following ref .",
    "@xcite , we will implement the symmetry breaking for the hyperon decays using the @xmath16 qsm ( see ref.@xcite for review ) which satisfactorily describes the axial - vector properties of hyperons @xcite @xcite .",
    "the model provides a link between the matrix elements of the octet of the axial - vector currents , responsible for hyperon decays , and the matrix elements of the singlet axial - vector current . in the present work we will study the relation between hyperon semileptonic decays and integrated polarized quark distributions for the @xmath9 hyperon .",
    "we will use the @xmath16qsm only to identify the algebraic structure of the symmetry breaking ( @xmath66 corrections ) .",
    "the dynamical quantities , so called inertia parameters which are in principle calculable within the model @xcite , will be treated as free parameters . by adjusting them to the experimentally known semileptonic",
    "decays we allow not only for maximal phenomenological input but also for minimal model dependence . in ref.@xcite",
    "we have already studied the magnetic moments of the octet and decuplet in this way .",
    "such a  model - independent  approach  used for example by adkins and nappi @xcite in the context of the skyrme model  is of interest for at least two reasons .",
    "first , it can be considered as a qcd - motivated tool to analyze and classify ( in terms of powers of @xmath67 and @xmath68 ) the symmetry - breaking terms for a given observable .",
    "for nontrivial operators such as axial - vector form factors a general analysis , without referring to some specific model , is virtually impossible .",
    "second , this  model - independent  analysis provides an information for the model builders as well .",
    "it tells us what are the best predictions the model can ever produce .",
    "indeed , model calculations in the framework of the @xmath16qsm are not as unique as one might think : they depend on adopted regularizations , cutoff parameter , or the constituent quark mass .",
    "moreover , in the su(3 ) version of the @xmath16qsm a quantization ambiguity appears  @xcite .",
    "therefore , if the `` model - independent '' analysis would have failed to describe the data , that would mean that the model did not correctly include all necessary physics relevant for a given observable . on the other hand , the success of such an analysis gives a strong hint for the model builders that the model is correct and worth exploring .",
    "as far as the symmetry breaking is concerned , our results are identical to the ones obtained in refs.@xcite within qcd in the large @xmath69 limit .",
    "indeed , the @xmath16qsm is a specific realization of the large @xmath70 limit .",
    "the truly new ingredient of our analysis is the model formula for the singlet axial - vector constant @xmath59 , _ i.e. _ eq.([ga0 ] ) , which we use to calculate quantities relevant for polarized high energy experiments .",
    "the discussion in this section follows closely ref .",
    "the transition matrix elements of the hadronic axial - vector current @xmath71 can be expressed in terms of three independent form factors : @xmath72 u_{b_1}(p_1),\\ ] ] where the axial - vector current is defined as @xmath73 with @xmath74 for strangeness conserving @xmath75 currents and @xmath76 for @xmath77 .",
    "similar expressions hold for the hadronic vector current , where the @xmath78 are replaced by @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) and @xmath81 by @xmath82 .",
    "hadronic matrix elements such as @xmath83 can be easily evaluated within the @xmath16qsm  @xcite . taking into account the @xmath84 rotational and @xmath85 corrections , we can write the resulting axial - vector constants @xmath86 in the following form . ] : @xmath87 .",
    "\\label{eq : g1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) stand for the @xmath90-th ( third ) component of the spin operator of the baryons .",
    "the @xmath91 denote the su(3 ) wigner matrices in representation @xmath92 .",
    "the @xmath93 denote parameters depending on the specific dynamics of the chiral soliton model ( see for example refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "their explicit form in terms of a goldstone mean field can be found in ref .",
    "as mentioned already , in the present approach we will not calculate this mean field but treat @xmath93 as free parameters to be adjusted to experimentally known semileptonic hyperon decays .",
    "because of the su(3 ) symmetry breaking due to the strange quark mass @xmath94 , the collective baryon hamiltonian is no more su(3)-symmetric .",
    "the octet states are mixed with the higher representations such as antidecuplet @xmath95 and eikosiheptaplet @xmath96  @xcite . in the linear order in @xmath67 the wave function of a state @xmath97 of spin @xmath98",
    "is given as : @xmath99 where @xmath100 .",
    "mixing parameters @xmath101 can be found for example in ref .",
    "they are given as products of a numerical constant @xmath102 depending on the quantum numbers of the baryonic state @xmath103 and a dynamical parameter @xmath104 depending linearly on @xmath67 ( which we assume to be 180  mev ) and the model parameter @xmath105 , which is responsible for the splitting between the octet and higher exotic multiplets  @xcite .",
    "analogously to eq.([eq : g1 ] ) , one obtains in the @xmath16qsm diagonal axial - vector coupling constants . in that case",
    "@xmath106 can take two values : @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "for @xmath109 ( singlet axial - vector current ) we have the following expression @xcite : @xmath110    this equation is remarkable , since it provides a link between an octet and singlet axial - vector current .",
    "it is the most important model input in our analysis .",
    "pure qcd - arguments based the large @xmath111 expansion  @xcite do not provide such a link . moreover , due to the structure of the matrix element @xmath112 , the @xmath113b@xmath31 are identical inside the isospin multiplets .",
    "we predict much stronger symmetry breaking for the @xmath2 than for the proton , since @xmath114 for spin @xmath115 .    instead of calculating 7 dynamical parameters @xmath116 and @xmath105 ( which enters into @xmath117 and @xmath118 ) within the @xmath16qsm , we shall fit them from the hyperon semileptonic decays data .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the following set of 7 new parameters : @xmath119 @xmath120    employing this new set of parameters , we can express all possible semileptonic decays of the octet baryons : @xmath121 the u(1 ) and su(3 ) axial - vector constants @xmath122 can be also expressed in terms of the new set of parameters ( [ eq : newp ] ) . in the case of the proton and the @xmath2 we have the singlet axial - vector constants : @xmath123 for the triplet ones , we write s are proportional to @xmath124 , formulae in eq.([eq : triplet ] ) correspond to the highest isospin state . ] : @xmath125 and for the octet one , we obtain : @xmath126    let us finally note that there is certain redundancy in eq.([eq : semilep]-[eq : octet ] ) , namely by redefinition of @xmath90 and @xmath127 we can get rid of the variable @xmath128 : @xmath129",
    "as shown in the last section there are 6 free parameters which have to be fitted from the data .",
    "there are 2 _ chiral _ parameters : @xmath130 and @xmath131 , related closely to @xmath32 and @xmath33 : @xmath132 and 4 proportional to @xmath67 : @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath135 , and @xmath136 .",
    "since there are six known hyperon semileptonic decays , we can express all model parameters as linear combinations of these decay constants , and subsequently all quantities of interest can be expressed in terms of the input amplitudes . in the following",
    "we will use the experimental values of refs .",
    "@xcite , which are presented in table i.    before doing this , let us , however , observe that there exist two linear combinations @xmath37 s which within the model are free of the @xmath67 corrections : @xmath137 solving eq.([rs0 ] ) for @xmath130 and @xmath131 , we obtain the _ chiral - limit _",
    "expressions for hyperon semileptonic decays and integrated quark densities ( i.e. with @xmath138 ) . the corresponding @xmath32 and",
    "@xmath33 take the following form : @xmath139 numerically : @xmath140 with these values for @xmath32 and @xmath33 together with eq.([gampval ] ) one gets : @xmath141 , @xmath47 and @xmath142 , which implies @xmath143 .",
    "the advantage of using eq.([fdai ] ) consists in the fact that @xmath32 and @xmath33 do not need to be refitted when @xmath144 corrections are added .    another important point is , that eq.([fdai ] ) is more general than the model considered here .",
    "in fact they follow from the large @xmath145 qcd , as discussed in ref .",
    "the errors come from the experimental errors of the decay amplitudes and are dominated by the errors of the @xmath146 decays .",
    "it is of utmost importance to reduce the errors of these decays in order to get better accuracy for @xmath32 and @xmath33 .    in the case of the @xmath2 eq.([ga38fd ] ) implies that @xmath147 and one has in the chiral limit : @xmath148 numerical values @xmath149 and @xmath150 ( see table ii ) are closer to the naive quark model expectations : @xmath151 and @xmath152 , than to the numbers quoted in ref.@xcite : @xmath153 and @xmath154 .",
    "this is reflected in the fact that @xmath155 ( which is identical to all hadrons ) reads : @xmath156 and is much larger than the value required by using @xmath55 as an additional input . indeed , as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , in the chiral limit one is not able to reproduce the value of @xmath157 ( see table ii ) .",
    "the two least known amplitudes @xmath158 and @xmath159 are almost entirely responsible for the errors of @xmath160 . however , since the coefficients which enter into eqs.([uds0l],[gl0 ] ) are not too large , the absolute errors are relatively small .",
    "the full expressions are obtained by solving the remaining 4 equations for @xmath85 dependent parameters @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath135 and @xmath161 .",
    "also in this case we are able to link integrated quark densities @xmath162 to the hyperon decays : @xmath163    to guide the eye it is convenient to restore the linear @xmath144 dependence for the quark densities in the following way : @xmath164 and similarly for @xmath15 .",

    "we have denoted theoretical errors as error bars around the black dots which correspond to the chiral limit and full theoretical prediction .",
    "the splitting between the proton and the @xmath9 is caused by the term proportional to @xmath169 in eq.([eq : singlet ] ) .",
    "numerical values can be found in table ii .",
    "we see that for @xmath170 mev apart from fitting all hyperon semileptonic decays ( which is our input ) we reproduce @xmath55 with relatively small error .",
    "the errors of @xmath171 and @xmath172 are much bigger .",
    "the central values , however , differ from the `` standard '' ones .",
    "interestingly @xmath21 in proton is rather large and positive , however , the error bars are so large that the quark model value @xmath173 is not excluded . in the @xmath2",
    "the @xmath174 is larger than 1 , but again the errors are large .",
    "the errors for @xmath175 and @xmath176 both in the proton and in the @xmath2 are much smaller . for the @xmath2",
    "we get that the non - strange quarks almost do not carry spin in surprising accordance with the expectations of the naive quark model .",
    "as already discussed , the errors on for @xmath162 s and @xmath15 come almost entirely from the large errors of the @xmath23 decays ( @xmath158 and @xmath159 ) .",
    "instead of using these two hyperon semileptonic decays @xmath158 and @xmath159 as input , we can use the experimental value for @xmath55 as given by eq.([gampval ] ) and @xmath177 , which we vary in the range from 0 to 1 . in fig.3",

    "our analysis is identical to qcd analysis in the large @xmath69 of ref.@xcite .",
    "the new ingredient of our analysis consists in using the model formula for the singlet axial - vector current in order to make contact with the high energy polarization experiments .",
    "the model contains 6 free parameters which can be fixed by 6 known hyperon decays .",

    "there are two points which have to be stressed here .",
    "our fit respects chiral symmetry in a sense that the leading order parameters @xmath130 and @xmath131 ( or equivalently @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) are fitted to the linear combinations of the hyperon decays which are free from @xmath67 corrections . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite it is impossible to use the su(3 ) symmetric parametrization as given by eq.([rs0 ] ) and reproduce @xmath55 ( as far as the central values are concerned ) . with @xmath67 corrections turned on one hits the experimental value for @xmath189 ( see table ii ) , however , the value of @xmath22 is practically undetermined , due the the experimental error of @xmath23 decays .",
    "the nature of the @xmath144 is such that the central value of @xmath190 is relatively large , whereas @xmath21 is positive , however , still compatible with 0 within large errors .",
