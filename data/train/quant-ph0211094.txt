    "within the hidden measurement approach to quantum mechanics @xcite entanglement has been studied for a system consisting of two entangled spin @xmath0 particles in the singlet state @xcite . in such a case ,",
    "typical epr correlations are encountered , meaning that if one of both spins collapses in a certain direction under the influence of a measurement , then the other spin collapses in the opposite direction . in @xcite",
    "these results were generalized to give a description of entanglement as a hidden correlation between the proper states of the individual subsystems .",
    "our aim is to elaborate on these results , more specifically , we want to develop a geometrical representation of entanglement by means of an internal constraint between the states of the spin 1/2 particles , represented on the sphere , for an arbitrary tensor product state that is not necessarily the singlet state .",
    "we do this by introducing constraint functions , which describe the behavior of the state of one of the spins if measurements are executed on the other spin . in @xcite the internal constraint was given a real physical classical mechanics representation , namely by means of a rigid rod .",
    "an interesting question remained whether it is also possible for non singlet states to invent a similar mechanistic device .",
    "for the individual spin 1/2 entities we use a sphere model representation developed within the hidden measurement approach to quantum mechanics @xcite , which is a generalization of the bloch or pauli representation , such that also the measurements are represented .",
    "we identify a parameter @xmath1 $ ] , arising from the schmidt diagonal decomposition , that is a measure of the amount of entanglement , such that for @xmath2 the system is in the singlet state with maximal entanglement ( and we recover previous results ) , and for @xmath3 the system is in a pure product state . for intermediate values of @xmath4",
    "we encounter new situations in which entanglement is expressed by a rotation and distortion of the sphere , representing the state of the single spin 1/2 entities .",
    "concerning measurements and their effect on one of the spins in an entangled state when executed on the other spin , we consider on the one hand a measurement on a pure state followed by a collapse of the state , as prescribed by von neumann s formula , and on the other hand a measurement on a mixed state resulting in a new mixed state , as prescribed by luder s formula .",
    "we will show that an arbitrary collapse measurement on one spin provokes a rotation and a stretching on the other spin , which can be described in detail by means of the sphere model , and an arbitrary measurement on one of the two spins in a density state does not provoke any change in the partial trace density matrix of the other spin , i.e. , the spins behave as separated entities for such measurements .",
    "the sphere model is a generalization of the bloch sphere representation , such that also the measurements as well as a parameter for non - determinism can be represented @xcite . in this model , a spin 1/2 state @xmath5",
    "is represented by the point @xmath6 on the surface of a 3-dimensional unit sphere , often called bloch or poincar sphere .",
    "all points of the bloch sphere represent states of the spin , such that points on the surface correspond to pure states , while interior points correspond to density states .",
    "this is because an arbitrary point @xmath7 , @xmath8,\\theta \\in [ 0,\\pi ] , \\phi \\in [ 0,2\\pi ] $ ] , of the bloch sphere can in general be written as a convex linear combination @xmath9 from which follows the corresponding density state @xmath10 in this expression @xmath11 is the usual density state representation of a pure state , while @xmath12 is the density matrix representing the center of the sphere ( the singlet state ) .",
    "next to this , the sphere model allows a representation of _ measurements_. without loss of generality we can demonstrate the effect of such a measurement by considering states that are on the straight line connecting the north pole @xmath13 and the south pole @xmath14 of the sphere ( we use the convention that @xmath15 corresponds to spin up or @xmath16 , while @xmath17 corresponds to spin down or @xmath18 ) . in this case",
    ", the spin is in density state @xmath19 . after a measurement of the spin in the direction @xmath20 ,",
    "the density state of the spin becomes ( by means of luder s formula ) @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the projector on the ray state @xmath23 , and hence equals @xmath24 . for @xmath25",
    "$ ] , this results in the density matrix @xmath26 where @xmath27 . a similar expression @xmath28 , with @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , is obtained for @xmath32 $ ] .",
    "if we consider the sphere we can see easily that in both cases the point @xmath33 is transformed into the point @xmath34 this means that we have identified a very simple mechanics to describe the quantum measurement effect on a mixed state in our sphere model .",
    "the effect is just an ordinary orthogonal projection on the direction of the spin measurement of the point that represents the density state of the spin in the sphere model , as represented in fig . 1 .",

    "suppose that we have a spin state represented by the point @xmath35 and we perform a spin measurement in direction @xmath36 .",
    "if we denote the orthogonal projection on the direction @xmath36 by @xmath37 , the new state after this measurement is given by @xmath38 \\\\",

    "0.4 cm more concretely , consider a little sphere with as north pole the point @xmath35 , the point that represents the spin state , and as south pole the center of the big sphere of the model .",
    "the spin state is transformed to the point of intersection between this little sphere and the direction of the measurement performed .",
    "hence the points of the little sphere are those points representing the states where the spin state can be transformed to , under arbitrary angles of measurement .",
    "a system of two entangled spin @xmath39 is described by means of an arbitrary unit vector @xmath40 , in which @xmath41 and @xmath42 are two copies of @xmath43 , which we label with indices @xmath44 and @xmath45 with the sole purpose of identifying them .",
    "the vector @xmath46 can always be written as the following linear combination @xmath47 where @xmath48 , and @xmath49 and @xmath50 are bases of @xmath41 and @xmath42 respectively .",
    "when we carry out a collapse measurement on the first spin , von neumann s formula describes how it collapses into a spin state described by the unit vector @xmath51 , thus transforming the entangled state @xmath46 into @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the orthogonal projector on @xmath54 in @xmath41 , and @xmath55 is the unit operator in @xmath42 .",
    "the result is that the entangled spins end up in the following product state @xmath56 .",
    "this means that as a consequence of the measurement on the first spin , collapsing its state to @xmath54 , the second spin collapses to the state @xmath57 .    in an analogous way",
    "we can show that if a measurement is performed on the second spin , resulting in a collapse to the state @xmath58 , the state of the first spin becomes @xmath59 .",
    "because of this , we arrive at the following definition .",
    "we define the constraint functions @xmath60 and @xmath61 related to @xmath62 in the following way @xmath63    in other words , the constraint functions map the state where one of the spins collapses to by a measurement to the state that the other spin collapses to under influence of the entanglement correlation .",
    "a detailed study of the constraint functions can give us a complete picture of how the entanglement correlation works as an internal constraint .",
    "before we arrive at this complete picture , however , we give some properties of the constraint functions .",
    "one can show that the following properties hold for the constraint functions and the relation between the two constraint functions @xmath60 and @xmath61 :    the constraint functions are canonically defined .",
    "the constraint functions are conjugate linear .",
    "@xmath64 or in other words , @xmath65 equals @xmath66 i.e. , the partial trace density matrix over @xmath42 and @xmath67 equals @xmath68 i.e. , the partial trace density matrix over @xmath41 .",
    "for @xmath51 and @xmath69 we have @xmath70    to derive a complete view of how entanglement works as an internal constraint for a 2-particle system , we now work out the relation between the schmidt diagonal form ( e.g. @xcite ) and the constraint functions .",
    "we begin by choosing the base @xmath71 @xmath72 in @xmath73 with respect to this basis , expression ( [ gendensitymatrix ] ) for a general density matrix becomes @xmath74 one can choose a basis @xmath75 in @xmath42 given by @xmath76 one can show that @xmath77 @xmath78 and @xmath79 hence @xmath80 and @xmath81 are normalized eigenvectors of @xmath82 with eigenvalues @xmath83 and @xmath84 respectively .",
    "therefore , with respect to the basis @xmath85 , @xmath82 is expressed as @xmath86 finally , let us find the expression for @xmath62 with respect to the basis @xmath87 . in general , this expression is of the form @xmath88 we obtain @xmath89 thus , the schmidt diagonal form of @xmath46 is given by @xmath90",
    "with all the above we can now concentrate on the role of measurements .",
    "more particularly , we analyze how a measurement , carried out on one subentity of an entangled system , affects the state of the other subentity of which the entangled system is composed .",
    "we discuss both the effect of a measurement on density states as described by luder s formula and the effect of a collapse measurement on a pure state as described by von neumann s formula .    to describe the effect of a measurement on the density state of a subsystem we use luder s formula ( [ luder ] ) , where in this case the initial density state is calculated from the schmidt diagonal form ( [ schmidt ] ) derived above .",
    "choosing bases @xmath91 in @xmath92 and @xmath93 in @xmath94 , one can calculate the density state @xmath95 corresponding with the pure state @xmath96 after the measurement this state has changed into the density state @xmath97 given by luder s formula : @xmath98 , from which we can calculate @xmath66 i.e. , the partial trace density matrix to @xmath41 , obtaining @xmath99 this is the same density matrix as we found in expression ( [ noncollapse ] ) , i.e. after carrying out a measurement on a single spin @xmath0 in a density state . on the other hand ,",
    "if we calculate @xmath68 i.e. , the partial trace density matrix to @xmath42 , we find : @xmath100 which is independent of @xmath101 from expressions ( [ d1 ] ) and ( [ d2 ] ) , one derives that a measurement prescribed by luder s formula on one spin does not provoke any change in the partial trace density matrix of the other spin : in other words , the spins behave as separated entities for such measurements .",
    "let us now study what happens when a collapse measurement is performed on one of the subsystems in the entangled system .",
    "since the constraint functions describe exactly this , studying collapse measurements means studying the constraint function , more specifically how they map points of the sphere ( i.e. , quantum states ) onto one another . as a point of departure , we choose @xmath62 and bases as in the above , where both bases are connected through equation ( [ x22 ] ) . from these equations",
    ", we first observe that within the sphere model , they imply that the north ( south ) pole of the first sphere is mapped onto the north ( south ) pole of the second sphere .",
    "next , it follows immediately that @xmath60 does not conserve the norm .",
    "indeed , the norm of @xmath102 for an arbitrary vector @xmath103 is as follows : @xmath104 if we consider for a moment the angle @xmath105 as a variable , we see that the square of the norm varies between @xmath106 and @xmath107 , for the north ( @xmath108 ) and the south ( @xmath109 ) pole of the sphere respectively .",
    "actually , this is where the factors @xmath110 and @xmath111 in the original definition of @xmath80 and @xmath81 in equation ( [ x22 ] ) come from . not only the norm , but also orthogonality is in general not conserved by @xmath60 . for example , using the conjugate linearity of the constraint functions , we find that the two orthonormal vectors @xmath112 and @xmath113 are mapped to @xmath114 for @xmath115 orthogonality is conserved if @xmath116 with means that @xmath2 .",
    "translated on the sphere this means that diametrical opposite points are mapped to diametrical opposite points only in the special case @xmath2 ( except for the north and south pole , which are always mapped onto the north and south pole of the second sphere ) . in other words ,",
    "orthogonality only is generally conserved for the singlet state .",
    "while the norm and orthogonality are in general not conserved , we can look at the _ normalized _ image corresponding to a state @xmath117 .",
    "in other words , we would like to know where the state @xmath118 lies on the sphere .",
    "therefore , we compare corresponding inproducts on both spheres , and we obtain that    @xmath119    again , we see that only for the singlet state inproducts are equal ( and consequently , antipodal points on the sphere are mapped to antipodal points , as mentioned above ) . an interesting case is to look at the image of the equator , or in other words the points for which @xmath120 . in this case",
    "@xmath121 translating this to the sphere model , using the following formula which expresses the relation between the inproduct of two vectors in @xmath42 and the scalar product of the corresponding points in the sphere representation : @xmath122 applied to @xmath123 and @xmath80 , we obtain @xmath124 and as a consequence : @xmath125 .",
    "this means that on the sphere , the elements of the equator are mapped onto a cone that makes an angle @xmath126 with the north south axis of the second sphere , such that @xmath127 once more , only for @xmath2 this is again an equator , hence conserving the angle between the elements of the equator and the north pole . for @xmath128 0,1\\right [ $ ]",
    "we obtain a cone with an angle @xmath129 , which means that the equator has ` raised ' to the north . for @xmath4 approaching @xmath44 the sphere",
    "is stretched more and more to the north pole of the second sphere .",
    "remember that in this limit case the superposition state becomes a product state , and this fits with the fact that for product states indeed the map @xmath60 maps the first element of the product to the second . to see the general scheme we use equation ( [ inproducts ] ) , which yields @xmath130 from this result it follows that straight lines through the center of the left sphere are mapped onto straight lines through the point @xmath131 along the north south axis in the second sphere .",
    "this gives a nice geometrical representation of this ` stretching ' on the second sphere , as shown in fig .",
    ", this shows that indeed only for the singlet state antipodal points of the first sphere are mapped onto antipodal points of the second sphere .    0.7 cm -1 cm     0.3 cm 0.4 cm    9 pt figure 3 :",
    "straight lines through the center of the left sphere are mapped onto straight lines through the point @xmath132 along the north south axis in the second sphere .",
    "we elaborated a formalism to model entanglement as an internal constraint .",
    "more specifically , we show that two spin 1/2 particles in a nonproduct state can be described in a complete way by extracting entanglement into an internal constraint between the states of the particles . we introduce constraint functions , which describe the behavior of the state of one of the spins if measurements are executed on the other spin . in this way we can substitute the nonproduct state by the states of the individual particles and the internal constraint function .",
    "we make use of the sphere model representation for the spin s that was developed in brussels , allowing for an easy to grasp visual support for the developed formalism . in deriving",
    "the effect measurements on one spin of an entangled state have on the other one , we differentiated between two types of measurements : measurements , of which the action on a mixture of states is described by luder s formula , and collapse measurements , of which the action is described by von neumann s formula .",
    "our result is that ( 1 ) an arbitrary luder s measurement on one spin in a mixed state does not provoke any change in the partial trace density matrix of the other spin , i.e. , the spins behave as separated entities for such measurements ; ( 2 ) an arbitrary collapse measurement on one spin provokes a rotation and a stretching on the other spin , which gives a nice geometrical representation of how entanglement works as an internal constraint .",
    "the singlet state appears as a very special case in which norm and orthogonality are conserved .",
    "this makes it easier to understand that for the singlet state a real physical apparatus modelling the internal constraint can be built , namely a rigid rod connecting the two spins .",
    "since for non singlet states norm and orthogonality are not conserved , and the geometrical representation entails rotation and more importantly stretching of the sphere , it is not obvious that a simple machinery ( e.g. with a rigid rod ) can be constructed in this case .",
