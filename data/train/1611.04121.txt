    "theoretical studies of hypernuclei are continuously boosted by new and upgraded experimental facilities  @xcite .",
    "it is generally believed that from them one could derive various features of the underlying hyperon interactions  @xcite .",
    "they are also related to the dense stellar matter studies  @xcite , as an alternative way of obtaining the matter apart from astrophysical observations and/or quite developed many - body schemes for infinite strongly interacting systems , for example , the widely used microscopic brueckner - hartree - fock ( bhf ) theory  @xcite .",
    "lattice qcd calculation should be an ideal tool for investigating hypernucleus structure since it retains all the fundamental characters of qcd theory .",
    "indeed , the first calculation of hypernuclei with baryon number @xmath3 has been performed recently , for @xmath4he and @xmath5he  @xcite . however , a detailed and precise structure description is still beyond its reach .",
    "few - body calculations in cluster or shell - model approach are awaited for not - so - light hypernuclei ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "significant progress in the auxiliary field diffusion monte carlo method  @xcite has been achieved in the calculation of closed shell @xmath0 hypernuclei from @xmath7 to @xmath8 . for a more feasible way of the systematic study of both light and heavy hypernuclei ,",
    "effective models are generally employed . among them , many models are for single-@xmath0 hypernuclei , for example , the quark mean - field model  @xcite , the relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) approach  @xcite , the skyrme - hartree - fock model  @xcite , the quark - meson coupling model  @xcite , a relativistic point - coupling model  @xcite , the quark mass density - dependent model  @xcite , and the density - dependent rmf theory from relativistic bhf theory @xcite .",
    "the experiments , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , are the most popular reactions used to produce hypernuclei  @xcite .",
    "recently , the heavy ion collision is suggested as one way to generate hypernuclei  @xcite , such as the high energy au+au collision  @xcite , which can be considered as a liquid - gas phase transition in hypermatter .",
    "the lifetime of hypernuclei in such reactions are usually very short and the production of hypernuclei should be strongly dependent on the temperature . therefore , it is very interesting to investigate the properties of hot hypernuclei in the liquid - gas coexistence region .",
    "the matter generated from the collision of relativistic heavy ions has some probabilities to break up as the nuclear - fragment and hyper - fragment production , which can be described by the statistical multifragmentation model  @xcite .",
    "this model was also extended to the study of hypernuclei produced in heavy ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "accordingly , we want to investigate the hot hypernuclei from the aspect of the liquid - gas phase coexistence in this work . since the hot hypernucleus formed in nucleus - nucleus collisions is thermodynamically unstable against the emission of baryons , an external pressure has to be exerted on the hypernucleus to compensate for the tendency of baryon emission .",
    "this pressure is assumed to be exerted by a surrounding gas representing evaporated baryons , which is in equilibrium with the hot hypernucleus .    in order to separate the nucleus from the surrounding gas ,",
    "a subtraction procedure was first proposed in hartree - fock framework  @xcite for normal nucleus , and then used in the thomas - fermi approach  @xcite .",
    "the subtraction procedure is based on the existence of two solutions to the equations of motion of nucleons .",
    "one solution corresponds to the nucleon gas alone ( @xmath12 ) , and the other to the nuclear liquid phase in equilibrium with the surrounding gas ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the density profile of the nucleus ( @xmath14 ) is then given by subtracting the gas density from that of the liquid - plus - gas phase .",
    "finally , the physical quantities of the isolated nucleus obtained using such subtraction procedure could be independent of the size of the box in which the calculation is performed . in the past decades",
    ", this subtraction procedure has been widely applied in the non - relativistic thomas - fermi approximation with skyrme force  @xcite .    the relativistic thomas - fermi approximation with rmf lagrangian has been developed and applied to study various subjects at the subnuclear densities , such as , droplet formation  @xcite and nuclear pasta phases  @xcite .",
    "this method is considered to be self - consistent in the treatment of surface effects and nucleon distributions .",
    "the relativistic thomas - fermi approximation was also adopted to describe finite nuclei  @xcite and non - uniform nuclear matter for supernova simulations  @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the thermodynamic properties of finite nuclei were calculated within the relativistic thomas - fermi approximation , and the results obtained were found to depend on the input freeze - out volume , which was actually the size of the box for performing the calculation .",
    "recently , we developed a relativistic thomas - fermi model for the description of hot nuclei by employing the subtraction procedure , and investigated the temperature dependence of the symmetry energy of finite nuclei @xcite .",
    "actually , the results obtained from subtraction procedure are independent of the size of the box .    in this work",
    ", we would like to extend the relativistic thomas - fermi model with subtraction procedure to describe the hot @xmath0 hypernuclei , which are most known in experiment and theoretical calculation among various hypernuclei .",
    "for the nuclear interaction and @xmath15 interaction , we adopt the rmf model , which has been successfully used to study various phenomena in nuclear physics  @xcite .",
    "the thermodynamic properties of hot @xmath0 hypernuclei , such as excitation energies , specific heat , and level density parameters of hypernuclei will be investigated .    in sec .",

    "the subtraction procedure has been employed in order to separate the hypernucleus from the surrounding baryon gas . with such treatment ,",
    "the properties of hot @xmath0 hypernucleus are independent of the size of the box in which the calculation is performed .",
    "the nucleon and @xmath0 hyperon interact via the exchange of the @xmath16 and @xmath17 mesons , whose coupling constants are determined by experimental @xmath0 binding energies in the rmf model .",
    "we have studied two single-@xmath0 hypernuclei , @xmath83ca and @xmath2pb , as numerical examples in this work . at high density ,",
    "the @xmath0 gas density becomes visible and increases with temperature . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath0 density at the center of @xmath0 hypernuclei is reduced largely with temperature .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath0 densities is more remarkable than that of proton and neutron , since one hyperon is more easily excited than nucleus which are compounded of many nucleons .",
    "furthermore , the magnitudes of @xmath0 densities at the center of hypernuclei are almost inverse to the baryon numbers .",
    "the rms radius of @xmath0 hyperon is clearly different from those of proton and neutron at zero temperature .",
    "however , it increases rapidly with temperature and becomes comparable with the radii of proton and neutron , which is due to the diffusion of @xmath0 distribution at high temperature .",
    "the scalar and vector potentials of @xmath0 hyperon have been found to be reduced with temperature so that the @xmath0 binding energies become small at high temperature . the specific heat defined as the derivation of excitation energy with respect to temperature",
    "was found to be independent of the size of the box by employing the subtraction procedure , which is different from introducing the freeze - out volume to consider the temperature effect .",
    "finally we also gave the single-@xmath0 binding energies from @xmath1o to @xmath2pb at different temperatures .",
    "the binding energies are consistent with the results obtained in the rmf model at zero temperature for heavy hypernuclei . as temperature increases , the @xmath0",
    "binding energies decrease significantly .",
    "we have systematically studied the properties of hot single-@xmath0 hypernuclei above mediate mass .",
    "there are also some experimental data for light single-@xmath0 hypernuclei , double-@xmath0 hypernuclei , and @xmath124 hypernuclei .",
    "further work is required to investigate the properties of various hypernuclei at finite temperature .",
