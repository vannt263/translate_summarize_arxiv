    "the elements @xmath377 and @xmath378 for each @xmath383 are defined by pushing @xmath380 along the arcs depicted in figure [ fig : pushing2 ] .",
    "each of these maps is realized by sliding a foot of the 1-handles @xmath384 and @xmath385 of @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively , where @xmath386 is a disk in @xmath21 bounded by @xmath141 .",

    "we may consider @xmath26 and @xmath389 as the haken spheres determined by simple arcs @xmath114 and @xmath145 on @xmath382 respectively , each of which connects @xmath162 and @xmath163 .",
